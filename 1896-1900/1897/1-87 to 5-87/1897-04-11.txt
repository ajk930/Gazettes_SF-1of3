THE FIGHT
Capture the Turkish Garrisons
on the Frontier and
Take Prisoners.
THREE OUTPOSTS ARE BURNED.
At Rome It Is Rumored That War Has

ROME, Italy, April io. â It is rumored here that war has been
declared between Turkey and Greece, but reliable details are lacking.
LONDON, ENG., April io. â The Greek insurgents who crossed
the frontier in Albiana 3000 strong seem to have much the best of the
fighting. They took three Turkish positions, routed a Moslem garrison
and burned the posts.
At midnight last night they were reported to have attacked the
Turks in Baltino and sent nine prisoners back over the frontier to
Calabaka.
London is much concerned by the report that the Duke of York
will join his ship after leaving Lord Wolseley, commander-in-chief, at
Gibraltar. The English channel squadron has been ordered to Malta,
a must significant movement.
WAR IS NOT WANTED.
The Six Powers That Have Tried !
to Aid Turkey Not Anxious
for Hostilities.
Copyrighted 1X96 by the New York Bu-j.]
LONDON, Ekg., April 10.â Once more !
Europe is In trouble and apprehension by j
reason of the event everybody has been j
.-z'.'iC.i.jg fer^i/s.' Thisre lias been fight- I
ing between Greek insurgents and the j
Turkish troops on the Tbessalian frontier, i
and timid people are jumping at tne con- I
elusion that this is the first encasement in j
a universal war. , Public opinion had to !
swing to the opposite extreme the past i
few days, and almost everybody began to
regard the crisis as nearly at an end. To
day's news seems to have destroyed ail
hope of peace in the popular mind.
Pessimistic views wh:ch find public and
private expression in London and dis- !
patches from the continent this afternoon
are extreme beyond reason. It is true
there has been fignling, and it is clear it
was under the auspices of the Greek Na
tional Society, but war has not been de
clared, and ii it had been it by no means
follows, in spite of the alarmist warnings !
of Salisbury, that war between Greece and
Turkey wou.'d involve all the powers.
It is too early to judge just what yester
day's engagement portends. It may
mean simply a certain amount of blood
letting, which may be necessary to reduce j
the public 'war fever in Greece. One j
scrambling fight was necessary in ISB6 be- \
fore Greece was willing to submit to the :
powers' demand to disarm. On the other
hand maybe an unofficial raid was under- |
taken in oidcr to provoke the Turks to I
become the technical agjrebsors in a war
which the Greeks have apparently from I
the first desired. In the former case Greece
will speedily disavow the action of the
. irregulars ard means will be found to
brine the situation to a peaceful issue.
Still in view of the dangerous tension ex
isting not only on the frontier but at Con
stantinople and Athens the probability of
a collision between the reguiar troops is
very strong. If that occurs warcan hardly
be avoided.
There has been a significant change this
week, which alters the whole aspect of the
situation. Official Turkey under the tute-
Jage of the powers has been remarkably
docile until within the past fewiiays. The
tjullan's policy had been purely defensive
with regard to Greece and Moslem passions
throughout the emj.ire had been wonder
fully restrained. This is completely
changed. Turkey is now eager for war
and anxious to assume the aggressive.
Greece, on the other hand, had been j
beyond the control of the powers and con- I
stituted the de difficulty in the way of a j
ution of the | roulem according to their
desires. About a week ago, however, of
ficial Greece began to show signs of be
coming amenable to the argument and
pressure brought to bear upon her.
The reason of the double change was
only apparent within the last day or two.
It is now known that federated Europe
lias grown more conciliatory toward King
George. The persona! efforts of the home
nnd foreign ministers, the Denmark
royal family and the great power of the
financial world sufficed to modify the
attitude of Rus-ia in some degree and to
cause England, France and Italy to take
a more friendly view of the Greek case.
The Suitan was quite shrewd enotich to
recognize nnd recent the i nature. He had
re; a de ih powers as six allies, and, as a
matter of fact, they were until the m*
jority were ready to yield to the crucial
Greek point of withdrawal of Turkish
troops from Crete. Even then he might
Imve yielded but for the latest and great
est folly of the German Emperor.
William protested vehemently a?ain-t
any concession whatever to Greece, in
sisting upon the severest measures of
coercion. Russia herself snubbed Wil
liam, notifying him that as his interests
in the East were less than any other
power he could not expect to force his
views upon all the others. Then, hap
pened what mieht have been expected
from this iiair-brained monarch, who
really is the greatest incarnate danger to
The San Francisco Call
the peace of the world. Public and pri
vate information from several sources, in
cluding diplomatic authorities in Con
stantinople, agree that Emperor William
has secretly encouraged the Sultan to
adopt an aggressive policy.
Next week when the enormiu of his
folly lias been brought home to him the
young Emperor will probably change his
attitude and will be satisfied to do noth
ing wort-e than sulk. But it is a great
danger and then it may be too late to re
pair the mischief. (June likely the Turks
and Greeks will then be at each other's
throats and Europe will be compelled to
devote itself to the task of keeping the
peace between its own members while the
former fight it out. It will be a problem
requiring consummate tact and skill.
England would sacrifice much rather
than be dragged into a war at tbe present
juncture; and no doubt the same spirit is
dominant in the other five Dowers. News
from a variety of other sources on the
Tbesssliau and Macedonian frontiers in
dicates that unfortunately the Turkish
forces are superior in almost all respects
to the Gr eks. The fortifications
on the Turki b side are also much
stronger. The Greeks, apparently, can
hope to succeed only by an uprising nt
the back of the Turkish army in Mace
donia.

THE TURKISH FLEET PASSING THROUGH THE GOLDEN HORN.
After twenty years of idleness, lying moored off the arsenal of Constantinople, the Turkish fleet got under way on the 20th of March last bound for Cretan waters.
It had been announced that the vessels would sail on that day and every window looking on to the harbor, on both the Galata and the Stamboul sides of the Horn,
was blacK with people. while the water was aiive with small boats containing enthusiastic citizens, who cheered themselvss hoarse as the big ships came into view The
first to pass out was the Messodieh. With yards manned and her rigging decorated with flags the great ironclad made an inspiring appearance. She was followed by
the Huinidieh, the Osmanih, the Azizieti and Nedjun-i-Scbefktt, with torpedo-boats and destroyers.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 11, 1897 -THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
OSMAN PASHA, Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of the Sultan.
Osman Pasha, known to fame as "the hero of Plevna," ii one of the ablest soldiers in Europe. He is a Turk by isce, birth
and education. His first active service was during the war in the Crimea. He was made a colonel for his services in aiding
to suppress an insurrection in Crete a few years later, and for his gallantry in the Servian war he was created a field marshal.
His heroic defense of Plevna, the surrender of which virtually closed the Turko-Russian war, is a matier of history. Although
66 years of age he is still an active, energetic man. If hostilities should break out In earnest he will undoubtedly take the field

posts were destroyed.
THE GREEK POSITION.
From a Military Point of View It Is
Much Superior to That of the
Turks.
As far as facilities for handling tbeir
troops are concerned tbe Greeks have an
advantage over the Turks that largely
makes up for the disparity in Dumberj be
tween the two armies.
By means of the railroad connecting
with Larissa, the headquarters of the
Greek army, and Voio, on the Gulf o
Salonica. their base of supplies and com
munication with Athens, they can threw
re-enforcements up to Stagus kalabak, the
railway terminus within fifteen miies of
the Turkish frontier in n few hours, while
the Turks must move their forces from
Elassona by roundabout and difficult
mountain roads.
From Stagus Kalabak the Greeks can
reach Jthe frontier by any one of three
roads at a distance of from fifteen to
fwentyrive miles. By selecting the point
near Krania for the raid they camebut on
the main road and the only passable one

sona.
This road by Metsovo, Gievena, Kosuni
and Servia carries the direct teleeraph
line to Palonica and Elassona, and the
service has been interrupted. Communi
cation with Janina can be bad, however.
J by way of Konitya Gori'ya to Monastir.

The selection oi a place foT makiir this
fir-t m-re across tbe frontier into Turkish
territory was ordered with Â»n eye to niak-
I ing the most of the advantages which
I nature was ready to lend to the weaker
; party.
Few places alone" the whole frontier
present such favorable conditions for such
I an incursion and such unfavorable ones
â  for repelling an attack, especially with
artillery and cavalry.
Btagna Kal.tbak lies well up toward the
headwaters of the Salem bria River; across
j the frontier to the_ north runs the dark,
: brackish waters of the Kora-Su or Indy
: River and between, turning to a height of
j some 5000 feet, are the limestone 11101:11
--j tains of Kratrovo Ktiassia, which rise
rapidly toward the west until they meree
into the parent range, the lofty Pindus at
Mount Lycos, jut = t northwest of Metsovo,
and on whose slopes lies the village of
: Krania. Mount Lygos is nearly 60C0 feet
j in height.
The frontier line coming from the east
I along the summits of the Khassia climbs
this peak preparatory to starting on its
winding southwesterly course to tbe
i headwaiers of the Arta River, which,
! starting from the southern side of a sister
I peiiK to Ly^o?, lorms the boundary ex-
I tended down to the Gulf of Arta.
A rougher country for movement of
troops cannot well be imagine 1 outside of
Crete itself. In every direction for miles,
further than the eye cÂ»n reach, the land
scape offers nothing to the riew but
niountain upon mountain. It is in this
locality, on these elevated spurs of the
miguty backbone of the Balkan Penin
sula, that are to bÂ« seen the "works of the
god?," the "theoJttista" of the ancient
Gr.-ek.
These works consist of isolated towers,
crags and pillars, in whose shadow live
the descendants of the people who
christened them and to whom love of
Greek traditions and hatred of the Turk
seem as natural as the rocks themselves.
Christianity found an early homo with
these people and has always been abie to
command warm and zealous advocates on
both sides of thÂ« frontier.
In Epirus and Upper Macedonia, as
well as in Grecian Thessalv, centuries of
Moslem oppression and cruelty have but
strengthened and confirmed them in the
fuith of Christ. What have they not en
dnred? Many monasteries of the follow
ers of Simion the Stylite formerly existed
in these hills. Perched on the tops of
these natural pillars they offered at once
places of seclusion for the monka and
refuse for victims of barbarity. But in
time they disappoarod. Many were de
stroyed by the Turks and other* were de
populated and abandoned. Now only
about seven remain, of which that o:
Metevia, a few miles north of Stagus, is
the most interesting.

William Henry Theodore Durrant, in
the foregoing words, was yesterday sen
tenced to be hanged in San Quentin on
Friday. June 11, for the murder of Blanche
Lamont.
Every step of the proceedings which
ri lally placed the convicted malefactor,
habited in a striped garb, in a cell in the
condemned murderers' row at San Quentin
prison to await his final doom, was
watched by a throng of spectators that
demonstrated that interest in the extraor
dinary crimes perpetrated in Emmanuel
Church was seemingly unabated.
If any of the morbidly curious expected
to witness any breakdown or exhibition
of weakness on the Dart of the chief living
actor in the dresclful tragedy tliey were
disappointed. Without doubt the stoical
demeanor of Durrant throughout the try
ing ordeals of the day was the most re
markable feature connected with his sec
ond and, presumably, final condemnation
to a felon's death.
Only once did the doomed man flinch.
But the flaw in his extraordinary de
meanor was physical and momentary
only. It manifested itself in the arched
passageway of masonry leading from the
atmosphere of freedom to that of his last
place of rest on earth, a ter he had parted
from his father, who had accompanied
him to the prison.
He atasjgered and nearly fainted, but,
summoning all the power of his wonder
ful iron-like will, he almost instanta- '
neou-iy recovered his strength, and there
after was the same imperturbable Durrant
that has been a core problem to all who
have corns in contact with him since the
day of his arrest two years ago.
His father, too, though fully realizing
that he was escorting his only son to the
place whence be would emerge only to
meet an ignominious death, presented an
equanimity that clearly indicated the
source of the son's Inoian-like indiffer
ence.
Durrant's attorneys used every expedi
ent known to legal practitioners to defer
the hour of doom for their client, but
without avail. It is generally admitted
that the fight made oy General John H.
Dickinson and Eugene Deuprey, counsel
for the prisoner, was the most stubborn
ever recorded in the criminal jurispru
dence of the State, ana they are not yet
done. Already an appeal has been filed
from Judge Bahr's judgment of yesterday.

iMPERTURBABLE DURRANT
Blanche Lament's Murderer the
Coolest Person in the
Courtroom.
At an early hour yesterday morning
urions spectator s began to congregate in
ihe neighborhood of the new City Hall,
showing that the interest of the public in
the crime of the century has not yet
abated. All the corriitors of the new C.ty
Hall were crowded, and so great was the
crush in the vicinity ot Judge Cook's de
partment of the Superior Court where
the sentence was to be pronounced for
the second time that half a hundred
policemen were required to keep order.
Sheriff Wnelan and his deputies escorted
Durrant to the courtroom a few minutes
before the time s t for the convening of
court. The prisoner was accompanied by
hi* father and his attorney, Eugene N.
Deuprey. Durrant was clad in a well-nt
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ting suit of mixed dark gray cloth. Hii
hair was carefully combed, and his
mustache neatly trimmed. His face was
pale, but the clear gray eyes showed no
sign of trepidation. The marvelous nerv>Â«
which this young man has displayed fron*
the day of his arrest two ye<irs ago to tha
present time remained unshaken. His
self-possession was unimpaired through
out the solemn scene in which he played
the most prominent part.
At 10 o'clock Judge George H. Bahrs as
cended the bench, accompanied by judge
Carroll Cook of this City and Judge Jones
of Trinity County.
The trial of Durrant took place in De
partment 3 of the Superior Court, in
which ex- Judge I). J. JUurphv was then
presiaing. When Judge Murphy relin
quished his position on the bench his cal
endar was transferred to Judge Bahrs,
who had formerly sat in IÂ»aj artment 12.
As Judge Bahrs is now devoting his atten
tion to civil suits, ana, consequently, does
not need a large courtroom, he obtained
permission to use for these proceedings
the courtroom of Department 12, which, in
addition to having large space on the
main floor, is supplied with a commo
dious gnl cry.

The three men under arrest pleaded not

BT. LOUIS. Mo , April 10 âAn un
known, tineJy dressed woman threw two
children from the ferryboat Dr. Hill into
the Mississippi River this morning and
then jumped in after them. The children
were rescued, but the woman was drowned.
For a few moments there was treat con
ster:ia:ion on board ihe ferry. Passengers
rushed up and down the decks in a wildly
excited way, and the crew did not seem to
know at first what to do. A man who was
standing near the woman when she threw
the first child in attempted to seize her,
but she eluded him, and with a cry tossed
the child over the side.
Before any one could stop her she
jumped Into the river and speedily drifted
away. Finally, after much trouble and
delay, a boat was lowered and pulled to
the rescue of the three people. The
woman deliberately kept her head under
the water and was drowned before the
boat reached her. The struggles of the
two children, however, kept them afloat
j until they were picked up.
The two littie ones were badly fright
ened and refused to say who they were.
I The passengers say that the woman acted

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10 â
Fight among the Republican organiza
tions in the East has been shown here in
the progress of the movement having as
its object the reappointment of Postmas
ter Wai field of Baltimore, it is the first
and as yet tbe only concerted action look
ing to the recognition of that element of
the Democracy without whose aid Mr.
McKinley would bn a private citizen. As
an individual ex-Senator Palmer of Illi
nois, the recent gold Democratic candi
date for President, has made two reques'.s
of Mr. McKinley in favor of gold Demo
crats. Neither of these cases had any
backing other than that of General
Palmer, and neither of his recommenda
tions will be regarded. It is said there are
two or three isolated cases of gold Demo
crats putting applications on file for minor
offices, but they nave no Republican in
dorsements. There has been no intima
tion in administration circles of a disposi
tion under any circumstance" to appoint
other than Republicans to office, and it is
not believed any Republican of promi
nence will recommend for cilice one not of
his political faith.
In politics where services of political
opponents are recognized it das always
been a matter of arrangement in advance,
and there cannot be many cases on record
where acknowledgment is " vouchsafed
after the service hat been performed. In
the Presidential campaign in 1884, Post
master Pearson of New York was gener
ally nnderstood to favor Cleveland as
agaimt Blaiue, the nominee of his own
party. It was generally assertel that
Pearson managed in some way to prevent
the postoffice employes, the letter-carriers
particularly, from participating in Blame
parades, and to a large degree from hav
ing the opportunity to vote on election
day. .Aside from this, whether true or
not, Pearson, who, likÂ« Wartield, made a
magnificent record in (be administration
of his office, indicated a willingness to
take another term at the bands of a Demo
cratic President. There was no Demo
cratic pressure in his favor, bat Cleveland
gave him the appointment.
As will be remembered, a howl from the
Democratic machine politicians went up
which could be heard all over the United
States. Cleveland expressly stated the
case to be an exceptional one and that it
must not be regarded as a precedent. Sub
-1 sequently, when the term of Postmaster
Adreon of Baltimore was on the point of
expiring, that gentleman also declared he
would not be offended should Cleveland
give him another term. There was no
doubt as to the stanch Republicanism of
Adreon and his unswerving loyalty to
Blame. He stood simply on the record of
bis iaithful and â¢ fficient administration of
tbe duties of a United States office. But
neither Adreon nor any one else fared us
well at the hands of Cleveland as Pearson,
and certainly no one ever sat in the White
House who had less of awe for the politi
cians of his own party than Cleveland.
In tbe case of Warneld it is asked, "Has
| be any Republican backing?" and when
this is answered there is an ominous shak
ing of the head. Ilh understood that the
main if not the only argument designed
formally to be laid before the President in
behalf of Warrield will be his most able
and splendid performance of the responsi
ve duties imposed upon him and that no
stress will be laid upon his attitude in the
last campaign. This is the proper and
becoming course to adopt It is well to
consider, however, that the politicians
always reply to sucn arguments, "There
are a3 good fitb in the sea," etc
Politicians have he ear of tbe adminis
tration; there would be no use to deny it.
What the politicians will say when the
Bound-monÂ»y Lengue of Baltimore comes
up with its manifesto for Wartield re
mains to be seen.

TO FIGHT THE SUGAR TRUST.
Minnesota Compiny Organizes With a
Capra/ of $2,000,000 for Beat-
Growing in the Nurthwist.
MINNEAPOLIS, ltnu., April 10.â The
Minnesota Beet Sugar Company organized
to-day with $2,000,000 capital. The direc
torate will include representatives o! the
Chicago Wholesale Grocers' Association,
who.-c object is to lijrht the sugar trust
by the establishment in the Northwest of
the sugar Leet industry. A $250,000 fac
tory is to be built at Hastings, Minn.,
and others will follow. The railroads
are helping the association and auxiliary
associations are being formed in every
county where the soil is adapted to sugar
beet culture. The incorporators are: T. F.
Kock of St. l'au\ J. H. Smith of Detroit,
Henry Keller and P. J. O'Connell of
Sauk Center, Minn. A State association
was formed in the Senate chamber to-day
to conduct an educational campaign
among the farmers.
IS AERIAL NAVIGATION SOLVED?
Now the Big Airship Said to Have Been
Ssen in Several States Passes
Over Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., April 10â The so-called
airship said to have been seen in Nebraska,
lowa and Kansas seem- to have ap
proached Chicago last night. It was dap
pled with green and white lights. Sober
inhabitants of Chicago, Evanston and
otner lakeside cities say they saw it. Ail
said the airship had a white light in front
and green and smaller white lights on the
side, and a tail light of green. The ship
was making a bee line for Omaha. Crowds
in all the streets disputed every possible
theory that could account for the phe
nomenon.
CALIFORNIA. J-JtUITS FAVOR
Driving European Crop* From the
Market* of England.
NEW YORK, N. V., ADril 10.âCalifor
nia oranges and grapes are driving the
European crops from the English market
and realizing prices satisfactory both to
shippers and middlemen.
The onfy explanation to be obtained
among the wholesale fruit-dealers of this
city is that the English are more partial
; to California fruits than are the American
people themselves, and that consequently
it is necessary to â  put a prohibitive tariff
upon the European product in order to
force an American market for the Amer
ican growers. . . _
It is noteworthy in this connection that
the average retail price of California fruits
in London is from 10 10 15 per cent lower
than charged in New York, Chicago and
other American cities for the products of
the if- same orange plantations and
vineyards.

LEADERS STATE
THEIR POLICIES
Dingley, Bailey and Simp
son Have Their Say
in the House.
Sarcasm of Speaker Reed CouM
Not Suppress the Scckless
Statesman.
Nothing Can Ec Done by the Repre
sentatives Until >he Senate Acts
on Tariff tnd Appropriations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â The
session of the House to-day lasted only an
hour and rive minutes. Tuat was long
enoupb, however, to demonstrate that
Jerry Simpson had chosen an inoppor
tune time to enter upon a crusade against
the transaction of business by unanimous
consent. More than a majority were
present at the opening when Simpson
made a point of no quorum to carry out
the programme outlined by him the other
day, and there is iikely to be no quorum as
long as office-seekers demand assistance
of their -Representatives in hunting
places.
The matter of a quorum being settled.
Dingley, in pursuance of the party's
policy, moved when the House adjourned
it be until Wednesday. This precipitated
a debate lasting three-quarters of an hour,
in which several leaders set forth 'he
views of their respective parties on the
question of transacting general legisla
tion. Incidentally there was developed a
serious difference of opinion auont; the
Democrats, resulting in tr>e calling of a cau
cus immediately after the House adjourned
to discuss their party's policy, which
lasted until late in the afternoon. A alieht
rift in the Republican ranks was also dis
closed by the speech of W T alker of Massa
chusetts, who expressed the opinion that
by special commitie-* or otherwise the
House should order an investigation of
tne banking and currency system during
the summer and fall, thÂ» results to be re
ported at the reassembling of Congress.
The Pouulists alone showed a solid
pnalanx behind their leader.
When Dingley made a motion for a
three-days' adjournment, Bailey asked
what was the object of the majority.
Dingley replied tnat the gentlemen well
knew that no business could be done be
fore the House until the appropriation
bills sent to the Senate had been returned.
"I am not aware," he continued, "that
any other legislation can at present de
mand our attention."
bimpson thought he saw an opportunity
here to work hia scheme, and as a motion
was not debatable, demanded the regular
order, suggesting if he could break into
the debate he might be induced to aban
don his position.
The Speaker crnelly dashed his hopes
in this direction by dryly remarking, amid
general laughter, that the House might
perhaps preier the regular order to hear
ing the gentleman from Kansas.
Bailey succeeded in securing a half
hour's debate, however, and Simpson had
his say. He said the Populists demanded
a complete organization of the House, so
they might proceed to legislate on the
financial question. He got even with the
Speaker by describing his assumption in
bis adaress the other day, that he
would be Speaker beyond peradventure,
as the ''greatest piece of political sooner
ism the country had ever seen."
Dingley set forth the policy of the Re
publican majority to be to do nothing
this session except to further consider the
appropriation and tariff bills now in the
Senate when they were returned to the
House, and indulge in such iurther action
as would meet general approval. "How
ever," he continued, "that purpose is
subject to changes."
Bailey expressed the opinion it was now
good policy for the Democrats to concur
in the Republican policy in their aoiion,
as being (or the best interests of the coun
try.
From this view McKae of Askansas, De
Arrno'id of Missouri aud Fleming of
Georgia dissented.
In closing the debate Bailey gave these
reasons for favoring his policy: "Regard
ing our duties lrom the Highest and broad
est standpoint oi unselfishness, I cannot
free my mind from the positive convic
tion that our duty is to help the Republi
can party to save the people from legisla
tion they might enact. If they do any
thing it will be to perpetuate the National
banking system and provide for the re
tirement of legal tender notes.
"The country gave you tho power to
pass laws. You have attempted to restore
prosperity by increasing the taxes. It
you succeed I want to say to the Demo
cratic party it might as well not make
any nomination for the next Presidential
election. If you fail you mijiht as well not

Why Congrem Jiailet/ Wouldn't Dine
at t lf Whit* JUou.m.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â The t
friends of Representative Bailey, the
Democratic leader in the House, are In
clined to be indignant over the reports
t nat have been sent broadcast to the effect
that in declining an invitation to dine at
the White House because he was averse to
the wearing of a Qiess suit, he violated all
precedents. .
As a matter of fact there has not been a
Congress since the war that has not con
tained members more or less in number
who avoided all social functions simply
on account of their unwillingness to don
the claw-hammer coat and cutaway vest.
The most conspicuous offender â if it.be
an offense â of recent administrations in
â¢ his particular was , Attorney-General
Garland, who persistently absented him
self from social events at the .White
House because he could not accustom
himself to conventional attire.
Fund* Wanted for the Court*.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 10âAttor
ney-General McKenna to-day asked Con

United States courts. These include $100,
--000 jurors' fees, $24,000 for the support of
prisoners. $40,000 lor bailiffs and $75,000
for miscellaneous expenses. The Attor

for the coming month will be greatly
embarrassed unless the funds are appro
priated.

OBJECTS TO THE
CUBAN JUNTAS
Spain Intends to Eater a Pre
test With the United
States.
An Envoy on the Way With
Proof That Neutrality Laws
Are Violat?d.
Meanwhile the Insurgents Are Ba
tling Bravel/ aid Surely
Winning Fr<.e om.
MADRID, Sr.UN, April 10â It is be
lieved that Spain intends to formally pro
test to the United States against the op
erations of the Cuban juntas in this
country. Major SandovaFs special mis
sion is said to be to present letters written
by the President o! the Cuban Junta in
New York to insurgent leaders in Cuba
proving that the Junta is violating the j
neutrality laws. The Spanish Minister â  ;
Washington is to be instructed to urpe
the United States to proceed against the
Junta.
HAVANA, ( rn\, April 10.â Ln Lucha
to-day publishes a leader referring to the
arreM ot Eanguilly at Jacksonville. It
says the policy of McKinley will be firmer
than Cleveland'?. Colonel Cirujeda, the
officer in command of the troops when
.Miceo was killed, was recently appointed
adjutant of the Q-.ieen Regent's military
household, and sailed for Spain to-day to
assume the duties of his new cilice.
Interesting details have been received
of a hrrce enÂ«a.'enient near San Cristo
bal, Piiiar del Rio province. A Cuban
lorce of 700 men, while marching toward
the city, was atiacke I by ICOO Spaniards.
The Cubans were d.'.yen back with a
heavy loss, but tinally Santa Mver ad
vanced to the front, crying, "We are
Kivera's army. Shame upon you, men.
Don't make bim weep in his ceil; we
must avenge him." The Cubans re
sponded with hear!}- cheers and dashing
forward drove the Spaniards back into
the entrenchments of San Cristobal. The
Cuban force was too small to attack the
city and so it retired. The Spanish loss is
said to have b;en nearly 100 during the
day's lighting, while tho Cuban loss was

United Slates Offers Temporarily Check
a FiliOuttrritig Expedition.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 10.âOffi
cial information was received to-day of
the arrest of Colonel Emilio Nunez, re
cently appointed to succeed Genera!
Rivera. The arrest was made by the
Treasury officials at Palm Beach, Fla., on
a charge that Colonel Nunez had violated
the quarantine regulations by coming
ashore from a foreign ship to which a
clean bill of health had not been given.
An armed expedition which intended to
land in Cuba was also frustrated, accord
ing to the report, the United States offi
cers were engaged in an effort to capture
the members. The official report gives a
detailed story of the circumstances attend
ing the breaking up of the expedition and
the arrest of Nunez. On Thursday night
a large party of Cubans left Jacksonville
on a special iran for Palm Beach. When
the train nrrived there the Cubans were
about to embark on the Bermuda, when
they saw men on the station. They sus
pected they were agents of the Federal
Government. A consultation was held,
and the train pulled out in a hurry. It is
supposed it was stopped below Palm
Beach, the Cubans hiding in the vi
cinity.
The report says the Bermuda has not
gone to Cuba, but is wailing an oppor
tunity to take the men aboard. Nunez
came ashore from the Bermuda in a small
boat. Treasury officials were waiting
there, and be was taken into custody.

A tempting to Buy H<s Way

FRANKFORT, Ky., April 10. â The
Senatorial struggle In the Legislature to
day was characterized by the publication
of stories of attempted bribery against
Dr. Godfrey Hunter, the Republican cau
cus nominee, and ex-Congressman^John
H. Wilson, his manager. Noel Games,
a young silver Democratic politician, pre
ferred the charges, which are backed by
his brother-in-law, T. Tanner. They were
summoned before the Grand Jury, testi
fyinc yesterday and to-day.
Other witnesses were summoned, but
up to this af'ernoon an indictment had
not been returnei.
Games swore that Tanner received a
telephone message on March 31 to como

he did so. Tanner introduced Hunter to
Games. Hunter then said he understood

came back twice afterward. The last time
he urged Games to g^t the men to absent
themselves if they would not vote for
Hunter.
Dr. Hunter denies that ho ever saw
Games or Tanner or thai he ever arcamed
of bribing anybody .
Wilson says that Gair.es sent tim word
that he could get three votes for Hunter
for $1.3,000 each. He went to see Games,
but got no satisfaction, and never
promised him any money. Afterward, he
says. Games told him that he must have
$10i/0 or he wou'd put Hunter in stripes.
Wilson says be is now convinced that this
was a scheme to ruin Hunter.
The announcement of the charges cre

paid no attention to natural boundaries
in the delimitation of the frontier between
Turkey and Greece.
Starting on the Gulf of Satonica, just
south of Platomona, the line runs over Low
Olympus to Kokkino Petra, nearTurnavo,
then turns south across and up the valley
of the Xeragi River to the Chassin hills
and on to Mount Lygos and the Pindus
and down the Arta. This gives Turkey a
good part of Thessaly and nearly all of
EpiruÂ«, whose natural eastern boundary
is the creut of the Pinduv On the sides of
this conventional boundary line we find
the same rock--, thÂ« same trees and the
same landscape; the same people and the
same determination in their hearts,
handed down by their ancestors, to resist
Turkish rule and become a free and united
nation.
In all of Turkish Thessaly. the whole of
the Kara-Su Valley up to Kastoria, all of
Epirus from above Konitza down to the
Gulf or Arta, the people are ail Greeks,
with a few Grseco- Latins on the west coast
opposite Corfu. There are no Mussulman
residents in the country except the
officials and soldiers.
It is among these people that the Greek
visitors have made their appearance, and
they have doubtless foun.i a wild'wel

that of Mitsovo and Grevena swarms with

EX-SENATOR D. W.
VOORHEES DEAD
Falls Into the Arms of His
Son and S^on After
Expires.
Had Suffered for a Long Time
From Rheumatism of the
Heart.
Ske eh of the Great Democret's Public
Life, C verinp; a Period of
Forty Years.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â Ex-
Senator Daniel W. Yoorhees died at his
residence in this city at 5 o'clock this
morning. He had btcn in poor health for
several years and latterly was a creat suf
ferer from rheumatism of the heart.
While his death was sudden it cannot be
said to have been unexpected, as his
friends feared that his malady was liable
to terminate fatally at any moment.
During the last Presidential campaign
< tfce Senator's health was poor that he
was unable to take any part in tbe politi
cal discussions of the hour. After his re
turn to Washington from Indiana in
November, however, his condition ap
peared to be greatly improved. Two
we^ks aco his old rheumatic troubles re
turned, and three days ago he became
alarmingly ill, but did not confine himself
to bed, and the family felt no immediate
alarm. It was not, indeed, until half an
hour before the final summons came that
any one thought death was near.
Tbe Senator's son, Reese Voorlieos, had
remained in the room during the night,
and was awakened about 4 o'clock this
morning by his father, who was then Buf
fering great pain in the region of the
heart. He refused, however, to call a
pnysician, saying that the pain would pass
â way. Half an hour iater he appeared
much better and got out of bed to walk to
the bathroom, bis son being with, him
When they entered the hallway the Sena
tor was attacked by a more severe spasm
than he ha I yet experienced and fell in a
semi-conscious condition into Â».is son's
arn'i. Tbe latter carried him back to bed
and summoned the doctor, but it was too
late. Toe Senator soon passed away,
without regaining consciousness. His
only son, Reese, bis daughter, Miss Hal
lie Voorhees, and the physician were pres
ent when he died.
Tue remains will be taken to Terre
Haute, Ind., the Senator's homo for many
years, for interment.
Daniel Woisey Voorhees was born in
Biuler County, Ohio, September '26. 1527.
In 1845 he entered the De Pauw Uni
versity, from wnich he was graduated in
1849. He studied law, ana in 1851 was ad
mitted to practice. In 1856 he ran for
Congress, but was defeated. The follow
ing year he settled in Terra Haute,
which was for many years his home. In
1858 he was appointed Uaited Stales Dis
trict Attorney by President Buchanan.
In 1860 he was elected to Congress, and
was re-elected in 18G2 and 18C4. In 18G6
his seat was successfully contested by
Henry D. Wa->hburn, but he was returned
in 1868 and re-elected in 1870 and 1872. In
1877 bo was appointed to the United Stales
Senate an a Damocrat to (ill the vacancy
caused by the death of Oliver P. Morton.
He was subsequently elected by the Legis
lature for the lull term ensuing, and was
re-elected in 1885 and again iv 1891, his
term expiring March 3d last.
AIDING THE FLOOD SUFFERERS.
Government Officers Find Several Counties
Under Vl iier and Many People in
Distress.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 10.âSec
retary Aiger to-day received several
messages irom army officers sent to Mem
phis to distribute supplies to the flood
sufferers, staling that much difficulty is
encountered in securing steamers at rea
sonable rates for transportation. Forest
and river boatmen are determined to
charge exorbitant prices. Colonel Sanger,
in charge, reports chartering a small ves
sel. He leaves to-morrow for Helena,
where he will immediately begin the dis
tribution of food ami medicine.
Reports show that an immense area is
inundated and the river's average width
is not less than twenty miles at some
points. Nine-tenths of the refucees are
negroes in a helpless condition. One fam
ily just rescued sustained life since Sun
day on three ears of corn.
Lieutenant Wheeler of the party leaves
to-morrow for Cairo to becin a systematic
investigation into the sufferers' wants,
and carried by steamer a vast amount of
snppnes purchased by the Government at
Memphis. The army men found it neces
sary to charter steamers at $1.50 a day. At
one point near Helena it is reported that
three entire counties are under water, and
across in Arkansas there are two.
This morning the Governor of Arkansas
telegraphed to Secretary Alger suggesting
the placing o; funds at his disposal in
stead of supplies, but the officials propose
spending the money as they deem best
and will devote the entire appropriation
to the purchase of food.
The Governor of North Dakota wants

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 10âGov

priations for the fl >od sufferers.
MEMPHIS, Texn., April 10âThe Sun
flower River at Clarksdale is still rising,
but it is thought the town ran be saved.
At island 23, while tho river is rising, the
people are living on the housetops. Six
children were lost near this island yester
day. B. J. Lee was drowned in the flood
near Stovell, Miss. Four men in a skiff
were also drowned.
Upper Louisiana levees are now receiv
ing their tit-it severe strain from the high
water. Two private levees in upper Madi
son parish pave way yesterday ana many
miles of the parish are under water.
MEMPHIS, Ten.v., April 10.-Extra
guards were placed on the levee to-night,
the heavy rains increasing the danger.
With the river stationary at Memphis and
Cairo and the Upper Mississippi rising,
the duration of the flood is now a question
that only the future can determine. The
great volume of water whicii for weeks
has filled the Arkansas bottoms and is
now rushing into the delta continues pars
ing into the main channel again and adds
to the already swift current whicii now
threatens the Louisiana levees. Along
Bogue Phalia, one of the richest sections
of the delta, the people are in distressing
circumstances. Relief was sent from
Kosedale to-day. The towns of McLemore
and Sherard are submerged three feet.
The Ohio is again rising from Pittsburc:
south.
HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEES.
May Not Be Named by Speakir Reed
Before the Regular Session Meets
in December.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 10.âOffi
cers of tbe army, navy and marine corps
need not expect that the reguiar commit
tees of the House of Representatives will
be named in season to permit of legisla
tion in which tney are in terested being
considered before the regular session to
convene next December. Many members
of the House have indulged the hope that
Speaker Reed would conclude to name the
usual committees and that certain general
legislation would be considered in the
course of the present extra session. Con
siderable pressure has Often brought to
bear upon Mr. Keed. The Speaker, how
ever, is firmly of the opinion that he
should take no such course. Tlie reason
for the Republican members of the House
wanting ihe committees appointed was
obvious. It appeal a a majority of the
Democrasic members have also argued
that the committees be announced.
Speeker Reed has regarded the argu
ments of his political opi oii3nts as of a
purely political nature, and this fact may
have influenced his iinal decssion. O her
questions also affected his conclusions.
Mr. Heed has not formally stated why he
will not announce the committees, but he
has said with considerable emphasis that
the appointment of committees need not
be expected at this session iv time to per
mit oi any business being transacted by
them before adjournment.
It is barely possible that circumstances
may arise that will induce the Speaker to
change his mind, but judging from the
present outlook, and basing the remark
upon the opinions of many members of
the House expressed this week, it is not
probable. The Speaker's plan is to ap
point :he usual committees shortly before
the extra session adjourns. This will
likely be about the end of June, as the
consensus of opinion among Congress
men is that an adjournment will take
place between the Ist and the 15th of
July.

WILD WAVE Of
SPECULATION
Englishmen Who Are Plan
ning to Make Money-
Out of the Jubilee.
Fabulous Prices Paid to Secure
the Exclusive Use cf Barns
and Windows.
Even Earl Sp ncer's Magnificent Man
sion Ii Let to the Duke cf
Marlborougb.
[Copyrighted, 1897, by the New YorK Sun.]
LONDON, Eng., April 10.â The wild
speculation in seats from which to view
the Queen's jubilee procession Uas become
a perfect craze. It requires little calcula
tion to show at the prevailing prices the
pay ins spectators on Jubilee day are ex
pected to spend in the aggregate of about
$50,000,000 for the privilege -of seeing the
ahow. This is simply absurd and points
to the inevitable collapse of the insane
gamble before the fete day arrive?.
Wise ones who have premises along the
route are pocketing the immense fees now
offered by speculators. The highest price
paid thus far is $125,000 for a large ware
house, literally more than the value of
the building. Two of the richest Dukes,
Westminster and Devonsnire, had offers
of $50,000 apiece for the use of their town
mansions on Jubilee day. The offers were
not entertained. Five thousand dollars
has been paid for rooms in St. James
street of which the annual rent is only
$1000.
A great many lordly Englishmen are
not above making money themselves out
of the approaching loyal rejoicings. Earl
Spencer's magnificent mansion has been
let to the Duke of Marlborough for a figure
said to be prodigious.
Rhode 3is on the way back to Cape
Town, probably to upset the present paci
fic Ministry, and events throughout South
Africa still seem to be tending steadily to
trazedy. News reaches Europa indicating
the Boers are preparing for eventualities,
but few Englishmen realize the real seri
ousness of the situation. Some of them
might read with advantage a letter by the
last mail, written by a rnoierate, observ
ant British resident of Pretoria. "It is a
great pity," he ob >erve3, "that the pas
toral character of this town and the beauty
of the hills are now being profaned by the
military spirit all over the country. The
hills around Pretoria are now being rap
idly converted into uÂ«ly fortresses, while
the quietude of i he streets of Pretoria is
constantly disturbed by the hurrying of
armed horsemen and the marching of
squares of recruits. Drilling and parades
are as common as in any English garrison
town."
According to this observer Krnger is
surrounded by foreign military advisers,

BUDD ON MT. TANALPAIS.
The Governor and a Parly of Prcmnent
Politicians Pass a N.ght at
the Summit.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., April 10.â They
did not throw bouquets at Governor
"J m" Budd this afternoon when he ar
rived in Mill Valley with his party to
take the train lor the summit of Mount
Tamalpais; not that there were not flow- <
ers in profusion with wh'ch the pathway
of the chief executive might have been
strewn, but it was not done for the reason
that Mill Valley is in Marin County, and
Governor Budd pocketed certain bills
parsed by tlie late Legislature that lavoreri
Marin County. In t lie language of the
Bawery politician, "He didn't do a ting
to Marin." And so v.hen the pr.fli'isr lit
tle engine came steaming into Mill Valley
with its celebrated guests, instead of a 'â 
dilute of flowers, all that greeted him was |
a row of ci;rio;i? faces owmd by people |
waiting to cet a look at the Governor.
As the boat arrived at Sausahlo the
Governor and party occupied prominent
positions on the upper deck. Prison Di
rector James H. Wilkins led the party off |
the boat, and seaÃ were found on the for- I
ward car of the Mill Valley train. The |
train moved out immediately and maue
but one stop on its trip to Mill Valley.
TnÂ« mountain road had all the peopie it
could handle and move, but the Governor
and his party found room and the train
pulled out.
The party will spend to-night on the
summit. Besides Governor Budd, the
party includes: Prison Director Jumes H. i

remarked J. C. Rives, a Downey attorney,

he is as an oriinarv sugar vine to a Se

OREGON'S CHINESE JONG.
Coolie Fishermen on the Columbia Or
ganize to Drive Out White
Labor.
TORTLAND, 0r.., April 10 âThe
Chinese cannery workers of the Lower
Columbia River have effected an organi
zation known us the Q;iong Sing Tong.
Coolies notified the eannervmen of As
toria and the Columbia River that no
white labor must be employed in thecan
nene?, otherwise the members of this
Tartar gang will refuse to work. J. E.
Dahl of Astoria, who was here to-day,
says that toe eannervmen bowed to the
Mongolian demand and consented to de
prive whiie men and women of the oppor
tunity of earning n few dollars fron; the
packing oi tish caught in the Columbia
River.
If the Chinese are really employed to
the exeiu-ion ot white peoDle who have
experienced hard times during the past
year owing to the fishermen's strike a reign
of bloodshed may bi looked forward to.
The anti-Chinese riots sure to follow in
such an event will prove more serious and
costly than tnose here in 1886 Tbe white
fishermen along the Columbia liver,
whose families have heretofore lound
lignt work Ml th' canneries are wild over
tne'suggestion of putting their bread iuio
the mouths of the Chinese and ti.ey al
ready are in a threatening mood.

Sundry Husbands Send Sympathetic
Letters to the Imprisoned
Millionaire.
SAN RAFAEL, Cai*. April 10.â Colonel
Peter A. Fin^sn will spend the Sabbath
in the County Jail.
"I expect that my attorneys will do
something the fore part of the week," said
he, to-day, "so that 1 will not be compelled
to remain here longer; but I don't mind
it. The Sheriff treats me well ana I have
the besi cell in the prison."
This wan true, and the friends of the
millionaire- who is being sued for a di
vorce by his wife.' Mrs. Kmlly B. Finigan,
have shown their faith in him by sending
hun flowers and bringing all Kinds of good
things to eat, drink and smoke.
Colonel Finigan to-day told something
of his life with the wife who issuing far
divorce.
"It was while we were in Monfe Carlo,"
said he, "during the winter of 1892-93 that
Mrs. Finigan asked me to above her arm.
1 refused to no this and told her that it
looked v.ell enough. Mrs. Finigan was
at this time the most beautiful
and '.he best- dressed woman at
the famous gambling resort. She looked
like a queen and liked to show herself.
When 1 refused to shave her arm she
went out alone after dark, which women
never do there if they wish to be consid
ered respectable, and went to a barbershop
half a mile away and had her arm shaved
by the barber. There was to be a grand
bail that nigUtand Mrs. Finigan wished
to wear a low-neck and short-arm dress,
and it was for this reason she wanted the
hair on her arm shaved off. We went to
the ball, nevertheless, and Mrs. Finigun
attracted much attention, for she really is
a very beautiful woman.
"She says that I had a pistol under my
pillow at the Baltimore hotel and this
frightened hÂ«Â»r. Now, for a fact, it was be
cause Mrs. Fitiigan wanted me to have a
firearm that I kept the weapons under my
pillow. She was afraid whan I didn't
have them; but it is a fact that the only
time when I did not have a pistol wa3
when I was at the Baltimore. 1 had come
away from Paris in a hurry and left the
weapon there,
"I met the woman at a doctor's office in
the Palace Hotel, and had not known her :
over two months when we were married.
Then I received anonymous letters from
both men and women telling me about
her. We lived together for thirteen years
nnd I have spent large sums of money on
her.
"Do I blame Jndge Angelottl for lind
ing me guilty of contempt? No, sir.
There isn't a Judge in' the State whom I
would rather have fry me than Judge
Angelotti. But there is one thing: 1
only wish he were older and had had ex
perience with beautiful women.
"Mrs. Finigan has no grounds for a di
vorce, and I- do not believe she can get
one. I do not intend to pay her any
money so that she and her attorneys can
have wine suppers. i rather stay here.
Why, do yon know since I have been here
I have made many friends that I did not
know I ever had. To-day I received fif
teen letters, most of them from people I
do not know."
The colonel then showed one which
read as follows:
Bah Francisco, April 9, 1897.
Colonel Peter A. Finiganâ Dear Eik: Seeing
your likeness in to-day's paper I feel like ex
pressing my admiration for your hwroie con
duct in standing off unjust exactions. Were
I in your place I wouid act just the same.
Yoi deserve a medal from all buncoed huj-
DHiids- Early sympathy :or the gentler sexâ
so calledâ is ell thrown away, for the laws are
ail in their favor. Amuse yourself by reading
"Pickwick" (Charles Dickens). He will offer
you much consolation. Though this case is
net exactly like yours the principle is the
same. He made himself quite comfortable In
jail. Be firm. Don't recede, and you will
surely triumph.
ALT GELD IS IMPLICATED.
Interested in ihe dobs Bank and Treas
urer Spaiding, Who Is Now in
Hiding.
CHICAGO, 111., April 10â Judge Tuley
to-day entered an order permitting the
Chicago Title ana Trust Company, re
ceiver of the Globe Savines Bank, to make
a thorough search of the secret boxes of
the Globe Deposit Company. The order
was made after an affidavit was read
â¢bowing it would be to the interest of de
positors and the University of Illinois, as
Spaiding, an absent party, had concealed
the slocks, bonds and cash to the amount
of $500,000 and fled with the keys. De
velopments to-day in the bank failure and
Spalding's treasurership of the university
again brought Altgeld's n*me before tfce
public It is shown that Altgeld was
vice-president and a director of the bank
at the time of his election as Governor,
bat was compelltd by law to resign when
taking office.
He remained a heavy stockholder, how
ever. The trustees of the university ob
jected to the tirat bond offered by Treas
urer SpaJding, but the records show that
on the suggestion of the Governor the
bond was approved later. The Governor's
anxiety for the qualification of Spaldin?
is said to have been due to the fact that
the Globe Bank was financially embar
rassed four years ago, and only a day or
two remained of the sixty days' notice
given by the depositors who wanted
money. Ten men, including Solomon
Spaiding of Nashua, N. H., father of the
treasurer, qualified to the bond for $600,
--000. scheduling $852,000 worth of unen
cumbered property. As soon as the bond
was accepted tho university funds were
removed from the S;ate treasury to the
Globe BanK, which was thus saved from
ruin.
Bankers who hove examined the bond
fay it is not worth more than half what it
purports to represent. Lehman, who is
acting receiver for the bank, said it might
be impossible for the trustees to recover
the bonds of the university when they call
for an accounting next Tuesday, owing to
the court injunction. Spaiding has ob
tained a restraining order preventing the
removal of any securities from tne Globe
vaults. His hiding place remains a
mystery.
Indignant depositors of the Globe Bank
to the number of 200 met to-night to dis
cuss methods by which to punish the bank
officials. An adjournment was taken
until to-morrow afternoon, when 1000 will
attend.
CLEVER SURGICAL OPERATION.
Bone Removed From the Fractured Skull
of a Forger to Establ sh the
Plea of Insanity.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 10.â The
most interesting surgical operation ever
performed here vras conducted at the St.
Alexis Hospital to-day. The subject was
R. N. Cunningham, on trial for forging
Judge Hamilton.-* name to a $75,000
check. His lawyers claimed that Cun
ningham was insane when he forged the
check. A depression "as plainly seen on
the forger's skull, but physicians con
tended that it was simply a congenital de
pression. To determine this Cunning
ham was released on bail and taken to the
hospital. Dr. Tuckerrnan, after cutting
into the skull, removed the bone over the
depression and a complete fracture of the
skull was plainly evident. This is likely
to lead to a decision that Cunningham
was insane and not responsible for the
crime. The operation required forty-five
minutes. Cunningham has fully recov
ered.
CUT A BAnKENTINE IN TWO.
During a Dense Fog the Steamer La
Grande Duchtsse Ran Down ard
Sank the Nellie Smith.
SAVANNAH, Ga., April 10.â While the
Plant ftearaer La Grande Duche^se, which
arrived to-night, was steaminc through a
dense fog on the way from New York Fri
day night she collided with the American
barkentine Nellie Smith, bound from
Cuba to New York, cutting the barken
tine in two. The barkentine sank in five
minutes.
Captain Dodge, the first and spcond
mates and two of tbe crew of the Nellie
Smith were lost. The steamer's Doat
picked up the lookout, helmsman and
steward from the wreckage.
RAIDING THE TOLLGATES
Daring Outrages Committed by
Lawless Bands of Ken-
tuckians.
Even the Home of Governor Brad'ey
Is Not Free From Operations
of the Bad Men
LOUISVILLE, Kv., April 10.-Tollgate
raiders, jwho have committed many acts of
lawlessness since November, are constantly
extending their field of operation and the
task of checkine their depredations is so
formidable as to require extraordinary
measures. From merely chopping down
tollgates they now use dynamite. They
have burned several houses and wounded
a number of men.
In Garrard County they have threatened
to bang a Judge if he attempts to have
them arrested; have notified a number of
rich farmers they must grow no tobacco
this year and miller* have been warned
not to charge more than $1 a hundred
pounds for flour. Tobacco, they say, has
been overproduced so the prices are too
iow, and the millers have taken advantage
of the high price of wheat to put up Hour,
so the poor man must eat only corn bread.
Garrard County, in which they have been
operating mosl, is the home ot C.overnor
Bradley- Indignant that the home of the
Governor snould thus be disgraced, the
leading citizens offer a reward of $0000 for
the conviction of the outlaws. Nobody
has attempted to earn the money and the
raiders have grown so bold that the roads
in that section are being abandoned.
One of the worst outrages was com
mitted at Cornishviile, when the house of
Cal Atkinson, a gatekeeper, was fired, and
wben he ran out he was shot and severely
wounded. He was put in charge of the
gate because he was so popular it was not
believed the raiders would have the hardi
hood to attack him. The owners applied
to the County Judee tor help. He prom
ised to protect them, but after thinking it
over with the directors they decided to
abendon their gates. Director Terhune,
an old solaier, owns ninety-eight shares
of etock worth $.50 a share, but says he
woul I rather give them up than run the
risk of being killed. The directors have
been notified they will be dynamited if
tfiey <lo not stop taking toll. Many raiders
are known, but no one is found with cour
age enough to go before a Grand Jury and
have them indicted.
JLOHII*A'S SKS ATOHIAi, fJGHT.
liryan'a Speech liefnre the Legislature
Vptetm the Call Men.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 10.â Now
that Brynn has addressed the Florida
Legislature it is doubtful whether the
purpose for which he was brought here
has been accomplished. The purpose was
to help re-elect Call to the Senate. Call
has a leading opponent in Colonel W. D.
Chlpley, whose character for enterprise is
exceptional. The only danger in the way
of Chipley is too many rivals. The united
opposition has Â» majority in the Legisla
ture, but the trouble is to bring it to
gether.
This fact induced the Cail people to
secure an invitation for Bryan to speak
herÂ«, believing it would affect the voting
and re-elect Call. The gold men did not
permit themselves to be led into the oppo
sition, but joined in the reception. Bryan j
in opening his speech expressly declared j
that he had no part in ti.e Senatorial can- j
vass.
The Call forces are greatly disconcerted
and to-day have been denouncing Uryan
for having referred to the Bnhject at all.
Bryan spnke at Jacksonville to-night.
During the day he took a trip on the fili
buster Dauntless flying the Cubnn flat?.
After speaking at Washington and Cin
cinnati he will return to Nebraska.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 11, 1897.
SEARCHING FOR
DUNHAM'S BODY
Strange Mission of Two
Men at the McGlincy
Ranch.
Believe That the Suspect Was
Himself the Victim of
Assassination.
Advance the Novel Theory That H?
Was Impersonated by the Real
Murderer
SAX JOBE, Cat.., April 10.â Charles
Corey, proprietor of the Auserais House
Cafe, has always maintained that James
C. Dunham was no: the murderer of the
McGlincy family at Campbell, and that
he, also, fell a victim to the murderous
hand that perpetrated the sextuple assas
sination. Mr. Corey, accompanied by
Amador de la Rosa, to-day went out to the
McGlincy ranch prepared to make an in
vestigation on the line of his beliefs. He
hopes to continue the work for several
dÂ«ys if permitted to do so, in the search
for evidence to bear out his theory.
It is Mr. Corey's belief that the real per
petrator of the horrible slaughter was not
Dunham and that the murderer, to throw
suspicion upon Dunham, killed him and
buried him in the orchard.
Notwithstanding tnat Dunham was seen
by a neighbor and one of the hired men
on the place while doing some of the
shooting and the other strang proofs that
he was the murderer Mr. Corey holds that
since the most thorough search has been
made upon all kinds of clews lor Dun
ham and not a bit of reliable information
concerning him has ever been received
since the time of the murder, bis body
must be not far under the soil on the Mc-
Glincy place, and the real murderer has
never yet been suspected. He holds that
the murderer might have disguised him
self to look like Dunham and that this
deceived those who saw the murderer.
Mr. Corey and Mr. de la Rosa took a
long, pointed iron with them and probed
about in the orchard near the house for
several hours, but were unable to uncover
any trace of the fugitive murderei's body.
No sort of argument changes Mr. Corey's
views, and he will endeavor to prove his
theory if allowed to do so.

tenced to sixty days in the County Jail.
The prisoner was originally charged with

larceny.
Potter was employed at the creamery for
several months, bu: was discharged be
cause of suspicions as to his honesty.
After leaving the creamery he engaced In
the butter business and sold butter to
patrons of his former employers greatly

WASHINGTON, D. C. April 10._ Sen
ator Chandler intends to introduce on Wed
nesday a bill providing tftat the Govern
ment shall immediately take possession of
the Carnegie and Bethlehem steel-plants
and run them until enough armor is sup
plied for the battle-ships under construc
tion, and then turn them back to the
owners.
Tha steel companies can go into court
with claims for damages. Cbandier said
to-night: "The Carnegie and Bsthle
uem companies have formed a big
monopoly to control the manufacture and
sale of armor-plate. The Government's
right to take these works ia constitutional.
We can't have three battle-ships standing
without armor and be arrogantly told we
can't have armor."
THE NICARAGUA CANAL
Minister Baker to Maks Efforts to Pre
vent ihs Forfeiture of ihe
Big Concession.
WASHINGTON, D. C,, April 10 -The
Government has instructed Minister Ba
ker at Managua to make efforts to prevent
the forfeiture of the Nicaragua canal con
cession. This action was taken upon rep
resentations made by President Hitchcock
of the Maritime Canal 'Company. Hitch
cock notified the State Department that
he had information indicating that Nica
ragua was contemplating steps looking
to the revocation of the concession.
In addition to tating steps to prevent
a forfeiture of the concession, Baker has
beeu directed to carefully gauge the sen
timent among the officials of Nicaragua
in regaid to tne canal.
There is reason to believe that Secretary
Sherman is awaiting Congressional action
in the canal matter. Although Minister
Rodrigv.ez. early i Q the administration,
informed Sherman that he desired to
commence negotiations at once looking to
the consummation of a treaty for the con
struction of the canal, up to the present
nothing whatever has been done in the
matter. Baker's investigation, however,
shows that the new administration will
aot neglect the matter.
SAVED FROM A LEOPARD
Heroism of Mrs. "Jack" Gardner,
Boston's Eccentric Society

BOSTON, Maps, April 10.â Mrs. "Jack' :
Gardner, the well-known eccentric mil
lionaire leader of Boston society, hnd a
thrilling adventure at the Zoo to-day,
saving the life of her escort, a memDer of
a grand opera troupe. The affair is the
talk of the town to-night. AmherÂ»t Web
ber is being entertained by the Gardners
and Mrs. Jack drove him to tne Zoo.
While she was peeking at a baby lion her
companion, disregarding the precaution
ary sign "Danger,"' stepped ioside the rail
guarding the cage of tbe untamed man
eating leopards and reached through the
bars to pat one of the animals.
It wss almost fatal foolhardiness. There
was a quick spring, a shriek, a sound of
rending garments and the effeminate
little opera man collapsed in the deadly
clutches of the bloodthirsty animal. He
was utterly helpless and his destruction
Â«eemed to be imminent when Mrs.
"Jack" rushed to the rescue. Without a
moment's hesitation or sign of fear tha i
grasped the fainting man in one arm
while she blinded tbe vicious leopard with
the other hand by hurling her wrap right
in its eyes with her full force.
Completely oblivious to her own danger !
she played the heroine, while men and i
keepers stood back trembling. The leo
pard, dazed and blinded, relaxed the hold
of his claws, which had stint deep Mito
the tiÂ«sh of Webber'^ arm, and Mrs, Jack
palled him away. She was just in time.

TRINITY'S BURIED FOREST.
Masses of Charred Wood Uncovered in
Blue Clay Thirty Feet Below
the Surface.
REEDING, Cal., April 10.â During the
past week a considerable amount of
charred wood has been uncovered at
Weaverville, Trinity County, in the Hupp
A McMurry mine in pining oft the gravel.
The wood is found in blue clay at the
depth of thirty feet. It is cedar, very
heavy, but not petrified, and about a cord
of it has been excavated. Some of it has
the appearance of having been sunped by
human hands, but this is only conjecture.
Judging from the depth it must evidently
have been lelt there many centuries a.o.
The Trinity Journal advances the theory
that the charred wood is the remnant of a
forest fire, probably originating from a
lightning-struck trre. Turn in the shift
ing of the ages a large body of water stotd
above the ruins of the forest and covered
it with debris. The wood is in a good
state of preservation and specimens of it
will be sent to the State University
museum.
There is no doubt as to the antiquity of
the gravel deposit in Trinity County. A
few years ago a skeleton of a prehistoric
animal was found imbedded in the gravel
at Junction City.

MOUNTAIN HOUSE
BANDITS CONFESS
Outlaws Describe the Raid
on the Colusa County-
Hostelry.
One of th? Pair Barely Missed
by a Bullet Fired From
a Window.
Dodged the Officers for Weeks, Only
to B> Located aud Arrested
in Oregon.
COLUSA, Cal., April 10.â The Moun
tain House bandits â John Buchanan and
Bert Ansen â nave confessed their guilt
and Judge Albery bas set Monday, April
112, as the date for passing sentence.
In the County Jail this morning the
outlaws told their story of the raid, Buch
anan acting as spokesman. They were on
their way to the coast in search of work
and had uot as far as the Mountain
House, about twenty-two miles west of
Colusa, when one of th^ir horses gave out.
They at first decided to camp there for a
few days and give the horse time to get
rested, but while getting supper ready
Buchanan said to his partner, more in fun
than in earnest:
"Bert, let's hold up the Mountain
House, steal a fresh horse and skip the
country."
Ansen readily consented and they
talked the matter over for a while and
finally agreed to try It. After dark they
rode up to the hotel, tied their horses and
without changing their appearance en
tered the barroom at the front door.
"I entered first an-l Ansen followed and
immediately covered the crowd with his
snooter and demanded ail hands up, and
you can bet they lost no time in comply
ing with his request," said Buchanan. "I
went directly to the cash drawer behind
the bar, but was unable to get it open.
Then I turned my attention to the men
which Bert still had standing up in aline
with their hands in the air. I went thiough
their pockets and got $21 75, a piece of
tobacco and an old pocket-knife. Just at
this time a young fellow poked his head
in the back door and Bert pointed his gun
at him and said 'Hands up,' but he shut
the door and got out so quick we were
afraid be was going after a gun and we
left. As we was leaving some one at a win
dow fired a shot at us, which went through
my coat.
"From there we went to a farm a few
miles further on and took a horse and
continued on our way to Suiphur Creek,
intending to make our way to the coast;
but the next day we learned the officers
were on our track, so we laid low, and as
we were hid on a mountainside we saw
Sheriff Jones going up the grade. We
then took a cutoff and went to Bartlett
Springs, where we again heard of the of
ficers. Oue, a Like County Sheriff, had
just left tnen, so we continued on our way
until we met some parties from whom we
learned the officers were ahead of us. We
went back to BÂ»rtlett's and back almost
over the same road we had come, hiding
moat of the time during the day and trav
eling at night, and in this way wo made
our way up to Ashland, Or., where we got
work. We had just commenced to think
we were all right when the officers came
and arrested us. We both agreed to keep
mum, but when we iound out what a
strong case Sheriff Jones had cgainst us
and was identified by so many at the pre
liminary examination we decided it was
no use to deny it any longer and so have
told the whole truth.
"Robbing don't pay and a man is fool
ish to run such big chances for so little
gain."

never taken in. It was a fair weather pas
saga throughout, and for live days the
Lancing and Andromeda were in cora

hut on arriving there she was ordered to
I Sydney. Captain fiatiield had not heard
! of Ler arrival and in his letter was con
gratulating himself upon having wo:i out
in the race. His sailing time was ahead
of that of the Andromeda, so that he can

A REMARKABLE CHILD.
Pearl Alden Ladd, a little native daughter, fast 13 years old, will make her
appearance at the California Theater on the 'J4ih inst. in three lines o: art, in
every one of which she is efficient enoush to be cailed an artist. Her specialty is
piunoforic piaymp, but she is also a strikiuely gifted reciter, and cUe dances with
the grace ar.d finish of a professional. The child has a larpe pianoforte repertory,
which she executes with the finish and maturity of an uriulr. Her selections at
her performance will include Liszt'a "Twelfth Hungarian Rhapsody" and the
same composer's difficult transcription of "Rijtoletto," Handel's "Harmonious
Blacksmith," a "Berceusa" by Chonln, Grief's "Norwegian Bridal Procession
March," Mosskowski'a "Yiisa in A Mat major" and a pianoforte and violin sonata
by Beethoven, in which Miss Ladu will be the pianiste and N. Landsberger the
violinist. The child's recitation will consist of the potion scene from "Ilomeo
and Juliet," and she will conclude the recital by giving a characteristic dance.
She already has a number of pupils for the pianoforte, many of whom are adults;
and ax every care is U;inn litvtaheti on her education a bright future seems open
to the California child. The probability is that she will decide to devote herself
to tl,e j ianoforte.

Mayor Plielan's address was heard with
marked attention. Among other things
he said :
"I am pleased to hear from Mr. Sbar

tion, its objects and purposes. It brings
San Francisco in line with all great
modern cities in the matter of the disposal
of uarbiige, which is of very great im
portance from considerations of public
cleanliness and health. He says hid is a
corporation organized to purify the air
and to improve ihe sanitary conditions of
the City, and while accomplishing these
purposes, I am informed by the president
thai during the life of its franchise the
company *vill pay into the public treasury
â  n percentages $5(0,000, which averages
$10,000 per year. If these desirable re-
Milts be obtained it is a matter of con
gratulation ihi-t inasmuch m (he City
itself had not taken the initiative there
were ciiizsns among us enterprising
enoueh 10 provide something which was
bo lone; an<i -o h.iily needed.
"As San Francisco is the metropolis of a.
State famed tor its climate, wni h has at
tracted so many and will continue to at
tract so many more in si-arcti of health, it
becomes a matter of first importance that
San Francisco, of all other citie-, should
be a model, if not a lead r. if the sanitary
improvements ol the age. People siiouid
be able to live in large cities, w.here the
population is great and congested, without
auff- ring in health or comfort.
â¢'I look upon these reduction worKs as
fulfilling ;i great public need, and we must
measure their usefulness not. by what they
pay into the public treasury so much as
by tha s<:cces.-ful ctm-ummaiion of their
ur.rier,.akii]Â£ and the fulfillment of their
expectations. Their plan is to make use
of the refuse., which has previously pone
to waste, making out of it useful articles
which will rind a market, thus not only
opening up now avenues to labor, but add
ing commercial importance to the City it
self. For these reasons we trust that the
now enterprise will meet with the success
which its object- and purposes deserve."

To examine Doctor Cook's testimonial
hies would make the heart of a despond-

"As the lake is a most charming place

own oriein or diacovery, and is the result
of a lifetime of hard work and persistent
study, diligent research, and scientific in-

is purely vegetable in its composition and
perfectly harmless in ils effect. It does
not stimulate temporarily, but restores
permanently. During the past fifteen
months it lias been tes:ed on more than
6000 young, middle-aged and old men,
who, as the result of errors or excesses,
were tortured by the woes of nervous

Although Doctor Cook is an exceedingly
Dusy man, he has no substitutes to repre-
sent him in a, professional capacity. Every
patient who applies at his office for treat-
ment consults Doctor Cook himself, and no
oneelse. He goes thoroughly intoeach indi-
vidual case.and carefully follows it through
every staee until the patient is completely
cured. This ia one among the many
reasons why Doctor Cook always obtains
such happy results.
A large portion of the doctor's treatment
is by mail. He usually desires at least
one personal visit when convenient to the
patient, but his system of home treatment
through correspondence is so nearly per-
fect that satisfactory results are always
assured. To those describing their
troubles he sends iree of charge his new
and valuable book, devoted to nervous

The Greatest Single Casting Ever Made on the Coast Was, as Far as Can Be Told at Present, Successfully Accomplished by the Union Iron Works Yesterday* On

Interest Was Taken in the Work by the Managers and Workmen of the Establishment*

The Immense Piece of Melal to

M .chine-
Daniel O'Neil, foreman raolder of the
Union Iron Works, cast his eye anxiously
over his corps of thirty or thirty-tive ex
pert assistants. Every man was on the
alert and at his post. Froru the huge
caldrons rose tongues cl weird, uncanny,
hungry flame?. From a score of vent
pipes waverine columns of fire consumed
the gas, which had generated in the
bowels of the mold. The supreme mo
ment to which this force of expert work
men had been laboring for months had
arrived.
"Go on," shouted O'Neil, with a wave
of his hand. Two begrimed molders
threw their weights upon the levers that
controlled tne huse lanic which contained
the seething liquid metal. With a dull
roar 1.30,000 pounds of iron went pouring
into the great mold which had been pre
pared for it. Interested workmen timed
the passing of the molten mass as they
might the performance of a favored race
horae.
The last of the yellow stream had
flowed into the great receptacle of iron
and clay. The pas from the vent-pipes
flickered feebly and the workmen relaxed
their tension to heave a sii:b. of relief.
"Two minutes exactly," announced one
of the volunteer timers, "and so far it
couldn't have been nicer."
This casting was one which will be his
torical in the annals of metal working.
Seventy-five tons is a huge amount of
metal for a single cast. Sucnathing has
never before been accomplished on this
coast. In the whole United States there
are but two or three establishments which
would undertake such a problem, and
there are ample reasons why any manu
facturer might hesitate before attempt" !
ing it. â¢ I
The piece which waa yesterday cast is I
for the Union Iron Works' own use. It is i
to be an important Dart of a machine for
the purpose of bending plates to be used
on men-of-war. This machine is caicu
-1 a ted to exert 000 tons of preÃSure atone
time.
The formidable agency in this pressure
which was cast yesterday is 2i feet long,
6 feet wide and 7 feet deep. In its con
s'ruction 150,000 pounds of the best and
hardest iron was used. It is worth to the
works over $10,000, and n Â«ing!e mistake
in its casting miuht have cost thousands
of dollars and months or delay, lhat is
why the men in the rolling- mill awaited
the flow of metal anxiously. Tbat is
why Foreman O'Neil smiled as he de
scended from his commanding position
on top of the frame wherein was con
structed the huge mold.
It is an interesting process, this mold
ing of great masses of metal. It is an
exciting procedure when, as in the present
instance, a mistake of an instant may
mean the loss of months of labor end
thousands of dollars.
For over three months Daniel O'Neil
and his thirty expert raolders have been
preparing the great frame lor the casting.
There were cores and crevices to be
fashioned by deft hands, there were vent
pipes to be arranged for, skillful appliances
for preventing (nibbles must be figured

rlaced upon the frame to prevent tho
tremendous heat from raising tha entire
Structure from the ground.
Yesterday was the time appointed for
the casting. There was no employe of
the wo ks who did not lake a rersonal
interest in the great event. At 10 o'clock
in the morning William Hyland, foreman
of the furnace room, commenced prepar
ing the metal for tho mold. Into the in
fernal heat of the great ret6rts four sturdy
men piled lncrssniit v great chunk* of pig
and scrap iron. There is something terri
fying in the heat of these great furnaces.
It is neither flame nor liquid, but a pale
ghostly blue vapor which wavers nnd
writhes in its giarir.g c 11. Beneath from
each furnace there trickles forth a limpid,
innocent-looking stream of yellow.
As it strikes the bottoms o: the huge
ladles set to receive it there is a shower of
sparks which resembles tho pinwheels

Nation's birthday.
Jus: before the casting yester lay one of
thoso pretty sparks lodged in the clothes
of one of the men. ThTe was a mo
mentary excitement, a rush for a water
barrel, and then the man returned laugh
ing to his work. Hot metal lias little ter
ror for these disciples of Vulcan.
It was just a quarter of 4 when the metal
had all been reduced and everything was
ready for the cast. Just before turning
in the metal a half-iloz>n men rushed
about the frame with lighted torches and
ignited the gas which was escaping from
the vent hoh s of the mold. The.Â«e flaming
jets gave a weird appearance to thf scene,
ami the suppressed excitement of ti;e
spectators and the employes made the
situation as the melal was unleashed
dramatic in the extreme. It was only two
minutes before th c great tank of liquid
iron had been emptied, but for two hours
the workmen kept add ng from a reserve
ladie, all the lime prodding and stirring
the molten mas< with great rods of iron.
It will be nearly two weeks before the
cast has sufliciently cooled to be taken
from its bed of clay. Tben and not till
then will Daniel O'Neil, his employert
and hi* co-laborers feel justified in crow
in?. But as far as could be told yesterday
everything hod been satisfactory. There
had been no hitch in the arrangements.
The ISO.OjO pounds of metal had flowed
into the frame as smoothly as so much
water. If the cast proves a success it will
be a matter of pride to every employe of
the works. If it prove a failu-e â but
every employe is satisfied it will not be a
failure, aod so far their confidence seems
justified.

to be a grand succe-s in every particular.
The day was beautiful lor athletic :
sports and when the hour came for ihe
commencement of the exeicises the grand
stand was packed with handsome young
ladies nnd their escorts. Divers colors
decorated the hats of the spectntors,
representing the colors under which the
athletes contested.
Tha day was remarkable for the lower
ing of college records, and particularly
was this the case in the 12-pound hammer
throwing event, which was won by Smith
of Hoitt's School, who sent the hammer
over 156 ieet 5 inches of sward. Trie
record previous to this performance was
! 133 feet 9 inches.
The other good performance? were the
! lowering of the rumnin>Â» high jump rec
j ord, shot-putting record, 220-yard hurdle
1 record, 440-yard record and relay record.
When the points scored by the cumpst-
I ing colleges were figured up a great cheer
erected the success of the Berkeley High
School boys, who defeated the Oakland
High School representatives by four
points.
Everything was carried out with dis

|Tmrâ¢nmnnmnn^ AND SPRING ARE INSEPARABLE. WHEN
ji |||\^ the blood is filled with the bile of winter,
%<J V-/ M. some remedy is needed to clean the blood,
tzsLSLSisuLsuLSLSL^^ to separate the bile from the blood, to throw
off the bile and leave the blood rich and strong, strong and
rich. The old way of blood-cleaning was to drive the im-
purities of the blood through the skin. This old way caused
pimples, facial sores, skin sores, large red blood blotches, itch-
ing skin, sleepless nights and a "give-away face." Your
neighbors know you are clearing your blood, and they tell
you of it. The new way is the way Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla does its work. No pimples, no sores, no blotches, no
itching skin, no fire skin. The blood is purified and the
bile driven through natural channels. Your bowels are
gradually loosened, so gradually as to cause no uneasiness,
and yet loosened surely. You can't be constipated when you
use Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla brings the roses to your cheeks. Try it to-day.
NOTTE 1 â - N Â° druggist can truthfully say he owns stock in Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla. No ; druggist is connected with the Sarsaparilla Company, look
out for the corner druggist who substitutes, he does it in spite and for profit. He does the
I same with your prescription. When you ask for Joy's get Joy's and get no other.

VAN MAY NEVER
FIGHT AGAIN
The Big Olympian Sufhr
ing From a Bad Case
of Hernia.
Nw Only Twenty Years Od
He Deplores the Uniortunate
Accident.
Van Doesn't Blame Jeffries, but
Thinks He Has a Bad Habit of
Stooping in a Cinch.
"You may never be able to enter the
ring again." These were tbeworCsof a
physician of standing to Van Buskirk, the
stalwart Olympian, who was bested by
Jeffries, the T,os Angeles giant, at the
People's Palace Friday evening.
Van Buskirk is seriously injured. He
Y.ea in bed at the Yoserohe House, but if
complications do not set in he expects to
be on his feet again in a few days.
Dr. Liu<tig, tile National Club physician,
examined him at the ringside inimediate!y
after the contest, and stated that he was
unable to determine whether the man
was seriously injured, but when the ath
lete was taken to his room it was discov
ered that hernia had set in in an aggra
vated form, and Dr. Somers was hastily
summoned.
Lasi night the invalid was surrounded
by a crowd of friends. He lay at ease last
night.
"Yes, J am much better now," he said,
"and in a few days I expect to be about
the streets again. For two months, how
ever, 1 shall De obliged to be very careful.
Then, with good care, I shall, my physi
cian thinks, be all right again.
"But he has cauiioned me against
taking any hard exercise at all for some
time to coa.e. In fact, Ido not improve
ai 1 expect; it may mean the cud of my
ring career.
"I do not believe that Jeffries struck me
where he did intentionally" â Van claims
that he received the blow several inches
lower than the spectators believe he didâ
"but he has a bad habit of stooping v>ry
low in a clinch and doesn't seem to know
just.where he is striking."

THE BURNS STAKE
With the Worst of the
Weights, Bergen Rode
Him to Victory.
Salvation, With Tcp Weight
Up, Made All of the
Running.
Miss R wena Captured the Water
house St, keâ Satsuma Won a
Peculiarly Run Race.
Salvation is a magnificent cripple, and
Rui.'iart, winner of the Burns handicap,
a grand four-year-old. Sucli was the con
clusion arrived at by the big throng esti
mated a l , between GOX) and 7090 people
which assembled at Emeryville track
yesterday to witness the Caiiiornia JocKey
Club's clhjsic event decided.
The rich $10,000 slake has been the talk
of turfdom for tue past week, and perfect
weather and a fast track favored its decis
ion. Taken all in all, the race was one of
the prettiest ever decided in this part of
the country, both from a time standpoint
and for the bitterness with which every
foot of ground was contested. The starters
numbered ten. Talent and owners alike
were all at sea as to the winner.
For some inexplicable reason Cande
laria with 102 pounds ana Thorpe up ruled a
3 to 1 favorite in the betting. Tiien strongly
favored came tbe Boots jair, Installator
and Toe Roman, with 16 to 5 about them.
Trainer Billy Randall pinned his faith on
Salvation, dele aied to carry top weight,
120 pounds, with Shaw to pilot him, and
the Montana contingent gut 8 and 10 to 1
against their money. Ruinart id at 110
pounds lo< ked to have been frowned upon
by tbe handk-apper, but many strung
tneir coin with Many BÂ«rgÂ«n's old-time
prowess lor winning stakes and some Jew
admirers of the brown colt managed to
get aboard at 30 to 1, although 15 and 20
was niucn more plentiful. Wheel of
Fortune, Lobengula and 8c iller all had
iriends. Judge Denny and Argentina
were a drug on the market.
Aiter p trading past the stand the horses
galloped to the post and the start was one
of Mr. Fer^u-on's Happiest efforts, the
field getting away bea itifully aligned.
Contrary to stable aiders Salvation was
leading past the stand, followed by Loben
gula, Judge Denny and Insiailator, with
the others close up. In order to make the
running lnsiahator soon caught up with
Salvation and the pair raced In close com
pany well into the stretch, where the for
mer, having p riormed his duty, fell back,
to iet Iris stable-mate. The Koruan, per
form his part. A furiong from home, with
a lead of two lengths, Salvation looked a
winner, but Shaw grew anxious and was
urging his mount hard.
The Koman now began creeping up,
and at the same time a flash of red,
coming lite a flash, sent a thrill through
the backers of Ruinart. Salvation proved
himself a worthy son of his great sire and
hung on in true racehorse fashion, but
his rider's fooluardiness in asking too
much of him was beginning to teli, and
finy yard* from the wire both Ruinart
and The Roman forged ahead of him.
Bergen was riding In old-time foTm and
got the brown colt vast the judges a neck
in front of the bearer of the black and
white of Eimwood stock farm, Salvation
third, his head at The Roman's flink.
Bergen received a great ovation on his
return to the stand, and when the time
'2:W5^ was hung out, lowering the coast
recoi i one-quarter ot a second, there was
renewed cheerine.
Before being blanketed a floral horse
shoe was placed on the neck of tbe win
ner, and he proudly nodded his approval
of ttie crowd's applause.
Four out of the six favorites sent to the
post returned winners and made all of the
nineteen bookmakers figure up a balance
to the bad at the end of the day.
The other state, the Waterhouse, at four
and a half furlongs for two-year-olds,

brought out but a field of rive. The Burns j
ft Waternouse pair, R> cieation and Miss )
Rowena, were prohibitive 1 to 6 favorites i
and split tbe purse between them. Miss i
Rowena was first past the wire, with her |
stab c ma'e second voder wrap*. Michae!,
Crowded against the rail down the stretch, i
was a good third.
Tlie opening event was a six furlone
scramble with ten snrinters lining up at .
the barner. Major Cook, ridden by
Thorpe, was an 8 to 5 favorite, but was cut
off at the start and ended up fourth. The
600 to 1 shot. Senator Mahoney, led until
well into the stretch, where Masoero took
the lead and won hard ridden, less than a
length before Kowaisky, the second i
choice. The winner was 8 to 1 in the
betting.
1 he next event decided, a six ar.d a half
furlong spin, was one of the familiar Burns
t t Waterhouse ''gift" affairs. The condi
tions permitted of Parthemax tumbling in j
with a band of cattle, and, outclassing his ;
fie'd shoes to plates, made a romp of the
thing, winning ir. a romp from Rienzi, a
60 to 1 shot. The winner was backeJ from
evens down to 3to 5. Horatio away poor- |
ly took third place.
Old Yemen was a pronounced G to 5 fa
vorite for the six-furlon â¢ celling run that
followed, and getting away to a fli'ine j
start led his company from the jump, J
finishing a leng;h in advance of the 15 to .
1 shot, Manchester, ridden by Charley
Thorpe. Howard was a good third.
The final waÂ« a mile race, with Satsuma,
Vinctor, imp. Trance and Preston as I
starters. Satsuma an I Preston bo h went j
to the post 13 to 10. Each one of the b)i*s
seemed to hayÂ« waiting orders and the !
bunch wajked the first half in :57. Thorpe j
cut loose with Satsuma when the siretch j
was reached and In a drive downed Vioc
tor half a length, fa 1:47. Itup. Trance, a \
100 to 1 shot, beat Preston for the place.

Slaughter again managed to put up a ;
bungling ride astride Kowaisky.
Some few days ago Fr.ink Brown gave t
California a very substantial boost in a
selling race which the filly won at Ingle- J
side. Yesterday Brown's sprinter Yemen !
look a selling sprint, at the conclusion of â

bid the old horse up to $800. securing him. ,
Ruinart is trained by Vrea Merckel, a
rising young California horseman, and the I
brown cot's condition yesterday attests
of his ability. The owner nt Ruinart pre
seated Merckel with $1000 as well as j
recompensing Marty Bergen in the same ,
amount.
Shaw was given orders to wait in third
or fourth position with Salvation until
the stretch was reached anl then make
his ride. When 'boys get astride a good
horse the caliber 01 the son of Salvator
they are apt to set rattled and think they

probably the case with Shaw. When th-
fractional lime is glanced over it will he

Bullet From a Parlor

Joseph Herzel, a cabinet-maker, 54
years of age, living at 10 Turk street, was
taken ;o the Receiving Hospital last night
in a dying condition.
Yesterday afternoon Herizel got a par

age, who lives in the same house, wpnt
into Herizel's room ami Henzei showed
ncr the parlor rrle.
Not knowing that it was loaded Herizel
stood away from :er an 1 laughingly toll
her to shoot. The girl at first objected,
but tinally raised the rifle and tired.
Herizel dropped with a srroan and the girl
ran screaming lroni the room. The parlor
ritie was loaded and the bullet struck
Herizol in the right eye, penetrating the
brain.
The patrol wagon was summoned and
Herizel was taken to the Receiving Hos

them that nothing would be more out of
place than demonstrations, either of ap
proval or disapproval, on account of any
thing that should be done in this case.
These remarks by his Honor were re
ceived in silence and the admonition was
well heeded.
Amor.j those present were ex- Judge
Murphy, "-Lucky" E. J. Baldwin, Chief of
Police Lees, Assistant District Attorney
riosmer, County Clerk Curry, a great
many lawyers and quite a number of
women.
Mr. Durrant, father of the prisoner, sat
chatting with his son during the wait that
ensued after the court was called to order.
Mr. Deuprey arose and in gentle tones
asked for a delay of a few minutes until
an affidavit that was in course of prepara
tion could be presented for the court's
consideration. Thi* request was granted
as a matter of courtesy, and the three
Jndees on the bench exchanged common
places about t tie weather and the latest
news of the war in Crete, until the paper
lor which Mr. Deuprey was waiting was
handed in.
Durrant took the document, looked it
over and dipping a pen in an inkwell be
fore him deliberately signed his name.
Then he arose and raised his hand to
heaven while Deputy County Clerk Corey
administered tne oath. As the words "So
help you God" were uttered Durrani
gravely nodded, his lips moved, but he
made no audible sound.
Immediately Judge Bahrs ordered Dur
rant to stand up, and as hÂ« arose Mr.
DeuDrey took a position by his side, but
shortly afterward resumed his seat, while
Judge Bahrs addressed the prisoner in
these words:
"William Henry Theodore Dnrrant. you

suance of an order made by me, upon lhe

judgment and the order denying you a
new trial were affirmed by said Supreme
Court.
"Said judgment still remaining in full
force, tile Jaw requires me now to inquire
into the fucts. 10 determine if any icjral
reason or reasons exist against the execu
tion of tlie judgment of death heretofore
pronounced against you.
"Tbereiore, William Henry Theodore
Durrant. I now ask you to state any leeal
reason you may have why the court
should not proceed to make an order
directing the Sheriff of ttie City and
County of San Francisco to deliver you to
the warden of a State prison, and further
directing said warden to execute, at a time
now to be fixed by me, the judgment ot
death heretolore trotiounoed against you."
Instantly Mr. D-mprey came to the res
cue of the prisoner, and said: "Your
Honor, we asK for a reasonable continu-
I ance on account of ttie considerations of,
the facts and the law involved herein, and
I ask permission to read the affidavit on
which I base this application."
Judge B.ihrs graciously inclined his
head and Mr. Deuprey read the affidavit
that Dirrant had just signed, which was
to the effect that Attorney John H. Dick
inson :icted an leading counsel for the de
fense during the trial ; that Mr. Dickinson
is abÂ«ent from the City and that it would
greatly jeopardize the prisoner's legal
riehts if the matter of passing sentence
should be proceeded with during Mr.
Dickinson's absence. The affidavit con
cluded with a statement that Mr. Dickin
son would return in a week and that he
asked for a continuance of all proceedings
until the 17th inst.
After concluding the reading of the affi
davit Mr. Deuprey said: "Your Honor,
I have had no opportunity to consult with
General Dickinson since thÂ« last decision
by the Supreme Court touching this case
was handed down. This is the first time
that the defendant, Durrant, has been
called on to appear in this court since
the receipt of the remittitur from the Su
premo tribunal. That was only a week
ago. I submit that the importance of
this case may be properly urged as a rea
son for a bri f delay.
"It may be suggested by your Honor
that the" presence of one of defendant's
counsel may suffice at this time, vet I beg
you to bear in mind that Mr. Dickinson
wss in attendance during the trial a
greater part of the time than I was, and
that he is more familiar with all the par
ticulars ot the proceedings than anyjother
person. 1 do not a-ik anything unre'ason
ahle; 1 simply request that the matter go
over for one v.-eok, in order that there may
be proper and just arrangements for the
preservation of the defendant's legal
rights. In asking for this onef postpone
ment I appeal to the great discretion of
this court, in the name of humanity and
justice."
District Attorney W. 8. Barnes made a
short reply. He said that notices of yes
terday's proposed proceedings had been
served on Mr. Deuprey and Mr. Dickin
son, although there was no statute requir
ing that service, and that Mr. D.ckin^on
had subsequently said he knew of the day
set for passing sentence.
â¢'I know of no man more competent
ihnn Mr. Deuprey to represent the d-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 11, 1897.
fendant at this proceeding," continued
Mr. Barnes. 'While I wou;d be the last
man to urge the court to proceed with
undue basic, yet I feel it my duty to in
sist that there shall be no further delay in
proceeding with the cause at bar."
Jlr. Deuprey persisted. He said he was
not asking anything extraordinary. This
was a matter where a man's liie was at
stake. That man was entitled in law and
justice to the assistance of his counsel at
every stage of tne proceedings. Here it
was proposed to deprive him of that ad
vantage Dy hurrying the passing of sen
tence. The delay of a week was most
reasonable. The rights of the prosecution
would not be impaired and the defendant
wouid be given but a fair chance to make
the best defense that is allowed to him
under the law.
'As I understand the law," said Judge
Bahrs. "the defendant has exhausted all
the remedies that are known to our juris
prudence. In my judgment the showing
made is not fmfficjmt and I cannot grant
a continuance."
Still Mr. Deuprey continued to argue.
He said he thought he was entitled to an
opportunily to show to Judge Emirs that
the judgment pronounced by e.x-Judge
Murphy in this case was not a judgment
th;itany court bad Â» right to make. Under
section 190 of the Penal Code the court
tiad authority to pass sentence that the
defendant should suffer death or impris
onment in the State prison, but that the
pretended judgment rendered by the trial
court, the original judgment on which
judgment is now proposed to be pro
nounced, attempted to inflict the punish
ment of both imprisonment and execu
tion. Ti:e jury that returned the vervlict
had a right to inflict either imprisonment
or death, but the court had no authority
to add to that verdict, which prescribed
death, and inflict on the delendant lhe
additional indignity of the stripes of a
felon's garb.
There was no authority, Mr. Deuprey
insisted, for the addition which the trial
court had made to the verdict of the j^ry
that the defendant should be closely con
fined in the Sta;e prison, because there
was no warrant in law for any such order.
It was an intrenchment on the duties of
the Sheriff and the Warden of the State
prison. The court had attempted to legis
late, and m> had issued a double judgment,
which in fact vitiated the act altogether.
For that reason the pretended judgment
signed by Judge Murphy was no judgment
in law and in fact, and on t .at pretended
judgment no judgment can now, or at
any time, be pronounced. Tha verdict of
the jury may possibly stand, but on that
verdict the proceeding of the court must
be bused. The Judge had no right to legis
late and add to the punishment that the
verdict directed should be inflicted.
Judge Buhrs asked: "has not that
judgment been sustained by the Supremo
Court?"
Mr. Deuprey replied tbnt the judgment
had been sustained only as to the pro
cedure in the of.se during trial, but not as
to the doubie sentei.ee as uttered by the
trial court. The double penalty had
vitiated the judgment and it must fall.
Ju'.iee Baurs overruled Mr. D^uprey's
objections and said: "Theodore Durrani,
sti<n<l up."
As the prisoner did so Mr. Deuprey in
terposed another objection. He said that
the facts of the case had not been inquired
into by the court or any officer of the
court as contemplated and required by
the law.
This oojection was overruled and Mr.
Deiiprey, having asked the clerk to enter
the dt-ietidant's exception to ttie rulings
of the (ourt in all the matters submitted,
took his spat, while Judge Baiirs pro
nounced sentence on the doomed man
and fixed the day of execution, as previ
ously set forth in these columns.
Quick as a flash Mr. Deut rey was on his
fret. He saw ttiat Judjie Bahrs had fol
lowed exactly the words use ! by ex-Juage
Murphy in pa-sing sentence, thus pro
viding for what he termed a double pun
ishment, and he moved to strike out all
that part of the judgment which related
to close confinement m the State prison.
He pointed out that this was a great
punishment than was authorized by th*
verdict and the law, ana that therefore it
wou.'d vitiate the order of the court.
Judge Bahrn ajwiti disagreed aud denied
the motion to strike out.
"We ask that the execution of that part
of the judgment in relation to the defend
ant's removal to San (>nentin be staid for
three days," said Mr. J)euprey.
"I can't grant it," said the Judge.
"1 now give notice of appeal from this
order and serve notice on the District At
tornoy. We respectfully ask your Honor
for a stay of four hours to present my peti
tion for writ of probable cause," said Mr.
Deuprev.
Judge Batirs shook his bead slowly and
said "No."
"But 1 understand your Honor to order
tbat tliu removal of the defendant should
take place within ten days, and I supposed
you would be willing to eive him an op
portunity to preserve his legal rignts,"
pursued Mr. Deuprey.
"I have made the order in this case and
don't propose to change it." was the clos
ing remark by Judge Bahrs, as he in
formed the clerk that court was an journed.
Bailiffs Rock ana Whelan devoted the
next ten minutes to dispersing the crowd
in the courtroom. 'J he people iseenied
fascinated by the spectacle of a fellow hu
man standing within the shadow of the
gallows, aim it was with difficulty that
they could be induced to budge. Men and
women climbid on top ot chairs and
benches and palled and hauleJ wildly in
their efforts to get n nearer view of the
man who for the second lime had been
condemned to expiate on the eibbet the
cnme for which l,e stands convic cd.
As for Durrant, he was the coolest per
son in the room. He showed no emotion
in his countenance. There w;is not the
shadow of feeling on any of the lines of
his sphinx-like face. If his heart beat

faster cr slower there was no mark of
that fact in his deportment. His hands
did not shake with excitement and i is
eyes gave back to those who addressed
him the same steady caze that is po :a
-miliar to those who have been associated
with him since as well a-> before his
arrest. His graÂ«p was cordial tnd his
bearing was courteous to tho c with whom
he engaged in conversation. When fie
spoke his voice betrayed no tension. It
was low and well modulated, though he
had few words to bestow on any except
l:is father and Mr. Denprey, his attorney.
Not a few of Durrant's former acquaint
ances pressed lorwnrd to offer brief sug
gestions of hope or consolation. There
was the suggestion of a smile on bis lips
as he accepted these greetings.
"I have not lost hope, but I do not care
to talk of my case and my plans just at
this time," he >aid.
For nearly a quarter of an hour Durrant
chatted uncr>ncerniÂ»dlv with those around
him. Then Sheriff Whelan touched the
murderer of Blanche Lamont on the
shoulder and, surrounded by a dozen
Deputy Sheriffs and a half dozen police
men, \he prisoner was conveyed through
the corridor? of the new City Hail to the
Sheriff's ollice.
IN THE SHERIFF' 3 OFFICE.
Durrant Talked to His Father and
Jumped Lightly Into the Van
When Leaving:.
Durrant spent the period between the
time be left the courtroom and the hour
iie started for iba ferry in the record-room
of Sheriff Wnelan's office, where he was
watched by Chief Jaiier Battler and Depu
ty Usher.
This is the room where he baa spent
many hours whiles waiting for court to
convene or for the van to convey him
i>. i'K to t lie jail, and he sat in nis accus
tomed chair while chutting in low tones
with his father.
When he was told that the van was
ready to take him to the ferry be nodded
to the deputies as he passed out and
jumped lightly into the somber vehicle.
Sheriff Whelan breathed a deep sigh of
relief when the van rolled out of sight,
and a still deeper one when nn hour and a
half later a telephone message came from
San Quentin that Durrant was safe within
the prison walls and had bsen formally
turned over to the State prison authori
ties. The Sheriff was heartily glad to
wash his hands of so important a prisoner.
A PLAY FOR TIME.

While Durrant was in thÂ« Sheriff's of
fice Deuprey and his assistant, Frank E.

three days. The court assembled in bank

Do you know the cause of your failing health and power? - You are paying na-
ture's debts. The indiscreet solitary practices of youth or the excess of later years
have so weakened you that there is a constant drain upon your system going on â a
drain that is sapping your vitality and stealing from you daily that which is the very
essence of your life. If you allow these drains to continue unchecked, they will
slowly but surely undermine and destroy your health, strength and manly power.
The sturdiest constitution is not proof against these unnatural looses of vital fluids,
and unless you give back to the body that which it wastes, it is only a question of
time when you will become a physical and mental wreck. With shattered nerves
and with a weakened and worn-out bodv, life will prove a failure, and you will soon
till a premature grave, or, worse still, an insane asylum will be your lot. That this
is the sad fate of many who fail to heed nature's warning is demonstrated by a
perusal of the death records and the records of insane asylum;.
You have only yourself to b'amo if you find yourself drifting in this direction
and don't take steps to be cured. There is a doctor, the most famous specialist in the
world in the treatment of this class of ailments, who can restore to you perfect phy-
sical, mental and manly strength and vigor.
This truly great physician has made a life-long study of diseases of this character.
His method of treatment is a purely scientific one, original with him. He has treated
thousands of sufferers throughout the land, and has never failed to effect a cure. He
is constantly in receipt of an avalanche of testimonials from people of all classes and
stations in life, who express profound gratitude for the wonderful cures wrought by
him. If you are wise, if you desire to regain your health and become well and strong
again, consult tois king among doctors without delay.

An arrangement was mada with Sheriff
Whelan whereby lie was to bold the vatt
at the ferry until he got word whether or
not the Supreme Court would deny ihe
petition. Webb proceeded to the ferry
pending Denpiey's argument before the
court and was mere telephoned the un

AT THE FERRY.
A Close Guard Kept Over the Prls-
oner While Transferring Him
to the Boat.
Captain Dunleavy, Sergeants Mahoney
and Avon and a squad of twenty water
lront police were in attendance when the
van containing the murderer hove in
sight. They formed a circle around the
vehicle and marched aboard'the Tiburon
with him. No time was wasiei in mak
ing the transfer, and in a few minutes
every entrance to the steamer was guarded,
and only the reeular passengers were al
lowed on boan the vessel.
The murderer was downcast as he was
marched aboard the steamer. He seemed
!or the first time to thoroughly realize his
desperate condition, and he Dune his
head. His fattier did his best to buoy the
lad up, but his efforts were unavailing.
When Durrant left the prisoner's van,
there was a moment of suppressed excite
ment. The police were on tne alert, but
had a word been spoken or a hand
raised against the prisoner, it is
possible that a Ivnching would have
been attempted. The prisoner seemed to
realize tho state of affairs, and he kept
close to the side of Captain Dunleavy
during the march from the van to the
ship.

i He went to his cell unaccompanied over |
I nny part of the distance by any friend,
\Over 1000 convicts watched mm silently
â¢with an intensity of interest strikingly
apparent. He walked not jauntily nor j

than has ever characterized him since he j
was first brought into San Francisco a \
prisoner for murder.
Durrant's lather crossed the bay with
him on the ferry-boat Tiburon and went j
with him as far as the gateway to the arch
of masonry which leads from freedom to j
imprisonment. Probably the lather ]
thought that he would be allowed to en- ,
ter the prison with ais son. But the in- \
exorable prison rule kepi him out and j
kept others out who desired to enter. So |
Durrant pere did not bid his son adieu on j

party none seemed as cool as Durrant.

afflicted with severe rheumatism also. The doctors had tried to cure me without

found out since my nervousness and paint arc permanently cured, as I have had no
return of the trouble; This astonished me as well as my friends, but it is truly so as
I am willing and crlad to testify. Every one knows me in Sacramento. 1 hove

No man can appreciate the dep'h of this subject who does not study it. No one
knows wherein he is weak unless he compares his condition with another; no one
knows the means of curing unless some one tells him. Five hundred grateful men
describe their cure by Dr. San Jen's Electric Belt for your benefit in the little b ok,

honest statements from men who have laid aside all scruples of delicacy to tell their

not flustered. His nerves were not shaken.
He was cooler than tome who Had official
contact witb him.
At one end of the boat, on the lower
deck, there is a small office used by Col
lector Charles Hveernan. Just outside of
this there are folding partitions of wood,
which had been made into a temporary
room ol tmall size. Durrant was taken
lir-st into this outer room. As be entered,
his glance sought all parts of his sur
roundings. By singular mute irony,
over his head was a cluÃter of life-pre
servers.
Around this room fathered a group of
spectators. In a few minutes Durrant
was taken into Collector Hevernan's office.
Therein he crossed the oav, with Messrs.
Sitiier ana Uiher and his father. As
they crossed tue bay Theodore and his
father talked about the weather and in
oifferent subjects in an < rdinary tone of
voice and wun as much seeming intereht
as people ordinarily manliest upon a
casual tneetincr.
W hen Ti Duron was reached the officers
waited until all other passengers were
ashore. Some lingered on the pier, but
most look their places in th.c car-. Dur
rant and his custodian found seats in the
smoker of the San Quentin train close 10
the door. Back of them and across the
aisle from them were a half score of news
paper writers â women and men â and art
ists. Durrant's father occupied a seat
near his doomed son. Between them set
D.-r>uty Usher. Several times Durraut
and his fattier leaned over and exchanged
remarks. The father carried a parcel
roiled up in paper. This parcel was one
of the mysteries of the day. Durrant i-jr.
curried it to bun Quentin, to the gale oi.
tne prison, and brought it back to San
' Francisco unopened.
The train did not atop until it reached
I Greenbrae, the tan Quentin Prison sta
! tion. There was only one stage waiting.
| Durrant and Messrs. Sattler ana Usher
' were among the last to leave the car.
| When tbey reached the stag* it was al
j ready full. The situation was singular.
! Durrant, who was the person principally
. concerned, was likely to be lelt behind
with his custodians. Here was an unex-
I pected stay of proceedings within actual
sight of tne prison wall".
'â¢Never mind," said the driver, prepar
ing to drive away, "there will be another
stage down in fifteen minutes."
Several who had seats in the stage
speedily relinquished them and Durrant
got in. The sia^e was overcrowded. The
steps and seals were ail occupied. Dur
rnnt, his father, his custodians, the repre
sentatives of the press and others who
were poing to San Quentin as visitors were
all huddled and crowded together. But a
sharp watch on Durrant was maintained,
as it had been from tne start.
People living in cottages along the roa 1
came out to 9tare at Durrant us :ie passed
by. OnÂ« woman held up her little boy in
her arms. Durrani's father looked at this
: child and at It is own boy, but made no
visible sign.
Durrant's entrance to the prison was
witnessed by all the officer- of the prison
who were not engaged about the grounds,
, and by several trusties in stripes. The
i outer gate was opened from within, and

throuph and the doors clanged behind
him. The officer at the gate did not know
Du:ra!it's father, and hardiy cast a glance
at him. gtill the resemblance between
the two ruen â father and son â never has
seemed m&re marked. Durrani had gulped
down his pent-up emotion once or twice
before he reached the gate, and as the
stagj had drawn ne.ir to the prison his
lips had twitched, but he bore up. But
now, wlien be bad pasted nearly through
the arched pa?sÂ»g;s lta. lin^j to the inner
pr.son yard and was close to the last of
the two heavy iron gates', his strength for
a moment seemed to forsake him. and he
Wus apparently near fainting. He stag
gered toward the iron gate and against, it,
but recovered himself wi.h an exercise ot
will. He was very pale, but made no
sound.
A second later and be vtrns in the large
flower ijr.rac-n-, which rill in with color
and fragrance a space which is surrounded
by frowning prison walls, lie was con
ducted along a eravel walk to # Cap'.ain
Edgar's office. There the official repre
sentatives of San Francisco .with whom
he had been acquainted bade him "good
by. 11 , â¢ r ".'â : 'â¢- 'â " â â  V,
"Good-by, Durrant." said Mr. Sattjc'r,
extending his timid.
"Good-ny, Mr. Sattjer," responded Dur
rant. Then he paused only a second and
said to the jailer.who was 'about to de
pat t: "Tell papa to kiss mamma for me."
His hands trembled and his nerves were
all on tension; his face white and drawn
with the keen excitement under which he
visibly labored. I. his eyes ware dimmed
no tears fell.
"Good-by, Durrant," said Deputy Usher,
in turn, extending his hand. '"Hope for
the best."
Durj-aut mechanically reached for the
extended hand of the oilier, dvi he could
only say "good-by."
Tbis additional reminder of his situa
tion being Dast, Durrant seemed !o rally
his scirits again. He appeared to Captain
Edgp.r to be cuol and collected. By the
direction of Captain EÂ«l tar, who attended
him, accompanied by Daniel Sullivan, a
j-'uard, be was first taken to the clothing
room, whsre his person was thoroughly
searched. He wae then photographed in
the clothes wnich he wore into the prison.
He was then stripped and given a bath
and ordered to put on the stripes. Nexi
he was taken to the baruer--hop, where
his hair won cropped and his face hhaven
clean. Then once more he was photo
j graphed in his chanced attire and appear
ance. Without delay he was escorteu to
his cell.
This cell is on the second flcor of what
is known a* the stone bunding, one of the
older structures n; (jiieutiu. It is ot
solid masonry and has oniy enough area
to give room lor an iron b d*tead and a
chair, with a very fern- square :>et lor Dur
rant to walk about, 'i'neie is a lattice in
the top of the door which faces towar s
the north and directly opposite Captain
Edgar's cilice. The only JiÂ«ut in the cell
comes in through this lattice. The tier of
calls is known as the *entencÂ«>l murder
ers' row. Durrant's cell is nurrbered 21
and in the third from the end of the row.
On one Â»ide of Durrant, therefore, as
neighbors last night, were Dennis Mo-
Carihy, sentenced to death from Sonoma
County, and F. C. KJoss, sentenced to
death from fcan Francisco. On the other
side Durrant had as neighbors In three
adjoining cells Henry Allender from
baiita Ciara County, John Al tiler from San
Francisco ana Louis C. Seacy liom San
ik-rnardino. over ali of whom id the sen
tence of dentil.
Durrant gave no further token of weak
ness He entered the cell watched by a
crowd of prisoners who were paihir<>a" in
i he yard, the rule being to qu.t work at
2:' M o'clock Salurdar afternoons, lie said

ended his appearance lor the day in pub

with some chances to exercise in the yard,
mil -S3 something intervened, until he
shall be removed, near the time- at for his
exi-cuiion, when he will be tuken to the
condemned csll on the fourth floor of the
bit: brick building, where the death watch
w:li be placed uuon him. In the interim
care will be taken to prevent him from

Nevertheless ho will nave a lamp in h s

Warden Hale was not at San Quentin
yesterday aiturnoun. Cap lain Burling was
in charge o! the outer prison in his i
absence. He was under instruction to
penaii no one to see Durruat afier the
pn-oner passed ihroutrh the iron paies. |
He carried out these instructions fully,
and evm Durrani's fattier went away i
without seeing him a^ain.

minute. All the afternoon, with tbis
exception, Mr. Durrant was telf-contained,
smoJting cigars incessantly. >Vhen he
spoke once to the newspaper writers and
artists, bis voice was bitter.
"Perhaps," he said, addressing an artist,
"you had better send me one of the pic
tures you burs made. But I suppose they
belong to all tiie newspapers and they
must have tiieno foftheir circus. Theodora
is innocent. He hÂ«s been convicted by
the newspapers. There are thousands
who think Â«o, ami I know it; for 1 have
received many letters. If I would toil
what 1 know the affair would appear dif
ferent."
"This would be a eooi time to tell your
story," said an auditor.

by conveying a denial. He Â«poke no
more, but resumed puffing his tuar.
THE NEW APPEAL.
Attorney Deuprev's Ground for
Atain Going Before the
Supreme Court.
Eugene N. Deuprey made a gallant fight
for h s client from nrst to last, and if Dur
rant ihall ever be hanged it will be only
after every expedient known to the law
snail hare been invoked in vain in behalf
of the doomed man.
Mr. Deuprey, in an interview ljÂ»Â»t night,
suid that he had appealed to the Supreme
Court on the ground that the court did
not, in accordance with the provisions of
section 1387 ot the Penal Code as amended
in 1881, taKe any proof as to the facts;
that is to say, as to the record upon which
10 base a judgment such as was made and
entered up yesterday.
"In other words," said Mr. Deuprey,
'â¢there is no record of the couit having
inquired as to the facts of the r cord, and
we contend also that the judgment pro
nounced by Judge Bahrs to-day i.Â« in
excess of the jurisdiction of the court as
providrd by tne sai'.ue, and that ihe
court erred in refusing to grant the appli
cation made by tbe defendant and appel
lant to correct the record in accordance
with the provisions ol the law and in
accordance with the plain provisions oi
the statute.
"As Durrani was being taken to the boat
we made application for a certificate of
probable cause. ' We bad only one our in
which to prepare it. between 11:30 a.m.
and 12:30 p. M., and- after the paper had
been piepared it had to be read and sworn
to by the defendant. Then we submitted
it to lour Justices of the Supreme Court,
but because we were unable to Jay before
em ttie verbatim language of Judge
Baiira the court was unable at that time
either to deny or to gram the application.
The affidavit set forth all that occurred
to-day; tne only thing wanting was the
verbatim language of the order, whicti
had not then been written and wnich we
could not get.
"The appeal stays the execution, bat it
does not stay the imprisonment. The
judgment of imprisonment rendered by
Judge Babrs makes Durrant a convict for
a crime wuteii lias nut been punished by
life imprisonment or any imprisonment at
all. We contend that it is a douo.e judg
ment, and the law does not allow a double
judgment. It must be a death sentence or
a sentence of imprisonment. It cannot
be both. They will takÂ»* Durrani over to
tlie State Prison at San Quentin and they
will shave his head and put him in prison
garb.
"As I understand it he' is there for sixty
days' imprisonment as a felon in tue State
penitentiary, over and above, and in addi
tion to the sentence of death, the
court has no power to inflict it as a pen
alty. Ii he is to go to San Quontin at all
lie is to go tliero for the purpose of being
executed, or within ten days or that time.
"The j;idt:nient is thai he shall be
â  <>=â .â¢ 1 v confined and imprisoned. I can
not understand why they go out uf the
way to do such- things in this case. If
they knew Durrant a* well as I do this
prejudice would not have existed against
him." 1^ b

An old man and his wife were observed
about 10 o'clock last night depositing a
baby on the steps at the entrance to the

rushed out. ;>â¢;.
The baby, which is a pirl about a week !
old, was se.nt to the Receiving Hospital
and placed in charge of in- matron.
On a card pinned to the baby's dress
was written "Zella Fay," which is pre
suranbly the baby's name. It was nicely
dressed, and is a tine, nealthy girl.
A note was also found underneath the
dress, reading as follows:
I will write a few lines to tell you my little
one's narceâ Zella Fay. Please be Kinn to dear
little Zella. From Hep. Lonely Mother.
The old man and his wife were taken
\ before Captain W.ttman, and in answer
to questions he .-aid his name was H. M.

a rancher in Cloverdale.
. 'â I was told by Dr. Markel of Clover
dale," he said "to take the baby to the
City and leave it at 218 McAllister street,
which the doctor said was a home for
foundlings. My wife and I came to the
City to-night and were carrying out the
doctor's instructions when we were ar
rested."

FROM HER HOME
TO A MADHOUSE
Remarkable Career of Liz
zie Silva, Now in
' a Hospital.
After Being Sent to Stockton Dr.
Clark Declared That She
Is Quite Sane.
Her Father, Who Is a Rancher, Threat
ened to Kill H r, and th Young
Schoolgir. Ran Away.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, April 10. )
A little girl, not yet 15 years of age, who
wears short dresses and who until recently
was a regular attendant at the public
school near Dimond Canyon, is seriously
ill at the City and County Hospital, San
Francisco. The circumstances lead ins up
to her misery are as remarkable as any
ever experienced t>y a girl of her age.
Within the past two weeks her father '
has threatened to kill her; she has been
confined in the Oakland City Prison; aha
1 has been examined as to her sanity and
sent to Stockton asylum; she has been
discharged from, there on Dr. Clark's
certificate that her mind never was af
fected; she has been committed to the
Magdalen Asylum in San Francisco, al
though there are many of her acquaint
ances who believe she is the victim of
false representations; and now she is in
a hospital.
.Lizzie Silva, the young girl in question,
is the daughter of a rancher living in a
little house beyond Dimond Canyon. Her
father has been in this country forty-one
years, and has resided in his present
abode just a quarter of a century. He can
neither read nor. write, and he said to-day
I that he bad only been six times to San
' Francises in all these years, and had never
been' farther from his "home than Hay
wards. He is very set in his opinions,
: and has very rigid ideas of moral-'. When
I informed a few weeks ago that his daugh-
I ter had been" misbehaving lie was so
! angry that he threatened to kill her, and
. when told that h.s threats rendered him
! liable to prosecution he did no: deny
them, but promised to protect his daugh
ter.
Lizzie's father, on account of her con
duct, could not bear her near him, and it
was d"C ded to send her to her bister in
Sacramento. The arrangements were
made by her brother-. who has
taken a great interest in the nil, and to
whom Her father has shown a willingness
to entrust the affairs that properly belong
to the girl's parents.-
Frightened by her father's threats, the
j young girl one morning was missing. It
: was presumed that she had left home to
! join her sister in Sacramento. This theory
"proved to be correct, for she was found on
the train, from winch she was taken and
sent to the City Prison. Her family was
notified, and her brother-in-law, Reich
i art, procured apartments for her in this
i City, where she stayed with her sister for
i a few days.
To the surprise of her friends, little
! Lizzie was then taken to court and de
j clared insane, partly on the testimony of
j her sister. She was then committed to
I Stockton. A short timÂ« later Dr. dark
: wrote to her family informing them that
j he had carefully examined the girl, and
I that there was nothing whatever wrong
| with her mentally. He further stated
that she could not be kept at the asylum,
and he would send her home. As she
could not be kept In the asylum, it was
decided to put her in a reformatory, and
she was on the testimony of relatives and
others sent to the Magdalen Asylum,
i where she Became so ill that it was neces
| sary to remove her to the County Hos
pital, where she now languishes. After
all her sufferings, mental and physical, all

parties concerned have concluded that in
the first place she should have bee â  paced
in the care of Mrs. Prescott of the Oak

all her unhapplness might have been
avoided.
THE KLEUPFER CASE.
Why Hi. Relative* Believe the Double
Murderer Win Insane.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 10.â Henry J.
Kleupfer, a resident of this city, and a
nephew of C. F. KleuDfer, who committed
suicide in jail at Stockton while awaiting
trial on the charge of murdering two
men nt New Hope last month, tells a dif
ferent story from that given in ;hedi-
paiches about the dead man's disposition
of Ins estate and ins arrangement with his
attorneys. He says:
The facts sre these: Four days before he
took his life my uncle gave the check to biÂ»
brother, saying, 'â¢J'liis is for you, and alt I
want to do is to make a fair settlement with
bw:nnerton."
Now, then, it seems to me that the attorney
ought to be satisfied. I was present when he
was pMid $300 for a fee to attend the case o;
my untieâ not as t retainer, but for the ca6e,
and $300 is a whole lot of money in trese
dais. And what did he do? AH he did was
to attend the preliminary examination.
1 notice, also, that Bwinnerton ewore before
Judge Budd that as far as known the deceased
had no relatives living in this State, and for
that reason had the Public Administrator
taken charge of the estate. This statement
was made In the face of the knowledge that he

had a brother in this Cityâ my fatherâ besides
the brother ironi Idaho Ci;y and four nephews
an<l four nieces in tnis City.
I am convinced that my uncle was out of his
mind when he committed suicide. I \ras in
Stockton on last Monday night, and we had
made arrangements to meet him on the fol
lowiug morning to go into court for the ex
amination.
He said to me then: "Henry, the newspap
ers and everybody say I Killed two men. 1
don't know anything about it and nothing can
make me bslieve it. I don't remember any
thing about such an affair." The next mom
lne he was found dead.

SMITH NOT DISMISSED
Lively Trial of the Charges
Made by Fire Chief
Fair.
Twenty Days' Suspension Is the S n5
tence for Not Preserving a
Discrret Silence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9<><S Broadway, April 10. )
The trouble in the Fire Department is
over for the present. There was a trial
this morning and tbe suspended engineer,
W. B. Smith, failed to impress the Com
missioners with the truth of the charges
about Chic; Fair that lie told to an even
ing newspaper reporter two weeks ago.
Engineer Smith could not prove to the
satisfaction of tbe board that Cbief Fair
had spent one niglit tending bar in a San
Francisco saloon when he should have
been ou duty in the Oakland Fire Depart
ment; neither was he able to substantiate
the other charge that Chief Fair, who is
tar from being a homely man, had been
guilty of flirting when driving around in
his little red buggy.
When the Commissioners bad read the
complaint of Cnief Fair, nsking for the
dismissal of Smith, the newspaper article
that hai caused all the trouble was intro
duced in evidence. It sounded very differ
ently when read by Secretary Thomas
from what it did when told by the un
lucky enginner to the newspaper men.
Alter the reading of the article the man
who bad been the innocent cause of all
the rumpus was called to the witness
stand. This was George F. Uatton, and
he to.d trie story of how * friend ou Broad
way stopped mm and told him mere wus
a falling out between Chief Fair and En
gineer Smith. Haiton stated further that
tie called on Srnitn a*, the engine-house,
and the engineer told him every thing that
be published.
Chiof Fair took a hand at cross-examin
ing Mr. Hatton. The Chief is evidently
new to newspaper work, for after Mr. Hat
ton had staled tbat the story as published
was exactly the Earue as his copy he sug
gested to the witne-s that he meant tue
printed article wav a copy of wcat was
written, and Mr. Htitton suavely said y -s.
Attorney Nusbaumer made a neat little
appeal to the board and stated that Chief
Fair had said he would "break" Smith,
and the attorney also stated tbat Fair bad
brought these charges so as to nullify
Smith' < prospects of becoming the head
of the Fir? Department.
Mayor Thomas then took a hand. He
said that ii tbe Chi f made threats to
''break& man he should have preferred
charges wifh the Commissioners. "In
this case," said the Mayor, "there was a
storm brewing and it broke out."
Engineer Smith's attorney tried to save
him with a novel plea. He said it would
doubtlrss have been better for Smith
to have told the reporter he had nothine
to say, but that was only an error of judg
ment on hi* part and therefore Smith bad
not "caused the public&tion" of the
article.
After bearing the evider.ee the Commis
sioners retired, and in about twetr.y min
utes they decided that Smith had at least
been somewhat indiscreet and suspendec
him for twenty days from Ap r il 1. Before
the twenty days are up it is not all un
likely that a succosuor to Chief Fair will
have been elected.

DAVIE'S BACKERS
LOSE THEIR COIN
The Close of the Recount
Does Not Alter the
Result.
Olficsrs of E ection Seem to Have
Been Very Correct in
the Work.
Major Thoma? Was Not Awarded
Blocks of Votes That Were
Marked for Davie.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 10. ,
All the people who bet money that John
L. Davie would succeed himself as Mayor
of Oakland will have to pay their bets.
Not only that, but they will also have to
pay for the costs of tbe recount, which
wjs concluded this afternoon.
All the tales of fraud, of illiterate offi
cers of election, of duplicated ballots, of
Result of the Recount, Which Ended as It Began.
crooked work inside the booth by those
who helped incapacitated persons to mark
iheir ballots, have fallen to the ground
and it has been demonstrated a second
time that thÂ« recent election was perhaps
one of the straigbtest, as regurda the work
of officials, that has ever taken place in
this city.
When the result of the recount was an
nounced it showed that Mayor Thomas
had been elected by a plurality of 87 votes.
This is about a dozen less than was given
him by the official returns. In the sensa
tional complaint filed on behalf of ex-
Mayor Davie it was alleged that in many
precincts more than this number of votes
were known to have been tallied for
Thomas that should have been called for
Da vie. There is no doubt that the people
who made these allegations were acting
on what they considered to be reliable
authority. It is now just as certain that
their authority was entirely unreliable.
After the election ex-Mayor Davie is
sued a statement in which he declared
that he was uerfectly satisfied with tbe re
sult, and that he considered the closeness
of the vote a vindication of his policy for
the past two years. He refused to believe
all the storie- of fraud and irregularities,
and stated that he would not pay 1 cent
towar i a recount.
Men who bad bet heavily on the elec
tion took the matter up, and after they
had drawn up a complaint Mr. Davie was
indued to sign it, remarking as he did so
that as lons as other citizens wanted to
have a recount he would not do anything
to prevent ii. He has not, however, put
up a dollar of the expenses, and has all
along declared that he would not do so.
As shown by (he arguments to-day, the
attorneys for the contestants' expected to
win their case by tbe court refusing to ac
cept the returns from several whole pre
cincts J:i'.i,-u Hull, however, declined to
admit that ilierc was any foundation lor
setting aside the will of the people, as
shown conclusively by the ballot?, because
of a doubtful irregularity which could not
be proved to have been intentional on tue
part of an election officer.
After all the disputed ballots were passed
upo:i by the court thÂ» returns showed that
D.ivie had received 2948 and Thomas 3035,
a plurality lor the Mayor of 87.
Everybody is satisfied that thi election
returns were counted with correctness. A
week ago there was a contest over the
Council man of tho First Ward, and a
total recount showed only a difference of
f^ur votes from the otti^ai return*.

Theater Bats Are Going.
OAKLAND. Cal.. April 6.â Manager
Mark Thrall of the Macdonouuh Theater,
who has returned from managing tne
Georeia Cayvan Comnany in all the South
ern cities from New Orleans, says that the
custom of remnvine the hat by ladies
during plays Is rapidly becoming common.
'â¢The custom is becoming almost univer
sal," he said to-day, "and is certainly
appreciated by the patrons of the tnea
ters. lam glad to see the custom increas
ing, and I am sure all other managÂ»rs fe 1
the same. Since I left Oakland, two
months ago, it has become much more
common in my own theater, and last night
I was surprised to see tfce number of ladies
who removed their hats before the per
formance."
WHO WAS C. JOHNSON?
Was an Imprisoned Suicide
Buried Under a Wrong
Name ?
He Is Believe! to Hava Been a Con
vict or Criminal of Some
Kind.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 10.â A qneer
discovery has been made in connection
with the suic de of the man calling him
self "C. Johnson," who killed himself in
a cell in the City Jail the other nignt by
turning on the gas. For some reason the
officers did not believe that Johnson was
his real name, and in searching lor some
clew to It ti:e name of "G Mulier" was
found scratcned on the wall of the futai
cell. Somo one also recognized the man
as one Miller, who had at one time been
employed as an engineer at the artesian
weli worus. So the Coroner's jury, after
listening to the evidence and" the sur
mises, brought in a verdict that deceased
was named G. Mulier, and he was accord
ingly baned under that name.
Now it transpires tuat G. Mulier is nonÂ«
other than the San Fruncisco clam-d g.-er
who filled a Chinaman with buckshot over
near Bay Farm Island a week or fo ;<eo
and who was locked ud in the cell where
Johnson afterward killed himself, and
while there must have whiled away his
time scribbling his name on the wall.
The officers are inclined to believe that
Johnson was an escaped convict or crim
inal of some kind and was afraid of being
recognized -hould he come to trial.
Hence uiey have had photos made and
sent out over ttie State in order to obtain
some clew as to the suicide's identity.

TEACHEKS' ANNUITIES.
The Organization to He KCfectert Two
Weeks Hence.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 10.â The A!a
meda County Teachers' Benefit Associa
tion met at the hieh school this ruorniug
to discuss the teachers' annuity act.
Superintendent McClymonds said that
the teachers ought to taue le<;al advica
concerning the provisions of the bill in
order to go ahead in safety. He thought
public sentiment was opposed to rension
mc teachers. He said: "The minute the
public pays into the fund it means a pen
sion, but when we pay it is an annuity.
Under the bill the teaofaer gets what we
pay thÂ» substitute. I should fnvo* that if
the department saves anything by a
teacher's absence it should go to * the
annuity fund."
A discussion arose as to the election of
teachers and Mr. McClymonds surprised
several of those present by trying that the
city charter does not provide that all
teachers shall De elected annually. It is
this annual election with the consequent
Knowledge that a teacher cannot depend
on being retained in the department ion^
enough 10 injure a pension that is the
cause of anxiety.
Mr. McCarthy recommended that an or
ganization be effected in accordance with
the bill and it was decided to appoint a
committee to look into the question of
tenure of office, so that at a meeting two
weeks hence an organization can be ef
fected.

BAY CITYS
CHALLENGE
OLYMPICS
Will Race Over Again for
Fun, Money or
Marbles.
NOW TIRED OF TALKING
Any Time, Any Men or Any
Course Will Suit the Vic
torious Cub.
CAPT. DAY'S SWEEPING OFFER.
Claims That Ed Kragness Was Not
Eligible to Ride in the
Great Rslay.
The blood of the Bay City Wheelmen is
up, and the club intends to call <iown the
racing element of tho Olympic Club in a
manner that will settle for ail time the
trouble over the recent relay, and put an
end to the talk that has been flying back
and forth ever since the great event was
won and loU.
It is a flat proposition now of "put up
or shut up," and the challenge that is
herein put forth admits of no "about tho !
bush" tactics. I
The Bay Citys, through Captain Day, j
their spokesman, say that they will race i
the Olympics over again for fun, money or
marbles, at any time and under any con
ditions.
"It is time this bluff pane of the Olym
pics came to an end," said Captain Day.
"and we will give them a chance to regain
their lost iaurels that they cannot well
ignore.
"They say that they think they have '
the best team, and were not beaten on the ,
tquare; that thej- are willing to race I
again, but do not believe they can drag us !
into any kind of a contest. Frank Fuller j
is quoted as saying this, and no doubt he
did, but he knows better.
"To make these kickers cume to time or
forever hold their peace, we will do ti.is: i
"We will race them at any time for fun, for
$500, or even $1000, giving them the same
team they had before, or any team ihey I
can choose from among their members, i
"We will race them over any course they j
can pick out. the same reiay course pre- :
ferred, and let tnem take their time to
prepare.
'Moreover, we will bet them $100 that
they dare not make a race for $500 a side,
ami a? much more that we beat them as
far as we did before.
"Of course we would not put up the
trophy we have fairly won, for it is righi
futiy ours, and we value it highly, but we
are open to any other reasonable proposi
tion. Ifiheyare so anxious lor a race as
they say, let them race for the mere sport
and see which is the champion club. That
would suit us, and it wouldn't cost them
a cent except for the training of their men.
"All this talk of tricKery and not living ;
up 10 the rules is rot, and is hurting th-- I
sport in the eyes ot those who have the j
interests of bicycling at heart. All we !
gay is, 'Race again or stop talking.'
"The more they talk the more informa
tion we get as to the ii. eligibility of the
men they raced to contest in such an |
event. Take, for instance, Ed Kra^ness, j
who rode the eighth relay for them. He
is an employe of the club, and there is a
law of the organization that when a mem
ber becomes an employe he must resign
his membership, fco Kragnetjj must have
been ineligible.
"Talk about tricksâ look at the way \
they stuffed Edwards in two years ago. j
To ride in the race required sixty days' '
actual membership in the participating !
club. Edwards had only been a member {
for ten days when the race took place, and |
knowing that if they won a p. otest and j
investigation might reveal this, they
tacked his name on the end of a list voted
on several months before in an effort to j
pull us into believing that he was o" sixty
days' standing. If that is not tricky work
then what do you call it?
"If any authorized representative of the
Olympic Club will call on me at any time
I will be glad to see him and arrange a
race."
INVESTIGATING THE WRECK.

Superintendent E. M. Van Frank of the

RINALDO BROS.TcO^o-3O2 T Sy st.
MARRIED A PORTLAND MERCHANT,
Miss Edith Kittridge, daughter of the late Jonathan KitiridÃe, and Henry A. Sargent
ol the Simonds faw Company, Portland, Or., were married on Friday evening at the resi
dence of the bride's brother-in-law, X. F. Howarth, 401 Laurel street. Rev. Dr. Hemphill
performed the ceremony in the pre.-ence of relatives and intimate friends only. The bride
was attended by her little niece, Geraldine Howarth, who officiated as maid of honor, and
Miss Kate Durbrow and Miss Amy Swain were bridesmaids. T. F. Hogarth was b'^t man.
The decorations of the home was a labor of love, performed by Mils Mary Batei and inti
mate friends of tlie bride. Yellow blossoms were used exclusively.
The bride's gown was ol white moire velours trimmed with accordlon-plntted chiffon.
The bridal veil was confi ned to tbe coiffure by a diamond and pearl crescent, the gift oi the
groom. The bridesmaids and the dainty little maid oi honor were attired alike in white
mousseline de soie and carried bouquets of yellow roses. Mr. and Mrs. Sargent left yes ter
day afternoon for their home In Portland, Or.
that the party who did it was well ac
quainted with the operation of the road
and knew that the point where the ob
structions were placed is just where the
east and west bound trains pass when
running on schedule time. There is every
evidence that the criminals knew that the
cars would crash into each other at ttie
point they selected for their diabolical
work. It is believed that the criminals
had a grudge against Mr. t-'utro.
WANT SCHOOLHOUSES.

Messrs. Hnbbs and Moloney of the
Richmond District spoke for that section,
and stated that It would take an eight
room brick building to accommodate the |
pupils. They wanted it built on the
! Twelfth-avenue school lot.
Presiilio Heights citizens wanted the
! Madison Primary School turned into an
eight-room building, ana I'recita Valley
representatives asked - for a four-room
building to be erected near Holly Park.
Runnyside, the Excelsior Homestead
: and the Five Mile Improvement Club also
asked for .-chool facilities, and it was the
consensus of opinion among the commit
tceruen that all the applications should be
favorably reported to the board.
Provision will be made for these build
ings in the next estimate for the school

AMBROSE WILL
NOT OBEY ORDERS
His Deputy Says "the
Board of Supervisors
Be ."
Mr. Donovan Says That Reso
lutions Were Passed With
out Right.
The Superintendent Will Not Take
Chances oj Being Sued for
Damages
"The Board of Supervisors be "
When Deputy Superintendent of Streets
Andy Donovan said this he said it as
though he meant it, and, moreover, gave
his reasons for so doing. It simply means
that there has been fiiction between the
Hoard of Supervisors and the Superin
tendent of Streets, and that it has re
suited in a clash that has left the advant
age with Mr. Ambrose.
There are a number of resolutions passed
by the board that the SupÃrintendent has
refused to recognize and will not under
any circumstances carry out. He has
been advised that any public official who
commits an illegal act is responsible for
the same, and he does not propose to un
dertake anything that will place himself
or his bonusmen in the line of financial
loss.
Some time ago the board passed a reso
lution, in response to a petition from
property-owners askine that a house on
rSrady street between Valencia and Mis
sion be removed, authorizing and direct
ing the Superintendent of Streets to re
move the structure forthwith. The
resolution stated that the board would
indemnify Mr. Ambrose for any suit that
miL'ht be brought against him.
Mrs. O'Rourke, a widow, aud her fam
ily of little ones occupy the house, and the
widow claims an interest in the property.
The Superintendent pigeon-holed the reso
lution because he did not desire to take
chances on getting into a legal tangle, and
the board, or at least somn of its members,
desires to know the reason why and to
force the Superintendent to explain his
reason for lailing to obey.
It whs when informed" of this latter fact
that Deputy Superintendent Donovan
said, "The Board of Supervisors beâ.''
"Tlie ooard," *aid Mr. Donovan, "seems
to think that all it ha- to do is to tell us to
do a thing and that we will blindly obey.
We know better, for on more thau one
occasion the Superintendent has been
dragged into legsl squaooles that have
been expensive and annoying.
"On one occasion ue hai! to Drove the
title of a man to a piece of properly in
order to escape payinc bie damages. In
this case as in many others that we have
recently refused to handle there is a ques
tion as to the title of the property and
Mr. Ambrose does not intend to pall any
one's chestnuts out of the fire.
"The proper cour.-e for the board to pur
sue if it wants Mrs. O'Rourke and her
little ones removed is to instruct the City
and County Attorney to begin a suit that
will settle the rights of all parties.
"Mr. Creswell knows that the board has
no right to put such burdens on us. We
are not going to move Mrs. O'Rourke or
interfere in any of the similar case* that
are now on our book*, and if the board
tries to force us all I have to Â»ay is, 'The
Board of Supervisors be .' "

Two Chinese 'Women Taken From Tile
Surroundings I. am Night. '
â¢ Two Chinese women living in a low
house on Bartlett alley, near Sullivan al- '!
ley, lately sent word to Mi s Culbertson of
the Presbyterian Chinese Mission that ;
they desired to be rescued from the life
they were leading. - They stated that they
wore under 18 years of acre and that their
owner kept them bo closely guarded that
they could not escape. ..Miss Culberuon
sent for Frank Hoi brook, secretary of the
Eureka Society for the Protection of Chil
dren, and they started out on their mis
sion of mercy. . â¢
On the way they called for the assist
ance of Police Officers Meredith and Duke
of the Chinatown sqnad. The house and
the women were easily found and they
accompanied Miss Culbertson and the of
ficers to tne Ladies' Mission at 920 Sacra
memo street. Tise other inmates of the
Chinese resort, fearing that they, too,
were wanted, made their escape by" scam
pering over the roofs of the adjoining
buildings.

Aside from tho salt water tanks, a freÂ«h

Any one who has never visited the museum

During the senÂ«on of 1896 nearly 150,000
bathers patronized us, and indications point

The Old I.inrirM House la Being Placed
In a Thoroughly Sanitary
Condition.
There Is every prospect that the old
Lindell House on Howard and Sixth
streets, which recently fell under the ban
of the Board of Health, will be allowed to
resnme business after it has been put in
sanitary condition. The edict of tho
Health l>epan rnent contemplated tearing
it down it it could not be thoroughly reno
vated, but the matter has probably been
adjusted.
William Wolf, the proprietor, had a
conference with Dr. Fitzgibbon recently
and the latter agreed that if Wolf woul.;
carry out certain plans proposed he would
advise the board to permit the house to be
tenanted.
Plumbers are now at work and will put
in an entirely new sanitary system. The
house will be renovated and made en
tirely satisfactory to the boaid. It is ex
pected that a report on the home will be
read at next Monday's meeting of the
board and action taken permitting Wolf
to continue his business.

AGAIN EXPERTING
THE PARK BOOKS
Two Grand Jury Account
ants Set to Work at
Them.
Variation of Estimates as to the
Quantity of Concrete in
the Tunnel.
Park Commissioners and the Gran:
Jury Held a Pro ongcd Conference.
Scope of the Inquiry.
The new lodge in Golden Gate Park was
the scene of considerable activity yester
day afternoon. The Park Committee and
experts of th .; Grand Jury were holding a
session in trie east end of the building,
while Irving M. Scott, Joseph Austin and
John Roaemeld. Golden Gate Park Com
missioners, were holding a conference in
the west end. The Superintendent and
secretary were kept pretty busy supplying
each with desired in:orraation.
Yesterday was not the regular meeting
day of the board, but as all the Commis
sioners happened to arrive at the lodge at
about the same hour it was deemed expe
dient to discuss some important questions
relating to park management.
Raphael Peixotto (foreman) and Wil
liam E. Lutz (secretary) of the Grand
Jury, together with M. F. Fragley, chair
man of the jury committee on parks and
squares, joined the experts, Messrs
Her'.che and Kitlredge, in the examina
tion of accounts.
After the separate sessions there was a
joint session of tie Grand Jury commit
tee and the Park Commissioners. Tho
conference was aec.dediy animated and it
was inferred that opinions were freely ex
pressed.
The committee expected to be ready to
submit a report Jast evening, but it was
decided to defer the preparation of the
document until after Lieutenant Potter,
Engineer Corps, U. S. A., has been heard
by the Grand Jury. Lieutenant Potter
made the measurement of the concrete
aud other material m the nark tunnel and
Dndge for the Grand Jury of which
Frederick Hobbs was foreman.
Subsequently the material was meas
ure! by other engineers, and the second
calculations produced results at variance
witu Lieutenant Potter's conclusions.
The present Grand Jury will asK the
army engineer lor exp unations, and per
hap- direct a re*urvey of the whole work.
When Park Commissioner Austin was
asked yesterday what particular work or
contract the Grand Jury was investigating
lie said that the committee was going into
the bridge, the pumping plant und every
thing else.
The Commissioners are suro'.y affording
the Grand Jury ready assistance, and are
not manifesting the least impatience at
the presence of experts.
It is already foreshadowed that the re
port of the Grand Jury will speak hiehly
of the integrity and ability of me Park
Commissioners, and the report of the ex
pert will show that all the money appro
priated by the City ior the maintenance
of the' great pleasure ground has been ac
counted for. but the document may rec
ommend open public competition for
work and material used in park improve
ment, and also suggest open sessions of
the board. ,
The members of the Grand Jury are
duly impressed with the recently ac
quired knowledge that the Board of Park
Commissioners! is a body possessing al
most autocratic power?. It is not amen
able to the orders of the Mayor, Superin
tendent of Streets or Board of Supervisors.
The Auditor is the only City officer that
holds any chick whatever on the board.
Several years ago legislation was secured
at Sacramento to render the board a free
and independent agent, and it can now
designate the number of employes re
quired and fix the compensation lor each
in any sum it phases. IEHIB
ThÂ« % last municipal tax levy provided
$250,000 for the maintenance of the park
lor the present fiscal year. It is believed
that this money, under the direction of
the Commissioners and under the super
vision of Superintendent McLaren, has
been expended for desired improvement
and needed embellishment of the park,
but the committee of the Grand Jury
wants to ascertain if the money was care
fully expended or extravagantly dis
bursed. The Grand Jury regards the in
quiry as timely, inasmuch as the Park
Commissioners have not elected to take
the nublic into their confidence through
the columns of the press.
The Board of Supervisors and the Board
of Education hold open public sessions.
Even the regents of the university make a
show of holding open se-sions, and they,
like the Park Commissioners, derive from
the Governor the privilege of serving the
public.
Last Monday the work of constructing
the electric plant for Golden Gate Park
was commenced. The funds available
this fiscal year will enable the Commis
sioners to build the house. Later on the
engine can be purchased and the under
ground wires laid. In the park overhead
wires cannot be used. An engine with
power sufficient to generate 100 lights will
be supplemented by additional power
when more lights are required.

â¢TWjr tooui; eiÂ«vawÂ»r tuuÂ« aUui*M, â¢*Â»*â¢â¢ l Â«The Easter girl has arrived in all her
glory, a week ahead of time. The strain
proved too much for her; she simply
could not wait until next Sunday. Her ;
recnlia arrived almost a week ago, and I ;
leally believe that every day since then
some portion of the outfit has been thor
oughly overhauled, to be sure every de
tail was correct.
What a weight off the clear girl's mind
now that her plans have materialized into
such a beautiful creation! And, although
we may say that our Easier girl is pay and
frivolous and of the earth earthly, still
you will all agree with me that her taste
is exquisiteâ that she isÂ» indeed an artist.
The Easter girl is as much a detail of
social and fashionable Easter as the sum
mer irirl is of the summer outing season.
I think that since only Easter week and
the summer season have been distin
guished by the particular attention of
the American girl, and by the adaptation
of her fashions to their respective require
ments, those two periods of the year
ought to feel immensely flattered. The
Easter girl and the summer girl are, of
course, special editions of the American
girl. And the artists of the illustrated
weeklies and monthliesâ notably Charles
Dana Gibson â correspondingly picture
their young feminine creations as ordinary
American girls in all seasons of the year
other than Easter week and the summer
months.
The American Girl has become a suffi
ciently distinct institution to attain cap
italization in the transient prints of the I
day. and all of us are fond of talking
about her as a special and superior orna
ment to her sex. Of course one couldn't
begin to describe definitely what one
means by tlie social stress laid upon her
as a type, since one can't tell where the
ordinary girl leaves off, and where the
particular ideal American Girl in capitals
begins. I guess we're all American Girls
ii we lead the fashions lrom season to sea- ;
son, strike a Gibsonian pose, throw up our j
Leads and wear a re.-ally independent j
expression as we pose. In full bloom
the American Girl wears a well-ii-h
--doesn' t- please- you -nobody cares look
about her which doesn't strike you while
she is in the chrysalis stale.
I have watched this dear creature
ofttimes in church since Lent came in. I
noted her earnest, stnd'ons lace, and
made my mind up that she was diligently
examining her conscience, piling up j
against herself numerous frivolous actions
that she was now sorry lor â such a serious
look as she had at times.
I really tried myself to follow her exam
ple by recalling numerous frivolities that
I had been guilty of â poor, deluded mor
tai that I was!
The grave, pensive attitude was the re
sult of a conglomeration of colors and
combinations chasing each other through
this dear young creature's brain, and not
of remorse. The little saying, "Things
are not what they seem," hovers over me
where'er I go. I have been fooled more
times than 1 can recall by forgetting those
few valuable words, but, then, I guess we
have all been there, 60 what's the good of
moralizing?
About this time I know some one is
frowning because I haven't described the
costume that adorns milady so grandly. j
So here it is:
The dress is of golden brown grenadine
over green silk. The green silk skirt lias i
three narrow ruffles around the bottom :
edged with narrow black lace, giving that j
full effect that we find in all the new
skirts.
The grenadine skirt haÂ» around the
bottom a band of green and brown ap
HOW A MAN WENT SHOPPING TO LEARN THE PRICES OF EASTER BONNETS
During the past week the City has been
the Mecca ot retail milliners arriving
from all over California, the coast States
and Honolulu, who have come to attend
the openings which all the wholesale
millinery establishments have been hold
ing.
The wholesale phase of th : s business iÂ»
peculiar in its invariable concentration in
large centers. T';e houses of the kind on
this coaÂ«t are all In San Francisco. Los
Angeles, though a large city, had one
wholesaler who, after maintaining busi
ness for a year, recently closed out.
San Francisco has seventeen wholesale
millinery houses and it is the presence of
so many here tnat attracts to the City
twice a year between 1500 ami 2000 ladies
who conduct retail stores in the various
interior town?. It is a part of the educa
tion of puoh mi. liners that they shall
make these semi-annual visits to San
Francisco ami scrutinize the gorgeous
displays which are arrayed for them by ,
the wholesale nouses. Once here, they ]
flit from house to house in an ecstacy of
excitement and delight, culling the sweet
est of the entrancing objects which dazzle
their eyes and bearing off as trophies of
their trip these wonders of the milliner's
art.
And â wonders indeed are they. Into
that piece de resistance of the belle's cos
turao there is wound and threaded and
pinched and plaited the handiwork of
over half of Europe and Japan. From
China come ihe straw braids which are
turned into a cup with a spider-web rim.
To this complement of bewitching effects,
wholly stunning to susceptible mascu
linity, Cuba contributes the ribboned
fibers of her yucca palms and cacti; Italy
gives her fragile filamentous straws; Per
sia sends cilt galloons, gorgeous with the
rich tracery of her arnbesques; while Pans
decorates all tlie^e with her incomparable
art, her sparkling cut-steel cabouchons
and polished j<sts, her wealth of artificial
flowers so marvelou^ly true in color and
tone, in shape an d size, that nature's
creations, it would seem, are made super
fluous.
Then the silk laces and gauze, the rib
bon and chiffon, the silk-wrapped wire for
frames, ail this and more Paris gives to
the season's style, while heavier and more
solid Germany brines luscious-looking
cherries and berries, with polished wild
crabapr'es and all of the fruit-bearing
b:os9oms. England sends stuffed birds,
wing", s;ikes lrom the plumed heron, and
brings for us from Africa and New Guinea
airy tufts from the feathery foliage of tne
bird of carudise.
All of these materials garnered from the
East are brought into New York. It is a
fact, therefore, that nearly all our own
miUinery is foreign. America furnishes
but little. She gives mainly silks, ribbons,
felts and feathers.
Though Paris declares the season's
styles yet the two dozen different hats
whicb come from there are in reality
but the monuments of the several types
which tney present. Instantly they ar
rive in the United States there begins the
most extensive variations upon them.
They are luodin'ed, extended, enlarged, re
duced. Tue whole gamut, from the apex

to the base, is trilled wilh the exquisite
lightness and touch of a virtuoso, for al
though the Parisian artists hold sway as
creative goddesses in millinery, yet the
United States, and particularly San Fran
cisco, contains an innumerable army of
the most suDtle and delicate goddesses of
the denri sort, who po sess an indefini;e
faculty for manipulating whatever copies
may tail to their bands.
And the cost of them ! Ah 1 there it
where masculinity takes a hand. Pater
familias is content with a $3 stiff brimmed
black, and if a favorable turn of the elec
tion removes its element of cost so much
the better. But with the wife and daugh
ter no bets go there. It is a solid, resound
ing plunk of the enviable piasters every
" THIRTY-NINE DOLLARS AND A HALF."
lime April heaves in and August breathes
outârthis for a certainly whether there
occurs one or more middle-marchps or not.
Moved by the kindred sympathy whicb
one suffering soul ever involuntarily f<?els
for another, I here append an estimate
which I was recently furnisned by a prom
inent Market-street retail milliner upon
the cost of a hat of fairly good quality and
kind, such as the average San Francisco
business man will draw his check for this
season.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 11, 1897.
M ndame smiled on m c charmingly as she
ascertained mv mission and said:
'Ob, you men are so curious"; then,
thrusting aside the slidine doors of acaÂ«e,
she removed from its stool what I thought
to be a pleasing sort of property fit; it
seemed to be a feminine companion to the
three-dollar Stetson which I have been
wearing since November.
"Now, isn't that exquisite?' 1 queried
Madame, as she balanced this affair on the
tips of her lingers, "isn't that just de
lightful?"
I admitted the appropriateness of the
adjectives, and while 1 did not staeger
with intoxication over the art effect, my
liveliest feelings were aroused through
curiosity to know what might be the price.
"Price?" exclaimed the Madame, as
though that were a wholly subsidiary
consideration, "now ain't you men
curious for a fact. Well, let me see." She
turned over a white tag, whicn was strung
to the thing, then she held up the hat,
looked at it. and, Â«miiing at it again, she
â aid in a nonchalant way:
"Thirty-nine dollars and a half."
"Bâ butâ Madame," I ventured in mild
remonstrance, "youâ you must be mis
taken. Iâ ah, that is, 1 beg your pardon."
Recovering ray composure, and tippine J
my own $3 affair, which seemed to swell
with indignation beneath my tonch, 1
straightened up and took another look at
the finery.
"Yes," I said, "that is certainly very
bÂ»aati!ul; more beautiful, indeed, than it
seemed to me when I first looked at it.
Would you kindly analyze it for me, say,
from the ground up, and inform me what
each part of it has cost? For doubtless in
such an aggregate there are elements of
cost in each particular, are there not?"
She smiled at me again and said "Cer
tainly."
"You have no objection to my taking
notes?"
"Certainly not."
She began: "Now, the hat is made of
Neapolitan braid, woven horsehair, and it
never loses its stiffness. That comes from
Italy and costs $5. Then this is an
aigrette of three-dozen birds of paradise
plumes worth $15, tufted with two small
ostrich plumes costing $5 each, or $10.
These are held with a cut steel buckle and
rhinestone ornament worth $3 50. . It is
turned up in the back with a handsome
bunch of Russian violets worth $1 50.
Then there are two yards of applique lace,
champagne color, for inside finish, worth
$1 per yard; that's $2. Then the trim
ming is $1 50. So, altogether, it is $30 50."
I smirked. '- â¢ â¢ â  â¢ . -â  â â¢ .".:,;â¢.
"But is that the cheapest you have?" I
asked. : *,"'
"Ob, no," replied Madam*, still smiling;
"we have lots cheaper tnan that, ana
very fashionable, too; now there's a red
in a coquelicot shade on a shaded helio
trope..fancy braid. You see on the left
aide violets and leaves are arranged against
the crown, and here at the back is a ban
deau upon which violets' are massed to
fall over the hair. Then there are violets
supported on wire-rubbered stems dis
posed in a hedgeiike -fashion. â¢ Here on
the right side is a chou of red velvet. It
is a very pretty effect," she said, holding
it up admiringly.
' "What's that worth?" â¢' '
"Twenty dollar*."
I grinned.
"Then again," she said, "here's a fancy
green straw braid r that's going to be the
rage this season. .It has a high crown,
almost hidden under a tangle of bluets.
Its ' brim is medium size, bent up on the
left side, fixed under with a tall bunch of
lovely blossoms. Toward the back and
on the left side, here bluets are arranged
among loops of Nile green ribbon, with a
rhinestone pin supplementing the trim
ming. I think the color harmony is charm
ing, don't you?"
"What's the price?"
"Eighteen dollars."
"Certainly charming."
"Now, here's a light green chip; the
brim droops in front and rolls up at the
i edge of the back. The crown Is high ana
supports a mass of small white flowers and
leaves-^" .
"What's the price?" 1 gasped.
"Twenty dollars.". -Â» "
"Good-day!" .' . . . ' _
"Won't take anything to-day?" _t _ ,
"No, guess uot." . V. _. - . * .
"I guess you had better send your
wife," she said, smoothing out her smile
and drawing her lip into a curl.
I bowed my thanks for the suggestion,
but under ray bated breath I was uttering
the declaration "not if the court Knows
hisself, and I thing he do'' â and 1 went
away.
These pattern hats embody not alone
the set styles for the season, but all that
is accepted in the new offerings of ma
terial which the ingenuity and taste of
the world is in competition constantly
thrusting upon the great French center.
These hats then pa^s into the enormous
workshops of New York and are copied,
copied and multiplied by hundreds and
thousands and are sent all over the East
and Central West, rarely, however, to
"NO; NOTHING TO-DAY, THANKS. GOOD-BY."
San if rancisco. for this City being itself a
great millinery center holds sweet com
munion direct with the exalted mistress
of the modes and does its own importing.
But after all it is not hats that Paris and
the San Francisco wholesaler aim to seil
to the retailer who stands between them
and the consumer. The hats are made up
to display the new features in material,
and it is the material which constitutes
the great commodity of the millinery
trade. The hats the retail milliners make
(or trim) themselves, modifying the de
siens as I have said from the models
which they buy. Indeed, notwithstanding
all that is wrought by the retail trimmers,
it often happens that nothing they have
done pleases the tastes of certain of their
customers and these ladies give orders for
hats specially designed afier their own
ideas, for every woman is a student in mil
linery art, andthere is nothing in the line
of attire that sinks deeper in her soul than
the phases and freaks of millinery fash
ions.
Sot only does Europe send us the ma
terials of which femininity contrives her
most astonishing effects in chapeaux, but
she sends us also fashions. Ihe great
birthplace of millinery styles is Paris.
Ah, Paree ! what exquisite thrills the
magic of the name subpenas when at
tend in th c contemplation of thought
upon millinery. There the deft ringers of
the mam-rno-zelis, their acute art in
stinct pot-grown in an atmosphere upon
which is exhaled the art of the Louvre, of
the Palais dcs Beaux Arts, of the splen
did architecture of the Tuillenes, the
Luxembourg, there ladies employ their
finely wrought up sensibilities in the in
vention of millinery designs. Six months
before the openings occur in the houses
of the San Francisco wholesalers the fiat
has cone out in Paris what the season's
style shall be. To this imperial edict
New York defers the supple hinges of the
knee and obsequiously accepts the four or
plique outlined with gold. The effect de

bination must be seen to be appreciated.
The skirt is live yards wide, with all the
fullness in the back. There is just a slight
dip in the back to the skirt, giving it a
very graceful hang. We are getting back
to the bell skirt very rapidly, and really
there have oeen no graceful skirts since
we cast the beli-shapad stcirts aside.

The waist, under which milady'a heart

beauty and a joy not forever, as the poet

The husband of Mr 3. Marsh was a

of Groton. When he died, a year and a

Mrs. Marsh quickly solved the proDlem by

which had devolved upon her late hus

But notwithstanding these apparently
high prices, the millinery business is one
of many losses. Tne constant changing
oi styles renders almost valueless the
goods of the passing season, so as the
term draws to its close the prices are cut
often far below cost and goods rushed off to
be got rid of. Indeed, many are the New
York milliners who, unable to sell even at
auction old shapes in frames, unable even
to give tbeni away, have had them carted
to the nighttime to the bay and dumped.
They must be got out of the way
space is too valuable. Thus thousands of
dollars annually go to waste. But it can
not be helped. Fashion must not be kept

A New Parisian Fad.
A table-tipping fad has taken possession
of Paris. Occult influences cause tbe fur
niture to oscillate. Mysterious raps
slowly jar out words of messages from
famons persons long dead. These things
occur in the most fashionable families.
No one has yet attempted to expose the
method, if such a thing could be accom
plished. All this is the wonder of tho
hour. If half what is heard is true Napo
leon I is thoroughly up to date on the af
fairs of the world, and Louis XIV knows
just what is taking place in republican
France.
So firm a hold has the new idea taken
that invitations to table-tipping parties
have become as frequent as a request to
join a friend at dinner. Any day one is
likely to receive this sort of a note:
Monsieur and Madame request Mon
sieur to pass the evening of with
them. There will be table turning.
The invitation is accepted, of course, ior
it is decidedly unfashionable to refuse.
Entering the salon, one is instantly im
pressed by the air of mystery which is
over all. The light is delicately shaded
in just the fashion that obtains in the
apartments where the psychologist un
folds to you the mysteries of what is to
come. There are several tables in the
salon. About these are seated a number
of persons, varying from three to eight.
There is a hush, a solemn silence, that
even the host and hostess seem dis.in
clined to break. boon the guests have al
arrived, and the tupping oi the table pro
ceeds.
Dipsomaniacs in Sweden, when put
under restraint, are fed almost entirely
on bread steeped in wine. In less than a
fortnight they loathe the very look and
smell of liquor, and when liberated gen
erally become total abstainers. In Rus
sia a similar treatment is followed witb
good results.18
THE LAST ENTRY
BY CLARK RUSSELL -/ S\
Synopsis of Preceding Chapters.
MfONTAGTK VANDERHOLT, a retired Cape merchant, widowed and with
n an only daughter, upon tne advice of his physician, determined to take
_3 a cruise to the equator end back to London in his schooner yacht, the
Mowbrav. He cugaged a Captai:: Ulew to command the vessel end placed the
matter of selecting the crew and purchasing the stores for the men in the fore
castle in his hands. In December, 1848, Mr. Vanderholt and his daughter set sail
from London for their winter's cruise. Oil the tilth day of the voyage Captain
G'.ew acknowledged to Mr. Vanderholt that there was dissatisfaction among mem
bers of the crew on account of ihe quality of the meals served them. All that
ni?ht there were mutinous muttenngs among members oi the watch. At the
crew's dinner hour the next day the sailors, led by the second mate, James Jones,
mutinied. They sent the kids containing their despised food flying toward the
quarterdeck where Mr. Vanderhoit and his daughter and Captain Glew were con
sregated. Olew, with the assistance of the first mate, Tweed, attempted to piaco
Jones, the leader oi the mutiny, in irons. The remainder of the crew started to
rush to their leader's aid, but were stopped by Vauderholt, who, with, pistol in
hand, declared that he would kill the first man who interfered witn the Captain.
Daring tbe threatening pistol, Simon Toole, an Irish sailor, rushed into the melee
and stabbed the captain. At the seme time Vauderholt fired, but the bullet killed
Mate Tweed instead of Toole, for whom it was intended. Then a sailor named
Maul killed Vanderholt with a belaying pin. All these horrible events transpired
before the horrified eyes of the daughter of the owner of the snip, who found her
self in agonizing helplessness with, her dead at sea in a vessel manned by hali
drunken, murderou^ madmen. On December 20 of the same year the ship
Alfred, Capiain Barrington, bound from India to London, sights tne Mowbray
north of the equator and rinds that she is deserted. A boat is sent aboard and
returns with the logbook, in which fs found an unfinished entry, written by
Miss Vanderholt, telling the story of the mutiny. Oue of the passengers on
board the Alfred is Captaiu Parry, to whom Miss Vanderholt is betrothed, and
he Is naturally much moved by the discovery. After some discussion Barring
ton begins a search on the high seas for Miss Vanderhoit, and has just secured a
clew which he is following.
"For God's sake, Mr. Blundell," broke in Captain Parry, "don't joke."
"I mean, sir,' 1 continued Mr. Blundell, in a voice that did Him some
honor, as it proved that he could be abashed, "that we should have to
Jeave three of our people to loot alter the schooner, so that we should go
four to eicht in order to fetch them."
"We are armed," exclaimed Captain Parry.
"Two pistols," said the mate.
"We must bring iheni aboard, we must bring them aboard," cried
Captain Parry, in a voice that almo3t "houted with nerve. "Will they be
content," he went on after a hard suck or two at his cigar, "to continue
washing about in a wreck that might spread under them at any minute
like a pack oi cards, when they see a schooner alongside willing to receive
them?"
"To be banged, sir." t
"Who's to tell them that till we've got them under hatches?" said
Captain Parry.
"They know this craft," said Blundell, in a note of gloom. "It'll be
a jobâ eight of 'em and only four of us. It'll take us all we know."
At daybreak nothing was visible in tne telescope from the fore royal
yard. The weatuer had cleared in the night. It was a strange mountain
ous morning of huge, swollen cloud, whose sun-brightened bellies amaz
ingly brightened the silver of that ocean. >*ow and again round about
the horizon a spark of lightning would flash in the neart of a violet
shadow of vapor, and now and again a low note of thunder, distant, trem
ulous as an organ strain, would roll across tne sea, as though some huge,
deep-throated beast, big as a hill and couchant behind the horizon, was
being irritated.
There was breeze enough to keep the schooner's sails full, and sunrise
found the Mowbray pursuing the course of the night. Captain Parry re
freshed himself with a bucket of cold green brine and tried to mako some
breakfast. Mr. Blundell ate heartily, and again as they sat at table they
argued upon the course to adopt should they find the eight seamen on
the wreck.
"If they've got Miss Vanderholt with them," said the mate, "I should
recommend asEing them to allow ns to receive her aboard â we ieaving
them aboard the wreck to be taken oft by the next thing that parses."
"I like that idea," said Captain Parry. "It would save bloodshed. We
want nothing but the young lady. They should be glad to get easily rid
of her as a witness. If they are short of food we can supply them with
stores enough to keep them going for a time that would allow of a reason
able chance of their being rescued."
"They'll want provisions anyhow," said the mate. "Stove limber
craft float on their cargo. You need to dive to get at the grub in those
derelicts. I'm counting upon hunger courting them into the schooner,
without obliging us to try what coaxing them with four men and two pis
tols is gong to do."
Tney went on deck and stared at the sea line through glasses. A little
before noon, just at the moment when Mr. Blundell was coming out of
his cabin with his sextant, a man stationed aloft on the lookout hailed
him.
"What is it?" shouted Blundell, springing through the companion
hatch.
"There is a black object away down upon the port bow. It looks like
a boat."
"How does it bear on the bow?" cried Blundeli.
"About two points," was his answer.
Mr. Blundell shifted his helm for it, but whatever it might bo it was
not yet vi-ible from the deck. The mate got an observation of the Â«un
and went below to work it out. When he returned he found Captain
Parry examining a dark objÂ«ct on the bow with a telescope.
"It's a ship's boat, most unquestionably," said the captain, turning
to Mr. Blundell.
The mate was at this instant hailed afresh from the masthead.
"There's another dark object about a point on the weather bow," said
the fellow, dangling hieh in air, his hoarse voice softening in falls as it
readied the ear from the hollows of the sails. "She'll be the wreck, Bir,"
he howled, after working away with his glas>.
Captain Parry was as pale as the dawn with excitement and expecta
tion. "I vow to God," said he, bringing his fist down on the raii, "I
would certainly lose my left arm witn cheerfulness to know at this instant
that Miss Vanderholt is alive and well in the timber-ship that chap
sighted and recoverable from her."
"If she is with them they'll ail come on beard together," said the
mate, with scarce conscious dryneas. 'Hunger and thirst will work their
way with beasts, let alone men.''
Little more was said while the schooner, driven by a five- knot breeze,
swept in long floating launches down upon the boat that came and went.'
There had been wind uomewbere, and a small swell rolled in from the
-ostward. running lightning flashes tn.-ough the water. No man could
**Â« it was the Mowbray's long boat till they had luffed and bliaken the
wind out of the schooner, close alongside the little fabric. Then her iden
tity was settled by a single glance at her through the glass. The yacht's
name, "Mowbray. London," was painted i.-i large black letters upon the
backboard in the stern sheets.
1 Stand by to hook her," shouted tÃe mate. A seaman aft, iumping
fora boathook in one of the quarter-boats, sprang into the little ledge o f
Old Ironsides. I
It was "Old Ironsides" that, after in* in
auspicious opening on land of the War of
1812, led off a series of splendid victories at '
sea. The honor of the first capture of a \
British war vessel undoubtedly belongs to ;
the Essex, Captain David Porter, whose de
feat of the Alert occurred six flays before
the Constitution destroyed the Guerriere.
But the Essex curried thirty-two guns,
and the Alert only eighteen; so that very I
coon after opening fire the crew of the lit
tie British craft were compelled to quit
their puns, and within eight minutes (o
strike their flag. This victory, though grat
ifying, was inevitable; whereas that of the
Constitution was gained over a craft nearer
her own size and strength. But, while
yielding the laurels of priority to the gal
lant Essex on this score, the Constitution,
under Captain Isaac Huil, can claim tnem
aeain for success in a trial of seamanship
between herself and a British squadron.
Till then affairs were looking gloomy for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 11, 1897.
the main chains; the schooner was slightly maneuvered; the boat w s
brought close alongside and captured. She was as empty and dry as an
old cocoanut shell.
"What does that signify ?" said Captain Parry.
"One of two thing*, clearly," an .-we red Brnndell. "Either they have
carried all the stores they left the yacht with aboard the wreck, or the
ship that picked them up emptied her before sending her adrift."
"Would tney let a valuable boat like her go?"
The mate shrugged his shoulders. There are some questions concern
ing the sea which even a sailor cannot answer.
"Do you see that her long painfor is trailing overboard?" exclaimed
Captain Parry, who remained while with excitement. "Does it not look
as if the knot had unhitched and let her slip away?"
"But from what, sir? That trailing length of rope mi^ht as easily
mean that she wa> let slip from a ship as that she slipped of her own ac
cord from a wreck."
This talk, uttered swiftly, occupied a minute while they overhung the
rail looking into the boat alongside.
"We must have her out of that," said tbe raatp, "and restow her."
The man who was hanging to her by the boathook, turning up a face
** He r 'Ighness the Duchess taught me how to behave myself in the eyes of royalty when I was a young f un, and
this is how it's done/ said he, giving Captain Parry a shove that drove him some feet from Miss Vanderholt.
as dark aa a new bronze coin, exclaimed: "There's something white
right aft jammed away flown under them stern sheets."
It was immediately wanted, of course, but the man with the boathook
could not get at it and keep a hold of the boat, too; so another man
jumped in and brought up a pocket handkerchief.
"It's a lady's," said the mate.
"It's Miss Vanderholt's," exclaimed Captain Parry, observing a small
"V. V." in the corner.
Two or three manes of blood stained it, as though the lip, nose or ear
had slightly bled.
"What does it betoken?" Baid Captain Parry, looking at the handker
chief and speaking softly, as though to himself. "If it is a memorial,
why in God's name should it come to me blood-stained?"
They got the boat aboard, all hand?, including Parry, pulling and
hauling at the tackles. "When she was chocked a course was shaped for
the derelict brig according to the instruction of the masthead man. It
was a time of thrilling anxiety for Parry. The handkerchief was no war
rant that the girl had been in the boat. They might have bound her and
drowned her at the side of the schooner and yet a handkerchief of hers
might have found its way into the boat. The hand Kerchief, then, proved
nothing. Nevertheless Parry found a sinister significance in the blood
marks. Was not this blood-statncd token most tragically portentous as
the only rel.c or memorial of his love that the sea had to offer him ? He
looked at it and in the wildness of his heart he made a meaning of itâ it
was a farewell to him, a message mute and eloquent; it said to him that
her father was slain and that she was lost to him forever. Thus he stood
interpreting the thing.
Shortly after 1 o'clock the derelict was in visw right ahead. The tele
scope then easily resolved her. She wa3 s. small black brig, with her
lower masts standing and bowsprit cone. She sat tolerably high, but
t
us at sea as well as on land. The Britisb
frigate Belvidere, while convoying a fleet
of merchantmen, had escaped from a whole
squadron of warships, whereas our Nau
tilus had struck to an English squadron,
being the first warship captured on
either Bide. Under these untoward cir
cumstances, tl.e Constitution, returning
from Europe, fell in with a British squad
ron lei by the Africa, a 64gun ship.
During four days she was chased by this
squadron. Through calm aud through
rolled with the sickly sluggishness of the water-logged huik. As the
schooner approached features of the wreck grew plain. She carried a
deckioad of lumber and her hold was eyidently full of timber. By some
desperate gale ehe had evidently been wrenched till her butts started, her
stron â¢ fastenings gave, her topmasts went and the green frothing seas
rushed in, drowning her into a lifelessness of helm. On board tte
schooner they could perceive no wreckage floating near. What sufferings
obscure and honible was that little wreck memorializing? The phantoms
of the imagination peopled her. White-face 4 men, dyinsr in squatting
positions, sat upon tho sea- broken dsckload of timber. There was no
captain, no comraani ; the ringers of famine had effaced distinctions.
Tnen one would die with a cioan. failing sideways, with his white eyes
glazine to the *un, and another would mutter in delirium and cull upon
the Lord Jesus Christ, and motion witb a ghastly smile to his mother
to make hasto with the delicious urink of coid water she was bringing
him.
Phantoms or no phantoms, all were gone. The wreck lay apparently
lifeless, absolutely abandoned, a yawning frame, sodden by weefca of
washing to and fro. Thus it seemed to the eyes aboard the schooner as
she drew closer and clo-er to the desolate, mournful, storm-broken fabric.
"There may be rats in the vessel," said the mate, with a countenance
made up of relief and extreme curiosity, "but I don't see them, Captain
Parry, neither do I see anything else that's living."
"A ship has token them oft," said Captain Parry in a tone of hopeless
misery, "and it may be months and years before I find out what is the
fate of Miss Vanderholt."
They were now within a musketshot of the wreck. The yacht's way
was arrested, and she seemed to stand at gaze with her people staring.
The long swell swung a dismal roll into the lifeless hull. A raffle of rig
ging hung over her sides, and whenever she roiled away she tore these up
from the water as if they had been Bea plants whose roots were a thou
sand fathoms deep; they rose hissing to the drag, ana sank like baffled
snakes when she came wearily over again. It made the heart sick to
watch her, to figure oneself as alone upon Ler, the loose tirubers clatter
ing through the Ion?, black ni^ht, the dark water welling in sobs along,
side, the twrol and soul-subduing spirit of stillness that lives in the tea
when is billows are silent, as though the hush in the central heart of the
profound ro^e like en emanation of wind or vapor, taking the senses of
the lonely one with the maddening; undertones of spiritual utterance.
Mr. Blundell continued to view the wreck through a glass. Captain
Pairy stood beside him with tightly lnldeil arms, death white with grief
and sickness of disappointment, and silent.
"There is nobody aboard that vessel, sir."
"I fear no!," the captain answered in a low voice.
'â¢The only place where people could find shelter," said the mate, "is
in that little green deckhouse. If there were eijrht men sitting in that
house, one would have seen ua, and all have tumbled out long ago."
"The long boat has told us the story." said the Captain. "They have
been t:iken on board another vessel. Is Miss Vanderhoit with them?"
He started as to a sudden acee fs of tenter and determination, and
said, "Biurdeli, j:ive me two of your men, and lower that boat. I'll
b oard that brig. I may lind something to i;ive us a clew."
"Put one of the revolvers in your pocket, fir," said Mr. Blundell.
A iioat was lowered and two men and Captain Parry, armeJ, entered

then to suspect an amLusn. Sltfl had oid-fashioi:ed channels, platforms

"If you will."
"Then, lcm, when we're out of it shove off fcr God's sake, and keep
cJear of thfm chain?. If they come down upon you, your life and the
boat ain't wor'h a drowned cockroach."
Watching his char.cc with great patience, Captain Parry sprang. Ke
stumbled, but with a wild nourish of his arm brought bis arm safely to
an iron belaying- pin in the rail above. He seized another hard by
and lifting bis knees to the rail gained the deck.
He stood holding on. The peculiar jerky rolling of the hull threat
ened to throw him, until a minute or two of sympathetic feeling into the
life of the fabric should have put some government of It into his legs.
The sailor had easily f jllowed.
Captain Parry was looking at the forepart of the vessel, which was a
horrible litter and muddle of heaped up timber and -mashed caboose,
when bis companion muttered in his ear in a low growl, "My God, mas
ter, there's a living man."
A living man it was, standing rigUt in the door of the deckhouse. He
was a seaman, and carried a strange face to those who looked at him,
though one might have said he should be familiar enough to anybo/iy
belonging to the schooner Mowbray. He was James Jones, the boatswain
of the yacht. Hi 3 cheeks were gaunt and i;rimy, and his eyes blazed in
their hollows. His hair lay in streaks over his ears and down the back of
his head, as though to repeated greasy tuggings and pullings. He was
without his coat, and his great muscular arms were bare to above iho
elbow.
Captain Parry recoiled a step, thrusting his hand into the pocket
where the pistol lay. He suspected this man to be one of the eight, and
that the seven would burst out in a minute.
"I'm Â«iâ d if ye ain't come just in the nick of time," said Jones, and
his grin and exhibition of yellow fangs, and Uis dirty skin and flaming
eyes made his face horrible. "I tell ye what I've just found out. There
ain't no death. How do I Know that? says you. Why, ye see, a man
ain't dead till he die?, and when he's dead death ain't got no existence for
him. D'ye see it?'" said he with an inimitable leer.
captain Parry saw that he was mad, but in t"he moment of detectingl
his he observed something more. Behind the madman, looking over his
breeze the flight and ha pursuit went on.
At one time she had i^-tiout towing her;
at another time her crew were Hauling
upon a kedge anchor that had been car
ried out ana dropped a long distance
ahead. On the fourth day the longed-for
wind came, and, with every sail set, the
Constitution drew away from her pur
suers. Some of the historians describe
that as the first of our triumphs on the
sea in that war.
But in our time, of course, the fame of
the Constitution is more familiarly asso
ciated with hei capture of the Guerriere.
It was on August 19. 1812, tdat the two
vessels met, both eager for a tight. The
scene was off the coast of Massachusetts.
The British craft was first to open fire,
but Hull maneuvered his vessel into the
right position bsfore he replied.
The enemy's mizzenmast soon went
by the board, followed by her
mainmast. When she struck colors
she was so completely used up that she
shoulder, stood Miss Vanderholt. She was robed in white anÂ«i wore a
small straw hat. Sac was pale, as though exhausted, perhaps t-om the
want of food or drink; otherwise, but for her impassioned, transfccming
gaze, she looked as though she had but now come with Captain Par-y to
view l he wreck.
1 0!i, Violet, my dear one, Violet, I have found you," cried Perry, and
he rushed toward her.
She surieked, standing still and clasping her hands and looking up to
God.
"There's no admission 'ere," roared tne madman, barricading the
door by extending his arms. "This is a royal yacht. Why don't you
cast your eyes alofc and view the royal standard a-flying? The Prinoess
Victoria is within. Don't I know her gracious mother, the Duchess?
I'm an English sailor, and I'm loyal to my native country. God save the
King." Saying which he turned and bowed with every mark of profound
veneration to Miss Vanderholt.
"Let me pass, man," cried Captain Parry, pulling out his revolver
antf hustling the powerful fellow.
"Hide it !" screamed Violet. "He is mad. He has been kind to me.
Ob, God, George, am I dreaming? Is it you in the flesh, or am I mad,
too?"
bhe put her hands to her eyes, and reeled to a stanchion, against which
she leaned. The madman continued to barricade the door, both huge
arms extended.
"Look here," cried Parry almost a3 mad as the seaman he confronted
with impatience, infuriated by this heliish lunatic obstruction, wild to
clasp the girl whose reel and motion of hands had stabbed his heart, "we
want to get at this younpr lady at once to take her on board yonder
schooner. Make way, for God's sake. I'll hear all about your views on
death when we're comfortable aboard the vessel."
"There's no blooming man," shouted the madman, "a-going to ap
proach the Princess Victoria without falling down upon his bended knees
and crawling to her feet as the custom is at St. J&ines Palace."
Mis-s Vanderholt went into hysterics. She shrieked with langhter,
she sobbed as if heart was breaking.
"I think you'd better go down uDon your knees, Â«ir," said trie sailor
who had accompanied Parry. "Here, my lad," said he, crooking his
finger into a fishhook at the man. "You just make way for the gent to
crawl to her gracious 'ighness, and while he's kow-towing give me that
there yarn of yourn about death."
He winked at tne captain, who sank upon his knees. The scene was
groteEque, tragic, extraordinary. The boatswain watched the figure o*
the captain with fiery suspicion while he passed on all fours through the
door of the deckhouse. Alias Vanderholt was still in hysterics.
"Damn the rufiian, I can't stand it,' 1 shouted the captain, and he
sprang to his feet and clasped the girl.
Miss Vanderhoit lay in her lover's arms weeping and laughing, but a_
few kisses and murmurs oi devotion produced a sood effect. She con
trolled herself and then they were able to talk in s>wift questions and
eager answers. Outside the mad sailor continued to argue with the
sailor on thesubjpctof death.
"There ain't no death," he roared, with all the strength of his throat.
"D'ye call it a good job, man? Here stands the man as has pot rid of the
terror of the world. Hark you, bully. Ye can turn in now without fear
ing to die. It'll do away with prayers, for there ain't no death."
"Let's get awoy lrom t. is wreck." said Parry, clasping the girl's hand.
"Yet, what a wonderful meeting," he cried, devouring her with his eyes.
"What a miraculous deliverance. Gh, the hand of God is in it, and I am
gratefulâ l am grateful."
They moved toward the door, and the madman saw them coming.
"Look here," he cried, making for them in a jump or two, with an air
so menacing that Pany's hand instantly sought his pistol. "No man
walks alongside the Princess Victoria aboard this royal yacht. Her 'ieh
ness the Duchess tauebt me how to behave myself in the eye of royalty
when I was a young 'un, and this* is how it's done," said he, giving Dap
tain Parry a shove that drove him some feet from Miss Vanderholt ; then,
stepping in front of the girl, he bowed low, with all those marks of abject
veneration which had distinguished his former obeisance, and saying,
"It j'our 'ighness will now step our," he moved backward; but a long
plank lay athwart li is path; the captain and the seaman saw what was to
happen; th? madman fell heavily backward over it.
"Bring the boat alongside, Jim." bawled the sailor. "This is the ryle
yacht. Scathe standard a- flying? The Princess Victoria is aboard, and
we've pot to back her into the boat, according to the custom of the court
of St. James Palace."
The boatswain was up again, and, flourishing his hand, he cried,
"Eight! Right!"
â¢'You leave him to me, sir," said the sailor with a look at Captain
Parry, who was absolutely at a loss. He would not for a million have
shot tho unhappy madman, and yet ho durst not approach Miss Vander
holt while that huge and brawny lunatic watched him.
The seaman in the boat concluded that his shipmate had lost his
' mind. What the blooming blazes, he thought to himself, is Bill a- jawing
about with bis ryle yachts and ryle standards? And he looked right up
into the sky.
"Stand by now, Tom, to receive her ryle 'ighness," shouted the sailor,
with a giance at the madman. "As her 'ighness must go first, there's no
barm, I hope," said he, "in walking face foremost ?'*
"She always do," shouted the boatswain. "Bow her to the rail and
hand her over."
Nothing could have been better. The swell gave them a gooo. deal of
trouble; but two of them were sailors, and presently Miss Vanderholt was
in the boat. Captain Parry sprang into the chains and, watching his op
portunity, leaped, and was by his sweetheart's side in a minute.
The madman overhung the rail, staring greedily. He knuckled his
brow as one who would drive a pain out of his brain^ then began to iaugh
when Captain Puny sprang into the boat, and talked to himself.
"Bring him along, Bill. You lay he'll know what to do," cried tha
sailor in the boat.
"Her ryle 'lghness commands yoa to attend her, sir," sai.d the sea
man. "Step right over the side into the chains, and don't jump back
ward."
The boatswain dre w biiuself st ffly erect, and after gazing aloft at the
vision ot the standard , which blew in rich folds under the swelting clothes
to his insane eye, he exclaimed, "Who's going to look after her ryle 'high
ness' yacht if I leave her?"
'She'll He quiet enough, mate, till you return," said the sailor.
"Hark. Her ryle 'ighness is a-calling of you."
"Pray, attend upon me. I command your presence in this boat,"
cried the girl in the loudest, most imperious voice her condition would
permit her to manage.
The poor creature bowed low over the rail, then in silence dropped
into the chains, followed by the sailor, and in a minute or two both were
seated in the boat. All went quietly. The boatswain shifted restlessly
in his seat with a grin of superstition. His burning eyes rolled over the
iiowbrav, and again and again he pulled his hair with hands that sweated
like tallow.
Miss Vanderholt's first exclamation when she was handed over the
side was "My father, my poor father." And then she began to cry. The
dreadful scene rose before her mental vision and she shook with old sen
sations of terror. Captain Parry, parsing his arm through hers, gently
and tenderly led her below. She had been too much moved to address
Mr. Blundell, and, for a little while, she needed the privacy of the cabin
and her lover's company. Presently, while they sat below, she told Cap
tain Parry the story of the mutiny and her adventures up to this hour.
It <seems that some of the men were for going away at once in the
long boat after scuttling the yacht. Others were for letting her lie afloat,
but all agreed that she must bÂ« abandoned. Then Miss Vanderholt
found out tbatthey were undecided what they should do with her. Most
of them, she gathered, were for leaving her in the yacht to take her
chance of being picked up. "Why not?" said they. "We can shorten
sail for her before we leave. We can lash the helm amidships. She's
got plenty to eat and drink. She can't come to hurt in these waters and
is bound to be rescued."
But the boatswain, who had grown ferocious in temper, and had
manifested many symptoms of insanity, swore that she should not be
abandoned to her fate. She was an English woman â he was an English
seaman. By God, he would brain any man who talked of leaving the
poor young lady alone, to wash about in the schooner.
She told Captain Parry that this Jones overawed the men, and they
seemed to treat him as though his madness made him superior to them
selves. The boatswain next morning went quite mad and took Miss Van
derhoit to be Princess Victoria. He bowed humbly to her in the boat; he
would sometimes kneel to her. He whipped a straw hat off a man's head
to shade her with. His hallucination was fortunately a sober one. He sup
posed the men to be the crew of the cutter of some royal yacht or other and
himself in command, seeking the vessel that her gracious highness, as he
frequently called, might sail round the world. When they fell in with
the derelict they were exhausted with the scorching heat and the ex
posure by night, and determined to take shelter and rest auoara and sig
nal for help, if help should heave into view. They emptied the long boat
Out that same evening of their entering the derelict, about an hour before
sundown, a small brigantine leisurely came flapping down upon them

Not lone afterward it was discovered that this brigantine was a
Frenchman ; that her crew had mutinied and sent her captain and mate
adrift, and that, though they perceived :he figures of the boatswain and
the young lady on the brig, yet, on the Mowbray's men telling them that
one could bear witness to the mutiny and that the other was a dangerous
madman, they put up their helm and sailed away.

In one of the charming villas at Belve
dere lives George W. Miller, who, some
thing more than forty years ago, was first
lieutenant of the volunteer company
raised at Port Orford, Or., to aid the regu
lars in the defense of homes and the sup
pression of the Indians in wtiat is called
the Rogue River Indian war.
An allusion to thÂ« massacre in a recent
publication has awakened in his mind
personal reminiscences of that struggle,
in which a little band of whites success
fully resisted the desire for their exter
mination which lurked in the breast of
old Chief John of the Tootootneys.
Port Orford was at that time a collec
tion of perhaps a dozen bouses, with the
fort, in which Major Reynolds of the
United States army was stationed with
possibly thirty-tive regular soldiers.
"The cause of the outbreak was, un
doubtedly, a system of indignities pmc
ticed upon the Indians by a number of
lawless whites," said Mr. Miller to bis
visitor from The Call.
"One of the outrages bitterly resented j
by them was that of robbing their burial
grounds of the boards wiih which it was
customary for them to protect each grave.
These boards were hewn with much labor
from great cedar trees and wiin tools tbat
a carpenter would have scorned. They
were from a foot to two feet in width and
of various lengths.
"Whenever lumber for certain purposes
was needed, there were those in the com
munity who did not hesitate to appropri
ate tbe nicely finished boards, without re
gard for the sacred significance applied to
them by their lawful owners. Protesta
tions upon the part of the Indians or set
tlers po.-sessing a sense of justice were met
with either insult or indifference.
"At that time there was no dearth of
tbe flotsam which society ever casts upon
the frontier. A certain number of young
men, whose ages ranged from 25 to 30,
were banded together and gave full play
to any lawless inclination without regard
for consequences. They affected the long
haired, buckskin-suited style of the dime
novel hero. Some of them deferred to the
Indian law of purchasing their 'squaw
wives; others defied the custom, and, in
timidating friends and relatives into re
linquishing the -'juaws on wnom their
fancy liglited, bore tnem away after the
fashion of barbaric conquerors.
'â¢Before the feeling generated by these
and other indignities had arisen the In
dians were peaceful and friendly. On
finding that their primitive shell coin
could not purchase the white man's sup- '
j .ies they willingly gave labor in ex
TRYING A "CHLOROFORM SPREE'
A young woman from New York, with
â whom I became acquainted while she
was visiting San Francisco and stopping;
at one of the City hotels, de
scribed to me a "chloroform spree,'
which she declared was in vogue
among some fashionable women in the
East, and which "came nearer to being a
bit of nirvana to order" than anything
else she knew.
I determined to indulge in one of these
"sprees" for "an experience." I have had
the experience!
I stopped at the drugstore nearest my
home, and, with what I trusted seemed
like my usual unconcerned and rather
superior manner, asked the dapper clerk
for '"four bits' worth of chloroform." He
looked at me with wild but decidedly dis
composing surprise.
'llow much of what, Miss?" he asked,
and when I repeated my order with sever
ity, conscious that my ears were beginning
to burn furiously, he disappeared behind
tne fence erected to conceal him and hie
associates from the public eye when en
gaged in putting up prescriptions.
Evidently he consulted the proprietor
in his lair, for he returned looking trou
bled and interrogative, though smiling I
feebly.
"What did you say you wanted it for.
Miss?" he asked, and my face turned the
color of an overripe tomato. "What did I
want it for, indeed ? I certainly could not
confide my intentions to him, so 1 grasped
at the first nebular idea which floated
across my confused brain.
"For my cat, of course," I answered
with asperity, and my questioner looked
relieved.
â¢'Concluded to do away with old Tom?"
he said cheerily. "That's all right, of
course, but we have to be particular, you
see. I can't sell you that much anyway
withont a prescription, but 10 cents' worth
will do thÂ« business all right."
And then while he was making a thing
o! beauty out of the small bottle by means
ol snowy paper and pink string he toid
me just how to arrange matters so as to
make poor old Tom'> taking off a painless
certainty, and I departed smiling.
Arrived at home I made my prepara
tions with eager baste, and Jying upon my
couch uncorked the vial and tipped it up
on my handkerchief two or three times.
Then I pulled the cover up over my
head and snuggled down among the pil
lows to enjoy my "bit of Nirvana."
TJgh! Was ever anything so intensely,
burningly, disgustingly sweet as the smell
of that chloroform?
I shuddered from head to foot as the
first whiff of it went up my nostrils. The
second sniff was not so bad. At the third
I became conscious oi a singular rhytnm
ical buzzing and throbbing, faint and
far off. to which I seemed compelled to
listen with the greatest intentness, and
which grew momentarily louder and
louder until it seemed like the deafening
rush and roar and rattle of a locomotive
coming at full speed through a lon
tain tunnel.
A thick cloud of pitchy smoke seemed
surrounding and half-suffocating me, and
then suddenly a shower of tiny fiery
sparks glittered ana danced in the dark
ness like millions of fairy fireflies.
The roaring grew fainter and fainter,
ana became again a rhythmical murmur!
a droning undertone, to the vibrations of
which the sparks beean to arrange them
selves, ac fine sand does on a sheet of glass

by the squaws, who dug gold or helped in
unloading vessels when taey ventured
into the dangerous, breaker-beset harbois.
"The Indians were four years preparing
for the war which they fancied would rid
them of the whites and avenge their
wrongs.
"Sea otter were at tbat time plentiful
and numbers were caught by the Indians.
The usual price paid by the traders for a
skin was three rifles, and in ttus way arms
and ammunition ware purchased. These
were carefully cached for the contemplated
outbreaK.
"The greater part of the guns traded to
the Indians were what was termed the
j United States auger gun. These were
; short-barreled affairs holding an ounce
j ball, which was discharged with a rotary
motion. The cash price paid for this gun
was $12.
"Wben rumors of impending trouble
were noised about, the traders, the ma
jority of whom were what is termed
squaw men, remarked with complacency
that under any circumstances they had no
cause to fear the Indians, as the presence
of their squaws was a protection. It was
significant that these traders were the
first to fall victims to the wrath of the
savages, and were all mercilessly tor
tured. The most prominent among them
was Ben Wright, known as an Indian
fighter, who for such services drew a pen
sion from the Government. The succes
sive slaughter of other weli-known char
acters followed and soon brought us to a
realization tbat a bloody war was full
upon us. Plans for resistance were soon
put into operation. A numoer of men in
whaieboats started to ail the settlers liv- j
ing at the mouth of Rogue' River. The
effort was futile, as the Indians attacked
them when about to land, killing all save
one of their number, who escaped to the
fort. Among them was a merchant named
Jerome, who bad taken advantage of tbe

A moment or two and the bits of lire, as
they raneed themselves side by aide, lost
their individuality and. merging into each
other, became an intricate lacework of
golden threads hanging between me and a
dusky background, which now began to
glow with a soft crimson radiance, deepen
ing to purple, then brightening to vivid
scarlet, as if a forest fire were raging
fiercely but fitfuliy behind a light screen
of drifting fog.

The shimmering meshes of the lace grew
finer and closer. The glitter and glow
faded, and before me hung a priceless
i>iece of rare old tapestry, a marvel of de
sign and workmanship, in which the
colors were softened and harmonized and
blended as only time himseif can soften

gazed upon it with wondering delight a
creeping shiver passed over it, spoiling its
beauty, as a sudden squall roughens and
darkens the clear surface of a lake.

A sudden sense came to me that every
thing around me was made of the same
material, that I myself was covered with
a chenil.e-like fur, and that my fingers
were pieces of thick chenille stiffened
with bits of wire.
The droning undertone of sound-beats
gathered force and volume until it be-
came once again a rushing, roaring, pur
suing terror.
The heavy curtain swung toward me as
though a strong wind was blowing
against it from behind, and as it came
nearer a great wave of disgust and horror
swept over me, for I saw that the whole
fabric was composed not of chenille but of
millions of earthworms, which began

stretching out and contracting until the
entire drapery was a revolting mass of in

"The story has often been told of the
construction of canvas boats in which the
soldiers reached the opposite shore under
protection of howitzers planted upon the
bank above them, and of the destruction
by them of immense stores of dried fish,
which at that season of the year formed
the chief article of Indian food. The ber
ries upon which they might have subsisted
had not yet ripened, and their attempts to
catch further supplies of fish were frus

them in the face, and a dreadful scourge
of Bickness, caused by lacs of food, set in

to envelop and stifle me in its horrid
crawling folds. The rushinc roar came
closer and closer. A sudden blast of air,
cold and dank, as if it came from a char
riel-hou^e, struck against me with lrre
s:stible force, and I felt myself falling.
I caucht desperately at the lower fringe
of the living curtain, but the slimy, twist
ing strands slipped through my fingers or
broke in my gra-p, and then
I opened my eyes to find myself lying
limpiy over the arm of the sofa, with my
brother-in-law and the doctor bending
over me, slapping my hanas and shaking
and rolling me about with a vigor which
was decidedly painful.
I was deluged with cold water. There
was a choking smell of ammonia in the
air. The windows were wide ot>en, and
my sisier wan in the midst of a frenzied
attack of hysterics in a near-by armchair,
under the sympathetic care of the parlor

Let us pcss over the scene that followed
my return to consciousness. It seems
that instead of "behaving like an angel"
I bad groaned so sepulchrally that some
one had come in to see what was the mat
"When General Buchanan sent word
for Chief John's surrender, the Indian re
plied that througti necessity be yielded
to the great Tyee's command. When the
order was given for them to leave the
vicinity for the more fruitful northern
reservation a chief called Tagnatia sor
rowfully protested.
" 'I was born here,' said he, 'and here
I hope to lay my bones when I die. I
hare always befriended the whites and in
my heart is no enmity toward them.'
His request was unheeded and with the
Indians well known to be hostile he was
commanded to take hi 9 departure.
"Tagnatia was an Indian of line phys
ique, being fully 6 feet tall, of a benevo
lent and intelligent countenance. He was
noted among his people for his ingenuity,
and among other useful tilings could make
an excellent saddle similar to those used
by the Mexicans.
"When the Indians, some 1500 in num
ber, took their departure they passed
through the lines of the soldiers stationed
at Port Orford. They formed a procession
which was the personification of wretch
edness, poverty and despair. Old men
and women were led in ttieir blindness by
younger members of their tribe or family.
Women weak iron* sickness bore heavy
burdeus or children upon their bacKs.
Wolf-eyed warriors stepped with an air of
naughty nonchalance and a look of baf

of children crept along, ragged, dirty, piti
ful; aud leading his people was Chief
John, mounted hi on a sorry mate, a look
of indifference on his face, his eyes, which
seemea to observe nothing, fixed straight
before him.
"Port Orford was never attacked by the
Indians, though scouts were often sent by
mem to take account of and report any
opportunity for slaughter. These scoots
traveled at night, running swiftly upon
the beach and in the water's edge to hide
their footprints. In spite of this precau
tion, however, they were usually seen by
the watchful sentinels and a shot sent
t&em precipitately into the sea.
"A number of peculiar incidents of that
bloody period remain in the memory alter
the general dark background has worn
dim. At the beginning of the outbreak, I
remember, a blockhouse, two stories in
eight and lorty-tive feet sauare, was
built on the outskirts of the little town;
in this blockhouse families found shelter
at night.
"There had been no indication of the
presence of Indians for some time, and
one of the families, growing tired of the
constant moving to and fro, decided lo re-
ter, and jumpinz to the conclusion that I
had tried to commit suicide had made

A Qeorgia Negro Prodigvj.
Robert Gardhire is a negro and an un
educated one, but when it comes to figures
he can't be stopped by any mathemati
cian in the world. He is a humble resi
dent of Augu-ita, and is employed as a
jaborer at the Interstate Cotton Oil Com
pany. In multiplication Gardhire is as
quick as thought. Before the average
person can set the figures down with a
pencil Gardhire has given the correct an
swer, and yet he cannot say how he
does it.
He was asked what wr.a the sum total of
99 limes 67, and without repeating the fig
ures to himself, Gardhire answered otf
nand '6633." "How much," asked some
one, "is 501 times 32?" Without stopping
a second Gardhire replied, "16,032." And
thus for over half an hour numbers were
thrown at him and he gave the correct
multiplication like a flash. In the multi
plication of fractions the man is equally
prohcient, and there seems no limit to his
powers, which are almost occult.
Gardbire cannot remember when he first
became aware of his power and does not
even know how he discovered it. He says
that when the figures are given him ne
sees their answer immediately. Simply
by glancing at a long line of figures he
can tell immediately what the addition, is.
Augusta Chronicle.
I main at home upon a certain night. Be
fore morning, however, an alarm of In
dians wai sounded, and the husband and
wife, each catching up a child, started for
the blockhouse.
"They had gone bnt a short distance
when it was discovered that some much
needed belonging had been forgotten. The
husband decided to return, bidding his
wife hasten on to the blockhouse, which
there was two ways of reaching from their
dwelling â one a short cut through the
thick bushes, and the other by a wagon
road.
"The wife chose the former, while in
returning the husband took the road. Not
overtaking her the safety of his wife ana
child weighed upon his mind, and the
necessity of silence was entirely forgot
ten.
"He loudly called her name and she,
though realizing the danger of such au
outburst, felt compelled to answer.
"Her exact location and the progress
she was making next caused him anxiety,
and his call was repeated. As expostula
tion was impossible the wife again re
lieved his anxiety by. loudly calling her
answer. So through the strip of wood
land they went proclaiming themselves
an easy prey to the tavages, who ioriu
nately for them were biding their time or
committing depredations elaewhere."
Although surrounded by dangers the
younger portion of the community felt the
need of amusement, and a dance was ac
cordingly given.
They congregated in the only hall the
place afforded, stationed pickets to guard
against surprises, and, stacking their arms
conveniently at hand, proceeded to enjoy
themselves to the accompaniment of a
brace of fiddles.
As young children formed an -import
ant part of the community, and nurses
were not a feature of the frontier, each
mother participating in the gayety â and
youag mothers were in the majority
among the women â placed her child upon
a convenient bed in the dressing-room
and unincumbered joined the dance.
One of the babies so disposed of is to

ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY
An Brcheological specimen has been
presented to the University of Pennsyl
vania by the Bucks County Historical
Society which proves that the symbol of
the cross was known and used in ancient
America before the birth of Christ. The
importance of tne facts proven by this
relic of ancient days was first made known
by Henry C. Mercer, curator of the sec
tion of American and prehistoric arch
aeology of the Museum of Science and Art
of the univeri-ity. The object which has
demonstrated the interesting facts stated
is a spindle whorl.
This whorl or weight used to eive mo
mentum to the ipindle-stick, a thin rod
about a foot long pushed lor an inch or
more through an orifice in the center of
the whorl. In discussing thosa facts Pro-
Strange Spindle Whorl Just Unearthed From a Pre-Columbian Grave With the
Symbol of the Cross, Proving That It Was Known in Ancient America
Before the Birth of Christ

fessor Mercer said to the writer: "The
thread material used in this spindle at
tached to a distaff held in the left hand
ran to the spindle, whicn being twirled on
the knee and being left free to act, spun
or wound the thread. These whorls prove
a strange coincidence in the thread
making processes in the Old and New
Worlds. Dr. Schliemann found several
thousand whorls at Hissariik and, strange
to say, many of them were decorated with
the swastika or bent armed cross. Others
were markeil with the ordinary cross. By
the bent-armed cross is meant a cross
which resembles two letter Z's, one placed
across the other just as if each was a single
bar.
"Some of the Mexican spindle whorls
are marked with dosses, but none show
toe design in its symbolic form so clearly
as the specimen which I brought to light
ests of its law-abiding citizens in depriv
ing them of fertile and accessible landa
and bestowing them upon the unwilling
Indians, who preferred the thick woods
and barren shores from which they were
driven and which wore best suited for
their savage needs.
"God made that wild country for the
Injuns,"' declared Mr. Miller in conclu
sion, "and the Government made a fool of
itself in driving them away and giving
them land that the white man was bound
to need some day." Clara Iza Price.
Where Qarfield Was Shot.
The marble tablet thai rested in the
south wall of the ladies' waiting-room of
the Baltimore and Potomac Railway Com
pany's depot and the brass star placed in
the tiled flooring of the apartment to mark
the spot where President Garfield fell
when assassinated have been removed.
A superstitious dread on the part of the
traveling public of a constant reminder of
a tragedy seems to have led to the removal
of these monuments. The immediate
cause of the removal of the tablet and star
was the fire which occurred in the depot
on the ni^ht of March 4, which damaged
the table: to such an extent that the offi
cials of the company declared it was not
in condition to be replaced.
A portion of the marble tiling also had
to be removed, and although the metal
star placed where the President fell micht
have been put back in its old place, it was
permanently removed, and the spot is
now marked only by a piece of red tiling,
which would pass unnoticed except to
those familiar with the place and the
tragedy that was enacted there.
Officials of the company stated that
there was no purpose in removin<* the
monum-nts except that they haa been
damaged by fire. From otner sources it
was learned that there had been much
complaint on tha part of the travei
ing public of having the horrors of the
assassination constantly recalled to their
minds when going through the depot or
waiting for trains. To such an extent has
this feeling prevailed that the company
has long regarded the reminder of the
tragedy as a disadvantage, and it is be
lieved by many that the officials were only
too glad to have an excuse to obliterate
the monuments. â St. Louis Globe-Demo

the specimenâ by J. W. Detweilerof Beth

Valley, in the Republic of Colombia. Hera
the idea of cross symbolism in ancient
America, rather than mere decoration by
means of intersecting lines, is well
Drought out by the eight smaller crosses
between the arms of the central cross.
"To my mind the specimen shows â
First, the cross symbol eiia:ed in ancient
America before the coming of Christian
ity; second, the cross symbol carved on a
spindle whorl by ancient Americans in
just the same manner as ancienv Asiatics
and Europeans had carved crosses on
spindle v.-horls before the birth of Chris
tianity; third, the identity of a peculiar
process for spinning in the Old and New
Worlds before the discovery of America
by Columbus."
A study of the face of the whorl found
in South America shows it to be ot ex

is the result of the labor of the people who
inhabitateu that part of South America

NEW YORK, N. V., April 5.-After
weeks of sackcloth and ashes it it but
fitting that all mankind shonid clasp
hands with nature and don the trayesl
colors which spring can proffer us. Never
have the great shops of New York seemed
iO alluring and enticing as now. Through
the expansive plate-glass windows throngs
of men, women and children gaze in
wrapt wonder at the t,o r Keous colorings of
the new gowns and spring-flower mil
| linery. The silks are striking in their
multicolored designs, and look fresh from
the brush of an "impressionist" artist.
The organdies and grenadines are dream
like in their sheer and dainty beauty.
Never before has the sterner sex been
treated to such tempting rainbow hues as
now, when Easter outfits for their women
folk will tax the weight of their purses.
Their neckwear is shown in the liveliest
plaids and stripes, green, pink, yellow and
red predominating. Their shirts are
startling in pattern and coloring. Of
course only the chappies and flashily in
clined will affect these freaks of the haber
dasher's fancy. However, I, for one, do
not believe that all our men should look
like clergymen or undertakers. I often
wish they could wear the satin knee
breeches and siiken hose their forefathers
carried with such dignity; besides, the
broad expanse of waistcoat, the fluted shirt
ruffles and the high stock and collar were
so becoming to those gallant beaux and
brave gentlemen.
"Californta looks like an Oriental in
terior at this time of year," says Miss
Mildred Wilccx of New York, who has
come direct from Menlo Park, where she
has been visiting relatives. "Never have
I seen such wonderful wildflowers, sucn
masses of fruit-tree blossoms. The foot
bills seem to be hidden underneath
gorgeous Turkish rugs, so wondrous are
the yellow poppies and the white and
blue flowers as they peep and nod above
the green grain and grasses. California
seems like another world." Miss Wilcox
declares that she will return to California
to live, even tnough her father and
mother refuse to make such a change.
She hints at having left her heart some
where near the dear old oaks at Menlo.

The last weeks of Lent are usually
crowded with farewell receptions, musi
cales, church fairs, etc., and any one in
the swim must be wide awake and full of
warm health to be able to attend half of
the pleasant affairs. One of the most de
lightful receptions of the season was given
lnat Friday by Mr. and Mrs. Theodore
Sutro at their home, 20 Fifth avenue. The
large drawine-roomi were crowded from
4to 7 o'clock with a moving throng of
friends. It was their last reception for
this season, and Mr. and Mrs. Sutro have
reason to be proud of their success in
bringing together snch a brilliant assem
blage. Mrs. Sutro is a beautiful woman
and a magnetic hostess, and the grace
with whioh she always receives her guests
nas made her one of the envied.
Among those who attended the Satro
reception last Friday afternoon were a
score of names well known in California,
prominent among may be mentioned Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles, Hon. Warner Mil
ler. Mr. and Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs, Miss
Virginia Fair; Albert Bierstadt, the cele
brated artist, who has painted so many
Yosemite scenes; General Horace Porter
Mr. and Mrs. George Gould, Mrs. King'
don, and Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Gould
Colonel and Mrs. Richard Henry Savage
and Colonel G. L. Giilespie, U. S. A., who
for several years was an officer a: the Pre
sidio. The programme for the afternoon
was exceptionally entertaining and in
liea of an absent singer, who Had
beer, detained by illness, Mr. butro in his
affable style volunteered to Bing a song
himself, for which he received nearty and
deserved applause. Mr. and Mrs. Sutro
have paid several visits to their distin
puis ied brother, the Hon. Adolph Sutro
of San Francisco, and during their pro
tracted stay made a ho?tof loyal friends.
About the first of May they will move to
their house on the picturesque Riverside
drive.
Hon. M. H. de Young is a guest at the
Waldorf, having arrived on Wednesday.
He seemed in the bust of health and

of well-known politicians and diplomats
the other evening in the hotel.
Mrs. John Lyttleton Lyon, wno was a
resident in San Francisco and San Jose
for many years, is permanently located at
the Hotel Normandie.
It may be more than a passing note of
interest to the gentle ladies to know that
the gaudy red hats which have made their
appearance on the millinery horizon Gave
already had tneir doom sounded by the
artistic modistes on Fifth avenue. The
all-red hat is certainly very pretty and un
usual, on either a decided blonde or bru
nette, but when the hundred Sixth-avenue
stores fill their windows full of red mil
linery, the ultra - fashionable set turn
quickly to some more conventional shade.
Adolphe, the artist milliner, who has
made Miss Annie L. Stone's Fifth-avenue
store so popular, emphatically frowns on
the crimson hats because they are so
common. Beautiful combinations of gray
in different tones are the latest Parisian
effects and as the steel, mauve, pearl and
creamy grays are becoming to the majority
of women they will be the prevailing taste
for Easter bonnets â that ia what Adolphe
says and he knows.
Nosegays of different flowers and of
all hues will be extremely stylish this
season. Francois and Louise are combin
ing pink and black, yellow and gray,
purple, red and blue, all of which will be
becoming to certain types of beauty.
Jeweled Dins and laces are to ba worn
in the E:ister and spring millinery, j^ong
carriage veils are the latest things im
ported. They are ially two and a half
yards long and should be tied at the back
of the hat in a large loose bow however,
many ladies prefer to tie them under the
chin.
Mrs. Leila Ellis and her young daugh
ter, Miss L. Owen Ellis of San Francisco,
gave a "recital dramatic" at the residence
of Mrs. Gilbert Jones, 222 Madison ave
nue, Friday evening. It was attended by
about 100 guests, who received the new
comers with much applause and enthusi
asm. Among the several selections Mrs.
Ellis gave her recitation of "Count Gis
mond," by Robert Browning, was the
most artistic and delightful. Miss Ellis,
who has made a study of children's little
peculiarities of speech, recited Eugene
Field's poem, "Seem* Things," in an in
imitable style, which created much laugh
ter and won for Mis* Ellis many sincere
admirers. She is excellent in more seri

Song," was tenderly expressed.
William Osterman and Mrs. Osterman
of San Jose are having an enjoyable visit

ORDER CHOSEN FRIENDS.
The Grand Council of California
Will Meet in This City
Next Tuesday.
An Effort Will Be Made to Change
From Annual to Biennial Sessions.
Candidates fcr Grand Officers.
The annual session of the Grand Coun
cil of the Order of Chosen Friends will
commence next Tuesday and continue
two or three days.
As there has been unusual activity in
the order in the past six months there
will be a full representation from all the
councils, as appears from the credentials
received at the office of the grand re
corder.
There will be considerable legislation,
but the most important will be the effort
to have biennial instead of annual sessions
of the grand body. Those who favor the
proposition of a session every two years
urge that the mileage and per diem ac
count makes a heavy inroad on the treas
ury and that a portion of this money
could be used to advantage to build up
and extend the order in this jurisdiction.
The first day will be devoted to the pre
sentation of the reports of the grand offi
cers, and in the evening there will be a
union initiation in Union-square Hall, and
prizes are to be awarded to the councils
presenting the greatest number of candi
dates for membership.
During the six months the order in this
State shows a net gain in membership of
180 members. In vhe past year six coun
cils were instituted, one each at San Luis
Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Bel
mont, Chico and Elk Grove, with a mem
bership aggregating 208.
On the 31st of last December the order
had in this State 6276 members in good
standing and quite a number have been
added since then.
During the session there will be an elec
tion of grand officers, and the candidates
for principal officersare: Forcrandcoun
cilor, Max Boehm, the incumbent, who,
up to this time, nas no opponent; for
grand assistant councilor, \V. H. Savage
of San Pedro and E. R. Tiel of Sacra
mento; for grand vice-councilor, D. J.
Hartley of Sacramento; for grand re
corder, S. C. Wallis, without an opponent;
for grand treasurer, Miss Clara McDon
ald, incumbent; for grand prelate, Mrs.
C. J. Sweeney, at present grand marshal.
For the minor offices there are any num
ber of candidates.
The present grand officers of the Cali
fornia jurisdiction are:
Grand councilor, M. Boehm; grand assistant
councilor, W. fl. Pratt; grand vice-councilor,
E. R. Tiel; grand recordei. S. C. Wallis; grand
treasurer, Miss Clara McDonald; grand pre
late, Mrs. K. C. Cos grove; grand marshal. Mrs.
Clara J. Sweeney; grand warden, Mrs. Lizzie
Morse; grand guard, Mrs. M. A. Borland;
grand sentry. Lemuel Biddle ; past grand coun
cilor, T. H. Selvage.

Chinese Had theJPaperg.
There was a scurry and a hurry in the United

had come in by way of British Columbia with
the intention of evading the Chinese exclu

the Chinese, and to his disappointment found
that the four Mongolians were provided with

The passengers on the southbound
North Pacific Coast train from Point
Reyes, last Thursday afternoon, witnessed
a remarkable ride by a San Rafael wheel
man. The cycler ieit Laeunitas at the
same time the train did, dashed up and
down the small inclines at a headlong
Rait, climbed Whites Hill seemingly as
fast as if it was a level road, sped down
the other side unmindful of the nu
merous dangerous twists and curves and
came Bailing into Fairfax at the same
time the train did. He kept up his re
markable r:de to San Anseimo, reaching
there a few seconds ahead of the train.
T::e passengers only caught occasional
glimpses of the man alens the route, as
the road is not visible from the train in
many places, bet whenever they did see
him he was plowing along at the same re
markable pace up hill and down. Here is
a ride for some of our local road cracks to
emulate. There was a time when it was
considered a remarkable feat to ride up or
down Whites Hill, and the pace was al
ways slow. The idea of using it as a race
course is a new one.
Max Morris and George S. Bovee, the

powers and duties of United States secret
service agents with a view of beeinning
suit against United States Secret Service
Agent Nick Harris. It is qmve possiDie
that the rights of secret service agents to
seize coins that have been defaced in their
making and sent into circulation by mint
officials will De raised and tested.
Such coins, on Recount of their extreme
rarity, are the pride of the collector, and
it was the los-> or one of these that is caus
ing Dr. Syivester to delve deeply into
the mysteries of the law. Sylvester's
complaint arose at the racetrack, and ac
cording to his story Harris acted in an en
tire y unwarranted manner.
A bookmaker bad found among the
coins in the box a dollar, the eagle side of
which was imperfectly stamped, the die
through some mischance havine left the
upper quarter ot the piece blank. He
Â«h<jwed it to Sylvester, who, realizing the
value of it Irom a col.ector's point ol
view, asted the loan ot it to show to a
friend who takes delight in odd coins.
While examining ii at the track a few
day-5 as;o a dispute arose as to the gen
uineness of the silver puce, and Mr. Har
ris, who was standing near, was called
upon to p*Â« on it. Immediately on see
ing the coin the secret service man placed
It in his pocket and tendered Sylvester a
perfect dollar in exchange.
The dentist expostulated and refused
the proffered coin, at the same time de
manding to know by what right Mr. Hai
r:Â» had seized the defaced piece.
â¢ Why, it is nr.ne," sat.d Harris; "I
passed it out by mistake yesterday, and 1
feel fortunate m getting it back. Besides
the law gives me the power to seize ail
defaced coin and return them to the mint,
from which ihey should never be issued."
Dr. Sylvester still dema ded his coin,
savins that ne Had only been loaned the
coin, and that he wanted to return it to
the owner. Harris refused to return it,
and when t c dentist persisted, saying
that he had no proof of the story of the
dollar having previousiv been in Harris'
possession, the latter stated that it had
been brought to him by G. H. Unibsen,
the rea estate man. and tnathe had taken
possession and given Umuten a good
dollar in exchange. He also stated that
lie had reported the matter at the mint,
and by dint of murh persuasion had in
duced trie officials to let him keep it.
Tne coin was valued by a coin collector
to whom Dr. Sylvester had shown it at
$50, and te was naturally very anxious to
give it back to the bookmaker from whom
it Had beca borrowed. He remarked to

Marts' and Mi SWi
Mr. Harris that it was very strange that a
secret service agent would keep posses
sion of a coin that was under the ban of
the law. but he got no satisfaction.
Harris has the coin and the dentist is
trying to find some statute on which to
hang a suit for its recovery.
The problem of how the coin got past
the vigilant eyes of the sorter at the Mint
is an interesting one that the superinten
dent may decide to investigate.
MIDWAY PLAI3ANCE.
Mrs. Hmlllnan and Her Partner Strug-

Mrs. Eva Haliinan and Edward Homan
have instituted proceedings to prevent
John W. Mackay ana Sheriff Wnelan
from dispossessing them of the premises
known as the Midway Piaisance, formerly
the Cremorne Theater.
ThÂ« plaint:ffs say that if they are
thrown out they will be damaged $5000,
and that there is no way for them to set
their money back, hence their application
for an injunction.
No restraining order had been signed at
a late hour last evening. Tne time of
Mrs. Hallinan Â»nd Homan. for vacating
the place will not expire until to-morrow
mornine. It is expected that some kind
of a settlement will be reached before that
time.
OWNER OF THE PEARCE.
John Brcckmao, the Rugged
Frontiersman and Miilion-
aire, in Town.
He Siys He Is Building a ioo-Tcn
Amalgamation and Concentration
Works.
John Brockman, one of the large own
ers of the Pearce mine at Pearce, Arizona,
is one of the arrivals here. The mine is
one of the new bonanzas of the South
west.
One of the associate ownars is W. D.
Penrose, a candidate for appointment by
President McKiniey for Governor o f Ari
zona. Mr. Penrose is a brother of United
S;ates Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Brockman is the typical horny
handed and hard-bevi >.l miner. He said
yesterday that a nne 100-ton amalgamat
ing and concentration plant was being
put up at the mine which would be com
pleted in July.
"The mine is developing handsomely,"
said Mr. Brockman, "and is all mat any
oi us could desire so far as the indications
extend. As for the new district on the
Arizona side, near Yuma, where so much
gold is reported and where there
is now considerable excitement, I
do not know anything by actual ob
servation. 1 neve, however, received
nattering reports from men that 1 know.
I am going there on my return from San
Franc;aco and make aÂ« careful an exam
ination as I can."
Mr. BrocKman is here on a business trip,
and will remain only a day or two. lie
is a bank president at Silver City, K. Mex.,
not far from the m ne. He also owns an
extensive and very fine rancn on the
MembrU River, which is stocked with
cattle. It is said Mr. Brockman gave about
$200,000 for the mine when be bought it
two years ago. Since then Mr. Penrose
and his father became interested in it.
The Pearce is said to be one of the really
big mines of the country.
There are more anis to the square mile
in Fioiida than iv any other country in
tne world. There are nuts that measure
more than half an inch in length, and
then there are anta so small that they can
scarcely be seen to move with the un
aided eye.

THE POLICY OF
CHIEF I. W. LEES
He Makes a Full, Frank
and Manly State
ment.
The Department Will Be Kept
Up to Its Present High
Standard.
He H s Been the Recipient of Many
Congratulations by Telegram
and in Ferson.
Chief of Police Lee 3 was a busy man
Thursday and up to a late hour that ni^ht
consulting with the head officers of the
department and receiving the congratula
tions of numerous friend?, who called at
his office. He was also the rectpient of
telegrams from prominent men in differ
ent cities on the continent congratulating
him on his promotion.
Early in the day Martin J. Burke, ex-
Chief of Police, called upon Chief Lees to
express his entire confidence in him and
to extend his congratulations. He in
sisted upon going on his bond and, ac
companied by the Chief's lifelong friend,
John Nishtmgale, the other bondsman,
they went before Judge Slack, who accept
ed the bind and swore in the new Chief,
although that ceremony had been gone
through the previous nigh f before the
Commissioners.
Chief Lees, outlining his policy that
nignt. sail: "In the first place, iet me
aay that I regard the department as a
first-class une, both in its personnel and
generally in its officers, and it will Do my
constant effort to keep it up to its present
high standard of efficiency. Whenever an
opportunity arises lot its ostierment I
shall take advantage of it.
"I propose to perform my duty in a
straightforward, officerlike manner, and
will consult with the Commissioners as to
their wishes and desires in relation to the
affairs and management of the depart
msnt generally.
"I am thoroughly familiar with all the
details, having been in the department
for over forty-four years. I joined it
October 28, 1853, and three weeks there
after I was detailed to the detective de
partment. At that time there was a
marshal, a captain and four assistant
captains, and 1 was appointed one of the
assistant captains in charge of the de
tective department and occupied that
position till 1356.
'"The People's party then came into
power and they in a large measure reor
ganized the department, as the law had
been chanced, the assistant captains be
ing abolished. Four captains were
created and I was one of them, being the
captain of the detectiva police, and that
position I have held ever since.
"Let me say again that I shall always
consult tne wishes of the Commissioners,
and 1 take the opportunity of saying that
the commission is one of the "best that
was ever created in the United States.
There never was a better. Taey have Kepi
the department entirely out of politics,
and the Chief and his captains working
harmoniously together have brought it,
with the ai<J of the commission, to its high
state of efficiency. Bat there is always a

since the organization of the department
in 1.850, and I sh<i:l endeavor to emulate
him and those who preceded him, and
give the the department my best energies

Captain Bohen, the new heaa of the de

office.
"It will take two or three days yet," he
said that night, "beforp things are in

a few changes, although not of a radical
nature, looking to the betterment of the
department, always of course with the ap
proval of the Chief.

WERE ROLLS STUFFED?
The Accusations W?re Based on
Mere Pencil Memorandum
Books.
Chief Census Marshal Wardell'i
MarVi Nst Did Not Pan Out.
Investigation Dropped.
The Census Committee of the Board of
Education is in very mochÂ«tho same posi
tion as the brave little boy who saw a big
doc running down the street with bis tail
between his lees. He chased the flying
canine, throwing bricks at every jump,
until the dog turned and showed his
teeth, and"then the little boy remembered
that his mother had sent him lor a bar
of soap and immediately had business in
the direction of the grocery.
Chief Census Marshal Wardell, while
nosing around recently amonc the books
left by the last census marshal, discovered
a mare's nest. He convinced the mem
bars of the Census Committee that he
bad found a gigantic fraud; that the re
turns for 1596 nad been stuffed to the ex
tent of several thousand names, and that
neariy $-0,000 had been illegally obtained
from the r-tate on the falae bhowing made
in the books.
Then there were hurried consultations,
hiring of an expert, a star chamber in
vestigation, and Marshal Wardell be
came a great man. All of this was given
to a euilible reporter.
The bubble was punctured yesterday
when tbe committee discovered t at it
had "caught the hot end oi it," and the
investigation suddenly ceased.
A report reiterating the charges of stuf
fing and fraud against tbe State was
about to be given out yesterday, when it
was called to the attention of the commi -
tee that the boot on which tbe inqniM
tion had worked and based its startling
accusations was a mere pencil memoran
dum of the former officials, was not certi
fied as correct and not evert signed.
It would have absolutely no standing
before a court or a Grand Jury, and the
comroitteemen, aehast, called upon Mar
shal Wardell for an explanation. He was
very glib, bat it whs evident that his ex
planation did not fill the biiL Then it
was announced that the expert had not
found ail the thousands of names that
were claimed to be erroneously in the
\&\J Murphy Building, k/
Oldliul dull oWiis OlloolS.
; booksâ not nearly all. [n fact he had
I found only about "200.
Close questioning revealed the fact that
j oat of the twenty-eignt pages that com
. posed the "recapitulauon" book ten had
! been examined, and out of these only 200
' names were found that could possibly be
j -classed as staffers. At this rate the book,
; if aoout equally correct throughout, wonld
i only show 560 smffers, and there is abso
: lutely no certainty in the pencil books
! that even that number exists.
TLe committee did not seem absolutely
sure of anytning except thai there must.
be "something wrong," and one member
i finally said tha: he had begun to think
; that it was "nothing but a matter of carej
I iessness, anyway."
Then it was announced that the atten
| tiou of the Grand Jury would no*, be called
to the books and that tne investieation
â  would proceed no further because the cen
i sus marsha.a were about to begin their
regular work, and their chief, could de
| vote r.o more time to the books.
Mr. Wardeil seemed to thintt he had
: done his full duty in giving to the pubic
, the information that frauds had been com
} mitted aud then leaving them to guess
j what the irregularities consisted of.
EMMA WAS NOT INSANE.
Her Mother Sought a Novel Method to
Keep Ker at Uome,
Mrs. Belle Littlewood yesterday be
sought Judge Hebbard to declare her
daughter, Mrs. Emma McFarland, alias
Fallon, insane. The testimony developed
the fac: that Mrs. McFarland is sane, and
that her mother only sought to detain the
young woman because it waÂ» feared that
she intended to go Guatemala, where see
might lack the restraining inn"'.:* nces of
home life. Judge riebbard declined to
interfere and ordered that the prisoner be
discharged. She at once drove to the
Panama -teamer. Her mother made a
great outcry. She was tiually quieted by
a threat to send her to jail for contempt
of court if she persisted in her abuse of
the Judge.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
War in Europe.
The carnival has gone glimmering.
Good weather for rest and recreation.
Try a trip to-day on the Balboa boule
vard.
Read our ads. lor bargains in spring
novelties.
The fighting in Kurope is lively, but ac
cording to diplomacy it isn't war.
England had better let Greece and
Turkey fight it out and attend to her dia
mond jubilee.
Who will get Constantinople when the
Turk goes out is a good subject for a
guessing contest.
The Greeks and the Turks will have to
recognize one another as belligerents for
the powers won't.
We are to have no Golden Gate Carni
val this year, but it is possible to have a
Balboa road opening that will be just as
good.
It is just as easy to call an international
monetary conference this year as next and
there is no reason why it should not be
done.
The so-called "pacific blockade" of
Crete hasn't pacified anybody nor block
aded anything, but otherwise it deserves
the title.
While the Greek rights the Turk the
Servian is on cuard. He may not take
part in the battle, but he intends to share
the spoils.
In your meditations to-day think of the
unemployed and make up your mind to
subscribe to the fund to provide them
with work.
The House has done its share in putting
a pood protective roof over the industries
of the country and it should cow whirl in
and put on the silver lining.
The surest way to get the officials at
Washington to begin work on tbe Federal
building in this City Is to make every day
of delay unpleasant lor them.
Weyler has lost his grip not only on the
trocha bui on the telegraph wire, and
we now bear stories of Cuban victories
without any counter stories of great Span
ish successes.
It needs no expensive carnival prepara
tions to make a joyous festival in this
kind of weather. Let each individual
furnish the gayety of heart and nature
will do tbe rest.
Tut the money you intendod to expend
on the carnival into the boulevard fund
and you will get just as much pleasure
out of it as ever you expected, and per
haps a little more.
The Chicago Inter Ocean asserts that at
the Moody revival meetings in that city
"men are moved to tears" and perhaps
that helps toarcount for the extraordinary
floods in the Mississippi Valley.
The governments of England, France
and Italy are willing enough to co-oper
ate with Russia in coercing Greece, but
their people will not permit them and
that is where the laugh would come in if
it were a laughing matter.
It has at last been explained that when
President Kruger called Queen Victoria
"een kwaje vrouw" he meant ehe is a
woman who will stand no nonsense and
once more the British public breathes
easily and without snorting.
None of the powers that have parlia
mentary governments are able to explain
what their fleets are doing at Crete or
what they intend to do, and perhaps if
Russia had a parliament and her officials
were called on to explain their policy it
would be found they are as much at sea
as the others.
Since ex-Senator Peffer has gone back
to editorial work on the Topeka Advocate
he announces that he will continue to
support the principles of Populism, but
hereafter It Trill be on conservative lines.
This world, he says, is too big for men to
recreate it. There is wisdom in the
maxim and Mr. Peffer might have added
that it is as much as the average man
can do to recreate himself.
According to a report of the Labor
Eureau of North Carolina the cotton-mill*
of that State increased their spindles
from 344,000 in 1890 to more tfcan 1,000,000
in 1897, and the number of operatives in
creased from 8515 to more than 25,000.
This development shows why the pro
tective sentiment is crowing in the
Soutn and why that section of the coun
try is getting into harmony with the rest
of the Union.
The proposal to establish in the univer
sity a CoJlege of Commerce is one for
which much may be said. To carry on
trade with foreign countries we must have
nn underDtnndingof the commercial needs
of their people, and that cannot be ob
tained without study. The success of
German commerce of recent years has
been largely due to her commercial train
ing schools, and now the English ar& pre
paring to establish similar courses of edu
cation. Sooner or later we must follow
the example or fall behind in the race.
THE EUROPEAN SITUATION.
According to the dispatches from Europe there bsi been fighting along the Turkish
frontier and war is imminent. That is the language of diplomacy. As a matter
of fact, there is actual war between the Greeks and Turks, and that which is im
minent and menacing is a general war which may involve all Europe.
The situation has two phases, distinct from one another but equally complex.
The first is that which concerns the nations of Western Europe. The govern
mentH of England, France and Italy have shown a willingness to co-operate with
Kussia in coercing Greece, but their hands nave been withheld by the opposition of
their peoples. The debates in Parliament and in the Chamber of Deputies of France
ana Italy have shown that the Ministry of neither power could hold its position if it
undertook to declare war against Greece and put into effect the blockade which has
teen threatened.
This betn<; the condition of affairs, it is evident that a concert of action between
Western Europe apd Ilussia is extremely difficult, and it will tax the skill and the
energies of statesmen to devise a plan by which they can localize the war in the
Levant and save Europe from participation in it.
In the Levant itself every condition is favorable to war. All the various states,
nationalities and races of that region are now as inflammable to the war spirit as
is the grass of a prairie in autumn to hre. The fighting begun on the frontier is not
only liable to spread but is almost certain to do so, unless some very powerful iorce
interposes to prevent it.
It is not simply a question of Greeks and Turks. There exists in the Balkan
peninsula another element equally dangerous to the peace of Europe bo long as
the Turkish empire is maintained. That element is the Servian people. For more
than three generations the Servians have been animated by a desire to establish
themselves as a nation. Under the influence of this aspiration they have plotted,
conspired, intrigued, rebelled and fought almost incessantly. They have accom
plished the establishment of a Servian state, but the boundaries of it do not by
any means correspond wiih the full extent of the habitations of the Servian peo
ple. The present state is to the real Servia about what Piedmont was to Italy.
It is not so much a nation as the nucleus out of which a nation is to be made.
The Servians will watch with swords in their hands every otep that in taken by
the Greeks against the Turks. Their sympathies for the time necessarily will
be with the Greeks, inasmuch as their interests will be advanced by the fall of the
Turkish empire. When the Turks go out, however, the Servians and the Greeks
will be antagonists in the distribution of the spoils. Each is an aggressive race.
Each hopes to become the dominant power in the Levant, and each is ready to
fight for supremacy.
The more carefully the situation is studied the greater will be the number of
difficulties discovered in the way of preserving peace. The whole situation is an
anachronism. The existing order of things is a survival of a system which has
been outgrown. It has been said by Goethe that if you plant au acorn in a
flower-pot one of two things will happen : either the youn^ oak will die or the flower
pot will be broken. The acorn seeds of two viporous nationalities have taken
root and are flourishing in the old flower-pot of the Turkish empire. Either Eu
rope must destroy the national instincts of the Greeks and Servians, or else the
empire which confines them must be broken, and a new order of things consti
tuted which will allow room for the full growth of thes* strong and progressive
peoples.
THE LOST FIESTA.
While it is a matter for much reeret that
the Golden Gate Carnival has to ba post
poned to another year in hope that the
conditions will then be more propitious
for its success, it was nevertheless a wise
decision; and that the executive commit
tee had force enough to decide promptly
to renounce the doped for pleasure rather
than dally and prolong an attempt at a
n>sta, â which would probably have proved
to some extent a fiasco, is a subject for
congratulation.
It ia ample arcument for the renounce
ment of the frolic that the report of the
director-general and the grand marshal
showed the funds forthcoming would not
be sufficient to make the festival credit
able. San Francisco cannot afford to
risk her reputation and matre herself fool
ish by performing even a frolic by halves
and slouchily. Let the design fully meas
ure up to the rich fortune and far fame
of a State which, being pre-eminently the
land of gold and fruits and flowers and
nature's generous lavishmeiit of both
plenty and baauty, is therefore pre
eminently the land for carnivals. Then
when the plans are adequate let the ex
ecution of them be a safe expectation be
fore a move is made to bring people here
from near and far who might otherwise
find their anticipations turned to such
disappointment as would send them home
spreading disparaging comments on Cali
fornia.
This argument is supplemented by the
cogent one that even if we did have the
money for the carnival it would look in
congruous that we should be giving up
our energies and substance to feasting and
frolic when so many in the City are indis-
tress and a half-executed plan for tneir
relief is halting for lacK of tbe very funds
the festival would consume.
Thia is the criticism passed upon the
proposed frolic by the men who have been
expending thoir generosity in the Balboa
relief scheme, and who have been asked to
contribute also to the prettier and more
enticing enterprise, but which is not an
imperative behest of duty liKe the provid
ing of work to the City's unemployed.
Such civera as these have a right to decide
the question.
The relinquishment of this hoped-for
pleasure, as well as advertisement of the
btate, is only a temporary self-denial, and
is by no means an abandonment of a
wisely designed enterprise. Another year
we can hold not only a better festival, bui
we can do it with far mora grace and
make it ethically as well as esthetically
perfect. It is written: *To everything
there is a season, and a time to every pur
pose under the heaven"; and when we
have done the sterner duties of life we can
enjoy better its happy festivities.
DANIEL W. VOORHEES.
The deatn of ex-Senator Daniel Wolsey
Voorhees has followed swiftly upon bis re
tirement from oflice. He had not time to
pass inio obscurity in private life before
he cassed from earth. Death summoned
him while still a notable figure in our
politics, and around his grave therefore
his services to bits party, to the people and
to the country will bs fresbly remembered.
In bis prime Voorhees was ono of the
foremost of Congressional orators, and it
is by his oratory be will be iongest and
chiefly remembered. His acts of construc
tive statesmanship were few and oi minor
importance. This oi course was lareciy
due to the fact that as a Democrat ha was
in opposition during the greater portion of
his political life, and had littla or no
cnanee to show his capacity for adminis
trative work.
So far as opportunities offered Voorhees
did his wont well. While his politics
estranged him from the great mass of the
American people during the controversies
arising out of the war he nevertheless re
tained univeral respect for his personal
character and won admiration by the elo
quence and the energy with which he
maintained the cause he bud espoused.
He was five times elected to the House of
Representatives and thrice to the Senate,
and in both bodies held an influential and
distinguished place among leading de
baters.
In his death the country loses one of its |
favorite and most picturesque figures in |
politicr. Voorhees on the stump or in the i
Senate was always interesting. If hiselo- !
quence possessed no element of immortal- ]
ity It was always slowing and vital for the
occasion when it was uttered. Bold in tnÂ«
use of Saxon words, beautiful in rhetoric
and ferviil in sentiment a speech by Voor
hees never failed to rouse an audience
even if it aid not convince. His political
actions moreover were as interesting as
his oratory. A true partisan leader, he
never failed in any element of dash,
strategy or vigor to hold his followers
loyal to him at every turn of fortune.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 11, 1897.
NORSE LITEEATURE.
A petition, started by the Scandinavian
residents of the City, is being circulated
requesting the establishment at the State
University of a chair of Norse language
and literature. Whether the finances of
the university justify the institution of
such a professorship at this time is a ques
tion which only the Regents are able to
decide, but of the general merit of the
proposal there can be no doubt.
From Scandinavia came many of the
myths and legends that form the founda
tions of the early history of our race.
From that ancient language buve also
been drawn many of the words which
help to make up the strength of our Eng
lish tongue. A study of Noree mythol
ogy and philology is therefore re
quisite to a full understanding of our own
history and language, and it is clear that
no little profit could be derived from it by
careful students.
The number of Scandinavians in the
United States is larire and rapidly increas
ing. Many papers of merit in that lan
guage are published and the support
given them shows the interest which the
Scandinavians take In the intellectual
life of the time and ot the Nation. It is
natural that these citizens should desire
to have their literature and history recog
nized in the work of the university of the
State and as they assist by their taxes in
supporting it they have a right to have
th:s desire receive careful consideration.
The subject is one in which tho general
public may well take an interest and the
petition therefore deserves and will re
ceive tbe signatures of many citizens in
addition to those of Scandinavian origin.
EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEF.
A unique necromancer with tbe pen in
a Stockton paper chooses as bis manner
of being funny on Mondayâ which differs,
please God, from his manner of being
funny on all tbe other days of the week in
his perpetual scheme of being always
funny â the experiment of saying that
The Call was ignorant when it referred
to the Emperor of Austria ns "a fatuous
old man." He Roes on to aver with a
gravity that would upset the composure
of an owl that Emperor Franz Josef is
bead and shoulders intellectually above
every ruler in Europe, including, of course,
Emperor Josef himself, as ha is a ruler in
Europe.
What a painful accentuaiion of an al
ready stupid assertion! Franz Josef has
long been known to be mentally infirm.
Some years ago there was serious talk
of removing him from the throne
and putting a man of valid in
tellect in bis place. His recent im
becile utterance of f&ith in the power
of diplomacy to maintain the peace of
Europe, when actual deadly, bloody war
was going on under the very nose < of his
battle-sliips, merely added to the general
impression which had been held concern
ing him. The Call incidentally called
him a "fatuous old man," and in doing
so stated his real condition mildiy.
THE NEXT THING.
The McKinley administration has won
favor with the people by the promptness
with which it has undertaken the work of
revising the tariff so as to provide a rev
enue for the Government and protection
to the industries of the people. It has
been in office hardly more than a month,
and yet within that time has called Con
gress together, drawn up a tariff bill satis
factory to the people and had it passed by
the House of Representatives. That much
i 3 good. Now for the next thing.
Congress is in session. The tariff bill
sent from the House is in the hands of
the Senate Committee on Finance. For
the time bains the House ia idle. The
Senate will occupy at least two months in
considering the tariff, for it believes in
the philosophy of making haste slowly.
It can hardly be possible that the admin
istration desires the House to remain idle
during the whole of that time. It is clear
that some work should be provided for it.
It should begin at once on the next thing.
There can be no question as to what the
next thing is. Not less important than
the tariff itself is the money question.
The pledge to promote the remonetiza
tion of silver by international agreement
was as important a part of the .Republican
promise to the people during the cam
paign as was the pledge to establish pro
tection. Tue fulfillment of this pledge is
therefore the next thing for the Republi
can party to undertake, and now that the
House has disposed of the tariff it should
at once proceed to deal with the other
vital is-:ue of the time.
An international conference cannot be
brought together in a day. After the in
vitations to foreign governments have
been issued, much time must necessarily
elapse before replies can be received and
a date for the assembling of the confer
ence agreed upon. It is therefor* impor
tant that the preliminary work should be
entered upon as early as possible, if any
thing is to be accomplished in that direc
tion by this Congress.
The situation is just thio. The regular
session of Congress will not begin until
December and will not get regularly to
work until after the New Year's holidays.
Any business which is postponed for that
session can hardly get under way before
the middle of the winter of 1898. In the
pressure of the other business that will
be upon the Home there wiil then be a
difficulty in getting auy monetary legisla
tion adopted by that body before spring,
and as it will then have to co to the Sen
ate, it may be lato in the summer before
any action is taken at all.
The result will be that the Republican
party will have to faco the people in the
campaign of 1898 with one of its most im
portant pledges unfulfilled. It needs no
great political sagacity to see that such
neglect would be a tactical blunder of fhe
worst kind. Some immediate action on
the siiver question is therefore impera
tive. The House should put an end to its
idle adjournments and meet to do
business.
STRANGE B/TTLE CASUALTIES
Curious stories are often told of men who
have been severely wounded in battle and
who have themselves only discovered it after
the heat and excitement of the action were
over. Others have been known to die of
shock from wounds -which existed only In
their imagination.
The round balls uÂ§ed In the cannon of for
mer days often played strange freaks. Their
effect in ricochet was often remarkable, the
ball in its bounding course carrying every
thing before it. The spent balls would often
cause death and leave no external, marks, and
for many years death in such cases waa t>opu
larly attributed to "windage" or the effect of
the passage of a ball close to the person, but
not hitting him. During the Indian mutiny
a spent ball struck a gunner, passiEK over his
body, cutting away a portion of his vest and
breaking his arm. No other injury was ap
parent, but three days later the greater por
tion of his leg fell away and ha died firm in
the belief that he was killed by "windage."
In the Cr.menn war an officer of the Forty
second Highlanders was struck in the body,
fell and died while being carried off the field.
No trace of injury was visible and the cause
of death, as usual, was given es "windage."
The autopsy, however, revealed the fact that
nil of the internal organs had been raptured
by a. blow from a spent bal'..
Coins, buttons and pieces of clothing are
frequently carried Jtito the body ty the strik
ing bullet. Pieces of knives, watches, swords,
etc., are found in arms and legs after every
great battle. The story is told of two French
coins formerly in the N'utley Museum. These
were found in an English soldier's- leg during
the Crimean war. As he was a noted spend
thrift and never had a piece of money about
him the mystery remained unexplained until
it was found that a French soldier lighting
beside him had had his pocket and its con
tents entirely carried away by a shot.
Soldiers who are hit in battle frequently
complain that they were shot by their com
rades from me rear. This is due to a curi
ous fact, well known by surgeons, that the
rirht twinge of pal:i may be felt, not where the
bullet strikes, but where it comes out.
When a bone is broken or a nerve ruptured
the pain is intense, but if the ball only passe*
through the flesh it may not be observed at all
or may be felt only as a blow from a stick might
be. Much depends on temperament. Many
faint and die from wounds which others
would scarcely feel. The nervous shock due
to a severe blow is frequently not felt for
some hours after It Is inflicted, and then the
patient is suddenly prostrated.
Tne feeling produced by the passage of a
bullet is variously described as like a blow
from a sledge-hammer, or, again, like a red
hot iron. The actual pain experienced by the
wounded on the battle- Held we may conclude
has been mueli exasperated on the whole.
The principal sufferings are due to lack of at
tention after the battle resulting in fever and
thirst. Prompt treatment will do much to al
leviate this. With the greatly improved sani
tary and medical service of modern armies
and the respect now paid to hospitals and
doctors we may expect that the principal suf
ferings of the battle-field will be in future
greatly reduced.

AMERICAN DIPLOMATS.
Alone among all the great powers of the
world the United Stales has no regular
diplomatic service. Its Embassadors and
Ministers hold their office only for the
term of the administration at Washing
ten, to which they are indebted for their
appointment, namely, four years, and then
step aside to make way for others, who are
a*; new to the duties and to the responsi
bilities of their mission as were their pre
decessors at the time of their nomination.
Just at the present moment the resigna
tions of all those who have held effice
abroad under President Cleveland are be
ing claced on rile at the State Department,
while President McKinley is busily en
gaged in the task of selecting their suc
cessors and, as usual, the question â which
has become a regular feature of each
change of administration â has been re
vived as to whether it would not be more
advantageous for the United States to
organize a diplomatic service similar to
that of foreign nations and to appoint
men trained in the profession to the
effices of Embassadors and of Ministers
instead of adhering to the present practice
of nominating persons devoid of diplo
matic experience.
Some fifteen years spent in the foreign
service of a European power, during the
course of which I have enjoyed a consid
erable amount of intercourse with the
diplomatic representatives of the United
States in various portions of the globe,
may serve as an excuse for offering in
print a personal opinion to the effect that
the interests of this country abroad, far
from being in any way injuriously affect
ed by the absence of trained men at the
head of the American missions, are, on
the contrary, benefited thereby. And
these views, I may add, are shared by
most of the foreign officials, statesmen,
politicians and court dignitaries with
whom I have had occasion to discuss the
matter, it bsing held that this great com
mon wealth is far more appropriately and
efficiently represented in the Old World
by men of sufficient eminence at home to
lead to their selection from among the
numerous candidates for the post by the
President and Senate of their native land,
rather than by a trained diplomat, who
would owe the office to seniority and pro
motion, the major part of his life having
necessarily been spent out of America.
The distance between the latter and
Europe is so great that even the most
patriotic citizen of the United States gets
out of touch with American ideas after
having lived for a few years abroad. He
becomes susceptible to local influences,
and losing the broad American manner
of looking at things, gradually grows to
view them with an eve that may be de
scribed as European. This is apparent in
ihe correspondents of almost every Ameri
can journal who goes abroad to represent
his paper, and it is only by frequent trips
home ttiat even the most brilliant of them
can manage to suppress the tendency to
be unduly influenced by the character of
tueir surroundings and by the atmosphere
in which they live. It this is the case
with newspaper men, who are supposed
to consort to a great extent with the
world of letters in the country in which
they may be residingâ that world popu
larly unown as the Bohemian, and in
which there is less conventionality and
more intellectual independence and bril
liancy than in any otherâ it naturally fol
lows that an American diplomat, who is
daily and hourly brought in contact with
those foreign bureaucrats and officials to
whom etiquette and conventionality are a
gospel, and the concealment of thought
as wel! as of sentiment a creed, will in
linitely sooner lose his American breadth
of view, vim and freshness of mind than
the American newspaper correspondent.
Now the lots of '..Â»ese essentially Ameri
can characterist.oi by a diplomatic repre
sentative of the United States is a dis
tinrt disadvantage to his country and to
his Govern men t, since it tends to impair
his popularity and his prestige. The
thoroughly American citizen of the
United States is vastly preferred in the
Ola World to the Europeanized son or
daughter of Uncle Sam â evidence of this
peculiarity being afforded by the fact that
Western maidens have proved far greater
social successes, uot only in England, but
also on the Continent, than their sister 3
from Now York, Boston and rhiladel
pbia, who are considered as being 'too
anglicized and presenting too little differ
ence with the domestic feminine product
to render them exceptionally interesting.
It is just the absence of conventionality,
the indifference to the frequently prepos
terous and nearly always depressing laws
of etiquette, the perfect independence of
speech and of bearing that constitute in
the eyes of the Old World the principal
charm of the American, be the latter man
or womanâ a charm characterized by an
individuality and originality which are
as refreshing as they are invigorating to
the jaded and blase palate of the Euro
pean; but let these qualities ouce suc
cumb to foreign influences and atmos
phere and disappear from view, and
straightway the American man or woman
ceases to be interestingâ becomes com
monplace and loses popularity, prestige
and influence.
Moreover, it is a great mistake to imag
ine that iv order to achieve diplomatic
v.ctories for one's country it is necessary
to have had previous diplomatic training.
Indeed, England, France, Germany, Rus
sia and Italy, who have all live of them
splendidly organized diplomatic services,
frequently go outside the ranks of the lat
ter in order to lind suitable men for the
posts of envoy. Francs, for instance, has
for the past fifty years regarded St. Peters
burg as, diplomatically speaking, the
most important capital in Europe, as a
court where it was of more vital im
portance to be efficiently represented than
at any other. Yet, for more than three
decades, indeed, until the appointment of
Monsieur de Laboulaye, predecessor of
the present envoy, Count Montebello, the
French Embassadors accredited to the
Czar were invariably men devoid of any
previous diplomatic experience or train
ing, among the best known having been
the late Due da Morny and the Generals
Fleury, Le Flo, Appert and Chanzy. Rus
sia, on the other hand, has been repre
sented at .Berlin by General Count Paul
Bhoulavoff, and in London by General
Count Peter Shoulavoff, both soldiers by
profession, who had until the time of their
appointment as Embassaaors been as
signed to the performance of purely mili
tary duties.
France's Enibassndur to the Vatican is
M. PouoeJle, who, prior to his nomina
tion, was Civil Governor of Paris, and who
had never held a diplomatic appointment
before in his life, while the republic is
represented at the Court of Vienna by SI.
Loze, who, until the moment of present
init his letters of credence to Emreror
Francis Joseph, was at the head of the
Metropolitan Police Department at Paris.
King Humbert's Embassador in London
is a general of the name of Perrero, who
has never had any diplomatic training,
while for many years tbe Italian embassy
on tbe banks of the Seine was occupied by
that fine old soldier, General Menabrae,
one of tbe bravest comrades-in-arms of
King Victor Emmanuel. Yet another
general, namely, Count Lanza, is King
Humbert's Embassador at Berlin, while
(or many years tlie most popular member
of the diplomatic corps at Vienna was the
one-armea General Kobilant, the envoy of
Italy.
Unquestionably the most brilliant of
the Embassadors of Great Britain in re
cent times has been the Marquis of Duf
ferin, who at the time of his appointment
to the difficult ana delicate post of St.
Petersburg, wnere he won golden
opinions, bad never held a diplomatic ap
pointment in his life. Moreover, when
Lord Salisbury the other day looked about
him for a competent man to undertake
the duties of Enelish Minister at Peking,
he, to the astonishment of everybody,
offered the post to the major of an infan
try regiment, who had won some little dis
tinction as the administrator of the pos
sessions of Great Britain on the Nis;er
River on the west coast of Africa. Lord
Salisbury's choice, the wisdom of which
was much questioned at the time, has been
amply justified by the results which the
major has achieved since he took up his
residence at Peking. For Sir Claud Mac
donald (as he is now) has succeeded in
opening up to the foreign commerce of the
world the great West River of China, a
feat whicli his predecessors in office bad
sought in vain to accomplish for more
than forty years past, finally there is the
case of Sir Julian Panncefote, who is recog
nized as being the most successful and in
every respect satisfactory Embassador
who ever represented Great Britain at
Washington. Yet Sir Julian is a iawyer
by profession, aud prior to his nomination
to the American mission had never held a
diplomatic appointment in his life.
These instances will suffice to show that
even although the great powers of Europe
have most elaborately organized diplo
matic services, they generally go outside
thereof in their selection of men best
qnalified in their opinion to till the most
important and difficult diplomatic posts,
being of the opinion that greater results
are likely to be achieved by envoys who
are capable of taking a broad, liberal,
common-sense view of matters than by
professional diplomats whose minds have
been narrowed and prejudiced by their
training, and who are, in consequence
thereof, inclined to accord undue atten
tion to detail, to precedent and to eti
quette, often to the detriment of the inter
ests that are intrusted to their care and
control.
Naturally Embassadors and envoys
who have not served their apprenticeship
in the minor grades of the "line" and
who have often no previous knowledge of
the capital in which they are appointed
to reside or acquaintance with the people
among whom they are called upon to live,
are occasionally guilty of infractions of
local conventionality and usage, of which
much is made by those minor lights of
the official world abroad, who look upon
the protocol as a sort of all-restraining,
all-supreme providence, and any disobed
ience to its laws as akin to sacrilege.
These are errors to which even the most
brilliant, hish-bred and polished men of
the world are liable, and they are by no
means conlined to United States Ministers
in Europe, as one might be tempted to be
lieve from the stories current about the
matter, even in t':e American press. Thus
when General Fleury, the Fidus Ach
ates of Napoleon HI, alter several
years spent at Paris as chief of
the imperial household, was nomi
nated to the post of Embassador at St.
.Petersburg, he at the close of the first
state banquet that he attended horrified
one of the principal dignitaries of the
Muscovite court by using his lingers in
stead of the tongs for the purpose of trans
ferring the sugar from the silver gilt
sugar-bowl to his coffee-cup. With the
object of teaching the gallant general a
lesson the dignitary in question, to whom
the sugar-bowl was handed next, took it
from the hands ot the servant, walked to
tbe window, which was open, and pitched
it into the courtyard, commanding the
servant to bring another. The general
observed this, as it was intended that he
should. lie said nothing; but as soon as
ever he had drunk his coffee he ap
proacbed the window in his turn and
pitched the dainty Sevres cup and saucer,
as well as the gold spoon, down into the
square below.
"Wnat on earth is your Excellency do
ing." inquired tha dignitary, in utter
amazement.
"Why," replied the general, "I thought
that was the court etiquette here. 1 saw
you a short time ago pitching the sugar
bowl out of the window."
At this moment the Czar appeared upon
the scene, and having heard the closing
words of the general's reply, asked smil
ingly what had taken place. His smile
changed to a hearty laugh when ne was
made acquainted with the manner in
whicn General Fleury had responded to
the impertinence of the old court official,
and from that time forth no further at
tempt, was made to teach any lesson in
good manners to the French Embassador.
The example set by General Fleury may
be followed by any man in the game posi
tion, and similarly devoid of diplomatic
training. Provided an envoy nas a cer
tain amount of wit and cleverness, he can
always return a tit for a tat in such cases
as these and turn the laugh on those who
endeavor to moke capital of any solecism
of which he may have rendered himself
guilty through ignorance of local usage.
Not one of those personages whom I
have mentioned above as having been
selected for the post of Embassador with
out previous diplomatic training but
has been made the hero of stories similar
to the 6ne which I have related about
General Fleury, and which are circulated
aoout so many of the American envoys.
But as may be seen from the results which

forming them into a permanent corps of

NANSEN'S ACHIEVEMENT.
FARTHEST NORTH âBy Dr. Fridt;of Nan
sen. Harper* Bros., New York. *or sale by
a. M. Kobenson, Post street, City. 1 rice $10.
Dr. Xanseii's new boot is a record of one of
tbÂ« most heroic aehnvenients of modern
times. The work is of thrilling interest and it
teaches a life lecson of bold and persistent en
deavor, which has a value far beyond the ad
dition the results of the expedition give to geo
graphical knowledge- Admirable as was the
wisdom wbicb ioru-aw (he solution of the
problem oi virtually reaching the north pole,
It is far more a snÃjecl ior pride that so during
a plan as Nansen's could be resolved upon and
the purpose persisted In through such ardu
ous labors Â»n<i continuous peril.
The work under review consists of two large
handione vu.umes and is a complete recora
of the Arctic voynge oi exploration of the ship
Fram during the three years from the rnid
bummerc: 1893 :o the midsummer of 1896,
and also a record cf the fiueen months' sieigh
journey by I'r. Nansen end his companion,
Lleutenaut Johmisen, across the ice floes to
the fanhtat point northward ever reached
by man. There is an appendix by
Otto Sverdrnp, wao became captain of the
Fram after Kansen left the ship 10 go on his
perilous search for the pole. The work con
tain-! 120 iuli-j>age illustrations and sixteen
colored jiates in facsimile from Nansen's
own sketches. These pictures ada wonder
fully to the interest of the narrative.
L)r Nan>en says it is futile to argue that
these perilous trips of discovery are inexpedi
: the spirit of man will never rest satis
fied un;il every loot of the globe has been
i and every problem solved. Since
Nansen's theory of the correct method of
reaching me pule has, by the results of his
expedition, been so fully vindicated we may
now confidently expect that the exact mathe
matical point oi tne pole will be reached
ere lons, and all the Arctic regions
thorouuii-y exp.ored and mapped. He
Ftud.eii tne problem of Arctic exploration
until he came to the conclusion that there was
a jr,re.-:: ocean current flowing from the New
in Islands westward across the polar
region-, and that the surface of this current
wu an immense icefloe. Consequently the
only wfiy for a ship to closely a) proach the
p lie was lor her to sail lar to the north of
Siteria in midsummer and be frozen into the
floe drilling with it across the pole. Tne
Krara failed to start into ihe curreut far
enough north, and for that reason Nansen un
dertook the sleigh journey, which carried him
closer to the pole thau any of his predecessors.
Dr. Nunseii. besiaes being a tine scholar and
bold explorer, is also a good writer, and lie has
told his .-tory with a simple eloquence that is
deiijthttul u> read. It is said that he has al
ways been good at narration, and even at
school he had a tine atKitude ior composition.
Lone before this great work he had written
books and magazine articles, in which his vig
orous style and p etical sreatmeut of his sub
ject aroused very favorable comment. His
success in telling of this last great expedition
is commeusurbte with that with which the
latter was rewnrded.
The word-painting is, in fact, so vivid and
complete that it makes the realer almost teel
as if he were accompany in? Kansen to the
Land o: the Midnighi Suu and helps to satisfy
both our des.rc for further knowledge of that
iiiiherto inaccessible region and our curio-ity
to learn something about the men who accom
plished the wonderful Journey. In achiev
ing such results on paper the an ihor gives evi
dence ol rare capacity in the literary art.
One of the surprising -acts recorded in the
rarrative is the comfort with whicu the men
could live in the extreme cold of those high
latitudes. It is tru<- th it Nauson and his com
panion suffered terribly dunn? their loug
sleigh journey, but even wnen the tempera
ture fell to 53 Fahieuheit below zero the
men â werestill ab.Â»- to enjoy long walks over the
great plains o: Boating ice, nnd Derspired so
Jreely under their fur coverings that they were
frequently forced to discard them.
The honors which are being accorded to Dr.
Xansen are rlculy deserved. As long as the
human rare produces Jierjes who, like him,
are willing to sacrifice their lives for the ad
vancement oi sc. entitle knowledge, and pos
sessed of such strength of purpose and un
daunted courage as he displayed through a
terrible three years' test la the execution of
bis plan?, we can nope lor continued progress
in sut.Juiut: the emh to man's necessities and
enjoyment, ii is a story of strenuous en
deavor which will stir the blood 01 every lover
of juumau heroism.
fAMOIS TOBACCO USERS.
A book lately published in London gives
much interesting iulormanon about tobacco
users; it is by an anonymous writer, and is, as
its titie-pat;o asserts, "an amusing miscellany
of fact and anecdotes relating to the graat
plant in all its lorms and uses." The book is
appropriately nam.-d -'Tobacco Talk."
Many great names are given to men who
smoked. It is doubtful whether SnaÂ».espeare
was a smoker or not, and a reason lor his ab
staining is found in the fact that his patron
King James I, was one of the earliest anti-to-
Daccouists. Ben Jonson was a smoker. Na
poleon once said that tobacco-smoking was a
habit only fit to amuse sluggards. Thi* re
mark was somewhat in the nature of "sour
grapes," the great inau being unaole to forget
the effect of Ms first cigar. John Milton
â nK>ked a pioe of tobacco every night before
retiring. Richard Pleteher, Bisuod of Lon
don, was the firsi k .own churcaman to smoke
In England. Talleyrand took snuff, and ex
cused himself by saying that all diplomats
ought to take snuff, a- it afforded a pretext for
delaying a rep.y n ith whicn one might not be
ready.
Mttzzini always tent a cigar burning as he
wrote, ijuizoi, the French historian, said that
smoking na'i pro;onge<l hi* lite ten year*.
Pepys, in in, diar.', states tha: he was forced
to use tobacco during the great plague as a
disinfectant; he "tnuirht some roll tobscco to
smoke and chew, whica took away the appre
hension." Chnries LÂ«mb smoked the strong
est and coarsest tobacco and called it his
"evenlne; comfort" and "morning curse" ; he
once expressed ft wish that nis last breath
might be drawn througn a pipe and exhaled
lv a pun.
Ju 1642 Pope Urban VII isÂ«ued a bull against
the use of tabacoo in churches, threatening
Â»uy one with excommunication who dis
obeyed.
Among other famous men who are men
tioned as universal u^-rs of tobacco are Bis
marck, Lord Brougham, Mr. Spurgeon, Emer
son, Carlrie, Huxley, Victor Hugo, Bulwer,
Lytton, Tennyson, Gibbon, Chnrles Kingsley,
l/ickens and Thackeray. On the other hand,
many great men have been opposed to the use
of the weed.
Some of tbeae were Voltaire, Rousseau, Mira
beau and Swlnburu-, who is quoted as .-.ay ing :
"James I was a knave, a t.vraut, a loot, a liar
and a coward ; bat I love him, 1 worship him,
because he slit the throat of that b nckguard
Raleigh, who invented filthy smoking."
Tnis tirade is qualified by another writer,
who says that tobacco has made more goou
biinbnnds, good men, kind masters and indul
gent fathers than any other blessed thing on
this universal earth.
BY KIPLING'S SISTER.
A PINCH (iODUKSS-iir Mrs. J. M.
Fleming (Alice M. Kipling). D. A p;> if ton* Co.,
New York. I'rlce 60 cents. i- or saie by William
Doxey, Palace Hotel, .-an Francisco.
The wide fame of Rudyard Kipling as a mas
ter In the art of story-telling has undoubtedly
pared the way for the lavorable reception of
thii new novel by his sinter. Kipling Is a
name to conjure with. The mere sound or
flight of it will draw attcution to any work
that bears the name upon its title page, and
thousands will rend the book out of curiosity
to see what sort of work 'he sister of so rare a
genius is capable of doini:.
Those who read it expecting from her some
thing worthy of the relationship will not be
disappointed, for the book Is far and away be
yond the ordinary in story-telling. Her style
is so very different from ncr brother's
that she can advance into fame with
out there being any necessity for
drawing a comparison of their rela
tive merits. Doubtless as tastes differ so
widely there will be many good judges
of literature who would divide on the
question as to which of the two was the best
story writer. It is most too early yet to pro
nounce judgment. Kipling has made his
fame, and his sister is just trying her wings as
it were in a trial flight into the world of litera
ture. Musicians tell us that the great body of
the public love that music moÂ»t. which is a
selection of the best they have repeatedly
heard. It Is not because something new
could not be found of equal merit, but that
the more subtle beauties come mowly to
the apprehension of the average ear. So in
a measure it is in literary styles, and when
Alice Kipling has written more, and we grow
familiar with her work, its excellencies may
botu increase and bo more iully felt until she
fairly rivals her famous brother.
The scene of the story is laid in India.

A story of perhaps quite sufficiently shining
merit to be called splendid is tnis iibotit the
author Stuart Rivingtou and his wife Eva, and
their vnrious friends and acquaintances.
Stuart is represented as having a most fertile
Imajci nation for the production of plots for
his fiction, together with the possession of
tne most artistic tempjrameat. "the intense
sensuous joy in beauty oi every kind, that can
revel ia a ray of sunlight filtered through
green leaves, and ascend on a bnr of solemn
organ, music, heard amidst a dim meil.eval
glory of sapphire ana ruby windows, 10 the
very gates ol heaven." Hs wife l^aisota!
enied and is a great help to him. She whs tun
bitious until she met Stuart, but surrendered
her desire for a career as soon as he cam- into
her life ana conquered. As sue expresses it,
a woman's ambuion di-s when her love is a
successful and haj.py one.
The stcry opj;is with a scene which quickly
convinces tne reader that he has secured
something really worthy of perusal. The wife,
to whose judgment twenty chapters <>f a
new novel have baen submitted, tells her
husband plainly that his work is not
good, that his mannerisms have increased and
that his characters are getting misty, that it
is not worthy of him and if published will
cause people to say that he iÂ« getting "written
out." etc. Thereupon Stuart decides to
break nway entirely from his accus
tomed environment in order to seek fresli in
spiration in complete change oi scene where,
as he puts it, 'â¢! can heal me of my gr;evouÂ«
wound, and spin copy lite a iplder who has
lunched on a bee." Thj story takes its title
from this centra! incident, and the reader is
referred to the volume Itself 'for a complete t
exposition ol Stuart's sacrifice and the Inter
esting results which ensued thereafter.
In one exceptionally clever chapter the
author pictures Eva sitting in Stuart's study
talking volubly and with self-forgetful enthu
siasm ebout a woman's ambitions, loves,
thoughts ana feelings, while Stuart lovingly
rests his chin upon her shoulder. Suddenly lhÂ«
catches sight of ncr husband's face in the glass.
Wnat special emotion his reflected expression
aroused in her we are left to guess irom her
rapid action which followed the si^lu of it.
She sprang from her seat, j-rk>'d her hus
band's head from its inquisitive position and
walked out of the room with this remark o;
spiritea indignation. "You may talk to your
self. lam not going to let you cut me up into
copy. One might as well live with a micro

The authors of this book are the Superin
tendent of Police and the Chief Inspector of
the D.-tective Bureau of the city of Boston,
and it i:s a summing up of long years of expe
rience and slu ly of criminals ana their
methods. It pictures the lon^ conflict be

force or fraud to r.>b their fellows of life or
property, and tho defenders of society, the
police and detectives, who every year mu<t
deve.OD more astute nlertness in order lo b-flle
the new shifts of resourceful villainy. Tne
volume is .strongly and handsomely bouna in
half morocco.
A very interesting feature in the book is the
chapter on the "making of criminals." As
mucn of the pith of It as can be Riven in a
brief spnee is as follows: "Orphanage, iale
ness, misery and wretched home life, or luck
of home life, in great Cities are fruitful sources
of crime." "Want of a trade is a permanent
and potent occasion of crime." Those are
compassionate views. Here is a harsher one:
"Greed and envy, love of pleasnrss, debauch
ery, idleness, hate, vengeance, suideu fury â
behold the principal causes of criminality."
And here is the way. the students of scientific
bent state the case: "Environment is the
ultimate controlling factor in determining
careers."

This narrative of the nic of the great marshal
of Napoleon arouses our admiration for the
heroic and nonorable soldier. It is most in
teresting to read the record of the part he took
in the CMmpaign of that thrilling epoch of the
world's history when France was fighting the
whole 01 Europe, and by the courage of her
troops and the consummate skill of her mili
tary chiefs was alarming the Continent with
the dread that she mitiht conquer the worM.
The story is mainly told by the papers of his
Becond wife, the Duchess of TleÃgio, who writes
well and had opportunities of knowing the
exact truth about many of the most interest
ing features 01 his life. The piecing together
of these accounts ntid the filling out of the
narratire into a complete library wort is done
in admirable sty It-. The book is valuable as a
contribution to history, and it would be quite

After being badly woumled in battle, when he

house one day and met there a visitor irom

superiors and his subordinates. His respect
for justice an<l his kindly rue drew to him the
affection of his trooDS no less than his valor
on the battle-field excited (heir admiration.
When at a very ear.y epe he was placed in
command ol the grenadiers, who were the
picked veterans of tlte army, he was given by
them the pet name of "Father." Not only did
he receive high pr.iise from h:s master, lioua
parte. but he sot letters ot Commendation and
cordial friendship from Emperor Alexander
and other foreign sovereiKns, which, i-trange
to say, he wou by fighting asjam-t them. His
record in that way is unique. There is much
entertaining gossip in the book about the
great historic personages of that time.

o! the style of tne work and a spirited picture i
of Oudiuot soeaks thus of bis youthful cam

he waged war between tne Moselle and the

from a mischievous little rustic to a Harvard
undergraduate, ana through the love affairs
that betray the conflicting elements in his
character. In the studies of Harvard and Bos

fiction and this fact alone would make the
book unusual, even if the material were
not handled with masterly skill. Dur

it to be possible. Through all these revela

THE FASCINATION or THE KINO-Bj-nuy
Boothby. Chicago: Kand, McNullv <fc Lo. Price
The king whose fascination torms the
groundwork for tnis altogether fanciful ta c
is his Majesty, Marie I, King of the Medangs.
It will be a very pardonable igtiorance on the
part ot the reader if he does not know where
his Majesty's kingdom is. Even the author
of,the book is somewhat hazy as to the Â«>ilua
tion of the land of the Meaaaga, but he locates
il vaguely somewhere in Asi::, probably be
tween India and China. The fascinating
king's government, we are assured, is recou
n;z.d by Ihe great powers of Europe. His
Mujcity, Marie, was a Venetian, aud he be
came king by sheer force of Ambition, courage
and intelligence, combined with a wonderful
power of attraction. He went into the coun
try when it was in a state of disorder, as the
result of fuultv administration, and made
himfelf sucti a power that upon the nutive
king's death he proclaimed himself monarch,
securing him.self on the throne despite his
foreign birth.
An English lord, while visitlnc Venice with
his sister, met this strange sovereign. The
sister, O.ivia, who had been rated as the most
beautiful woman in London, falls in love with
Murie, and accepts bis offer to share his
111 rone.

The death of an author is nmially followed
by a renewal in the demnnd for his works, and
doubtless this, the last of Mrs. Huug^rford's
works, will be eagerly sought by a large class
of readers with whom she was so popular.
This story is on the same order as her other
later writings, which, however popular, can
not be commended as taking a high place in
literature. They are bright and light and full
of gayety, and there is no harm In them. We
who are so familiar with the adage that "per
fect ion conies from practice" lind matter for
sur; rise in the fuel that "Tie Duchess," when
a tyro in tfae art of novel-making and a mers
girl, should have produced a work like "Molly

enabled lo write in riper years.

Rich conversations in the dialect of Western

tOfeeUtet with strong character <lrawiug make
it worth commending. The ir.i-trcss of the

to take pos.-e Mini of the land and stock left

people mistake htr for the ranch mistress. On
tiiis error hang many of the strong ana amus

of a cowboy in charge of the ranch, whose
masterfulness tempered by good-nature leads
him to victory in many sharp encounters with
the vixenish would-be mistress of the ranch.
THE TEN BEST POEMS.
An interesting though perplexing task for
the fancy o; erudition Is here proposed:
"To the Editor of the Sunâ Sir: Will you
pease name the best teu suort poems in the
English language? H. D."
Before the choice is attempted we must
agree what poem is short. Compared with
the great epius, "Comus a:d Sourab" and
"Rustuui" are short. Compared with the
latter, "Lycidas" and the "Pied Piper' 1 are
short. If these four were eligible they would
have to be among the ten. "L' Allegro" and
"Blenheim" nre shorter still. But, interrupt
ing our correspondent's wishes by his words,
we will choose from the truly short only. In
so doing, it will be well to say that, to prevent
the list from being swamped by Shakespeare
or Milton, wt will take but one poem from
each. Again, that one will be olios -n some
what arbitrarily, witnout prejudice to its
rivals. With these preliminary explanations
we venture upon selection:
Sonnet, 'â When in Disgrace" (Shakespeare).
"Bannoekbirn" (Burns).
"The Tiger" (BlaKe).
â¢'Pibroch of Donald Dhu" (Scott).
'â¢Bugle Suig" (Tennyson).
Sonnet, "When I Consider" (Milton).
"Hohenlinden" (Campbell).
"Brahma" (Emerson).
"At the Church Gate" (Thackeray).
"Gunga Din' (Kiplinr).
The Hat of o-.hers, running from more un
alloyed sentiments to more intense and purely
distilled poesy is by no means brief. But,
looking among the short poems bearing the
divine stamp of poetic eenius, for the vivid,
the picturesque, the lyrioally complete, the
intellectually impressive.' and ttie paesiou
ately inspiring, the ten given above are cer
tainly very powerful claimants for their
places. And what a marvelous lot they are!â

of the first issue of the International Studio.
This new monthly art magazine will be the
American edition of the London Studio, a pub
lication favorably known on both sides of the

goodly measure of success for the newcomer.
Donahoe's Magazine for April has an inter
esting table of contents. Joan of Arc is the
subject of a beautifully illustrated paper by
Beatrice Stargep, forming the initial number.
Dr. J. J. Mangan writes most entertainingly of
James Clarance Mangan, and the Rev. D. F.
McCrea gives a graphic sketch ol the Giants'
Cnusewaj. "Investigating the Trusts" is an
important topic vigorously discussed by James
E. Wright, who unalyzes the trusts ana their
work in bis usual trenchant style.
Ppaci is devoted in the North American
Review lor April to a consideration of "The
Uprising in Greece," Sir Charles W. Dilke,
M.P., presenting an Ensrlish view of the affair,
and the Greek Consul-General at New York,
Demetrius N. Bottassi, the Grecian. Mr.
Botassi claims that the present conduct of
Greece has enlisted the sympathies of the
entire civilized world, and justified her people
in their claim to be reckoned with as an im
poriant element in the regeneration oi East
ern Europe.
Captain Mnhan and the Hon. Theodore
Roosevelt will be among the contributors to
the forthcoming "History of the Royal Navy,"
which will be published by Messrs. Sampson
Low. The first volume will cover the period
1066 to 1603, while the second will come up
to 17G0 and the third to 1802. Here a notable
epoch is reached in naval history, and so the
whole of volume four will be needed to cover it.
Beginning in the year of Waterloo the fifth
volume is to take the reader to the period iv
which we are now living.
The April Month contains a long, lllnst rated
review of Dr. Fridtjof Nansen's "Farthest
North," by an American Arctic explorer of in
ternational reputation, General A. W. Greely.
The frontispiece of the number is a portrait of
Captain A. T. Mahan of sea-power fame, whose
"Life of Nelson" has just beeu published. The
Lounger chats as usual of a wide range of
mattersâ literary, artistic and otherwiseâ and
the illustrations are numerous and interest
ing, as usual. This newcomer among our
monthlies is making a strong bid for popu
larity; and if quality can insure successâ as it
often doesâ the paper's luture should be
secure.

takes timely notice of the approaching dedica
tion of General Grant's tomb by publishing an
article on "The Historic Utterances of General
Grant," from the pen of General Jnmes Grant

'The Mistress of the Ranch," by Frederick
Thickstun Clark, which the Harpers are to
publish this month, is liitely to be much dis
cussed. It is reported to be a conspicuous
example of American realism, a careul picture
of dramatic phases of ranch life, with close
studies of characters. Mr. Clark has already
done good work m the novel whicn the
Harpers published last year, "On Cloud Moun
tain," and he gives promise of becoming a
prominent figure in the band of Western
writers who are Joins; so much to present in
literature the characteristics of a transient and
* most picturesque aspect of our civilisation.
Harper's Baztr will begin the Easter num

jormed of wnat is going on in the world of the
woman's club.
An elaborate study of "The New Adminis
tration at Washington" b/ Albert Shaw ap
pears in the April Review of Reviews. Dr.
Shaw draws an interesting comparison be
tween the American and British administra
tive systems, pointing out the distinction be
tween "Ministry" and "Cabinet," in both the
ory and practice; he also treats quite fully of
Mr. McKinle.'s process of Cabinet-builcl
mp, its various difficulties and adjustment,
and outlines the noteworthy characteristics
of the President's official family as finally se
lected, both individually and in ensemble.
The article further defines ' 'the larger execu
tive group at Washing ton"â the various as
sistant secretaryships a!l <i important bureau
headships, and so far as possible the reader
is informed as to the personnel and status of
these important offices for the coming four
years. Altogether, Dr. Shaw has made in this
article an exceptionally useful contribution
to current history.

Horace Walpole died on March 2, 1797.
Some regret has been felt in England because
nobody thought it worth while to commemo>
rate the day in any manner. It passed almost
unnoticed. This is odd; too, for in all English
social and semi-literary history there is no
more picturesque figure than Walpole.
I. Zangwill left England in February to ex
plore some of the sites of. the historic ro
mances of his new bo >k, "Dreamers of the

Paul Laurence Dunoar, the negro poet, is in
London, and the London Figaro very ill
naturediy remarks: "There is nothing re
markable about Mr. Dun bar's poetry, except
the color of his skin. And, after all, it is only
natural that a lift attendant should have mo
ments of exaltation." Duubar was an elevator

It is understood that a successor to "Looking
Backward" may be expected before very long.
Edward Bellamy tas published no book in the
ten years since "Looking Backward" ap
peared, aad in view of the careful attention
given to the new work and the increased inÂ«
terest iv the subjects which he treats, the ap
pearance of a new book is likely to De tha
event of the year.
The largest sales during the past month
were lealiz^-d by Lord Roberts' "Forty-ouo
Years in India," and among novels the list is
headed by "On the Face of the Waters," ana
"McLeod of the Camerons." The only other
novels that are selling freely are "i'eier Hal
ket" and Anthony Hope's "Phroso," which
young people are reading with avidity; it is
excellent literary pabulum for them. Â°
One of the latest schemes in periodical liter
ature is a magazine that publishes articles on
the promise of the writer to buy 200 copies at
5 cent;, each. "This will bring your name as
a magazine writer,' says the publishers in
their letter to aspiring writers, "direct to the
attention of your friends, together with the
opportunity of submitting to publications of a
more pretentious cnaracter arready published

Only the other day we were wondering why
Austin Dobson was so persistently .silent.
News arrives of his resolution to break that
silence, not with new work, to be sure, but.
with a new arrangement of some old things.
He is preparing a siu?le - volume edition
of his poems which, it is said, he will send forth
as the one he cares to be remembered by. It
will preserve most or all of the contents of
'â¢Old World Idylls" and "At the Sign of the

An amusing story of an encounter â \rith
Thomas Hardy has recently been credited to
Dr. Weir Mitchell. "While traveling in Eng

conversation with a stranger, who proved to

It is stated that Beatrice Hsrraden's "Hilda

An English writer calls attention to the fol

Hurrah for April,
For blue skies and perfect, sunny hours!
Uod's love has broken the v.luter's chain,
The earth is paradise again.
A smile of sun, a kiss of snowers
After this wailing, what relief
To scent the spring.
You do not know how glad I am that
you like the badge.
How proud you will be every time you
look at it â to think you really earned the
right to wear it.
Keep it bright. I'm sure it's a magic
badge, and ]ust as soon as you grow tirei
of making others happy with your pretty
little rhymes, letters and stories it will be
come so dingy and black that you'll feel
like throwing it out of the window.
I'm anxious for you all to get your
badges before the summer vacation, for it
will be such a pleasure for you to meet
members of C. R. GL wherever you may
chance to go to spend your days of rest.
When you see that little pin worn by boy
or girl yoa'll feel as if you'd met an old
friend. Tiien alter your pin has intro
duced you what a jolly time you'll have
talking about the members whose names
nre so familiar, about the stories and
those hard, hard puzzles.
Now, dear little comrades, get ready for
a beautiful Easter page.
Send your contributions as early in the
week as possible.
Let them all be appropriate to this most
lovely of season?, with its hope and prom

Then there are the funny little rabbits
and trie pretty bright-colored eggs to talk
about besides. Oh, I'm sure you'll do
your best lo make our Easter page even
better than the Poppy page.
Remember, drawings, poems, stories,
legends and puzzles, and don't give up
trying.

The Blot on the Manuscript.
With a Moral.
The little village of Carlton could not
boast of having a large manufactory or
anything of tbe sort, but her schoolhouse,
a strongly built brick structure, was the
best in the county. Tie walls were lined
with shelves, which were filled with num
berless volumes of history and travel, to
gether with manuscript and books of fac
tion.
Mr. Morten, the teacher, was s good
natured fellow and was fond of all the
children.
It was Friday. The rain fell in torrents,
but there were signs of clearing up in the
eastern sky.
It was the hour of dismiss*!, but Mr.
Morten had told the scholars that they
might stay after school and read until it
stopped raining.
Of course the children were glad to have
the opportunity of reading from the
book". Even Johnnie Flynn remained.
He hated school. At least he made be
lieve he did.
The children were all handed books by
the teacher, who said: "Be careful and
do not soil the pages; if you do you
shall ba punished accordingly."
It happened that Johnnie was handed a
story of Daniel Koone, which he had read
over and over many times, and, as he de
clared, he was sick and tired of it. His
seatmate, a handsome, brijiht-eyed boy of
10, was reading a manuscript entitled,
"Tne Life of Washington."
"Will you trade books?" asked Johnnie
of his seatmate.
"I want to read this myself," answered
the boy (Harry Banks by name).
"Will you trade or not?" asked Johnnie,
angrily.
"I don't want the one you have," pro
tested Harry; "1 have readâ"
He was interrupted by a boy in the
back of the room, who asked in an under
tone, "Are you going to play third base
for us to-morrow?"
HÂ»rry turned, nodded assent and then
turned round in his seat again. He was
about to resume his reading, when he hap
pened to glance up at the top of thÂ» page.
He dropped the manuscript In surprise.
Mr. Morten, who noticed the boy's
action, walked across the room to where
he was sitting and asked, "What is the
matter, my boy?"
Hairy held up the manuscript with
tears in his eyes. He 6aid nothing.
Mr. Morten took it from his hand, and
advancing to the front of the room he ad
dressed the scholars thus: "Pupils, I be
lieve that I have informed you of the rule
In regard to these books." He paused a
moment and then held up the manuscript
in plain view. There on the upper por
tion of the sheet was a large spot of ink,
which had not yet dried.
The teacher, after pausing a few mo
ments, continued, "I have not yet chosen
a punishment that I think severe enough
to inflict upon the piiDil who has bÂ°en
so careless as to t-pill ink upon a manu
script which, as 1 have mentioned before,
is worth more than any other book in our
collection. 1 have, therefore, left the de
cision to you. If any one can mention a
punishment that taev consider severe
enough I wish they would do so."
There was a shuffling of ffet and John
nie Flynn quicicly stood erect beside his
desk.
"I thinlt," he said, "that a bard thrash
ing would be as good as anything."
Mr. Morten looked at him a moment
and then added, "very well," and turning
to Harry, he said: "You, Harry, may
stay after the others have gone.''
The teacher's last words were followed
by a serits of deep sobs, and a littJe eight
year old girl who had watched all in si
lence broke out: ".Harry didn't put that
blot on there; no, no. I know he didn't.
I couldn't help seeing."
It was Johnnies own little sister who
spoke.
The teacher was silent fur a moment,
but at length he said, "Well, Bessie, can
you name the guilty person?"
Bessie sobbed. "Yea, I can, sir," and
she looked toward her brother.
Tne teacher followed her glance Then,
turning to Johnnie, he said: "sly boy,
what have you to say about it? '
"Well," was the reply, "1 guess I had
better give up and tell the truth. Harry
wouldn't trade books and I got angry and

then threw the ink on the page; that is
all."
The teacher paused a moment, then
turning to his desk he procured a bluck
strap. Johnnie shuddered, but said noth
in?.
Mr. Morten went to the window and
looked out. It had stopped raining. He
dismissed the ciass. and when tie and
Johnnie were alone he said: "My boy, I
hate to strap you, but you have chosen
your own punishment aud it shall be so."
That evening as Johnnie left the school
house Mr. Morten said: "I have been
taught a lesson, Johnnie, and will
hereafter strive to follow the old
maxims, speak the truth, act the truth
and think the truth, and never forget tie

A Pig Story.
[Being a little boy's experience in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, as toid by himself-]
Loren Hanna was visiting his grand
parents in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
They had just moved from their old farm
to the one adjoining. Until his grand
father had time to prepare new quarters
for tLe pigs and poultry, they were left in
a yara about a quarter of a mile from the
house.
One day Loren's grandfather started
for the town, five miles distant, about
noon, and the little boy gained his grand
mother's permission to go by the pigyard
on the mountain on a voyage of discovery
She readily assented, telling him not to
stay too long, and off he started. When
he reached the pigyard, lo and behold the
pigs were all out.
Did you ever chase pigs? Then you
know just what a bard time be had.
Finally lie succeeded in getting all the
little pigi m the pen, but get tne big
mother in he could noi, but he did man
age to squeeze her up against the fence
and hold her there. Of course he closed
the gate and sat down beside the old pig
to rest. The moment he was down she
con.menced to m<*ve and tried to getaway,
so up he jumped and kept her back. The
sun was getting low and he thought It
mu-t be time for h s grandpa's return.
Far below him lay the road, which wound
round and round the mountain side, com
ing at one point within & quarter of a mile
from wt.ere the little boy stood.
Hark! his grandmother's Toice calling
him In the distance. "Lorenl Loren!"
The lad had a severe cold and could not
answer loud enough for her to hear. What
wsshetodo? Leave the pig? Oh, no; if
he did she would run into the woods and
be set upon by wild animals. So he hal
loed as loud as he could, but it did no
good.
Ah, what is : that? A team in the
slowing coming- up. Perhaps
grandpa.
"Oh, grandpa, erandpa," he cried. No
answer. "It must be Mr. Râ 'a boy
going home from the show. I hear him
sintrini;."
â¢â¢Loren! Loren !" he heard his erand
mother calling. She thought her little
boy was lost in the wooda.
Oh, how dark it was! No moon, and
the owls crying in the treea. Cold, too,
and lonesome.
About 10 o'clock he heard his grandpa's
Toice, speaking to his horses on tne road
below.
Loren cleared his voice and calleJ,
"Grandpa! Grandpa!"
"What? Where are you?" came the an
swer.
"I am In the mountains," cried Loren.
"Well, co home, and then I'll see what
you wish," came from the road.
"I cannot, I'm herding pigs. The big
pig is out!" But his grandfather had cone
on knowing that something was wrong.
When he reached home his wife told
him how Loren had gone to the pigpen,
so he took his lantern and hurried up the
mountain.
He found the little boy quite cold, but
holding Mrs. Fig firmly against the fence,
boon she was with her babies, and grand
pa said, "How long, my brave boy, would
you have hold her there?"
"Why, all night, of course, grandpa."
When they reached the house the whole
story had to be told over again, and Loren
was made much of.
A few days afterward they caught a
wildcat by tbe toes, in a trap, near the pig
yard.
The Doodle Bug.
Doodle bug is the common name of a
little bug that lives in the dust which
gathers around houses. It is about one
third of an inch long. The school chil
dren here in Glencoe olten amuse them
selves by playing with these odd crea
tures, and I'll tell you just bow. We
look around on the ground until we find
a little hole which we know was made by
one of the bugs and then wo call, "Doodle,
doodle, doodle," and in a few minutes
out crawls Mr. Doodle. Then we gently
catch him and place him at the mouth of
another hole. He runs into bis new home
as happy as you please.
When we toid our teacher how the little
creatures answered our call every time
she could not believe it, so we took hold
of her hands and led her out into the
yard. After finding a little hole one of
the pupils softly called, "Doodle, doodle,
doodle," and out he came to prove our
story.
Teacher was much amused and laughed
heartily with us at oar funny playfellows.
Maybe some of the members of (J. R. C.
have seen these little bufÂ»Â».

THE LETTER
BOX
Pan Leandro. Cal.
Dear Editress: March Is over and I think we
are all glad, for it was a very disagreeable
month. We had one pleasant dny during the
whole month, and I'll tell you how we spent
it. The occasion was a public flag raising, and
it happened to be on my birthday also. All the
pupils of the public schools marched uptown,
keeping time to the music of the band. We
weut around the plaza, saluted the Hag and
then and waved our own flags. Mr.
Lmigdon, our principal, was president of the
dny and introduced Mr. Mailings ana others
as speakers.
Mr. I>nwborn told tis about Mr. Hastings
having been In the war, and bow he had gone
from New York as a volunteer and was
wounded and had to be in a hospital for along
time. How the doctor had wished to cut off
his let?, but he would not allow them to do so.
Then he weut home, recovered, and after or
ganizing another company of volunteers went
back to the war, but was unable to serve long,
his health was too much broken.
Mr. Hastings resides near San Leandro and
has a bit; flagstaff in his yr.nl. He prcmlied
last tall, if McKink-y were elected, to give the
town a flagstaff. So he has kept bis promise,
It is aDout the finest one in the State.
I hope you will like my SKetch so 1 may join

is good enough. I should like to join the

I live on a ranch and have a horse. I can
ride or drive her. . The other day I drove her
to town, a distance of five miles, and I saw six
teams of ten horses each plowing on one
piece of land. In the summer men cut the

has taken The Call for three years. I enjny

I went to school last summer. I have two

I hope to see this in print. From a little

Grass Valley, Cal., March, 1897.
Editor Childhood* Realm: I am a little girl
12 years of age, and I nave seen a few letters
from Grass Valley in Thk Call, but as none
have described the place I thought maybe 1
could write something of interest about it. It
is a beautiful little city of about 7000 inhab
itants, situated in a kind of valley, as the
name would indicate. There are Methodist,
Episcopal, Baptist, Congregational and Cath
olic churches; also a convent, which is noted
all over the State. One of the deepest quartz
mines in the United States is located here. It
is named the Idaho, and has produced a mil
lion or two of dollars. There are a great many
mines here, and some have been very rich.
We have a nice climate. Being in the foot
bills we hare very little snow, and the heal in
summer is not extreme.
The narrow-gauge railroad, which took the
place of the old-time stagecoach, connects us
with the outside world. 1 remain your little
reader, Edna Rouner.

Dear Editor: My sister Winnie and I wrote
to you a long time ago, and our letters were
in print. Virnia wrote to you, but we did not
know it until we saw it in the paper, and of
course we were pleased and surprised.
I can solve a few puzzles, and enjoy the
work.
I am saving up enough money to buy a
canary-bird. I wash dishes for mamma, and
she pays me; pretty coon I shall have money
enough for it. I think they are nice because
they sing so sweetly.
Winnie and I are trying to raise some flow
ers; it is very hard because it is so cold up
here; we have pansies, pinks, violets and
geraniums. Some of our violets are in bloom
and they smell very fragrant.
1 should like very much to join the C. R. C.
Yesterday it snowed a great deal, but to-day
it has just snowed a little. Yours truly.

rear Editress: The poppy is our State
flower. lam a native son, and I like the State
of California, because it has the poppy and
the bear. There is nothing that I think pret
tier than poppies among the growing grain,
and when the grain is green and the poppy
orange the effect is beautiful.
I live in the northern part of the San
Joaquin Valley, rigbt in the midst of the big
wheat fields, and they are now covered with
poppies, for miles any way we may look from
our house. There are lots of other flowers, too,
but I do not think any as pretty as the poppy.

Pkoberta, March, 1897.
Dear Editor: As I have never seen a letter in
The Weekly Call from Proberta I thought I
would write one.
I am a little girl 12 years old and am in the
sixth grade. 1 have gone to school only four
years.
I have three petiâ a pony, a cat and a sheep.
My pony has a very long, crimpy mane, and
her tail nearly touches the ground. I can ride
all over the country on her.
I live about four miles from the schoolhouse
on a large ranch of 1900 acres.
Proberta, where I attend school, has many
large orchards, though it if a small place. It
consists of one hotel, a warehouse, a poitofflce,
a schoolbouse and several residences.
Proberta is about five miles from the Sacra
mento River. Red Bluff, the county-seat, is
â even miles to the north.
We take our dolls to school sometimes and
play that they go to Europe to see the many
beautiful old castles.
I should like to belong to the C. R. C. and
if I see my letter published may write you a
story. I remain, with a greeting to the C.
R. c, Lois Han-sen.
Stockton, Cal., March, 1897.
Dear EdUrets: You can hardly imagine how
much pleasure your page has given me during
my late sickness. I have just recovered from
a severe attack of the measles. Nearly every
child in Stockton has been sick with toe same
disease during these last few months. I have
had great trouble all my life with my eyes and
was entirely blind atone time, but I can see
real well now. My doctors were all very kind
to me and I love them dearly. Ob, Ido hope
that as I grow older my eyes will grow
stronger. It is very hard to be shut up in a
darkened room all day, but mamma reads to
me a great deal. I thought that the poppy
page was very pretty and that all the little
poems were so appropriate. I should like very
much to become a member of the C. R. C. I
remain, your little friend,

STAGE
Otis Skinner's idea! of a play, writ
ten for himself, by himself, is to be
surrounded wi:h a number of per
sonages familiar to grand opera, history
and the drama, all of whom are kept
busy during four acts in creating possi
bilities for Fabian Torelli, Italian soldier
of fortune, a role which, needless to say,
Skinner plays himself. These personages
either love nim hopelessly or they cling to
Mm with faithful devotion, take sudden
and violent fane es to him, apveai to his
I rotection, lay wicked plots of which he is
the victim and which he foils, or spurn
hs love, to sue for it :n the last act. In
short, he has lassoed some of the most
interesting characters that have lived in
history or on the mimic sta-e, and has
tamed them into puppets for the glorifi
cation of Fabian Toreili, "soldier of for
tune."
"A Soldier of Fortune" cannot be taken
with real seriousness except as an inter
esting manifestation of thÂ« inner ambi
tions and yearnines of a clever star actor.
1 suppose it la not too much to assume
thai in writing a play for himself Skinner
has created just such a character and just
such opportunities as appealed most to
his histrionic ambitions. If this be the
case it is evident that to be the hero of
one play is in not a lofty enough pinnacle
for his vaulting ambition â he prefers to
be the hero of several plays, historic epi
sodes and grand operas rolled into one.
Realizing that the other dramatis per
sonse are of absolutely no importance, out
side the absorbing mission of providing
opportunities lor Fatian Torelli (Otis
Skinner to boot), the actor-author has
u?ed a job lot of characters that might
have been picked up. rather damaged, but
telow cost, at an auction sale. There are
the Duke's jester, Barzo and his daughter
Giannina, who have "seen better days"
under the name of Rizoletto, and Gilda.
Tcrelli's faithful, antique retainer is twin
brother of Adam of "As You L;ke It"
fame. Blanche Daubigny, who loves Tor
elli madly, passionately and hopeless:}',
performs quite a numoer of deeds which
are sacred to the memory of Shakes
peare's Viola, she who "never told her
love." Sometimes one is reminded of
'Romola"; in the last act "The Prisoner
of Zenda" comes unbidden to the mind,
and there are moments when Donizetti's
"Lucrezia Borgia" seems to have been
turned into a prose drama.
Three great historic characters have
been dallied with in "A Soldier of For
tune" â Macciavelli, Cse^ar Borgia ana
Lacrezia Borgia; three of the most terri
ble names in history. The very word
"Macciavelli" suggest* all that is clever,
tortuous and crafty. I expected pearls of
wisdom to drop irom the lips of the
Florentine statesman every time he
opened bis mouth. The most oracular
sentence that Otis Bkinner has given him
to say i<=, "You may find your honor
again, mv man â who knows?" just as if
Torelli's honor were a thing he had lost
by the roadside, that some pasier-hy who
chanced to be honest might pick up and
restore to him. J. W. Constamie played
the role of Macciavelli in a limp ami
flabby way, as if be knew that fate and
Otis Skinner were too strong for him. A3
for the astute Cse*ar Borgia, he is depict
ed in the play as a blundering villain, and
Lucrezia Borgia is a mild-mannered lady,
with a passion for dancing with admirers
3 ounger than herself.
But no one cares about these job lot of
characters who provide opportunities for
Fabian Torelli. Fabian is the beginning
and the end, the Alpha and Omega, the
ne plus ultra of "A Soldier of Fortune,"
and Skinner playa the rolo exceptionally
well, investing it with a vim and daring
worthy of a better cause or a better play.
I believe if Otis tkinner were to write n
drama for some one else â say for bis
charming wife â he would be a greater
success as a playwright, as he would
probably he able to see things more pro
portionately. In "A Soldier of Fortune"
everything is distorted to drag in, willy
nilly, a constant stream of striking situa
tions and speeches for Fabian TÂ«relli.
There is enough action In the play â too
much âbut the audience pets tired, oh so
fired, of always seeing Fabian posing as a
hero, always doing breve deeds, always
foiling villains, and always holding the
center of the stage. Too much heroism is
more monotonous than too much villainy.
It is painful to me to appear carping in
criticising what is, after all, a well-meant
play, but for Skinner's own good I wish
he could be induced to call in some native
of Sunny Italy to give local coloring to
his pronunciation. There seems to be an
Impression throughout the company that
anything will pass for Italian thai Is "for
eign." In Florence the lingua toscana was
talkfd in Macciaveih's timj pretty naucl
as it is to-day, but Torelli does nut sa\
"Excuse me, ma'am," (Scusi, s:cnora)
when he meets, siares at and loves fai
Laura under circumstances which bear s
suspicious resemblance to the first meet
ing of Tito with Romola. Although To
reili is a Roman, and the proverb Â«ny
the Tuscan language never sounds so wel
as in a Roman mouth, lie stares at Lam
and strews the stane with the apo.o r
| "par-r-r-don," pronounced in a way Whirl
does great credit ;o his French ace >nt, bu
makes one wonder wby Italians sboulc
talk French among themselvos.
Another comical atcempt to be '*forÂ«
eign" is the persistent way in which ever
one calls Caesar Bjr-ia "Sap-amr." 1 air
not weli enough up in Borjiian nistory v
know who stood sponsors at the baptisma;
font for the darkest-riyed vMlnin in Oti;
Skinner's play, but if they were Italian;
they named him Cesare, and it is rougl:
on the Bjrgia to add to bis other crimp!
by making him an accomplice to the per
sistent mi-pronunciation of his own name.
If the company must be "foreign." they
might confine their flights of language to
the country they are supposed to be por
traying. Marie Evei.yn\

To-morrow evening Otis Skinner will
begin the third ana Just *veek of his en
gagement at the Baldwin Theater and
will present for the first time in thi-s City
his version of "King Richard III," which
is said to be a very unuiual reading of the
title role.
He is not the usual ranting, scene
tearing monarch that the theater-goers
are used to seeing, but is quiet in all that
he does. His argument for this is that
the King was far too much ol a diplomat
to allow himself to be carried away by
violent methods at every turn and re
sorted to them only as a last resort. The
version of the play which Skinner pre
sents is his OTrn arrangement. Daring
the past summer he took the first and
second folioa and Dy careful comparison
with the general acting edition, which is
tne arrangement of Colly Gibber, restored
as much of the original text as was pos
sible. Skinner will repeat "Richard 111"
on Saturday evening. On Tuetd ay even
ing and at the Saturday matinee he will
present "The Lady of Lyons."' On
Wednesday evening he will repeat ''The
Merchant of Venice," which will be fol
lowed by "The Taming of the Shrew," on
Thursday evening "Romeo and Juliet"
will be given and on Fiitlay evening
"Hamlet" will be the play.

A severe illness ha* deprived the stag's for
two season* of Miss Cayyan's services.
Prom this, however, she ha* now fully
recovered, and at ihe beginning of this
season she set about the accomDtishment
of a lons-cherished purpose, the return to
the stage at ibe head ot a stock company
of her own. "Squire Kate" was early
given a place in the repertoire of Miss
Cay van's company, and it is this piece,

form, and as a play it has been seen re
peatedly. It tells a story of love and de
votion which is blended with the plots of
Italian patriots and nihilists. Its scenes

The Chutes have a new attraction for
this week in t' c addition to their zoolog
ical collection of a family of coyotes.
Since the agitation in the Legislature on
the coyote-scalp question the manaee
ment thought it a good plan to let people
see the animals so much talked about,
and accordingly secured tnis interesting
family of lamb-stealers. Z^nfreila Hroiii

vaudeville feature is strong. Markeburg

When Moliere was dying he insisted on
acing to the last gasp, in order that his
players might not be disappointed of their
bread. Something of the same spirit was
shown in the recent death of Giaclnto Gal
lina, the Venetian playwrightâ¢ Until the
last he was conscious that his end was
neer, and the only prayer he addressed to
his doctor was: "Make me live until 1 can
finish my comedy, that my poor actors
may not be disappointed."
A correspondent says: "Poor Gallina
never knew what ease and comfort were.
Notwithstanding his rare talent he was
always poor. This mattered little to him
self. Bui he tried to struggle against pov
erty for the sake of those near and dear to
him. For them he lived, not for himself.
He did not even know how much he
earned by his comedies. So long as ne
could reckon on his daily brend that waa
all he aÂ«ked from them. Few men, and
no others in his position, live lrom day to
day as he did. At last the town of Venice
allowed him 1000 francs a year ($lH)0) to
keep him from starving and on that he
thought himself passim; rich. His funeral
was most imposing. He might nave been
a minister of state, an enibassador, a mil
iiona re, instead of a poor histrion. The
eireets were too small to contain all tbe
I eople who loved him, and wished to ac
company him to his in-c home. A bigoted
friar bad -aid that the histrion was not
worthy of a (Jurist lan 'a grave, but a little
child carried a cros* before his bier, amidst
a cloud of ilorul wreaths and bunches of
sweet liower?.
"In one of the last letters Gallina wrote
to a friend, he said that it was his opinion
that the drama, as an art, was dying.
Karce, he snys, may remain, but plays
which show life ami human character as
they nre, are no longer for this generation,
ror for luture generations. Vulgarity is
invading everything, and ha* an art of
itself. Af'er I have finished the comedy I
have begun (his last one, alaÂ«!) I shall
write no more in dialect. But 1 have
begun thisone, and I must finish it â unless
I die! More I cannot do!"
Poor fellow, be felt the band of death
upon him, even t en. Curiously enough,
the most sympathetic part in th.s last
work of Gallina is a priest. And no iTiest
would accompany his body to the grave !

The veteran actor John Jack has been giving
the Mirror some of his experiences. This is
one them:
My mind goes back to the rust American
prcsenmtion of "Camille" by Jean Mdrgaret
oavenport. In (he ballroom scene at the left
center of the stage, opposite second entrance,
was a table with three chairs*, arranged for the
game of cards. Opposite, Â»t the right, was a
sofa. In order to aid to these splendid prepa
rations lor a gala nlgtu there was a second
tnble adorned by elaborate candelabra, in each
arm ol which was a candle ready for ignition.
While the scene progressed a servant entered
with a tray of supposed ices, reaily coUou
stuffed into glasses. lie carried in one hand the
ice* and in the other a lighted taper. On this
occasion the servant had indulged in a little
banquet wherein foaming glasses of beer had
constituted the principal part of the feast. It
was his duty to place the tray on the table
and, with taper, illume the candles, in doing
which, in his unsteadiness, he set fire to the
cotton, presenting to the audience an extraor
dinary illusion of flaming ices, and retired,
unconscious of the conflagration and the merri
riment in the house, which seriously interfered
with the performance. Camille and Armand,
with their backs to the burning sensation,
were ignorant of the cause of the hilarious dis
turbance. Manager John Gilbert, waylaying
the servant without, directed him to return
and extinguish the flames, and the menial,
reappearing upon the scene, carefully blew
out the candles and fled, leaving the ices lv a
merry blaze. The curtnln was lowered, but
ihroughout the rest of tho evening the audi
ence could do noihiug but laugh.

TO EUROPE BY TROLLEY
In Thk Call of July 19, 1896. appeared
an article describing a submarine tube to
be used as a means of communication be
tween places separated by bodies of w.iter,
the manner ot operation being to force a
carriage through the tube by air pressure.
Considerable interest was awakened by the
proposition and its merits were widely dis
cussed, the opinion of competent engi
neers being that while the scheme was not
wholly impracticable, yet the difficulties
to be encountered were of too great magni
tude to warrant the construction of s-uch a
viaduct at the present time; the necessi
ties of transportation not being now be
yond the ability ol modern sariace carriage
to supply.
Modern genius is, however, never satis
fied with existing appliances, and it is con
tinually inventing and devising new ways
and methods, with appropriate machi
nery, to accomplish in less time and at less
cost and hazard what is now being done
with present appurtenances. Certainly
there would seem to be abundant room for
improvement in the matter of marine
transportation. For the high class
traveler, the cabin passenger, able and
willing to pay a couple of hundred dollars
for his passage across the Atlantic, there
is little more to be uesired in the accom
modations furnished him on the best of
the huge "greyhounds of the sea."
But for the one who does not
possess the plethoric pocketbook of his
more fortunate fellow, and so is compelled
to take passage in the steerage, there is
yet a great deal to be sighed for. But the
passenger traffic, while large, is only a
small portion of the traffic which passes
and repasscs on the seas and oceans. The
desires of man compel the services of im
mrnse flotillas to supply his wants. The
interchange of commodities which make
up what is called commerce is a part and
parcel of civilization, and that it will in
crease is patent to all. The land side of
commerce traffic is fairly well to do.
Celerity, certainty and safety are now ad
mirably combined in the railroad trans
portation ot to-day : but in marine trans
portation the man h of improvement has
not proceeded with Kjual speed. This is
measurably due to the fact that carriage
by water is confined to the surface of the
water, where it has to continnally contend
with adverse winds and currents, to say
nothing of waves which, forming an un
equal and ever-changing surface, add
very greatly to the resistance to be over
come by the vessel. It is also menaced at
all times by delay and wreckage resulting
from stormy and unfavorable weather.
Steam is gradually substituting the sail
on the main routes of ocean travel, but
for very many years the Hailing vessel
will maintain her place over those routes
less freqrented and will continue to make
her services appreciated in all cases where
celerity is not a factor.
There is one feature of ocean travel
which is common to both sail and steam
vessels, a feature which in the case of
many people amounts to prohibition
against seagoing. It is the motion of the
vessel. Large as may be buiided the
] colossal passenger steamer, there are
I waves in plenty to toss her to and fro,
: liner, thither, with as great ease as it
she were the smallest of the fleet. The
Great Eastern, the largest vessel ever
bnilt, so large, in fact, that she had to be
broken up because her immense size ren
dered her unwieldy, was pitclied and

tossed so terribly that her passengers on
one eventful trip were unable to stand
upon their feet, and a Cow was thrown
bodily through the skylight of the main
cabin into a group of wretched passengers
who were clinging to each other lor sup
port against the awful wrenching, toeing
motion.
The effect of wave motion does not ex
tend to very great depth. The extreme
height of the waves of the ocean at a dis
tance from land sufficiently great to be
freed from any influence of it upon their
culmination is about twenty feet. Such
waves may be a quarter of a mile between
crests, but their influence does not reach
very deep. The water is practically un
disturbed at a depth ot fifty feet. Even
the ocean currents, which are everywhere
found, are mostly at the surface; some ex
:end to depths of a thousand feet in
narrow channels like mat of the entrance
to the Mediterranean and the channel of
Mozambique, but the depths of the ocean
are always at rest.
It is now proposed to avoid the draw
backs and di comforts of ocean travel on
the surface and heieafter use the strata of
water betow all disturbance of wind and
wave as the new route. A modern genius
offers a plan utilizing the trolley to ac
complish the navigation of submarine
depths. His plan is a simple one, and
when the engineering works that the last
tew years have witnessed are considered
the scheme here described does not ap
pear impracticable.
The plan embraces the stretching of a
I continuous trolley condnit across the
ocean. The line is not exactly a "line,"
but is a sp.it tube of bronze or other metal
not oxidized by sea via er, made continu
ous by its sections being hinged in such
manner as to form an uninterrupted tube,
one side of which is open for the traverse
of the vessel's trolley. This tube is to be
held in position by nnchors. placed at
proper distances, and -it la held in suspen
i sion at the proper depth by metal floats
attached to the anchor chains. Perhaps
a better idea will be had by reference to
the accompanying drawing. Of course it
may appear at first thought that the mag
nitude of such an enterprise would be
fatal to its accomplishment, but nowadays
the size of the job does not deter modern
engineering from attempting it. The ves
sels engaged in transportation will be
buiit like hu<:e cigar-shaped spindles,
so as to make higu speed. They wil
SOME EARLY REMINISCENCES OF ADOLPH SUTRO
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, when
I first met ex- Mayor Adolpii Suiro, he
looked very mucli like the picture that is
reproduced herewith. The other day
when this engraving was Â«hown him he
said to me: "Yes â yes; to be sure. I re
membar that picture very well. It was
put on a lot of Butro*tunnel bonds thtt
were never issued. Some of my friend*
said it was intended as my portrait as I
looked in my working clothes with a pick
in my hands breaking ground for begin
ning the Sutro tunnel. Really, i never
felt very much flattered by tbe picture. I
thought it made me look too bald, and 1
imagined I was rather better looking.
Didn't you?"
Of course I could not refuse to acquiesce
in that opinion, for as a matter of fact
Mr. Sutro was quite dashins in appear

power, pushing work on the famous Sutro
tunnel, on the Conmock lode, editing the
Virginia City l>.ulv Independent, and
running for tbe United States Senate at
Carson, in opposition to William Sharon
first and afterward to John P. Jonev
At tbe same period he was traveling;
through tbe State of Nevada with a magic
lantern, giving illustrated lectures on tbe
doings ol the big mining company manip
ulators.
Journalism leemed to bare had a genu
ine fascination for Mr. Sutro at the time
be was conducting the Daily Independent.
He took a lively interest in every part of
tbe paper, ana had a high appreciation
of tbe importance of the local news col
umns. As may naturally be supposed, be

be propelled by electricity and it is
thougnt will be able to achieve at
least fiuy miles per hour, so that the trip
across the Atlantic may be made in sixty
hours. Recent discoveries in the rehabili
tation of the oxygen in air that has be*Â»n
vitiated by breathing removes all diffi
culty in the providing of pure air for tue
use of the occupants of the vessel. On
the under side of the trolley tube will be (
a submarine electric cable provided at
designated points with attachment de
vices, so that, if necessary, a vessel u=ing
the trolley will be able at any of these
points to establish electrical telegraphic
communication with tne shore. It is not
contemplated to use the trolley tube as
an electric force conductor to carry a cur
rent for the use of vessels. Each vessel
will be in itself independent, being
equipped with a new and improved form
of storage battery. By means of adjust
able tanks the vessel will be so balanced
as to have a slight excess of buoyancy, so
that if by any means connection with the
trolley tube should be broken the vessel
will rIM to the surface and would then
complete her voyape at the srrface.
Between the United States and England
the bottom of the ocean is of very even
surface. So level is it that it has received
the name of the "telegraphic plateau." It
is most admirably adapted to a mode of
service such as is here outlined.

A Painful Meeting.
A dramatic story was told at the Ham
ilton College alumni dinner in New York
the other evening. General Schuyler
Hamilton gave some interesting incidents
irom the life of his grandlather and de
scribed a raeeuii,' between Aaron Burr
and Mrs. Hamilton, daughter-in-law of
Alexander Hamilton and the mother of
tiie speaker, in 18.'S0. "As Colonel Burr
entered the room," he said, "my mother,
in extreme agitation, seemed about to faint.
Colonel Burr, noticing this, but not know
ing her, immediately went to the s.de
board, poured out a glass of water and
advanced to hand it to her. It was all
done most naturally, graceiully and
courteously. My mother shook her head
and murmured: '1 am the daughter of
Alexander Hamilton.' Without a word,
Colonel Burr placed the glÂ«s* of water on
the sideboard, bowed in silence to the
Misses Nathan and quietly retired. It
was to him, as to my mother, evidently a
very painful meeting. Colonel Burr
deported himself like a dignified gentle
man. 1 was a little boy about 8 year- oid.
Then I learned for the first time to
impress the fact upon my memory that
Colonel Burr had killed my grand

Recent years have developed in Mr.
Sutro an aptitude for superlatives that be
avoided wnile he graced the editorial tri
pod in Virginia City. He purposely
escaewed that style of wild and woolly
Western journalism that has been mtide
familiar to the world through the lucu

Nevada Self-Locker.
A favorite form of attack on the big
corporations that were attempting to
throttle the Suiro tunnel was to keep he

ALRED PARSONS, A.R.A.
No artistic event in the last ten years
has giyen rise to as much discussion in
London as the recent academy election,
by which John Sargent was chosen for the
full honors and Alfred Parsons and J. J.
Shannon for associate membership. All
three are practically Americans, that is to
say, ihey are, in the English acceptation of
the term. 1 here should be a word in the lan
guage to express that a man was not born
in the country to which he owes his alle
giance, either by the right of descent, by
the accident of birth, or by choice after
arriving at manhood. An artist is, as a
rule, a man who has become a citizen of
the world â who is at home in Tunis or
Japan, in London or Rome, on a Califor
nia ranch or in a Dutch village. The days
when an artiat was supposed to live on
air, and as little as possible of that, to be
distinguished chiefly by a colossal igno
rance of any subject but his own and a
superb superiority to such trivial matters
as his appearance, his food and his debts,
this golden age of simplicity has left not
a trace behind. Any eccentricity of any
kind is avoided with a care that becomes
almost as absurd as the ancient desire to
mark the professional by his long, un-

Kempt hair, his wildly rolling eye?, his re
markable clothes and 1m complete self
absorption.
The three new members of the academy
are natives of Cosmopilis, for Sargent
was born in Florence, the son of a Boston
puysician, and was educated partly in
America, but principally abroad; Shan
non, of Irish descent, was born and lived
in America until his fifteenth year, and
Parsons was born in Somersetshire, in
Alerrie England, but curiously enough he
aione of the three lived in America, -was
educated tnere, and only returned to
Kurope to study after he had reached the
a^e of 21. English artists speak of the
election with a mixture of admiration,
cordiality and regret that is not guiltiest
of a fine and somewhat horror-struck con
sciousness of their own generosity.

rather heated discussion, "we did it; we

One day John I. Ginn, who was nun- !
aging editor of the Ind- pendent, invited :
me to drive witii him from Virginia Uity I
to the town of Sutro, as it was neiesary !
for him to consult with Mr. Sutro on a
question ol importanci concerning next i
moning's iÂ«sne of the paper. After the
most urgent mission bad been disposed of
Mr. Sutro wheeled around in his chair and
exclaimed: "Ginn. d:d you ever see a
played-out, broken-down mining-camp?"
Mr. Ginn said that he had visited sev
eral of hose scenes of disaster.
"Well," continued Mr. Sutro, "that's
the kind of a place these big mine-owners
are going to make out of tbe Comstock
lode. T:.ey are just gouging out the heart
of the ore, instead of mining scientifically,
and the camp is bound to suffer. I would
like to have you assume the cbarcter of a
prophet and write a description of bow
tbe Comstock will look twenty-five years
hence."
Mr. Ginn did so. He pretended to give
a vision of t lie great mining district a
quarter of a century from that time. He
said ibat nothing could stop the woeful
waste of opportunities then going on, and
in view of tbis fact represented the bo
nanzas and ore bodies exhausted, the
thunders of the stampmills silenced for
if he be a gentleman and an artist, he is
voted for. I have been prond of my vote
ever since. I forgot that they were not
subjects of the Queen, but I have felt up
lifted, noble, above reproach, ever since I
have discovered that we have been a gen
erous example to the world. It makes a
man fesl like a monument."
There are a few voices, however, which
are hardly allowed to be heard and they
murmur: "What about the protection to
home industry! Here we are, hundreds
strong, knocking at the big cates. They
open up but once a year, and only three
men can enter; can you blame us if we
think it rather bard that the strangers in
the land have the preference and we must
wait the next opportunity I"
As a whole, however, the election was
received with acclamation, the sincerest
delight. The models who wait in the
conrtyard to bring the news :o the fortu
nate had a hard fight to earn their guinea.
The model who brings the news has, from
time immemorial, had that special claim,
and it is to be presumed that neither Mr.
Parsons nor Mr. Shannon was less gen
eral than his British conlreres.
Alfred Parsons lives in a little street on
Campden Hill, lice a country lane, in a
little square, squat, pray house, with a
bit of pardon, gay at present with spring
flower*. Tee trees are just touched with
a mist of green, but the wild plum, with
its little sharp distinct branches ami its
wave of brilliant blossom--, looks as though
It had posed for Mr. Parsons or for the
Japanese artists ne a-lmi.-es so genuine ly
and frequently reminds me of. The pray
stone pathway ltading to the bouse is full
of delicate leaves, and a straigut row ol
daffodils leads to the very door. The
studio is behind the house and is reached
by a long wooden passage, on the walls ol
which there is a running frieze of sketches
that just refuse to present themselves in
an accommodating spirit. They all lend
to Rome, or to Mr. Parsons' studio, where
a fire burns in the big, open grate, and
where there is much licht and a juggc
tion of bright things â poii^hed woods and
bronzes, light frames and water colors and
flowers everywhere. Everything is ciean,
clear in color and rather delicate, as the
ever, owis roosting in the Con. Virginia
hoisting- works, C street filled with coyotes
and wild goats ai:d the International Ho
tel, the Sawdust Corner and the Delta sa
loon turned over to the use of rattiesn&ks
and rats. That prognostication created a
sensation, and there was talk of lynching
the author, for it was not generally be
lieved that Â»nch a condition of affairs could
possibly come to pass.
The last time I visited Virginia City Mr.
Ginu's vision was gr.mly recalled to ray
memory.
The buildings represented in the ac
companying engraving were planned for
the use of the tunnel company, but more
unpretentious structures w?ra provided,
with the excep'ion of the superintendent's
residence that si ill stands on the sloping
hillside, commani'.ii'ir - view of the town
of Sutro and Carson River Valley to the
southward.
Popularity diJ not at that time seem io
be the goal of Mr. Sutro's ambition, and
he got rather more than his share of news
paper abuse, yet nis lectures were always
well attended and hisopponentsconfessed
that hi* campaigns cost them more money
than they cared :o lose.
In a recen- conTersation Mr. Sutro ex
pressed gratification at having laid down
the cares and burdens of public office,
which he thought did not yield sufficient
compensation In the way of benefiting
the community to tempt thoughtful citi
zens from the comforts of private life.
Speaking of the condition of his invert
men is in San Francisco realty Mr. Sutro
said: "1 have to thank D?nis Kearney for
the greater part of the acres I own on this
p-ninsula. You see, I was just telling out
my interests in Nevada and particularly
in the Sutro-iunnel enterprise, when
Denis Kearney began his crusade that
knocked the values out of real estate in
this City. I was looking around for a
chance to ?>lace my available capital to
advantage and mad â¢ up my mind that my
best chance was in the sand dunes of San
surroundings are of a rather fastidious
taste. â¢ -,". â 
Tnis big room leads into another,
seems practically out of doors, the ligh'.
seems to flood the place, it is everywhere.
- Evidently in real life as in his work Mr.
Parsons lias no use for the, darkâ no
mystery. of the "dim religious light" ap
peals to him. Personally, as he stands in
his own studio, he seems entirely in th*
right. He is yin light colored clothes,
although it is very early spring; his hair,
wbtn it is not prematurely silver, is
blonde; his eyes, of grayish blue, have an
expression of whimsical gayety, and with
the sunburned, hard freshness of his com
plexion, lie has that look of unquenchable
youth that so frequently accompanies a
man who spends most of the" time in the
open air, till the end of his days.
Mr. Parsons' work is as well known at
home as abroad ; wno has not seen tho~e
exquisite drawings that illustrate, with
Edwin Abbey's, Hernck's # and the Old
English Ballads, She Stoops to Conquer,
and many others? A Harper's Monthly
without a Parsons drawing has been a rare
number for the last ten years, or longer.
And during that time Mr. Parsons has
been frequently in America, in New York,
in the Carolines, in Southern California,
in San Francisco on his way to and from
Japan. l-_-X'
His sketchbooks are characteristicâ full
of exquisite drawings, as careful as those
of a botanist, 01 any strange flower, leaf,
Btirnb or tree that came under his notice.
Impressionism never drew Mr. Parsons
into the vortex; he never splashed in

about, like an unruly boy in the surf. Its
dangers and its pleasures had no fascina
tion lor him â clear, honest, finely drawn
sketches done lor the sharp characterisa

Japanese artist would do them, freely,
sharply and with grace.
In landscape he has no equals in his
own field â not, it must be confessed, a
very wide one. The one painted years ago
and bought by the terms of the Cbantrey
bequest. "When Nature Painted Ail
Things Gay," is painted with an exuber
ance, an enjoyment, a richness of color
that acts upon the observer lika a burst of
sunlight. It is music out of doors, and
for once Mr. Parsons uses the whole key
board. No meager illustration can doit
justice, for it is full of the very odor and
exhilarations of spring. It has not the
depth of a Courbet, but far more spon
taneous feeling lor the crisp, sharp cbange
of light on blossoms and tree.' and sheep
and water and the earth that flies an em
erald nag, and is brilliant with trans
parent shadows that drop from the shin
ing clouds over the treesâ that are
bouquets of bloomâ to the earth, that La
at once tight and solid.
The work of later years has been all
played "in the treble," so to speak, and
the landscapes in oil have been a little
thin, a little like water colors, while the
water coiori have had the solidity usually
connected with oils.
The water colors strike a finer and
truer note; their occasional hardness oniy
accentuates their tirmness, their delicate
and finished brilliance.

Wells Deobt.HOW TO STUDY THE BIRDS
I heard him for a day or two before I
finally set forth with the determina
tion of rinding him. Half a dozen
times this spring I have thought I
caupht that ringing, musical shout from
some tall tree top. Once I fancied I saw
the bird, but creeping nearer the visitor
proved to be the varied thrush, one of the
handsomest of our coast birds. But when
at last the genuine note greeted my ears
a moraine or two ago I knew that I had
been misled on other occasions. The song
was unmistakable. No bird but the black
headed grosbeak sings just that way, loud,
clear, decided, a brilliant whistling per
formance, full of defiance, of exultation
and brimming - over jollity. "Sweet!
>weet! sweet!" He calls, and then the
words tumbling out as though he were in
the biggest 3ort of a hurry and afraid you
should miss him after all. "Here lam !
here I am! here I am!" slurring the first
two words with a rising inflection and
dropping on the "am."
They are not all in the imagination of
bird Jovers, these phrases that birds seem
England's Proposed "Fastest War Vessel" Afloat in the World, the "Express"
The English Government is engaged in
building wnat it hopes will be, when com
plete, the fastest boat in the world. Its j
object in constructing this craft is to I
possess a vessel that will be superior to j
the Admiral Porter, owned by tbe United ',
Htates and until a short time ago known ;
as 'Torpedo- boat No. 6. This craft that i
Britain is building is des'gued to steam j
33 knots an hourâ a trifle less than 38
miles.
The Express â for that is the name of
the proposed record-breakerâ is now in
process of construction at the shipyards
uf Laird Bros, at Birkenhead. Her en
gines are to be capable of attaining 10,000
indicated horsepower. Tbe tremendons
power of this tiny boat â for she is of only
3-'>o tons burden â can best be appreciated
by considerine the fact that she will be
able, if the plans succeed, to develop lully
as great an engine-power as the Renown,
a battle-ship now building for England
wbich will nave a displacement of 12.550
ton?. The Express will have as an arma
ment one 12- pounder quick-tiring gun,
five 6 and 3 pounder quick-firing guns
and two Whitehead torpedoes.
While it is not known with certainty
how the machinery will be arranged or
tne exact dimensions thereof, it is under
stood they will be as follows: Each set of
engines will have four cylinders, the
diameters of which will be: High pres
sure, ISJ.Â£ inches; intermediate, 32}^
inches; two low pressure of 33>j inches.
Each engine is of the three stage com
pound type, the stroke for ail cylinders
bein^ eighteen inches. The most
noticeable point about tne engine lies in
the arrangement of the valves. Tbe high
and intermediate pressure cranks are
similarly located, although at right angles
to the high and intermediate cranks.
The arrangement described renders the
design of valves adopted possible. All
the valves are combined in pairs, one
above another, in one chamber, each pair
having a common valve-rod. The result
of this is a reduction of the number of
moving parts and renders possible that
very desirable arrangement of placing the
engine in less fore and aft space. Tne
air-pump is worked. direct from the main
crank shaft This latter is prolonged
through a small crank shaft, a coupling
joining the two. The diameter of the
pump is nineteen inches and its length of
stroke four inches. The material used is
such as to render breakages necessarily
rare, for both piston and top cylinder
covers are made of forged steel.
A cylindrical copper condenser, each

John Bonner's Views on the Future Prospects of the University of California
The regents of the university will be
confronted at their meeting on Tue-day
with the alternative of abolishing the
viticultural and horticultural departments
or of providing for their maintenance out
of the fund intended for the general ob
jects of the institution. Tne Governor's
veto of the special appropriation for their
support devolved upon the regents the duty
of deciding -whether it is best to lei those
departments lie in abeyance for a couple of
years or to carry them on by stinting the
educational branches of the university.
And while the value of the viticultural
department and the horticultural stations
is not to be questioned, it is less than that
of the work of the university at large in
fulfilling its general purpose of instruc
tion, so that tin regents could hardiy be
censured if they sacrificed the smaller
duty so as to be able to fulfill the greater.
The trouble has arisen from the unex
pected development of the demand for
higher education in this State. Ten years
ago there were 306 students et the univer
sity and the Legislature felt that it was
liberal in adding to its other sources of in
come 1 cent on each $100 of property â a
resource which yielded $96.0U0 in 1887 and
$112,000 in 1886. Now there are 1564 stu
dents, besides 720 in the nHiliated depart
ments. Tne sum of $112,000 voted this
year â half of which is to be reserved for
permanent improvements â is only a
trifle in comparison with the snm which
is really needed to enable the university
to fulfill its purpose. How widespread is
the craving for higher education may be
realized from the lact that while the un
dergraduate roll at Berkeley has swollen
in ten years from 306 to 2274 the new Le
land Stanford University is educaiins 1100
etud2nts, and the ru-h of spplicants is
such that Mrs. Stanford, in her recent ad
mirable address to the trustees, observes:
"We should not be ambitious to increase
the present number of students for some
years."
Ail over the united States the public
mind is permeated with the great truth
that high civilization and popular self

TORPEDO-BOAT DESTROYER "EXPRESS," BEING BUILT BY ENGLAND TO BEAT OUR NEW NAUTICAL FLYER, "ADMIRAL PORTER."
The construction of the boat with re
gard to safety, if the plans are carried out,
will be as remarkable as her capacity for
speed. She will have all the compart
ments that her size will permit, and al
though the ordinary torpedo-boat can be
smashed like an eggshell, this destroyer
money cannot be better employed thun in
supporting institutions of higher educa
tion. Few of the older universities have
less than a million income; some have
considerably more; even in such new
States as Wisconsin and Nebraska, witn
less than half as many university pupils
as we ftave, the Legislatures have grant- d
4' 4 cents ana 8% cents on the $100 of prop
erty valuation respectively to support
their universities; while the institution at
Berkeley is struggling along with $2G0,000
a year.
In every part of this wide country peo
ple are realizing that if government t>y the
peotiie is to be & success it must be admin
istered by men of conscience and culture.
As President Jordan well put it, "Nothing
can save the Naiion if it consists 01 weak
lings and fools, with an aristocracy of
knaves as their masters." It is being felt
all round that the salvation of democracy is
the modern universitj' witn its high ideals,
which impart wisdom and fitness to the
common man. Hence tho throng of younc
men and women who crowd the avenues
to university portals. Lawmakers should
ace to it that these hungry and thirsty
iouls do not go swhv unsatisfied. A beg
garly pittance of $5tf,000 a year will not
answer the purpose, where 12274 pupils are
craving for instruction.
Universal suffrage, which is the govern
ment of the state by ihe most ignorant
portion of its citizens, is only justified by
the impracticability of any alternative;
but universal tuffrage under a regime of
high mental development wrought out by
a university might bo as nearly ideal a
system of government as is practicable
with the imperfections of humanity. "We
hope," said the president of Stanford at
the opening of that university, "to give
to our students the priceless legacy of the
educated man, the power of knowing
-what really is, so that he can lead and
teach." So another president, the vener
able Dr.Wooltey of Yale, said he was edu
cating "the captains of men." Asassiz
poured the same thought into vivid word?
when he said: "There are necessities
which only the destitute student knows.

rang from the tree fops, and the hills sent
it bacK. It sounded simultaneously in
tbe willows by tha stream and from the
pasture above my head, but I came upon
him quite unexpected;;.' at last in a pile of
half-burnt brush, singing away as if he
would burst his throat.
There are two other birds with which
the novico may confound the black-headed
grosbeak. One of tuese is the Oregon
towhee, or ground robin, which sometimes
appears about here in the early spring. I
do not remember to have seen one this
year, but last year in the late winter 1
encountered several. Pipilo Oregonis is a
bird about tne size of our common ground
robin, with a shiny black heaa and back,
upper part of the breast black, with the
sides of the body and under wing coverts
a reddish brown. He is black-and-white
in wings and tail and the lower parts of
his body are white. He has a black bill,
which i 3 more slender Â»han that of the
grosbeak, and bright red eyes. In fact,
upon analysis, about the only mark he
has in common with the grosbeak is the
will be armed with a ram that will, ac
cording to calculations, be able to pierce
the sides of a battle-ship.
As far as danger to herself is concerned,
if a baUle-sbip or any other armored craft
should strike her a fair blow she would be
mere likely to turn turtle than to sink.
Her steering appaiatus is of such a nature
that it will act much more quickly than
that of the ordinary crafL If she answers
her helm perfectly it will be possible to
turn the boat almost as quickly and easily
as one would rein a horss to either side of
the road or turn about.
An attempt will bo made to have the
accommodations lor ofiicers and crew
he highest charity can understand and
relieve; every dollar given for bigh educa
tion, in whatever department of knowl
edge, is likely to have a greater influence
on the future cbaracterof our Nation than
even the thousands, hundreds of thou
sands and millions which we have spent
or are spending to raise the many to
material e;ise and comfort."
It is only in our day that the value of
j education has begun to le realized, and
I that we rank the teacher a little above the
I tailor. We build palaces for our petty
I larcenists, but we lodee our lenders of
j thought in shanties. What is the conse
j quence? Listen to the speeches delivered
jat public meetings, and to the doctrines
applauded by the masses! Note how
often politicians pretend to entertain
i opinions which in their hearts they loathe,
and contribute ignoble pages to the his
tory of their times. A wider diffusion of
knowledge and truth, such as would flow
from the influence of high-bred university
I graduates, would send these hypocrites
I howling to their holes, overwhelmed by
j public scorn. In the absence of that in
fluence we send to Congress not our wise-t
men, but those who think as the majority
of the people think.
Californians will not do justice to them
selves or their State until their university
can count upon an income of a million a
year. It was Emerson who said that a
dollar in a university is worth more than
a dollar in a jail. And the dollar must be
contributed by the state. It is beyond the
power of individuals to found and main
tain educational institutions which shall
stamp their impress on the people at
large; hence, :uo3t of our State constitu
tions provided that some measure of edu
cation should Le supplied at the public
expense, leaving- its expansion to tne
judgment of an enlightened future. How
much it should cost to train a pupil ac
cording to thef ruies of modern high edu
cation it were dilticult to say; but as tho
true function ot the university professor is
not to deliver lectures or hear recitations,
but to stimulate the student's ardor for
research and to guide him in his study, it
is evident that the best results will be at
black head, and this in our bird is marked
off at tho back by a distinct light collar,
which the Oregon towhee does not have.
The grosbeak has a heavy olive-hued bill,
hVsh-colored at the base; his throat, breast
and under parts are a light cinnamon
brown, the middle of beliy and under
wing coverts paie yellow that at times
looks whitish ; there is a white band across
his wines and some white in his tail on
the turee outer primaries, near the tips.
His eyes are brown.
If I had not maiie a great many mistakes
of my own, I should wouder how the
varied thrusli could ever be taken for the
grosbeak, yet experience teaches me that
this is rather a frequent blunder. Inex
perienced students go afield to find the
black-headed bird, and eagerly greet any
feathered creature bearing this somewhat
common mark. The varied thrush has a
handsome biact bead, a throat and breast
of deep orange red, set off by a glossy black
crescent from shoulder to shoulder. There
iÂ« a patch of orange above the eye, con
tinuing to a stripe back of if, his belly is
white; he has two light orange-colored
bands across his wings, and most of his
tail feathers have a terminal patch of
grayish white. He has a rather long,
slightly curved black bill and yellow feet
These thrushes, also called the Western
robin, are quite frequent visitors about the
bay during the winter, and are said to
have a pleasant song, which I have never
heard. During the earlier spriug there
were several pairs about the bouse, but
they seem all to have disappeared a fort
night *ince.
Except knowing the plants there is no
greater delight when we take our walks
abroad than to be able to recognize the
birds we hear and see. Scientific accuracy
is by no means necessary to this pleasure.
For all practical purposes it is enough to
know that yonder little brown bird on the
mustard stalk is a flycatcher. Whether it
beTownsend's, Hammond's, Say's.Traill's
or Cassin's flycatcher nt-ed not trouble
your mind any more than it does his as
he sits there elevating and depressing his
tail and shaking his wings in true fly
superior to those in any torpedo-boat de
stroyer afloat. The problem of air to the
people who live between decks has always
been very unsatisfactory in point of solu
tion. Xo matter tiow perfect the apparatus
for giving them plenty of oxygen, there has
always been a sad lack of the elements
that go to make up the purity of atmos
phere. The Express, however, is to have
vents for the foul air and mode? of ineress
for fresh air that will result in supplying
ail hands with a full measure of that
which the lunps need so much.
Besides tuis, the ventilating system is a
great improv-ment over that of all other
craft of a similar class. This is shown in
tamed where the number of students is
not unduly large.
At Chicago, President Harper reckons
that a professor is doing his duty if he
trains thirty pupils. In the universities
of the past several score of students were
taught by one professor, and all were edu
cated on one uniform plan. But young
men are not uniform ; they are all unlike;
the training which develops one will be
thrown away upon another. To do his
duty a professor must know the aptitude
of his scholars, and treat each of them ac
cording! 3-.
Again, it is great teachers who make
great universities, and great teachers, like
great lawyers and great doctors, ar6 high
priced. ".House your university in a tent
if need be." said Cardinal Newman, "but
stock it with the ablest men you can find
anywhere."
Some forty odd years ago the University
of Toronto wanted a professor of natural
history. Among the applicants was an
Englishman named Thomas Huxley, who
was known as the author of ingenious
papers on science. It was evident that
he knew his business, but he had a com
petitor in tue person of a graduate of the
university, and the authorities, desiring
to foster native talent, gave the po6t to
tbe Canadian and declined Huxley's ser
vices. They may have been wise in their
day and generation. But as a matter of
fact there are well-informed people to
day who never heard of the University of
Toronto, whereas if Huxley had been a
prolessor there it would have become
famous and would have attracted stu
dents from all parts of the world v It is
strong men who make universities strong.
Some one may say that the aspirations
of the advocates of nigher education con
template an expenditure which people
cannot afford. Suppose we reckon what
ignorance and its consequencesâ crime
and pauperism â cost, and calculate how
much nionpy would be spared for the
right training of mankind if the outlay
for these ex penditures were reduced. At
the present day the people of France and
Germany are kept poor by the enormous
expense of their armies and navies. The
catcher fashion. In general he is your fly
catcher and mine, and in the ultimate be
belongs to the great scheme of nature, and
there is One who knoweth should he fall
to the ground. You may know that he is
a flycatcher by onserving aim at his work.
Hegoosatthis in characteristic fashion,
perching in a favorable spot, watching for
pas-sing insects, then darting forth, seiz
ing his prey and flying back to his perch.
No-other bird feeds in quite this way.
Then his constant trick of jerking his tail
up and down and shaking his wings wil
serve to identify him. The flycatchers
belong to this continent, and are not
singers.
"I long to get out into the country and
see the creatures perform," some one said
to me recently. Ah, but admission is not
so easily obtained as that. If wo hold sea
son tickets and walk worthily as we go
about the woods and fields we shall see
what we shaii see and be blest in the see
ing, but to go out from the city, to climb
a well-worn trail with a goodly company
of congenial people, will not bring one
into the haunts of the birds. We must
leave the mainly traveled roadÃ and take
to the byways. Goldfinches, yellow war
blers, buntings aim robins, are to be seen
readily enough in frequented places, but
in the deep canyons are the shy thrushes,
among the high-growing woods are the
wood warblers and tnnasjers, the wrens,
vireos and the fleet-footed ground birds,
quail, partridge, woodcock and half a hun
dred others that we can get to know anct
love in their life. It is not necessary to
kili a bird to know it. John Burroughs
tells somewhere of meeting on his tramps
a thrush of a variety unknown to him.
He had never seen the bird before, so he
shot it to get a good look at it. It proved
to be the gray-cheeked thrush, a rare va
riety of the TurdidfÃ. "I would give
much to hear its song," says the writer in
closing bis account of how he silenced the
songster. The man abroad with a gun
abandons pro tern, his responsibility to
nature. The sportsman's instinct seems
stronger than the human.
On the coast of Nova Scotia some years
part by the accompanying illustration. It
is further apparent, too, that while on
most veÂ»sel3 of this sort the crew is com
pelled to remain below when the sea is at
all heavy, on the Express the decks
will be of use in very rough water.
The Express will carry no sail, what
mast and ringing she ha? being intended
for signal purposes. The executive offi-
cer, or the captain, as the case may be,
stands on the littlo square bridge just
abaft the winch and cons the ship from
that point. From the conning-tower and
turret combined, on which the bridge
rests, projects the 12-pound rapid-tire gun.
Most of the guns, however, are between
Stales of this Union spend enough for
police, criminal courts, the prosecution of
crime and the maintenance of hospitals
and asylums for the sick, for paupers and
lunatics to endow universities richer than
any now existing anywhere in tha world.
Now, the fruii of high education â not
mere book learning, but the training of
the mind and the heartâ is to restrain
the tendency to crime, to take away the
vocation of the policeman and the crim
inal Judge, to check the spread of disease,
to diminish the volume of pauperism and
insanity, to prevent the occurrence of in
ternational quarrels and to restore to pro
ductive industry the millions of men
who are now enlisted as soldiers. This is
made c. early manifest by a glance at the
past.
The story of history is a tale of endless
human suffering from wars, famines, epi
demics, waste and brutality. As educa
tion has made progress, these several
causes of woe have gradually diminished
in intensity ; there are fewer wars, slavery
has disappeared, disease is kept in check,
famines are rare, crime ia less rampant.
With education have come knowledge,
wisdom, tolerance and kindness. Within
a century, prisoners Icr debt in New Eng
land were confined in cellars out of whose
windows the wretched captives stretched
their hands to passeraby begging for a
crust of bread, and at the same time
Pennsylvanians with shotguns drove yel
low fever patients out of the suburbs of
Philadelphia. From such an abyss ot
barbarism, our progress in a s'ngle
century certainly Tarrants the belief that
another century will witness a correspond
ing advancement in further civilization.
Already signs are not wanting that the
pseudo-virtue called patriotism, which has
inspired some of tbe worst crimes in his
tory, is making way for a wider concep
tion of humanity and a higher manhood,
based on love ol man, is taking its place.
Its progress is s.'ow. Old traditions are
deep rooted. The conservative element is
always potent, and the sensitive reformer
shrinks from inviting the epithet of crank.
But, iv the language of one of our best
thinkers whom I have already quoted,
ago there was known to exist a great auk,
the last of Jts spscies. A hunter went
forth one day ana ohot it and the ereat
auk became extinct. Enough birds have
been killed in every locality, have been
identified and described, to enable the
tatient student to identify, with the aid
of keys, almost any bird he is likely to en
counter. If you are setting out for a sys
tematic study of the subject a good hand
book of the birds will be helpful in giving
you a general idea. There is none that
covers the field on this coast, but as birds
are broad-minded travelers, with no petty
prejudices against East or West, some va
rieties of most Eastern species are sure to
be found here, and the guides to the birds
of Eastern North America wiil be found
useful in the West as well. It is impor
tant to visit as many good collections of
birds as possible. A good fieldglass is an
essential in studying birds, but the wise
student will accustom himself to watch
ing them with the unaided eye as well as
with the glass. It is easy to become de
pendent upon the latter.
When ou; on a bird hunt dark-gray or
brown clothing is best to be worn and a
soft cap that cannot be hurt by crawling
through bushes, or, as is sometimes nec
essary in creeping near to a shy bird, by
fastening leaves and branches upon it as
a screen. It is necessary to walk softly,
and the best point of vantage for observa
tion is usually close to the trunk of a tree,
where, sitting or standing quietly, one be
comes to all appearances a part of the
landscape. More often than not, on first
looking up no birds are to be seen, but a
little peering about will show them if
they are there. Usually tha shadow of a
bird will be noticed first. It will *all upon
the ground or show among toe leaves and
reveal the more substantial figure causing
it. It is useless to try to make the bird
out until we get between it and the sun.
It is impossible to see colors with the
sun in our eyes. The points to notice if
the bird i? a stranger, is size, and it is con
venient out here, to record the size with
reference to the size of the robin, sparrow
or goldfinch. These represent three types
decks and tbe firing is done through port
holes. A shot from the 12-pounder, how
ever, would send the majority of torpedo

is, as a rule, small hope for those who man
her.
The illustration herewith shows exactly
how the Express will look when steaming
in search of victims. That she will make

to state upon the very highest authority
"the decline and fall of venerable Institu

Perhaps â who shall say?â the govern
ments of the future will embrace not
three branches â the legislative, the ex
ecutive and the judicialâ but four, the
fourth being the educational. It would
not be a novelty. Time was when the
universities of Paris, Oxford and Leyden
were part, and a very important part, of
the governments of their respective coun
tries. It was the University of Paris
which burned Joan of Arc. Oxford has
for centuries sent two members to Parlia
ment, generally the most distinguished
members of me body. Leyden was a
rampart behind which Dutch Protestant
ism defied its foes. Nor was there any
thing incongruous in the power which
gradually fell into the hands of these uni
versities. They counted am one tbeir
members the ablest men of the day, and
if they made mistakes the mistakes are
chargeable to the spirit of their age and
to the imperfect development of its
philosophy.
An ideal university at Berkeley should
be a leader of California thought, not sec
tarian or partisan, but such thought as is
naturally evolved from first principles by
honest searchers after truth. The expo
nents of that thought would be the mem
bers of the academic senate with the post
graduate body. But His hardly necessary
to observe that this idea will be a mere
iridescent dream so lone as tbe institu
tion has to live on a pittance of $260,000 a
year. Such a pauper institution cannot
indulge Hopes of an efficient post-graduate
body.
Unless future legislatures should realize
the importance of granting to Berkeley an
income wbicb will enable it to cope with
similar institutions at tne East, the Re
gents will sooner or later be compelled
to consider the conditions which have in
auceu Mrs. Stanford to warn tbe trustees

Police Who Are Linguists.
The police of Kobe, Japan, are perhaps
tbe greatest linguists among the police
and are familiar to most of us. What is the

markings, and how are they distributed?
If there are none is the color of the upper
parts uniform or are these parts mottled?
Tne wing? may have one or two bar 3of

where it shews in flight, is about the
easiest of Identification marks to remem
ber. Toe white bars on the goldfinch's
wings nre very conspicuous when he dies.
The snowbird shows two conspicuous
white tail feathers in flying and may be
known by them. The song sparrow also
has two white tail feathers. This little
bird has a way of running along the road
before one, flying ahead a little distance
as he is approached, and the white feath
ers show very plainly then. Tne wrens
may be known by their short wings and
saucy, up-tilted tails. In time the differ
ent varieties become familiar to us and
easily identified. Tha bill should ba no

bird's head? What is its co!or? Is it tlat

or unusually large and heavy? The color
of the feet is often of importance as a

The birds are suspicious and be who
would observe them must go about with
an air of having plenty of business of bis
own to attend to. The tieldglass must ba
raised cautiously. I have frightened many
a bird by neglecting this rule. We may
make a note of all these points and when
we reach home look them up in some re
liable bird book. Perhaps Chapman's
"Birds of Eastern North America" is the
best for beginners and. if not relied upon
too implicitly, Cooper's voiume on birds
in the California geodetic survey may be
suggestive and helpful. The study will
seem a blind sort of one at first, but pa

Forward, forward, o'er the starlit sea.

For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting

& MINERS
Tne call of the National Mining Bureau of
Denver for an international gold miners' con
vention in that city Juue 15 and lt> next lias

given it any particular attention. There is no

A valuable Contribution to the slowly in
creasing knowledge ol the oil resources oi Cali
fornia is Bulletin 11, by the State Mining
Bureau, on "Oil and Gas Yielding Formations
of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Btirbara
counties, part I," by Field Assistant W. L.
Watts. Mr. Watts has spent two years or more
in the exc'.uiive study of the oil fields, mainly
of Southern California, and this illustrated
pamphlet ol 100 page;-, oi which 3000 copies
have Just been printed, gives the net results
of his work in the territory mentioned.
While this bulletin is one of the results of
the administration of State Mineralogist Craw-
lord, who has just retired, it is a reminder
that the oil fields of California are about to be
studied more extensively than ever and that
we may be at the eve of a great development
of the oil resources ot the State. Along the
coast, from Humboldt County to Los Angeles,
and in the foothills of the San Joaquin Valley
there are a multitude of signs of oil-bearing
formations, but except in a district of South
ern California there has yet been practically
no prospecting or scientific sludy of them.
The new State Mineralogist, A. S. Cooper, has
acquired a great personal interest in the oil
and asphalt resources of the State and pro
poses to vigorously push their exploration
during his term of office. He expects to do a
great deal of field work in this line himself
and has in contemplation a bulletin dealing
A LOS ANGELES OIL WELL.
with the subject in a general way. Mr. Watts j
Is spending this season at further work in the i
southern field and Harold W. Fairbanks is I
studying the economic geology of a territory
in San Luis Obispo and Sania Barbara coun
ties. Ail this work stimulates the interest in
the possibilities of oil outcroppings and af
fords information of value in prospecting and
developing.
In Los Angeles County petroleum is the
chief mineral T>rodur.t, amounting to nearly a
million barrels in 1895, and coming from three
fields, those oi Los Angeles City, the Puente
hills and the mountains near Newhall. The
wells in the city of Los Angeles have excited
the most interest since tbelr discovery. For
many years a small deposit of crude oil on
West State street was used for fuel, but it was
not until 1^92, wnen Dobeny & Connor
â¢unk a ehait 155 feet deep lor luck, that the
rich deposit was made known. The develop
ment was soon in full blast with much excite
ment, and m 1895 the highest production was
reached. The product oi 300 wells fell to 50
cents a barrel through lack of co-operation
and storing facilities. The production is now
greatly reduced through the partial exhaus
tion of the supply, but the advance in price to
$1 50 per barrel has been an offset.
In the Los Angeles field the oil deposit Is a
stratum of sand irom 100 to 150 feet thick,
containing about forty feet of "pay dirt"
tilted at varying angles, averaging about 40
degrees. Iv depth the wells range from GOO
to 1100 feet, according to location. So fir as
developments have shown, the field of this oil
bearing stratum has an area of about 4,000,000
square leet, containing at the start, by esti
mate, 2,850,000 barrels of oil. About a third
of this total has been pumped out, and profit
able operations have largely ceased. Many
wells will continue to pay moderately for a
good while, with only occasional pumping.
It is Mr. Watts' opinion that the field day bs
recovered outside of its present Louudaries.
Iv the Puente hills are twenty-h've produc
ing wells, which yielded 100,000 barrels of oil
in 1895 from depths of 700 to 1500 feet. The
Puente Oil Company operates a pipe line fif
teen miles long to its refinery atChiuo. There
are a number of oil fields in Ventura, mainly
controlled by the Uiuon Oil Company of Santa
I'aula, and producing 245,000 barrels in
1895. The Summerland and oiuer oil fields
an i bituminous deposits of Sauta Barbara
County arc minutely described.
The geology of all these deposits is made the
important feature, though with the compli
cated problems presented it will require years
of expert study to collect the data for an ade
quate and reliable description of these oil
yielding formations.
â¢Since the price ef oil at Los Angeles has gone
up so hign the Santa Fe road has discontinued
the use of oil as fuel and has gone back within
a few weeks to bod. A chapter devoted to the
fuel tests of oil show* that, with coal at $6 65
per .on and oil at $1 33 per barrel, the saving
by usinx oil was 27.1 percent. Other experi
ments make still better showings.

ITS USEFULNESS GONE.
No One Now Attends the Local
Passenger Asscciation
Meetings.
Forrml Dissolution Will Take Place
on the First Day of Next
Mcnth.
As a result of the recent decision of the
United States Supreme Court against
railroad and other trusts and com
binations the San Francisco and Oak
land Local Passenger Association has
gone to pieces.
The first withdrawal notice was given
by the local agent of the Burlington and
Missouri River Railroad. Thi9 whs soon
followed by that of the Rio Grande West
ern. A notice of withdrawal by any one
road requires the calling of a special
meeting to act on the matter. When the
notices were sent out on March 29 by Sec
retary W. W. Smith relative to the Rio
Grande Western's withdrawal a quorum
failed to respond and it has been found
impossible to secure the presence of the
requisite number of members since. It is
understood that the persistent absentee
ism ol the representatives of the roads
which have not yet formally signified
their withdrawal is due to instructions
received from headquarters in the East.
Meanwhile, one after another, the ma
jority of the lines Dave withdrawn, as fol
lows: Atchison, Topeka ana Santa Â¥c;
Atlantic and Pacific, Burlington and Mis
souri River, Canadian Pacific, Central Pa
cific; Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific;
Northern Pacific, Rio Grande TVestero,
Southern Pacific Company (Atlantic sys
tem). Southern Pacific Company (Pacific
system), Chicago and Northwestern. Van
derbilt lines, Denver and Rio Grande.
The roads that have not formally with
drawn are: The Great Northern, Oregon
Railway and Navigation Com Dan v, Texas
and Pacific, I'nion Pacific; New York,
Ontario an<l Western; Pennsylvania lines;
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; Dela
ware, Lacksiwanna and Western ; Judson's
Excursion Agency.
As matters now stand the local associa
tion is dead to all intents and purposes, as
even the representatives of the roads
whicn are still nominally members of it
dare not attend ans' meeting, and it is,
therefore, impossible for the organization
to transact any business. Last Wednes
day was the regular monthly meeting day
of the association, Dnt not even the for
mality of sending out notices was at
tempted by the secretary.
The expenses of the association, it is
stated, are guaranteed by all the former
and existing members until the end of
this month. Unless something develops
in the interim that will permit its con
tinuance it will go out of existence by
formal dissolution.
The object of the organization was to
bind members under penalties of heavy
tines not to cut rates. It is not feared,
however, that the absence of its restrain
ing influence will hay? any evil effecis, as
the dread of the iron hand of the Inter
state Commerce Commission has surliced
to restrain rate-cutting proclivities in the
great railroad centers of the East and will
be sufficient to maintain things in their
norma! condition in this City.

"Jhe Bath Coup"â What Is It?
How many whist-players can answer this
question, "What is :he meaning of the Bath
coup?" It is of so little importance in whist
that one would not want to spend mum time
in investigating it. Where it came from or
who introduced it we cannot say, but you will
find it in Drayson's "Art of Practical Whist,"
fifth edition, page 307, and it Is a sort of a
"catch" that is usually worked successfully on
green whist-players, and to give a description
of how the --coup" is mr.de it is well to quote
General Draysou's own words:
"A not uncommon error of young or inex
perienced players is, if leading irumps from
king, queen, knave and one or two others, and
the king or knave wins the trick, they will
lead a small trump. The fourth player may
hold ace, ten, and one or two others, and
practices what is technically known as 'the
Bath coup,' and refuses to win the first trick
with his ace, in hopes that a small trump may
be led by the original leader, when his ten is
sure to win the trick, a.'id his ace is still In
band.'
This same play is often made in plain suits,
but always made to catch the inexperienced.
All whist-players of the first rank when they
load knave from a suit of king, queen, knave
and two or more others, and it wins, will
always follow with king or queen to show
number, and get valuable iniorniation from
partner. The adversaries won't hold up ace the
second round, and the partner will not, unless
he has still another card in the suit.

In our little whigt circle the innovation that

that the more information you give your tÂ»art

a deal and hold four, five or even mx small
trumps and no suit worth trying to establish
you should lead tho lowest trump and have it
convey this information to your partner: "I
am strong in trumps" (that is, at least four,

Barbarian
Fashions.
The differences existing in modes of
dress, style of living and means of
subsistence in the civilized world has
been a subject of much comment, but
in those parts where the only semblance
of a covering for ihe body is obtained
from nature, consisting of a narrow girdle
about the loins, maao from the manilla
liber or cocoanut (grass or paper), the con
trast becomes exceedingly striking and a
subject of interest. It does not verify, by
any means, the poetical idea "that beauty
unadorned is adorned the most."
The Kanakas of the South Sea Islands,
especially those clustering about New
Guinea, deem themselves most ornate
when their bodies are tattooed â ihe more
hideous, the more beautiful. Oa account
of the darkness of their skin it is impossi
ble for them to make a display in the
ordinary acceptation of that art, but it is
wrought by means of introducing a knife
beneath tho skin, raising it from the body
so that it presents the appearance of a
wart. These tattoos are placed in dif
ferent parts of the body as & distinguish
ing characteristic or designation of the
various tribal islanders. In some these
are placed in rows on the upper part of
the arm or shouiders, others on the breast,
and still others down the back between
the shoulders. They vary in number
from three or more in line to a dozen, or
are placed in double rows.
Another idea of making themselves at
tractive is by means of piercing the lobe
of the ear and introducing into the open
ing a small stick or bone, increasing the
size of the aperture as nature heals the
wound until, in tome instances, the open
ing becomes several inches in extent, and
the outer portion of tbe ear hanging down
the side of the head has the appearance
of a small piece of indiarubber tubing
attached to the ear. This distension is
often utilized in carrying their pipes,
when not in use, by twisting it around
the stem and placing the bowl close to the
ear, which holds it securely while they
are at work or walking.
It is said "the glory of a woman is her
bair," but bow tbe male portion of the
wild Kanaka became so thoroughly im
bued with such an ideal characteristic is
very chimerical.
To one who has never seen the almost
hideous modes by which the hair is made
to display his idea of esthetics the aston
ishment experienced would be difficult to
depict. The hair is usually worn long and
parted in the middle, especially by the
chiefs, and it colored in various hues, Ironi
bright carmine 10 a ooft-tinted irolden hue
an d sometimes pure white, though the
age of the wearer might be less than a
score of years. This coloring is accom
plished by means of juice expressed from
certain nuts or berries in the first instance
and a liberal application of a thick solu
tion of limewater in the latter. The lime
is obtained from burning pieces of coral
or shell, which are abundantly found on
the islands. A distinguishing marie by
the Protestant native is designated in the
peculiar style of his wearing the hair
pompadour, tbe heathen disdaining to
adopt such a style.
Ornnments made from a flat shell, simi
lar in shape to our scallop, without cor
rugattOÃs, are wrought into various shapes
and sizes and fastened by the hair, either
to droop upon the forenead, stand eruct
about the front of the head or worn by a
piece of fiber about the neck, or attached
to hair upon the breast, the supremacy of
the sterner sex usurping the rieht of such
adornment. In one instance of decoration
tha "verbena," or female, stands in equal
ity with her mate, viz. : in the use of arm
lets. These are of multiform construction
us to shape and size, made from shell
tortoise-shell or bone, and are usually
worn upon the arm between the elbow and
the shoulder, varying in number from one
to i score. Tnese are placed upon the
native when quite young, and are held in
such esteem that even whan the pleasure
is ofttimes turned into severe pain by the
growth of the arm the flesh protruding on
either side above and below the armlets,
nothing will induce the wearers to Dart
with them, their idea being tho larger the
arm and smaller the armlst the more or
namentation.
Giving an appreciative description of
the prou'tque paraphernalia which in
cumber the natives when in full regalia
for their "sing sins;" or festive dances is
by no means an easy task, the festivities

Whist - Lectures by the Whist
Queen.
The Providence (R. I.) Telegram of March 28
gives an account of a whist lecture given by
Miss Kate Wheelock. It says:
The whlst-plarers of this city had a great even
ing at the Providence Athletic Club last night,
when Mhs KaiÂ»- Wlieelock spoke to an audience
that completely tilled the gymnasium. Although
Miss Wheeloclc is well known In this city this was
her initial appearance as a lecturer, but the recep
tion accorded her. was a sufficient Indication that
succeeding talk* . of the same kind will be very
welcome additions to the sources of Information of
tho whist-player*. ; â  "
President Barney of the National Association in
troduced Miss Wheeloclt. who then went Immedi
ately into the consideration of the subject. BhÂ«
took it up with the assumption that the audience
was composed mainly of beginners, but those who
knew tbe value of the cards and had some Knowl
edge of how to follow suit at least.
It was a very instructive introduction that was
given before the room wits darsened in ortfar that
sample hands might be shown by the use of the
stereopticon. 1 his lattT feature was a novelty
and one that told the story ' ! Â» better form than
could have been gained in Â»ny other way.
Tho proper leads from these specimen hands
were given and thÂ» faults that might occur were
pointed out. This tout considerable time, but the
two hours that were spent with Miss Wheeloclc
were over all too quickly. It was a talk that ap
pealed particularly to those who like to play whist
for recreation rather than to make it an exact
science, and as such Miss Wheelock's lectures
hereafter will be well received In all probability.
Duplicate Whist b*j Johrv T. JYlitchell.
We are glad to take Mr. Mitchell by the hand
and say : Well done, John T. You haTe Riven
us something we have been looking for for
many years. This new boot is called "Mitchell's
Duplicate Whist and Modern Leads." We can

being of such an entirely different nature
from anyttiing extant in American civili
zation.
On the head of some of the participants
is worn a mask which covers it com
pletely. This is made generally of an en
tire cocoanut, opened sufficiently for the
insertion of the head, orifices being cut for
the eyes, nose and mouth, though, some
times the eyes are partially hid by tbe
substitution of small stones known as
"cats-eyes," and bits of wood or bone for
teeth in the opening for the mouth. These
masUs weigh from two to five pounds, and
are hold in position by fastenings around
the neck. The long fiber is made to stand
erect upon the crown of the head, the
whole presenting the appearance of some
hideous heathen cod in all of its barbaric
conception. If no mask is worn the faces
are painted and the head dressed in col
ored plumage, somewhat like the repre
sentation of American Indians. The only
covering tor the body is the "lavalava"
about the loins.
The dance consists of movements for
ward, backward and sideways, the parties
forming in line "en inilitaire," but using
moat extreme contortions of the body,
continuing for hours in duration. The
"â ing sing" is conducted by a leader di
recting its various phases by beatings of
an outside member upon a "torn torn," or
drum, constructed by excavating a log, a
slit down tne upper side being made. The
desired depth of tone is obtained by the
introduction of water into the interior of
tne log, producing only one intonation,
which music (?) "hath charms to soothe
the savage breast." Women have no par
ticipation in the "Sing Sing."
However emphatically it may be urged
that civilization is beneficial to the hu
man race, one instance in Kanaka life
proves a most notable exception, for fre
quently when these nativa islanders are
induced to adopt the attire of the Euro
pean, nature, having been previously un
trammeled in this respect, declines the in
novation, and sometimes death follows
from sucn action, but always a deceneracy
of the physical system is the inevitable
result.
Those living on the seashore are almost

ablutions cause a scurfiness that ma
terially weakens their strength.
Another very detrimental habit common
to both se^es of these people is the dis
gusting use they make of chewing a nat
(called the beedie nut) dipped in lime
powder and sometimes taken with a cer
tain pungent cone, like the American
pine tree, only smaller. This custom de
stroys their teeth, which originally are

Second Ganadian Whist League
Congress.
The following letter from the honorable sec
retary of the Canadian Whist League to the
whist editor of The Call explains itself:
Toronto, Canada. March 26, 1897.
Whist Editor '\itl; The executive committee
has decided to bold the second annual congress
in Toronto on Friday and Saturday, April 16 and
17, 1897, at the Victoria Club, Huron street.
That only members of the Canadian Whist
League be allowed to compete.
That the team entrance fee to congress competi
tion t> â¢ aboliihed.
That the entries, which will close Monday, April
12, 1897, may be made In the name of a club, or
any four players may enter together, whether
members or the same club or not, provided they
enter under a club or other distinctive name, and
any club may enter more than one four.
The committee solicits your hearty co-operation
and trusts that this year's arrangements as to
length of competition and accommodation will be
everything that could be desired.
some complaint was made last year that the
teams were asked to play too many matches, so
this year the number of matches will be reduced,
thereby allowing considerable lime for "whist
talk."
The Victoria Club ban generously set aside the
entire capacity of Us handsome rooms (with the
leaving them and their mouths a terra
cotta color and full of disease.
The Kanaka subsists principally upon
fish and the bulb of a plant called "taro,"
strongly allied to the "calla." This grows
wild, but cultivation has so improved its
quality that it has even become a part in
trie menu of the white man. Nuts and
berries are highly esteemed, but sugar
cane, when it can be obtained, is consid
ered almost a luxury, little of it being
raised on these islands. The introduc
tion of rice as a fooi upon the plantations
forms another very essential article of
diet.
Little meat, except salted, is eaten by
the native, as there are no cattle or sheep
in range upon the land, all beine im
ported that are found there. Whenever
opportunity is afforded to the Kanaka to
avail himself oi a meal from the white
man's repast he is considered exceedingly
fortunate, as he highly appreciates the
difference of the cuisine.
In what manner beneficial influences
may beat be extended 10 these benighted
tribes is a pertinent and interesting sub
ject of solution for the political economist.
This cannot be evolved simply by legisla
tion or religious tract distribution emanat
ing from foreign shores, but the bene
factor mu<t become thoroughly conver
sant with their wild nature and cause
them to be imbued with confidence in his
good intention, on account of advantages
that they may receive by mutuallnter
course, and not because of any gain being
derived from them, this pernicious feature
having already been too severely experi
enced by them.

AnsWers to Whist Queries.
A correspondent in Sunol asks the follow
ing questions:
1. Has the American Whist League formu
lated a system of play?
2. What is Hosier's standing in the league,
and can you suggest a better handbook?
3. Wbnt is the rotary discard?
4. Will you kindly send a description of
solitaire whist?
In answer to tne above questions we will
say, first, the league has not and will not for
mulate any system before the next congress,
to bo held in Put-in- Bay July 6 to 10, if it does
then.
2. Mr. Foster is one of the beEt â whist
writers in this country, but so far as we are
able to judge he advocates no system of play
except to go contrary to the recognized whist
principles. He has written several books,
and no whist student should go without
them.
Wo have about 200 different books on the
game and they are all good.
To the third questionâ What is the rotary
discard?
This is an innovation of our own. We gave
a description ot it in The Call.
It was first explained in ''Whist" of Janu
ary, 1895. In Mitchell's new book, "Dupli
cate Whist and Modern Leads," you will find
on page 104 a full description of it.
Lastly, we are asked for a full description of
the game of "solitaire whist."
This game is not quite perfected, and as
soon as it is it will appear simultaneously in
all the whist papers in the country.
Another writer asks us why we advise the
lead of ace from ace king and two small in Thk
Call's Whist Donts, and in deciding a ques
tion of what to lead from a certain hand we
say king from the same holding. Ojranswer is:
In deciding questions of correct whist play,
more especially the proper leads, the great
majority of whist-players consider the Amer
can leads introduced by Nicholas Browse
Trist the standard. We bow to what we con
sider superi Â»r authority. The new leads we ad
vocate in Whist Donts are more informatory
than any system in use to-day and we would
like the trial of them in connection with the
rotary discard.

close a public road that runs through his land.
If there is reason why the road should ds

The Horseâ J. S., City. The horse, accord
ing to a number of writers, is possessed of both
Instinct and intelligence. He has the instinct
of self-preservation and intelligence or sa
gacity, as is manifested by his ability to learn
and to remember what he is taught. As an
Instance of sagacity Romanes, in "Animal
Intelligence." narrates a number of instances,
such as the case of a Shetland pony going to
be shod oc his own accord alter dropping a.
shoe; of a Canadian horse having a woman
irom drowning by holding her gown in his

, is g ranted a divorce ana is allowed her maiden
i name the decree reads: "Aud that the plain*
: tiff in this action be permitted to resume her
| maiden name, which was," aud then follows
i what that maiiien name was, say for instance,
j ''Alice Jones," not "Miss," Alice Jones. There
is no rule that authorizes a divorced woman
to assume either â¢â¢Miss" or "Mrs." when al
lowed to resume her maiden name. She can
j not by any right assume the title of "Miss,"
for that is a term applied to a young girl or to
I an aged girl who hes never been married;
and being no longer married, she cannot call
nerseif "Mrs." Consequently she is neither
'â¢Miss" nor -'Mrs." and has strictly no nght
to use either prefix. If a woman on being
divorced U allowed to resume hÂ»-r maiden
name, which was, say. ''Alice Jones," shecouui
not be introduced as "Mrs. Alice Jones" or
"Miss Alice Jones," but it would be proper to
introduce her as "A'.ico Jones."
Pockkt Vetoâ Schoolboy, Aberdeen, Inyo
County, Cal. A veto is the act by which the
executive refuses his concurrence in a mea
sure of the legislative body- with which he is
associated and thus prevents it from becom
ing a law. The power of veto is generally
! given to Mayors of cities and to Governor; of
States, the latter sometimes acting in con
junction with other officials. The veto may
be overridden by a vote of the legi*lÂ«t.ve
body, in most of the States a two-thinis vote
j being necessary for that purpose, while in
i others & three-fifths vote or even a simple
I majority is sufficient. Rhode Island, North
Carolina, Ohio and Delaware are the only
States that have refused to give the executive
the Dower to veto.
The right to veto acts of Congress invested
by article I, section 7. 01 the constitution in
the President alone. He is required to ngn,
every bill or return it to the House of Congress
in which it originated, with his obj.-ctions.
The latter act constitutes a veto, ana if two
thirds of each house pass the bill again it be
comes a law notwithstanding the veto. If the
President tails to return the bill within ten
days (Sundays cxeepted) it becomes a law as if
he signed it unless '-Congress by their ad
journment prevents its return, in which case I
it shall not be a law." if, mereiore, Congress'
r.djourns within ten days i fter the passage of
a oil. nu;l the President has refrained from act
ing on tl:e bill it docs not become a law; the dis
j posal o[ a bill m tiiat way, when the' President
does not choose to veto it lormally. is termed a
'â¢pocket veto," a term which it seems was first'
applied by the Whigs to '.he disposition in that
manner of two internal improvement bills by
President Andrew Jacltson.FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES

and that is ail. Not a bow, not n ?crat> of
b ny thing else; about $10, but at mon $12,
would amply pay for the wrk and mate
rials, but then the style! Yes, I confess,

soribable curves here and there, etc., com
manded this goodly price.
Wanamaker has secured for his milli
nery department quite a genius, if reports
sre Ut be relied on, for at the opening,
two weeks ago, the women quite raved
over a creation ior evening weur of shirred
wliite chiffon. At one side and on top
are pint rose and four white ostrich tips,
held in position by a large and handsome
rtainestone ornament. At the same open
ing was noted a combination hat collarette
and parasol to match in a goranium red.
This set came from Paris, and the mate
rial used is a spangled m t inc.
For a dame wit!: quiet taste has been
made a pretty bonnet. It has a truncated
pyramd for a crown, and the slope down
lrom the side forms a close-fitting bonnet.
The whole is made of alternate rows of
tiny, narrow cream lace and jet beads
strung in rows. The left side was orna
mented by puffs of cbiffon with black
aigrettes, and the right side with black
violets. The bonnet strings were of ruoire
ribbon and quite narrow. The wrap to be
worn with this has not the virtue of being
warm, but simply dressy. It is shaped
like a mantle, with three rows of rive-inch
wide ribbon over tbe shoulders, each edÂ«ed
with six rows of narrow chiffon plaited.
These are placed on a pointed yoke of
over-beaded design. The wide ribbons
are merged into one at the front waist
line, and the two, with chiffon edging,
carry the mantle around to the back, end
ing in a huge bow of striking effect.
The new straws Ibis season must please
i-ven the most fastidious, for every qual
ity, color and weave may be had. Sailor
hats are to be worn as much as ever and
they have changed as much in appearance
during the last few years as have our
tailor gowns, for they are now to be bad
beautifully ornamented witti flowers. One
I like has its crown surrounded with the
best, of oeep purple violets and their
ieaveu. At the le ts de rises some foliage
iibove.the flowers. Next to the hair are
Knots of green ribbon. The smartly
turned out New York girls are wearing
[sailor bats in blue, broffn and black,
made with white straw linings. Around the
crown is tied a white velvet ribbon that
terminates in a smart bow exactly in the
middle of the front, at the left tide are
two quills and two long ends of the white
velvet.
For a schoolgirl I saw a sailor o! biscuit
colored straw, around the crown of wnich
is tied a velvet ribbon, exactly the shade
of the darkest and richest wall-flowers,
and at the left side thest* flower?, quite a
bunch of them, nre placed. Yet another
for an oliler maiden, of black straw, has
rows of violets bunche 1 near the top of
the crown, and underneath, resting on
the hair, rosettes of violet riLbon nestle
among the flowers. Kqually good is one
of dark red straw, made effective hy
means of black tulle gathered and shirred
about the crown, and shaded geraniums
form a wreath around the crown.
Slippers and Sfyoes.
An Plaster bride, whoie t;ousseau will
cause much comment, has very beauti
: fully shaped fe?t, on which No. 1 shoes
i are worn with perfect comfort, so it is not
1 to be wondered at that her slippers and
Â«lioes have been ordered with much care,
and more than one pair of dear little
high-heeled slippers are worthy of admira
j tion. They have a strap over the instep
and are like those worn by sage dancers,
I our belles having discovered that this
style of slipper is becoming to most feet
It is known as the "gypsy." The pair to
which 1 alluae are of white satin, exqui
sitely embroidered with diamonds and
silver. However, snch slippers are also
being made very successfully of white kid
with a black beading, the rage for black
and white affecting even our footgear.
Indeed, there is no restriction, as far as
cokr is concerned, for evening wear, but
the kid must be of the very softest and
best quality, so as to properly outline the
foot. The toes of slippers ara more elabor
ately embroidered than they have been
for several years, yellow and black beads
frequently being used on black satin, just
as pearls, diamonds and gold and silver
threads are employed on white, blue and
p:nfc satin, and not a tew clever maidens
nowadays embroider their own slipper
toes. The cost is trifling and the results
most satisfactory in the larger number of
cases.
I have just heard of a pair of red leather
slippers made with an edging of per
forated white kid around the top. A single
rhinestone button is used instead ofj a
buckle. At a fancy-dress ball last winter
a dazzling effect was produced by wear
ing blue slippers ornamented with told
;ind strass. Garnets are quite extensively
used, as well as many costly jewels, by
smart New Yoik girls, who thins but lit
tle of losing one or more diamonds at a
cotillon.
To return to my little bride. Many of
her Â»hoes show a tendency to return to the
style* of the Tudor and Stuart times.
They look extremely uncomfortable, sev
eral having the highost heels imaginable
and covered with scarlet kid in striking
contrast to tb.9 coloring of the rest of the
shoes, which are made of glove kid. A few
have their toes exquisitely painted by
hand, such having been the vogue at
court during the time of King Edward
111. Buctles of genuine cut silver rarely
wrought complete them.
What do yon think of a pair composed
of silver brocade? Tuef have gold buckles
and the most lofty i n heels; in styie they
are a la Charles IX, aud besides these

THE ART OF BEING BEAUTIFUL.
Beauty is cultivated â seldom the gift of nature. Nature, in fur-
nishing the mould of beauty, not infrequently mars her best efforts
with unsightly hairs, moles, etc.
What can 1 do to become more beautiful? Does this question
interest you, ladies? Then lend me your earsâ figuratively, of
course. Remove those unsightly and humiliating hairs, moles, warts
and other blemishes from your face. Can this be done permanently,
so when once removed they will never return? Certainly it can,
providing you pursue the right course. How? Have them removed
with the electric needle. Where shall I go? To some reputable phy-
sicians who devote their entire practice to this work, and do it with-
out causing pain or leaving scars. Where can I find such operators?
At the Philadelphia Electrolysis Company, in the St. Ann's Building,
junction of Market, Powell and Eddy Streets, opposite The Baldwin.

P. S.â We respectfully court an acquaintance with all those who

are others in sky blue and red brocade;
but the handsomest in this uiiusually ex
tensive collection are of the richest white
and gold ' brocade, in which glisten gold
buctles incrusted with glittering gems,
the heels being over three inches high.
Really absurd as such heels are, not only
being positively dangerous, but also the
cause of severe back and head aches, you
may tell me that "one must suffer to be
beautiful." but question is are such ex
accei at.o is beautiful?
I have been reading about a fair
Duchess who has ordered a pair of white
satin slippers, which are to be ornamented
v.ith Jurqueminot roses in velvet brocade
on the toe and heel, the roses being inter
twined with embroidered wreaths of
smtlax.
A Marquise owns a gorgeous pair of
shoes evolved from green brocade en
riched with silver embroidery. A pair of
her slippers are oi yellow brocade bor
dered with the narrowest possible ruche
of jeweled chiffon. The heels are five
and a halt inches hieh. The bases of the
heels have silver and ~ilt tips.

The Stationary .Engineer*.
Last Thursday evening Social Hall, in the
Foresters' building, was crowded as it never
was before by an audience thnt assembled to
listen to an entertainment offered by San
Francisco No. 1 of the National Association of
Stationary Engineers, a body of men united
for the purpose of educating and enlightening
tne engineer and to relieve him in sickness
nnd nistress. The principsil feature of the en
tertainment wus an illustrated lecture en
titled 'A Tr p From San Francisco to London,"
by P. L. Knnor, whose description was most
entertaining.
The lecture was illustrated by many beauti
ful views thrown on the screen by Professor
Siults, who used the acetylin gas. with the
result that the pictures appeared with great
distinctness. A number of patriotic pictures
were thrown in by way of divenisement and
these were received with wild applause. The
monotony of the journey was enlivened by
vocal and instrumental solos by the following

A farmer about 48 years of age, living at Downs, Oklahoma
Territory, says of
" I used to be troubled with dyspepsia a great deal, but since
last April I have not known what it feels like. I would have
sour stomach and belch up anything the least bit greasy as
sure as I ate it. I saw RipaHs Tabules advertised in a St. Louis
paper and decided to try them, so when I went to Guthrie I
found some of them and have never been without them since. I
used to drink liquor, but have no desire for it now. I can eat ham
and beans, or cabbage boiled with fat meat â in fact, I can digest
anything I eat without any trouble whatever. I have always
lived on a farm and have done many a hard day's work when I
was sick enough to be in bed â all on accountof indigestion."

: Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man : is. slowly wasting away with- nervous
weakness the -mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up â to ; the mental' suffering â  day or
night.' Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
! what they do. For years the writer rolled and
| tossed on the troubled sen of sexual weakness
i until it ' was a : question whether he had not
. better take a dose ot poison ' and thus end all
j his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
' the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this .wonderful treatment
free. : Now,' when I say free I mean absolutely,
without cost, because I -want; every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. .
lam not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering v the mental - tortureÃ of. weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could
they but get such a remedy . as the ; one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
'afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time of happiness to most of us. Write to
Thomas Slater, box 2283, Kalamaioo, Mich.,
and the information will be mailed in a plain

TO PROPAGATE
THE NORSE TONGUE
Petition for a Chair of the
Language at the Uni
versity.
It Is Indorsed by President Jor
dan of Stanford and Otber
Prominent Men.
Some Reasons Why It Is Particu'arly
Desired That thi Literature
B: Preserved.
A petition is in circulation adrlre^ed :<>
the University of California, haying htea
issued by the Pacific Skandinav, a Danish-
Norwegian paper, and the Vestkusien, a
Swedish weekly newspaper of ban Fran
cisco.
The petition is for the establishment of
a chair at the university in "Norse Lan
guage and Literature." It is a strong
document, prc-entiti? its own reasons for
its ei'tter.ce, as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Regent* of the
Slate Vnivrrfitu- Gentlemen: The subscribers
to this petition, appreciating t.ie particular
advantage to all who ueloufc to the Anglo-
Saxon race on th s coa<st, which tin.- granting
of it would afford, respectfully submit the 10l- |
lowing for your kmiiy consideration:
Whereas the mythology, ancient history, i
lancuage and literature of the south ot i
Europe â Greece and Romeâ have become an i
essential part of a liberal education at all
universities and schools of learning, even in
t is country, yet nothing has practically been
done in this vast dominion of the Anglo-
Saxon race for imparting a proper knowledge
of the more consanguine, to us far more essen
tial and in no wise less stirring and unique
mythology, ancient history, language and
literature oi the north of Europe â the so-called
"Old Norse" â from which not alone the Scan
dinavians, as direct descendants, but all J
English-speaking people of the Anglo-Saxon
race draw all ol their mythological legends,
most of the roots of their present language
and part of their early history.
The "Norse Tongue" has preserved its char
acteristics more intect than that of any other
nations, perhaps owing to the isolated posi
tion oi the north, which, together with the
warlike spirit of its people, saved it irom for
eign dominion and influence.
The prehistoric literature which exists in
runic legends ("Sagas") possesses a peculiar
vigor, v.- [rich has put its stamp on and mate- I
rially influenced even the literature of the j
Scandinavians of the present day.
Yet all those stirring memories of old Vik
ing times, which have had such marked influ- j
ence on the culture of the north, are nearly :
unknown to even otherwise well-educated
Americans, who only now and then get a
glimpse th rough a stray translation of borne
modern author.
Calnornia has in Its short existence as a â 
member of our great common race always |
kept abreast in education and civilization. It |
might now add new laurels to Its record by '
adopting this interesting lore, which hÂ«s beeu j
so curiously neglected by the older members. \
As another consideration might be mentioned
That the Scaudinav.an 1 opulaiion of Califor
nia is numerically strong, a;id although the
people from the north ever with pardonable
pride remember the glorious past' of the
mother country, still they fast become good
citizens of the new and thorough Americans.
Based on the above arguments the subscrib
ers now petition your honorable body to ec i
large tne scope of education of tne university
by the establishment of a chair lor the teach- j
in? of old Norse language aud literature am. i
lectures on modern Scandinavian literature.
Trie petition has been extensively signed I
by a large number of prominent men. rep- !
resenting various influential bodies.
Among other indorsers of the movement
are President David B. Jordan of the Palo
Alto University and Edward S. Holden of
the Lick Observatory. Professor Jordan
Bays:
Office of the President )
Lf.i.and Stanford Junior University, >
Paio Alto, CaL )
Editor Pacific Skandinav: I am in the fullest
sympathy with your efforts to establish' in our
Hate University a chair of Instruction in the j
Norse language and literature. Such a chair '
â would place in the hands ot our scholars,
through one of the noblest of languages, the
key to the highest enjoyment of the work of
some of the ablest writers of our time. The
Norse language is poetry in iiseif. It becomes
doubly so in the hanus of masters such as
Bjornson, Ibsen, Wergeiand and l<ie.
Professor Holrien Is equally in sympathy
â with the project, saying: "The genius of
the Encli^li, and thus of the American
people, is derived in a thousand ways from
their early conquerors. To study their
life and their noole literature ik to exam
ine the roots of our own development.
The Eddas are our heritage also."

natures may be found at the following
addresses: tain A. C. Preese, Public
Administrator, Chronicle building; Henry
Lund, Swedish - Norwegian Consul, 21*4

TECHNICALITIES AVAIL NOT.
The fnpri-me Court K:ifinps to Interfere
in the Case of \t . AÂ» Sehorn*
The Supreme Court yesterday arlirmed
the judgment and order oi the Superior
Court of Glenn County in the case of W.
A. Sehorn, who was charged witn murder
and convicted of manslaughter. He
wanted anew trial and appealed from ihe
order denying his request. In October,
1895, Sehorn published an article in his
paner under the heading of "Bulldozer.''
reflecting upon John E. Putnam. The
two met and Putnam was kiiled by Se
horn.
In his petition to the Supreme Court bis
brief was devoted to technical uoints, in
which be assailed thÂ» proceedings of the
committing matri9trale. The Supreir.e
Court could not find anything to warrant
interfering with the rulings of the lower
court.
Fell Into the Hold.
James Mh honey, a sailor ou the steamer
Willamette, fell into the hold yesterday worn
ing, a distance of about twenty feet. He struck
on a pile of coal ana was rendered uncon
scious. He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
where it waa found that there were two lace
rated wounds on his scal|>, his back was con
tused and he had sustained internal injuries.

PASSING OF THE
TERESA TERRY
She Had an Exciting Time
of It Here in the
Early Days.
Only Once in This Port but
Captain J. M. Shotwell Re
members the Visit
The Bark Had to B? Revictuled and
Remannei in 24 Hours, but
th? J?b Was Done.
The old-time clipper Teresa Terry is no
more. Tup steamer Newport brought the
news from Panama that the o:ice-iamons
liner had been broken up in one of the
Central American ports, after having
served for years as a hulk. At one time
the handsome bark was the pride of the
American mercantile marine, and that
was in the days when the stars and stripes
were seen in every port of the world. She
was built of heart of oak and withstood
the ravages of time for nearly sixty years,
and then her remains were taken to the
boneyard.
After serving for some years as an At
lantic clipper the Teresa Terry was sold
to outsiders and was put under the Peru
vian flag. Coolie lHbor wa< mucti In de
mand in that country at that time, and
t lie bark wa* sent to China on a "black
uirding'' expedition, bhe took aboard a
load of nearly 250 Chinese and started for
Lima. On the way her condenser broke
down ana she bad to put inio San Fran
cisco in distress, and came to an anchor
off old isausalito. The rest of the story is
bpst told by Captain J. M. Shotwell of the
Merchants Exchange.
"The only time the Teresa Terry was
here was in tne early '50*8," said he, after
hearing about the breaking up of the old
clipper. "I ought to remember the cir
cumstances, as it was one of the must ex
citing incidents in my life. It was blow
ing a gale at the time, and as the vessel
was consigned to us J had to go out to
her. It was the worst half- hour I ever
spent on the bay, and when 1 got aboard
the bark it was evea worse. The Bailors
were deserting one by one and the Chi
nese were clamoring to be put ashore.
The captain couldn't do anything and his
mm laughea at him. I took in the situa
tion at a glance and ordered the Chinese
below ana battened the hatches down.
Then I started back for the City.
'When I told the agents how matters
stood they said, 'The Chinese merchants
are getting out writs of habeas corpus for
all the coolies aboard, and should they
succeed the owners of the vessel will be
ruined. You must eet ger. that vessel to
sea acain before dayoreak or else there
will be the devil to pay.'
"I hurried away to Captain Charles
Goodall, who owned the only tug in the
bay at that time, and told him our pre
dicament. Hia tuc had her smokestack
down and was Deing overhauled. As rirst
he said it was impossible to do anything,
but wben I told him it was a question of
sparing no expense, he got an extra gang
of n.cr. and by nightfall had the tug ready
for Â«ea again.
"Then I went and saw Bill Xye, the

new crew for me on time and Nye prom
ised to see to it that the water-casks were
procured and filled before .i a. m. He kept
his word, but. oh I what a drenchinc those
Chinese did get every time the nosepipe
worked its way out of the bunghoie.
Baksr got his men aboard and at day
break we were under way and heading fur
sea in a howling southeaster. One lurch
of the bark gave me a horrible fall
which I can feel even yet. \Ve got
the Teresa Terry to sea, however, and I
handed her over* to the captain, who had

escape arrest should any revenue officer
come along.
"The lunny part of the whole strange
affair orcurred the next day. I was sit
ting in the Custom-house talking to Dep
uty Collector Walton, father of the pres
ent purser of the Mariposa, when who
should come iv but the lieutenant of the
revenue cutter. He told a harrowing story
i of how he had beat his way in the cutter
over to Sausalito in order to board the
Teresa Terry, When he reached the gang
way twenty men armed with cutla ses
barred his way and forcpd him bact into
his boat. His men made a gallant at
tempt to get aboard, but failed, and he
HALT2 BROS
was compelled to put back to the revenue
cutter. 'In the morning,' said he, 'the
bark was gone.' The Terry got safely to
Peru and landed her cargo, but I never
heard of her again until yesterday, when
the news came that she had been turned
into a coal hulk."
The oriemal of the phrase "on tick, "
meaning credit, was "on ticKet," the idea
being that articles bought and not paid
for at the time had to be noted on a
ticket.

Shanties on Jackson Street Falling
Away With Age and
Weather.
During the recent *pasm of modern im
provements which had seized tuo mem
bers of the Boaid of Health to rid the
City of the dangerous and unsightly old
shanties which are dotted about in the
older sections several dilapidated old rook
eries were pulled down, principally in the
Chinese quarters. Yet some of the con
demned rookeries escaped the devastat
ing raid of the stalwart attaches of the
Health Department.
Among those dangerous shanties con
demned and ordered to be Dulled down is an
entire row of old corrugated iron shanties
on the north side of Jackson street, be
tween Sansome and Battery, opposite the
Postoffice.
Those old rookeries were erected âor
rather bolted together â in the fall of '49
and there have remained ever since, a
habitation and rendezvous for water-front
rats and a propagation ground for mos
quitoes and spiders.
The entire lront on which these corru
gated iron sheds stand is owned by James
de la Alomanva and Thomas Ambrose,
both of whom are wealthy-
Notice had been served upon those two
property-owners that the sheds were con
demned by the Health Department of
this City and would be torn down inside
of a specified time unless removed by
their owners. This was over six months
ago, but yet the rookeries are still there,
owing ro an extension of time granted by
the health officers.
This limit of indulgence will expire on
the Ist of next month, and it then re
mains to be seen wnat further action will
be taken by the authorities in the matter
of tearing down the shanties.
A simibir dilatory course has been fol
lowed wiih regard io the cluster of rook^
cries on the core end of Montgomery ave
nue and Kearn.v street, in front of which
Dr. Cogswell pinced a bronze statue of
Benjamin FraTiKiin. some years ago. The
}iruperty on which those decayed shanties
stand is owned by the heirs of Matthew
Crooks and Dr. H. D. Cogswell.
As a reason for not pu;ling down those
objectionable buildings before this the
llea>th Department claim that the requi
site notice had not been served on CoÂ«:s
--\\e!i, but when this is done theshantles
wiil come oown in a tumble without fur
ther ceremony.
