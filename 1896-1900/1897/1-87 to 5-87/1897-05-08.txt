TO EVACUATE
CRETE ISLAND
Greece Prefers to Fight It
Out Rather Than Be I
Humbled.
POWERS GLORY IN THE DEFEAT
OF HELLENES.
Secure in the Protection of the
European "Concert," the Turks Are
Committing Shocking Mas
sacres in Epirus.
LONDON, Exg., May 7.â The Athens
correspondent ot tne Daily News describes
the situation as critical, owing to the ati-
vance of the enemy and delay of the
powers in intervening. Rumors persist
that a crisis in the Ministry is impending,
owing to the divergence between it and
the King. The Cabinet advocates an en
ergetic continuance of the struggle, while
the King desires to avoid further blood
shed.
The correspondent adds that a diplo
matist informed him to-day that nothing
had been agreed upon by the powers,
although intervention is in the air. The
member of another legation said Greece
must be thoroughly humbled in the dust
to teach her not to meddle in Eastern
affairs again. His Government, he added,
would view with equanimity a Turkish
advance on Athens.
The German Minister the other day
ostentatiously v:sited a few wounded
Turkish prisoners in Athens. He has not
even sent a porter to see hundreds of
wounded Greeks in the hospitals. It :s
certain the powers art undoubtedly ex
ulting at the Greek discomfiture, says the
correspondent.
The critical point at the situation is
reached, and it is now time to negotiate
peace, is the attitude of the Sultan. The
best authority on this matter is the
Speaker's Constantinople correspondent,
who in to-morrow's issue says:
"He (the Sultan) has done his work
thoroughly. He wai never so strong as
to-day. Now his policy will be magnani
mous. It has been said that pride of suc
cess would make him insufferable to the
powers. I don't believe it. Their meek
ness and long suffering are inexhaust
able, and he's too wary to trespass
upon them when there is nothing to
gain. He has already intimated his de
sire 10 end the war. Having vindicated
: his honer and destroyed the prestige of
Greece, he says he is distressed by the
was c of life and property, and asks,
'Why not restore the status quo ante bel
lum?' He says he knows this to be the
result of the war, however long it may
last, and so he is ready for peace imme
diately. The Sultan would not have de
clared war if he bad not been pushed by
Germany and the military party here.
He would have accomplished his ends in
another way, but he is merciless in war
against individuals.
"The prisons are filled with Greeks now

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
as they were with Armenians a year ago.
Incalculable misery must result from the
expulsion of a quarter of a million of
Hellenic subjects, as well as ruin to what
is left of the commerce of the country.
Only one contingency may bring the Sul
tan in conflict with Europe. He may find
the military party too strong. This party
is opposed to giving back Thessaly to
Greece. It is believed here, even by some
of those in diplomatic circles, if the Sul
tan insists upon holding Thessaly no
European power will go to war to turn
him out by force, especially if there be a
revolution in Greece."
MASSACRE IN EPIRUS.
Fearful Outrages Said to Have Been
Committed by the Ottoman
Troops.
LONDON, Â£ng.. May 7.â The corre
spondent of the Times at VeJe3tino sum
ming up the result of the recent fighting
says: '"The Turks seem to have driven
hick the GreeJcs along the line extending
from Pharsala eastward to Alvaii and
turned the flank of the Velestino division
at Cynos; ehaiae, dividing the Greeks into
two masses which retreated to Dhomoko
and Almyro. They will probably rejoin
at MustaphaÃey pass, where the next big
battle should be fought, tboujrh I am semi
officially iniormed a stand will be made at
Dhomoko. The Ta r ks have reached the
outskirts of Volo, which at noon today
it was rumored had alieady fallen. Tnis
report is not confirmed. Anyhow its cap
ture is only a matter of hours, the de
fenses landward being very feeble.
The Times' Athens dispatch says General
Smoien3ki's gallant defense of Velestinois
counteracted by the irritation caused by
abandoning Pharsaios, and is regarded as
wiping out the disgrace of Mati and
Larissa. The corresponaentdeclares that,
contrary to other reports, under the influ
ence of recent defeats the bellicose enthu
siasm of the Greeks has vanished, and the
desire for peace is general. A part of the
brigade of General Smolensk! went by rail
to Volo, where it toofc ship for Almyro.
The Chronicle's Athens dispatch says
Colonel Manos telegraphs from Arta that
the Turks have begun a wholesale massa
cre in the interior of Epirus. All the in
habitants of the village of Kamarina nave
been murdered, with the exception of a
very few who escaped to the mountains.
Women are arriving in Arta from other
places praying for protection, their hus
bands and children having been mur
dered by enraged troops.
Many refugees are mad and unable to
ypeak, while others relate unwritable
horrors. The dispatch adds trie Greek
SAX FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNIXG, MAY 8, 1897.
VIEW OF DHOMOKO AND ITS FORTRESS, to Which Prince Constantine's Army Has Retired.
Dhomoko lies about fifteen miles south of Pharsala, in the gap between tiie Khassidiari Mountains on the east and the Paleomonastiro Kange on the west, belong
ing to the great Orthrys Ranee, whose cre-l is nine miles fanber south. Three roads leading south :rom the Thessalian plains unite here, ana joining tne main road
just west of the fortress continue as one over the Orthrys. A strung fortress on the summit of the ridge to the west of the town commands it and all the roads Irom either
direction. The point of view is from a hill to the northwest of the town, near the road to Pharsala. To the left is the Episkopi, or Bishop's house, and the principal
church. A little larther to the west are remains of an old wall and buildings antedating the Roman occupation, second century B. C. Dhomoko wa3 formerly called
Thaumakoi, or Wonder City, from its beautiful situation.
losses at Velestino Thursday are esti
mated to have been 300.
The Morning Post's Larissa dispatch
says the last entrenchments at Velestino
were captured last night and the Turks
are advancing on Volo.
IN PERILOUS POSITION.
Members of the Royal Family In
sulted When They Appear
on the Street.
LONDON, Ess., May ".â The Daily
Mail's Rome corr spondent says private
dispatches from Athens which escaped
the Greek censor give the true details of
the situation in the Greek capral. These
dispatches show the position of the royal
family since the retreat of the Greek army
from Pharsala has become more perilous
than ever. Members of the family rarely
leave the palace, and their portraits have
been withdrawn from all public places.
The Q'leen and Princess are insulted in
the streets when they visit the hospitals.
The palace is watched by revolutionary
agents lejt the family attempt to flee.
The writer ascribes the decision of the
powers to intervene to the dangerous po
sition in whicn the Greek reigning family
is placed.
The Telegraph's Athena correspondent
says be is authorized to state the Cabinet
will not consent under any circumstances
to the evacuation of Crete, or accept arbitra
tion without previous knowledge of the
tsrnis. The correspondent adds that in
any movement toward agreeing to with
draw all the Greuk troops from Crete or
accept the powers as arbitrators of the
war, without knowing what conditions
they will impose as ihe price of peace, the
Ministers could not keep office a day.
The result would be a revolution. The
correspondent learns all the powers are
willing to intervene without preliminary
conditions except Germany, which de
mands the evacuation of Crete first.
GREEK SHIPS BOMBARD.
But the Shells Seem to Have Had
No Effect on the Turkish
Camps at Cassandra.
ATHENS, Greece, May 7.â The Greek
fleet bombarded the Turkish camps at
Cassandra on the peninsula of that name
at the entrance to the Gulf of Salonica
yesterday, but the shells from the war
ships had no effect. The fleet made no
attempt to land men. The Government
has notified the diplomatists that the
Greek naval squadrons are blockading ef
fectively the Gulf of Salonica and the
coast of Epirus.
The British. French and Italian Consuls
at Vo!o have requested their Governments
to instruct warships of those nations now
at Volo to land men to protect the town.
It is stated positively that if the powers
insist on the evacuation of Crete as a con
dition of mediation Greece will reply she
prefers a war of extermination.
A dispatch from Canea says that yester
day Colonel Vassos, commanding the
Greek troops In Crete, made a request oi
the foreign admirals that the blockade be
relaxed sufficiently to enable him to em
bark his troops safely â in other words that
an opening be provided lor their exit.
The request was refused by the admirals,
who would only allow Vaaeos to purchase
food for the men.
FAREWELL DINNER TO BAYARD.
The Ex-Embasacdor to St. James Makes
a Sort ot Apoiogy lor His
Official Conduct.
LONDON. Eng., May 7.â Three hun
dred and fifty guests attended the farewell
dinner give to ex-Em bassador Bayard to
niuht in the great hall of the Ho. el Cecil,
under the auspices of the American So
ciety. Riuht Rtv. Mandell Creigliton,
Bishop of London, gracefully toasted iic-
Kinlsy. Chairman Crane toasted Bayard,
and presented to him a gold loving cup,
in the shape of a pumpkin, supported by
four silver eagles, surmounted by a bust
of Bayard and flanked by figures repre
senting Columbia and Britannia.
Bayard made a long, rambling response,
which was the most pro-American speech
he hfsevtr made in England. Without
its being an actual apology for his con
duct curing his term of office, he made
allusions in such a manner that it ap
peared to be an apology. He recalled the
Venezuelan affair, saying that he had the
courage to tell the truth, because there
was no just cause for a quarrel between
England and America, adding: ''I tried
to stand here for the honor and in the in
terest of my own country first."
Barm Russall of Killoween, Lord Chief
Justice of England, toasted Â£mbassador
Hay, who responded in a stilted, formal
speech, strictly confined to personal praise
01 Bayard.
The speech-making was interspersed
with music and singing. Bayard and nis
family sail for New York to-raorrow.
BORROWING MONEY
TO PAY SOLDIERS
Spain Carrying On the
Cuban War Under
Difficulties.
Another Big Loan That May
Wreck the Government's
Chief Prop.
In Spain the I nd lunation Against
Weyier for His Lying Reports
Is Increasing.
HAVANA, Opa May 7.â The Spanish
Government wili oorrow $1/0,000,000 from
the Bank of Spain in order to continue the
payment of Spanish troops in Cuba. For
a third time in less than six months for
eign bankers have refused to lend that
amount to Spain. The financial agents of
Castellanos, Minister of the Colonies, had
written him from Paris and London that
it was useless to depend on credit abroad
any longer, as foreign markets will be
closed to Spain until the war in Cuba is
over, and that no kind of Spanish security
would satisfy money-lenders. The $<>0,
--000.000 which tbe Bank of Spain will give
is the bank's paper. The bank by special
permission from the Government will in
crease its issue, as it did in all previous
cases, although the loan of this class made
in March caused a general protest in finan
cial circles. Tne general opinion is that
the bank will be driven by the Govern
ment to bankruptcy.
Madrid dispatcties say great indigna
tion prevails against Weyler principally
among Liberals and Conservatives of the
group led by Don Francisco Silvela. They
openly declare that Weyler has deceived
Canovas with a view to retaining the office
of captain-genera!. Silvela has said that
this state of affairs is proof of the decad
ance of Senor Canovas, adding, "The man
who ten years ago had so strong mental
powers is now made a fool of."
Silvela also considers Wejler's falsehood
in reporting pacifications which do not
exist has brought it to the pass where no
self-respecting general would like to re
place Weyler, taking on his shoulders the
responsibility of continuing a war which
his predecessor had declared ended. Wey
ler would always say he left the island
pacified and the war was renewed after
his (it par uru.
Santos Quseman, representing the un
compromising Spaniards of Havana, has
declared, after long conference with
Canovas, that he could not give his ap
proval of introduction of reforms now.
Marquis of Vega de Armijo, an influential
Liberal and ex-Minister, snys it is neces
sary to offer strong opposition to the Gov
ernment on the Cuban question. Finally
Bagasta, chief of the Liberal party, de
clares that reforms, if offered at all, must
be offered sincerely. To deceive the
Cubans, he said, will do untold harm.
The war is Â£Oing on here with an average
of sixty engagements a day in all the six
provinces. An expedition for the Cubans
has lauded in the province of Havana.

Electric-Car Track.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 7.â Shortly before
midnight last night four footpads held up
Thomas Brady, a landscape gardener, on
the outskirts of the city, robbed him, re
moved bis shoes and hat, battered his bead
with sandbags, laid him across the subur
ban railway tracks, between Garubell place
and Etezeli avenue, and left him to be
around beneath the wheels of an electric
car.
As tbo unconscious man lay on the
tract with one of the footpads bending
over him arranging his shoes and bat
with the purpose of making it appear that
Brady had fallen into a drunken sleep, a
suburban car came thunder ng down the

late to escape the notice of Motorman E.
M. West, who vainly tried to stop the car
before the prostrate man was reached.

was broken and his left thigh cut open
from hip to knee.
Brady is now at the Baptist Sanitarium,
where his death is momentarily expected.

on the track rifling Brady's pockets, who
fled at the approach of the car.
STEAMBOAT RUNS THE GAUNTLET.
F.red Upon Continuously by Mississippi
L.veo Guards iir a Distance of
Filly Mites.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 7.-The
steamboat New South, which reached
Plnquemine to-day, had a perilous trip up
the river. It seems that the vessel aroused
the enmity of the levee guards in going
too near the levee, for she was tired upon
nearly all the way from Convent to
Plaquemine, a distance of fifty mile*. At
Convent nine men with Winchesters fired
a volley, putting two bullets through the
pilot-house, one of them within a couple
of inches of the pilot's head. At several
other points the guards opened fire, and
when the New South reached Plaquemine
the captain and passengers were thorÂ»
ouerhly frightened. Captain Kerwood tied
the boat up, saying he would keep her so
until the high water subside. i, even if she
has to remain idle all summer, rather
than run the gauntlet again. He denies
that the New South violated the levee
laws.

GRANT MEMORIAL TREE.
Li Hung Chang Shows His H.gh Regard
for the Dead Soldier in a Most
Appropriate Manner.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 7.â On the
southwest comer of the old site of Grant's
tomb, within 100 feet of the present monu
ment, a tree was planted to-day by Yang
Yu, ex-Minister from China, as a tribute
from Li Hung Chans to General Grant,
Yang Yu personally representing the
Viceroy at the planting ceremonies. TLe
high regard which Li Hung Chang enter
tained for Grant has been manifested on
numerous occasions, and when in New
York last summer he expressed the desire
of indicating nis esteem in a permanent
manner. It was suggested to have a tree
planted on the site of the old tomb, and
the Viceroy was greatly pleased with the
idea.
Nothing more was aaid about the mat
ter until Yang Yu was instructed by Li to
attend to the matter before bis departure
lor Europe. This instruction was re
ceived several days ago, and Yang "Vu's
private secretary immediately communi
cated with the Park Commissioners, ask
ing them to furnish a tree. Ou Thursday
a small ginkgs biloba tree, found both in
Japan and China, wÂ«s selected.
The tree planted to-day is nearly seven
feet high. Yang Yu read a few lines from
a Chinese manuscript and tlirew a shovel
ful of clay upon the roois of the tree. His
secretary famished the following literal
translation of Yang's words:
This tree was planted at the side ol the
tomb of General Grant, ex-President of the
United Stales, for the purpose of commemora
ting him, by Li Hung Chansr, Guardian Prince,
Grand Secretary of State and Earl of the First
Order.
The original, in Chinese and its trans
lation, will be cut on marble near the
tomb.
RUSSELL SAGE EXPLAINS.
Denies That He Has Ever Had km
Surious Friction With George
Gould.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 7.- Russell
Sage said to-day in regard to his reported
friction with Gould:
"The story is written for sensation. My
relation* with Gould are not unfriendly
or strained and have not been so. I see
him every day when in the city and dis
cuss with him the affairs of the companies
in which we have common interests. I
regret the circulation of such rumors be
cause they are calculated to do great
harm. What 1 regret most is the possible
eftect ou holders of the Pacific securities.
I did about a year ago ask Gould to ap
point a committee to examine transactions
involving the construction of the Louisi
ana line. Gould has not appointed the
committee yet, but promised he would.
The Missouri Pacific isdoing well. Treas
urer Calef told me only yesterday that
our finances are in better shape than they
have been for four years. I have $1,000,000
of the company's bonds in a safe deposit
vault and never touch them except to cut
off coupons as they come due."
George Gould went to his country place
in the Catskills Wednesday. He will not
return until next week.

Two Prominent Residents of Penn
sylvania Supposed to Have
Perished In the Flames.
PARIS, Fkakce, May 7.â Paris has re
covered somewhat iroru the shock of the
great disaster, but 13 now in mourning.
Twenty of the victims of the fire were
buried to-day. The churche3 in which
the services were held and the streeta
along which the funeral passed were
densely crowded with people, all of whom
displayed the deepest sympathy. NeTer
since the funeral of President Carnot has
there been such an appearance of general
sorrow in the city.
The ruins of the charity bazaar have
been so thoroughly explored that there
is little chance of the di-covcry of more
bodies. Of those recovered but few now
remain to be identified and it is probable
that some of the bodies may never be rec
ognized, as there are always in Paris peo
ple from all parts of the world who would
perhaps not be missel for months.
An investigation will be made a3 to the
cause of the terrible loss of life, with the
intention of fixing the responsibility if
possible. It is now believed that the fire
rva- started by the explosion of a lamp
used to illuminate the kiueniatogiaph.
In the debris to-day the police are re
ported to have found a purse marked,
I "H. L. C. K. S., New YorK," with a frag
ment of a burnt skirt, to which was at
tached a belt and pocket. In the side
pocket were a purse, gloves, nickel key,
: red powder-box marked "Perry, London,**
a small medicineca-e containing pas*
titles, and two pocket handkerchiefs with
j red borders.
In the presence of the Russian and
! German Embassadors the Comtesse de
; Hunolstain, sister-in-law of the Duchess
d'Uzes, was buried to-day from the
Church of St. Clotilde. Delegations from
many charities supported by the Comtessa
! followed the coffin.
Enibassad'or Eustis, who had previously
written to M. Kanotaux, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, expressing condolence for
the families of the victims of the fire,
called personally upon the Minister this
afternoon and reueated the expressions ol
profound sympathy.
President Faure has received a dispatch
from the Czar, expressing sincere Byra
pathy witn the families of the victims and
staling Kussia is profoundly moved by the
catastrophe.
Due d'Aumale expired at 2 a. k. to-day
in a villa at Zucco, Sicily, of cardiac apo
plexy. The shock upon learning of the
charity bazaar disaster, in which the
Duchess d'Alencon perished, is supposed
to have caused the seizure. The Duchtsi
was the wife of the Due's nephew, second
son of Prince Louis Phillipe d'Orleans,
Cornte u'Eu. The attack which caused
the Duke's death lasted only a few mo
ments, and he expired without suffering.
Princess Clementine of Orleans, wife of
Prince Augusta of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotiia and sister of Due d'Aumale, at
whose villa at Zucco he nad been staying,
is very ill. The Princess is 80 years old
and the shock caused by the sudden death
of her brother may prove fatal.
Upon bearing of the death of Dnc2
â 
d'Aumale President Faure sent an aid-de
camp to inscribe his name at the residence |
of the iate Due d'Aumale and Due d'Alen- j
con.
The Dufce's body will be embalmed and
taken to the Dreux royal mausoleum of
the house of Orleans and interred in the
tomb of his wife, thus following the re
mains of the Duchevs d'Alencon within
a comparatively short time.
Henry Kugene Philippe Louis D'Orleans,
Duke d'Aumale, the fourth son of Louis
Philii p\ King of France from 1830 to 1848,
was born at Pans January 16, 1822. He
distinguished himself as a student, espe
cially in the school of history, and won
the honors of liis class in the Lyceum
Henry IV. He entered the army at the
age otlb, and saw his first real service as
lieutenant in Algiers in 1840, where he
served with distinction in the operations
against Abd-el-Kader until 1847. gaining
promotion to a generalship. In 1847 lie
was appointed Governor-General of Al
giers, in which office he remained until
the revolution in Paris in 1848 lost the
throne to his father.
It was at this time that he gave sucb a
proof of nis patriotism as to win the
respect and love of the people of Franco
which he ever afterward retained. Being
urued by bis friends to employ the large
force at his command against the revolu
tionists and reseat his father he replied:
"France has willed that the Orleans dy
ua*tv should be dethroned. I shall never
seek to trample upon the national will.
Asa Frenchman and an officer to that will
I bow." He tendered his resignation to
the new Government and retired to the
magnificent ancestral seat of the Condes
at Chantilly, near Paris, where he devoted
ininseli to his books and his horses, win
nine ;aine in both these rather ancaconis
tic lines. The horses of his fine stud,
whose stables, hundreds of years old, ara
famous for their size and style of archi
tecture, wop. many prizes at the Chanlilly
and other racing events.
As a student of history he was one of tho
foremost men of his day. In 1887 he pub-
HsUed a work entitled "Institutions Mili
taires de La France" and in 1869 the "Hls
toires dea Princes de Conde." These
works attract-d much attention in Francs
and ether Euro] can countries and in 1871
he received recognition of his merit in
being made a member of the French
Academy, of which be was president for
Borne years prior to his death.
Though never anything of a politician
the Duke was elected a member of the
Assembly in the stirring times of IS7I and
rendered a patriot's service to bft-j country
in her hour of need. At the breaking out
oi the Franco Prussian war he offered his
services to iSmoeror Napoleon, but that
monarch saw fit to decline them. He
was, however, ni::de a general of d. vision
under tiie Republic ia 1.872,
The Duke was a man of line physical
appearar.ee â above the average height,
erect and broad - shouldered. Of late
years his soldierly though pleasant face
has worn rather a sad cast from succes
sive bereavements of his dearly beloved
wife, Princess Caroline, of the Bourbon
S cilies, who died in Decemoer, 1569. and
other members of his family.
The Duke leaves two brothers, Princo
Gaston d'Orieans and the Prince de Join
vilie, and or.c sister, Princess Clementine,

t-on of the machine he has made. Balloons
have been eiven a cigar shape fifteen or
twenty years, and been navigated in the
air with some -jegreo o! succesi by various
inrentors. There is, so far as I can judi;e
fioni the meager accounts of the machine
and its performance, nothing new or novel
in either. In the ujipsr atmosphere there
never is a calm, and no apparatus or de
vice has yet been invented which will en

to propel a balloon against a very slight
breez-j. If Professor Barnard drove his
machine at the rata of twelve miles an
hour, as reported, it was because the
wind was blowing at that rate and he
went with it."
Professor Lansley spoke of the progress
that has been made in the developments
aerostatics in France, where ten or a
dozen years ago two captains of the
French army produced a balloon which,
on a day of nearly absolute calm, jour
neyed from Mantone five or six miles and
returned.
"The success of that machine," said :
Langley, "was largeiy due to the exceed- I
in?; lightnes* of the storage-battery which
furnished the power. SineÂ© then better
t. ings have been produced. It is believed \
the French Government has in its posses
sion a balloon apparatus wnich will do
much more than the invention of the two j
captains years ago. It is closely guarded
by the inventors, ana none outside of tne
workmen know anything of the principles
en which it is constructed. These balloon j
machines are radically different from the ;
aerodrome, which is proDelled through I
the air without a sustaining power of its
own. This form of navigation of the air
has been successfully accomplished only
in one instance â that was the one I have
made here."
"How far have you driven that?"
"I have been limited by the fact of its
not being large enoueh to sustain the
weight of a man. I haven't permitted it
to get beyond control and range off into
the wilderness. Although it is nearly a
thousand times as heavy as the atmos
phere successful flights from half to
three-quarters of a mile have been made.
That being possible, there ia no reason
why larger ones cannot be sustained."

PROTECTION OF
THE SEAL HERDS
Salisbury's Refusal to
Be Followed by New
Tactics.
Ex-Secretary Foster to Enter
Negotiations With Japan
and Russia.
Policy of the Administration Out
lined to the Foreign Relations
Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 7-â Ex-
Secretary of Stale Foster was before the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
about an hour to-day. It was the first
full meeting of the committee for some
months. The new membersâ Foraker
and Clarke â were present. The subject
discussed was the necessity of providing;
additional safeguards for the protection of
the seal nerds in Bering Sea.
It has been demonstrated by experience
that tue regulations established by the
Paris tribunal, including the sixty-mile
limit, are insufficient to accomplish the
purposes desired. Pelagic sealing outside
the prescribed limit is sufficiently dis
astrous to speedily wipe cut the remain
ing seals. To prevent this Foster was
selected by President McKinley and Sec
retary Gage to negotiate with Great
Bri am a modification of the modus vi
vendi, which does not expire until the
close of the sealing season of 1898.
Salisbury's refu-al to enter upon the ne
â  gotiations has just been received, and at
the meeting to-day Foster explained to
the committee that it was the purpose of
the administration to endeavor to induce
Russia and Japan to aid the United States
,to preserve the seals. The whole situa
tion was canvassed thoroughly, the Sena
tors evincing a general interest in the
matter.
Pursuant of this announced purpose of
the administration .Foster will sail from
New York May 19. Ha will proceed to St.
Petersburg, where it is hoped he will be
able to effect an arrangement with the
Russian Government by which unre
stricted sealing on the Pacific Coast can
be prohibited and a closed season secured.
Similar negotiations, it is said, will be
conducted with the Japanese Minister at
Washington to cover the waters adjacent
to that country. The administration does
not believe the British Government will
maintain its refusal to further consider
the matter at the instance of the United
Stats, and if the arrangements suggested
shall be perfected it is thought that Salis
bury's Cabinet will be inclined to modify
the position it has assumed.
At the meeting of the committee to-day
the vote upon the arbitration treaty was
diicussed in connection with the seal
question and the opinion expressed that
the voies necessary to defeat its ratifica
tion were secured at the very last, after
the action of tne British Cabinet upon the
request of the United States for a con
ference upon the seal question became
known.

binca the construction of the new navy
was begun lha rule has been to build ves
sels on the department's plans, but in
building the Porter the Herreschoffs were
eiven authority to build from their own
design. Figures* at the department show
that for extra work on the engines an i
boilers of the Porter to make her fulfill
requirements the Herreshoft's have been
paid $'21,20'J, and experts it is extra
crMnary that contractors for a vessel
which was presumably designed to
develop certain j-peed and power siiould
be pai ! so lar^e a sum in excess of the
contract price.
The ra ost serious defect in the vessel is
that her bow is much higher out of water,
and her stern correspondingly lower than
they should be. Her departure from the
trim line is about three feet, when It
should not be more than three inches.
One result of the defect will be to prevent
the vessel from entering some of the
shallow waters in tlie rivers. Another
defect is that she is not galvanized in
side. Her hull is construe led pi thin steel
plates, and the action of the interior water
down in the bilges is apt to *ust holes
through plates. While the Porter was
undergoing construction miscalculations
were discovered, making it necessary to
lengthen her live leet.
SHARP REPLY TO SELFRIDGE.
' The Rear-Adm ral Ordered to Remain at
His Post Instead of Going to the
Queen's Jubilee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 7.âRear
i Admiral Seifridge, commanding the
! European stiition, wants to represent the
| navy at the Queen's jubilee ceremonies in
i June, and believes the Navy Department
is invadi!i!Â» his privileges as a commander
of the European fleet when it assigns
Admiral Miller and another ship to this
! duty. Seifridge took his squadron up the
Baltic and with his big staff went across
Russia to Moscow, where he attended the
crowning of the Czar, and now he wants
to perform the same duty for the navy
'â  when the Queen celebiates her diamond
I jubilee. He has protested to Washington
i against Admiral Miller's detail, and h:is
! been sent a sharp lettor from the Secretary
; in which he is informed that the situation
I in the far East 19 too perilous to warrant
I his withdrawal for service elsewhere. HÂ«
I is also told that he will remain where he
is until affairs assume a more tranquil
state, and that under no circumstances
will he be ordered to London in June.
One reason that the Brooklyn was sent
j over was to uvoid the withdrawal of any
' ships attached to the Mediterranean fleet
for jubilee service.

NEW YORK, N. V., May 7.â Tnere was
a reguiar epideiuic ot fires in this city last
night, and in several of them loss of life
occurred. One of the first was in a cold

Three firemen who had carried a hose

In a fire on Essex street, that destroyed

Everything indicated thai the fire was of

perished was the one who started the tire.
On Fifty-third street a tenement house

MILITARY MEN
ARE EXERCISED
Major-General Wheaton
Retires for Age
To-Day.
General Brooke His Probable
Successor, but There Are
Others.
Plan Suggested by Which Three
Brigadiers May Reach the
Highest Grade.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 7.â The se
lection of a successor to Major-General
Wheaton, who will be retired for age to
morrow, was discussed at the Cabinpt
meeting to-day, but no decision was
reached, although it has already been
agreed by the President and Secretary
Alger that Brigadier-General Brooke shall
be promoted to the highest grade in the
army. New and interesting features have
entered into tlie'~'situntion which may re
sult in other ofiisers attaining unexuected
advancement without interfering in any
way with the aspirations of General
Brooke, but Brooke's friends have become
alarmed and are afraid that his chances
for promotion may be injured.
General Brooke reached Washington to
day in response to a telegram, and has the
advantage of being on the ground to*per
sonaUy superintend his campaign. He
will not go on the retired list until 1902.
Two other brigadier-generals, Forsythe
and Bliss, will be retired before then, thus
spoiling their chances for reaching the
grade of major-general.
Both are anxious to attain the highest
rank, and the suggestion has been made
to the President that if General Forsythe
be appointed to succeed Whcaton he will
retire voluntarily immediately, leaving
the vacancy for General BlUs, who will
also go out of active service on receiving
advancement and leave the field free to
Brooke with rive years of service ahead of
him before his regular and natural relega
tion to the retired list.
That is the plan to which the President
and Cabinet are giving attention. Its
scope, however, is greater than it appears.
Not only will President McKinley have
an opportunity of appointing three major
generals, but three brigadier-generals.
Politics generally enters into the promo
tions of general officers, although the
executive does not always gratify politi
cians.
Merit frequently, if not always, is the
big factor in determining who shall be
honored. However, every candidate who
secures advancement has his political
backers work just as hard in his interest
as they do for some henchman who con
trols a vote, and six vacancies among the
general officers of the army to fill gives the
President the opportunity of paying six
political favors.
The friends of Forsythe are making a
bard fight. Bliss' chances are seemingly
not so good, bat his supporters are not
idle. Some opposition among army
officers to the proposed scheme on the
ground of its fruition may tend to create
criticism of the retired list and ultimately
lead to curtailing or abolishing it.

FORECLOSURE FAR
IN THE FUTURE
No Possibility of Such
Suit Going- Through
This Year.
There Is a Possibility That the
Union Pacific Will Not Be
Foreclosed Upon.
Legal Complcations That Will Delay
Any Action Commenced In
the Courts.
OMAHA. Nepr., May 7. â Labor circles
are much interested in a story printed by
a local paper to-day declaring that there
is no probability of the Union Pacific fore
closure going through this year, and prob
ably not at all.
An official "on the inside" is quoted as
the authority, without mentioning names.
In the course of the conversation he said:
"I understand thai Master-in-Chancery
Cornish has been in New York taking tes
timony from holders of various liens
against the Union Pacific other than thai
of the Government's. Now, after all that
testimony has been taken, it is going to
be some time before the master will give
his report on the cases to the court. Even
if these reports were accepted by all par
ties concerned and at once ronfirmed by
the Federal courts it would take a montti
or more, but it is pretty well understood
that there will be protests from the holders
of certain liens. It is natural in a case
like Ibis, where their interests might De
adversely affected, that there should arise
objections.
"These disagreements will cave more '
delay, and even after that there are half a j
dozen legal processes necessary before the
sale can take place, including the adver- j
tising of the sale for sixty days'. That's
the reason I seriously doubt if there will
be any foreclosure this year. But one '
guess is as good as another. In fact, I I
doubt that a foreclosure saie of the Union '
Pacific Railway Will ever take place at all. i
The receivership may be terminated with- j
in a year, or possibly somewhat less time,
but the road will be operated by the own- '
ers the way they think most profitable.
There are many legal points in the fore- â 
closure proceedings, and it will take some j
time to solve thnm all."

CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 7. -Joseph

were worse than usual.
Abaut midnight, having in vain at
tempted to relieve his pain, he started from i
the house saying that he was going to find
a dentist. He did not return, but his!
absence caused his wife no alarm, as she
concluded that he had decided to stay in â 
me dentist's ofiice until morning.
This morning she was horrified on en- ;
tering an outbouse to find the body of her '<
husband hanging there. He had been
dead for several hours. The man nnd
evidently committed suicide when he left i
the house at midnicht. The pain had ap- |

THE SUGAR BEET
The Secretary Enthusi
astic Over the New
Industry.
He Distributes Seed to About
Twenty Thousand
Farmers.
Confident of Great Resu'ts and the
Enlistment of Unlimited
Capital.
WASHINGTON, D. CL, May 7.â A map
of the United Sates with a broad red
stripe running across it from the Atlantic
to the Pacific will soon ornament the
walls of the cilice of the Secretary of Agn
-e. This map, and particularly this
stripe, will interest especially two great
c asr-t s of citizens of the United States â
rmers and the capitalists.
â¢â¢Having distributed sugar-beet seed to
20.000 farmer-," said Secretary Wil
son to The Call correspondent, ''I want
to take up the practical end of this sub
ject now and show to the capitalists as
well as to the larmers where they can
afford to make such experiments and en
ter upon such bu*iness investments as are
likely to be a success financ ally and
otherwise."
â¢You still have faith, then, in the beet
sugar enterprise from a practical stand
point ?"
"Undoubtedly; and it is evident that
the people of the United States have faith
in it. Wj have supplied in the last two
weeks :\J .OOO farmer* of the country with
--beet seeJs for experiment during
the coming season. They are scattered
through practically every State north of
the ex:ren;e southern line of States. The
people as far south as the Carolinas, Ten-
and Texas be!ieve that tbey can
grow suear-beets successfully, and we are
quite willing to give them fall oppor
tunity to make that test everywhere. If
-ucceed in extending the beet-sugar
territory duwn to the very line of the cave
- are^ there ougiit to be no difficulty
ducinc in the United S.ates ail of
the 5100,000.000 worth of sugar for which
we are now going abroad annually.
â â¢The practical business end of this ex
periment," continued Secretary Wilson,
as he glancei at the map of the United
States hanging upon the wall of his office,
c neit thing to be tafcen up. We
supplied people in all parts of the
con try with sugar-beet seeds, and they
can now go on with ;neir experiments in
growing them. Meanwhile we shall train
our more technical Lut equally important
investigation to determine what part of
thf country is most likely to be a success
ful field for operations both in actual
growth of the beeti and the production of
the highest grades of sugar. ThiÂ« is a
tubj"ct which the capitalists of the coun
try especally want lo know about. It
tane: money to establish a sugar Jactory.
It is not practicable for the farmer io raise
a few acres of beets and turn them into
sugar upon his own farm. The factory
ruujt have sucn expensive machinery and
be operated upou such a large scale as to
absorb the production oi several farms if
it is to be a financial success.
"So the capitalists who are waiting to
put their money into beet-sugar factories
are entitled to all the information whica
we can e;ve tbem as to the section or sec
tions o: country where beet su^ar is most
likely to be successfully produced and
likely :o be most successful in prcduction.
To this end -iney ought to have the beat
information that can be obtained in regard
to climate, soil, transportation conven
iences and other elements which enter
into a determination of these questions.
Tne rext step which I propose to under
then ia to put into the Lands oi some
competent person i r persons the study of
this subject, including climate, rainfall,
character of soil and other matters of this
kind in different parts of the various
Stttes.
"Tne record of the climate and rainfall
for a term ot years can readily be obtained
almost anywhere. Samples of soil can
â ..â e ( btained and analyzed. Where it
ii practicable to mate these analyses at
tÂ£e State experiment stations tms will be
done; where it is not practicable the
samples of soil will be forwarded here or
to such otner convenient pointi as may
beseiecttd and analyses made. In ihis
waf, wUle the farmers are experiment
nig with the growth of the sugar beet, we
expect to make equally important experi
ments and researches from this stand
point, and by a comoination of these ex
periments be ab.e to indicate to the peo
ple desiring to invest in the establish
ment of sugar factories tbe locations or
the strip of country where they are most
lively to meet with succes and likely to
meet witn the most success."
'You think there is capital in the coun
try ready to go into the bud-sugar manu
facturing industry?"'

BIG JEWELRY ROBBERY.
Burglars Decamp Wnh $25,000 Worth
of Jewelry and Money Hidden

NEWARK, N. J.. May 7,â William Mc-
Connville, jeweler at 372 Broad street, re
ported to the police to-night that ne had
been robbed of $25,000 worth of watches,
diamonds and money some time to-day.
He thought his stock was not safe, and
kept it in a stror.g box in his bedroom,
uver the store. The box was secured by
a riveted hasp and a big padlock, and the
door of the bedroom was locked. All the
valuables were secure at 1 o'clock this
afternoon when he examined them, but
when he went to the room at *i o'clock
this evening the bedroom door was open,
the lid of tne box broken, the trays were
scattered on tue floor and all the valua
bles were gone. AicConville says he diii
not believe any one but his wife knew of
the existence of the stiong box. It con
tained 200 gold watches, ten dozen dia
mond rings, ten pairs diamond earrings,
three dozen diamond pins, lockets, goU
chains, etc., $200 in money. There is no
clew.
KILLED J5Â» FALLING BHICKS.
Careleisnet* lteipon*it>le for the Death
of a Girl-
DENVER, Colo., May 7.â May Bailey,
a young stenographer, while walking past
the new McMurtin building at the head
of Sixteenth street last Thursday, was
struck on the head by bricks falling irom
the top story. She fell Ike a log and died
an hour later at the City Hospital.
Passers-by at the time ot the accident
say that the unfortunate girl did no: nttur
a soiiiid. Tiie bricks came down with a
great crash and the young lady dropped
to the pavement without a moan. Some
men rushed to her assistance at once, but
they found her unconscious.
a" venicle was i romptiy summoned and
she was taken to the hospital. She never
recovered consciousness up to the time ot
her death. The puysicians in attendance
at the hospital found that her skull was
badly fractured.
The accideiit has caused the greatest in
dignation in this city. Gross carelessness
is charged against the people at wort on
the bu.lding, and a rigid investigation is
to be set on foot. When it is lound who
is responsible ior the *ad affair criminal
prosecution will be started.
It i- more than probable, too, that the
relatives of the girl may sue the owners
of the building. She was a very popular
young lady and leaves many mourning
friends.
THE EAYMAKKEL IRAGEDY.

mctnbrrrd in Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., May 7. âIt was
eleven years Tuesday night since the
tnrowing of the anarchist bomb in Hay
market Square that killed seven police
men and wounded sixty-seven others.
The day will never be forgotten by the
members of the police force, many of
whom will carry the scars or the terrible
event to their dying day ; bat no attempt
has so far been made to recognize each re
curring anniversary with a reunion or
o;her exercises.
Short.y alter the tragedy a monument
to the memory of the heroic dead, taÂ£;ng
the form of a li?e-s:ze figure o! a police
man on a pedestal of graiiite, was erected
on the spot where the bomb exploded.
Recently, however, ccmplainis have been
made by the Catholic Archbishop, who
holds in trust considerable property in
the region, that the position of the statue
impeded the progress of vehicles
through HaymarlÂ»et square, which is
used as a greai public rnarcet. The City
Council therefore ordered the removal of
the statue to Union Park, where :t will be
re-erected in a lew day*.

Clemency for a Man H ho Staffed Hit
Sweetheart.
DAYTON", Ohio., May 7.â Albert Frantz,
who was to be electrccuted Thursday for
murdering his sweetheart, Bessie Little,
was granted an indefinite respite.
A strong pressure was brought to bear
in favor of Frantz. It was shown that he
was noi in bis right senses when he cora
mitied tne aeed. He was insanely jea.ous
of his sweetheart, and tor some time pre
vicu'.i to the murder he had been acting
queerly..
* The "indefinite respite granted probably
means that his sentence will be commuted
to imprisonment for life.
As iÂ»r as Framz him-eif is concerned he
shows the utmost ; indifference to what is
done. He is apparently unmoved by the
prospect of the awful fate which may be
in store for him. He never talks about
the crime, and is always pleasant to his
jailers.

LOS ANEEbES, Cal.. May 7.â There is
a "hen on" in Los Augelea politics, and it
is expected to hatch out harmony in the
Democratic ranks. Star chamber sessions
of local Democrats, sworn to secrecy,
have been held lately, and as a result a
new political club having for its object
the booming of Governor Baud for United
States Senator has been formedâ though
the members are noi all willing to admit
it. J. W. Mitchell, who is supposed to be
as near as anybody to the Governor, is
presumably the leader in the movement.
Major Harry Patton says it is a "Jefferson
dab," but does not intend to capture
anything.
The organization of the club was the re
sult of a circular recently sent o'lt to se
lected Democrats who were not adherents
of Senator White asking them to meet at
the law office of Creighton A Rogers on
May 4 to effect a permanent organization
of the new political association. At the
first meeting a temporary oreauization
was effected by the election of C. C.
Wright as president, Telfair Creighton as
treasurer and A. W. Fisher as secretary.
It was decided to ca.l the organization the
Jefferson Club.
Among those who participated were: C.
1 C. Wright, William Mead?, Mr. Drom
: gold, A. W. Fisher, Mr. McÃride, Mr.
; Rogers, Tsifair Creighion, George Roberts
\ and others. Some of these will not remain
in the club, as there are contradictory re
; ports as to its purpose. T:>e current be
; lief is that it is formed solely to advance
; the interests of Governor Budd as a Sena

by the piercinc screams from the frantic
child, who ran around the side of the hill
in full view ot the people below.
Several men tore off their coats and ran
to the rescue. The flames were smothered
and the giri was carried to a drugstore.
The attempt to save her life proved
futile and she died in about an hour. She

Retiring 1 Treasurer of
Fresno Makes Good
a Shortage.
Repays $14,000 in Time to
Prevent Suit Against His
Bondsmen.
Had Speculated With the City's
Funds and Failed to Realize
Upon Securities.
FKESNO. Cal., May 7.â Not until to
night were the City Trustees enabled to
allow April warrants on the treasury â a
delay of a few days. Not until to-day did
W. H. McKenzie, the retiring Treasurer,
turn over to his successor the full amount
ol money the books showed the city to be
entitled to.
Mr. McKenzie should hare surrendered
his office last month, but when the time
came for him to do so he was $14,000 short
in ca3h. He had taken this amount of
the municipality's money and loaned it.
Tne matter was kept vary quiet, as it
was believed that Mr. McKenzie would be
able to make up the deficiency.
He had what he claimed to be ample
securities for the $14,000 and was given a
few days to realize on them, but he dm
not do this as readily as had been ex
pected.
To-day was the last day given him by
the Trustees, and had he not raised the
mopey the board would have instructed
the City Attorney at its meeting to-night
to proceed to collect the $14,000 from Mc-
Kenzie's bondsmen. Tne derelict Treas
urer succeeded in getting the deficiency
during the day.
Mr. McKenzie has been Treasurer of the
city for maay years. He was formerly
manager of the defunct Fresno Loan ana
Savings Bank.
GRIFFITH AGAIX IN FATOR.
The Heal Estate Agent Iteinttated in the
Hundred, Xhounnnd Club.
FRESNO, Cal., May 7.â The Hundred ;
Thousand Club last night reinstated S. |
N. Griffith as one of its members. A few i
weeks ago Griffith was expelled from the !
organization. He was charged with j
bringing six men from Chicago in a land ,
colonization scheme under false repre
sentations. In Chicago he had promised
them employment immeditely upon their
arrival in Fresno, at the mills of the |
Fresno Fume and Irrigation Company, ,
but he failed to provide the employment :
and it whs then aeknowleged tbat he had |
misrepresented matters to the men. Upon j
this showing the cub expelled him.
Last niiiht Mi. Griffith produced a
letter from thÂ« manager of the Lumber
Company in which it was stated tiiat there
had been an understanding to the effect
that the lend azent couid offer employ
ment for so many men. The company
could not keep its promise, and the blame
for thie fell on Griffith. Upon a correct
showing of the facts tne agent was re
stored to membership in tne club.
PAWNED RIxGS FOR PASSAGE.
M/f Valley Their Destination and to Get
There They Sacrifice Their
Gold.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., May 7.â A pecu
liar and embarrassing incident was the
one in which two of Artist L. P. Latimer's
lady students found themselves to-day.
They were compelled to sacrifice their dia
mond rings in order to go sketching with
the ciasj.
It seems that the two ladies had instruc
tions to te at the Sausalito ferry in San
Francisco in time to meet the rest of the
class and journey to Mill Valley on a
sketching expedition. They arrived at
the wharf eariy and handed the amount
of their fares to Mr. Latiraer, who was to
purchase their tickets. They had plenty
of time left before the boat went so they
took a walk about the wharves. When
they returned Mr. Latimer and the rest of
the class, together with their tickets, were
gone on the boat which pulled out just as
iiiey returned.
They were without money and bad no
means of purchasing tickets so as to get
to Mill Valley to join the sketching class.
Finally one of the ladies offered to put iip
her gold ring as security with the licket
selier. lie gave them the tickets and
they joined the clas3 at Mill Valley. When
they returned this evening they got the
ring out of bondage, much to their relief
and gratification.
Wedded at detjMerville.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., May 7.â Oscar

ONCE A PORTLAND GAMBLER.
Career of â¢â¢ Buck " Garretson, Whose
Fortune Has Dsappeand in
Wall Street.
PORTLAND, Or., May 7.â During ihe
height of the Villard boom there came to
Portland from the East a bright young
fellow named "Buck" Garretson. He
could have cleared a comfortable fortune
in the boom, but he held on until it col
lapsed and lost all.
Then he turned gambler, but in the
summer of 1888 his young wife persuaded
bim to abandon the unlawful calling, and
the coupie left Portland. When Garret
son departed his destination Was Colorado.
Nothing more was heard of the Garret
sons tiil about five years ago, when Mrs.
Garretson, then living in Denver, wrote to
Iriends hsre referring to "Buck's" great
success in handling mininp properties for
others, either by manipulating the shares
or by disposing of good claims to Eastern
capitalists.
Tlie Evening Telegram to-day received
a letter from an ex-Portlander now in
Denver, C0'.0., inclosing the appended
clipping from a New York paper:
Frank Garretson, who came to New York
from Colorado two years ago -with something
over .*2, 000, 000, is a bankrupt- His beautiiul
residvi.ee uptown, together wiih its valuable
content?, were to-day turned over to Solomon
Redman's Sons to settle a Dalance of $19,000
due them on a Chicago wheat contract.
"When 'Buck' left Cripple Creek for
good," ?ays the, letter, "he was supposed
to be worth $5, 000, 000, but the wealth of
rich men always is set many notches too
high. 1 am sure, though, that he was
good for $2,000,000. He never struck a
pick in tne ground, but from the very
start be Acted as middleman for prospect
ors and men of money, the former having
no pnd of confidence in his honesty.
"This fortune, which for all time should
have satisfied Garretson, was dissipated in
luckless vpntures in less than eighteen
month". It is alleged that lie dropped
$503,00) alone in the Chicago wheat pit
'snorting' cereals when the market began
to rise, ana the Chicago papers did not
seem to thinK the drop important enough
to devote a few lines to it. The rest of
Garretson's wealth was absorbed by Wall
street."
FATAL FIRE AT FAIRBANKS.

gayetv, as it was formerly intended it
should be.
As a committee of ?even to accompany
the remains of Grand Secretary Brenier to
Alameda the grand chief ranger appointed
Delegates Kavanaugb, Donovan, McCar
thy, Teny, Levy, Aron and Usinger. The
Grand Court appointed a committee of
seven to make arrangements to procure a
suitable monument to be erected in honor
of the late grand secretary.
At 11 o'clock this forenoon the grand
officers and delegates to the Grand Court
formed in Una in front of the Odd Fel
lows' Hall and marched in silent time to
the nnJertaking-rooms of R. E. Bevan,
where they were joined by the member*
of the local court, a:id preceded by the In
dependent brass band escorted the body
of the deceased secretary to the A-street
depot, where it was placed on the train,
and at 12 o'clock departed for San Fran
cisco. The following members of Court
Pride of this tity acted as pall-bearers:
T. A. McKenna, H Elniore, F. Terstegge,
.). M. Morrissey, Emison Boulton and W.
C. Burroughs.
This morning* session of the Grand
Court was chiefly occupied in reading
telegrams of sympathy from various courts
on this const and in the East on the death
of Grand Secretary Brenier. The question
of electing a new grand secretary then
came up. Julius CaHman was nominated
by E. J. Wolfe, and John J. Cordv was
nominated by Hugo Jv. Asuer. The elec
tion was postponed until thi? afternoon.
At the afternoon session Callman with
drew in favor of Cordy, and the latter was
chosen by acclamation. The new grand
secretary is a member of Aurora Court No.
2 of San Francisco, and has been assistant
secretary during the past year. He is a
very enthusiastic Forester, and has been a
member of the order since 1875. The per
capita tax was reduced from 80 cents to 75
cents, making it the lowest per capita tax
of any order in California. The Grand
Court will have a surplus of $1000 after
paying all mileage and other expenses of
the present session.
The installation of officers took place
this evening, and tbe delegatas will de
part in the morning. The grand ball at
the pavilion to-night was a Drilliant clos
ing to the week's festivities. Tne hospi
tality of the good people of Marysviile,
whose every aim was to make the stay of
the delegates pleasant, has been highly
appreciated.

The late C. H. Bremer was one of the
most amiable gentlemen who ever held
the oflice of grand secretary of any fra
ternal organization in San Francisco, and
he had a uappy faculty of making friends
at sight. In his relations to the order of
which he was grand secretary for many
years he was courteous, and ever
ready to give his advice to those who
needed it anil to set aright all those who
\ were in doubt about what was the law in
matters appertaining to tne'order. '
He was a conscientious, ham-working
officer, whose soul was in. the work before
him. Wnile on his sick bed at his home
in Alameda he arranged all the work for
the grand body, so that when it met, had
it not been for his physical appearance,
no one would have suspected that t c
work bad been performed by one wnowas
at death's door. -â â ,-. -7
Mr. Bremer was born in Germany on
April 10, 1864. Ha came to California
when only 9 years of age and bis parents
located in Aismeda. He passed through
the public schools of that place and
graduated from the Aiametia High School
in 18S1, so he was by education and train
ing a Cahfornian.
The first work after leaving school was
at tlie butcher business, but he left that
an. adopted ti.at of painter.
Almost immediately on coming of age
he jor.ied ihe Order of Forestersâ in 1885.
At the time of his death he was a mamuer
and past chief ranger ot Court Pride of
Alameda. While California Forestry was
still under the English jurisdiction l;e
was elected district secretary, and in 1887.

â when a division occurred in the order and
a portion seceded and organized as the
Ancient Order of Foresters of America, he
was chosen grand secretary, to which po
sition he was re-elected at every session of
the grand body without opposition.
In September, 18S5, Mr. Bremer joined
the Companions of ihe Forest, of which
be was a member at the time of his death.
He was past chief companion of Hamlet
No. 64 of Alameda. Ou the assembling
of the first Supreme Circle he was elected
inner guard, and at the second session he
was elected supreme secretary, which re
sponsible position he held until the office
of the Supreme Circle was removed to De
troit, Mich. Since that time he was an
nually sent as representative to the grand
bodies of both orders, and for his ser
vices he received many testimonials of
appreciation.
Mr. Bremer was also a member of
Grass Valley Conclave, Knights of Sher
wood Forest, a member of San Francisco
Lodge, Hermann's Sons, and at one time
a member of Gray EaÂ»le Tribe of the Im
proved Order of Red Men, but a short
time ago he transferred hia membership
to Kiowa Tribe.
Mr. Bremer leaves an ased mother and
a sister, Miss Agnes D. Bremer, who is
grand secretary of tne Companions of vhe
Forest (F. of A.) and who accompanied
him to Marysville.
Last June Miss Bremer was called upon
to mourn the loss of her father a. few aays
afier she hau been re-electea to tne posi
tion sne now holds, and now she mourns
over the remains of her brother, who was
stricken by death shortly after his re
election.
Arrangements have been made to have
tne funeral of the late grand secretary
take place from B'nai B'rith Hall on Sun
day afteruoon at 2 o'clock.

MORE BRINGS SUIT
AGAINST HIS AUNT
Warring Santa Barbara
Heirs Again Seen
in Court.
Mrs. Miller's Nephew Brings
Legal Action for Heavy
Damages.
Demands $!0,000 in Payment for
His Arrest on Santa Rosa â¢
Island.
SANTA BARBARA. Cal., May 7.â The
litigation over the estate of the late A. P.
More gives promise of dragging on in the
courts for decades to come. Another suit
was added to the list this afternoon when
J. C. More, one of the heirs, brought an
action against C. A. Stortce and Mrs. E.
M. Miller. Storke is the attorney for the
administratrix, and Mrs. Miller is the
special administratrix, having been ap
pointed last year after a bitter legal con
test to succeed John A. More, brother of
the late A. P. More and uncle of plaintiff
in the damage suit.
To-day's action results from the arrest
of J. C. More on April 8 at the instance of
C. A. Storke for disturbing the peace. The
arrest, the plaintiff claims, was in accord
ance with the conspiracy entered into be
tween the defendants to harass him to
the extent of compelling him to leave
Santa Rosa I-land, a part of the A. P.
More estate, and on which he resided.
More states in his complaint that on
March 16 he went to Storke's law effice in
thia city to effect a settlement of his ac
counts with Mrs. Miller, but was unable
to do so, owing to the captious objections
of the defendants.
On March 7 he went to the wharf to
take passage on the steamer Santa Rosa,
a boat belonging to the estate, for Santa
llnsa Island, but was informed by the
captain that he had instructions from
Mrs. Miller and Storke not to take
him to the island. More found means of
reaching the island, but in a few days was
removed under arrest. When he was ar
rested, he say^s the Constable informed
him that if his wife did not leave the
island she a .so would be arre.-ted.
The case against More lor disturbing
the peace was set down for a hearing on
April 12, and at the request of t> c de
fendant was continued to April 28. On
! that date, C. A. Storke had the District
| Attorney dismiss the case, notwithstand-
I ing the defendant had subpenaed wit
, nesses and wa;. ready ior trial.
Tlie dismissal caused considerable com
-1 ment in Santa Bartara. More declares in
i his complaint that the so.c reason for his
I arrest on the charge of disturbing the
I peace was to cause thÂ»Â» removal of himself
and wile from Santa Rosa Is and.
There has been a vast Amount of liti
gation over the More estate ever since A.
P. More's death ana the end is not yet in
sight. Attorney Storke is personally in- j
terested in the estate, several childr ii by
his divorced first wife, a Miss More, being
entitled to a share of the property at her
death. Storke's first wife is now Mrs. Sid j
Law and resides here.
Only one of the children is friendly to
the father. He is a son about IS years of
ape. The daughters bold aloof from him
and live with the mother. His activity in
the estate litigation* is supposed to be in
duced by a desire to protect the prospec
tive interests ot his son.
The administratrix of the estate is an
aunt of J. C. More. More's interest is es
timated at a twenty-seventh, but as the
estate is quite valuable this small portion
is worth having.
No one here is surprised nt this damage
suit, as trouble has been brewing for some
time between Mr*. Miller, Storks and the
heirs, the latter opposing the adminis
tratrix.

answer is ten thou-

HUDYAN, ten thousand
men say they have
been cured, ten thou-
sand men in black
and white testify to
the genuineness of the
cure. These proofs can
be seen, these men
can be consulted. You
may hire a man to
lie for you, but
ten thousand men would
come high â rather too
high for the inventor
or discoverer of the
HUDYAN remedy-treatment.
HUDYAN is not a

AND INFERENCES
Objected To as Evidence by
the Defense in the
Fair Case.
Another Day Was Wasted by
the Attorreys for the
Executors.
Persistent bat Uniformly Ineff^ctua
Efforts Made to Introduce Hear
say Evidence.
There was another season of frantic en
deavor on the part of the attorneys for the
executors of the Fair estate yesterday to
pet evidence into the Anjjus-Craven case
of a hearsay and wholly inadmissible char
acter, as ruieJ the court.
It was another day of clever parrying on
the part of the defense, although the
:.â  counsel for Mrs. Nettie Craven openly
stated that they had no particular objec
tion to the introduction of the best evi
dence held by the other side alleged to
snow forgery of Mrs. Craven's deeds, but,
as Judge Curtis o. New York aptly put it,
they were opposed to "'being morally con
v.cted on inferences and presumptions."
Mrs. Craven was not in court yesterday
owing to a severe attack of Illness, but
her charming daughter, Margaret, was
there to look after the mother's interests,
bhe frequently conferred with the attor
neys for the defense regarding matters of
vital importance to the case.
Witness vS'hitesides resumed the
stand to give further direct testimony re
garding the printing of notarial blanks by
the H. S. Crocker Company in August,
ISOS. He said he fixed the date of this
issue of blanks by means of his entry
book. As a rulo, said Whitesides, he re
ceived his orders from Mr. Stanford, but
on thi* particular occasion that .entlenian
was away on a vacation, and the witness
was left in charge of the legal department
of the establishment.
Fred Daniels, the man who locks up the
"forms" in the printing department of
Crocker's place, was the next witness. Al
though he was on the stand some time all
his evidence amounted to was an identifi
cation of the house's order for 5000 notar
ia; blanks in August, 1895.
As the morn'.ng session closed he was
excused from the stani.
in the aiternoon S. H. Wade, another
attache of the printing department of the
H. !?. Crocker Company, was pat on the
witness-stand. Mr. McEnerney showed
h im a proof r>f the issue of notarial blanks
ol M ireh, 1894, and asked him if he could
tdentifv it. Wade did, as regards the date,
and also recognized his identification
nark? on it.
in response to a question asked by the
. Mr. McEnerney explained that this
proof was offered for the purpose of show
ing, in connection with other evidence,
fhat between March, 1894, and August,
the Crocker Company never printed
any notarial blanks containing the phrase
o.ogy which appears upon the Craven
deeds, so that m consequence the latter
could not havo been executed in Septem
t cr. 1894. as claimed.
Judge Denson, lor the defense, claimed
that the production of this blank would
prove nothing, but after an argument the
court decided to admit tne document, de
spite the fact that an admission went
alone with it to the effect tnat evidence
01 this son wai not very weighty.
Tbe proof was shown to the jury and
then Attorney McEnerney offered tha al
leged order for those 1594 blanks to the
witness for identification.
Judge Cnrtis took the floor really for
the first time during the trial while the
jury was present. The gentleman made
quite an impression with the clearness
and conciseness of his logic. Several days,
lie said, had been consumed by the coun
sel for tne plaintiffs in a laborious effort
to squeez3 in inadmissible evidence â so
ruled repeatedly by the court. Mr. Me-
Enerney, he said, had tried the patience of
tbe court, and had accomplished little or
nothing. The issue that gentleman was
essaying to illegally prove was that the
deeds held by Mrs. Craven w*-re not gen
uine, alone wiih ihe acknowledgments ac
companying them. He challenged the
other side to produce one sound legal rea
son for the introduction of the sort of
proof they had been laboring to get be
fore the jury.
"We are not going to be convicted mor
ally before the public of this grave charge
that hangs over vs â we are not going to
be convicted, I say, and deprived of our
property by inferences and presumptions,"
said Jud^'e Curtis in conclusion. "'lt
must be by proof and only by proof that
is admissible under :he "law. There is
nothing here to show that these bianks
and printers' proofs, which seem to form
the basis of the plaintiffs' case, were not
printed outside of the jurisdiction of this
court and placed in those bins by design
inr hands so that they could be found."
Judge Slack committed himself again
as beine doubtful Â»s to th^ waieht of these
documents as evidence, but nevertheless
admitted the last cne as a possible circum
ttance going to prove something else.
The court took a short recess hete in
order to give the jurors and attorneys a
breathing and smoking speil, and when
the proceedings were resumed Mr. Delmas,
who had not reappeared after the noon
rest, was in attendance and took up the
.reins for the defense.
A clash occurred as soon as Wade was
as-ked by Me Enerney to identify the
pacKage from wnicb he is alleged to have
taken the proofs of the acknowledgment
blanks printed in 1894 and 1895. He could
not do it, and Judge Cords, for the de
fense, addressed the court again on the
advisability of putting a stop to the plain
tiffs' methods.
â : Judge Slack aereed with the New York
attorney, and the examination of Wade
wns abandoned by counsel for the plain
tiffs.
Daniel Keefo. foreman of the printing
room of the Crocker Company, was now
railed and asked to explain what the cu-
â torn was in hip department in handling
and carrying out orders for the manufac
ture oi legal blunks.
Cut an objec ion came from Mr. Delmas
to tne effpcf tdat the customs of the H. b.
Crocicer Company could in no possible
manner affect the rights of Mrs. Craven.
This precipitated a lengthy debate in
which nearly ail of the attorneys engaged
in the casp took a band.
Charles 8- Wheeler led the discussion
for the plaintiffs and cited a number of
IiEW TO-DAT. .

authorities, which, he claimed, supported
the adruissibility of evidence showing the
custom? of an establishment.
Then Mr. Dclraas took the floor. "After
listening to the argument of counsel on
the other side, and looking back to the
glowing pronii-es made by the plaintiffs
in their opening statement to the jnry,"
he said, "I cannot help exclaiming, 'How
the mighty have fallen.' They have
sought to mow down ihe reputations of
men tnd women here on the mere show
ing of the cuÂ«tom of an establishment,
carrying with it the possible error* of a 20

Attorney McEnerney said he thought
he could produce authorities that would
satisfy the court that their position was
right, and Mr. Belmas declared that if
counsel really thought so he would with
draw his objections and give tun a
chanc*. In consequence, the court did
not rule on the point, and will not do so
until after the debate is finished next
Monday.
NO CELEBRATION MONEY.
Why the Fourth of July Appropriation
Cannot Be Transferred Into the
Boulevard Fund.
There is no chance of the $3000 appro
priation for the Fourth of July celebra
tion being turned into the boulevard fund
for the simple reason that there is no
money to transfer, even if a legal way
could be found to do it.
The matter was under di-cussion at the
meeting of the Finance Committee of the
Board "of Supervisors yesterday, when
Auditor Broderick asked where the $3000
that it was proposed to transfer was to
come from.
"Wbv, irom the treasury," said Super-
Visor Delanv, confidently.
"But there is no money there to the
credit of the celebration fund," said the
Auditor. .
Supervisor Delany seemed surprised and
aske'> why. .
"Simply because the appropriation that
was made at the beginning of this fiscal
year *vas used up last Fourth of July,"
said the Auditor.
"You can't use money you haven't got,
and you will not have any Fourth of
July money until the new appropriations
are made up."
"But you didn't tell us this before,"
said Delany.
"You didn't ask me," was the answer,
and the Supervisor looked wise, ex
claimed "Oh !" and the matter dropped.
PRESS CLUB RECEPTION.
De Wolf Hopper and Denis O'Snllivan
to Join Many Friends To-Night
at a Smoker.
Denis O'Snllivan, the native San Fran
ciscan wno has been playinj "Snaaius
O'Brien," and De Wolf Hopper, of "El
Capitan," are to be received informally
to-night at the Press Clnb.
There are to be pipes and maybe some
potions of amber fluid, and possibly other
things.
Anyway, the prime object is to have
things work out p easantly.
As many persons have not met these
talented gentlemen off the stage, and do
not tnow what they look like in ordinary ;
attire, ther9 is expected to be a i>retty '
good attendance at the club. Other talent j
will be there, too, and what with music, j
story and other features ol entertainment, j
improvised as may happen, things will j
probably go smoothly enough. Tne Press '
Club has not given a smoker for some j
time. Orse was due', and De Wolf Hopper '
and Mr. O'Sullivan will be made at home.
The delegates elected to attend the In- '
ternational League of Press Clubs will be I
invited to be present to exchange views In j
reference to measures calculated lo im- |
prove the newspaper profession. There )s
mncb interest in tbf club at the present !
time because of the efforts o the members '
to make it one of the most influential |
oreanizations in the country.
These informal meetings of the Press
MISS E. M. GAY, the Friend of Dumb Animals.
Club, such as the one to be held this even
ing, have been found to bring out the full
â  pirit of fellowship that true Bohemianism
develops. It has been the testimony of
visiting celebrities in literature, art and
the drama that nothine has exceeded the
heartiness of the welcome that has been
extended tnem by the PreÂ« 3 Club.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAT 8, 1897.
MERCY FOR THE
DUMB ANIMALS
Initial Steps for the Organ
ization of Humane
Societies.
Review of Work in the Field
Performed by Miss E. M.
Gay of San Jo:e.
Charles L. Barrington Elected Presi
dent of the State Societyâ Other
Officers Chosen.
Initial steps for the organization of the
Slate Humane Educational Society were
taken yesterday afternoon at a meeting
held in the Y. M. C. A. building The
chief organizer in the work of extending
mercy to dumb animals is Miss Â£. M.
Gay of San Jose. She became so deeply
Interested in the subject that she visited
many counties of the State at her own
expense, and wherever she went preached
the gospel of compassion for overworked
and neglected beast"? of burden. Her ob
servation soon convinced her that cruelty
to animals could not be checked by indi
vidual effort, but that organization would
be required to effect the good purpose.
Tho meeting yesterday was called to
order by Professor S. S. Sturges. Judge
D. E. Alexander was called to the chair.
The chairman asked Miss Gay to outline
the purposes of the organization. Bhe
said that a humane society should be
formed in every county in the State
where a society for the prevention of cru
ehy to animals did not exist, and that in
every county there should be organized
a Humane Educational Society â a branch
of the general or parental organization in
San Franci'Co. 'Ihrough the local soci
eties Bands of Mercy should be formed
and children of the schooiS taught com
passion for dumb animals.
At the close of Miss (iay'a remarks a
suggestion was made that a statement of
the society's proposed work should be
printed, and the organization deferred
until a thorough canvass had been made
to obtain members.
Her. Dr. Fredrich, a Presbyterian divine,
fancied that immediate organization was
Letter than delay. He hoped that officers
would be at once elected. After further
discussion it was decided to eiect officers.
Mrs. William Deano nominated forr>res>
dent of the society Charles L. Barrington,
president of the Board ot Education. Mr.
Barrington was elected without opposi
tion on the assurance th:it he would serve
and .would also endeavor to enlist the
service of the school in the humane cause.
Mrs. Deane assured the meeting thai Mr.
Barrington was the man for the place.
Other officers as foJows were chosen:.

ander; secretary, Mrs. Kate "Waters;

Considerable interest was taken in the

York, after which Murray Hill has been
named. Her maiden name was Mur

early settlers of the Knickerbocker City,
whose wealth and influence in that place
in the early days did much to advance the
queen city of the Atlantic in its infantile
struggles for wealth and prominence.
Her forefathers showed their patriotism
to the cause for which Washington and
Lincoln fought. This spirit ol patriotism
lost none of its enthusiasm in their pos
terity, as a brother of the deceased lady
lost his life in the late struggle for. the
Union, and she herself was an active co
laborer in the iank3 of the Woman's Re

HIS SPELL IS BROKEN.
Dr. J. M. Thornton Separated
From His Lately Hyp
notized Bride.
A Revolver Dissipated the Entbra.
ment and a Box of Candy Sealed
the Disunion.
Dr. J. M. Thornton, the alleged hyp
notic doctor, has been forced to admit
that his power over his bride of a few days
is over. The speil is broken, the magic
cord of sympathy is snapped.
The happy couple quarreled over their
respective mediumistic powers, and to
test her -independence Mrs. 7 Thornton
withdrew to the paternal roof-tree.
Thither, attended by a police officer, Dr.
Thornton wended last night, and. rapping
at the door, raised a deep basso voice to
order his better haif to return to his side.
But, accordincr to his woeful tale, it was
the barrel of an ugly looking six-shooter
instead of the face of his bride which met
his imperious gaze.
Temporarily withdrawing his forces,
after the manner of the Greeks from Phar
salo?, the doctor and his bodyguard con
sulted, ultimately agreeing upon a new
plan of campaign. The bereaved husband
abandoned his hypnotic voice and resorted
to the old old lure of Eden. The offer of
a box of candy secured the immediate
appearance of Mrs. Thornton, and it was
then the doctor said be had his triumph.
"The die' is â  cast," he exclaimed with a
magnificent gesture. "Keep your candy,
girl, and remain with your father as long
as you please."
The forces then withdrew in good order,
both sides victorious according to the war
correspondents. " But then the doctor says
the spefUs broken, and he ought to know.

HELPED TO SAVE
HIS COUNTRY
Helen Gardener's Father
Led Troops Through
Virginia.
Freed His Slaves Before the War
and Becam? an Exile
Voluntarily.
Reading by the Authoress of a Touch
ing Story of the War for
the Unioa.
There was just what would be called a
light attendance in Golden Gate Hall last
night to hear Mrs. Helen Gardener lecture
on "Lincoln in me Civil War." Instead
ol a lecture it was a reading, but it was
just as well enjoyed by tne ladies who
came there to see the authoress and hear
her voice. It was unmistakably a
Woman's Congress gathering.
Such gatherings as these, up to about
fifteen or twenty years ago, were com
posed of ancient ascetic and acetic women,
rarely married and never moihprs, hearsed
in somber black gowns with bonnets des
titute of coloror ornament; malephobiacs
who shrieked their contempt alike for the
virtues of domesticity and tne graces of
femininity.
Such wa3 the Old "Woman, clamoring
for rights sucerior to those accorded by
society to her brothers, but last night
showed the New Woman of the new era
in her glory and invested with all the
fascinations of her sex. Tne New Woman
does not look down upon th.it brilliant bit
uf artistic frivoliy, the Easter bonnet,
save when it lies in her palm on the day
of purchase, and last night it bloomed
and blushed and nodded in all the cheer
in 1 ? beauty of the gladsome spring.
But the New Woman stands ui> for the
rights which have been denied her in the
present scheme of civilization, and insists
that in intellect and in executive ability
she is nt least the equal of man.
The New Woman "still has the habit of
coming in late, and when 8 o'clock came
not twenty were present, but a quarter of
an hour later there was quite a respectable
showing. Then Mrs. Jo F. Swifi aa
vanced to tbe front of ihe platform and
coldly announced that the Mayor had been
expected to attend and introduce Mrs.
Gardener to the people, but that a3 the
time had passed they would not wait any
longer.
Mrs. Gardener, in cream-colored some
thing and lace, was greeted with kind ap
piause. Instead of a lecture she pave a
reading, with slavery and the Civil War
as the motive of the selection, Aoraham
Lincoln and a patriotic parson being the
pivotal characters.
The reading was from one of Mrc Gar
dener's own worts, believed to be a work
of fiction, but it turned out that the char
acters were real persons and that the story
was from life. Griffith Davenport, a min
ister of the Gospel by choice and slave
owner by inheritance, by marriage and
against his choice, leaves Vrginia after a
long struggle with himself and turns his
slaves free on the hospitable soil of the
North.
Shortly after the terrible disasters of
Balls Bluff and Bull Run Davenport was
asked by Governor Oliver P. Morton of
Indiana and President Lincoln to lead the
Northern soldiers through tb* rugged and
almost unknown defiles of Western Vir
ginia. What the persuasive powers of
Governor Morton had failed to accomplish
was effected by the moving appeal of the
President.
The story is welt told and abounds in
pathetic touches, which were read very
well by tbe authoress, bat the flashes here
and there of cower occurring in the inter
view between the I'resident and the par
son were too bold and rugged for the
tenderness and delicacy of the speaker's
styie.
Captain Day of the United Slates army
made a few remarks on the subject of the
story.
New interest was added to the reading
by the announcement made by the hus
band of Mrs. Gardener that Griffith Dav
enport, the hero of the story, was Mrs.
Gardener's own father and that the story
was a true one.
Mrs. Gardener will lecture in the same
place this evening, under tbe auspices of
the Women's Congress. Her subject will
be "Sex in Brain."
It is said tbat women are not permitted
to bÂ» photosraplied in China.
NEW TO-DAT.
KIDNEY TROUBLES
Oared by Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound,
Also Backache*
I cannot speak too highly of Mrs.
Pinkham's Medicine, for it has done so
much for me. I have been a great suf-
ferer from Kidney trouble, pains in
muscles, joints, back and shoulders;
feet would swell. I also had womb
troubles and leucorrhoea. After using
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and Blood Purifier and Liver
Pills, I felt like a new woman. My
kidneys are now in perfect condition,
and all my other troubles are cured. â
Mrs. Maggie Potts, 324 KauffmanSt.,
Philadelphia, Pa.
Backache.
My system was entirely run down,
and I suffered with terrible backache
in the small of my back and could
hardly stand upright. I was more
tired in the morning than on retiring
at night. I had no appetite. Since
taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, I have gained fifteen pounds,
and I look better than I ever looked
before. I shall recommend it to all
my friends, as it certainly is a wonder-
ful medicine. â Mrs. E. P. Morton, 1043
Hopkins St., Cincinnati, Ohio.
Kidney Trouble.
Before taking Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, I had suffered
many years with kidney trouble. The
pains in my back and shoulders were
terrible. My menstruation became ir-
regular, and I was troubled with leu-
corrhoea. I was growing very weak. I
had been to many physicians but re-
ceived no benefit. I began the use of
Mrs. Pinkham's medicine, and the first
bottle relieved the pain in my back
and regulated the menses. It is the
besf kind of medicine that I have ever
taken, for it relieved the pain so quickly
and cured the disease. â Mrs. Lillian
Cbifpen, Box 77, St. Andrews Bay, Fla.

The Nashville Exposition has the credit

As Prince Constantino of Greece is re

Weyler's report that he has pacified

In the prevailing hope of prosperity all

The new tariff proposes to take chicle off

At the recent dedication of a church for

In all the discussions of the outflow of \
gold there is not one evidence given of
any feeling of alarm, and when this is
contrasted with the fear which prevailed
over the goid exports when the Democrats
ware in power, it will be seen that the '
McKinley administration has gone a long i
way toward bringing back prosperity by ;
assuring public confidence in the financial
situation.
A correspondent of tiie New York Times
in reviewing tie industrial conditions of
the Southern States notes there has been
a large decrease in the number of hired
laborers in the country and a large in

step, and when the tenants become own

from the old to the new South will have
been fully accomplished.
A number of genial citizens of New

when they were informed that unuer the

among themselves in quantities of less
than five gallons without taking out a
license, under penalty of being sent to
jail. The citizens have the cask still on
hand, and are pondering whether to or
ganize us a liquor company and take out a
license or venture upon the experiment of
taking five gallons at a drink and go on
With the picnic.
DEMOCRATIC TACTICS.
From the vote of the Democrats in the House of Representatives on a resolution
providing that the House shall meet only on Mondays and Thursdays until further
action, it is evident Mr. Baiiey and his friends have decided to change the policy they
adopted at the beginning of the session and hereafter will oppose the Republican plan
of undertaking no legislation until after the tariff has been enacted.
In voting against the resolution the Democrats followed the lea^. of Jerry Simpson.
They allied themselves with the Populists and added the full strength of their vote to
the agitators who have been attempting for weeks past to disturb the proceedings of
the House, and who have tried by every means in their power to cast odium upon the
Speaker. It was a complete surrender of Bailey and his conservatives to the sockioss
j statesman of Kansas and a triumph of the wild colts over the attempt to establish
disciuline in the party.
The new alliance and the new policy are not matters of much concern, since the
combined forces will not be sufficient to materially affect legislation. In the vote on
the resolutions providing for meetings only twice a week the combined opposition had
but 83 votes against 10L It formed a considerable minority, but one which will not
be strong enough to prevent the carrying out of the policy of the majority under the
direction of so able and competent a leader as Speaker Reed. The only significance of
the vote, therefore, is that it makes clear the fact that tbe Democrats of the House of
Representatives will hereafter be led by radicals instead of conservatives, and tliat it
has not within itself sufficient wisdom or discipline to maintain the course which it
undertook at the beginning of tbe session.
It is possibla that this change of tactics on the part of the Dumocrats of the House
may imply a similar change on tbe part of those in the Senate. If this should be so
we niay look for a lo;ig wrangle over the tariff bill instead of the prompt and rational
legislation which the country hoped for and which at one time seemed well assured.
Ii is another warning that we cannot expect good service from Democracy even in
opposition. The capacity for blundering upon which General Grant remarked
has not diminished since his time. The only consolation is that obstructive
tactics on the part of the Democrats now, whiie they may injure the country much by
delaying ihe bill and the settlement of the tariff question, will be a benefit later on by
convincing the people of the folly of trusting National Democracy in any capacity
whatever.
GETTING THE FACTS.
The Examiner of yesterday made an ac
knowledgment of the superiority of our
news service over its own with such frank
ness, candor and completeness as to merit
recognition. On the previous day both
The Call and the Examiner contained
reports of the Huntington banquet, but
they differed widely in every respect, and
the Examiner of yesterday, feeling called
upon to deliver editorial comment upon
the affair, lound itself in a position where
it hail to decide whethpr its own account
or that in The Call was the true one.
The editorial writers attested the ex
cellence of their judgment by ignoring
the Examiner news report as a worthless
fake and basing the whole of their criti
cism upon the account given by The Call.
It is scarcely necessary for us to say the
editorial department of the Examiner acted
wisely in accepting the report of 1 he Call
as being correct. It is not often, however,
that even wisdom leads a newspaper to so
openly acknowledge and confess the
worthiessness of its news service and the
utter unreliability of everything which it
reports as a fact, it is the rarity of such
open confessions on the part of sensa
tional journals that gives importance to
this action of our contemporary and lends
us to accord it more than ordinary recog
nition.
We trust nobody will regard this notice
of the acknowledgment of the superiority
of our news service as vain boasiing on
our part or as having in it any suggestion
of sarcasm. It Is meant only as a kindly
acknowledgment the candorof the man
agers of the Examiner in admitting that
wlierj they desire to know the truth they
read The Call. Their own clever writer!
are not sent out to gather news, but are
allowed to sit at their desks and write out
"in meditation fancy free" dispatches
from the Emperor of China, interviews
with a Chinese dignitary, locating him in
San Francisco when he happens to be in
Havana, and giving accounts of each
local events as the Huntington banquet
without learning the facts.
To people who reai newspapers, not for
idie amusement, but for the purpose of
knowing what is going on in the world,
the moral of this confession on the part of
the Examiner ia too plain lo require
stating. Tnnse who wish to learn the
facts and to acquire an accurate knowl
edge of current events must read The
Call. The editors of the Examiner are
aware of this and never venture to com
ment, criticize or pronounce judgment on
anything going on either at home or
abroad until they have first thrown their
own fake paper in the wastebask6t and
read The Call, in order 10 acquaint them
selves with the truth.
THE DUOHESS D'ALENCON.
It is oneof tbe consolationsof humanity
that whenever a ereat disaster falls upon
any considerable number of men and
women, there is always displayed by
some among tbe number of the victims a
heroism of soul which attests the gran
deur of mankind even amid the greatest
trials, ana proves the .saying of General
Robert E. Lee, "Human virtue can al
ways be equal to human calamity."
In the dread disaster which befell the
! cay and fashionable throne at the charity
bazaar in Paris, this evidence of nobility
of soul nml true grandeur of sentiment
wÂ»s shown by the Duchess d'Alencon.
i When the flames broke forth and the shouts
lof "fire" were heard, one of the ladies stand
â  ing near the Duchess turned to her with
j the cry: "Let us go, Madame. Come
I immediately !" The Duchess, however,
! did not move, but answered the appeal
â  with the calmness of a grande dame, "Let
| the visitors go first." It was a simple
i saying, but under the appalling circum
stances it was sublime.
It is evident the Duchess was one
! of those rare women whom we lite to iru
| ngrine as the type of genuine aristocracy.
I A true granda dame, who understood to
1 the fullest extent tho meaning of the
phrase "Noblesse oblige," and who lived
|up to it, her courtesy was not a mere
1 matter of conventional manners. It wa
\ an outcome of the instincts of a noble na
i tu:e, finely bred and finely accomp.ished.
It was an aspiration of the soul as well as
the practice of a habit, and bespoke a
! woman who in every respect was well
| worihy to wear a coronet and to rank
I among the aristocracy of a great nation.
"Let the visitors go first." These words,
| uttered amid a panic-stricken crowd in a
! builoing wrapped in names and scarcely
I heard among the shrieks of despair, de
; serve to be remembered among those
! immortal phrases which bear to men and
i women from generation to generation the
I evidences of the truth of the saying of the
| Psalmist: "For tbou bast made him a
little lower than the aneels, and hast
j crowned him with glory and honor." The
I glory is that man has been ere 'ted with a
soul superior to every possible disaster
that may befall him, and the honor is that
even his mortal body has tbe courage to
show forth the nature of his soul and act
in accordance with its high requirements.
Tbe horror of the great calamity at
! Paris will sooner or Inter pas" away, but
| it is not likely that the world will ever
I forget tbe heroism of this woman who
stood aside to let the visitors co first from
the flaming building. The world has now
another heroine to rank among those
whom it honors; and wherever and when
ever tbe tale of this story shall be told
there wiil not fall to be words of praise
and honor to the true grande dame, the
noblewoman, tbe Duchess d'Alencon.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 8, 1897.
SALISBUEY'S SPEECH.
The address of Lord Salisbury ai the an
nual meeting of the Primrose League at
Albert Hall, in London, mu.-t have
forcibly recalled to the laree audience
which assembled in that vast, building the
loss which England sustained by the
death of Benjamin Disraeli, in honor of
whose immory the Primrose League was
formed. No man can say wliai manner
of speech Disraeli wouid have made at
such a crisis in the affairs of England and
of Europe as the war In the Levant has
raised, but every man can be certain it
would have been widely different in tone
and sentiment from that of the noble
Lord who has succeeded him in ollice
without filling his place in the service of
his country.
Disraeli always had a definite policy for
England and was always able to express
it in language which, while it excited to
fiercer neat the opposition of iiis iocs,
never failed to carry hope and courage to
his friends. A speech from him on such
an occasion as this wouid have roused all
England and had a potent influence
throughout Europe. Salisbury's address,
however, was hardly more than such as
might have been delivered at a tea party
by a man who was talking of something
of which he knew little and on which he
lias not made up his mind one way or
another.
To a world waiting to know what is to
be done for the solution of the dangerous
problem in the Levant, Lord Salisbury
could offer nothing but the vaguest ex
pressions of a uope that all would go well.
"Tnere has been," he Baid, "great fear
that any outbreak in the southeast of
Europe might lead to a general blaze, but
it is hoped the danger is past, and that we
may look calmly on the larger interests
involved." He had no reason to furnish
as a bams on which this hope is to rest,
and could only say the proofs of strength
given by the Turkish Government may
lead ta an improvement in t c empire or
it maybe the empire will collapse.
This was* all which the Prime Minister
of England had to say to ttie people wait
ing with eager expectancy to Know what
part England is to play in the mighty
drama now going on in the Levant. It
vras the speech of a temporizer, a time
server, and a waiter on events lather than
of a leader of a great people and of a
statesman having a policy which he re
garded as best for the interests of the em
pire, and wh.ch he was resolved to carry
out in the face of any and all obstacles.
It was not necessary for Lord Salisbury
to tell us the Ottoman empire may im
prove or that it may collapse. That much
was very well known belore. What was
expected from a man in Salisbury's posi
tion was a definite statement of what
England will do to maintain justice in the
Levant, and enforce reforms upon the
Sultan. Truly the Primrose Leacue has
ample reason to commemorate Benjamin
Disraeli and to mourn his death.

Queen Victoria has astonished the visitors at

driving rains, which keep almost every one

the Scot on the box, apparently enjoying the
severe temperature.
CLOUDS AS WEAPONS OF WAR.
It is coolly proposed by SL P. Rtehm, says
Geographic, to make "war in the clouds," an
eminently Olympian proposition. The propo
sition is explained as follows: "It is well
known that the vapors of ammonia, when
they encounter those of hydrochloric acid,
form ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac),
which appears as a thick cioud of small par
ticles. It has occurred to M. Riehm to utilize
this property in a new engine of war. He inÂ»
closes the acid and ammonia in separate re*
cepiacles, in a (.hell ; when the shell bursts the
mixture generates clouds hat envelop the
enemy ana obscure his vision. This is pur
posely complementary to the smokeless pow
der now generally used; but how many of
these projectiles would bJ iiecrssaiy to en
velop an army corpb in smoke? Tne author
does not tell us. aird it is doubtful if he will
find sufficiently trusting amateurs to put his
invention into practice on a large scale.

12, 1770. The faded and stained old newsp per contains the first news account of the Boston
massacre that was printed by any local paper. This adds iv a vast measure to the value of the
relic, which under any circumstances would bÂ» exceedingly interesting for Its great age alone
and es a means of comparing modern journalism with the journalism of the fathers.
S ime years ago a lot of fake copies of this historic newspaper were printed. They were
creased and rubbed with stains in order to give them an appearance corresponding with the
false date which they bore. Then they were offered to the public as original copies of the
famous paper and its historic news story. And some of them were sold uuder this misrepre
sentation, the purchasers realizing the great value of them without perceiving their un
genuineness.
But under a close inspection these imitations turn out to be very Door things after all â
pitiable mockeries of the venerable maUerpieces of news. There are but two of the origi nil
copies (printed on March 12, 1770) left, so far as is known. The copy wuich The Call wil. re
produce to-morrow has b-;en on exhibition in the Smithsonian institution, to which it was tem
porarily loaned by Mr. Randlett of Alameda, in whose family the relic has been au heirloom
for over a hundred years.
There will also be a story of the strangest lynching in the history of California. The scene
is laid in Old Monterey, and the actors in the tragedy are well knownâ several of them still
living. This story will come as a revelation to many old timers.
Possibly you never knew that deaf-mutes could hold a debate. But they can. In fact, a
number of them did so only a few days ago, and the proceedings were amazing and interesting.
This will be graphically described by Muriel Bailey in The Sunday Call.
"The March of the Stars" is the title of the latest musical composition produced in San
Francisco. The author is Miss Gertrude Spellan and several eminent critics have pronounced
her work to be of a high order of merit. The original score will be reproduced in to-morrow's
Call.
"The Wonderful Flight of a Seagull" is the subject of a bright article sure to interest all.
It is graphically written and furnishes a great deal of valuable information.
Florence Percy Matbeson paid a visit to little Baby Lewis in her home this week. Of
course the visitor said much to interest and please her and will toll all about it in to-morrow's
Call.
De Wolf Hopper was caught returning from a foray on the book stands. What he cap
tured and what he did with his victims will be the subject of a bright article in The Sunday
Call.
John Bonner makes another plea for the State University. This will appear in The
Sunday Call.
The latest discovery in regard to the habits of ants will be mado public for the first time
to-morrow.
Besides the articles already mentioned, Adeline Knapp's "Field Vistas" will appear
brighter than ever. There will be a comparison of ancient and modern Greece, and also a
number of other highly interesting articles.
Then, of course, there will be the Children's page. The little ones know how muaa
pleasure they get out of it, and will be watching for it. Don't disappoint them, ior it will be
exceptionally good.
To sum up, The Sunday Call will be an ideal newspaper. Full of bright features and all
the news of the world that is fit to print.
GRANT AND THE WAR CORRESPONDENTS.
On the eighteenth page of The Call of Sunday, May 2, 1897. was published a military
order from General Grant to General Snerman dated August 8, ISK2, directi-.g the latter to
arrest the Memphis correspondent of the Chicago Times and send him to the Alton military
prison for confinement until the close of the war unless sooner discharged by competent
authority. It seems that Captain Richard P. Thomas, who found the original order among
some waste papers at Memphis soon after, and has had it in his possession ever since, never
knew the identity of the correspondent nor whether he was ever discovered or arrested.
I am perhaps the only person now living who can supply the missing Units of that record.
The correspondent was a Mr. Isham, a brother to the wife of Wilbur F. Storey, the great editor
of the Times. Isham had been an editorial writer on the paper and was sent to the field ag a
war correspondent soon after the battle of Shiloh. At the time of his arrest (for he was
promptly arrested and imprisoned pursuant to that order) he was considered the most
brilliant correspondent in that department. The Times had an immense circulation in the
armies of the Southwest, was very sensational in character and delighted in ieeing how near It
could approach the line of actual disloyalty without incurring its penalty. Mr. I-ham had
been cautioned once or twice before this by General Grant against giving such free range to
his fancy and predicting future movements of the Union troops. His last offense was pub
lishing a "cock and bull" story about some Confederate ironclads at Pensacola, which he
claimed to have received by "grapevine" telegraph throuzh the Southern Confederacy.
About the middle of October, 1802, 1 received a telegram at my home in Milwaukee from
Storey & Worden, proprieiors of the Times, asking lr I could go to the Army of the Tennessee
for them. I replied that I could, and received a second dispatch requesting me to come to
Chicago by the first train. On arriving at the office I was informed that the object of my trip
would be to secure Mr. Isham's release, if possible. I had never seen either Storey or Worden
till then, had no acquaintance with General Grant ot any member of his staff, and at first
objected to the undertaking. The interview ended, however, in my starting at once as a
duly accredited correspondent of the Times to avoid betraying the chief object I had in view-
Before leaving Chicago Messrs. Storey <fc Worden had supplied me with scores of letters
from influential men of the city and .State asking for Isham's release from prison. These I
â  never delivered. I was convinced that General Grant would never read them, and suspected
; that if he was inclined to open the prison door to Isham he would greatly prefer doing so
j without theappearance of outside pressure or Interference. At the first suitable opportunity
I brought the matter to General Grant's attention, and assured him that Mr. Isham's relatives
land friends had no disposition to question the rightfulness of his arrest, but now requested
' his release on the grounds that he had been sufficiently punished and that his family was
j actually dependent on others for daily food, etc. An order for his release was sent off the
I tame day. I have not before me the precise date of his incarceration or release, but
! know that he was in that famous penal institution between three and four months. He was
lost a few years afterward in * great steamboat accident on Lake Michigan.
This was the beginning of a personal intimacy between Geueral Grant and staff and my
self, which scarcely had a day's interruption till the end of the war. I soon changed from the
Times to the New York Herald, and literally rode with Grant from Vlcksbnrg to Appomattox;
was in the room when General Lee surrendered; went a little later on to North Caro.ina and
saw the surrender of General Johnston's army ; and have remained in close touch with such
of the "old" stuil" us survive from that time to this.
The correspondent who furnished you the copy of the order spoke of Grant's method
beintt au easy one to tilence objectors. This needs explanation. My field of experience and
observation was as wide as that of any person alive to-day. I know whereof I speak when I
say that Grant was by far tbe most liberal in allowing publication of news from his fields of
operation of any officer of note which the war produced. He stood on a higher plane from the
outset, and took tbe sensible ground that newspapers must send men of judgment and discre
tion to represent tnem, or suffer the consequences of having them expe.led from the army
All correspondents within hi* commands could say what they pleased nbojt completed opera!
ations â if truthful â but must not indulge in predictions concerning the future. He never
descended to press censorship, nor allowed any member of his staff to do so. Abundant
instancei ;n proof of these allegations ton id be given if necessary.

related to Odd Fellows since the passage of the
law permitting the admission cf such mem

DR. LI'S GHOST IS
NOW AT REST
The Estate of the Chinese
Physician Finally
Settled.
Litigation Which Threatened to
Last a Lifetime Â£uldenly
Conc.uded.
Attorneys J D. Sullivan and R. H.
Couatryman Have Adjusted
Their Differenc s.
Dr. Li Po Tai's ghost that has so lonj?
persisted in disturbing tlie equanimity of
court and counsel in Judge Coffey's de
partment of toe Superior Court has at
last been laid.
Whenever ;he attempted settlement of
the Chinese doctor's estate has come up
for hearing during the past four years
there has been a general controversy
among the lawyers that Judge Coffey has
had some difficulty in restraining within
the bounds of propriety.
Mr. Countryman, who represented
Henry Voornian, a creditor of the estate,
alleged that Public Administrator Freeze,
who succeeded the widow of Li Po Tai as
mar.Bgerof the property, has not exer
cised proper diligence i guarding the in
terests of the es;ate and particularly oOM
plainsthathe has not attempted to re
cover lroni .Mrs. Tai the moneys which
she is alleged to have expended unlaw
fully"on account of the funeral oi the de
cedent. It appears that the obsequies
were extended over several days, but tbe
court struck out all the items txcept those
pertaining 10 the first day, refused allow
ance for the gold ornaments alleged to
have been bestowed on the corpse and cut
down the total from more than $,'iCOO to
about $500.
The widow's bill is a curiosity in its
way, appearing as follows in the court's
record :
March 20. 1893â distributed to
mourners, $35 25; paper images, $15 -0; sun
dries,sll 50; Bilk clothing for corpse, $J35 50;

Mr. Sullivan responded that it was
within the knowledge of all concerned
that an attempt to recover any alleged
over-expendiiures by thfl widow would ba
fruitless, and he contended that every act
performed by Mr. Frees* had been for the
benefit of the estate, and thut ins accounts
were open for th < inspection of all who
wished to investigate their correctness.
In this position Attorney Keyes joined,
saying that Mr. Freese could not legally
have taken nny other course than thejona
he has followed.
Judge Coffey dismissed from considera
tion a suggestion maie by Mr. Country
man and his associate, Attorney W. M.
Wiiietts, that Mr. Freese had an under
standing with a son of Li Po Tai to share
with him the fees and compensations of
the administration. That question, the
court said, m ght be brought up in another
form if deemed worthy of further atten
tion.
The immediate matter before the court
was an application to sell a piece of prop
erty known aa 1014 Dupont street for
$9400, which Mr. Countryman said was
two years ago appraised at $17,500, and
which yields a revenue of $165 a month,
and which in about rive yeais would yield
a sum of money equal" to the purchase
price.
After considerable discussion Judge
Coffey remarked that he wo;ild like to
have the month of June devoted to the
consideration of cases submitted for the
pleasure of visiting Mr. Lafftrty at Ba u
Rafael and other important matters, >o
he consented !o pass the case for a short
time yesterday afternoon for the purpose
of allowing a conference of the opposing
forces with a view of allowing them to
settle their disputes.
At the conclusion of the conference it
was announced that an agreement ha. l
been readied. Mr. Voorman is to receive
the *<o-called Jackson-street property and
$(j~)0 in cash. In consideration of this ait
litigation in the Li Po Tai estate is to Le
abandoned, including five suits in the Su
perior Court of this City and County and
threfl appeals now pending in the State
Supreme Court.

The North American Tradine Com
pany's schooner General S:gl:n has not
bean beard from :or over forty days, and
fears are entertained for her safety. Tue
last time she was heard from s- s was in
the T.cinitv of Cape F.attery and in about
the same p. ace as the snip Samaria is sup
posed to have b?en. It was blowing a nar
ricane at the lime and ail hope for the
Samaria has &?en abandoned. Now
Messn. Liebes &. Co. are beginning to
fear for the S g:in. Vessels tuat ieft here
three weesi later than her have reached
their destination and reported all well.
The General Siglin left bÂ»re with pro-
Tii'.ons tor the vessels of the Nona Ameri
can Trading Company's Â»ealinÂ« fleet. Cap
tain Jerome Thomas was in command
and he carried a crew of six all told. E.
C Greenfield, agent ol the company at
Wood Island, and his wife and dau^aier
were passengers. If anything has hap
pened to the smart little schooner the
chances are tnat it occu-red when Â«he was
in company with the Samaria of! Fiat
terv.
The General Biglin was built at .Mar^h

the weii-known fea.inif schooner, Win

I
CITY'S SHORTAGE
WILL BE REDUCED
Officials Meet Tc-Day to
Discuss the Situ
ation.
Expert Wi'liams Repons on
the Funds in the
Treasury.
By Strict E::nomy thi Difficulty May
Bj Tided Ov r Until the N w
Fiscal Year.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors haÂ« taken bold of the threat
ened deficit in the municipal funds with a
will, and the indications are that the
situation wiil turn out to be fur leas dan
gerons than has been stated.
The committee has had Cyril Williams,
its expert, working on the Auditor's oooks
/or eevera days past, and held a meetine
yesterday to hear the results of his labors.
Auditor Broderick was present, and
when anxious inqniries were made by
merchants in attendance a? to the chaaces
ot their getting their money he remarked
that it seemed strange that they wern
alarmed, when they always seemed anx
iouÂ« to furnish supplies.
"The trouble lies in the fact," he said,
"that some officials cannot be induced to
keep within their appropriations."
It was intimated that if the salary de
mands for the last fiscal year were held
over until the new appropriation is made
the difficulty might be tided over. The
Auditor was asKed if he would stand in
on such a proposition.
"I am not eoinp to Â«ay what I will do,"
he replied, "but I am quite likely to pay
the salaries when they are due."
Clerk Kussell said that it was unfortu
nate tnat the City's credit shouid bs
turown into diirepute every year. He
thought that more taxes could be col
lected, and that as the June salar.es were
not due until July they should not be paid
until then.
Expert Williams' report was then read,
showing that the probable shortage will be
$100,000.
Tue aeficit in the Tsrious subdi visions of
the general fund aggregate $87,650, but
the estimated surplus in certain funds
was $49,400, making the d-ficieucy, by
reason of overdrafts, $38,250; but to thii
mu->t be added $30,000, denciÂ»ncy in the
collection of fees, and $32,000, deficiency
in tax collections, that would be applied
to the ponTa! fund, making a total deh
ciencv of$!00 000.
T c report also showed that there were
deficiencies in the general fund over
whicu the board has no control. The
County Clerk's appropriation, for instance,
wassloo.ooo. Under the on?-twelfth act the
Clerk coald spend $?333 33 a month, bu:
tne April salaries amounted to $10,730.
The deficiency on May 1 was $22,153. The
estimated deficiency on June 30 is
$27,000. The appropriation to pay court
orders was $15000 and the deficiency
amounted to $5t4S 20. The estimated de
ficiency on June 30 is $7500. Ttin money
is drawn directly on the treasury by or
ders of court and bas been disposed of to
date as follows: To the Boys' and Girls'
Aid Society $10,4^5, to Police Court re
porters $17 52S 85, to Superi r Court re
porters $15,394 35; total, $43 348 20.
Tne bo*rd appropriated $45,000 to pay
jury fees under the county government
act. Demands on thai fund for $44 793
have already been audited, and trie de
mands against it that have not yet been
audited amount to $1942 Â£0, and it is esti
mated that there will be a deficiency of
$5000. The Supervisor* nave no confol
over that fund, nor over the appropria
tion for election expenses, which is $15,000
short
Keferrinz to other accounts the expert
declared th-u tha County Hospital fund
would be $11,000 short, owing principally
to the cost of repairs, but the runnine ex
penses are $1000 a month in excess of the
appropriation. Williams further reported
that the Fire Depaitment was confident
of having a surplus of $6300, and that tbe
i Health Dera-tment expected to have a
; surplus of $'2HM.
Moreover, ibe fund for the payment Â»1
police salaries had a surplus of $.5000
i which, it was estimated. woj.-1 cover vie
increase in sa^arie* allowed by the last
â  Legislature, but as Dayment had been en
j joined and the mitter had cone io ths
! Supreme Court the credit was likely to re
main on hand at the end of ihe fiscal year.
In reference to the shortage in fees Wil
â¢ Lami said the new fee bill had reduced
the receipts of the Sheriff's and Recorder's
cilices one-hat*. It had been estimated
at the beginning of the fiscal year that the
fees wonld nmotint to $210 000, but the ci
', pert estimated tba tney would not
amount to more than %LB6 00ft The Police
; Court tines had also fallen off. Last rear
the revenue from this source waÂ« $31,542.
Up to May 1 of this year only $18,035 05
had been received.
In conclusion WiMinm* stated that from
. the dehciency of $100,000 in the general
i fund may be deducted the amount that
may be transferred from the police relief
i pens. on fund, in which there is a credit of
\ neariy $20 CO).
Mayor Phelan, who was present, and
the members of the committee at once
I saw tuat it would take earne3t and we!l
--; directed work" to stave eff a serious finan
: cial situation, and it was decided to call a
meeting this morning at 10:30 at the
rooms of the board to ta.k me matter
over and tind some way out of the
i tan git.
"That's the only way to doit," said the
Auditor, "cut down expenses and let out
â  all men who are not net a^y and actively
:at work and needed. I hare dispensed
I with two rr.en, ant will have to work my
! force overtime to keep up with the de
â¢ mandi of my office, and I think ail ghoaid
; do the same.
"I might suggest that if those most in
terested would induce the banks to take
: np tne salary warranis and nor prerent
â¢ them until the bestinnng of the next
fiscal year it would remove the pressure. "
After the meeting the tjup-rviÂ«ors con
! suited among themselves and decided to
: cut expenses in ali directions.
The contract for grading Alamo square
: may be postponed untiL the next fiscal
i year, makine a saving of $10,000, and with
I other savinai reduce ths deficit from
1 $30,000 to $50,000.
The Auditor intimated that if the board
and heads of departments would show 3
Pennine disposition to retrench he wotrd
do all in his power to see thit the City's
j credit was placed on a beter basis.

The yachting season is now at hand,
and the lovers of aqnatic sport are look
ing forward to many pleasant cruises on
the bay. The oarsmen have determined
not to be behind in the sporting swim,
and arrangements have already been
made for regattas wh;ch will be held in
the near future at El Campo and on the
Oakland estuary.
The wheelmen are ready to join in the
summer runs to the various points of in
terest In the country. They are also tak
ing an active interest in the Sunday races
which will be held at the Velodrome track.
Boxing clubs have announced their in
tention of giving entertainments this
month, which they expect will be largely
patronized.
Lovers of the shotgun and rifle will en
joy the pleasure of tn-ger-pulling to-mor
row. Coursing, baseball, basket-ball, ten

patronized.

The run of the Bay City Wheelmen to
La HonJa, scheduled for to-day and to
morrow by Captain Henry L. Day, has
been indefinitely postponed, as very lew
of the members cared to undertake such a
hard journey this early in the season; so
the members will go to the Velodome to
morrow afternoon instead. Mr. Wet
more's famous annual run toÃlitiiedala is
talked of for the near future, however.
The California Cycling Club will hereaf
ter be controlled by a directorate, recently

as follows:

We have to go away from home
to get the news. The American
Wheelman, "cycling authority" of New
York, in its issue of April 29, speak
ing of the failure (?) of the Sunday
racing movement in this State, says that
"the first attempt at a Sunday meet was
made last Sunday at Alameda, Cal.,
under the new jurisdiction, but the races
had to be given up, as the riders refused
to take part fearing suspension from the
L. A. W." Well, well. Now for the facts.
There is not even a tract in Alameda. No
meet was given under the new "jurisdic
tion" until May 2, at San Francisco. The
grand Btands were packed with people
and there were more entries than at any
meet ever given before in this City. It
was pronounced the most successful meet
ever held here. We're going to hold an
other one to-morrow. Mr. Potter's
"organ I ' should come west and brighten
up a bit.

clubhouse at 8:30 a. m., and the 9 o'clock
boat will be taken to Sausalito and the
train to San Anselmo. From there Camp
Taylor is but sixteen miles distant, and
this being one of the most beautiful runs
in the vicinity of this City and the road
being in good condition Captain Lewis ex
pects a large attendance, and be asKs that
the members invite their cycling friends
to participate, and a pleasant day's outing
is assured them.
The riding of the racing members at the
Velodrome last Sunday was most satisfac
tory, and with the extra week's training
that Ralph Robinson, Chcrles Goodwin
and D. M. Francis have had they are ex
pected to finish among the first in the
races that they are entered in to-morrow.
The entertainment committee will bold
a meeting on Tuesday evening and a night
will be set on which to hold the postponed
smoker and high jinks.
The San Jose members of the club,
under the leadership of Dan Maddox, came
up last Sunday to witnebs the races at the
Velodrome, and they all left highly pleased
with Sunday racing.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen will hare

THE PUGILISTS.
Men Who Are In Training for the
Near Future Battles Royal.
If the professional athletic clubs carry
out the programmes that have been ar
ranged, there will be a superabundance of
boxing this month. The Olympic Club,
which is not exactly a professional organ
ization, will give a professional boxing
carnival on the evening of the 18th inst.
Its star attraction will be a twenty-round
contest between Jeffries and Baker, but it
is extremely doubtful if the mill will last
more than ten rounds as the contestants
are big and powerful men who will not
iose much tmis in liddling or sparring for
openings. The second event on the Olym
pic card is a twenty-ronnd bout between
Gans and Leonard. Rilley and Sullivau
will open the entertainment with a ten
round contest.
Jeffries and Gans are in tplendid con
dition, but it is said by several people who
have seen Baker that the Eastern heavy
weight is very fleshy, and may not he in
prime condition to go a hard hstic race on
the evening of the mill. Doubtless Gans
and J-rffnes will sell strong favorites in
the poolrooms.
The California Athletic Club will enter
tain its friends on the evening of the
28th inst. The directors have matched
rrank Slaven and Smith, alias Smith the
Thunderbolt, tc box twenty rounds, and
as there aro numbers of the sport-loving
people in this City who are anxious to see
Siavin in battle, a large crowd is expected
in Woodward's Pavilion.
The Pacilic Club will also give an en
tertainment this month, but its card has
noi as yet been made out in full. The Na
tional Club was tninking oi holding the
Green and McKeever tight this month,
but in the face of all the other attractions
the officers of the club will doubtless pass
May and fix upon some early date in June
for this contest, wbien will assuredly be a
grand exhibition of fisticuffs between two
of the cleverest boxers in America.
The Fairmoum Athletic Club gave a
very interesting entertainment Wednes
day evening last in its handsome little
clubroom, Twenty - eighth and Church
streets. 'Ihe athletes who entertained the
spectators in bouts of boxing were T.
Murray and A. Sm:th, D. Sullivan and O.
Buhlinger, J. Kennedy and P. McGratb,
J. Kinney and C. Reno, "Spider" Kelly
and J. Sullivan, M. Callaghan and M. Ho
gan, J. Sullivan and J. Reilly, J. Leroux
and H. Hemme. The members were very
much pleased with the evening's athletic I
sport.
Peter Maher and Tom Sharkey are at
last booked to fight twenty rounds in New
York City on Juno 5. The papers say that
ti.e Irishman (meaning Maher, of course)
will have an easy game to win. As
Sharkey was born in Ireland it is diffi
cult to understand why he should be
termed the sailor and Maher the Irish
man, but then it makes but little differ
erence to the sporting public what they
are called so long as they put up a good
mill. Qood judges who have seen Maher
fight contend that if he cannot polish off
"the sailor lad" in five or six rounds
Sharkey will stand an excellent chance of
taking the long end of tho purse.
THE ANGLER.
Unhealthy Condition of the Trout
In San Andreas Lakeâ Late
Fly-Flshlng.
Anglers who fished Late P.larcitos last
Sunday say that the small trouc of that
lake are in fairly good order. Messrs.
Walker, Spencer, Cate, Dolliveaana Gibbs
returned with good baskets.
Anelers must remember that the Spring
Valley Water Company has instructed
its keepers not to allow any person to
camp on its property, consequently two
men who drove down to the lake last
Saturday expecting that they could camp
over night on the margin of the lake had
to harness up and return several miles
before they were outside the lines of the
company's property.
Frank Marcus and a friend filled their
baskets in less than one hour at San
Andreas Lake last Sunday. The fish are
in a horrible condition this year. Their
fins and gills are thickly covered with
parasites, and as an angler remarked a
few days ago when he was offered a few
San Andreas trout: "I would not give
them to my cat, therefore you must par
don me if I must refuse your kind offer
with all due respect, etc"
It was reported that the Fish Commis
sioners Had suggested to the Spring Val
ley Compsny not to open San Andreas
Lake until July 1, but on inquiry informa
tion to the contrary was gleaned.
Messrs. Vogelsang and Emeric have ad
vised the company to clean out the fishes
of San Andreas Lake, as they are in such
an unhealthy condition that they are un-

fit to be enten. The Commissioners would
be pleased to learn that the water com
pany had engaged prolessional fishermen
to net the lake in question of its steel
heads, which variety of trout belong to
the anadromous order of fishes that fre
quent tne coast streams only for the pur
pose of spawning during the winter
months. It is tho opinion of gentlemen
who have had many years' experience in
the study of fresh-water fishes that if the
water company's lakes were stocked with
Eastern trout and Loch Leren trout a
marked change for the better would be
noticed in a f<- v years hence.
Although the trout season opens this
year with very poor results to anglers it
is with pleasure that we can now state
that the outlook for good sport in June
and July is very good indeed. Corre
spondents have written to The Call that
the trout- fishing at the headwaters of the
big Sulphur CreeK, which stream empties
into the Russian River, near Cloverdsle,
has been excellent during the past few
days. Reports of a similar kind have
corns from Ukiah, near which town there
are several trout streams.
Â£ouider Creek has been fished with good
success last Wednesday and Thursday,
by Dr. Newhall, William Turner and
James Mmgrave.
Fishing on the Calaveras has been sin
gularly bad this year, but as the water is
very high anglers may not expect any
thing like good fly-fishing until June and
July.
An illustrated magazine named Western
Recreation, published in Victoria, B. C,
by C.jH. Gibson, gives a truly excellent
description of lake and stream fishing in
British Columbia, with illustrations.
This month's edition is replete with very
interesting articles on trout and salmon
fishing.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
Coming Events on the Home
Grounds and Echoes From
Abroad.
Notwithstanding past evidence to the
contrary the officers of the California
Club ins ist that they are able to put a
team into the field and will do so Sunday
week. This is good news and its verifica
tion will mean the carrying out of the
schedule as issued.
The Pacific Club have made arrange
ments to send an eleven to Penryn to
meet tho local team on Decoration day
and Sunday following.
The season has opened in England with
the Notts and Derbyshire colt events.
Owing to wet weather both games were
somewhat slow. !>>o big scores were made
and the Derby eleven took over an hour
and a half to make twenty-nine runs.
The Sussex Club has experienced a loss
in the resignation from its presidency of
the Earl of Sheffield, He has been suc
ceeded by the Duke of Norfolk.
T. Beaklave of Lower Lake, who paÂ«sed
through this city the other day en route
for England, reported that practice bad
commenced both in Burns Valley and
Lakeport. It is hoped that one of the as
sociated clubs will send a team up there
during the season.
The matches for to-morrow are: At
A'ameda, Pacifies vs. Alameda; at
Golden Gate, San Jose vs. Bohemians.
The latter announcement differs from the
schedule card, but is authorized.
A lengthy communication urging the
passing of a club law enforcing players to
sport their respective colors on the field
will receive my attention later.

THE OARSMEN.
Crews Have Gone Into Training for
the El Campo Regatta.
Now tbat a date has been agreed upon
for the El Campo regatta, and June 20 has
met with the approval of the rowing
clubs, the crews will commence training
at once.
Never before has such interest been
manifested in rowing circles as at the
present time.
At the meeting on Thursday evening
every club on the bay was represented by
two delegates, who promised in the name
of their clubs to enter men in every event.
In the junior barge race about eight
crews will enter; and with such crews as
the Olympics, Universities, Stocktons and
South Ends, this ought to be one of the
star events ol the day.
In the senior event the South Ends ana
the Stockton Giants will meet and settle
their old contention. The new senior
crew from the South Ends and a crew
from tne Ariels and Pioneers will also be
heard from in this event.
Perhaps the most interesting of the
single events will be the senior skiff race,
in which Frank Duplissea. William Mc-
CauÃland, Dr. Dennis and George Phelan
will come together and decide wuich is
best man.
In the junior skiff race ,about fifteen
ambitious South Enders would like to
represent their club, and it will be neces
sary to hold a try-out at some time in the
near fnture.
Among the gentlemen who appear at
the boathouse with the intention of car
rying away the laurels are Jim Foley,
George Fox, Frank Burke, Matt Breen,

THE YACHTSMEN.
The Pacific Yacht Club Will Hold
Its Opening Next Saturday.
The Encinals have decided to accept the
challenge of the Corinthians for a race for
the San Francisco perpetual challenge
cap. The Encinals have not agreed on
a boat to represent the club, but it will
probably be the Fawn. The regatta com
mittee of both clubs will meet some time
next week to decide on a day for the race
and to arrange the details. It is reported
that ex-Commodore Pew will sail the
Aeolus, and if this be true the members of
the Corinthian Yacht Club may rest as
sured that such an excellent sailor as the
ex-commodore is will get every bit of
speed out of the Aeolus that the boat pos
sesses. The race must be sailed between
the 20th of May and the 20tn of June.
Next Saturday the Pacific Yacht Club
will bold its opening. The committee
has been exceedingly active and every
thing points to the success of the affair.
The following dates have been sot aside
for cruising:
Saturday, May 15, opening day (full moon);

Tne Business Man's team of San Fran
cisco is still undefeated. This team has
now won nine games oat of nine in tne
present tournament.
The Rushers played the Business Men
at the San Francisco Young Men's Chris
tian Association gymnasium, but the Cy
clones played the Athens on the hard
floor across the bay.
As this tournament draws near its close
a great improvement can be noticed in
the work of all teams. The Rushers
gave the Business Men the hardest "rub"
of the season when these two teams
played together last Thursday evening.
The defense put up by the Rushers was
perfect. The Business Men could score
only after hard work, and their victory is
due to the splendid combination of all the
men on their team. Captain Anger proves
to be a man of quick judgment Good
rich can catch tae ball on the fly mid
knows how to bring it saf *lv home. Wil
son and Bernhard are a splendid couple,
and Titus held the fort in the thickest
battle. Batzer and H. G. Ward piay at
guard and very seldom allow an enemy to
try for goal.
The score at the close of the second half
of last Thursday's game was 20 to 4 in fa
vor of the Business Man.

Sensational Contest Filed in
the Probate Court
Yesterday.
Krs. Mitchell Seeks to Enforce
the Legal Rights of Her
Offspring.
S.cret Romance in the Life of a Weil-
Known Pioneer Eusiness Maa
of San Francisco
. Another sensational probate contest is
promised in the settlement of the estate
of Martin Kedon, deceased. The case
present- just such a romantic development
of affair* as wo.*id scarcely be possible in
any country except California under the
peculiar conditions that obtained in the
earlier and more informal days of the
City's history.
The matter waÂ« brought up formally in
judge Coffey's court yesterday on the ap
j -.i-ation of Attorney P. J. Wogan to
Lave Mrs. T. A. Mitchell appointed guar
dian of her 14-year-old son Frank, in or
cier that she might enforce his claim to a
child's share of the Kedon estate, which is
taid to be worth not less than $90,000.
Although .h!> iuovo was a surprise to
tie court it was no: unexpected so far as
;tie other heirs are concerned who have
known of the iad's claim to kinship
conntofhis acknowledged parentage,
as the decedent could make such
acKnowi^ii^ment.
Sirs. Mitchell is tae widow of T. A.
.Mitcneii. who was chiei deputy for Sandy
Austin when trm enterprising gentleman
T\as Tax Collector of this City and County.
Mr. Mitcaolidiedabo-.it twenty years ago
and Mr>. Mitchell established a boardine
bouse, in order to support herself and her
two chilJr^n.
Martin Kedon, known as a prosperous
merchant, was one o: the boarders at Mrs.
Mitchell's house. He was establisnea
t: ere with hi* tnreechiidre.i and held him
self out to Mrs. Mitchell at;d the rest of the
world as a widower, alleging that his wife
was dfiid. Kedon and h:s children care
zuarded as a family secret the fact that
Mrs. Kepon, the wife and mother, was an
inmate of an insane asylum, to which she
v.as co mm it ted in 1868, and as all mention
of the adjudication ol insanity had been
from publication in the news
n there was no knowledge m the
community touching the insanity of Mrs.
Kedon.
Soon after Kedon moved into Mrs.
Mitchell's hou?e he began to show her
marked attention, and finally propns'd
marriage. She knew nothing of the exist
ence of his wife and promised to marry
Mm. Ihen arose some dirhculties whicn
*ie told her were insufferable on account
of their difference in religious belief, and
which lie assured her would preclude the I . r
marriage in the usual wav by a ceremony
in the church. He thereiore suggested
t:iai they be married by contract, and
finally pursuaded her that as the contract
l.an had been heid legal and sufficient in
other cases, it would be good enough for
t;.em.
When Mrs. Mitchell gave up her board
ing-i.' ::-e they ail moved to a privale
reside-ce on Mission street, where the
b >v James was born.
Keaon's children were by this time old
enough to understand the situation, and a
revelation of the true state of iacts was
hsd to all parties in interest. Mrs.
Mitchell, who is a woman of high charac
ter, at once separated from Kedon, and
tfaoueh she had been made to suffer by the
duplicity of the man >he had regarded as
her husband, she made no public demon
stration against him.
In the meantime youne Frank grew to
lusty boyhoo'l, and was constantly kept
in mind by his father. Martin Kedon, who
provided for his wants carefully from the
day of his birth. Frank was sent to school,
and his tuition was paid for openly br
K?don, and two years ago the boy was
taken into Kedon's store a= a clerk under
the name of Thomas Smith, though Ke
don revealed to the boy their true relations,
and told him tiiat he had as much light
there as anybody. The other employes
about the establishment had a clear un
derstanding of the lad's status
For some time Mrs. Mitchell has been
consider. 112: the advisability of presenting
her son's claims for a portion of the Ke
don estate. Her own children urged ncr
not to do so. but she finally decided that
she must do her duty to the offspring of
Mr. Kedon and herself regardless of what
tni -ht be said by the public.
The insane Mrs. Kedon is 3tiil living
and is still an inmate of the State Insane
m. Under the .aw she is entitled to
(60,000 or two-thirds of the properly,
which will leave $30,000 10 be divided
among the cbi.dren. 1; Frank is declared
a legal heir he will bo awarded a quarter
of the last-named amount
Tho question of lecitimization will
present some points not bicutrto decided
in this .State. It was thought that nearly
every phase of 'he matter of declaring
legitimate children born out of wedlock
had been presented in the cases of JeÂ»Â«up.

A Weak IVian
A man who has wasted the power of
youth by excesses and fast living is only
half a man. To him the greatest pleasures
are only pastimes; he enjoys nothing, be-
cause his delicate senses are stunted and
all his vital powers weafc. Are you one of
them ? Go to the spring of lifeâ electricity; \
drink to your heart's satisfaction, saturate
your body with its vitalizing powers. It
will restore your manhood. It is life, and
will renew wliat you have lost.

MONEY AND DIAMOND GONE.
An Kastcrn Young Woman Want* the
ArTs! of Uuf.is Vassar
Miis Maude Dugjtan, a Cashing blonde,
appealed to Judge Low yesterday for the
arrest of Rutus Vassar on a charge of em
bezzlement.
Tue young woman claims Chicago as
her home, and she is tun here on a visit,
stopping at the Ramona Hotel on Ellis
street.
Some time ago, when her father sent
her $I*o witli which to return home, she
met young Vassar, a descendant of the
Vassars of college fame, who is stopping
tit the Baldwin Hotel.
They attended the races quite frequently
and were otherwise much in each other's
company. The acquaintanceship was so
strone ;nat Vassar waa made her banker
with her Fall consent.
.Now Ifise Duggan mourns her money
and a $200 diamond ring which she gave
Vassar to have fixed at fchreve's.

For a Dilatory Sort of Ride

Mirth Tripped Over tin Wire at OJds

the Second F.ultlessly.
The racing game generally does assume
a peculiar phase as the and of the sa&son
approaches and the present one atEmery
vill presents no exception. Jockey Eddie
Jones, who hitherto has always borne a
eood reputation, was suspended yesterday
for a ticklish sort of ride he furnished
aboard Dan Honig's sprinter, Zaniar 11.
The cause of all the upheaval was the
tourtn race on the card, a five-furlong
sprint, wiih some of the fastest ones quar
tered on the track entered. Tea Rose de
clined the issue, as her stable people were
afraid of Quicksilver, so it was stated.
Zamar with 107 pounds up was made an
even-money choice, but as the demand
was not adequate to the supply receded to
2 to 1 at post time.
Three and four to one was always ob
tainable against Quicksilver. Yemen,
wiih 122 pounds up, ridden bjr H. Shields,
was the desired of aii, being hammered
: down from V% and 4tol to 11 to 5. En
j taring the Â»7retch behind Quicksilver
! Shields on Yemen did not worry, but took
I his time and eventually won by over a
' length in 1:01}^ Jones brought Zamar
I up with a rusu at the end, taking the
i place from Quicksilver by a scant' head.
â  Dunboy, Fly and Key Salazar cut a very
i smail iigure in the running.
The complexion of the race did not
! please the judges in the stand, neither did
I it suit Patrol Judge Morion. The booK
; matters' sheets w. re called for and some
jof them presented a hazy aspect. It was
| freely intimated the race was a "'shoo in"
' for the winner, and many rumors relating
| to the horses and tneir immediate con
j uections were prevalent, but of coursa
! lacking in authenticity.
The judges nad a perfect view of the
race, an:, aa bets were allowed to stand,
Jones should be exonerated from bleme.
Followers of the favorites had a day of
dbaster, as but two of the choices man
a^edtoiand. The play in the ring was
lively, and the majoriiy of the books
ma'ie quite a clean-un.
The i'exas horse, M.ke Rice, afforded a
miid surprise in the opening six-.uriong
sprint, winning very handily at olds of
10 to 1, ridden by George Snider. Of the
original twenty-one entries tweive lined
up at the barrier. In me betting St.
Aignon was an 11 to 5 choice anil was
never in the chfÂ»se. Prominent all the
way to the stretch, Mike there headed
Hymn and passed the wire three lengths
ne:ore Aima, the second choice. Blue
lie i was a close third.
Fifteen two-year-olds sported silk in the
five-furlong sprint, with Zapata, the Burns
& Waterhouse entry, ruling a2to 1 fav
orite in tbe ring. The wise money, how
ever, was played in on Snider's mount,
Saticoy, who was second choice. When
the barrier was raised, Piggott hustled tne
Corrigan entry. Mirth, a 20 to 1 outsider,
out in front, and the filly wai never cau* ht,
winning by four leugths, with Eroica,
another rank outsider, finishing second,
a neck before Los Prietos. Saticoy ran a
good race, but could not get within the
money.
By Holly tried an old-fashioned uncork
ing in the third event at seven and a half
furlongs, with Fortnnate, but the warm
one was beaten out a neck by tue 8 to 5
favorite, Intiammator. splendidly ridden
by little Ciawson. Ten to 1 was eas:!y ob
tainable against Nolly's horse and those
in on the 'know" quietly unloaded.
Miss Ruth and Fortunate made the run
ning into the stretch, where Fortunate
drew away and looked to be winning.
Clawsou was now fortunate in getting
through next tbe rail with the favorite,
and in a drive gained the verdict by a
neck. Frank Jaubert was a good third.
The mile and a quarter was prolific of
another dump. Tne black horse Judse
Denny was installed a pronounced if to 10
favorite in the belting, and after tip
toeing it for over a mile with Coliins
showed signals of distress. About this
time Bergen broneht Peter tne Second up,
and in a mild drive downed Collins half a
lengtu in 2:08' 4 '- Billy McCloskey, a3O to
1 shot, was a good third.
At odds of 3 to 5, Colonel Wheeler,
ranked a* a wild horse, made a gallop of
the sixth race over a mile, winning gal
loping from Wheel of Fortune, which
showed quite an improvement in form.
Imp. Trance ran a remarkably good race,
finishing third.
Opening a 6 to 5 choice for the final
seven-and-a-half-furlongs selling run, Re
tugee receded to twos and never got to
the front. Midai, a(i to 1 chance, shook
Morven off before the sir^tcn was reached,
and at the wire bat Earl Cochran out
half a length in 1:36& May R, at 12 to 1,
finished in the show.
NOTKS.
For the first time in many months Si
McClain was seen up in the saddle again
yesterday. Si has been on the suspension
list for some lime, and his many friends
were pleased to see him riding again. It
looks as thougn he had been more than
sufficiently punished for that listless ride
of His on Babe Murphy when many, many
other worse ones furnished by other
riders have been pas?ed over unpunished.
Eroica, the St. Savior ti'.ly which fin
ished second in the two-year-old scramble,
was a 100 to 1 shot in the ring.
George Snider's excellent ride on Mike
Rice was in marked contrast to some of
his more tardy ones of the pa*t few days.
Snider has good hands and feet and could
easily become a favorite with the public

AN UNWELCOME GUEST.
Alfred Le Xorniaud, au Insane Person,
Must lie Fed in the Keceiving
Hospital.
Alfred Le Normand is au unwelcome guest
at the City Receiving Hospital. In addition
to that fact is another that he is dissatisfied
wltn his present abode, as arc the people
whose duty it Is to guard him.
L? Normand is of unsound mind and dan
gerous to himself and others. Two mouths
ago he attempted to kill his lather, and being
adjudged insaue he was committed to the asy
lum at Agnews, whence he escaped thirty
days later. He was recaptured and again
locked up.
Attorney M. M. Foote, secretary for an insti
tution which proposes io care for Ihe interests
of all personb declared insane, has caused Le
Normand to be liberated on habeas corr.us
from the asylum, and pending a further ex
amination as to the young man's sanity hu
lia* been ordered into charge ot the physi
cians at the Keceivine Hospital for ten days.
This is a rather unusual proceeding and is
causing much dissatisfaction.
The Hospital is not calculated for a place to
harbor any being excepting injured teople
and those held fora few hours before com
mitment to an asylum or a discharge. The
Supervlsois have only appropriated the small
sum of $50 per montu to feed these pension
er*, and Matron Kane is at her wit's end to
make both enls meet. As a matter of fact she
has been oblig d to draw on her own resources
quite frequently to furnish necessary and ap
propriate food "to hfr patients. The addition
of a hoarty feeder like youne Le Nornmnd for
a period of ten days is certainly not appreci
ated by tne matron.
HELD OUT THE MONEY.
Druggist Campbell Mutt Aimiver on a
Charge of Felony Embezzlement.
William Campbell, a druggist at Ninth and
Howard streets, has been hell to answer be
fore ihe Superior Court onacharge of felony
embezzlement.
According to the testimony in the lower
court, the complaining witness, a Mrs. M.
Chisholm, was knocked down atid injured by
a Ninth-street car opposite defendant's place
of Dullness.
Campbell administered the first care to the
wounded iÂ«dy, and in the course of time he so
lngraiiftt'd himself into her esteem that she
gave him her power of attorney to make a set
tlement of damages with the car company.
Recently Mrs. Chisholm and her friends
learned that instead of $75, which Campbell
claimed had been received by him from the
company aud of whicti he gave Mrs. Chisholm
$25 in full settlement, he had got $400.

The action of the Board of Supervisors,
taken two week 3 ago, rescinding ali per

the public streets conies in the nature of
a grievance to the Musicians' Union,
which made a vigorous protest against it
at last evening's session of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council. It was said that
such legislation on the part of the board
would throw many union bands out of
employment, especially those accustomed
to draw attention to attractions by making
music on streetcars. A committee was

wait upon the board and endeavor to in

street grocery firm, the proprietors of
which were charged with employing
cheap, unskilled labor to do interior car
penter work in their new store against
the protests of the unions.
The secretary was requested to notify
the district council of carpenters, that the
delegates to the various unions would be
requested to bring the matter to th- at
tention of their respective bodies, with
the recommendation that it be a .verlised
as widely as possible.
The Labor Council has been working
untiringly of late to influence the Gov

MOTHER AND SON.
Both Sorely Afflicted, but Beliff Is
Found in Dr. Williams' Piok Pills
for Pale People
From the Call, Lafayette. Ind.
The Call nas known the Byers lamily of Tal
bo:, Ind., for a long time, and J. W. Byers :â >
one of those deliberate men who say litile, Dut
reÂ»d and observe much. Mr. Byers has been
suffering for ihe past three years with grip and
kindred troubles. His mother has ever been
a sufferer, resulting later in the most aggra
vating form of rheumutism. Some time ago
Mr. Byers was persuaded by a neignbor to try
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. It didn t take long
to set Mr. Byers to talking about this remedy,
and the Call sent a special representative to
his home to ascertain the exact facts. So many
queer stories and uurelir. b e testimor.ies are
published of medicines and iheir marvelous
cures that this journal was not at all credu
lous. If the Pink Pills had done the good
work the fact snould be pubi sited, and if not
no imposition should be tolerated. The sub
joined sworn statement of Mr. Bvers is suffi
cient. It tells the facts simply and briefly :
"i know positively mat I was cured by Dr.
Williams' Pint Pills. I was persuaded by one
ot my neighbors, Maxeu Williams, to try
tnein, 'a* he olainieu to have been cured by
these pills. I bad the grip three times, and
win taken down with rheumatism, and did
not expect to live. Tne doctors said I would
never get well. They advised rae to take a
change o:' climate. 1 was reduced from 135 to
105 pound*, and would have simply laded
away had I not begun uiing the Pink Pills.
As soon as I began taking the Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills I began to gain strength and the
use of my limb' was restored. 1 had been al
most helpless for two ve&rs; the stiffness in
my limbs had been paiufnl in the extreme.
But with the use of the pills the pain ceased,
and now I am as limbÂ«r and as active as when
a boy.
"I was also troubled a great deal with my kid
neys, but the ailment has entirely disappeared.
I have been a subject for the doctors for. a long
time. Two reputable physicians had treated
me for months and I had spent a large amount
of money for other patent medicines, but to
no avail. As I said, I flnallv took Dr. Will
iams' Pink Pills for Pale People and liero I am
well. I believe that His tho most wonderful
remedy ever mnde. I need not extol this
remedy, for all my neighbors know what my
condition was and what cured me. They will
all tell you that it was Wiil lams' Pink Pills.
"My mother, who is seventy years old, was
also troubled with rheumatism and could
scarcely move. She was very wakeful at night
and had no Â«ppetite. She took five boxes of Dr.
V* illiams' Pink Pils ami now she is in perfect
health ami does all her own work on a firm.

failures In the Pacific Coast States and Tenitorle*
for tl:f past week., us compared with 23 for the
rrevions Nveek and 15 fortlie corresponding week
of 1596. The failures tor the past w-ek are
divided amoni; the irades ns follows: 2 general
stores 1 dru<;s, 8 saloons. 1 stationery. 1 con
tractor. â _' holels, 1 printer, 2 groceries and liquors.
1 umbrella manufacturer, 1 hardware company, 1

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indiia maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
mintall. of melted snow In inches and hundredths,
during tlie past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iÂ»o
--therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rairn.
"J.ows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low alone the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alonz the coast, ratn is probable:
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south o; Oregon is improb
able. With a -high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

YESTKRDAY'si WHKAT MARKET.
The following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by E. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker, 412 Pine street.
San Francisco, May 7, 1897.
Chicago.
Disappointing Liverpool cables caused a weak
opening In wheat. Initial prices of July were
70 3 /4@7lc, with May 1 cent premium. The price
held around 71c during the rirst hour, buyirs and
sellers apparectly awaiting outside influences to
guide them.
The first news of importance came from Mis
souri aud Kansas. Cinch bugs were reported to be
doing much danage throughout those states.
Bad crop conditions from California added to the
grist of hnllUh nr>ws and had the efTVct of starting
shorts to covering. Prices were marked np to 72c
for December and to 723 /4 c ior liay; at the ad
vance offerlrgs became heavy. Brokers identified
with leading longs In ihe market were selling In
large quantities The local crowd soon caught ou
and begnn piittl g out short wheat, resultli.g in a
break to 7o:>/ 8 c for December. The market closed
practically at the bottom priie of the day.

riot*. French markets advanced 10'cb.O cent
times higher. Wiatner conditions abroad are un
natisfactury, yet not a. arming.
Corn was extiemely dull, trading being lim
ited to profesiionaU, September receiving more
attention than other options. Crop prospects were
reported favorable, i hi- very low prices prevail
ing discourage shot selling, to many accidents
can happen to advance the price and there is so
little to send prices lower that traders aicdis
posea to be careful.
The immense exports, waste and manyo-her
lOiisumptive avenues must have disposed or mure
com than is generally supposed. At ihe present
price if hoxs ccrn is wor.h in the neigh borhooa of
32 to H5 cents per bushel to feed, yet tutures arc
at,out 8 cents per bushel less.
Oats dull; price* fairli- well maintained. Many

The annual tangle over Butterqootations is now
on. Contracts for large orders have been drawn
on newspaper quotations, which of course Imme
diately creates two opposinc interests. One sido
wauts Butter quoted up, the other down Tnisde
morallzes the market, not only In the uewsoapera
but on the street. If a dealer has contracied to
I de. lver fancy Creamery at 14c and Is Obliged to go
on the street to fill his order he Is charged unmei
! cifully for 11. As high as 16c has been paid on the
street on this account durlne the past twodxys. It
is supposed that these contract order* will be
closed out in a few days when accurate quotations
may again become possible.

v .nee In price* Kast on all kinds of Wool has uot
exceeded 2;.% while here the advance was from
50% to 7J>% over last year's prices. The only thing
is. that the market Kast is very dull with the ex

Dr. G W. Stimpson Says
an 0 fice Was Offered
Jor Money.
FOR A PALTRY TWENTY
DOLLARS.
Aftermath of the Recent Troub'
in Appointing a Health
Board.
STATEMENTS CF THE PERSONS
COKC.RNED.
Mayor Thcmas D nies All Knowhdg
of tbe Affair and So Dees
His Son.
Oaxland Office Fan Fkaxcisco Call,Â»
908 Broadway, May 7. )
The statement was made to-day that
money was talked of in the recent ap
pointments of tho Board of Heaitn. Dr.
Stimpson says that he was asked for $TOO
nnd paid over $20 on account, and Mr.
Houston of the firm of Barhatn & Thomas
declares Stimpson wanted to buy the office
and offered him the money for his in
fluence.
Mayor Tliomas denies all knowledge of
the affair, and said this evening that
whoever had talked to Dr. Siimpson had
certainly shown an intimate knowledge
of his (the Mayor's) private financial
mat:ers, which should cut no figure in his
official acts.
Dr. Stimpson, who was not appointed
last evening according to the original pro
gramme, made the following statem-nt
to-day :
I have known Mayor Thomas for some time
in iraternal orders and thought him a eood
man for Mayor. 1 therefore worked for him,
and after he was eected went to him and told
him I wanted tne position of City Veterinary
Surgeon and asked If I shor.ld present a writ
ten application with recommendations. He
taid 110, that he wculd have three of the five
positions at the hands of the Board of Health
and would take care of me. A few days be
fore the lito! May I went to him again and
he to dme to see his son Harry. I saw Harry
ami he sent in? to a Mr. Houston, in hiÂ»
father's office on Ninth street, where I wen tat
once.
When I ma<'e myself known he took me into
a private office and toid me the Mayor was a
poor man anil that he owed his physician and
attorney. The Board of Health was to be
allopathic aud Dr. Small would undoubt
edly get out. Ii lie did his bill must be paid,
and to get the money it hud been decided to
levy on tie men who were to iÂ»et the portions.
As my < ffice would vied $2400 in two years
my share would be $200. It Id him I f.id not
have ttiat amount, m;d he asied if I had $25.
1 gava him $20. a;! I had.
Wednesday my wife received a telephone
. message irom Harry Thomas asking me to see
Hou<ion. I came down to Houston's office,
.tut he was out. I then went to see Harry
Thomas, nnd he told me to stc Houston at
O'.;c^. Mayor Thomas' room wat open and I
walked in. I told him the fight was on and I
expected him to remain loyal to me. He re
ceived me colly, and said he had done all he
could and whs tired of the whole ift'-iir. I had
seen Dr. Pieice around the office, nnd then be
gan to suspect that all was not smooth.
I went to Houston, who ri-turned ray S?2O
and toid me the slate had been cracked, and
that if I failed on the next vole not to blame
him or Thomas, as they had doae ail tra-y
could for me.
Mayor Thomas denies any knowledge of
the story. He says:
I never met Dr. Pierce but once, and have
Known Dr. Stimpson for some time in the Ma
eoiis. He came to my hou*e to see me when I
Â«a> lick, ana after the election he asked to be
made Veterinary burgeon. I told him he
si.o.iM have it, as I Imu teen told that Fierce
worked against me. When told tnat Stimpson
was a ir^e silver mtvn and a Democrat and that
I>r. Pierce riaci worked for me I told the doc
tors they could regain Dr. Pierce it they so dc
sir-d, as I tad no objection to him.
Mr. Hous on, Mr. Benham or Harry never
mentioned Dr. Stimpson to me. aud I never
indicated to them my choice until I told Harry
when the board was named. Ido not beiieve
a word of the story against Houston, and
L-iieve Stimpson must hare worked himself
Into believing something that he either
dreamed or was toid him. I never authorized
any one to sell positions.
Mr. Houston when seen laughed at tbe
story and said:
1 can assure you I would not sell such an
office for $20. Dr. Stlmpson came to me so. -ne
t.me aeo and requested me to speak a good
word fur him, as he had worked lor Thomas.
1 then went to the mountains, and di i not re
turn until Wednesday. Meanwnile the board
was appointed and made its lions, which
vrre later declaied i.leeal.
Wednesday Dr. Stimpson came in to see me,
an i &>ked ma to S3e a j hysician whom he be
lieved was to be on the boarJ. I did so, and
lie placed $20 on the desk, and told me he
would mve v.ore when he was in office. I told
him I d.d not want his money, and did what I
couia without any thought of remuneration.
I am not in the business of office brokerage.
Harry . Thoma*. the son of Mayor
Thomas ar.d secretary ol tbe iJoard ol
Public Works, says:
Dr. Hirap<<o:i came In here and asked me to
favor bim to my father far City Veterinary. I
toi.i him I couli not and ior him to get some
Jriend*. He asked me who were father's
c i â â <â â - 1 friends and I told him Houston and
Beiihnm. I have nad nothing more to do with
t c affair and handed his name to the doctors
wi:u the others that father wanted the board
to appoint. - -. . â â  â  â

Another Step In tho Battle Over the
City's Hydrant I'atronage.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 7.â The petition
filed with the City Council to aiternnie
the fire hydrants is gradually being with
drawn. During the past two days the
City C'lerc has received numerous letter*
from the Pacific Coast agenis of the lead
ing tire insurance companies, statins that
they signed the petition not knowing
what it meant and requesting that their
names be withdrawn.
Colonel L. L. Brorawell of this city, the
coast agent for one of the companies, is at
present in Los Angeles, and he declares
that his name is ari absolute forgery. He
h&<i telegraphed that he never signed any
sncn petition and does not believe it
would be right to do so.
No one seems to know at whose instiga
tion the petition was prepare ;, bu it was
plainiy aimed at the Oakland Water Com
pany, and yet its rival* declare that they
know not ing whatever of the document.
Wivn the matter comes before the Fire
and Water Commitiee there will be a
lively session, as representatives of each
company will be on hand to give their
VJPWS.
President Dingee has declared that to
change the hydrants would be a needless
exne.-isp and an injustice to hi* company,

and would tend to force a consolidation
of tbe two companies, which would mean
the raising of tho rates, to the detriment
of the householders.
Three Small Fires.
OAKLAND, Cat,., May 7. âThe resi
dence of Captain Thoma* Mem, owned by
Hugh Cra<ig, was d scovered on fire this
orenoon by the gardener. The blaze was
extinguished before it did more than $500
d:imape. The fire was caused by v. elective
insulation.
Shortly after noon the department was
called upon to extinguish a tire in the
Chinese washhouse of Lee Sing, 422 Fifth
street. Live ashes caused the lirr. The
damage was only nominal. Assistant
Chief Murdock arrested the owner for
violating tne fire ordinance.
At 12:30 this mornine fire was discov
ered in a 9econd-hand"store on Twelfth
s reet, between Broadway and Washing
ton. An old mattress was found burning
in the center of the store. The Cniel is
satisfied tbat it is a caso of incendiarism.

OAKLAND, Cal., May 7.â Annie Far
rell was committed to tlie Napa A>-yi m
to-day. She imagines she is being con
fined for some crime and ir took two men
to control her. Her mind became over

THE TUNNEL.
Supervisor! Are Now ExercUlnt Their
Power to Construct One Through
the HilU,
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 7.â A little ad
ditional light is thrown on the right of the
Supervisors to build a tunnel under the
e-tuary ty the fact that they are at this
present moment considering the project
of boring a tunnel through the hills be
yond Oakland for the purpose of construct
ing a wngon road into the Contra Costa
valleys beyond, and encouraging the farm
ers ot that region to come to the coumy
seat to trade.
No one has raised any objection on le
gal grounds to this plan, it being conceded
that tunnel-buildinn is a necessary ad
junct of road-making that is like y to ari^e
in a hilly region, and it being conceded
that under the genera! law the Supervisors
have authority to undertake such an en
terprise. This being the case the friends
of the estuary tunnel want io know why
it snou d be illegal to build a tunnel un
der a s ream and not illegal to build one
through a hill.
FOR IMPROVEMENT.
Movement for the Organization of an
Association of Business Men.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 7â A proposi- '
tion has Deen mooted for the formation of :
an association of business men, to take in ;
hand various projects for the public bene- j
fit. It is proposed to call a mass-meeting
on the evening of the 14th ins 1 , to take j
steps to this end. The call for the meet
ing reads:
After careful consideration and study and
after reading the literature sent broadcast by
the different citieÂ» aad sections of the State to
advertise ana bring to public notice their re
spective merits, and to rail the attention of
the prospective buyer to the many reasons
why he suould consider certain places above
all others in which to invest hi-* capital, it has
been concluded best to call together a num
ber of those persons who are most interested
in the city's weUfare to discuss the need of
some such measure instituted here.
Many of tne cities around he bay are receiv
ing far more trade and public notice than the
city of Alameii* at tl is timo. Seme action
must be taken to keep Alatieda to the fore.

Will Hays to Answer for Deserting
His Family of Little Ones in
Tiiis City.
Oakland Offick Sax Francibco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 7. f
Mrs. Bianchi left Oakland a few days
ago and has succeeded in having her
husband placed in jail in Nevada' City on
a charge of deserting his family.
Bianchi was an Oakland barber, who
owned considerable property and was very
saving. Severa lyears ago his first wife
died and a little later Bianchi married her
si-ter, with whom he lived moderately
huppy for a few years. About eighteen
months ago Binnchi left his wife and
tnree little ones and representing himself
as a single man bestowed his affections on
another woman in tnis city. He kept oat
ol his wife's sight and was surprised one
evening to receive a visit from her at his
apartments. The interview only laMÂ«d a
few seconds. Mrs. Bianchi had taken a
gun along with her and as soon as she
opened the door she commenced firing at
her husband and a second later he rushed
past her into the sireet wiih a bulletin
his hip. He was taken to the Receiving
Hopital and when he recovered he
promised to be a dutiful husband and was
received back by his wife.
A short time elapsed and he disacpeared
once more, and nothing was heard of him.
He left Oakland ana his wife did not know
wuere he was until about two weeks ago.
At that time a friend from Nevada City
came to Oakland and stated that he had
left Biancni in the mountain town.
According to the visitor's story Bianchi
was conducting a barber-shop in Nevada
City with the assistance of a very hand
some woman, whom everybody believed
! was his wife, and who was introduced as
; Mrs. Bianchi. The barber's insane jeal
ousy led to his own undoing, ior on two
; occasion*, while quarreling, he cut the
woman with a razor.
Her life was made so miserable that she
! attempted suicide. On her recovery f<he
! declared that she would make Bianchi
j suffer for his conduct, and having heard
1 that he had a wife and three children in
; this city she instituted an investigation.
She soon found Mrs. Bianchi proper, and
: the two women decided that mo barber
: utiould pay the penally of his crime. Mrs.
â  Bianchi left Oakland and as soon as she
; got to Nevada City swore out a warrant
against her husband for desertion and he
is now in jail. If he has married the Ne
vada City woman he will also have to
answer a charge of bigamy.

BERKELEY, Cal., May 7.â Tbe action
of the Board of Education in creating tho
office ol City Superintendent of Hchoo.s
has occasioned a gre;it deal of discussion,
and now a petition is in circulation ask
ing that the ccur?e taken be reconsidered
and that the office be nboiished. The
salary of the ne^v otticer was set at $2500 a
year and F. E. Perliam of Santa Ana was
appointed to the place.
The opponents of such action at first
claimed that it was Illegal, quoting the
charter provision which makes three
years' residence in Berkeley a needed
qualification to hold office in the town. It
is thought, however, that the -chool posi
tions rilled by the Board of Education are
not officers within the meaning of the
charter.
The petition for which signatures are
being asked sets forth the following rea
sons why a city superintendent should not
be appointed:
Firstâ That in view of the lack of school
buildings and the ueeds of the new school
houses, now being erected, we connider thnt
the money might be spent to better ndvantaee.
Secondâ That the amount appropriated from
all sources tor the maintenance of public
schools will not warrant such an amount
being paid for a superintendent without cut
ting the supply of other articles more neces
sary.
Thirdâ That we hava full confidence of the
executive abilities of Principals Waterman,
WarnecJio and Congdon, ami do not think they
need an overseer or watchman placed over
them.
The petition will be presented to the
Board of E lucatior. at its next meeting.

foge'.
The fourteenth annual conference of the I
Evangelical A-sociation convened yester
day morning at the Enianuei Church on
Twelfth street, between Market and Mis
sion. The onening exercises consisted of
a prayer by Bishop Breyfogel, followed by
singinp by the congregation. The Bishop
then gave a conference address. He said
in part:
Fathers and Brethren: The annual confer
ence 1s the itinerant's fireside. After a year
of faithful toil we father in tuis, our ecc'.esi
astical home, to rteouut the joys of an itiner
ant's life, to report the results of the work,
and to gHtner up new strength for duties to
come. As when a traveler gains a mountain
summit, takes a lonn look over the country
already traversed, aud an eager survey of the
journey still beyond, Â«o thÂ« Itinerant preacnur
reaches an annual J J i*gah of hopeful prospect
es well Â«s of careful retrospect.
It js a time for earnest ana unflinching in
quiry Into the real motives of ministerial ac
tivity. Of all men in the world a Christian
minister needs to know his own heart and its
real relations.
The annum conference offers opportunities
for new menial and moral equipment,and can
become to eacn, member a time ior great spirit
ual quickening.
In these aays when some men, who claim to
be preachers ot Goi's word, assail the very
truth they profess to proclaim, applying to the
divine reveiauon the method of the rational
lit, we do well to emphasize with increased
clearness and force the verities ot the Gospel,
and to accept unhesitatingly the miraculous
as well as tile mornl and historical elements
of the Bible, it affords m--> great pleasure to
know that J address a company of devoted
m n who trust fully in the truth which they
preacu to o hers.
The Bishop then appointed Dr. H.
Cordes and Rev. J. Kraber and Rev. O.
Glun;; assistants. The annual investiga
tion into the conduct of the ministers fol
lowed, showing that all hod indeed been
well with th<= association during the past
veir. Credentials were voted to the Rev.
Karl Meckel to the Minnesota Confer
ence.
At the afternoon session Rev. E. F. Ber
ner wos elected presiding elder for the
next four years of the Los Angeles district.
The reports of the various churches we-ri 1
then read, showing all of them to be in
a most flourishing condition. The follow
ing commilteeo were then appointed:

BLIND,STARVING
AND WITHOUT HOPE
Pitiful Plight of the Son of
a Once Powerful
Don.
Asked Supervisor Mitchell to
Lead Him Down to
the Bay.
D sircus to Dip, tut Without Any
thing by Which Ha Coull
Satisfy Hs Desir?.
Oakland Offick, San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 7. )
A man probably more miserable and
with less to live for than any man in Cali
fornia wandered into the Hall of Records
to- icy searching for a Supervisor to give
him relief.
The old fellow was Frank Sovranos, a
Spaniard, about 60 years of age. He is
totally bli:id, partially paralyze! and
quite unable to take care of himself. He
arrived in this city last night, roamed the
streets alone until tars morning and as
soon as daylight came he wandered to the
blind home on Telegraph avenue, where
he applied for adni'ssion.
As mere are forty applications on rile at
the home Sovranos could not be received.
He came to this city with a recommenda
tion from the Supervisors of Los Angeles
County that he be received inio the home.
They furnished him transportation to
Oakland for that purpose.
Supervisor Mitchell li-tened patiently to
the old feiiow'f story. He said he had no
money, no food, no place to go and as he
is not" a resident of this county Supervisor
Mitchell could not render him assistance
from county funds.
"Then it you can't help me," said the
old man, "lead me toward the bay bo that
I may drown myself. It does not cost
anything to die mat way, and I have no
object in Jivinc. I have not the means
even to get anything with which to kill
myself."
The District Attorney was consulted 10
--garding the pitiful plight of the old
Spaniard, and he advised that he be sent
to the county infirmary, and later in the
day this was done.
Sovranos was born near the old mission
in Monterey. His father was one of the
old Spanish settlers, and half a century
ago was a prominent don. The son has
spent his lifetime in this State and re
mpnibers much interesting history of the
early days of California, whan his family
helped to govern. With the decline of the
Spaniards they lost all their property,
and now the old man is absolutely penni
less.
OONTEA COSTA TUNNEL.
Can the Supervisors Build II and Refuse
One Undor the Estuary?
OAKLAND, Cal., May 7.â A good
deal of talk is being inulged in as
a result of the recent decision of
District Attorney Snook relative to the
power of the Board of Supervisors to con
struct a tunnei under the estuary.
Taliesin Evans.. ex-Councilman of the
Sixth Ward, addressed the following to
him this afternoon:
I observe that District Attorney S;iook ren
dered an opinion at a meeting- of lnteres:ed
citnens held in the hall of the Board of Super
visors last Wednesday night to ihe effect that
the board had no authority to spend the county
money for me boring of a tunnel under the
estuary, its power being restricted to the cou
struct'on of a bridge across that waterway.
If trie opinion is sound, ca.i the Supervisors
appropriate any money for the boring
of a tunnel through the Contra ( osia
range on the route of the Kennedy
road, which, I understand, is contemplated?
What is the difference btUweeu going under
the summit of the Contra Costa range to avoid
going over it, and going under Sun Antor.io
estuary to avoid crossing over It? 1 am not
advocating the one nor declaring agaiiiMttnc
other, but asking a question which two under
takings involving ti bimilarenglnecrlng opera
tion naturally suggest. There may be a ma
terial difference in the opinion of ibe District
Attorney between the right of the Supervisor!
to spend public money to get uuder waier Â«nd
their right 10 spend it to gel under rock, but a
plain citizen confesses Ms inability to see it.
"The tunnel proposition through the
hills is an incident of the power given the
Supervisors," eaid District Attorney Bnook
this afternoon in reply to the letter, "rela
tive to theconstruciion of highways, while
the estuary plan shows the absence of such
power.
"Outside of municipalities within its
jurisdiction (he county has absolute
power at present, but witnin the munici
pality the city or town takes precedence
and is responsible for its own highways.
"Just there is the catch. The estuary is
within two citie â Oakland and Ala
medaâwith the southern line of the for
mer seiving as the northern line of the
latter. As a const qnence, the county has
no control, except in so far as toe acts of
Legislature give it privilege*. This whs
the case In the Webster-sirvet bridge. Ii
is obvious that the county cannot over
step its limited power and assume the
right to construct a tunnel, when it is
merely allowed to build a bridga."
lecture to the Police.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 7.â Chief of Po
lice C. E. Llovtt had his men on Uress
para<!e before the City Hall this afternoon.
The unu-al spectacle of s-o many blue
coats together nttrscted considerable of a
crowd. They were marched upstairs in
columns of two and given their regular
quarterly lecture by trie Chief.

Report of the Investigating
Committee of the
Grand Jury.
BASED ON TESTIMONY OF
EXPERTS.
No Foundation for the Allega
tions of Carelessness or
Extravagance.
WHOLE GROUND IS CAREFULLY
GONE OVER.
Commissioners "Deserve the Heartiest
Commendation of Their Fel'ow-
Citizans "
The committee of the Grand Jury on
Parks, after a very exhaustive and care
ful inqniry into the transactions upon
which were based the allegations of mis
management, extravagance and even
fraud on the part of the Park Commis
sioners and the superintendent, have filed
a rejiort completely exonerating tho3e
officers.
ExDerts of the hichest standing for
ability and integrity, notable among them
beins; Prolessor George Davidson, were
employed to ma ice measurements and in
vestigations, and their reports were veri
fied by the committee itself, and the
comment made is that "the commission
ers have been and are carrying out their
duties and the trust repo>ed in them in
the best possible manner, and deserve the
heartiest commendation of their fellow
citizens.''
Following is the report in full:
San FRANCISCO, May 4, 1897.
To thf Honorable t tit Grand Jury of San Fran
cifco: Your committee ou parks, etc., having
had the subject under consideration beg leave
to report tiiat a thorough nnd exhaustive
examination has been made of the affairs and
condjiion ot (iolaen Gate Park. Two experts
have been engaged, and every item of expendi
ture and receipt has be<n checked from July
1. 189fi. to April 1, 1897. All items have been
classified and apportioned to the several de
partments, finding all the facis correct, the
totals agreeing with the demands on the
treasury.
The following is a summary of moneys ex
pended for material and labor and for con
struction and maintenance;
Material v*ed for cons' ruction 63,744 76
Material used for maintenance 19,085 20
Labor used for construction i2.?-78 05
Labor used for maintenance 69,732 37
Total $175,110 38
Men employed, including superintendent,
office-boy, secretary and police, were as fol
lows: The smallest number, in December,
1896. 159; the largest number, in March. lÃ97,
217; avenpe number employed lor the nine
months, 184.
Concerning the consumption of coal, your
committee find from the report of the experts
that all the coal delivered and paid for by the
City and County has been consumed for park
purposes exclusively, and so far as we can
ascertain after a close and critical examina
tion the money has been well expended;
deeming the matter of coal to be of grave im
portance, special care was taken to ascertain
beyond peradventure of a doubt, the exact
amounts of coal bought, delivered and con
sumed at the different stations, such as the
conservatory, lodge' and pumping station;
each load as delivered was weighed at the park
scales by a properly authorized person from
the office, and tag delivered at the lodge.
Test runs were made to ascertain the correct
Consumption for pumping purposes, the details
of which are prepared and fiied with expert's
report; every part has been fully accounted
for; we can find ne.ther waste nor loss.
Total amount delivered trom January 1.
1896 to April 1, 1897, was 551 tons and 130
pounds, at a total cost of $4603 55, as ioilows:
Park Lodae, 35 tons 1770 pounds of
Xamimo. clean (in sacks) $8 79
Conservatory, 92 tons 2040 pounds of Penn
sylvania anthracite, 60 ions 1770 pounds
of Nttnaimo, clean 10 98
Pumping station, 361 tons 1270 pounds of
.Nanaimo 7 19
The stables and appurtenances thereto, in
cluding carpenter and paint shops, were thor
oughly and carefully examined, and we have
to report tnat all ana everything in connec
tion therewith was found in the best possible
condition. The hay, grain and feed in use we
found to be first clags in every particular. The
total amount expeniei for feed from July 1,
1896. to April 1, 1897, we find to be $741875,
which includes medical attendance drugs,
also the labor of four men, two of whom, it is
proper to say, are also employed in other du
ties than that strictly pertaining to the horses
and stables. For the period above mentioned
â we find expended the sum of $457 20 for har
ness, repairs thereto and articles Incidental to
the car- of hi>r-.s and stables of such size. On
July 1, 1896, 54 horses ere on hand; at the
present time there are 47. We especially com- !
mend me policy of the commissioners in pro- ,
curing and maintaining animals that are a
credit to the park, both in appearance and effi
ciency.
The item of loam was a subject of careful
and critical consideration, It was ascertained
that $12,153 99 was exoencied for same from
July 1, 1896, lo April 1, 1897, and that 26,458
cube yards had been received and distributed.
Although at first elnnoe the amount would ap
pear large, a personal examination made the
fact apparent that the need of loam was a
matter of the utmost importance. Of the 1050
ncres composing the aiea of toe park, about
700 acres are well loame<l, and about 300
acres require this imp. irtaut Â«d junct to pre
serve trees that hove iittuined iroin three to
eight years of growth, but which are threat
ened with extinction if much longer deprived
of this substance. The adV!int>-ge of .oam is
well illustrated on the| north side of the soutn
drive at cb^ut Thirty-second avenue, where
the tall, well nurtured and nch;y verdured
trees growing in loame<l eround form a strong
contrast to tne stuntc-d. sickly looking objects
of the same aEe that Â«re in sand tnat has not
been loameii for the last four years. A good
substitute for loam has been found in street
sweepings, and in this connection your com
mittee expresses regret that these sweepings
cauuDt be obtained at reasonable cost.
The pumping station we found to be in flrÂ«t

class condition and excellent order. Particu
lar attention was given the vertical pumps
and connections, and we find the cos'- there oi
to be $9803. This amount seemed large and
niisht well arrest attention, but after th or
oughly investigating tne subject matter your
committee find that the new pump witn its
capacity of 12,500 gallons more per hour than
the old ones is h great saving in iuel and labor;
that the cost is reasonable and that the Com
missioners have made a wise and economical
investment.
Granite bridge and concreteâ On .November
26, 1895, the Board of Park CommUsioncrs
decided by resolution to construct a bridge
across the main drive leading to the new
music grounds an 1 museum. An agreement
was entered into with Gray Bros, to build the
archway according to drawings and specifica
tions furnished liv Edward Swain, architect, at
25 tents per cubic foot. The specifications
were subsequently modified by decrensing the
thickness ot walls from nine feet to two and a
liaif feet, at a saving of about $6000.
Atfer the completion ot the archway the
Commissioners advertised for bids from archi
tects to draw plans and specifications for
granite and concrete work. On January 28,
1896, the plans of bridce submitted by Messrs.
Coxlieatl & CoxbeaU, architects, were accepted
and bids were called for for the granite and
concrete work. On July 27. 1896, the bid of
Alexander McLennon for $27,216 for granite
work was accepted, and Superintendent Mc-
Laren authorized to conter with McLennon
and make the be*t terms for concrete work.
On July 31, 1896, a contract was entered
into with Alexander McLennon to furnisti
granite and do the granite work (except the
lour balustrades and pedestal for statue) and
facing arches of main drive viaduct lor the
Bum of $10,000, granite to be like sample sub
mitted. On August 8, 1896, a second contract
was made with Alexander McLennon ior gran
ite work to the four balluslrndirgs above the
main drive viaduct for the sum of $16,000.
The constru tion of the pedestal was dis
pensed with at a reduction of $1216 from Mc-
Lennon's bid.
On August 1, 1896, the Park Commissioners
entered into a contract witn Gray Bros, for 23
cents per cubic foot for all concrete founda
tion work to the main arches, balustrades and
pedestal to main drive viaduct and for all i
concrete backing to granite work. On com
pletion of the concrete work a settlement was
made with Gray Bros, on the basis of measure
ment and computations furnished by Archi
tects Coxhead &. Coxhead for 24,03111-100
cubic feet, amounting to $5527 3t>.
On January 22, 1397. C. K. Grunsky, engi
neer, at the request of the Park Commission
ers, submitted dimensions and estimates in
detail of quantities of concrete. He reports
the quantity of concrete in the finished struc
ture as 22,943 87 cubic feet (subsequently in
creased to 23,267.68 cubic feet), but says his
estimate does not include four small blocks of
concrete filling, the spaces between tne ends
of viaduct and the wing walls not having any
definite data to make the computation.
Again, at the request of the Park Commis
sioners, Professor George Davidson, consult
ti.g engineer, inspected the reports and figures
submitted by Coxhead & Coxhead ana C. E.
Grunsky; he also obtained from Lieutenant i
Charles L. Potter, U. 8. A. engineer, the basis I
oi his calculation. Mr. Davidson's recompu- |
tationsg-ve 23,267.48 cubic feet. The differ
ence oi 763.43 cubic feet between the meas
ures anu couiDU'.ations of Coxnead <S:Coxhead
and C E. Grunsky he ascribes to the fact that
as the concrete work of the structure had
been finished when Mr. Grunsky made his
measurements, he was necessarily compelled
to take a certain surface line of the work for
the con tact surface between the granite and
the concrete, whereas Messrs. Coxhead &.
Coxhead had measured the actual line of con
tact o every course, and these contacts were
irregular; that a difference oi thickness of
2VÂ£ Inches of the concrete at the contact with
ti.e granite facing would reasonably account
for this 763.43 cubic feet.
With reference to Lieutenant Potter's calcu
lations. Professor Davidson explained the
great difference witn Coxhead &. Coxhead,
Mr. Grunsky's und his own by quoting Lieu
tenant Potterâ "that he was simply called
upon to co to the park and look o-ver the
bridge work that could be seen and give nn
opinion of the concrete in place at that time;
that he had no authority to investigate or ,

â¢uncover the work, or 10 consult with the
architect; that th^ work was then not carried
to the top of the concrete, there being one or
two courses unlaid. He was not aware that
there were more than two offsets in the inner
suriace of the concrete, nor iied he any in
formation of the larger buses and their spiny* ;
that the two ba.ustrades to divide the main
drive from the foot pa.-sages were not torn
meaced, and he understood they were to be
granite. The spandrel* were empty, and he
understood : hey were to be filled wiili stone:
that there was nothing In the small plans
furnished him to distinguish granite from
concrete."
Proiessor Davidson asserts that if Lieutenant
Potter had been given the same authority as
Mr. Grupaky and hlmseif to investigate, un
cover and measure the concrete, he would
have arrived at the same results.
We have thoroughly examined all of the re
ports of Ccxhead ACoxhead, Grunsky and
Davidson, and believe them to bo fair and
as nearly correct ns it is possible to calculate.
Ljdgeâ This buildinz Is but another evi
dence of the good judgment displayed by the
Commissioners iv retiring a structure that is
au ornament nnd a credit to the park, and
conforms to the other improvements recently
made. An examination of lubor and material
accounts convinces r.s that the cost of the
struciun- 1-* vry reasonable. The old lodge
buiidiug had to be removed, and the Commis
sioners disposed of it to the best advantage,
saving the coat 01 removal.
Police â Thi" subject received our enreful
consideration, and we most heartily commend
the manner lv which this branch of th" pub
lic service is conducted. Discipline i- rigidly
maintained, and the men are careful and
alett in everything that comes wituiu the
province of their duties.
Tabulated and itemized statements and spp
clfic reports upon the delivery and consump
tion of coal, hay and grain, the purcln se and
distribution ot loam and water pine, the cost
of granite bridge, embracing all matters per.
taining to its construction, and the cost of
the vtTtical pump are on tile.
The experts report the books and accounts
accurately and neatly kept. Every facility
waÂ« given your committee to procure the facts
and figures as Riven iv this report, and the
conclusion arrived at is that the Commission
ers have been and are carrying out their duties
and the trust reposed in them in the best pos
sible manner, and deserve the heartiest com
mendation of their fellow-citizens. Sev.-ral
recommendations n ade by your committee
were gratefully received by the Commissioners
Bno will be acted upon by them. Respectfully

collector. Oppermann called on Dr. Wil
liamson of V.c b ard a few days aeo and
broached the subject of gelling his body
after death. Ho was perfectly serious and
seemed to look on the matter as a legiti
mate commercial transaction. Not cannjr
to speculate in futures Dr. Williamson
referred the musician to the Health Office,
where he conferred with Secretary God
chaux.
"How much do you value your body
at?" asked the secretary.
"Ob, 1 think $200 would be about rif,ht,"
replied Oppermann.
"Now, I thought like this: If I could
sell my body 1 could get a lot by paying
$50 or $100 down. Then I could get a lit
tle house built, and I would have to pay
only $8 a month instead of $13, as Ido
now.
"Money is money these time?, and if I
I could get that I should be very well
pleased.
"If my body is cut up on the dissecting
table I shall not be buried alive, and that
is something I have always been afraid of,
because my uncle was laid in his coffin
tbrne times and once was lowered into a
grave."
Mr. Godchaux advised Oppermann to ad
dress a communication to the board on
the subject, and the musician declared
that h? would do so.
"If I can't make a bargain with the
board," he continued, "I shall offer my
body to some of the medical colleges. I
have no thoughts of suicide or idea that I
am goinÂ£ to die soon, but merely want to
raise money on my body after I am
through with it, just as you would on a
watch that you d'scard because yon have
come into possession of a better one."

TURNER INDICTED AGAIN.
Frenna, His Nemesis, Brings a
Charge of Perjury Against
Him.
His Clerk ;.n i Stenographer, Miss
Lizzie O'Donnell, Also Inlicted
With Hm
The Grand Jury yesterday returned a
true bill of indictment against J. F.
Tu r ner, real estate operator, and his clerk
and stenographer, Lizzie F. O'Donnell,
for the crime oi perjury.
The crime is alleged to have been com
mitted at the recent trial before Judge
Wallace, wherein Turner was the defend
ant upon a charge of the theft of certain
deeds. Turner had been previously tried
on a charce of bavins forged the deeds
upon which he had borrowed money â sev
eral thousand dollarsâ from J. P. Frennn,
a barber. The deeds said to have been
forged were stolen during the trial, and
t tie prosecution failed for lack of them.
Then Tumor was tried upon the charge of
having stolen them.
On this trial the deeds were produced.
They differed in essential particulars from
the original deeds ana it is now charged
that both Turner and his clerk swore
falsely when they testified that they were
the original deeds. Miss O'Donnell tes
tified that she wrote fie deeds herself all
at one time. It is alleged that certain
interlineations showing a different hand
and a different ink go to disprove this
statement.
The committee on parks returned a full
report of its investigations of the charges
of mismanagement and financial prodi
gality made against the Commissioners
and superintendent. The report based
upon tne reports of the experts employed
fully exonerates both. It is published in
full elsewhere in this issue.

her, but they refused to do so without a
certificate, which Dr. J. R. Murdo finally
gave.
Love was seen wearing the dead woman^a
diamond ring, and he offered to give his
partner h?r cape. He then presented a
bill for $300 to the dead woman's husband.
It was compromised for $280 on the advice
of Mr. Lampruan's attorneys.
The detective says Love married a girl
in April, beat her out of $80 and tried to
force her to lead an evil hie. In Septem
ber he is said to have married another
jrirl and deserted her under similar cir
cumstances.
