ALL READY FOR THE BATTLE
To - Day the Legislature
Will Vote for a United
States Senator.
SHORTRIDGE'S MEN FEEL
CONFIDENT.
Perkins' Managers in Deep Gloom
and They Boldly Lobby for
Support.
INCREASED DEFECTIONS FROM
THE INCUMBENT.
Those Who Insist on Carrying Out the Pledges of
District Conventions May Violate the Laws
of the State Governing the Purity
of Elections.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 11.-There is war and there are
runicrs of war around the lobbies to-night, and the interest in the
contest to take place to-morrow is intense.
An interesting complication is likely to spring up, growing out of
an alleged violation of the purity of elections law by legislators who
pledg-d themselves before their conventions to vote for Senator
Perkins. It is contended that they had i o more right to make such
a pledge than they would have to pledge themselves to build a
school house or a bridge.
MAY VOLUTE THE LAW.
Legislators Who Carry Out the
Pledges of Conventions Are
in a Quandary.
SACRAMENTO, Ca.i_, Jsn. 11.âLegisla
tors who piedged themselves before they
were nominated to vote for Mr. Perkins
are said to have violated the parity of
elections law. That law forbids a candi
date from making any promises or
pledges before his election, and the
point has been raised that the pledges
and the reasons assigned by members
wi;y they w:l: vote for Air. Perkins are not
hey admire him for his ability, or
that they want him elected, but they are
ccnatraineti and coerced into doing so by
virtue oi those pledges imposed on them
Dy the coantj conventions manipulated
for the personal advancement of senator
Perkins.
It is contended that the giving of those
--;s or promises was contrary to the
purity o; elections law, as much so as a
promise to vote for acy other proposition
â tor instance, for the erection of a school
house or a public building or the aDpoint
ment of any nnmber of men to office.
COLONELS ARE GLOOMY.

by the Defections From Perkins,

and took up bis station in the lobby of
the Golden Eagle Hotel, he ' was not
greeted by political acquaintances with
teat effusiveness and warmth with which
the man on the winning side is usually
received, la fact he remained alone and
unnoticed for some time, although the
crowa was small and there was no diffi
culty in seeing him. It may have been
tee anxious, almost despairing, look on
his face that repelled offers of condolence
on the waning star vt the incumbent
United States Senator, and tnat made his
friends diffident about congratulating him
on being selected for the port collector
Â«hip; for if the Perkins star sank below
the horizon there would be no job for the
clone!. Old-timer 3, as soon as they
glanced at the Jackson face, remarked
that something must be wrong with the
bricade of political colonels who are being
so valiantly supported by that stanch "Re
publican" paper, the Examiner.
Wben ColoaeJ Hamilton and Colonel
Milt Green arrived on the next train they
brought the blues with them into the fogs
of Sacramento. Colonel Hamilton's de
pression of spirits was very noticeable.
He waÂ« fliehty and nervous and seemed to
be unable to stand for any length of time
in one place. The man seemed to have
lost all of tnat self-poise which always
marks tha demeanor of the military, and
it looked as though he was ready to beat
a retreat on the slightest provocation.
Of course the news that Assemblyman
Breilins: of Alameda had deserted the Per
kins camp and that Senator D?nison
Of Aiameda would not promise to vote for
Perkins after the firs, ballot had reached
them. They had heard also that several
more who had voted for Senator in the

"snap" eancus* were to repudiate the
caucus and would vote for Samuel M.
' Shortridge. * â  ;'*'* 1
This is why a gloom hung over the lobby
last night and why Colonel Hamilton re
mained up till 3 o'clock this morning
wrestling with Assemblymen and Sena
] tors who had announced their intention
j to vote for Mr. Shortridge.
It was hoped by Colonels Jackson, Ham
ilton and Green that the soothing hand of
time would- heal ail hard feeling on the
part of Mr. Way mire and his friends, and
that they would wheel into line and sup
port Mr. Perkins. Â»i
If the defection of Assemblyman Brei-'
iiag verrMd rSenatur^Peffcins'^ maosstrj,
' the reports ..: that others were ,f eUowiag;
j suit worried them st ill more, and it was
necessary for Vaquero Hamilton to ride
I into the corral and round up the victims
1 of the snap "caucus" to ascertain which
!of them and how many escaped. In order
to hide their confusion and to make the
evil tidings less believable the two col
onels'on the Perkins slate began blowing
the bugle of boast and shouting that they
| had sixty-eight votes, including one Demo
! crat in the Senate and two Democrats in
i the Assembly. But it was strange that
! those gentlemen who had made the elec
tion of Senator Perkins a certainty we're
not mentioned by name and have not
come forward to claim the glory of the
victory to which they were contributing
and which without their help would not
i be possible. But on the. -other hand the
gentlemen who bad gone over from Mr.
Perkins to Mr. Shortridge made no at
tempt to conceal the fact. As soon as
Assemblyman Breiliug had made up bis
â  mind that the people did not want Mr.
| Perkins to represent them any longer, his
name and the fact became known at on;e.
! The other gentlemen who are going to de
i sert Mr. Perkins after the first ballot have
! not announced themselves publicly for
! obvious reasons.
Nobody except the men on the Perkins
i slate believes that there will b? an elec-

Strength of Shortridgre.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 11.â There
was so much buzzing confusion in the As
sembly chambers to-day that the mem
bers frequently called on the Speaker to
put a stop to the noiÂ«e. The Perkins lobby
was active in buttonholing and whisper
ing to memtifrs who were weakening
under the pressure of letters and tele
grams from constituents asking that
Samuel M. Shortridge be supported for
United States Senator. , .-
Whatever the sentiment may be in the
Legislature the truth is now known that
four-fifths of the Republicans of Califor
nia desire that Mr. Perkins be retired to
private life, and that Mr. Shortridge be
elected to the United States Senate. The
following letter from a : leading Republi
can of Santa Clara County is a sample of
hundreds received from other sources:

The reading of tbe foregoing telegram

After the Proposition to Refund the Debts of the
Pacific Railroads Is Beaten by a Vote of 167
Noes to 102 Ayes Powers of Vermont
Tries to Secure a Rehearing.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.â Fate
overtook the Jfacific railroad refunding
bill in the House to-day. It was defeated,
by the majority of 65 votes, and its sup? i
porters were even prevented from sending \
it back to tbe committee for reconsidera- ;
tion.
The motion on whicn tbe decisive blow j
was dealt called for the engrossment aad
tbe third reading of tbe bill. "When the
roll had been called and tbe resnlt was
announced tbe oDponents of tbe measure
indulged in some hand - elspping, but
made no attempt at * more noisy demon
' gtration. The final vote was 167 noes, 102
ayes.
A full attendance of members was evi
dence of the interest taken in the funding
bill, which was debated last week and
upon wiiicb, under the special order, a
vote was taken to-day.
The speaker stated the first question to
be upon tbe amendments adopted in the
committee of the wbole, and they wera
agreed to without division.
The next vote was taken on the substi
tute offered by Bell (D.) of Texas, fixing
the rate of interest on the bonds to be is
sued at 3 per cent, instead of 2, as pro
vided in the bill. The substitute was de
bated. Ayes 110, noes 156.
The question then reverted to the sub
stitute offered by Harrison (D.) of Ala
bama, constituting tbe Secretary of tbe
Treasury, tbe Secretary of the Interior
and the Attorney-General a commission
with full power to settle tbe debts of tbe
bond-aided Pacific railroads upon such
terms and in such a manner as may be
agreed upon, the apprcvai of the Presi
dent being necessaiy. If unable to reach
an agreement with the owners of the
roads, the commission to recommend to
Congress what legislation they deem ne
cessary to protect the interests of the Gov

lection of the debt.
This substitute was also defeated â ayes
53 to 214 noes.

Immediately upon the announcement
of the vote by Speaker Reed there was
some applause from opponents of the bill.
The Speaker pronounced the perfunctory
sentence required that the House decline
to order the engrossment and third road
ing of the measure, and considerable con
fusion followed caused by the exchange â c*!
congratulations among members.
Powers (R.) of Vermont wanted the bill
recommitted to tlie Committee on Pacific
Railroads. He said that every member
wanted something done about the matter.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri made a point
of order against this. He held that inter
vening business made the motion out of
order.
After some desultory debate Speaker
Reed disposed of the matter by saying he
would like until to-morrow to look into
the question involved before rendering an
opinion.
A bill providing that officers who served
in the regular army during the war of the
Rebellion be permitted to wear the uni
form of their highest rank was passed.
A bill for the relief of H. W. Wade, late
captain Tuirty-eighth Ohio Volunteers,
was also passed.
On motion of Curtis (R.) of New York
the House went into committee of the
whole for the consideration of the mili-
tary academy appropriation bill. He ex
plained that it carried $489,000, or $46,000
more than the bill for the current year.
This increase was caused by a provision
for new buildings.
After a short discussion, in which little
interest was manifested, the bill was re
ported to the House and passed.
House bill to reduce the eases in which
the penalty is death, with Senate amend
ments, was taken up, and the amend
ments concurred in and passed.
Senate bill providing that vessels of
over fifteen tons burden, propelled by gas,
fluid, naptha or electric motors, shall be
subject to the laws of the United States
witn regard to steam vessels, waÂ« also
taken up and passed.
Under the call of committees the follow
ing bills were also passed: To amend the
act authorizing appointment of receivers
of.National banks; 10 amend the act for the
organization of National banks so as to
provide that no National bank shall be
organized in ciites of 50,000 inhabitants
with less than $200,000 capital, in cities of
30.000 with less than $100,000, in cities of
6000 with less than |50,000, and in cities of
0000 with less than $20,000.
A House bill to better define the rights
of aliens to hold real estate in the Terri
tories was passed by a vote of 45 to 4, but a
point of no quorum was made, and then
on motion of Loud (R.) of California, the
House at 4:12 o'clock adjourned until to
morrow.
STYLE IT A VICTORY.
Judge Maguire and Senator White
Talk About the Defeat of
the Bill.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.â The
deleat of the Powers bill was not a sur
prise to Judge Maguire or any other of the
Californians. Grove L. Johnson, the only
California Representative in Congress
who supported Huntington, admitted to a
Call representative early this morning
that in his opinion the bill was doomed to
defeat. John Boyd was downcast on Sat
urday niÂ«ht after speeches in the House
by opponents of the bill had been greeted
with applause from both sides of the
chamber, while the arguments of the pro
ponents of the bill were given"a frost."
Ten days ago Judge Maguire was
anxious about the outcome, but since the
debate commenced on Thursday he has
been encouraged. The Call corres
pondent predicted a week ago that the bill
would be defeated, and this prediction
was based upon interviews with leading
members of Congress who had made a
careful canvass of the House. Mr. Hunt
ington worked like a Trojan yesterday,
assisted by his corps of lobbyists. The
old gentleman is always an early riser,
but he broke the Sabbath at an earlier
hour than usual yesterday morning. His
apartments were soon thronged with his
lieutenants, end, after giving them orders,
they were sent scurrying in all directions.
He had half a dozen ex-members of Con
gress in his employ, including Philip B.
Thompson of Kentucky and Payson of
Illinois, who are the regular attorneys
here of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
These men are admitted to the floor of
the House as ex-members and the abuse
of this privilege has been the source of
comment for the past few days. The at
tention of the officers of the House was
called to the matter, but the brazen im
pudence cf these ex-Congressmen in going
upon the floor to lobby for Huntington
was allowed to pass unnoticed. Nor was
this the only outrage permitted by the
officers of the House, some of whom were
undoubtedly working in Mr. Hunting
ton's interest. John Boyd, the chief lieu
tenant of Huntington, was permitted to
enter the vestibule of the Speaker's lobby,
a privilege which should be jealously
guarded by the doorkeepers.
One of the House employes admitted to
The Call correspondent that several of
his colleagues had been offered money by
Mr. Huntington's agents. The railroad
magnate enlisted the services of several
newspaper men of Washington who were
supposed to have- influence with Congress
men. Many members of Congress who
have not yet returned from their Christ
mas holiday and who were known to be
favorable to the refunding bill were tele
graphed for on Saturday night by Hunt
ington's agents and were on hand this
morning.
The Call correspondent is reliably in
formed that Mr. Huntinyton's lobbyists
also enlisted the services of a corps of
female lobbyists. In former times the
female lobbyist was a familiar figure
about the Capitol and the petticoats were
important factors in shaping the legisla
tion of Congress. The gallery adjoin
ing the press reservation in the
House has for the past week been oc
cupied by women, who were, professedly,
"newspaper women," and it was observed
that they frequently sent cards from the
gallery to members of Congress. This in
itself wouid not have been suspicious but
for the fact that these same women wers
frequently seen in conversation with Mr.
Huntington's lobbyists. It may seem in
credible to many that Mr. Huntington
himself would resort to such tactics, bat
from personal observation The Call cor
respondent has no doubt that these
women were employed by Mr. Hunting
ton's agents.
When the House convened at noon to
day there was a large attendance of mem
bers on the floor. Both sides had summed
up its fuil strength. The galleries were
unusually well filled. The press gallery
was crowded with correspondents who
expected a lively and acrimonious debate
between uJdge Maguire and Grove L.
Johnson, but in this they were disap
pointed. Judge Maguire was "loaded" for
Johnson, and would have sought to pun
ish him for liis speech of last Friday, but
Speaker Reed decided that Johnson's
allusions to Judge Maguire in the debate
cf that day were not sufficient to entitle
the latter to recognition as a matter of
"Dersonal privilege." Maguire was thus
shut out again and Johnson was saved
from a roasting.
The Congressional Record will, how
ever, contain to-morrow morning Judj<e
Maguire'a "roast." Under the rules of
the House a member is permitted toÂ»"ex
tend His remarks in the Record."
When the funding bill was defeated to
day there was only a faint demonstration
of applause, for the resuit had le?n pre
dicted. Nevertheless, the opponents of
the bill were very ranch elated, and Judge
Maguire was soon surrounded by a throng
of friends and admirers, who congratu
lated him upon the successful outcome of
his gallant fight. Judge Maguire said to
The Call correspondent to-night:
"The large majority against the funding
bill was a surprise to both sides. We had
canvassed the situation very carefully,
and although we were confident of defeat
ing the bill, we placed our majority at
thirty votes. We lost four men on whom
we had relied, but gained a number from
members who were not only counted
against us last weeK, but who told us they
were for the bill. Tnen of the number
who were absent when our canvass was
made a large majority voted with us to
day. It was a great victoryâ greater than
we hoped for.
'General Harmon is absent from the
city to-night, but I will see him immedi
ately upon his return and endeavor to
press forward the legislation he reauests,
giving jurisdiction over the whole matter
to the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia, and enabling that court to stop
all proceedings in otuer courts that would
interfere with foreclosure, and to transfer
such scattered suits as may be pending in
the Circuit courts to the Court of Appsal3.
The chances are to-nignt more favorable
for a competing transcontinental road to
San Francisco than they have been for
thirty years. I intend to consult with
Senator Morgan to-morrow about urging
'he passage of the Attorney-General's
bill."
Senator White said to-nieht: "I think
the people of California are to be con
gratulated on the result. Tne Senate will
not have to waste its time now in a pro
tracted discussion of this bill. Ido not
think it will be resurrected again iv this
Congress."
Senator Gear, Chairman of the Pacific
Roads Commit'ee, said to-day that his
committee would in a few days consider
the advisability of framing a new and
more acceptable bill. Senator Frye, how
ever, is willing to let the whole matter go
to pot.
Chairman Powers of the House commit
tee said to The Call correspondent to
night ha could not determine whether a
new and more acceptable bill would be
brought forward at this session. Possibly
it would, but he would first await the de
cision of Speaker Reed ou his motion to
recommit the bill, against which motion
a point of order was raised by Dockery.
Assistant Attorney-General Russell,
when seen by The Call correspondent to
night, said foreclosure suits would be in
stituted as soon as possible. "In my
opinion Congress can legally declare for
feiture of the land granted and property
of the roads on the ground of 'condition
broken.' the companies not having met
their bonds at maturity, thus violating
the acts of 1862 which mado the grants."
IT IS BEST FOR ALL.
Union Pacific Receivers Talk About
the Fate of the Powers Re
funding Bill.
OMAHA, Nkbe., Jan. ILâ ' : The defeat of
the funding bill in the House of Repre
sentatives to-day is the beat for all con
cerned," said Frederic R. Couderl, one of
the Union Pacific receivers.
"I suppose," he added, "that the Presi
dent will now foreclose the mortgage and
the reorganization committee will act an
upset price on the property and buy it in.
The Government will be paid what it
should receive, thereby taking the load
from the shoulders of the Government
and getting the United States out of the
railroad business so far as the Pacific
roads are concerned. The defeat of the
bill will make it very much easier for the
reorganization committee to work and will
result, I belieye and trust, in a speedy
settlement of the Pacific roads difficulties. "
Receiver E. EUery Anderson of the
Union Pacific Railroad system when asked
for his opinion of the defeat of the Powers
funding bill said this afternoon:
"I was not favorably impressed person
ally with the bill. We have now spent
ten years talking over a settlement of the
debt and nothing has been accomplished.
1 think the Government should take some
steps looKing to the foreclosure of its mort
gages. It should try to arrange for a sat
isfactory bid, which I think could be suc
cessfully done. The parties holding the
rir*t lien will, I believe, be willing to make
a reasonable agreement to prevent the
property leaving their hands. I don't
mean that the Government's lien should
be sold for the price of the first mortgage
bondholders' offer, but use that, as an up
set price. 1 think the President should
take steps to exercise his power to fore
close."

amount in the first instance being $4000
and in the latter $11,743. There are two
petitions, and one of them discloses some
interesting facts relating to the investiga
tion of Receiver Oakes.
It develops that the expense of the pro
ceeding, the costs of wnich were taxed
against the Northern Pacific, amounted to
nearly $100,000. The suits filed by Colonel
McNautilit are The first to throw light
upon the great sums of money which
were paid to the attorneys in the Northern
Pacific litigation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1897.
(ILL BEADY FOR
THE BATTLE
Continued from First Page.
soon as the United States Senator is
elected the members will settle down to
the hard work of the session. The num
ber of appropriation bills already intro
duced and the number in process of hatch
ing will give the Finance Committee of
the Senate and the Ways and Means Com
mittee of the House an opportunity to
make a record for the protection of the
treasury.
Assemblyman Sig Bettman was circu

asking signatures in favor of the appoint

NONE FAVOR PERKINS.
Democrats and Populists Hold a
Union Caucus, but Fail to
Make a Selection.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 11.â There
have been attempts to get the minority,
consisting of Democrats and Populists, to
agree upon a joint candidate for United
States Senator. The first joint conference
was held on January 7, in Department 2,
Supreme Court room, with twenty-four
members in attendance. The meeting was
called to order by Senator Langford, chair
man of the minority, and, on motion of
Assemblyman Caminetti, Assemblyman
Dryden (Pop.) of San Diego was elected
chairman. W. T. Hamilton, clerk of the
minority, was elected secretary. After
discussing a proposition to hold a union
caucus to try to agree upon one candidate
it was finally agreed to have the secretary
circulate a call for a union conference to
be held January 11 at 5 p. m., and the
meeting adjourned.
The second meeting was held in De
partment 1, Supreme Court room, at 5
p. m. to-day, when the following thirty
three members were present: Senators
L& Rue, Doty, Seawell, Chapman, Braun
hart, Dwyer, Henderson, Hall and Prisk;
absent â Lungford, Feeny and Toner. As
semblymen Houghton, Foreman, Al
dridge, McClellan, Boone. Mead, Elliott.
McCandish, Shanahan, Sanford, Rubell,
Landsborough, McLaurin, Cartwright,
ToJand, Dryden, Keegan, Burnett, Mc-
Grath, Bridpeford, Dolan, Allen, Lacy,
Mahoney, Mulcreavy and Godirey; ab
sentâ Caminetti, Treacy, Emmons, Gate
ly, Power and Ryan.
Assemblyman Dryden was elected
chairman and W. T. Hamiltori secretary.
Assemblyman Shanahan (Pop.) was the
first speaker. He took the ground that it
was not possible, be thought, to agree
upon one man on the first ballot, as the
Populists would undoubtedly vote for T.
V. Cator, while the Democrats would want
to vote for a Democrat. He thought it
possible after the first ballot there might
be a union on one man. There was an
animated discussion participated in by
Dwyer, Keegan, Toland, Mead, Mahoney,
Boone, Houghton, Cartwrieht, McClellan,
Seawell and others, some favoring an in
formal vote on candidates and others op
posing it.
On suggestion of Assemblyman Keegan,
chairman of the Populist caucus, the
twelve Populists decided to withdraw, and
the conference adjourned. The twenty
one Democrats remained and organized
by electing Seawell chairman ana "VV. T.
Hamilton secretary although he protested
that he was a Populist. A motion was
unanimously adopted to hold a caucus of
the Democratic members of the Senate
and Assembly at 9 a. m. to-morrow, to try
to agree upon a silver Democrat as a can
didate for United States Senator.
Good feeling prevailed throughout the
debate in joint conference, but it was
clearly manifest in Mr. Caminetti'3 ab
sence that Assemblyman Keegan voiced
the feeling of both Democrats and Popu
lists that no one could think of voting for
Senator Perkins under any circumstances
after he had ridden in the procession here
with Congressman Grove L. Johnson, and
had spoken in his favor at ihe meeting
afterward, and now had the support of
the railroad Rscord-Union and the Exam
iner. Caminetti does not seem to be
warmly supported in his suggestion at the
meeting on January 7 that under certain
contingencies he might be willing to vote
for Perkins. At a meeting of the Populist
caucus held at 11 o'clock to-day at the
State House Hotel a strong sentiment
against Perkins was fully expressed. He
is not likeiy to receive a Populist vote
under any circumstances.
ARE FOR SHORTRIDGE.
Strong: Feeling In Oakland That a
Younger Man Than Perkins
Should Be Elected Senator.
OAKLAND, Ca'o., Jan. 11.â There is a
strong feelin? here that it would be bet
ter for this district if Senator Perkins
were succeeded by a younger and more
energetic man. During the past few
years several measures that have passed|the
House have been lost somewhere in the
Senate and it is generally felt that if good
work had been done in the Senate, Oak
land would have at least a good postoiiice
by this time.
"I know of no better man in the whole
of California to represent this State in
Congress than Samuel M. Shortridge,"
said Lin S. Church to-night. "I am not
alone in my judgment. Many hundreds
of people are of the same opinion in this
county. Mr. Shortridge is young, able,
eloquent ana fearless. He has proved bis
ability to come to the front and such men
should be encouraged."
An attempt was made to-day to make it
appear that Assemblyman Breiling had
been guilty of treachery because be stated
he is under no obligations to Senator Per
kins. Prior to election several interviews
from the leading men in his district were
published*, stating that if he pledged him
self to Perkins he could not have been
elected.
The same is true of Assemblyman Leav
itt. The manner in which the Perkins
people indecently treated Lenvitt, because
he had a plan to improve the water front,
will be remembered for a long time, and
whatever the young Ansensblyman may|do
no one can claim his vote on the Senator
ial question.
There are many who believe that As
semblyman North will not vote for Per
kins on a second ballot. Mr. North ex-
pressed great dissatisfaction with Perkins'
breach of faith in the Frick-Hilborn con
test, and it would not be a surprise if he
concluded he had paid his debt to Perkins
by voting for him on the first ballot.

IN THE ASSEMBLY.
Cutter Has a BUI to Reduce the
Salaries of Emp'oyes of State
Institutions.
SACRAMENTO, Cai,., Jan. 11.âAssem
blyman Belshaw was on his feet directly
the House opened to-oay with an explana
tion that $200 was required for the pur
pose of telegraphing the anti-funding reso
lutions to Congress, it being necessary
that each Congressman and Senator
should receive a copy.
Telegrams from Washington announc
intr the defeat of the funding bill were read
amid applause. *
Assemblyman Cotter offered a bill pro
viding for a reduction of 25 per cent in the
salaries of those employed in tne various
State institutions.
The eulogies upon the late Cyrus Coie
man, which were made special oraer for
to-day at Friday s session, were then
heard, as were also tributes to the mem
ory of the late Lieutenant-Governor Mill
iard.
In the neighborhood of fifty bills were
introduced in the Assembly this after
noon. Guy had his share of them, sub
mitting about thirty, of which the most
were for appropriations. Some ot them
are as follows: Examiner $4876, deficiency
for calling out the National Guard $728,
for funeral of Lieutenant-Governor Mil
lard $1102, expense revising codes $1221,
claim of Denis Jordan $03,000, Daily Re

lhe south was equally productive, but
the bills did not run to appropriations.
Morehouse introduced a bill to estab
lish and support a department of labor,
also one to increase the number of Judges
in Santa Clara County from two to three.
Perhaps the most important bill
was the one introduced by Sea
well for governing the transporta
tion of insane from the counties from
which they have been committed. This
will be fought by the Sheriffs all over the
State. The bill provides that agents shall
be maintained by the asylums, who will
conduct patient* to the asylums.

Opening cf a Brilliant Tournament
at Madison Square.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 11.â A mili
tary athletic and bicycle tournament to
aid the raising of funds for the endow
ment of a hospital ward for National
Guardsmen was opened to-night at Madi

in the boxes many well-known society
leaders were noticed.

Governor Biack's staff in full uniform en
tered the ga'den. Closely following came
Governor Cook's staff from Conuecticut
and then the New Jersey staff in escort to

the boxes were prominent military men
of National and local fame, including
Generals Miles and Ruger, United States
army.
After the athletic and track events,
mostly participated in by National
Guardsmen, came the military pro
gramme. The first event was the appear
ance of Lieutenant Butts' crack company
from the Thirteenth Regiment, United
States Army regulars.
To the tune of a march by the Twenty
first Infantry band the crack infantry
men came upon the scene at double quick.
They made a beautiful movement and
lined up in a column before Lieutenant-
Governor Woodruff's box.
The Lieutenant-Governor responded to
the pretty compliment by a neat
speech.
Mr. Woodruff in a few well-chosen
woid* stated the object of the great car

Hanna of the National committee has ac
cepted an invitation to be a guest of honor
at the seventh annual banquet of the
Hamilton Club at the Auditorium Hotel

he overlooked an important business en
pa ement in Cleveland to-day, which pre
vented his presence.
Instead Mr. Hanna sent a letter to Pres
ident Frank I. Moulton of the club, which
was reaa to the 200 Republicans from

STRONG PLEA FOR
LUIS SOMEILLAN
Incisive, Forcible Argu
ment of Counsel for
the Prisoner.
For Three Hours He Makes a
Vigorous Effort Against
Conviction.
Consul -General L-e Is Present ani
Watches the Proceedings
Closely.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. ILâ The trial of
Luis Someiilan, the naturalized American
citizen, who is charged with conspiring
against the Spanish Government, was
continued to-day, the court opening at 1
o'clock this afternoon, the usual hour.
Consul-General Lee, who was prevented
by oflical business from being present at
Saturday's proceedings when the prosecu
tion closed its case, was in attendance to
day closely watching the proceedings in
the interest of the accused.
Counsel for tbe defense made a speech
that occupied three hours. It was full of
incisive, forcible arguments to prove that
Someillan's innocence had been demon
strated by tbe testimony of the witnesses.
He declared emphatically that the charge
against the prisoner was groundless and
contended that it had been conclusively
shown that he had no connection with the
Cuban junta or with any of the rebels.
Nothing had been adduced at the trial
to justify the assertion that the cipher
message on which the charge was based
was intended for Someillan personally.
Counsel contended that even if his client's
guilt had been admitted, which had not
been done, the law provided that he be
sentenced to eight years' confinement and
not to imprisonment for life, as the prose
cutor had asked.
Though lacking in eloquence the speech
was vigorous, and created the impression
that tne case is one of mistaken identity.
The court then adjourned to consider
its verdict.
Captain-General Weyler has issued an
other edict ordering the formation of
zones of cultivation around the towns in
the province oi Matanzas similar to those
recently ordered in the provinces oi Hav
ana and Finar del Rio.
A large and enthusiastic crowd cheered
the Marquis Apezteeuit, the leader of the
Constitutional party, as he was leaving
for Spain yesterday. He was escorted to
the steamer by General Weyler, the local
authorities, citizens and local organiza
tions.
JUOXJSI JtEIUKXS JFROM CUBA.
Convinced 5 hat Spain Can A'eter Bup
prÂ»Â«Â« thfi Insurrection.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 11.âSena
tor-elect Hernando de Soto Money of Mis
sissippi, who has jnst returned from Cuba,
says tbat the rebels will win. Money
says:
I went there to personally inform myself,
for my own guidance, as a member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, as to the
condition of things in the island. The ac
counts have been so conflicting and the re
ports from Havana so diverse, that I concluded
to make some personal discovery of the mat
ter myself. There is nothing .that I learned
which the public should not know.
At the very outset I will say that everything
I saw and heard taught me that Spnin is un-
able to cope with this insurrection. She will
never put it down. Spain will never end this
war with victory to herself.
I nsked General Weyler what hi 3 opinion
was of the attitude of the United States.
"1 realize," he answered, "that the people
of the United States sympathize with the in
surgents, but with the administration at
Washington there can be no complaint. It has
kept faith with Spain."
"You have, then, no complaint to make of
the action ot the Government as a friendly
neutral iv this contest?" was asked.
"No complaint whatever," was the reply.
"It is of course to the interest of the United
States that the war should be ended and Span
ish supremacy in Cuba restored as soon as
possible, as the commerce of your country
with the island has suffered a great deal, and
all the United States has made from the war
was the sale of a battle-ship armor."
In explanation of wnat Weyler intends,
touching the provinces of Havana and Matan
zas and the cleaning out of the insurrection
there preparatory to his coming declaration
that they are "pacified." I will say that he Is
at once arranging to withdraw some 25,000 to
30,000 of the 40,000 soldiers from his trocha
and send them into these provinces. They
are expected to drive out the rebels.
Corjsul-General Fi'.zhugh Lee has sent
the following message to Secretary Olney:
I am more firmly convinced than ever that
Spain cannot put down the insurrection, and
that every day it continues means loss of life
and property, without the remotest encour
agement of any final Spanish success. As I
long since said, the insurrection will succeed.
My judgment to that effect receives daily con
firmation.
United States Minister Taylor at Madrid
has warned Spain tbat unless there are
clear and reasonable terms as the basis of
peace in Cuba before President Cleveland
goes out of office, the question of local
self-government on the island would soon
disappear from American politics, and the
only question to remain would be the im
mediate and unconditional recognition of
the independence of the Cuban republic.
rOZICE A.M) SOLDlliliS CLASH.
Clubt and Bayonet* Uied on Txco Veca-
aion* nt Sprinqfl-ltl.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 11.âPolice
men and soldiers clashed on two occa
sions to-day. Tbe fiist trouble took place
about 9 o'clock this morning and the last
pbout 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The
Second Regiment of Chicago was mixed
up in both rows and some of the Fifth
Regiment had a handÂ»ir. the trouble.
Clubs and bayonets were used Ireely in
the last combat and the policemen ha i
to threaien to shoot before order was ie
stored. Several police officers were struck
with bayonets, out the wounds ihey re
ceived were slight. A few of the soldiers
were beaten with policemen's clubs and
they will undoubtedly be nursing sore
beads when they arrive home.
FOR THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO.
Charles Emory Smith of Philadelphia Said
to Be a Cho.cs for a Place
in the Cabinet
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 11.â The politi
cians here are busy with the report to
night that Charles Emory Smith of
Philadelphia is likely to be appointed Sec
retary of the Treasury.
Not since Mr. Dingley's name was first
mentioned for this place has there been
so much local interest in the gossip con
cerningr it. Color is given the rumor
about Mr. Smith by hi 3 well-known stand
ing with the President-elect, and it is re
called that he came by invitation to Can
ton several times during the campaign. â¢
Major McKinley expressed admiration \
for Mr. Smith's speeches and writings oni
financial topics, and doubtless heard many,'
good reports of bi3 work on the stump
during the campaign. It is believed to
night that Mr. Smith is the foremost pos
sibility for the treasury portfolio.
Charles Emory Smith was Minister to
Russia under the Harrison administration
and is well known as an editor and as a
speaker and writer on economic subjects.
Major McKinlev returned from Cleve
land at 1:30 this afternoon.
RUBBER* AT ARBUCKLE.

COLUSA, Cal.. Jan. 11.â A band of
drunken hobos entered the home of Con
stable J. 3. Smith at Arbuckle last night
and finding Mrs. Smith alone choked her

shoes and a part of a hog that had just
been butchered. Next they made a raid
on the American Hotel, and succeeded in
getting away with a sack of sugar, a sack
of flour and an overcoat. They left town
and proceeded to the home of rancher
Shellheamer and became so abusive that
Shellheamer, with the assistance of sev
eral of his workingmen, arrested them,
took them back to Arbuckle and lodged
them in jail. _

In a letter from Mrs. Chas. Knicker-

tion with the celebrated cook book entitled
"Gleanings from Home and Field" is well
known, she was kind enough to say by let-
ter to the Postrm Cereal Co., Lim., of Bat-

something to take the . place of coffee in
your 'Posium Cereal.' You have a good
thing that thousands of people have been

the place of coffee, which to them is poi-

give up. I SDeak from experience."
Mrs. Glass of Spencer, lowa, writes:
"Our grocer has ordered the Postum Cer-
eal from Dcs Moines and we like â it > well,

"It is meat and drink to|our bodies and

WASHINGTON. D.C, Jan. ll.â During
the morning business in the Senate to-day â¢
Perkins (R.) of California presented the
joint resolution of the California L-gisia
ture declaring unalterable opposition to
any extension of the deb. of the Pacific
railrcad companies, favoring immediate
collection of the debt and asking for a
! earing before the Pacific Railroads Com
mittee. The resolution vras read in full
ana was, on motion of White (D.) of Cali
fornia, ordered to be printed in the Record
and referred to the Pacific Railroads Com
niftte-.
Senate joint resolution authorizing the
Secretary of the Treasury to solicit pro
posals and to contract; for the erection ai
a Government building at the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition without public ad
vertisement was introduced by Bate (D.)
of Tennessee and passed.
n (Pop.) of Nebraska offered a reso-
Icton with regard to the violation of tae
eight-hoar law by contractors under the
Navy Department, specifying particularly
the work on the navy hospital at Brook
lyn.
--r.dier (R.) of New Hampshire de
clared that there was no law that prohib
ited contractors for Gavernment work
from employing men for more than eight
hours a day.
The resolution being objected to went
ovÂ»Â»r until to-morrow.
Oa motion of Hoar (R.) of Massachu
setts the House bill to establish a uniform
law on the subject of bankruptcy through
oat the United States was made the spe
cial order for Monday, January 23.
In pursuance of notice j^iven last weec
Proctor (R.) oi- Vermont, who had just
returned from a visit to tne President
elect, Kdires--ed the Senate in advocacy of
his proposed constitutional amendments
to make the Presidential term six years
â with a prohibition of re-election, and to
make the term of Representatives in the
lower House three years. The reasons
given fay him were these:
First â A longer Presidential term and in
elislDiiity for re-election are more in accord
with the ideas and purposes of the traders of
the constitution than Â»a the present system, as
it has if oped practical results.
Sscond â proposed change is not radical
or revolutionary, bat la in the line of true con
servatism. It is a change of the letter to
preserve the spirit of the constitution.
Thirdâ Re-eiigibiluy i.Â» wrong in theory and
vicious in practice, for it results in the use of
j-atronage of this office by the President for the
promo for his chances of re-election, or
else subjects him to the imputation of such
Use. - Â«
Foa^th â -he change will more thoroughly
(TiVorce- tlie Wiu.Atlvi Sad executive branches
of t !: â : Government an end most strongly desired
by thÂ« constitutional convention. â 
Fifihâ Even if the present system -was wise
in the beginning, toe changed conditions, tne
growth of the country in population, es
pecially in cities, the great increase in oar
territory and the growing danger of sudden
popular revulsions make the change desira
ble.
..âThereby the business interests of the
country will be saved from such frequent dis
turbances aud the time and expense incident
to csmDaigns will be proportionately reduced.
Seventh â By lengthening the terms of .Repre
sentatives to three years, law* urill be better
considered, and will hare a longer - and fairer
trial before their friends go oat of power in
Cone:
At the conclusion of his remarks, Proc
tor rnovea that the resolution be referred
to the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions, but as Stewart (P.) of Nevada desired
to speak on the subject, the resolution
was permitted to lie on the table.
Mills (D.) of Texas then addressed the
Senate in support of the joint resolution
introduced by him las: Tuursday, in toe
course of which he said :
'â On the 18th of December last the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
agreed to report a joint resolution recog
nizing the independence of the republic
of Cuba. On the morniug of the 19th a
statement was made by authority of the
Secretary of State challenging the author
ity of Congress to deal with that question.
1 propose to meet this contention. It ;s
an extraordinary contention, and this is
the second time in ths history of the re
public that it has been presented. When
it was first presented it met witn a signal
rebuke, and I doubt no: that it wili meet
with the sarce reouke now. Where tbe i
distinguished Secretary of State obtains !
his authority 1 do not know."
Ttie Senator epitomized the course of af
fairs wi;ich led up to tue recognition of
the Spanish- American coionies'by Presi
dent Monroe to siow that, the subject was
le.t to the discretion of Cong .ess. He also
gave a history of the recognition or the
Republic of Texas, ia wnicu President!
Ja-kson co-operated with Congress, saying
taat the auestion was one of expediency
and should be left to Congress.
Gray (D.) 6f Delaware read an ndJi
tional seutence from 'he message of Presi- '
dent Jackson in relation to Texas in these j
words: "In Â»his view, on the ground of
expediency, I am disposed to concur; anl
I do not therefore consider it necessary to
express any opinion as to the strict cou
ttitatioaal right of the executive."
Milsâ The first sentence embraced the
whole 'eitâ that it was a question of ex
pediency.
Mills proceeded with his areument and
referred to the resolution offered in the
Senate by Hubert J. Walker, iiwn a Sen
ator from Mississippi, tor the recognition
of Texas.
Kale (R.) of Maine asked Mills whether
t;ut resolution contained an assertion of
the independence of Texas or whether it
was only an expression of opinion that it
should be reco<jr.
Mills remonstrated against interruptions
which inter ered with tte trend of his ar
pun;ent. He said that he would not stop
to discuss the question of taste of the
present Secretary ot State in declaring to
:he world that Congress had no authority
io do what was proposed and that if Cou
gress did --o it would produce disaster.
Morgan (D.) of Alabamaâ On in? ques
tion of ta^te, nave you examined the re
port of Henry Winter Davis from the
House Committee on Foreign Aff?ir3 in
regard to the establishment of a monarchy
in Mexico?
Mills said he had got that report before
him and woaid refer to it. He recalled
tUe instructions given to Mr. Clayton,
Secretary of S:ate under President Tay
icr. to tne aeent sent to report on the
Hungarian revolution in 1845. One of the
sentences in these instructions read:
'Should the new Government prove to be
tirm and stable, ;he Presdent will cheer
lu.ly recommend ro Congress the recogni
! ion of Huns^rr."
Mills also recalled the resolution adopted
unanimously by the House of Representa
tives condemning the action of Secretary
beward in instructing Mr. Dayton, Ucited
fctates Minister to France,that theadmin
istraton of Mr. Lincoln did not propose
abandoning its policy in reference to the
French army in Mexico; and he read ex
tacts from the report of Henry WiDter
Davis condemning that assumption of Mr.
Seward as equally novel and intolerable.
That report, he said, had been voted for
by Mr. Morrili, now Senator from Ver
mont, and by Mr. Allison, now Senator
from lowa, and soon to be, if public ru
mor was to be believed, Secretary of State
himself, and a more capable one, Mr.
Mills added, "cannot be found within the
United States." ,
Mi Is went.on to criticize the President
for declining to recognize the republic of
Cuba, because it had nu cities or towns or
courts, and did not collect taxes, and said
that the report of Mr. Money of Missis
sippi shoved that the Cubans collected
taxes from Captain-General Weyier him
self. There was a government there and
in full operation, and yet the President
says that the time has not come for recog
nition, although two-thirds of the terri
tory of Cuba is in the hands of the in
surgents.
"It he had said nine-tenths," Mr. Mills
added. "tie would have been more correct.
The whole course of the President and of
tne administration has been to strengthen
the rower of Spain and to hasten the hour
for the destruction of the insurrection in
Cuba. Ido not know where the President
got the idea that thrs recognition of bellig
erency is no longer urged, he added, with
a most scornful expression." The speaker
then continued:
It may be possible that boards of trade, the
stock exchanges, the commercial clubs in the
great exporting cities on the Atlantic seaboard
and in the Northwest have access to his ear
and give him that information. They say:
"Business is just reviving, and now you are
going to destroy it again. You want to bring
on war. What have we got to do with Cuba.
We are making money now. Let us alone."
â  It is this mercantile spirit in the country
that is tignting against its honor. The Presi
dent speak? in his message of what we owe to
Spain. We owe no duty to despots, except un
der treaties, and Spain has persistently re
fused to comply with its treaty obligations.
We owe a duty to these poor people of Cuba â
Cuba in chains; Cuba under sentence of life
condemnation. We say to Cuba ''You cannot
go to England, which would protect you; you
cannot go to Germany, which is ready to take
you; you canco: go to France; you must stay
in your dungeon until Spain shoots you to
death."
In a war in which the motto is "Indepen
dence or extermination" we are throwing all
the power of the administration in the in
terest of the monarchy Spain. If I had the
power which the President has I would call
upon Congress to authorize me to take the
armed frigates of the Government to Havana
and I would protect the people of the United
States or I would reduce those fortresses to
j mortar and ruin. Would to God that we had
one hour of Commodore Ingraham or of Presi
dent Franklin Pierce In these days! I would
make the atmosphere smell of sulphur for a
month. [Laughter,]
Further along in his speech Mill* com
mented scorniully on the threats of
interference of foreign Governments and
said :
Are we going to be scared by the tremendous
army ot Italy? Signor Crisp; has declared that
Ita.y would regard our recognition of the in
dependence of CUDa as a very serious compli
cation of foreign affairs. Who is Signor Crispi?
There was a day when the Roman name was
acknowledged throughout the whole earth ; but
that day has passed, and the symbol of power
of Italy to-day is a monkey and an organ
grinder. [Laughter in the galleries.] .
Now, if Signor Crispi takes offense at the
action, of Congress, if in conjunct.on with
Spain he is disposed to make â  holy alliance,
lei them come with their monkeys and organ
grinders and their not tamales. [Laughter.]
This Government is too great to sit uader a.
threat of all the allied powers of the earth.
Mr. Mills proceeded:
El Premier Castelar has complimented
the President of the United States. Ido
not envy that man's compliment?. His
bands are besmeared with the bioo i of
fiity-seven innocent American citizens,
who were executed while he was chief ex
ecutive of Spain, who were executed with
out a trial, and who died asking the ques
tion which Saul of Tarsus asked the nigh
priest, 'Is it lawful to scourge a Roman
citizen?' God grant that the day may
come when this great martial President
may once more be relieved from the man
acles of the commercial spirit of the
country.
Mills closed with more invectives
against the President. He was followed
by Hale of Maine, who gave the votes in
tne Senate on the Robert J. Walter reso
lution as to Texas, showing that it was
only by a tie vote that it escaped being
laid on the tabie, whereas in the House it
was laid on the tab c.
Allen (Pop.) of New York asked Hale
whetner he believed tiiat the power to
recognize foreign governments lay in the
executive exclusively, and Haie replied in
tne amrmative. He admitted, however,
that in incidental matters connected with
recognition, such as tbe sending of a
Minister, the action of Congress was
necessary.
Hoar (R. ) of Massachusetts asked Hale
whether in his researches of history for
the last hundred years he had found a
single instance where recognition bad not
! been determined by the President of the
' United States, without action by Con
gress, and Haie replied in the negative.
After further discussion 'on tae question
of recognition Mill*' resolution went over
without action, Bacon giving notice that
he wouid address the Senate upon it next
Wednesday.
The Senate then proceeded to executive
business, and at .5:10 adjourned.

Mr. Doane. "The property soid for ex

"'There is some trouble with the Utah

necessary so that the headquarters will be

that the name of ths company is to be

tree list.
Ex-Mayor Schieren of Brooklyn filed a
paper protesting against any increase in

were not Astors. Mr. Grubey replied:
"No, and there wilt be less AÂ«tors here if

BIG MONETARY CONFERENCE.
Nearly All of the Two Hundred Delegates
Are at Indianapolis and Ready
lor Bus nsss.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ijtd., Jan. ILâ The
hotel corridors to-night present much the
Â»ame appearance as on the eve of a
National political convention. Delegates
with badges of the monetary conference
pinned to their coats push in and out of
the crowds that throng the lobbies. Men
gather in groups, earnestly discussing the
problems that they have come here to
help solve.
Instead of professional politicians, how
ever, those present are heads of commer
cial houses and mostly merchants and im
porters, railroad presidents and bankers â
men of importance and high standing in
the community whicn they represent.
Boards of Trade and Chambers of Com
merce in 200 cities have appointed dele
gates. Nearly half of the 400 delegates
wtio are expected have arrived. The
gathering is non-partisan. There is no
cut-and-dried programme and no man
can tell what will be the outtome of the
deliberations which will be begun to-mor
row and continue two or three days.
The conference will follow tne lines of a
regular convention. It will be called to
order at 2p. M. The Hon. E. O. Stanard,
ex-Governor of Missouri, will be tem
porary chairman, and C. Stuart Patterson,
deanÂ«f the University of Pennsylvania,
will be permanent presiding officer.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee to-day it was decided to recommend
the appointment of committees on creden
tials, permanent organization and resolu
tions. To the latter committee ail papers
and propositions will be referred, and
only a limited time will be permitted to a
delegate to state the substance of his prop
osition. This will save the conference
from listening to a number of lengthy es
says on currency revision, and prevent
interminable debate.
During the deliberations of the commit
tees there will be a<J dresses by such rep
resentative men as Charies S. Fairchiid,
ex-Secretary of the Treasury; Congress
man Walker of the House Committee on
Banking and Currency and others.
Tne consensus of opinion among the
delegates who are here is that it will be
impossible to digest the whole subject of
carrency reform during the time of the
present convention and that the wisest
plan will be to make a declaration of gen
eral principles and appoint a non-partisan
representative committee to formulate a
legislative plan or to art in conjunction
with a committee of Congress in drawing
up the legislation.
ZAJiD FUJt EFEJtT ONE.
! Remarkable Bill to Be Introduced in the
Kansas Legislature.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 11.â A Topeka
special to a morning paper say?: Chief
Justice Frant Doster, who will be in
ducted into office to-day, will endeavor to
enact his famous campaign theory into
law. He declared upon the stump that
"the rights of the voter are paramount to
the rights of the owner." <
Judge Doster's lav partner, Henry
Lean, has drafted a remarkable bill, which
will be introduced early in the session- It
will provide that no one shall own more
land than a homestead if any person de
sires to purchase any additional tract 3of
land. For example, Farmer Jones owns
and lives on a farm ana is also owner of a
farm which he rents. Farmer Smith, who
has no homestead, can go to Jones and
make him a teniier ot a reasonable sum of
money for the ad iitional tract of land.
If Jonas declines Soiitn's tender Smith
can go into the courts and the jury will fix
the price, which if below the sum ten
dered, then Jones must pay t..e costs. If
more then Smith pays the costs of the
suit. This bili, if it becomes a law, will
absolutely prevent the ownership of a
large tract of land by one individual.

Did Mot Engage in a Deal That Caused
â  the Itxnmind Match Failure.
OMAHA, Xebr , Jan. 11.â John W.
Doane, one of the receivers of the Union
Pacific, was last week re-elected president
of ihÂ» Merchants' Loan and Trust Com
pany of Chicago, which position he de
clined to fccept. At that time it
was reported that while the president
of that corporation he had been "a
hea7y borrower from the funds of the
company and that he was also involved in
the deal which caused the sensational
failure of the Diamond Match Company
last summer. To-day Mr. Doane said that
there was not the slightest truth in the
latter report, nor so far as he was aware
the slightest foundation for such a story.
He said that he bad been re-elected presi
j dent of the company ana for personal rea
sons declined the position. He. had tele
graphed his refusal from Omaha while he
was here last weeic. he emphatically de
nied th:Â«i: he bad been a borrower from the
company's funds or that he had been in
any way connected with the failure of the
Diamond Match Company. He added
that a correction of the erroneous reports
I had been made in Chicago.

Altgeld's Farewell Address Ruled Out
by the Managers â Inaugurals
in Other States.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. ILâ The
only novelty in the inauguration function
at the capital to-day was the departure
from custom in preventing ex-Governor
John P. Altgeld from delivering a 4000
--word address, which he had prepared for
the occasion and was on the point of be
ginning, when a Republican motion to
adjourn the joint assembly was declared
carried by Speaker Curti3.
Immediately after the announcement
of the chair that John R. Tanner was
Governor of Illinois, Senator J. Sfahoney
(D.) offered a resolution that the retiring
Governor be invited to speak after Gov
ernor Tanner had delivered his address.
This was done because the Democratic
members had learned that the programme
of the Republican managers of the in
auguration ceremonies did not include a
farewell address by Mr. Altgeid. The
president of the Senate, to whom the mo
tion was addressed, referred it to Speaker
Curtis, who was in charge of the joint
session, but the Speaker refused to enter
tain it at that time.
This interjection in tte set ceremony
caused a ripple of excitement among the
bis assemblage. Senator Mahoney said
privately that Speaker Curtis had informed
him that there would not be time for Mr.
Altgeid to speak. The trouble was allowed
to subside for an hour by the deliveiy of
Governor Tanner's address in a hoarse,
broken voice, from type-written manu
script. Uis address was not audible to
many.
At the conclusion of the Governor's
speech. Representative Xppe (R.) nidved
the adjournment of the Assembly. Cries
of "No!" "Shame!" "Dirty politics!" ana
other remarks were heara throughout the
Hall of Representatives, but Speaker Cur
tis promptly declared the motion carried,
refusing to notice Mr. Maboaey, Mr. Alt
zeld, who had occupied a prominent posi
tion on the stage, with the manuscript of
his speech in his hand, turned a little pale
and then red, smiled sarcastically at his
successor, pocfceted his speech and left
the stage.
Governor Tanner and his colleagues
were inducted into office with much pomp
and parade, largely military, which occu
pied thirty blocks. The head of the parade
moved at 10 o'clock. Chief Marshal J. N.
Recce bad promised that it should outdo
everything of a similar character in the
history of the State capital, and it did.
There was a division of military that took
an hour to pass, a detachment of "sound
money" advocates from Chicago, the ma
chine aad its henchmen in carriages down
to the third and fourth generation, Grand
Army posts. Sons of Veterans, Patriarchs
Militant, Uniformed Rank Knights of
Pythias, and marching clubs from all
parts of the State.
There was a ball at the Capitol in the
evening.
JEFFERSON" CITY, Mo.. Jan. IL-At
noon to-day Chief Justice Barclay of the
Supreme Court administered the oath of

in the Hall of Representatives in this
city. The exercises, which were exceed
ingly simple and devoid of display, were
attended by the various State officers,
members of the Supreme Court anu
prominent Democratic politicians through
out the State. The Governor in his ad
dress indorses the "fellow-servant" bill,
as recommended in the State platform;
suggests improvements in the Australian
ba.lot; advises taxation on public fran
chise;, and asks that the office of Bank
Commissioner be created.

ANGLO-AMERICAN ARBITRATION.
Treaty Signed at Washington and Trans
mitted to the Senate With a Message
From the President.
WASHINGTON, D.'C, Jan. 11.â The
arbitration treaty between Great Britain
and the United States was signed in the
State Department this afternoon, and the
President sent the following message to
the Senate in transmitting the document:
To the. Senate: I transmit herewith a treaty
for the arbitration ot all matters of difference
between the United States and Great Britaiu.
The provisions of the treaty are the result of
iong and patient deliberation and represent
concessions made by each party tor the sake of
agreement upon the general (Jubesne. Though
the result reached may not meet the views of
the advocates of immediate, unlimited and
irrevo^aDle arbitration of all international
controversies, tt is nevertheless confidently
believed that the treaty canuot fail to be
everywhere recognized as matins a long step
in the rignt direction and as embodying a
practical working plan by which disputes
between the two countries will reach a peace
ful adjustment as a matter of course and in
ordinary routine.
In the initiation of such an important move
ment it must be expected that some of its
features will assume a tentative character,
looking to a further advancement, and yet it
is apparent that the treaty which has oeen
formulated not only makes war between the
parties to it a remote possibility, but pre
cludes those fears and rumors ot war which
of tnemselvps too often assume the propor
tions ot a National disturbance.
It is eminently fitting, as well as fortunate,
that tne attempt to achieve results so benefi
cent fhouUi be initiated by kindred peoples,
speaking the Â»me longue and joined by all
tne ties of common traditions, common insti
tutions and common aspirations. The experi
ments oi substituting civilized methods for
brute force as the means of settling interna
tional questions of right wilt thus be tried
under tne happiest auspices. Its success ought
not to doubtful, and the fact that its ultimate
ensuing beceflts are not likely to be limited to
the two countries immediately concerned
should cause it to be promoted ail the more
eagerly. The example set and the lesson fur
nished by the successful operation of this
treatj.are sure to be felt and taken to heart
sooner or later by other nations, and will thus
mark the beginning of a new epoch in civiliza
tion.
Profoundly impressed, as I am, therefore, by
the promise of srood which this treaty affords,
I do not hesitate to accompany its transmis
sion with an expression of my earnest hope
thut it may commend itself to the favorable
consideration of the Senate.
Gbover Cleveland.
Executive Mansion, January 11, 1897.
The proposed treaty consists of thirteen
articles and covers twenty pages of the
special paper on which all conventions
are spread for original signature. Each
copy is clearly written in legible manu
script without flourishes, the only orna
mentation consisting of the red, white
and blue twisted cord with which ail
State Department documents are held
together.
It was shortly after 12 o'clock to-day
when the British Embassador reached
the State Department with Viscount
Gough, one of his secretaries. He had
earlier in the morning received a final
cablegram from Lord Salisbury authoriz
ing the signature, and had made an ap
pointment with Secretary O'ney for con
summating the negotiations. Tne Secretary
promptly met Sir Julian in the diplo
matic room on his arrival, and the two
plenipotentiaries immed ately presented
their credentials to each other. Secretary
01 ney signed as designated by the Presi
dent of the United States, ami Julian
Paunceiote signed as designated by the
Queen on behalf of Great Britain.
The formalities having been completed,
the fc-ecretary and Sir Julian shook nands,
congratulating each other, and the British
representative returned to the embassy,
taking his copy of the document with
him. The "copy" was immediately sent
over to the Executive Mansion and de
livered to the President, who a moment
later sent it to toe Senate with a message
for its ratilication.
DEBS GOING TO LEADVILLE.
Says If Organized Labor Is Broken Up
in Colorado the Miners Will Simply
Be Con nets.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. ILâ Eugene V.
Debs passed through the city to-day
en route to Leadville to investigate the
miners' strike which has been in progress
tnere for the past five months.
"I desire," he said, "to look over the
military company which has been main
tamed against the miners to see how much
force has been considered necesssry to
keep the miners in order. In the East
we have heard that over 2000 men were
kept there, bat I am informed here that
tnere never has been over 957 soldiers in
camp. My conviction is that the miners'
stand is wholly one to maintain wages.
No laboring man upholds violent mea
sures and I do not believe that the Lead
ville miners, the body of them, were in
terested in the attack.
'â¢In so far as tne miners seek a peaceful,
lawful way to maintain wages they ought
to be supported by every class of organized
labor. Every wage worker is vitally in
terested in the result. It is my impression
that the men will win, for the mine owners
cannot operate with the men they have
taken in. I do not know that this is a
move 10 break up lab >r organizations, but
I am satisfied if they can break up the
organization here it will be the initial
step. Break up organized labor in
Colorado and the miners will soon be in
the condition of the Pennsylvania coal
miners. They will simply be convicts."

An Acting Consul-General and Several
Military Officers Among the
V.ctims.
LONDON, Esq., Jan. 11.â A dispatch
from tionny, on the coast of Upper
Guinea, reports the massacre of all the
members of a peaceful British expedition,
which left the coast about January 1, in
tend ins to proceed to Benin City, on the
Benin River, by way of Sapele. The ex
pedition consisted of Acting Consul-Gen
eral Phillips, Major Copeland Crawford,
Captain Boisragen, who was in command
of the force of the Niger Coast protec
torate; Captain Maling, belonging to the
same force; Messrs. Campbell and Locke,
consular officials; Dr. Elliott, Messrs.
Powis and Gordon, civilians, and a num
ber of Kroonien and native cairiers.
The yacht Ivy, belonging to the British
Consul has returned to Bonny and reports
that the entire expedition were killed by
tne subjects of the King of Benin, which
territory is included in the Niger coast
protectorate.
A scanty unofficial report of the affair
wh;c â¢; nas reached the forein office says
that the members of the expedition were
captured and not killed. The foreign
office deprecates the assumption that they
â¢vere massacred until official advices shall
have been received. It is stated that the
expedition was not armed and it is likely
it has fallen a victim to some of the
wild tribes infesting the borders. It is
probable that the King of Benin will not
be involved in the matter.

Presbyterian Y*ung Ladies Resolve
to G.ve Careworn Moth?rs
an Hour of Respite.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 11.âEman
uÂ«l Presbyterian Church of this city, of
which Rev. Dr. Chichester is pa?tÂ«r, will
soon institute an innovation as novel a? it
is practical. The pronunciamento has
gone forth that there shall be no more
crying babies in Emannel Church. "Suf
fer little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not" is not to be altogether
disregarded, as rright appear at first
glaiice, but the strong-lunged infants of
the congregation are going to have sepa
rate provision made for them. They will
be cared for by the Young Ladies' Auxil
iary League of the church while their
motners attend services.
The members of the Laajjue have deter
mined to make the Sunday kindergarten
a part of their regular duties. The idea
has since been adopted by other churches,
aid is said to be a worthy innovation, as
it permits many mothers to attend church
who would otherwise be debarred from
that eracious privilege.
The youn-< ladies will provide quarters
for the lusty vouiigsters in some room of
theedifice. There tuey will amuse their
iittie charges and keep them contented
and happy until the pastor concludes his
lastly and tue "Doxology ' has been sung.
Lveryihnig will d? done to deprive the
little ones stay at the house of worship of
monotony and at the same fme rermit
their mothers to listen in peace to the
pastor's exportation.
TO SPAN THE CONTINENT.
Los Angeles Man Believes the Valley Road
Will Ccnrect With an Eastern
System.
LOS ANGELE?, Cal., Jan. 11.-Secre
tary Knight of the Merchants' and Mana
facrurers' Assoiiation of this city h3s
given the subject of railroad construction
in California careful attention during the
past three years. Anent the sale of the
Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern
Railway at Salt Lake City last Saturday,
Mr. Knight said to a Call correspondent
to-day:
"It is believed that the sale of the
Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern
Railroad on Saturday, together with the
Southern Utah branch, extending 220
miles southwesterly to Milford, means
much to Los Angeles and Southern Cali
fornia, la the at proacning reorganiza
tion of the Union Pacific road, it now
stems highly probable that the great
trunk line will pass under the control of
the Vanderbilt system. The Vanderbilt
lines and connections will then extend
from the Atlantic Ocean to Salt Late City.
"The new owners of the Utah Southern
are said to be friendly to the Vanderbilt
interest. Indeed, th? road was probably
purchased for the Varde'biits. Does it
seem reasonable that c c Vanderbilt syn
dicate has been scheming and investing
millions of capital to terminate their al
most transconinental system at the little
village of Milford, when the construction
of a short gap of about 400 miies over easy
grades would enable the company to reach
Los Angeles, and thus have a real ter
minus at the end of a complete transcon
tinental system?
"But another significance attaches to
the extension of the Utah Southern road
to this city. A railroad competing with
the Southern Pacific is now being built
throueh tne San Joaquin Valley from
Stockton toward S^uittern California. Its
â¢ ostensible terminus 12 Baktrsfieid. a town
of 6000 inhabitants, only seventy miles
from Los Angeie*. Will it peimanently
stop there and seek no further outlet 9
That supposition is preposterous.
"Now, what more natural than that the
Valley road ehonld be extended a few
miles further across tue Tehacnapi range
through an unoccupied pass, swing east
erly toward Randsbare. and somewhere
near that point join the Salt Lake Rai:
wuy? It would thus secure connections
with Los Angeies and ail Southern Cali
fornia, and aiso with Salt Lake City and
the East by far better grades than those
of the Central Pacific. San Francisco
would then, and not until then, be eman
cipated from the control of a single trans
continental line. All Central California
wonld then be able to ship its products
and receive its supplies over competing
lines. We may be sure that the pro
moters of the San Joaquin Valley road
contemplate nothing less."

WAR AT THE CAPITOL
Governor Budd and Secretary Vrown
Clash Over the State Printer's
Bill.
SACRAMENTO, Cal , Jan. ILâ At the
meeting of the State Board of Examiners
to-day Attorney-General Fitzgerald moved
that an emergency bill be drawn up and
presentrd to the Legislature to provide for
tue mileage expenses of tbe Presidential
electors and the expenses of the messen
ger who will carry the vote to Washing
ton. The motion met with approval ana
was carried.
State Printer Johnson presented a claim
for $75,000 for the next two years' ex
penses, and asked lor the approval of the
board. The past appropriations were as
follows: In 1889, $70,000; in 1891, $75,000;
in 1892. $30,000, and in 1895. $50,000. Gov
ernor Budd refused to consider the biiL
He said the board had nothing to do with
appropriations provided for by law. If
this was a deficiency he was opposed to it,
as he said all along that there would prob
ably be a deficiency. Johnson, he said,
had bought new" type to print the Code
Commissioners' report, had put in new
eiectric machinery and had tainted the
building â this in the face of a shortage of
funds. Upon the advice of Brown and
Fitzgerald, Johnson withdrew his claim
and will lobby it through the Legislature,
as heretofore. He claims that the reports
of the Code Commission, Bureau of High
ways and Dairy Bureau have greatly
added to the expense of his office, and
that $75,000 is not a cent too much.
Upon adjournment of the board there
was quite a loud discussion of the matter
between Budd, Fitzgerald and Brown.
Budd reviewed the history of his expert
scheme and accused Brown of refusing to
allow Harrison, whom he had appointed
expert, to look at the salary-roll of the
State printing office, which he, as a private
person, had a right to do. Brown replied
that the refusal was made by Deputy
Attorney-Ueneral Anderson in a conver
.-ation to which he (Brown) had no part
and which be did not hear. Brown sai4
that such improvements as Jonnson had
made were necessary and challenged Budd
to deny that fact. Budd replied that
Johnson had made such iniDrovements
when ne had expressly warned him tnat
he wonld create a deficiency.
"I toid him so when lie presented a
salary-roil for services of employes when
they were on vacation.' 1 he declared.
â¢And at that time," said Brown, "you
caused him to adopt a ruie for over-time
payment, which is not having its effect."

Though the ground was snow-covered,
: these culprits were put at hard manual
', labor, clearing vacant lots of brush and
\ other simuar employment. Guards armed
! with Winchester rifles watched them.
Tue crisis came on New Year's day, when,
; in spite of the rain, the gang was set %t
! work. Ten or more of them absolutely
! refused to turn out, and were removed to
a cell wherein the temperature resembled
I that of an icehouse and placed upon a
j bread and water diet. Those who worked
as they were required were given five
I hours' labor instead of ten and rewarded
j with a regular New Year's dinner. The
; recalcitrant members of the gang are still
holding out and are being fed upon the
i bread and water diet. Some of the weaker
I members aie showing evidence of their
I willingness to capitulate, but two or three
j of the ringleaders are using all their pow
'. ers of persuasion to induce their compan
j ions to stand firm. What possible relief
i from the present state of things the mos;
sanguine of them expect is bard to see, as
the whole advantage is on the side of the
J authorities, and the submission of all the
j gang merely a matter of time. In the
I meantime the treatment accorded the
j roughs has had the beneficial effect of
I freeing the City in a great measure of this
i dangerous class.

Grocer found Badly Wounded on the
Flotr of Hit Store.
PASADENA, Cal., Jan. 11.â A laboring
man passing the grocery-store of David
McAdams at Lamanda Park this morning
about 7 o'clock was attracted by groans.
He entered the store and found the pro
prietor in his nightclotbes stretched on
the floor in a pool of blood, a revolver by
his side. He called assistance and an at
tempt was made to discover the cause of
the man's condition. The casu drawer
was upon tbe flo >t, with its contents scat
tered about. McAdams had been shot
just below the heart, but was conscions.
In a rambling way he stated that his
store had been entered by robbers from
the back door; that they shot him and he
fired one snot after them. An examina
tion showed the back door securely fas
tened and nothing ot-en at the front by
which escape could have bee-i made. Two
shots bad been fired rroni McAlarns' re
vo;ver and hi 3 liiehtrobe was scorched by
powder.
It is believed that McAdam* attempted
suicide. His condition is critical.

ENDS HIS LIFE
WHILE INSANE
Georga E, Dixon Commits
Suicide in a Hotel at
San Rafael.
The Retired Capitalist Slashes
His Neck and Wrists With
a Razor.
Believed While Temporarily Deranged
That He Was Harassed by
Conspirators.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Jan. 11.â George
Â£. Dickson, a retired capitalist, who made
this ouy his home, died at 3 o'clock this
afternoon from the effects of wounds in
flicted upon bimsel! yesterday.
While temporarily deranged he cut his
throat and wrists with a razor. Physicians
labored over him all last night and to-day,
but he had been sn weakened by loss of
blood that they could not save his life.
Dickson had been suffering from mental
aberration. His ailment was said to have
been caused by high living and want of
exercise. He imagined that enemies were
conspiring to destroy his good name and
rob him of his property.
Yesterday afternoon he retired to his
room at the Grand Central Hotel and
locked the door. Then he tootc a razor
and inflicted two gashes in his neck, one
on either side.
Wishing to make his death certain he
also slashed his wrists with t&e keen biade.
When his room was entered some time
later the capitalist was lying in a faint
upon the bed, weak from the loss of blood
that had flowed from his wounds.
He lingered through the night, and this
morning there was some hope of his recov
ery, but toward noon he grew weaker, and
his death was anticipated.
Dickson was a rancher, but of late years
has been enjoying a life of leisure. He
was unmarried. He was a brother of W.
J. Dickyon and J. C. Dickson, prominent
citizens of San Rafael.
STRANGE FIND AT SPOKANE.
Body of an Aborigine Uncovered by a
Washout Vfithin the Limits of
the City.
SPOKANE. Wash., Jan. 11.â The body
of an Indian, belonging evidently to some
very remote period, was unearthed to-day
almost within the city limits. At the east
end of Hangman Creek bridge rains have
caused the banks to cave down and thus the
skeleton was exposed. It was in a sitting
position and buried a foot below the origi
nal surface.
With the skeleton were implements of
the chase and numerous trinkets of the
bone and stone age. They included six
or eight flint arrow-heads, three or four
bone spearheads and broken stone imple
ments having the appearance of hatchets.
More curious still were a dozen Email
bones notched on the sides, having evi
dently served as records of important
events. The oldest Indians in this vicin
ity have no recollection of the body ever
having been buried there. It is supposed,
from appearances, that the body has lain
there ior at least 200 years.

PORTLAND, Oe., Jan. 11.â That Don

this moment occupying the attention of
Coroner Koehler instead of resting com
fortably in a cot at St. Vincent's Hospital,
he may tbank the quicicness of eye and
s turd in ess of arm of Motorman Isaac
Turple of the City andSuburban'Railroad.
McLeod, attacked by an apopletic fit,
.'ell from the rear platform of a west
bound car a*t the corner of Morrison and
Eleventh streets last evening. His fall
was so timed that he landed directly in
front of an eastbound car, his head strik
ing on the edge of the headlight, which
cut a severe gash.
And here Motorman Turple of the. east
bound car distinguished himself. Instead
of â as i* usual vnth the drivers of the
trolley juggernauts in other citiesâjam
ming his car on top of the victim,
mangling bone* and flesh and crushing
out the life, Motorman Turple exerted his
jamming abilities o;i the car brakes and
the reversal of the current, with the re
sult that he stopped his car before tbe
front wheels had found opportunity to
connect with the prostrate form lying on
tbe rails beneath the front platform. The
car was brought to a standstill before it
had gone five feet.

THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE.
Experiments Prove That Robins Destroy
Tree Pestsâ ldentity of a Suicide
Learned.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 11.â From ex
periments carried on in the orchard of
George W. Cozzens, in the Willows, for
the past month, it has been determined
that the robin greatly aids the orcbardist
and vineyardist in destroying insects and
scale pests injurious to the treeÃ and
vines. The appearance of the robin in
the orchards at the time when the trees
were bare and when the borer and other
insects were beginning their deadly work
convinced the fruit-grower that if the
birds were amply protected they would
aid materially hiridding the orchards of
pests.
Early this season Cozzens gave strict
orders prohibiting any shooting upon his
place. As a consequence robin 3 soon
gathered in large numbers. They were
not molested or frightened in any man
ner and soon became very domestic in
their actions. Four or five weeks ago
Cozzens began to dig about his fruit trees
for the borer and canker worm. The
robins would gather in the immediate vi
cinity in large numbers and as soon as the
dirt.wÃs thrown back from the root of a
tree and the workmen had stepped away
they would settle in the excavation and
hunt diligently for worms. They would
invariably fiud the hole in which the borer
had entered the bark of the tree and draw
out the pest and devour it.
Examination of the trees which the
robins had visited found them entirely
free !rom worms and Cozzens is convinced
that the robin is a valuable bird to the
fruit-growers and one wnich should be
protected by law.

TACOMA, Wash , Jan. 11.â News has
been received that Juneau, Alaska, is
mucb excited over the discovery of quartz
ledges under houses and cabins that have
been occupied for years.
"Uncle" Dick Willonghby is preparing to
sink a shaft to the ledge that crops out
immediately under bis cabin. Some of
the most valuable business property in the
city is included within the boundary lines
of his claim.
Until three weeks ago Willonghby 's
cabin was directly over the- outcrop of
the ledge; but wishing to ascertain the
value and extent of the mineral rind be
Lias moved his residence southward,
away from the dangers attendant upon
blasting.
The ore from Willoughby's ledge is
free ruiliiug, and in some pieces free cold
can be seen with the naked eye. T%e
croppiugs assay $16 and $20 per ton. It is
believed at Juneau that a big mine will be
opened. Willoughby's neighbors are pre

When organization was completed both
houses adjourned until to-morrow at 10
o'clock. There was little friction in either
over the selection of officers, everything
having been settled in caucus. The Popu

The Senatorial contest is getting warm.
Judge Turner. Silver Republican, of Spo
kane; Benator Squire, Silver Republican,

Cline of Whatcom, Clark Davis of Seattle,
F. P. Baker of Tacoma, ail Populists, and
prominent in that party, with a dozen
others are aspiring, but each with a Email
following. The present outlook, though
exceediagly mixed, shows Turner in the
iead.
The Populists are trying to get all mem
bers to sign an agreement to vote for a
middle-of-the-road Populist. Twenty
eight have signed, but the number cannot
be materially increased. Fifty-seven votes
are needed to elect. 1 here are fifty-eigiit
Populists in the Legislature, but they can
not agree. The indications are for a pro
lonced fight as well as a bitter one.
Lobbyists for all of the candidates are
gathering. Squire has a large number of
lobbyists who are trying to keep Populists
from signing the middle-of-tne-road agree
ment, as is Turner also. The Populists
may bolt to a middle-of-the-road man, but
the Drospects are not good.

ADVICE TO PORTLAND MAIDENS.
Theatrical Manager Friedlander Says to
Aspirants for Footlight Honors :
â¢â¢Don't."
PORTLAND, Ob., Jan. 11.â Manager 8.
H. Friedlander of xh? Columbia Theater.
San Francisco, is here on a visit. He is
well known here as the former manager
of the principal theater in this city, and
since his arrival he has been besieged by
all classes of young women who want to
go on the stage. His advice is "don't"
He said to-day :
â¢â¢The fact is, there is no more excuse for
the average young lady â aye, or young
man, either â eoing on the stage, as they
call it, than there would be for them to
open a drugstore or a dry-goods store just
for fun. There is no fun in s;a<;e work.
For the novice who has been attracted by
the bright glare of the footlights, who
has dreamed of fame, of securing the
plaudits of an admiring multitude, it all
fades when they get a taste of the work.
The fascination vanishes, and they find
themselves engaged in the hardest kind
of labor. Of all the novices who go on
the stage nearly one-half leave it beiore a
year, broken in spirit or health, or both.
So my advice to all applicants for entrance
to this life is 'don't.'
"There is room for talented young
ladies and young men in the dramatic
profession just as there are opportunities
for success in the law, medical or com
mercial pursuits. But people do not enter
those for fun; no more should they cross
the footlights. If a young woman has a
home and does not have to earn her own
living, or if she has a position, she is fool
ish to give up either for the uncertainties
of dramatic work â uncertainties, for it is
purely experimental for a novice.''

Colonel Frank V. Drake of Portland, Or.,
a poet of considerable ability. The music
was composed by A. G. Kaufman '97.
The poem was recently received by Mr.
Kaufman and is dedicated to the two
clubs. The opening verses follow:
They told us that the Stanford boys
Were comin* to the town.
I s'posed they were a lot of "dudes";
1 be news made MaDlhy frown.
We sot ourselves to keep oar boyÂ»
And girls from seem' them;
But, b'gosb. we all are trying now
To have them come again.
In Callforny's early days
I knew i he Gov'ner well.
A noble friend was he, and tree,
As all who know him tell;
So when those young men got to town
I bad to go ;nd see
Them play and bear them sing and praise
His University.
1 always thought no singing good
Without a woman's voice.
But when I heard those gentlemen '
It made my heart rejoice.
They had no trouble with their staves ,
And jumped clear over bars.
And marked the tune on mandolins, ,
Mandolas and guitars.

PASTOR'S WORDS
Ssrmon on Suicide Wasted
Upon a Stockton
Citizen.
Goes From the Church to His
Apartments and Eods
His Life.
Swallows a Dose of Strychnine and
Suffers Tortures Before
Death.
STOCKTON, Cai*, Jan. 11.â After listen
ing attentively to a sermon against sui
cide, preached by Rev. Phlo Phelps in
the Presbyterian church iast evening,
Ulysses Simpson Barter went home and
ended his lire. His body was found at 3
o'clocK this mornina in his room at the
Commercial Hotel. Barber was local agent
for the Jamestown stage, and his career
extended back over a period of thirty
three years.
"That was a good talk," Barber had re
marked to tnree companions after leaving
the house of worship. Those to whom he
expressed his approval of the pastor's
j .-.rks were O. C. God bold, Ed Parker
Ts: -i a tailor who is employed at the Ward
robe, and who was known to his associates
by no more dignified title than "Jimmy,
the tailor." Barber seemed to be in jovial
spirits. At the church when Mr. Phelps
was assigning intemperance as a cause for
many suicides, God bold remarked jok
ingly, "That hits you, now."''
Barber laughed and returned the jibe.
The sermon seemed to have made con
siderable of an impression upon him,
and he appeared to be engaged in deep
thought part of the time, although at in
tervals he laughed and joked with his
companions, as was his custom.
After leaving the church tne party went
to the mission, on Main street, between
El Dorado and Center, and there re
mained for a time. Barber was the first
to suggest that they leave, and they de
parted before the service was over. They
then visited the Salvation Army barracks,
and there remained until the meeting had
been dismissed, when they returned to
the hotei.
Barber stayed in the lobby of the hos- :
telry chatting until an early hour this
morning, when he w-ent to his room. No
one could have supposed for a moment
that he contemplated suicide. He was in
the best of spirit.*, told funny stories and
laushed the time away. No hint was
dropped of his being disgusted with life,
and suicide, which the sermon that he
â¢had just Kstened to might naturally nave
suggested aa a topic of conversation, was
not mentioned.
Barber occupied a room on the second
floor o; the hotel. In an adjoining room
Siept Gus Ruf, a harness-maker employed
at Oldham'j shop, and in another apart
ment near by was George Blazo, a carpen- !
ter. After Barber had retired both heard
groans and curses coming from his room,
and George Reidy. the bellboy, was sum
moned. He tried to open the door, but it
was locked. Xigiit Clerk Fox was called
up, and Al Banna, tha night operator tor \
[Alie Western Uniuft, who was with Fox at \
::ue, also went up to the room. All
s tried to open the door. In the I
meantime the groans continued, with oc
casional curses. Calls to Barber brought
a response, but the only reply made was a
groaning "Yes."
Finally the door was forced open and
the party rushed in to find Barber lying 'â¢
on iii couch dead. His body was straight
and rigid ; the eyes had a v;ild stare and
the left for- arm, with the fist clenched,
extended up by the bead. The man's face
was black, and a glass with a few wnite I
crystals left clinging to it, toeetber with
some strychnine by the bedside, told tde j
story. The bedclothes were loaded nicely j
abou: the dead form, and although he was !
Heard to groan and swear in the agony of
his death, he must have lain on his back i
and bore the pain wit* out flinching or j
moving. The clenched fist was the only
evidence of pain. The suicide had left no
notes to friends or relatives giving the
reason for his act.
Tne friends of Barber are now wonder
ing whether he premeditated the deed or
whether it was induced by a strange in- I
flutnee produced upon his mind by the
sermon which denounced self-destroyers
as cowards, murderers and fools. Some
believe that Barber had not a thought of'
'killing himself until he heard the sermon,
when he began to brood over the act and
finally determined to put an end to his
existence. It is more probable that he
had made np his mind to kill himself and
had that idea in mind when he went to
â¢hear Mr. Phelp-. The fact that he was !
not a regular attendant at the church, but 'â 
went on that special occasion when the
subject had been announce 1 through the
papers, seems to prove that i>e was at
least more or less interested in the sui
.tide question.
It is sail that Barber was soon to be
supp. anted as stage agent here, and that
the knowledge of the fact was the prime!
cause of his suicide.
Barber spent most of his life at Copper- I
opohs. He went to school there to Henry j
Lieginger in 1574 ami 1875. Lieginger is
now employed as a waiter in the hotel
inhere Barber killed himself. Three of
Ifti^her's sisters live in Oakdale. They are
\t- married, one being the wife of Dr. Muir.
STANFORD'S DEBATERS.
Arrangements Completed for the Orator-
ical Contests Preliminary to the
Intercollegiate.
. STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
11.â For months past tLe debaters entered
in the preliminary contest have been ran
sacking the book-sheives in the university
library collecting unanswerable argu
ments. A Jarger number of students are
striving for a place on the intercollegiate
debating; team than during any previous
year. This is probably due to the fact
that Eerkelcy has carried off the debatmg
nonors the past two years and Stanford is
anxious to call a halt. In 1893-94 Stanford
showed her superiority on the ros-'rum by
winning; in both events. Then she lost
two contests aud the universities were
even. It now remains to be seen which
will carry off the odd point thi* year.
Stanford's representatives will be chosen
by a series of competitive debater, the
lirst to take place January 19, the second
on January 22 and the third on January
2a. At the concluMon of the last debate
tha judges will render their decision as to
who are best fitted to uphold Stanlord's
interest-. The jud.es were selected to
day. Professors Ross of the economic de
partment, Howard of history and Brun
or the Romance languages have consented
t<j act.
A The subject to be debated by the first set
â t' speakers is: "Resolved, That govern
iV t by injunction is compatible with a
democratic iorm of government." Ross
'97, Hull '98, and Dixon 1900. will repre-
B<Â»nt the nrhrmative, and Rotbrock '98, B.
Wells '07, and Miss SteDbins '97, the neg
ative.
Tne qnestion for January 22 is. "Re
solved, That assuming the adoption of
adequate constitutional amendments, the
United States should adopt a system of
responsible Cabinet government." Messrs.
Filcher '99, Whitakcr '99 and McKinnon
'99 will endeavor to prove the truthful
ness of the assertion, while Morgan '98.
Burcham '97 and Miss Grieb '93 will sup
port the negative.
The final preliminary debate will be
held on January 29. The subject for dis
cussion is: "Resolved, That a system of
municipal government concentrating all
executive and adnr.nistrauv power in the
Mayor should be adop ed in San Fran
cisco." BHi '97. Miw Williams '93,
Sch wartz '99 and Hunt '00 will speak for the
affirmative. Tiie negative side will be
represented by Burton Palmer ' 97, Q'Neil
'97. Riggins '93 and Switzer '98.
fc'fhe committee in charÃe of the prelim
inary debate for the Carnot contest de
cided to hold it on January 22. The ques
tion for discussion is: "'Resolved, That
the centralization of French education is
conducive to the best social results." No
speaker will be informed on wh eh side
he is to speak until the day preceding the
event. They will then be chosen by lot.
The judges have not as yet been chosen.

NET STEELHEAD TROUT.
Attention of the Fish Commis
sioners Is Called to
Point Reyes.
Where Sportsmn Scored Good Bags
of Qaail and Duck Last
Sunday.
This is the season of the year when
anglers should meet with good success
when fisnin? for bteelheads. but, accord
ing to a letter which was received at this i
office yesterday, a copy of which follows, :
the prospect for good sport at Point i
Reyes this year is certainly very poor, j
j unless the Fish Commissioners will so far
interest themselves as to stop the iliegal j
j netting of steeliieads in the deep pools at |
; the mouth of the creek. The writer says: i
Point Reyes, January 10.
Sporting Editor Call: The Call being read
extensively by ang.e. â  ivhu visit Maria County :
j at tiiis season of the year. I u.oueht I would ,
i drop you a line to inform you that the salmon
I or steeiheads which run into the Paper-mill I
are being caught, by net fishermen, which is I
contrary to law, as the fishermen use nets, the <
meshes of which are much smaller than the!
' law allows. In fact, the same nets are used \
I in Toraales Bay by ihe. fishermen. This fact i
' was mentioned to some of the supposed deputy
1 Fish Commissioners who recently visited tlie i
. Russian Kiver, but they seemed to take no j
notice of it. If the Fish Commissioners, so
, called, are still in existence in fact they can j
â  be of some goo:l to the angling fraternity if I
| they will examine the uots used by the fisher- i
j men of Tomales Bay and arrest some oi those )
i poachers who are slaughtering the breeding j
j fishes that stock Paper-mill Creek annually, J
! which natural manner of stocking la iar better â¢
and more productive than the artificial work
of the commission. Yours truly,
A Country Angler.
In reference to the size of nets allowed
by law section 634 of the Penal Code
i reads:
Every person who shall, for the purpose of
j catching shad, salmon or striped bass in any
ot the public waters of this state, fish with or :
use auy seine or net, dragnet cr paranzella, â¢
the meshes of which are, when drawn closely â 
\ tog' ther and measured inside the knot, less j
than seven and a half inches in length, is <
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction '
shall be fined not less than $100. or in de- ,
I fault not less than 100 days in ihe County â¢
! Jail. All moneys collected for fines for the j
! violation or any of the provisions of this chap- '
ter shall be paid into the general funa of the |
county in wnich the conviction is had.
Any citizen can cause the arrest of j
1 fishermen who are seen in the act of trans- ;
: gressing the law, affÃ it is safe to say that j
! the court will show no mercy, as the fines j
I will add to the general fund of the county j
in which the arrest is made. Judges and !
jurors take particular notice of such
I things.
At least calculation thirty anglers of
this City visited Point Reyes Saturday
and Sunday last, but the same old story
was tola on their returnâ viz. : the condi
tion of water was splendid, but no fish in
! sigiit.
As this is the season of the year when
midwinter angling should be at its best in
the deep pools at the mouth of the Paper
mill Creek, it is the general /Opinion of
! anglers that netting is being done exten
sively under the cover of daikness, and it
is hoped that a watch will be instituted by
th* officers who are paid fat salaries.
John Butler, Frank Hofling and Judge
Evans will leave to-day ior Duncans Mills.
As the Russian River is now in good order
I for fishing the sportsmen anticipate a nrst
' class outing. Messrs. Cross, \\ ilson and
Babcock of the Fish Commission are said
to be fishing on the Russian River now,
witii a view of looking toward the pro
tection of fish and game on those who
iauah and ridicule the law.
Fred Butler and J. Rudolph, members
of the Tamalpais Sportsmen's Club, bagged
! eighty-six quail on Sunday, in the csn
lyonseast ot Hamlet, Marin County. On
I Saturday, the 21 inst., the same sportsmen
i baeged 125 quail in the same county.
Quail shooters who visit Point Reyes
and vicinity consider that the bagging of
such a large number of birds in one day's
shooting by two men savors potnunting,
which method of slaughter is not by any
means tolerated by the officers of the club
of which they are members.
John K. Ofr and Frank Vernon bagged
a few snipe and quail on Sunday in the
grounds oi the Country Club.
John Kerrigan and W. Lawrence had a
very nice shoot on quail in the vicinity of
Tocaloma.
Dick Brooks, Billy McÃae, Fred John
son and Lloyd Eaton lost their bearings
last Sunday, while duck-shooting near
Antioch, and returned to camp minus a j
featber. The hunters state that a thick j
fog has been hovering over Antioch and |
vicinity for two weeks, and as a conse- !
quence game, with the exception of the
"Remfree Can," is hard to locate. Brooks
is authority for the statement that during
foggy weather hunters should wear
smoked glass, as flying objects can be
easily discerned, but Johnson says that he
can't ?ee through it.
F. Hofling and his hunting partner,
"Bill Nye," bagged forty-seven clam dig
gers, which are more commonly Known as
spoonbills, at Alvarado on Sunday. Don
ald and Pete McÃae returned with 105
ducks from Mount Eden.
John Fullerton and Thomas Grant
bagged twenty ducks, which consisted of
canvasback, bluebill and sprig, on the
Point Reyes marshes Sunday.
Thomas Casey was successful in meet
ine a large bevy of quail near Ignacio on
Sunday. He managed to bring fo nr to bag.
To Illustrate the System.
To-morrow evening when the directors of
the Olympic Club meet thsy will be given an
illustration of the workings of the propor
tional and preferential system of voting,
which so many members petitioned to have

under consideration by the board for some
time and has found several admirers among

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1897.
ROE AWAITS
DEATH CALMLY
Undisturbed by the Final
Preparations for His
Execution.
Converses on Theological Topics
With Rev. Mr. Gaston
of Vallejo.
The Pastor Describes Him as a
Learnei Man, Lacking in Moral
Qualifications. /
%
NAPA. Cal., Jan. 11.â Arrangements
for the execution of William M. Roe next
Friday morning are nearly completed, but
the prisoner is as unconcerned as ever.
Early this morning much noise was caused
by ;he carpenters as they began the erec
tion of the scaffold and the high fence,
but the sound of the hammer and saw did
not disturb Roe's slumber. A high in
closure foriy feet long and thirty-four feet
wide, of corrugated sheet-iron, is being
erected bacK of the jaiL
A covered alley way six feet wide leads
to the inclosure from the south entrance
to the jail, and in the east portion of the
inclosure an inclined platform has been
erected for the use of those who will at
tend the execution.
The death watch has began, and from
this time until his execution the con
demned will not be left alone. Charles
Harden and D. R. Wheeler are on the
night watch and Wall Kennedy and
Frank Lyon are the day watchers.
Rev. \V. L. Gaston oi the Baptist church
at Vallejo visited Roe at the jail here
this morning and had a long interview
with the condemned man. The reverend
gentleman says:
Roe surprised me in two ways. He is a
smaller man ptiysically and a larger man
mentally than I expected to see. He is a
man exceedingly well read. He has all
the theory of orthodox Christianity, but
seemingly has never had the slightest
serious impression on his sensibilities.
He conversed very frteiy on religious sub
jects, quoted profusely Irom th; Bible,
and even spoke exegetically of several
Scripture passages, l was surprised at
his fami iarny with what might be con
sidered technical theological phrases. I
explained to him the doctrine of the
atonement, which was made for all man
kind, and 1 can assure you that 1 was not
compelled to use simple terms to convey
to him my thoughts. He seemed to un
derstand the theory of the doctrine as
well as 1 did. Yet from his manner, it
was plainly evident that his moral nature
was absolutely dead to all sensibilities.
"Roe is a man without any compunc
tions of conscience. He knows he has
done wrong and that he is the criminal he
is represented to be, and yet it is impossi
ble' for him to feel it. For a time he
talked very seriously, admitting that bis
stubborn will was all that prevented him
from accepting Christ as a savior. Then
some jocular expression whicn ill-con
ceaied an underlying sneer, revealed the
man's true nature. It may be said to his
credtftnat he says he thinks more seri
ously than be talks. He says be has
prayed and wept many times at night
until his pillow was wet, yet never felt
that a prayer was answered.
"Roe lÂ» exceedin-lv genial, social, cun
ning and crafty. There is a subtleness in
his nature that he cannot hide. It is my
opinion :hat he is cowardly, and that he
never assailed a man unless he had the
advantage. He is determined, His bump
of combativenes-i is large and bis bump of
desiructiveness still larger. Caution is
well developed, and he has a good deal of
executive ability. In response to my in
quiry as to what advice he wanted to send
to tne young men who might be in my
congregation next Sunday evening, when
I shall preach on "How a Man Acts When
but Four Days From the Grave, 1 ' he seid:
"'Give the advice to the parentsâ they
need it most. Tell the young men to be
ware of the time when they - think that
they are big enough to take care of them
selves. That is the time when boys and
girl- are in the greatest danger. 1
"He advised Christian living, although
there may bft no life hereafter."
ROE'S CKJStt: AT WISTERS.
So Doubt That Bis Itmtmi Confection It
True in Every Detail,
WINTERS, Cal , Jan. 11.â Interest in
the confession of William .E. Roe that be
was the assailant of Miss Waughteil at
this place nine years ago is still intense.'
Sheriff McKenzie heard Mr. Waughtell's
story before he related Ro'-'s confession,
and also listened to that of ,W. P. Womack,
who was constable at the date of the crime
and one of the leaders in the search for
the perpetrators. In all imnortant details
there was no variation. Being unable to
catch their men, the detectives, to justify
their drawing large sums of money for
services that accomplished: nothing,. left
the inference; that the girl bad either in
vented the whole story or J was t shielding
the real criminal. Roe's story of the crime
is so circumstantial, and the reasons for it
quite sufficient for one of his lack of moral
perceptions, that there is no doubt about
its truthfulness. . .... ..â¢'â .â¢ . , â¢ â -/-â 
' With a comrade of like character he was
camping near Winters lat *â  the ;. time 1 t c
citizens arose ; in - their wrath and drove
out of town a number of dissolute women
and their friends. While in Sacramento
a few days later these women offered to
pay him well if be would commit such a
crime as that against Miss Waughteil.
With his companion he returned to town,
and selected bis victim with the. calmness
of one "' who " counts*-'-' murder ~as only â  a
diversion. ;
Roe told the Sheriff that the crime was
committed about 9 o'clock in the morning
and there was no danger of ; the girl being
rescued until the family came to dinner.
He related the details as though he seemed
to enjoy tne Knowledge \of her sufferings."-
v Afterward, he said, he went leisurely to
Putah Creek, walked down stream a half
mile, crawled ** into â¢ the .' bushes ' and \ lay
quietly until next day,' watching the men
go by as they bunted. for him. :
,--.: On the following \ day he mingled with
the people, taking ; creat interest " in the
man- hunt, and was never even suspected
of being implicated in the crime. To the
younc man who was engaged to his vic
tim he volunteered :hii' services to hunt
down the "fiends, but n. soon afterward he
left the vicinity. Later ?he 'â  returned to
Winters and worked !â¢ for well-known citi
zens, "just to . see how they took it," he
said. .A picture of, Roe was readily, recog
nized by these men. \
THE ABMY BALL TEAM.
It It Desirous of Meeting Foemon
Worthy of Its Strength.
The United States Regular* baseball
team would like a game with the San
Francisco Athletic team, the Violets,
Alameda Alerts or Conway & Baumels.
Managers are requested to address Edward
Little, Angel Inland.
The probable line-up of the soldier
team is: D.inn, catcher; Wheeler, pitcher;
Morley, first base; Camsrou, second base ;
Haines, shortstop; Little, third base;
Fincb, left field; Noyes, center field; Fin
ger, right field; extra, Jlorentine.
Managers of interior towns are espe
cially requested to write for dates, as the
U. S. R. nine is to make a twenty-day
tour throughout the State, including such
ball towns as Santa Clara, San Jose, Santa
Cruz, Monlerey, Watsonville. Hollister.
Alameda, Stockton, Suisun, Benicia, and
home again.
This trip will be postponed if the pro
posed league is formed and the soldier
team admitted, but as the chances appear
to be very slim just now for ttie formation
of such a league this trip will probably be
made.
At the conclusion of the season a match
will be made witn the Army nine, at Van
couver barracks, to settle the soldier
champions, ip of the 'â¢oast.
COUNTERFEIT COIN.
Two 3len Arrested for Pasting It Upon
Storekeepers in the
Sllsgion.
Two men were arrested last night and
taken to the Seventeenth-street police
station. They were passing counterfeit
half dollars upon storekeepers in the
Mission.
About 9 o'clock Policeman William
King was notified by Pete Soper, who has
a restaurant at Twenty-ninth and Mission
streets, that two men had been in his place
and had called for drinks.
They passed over two half-dollars, eacli
paying separately for his drink and get
tine the change. After they had gone
Soper discovered that the half-dollars were
bogus.
King went in search ol the two men and
found them in a few minutes. He placed
them under arrest and took them back to
Soper, who identified them as the men
that had passed the bogus half-dollars
upon him.
King took them to the station, and on
bein^- searched twenty-eight bogus half
dollars were found upon one, who gave
his name as Thomas J. Jonnaon, 33
years of age. He was booked on charges
of having counterfeit coin in his posses
sion and passing it. The other man gave
his name as William H- Ellis and bis age
as 40. No charge teas booked against dim

HEALTH CONFERENCE.
The Local Board Meets Representatives
From the Various Bay
Counties.
The local Board of Health held a confer
ence last evening witn representatives of
boards in the various bay counties in rela
tion to legislation looking to give health
boards greater power.
Alameda, Oakland, San Jose, Sacra
mento and other counties were represeted,
and members of various organization; in
terested in health matters were also pres
ent.
Attorney McEnerney of the San Fran
cisco board stated that the object of the
meeting was to foster legislation on a num
ber of importar.t subjects.
- The first of these was a bill to grant
power to health boards to pass ordinances
intended to promote the interests of the
public health, and impose penalties for
violations of them.
Another was to allow health boards to
subpena witnesses and order them to pro
dace any Dook?, accounts and documents
nrcessary for investigations. A third was
intended to define with precision the
' powers of boards of health in regard to the
abatement of nuisances and destroy such
buildings as may be deemed a menace to
health.
The various represent atives present
agreed to use tbeir influence to bring
about the desired legislation.
EAKEMAN HAD TO PAY.
Judge Coffpy Would Not Listen to Hit
Excuse of Sickness.

paid % $50 f. to t he ;. minor 0 1 n heirs, of
whom be is guardian. They complained
that though he had $500 of iheir money in
hiÂ» bands i they could not get i anything
from him with which to pay their neces
sary expenses. - -.*-,/_ -.<â ;.â ";; ..:/.â 'â¢ â 
. Attorney John D. Whaley appeared for !
Rakeman and said that the guardian was
too sick to appear in court. ;
"That's no reason for not paying the
money to these children. Whetner he is
sick or not he must pay that money into
court and I don't want him to lose any
time about it," replied the Judge.
"If your Honor will postpone the case
for a few days I think the money will be
paid." said Mr. Whaley.
"No, I will not postpone the case," was
the reply. "Ihe guardian has had too
much time already. These cases of dis
tress are becoming too common. Ever
since the rule requiring guardians to de
posit trust funds in bank, subject to the
order of court, was broken guaruians have
been in the hadit of invesiing money that
does not belong to them in their private
business. Now, this money must be re
turned at once."
L,ater in tbe day Ida Olsen, one of the
minor*, appeared before Ju<iÂ«e Coffey and
reported that she had^ received $50 from
Rakeman and Mr. Whaley produced at

amount.

THE CHURCH
IN HISTORY
Archbishop Riordan Lec
tures at Metropolitan
Temple.
Catholicism Portrayed as the
Society of True Be
lievers.
Unity in Faith and Government Â£<â¢
sential to Unity in Truth and
Results.
Archbishop P. W. Riordan delivered a
lecture at Metropolitan Temple last night
on "The Constitution of the Church."
Previous to the iddress there were several
vocal selections, also some instrumental
music.
Judge E. W. McKinstry introduced the
distinguished speaker with an appropri
ate reference to the facts of ecclesiastical
history. He said :
"There is something marvelous about
this great church â an institution that has
withstood the storms of nineteen cen
turies and that is still young and vig
orous.
"While those in this great church may
despise the insane ravines of some of its
enemies, tbey must respect the honest dif
ferences of more temperate critics. Ido
not believe there are any evidences that
so strong an institution is to be over
thrown."
When the Archbishop arose to speak
the audience was very silent. He began
impressively in deep, clear tones:
"A number of questions occur as to what
the Catholic church is. All competent
students and observers must agree that
this church, this great organization, is
the most prominent fact of history.
"Tnroughout the ages it has lived and
wrought its purposes as a reality. It
is not now and has never been a dream
or a scheme, but it is now and has for
ages oeen a great, iivins; fact of history.
"The church is beyond all cavil the
most conspicuous, the most powerful re
ligious organization in all history. It is,
therefore, not strange that it has made
enemies. The church is at once the best
liked and the most hated of all organiza
tions in this great and busy world. Its
enemies are bitter and unrelenting, while
in every land there are thousands â yea,
millions â who would lay down their lives
that the church m.^ht be preserved.
"While the enemies of the church are
forced by observation to admit its great
ness, to recognize its potency in the
world, they fail wholly to recognize
its sources of power, fail to see that it is
based on eternal truths, and that the
fountain-head is God himself."
The speaker dwelt at some leneth on
the rationalistic theory of the Catholic
church und its mission in the world. He
said that it was commonly held by this
civs i that the church as an institution
perpetuates a low form of idolatry, that
its teachings are false, and that its priests
simply act as blind tools to proclaim its
imamous purposes.
He then said there was in every country
a large elites who oppose the church be
cause it is unpopular in certain localities,
be ng too ignorant to form their own
rational conclusions.
"But to the Catholic," he said, "the
church is a conception high ana holy. To
him it is a divine institution, upheld by
the invisible God himself.
'â¢The age. however, is grossly material
istic. Men believe only in what they can
see and feel. The spirit of tbe age is so
material that men do not trouble them
selves about the invisible: They care for
that which they can see, and for that only.
This is a wrong, half-view of things. The
unseen force of tbe material universe, the
secret power in phenomena is its very life.
"The Catholic churcn is misunderstood.
To the question, 'VVbat is it?' I reply
that it b the visible com mnnity of believers
founded by Christ, in which men are con
ducted back to God. It is for the purpose
of continuing in tbe world and to the end
of time tbe grand words of Christ, his
message from on high. The church thus
becomes the witness and guardian of
divine truth. Thus, what I call the con
stitution of the church is preserved by an
apostleship within the church."
The eminent lecturer said that miracles
were necessary in the beginning of the
church to establish its authority, after
which there was no cause for them and
they ceased. He dwelt on tbe fact that
the church has always addressed itself to
all classes. >l lt comes with its message,"
he said, "to all classes, addressing the
slave in Africa, and alike to the infidel of
America. The church essentially ad
dresses itself to tbe capacity of all men.
There are several things that single this
great church out from all others. Among
those may Â£>c mentioned particularly its
unity and power ol self-preservation.
"Truth is its mission now. as it has been
from the outset, and truth is one, infalli
ble and uncompromising. It is a sad
commentary that elsewhere people are
changing their creeds and churches as one
might change the fashi n of clothing.
There is no faith, no doctrine, not even
the Nicene creed, tnat will bind all the
Protestant churches into one belief; yet,
the strange idea has been advanced by
some that the strength of the church con
sists in tbe number of denominations in
the country. This is as if one sbould say
that the stren th of the Union consists in
the number of States therein at war.
"The inflexibility of our doctrine is the
inflexibility of truth ; the stability of what
is divine. What is Dreached now was
preached from the beginning and will be
preached unto the end. The church is not
a unit in faith alone, but it is one in gov
ernment and one in truth. It comes to
all climes unchanged. This unity of gov
ernment preserves a marvelous unity of
faith. This society, thus unchanging, was
founded by the everlasting God. Its mis
sion on earth goes on and ou forever, and
will be preserved unto the end of time."
MURPHY IN "KERRYGOW"
The Alcazar Gives an Interest
ing Scenic Production of
"Chispa."
Hartman Giv s an A rial Ballet Act
in the New Edition of
"Jack"
Quite a different atmosphere was in
fused into the performance ol the com
pany playing at the Co'umbia last night
by the reappearance of JoseDQ Murphy,
who showed no traces of recent indisposi
tion in his dashing impersonation of Dan
O'Hare, the Kerry Gow.
The old play of "Kerry Gow" is well
known to San Francisco theater-goers, in
whose minds it is connected with former
performances by Joseph Murphy. All the
special features were well attended to last
nijtfit and the supporting company did
satisfactory work. The forge scene, where
one of the racehorses is shod, was rea
listic, and the trained pigeons did pretty
work in the scene where they flutter in
one after another, bringing bulletins from
the racetrack, where the heats are being
mn on whic i depend the fortunes of the
Drew family.
Joseph Murphy, who acts and makes up
mucn more youthfully than John Murphy,
was, of course, the star of the perform
ance. John Daley in his little part of
Major Graff raised many a laugh. W. T.
Sheehan's performance of O'Drive, if a
little overdrawn, was amusing. The work
done by the rest of the cast calls for no
particular comment except that Misa
Emma Italia did a clevar little "turn" as
the jockey, with song and dance.
At the Baldwin.
"The Old Homestead" began its second week
at the Baldwin Theater last night. Next Mon
day the Nordica Company will open their
concert and grand-opera season, for which
Isidore Luek3tone will conduct a large or
chestra. Tbe Nordica Company will not play
in Portland or any of the Northern cities at
present.
Tivoli Opera- House.
The second edition of "Jack and the Bean
stalk" was presented at the Tivoli last night
and several of (he new features made quite a
hit. Miss Anna Suits' singing of an a.r '.hat i
Lillian Russell is giving in New York in the j
"American Beauty" won several encores, and ,
Ferris Hartman and F. West's duet, "All Over j
I Town," promises to become one of the most i
popuiar lyric features <Â»' the new edition.
_ The real hit, howevei^was Ferris Hartmau's |
burle>que on the aerial ballet. The programme |
i&viteu the audience to keep as. quiet as possi-
I Die during the performance of tbe grand
| aerial ballet, as the artist might from any dis- '
i turbadce get off the trolley; spectatois were
also invited to try to discover the invisible
wire.
The wire which supported the fair Ferris, .
i who was arrayed in a costume of a premiere,
was a heavy seven-inch rope. Wafted through !
the air by this substantial support he per- |
ioimed the gyrations familiar to admirers of
the aeriel ballet. As an encore Hartman went
eveu farther than the ladies who do the fly-ing
ballet act, for he performed positive contor
tions and stood on nis head in the air.
At the Alcazar.
"Chispa" was given a very good production
by the stock company, the sceuic effects being
very good.
George Osbourne undoubtedly made the best
of the performance. It is almost impossible
to say anything of this clever man that has
not been said before. His realistic portrayal
of the Digger Indian is well known. He re
ceived a curtain call and his every exit was
followed by a storm of applause.
Another clever character siudy was given by
John Armstrong as Dr. Joaes, the "'oracle" of
the camp. His impersonation of the rugged
j old coward made quite a hit with the audi
i euce. Hugo Toland, though suffering from a
! slight huskiness, played the part uf Zelce
Stevens well. /
Francis Powers, as usual, was very 'good
Gordon Foster had litt.e to do, but did it
excellently. W. A. Belasco.in the prologue, did
a very nice bit of work.
Clever May Buckley made a very good
I "Chispa," and if she'd only get rid of that
j habit uf prefixing "say" to every other word,
| she would do oetter. Her last act won for her
j a large amount of approbation She is a bard
little worker, and deservestto succeed.
Mrs. Bates was as usual a success. Mrs.
Hines had but li'.tle to do, but she is a prornU-
I ing young actress. Mr. Clayton is coiisclen
' tious. Miss Sue Blanchard was good.
'ihe minor characters did their roles very
well. When it gets to running 6mooihly, it |
will prove another winner for tbe Alcazar.
At the Orpheum.
The chief new feature of the Orpheum this
week is the Royal Hungarian Court orchestra,
which is likely to prove a sirong attraction to j
music lover?. The band, which consis's of |
â  strings and reeds, only contains nine musi- |
cians all told. According to the Hungarian i
siyle they improvise their own orchestration, I
and do it so effectively that taey make toe j
I effect of a mucn fuller orcnestra than ni:.e |
I men could to expected to produce. There is j
! all the vim, the light and shade and peculiar i
catchy phrasing of national Hungarian or
chestras in their work, and every one knows,
who lias heard a Hungarian orchestra several
times, thai the charm of its music grows oa
the nearer with each successive performance.
On Sunday, its opening night, the Magyar
orchestra was well received. It opene<l in the
' familiar overture to "William 'lell," wbicn
was played in a catchy manner. A concert I
> waltz by WaMteufei went with a splendid j
i rhythmic swing, and the "Hungarian Fan- i
! tisie" by Berkes was a characteristic piece of I
Magyar mu*ic, interpreted with the warmtn !
ar.d intensity that nothing out a native or- j
chestra could give it. Henry Naczy, tbe first j
violin, did some attractive work in tnis |
number.
This type of music has been made very j
familiar to theater-goers here by the piece
! which is played behind the scenes in the
i foyer scene in" 'â¢Trilby," but the band which
Uecko was supposed to conduct did not play
the Hungarian music as it was given on Sun
! day evening. As an encore the band gave
Ma'scagni's familiar intermezzo.
Lieutenant Nobie, the Swedish ventrilo
quist, has made quite a hit this week. His
work is remarkably clever. The rest of the
bill consists of some of last week's performers
and of the two ballets. In K;ralfy's ballet
Miss Muriel O'Brien, a San Francisco debu
tante, made her firsi appearance laÂ«c night,
ard was noticeable ior the grace and prctti
ness of her dancing. Considerable success is
expected from her in the prolession she has
chosen.
The Grand Opera-House.
The "Land of the Midnight Sun" was pro
duced at Morosco's Grand Opera-honse last
evening. It Â» a dramatization of Hull Caine's
great novel "The Bondsma i," and was staged
With the Iceland volcanoes and aurora borealis
of the novel. The part of Jason Orry was filled
by John J. Pierson with success, and the part
of his half brother O.sim Suniocks by M r
timerSum. Victory Bateman and Lottie Wil
liams have important roles and play them
well. Bert Morrison has a part that brings
out his natural ability in Sergeant Meek; he
rendered it satisfactorily. The piece pleased
the audience irom the first to the close. It
will be given all the week.
At the Cbntes.
Everything at the Chutes, with the excep
tion of the skating rink, will remain closed
until Saturday. On Sunday afternoon and
evening Professor Bristol's troupe of tnirty
performing horses will be the principal at
traction.

WILL SEND CORN
TO THE HINDOOS
Evangelical Pastors Will
Wait on Mayor
Phelan
To Secure His Indorsement for
Chartering a Ship to Go
to India.
Bliss Says Bishop Potter Is an Arbl
trator Between Capital ani
Labor.
C. K. Clark, J. L. Barker and Rev. O.
G. May, the gentlemen in Berkeley inter
ested in the relief fund for India, have re
solved to make an effort to secure co
operation among the evangelical pastors,
with the object of sending from California
a ship laden with grain to relieve some of
the starvation in India.
At the Congregational Monday Club
yesterday Rev. O. G. May asked for the
appointment of a committee to co-operate
with him and his fellow-workers. "We
want as many pastors as possible," he
said, "to wait on the Mayor and secure
his indorsement for raising collections to
send a ship laden with grain direct from.
Califoraia to some port in India. We ex
pect to telegraph $400 to India to-morrow,
and we have a piano which will be sold to
add to the fund. President Gates, in
lowa, has written to tell us that lowa will
send some of her surplus corn to India,
and we want to induce California to do
likewise."
Rev. O. G. May's proposition was met
with ftv<jr by the Congregational Monday
Club and Rev. Dr. Adams, Rev. William
C. Pond ana Rev. Philip Coombe were
appointed a committee to co-operate with
him. The other evangelical denomina
tions also appointed committees; Rev. Dr.
Masters was appointed by the Me bodists,
Rev. Frank Ford by the Christians and
R v. Dr. Ketctiam by the Presbyterians.
The united committees will hold a meet
ing next Monday to arrange for waiting
on the Mayor.
There was a largely attended meeting of
the Clericus yesterday to hear Rev. W. D.
P. Bliss cf the Church Social Union.
After expounding his principles of social
ism Mr. Bliss answered Questions put by
the clergymen present. A question with
regard 10 the denomination uf the mem
bership of the union elicited th â¢ reply
that all the members are Episcopalians.
In the East, Mr. Bliss stated, the Epis
copal church is reco.-nized as being in'the
vanguard in tbe matter of church social
ism, and in any trouble between capitalists
and laborers Bishop Potter waÂ« more ap
pealed to than any other arbitrator. When
asked his opinion of Debbs, Mr. Bli^s re
plied that he considered Debbs and the
trades unions were not so much to blame
as outsiders and irresponsible hangers-on.
The Presbyterian Ministerial Union held
a quiz-question meeting yesterday, Rev.
Theodt>re Burnham of Valiejo being the
quM^uiaster. The general answer to the
question, '"How can a minister provide
lor a rainy day and old age?'' was that
persistent economy must be exercised. In
giving advice on "Th" .best Way of In
vesting havings," Mr. Burnham thought
that the savinjs bank should be uÂ«ed to
accumulate a sufficient sum to buy a giit
edeed mortgage.
The Christian pastors were addressed by
Rev. H. B. Morgan or Alameda on '"How
to Use the Daily Papers." Mr. Morgan
spoke some words iv defense of the Sun
day paper, which he said was prepared on
Saturday. "The paper .which gives work
on Sunday is the Monday paper," he said.
With regard to prize-fights, etc, he said
papers had to give the news, and he be
lieved that there were church members
who if their favorite paper suppressed tbe
report of a prize-fight would go out to
hunt a paper that dul report it.
The Bay Conference of Congregational
Churches will meet this afternoon at

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
California triumphs.
Exit the funding bill.
Now for the senatorsbip.
Ail eyes are on the Legislature.
Give us the right man lor Senator.
The people desire merit to be honored.
We have forced the Exaviiner to drop the
boodle cry.
Don't send a back number to the United
States Senate.
Is Senator Perkins standing on his
record or his "sense of humor"?
Samuel M. Sbortridge has made a clean
canvass aud deserves a clean victory.
No man should be allowed to attain the
seuatorsnip from California by tricks.
On what part of his record in office does
Senator Perk ns ask a vote of confidence
and a re-eiection ?
The Republicans of California should
send to the Senate a true blue Republican
and a stanch California!).
California has great interests to be
guarded at Washington and must send a
strong man to look after them.
The Republican Senator from California
should be something more than a "Me,
too," to the Democratic Senator.
The assaults of the Examiner on Repub
lican legislators won't hurt them. Every
body knows it is a blackmailing sheet.
When the roll i 3 called for the election
of United Slates Senator it is the duty of
every legislator to ba present and to vote.
Republican legislators will take notice
that Mr. Shortridge has neither vilified
his opponents nor hired others to vilify
them.
The attempt of a Democratic organ to
bulldoze Republicans into voting for its
candidaie for the sen3torship has been the
roorbacK of the canvass.
The day for ballotins for Senator has
come and the Examiner hasn't "worried"
Perkins "into selling a ship" yet. There
will be a squall to-morrow.
What legislator having business of his
own to ba loosed after at Washington
would not entrust it to Samuel M. Short
ridge rather than Geo rge C. Perkins?
Legislators of an inquiring mind should
ask the Perkins management how they
came to get the support of the subsidized
boodle organ, of the Democratic camp.
Samuel M. Shortridge is unquestionably
tbe choice of the Republicans of California
for the office of United States Senator, and
every legislator should respect the wili of
his constituents.
Despite all that satirical fools or common
slanderers of our politics may say, it is
better for a State to be represented in the
Senate by brains, energy and fidelity
than by money bags.
When one party to an agreement breaks
his pledge the other is released from it.
f\-rkins has absolved all Jeaisiators from
their promises to him by violating every
pledge he made to them.
There should be in the Unitrfl States
Senate from California a man abe to de
fend the interests of the State and tbe
great principles of Republican policy for
which the people voted.
The man who, with ihe most zeal, tne
most eloquence and the most effectiveneaa
championed the Republican parry during
the campaign is the man on whom the
party should confer its nonors.
To uphold the interests of California in
the great councils of the Nation we must
send to the Senate a man who is not only
willing to undertake the duties but has the
ability to perform them with success and
honor.
The public official who, after a term of
office, can show no workaccomDlished.no
service rendered, no effort made, is like
the unfaithful servant in the parable who
buried his talent in the earth. No such
man should receive further trust.
While the managers of Senator Perkins
depend for success on pledges obtained by
ex parte processes the friends of Samuel
M. Shortridge advocate his claims on the
ground of merit alcne. Which of thes â 
methods is most worthy of a United States
Senator?
Earnest legislators will not regard the
eiectiou of a United States Senator as a
mere matter of the distribution of the
spoils cf office. They will realize that
where ihe people of the State have so
many and such vast interests involved it
is important that the Senator chosen to
puard them should be a man of ability,
fidelity and force of character.
The San Jose Board of Trade expressed
theconvictions of all progressive Califor
nians in declaring tbe urgent need of "an
Â»ble ana energetic reDresentative in tbe
United States Senateâ one familiar with

THE CHOICE OF A SENATOR.
This is the day designated by tbe Federal statutes for State Legislatures to enter
upon the duty of electing a United States Senator. The members of the Senate and
Assembly of California will, therefore, devote some portion of to-day to this impor
tant labor. They will meet separately and ballot for the candidates whose claims to
election are duly presented. To-morrow they will assemble in joint session to either
ratify their choice of to-day or to proceed to vote together until they reach the result
of a majority of their joint session for the man of their choice.
The duty of selecting a Senator devolves mainly if not solely upon the Republican
members of the Legislature. It is a duty which is twofold, in that it involves their
obligation to their party as well as their duty to their State. Although double in its
obligation it is not a divided duty, for the reason that in performing the
one with loyalty they will be doin: the other in the best and most practical way.
The State of California to-day needs a Senator Repu blican not only in theory but
in practice as well. It requires a man in its Senatorial seat who has
the brains, the genius and the energy to distinguish himself in the public
service; who will impress the mark of his own strong and vigorous personality
upon public affairs; who will labor incessantly and intelligently for tbe interests of
the Pacific Coast, who is fitted to utter tbe voice of the Republic upon occasions
of National importance and of international concern; who has youth, independence,
talent, force, ambition, eloquence and a well-established place in the esteem of honest
men. These requisites the State of California expects its Legislature to be able to find
in the man upon whom their choice for United States Senator shall finally fall.
There are especial party reasons why a Republican Legislature should send to
Washington the ablest ana the strongest man within reach of their selection. The
Republican party has just passed through a National campaign, in which the gravest
financial and commercial issues were involved. It has elected a Republican adminis
tration upon the party pledge that the next four years would see
it solve these problems to the satisfaction of the people of all
the United States and with tbe proviso that its failure to do so
would mean its banishment from power at the next election. It therefore rests as a
solemn party duty upon the Republican Congress to enact the wisest legislation pos
sible in order to set these issues at rest. Wise legislation is the product only of wise
and able men, and to such a body it is the doty of Republi
can Legislatures in every State to add increase by the cnoice of
men eminent for their merits, distinguished for their talents, powerful in their
influence and untiringly ambitious to acquire by the excellence of their service the
reward of National fame. The California Legislature owes therefore to-day a most
sacred duiy to the Republican party, the performance of which can only be accom
plished in its choice for United States Senator of the candidate before it whose merits
fill the measure of requirement for this most important piace.
Will the Republican members of the Legislature do their duty to their party and
to California winch the importance of the occasion demands? Will they cast aside
every other consideration save the one that merit alone deserves their support for the
office of Senator and that nothing else should be permitted to determine thelj choice?
Will they vote for the most able, the most vigorons, the most eloquent, the
most unselfish and the least entangled man? Will they prefer brains
to wealth? Will they honor the candidate who beyond all denial
can perform the great and arduous duties of the office with energy, ambition, zeal
and effect, or will they prefer a candidate whose occupancy of the office has given
evidence of none of these qualities nor produced anything of sufficient benefit to
Calitornia to be quoted in favor of his re-election ? What will the Republicans in the
Legislature honor themselves and their party by doing to-day?
HE WHO SEEKS EQUITY.
The organ of Senator Perkins, the San Fiancisco Examiner, has been forced to
drop the cry of boodle and give surcease to the iteration of the charge that "bribery
must be met with bribery." For that Senator Perkins may thank us, since it has
saved him from the trouble of "selling a ship" in order to be able to circulate the
"long green" where the Examiner should decide it would do the most good. The
organ has also for some reason ceased to demand that Perkins should be. made
Senator for another term because of his keen "sense of humor." It has adopted
other tactics and yesterday made play to "terrorize" Republicans who will vote
against Perkins by threatening them with dishonor.
The new tactics of the formerly subsidized organ of the Southern Pacific are as
futile as the first. The Ex a miner cannot procure the appointment of "Long Green'>
Lawrence's bodyguard \o act as releree of legislative nonor. It cannot "terrorize"'
anybody any more, as Mr. Grove L. Johnson remarked in Congress, with a keen "sense
of humor." As a matter of fact, it has fizzled. That is the end of all its attempts to
"worry" Mr. Perkins "into selling a ship" in order that he might pose in the United
States Senate as a great California humorist.
That the charges of dishonor made by the Examiner against Republican legis
lators who will vote against Perkins are mere abnsiveness and worthless is evident not
only by reason of the sources from whicn they come but by reason of the fact that
every promise made to Perkins has been nullified by the falseness of Perkins himself.
"He who seeks equity must do equity." No contract is binding upon one party when
the other has violated it in letter and in spirit. Senator Perkins, by breaking
h.s pledges to others, has relieved them from any obligation to him based upon his
pledges.
The case of Assemblyman Brierling, specifically cited by the Examiner
yesterday, is a good illustration of the general rule. That Mr. Brierling is a
most estimable citizen in private life and is one of the stroneest and most popular
representatives of Alameda is not denied even by the fakers of "Long Green" Law
rence. . He voted for Perkins in the attempted caucus, but now announces adetermin
ation to vote against him. For that reason the Examiner charges him with dishonor,'
notwithstanding the fact that he gave to the Examiner itself abundant and good
reasons for his course.
It is proper that Mr. Brierling should be heard in his own defense. What he said
is thus reported in the Examiner itself:
I feel that I have done all that I owe to Senator Perkins. If he were a warm personal
friend of mine, to whom I had promised my open support, the matter might be different. But
I have done my duty to the convention that nominated me, and I feel tnat I am wholly
absolved from any machine-made pledges to support him any longer on that ground. Besides
all this, I do not feel that Senator Perkins has treated Judge Waymire rightly at all, and Judge
Waymire is a personal f riena of mine. I came back to Oakland from the Capitol to consult my
constituency upon this matter, as far as I have investigated, and I have seen a great many
prominent citizens of this district, not more tban one in ten want me to vote for Perkins. One
man in West Berkeley said he would bring me a petition signed by 2000 against Per Kins if I
would give him a little time.- lam not going to be guided by those outside my district against
the wishes of those who elected me. How I shall vote on next Tuesday I have not yet decided
I feel free to use my own personal judgment.
It should be borne in mind that this statement passed through the Examiner office
and lias been weakensd as far as the editors and fakers of that journal dared to do it.
It, is nevertheless strong, sufficient and convincing. It makes clear three things:
First, that Perkins obtained instructions in his favor by ex pane processes; second,
that Perkins ana bis managers have broken their promises to the friends of Way mire;
third, that the constituents of Mr. Brierling desire him to vote against Perkins. What
honorable man on tnat showing would do other than Mr. Brierling has decided to do?
It is not for Senator Perkins, nor for those wbo are acting for him, to denounce
pledge-breakers, since he and they are themselves the guilty parties. It is not for
Willie Hearst and "Long Green" Lawrence to talk of honor, since they have too rare
"a sense of humor" to know what honor requires, either in precept or cractice. It is
the duty of a legislator to vote for the election to the United States Senate of the can
didate who in office will be the most faithful to tbe interests of tbe State, the Nation
and the people and who will support them with the most ability, force and eloquenc?.
It is also the duty of the legislator to take counsel with his constituents and with the
leaders of his party in determining which candidate has the confidence of the people
and is best fitted to fulfill the duties of a Senator. That Mr. Brierling has done, and
whoso imputes that to him as dishonor is himself dishonored by the practice of
slander.
"HE WHO seeks equity must
do equity." When Senator
Perkins anÂ« 4 his managers
broke the promises by which
they obtained pledges of sup
port in the Legislature they
removed the foundation on
which the â¢ support was to be
based, and the pledges fall of
themselves. A broken pledge
is evidence of intent to deceive
at the time the pledge was
given, and it is not ; within
reason that the deceived party
is to be bound when the de
ceiver goes free, i
A FAST AND LOOSE CAUCUS.
The more the claims of Mr. Perkins'
managers that their ineffectual attempt
to hold a caucus had or could have had
any binding effect are considered, the more
absurd and inconsistent they appear. It
is asserted, for example, that there are
about thirty-five members of the Legisla
ture who received tbe nominations of
county conventions which at tbe same
time passed resolutions instructing their
nominees to bis support. These thirty
five men were present at tbe alleged caucus
of last Monday night. The remaining
members of the Legislature who were aisj
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1897.
present at that conference were not in
structed.
The question which presents itself is
this: Suppose the caucus bad been at
tended by all of the Republican legislators
and that the majority of its members
had voted in favor of another man than Mr.
Perkins, would the thirty-five instructed
Perkins men have- been bound thereby ?
Would not tbe managers of Mr. Perkins'
tight have at once claimed that a caucus
could not compel members of the Legis
ture to violate their former pledges?
Would the instructed men not have re
fused to act in accordance with the will of
the caucus upon tbe ground that it did
not accord with the will of their constitu
ency? Would the action of the caucus
not have been entirely nullified by this
view on the part of the instructed portion
of it?
It must be evident that such would
have been the case, and, being bo,
the query arises, What kind of a cau
cus it is which can only have binding
force in favor of a single candidate for tbe
senatorsbip and is void and of no effect in
lavorof any other candidate. What sort
of a fast-and -loose caucus was that of last
Monday any way ? It see in 3 to have been
a kind of a "Heads-I-win-tails-you-lose"
affair, at least as far as the uninsimcted
members of the Legislature were jod
cerned. If they voted /or Mr. Perkins
they were bound, but if they sbould have
voted for any other candidate the instructed
members would not have been bound. It
will be seen at a glance that such a thing as
a caucus could not possibly exist under sue
unfair and uneven conditions, and that no
member of the Le.isiature who, out of
courtesy, was present at the conference to
which Mr. Perkins' managers have vainly
attempted to give the title and dignity of
a caucus, is in the slightest degree bound
thereby, or by any action whatever taken
thereat.
WILLIE HEARST'S POLITICS-
The action of the Examiner in turning
abruptly from a campaign for free silver
and free trade to give to a Republican candi
date for United States Senator every form
of support which its coarseness can device
or its peculiar "sense of humor" suggest
is no accidental inconsistency. It is a
part of the political policy mapped out for
his papers by Willie Hearst in the begin
ning of the canvass and maintained with
as much show of decency as they are capa
ble of by both the Examiner and the New
York Journal ever since.
We reprint this morning an editorial of
the New York Journal of July 10 of last
year in which the Hearst policy is clearly
stated. In that article it i 3 declared to be
the duty of Democrats to vote for Bryan
for President and goldbugs for Congress,
or, as Mr. Hearst put it, "sound-money
Congressmen and the National ticket."
Thus it was designed for the Examiner and
the Journal to play a clever trick upon
both the Democratic party and the public.
It will be remembered the Examiner gave
little encouragement and no effective sup
port to Democratic candidates for Congress
during the campaign, and is now scorn
fully refusing to give even a complimen
tary mention to any Democratic aspirant
for the Senate.
Mr. Hearst's policy, therefore, while in
consistent with any established rule of
political morality, is at least consistent
wiih itself. It has the element of humor
in it in the same sense that a gold-brick
swindle may be accounted a practical joke.
If it were possible to eliminate from the
mind tie consciousness of the rascality
which prompted such a policy there would
be amusement in watching the antics by
which it has been carried out.
Fresh from a campaign in which it
made every effort to array labor azainst
capital, in which it denounce 1 every cor
poration as a conspiracy against the poor,
and portrayed every member of a corpora
tion as an oppressor of workingmen, a
robber of the needy, a public plunderer and
a human hog, the Examiner, with a total
disregard for the public "sense of humor,"
now turns round, and with an equal
fierceness of vituperation advocates the
election to the Senate of a man who is at
once a member of a corporation and a
millionaire, and therefore the sum of all
which but a short time ago it had been
denouncing as the " blood-sucking plu
tocracy which is ruining the country."
When Willie Hearst demands the ad
vocacy of such a policy of duplicity by bis
papers it is not to be wondered that they
take to sensations as to strong drink. It
is not strange that to them flippancy
should be better than seriousness and the
ridiculous more desirable than dignity.
Being called upon to exercise not merely
a versatility and agility of mind, bnt all
sorts of erratic antics, it is but a natural
result that the Examiner and the Journal
should regard the world as a circus, them
selves as the biggest clowns in it, and be
come so enamored of their fooling as to
demand that Senators of the United
States should be elected solely for their
"sense of humor."

SPOiS ON THÂ£ SUN.
The only symptom of solar disturbance on
January 1 was a small, scattered group on the
southeast quadrant of the sun's disk. During
the following days it decreased to one solitery
spot of small size, which is still visible, though
near the westera limb.
On the morning of January! a very large spot,
chiefly composed of one umbra or nucleus, en
circled by a wide penumbral region, and a
curving penumbral trail attached, was several
degrees inside the southeast limb. It had
Sun Spots Observed January 11 at
2 P. M.
changed little in general outline on January
5, except that the less foreshortened view
showed it to be of unusual size, and measure
ment proved that it was but a few degrees
south of the sun's equator, an nnusnal posi
tion, as the equatorial zones are generally free
from spots. The nmbra of a spot, probably de
pendent on the direction of the surrounding
movement', takes many shapes, being often
oval, triangular, pear-shaped, etc., and the re
semblance of tl.is large umbra to a flower with
protruding streamers was quite remarkable on
the morning of January G. It lost this form
on the following dar, but was enlarging, and
when near the center of the disk and free from
the effect of foreshortening on January 8, was
found to b3 about 36,000 miles in length,
while the encircling penumbra and trail ex
tended more than 100,000 miles in a north
west-southeast direction.
la telescopic view the dark umbra shows
signs of dividing, though durability often ac
companies depth of lint, and it may last for
some weeks. On one bord-r of this umbra is a
white space into which the encircling penum
bra has not encroached, but this is a frequent
feature in sun-spot formation. A few degrees
in advance on the disk is a small curving spot,
no doubt a product oi the same disturbing
force. From a record of the solar disturbances
of December last it appears that about the
18th a iargc, scattered group, extending over
30 degrees, was on the southwest portion of
the disk, and this present spot may be a devel
opment of that group, as such phenomena
often continue near the same point for weeks
or months, reappearing at the east limb about
every twenty-five days, as the vaporous lumi
nary rotates on its axis. Prediction, how
ever, is impossible as solar activity is fitful,
especially at this stage of the eleven-year
cycle. The large spot of last September,
though In the snn's northern hemisphere, was
also in the equatorial zone, which unwonted
positions may have some significance in con
nection with the approaching sunspot mini
mum in 1893-99. As that stage of comparative
inactivity is gradually attained the surface is
Iree from spots for days and weeks at a time
during the preceding years, though as at
present an occasional great disturbance show s
that solar storms are only partially subject to
the unknown restraining influence that cre
ates the eleven-year cycle.

A CONDITION, NOT A THEORY.
A Btatekknt in the New York Journal, July 10. 1896. of Willie Hearsts Policy to Sup
port Bryan for President and Goldbugs for Congress.
The platform adopted yesterday at Chicago, admirabio in everything else, outlines a finan
cial policy that is not satisfactory to Eastern Democrats, nor to the more thonghtful ones of
the West and South. It Involves confusion,' distress, and, as regards existing contracts, partial
repudiation.
Recognizing these unpleasant facts, what is the practical "condition that confronts us f
If the alternative were between the free, unlimited and independent coinage of silver at 16 to
1 and McKinleyism, with its gigantic National sweating system for the profit of unscrupulous
wealth, our situation would indeed be embarrassing. But It is not quite as bad as that. The
election of a free-silver President would not necessarily mean the free coinage of silver. Al
such a President could do would be to sign a bill passed by both homes of Congress. It is ab]
soluteiy impossible for tne silver men to capture the House of Representatives without gross
dereliction on the part of the friends of sound money. The question for us, therefore, is
whether we ought to try to elect a President who is independent, upright and progressive
free from any compromising entanglements with sinister forces, and enlightened in his views
on all subjects but one, but whose ideas on one topic that is never likely to come before him
for official action are unsound, or whether we should prefer a man mortgaged to a corrupt
oligarchy that would make his administration a National scandal.
We say nothing about the possibility that the Democratic candidate himself, sobered by
the responsibilities ot power, may fail to live up to the fanatical platform of an excited con
vention. Buch things have happened-Mr. Cleveland, "the Apostle of Tariff Reform," re->
pndiated the tariff plank on which he was elected. But leaving that consideration out of
account, the House of Representatives can be made a sure bulwark against any danger from
the free-silver views of the nominee, and there is nothing else that could give any Democrat a
shadow ol an excuse for voting for McXinley, with all that that name implies. Of course, if
if there were two Democratic candidates in the field the situation would be complicated. At
present, however, the choice 1s between the regular Democratic nommet and McKlnley, and
in such circumstances the duty of Democrats admits of ao doubt. It is to vote for sound
money Congressmen and the National ticket

MODERN AND ANCIENT EGYPT.
A t harming Entertainment by the Rev.
Hassett Smith of England.
The auditorium of the Young Men's
Christian Association was fairly well filled
last evening by those who appreciate good
things of the intellectual variety. Rev.
Hassett Smith of England delivered an
other of bis interesting lectures, illustrated
by stereopticon views. His subject was
"Egypt," and though many have spoken
and written of that remarkable country
still the Rev. Mr. Smith presented his sub
ject in a manner that never gave rise to
the thought that it was a tale told many
times.
The speaker had traveled over Egypt
many times, and being a scholar in the
true sense of the word be was able to tell
of what be bad seen and of wtiat he knew
of its history, its rulers, people, customs
and its boundless wealth of monuments,
etc. In all of this the stereopticon played
no small part, for it assisted Mr. Smith in
taking his audience to Cairo, up the M!e,
to the pyramids, to the ruins of ancient
Memphis, Thebes, and to the University
oJLOn, that existed more centuries than
the modern colleges have years. It is
rarely that the ancient history of a coun
try is so ably presented as by this gentle
man, for by the aid ot bis fine views he
took his audience back through the ages,
or rather brought the past ages up to the
present for their entertainment.

ba renewed if such a course be deemed ad
visable.

MUSICIANS TO
FORM A CLUB
They Organize an Exclusive
Society in This
City.
Only Professional Players Can
Gain Admittance to Mem
bership.
The New Rooms Will Have Comforts
Not Afforded at the Union
' Headquarters.
The musicians of San Francisco have a
new and somewhat exclusive club of their
own, and all they now need is a cozy set
of rooms to make everything complete.
They have perfected their organization,
elected officers and a board of trustees
and given the club a name, in addition to
which by-laws and a constitution have
been adopted.
The name of the new society is the
"Orpheus Musical Club of San Francisco."
The objects are stated as purely socialâ
the friendly intercourse of professional
musicians, and this implies the advance
ment of ; members in the social scale. &\y
the qualifying word "professional" con- f.
siderable stress is laid by the clubmen, as
it is said to convey to a musician the idea
that its possessor is not merely a follower
of some mechanical craft or commercial
occupation and playing for pay whenever
the opportunity offers, but a man whose
life is exclusively devote i to music.
In the Musicians' Union in tnis City
there are several mem tiers who work at
trades during the day and give their spare
time to musical engasem^nts. They don t
come under the professional category, it
seems, since they cannot get into the Or
pheus Club. Also, there is another fine
line drawn by the club with regard to ad
mission of members â one that can be da
termined only by the discretion and feel
ings of those clubmen who cast the
ballot. One black ball in ten will keep
the applicant out in the cold, and if the
members should decide that he is not
possessed of the requisite social or per
sonal qualifications he cannot get into the
select circle.
The Orpheus Club is fashioned after
clubs of musicians in New York and
other Eastern cities. There a man must
be in high standing in his profession be
fore he . can join the clvb â a | recognized
rule which is said to have a certain bene
ficial influence upon the profession. The
effect is that of decree upon the profes
sional spirit among musicians.
That the club is to be exclusive may be
seen in the limit placed upon the total
membership. The extreme number of its
members shall not exceed 150, and the
active workers in the club say ie may not
reach anywhere near that figure. A club
man explained yesterday that that limit
would include all tne professional musi
cians In San Francisco, or at least the bet
j ter element, if lines must be drawn.
Membership in the Orpheus Club does
not mean any decrease or weakness in the
Musicians' Union. Members of the club
will retain their allegiance to the pro
tective 1 association and continue as en
thusiastic supporters of the union idea as
ever before. The club is , simply a. cJub
and nothing more. "Like the Press Club
or any of the clubs," said Charles Cas-i
sasa, the bandleader. ]
Mr. Cassasa with two of his colleagues
organized, the club, and almost immedi
iately the movement gained in momentum
and spirit, so that in a week or two it has
become a reality.
A meeting was held yesterday at 20
O'Farrell street. About thirty-live char
ter members were present. E. E. Schniitz,
leader of the Columbia Orchestra, was
elected president; E. Rosner, leader of the
Orpheum orchestra, vice-president; A.
I Guiterson, second vice-president; Henry
Susman, secretary, and Charles Harrison,
treasurer. The trustees elected are Henry
Heyinan, A. Spadina and : L. Riizau. J.
Keogh was elected librarian. .
A constitution and by-laws were adopted
and the new organization was called the
Orpheus Club of San Francisco. It was
decided to , close the charter roll when
sixty professional musicians had signed it.
The number of members is already pretty
close to that limit, and the next business
for consideration will be the selection and
furnishing of clubrooms in some central
location downtown. .

For weeks and we<?in the wind lias
blown steadily from the southeast, and in
consequence all the schoo.i^rs and lumber
vessels from, the north are away nebind
time, Sunday last the wind veered around
to the northwest and last n.L:ht one of the
biggest fieeta on record got in. Among the
arrivals was the ship Ycsemite. with a
cargo of coal from the Roslyn mine for R.
D. Chandler. The captain, reports that
during the entire trip it was nothing but
a succession of calms, contrary winds and
dense fog. When within an easy day's
sail of San Francisco the vessel was lying
like a log on the ocean, without a breath
of wind, the only motion coming from the
lons green rollers as they passed under
her keel or broke against the side.
The Yosemite brings one of the first car
goes of Roslyn coal that nas come to San
Francisco. The mine is to the east of the
Cascade Mountain?, and wuiie opened up
years ago was not developed until lately.
It is now in sneh. a condition that on an
emergency 600t>tuns a day can be put out.
The Northern Pacific Railway thir.ks so
ranch of the outlook that it has expended
$100,000 m erecting bunkers and snipping
iacuiues at Tacoma for t;;e handling of
the fuel. it is asserted by coal men that
the Roslyn article is as zood as Welling
ton and can be sold 25 per cent cheaper.
A sreat tning in its favor is the fact that
Roslyn coal comes from American soil
and Wellington coal from British soil.

STRUCK THE BAR
ON HER WAY OUT
The City of Peking Had
a Very Narrow
Escape
Will Be Decked When She
Returns Here From China
This Month
. A Resurv-y of t&s Bar Demanded, as
Many Mariners Think It Is
Stealing.
. i Â , .
**Is the bar outside the Golden Gate
shcallng or not?" la a question that is
worrying pilots, towboat men and captains
just hot.
In. . 1374 Professor , George Davidson of
the Untied States Coast and Geodetic Sas*
vey made a thorough examination of the
entrance to the port and soundings martea
on the present cnart were all made By hi 3
assistants, la Htfl Lieutenant E. D. Taas
sig made a cursory examination . and re
ported no change in the state of affairs.
Thus, in fact, since 1574 there has teen no
official soundings made and juat what
state the bar is in no one really knows."
A couple of years ago the ship Palestine,
coal laden, from Nanaimo, B. C, struck
on the bar ana went down. Her remains
are still lying to the south of the whistling
ceo?. The captain at the time asserted
that ha wan in the regular channel.
On December 13 last the British four
masted ship Centesima struck when being
wed in and had not the tug's hawser
held she would have shared the fate of the
Pares tine.
It waa neither the .Palestine nor Cenie3
ima that started the inquiry, however. It
wa3 the case of the Pacific Halt Company's
City of Peking. The big steamer sailed
from here for the Orient on December 1
and crossing the bar through the main
channel with all the elements in
her favor sixties heavily. In fact so
heavy was the ;! contact that every
body rushed on deck and the vessel hove
to for an hour in order to ascertain what
damage had been done. For quite a while
Captain Smith, the pilot, and the officers
of the vessel discussed the advbabilitv of
returning to port. 'When it was learned
that the vessel was making no water and
that apparently no damage had been done
the pilot was put aboard the pilot-boat
and Captain Smith started away for his
destination. A cursory examination of
the hull was made at Hongkong, but no
injury could be found. Nevertheless when
the vessel gets back to San Francisco she
will go on the Hunter's Point drydock.
The City of Peking is one of the best
built ships afloat, and not many vessels
would have stood the bump she got and
have escaped without . injury. : She is 408
feet long. 47 feet broad and 19 feet 5 inches
deep, and 5<J7a. 62 gross tonnage. She had
an unusually heavy cargo aboard and a
large passenger list, so when she struck it
can easily be imagined what consterna
tion there must have been aboard. \
Many of ? the pilot*"- were interviewed
yesterday in regard to the changes on the
bar r but one and all seemed to think it
was in just the same condition that it was
twenty years ago. "Ia places .changes
have taken place," said Captain Jordan,
''but they do not amount to a great deaL
The main channel may have shoaled a
little, but I don't thin* there : la any per'-.
ceptible change in the north and sooth
channels, â â - As to the" striking of the City i
of Pelting, i don't know anything about it
and ' I don't know "which * pilot '<. took her
oat."
"We have the Government chart to go
by," said Captain Barber, '"acd we can't
go behind that; The sailing directions

infractions ; he cannot '\ be ;, 5 blamed. 'V I
think fit was .. Captain â â  Smith;'*. who '-: has' :

had charge of "the = City ' of : : Peking. If
there is any shoaling of course the United
States Coast .â  and ..Geodetic â¢ Survey, office
would at once notify us." r : '.
â -.- "Has the bar shoaled? i I really cannot
tell," was the answer Captain Westhoff,
the I authority' on such matters in fthÂ» of
fice of I the United States , Coast k and Geo
detic . Survey, gave. Alter' y giving -his
answer he .went Jto a ' pile of charts and
taking oat the only one on â  that ; section
ever ' made l he spread :it oat ;on a table, j
Then \he remarked: "You say the ' City ,of j
Peking went out through the main chan- i
nel. Well, then, it mast have been a tine I
day and no break on the bar. Of all the
entrances the main. channel is the shal
lower, having only thirty -one fee: of
water ia some places; but it is also, the
narrowest strip of sand along the en
trance. Now, the City of Peking ia a long
ship, out not long enough to cover two
sea.}. Thus one may have thrown her
stern up and. the second breaking aboard
drove, her a tern, down on the bar. It can
not have been, her stem that struci, be
cause in that event serious damage would
hay* been done."
The result of the whole matter is that
the Me Arthur, cow at Mare Island, will be
sent out to majce another survey of the
bar in ail probabt.ity.

The Old Beard of Directors of
* the De.unct Bank Is -.
Re-elected.
An Interesting Report en tie
Finances of tils Bank Filed
" by the Secretary.
The annual meeting of the directors of
the People's Home Savings Bank was
held yesterday in the Mills building.
Notwithstanding the large amoaat of
business transacted the meetins was very
qaietÂ» contrary to .com Ecoa, expectation,
the principal item of "note being the resig
nation of General John F. Sheehan as
manager.
There were 4352 shares represented at
the session, held almost In. entirety by the
friends ot the present directors. W. J.
Bartnatt was preaen; with J. C. Johnson's '.
proxy, representing 2Â£,50 depositors,, with |
claims aggregating over $725,000. Bart- '
natt himself held five shares and George
B. Conant forty-two, making a 'total of
forcy-ieven united in purpose, bat these
were only a dro? in the bucket as against
the balance of 4906 share?. Mr. Bartnett
accordingly could do no more than protest
against tne course of proceedings.
Chairman George Stone said that so far
as the affaire of the bank were concerned
the pa.it year had been one of general dis
appointment. Demands for lands had
Ceea small, and consequently sales had
been few. Many lawsuits had been begun.
and it wad found expedient in many cases
tv compromise.

lodge (lonian Refused to Accept Two
Bonds That Dewey's Attorney
- Presented to Him.
Judge Conlan'bas in his possession two
bonds for I2OCO each, which he refused to
accept for the release of E. P. Djway, who
waa held, to answer tefore the Superior
Court on Thursday en a charge of forgery-
Dewey is the man who was arrested on
a charge cf swindling a large number of
1 merchants by what is known as the '"fate
; directory" scheme; thai is, getting the
merchants to sign contracts for a small
sum for an advertisement in the directory
and afterward raising the amount. .
The first bond presented to the Judge
by Thomas K. Ease, .Dawey's attorney,
had on it as sureties W. A. Dawes, 146
Eddy street, and & T. Mecca-?, 917 Larkin
street. Dawea was dismissed from the
police force in April. 1694. He qualified,
on two lots in the city of Oakland of the
value of $13C0, being lots 21 and 22, black 3,
Alameda Tract, East Oakland, and the
northeast- aaarter section 6, township 12
north, ran?e 14, El Dorado County, of the
value of $3500. Metcalf qualified on three
town lots, with improvements,, situated
iÂ» Aalioch, Contra Costa County, of the
value of $3000, and the lodging- 917
Larkin street, of the value of $30CO.
The Judge refused to accept the bond
and yesterday morning Sase presented
the second bond. Dawea' name had been
withdrawn and Stefano Rovesrno, 715
Lombard street, was substituted. "Rovegno
qualified on a large lot on the scuta side
of Market street, between Fourteenth, and
Fifteenth, with improvements, the value
exceeding $ 12,000. The assessment-roll
! waa examined and Rdvegno's name was
not upon it as owner of tie property de
scribed. The bond was accordingly not
accepted by the Judge.
In view of the unsuccessful attempt .to
pet Dewey . released on bands which thÂ«
Jcige considered worthless he increased
Dewey'* bonds from $2000 to *.50CQ.
The Jzdge instructed BauiS Kelly to
investigate into t c attempt 10 get him
to accept the bonds, and" it was learned
that the sceme was apparently engineered
by A. M. Bariey, who has figured on
many occasions as the moving spirit in
the "straw Bond" business.
Barley about three weeks ago was
warned by Policeman Wagner to keep
away from tne corridors of the City Half
on pain or arrest. He din. so till Saturday
morning, when he was seen talking in the
Larkin -street corridor with; Attorney
Ivase. Ha was also seen in the corridor
yesterday morning. Wagner spoke ;to
aim and he explained his presence in the
corridor by stating he was plaintiff in a
case in Justice of tae Peace Barry's court,
which waa to be heard in the afternoon.
One of the-' cases of ."straw - bonds'* in
winch Barley figured was that of Leo de
Card ova. A few days after he was arrested
bonds were forthcoming, but it waa after
ward found : that they â¢ were '. worthless.
Detective Cody waa detailed on the case
and he rearrested Cardova, who was kept
in prison till he tarnished satisfactory
beads. There was afso the case of Levi
Gordon, an ex-policeman. Barley cot
?2U from him to procure hla release on
bonds. Judge Conlan accepted the bonds
and Gordon was released. The Judge
later discovered that the bonds were prac
tically worthless, and was so indignant
tnat he made it his business to personally
search for Gordon, and captured him one
day after a hot chase.

LEFT ALONE, SHE
WENT INSANE
Mrs. Gratz Bueter Com
mitted to the Agnews
Asylum.
Mrs. Pettee Says It Is Because
Her Children Were Taken
From Her.
She acd Sister Julia Will Demand
That the Affair Be Invas
tigated.
Mrs. John Pettee declares that Mrs.
Gratz Bueter has been driven insane by
having her two little children torn away
from her. Yesterday Mrs. Bueter was ad
judged to be insane and a commitment
was made out to send her to tbe asylum
at Agnews. A part of Mrs. Bueter's story
has previously been told. Mrs. Pettee
supplies the remainder.
"I met Mrs. Bueter New Year's eve,"
said Mrs. Pettee last evening. "She told
me that she was hungry and that she had
no food or money. I got a dinner for her
and visited her room at 272 Stevenson
street. She had her two little children,
aged 2 and 3 years, pretty little ones. I
noticed that everything around her room
while it was poor was in order. What I
saw also showed rue that she was a lonely
mother. She was perfectly sane, but weak
of nerves because she was hungry.
"I saw her after that and she was per
fectly sane. In fact, she has been made
insane only by tbe taking away of her
two children, and that was outrageous.
Pool thins. When I heard that she had
been taken to the prison at the new City
Hall I went to see" her. She threw her
arms around me and begged for the love
of God that I would see that they did not
keep her 'little dears,' as she called them,
from her. 'Oh,' she said, 'they will drive
me insane if they do.'
"Sister Julia and myself visited her. I
was with ncr to-day wnen she was laken
away to tbe court. If she was insane she
lias oeen made so by taking away her
children."
Sister Juiia expressed the &ame view of
the case yesterday. She went to the oltice
of Secretary Welch of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children yester
day, and upon the order of President
Sonntag of the society, who is Mrs. John
Pettee's brother, secured a ietter request
ins that Mrs. Bueter's children, who are
in the Girls' Directory, should be handed
over to Sister Julia, wi.o will seek to be
made their guanlian.
"Mrs. Bueter has begged and prayed for
ncr children," said Sisier Julia yesterday.
"She has been driven crazy b} r losing
them. She has committed no offense.
She was arrested for crueltyro children .
She relies on rue to give her a chance to
see them asain. There is no reason in
all humanity why she should not 3ce
them."
Sister Julia will ask for the custody of
the children to-day.
Mrs. Bueier went last Friday to the of
fice of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children and asked for aid.
She overheard some conversation that led
her to thiiik she was going to lose her
children. She grew very much excited
and was taken to the City Prison on the
charge of cruelty to children. At the City
Prison her children were taken from her
and she became almost frantic, and even
tually had to be placed in a padded cell.
Mrs. Pettee declares that she will have an
investigation of all the facts.

DURRANT PLAYS
HIS LIST CARD
i Final Papers at Last Filed
in the Supreme
Court.
Reasons in a Brief Why the
Defendant Should Not
Be Hanged.
The Dfcis : ou Will Be Final, and on
It Hangs Life or D?ath for
Durrani.
The final papers in the Durrant appeal
i case were fiied in the Supreme Court late
' yesterday afternoon by General Dickinson
I and Eugene N. Deuprey. They were the
i appellant's reply brief, following the vo
j luminous brief filed by the respondents
i some time ago. The reply brief com
| prises about seventy Dages of printed mat
ter. This places the case fully before the
j Supreme Court, and there is now nothing
| for William Henry Theodore Durrant to
i do but wait a little while longer for tbe
decision of that tribunal as to whether he
shall finally be hanged or not.
It is also contended that there are many
assertions of opinion in the argument in
behalf of the respondent which are not
justified by the record.
The point is made that others bad keys
and free access to the church the same as
Durrant, The respondent's argument re
vealed, in an effort to identify the mur
dered girl with church societies, an at
tempt to heighten the degree of friendship
between her and Durrant, and it is set
forth that this LÂ« nullified by the testi
mony of Maud Lamont.
Taking up tbe thread of evidence and
argument at the Normal School, the
brief states t:>at no conflicting statements
were made by the defendant to third per
sons, and that it is perfectly plain that
the defendant was not lost sight of at Poik
and Sutter streets on April 3, and that the
testimony of Durrant in this regard i-s
confirmed by detective authority.
Tbe nrief attacks the evidence of Mrs.
Vogel, and says that "the testimony vol
unteered by this witness, aside from the
regular planned story, consists of little
excursions which lead her into pitfalls."
Iv support of this argument are cited her
identification of the picture of Durrant
and her statements in regard to the $300
deposited with her by some one. The
brief states that ie is not likely that any
THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1897.
-1 body would mistake this old lady for a
safety-deposit vault.
It gof>s on to argue at length that the
stories of Mrs. Vog?l and Miss Edwards as
to the manner in which Blanche Lamont
left the Normal School are very contradic
tory. For instance, Mrs. Vogel says that
Durrant jumped on the car alter her, an r J
I hat the car left right away, while Miss
Edwards contradicted herself in her testi
mony in regard to their leaving the oar at
Market and Powell streets. In regard to
the considerable testimony as to the kin d
of a hat Durrant wore, there was nothing
peculiarly distinctive in it. Mrs. Voxel's
eyesight must have become suddenly re
markably good to have detected the
color of Dnrrant's budding mustache.
It is also presented as incongruous and
showing an unreliability of memory that
one of these schoolgirls taken to the City
Hall to identify Durrant said he was
brought into the room with his hat off,
and mother said hecame in with his hat
on. Stress is laid on the difference in the
testimony as to the time the pair arrived
at the church and the time it took them to
walk the block from the cars to the churcn
on the fatal afternoon. It is also argued
that if George King, the organist, was a
friend of Durrant he would not i aye told
anything of his own volition. A conflict
in the testimony of King and Sademan as
to tbe smell of gas in the church is also
dwelt upon. It is argued that if the
bromo-seltzer drank by Durrant after
coming down the stairs with hair dishev
eled nauseated him is it any wonder
that when he went home he ate but little?
A point is made in the testimony of
Oppenheimer, the pawnbroker, that the
kind of rin_- pawned at his place is made
by the dozen. The fact that there were
blocks at the head of the murdered girl is
brought prominently into contrast with
the testimony of a member of the faculty
of Cooper Medical College that blocks
were never so placed at that college, where
the deiendant was a student.
The brief states that the murderer,
"whoever he was," left but three traces:
First, the track on the belfry stairs, which
the police neglected to measure or take
cognizance of; second, the marks on the
girl's neck, which the autopsy physician I
neglected to preserve, when a measure of
the tinger-nail marks would have assisted
greatly in the identification of the mur
derer; third, the handwriting ontthepack
nse of rings addressed to Mrs. ftoble,
which the District Attorney failed to
prove as the defendant's.
A large portion of the brief is devoted
to argument and the presentation of de
cisions as to the legality of Crocker and
Nathan serving as jurors when they had
read so much about the murder in the
newspapers, etc., and to the excusing
from jury service of Juror Brown. It is
argued that there is nothing in the record
to show any motive on the cart of the de
fendant and mat the l?cture notes of the
defendant and the rollbook of Cooper
Medical Collese are silent witnesses of
where the defendant was on the afternoon
of April 3 as compared with wnere he is
alleged to have been "by schoolgirls and a
trio of women suffering from senility."
It is also presented that a large portion
of the jurors selected were not citizens,
wore non-residents, were deaf and exempt
from jury duty; that the case of the
prosecution is based absolutely op tbe
flimsiest eharacier of cirenmstantial evi
dence; that the people of this City were
prejudiced against Durrant; that he was
condemned by the newspapers, and that
no life should be sacrificed under these
| circumstances.

sued John J. Haley, who for many years was
known as tiie thirteenth member of the Board

$8000 on a lot 54x104 feet In siza at the cor
uer of Valencia struct and TifTiuy avenue.

No More Dainty Lunches

Expenses of the Government

Mayor Fhelan Vetoed the Last South
cf the Park Survey Payment
Yesterday.
In future jurors in criminal cases will
be compelled to pay lor their meals out of
the compensation received from the City
for their services, no matter how long
tbey are employed.
The matter was discussed at the meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors last even
ing, and it was decided that as long as the
jnrors receive $2 per day for serving i# the
courts they were not entitled to their
meals at the City's expense.
The action of the Health and Police
Committee, in recommending that the
action of the old board in locating the
Pestbouse on the Almshouse Tract be
rescinded, was approved without opposi
tion.
The Hospital Committee sent in a re
port condemning the unsanitary condition
of the City and County Hospital and
recommending that the sewer system of
the institution be repaired, so that the
danger of disease to inmates may be ob
viated.
This was adopted and later Supervisor
Dodge presented a resolution, which was
adopted, appropriating a sum not. exceed
ing $499 for the temporary repairs of the
sewers, so that the objectionable trenches
made to expose the broken pipes may be
tilled in. These repair? are expected to
last until the next tax levy is made, so
that an appropriation for permanent re
pairs may be obtained.
Mayor Pbelan sent a veto message in
refeence to the authorization allowing
Surveyor Tilton his last $5000 payment on
the south of the park survey.
He finds fault with the survey because a
sufficient sewer outlet has not been pro
vided. In closing he says :
In view of the fact that this contract was let
as recently as the 20th day of last March, and
that the contract price was very large for the
extent and character of the work to be per
formed, I believe that the Supervisors should
have an opportunity of examining the work
done and determining for themselves whether
or not the Surveyor should be instructed to
delineate nn outlet which would permanently
answer all the requirements of that sec
tion which is designed to be drained.
And as my approval of the demand would be
conclusive in the matter, I will not take the
responsibility of saying that such an outietâ
if : udeed it can be called one â anstvers the re
quirements of the contract. The payment of
ihe last $5000 becomes due, according to the
terms of ihe contract, immediately upon the
completion of the work aforesaid. If said out
let docs not answer the requirements of the
contract then the work of the Surveyor cannot
be siid to be completed, and until the Board
of Supervisors formally accent the work as
completed the last payment has not become
due.
The Committee on Printing and Salaries
submitted a report recommending the
strictest economy on the part of the vari
ous departments, in view of the fact that
the funds are already overdrawn.
The Finance Committee reported that in
future each committee would be furnished
with a weekly statement of the funds
under its control, so that overdrafts may
be avoided.

RUINED BY POKER.
A Young I-oulsiaiuin Bobs His Bene-
factor and la Arrested for Petty
;.;'. : > \ Larceny. â :
Julius Hirsch, 20 years of age, was
booted at the Cily Prison last night by
Detectives Whitaker and Seymour on the
charge of petty farceny.
In September last Hirsch was a guest at
the Russ House, but was ejected for non
payment of his board bill. T. E. Wiley,
who is emDloyed in the coiners' depart
ment of the United States mint, was also a
guest at the Russ House, and he took
pity upon the younir fellow, whose parents
are prominent citizens of Louisiana, and
paid for his meals and bed.
Wiley bad occasion to ro to his ranch in
tbe country, and while there Hirsch broke
open his trunk in his room in the Russ
House and stole numerous articles of
value â in fact he emptied it of its con-
ents.
Wiley was prepared to suffer tbe loss
rather than prosecute the young follow,
and would not report the matter to tbe
police. '.The manager of the hoiel was not
so indulgent and he notified tbe police on
Sunday.
Whitaker and Seymour were detailed
on the case and soon found Jrlirsch. Yes
terday they recovered most of the stolen
property. Outof compassion for the young
fellow Wiley insisted that only a change
of petty larceny should be booked against
him.
Hirsch is a victim to poker games that
flourish in several saloons along Market
street, where i c lost all his money and fell
so low as to rob his benefactor to get more
funds to lose at poker. Hirsch confessed
his crime and told the officers where to eet
the property.

Whenever You Feel at All Out of Sorts
LookOut for Gripâ What To Do.
Nearly every physician, every scientist
and every sufferer has been asking", tni3
creat question: What stbe Grip?" Some
have "asserted tbat it is a dangerous mi-
crobe which comes into the system, breeds
several millious every second, and â  soon
overruns the body with disease.; Others
have said that we are passing through a
region of star-dust; and that the minute
particles are drawn into the body with
every breath. Whatever it may. . be, ;it is
certain that it is something within .' the
body which is lighting with the body to
undermine the life. . . . â  "
What would common â¢ sense dictate in
such an emergency?. Counteract the en-
emy. Drive it from the system. Do not
trilte with it. Act promptly and wisely at
the first approach of the symp;oms which
you can readily detect. Take something
which can counteract iheir deadly influ-
ence. j Spirits of some kind are the best
things to take, and whiskey isÂ» preferable
to any other kind of spirits. But it should
be borne very car fully in mind that only
pure whiskey. will hava the effect,- and it
snou'.a also be remembered that Duffy's
pure malt whiskey stands at the f head of
all preparations and is the only medicinal
whiskey upon- the market. . There are
many unscrupulous dealers who will as-
sure "you that any whiskey will answer the
purpose, but they are wrong and are try-

Failure to Pass the Lower House of Congress Popularly Viewed as a Great Boon to the State of Cali
fornia and the Country at Large*
It is the opinion of many that in the defeat of the Powers refunding bill by
Conerâ¬ss yesterday by a vote of 102 ayes to 168 noes, Collis P. Huntington, president
of tbe Southern Pacific Company, met his Waterloo. It was the first time that any
legislative bodyâmunicipal, county, State or National-refused to acctde to the
expressed wish of the great railroad magnate. He had an unbroken record of thirty
years of absolute and complete victory in every contest in which he was a party in
interest against the people. Sever before where a direct issue was made by him bad
he met with failure. *
This cattle was popularly spoken of as being and generally admitted by his
- ends and colleagues to be the fight of his 1 fe. And he lost it, "though present on
c battlefield to command and lead his forcesâ lost it by such an overwhelming vote,
thai any return to the attack on his part is looked upon as highly improvable.
It wa* a most decided and glorious triurrph of the people, and particularly for the
reople of the State of California. What its full significance is must remain a matter
cf speculation. In the refnsal of Congress, or at least the House of Representatives,
:o refund and extend the time of payment of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific
railroad debti to the United States Government the first step only has been taken
which is to lead to the emancipation of California from tne oppression of the Southern
Pacific Company, of which the Central Pacific Railroad in a powerful instrument.
This action of the House was only the refusal of a creditor to show further consid
ereiion to a delinquent debtcr. It now remains for tbe creditor to take proceedings
which will compel the debtorsâ in this case the Union Pacific and tho Central Pacific
Railroad companiesâ to meet their liabilities.
It is therefore proper that the next step taken be one to foreclose the mortgage
held by the creditor â the United States â against the property of the debtors â the
Union Pacific and the Central Pacific railroads. It is claimed by the anti-funding
leaders that no formal suit is necessary to bring this about and that the foreclosure
may be effected on the simple demand of the President. To bring this about, how
ever, it may be necessary for Congress to signify its wish in this regard by tne passage
â of an appropriate resolution. On the part of the railroads' attorneys it is claimed that
suit must first be instituted in a court of proper jurisdiction.
Interest in this State centers on the Central Pacific Company. This corporation's
indebtedness to the Government is in round figures about $80,000,000, consisting of
about $25,000,000 on subsidy bonds, with iattrest on same for thirty years at 6 per cent
simple interest.
But from this amount must be deducted about $15,000,000, including principal
and interest paid to bondholders out of the sinking fund of the Central Pacific Com
pany. In addition to this debt due the Government there is also about $25,000,000
due bondholders on bonds issued by the company. Interest on the?e has been paid to
date: These latter bonas are a first lien on the property of the debtor company and
must be assumed by the Government in case the latter decides to foreclose.
It will thus be seen that tlie total indebtedness of the company is about $93,000,000.
As security for this there are 860 miles of railroad, extending fiom San Jose toOjjden,
via Nile*. Lathrop and Sacramento. It is estimated that the road could be replaced
to-day for about $25,000,000.
Iv an interview with Charles F. Crocker, vice-president of the Southern Pacific
Company, yesterday he said he could see no other course on the part of the Govern
ment than foreclosure proceedings, tbough the future action of the Government,
he said, was merely a matter of speculation. "In case of foreclosure," he added, "the
Southern Pacific will be ready to protect its interests." It is inferred from this that
Huntington has anticipated the action of Congress, and has made his preparations
accordinely.
Among well-informed railroad men it is believed that Hunlington's attempt to
buy in the Central Pacific will be made interesting by the competition of the Vauder
biits. The latter now control a continuous chain of roads from New York to Casper,
Wyo., which is within 350 miles of Ogden. Should the Vanderbilta outbid Hunting
ton it will give tnem a through transcontinental line from New York to Sao Fran
cisco, and give California its first genuine competing transcontinental railroad.
POPULAR JUBILATION.
Well-Known Speakers Address a
Mass-Meeting; on Market Streat
and Grant Avenue.
â¢ The rejoicing over the defeat of the fund-
Ing bfcjl took the form of a mass-meeting
on the corner of Market street and Grant
avenue in the evening. Two huge bon
fires were burned at ihe corner, and red
fire lit up ths sea of faces, which extended
Irom 100 feet up Grant avenue nearly
across Market street.
Â» ,The management of the "ceremonies' 1
was under the auspices of the now famous
committee of fifty. Speakers' stands had
teen erected both on Grant avenue and on
Market s:.'eer. The speakers appeared
it one stand and then passed over
and repeated their addresses at the other.
The vast assemblage was addressed by
Hon. Henry E. Highton.VW. N. Coward,
H. M. Dalton, Joseph Liggett, L J. Tru
man, Railroad Commissioner LaÃue,
Mayor Phelan, James H. Barry, Gavin
Ex-Mayor Sutro was informed of the defeat of the refunding bill by a telegram from Charles
M. Sumner, the agent of the committee of fifty at Washington, D..C. He was filled with delight
"over the victory for the people as against the railroad, but he carried himself with characteristic
composure. "This is a decisive victory," he said, "a fortunate ending of the first great battle of
' this campaign.
"But the war is not over, not by any means. I tell you this man Huntington does not
recognize defeat. No, sir, the end is not here. Huntfngton is devilish sly and full of resources.
He will try again. As one way of bringing it up again the bill may be introduced in the Senate.
All his powers of persuasion would be centered on that body to secure its passage. If it succeeded
it would then come to the Speaker's desk in the House with the prestige of success in the Higher
House, and another trial at it there might send it through. We want to still keep on the alert. ,
"However, to-day's vote was a great victory, as I say. We should not underestimate it.
AlKthe flags in San Francisco should be run up to celebrate it. 'Henry,' turning to a man in the
office; 'telephone to the Heights and to the Cliff House to run up all the flags they have there.'
"This is the fourth time this thing has come before Congress and been battled over during
a whole session. It is to be hoped that it is the end of it. We have made the best fight we could
from this distance. 1 deluged the members of Congress with literature. They said that I did not
always use gentlemanly methods. Sometimes I was a little brusque. But I knew whom I was
dealing with. I have had plenty of experience in that line. When I printed on the outside of some
' envelopes-that 'Huntington would not steal a red hot stove,' some of the Congressmen said it was
' not a proper way to treat them. But it had its effect. The way to fight the devil is with fire. Let
us beware, however. The devil is not dead."
I McXab, Supervisor Rottanzi. Dr. Clinton I
! tde rioard of Supervisors, Dr. Salneld and
W. T. BapgÃtt. Judee Schell acted as ;
chairman at the stand on Market street, j
and Arthur Barendt at the platform on j
Grant avenue.
The speeches evoked great enthusiasm
from start to finish, and were frequently
interrupted by cheers at the mention of
the name of Congressman James G. Ma
guire. Editor Barry's speecn was charac
teristic. In part he said :
'â Let as rejoice that Congress says we
' shall be free. Huntington and his min
ions may have debauched other Con
gresses, but this one hud too much man- '
hood :n it to be tempted by his coffers. I
am sorry that 102 vote 3 were tallied for
. him.
"The Civil War is commonly believed to
have ended slavery. It did not. But to
day California, the last of the slave States, \
was set free from the bonds of servitude to j
a grasping and powerful corporation, and :
will move forward Â»from this day the \
queen of the universe.
"Let us not forget to honor the brave
men that have done their duty *> noDly,
anj may the name of James G. Maguire
1c a sweet morsel in the mouths of our
felves and our children and their offspring
for generations to come."
At the conclusion of the speeehmaking, j
which lasted till late, three hearty cheers
were given for Majiuire. the defeat of tlie
4 'unding bill and the support of the Caii
\ iornia press. Then the two bands struck |
np a series of lively tunes. Interludes j
w Â«e also playea during the progress of
the meeting.
On behalf of the Committee of Fifty the
following telegram was sent to Congresi
ttan Maguire at Washington yesterday:
"The Committee of Fifty congratulates Â»
you and our delegation on the success of
your labors on behalf of City and State.
James D. Phelax, Mayor."
UNIVERSAL JOY.
The Defeat of the Funding Bill
Viewed ss the Lifting: of an
Incubus From the S ate.
I^aac Upham, who was a member of the
committee of fifty organized in San Fran
cisco about a year ago for opposition to
the funding bill, expressed his satisfaction
yesterday over the defeat of the measure.
"You know my sentiments oo the sub
ject," he said. "I was opposed to the
iunding bill right along, and was a mem
ber of the committee of fifty, and, did my
share of thework to defeat the biil. My sym
pathies were always against (be bill. Lately
I have not been doing much in tba way
of active opposition, but my sympathies
remained the sameâ l was opposed to re
funding the debts of the Paci6c railways.
"I am glad certainly of the defeat; it is
SUTRO STILL SCENTS DANGER.
a complete victory for California. Only a
few railway men were in favor of the
measure, but almost everybody in the
State was opposed to it. I believe Ihis
sentiment was nnanimous.and for the same
reason the congratulations over the vic
tory are practically unanimous in ali parts
of California to-day."
United States District Attorney H. S
Foote was cautious. "I am not in a posi
tion," fie remarked, "to discuss this ques
tion, particularly as I may be required to
bring ection for foreclosure on the rail
road. Besides lam not in a position to
discuss the action of Congress or any co
ordinate body of tee Government. I have
studiously avoided expressing any opin
ion relative to any public matters in which
the Government is involved."
0. D. Baldwin expressed his extreme
gratification over tne defeat of the meas
ure as follows:
"It means that we have be?n delivered
from slavery. lean hardly express my
self at our good fortune. It means t: at
San F;ancisco and the enrire country will
progress aÂ« they have never done before,
for there will now be a competing over
land raiiroai, and it will, of course, termi
nate in San Francisco. It means that the
tide sf immigration will be turned this
way, and that thousands who have been
kept away on account of exorbitant rail
way rates will eventually be enabled to
remove to California. It means vastly
more to California than it does to any
other State in the Union, and I am sure
the benefit will be permanent.
"I do not anticipate the Government
control of the road, but think the mort

case. With a competing line to Cali
fornia and with our own V,alley road
California's future greatness cannot be
estimated."
Samuel Knight, Assistant United States
District Attorney, was outspoken. He
said:
"I am not in favor of any of the fund
ing measures proposed in Congress, be
cause I cannot see wherein any guarantee
exists tbat their terms would be complied
with and tde debt due the Government be
paid within a reasonable time."
Max Popper rejoices over the deieat of
the funding bill, because he sees in the
circumstance an indication that Congress
is outside of the influence of monopolies
and corporations, and that the will of the
people is tbe law of the lawmakers.
"The press has done -rood work," said
Mr. Popper, "and have been awake to the
atrocious attempt on the part of the Pa
MAYOR PHELAN'S WORDS OF CHEER.
Mayor James D. Phelan showed the deep satisfaction he felt over the defeat of the funding
bill when he delivered an address at the mass-meeting last night.
" The Board of Supervisors of San Francisco by a resolution adjourned this evening," he
said, " and thereby declared that the sentiment of the people of this State is opposed to the fund
ing bill. While we congratulate ourselves it must not be forgotten that a committee of fifty of our
fellow-citizens to fight this bill was organized by that grand old man, who is sincere and honest at
hea/t, the Honorable Adolph Sutro (cheers), and in spite of all considerations he has been badgered
and reviled ; and to him we owe a mead of thanks for this meeting here to-night.
"Another man who has been here and fought for the people's rights since the inception of
the railroad and to whom we may pay our debt of thanks for all he has done in our behalf, is the
Honorable John T. Doyle of Menlo Park.
" The defeat of the funding bill in Congress promises much for the future of California. If
carried to its logical conclusion it will be not an octopus but an incubus that will be lifted from
California. Now, by the defeat of the funding bill, for all practical purposes we'll have a com
peting railway, bringing the rails and the ships together. The Southern Pacific has controlled
commerce and has been so barefaced in its methods as to subsidize the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany so it would not cut rates and defeat it. The millions thus given to the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company were given from the producer, and thus the very purpose for which the company was
ofganized was defeated â the assuring of reasonable rates on freight between the East and Cali
fornia. So by sea and by land we have been cut off. We have been isolated here, and there was
no means of getting out. Congress to-day gives us a way out. There are six competing railroads
to-day waiting at the Missouri River for an outlet to the Pacific. The Central Pacific may be
operated by the Government for the good of the people of California."
cine railroads to evade the payment of
their debts. If tne newspapers had spoken
as fearlessly twenty years ago as they have
lately upon this subject the United States
would not have been duped into that sec
ond mortgage scheme."
A. Quade, grocer, said : "Business men
ought to rejoice, for the defeat of the
measure means their triumph. I think it
is an unjust measure or it would not have
been defeated."
"I am glad it has been defeated," said
W. C. Wise, batter, "for it is a shame that
tne company dared even ask for such a
measure to pass."
J. S. Spiiman, attorney-at-!aw, bad this
to say: "I am glad the biil has been de
feated. Congress has called Cleveland's
bluff, so to speak, and it now behooves
him to enforce tha law."
Sam E. Button, stationer, said: '-If I
should not rejoice at this result I would
not be true to my own interests and those
of the people of this State. It is a great
victory over a grinding, unrelenting
monopoly."
I. J. Truman, president of the Colum
bian Banking Company, said: "Am I re
joiced? Well, well; why should you ask
that question? Of course, I am more man
ordinarily gratified; and why shouldn't I
be? And why shouldn't every man that
wants to live in this part of the country be
glad and rejoice to see the fangs of this
monster corporation made to lei go the
very vitals of the industries of the whole
Stateâ nay, more; of the whole coast.
Yes, put me down as being glad; but I
fear another attempt will be made to
bring tne bill up, but 1 hope not.
George W. Reid, a Clay-street mer
chant, spoKe as follows:
"I have not I.card any news for years
that has given me more pleasure than that
of the result of the vote just received.
Now we merchants can consider that the
power of this oppressive monopoly is
about to terminate ana the supremacy of
the people asserted instead. In the course
of time shippers can with some certainty
FREEDOM FROM RAILROAD BONDAGE.
John T. Doyle was jubilant upon the receipt of the
great news yesterday afternoon. "This is a great day for
California," he. said. "It has been along fight against big
odds, but we have won. San Francisco should give itself
over to a holiday. We should have a big celebration. What
does it mean to California ? Well, it means emancipation. It
means freedom from slavery to the railroad ; it means a cut
in railroad rates that will be the biggest kind of an impetus
to production hi this State." ,
look ahead for a scale of freight rates that
will permit them to compete with favored
sections heretofore befriended by this
company."
Hugh Craig, president of the New Zeal
and Insurance Company, said: "I con
gratulate the people Â£>t California that
their children who will succeed
them have been relieved from the
influence of this incubus, which
has during the past twenty-seven years
tried to crush out our very existence by a
merciless system of exorbitant rates of
fare and freight to pay interest on an in
flatedHbonded indebtedness ana dividends
on watered stock which more than three
times equaled the actual cost of building
the road.
"President Cleveland will now have an
opportunity under the Thurman act of
giving effect to hia recommendation in his
message to the Fiftieth Congress, wherein
to him it seemed proper to recall the
grants and benefits derived from the Gen
eral Government by both the Union ami
Central Pacific companies for the purpose
of aiding; the construction of their roads.
He now can instruct the United States
Attorney-General to seek a remedy
against those who issued and transferred
Central Pacific bonds illegally. But will
be have the courage to give effect to his
own recommendations?"
Bert Schlesinger, Assistant United
States District Attorney, expressed the
followine opinion : "The Powers funding
bill lacked merit and was properly de
feated. Any measure insuring to the Gov
ernment the prompt payment of its claim
would be bailed with delight. The time
is not ripe for Government ownership."
Justice Van Reynegom expressed him
self as follows: "This proves that the
lobby had not sufficient power to defeat
the measure as against the will of the
people. It is a pleasant recognition of
the numerous claims of the people of this
State.
"We have been too often treated with
indifference in the. past, but now I am
glad to see that our political importance
i has been considered by the people of the
East. For by this vote it shows that the
t>eople at Washington are in touch witti
the people of California on a subject that
has interested them for the past twenty
years. I join in the rejoicing, not so much
because I am opposed to the corporation
as to know that California has been re
sDected by the American people assem
bled in Congress."
Ex- Judge Magee, one of the Bank Com
missioners of CaJifornin, said: "The
people in all parts of the State will be
pleased to know that the funding bill has
been defeated In Congress. It looks now
as though the Government would imme
diately proceed to foreclose the mortgage
on the Pacific railroads. Bat if sufficient
money cannot be raised by a sale to pay
the debt and the Government insists upon
getting full payment it may have to take
the roads. That would please the Popu
lists, but I do not believe it would resuit
in any special benefit to this City, to this
State or to the Nation."
ROBERT BKIGHT'S PROPERTY.
Hebbard Will Decide Who Is to Hold
Possession of 540.000.
In Judge Hebbard's department of the
Superior Court yesterday the interest
ing lawsuit of Robert Bright against
his sister, Mary Craig, for the return of
$40,000 worth of property was called for
argument. Attorneys Patton and Mc-
Knight represented Mr. Bright, while At
torney J. F. Castlehun spoke on bebali of
Mrs. Craig.
It was agreed that the most important
point iv tne controversy was in regard to
the legal right of Mr. Bright to demand
his property back after he had presented
it to her while he believed that he was
about to die.
Attorney Castlebun contended that the
property was not given to defendant, Mrs.
Craig, in expectancy of death on the part
of Mr. Bright. He showed by the testi
mony that after paying all the bequests
tiesired by Mr. Bright there woul.i have
been left over $2000 in cash. When askea
how he expected to dispose of the money
he said it was to be used for his comfort
in case of his partial recovery. At a sub
sequent time, when he was complaining
ot the non-return of his property, he said
to his sister, "If you should die before I
do I wouldn't have enough left to give
me a decent buriaL"
â¢ The language, Mr. Castlehun argued,
would not be used by a man who was in
fear of immediate death, but was the lan
guaae of a man who expected to outlive
bis* sister, who was not then sick and was
his junior in years.
According to Mr. Castlehun's theory the
intention of Mr. Bright was to put the
property in bis sister's possession in order
that proper provision might be made for
hiÂ« support, and to sustain tnis view he
said that Bright bad not demanded a re
turn of ail his property, but, according to
his own testimony, bad asked for only
$1000, remarking at the time that if she
should die a'i the money would bo tied up
in the Probate Court and there would be
nothing to provide for his immediate
wants.
As a farther reason for believing that
Bright intended that the transfer should
be final and complete, Mr. Castlehun said
that when a draft of a will, prepared by
his direction, was presented. Bright aÂ»ked
if there was no way in which the costs of
the Probate Court might be avoided, and
after f urt' er discussion he rejected the
proposed will ani decided to give the
property to his sister, wishing, as he said,
to administer on his own estate.
Jndge Hebbard remarked that in bis i
opinion tue point at issue was to show
whether the transfer of property was
made by Bright when he was actually in
fear of immediate death.
Mr. Patton rep ied to the remarks of
Mr. Castlehun. He analyzed the testi
mony and argued that counsel on the
other side was not justified in hi 3 conclu

Dr. George C. Pardee folly agrees with
the opinion regarding tbe committee of
twenty-one published ihis morning. He
declares it to be the mosi foolish kind of
talk to hint that the committee was ap
pointed as the result of boodle or corrup
tion.
The story published on Saturday even

the indignant language of Dr. Pardee.
published to-niebt, sliovr that there bas
been a very pronounced breach in the
element known in local politics as the
Ivon-Partisans. Dr. Pardee says:
I have never told any one that I would not
serve on the committee. What I have said is
that if there is any bug or jug in this matter
it is not too late for us to back out; but so far
there has been no sign of a bug in the com
mittee of twenty-one, at least. There have
been rumors going the rounds, of course, but
they can be easily traced to the old ring gang,
which is now crying because it has not a finger
In the p;e.
This talk runs to the song of "boodle," but
as yet there appears nothing to warrant such
statements. They say the City Central Com
mittee was "boodled." If so, for what? If
there whs any boodling done, was it not for
decency? There can bo nothing said ngainst
the committee of tweuty-o;ie. Its personn 1
is above reproach. Why, then, if a job wag
up. did the City Committee appoint such
good men â citizens with not a single string to
them, and who would not be a party to any
Jot)? If there has been boodling, I say it is ihe
Kind we want, for it is In the interests of de
cency and good politics when such representa
tive men are named to take charge of the cam-
paign.
The old gang clamored aloud for an ap
pointed convention jus' one week prior to the
action of the City Cen'.ral Committee, but now
that their suggestions nave been carried out
they are denouncing it roundly. And why?
Just because they have lost control of the
convention. They are the ones who shout
"boodle, ' while nil the time the gla^s bouses
they live in are punctured with many holes.
They say Tingee Is at the bottom of thecom-
"Fot many years I have served

Snow.
mittee with a proposition lor the cityjto buy
bis water works. But they purposely forges
that the matter would first have to be put to
the vote of the people before the city could
make such a deal if it wanted to. Tim talk it
:ooiish.
Even should it be found that thÂ»re is a bug
in the City Central Committee, would that have
any effect upon the integrity of the individ
ual members of the committee of twenty-one?
There certainly could be no connection.
There is no reason, in my mind, why we
fchould not go on just the same as b-fore, and,
while I am not prepared to say that we will
continue the course mapped out, still unes
1 something definite transpires to change tne
â  condition of affairs, there .s nothing to war-
rant the assertion that our committee will
not continue the trust reposed in it.
There is no iruth in the statements that we
cannot find citizens who are willing to be del
eea'.es. In the Seventh Ward the refusals to
*erve are fewer than anticipated, and while
soiae who have been suggested do not want to
act tnere are itili many oiher gocd represent
ative ci'izens who are ready.
Of course we will have to alk this matter
over before we determine just what to do. I
have not seen any of the committee for several
day*, and 1 want to hear toe opinion of others
before I take a definite stand. Still I must say
that even if the City Central Committee
should have been -boodled" 1 do not see
where it affects us. Certainly our committee is
not responsible for the sins nf others.
The members of the committee of twen
ty-one are greatly enraged at the insinua
tion that they have formed an alliance
with dishonor, and to-day they addressed
tbe iollowing leiter to Frank A. Leach,
editor of th Enquirer:
Fdit^r Enquirer': The description in the En
quirer ot the 9th inst. of the sad plight of the
committee of twenty-one Is a great surprise
to a large uumber of that committee. The
work of sel.'Ctitig 147 iutelliyent, honest, dis
interested and representa;:ve citizens of Oak
land to constitute a Republics municipal
convention wa^ not sougat by that committee;
butu has been assumed as the call of duty,
and the task is nearly completed. The dele
gates chosen, and whose minus will very soon
be announce i, will command the respect and
confidence of every voter in Oak. and. In the
selection of tnese men there has been no wire
pu ling no grinding of axes, no trading to se
cure personal favorites; but there has been a
.Ih'TOUKh canvass of each ward to riod tht best
men to represent the vaned interests of our
cii v
We do not know the genesis of this move
ment. Why should we care? A solemn duty
has b.-en put in our hands, trnd we are deter
mined to di-thar^e that duty honestly and
feariessiy. Of whom shall we De afraid?

January 11, 1897.
ThÂ° situation at present is reearded as
serious, and it looks as though efforts
were made to briny: about a return of the
times when "soiid nines" took their cues
from S.eve Gajre be.'ore they voted in the
Council. Frank Leach, by his action, has
broken away from the young reformers
headed by George G. Pardee, Assessor
Dalton, Frank K. Mott, R. W. Snow and
others, and they are wondering why he
has done so.
A few weeks asto, in the interests of
harmony, so it was declared, the Re
publican City Central Committee turned
the party organization over to the young
men, who are strong for the recovery of
the water front. The twenty-one men
who wee empowered to appoint a con
vention to nominate city officials arÂ« the
strongest men in the party, and although
he was net aware of tlie plan until it was
all done Mr. Leach was supposed to be
friend y to it, and for a month was cer
tainly not opposed to it.
That the Mayor and Council so nomi
nated would right gallantly lor the water
front could not be questioned and their
election seemed equally certain.
One of the most indignant of the com
mittee said to-day that there is something
needed far more convincing than Mr.
Leach's explanation published in the after
noon. He sa d: ,
It looks ps if Tom Carothers, Steve Gage,
George de Golia and their friends have cap
tured Frank Leach and his paper. The article
in Saturday's Enquirer was so false in its in
sinuations that it was intolerable, and could
only be explained iv one way. Leacn said
that the hand that was guiding the twenty
one vrds that of his arch-enemy, i'rank Moffitt.
Moffitt and Leacn have fousht for ten years
cn<l A the wtil-known Democrat were to leave
this section Leach would not know where to
lookwhen he wanted to make capital at another
man's expense. .Many of us have not seen
Moffiu for months. Others do not know him
by signt, and certainly it is absurd to hint
that he is running the Repub.ican party this
year. Moffitt's individuality is magnified
when it is understood that he is clo>ely con
nected with the new Dingee water company.
Of course we a.l know that the new Council
will have to fix the water rates for the com
ing year and it would be absu'd to suppose
trial the rival water companies do not take Â»n
interest ii: local politics. There is n general
belief that the faction that his broken away
fr im.l'ardee aid ills fellow-comniitteemen so
suddenly have found she.ter in the dual camp
maintained by those powerful corf oration*,
the Southern Pacific and tne Contra Costa
Water Company.
Leach would never have broken away from
Pfirdee without a purpose, and his sudden
switch toward ttic corporations which, uutil
Purdee appeared, controlled Oakland politics,
makes me think that s< me of those political
stories that came from Valiejo must have had
a foundation.
The feeling is very bitter, and the com
mittee wonders if the absurd story of their
being bought by MoHitt was not brought
forward to hide t c evidence of a worse
betrayal. It is recalled that Leach sup
ported Josiah Ames some years ago; that
he pers;stently fought the candiracv of As
sessor Dalton in the interests of R. Leckie;
that he opposed Supervisor Pelouze, who
supported Dalton, and ridiculed Jonri L.
Davies' ferry scheme, and that Oid Pard
Bassett accused him of betrayine his
plans to recover the water front to Edson
Adams. All these things have been re
vived, and it is also stated that Mr. Leach
and \V. H. Mills recently passed some
hours together.
As a result of all this bitterness there will
certainly tie two Republican tickets in the
field. The Pardee-Dalton followers will
present their usual determined front to
the incorporated nionopolie-, and the ele
ment known as "The machine' will also
put up candidates. The commitcee of
twenty-one meets Tuesday nijriit, and
they declare that they will be ready to
name their men.
Candidates in Evidence.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 11.â Candidates
are now bubbling up in all directions, and
there will be no lack of choice. Auditor
Snow is undecided whether to run to suc
ceed himself or to try for Mayor, and
Treasurer Giipin feels the fame way.
Most cf the Councilmen are anxious to
succeed themselves, and W. A. Dow is be
ing pushed to succeed City Attorney Per
cival. Engineer Wilson* will certainly
have to fitfht for his position. ,
Baron Bnrnteau is actively at work re
organizing the Owl Club in the Fourth
Ward. The club was a power four years
ago when the Baron was captain, and he
prophesies gr*at things for the future.
TO EEMOVE AN UYESORE.
Assemblyman Howttrd K. Wright Wanti
Oxford street Improved
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 11.â A bill is to
be presented by Assemblyman Howard E.
Wright in the Legislature now in session
which if carried will result in a material
improvement to the town, as well as to
the university reservation. Oxford street,
which skirts the western boundary of the
campus, has been for twenty -six years an
eyesore to the public ana a source of dis
comfiture to traveler*. This street stretches
something like an eighth of a mile along
the trounds, and is perhaps the most
traveled of any of the street in thn vicin
ity. It has never been graded or macad
amized, because of the lack of funds at the
disposal of the regents. .
It will cost about $4000 to put this
thoroughfare into proper: condition, and
in anticipation of .presenting; a j bill |to
cover the amount Assemblyman Wright
has had it surveyed with reference to the
proper grade, beside securing an estimate
as to the cost of putting it into condition.
'. Republican Ticket.
BERKELEY, Cal , Jan. ILâ Young
Men's Republican Club, which was or
ganized during the recent campaign, is
agitating for the nomination of a straight
Republican ticket in the coming local
election. Berkeley town /elections f have
hitherto been conducted without regard to
National political divisions, but if the
o.ub's views prevail the approaching cam
paign will be different. ' A committee, 4
consisting of Messrs. Parker," Kenney,
Ray, Carpenter and Lord, has been ap
pointed :"-: by the - club to investigate local
Republican sentiment with regard to the
matter.
Objects to Mythology.
BERKELEY, ; Cal., an. ILâ The ' Rev.
George E. Swan, rector of U Mark's
Church, objects to the teaching of heathen
mythology ;in =â  the "public [, schools. Mr.
Swan thinks that the -time devoted r to
study â  of â  Bulfinch's \ "Age of ', Fable" was
worse than wasted and should be devoted
to other things, "i wouid like the parents
of Berkeley to 5 read fhe book and see if it
is the >ort of work they want â  their chil
dren to study ; or read." said Mr. Swan.

908 Broadway, Jan. 11. s
Miss Bertha Hoeper, who attempted
suicide at midnight, is still at the Receiv
ing Hospital, with her chances of life and
death even. The circumstances that led
up to the tragic affair are amply tola in a
bundle of letters which she wrote about
an hour previous to attempting to take
her life.
"I am sorry that I did not do better,"
said the girl this morning, "because t
MISS BERTHA HOEPER, a Graduate of the San Francisco High
School, Who Shot Herself Because She Doubted Her Lover.
have no desire to live. About three weeks
ago I was told that Mr. Pretti bad decided
to transfer his affection for me to some
other pirl. I wrote to him and he assured
me that such a story was false. We agreed
to meet yesterdÃy, and his manner con
vinced me that i was one too many and I
decided to get out ot the way."
FranK Pretti, for love of whom Miss
Hoeper was willing to sacrifice her life,
manages a cigar-store on Washington
street. He was at the hospital several
hours to-day and expressed great consid
eration for the suffering girl, said he:
"I did not have any idea that Bertha
had any intention cf taking her life. She
ha-Â» always been a very cheerful girl, and
with the exception of a little misunder
standing a few weeks ago, we have never
had any serious differences."
One letter written by the girl about half
an hour before she shot herself tells the
whole story. It is as follows:
My Darling Frank: When you read this letter,
your Bertna wih probably be in the morgue.
I realize that I am not worthy of you and that
I can Dot possibly live without you, and I
prefer death to misery. I have been trying for
weeks to overcome this leeling thai nas taken
possession of me, but I dc it, and
sometimes I fear 'hat I shall lose my reason,
and I would rather be dead than a maniac. I
wish to thank you for all your kindness to me,
which I know I nave not deserved, and which
I shall never be able to repay, but perhaps
James will.
When we were in the restaurant, yesterday,
and I said that I should be a different girl to
morrow from wnat I am to-day, you did not
understand me. You will understand it now.
I want you to keep this letter sacred aud not
let anybody reaJ it, as I am no: anxious to let
the world know how much I love you. Frank.
I may be doing wronc, but I cannot lieip it.
There Is only one thing tor me to live for and
that is you, and wltliout my desire, I will go.
I remember well that the first little present
you ever made me was a pure white rose. From
that hour the white rose has been my favorite
flower, and now I have but one favor to nsk:
I wish that when I am buried you would just
place a pure whi c rose on my breast. I want
no more flowers and want no one to send any
but this one from you. My last words are,
'Frank, I love you." Your darling sweetheart,
Bertha.
Last night the girl called on Pretti, ana
seeing his gun on the table she waited till
he left thu room, and then fired, as she
thout-'hr, at her heart. The bullet passed
through her lung and was extracted from
her back tnis morning.
The girl's real name is Bertha Stitze.
Her mother married very young and was
deserted by her husband some time ago.
Mrs. Stitze married a second time, and
her daughter took her steplather's name
of Hoeoer. Bertha is a graduate of the
San Francisco High School.
WOBKIM PEOPLE DUPED.
Posed as a I-ireMiiore Capitalist, bat
leaded Hit Hotel Bill.
LIVERMORE, Cal.. Jan. ILâ There
have been many arrivals this week of men
from about the bay who expected employ
ment at the hands of Charles Miller.
Some said he was a rancher, some that be
conducted a big livery stable and yet
others that he conducted an undertaking
establishment. The influx of strangers
was only stopped when a telephone mes
sage was sent to the San Francisco em
ployment agencies to the effect that no
such man was to be found and not to send
any more people here.
Charles Miller came to this place
last week and put up at the Livermore
Hotel. Sunday night he requested Land
lord Wilkinson to call niru at 9 o'clock
Monday morning, but at that hour he
was not to be found, and has not been
seen. A warrant was sworn out ior his
arrest, charging him with jumping his
board bill.
G. E. Rines of San Francisco was the
first on duped, arriving Monday to take
charge of Miller's undertaking establish
ment!!. This same day a lady inquired
for Miller, but declined to give her name
or business. Tuesday a man, wife and
son were the first arrivals to take char c
of Miller's ranch. Later a couple of
hostlers came in to work in Miller's livery
s'abie. Others have come and gone with
tneir tale of woe.
It i& aaid that Miller represented him
?elf to the different employment offices in
San Francisco as a Livermore capitalist in
quest of help, and particularly watr.ed
sober, industrious people. He promised
steady employment at good waÂ«?es to such.
Some" say they paid him a consideration
for the proposed employment.

lar ietter from C. P. Smith, chairman of
the Mendocino County Supervisors, asking

Plenty of Faults, but No Kemedy.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 11.â W. D. P.
B.iss spoke upon Christian Socialism in
Liuderman's Opera-house this afternoon.
His auuience consisted principally of
ladies, and numbered about 300. This was
his last appearance upon the coast, he
having left immediately at the clo->e ot his
lecture for the East. Mr. Bliss, in forcible
language, pointed out numerous faults of
the" present system of competition, but
did not offer any remedy. Corporations
came in for a heavy denunciation, but the
speaker claimed that the people were to
blame even for their grasping propensities.
He favored woman's suffrage and muni
cipal ownership. Tne latter, he claimed,
would give more employment to tie
laboring class, but he failed to state in
what way.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 11. â Trustee
Theo. L ydecker wiJl siiip ten of his bom
ing pigeons upon the Ratiler, now being
fitted out at the Mission-street wharf,
upon the condition that Captain Fred Nel
son will not release any of them over 100
miles from the loft. In speaking of the
proposed trial. Mr. Leydecker said: "I
let Captain Nelson have the birds on the
condition that they be flown along the
io>st of California, 100 miles north or
south of Ran Francisco. If they were
liberated on the Japan coast I do not
think they would ever come home. In
the first place, they are not trained to
that and couldn't get their bearings, and,
secomly, they would have been cooped
up so long that they wouldn't i aye the
strength to fiv so far, even if thÂ«y had
their bearings/

BUCKWA MADE A
NEW TRUCK RECORD
With Sloan Up He Beat
the i to 4 Choice, Mt.
McGregor 11.
Tully Coulter's Filly California
Took tbe Stake Event
Very Easily.
Reopening Day at Oakland Track
Two First Choices Managed to
Square Through.
T. Sloan, jockey, and Ed Purser's bay
trelding Buckwa were quite the sensation
of the hour reopening day at Oakland
track. The precocious young sadiile
artist, whose various dazzling habiliments
require an experienced vaiet and an index
book of greater thickness than the City
directory to keep cases on, and which
would have caused E. Berry Wall in his
palmiest Jays to have turned a beastly
wretched sallow color, was real good yes
terday. He rode two winners, and even
if he was outhnished by Charley Thorpe
in the fifth race, it was no disgrace, for
Charley was high mogul of the bash
jockeys when Tod was making hot-air
balloon escapes. At any rate, as was men
tioned belore, the win of Buckwa was the
gossip of the track. The cause of it all
was the fourth race of the day, a mile dash
with three starters â Cabrillo, Mount Mc-
Gregor II and the aforesaid gelding.
Mount McGregor was a 1 to 4 chance, but
Tod ru-heci Buckwa away in the lead and
keepinir him there led the odds on favor
ite out by halt a length at the wire in the
remarkably jast time of 1:39%. His ex
cellent ride was enthusiastically applauded
by tbe crowd, many of which got abroad
at odds of 4 to 1. The time is a track
record.
Tbe sport throughout was very good
and the attendance was large. Tae track
was as hard as an asphaltum pavement
and fast time was the rule. Favorites
fared about as welt as they usually do
under tti* soothing influence of the balmy
air of Emeryville, scoring on but two
occasions.
The Berkeley high-weight handicap,
worth $700 to the winner, over six fur
longs, drew out a field of ten. Caspar, the
Burns & Waterhouse entry, with 116
pounds up, was a slight favorite at odds ol
11 to 5 over California. After a tiresome
delay at the post Caspar got away in front
and led to the stretch, where California
passed him, and galloped in an easy win
ner by three lengths in 1:14%. Scarf Pin
took the place in a hard urive irom Fer
rier, which latter horse ran a magnificent
race, carrying 140 pounds.
Drifting back in the betting from 6 to 5
to 9 to 5 Meadow Lark got away from the
post poorly, and then downed the poor
lot opposed to him in the opening six
furione scramble, finally beating the 150 to
1 shot Detective a length. Monitor was
third.
With but four going to the post for the
mile and a furlong race under selling con
ditions McLight and Lovdal both closed
at 8 to 5 after tbe Former had opened up a
6to 5 chance. Lovdal made the running
to the stretch, when Doggett shook Mc-
Light up and in a mild drive beat tbe
Burns & Waterhouse entry less than a
len?th in 1:54%. Peter II led Little Crip
ple out for tbe show.
By a pretty piece of riding Charley
Thorpe got Osric 11, second choice for the
seven-furlong spin lor three-year-oldÂ«,
home a nose in front of Gene Leigh's
Arrezzo, the 6 to 5 favorite.
The pair alternated in making the pace
throughout, but when it came co the final
pinch Thorpe attested his superiority by
Kiekinjt his mount over the tape a nose
to the good in 1:28J4'. Imp. Sain awoke
from a reverie and was third at more than
pleasing odds.
The concluding race of the day, a six
fnrlong sprint, was captured by Mont
gomery, which opened a Bto 5 favorite
and receded to threes. Quicksilver, as
usual, made his run out in iront and quit I

him something. Randall was then given
a foot-up on the brown horse's back, and
'there began the wildest ride ever taken
by man." Round ana round the track he
galloped with Randall shouting for a life
preserver, a . balloon <or ; a racetrack res
taurant doughnut, but all to no avail.
Finally, alter the Â£nglish-bred horse had
smashed all past four-mile records and
gone a half-mile further, :he stopped. If
that: exercise lad ever asks Mr. Randall
for another lesson, there is apt to be a
homogeneous s mixture of boy, horse, sad
dles, stirrups and Montana cuss-words, all
mixed up with the paddock fence and sur
rounding buildings,
The Detective which started in the first
race was : not the horse by that name
formerly, owned by Coleman & Jones, and
the. management of ; the track across the
bay should have -so notified the public.
The horse starting in yesterday's race
was down on the card as by Comet from
Viola, and was backed quite â¢ extensively
for the show. " â¢
Meadow Lark slipped his headstall,
finishing with: the bit in his mouth and
the balance of the paraphernalia down on
his neck. " .
Joe man backed McLight in a major
ity of the books.
The entry of Nelson bad been refused
by the track across the bay. but as yester
day's" race was a stake affair he was al
lowed to go to the past, although Starter
Ferguson , had been previously : ordered
not to unnecessarily delay the start on ac
count of the one-eyed horse.
'-. Buck* a and California were both suc
cessful at their first essay. Pete Gaffney
said that Purser letÃ tckwa run loose, but
it is just probable that Pete was "smoking
a bit," as several other big bettors had
their checks down on the gelding. Tully
Coulter thought California a good thing
and must have added considerably to his
bank roll.
The saddle on Fly slipped near the
three-furlong pole and Shaw was com
pelled to pull the sprinter up. [ '

FREE POLO GAMES
IN THE CITY PARK
The Burlingame Club to
Secure a Public Field
Here.
Commissioners Favor the Idea
and Exciting Matches Will
Result
Teams May Come From the East and
Northâ Burlingame Teams
Going South.
San Francisco is to have a public polo
grounds in Golden Gate Park.
The iiarlingame club, through the ef
forts of its president, Mr. Grant, has re
ceived from the Park Commissioners the
promise of the necessary plat of ground
to be converted into a polo rield. The
Park Commissioners are agreeable to the
project.
The idea is to have the field ready for
use in April upon the occasion of the
Golden Gate Carnival. Efforts are to bo
made to have some prominent Eastern
polo team come out here at that time to
play the Burlingame club. Foxhall
Keene, son of Jim Keene, the formerly
well-known California pioneer, is asso
ciated with one of the big Eastern teams.
He especially will be asked to visit this
coast with his fellow-players. The trip is
an expensive one, for the special car for
the ponies alone would cost $1000.
"The Park Commissioners have signifled
their intention to put a stretch of ground
in condition," said Joe Tobin of the Bur
lineame Club yesterday. "A polo field re
quires an area of ground about 100 yards
wide by about 2UO yards long.
â¢'The proposed polo field would be nÂ«ar
the Olympic grounds and just within the
park. There is a good stretch of ground
there that is not being used for anything.
All that would have to be done to make it
a polo field would be to put a little earth
on it in some places and then turn the
water on it occasionally so that it would
look green. The polo rield at Burlingame
requires practically no attention.
The Barlingame polo team, composed
of Walter Hobart, Lawrence McCieary,
Richard Tobin and Charles Baldwin, is
going down to Los Angeles to play at
least two games on Washington's birth
day of that week that are to be given over
to some sort of fiesta at Los Angele*. One
came will be with the polo team of the
: Riverside Club that ranked first on the
i coast until defeated by Burlingarae last
\ year. The other will be with the Santa
Monica polo team. The Burlingarue team
will take fifteen ponies along for the
games. A special horsecar will be cnar
! tered for the trip.
A. story had gained circulation to the ef
fect that polo ponies were being killed
and salted down at Barlingame as choice
food for the recently imported fox
hounds, as a sort of esthetic diet, calcu
lated to put fresh life and spirit into the
dogs of the chase. But Joe Tobin yester
day indignantly denied that there bad
been the least foundation for this canard,
on the fads of swelldom. He explained
that the foxhounds are fed only upon pre
pared biscuits, manufactured especially
lor the purpose, and dealt out by the im
ported English kennel master who lias
charge of the dogs. These dogs do not
get our meat at all.
He also declared that there are more
polo ponies at Bnrlingaroe now than ever
before. There are fuliy seventy-five. Mr.
McCreary, brother of the present Bur
lingame polo-player, did when last here
buy op about ten of the California ponies
and take them to England with him, but
none others have been disposed of. And
Mr. McCreary has been very successful
with those little horses of the California
mustang stock. Here a sood polo pony
can be bought for about $40. An excep
tionally good one may bring $75. Joe
Tobin paid that amount for his beat pony.
In England, according to Mr. Tobin, a
polo pony is worth irom $200 to $500, and
some of the best ones with great reputa
tions, because of their ri er*, have
brought as much as $2500 and $:;000 apiece,
in the East a good po.o pony cannot be
had under about $250. Those thai. Walter
Hobart bought in tue East and exhibited
in the recent horse show, cost something
like $750 each. They were the best to be
ha.i.
But the polo men themselves assert that
the little California horse is on a par with
anything anywhere as a polo pr>ny. If he
be quick to Â«tart and quick to turn and
not over 14 bard 3 2 in hea in height, La
has the essential qualifications for a good
p>lo pony, but must have a little speed
also.

My Dear Sir :
- I have had, and have now in progress,
one of the most phenomenal sales in the history of my long
business career in San Francisco.
The bargains offered I honestly believe have never been
duplicated in this city, but this fact alone could not account
for the great rush of buyers to my ; store. â¢ I attribute the
unusual crowding for entrance to my establishment in a great
measure due to advertising which has appeared in The Call s
columns , and in view of this fact, I extend to you my hearty
congratulations, in having made your : paper so evidently valua-
ble to the advertiser, and assure you of the continuance of my
patronage during the sale.
: Yours very truly,

the Supreme Court
Yesterday.
Ex-Justice Works Verbally. At
tacked for Language in
a Brief.
Allegation That Judge Torrance Was
Disqualified to Sit in a Case
Makss Trouble.
Three attorneys from San Diego took
part in an unusual scene before the Su
preme Court, in bant, yesterday after
noon. They were ex- Justice of the Supreme
Court John 1). Worts, City Attorney H.
E. Doolittle of the city of San Diego ana
Jurtge Gibson of the law firm of
Gibson & Titus. Two of the attorneys,
namely Messrs. Gibson and Doolittle, used j
harsh language concerning ex- Justice
Works, and asked that an appeal which
he had taken should be denied, and also j
that the brief which had been filed by him
should be stricken from the file.
The suit which was in question is that â 
of the San Diego Water Company against j
the city of San Diego and others. This
action was brought against the city of
Kan Diego ana certain of its officers and
the Southern California Mountain Water
Company to declare void and set aside ft
contract for the purchase of a water-right i
to 1000 inches of water and the construc
tion of a distributing system for the cit} r ,
and to enjoin the issuance of bonds by
San Diego in the sum of $1,500,000 to pay
for the same. The case came before the i
Supreme Court on an appeal denying the |
motion of counsel for the San Diego Water i
Company for a change of venue. The mo- j
tion was denied by Judge Torrance. and
the hot words used yeslerday grew out of
the wording of the brief fiied by ex-Jus
tice Works before the Supreme Court.
Some of the passages in the appellant's j
brief were read and dwelt upon, these re
ferring to Judge Torrance. Somo of the j
passages were as follows:
The cause of this action is twofold: (1) To
set aside as. illegal and void a contract be
tween the city and the Southern California !
Mountain Company, involving an expendi- j
ture of $1,500,000 by the city. (2) To enjoin
the issuance of the bonds of the city in said j
sum to carry out the contract. In both of â 
these questions the Judge of the court below i
was directly and pecuniarily involved.
That Uie conditions were buch that a Judge,
in justice to hiwsel f and the parties interested,
but particularly in justice to himself, vouiu
have been justified in declining to sit as
Judge, no right-minded Jtidge or lawyer will
deny, lie has not s-een tit to exercise this
right, but has ariven us to the unpleasant
task oi asserting and attempting to maintain
that he was legally disqualified to try the case.
We say unpleasant task, because it is never
pleasant for a lawyer to take the position that
a Judge has violated the doctrine, so jealously
guarded by law, that no man snail sit as a
Judge in his own case. It ii usually taken by
the judge as a pe^onal reflection upon him,
and it is such a reflection, and one of the most
serious character, where the Judge has know
ingly and willfully asserted his right to sit in
the case. But while the duty of an attorney
under such circumstances is not a pleasant
one, it is none the less a duty that he has no
right to shirk or neglect.
There were two portions of ex-Justice ;
Works' briei which particularly, in con
nection with the foregoing, called out em- !
piiatic words irom tbe otlier attorney. 'â¢
The following is one:
If the Judge has acted in good faith, and
simply erred as to the law which govern his J
action, it is only an error, and casts no retire- !
tion upon his integrity as a Judge. If he has;
willfully persisted in trying a case where he ia |
disqualified, no condemnation can be too i
severe.
The concluding paragraph of the brief
of the ex-Justice also caused the opposing
lawyer to censure. This was as follows: j
There are many circumstances connected j
with the case but not appearing in the record j
i hut would show, perhaps, as clearly as any :
case ever submitted to the courts for deter
mination, the strict wisdom of the rule laid
down in the decided case against any action
being taken in a cause by a Judge who can j
be reasonably suspected of being influenced j
by self-interest and the gross impropriety of a |
Judge knowingly taking such action where
suspicion exists. â¢
Before tht opposing counsel spoke ex-
Justice Works read an explanation of his
brief. He denied that in his brief he had
impugned the motives of Judge Torrance,
and claimed that he was simply pointing
out tnat it was improper for a Judge to
git in a case in which he was concerned,
and said that Judge Torranca was con
cerned in the litigation in question by
being an owner of taxable property in
Sun Diego to the amount of $20,000, also
as a taxpayer and a water-rate payer.

**Jsjic.-ik more in sorrow than in aneer,"
began Judge Gibson. "If Judge Works,
who lias been on the bench of this court,
were an amateur in the profession, I
would be inclined to overlook Euch a mat
ter. But when a man of the standing of
Judge Works attempts this I think some
action should be taken." Then Judge
Gibson vent on to declare the statements
in the brief scandalous.
Ex-Justice Works listened while Judge
Gibson went on and the Supreme Conrt
Justices looked a little surprised. "He
has reiterated his assertions in a scan
dalous letter that he has read. He insin
uates in his brief that Judge Torrance did
not act in good faith. His language
shows the animus of the attorney. His
language is scandalous, impertinent, un
just and unfair. An example should be
made.
"He has reiterated In his brief in the
case of \Vorks and Works his unjust and
scandalous reruarKs and thus showed that
this was not mere inadvertence."
Chief Justice Beatty asked ex-Justice
Works if he refused to withdraw his re
marks and the ex-Justice said "yes, sir."
Judge Gibson then continued and
alleged that ex-Justice Works had got
into the habit of making such statements
in briefs. '-In a suit in the United States
Circuit Court the same scurrilous matter
has been incorporated in a brief by him.
This is not his first offense, and unless
something is done there will be no safety
for any one on the other side of the case.
We ask for mild punishment. We do not
ask for his disbarment at this time."
City Attorney Doolittle objected to
having tiled the statement read by the ex-
Justice, saying that it contained the same
matter contained in the brief. Then ex-
Justice Worss spoke:
"It has been said," he began, "that I
have declined to strike out parts of my
brief and that I adhere to what I have
said. What are the facts and circum
stances? The very question at issue in
this appeal is whether the Judge has sat
in a case when he ought not, whether be
has tried a case in which he was inter
ested. It is not implied thai Judge Tor
rance sat corruptly. But if the attorney
is seeking for language in reference to
a Judge sitting wrongly he can find it in
the decisions of this court.
"An honest, independent bar is as
necessary to the administration of justice
as an honest bench. It an attorney cannot
call to the attention of this court that a
Judge has sat below where he was dis
qualified, then we are living under a des
potism. Here was a Judge sitting who
was a taxpayer and a water-rate payer,
and who, as such, was liable to pay bis
share on the $1,500,000 for which the city
was to obligate itself. They say that I
have unjustly made charges against Judge
Torrance. 1 said the same things in his
court. No assertion is mad,e that Judge
Torrance sat willfully. We do not impute
any improper motives to him."
City Attorney Doolittle made some re
mnrks, in which ha held that ex-Justice
Works had impugned the motives of
Judge Torrance.
Tne motion to dismiss the appeal and to
strike ex-Ju-stice Works' brief from the
hie was taksn under advisement. The
statement read by the ex-Justice was not
admitted to tile.
LIFE NOT WORTH LIVING
Henry Miller, a Despondent German,
Shot a Bullet Into His
Creast.
Henry Miller, a German, aged probably
45 years, attempted suicide yesterday
shortly after noon in a gun store on
Kearny street, near Sacramento. It is
quite likely that the man will soon die.
Milier asked the clerk in the store to
show him a revolver displayed in the
show window. He then charged the
weapon with a cartridge from the box ac
companying it. Suddenly there was a
report and Miller sank to the floor shot
through the left breast.
Miller's injury was examined at the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Bunnell
declared it to be fatal.
The sufferer, who was in great pain,
stated he had arrived in this City some
few weeks ago. Formerly he lived in
Chicago, where he worked as a Dutcher in
various hotels. He claimed to have iost
some money in the wheat market prior to
his departure for this City.
It was learned that Miller was destitute
and in debt. He brooded over the death
of his wife in 1894 and thought life was
not worth living.
THEIE EEBATES EEADY.
Taxpayers Are Backward in Coming
Forward for Their .'Money.
The Treasurer is anxiously awaiting for
about 8000 taxpayeis to call and get the
â  rebates due them on taxes paid during tbe
j early part of the year. The amount to
their credit lying idle in the City treasury
is about $30,000, and the larger portion of
this is due those who are not on tbe de
linquent tax list. The number of appli
cants for rebates has grown very small
i during tne past few days, and there is lit
tle for tne clerks to do.

MRS. MORTON'S PLEA.
She Asks the Supervisors to Allow Her
to Remain in Her Home a
Few More I>.iyÂ».
Mrs. Ellen Morton, the soldier's widow
whom the Supervisors have ordered to
vacate her home on Fremont, between
Bryant and Harrison streets, because it
obstructs the highway, has petitioned the
board to allow her further time to find a
home. She represents that it would be a
trreat hardship to ask her to move within
ten days and requests that the Superin
tendent of Streets be instructed not to
move in the matter for a little while.
UNDER CIVIL SERVICE.
Attaches in the Marshal's Office Secure
in Their Position*.
There was great rejoicing in the United
States Marshal's office yesterday. Chief
Deputy A. L. Farish recently sent an
inquiry to the United States Civil Service
Commission at Washington as to the posi
tions of the- attaches in the Marshal's
office. Yesterday a letter was received
from Secretary John T. Doyle stating that
the clerical assistants and office deputies
are in the classified service, and, therefore,
under civil service. This does not apply
to field deputies of the United States Mar
shal who are dependent upon fees for their
remuneration.
The older deputies in the office are A.
L. Farisli, who has served the several Mar
shals for the past ten years, and 8. P.
Monckton, woo has been in the office seven
years. The others t.iere now came in
under Marshal Barry Baldwin, but they
will all be able to stay when he has gone.
As it stands now, the office deputies and
clerks are equally divided in their politics.
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGED.

lin offered to collect ilie amount and
charge her 10 per cent commission. Frank
lin wrote to her friend and the girl alleges
he received a check for the money, which

MRS. WELCH HAS
RETURNED IN TEARS
Is Not Married to Jimmy
Treadwell and Doesn't
Exp?ct to Be.
Thinks a Gcod Deal of Ivan and
Would Not Give Him the
Go-By.
Ivan Called Frequently Whi c Sh'
Was Away, but Has Not Been to
S;e H.r Since Her Return.
Pretty Mrs. J. J. Welch returned to her
mother'o home at 502}4 Larkin street,
yesterday afternoon, and spent the hours
weeping because of the notoriety which
.tier absence from the City had pained for
her. She denied having been married to
Jimmy Treadwell or having any notion of
being married to him or having been in
his company while away.
"Why, I have only met him half a dozen
times; ho has never called upon me," she
said. 'I met him incidentally when on a
visit to San Jose. It's abs"urd, the idea of
mixing my name up with that of poor,
innocent Jimmy. I think a great deal of
Ivan Treadwell, his brother, ana he
thinks a creat deal of me. I would
not for a moment give him the so-by for
Jimmy. But I have had no notion of
marrying either of them. It is true that
Ivan has called upon me frequently for
some time past â indeed we have gone
tandem-riding almost every day. We
were out Monday last and he took me to
dinner. 1 had an engagement to co
riding with him on Tuesday evening. 1
met Jimmy on the street. Idid not know
he was in town. I asked him when he in
tended to return to San Jose and he said
'In the morning.'
"On Wednesday I went to Oakland to
visit some friends, but before leaving the
house I sent a note to Ivan addressed in
care of Vanderslice & Co., and expected
it to reach him before he left there with
the ( andcm."
Here Mrs. Welsh's mother took up the
story. "At 2 o'clock Ivan came here,
riding up on the tandem. He just looked
too sweet, tooâ his face all lit up with
smiles. But it changed when he asked for
my daughter and I tohi him that she was
gone. 'Somewhere?' he asked. 1 told
him I didn't know. 'Well,' he said, 'I'll
wait an hour.' And he did. Ke sat here
talking to me for an hour. Then he went
away with the tandem. About an hour
later he came back on a single to inquire
if sho bail returned. He has been here
several times since. He was here last
evening to see if she had got back â " '
"Oh, well, mother, this is my state
ment." broke in the young woman. "It
doesn't matter where he went or how
many times he was riere. I don't think
be has acted nicely about this matter. He
could have saved all this notoriety, for he
lnust have got my note and so knew
where I was.
"Where was 1? Well, I went to Oak
land, as I say, Wednesday afternoon and,
let me see, did 1 come back the same night
or the next day? Oh, it was the next day
at noon. 1 camÂ© over on a little nusinesf,
and then went with some friends to San
Rafael, where I remained until to-day. I
would have been there yet but that I hap
pened to pick up The Call and was con
fronted with my own picture."
"She came hurrying home after that,"
interrupted her mother. "All this would
have been prevented if she had told me
where she was going. 1 '
"But I often go away for days without
telling you where I am going," said the
daughter. "I had no idea they would
say I ran away with Jimmy Treadwell
just because I spoke to him the night
before."
BY BULLET AND THE BAY.
Novel Method of Caspar Burri, a Swiss,
to End His L'fe.
Caspar Uurri, a native of Switzerland,
committed auicide early yesterday morn
ing and his body is now in the Morgue.
Burri was determined that there would be
no mistake about the ending of his exist
ence. His method of getting away from
the material world had in it the element
of originality.
Burri went to the end of the fishermen's
wharf on Union street ana placed two
stones on the stringer, so that he could
mount to the top of a cluster of piles. A
fisherman named B. Gillio, mending his
nets, watched the proceeding curiously,
and his interest was aroused even to teni
porarj excitement when he saw the man
take a pistol from his pocket and place
the muzzle to his forehead.
There was a muffled report and then the
body plunged forward off the piles into
the bay. G llio called for assistance, pnd
jamping into his boat, which was near by,
rowed to the place. Burri's booy had dis
appeared, and after tome effort Gillio re
covered the body of the dead man.
The remains were removed to the
Morgue, where the Coroner learned from
tne passport and other papers belonging
to the deceased his name, nativity, a*e,
etc. Burri was 60 years of nge and a miner
by occupation. H;s Dasf<port was dated
1865 and resigned in 1869. It is believed
that Burri's home was in the canton of
Luzerne. Deceased had no money in bis
pockets.
S. J. Ruddell Wei: Again.
Samuel J. Ruddell, the Deputy Surveyor of
the Port, has returned to his desk In the
Custom House after an absence of three weeks
caused by sickness. Mr. Kuridell had not been
well for several months and a sudden attack
of vertigo compelled him to take to his bed,
where he remained many days. Mr. Enddell
lost thirty-five pounds in weight during his
illness.
CIVIL SERVICE PROJECT.
Merchants' Association to Hold a
Fublic Meeting Advocating State
Reforms.
There will be an open discussion upon
the subject of a State civil service law at
the quarterly meeting of the Merchants'
Association next Thursday evening, Janu
ary 14, at the Academy of Sciences Hall.
The association has received from Hon.
James A. Waymire. member of the As
sembly, copies of two bills that he intends
to introduce in tde present Legislature
upon the subject of civil service. One bill
applies to the cities of the State and the
other to the counties of the State. The
association has also received from N. P.
Conrey. a prominent advocate of civil ser
vice in Los Angeles, a copy of a bill care
fully prepared by him and based upon
the' New York and Illinois statutes relat
ing te civil service in cities. He has made
this bill also apply <o counties of the State
and it will be introduced in the Legisla
ture by Assemblyman John Cross of Los
Angeles.
It is expected that the result of this dis
cussion of the bills at the quarterly meet
ing next Thursday evening will be a reso
lution addressed to the Legislature of the
State favoring the establishment of civil
service throughout the cities and counties
of California. The public is cordially in
vited to attend the meeting and take part
in the discussion.
IN FINANCIAL STRAITS.
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Education Is laboring Under
Heavy Difficulties.
The Board of Education is preparing to
exercise the utmost economy during the
next few months, in order to tide over
financial difficulties that threaten through
overdrafts on its funds and because of a
decreased apportionment of State school
moneys.
Official word came from Sacramento
yesterday that the apportionment for the
first six months of the year would be
$413,694 72, or about $17,000 less than was
received at this time last year.
If the second apportionment, which
comes in July, is proportionally less the
department will be in desperate straits for
funds before the end of the year and the
teachers will not only not receive the half
month's salary that was held last year,
but are quite likely to be short a like sum
daring the coming twelve months.
Even should the apportionment reach
$630,000. the amount calculated by the
Auditor, there will be a deficit, ana only
the strictest economy in the purchase of
supplies and tne work on buildings will
keep the board from cutting the teachers
off.
It is not expected that the second ap
portionment will co much over $220,000,
and the Finance Committee of the board
is straining every nerve to meet the situa
iou.

HAYES VALLEY
IS NOT BEHIND
An Improvement Club Or
ganized There Last
Night.
Spirited Offer Made bj G. L
Bresse to Assist the Store
keepers.
Plans to H.ve a Circle of Lights
on Po.k, Ltrkin and Hayes
Streets.
The illumination of Hayes street from
Franklin to Laguna is only the com
mencement of wnat will follow to bring
this section into prominence aa a com
mercial center.
â¢ At a meeting of the storekeepers, prop
erty-owners and residents of this street
last night at Mowry's Hall, a Hayes Val
ley improvement club was organized, with
Charles Alpers president and Frank fall
secre ary.
This organization is only temporary,
however, as a committee of three on per
manent organization and order of busi
ness was appointed. The committeemen
are: Frank Fall, J. H. Scott and P. J.
Gompertz. This committee will report
at the next meeting on Monday night, at
which lime a prominent club organization
will be formed.
At the meeting last night a committee
G. L. Bressc, One of the Public-
Spirited Property - Owners on
Larkin Street Who Has Con
tributed Liberally to the Light
ing Fund for That Street.
of eight was appointed, two to each block
thus far illuminated by arc lights: On the
300 block, Ed Christian and M. Beslar; on
the 400 block, Julius Seyden and Sol
Friedmann; on the 500 blocK, M. Gom-
Deriz and M. Scott; and on Laguna street,
on the block from Hayes to Grove, Charles
Alpers and P. Sveniinich.
These sub-committees will canvass their
respective blocks for further subscrip
tions with which to place additional
lamps on the blocks already lighted and
with the view of extending the light from
Franklin street to Larkin.
The same dark condition that is to be
found on the eastern end of Hayes street j
exists on the lower end of Larkin, as the
iuhts on this street have not been ex
tended farther than Golden Gate avenue,
but this drawback is about to be remedied
by the action of the Larkin-street Im
provement Club, which body has among
its members some very spirited property
owners, notably G. L. Bresse, a large real
estate owner on the line of this thorough
fare, who nas made an offer to guarantee
the expense of lighting one block out of
his own pocket provided the other prop
erty-owners would combine and do like
wise. Air. Bresse, when seen at his office
at 4L2 Pine street yesterday, said :
"I consider it the duty of property
owners not only to assist the storekeepers
to improve the appearance of their streets,
but it should also be the duty of every
man who owns a lot to subscribe for the
light. What value should my holding be
to me if I could not be able to rent the
houses erected thereon.
"i hiii j msmber of the Larkin-street
Improvement Club, and I have contrib
uted more than my pro rata of the ex
pense to beautify that street, and I will
do my share to have the lights continue
to Market street, thus making one con
tionous circuit from Polk along Sutter to
Larkin. and to where Larkin forks off into
Hayes and Ninth streets.
"This is what we want and what we
must nave or else we will have to brand
the other property-owners as being remiss
in their own interests."
Charles Alpers, at last night's meet ing,
subscribed $5 to the celebration to be had
on Hayes street in the near future, and he
offered the use of Howry's Hall free for
the use of the club.
Previous to the adjournment JP. J. Gom
perfz offered the following resolution:
Resolved, That the thanks of the Hayes Val
ley Improvement Club be tendered to our
Representatives in Congress for the able fight
made to deieat the funding bill; and be it
further
Resolved, That this club also extends Its
thanks to the San Francisco daily press and
particularly to The Call, for its 'dig
nified stand on behalf of the people of Cali
fornia aisainst the passage of the aforesaid
iundiiig bill.
This resolution went through with a
whoop and a yell of joy irom the large
gathering present.
It is said that women are not permitted
to be rhotoirrrtphed in China.
