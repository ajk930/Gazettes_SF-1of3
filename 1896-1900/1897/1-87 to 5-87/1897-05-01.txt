MAY ATTEMPT
TO YET GAIN
THE VICTORY
Greece 1 s New Ministry Ready
to Take Desperate
Chances.
ONE MORE GREAT BATTLE MUST
NOW BE FOUGHT.
Belief in Diplomatic Circles That Efforts
Will Be Made to Induce the Powers to
Intervene Without Greece's
Solicitation.
Copyright 1897 by the >"etr York Sun
LONDON, ENG., April 30. â It is rashly assumed in many parts of
Europe that the war is virtually finished. It is altogether premature to
indulge in such hopes until the result of the political crisis in Athens is
fully assured. The new Ministry cannot openly advocate a policy of
surrender, even if it believes the struggle against the Turkish army is
hopeless. The opposition has been from the first more warlike in
spirit than that displayed by the Ministers.
The latest dispatches from Athens indicate that Prime Minister
Ralli and his followers will continue to accuse the Greek commanders
of cowardice and stupidity, and to affirm that the Greek troops will be
able to retrieve the country's fortunes if properly led. The only thing
that can be expected therefore is a further attempt to snatch victory
from defeat. It is a desperate chance. Even those who are most
friendly to the Greeks do not expect them to succeed.
In view of this situation there is a belief in certain diplomatic
circles that strong efforts will be made to induce the powers to interfere
withcut the open solicitation of Greece, but under a secret understand-
;ng with the Greek Government that aIJ reasonable con' J ition c , such as
the withdrawal of the Greek troops from Crete, will be complied with.
To-day's advance of the Turkish forces seems to make at least one
more severe engagement inevitable. Telegrams from Athens to-day
show that the new Prime Minister is the idol of the populace for the
moment. It is possible that a Greek defeat at Pharsala and the conse-
quent peril of the capital would enable the Ministry to gain the coun
try's consent to submission to the powers.
Meantime it is fondly believed in most European capitals that the
agreement of the Czar and the Austrian Emperor made at St. Peters
burg is a practical guarantee of the peace of Europe against all dangers.
This agreement is interpreted in Vienna as the beginning of the end of
the triple alliance and significant of a new grouping of the powers. It
is plainly intimated that no obstacle remains to Russian occupation of
Constantinople when the Czar chooses. It is assumed that British
opposition will be futile, considering the strength of the combination
against Salisbury. It should be borne in mind, however, that the
position of France and Italy is by no means assured on the side of the
three Emperors. The friends of Salisbury, who welcomed him on his
return from the Riviera, are disturbed by the fact that his health did not
improve during his stay abroad.

TRIKKALA, Thessaly. April 30.â The
Turkish army under Edheni Pasha con
, gists of two divisions, one of which has ad
/ vanced upon Volo and the other to the
4 pain of Pharsala, where a great battle is
\ imminent.
CON STANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 30.â
It is announced officially that the Turkish
troops have occupied Trikkala without
firing a shot, and have expelled the Greeks
from Pentepigadia in Epirus. Turkish
cavalry have occupied Volo.
LONDON, Eng., April 30. âThe Morning
Post's Larissa correspondent Fays the
Turks entered Volo Wednesday without
organized resistance.
A Larissa dispatch to the Times says
Volo surrendered April 26. All the war
maieri..l was captured. Cavalry was poited
in thÃ environs awaiting the infan;ry
before making an effective occupation.
In an interview with tne corresDontlent
of the Standard the new Minister ot
Foreign Affairs says he is examinin â¢ the
situation with th- utmost care. If con
vinced the struggle could be continued
with a reasonable prospect of retrieving
national honor the Government would
prosecute the war with unabated energy.
Oilierwise the Government would cer
tainly refuse to bnn^ fresh disasters upon
the country by persisting in a foolhardy
war. He assured the correspondent that
no communication had been received from
the powers relative to the abandonment
of Crete on condition tnat autonomy for
the island wou;d De cuarauteed and the
frontier oi Greece reciilied.
BALONICA, TUBUT, April 20.â Osman

ATHENS, Gkeece, April 30.â The city
is crowded with reservists summoned foi
active service. Their enrollment and

very demonstrative and for a time it
looked as though serious disorders might

Evidence was given to-day of the feel

services in one of the churches the usual
prayer for the royal family was offered.
This excited the congregation, who ex

IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.
England Controls Those Waters by
the Most Powerful Aggrega

NEW YORK, N. V., April 30.â The
Journal's copyrighted London special
siys: England at this moment, is su
preme in the Mcd terranean. No less
than thirty-four of her battle-ships and
cruisers are in those waters ready for ac
tion. One quarter of these are the heav
iest warships afloat.
The nominal naval force England main
tainc in that sea is from ten to lourteen
vessels. That number has been supposed
tv equal any eruergencv. What the real
object of the enormous British concentra
tion is remains to be seen. Great Britain
is now in a nosition to practically dictate
in the Mediterranean. There is no force
there, even including the combined forces
of the powers, able to wiinstand the over
whelming British ageregation.

HURRYING RE-ENFORCEMENTS TO THE FRONT.
The picture represents General Smolenski's troops taking the train at Pbarsala station to re-en f orce the Greeks in battle with the Turks at Tepe-Pilav Pass, near
VeJestino. The point of view is from the hills to the right ol Pharsala. In the left foreground ars the troops of General Sniolenski's division, hurrying to take the
trains for Velestino. Just beyond the railroad is the Enipeus or Tchianarli River, flowing to the we.-t, and in the distance are the Cynoc9phalie or "Dog's Head" hills.
The station lies two miles to the northeast of the town of Pharsala, near the site of the famous battle betweeu CÂ»sar and Pouipey.
With their center at Pharsala and in possession of the railroad running from east to west, just north of the town, connecting Volo on the extreme right with
Kaiditza and TrikKala on the left, the Greeks have an advantatre over the Turks which somewhat offsets the disparity of numbers in favor of the latter. Within a
couple of hours troops can be thrown in either direction from the center to strengthen any point attacked, while th- Turks must depend on the country roads.
STILL EVADING
THE PENALTIES
Southern Pacific F ; iles
a Demurrer to Ken
tucky's Claim.
The Road Takes Advantage of
Every Technicality of
the Law.
Should It Win a Bill Will Be Intro
duced for the Repeal of
Its Charter.
FRANKFORT, Ky., April 30.â Judge
Alex Humphrey, attorney for the South
ern Pacific Railroad, to-day filed the fol
lowing demurrer to the petition of At
tcrnev-General Taylor against the road
for $136,000, penalties and fines for failure
to report, before Judge P. N. Major, sit
ting as special Judge in place of James E.
Cantrill, who was too ill to hold court.
There are four demurrers, identical in
verbiage, each demurring to the four peti
tions for the four years the road has so
failed to report:
Franklin Circuit Court, Commonwealth, of
Kentucky, plaintiff, vs. Southern Pacific Com
pany, de endant. Demurrerâ The defendant,
the Southern I'aiMfio Company, demurs to the
petition herein ; 1. Because the same fails 10
state a cause of action against it. !i. Because
in no event can the piain tiff recover a penalty
for more than a reasonable time, to wit, six
days. Wherefore defendant prays that the pe
tition be hence dismissed with its costs.
Humphrey A Davis, for defendants.
Judge Major did not pass on the demur
rer, but ordered the clerk to send the case
to Judge Cantrill at Georgetown. He said
it was proper that Judge Can trill should
consider the case.
Judge Humphrey made a statement
that bis demurrer was on the petition, and
requested the court to sustain his demur
rer.
This is a preliminary step in the case,
and should Cantrill sustain the demurrers
General Taylor will move for an amend
ment to his petition. General Taylor said
he had no doubt about his petition being
properly drawn; that the court would
overrule the demurrer, and the case would
the.i come up on its merits; that the road
had taken advantage of every technicality
of the law, and had forced the State to
bring the suit, and that it would receive
no quarter; that they had by their actions
admitted the facts, and would be forced to
answer, and that he had no doubt about
the final outcome of the litigation. The
papers were sent to Judge Can trill this
evening.
An agreed judgment was to-day entered
against the Louisville Water Company for
$1200 on a similar suit, and this is re
garded as first blood against the list of
companies that have been resisting com
pliance with the corporation law.
It is Known that a bill to repeal the
charter of the road will be introduced in
the Legislature in the event that the road
in successful in its suit.
LEAHY IS NOW COLOR-BLIND.
The Brave Little Commander Who Threat
ened to Blow the Gormans Out of
Water at Scmoa W.ll Retire.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30.âCom
mander Leary, who sailed under the guns
of the German snip at Samoa and threat
#ned to blow her out of water if she
landed men, has been found color-blind
and will probably be retired. Leary is
tho second man. ia his grade, lie will
have a captain's vacancy waltinK for him
in June if he can pass the examination.
lie is one of the pluckiest little fellows in
the service and is considered an officer of
excellent judgment. During the Samoan
troubles just preceding the great Apia
wreck Leary sailed into the harbor, find
ing a big German cuiser ready to take
possession of the town. The little captain
was on an o.d Â«ro, ier v-. S el. but in
stantiy he cleared ci tcs for aotion, v got
between the German ciaiser and shoro,
and sent word to the German commander
that the latter would have to sink him be
fore he could iand. The German skipper
asked Leary to come aboard to talk the
â â¢ n-i-.r over. The result was the sailors
were kept on ship board.
The officials are sorry the little com
mander has been disqualified. Secretary
Long to-day ordered a re-examination.
Officers once reported color-blind, how
ever, have a slim chance of promotion and
are invariably passed to the retired list.
ROBBED A TRUST COMPANY.
When Arraigned in Hew York, Young Bar
ton Accuses a Sheriff of Shielding
a Crmtnal.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 30.â Clarence
Barton, aged 23, was arraigned to-day for
robbing tbe Utah Loan and Trust Com
pany of Ogden, Utah, of $52,000 in Decem
ber. Chief of Police Davenport of Ogden
appeared as the complainant.
"This prisoner," Davenport said, "called
a.t the bank tbe day of tbe robbery to see
his brother, who was employed there.
Immediately after he left the loss of tbe
money was discovored."
Barton said: "Davenport knows a man
named Leo Graves. If lam guilty Graves
is equally so. Chief, didn't Graves con
fess to you he bad received half the money
from me?"
Davenport nodded affirmatively.
"Tlien," continued Barton, hotly, "why
is he not arrested, too? I think you are
trying to shield him. 1 '
Davenport made no reply to this accu
sation, and the magistrate said be would
commit Barton until to-morrow, to await
news from Ogden. As Barton is suffer
ing from appendicitis be was allowed to
go to the hospital instead of to jail. Bar
ton went from Ogden to Jacksonville,
Fla., where he spent money profusely.
He carried a beltful of gold eagles, and
paid a mortgage on a house owned by a
woman witb whom he lodged â Belle Olive.

LONDON, Kng., April 30.â The Crite
rion Theater was crowded this afternoon
with representative members of the ttieat
rical prolession and also the rank and
file, in response to an invitation from Sir
Charlos Wyndham, who recently received
from Passmore Edwards, proprietor of the
Daily Echo and Weekly Time*, and tue
"British Georce W. Chiids," a proposition
to erect a home for actors' orphans.
Charles Wyndham was elected presi
dent and expressed his hearty indorse
ment of the project. For some such
charity, he said, a great need existed, but
between actors' funds and similar bene
ficial movements there was such a dram
upon the linances of the profession thai
it liad not hitherto been found practica
ble to go into the iounaing of institu
tions.
Mr. Edwards outlined his plans and
suggested the appointment ol a com
mittee on locality, site and other details.
The meeting adopted a resolution
heartily approving the proposed benefac
tion, expressing its deep and heartfelt
thanks to Mr. Edwards and appointing a
committee as suggested in his address.'

COLORED GANG OF
SEVEN LYNCHED
They Had Murdered and
Cremated a Family
of Three.
Run Down by Bloodhounds,
the Monsters Confess
the Crime.
Taken From Jail at Midnight by a
Mob, Hanged. Shot and
Burned*
HOUSTON, Texas, April 30.â Seven
negroes were lynched by a negro mob at
Sunnyside last night for criminally as
saulting a young woman and a 7-year
oli child, then murdering both of them
and an aged man who attempted to pro
tect them.
Last fall a gentleman from Brenham
was robbed of $65. Four of the Thomas
boys confessed the theft, saying they bad
given $30 of the money to an old negro
named Henry Daniels. Daniels spent the
money and last sunday evening the
Thomas boys decided to either collect tbe
$30 or kill Daniels. They carried out the
hitter part of the programme.
Duniels lived in a little hut with his
stepdaughter, Marie, and a 7-year-old
child at Sunnyside. Wednesday night
the bouse was broken open and Marie
Daniels and her 7-year-old companion
assaulted. Old Daniels was cluDbed to
death while trying to protect them. Tbe
bodies of Daniels and his step-dauebter
were thrown into the house and tbe child's
body into a well. The house was then
tired and the corpses in it cremated. When
the neighbors noticed that Daniels and
his family were missing tbe charred ruins
of tbe house were searched and blood
stains and the bodies found.
Bloodhounds went straight to tbe place
whore tbe Thomas gang resided ami these
members were secured: Fayette Rhone,
21 years; Will Gates, 35; Louis Thomas,
30; Aaron Thomas. 13; Jim Thomas, 14;
Ben Thomas, 15; Will Williams, 19. Ail
were smeared with blood and a bloody
shirt was found. They confessed tbe
crime.
All seven were under guard at midnight
last night when the guards were overpow
ered by a mob and the prisoners were
taken toward Brazos Bottom, north of
here. Later about fifty shots were tired
and ali was quiet.
This morning, dangling from the limbs
of a large oak tree, were found the bodies
of six negroes. The bodies of Wilt Gates
and Louis Thomas were burned from the
waist. Williams' body has not been
found, but the shots probably explain his
absence. Late to-night the bodies were
still hanging. The mob was composed of
whites and blacks, with the negroes
largely predominating.
ALTGELD IN FINANCIAL STRAITS.
Illinois Anarchistic Ex- Governor a Heavy
Loser Lately in Chicago Building
Enterprises.
CHICAGO, 111., Aprii 30.â Altgeld, ex-
Judgh of the Superior Court, ex-Governor
of the State and an open sympathizer
with anarchists, is in deep water finan
cially. Aitgeld has been a firm believer in
Cnicago real estate. For many years he
has owned a valuable eisihl-story build
ing in the best part of the wholesale dis
trict, has been chief owuer of the Unity
building, a eizteeu-story office structure,
and within the past five years has engaged
heavily iv other building operations. To
finance all these schemes Altgeld needed
a lot of money and was a large borrower
from the collapsed Globe Bank. Refer
ring to his money transactions Altgeld
says:
''During the last ten years I have built
six of the largest buildings in Chicago,
and in that tiroc have borrowed heavily of
>f ih<> I'-ge baiiKr. My indebted
ness to the Globe Bank arose chiefly from
taking up paper placed in the East which
came back. 1 will say that no bank that
ever loaned me a dollar has lost a penny;
they have always got principal and inter
est. I had absolute confidence in the
Globa Bank. A number of my close
friends kept accounts at the bank, and are
losing heavily by the failure. Lanehart,
the closest personal friend I had, was on
spakhim'a bond, and from present ap
pearances his estate is wiped out, and his
widow will get nothing from it. Spalding's
failure has brought more ruin and dis
tress around my family and among my
friends than anywhere else."
It was reported on good authority to
day that Altgeld has disposed of his inter
est in the Ozden Gas Company to Jacob
Franks for $200,000. Franks hopes to make
the property worth millions. It is be
lieved thsit pressure from the receiver of
the National Bank of Illinois, acting in
the interests of depositors, was the main
reason for Altgeld's sale of the stock. The
bank holds about $80,000 claims against
Altgeld, nearly all of which is on notes
given by his iorm-r partner, Lanehart,
which Altgeld indorsed. The bank re
cently riled claims for $48,000 in the Pro
bnte Court against the Lanehnrt estate,
and the records show that $40,000 of Unity
Building bonds were deposited with the
bank as collateral. In addition to these
are claims of $'23,500 in the United States
court against Lanehart and Altgeld, and
these are also secured by Unity Building
bonds to the extent of $14,000. The bank
also holds a claim of about $7000 against
Altgeld on a personal unsecured note.
MISS ERVIN A STAR WITNESS.
The Woman tor Whom Spalding Wrecked a
Bank Amuses the Senatorial In-
vestigating Committee.
CHICAGO, 111., April 30.â Miss Sarah
Ervin, the woman in the Spalding Globe
Savings Bank csse, was the star witness
before the Senate Investigating Commit
tee at the Great Northern Hotel this
morning. She surprised the committee
by saying at the close of an hour's exam
ination:
"I expect Mr. Spalding would have ob
tained a divorce and that we would have
been married."
Miss Ervin amused the Senators about
her safety-deposit box, to which Spaiding
had the key. She never put in anything
of value, but whanever she needed money
she or Spaiding would go to the box and
find it. Armed with a power of attorney
from Miss Ervin Spaiding also kept the
box tilled with mortgages, notes, bonds
and deeds. She was ignorant of the dif
ference between any of these papers or of
how much money Â«he had received from
her benefactor and had no idea of where
she got the money for the $18,000 house
which the Ervin family was living in be
fore she surrendered it to the receiver.
biie discovered that she owned the prop
erty last Jail. It never occurred to her
that Spaiding could be losing on invest
ments he made for her, and she refused to
admit that sue knew all of this property
was a gift from Spaiding because ol his
relations with her and their prospective
marriage. To such embarrassing ques
tions she smilinely replied, "Don't Know."

WEYLER'3 LYING REPORTS AS
TO PACIFICATION.
All the Provinces Are Yet Swarm-
Ing With Rebels and They Even
Threaten Havana.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 30.â 1t is hard
to understand how General "Weyler dares
to announce the pacification of the prov
inces of Santa Clara, Matanzas, Havana
and Pinar del Rio. when at least 25,000 in
surgents are in them. It is a notorious
fact that in this province the insurgents
are more than 8000 strong, well provided
with arms and ammunition around Ma
druga alone, not more than fifty miles
from the capital. Colonel Raoul Arango
has 1500 troops. About 3000 Cubans are
scattered in bands of 500 and swarm be
tween Guines and BatabaAo, harassing
the Spanish columns.
General Alejandro Rodriguez, who is
the insurgent commander-in-chief ot the
province, is farther eastward with 2000,
and the rest of the patriots in this region
are under Colonel Nestor Aranguren, near
the boundaries of Pinar del Rio province,
and commanding many small towns
around Punta Brava and a great part of
the coast.
Tho names of Rodriguez, Arango and
ira.iguren are so well known ana their
military operations commented on so
generally that Weyler's declarations have
been admitted to be a lie even by the un
compromising Spaniard press, which is
gazged. The papers do not contradict
the captain-general, but even the scanty
news of the war which the censor allows
to be published is enough to prove that
fighting is constant at the very gates of
Havana.
The battalion of San Quintin, which
Cirujeda commanded wben gallant Gen
eral Maceo was killed, has been nearly ex
terminated in several engagements with
the insurgents a few miles from Havana.
Weyler hopes to defeat the insurgents by
guerrilla warfare and ordered the San
Quintin Battalion scattered into tands of
100 each and to right without rest. The re
sult has been that one after another of tbÂ«
Spanish bands have fallen into ambush,
according to the plans prepared by Rodri
guez and Aranguren, and few have es
caped the machetes of the Cubans.
Without a thorough knowledge of the
country and embarrassed by rural non
combatants, who hate the Spaniards on
account of the persecution ordered by
Weyler, the Spanish soldiers have wan
dered blindly about, while tue Cubans are
constantly apprised of the enemy's where
abouts. Of the 1000 under the command
of Cirujeda in February only 15(1 remain.
The battalion has been reorganized with
troops Irom other detachments and the
guerrilla system abandoned.
In Pinar del Rio province the insurgents
are about 5000 strong. They are not con
fined to the Sierra de Organos Mountains,
as official reports say, but scattered from
San Antonio Cape to Mar. el. Yidnl Du
casse, their best leader, is fighting me
Spanish column every day.
General Weyler has received orders by
cable from Spain to so slowly with the in
troduction of reforms, but to announce
them and promise that they wilt be exe
cuted more liberally than the decree indi
cates. The general opinion is the promul
gation of reforms is intended only as a
prelude to trying again in France or Eng
land to nogotiaie a new loan.

MILLIONS IN GOLD
GOING TO EUROPE
Largest Shipment of the
Season to Be Made
To-Day.
Unsettled Conditions Abroad
Lead to the Unusual
Demand.
The Heavy Drain Will Make No
Perceptible Difference to
This Country.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 30.-Four
million dollars in cola, the largest ship
ment tbis season, goes abroad to-morrow
and about a million has already been en
gaged for shipment next week. I'nder
ordinary circumstances we should not be
tending gold abroad in Us usual direction
before May or June. Th:s year, however,
the outward mcmmem began earlier De
cause of the opportunity to discount usual
conditions. The unsettled condition of
Europe in the light of the Eastern situa
tion has bred a disposition to get more
gold, and since conditions are in favor of
cetting it the exchange is only slightly
below the figure at which an outward
shipment is commonly said to be profit
able. That is ordinarily put at $4 84^,
and Thursday exchange was $4 Sl} 2 lo
$4 87? 4 . Foreign houses wanted gold
D;id.y enough to pay the slight difference.
The outgoing gold is all consigned to
port towns and its exact destination
;s not definitely known. Russia is known
to have ordered large quantities of gold.
Greece toot Â£1, 000,000 from the Bank of
England, but the bank's holdings in
creased during the week. The greatest
demand is said to be on account of Vienna
and Paris. Austria haÂ» been for a consid
erable period accumulating gold to en
able the country to go upon a gold basis
next year. It is reported that she needs
incomplete her preparations $15.000,C00.
The supposed commercial relations be
tween France and Austria, coupied with
the fact that Austria could not readily
get gold from London, led Paris to take
pold from available sources. Japan's
want will be supplied mainly from Eng
land. It is asserted that Austria's wants
will oe satisfied within a weeK if there is
another heavy week's shipment from the
States.
The excess of imports over exports from
January 1 to April '2H was $141, 106.000.
The total imports for this period at this
nort n-ere $2R,842,000, an increase of f 104.
- over the same period in 1896. This
is largely due to thr pending tariff bill.
Tke balance of trade, however, cannot
be taken as an absolute indication ot the
trend of the gold now. Aside from other
influence?, the figures in the ba'ance sheet
take no cognizance of the exchanges con
stantly passing between this country and
abroad. These are numberless, and the
exact state of them is not definitely
known.
Rents ar.-i interest and dividends are
steadily going over the water to foreign
owners of property here. Qupen Victoria
herself owns property in New York. Great
numbers of American travelers in Europe
expend lots or" money there which has to go

A good many millions in gold could be

making the slightest difference to this
country. It has been said that $20,000,000
will go out during the present movemen t,
but the' sum will not be nmsed. The
Treasury has more than $54,000,000 in gold
above the $100, 000,000 traditionally held in

IBLVSti Mi: DAL* OF any
>(US Board la Appointed to Make the
Vroper ncnrdj.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 30.â A
board, consisting of Secretary Alser, Gen
eral Miles, Adjutant-General Ruggies and
Colonel Ai:isworth, chief of the Record
and Pension Division, was appointed to
day to consider the awards of medals of
honor and to recommend to the President
the names of p*nons deserving recogni
tion. The medal ol honor corresponds to
the Victoria cross, and is conferred for
marked personal bravery of officers or en
listed men of the regular or volunteer
armies in the War of the Rebellion.
Under the last administration the dis
tribution of these inedala was in the hands
of the Assistant Secretary of War. Secre
tary Alcer thinks the greatest care should
be exercired in conferring the honor.
Great pressure ;s frequently brought to
bear on ihe War Department in behalf of
applicants, and the board is appointed
with a view to weeding out the unwar
ranted claims.
General AlÂ«er will try the "honor" sys
tem with the War Department. He re
voked the orders which compelled chiefs
01 divisions to keep "tab" on the attend
ance and won: of theirclerks, as it savored
too much of the primary school to suit
the Secretary's taste. He believes adults
should not be given black marks because
a minute or two tardy, and will trust to
their honor to report any delinquency.

POT IN RETIREMENT
BY THE PRESIDENT
Colonel Bambridge of
the Third Artillery Out
of Active Service.
Said to Have Ended His Use-
fulness at the Age of
Six.y-two.
Ssvaral Deserving Officers of the
Army Are Benefted by Secur
ing Merited Promotion.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 30.â
Colonel Edmund C. Bambridge, com-
mar.ding the Third Artillery at San
Francisco, was placed on the retired list
to-day by direction of the President, .tii^
is Bambridge's sixty-second birthday, and
under the law an officer can be retired at
discretion when he reaches that age or at
his own request.
The age limit of service is 64 years, and
ordinarily an officer is allowed to remain
on the active list r.ntil he rounds that
period. Very seldom retirements are
compulsory, and while reasons for such
action is usually assigned, the President
is not obliged to give any. The oniy ex
planation made at the War Department
was that executive action wai tafcen in
Banic-ridgs's case as he has outlived his
usefulness as an officer.
Two recent compulsory retirements
were those of Brigadier-Gpnerul Carr by
President Harrison and Colonel Crofton
by Cleveland.
The retirement of Bambridge will result
in the following promotions in the artil
lery: Lieutenant-Colonel Marcus P. Mil
ler of the First to be colonel of the Third,
Major Jacob B. Rawles of the Fourth to
be lieutenant-colonel of tho First, Captain
Louis Smith of the Third to be major of
the Fourth, First Lieutenant Charles W.
Hobbs of tne Third to be captain of the
Third and Second Lieutenant Skerritt of
the Fifth to be first lieutenant of the
Third.
GREATRUSH TO THE WHITE HOUSE
Office -Seekers Consder the Notice That
Thsy Will Not Be Received as
a Huge Joke.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30â The
crowd of office-seekers besieging the
White House to-day, the first since the
President's return lrom the Grant
memorial exercises, was unusually large
despite trie fact it was Cabinet day, upon
which the President has declined to re
ceive -visitors except Senators and Rep
resentatives. Place-seekers evidently con
sider this order a huge joke. Lung before
10 o'clock, the hour for receiving visitors,
the corridor outside the President's room
and the hallways leadin.r to the main
corridor were packsd. About the time
for the Cabinet meeting the crowd thinned
perceptibly, but later in the afternoon the
same faces were again seen, many re
fusing to leave without seeing the Presi
dent. Even Secretary Porter's announce
ment that tbePresident would see none but
Senators and Representatives had little
effect.
The Cabinet assembled at 11 o'clock,
the first time 'or a week. The President
announced his intention to fend Hon.
W. J. Calboun ava special commissioner
to Cuba to investigate the Ruiz murder,
and the selection was considered good.
Nothing of interest developed during the
meeting. After the Cabinet, adjourned
Attorney-General McKenna announced
the President would not interlere in the
cese of Joseph Duniap, the Chicago editor
who has been sentenced to two years'
hard labor in Joiiet penitentiary for send
ing alleged obscne matter through tue
mails. Judge McKenna to wbom tne case
whs referred made a careful examination
into the facts, reporting the only miti
gating circumÂ«tnnces in the case was
Dunlap's physical condition.
The telegraph manager at tne White
House was to-day arranging for the Presi
dent to touch the button which will start
the wheels at the Nashville Exposition.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30. -In
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1897.
the United States Supreme Court to-day
ex- Attorney-General Hart won a point
for Florence Blythe Hinckley. The Court
acted on General Hart's application and
directed that the transcript presented by
the defendant in error De printed and
submitted with a motion to dismiss St
for May 10. This brings upon that dale
Hart's motion to dismiss the appeal filed
by Jefferson Chandler, who claims that
the California court had no right to

J WIZOXGEI* WIFE'S VEHQKAXCE,
Ihrnslift Hr Recre Â»Â»it Hutband on a
If'.-r Â«/i :jj //.in Thoroughfare.
WASHINGTON, D. C, ADril 30.â An
j injured wife, a rt-creant husband and a
comely mulatto girl were the persons, and
Pennsylvania avenue, near Fifteenth
street, the scene of a lively episode this
evening, in which the husband was
knocked out in the first round, the girl
put to flight and the wife's vengeance sat
isfied. The man was weil dressed. His
companion was a Ji;;ht- colored mulatto
girl, neatly dressed, who chatted with
him in a familiar manner.
The wife stepred into a doorway and
awaited the coming of the pair. When
ttie man was within ten feet the little
woman jumped from her hiding-place.
"This v what keeps you in Washington,
! is it, you brute? Take that, and that, and
i that ; and don't you ever darken my door
: again."
The attack of the woman was so im
i petnous, so unexpected, and conducted
with such fury thai in* man was whipped
before he knew what had struck him.
With a single blow, squarely on the face,
the plucky little woman finished him, ana
i split her kid glove. Following up her ad
! vantage, she again punched him vic.ously
1 beloiv the belt and landed a third on his
: mouth.
The man was either too badly surprised
I to defend Himself or decline.! to repel the
attack of his wife. At the first sipn of an
j encounter the colored girl fled precipi
tately from the scene, and as soon as he
i could release himself from the grasp of
! his enraged assailant ihe man did like
wise.
The wife said she was Miss Emiline M.
McMullen, daughter of an old railroad
contractor of Sacramento, Cal. Eighteen
j months ago Â«he went to Cincinnati to
visit an old schoolgirl friend and there
she met T. J. Watfcins, the man she put
to rout. Tim acquaintance resulted in
marriage and the two went to housekeep
ing. During the time bhe had known
Watkins tn* woman said she had ad
vanced Dim $2000.
PEItKIXS 1* HOT WATER.
Hit Position on the Hawaiian treaty
Stir* Up San Franciscans.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 30.â
Hawaiian reciprocity treaty tight is get
tine hot. Senator Perkins is in a dilem
manad seems to be greatly worried over
the matter. The interview with him pub
lished exclusively in Thursday's Call
seems to have stirred up the San Francis
co people. He has received scores of tele
grams from California alluding to The
Call's Washington dispatch which an
nounced the position of Mr. Perkins on
the treaty: When seen at the Maltby
building this morning Senator Parkins
saia:
"The interview you sent has got me into
trouble."
. "Wfi not your position correctly
stated?" asked the correspondent. -
"On, yes, 1 have no complaint to make,
but it raised a regular hornets' â¢ nest
around my head."
Senator Perkins is between the devil
and the deep sea. Hugh Craig of the
Chamber of Commerce has written him in
effect:
"You were honored with the Senator
ship by California and now we demand
that you regard the wishes of California
people."
Tue letter which Mr. Craig writes for
the Chamber is mandatory in its tone and
some Senators might consider it offensive.
Senator Perkins showed it to The Call
correspondent. .
Senator Perkins . to-day received tele
grams from friends in San Francisco, say
ing that Mr. Claus Spreckels is rather in
clined-to believe that Senator Perkins
should stand by the announcement said
to have been heretofore made by him, that
he would vote to abbrogate the treaty.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30â The
United btates Supreme Court to-day dis
missed the motion for a writ of certiorari
in the caae of the Anglo-CJalifornian Bank
aeainst the Secretory of the Treasury.
'J ma, in effect, sustains the action of the
Secretary, who decided that the dispuud
steel rails must pay rates of import duties
under the McKinJey tariff law instead of
the Wilson act.
TO BE PROMOTED
Will Succeed McKenna
on the Circuit Court
Bench.
Waymire Will Then Slip Into
the Vacancy in the Dis
trict Court.
Prefers a Life Position to a Few
Years of Glory as a Member
of the Cabinet. .;
WASHINGTON., D. C, April 30.â Judge
W. W. Morrow will be appointed United
States Circuit Judge to succet d Judge
McKenna, and Judge James A. Way mire
will be appointed United States District
Judg â¢ to succeed Morrow.
This seems to be certain. Judge Way
mire called on the Preside:! i to-day, in
company with ex-Attorney-General Hart
of California. Judge Waymire was seei)
to-night, but was reluctant to discuss his
chances tor the Judgeship.
The Call correspondent understands,
however, that Judge Waymire told the
President he was not a candidate for At-
torney-General to succeed McKenna when
the latter is appointed to the United
States Supreme bench. Judge Waymire
stated to a friend to-niebt that he would
rather be a United Spates Judge for a life
tenure than to have three or lour years'
hard work and a liitle transient glory as
Attorney-General in the i'residem's Cabi
net.
Besides, Judge Way mire understands
that there J8 now pending before the lead
ers of both houses of Congress a proposi
tion to abolish district, courts altogether
and meigs them into the circuits.
Many lawyers think tLat the district
courts rniqht as well be abolished alto
gether and let the business come before
the circuit courts. If this were to be done
there would be lour circuit courts in Cali
fornia, and Judjje Waymire havinjr been
appointed a district, judge to succeed Mor
row would thus become one of the new
circuit, judges. This proposition is now
being considered by the Judiciary Com
mittees of the Senate and House, and in
all probability tne bill will become a law.

Ao Provision for their Tartlclpation in
the Queen* Jubilr-e.
LONDON, Esc, April 30.â Ministers
and representative laymen of churches
outside the paio of the established (or
Episcopal) church are up in arms over the
fact that so far as they have been able to
ascertain no provision is to be made for
their representation at the religious ser
vices incident to the Queen's jubilee, nor
at any of the official tunctions connected
therewith.
Calls have been issued for meetings of
the national committees of the Baptists,
Presbyterians, Methodists and other de
nominations, with the view of making rep
resentations to the Prince of Wales, as
the head of the â¢ committee of arrange
ments upon the subject.. ..â¢- .. ..
The general committee of the Congre
gational Union has already taken up the
matter. and has adopted this resolution,
which will probably serve as a text for the
other protesting denominations:
The committee of 'he Congregational Union
of Enpla; d and Wales, representing more
than 4HOO churcneti, with a constituency of ai
leas; 1,250,000 persons, are desirous of hav

NASHVILLE IS FILLING UP.
The Southern Exposition Will Be Opened

NASHVILLE, Ten.v, April SO.-The
Athens of the South U filling up with
visitors preparatory to the formal inau
guration to-morrow of the exposition
whicn marks the one hundredth anniver
sary of Tennessee' 3 Statehood.
Many of the arrivals are specially in
vited cues!?, commissioners or other dis
tinguished representatives of the various
States, but the great majority of visitors
are Southern people rilled with pride over
what a Southern State has accomplish d,
and Northern men anxious to see what
Tennessee has done with the co-operation
of her sister commonwealths.
Although the decorations are not com
plete the city already presents a mag
nificent appearance, while the exposition
grounds are a marvel of beamy. The
opening exercises will commence at noon
to-morrow, the button whico is to start
the machinery being pressed by President
M< Kinley in Washington.
It is to be a great and an attractive af
fair, having exhibits from most of the
htates of the I T :non, as also from Europe
an<i Asia. There has recently been
some apprehension that the success oi
it would be impaired, n a measure, by
tiie Hoods which have wrought so much
destruction in the States that border on
the Mississippi River, and it is probable
that the Bomber of visitors will be re
ih^ed on this account; but the managers
are as active and nearly as hopeful as
they were at any time in the past two
years. The wealth ami the enterprise of
Tennessee are fully engaged in its behalf
and the popular enthusiasm over it in the
State is unbounded. There will be disap
pointment at Nashville if Jess than a
million visitors appear there within the
next half year.
The first three days of the exposition
will be in the hands of the Supreme
Knights of the Ancient Essenic Order,
who will hold their annual convention.
The executive committee of the exposi
tion has set apart special days for the sev
eral States. "New 'York day" will occur
at the end of the month of June. There
are also to be days' for telegraphers, for
freighters, for Union and Coniederate vet
eians, for press nssociations, for various
religious denominations, for railroad
brakemen, for good citizen?, for women,
for docors and for all k nds and varieties
of people. There is of course to be a con
gress of religions like that which was held
at tae time of the Chicago fair.

IN FAIR HAWAII
But Uncle Sam intends
to Closely Watch the
Japanese.
Two Warships to Be Kept
Constantly at Honolulu
Harbor.
Interesting Complications May Fol
low the Turning Away of the
Japanese Immigrants.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30.â News
from Yokohama and Honolulu about
Japan's attitude regarding Hawaii has not
caused alarm to this Government, al
though it is admitted matters may become
serious through the state of feeling in
Japan. Nothing was said on the subject
at the Cabinet meeting 10-day, ana careful
Inquiry indicated no action had been
taken by either the Secretary of State or
Navy looking to the better protection of
American interests in the islands. It is
understood by the administration that
the Hawaiian Government would like the
United States to send more war vessels to
Honolulu, and there has been some talk
favorable to this among naval officers, but
Secretary Long has not given considera
tion to the subject. Whether or not this
understanding is the result of official inti
mation from Hawaii was not ascertained,
but it was said the Hawaiian legation has
urged on Secretary Sherman the moral
effect the presence of ships would have on
the Japanese and the restraining influence
they would exert in preventing a spread of
dissensions said to exist against the Dole
Government.
News dispatches from Honolulu say
that Smith, Attorney-General, has re
turned from his visit to Washington.
Smith sounded the administration while
in this country, and ex-Minister Thurston,
who accompanied him. is still here as a
representative of his Government in the
interest of securing the annexation of the
islands. The McKinley administration is
known to be favorable to annexation, and
it is understood it is willing to negotiate
an annexation treaty just as soon as the
tariff bill is disposed of, but it uoes not
inteud to take any step to interfere with
the discussion oJ that measure in the
ben ale.
Nothing has been heard by the State
Department from Japan as to the
views and attitude of the United States
toward Hawaii, as indicated by sending
the cruiser Philadelphia to Honolulu
iiiter permission to land had been refused
Japanese immigrants.
The Japanese newspapers interpret this
action as a menace to their Government,
but it is said in official circles here that
so rue of the statements on the subject in tue
jre?s ot Japan are erroneous and a denial
is given to-day from an authoritative
source to the news item that the United
States Minister at Tokio has been carry
ing on telegraphic correspondence with
the State Department about l:;e Hawaiian
situation. It is also tfeuied that Great
Britain has intimated to this Government
it objects to the annexation of the isl
ands. Great Britain had an experience
in the past that showed the United States
does not brook anything savoring of
British control of Hawaii. What McKin
ley will do depends largely on the action
of Japan. If Japan gives way to popular
clamor for the dispatch of a fleet to
Hawaii the Philadelphia will be re-en
forcea by the American squadron.
This Government believes, however,
there is no crisis and depends on the
friendly feelings of the Japanese to bring
about a peaceful settlement of the present
difficulty. Secretary Long said to-night
the assignment of the Philadelphia was
made because the President recognized
that the Hawaiian question was liable to
attract the serious attention of the United
states in the event of trouble at Honoluiu,
and in view of the importance of peace in
the islands to the American residents and
their interests it was deemed advisable to
eend a farst-clas* ship there in addition to
the Marion, now on that station. Tnese
two ships, Long said, will be retained at
the islands indefinitely, but if found
necessary to recall either for repairsthe
Baltimore will be sent out at once in order
to give the United States two ships at
Honolulu at all times. Long does not be-
Jieve a necessity will ariÂ«e to dispatch
other vessels from Mare Island, but if v
does he says there are several which can
be drawn upon at short notice.

LAVIGNE 1$ STILL CHAMPION.
Steps Eddie Connolly in Eleven Rcunds,
After the Hottest Battle He
Ever Fought.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 30-George
Lavicne is stiil ihe undisputed iigntweight
champion of the world. In a glove fight
to-ni-ht, replete with interesting features,
he succeeded in stopping Eddie Connolly
of St. John, N. 8., in eleven rounds.
Unli&e several aspiring pugilists who
have confronted the champion In tbepast,
Connolly showed no inclination to sprint
around the rins >n an effort to stay
through the twenty-rive rounds, but stood
up like a man anxious to win or be de
cisively beaten. For the first four rounds
Connolly put up the hottest argument
ever experienced tv Lavigne. He out
boxed the fcaginaw wonder, punishing
him severely, and those ignorant of the
phenomena! strength and pugnacity of
Lavigne believed he would be compelled
to bite the dust.
Lavigne did not alter his well-known
methods a panicle. He never let up in
his vicious attacks until Connolly was
hopelessly beaten. Tne New Brunswick
man clearly demonstrated that he is a
very clever two-handed boxer and plucky
to a fault, for in ihe last rounii, when re
peatealy knocked down by wicked smashes
on tne jaw, he stubbornly refused to take
advantage of the usual time limit and
staggered quickly to his feet. Had he
used better judgment he would surely have
been able to continue when the bell for
the twelfth round rang, but even in such
an event he had absolutely no chance :o
win. This point was readily appreciated
by his seconds, who prevented his sustain
ing further injury by throwing up the
sponge.
Laviccne never fought better. He was
trained to the hour, possessed the strength
of a lion and put so much steam behind
his blows that it is a wonder how his op
ponent stood up so long. Laviene laughed
heartily as his friends cheered and tried
to grip his blood-stained gioves in hearty
congratulations. Connolly was heart
broken over his downfall, and when his
seconds pulled off his gloves he burst into
tears.
STAMFORD VS. BERKELEY.
Hew the College Teams W II Line Up for

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
30.â Stanford and Berkeley will settle the
university championship to-moFrow in
San Francisco. Each team has won one
victory and has practiced steadily since
the last game. It Berkeley wins it will
oe the first year she has ever won the
championship, while Stanford on the other
hand is just as anxious to maintain her
good standing on Hie baseb.ill diamond.
A hotly contested game is therefore as
sured.
Beckett, '00, will pitch for Stanford, and
he is now in excellent form. This is the
first year he has ever pitched for a team,
and his work shows much promise. Dur
ing the last few evenings of practice hejhas
pitched several good games. Jeffs, Strohn,
Thompson and Wight have also shown up
well in; practice.

The second tennis contest between Scan

by Picber '98, Freeman '99, and possibly
McGilvray '99. The douules are scheduled
to come off in the moraine, and Freeman
and Picher- will form Stanford's team.
If three games instead of live determine
ibis contest, Freeman will also play in the
singles. The reason of this arrangement
is that the clever tennis player is needed
in the baseball game in the afternoon.
At any event Freeman will be given a
quantity of exercise that only a strong

ATLANTA, Ga., April 30.â The War
Department has ordered the court-martial
investigating the charges against Captain
Romeyn continued indefinitely. The ex
act meaning of this order is unknown, but
there is a very general belief that the de
partment is growing weary of the scandals
emanating from its garrisons and will
make this investigation sufficiently thor
ough to discouiage any future repetition
ot them.
Colonel Porter, acting commandant,
when asked to-nieht who was going to be
tried through with Romeyn replied: "I
don't know. I have received charges of
various sorts and have lorwarded them to
my superiors. There seems little doubt
that one of the iirsi duties of the recon
vened court will be to iry Lieutenant
O'Brien on the counter-charges preferred
by Captain Romeyn."
These affect nearly the entire military
career of O Brien. The statute of limita
tion will bar tbe niott interesting portions
of O'Brien's experiences in Japan, where
he occupied the responsible post of ob
server-in-chief foi the army during the
war between Japan and China. The
charges against O'Brien, which are ad
mitted to come within the jurisdiction of
the court, narrate some lively episodes of
his l.fe since he came to Fort McPherson.

FAILURE OF THE
EASTERN FRUITS
Jack Frost and Floods
Have Ruined the
Crops.
Peaches Will Be Very Scarce
in Delaware This
Year.
Now California Crowers Will Profit
by Sending Many Carloads
to the East.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 30.â The
damage to the fruit crop is the topic of
considerable correspondence among fruit
men here since reports of the freeze of
April 20 were received. The Fruitman's
Guide and Fruit Trade Journal will give
prominence to-morrow to a summary of
the reports from all parts of the country.
These and letters to merchants differ bo
greatly that conservative fruitmen re
fuse to hazard opinions yet on the actual
condition of the crop.
From Delaware a ruin of from 25 to 90
per cent of the crop is reported. Seaford,
Del., seems to have suffered most, one
report saying that all the blossoms in the
vicinity had been killed. It is conserva
tively estimated there will not be over a
quarter of a crop in Sussex County, Del.
E. L. Godsell estimates the loss in the
EaÂ«t at $2,000,000 and considers the year
will be similar to 1890, when he sold 500
carloads of California fruit here at the
averace price of $1400. The average since
then has been about $900.
According to the Fruit Trade Journal
the peach crop of Delaware ; for the last
four years has been: 1893, 4,082,0:82 bask
ets; 1894, 3.129,000; 1895, 2.100,000; 1896,
3,513,000. One estimate for 18Q7 is 1,500,000
baskets.
While tba new wool growth for the last
year was in many instances only from
four to six inches, many orchards had an
immense number of blossoms and were
able to stand considerable loss by frost.
The June fall of peaches must be consid
ered in all estimates of the crop, but there
is no way of predicting what it will be.
Aside from the freeze of April 'JO the
Georgia fruit crops have been killed by
the weather. The severe cold in Decem
ber caused considerable damage in New
England and Northern New York. Very
little damage has been reported vet in
New Jersey or along the Hudson Hiver,
and dealers are looking to these localities
for the season's supply. When the Jersey
crop failed last year Michigan sent about
a hundred carloads of fruit, and there are
so far fine prospects for a crop from that
State this year.
While especial stress is laid on the in
jury to peach orchards, all summer fruits
have suffered about alike. Early berry
blossoms, especially strawberries, are en
tirely destroyed. All early vegetables in
the zone of the freeze were cut down, but
many will come up again or be replaced
with later varieties.
CROPS IN CALIFORNIA.
Some Dropping of Fruit in Certain Lo
calities, but the Yield Will
Be Fair.
VISALIA, Cal., April 30.â Peaches
promise a heavy crop, except in a few
scattering places, where late frost 3 affected
them. A number of orcliardists are
thinning their peaches already. They
| will probably have the largest crop ever
gathered here. Apricots were pretty well
thinned out by the frosts. There will be
a light crop. Prunes were not injured by
the late frosts. An extremely heavy crop
is now in prospect. They are not dropping
in this locality as much as the orchardists
would like to see, except from the younger
j trees. Pears promise a heavy crop also.
They were uninjured by frost. There are
probably not fifty cherry trees in this dis
j trict, and that crop is not considered here.
I The Valley road wiil have hundreds of
I carloads of fruit to handle Urn season.
WILLOWS, Cal., April 30.â As far as
can tie ascertained, the cherry crop is good,
i Dut there are but few trees in each orchard
I in the county. The outlook for peaches is
! better than for several years past. The
! prune crop is much larger than that of
I lust year. The wind caused a few to drop
about ten da3 r s ago. Tbe prospects for
apricots is from fair to good. There will
be a heavy yield of pears, judging from
present indications. The dropping time
for pears has not yet arrived. On the
I whole, the fruit crop of Gienn County is
I quite promising.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 30.â 1t is too
I early vet to form an accurate estimate of
j tbe fruit crop, hut all indications point to
a bounteous vieJd of all kinds of fruit in
Santa Clara Valley this season, But little
fruit has dropped, and no serious damage
will result in this respect. Cherries set
weli; there has been no drop, and tbe
crop will be a big one. There will bÂ« a
good yield of ppjehes. There is a heavy
blight on prunes, but it is now too early
to tell whether there will be any damage.
The trees were covered with blossoms,
and if the buds set well tnere will be an
immense crop. Apricots were not in
jured to any extent by the frost, and
promise to be very pood. Pears will be
more than an average crop.
LOS GAIOS, Cal., April 30.â Some
growers complain of cherries being light,
but, on the whole, prospects are lino for
good crops. They are not <l Topping much.
The peach crop is light. Of upricois there
will be a good crop of Moorparks, but
Blenheims an.i Royals light. The pear
trees will yield a full crop. Prunes will
be light â ess t an tbe usual crop. They
are dropping badly because of the warm
weather when they were in blossom.
However, the same complaint is heard
nearly every season, but the crop of
prunes often proves to be a fair one.
SONOMA, Cal, April 30.â ThÂ« fruit
croj) ot the Sonoma Valley was badly
damaged by the north wind which pre
vailed last Saturday. Prunes suffered
most and are dropping off so fast as to
threaten the entire crop. Pear?, which a
week ago gave promise of an immense
yield, are also dropping, but to no great
exient. There will be a fair crop of
peaches and apricots. Apples and cher
ries giv* promise of an immense yield.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 30.â The
cast few week* have in a measure de
stroyed all hopes of a phenomenal fruit
yield in this section. Growers and dryers
of fruit who were sanguine of big cops a
month ago now appear dubious, but will
not admit a total or even a half failure.
An early frost nipped the opening buds
and caused some dropping, especially
among prunes. Then came three days of
a hot norther, scorching many of the
tender buds and whitening the ground
with blns?cms in exposed orchards. The
lack of rain â which, by thÂ« way, is very
unusual in this county at this season â is
being felt severely. A light warm rain
within the next lew days would be worth
thousands of dollars. A summary on the
fruit crop gleaned from well-informed
orchardists shows that the peach crop is
light; prunes ;are dropping badly; pears
are a lair crop; cherries unaffected by
iroat or wind, Â»ud Â« wonderful crop is.
JAMES BROOKS, THE SANGER MANIAC , AND THE SCENES
OF HIS CRIME AND DEATH.
The tragedy near Sanger la->t Tuesday
night, in which James Brooks, mad will
love for the girl, made a desperate at
tempt to murder Miss Neoma Quails and
her mother in their home at night anc
then kill himself, is still uppermost in the
minds of the people of Fresno. The ter
rible resolution of the insane lover to take
life, and the manner in which he stolt
into the house, wherÂ« the two defenseless
women were sleeping, and shot them,
supply an unusual chapter in the crimi
nal history of the county. His intended
victims will recover. It probably was for
tunate that the fiend ended his owe
career, for the neighbors of the Quail!
would surely have dispatched him in i
summary manner hart he lived.

here, ant of these the yield will be licht
HEALDSBURG, Cal.. April 30.-Up to
the past. few days indications were tine
fora splendid fruit crop,. but reports from
Dry Creek, Russian River and Alexander
valleys tend to show that prunes and
pears are dropping badly and wilj not be
over half a crop. Yield of freestone peaches j
promises well, but clings are licht. The '
cherry crop is the heaviest in years, In
the opinion of prominent orcharding the
drop is believed to have been caused by
the excessively warm weather.
WOODLAND, Cal.,. April 30.â The out
look now is that there will be. a heavy <
fruit crop, except apricots and almonds,
both of which were injured by the late
frosts. Peaches, prunes and pear- are
very promising. There are few cherry
trees in the county. There has been some
dropping, due to the north wind, but
most of the trees are overloaded and thin
nine out will be necssary.
VACAVILLE, Cal., April 30.â Cherries
are not dropping much.. The peach crop
is good, though a few of the early varie
ties are dropping. Prunes and plums are
dropping, prunes worse than the others.
The apricot crop is good and there is a
good pear crop. ' The dropping was caused
by the recent north winds.
SUISUN, Cal., April 30.â Apricots are
a short crop and the output of the valley
is estimated at twenty-five cars, against
forty last year. Pears", â¢ peaches, prunet
and cherries will be a full ,crop. The tirss
car of cherries is expected to go East
about MÂ«y 18.
HAYWARDS, Cal., April 30.â The ef
fect of the recent hot north wind was not
disastrous in this county because of the
very heavy crop of blossoms on all kinds
of fruit trees. The cherries dropped a
little, but there is still a splendid cron if
no further damage be experienced. The
peaches are in good condition, and a fair
crop isexpectel. Prune blossoms dropped
some, but there is yet a heavy.crop and a
bright prospect for â  good yield. Apricots
dropped very little, and are still so thick
that it is found necessary to thin them out
since the hot wind. Pears suffered hardly
any, and there is still a heavy crop.

STOCKTON EMBEZZLEMENT CASE.
Re/at/yes of Kleupfer, (he New Hope
Murderer and Suicide, Arrested
on a Serious Charge.
STOCKTON, Cat,., April 30.â Attorney
J. G. Swinnerton last evening swore to a
complaint drawn up by himself, charg
ing Alexander Kleupfer and his nephevr,
John Henry Kleupfer, wiih embezzle
ment. It was shown to District Attorney
Nutter, who after reading it told the
complaining lawyer that he was certainly
entitled to a complaint if the allegations
could be substantiated. Justice Parker
issued a warrant upon it, the instrument
was placed in the hands of Sheriff Cun
ningham, and no time was lost in carry
ing out its mandate.
The Sheriff of San Francisco was at
once tulepnoned to arrest Alexander
Kleupfer before he should start for his
home in Dakota, and the Sheriff of Ala
tneda County was also asked to apprehend
the nephew, whose home is in Alameda.
This morning Deputy Sheriff Black left
for the metropolis with the warrant, and
will return with the Kleupfers, who will
have to stand trial here on a serious
charge.
The alleged embezzlement grew out of
the attempt on the part cf the Kleupfers
to avoid paying Swinnerton his retainer
for the defense of Charles Francis
Kleupfer, the New Hope murderer and
suicide.
As has been stated in The Call before,
shortly before the day he hanged himself
Kleupfer gave his brother, Alexander
Kleupfer, an order for $2060, which was
on deposit in bank. The brother, after
the prisoner's death, claimed that the
money was an absolute eift, and he has
refused to pay Swinnerton the balance
claimed to be due him for ais services in
the case up to the time tnat Kleupfer
commuted suicide.
In the complaint Swinuerton alleges
that Alexander Kleupfer and his nephew,
John Henry Kleupfer, have willlully,
fraudulently and feloniously converted
to their own use the money which he
claims was due him as a retainer, and
whicn he alleges was given to the brother
in trust with the understanding that he
(the attorney) ftus to have been paid out
of the amount.
STAMFORD'S JUNIOR ANNUAL
The Fourth Voume Makes Its Appear
ance and P/eases the
Students.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
30. â The fourth volume of the Junior An
nual was received on the campus to-day
nnd is ready for distribution. The early
appearance of the book reflects great
credit on the energy of the management,
as all the previous volumes have required
at least two weeks more time for the col
lection of the vast amount of matter and
putting it into proper shape for publica
tion.
Taken as a whole it compares favorably
with the preceding annuals. Features
were made ol boih the art and literary
departments. The art wort was done by
Mis Has Harriet Morton, Liiiian Holly,
Theodora Holly, Fannie Mitchell, Lena
Brown, and ll.ti ie Hyde, t c staff artists,
and also by H. C. Aiien and Merle John
son.
In the liferary department the contri
bution of W. H. and W. A. Irwin, Miss
May Mevnck, Miss Comstock, M. John
hon and E. M. Hulaie have been favorably
com in on ted upon. There were more
"grinds" this year than usual, but aa a
rule all were eontl-natured.
The book is primed on a hijrh-grade
paper and greenish-black ink was used to
irive tone to the engravings. It contains

DIES FIGHTING FOR
HIS INDIAN WIFE
Fatal Combat Between
Pleasant Valley
Halfbreeds.
William George Worsted in a
Duel Fought in His
Tepee.
Resented an Attack Made Upon
His Squaw by a Visiting:
Buck.
GRASS VALLEY, Cal., April 30.â
William George and Frank Tom, half
breed Indians, who live in Pleasant
! Valley, fought a duel to the death at an
early hour this morning near Glennbrook
Park, on the Nevaaa City road. George
was literally cvi to pieces by bis antago
nist, eight great gashes being found on
his body, together with a number of minor
cuts.
When Coroner Hocking visited the
scene of the tragedy this morning he
found the dead taalfbreed lying on the
; ground and beside the body was seated
I the widow, moaning and weeping
piteously. In broken English she told
the officer of the tragedy that had resulted
[in the death of her husband. They bad
: been camping for two weeks at thai place.
; Frank Tom and his wife visited their
camp last night and remained until this
morning. For some reason, which the
squaw could not make plain, Tom had
| attacked her this morning and began to
i belabor her as is the custom among the
j men of his tribe when the women do any
j thine which displeases them. George
j came to her assistance and the battle
! | began.
Tiie visiting halfbreed was armed with
; a bowie-knife and this he used with
i deadly effect on George, who had gone to
, the attack with a club as his only weapon.
The widowed squaw says that the battle
lasted fur over an hour, her husband keep
ing up the unequal contest until he fell ex
hausted from loss of blood, dying in a few
minutes. The nature and the number of
nis wounds are evidence that he put up a
most stubborn resistance, anfl the wonder
is that he could have continued the light
wounded as he was. Tom's knife had
twice penetrated his lungs, and tbere were
gashes in the abdomen and throat and
over the heart.
After the killing Tom and his wife re
mained at the carop until another Indian
came along and with him they departed.
This afternoon he was arrested by Under
Sheriff Nagle, Marshal Loehr, Constable
Townsend and \V. Woliord on Clipper
j Gap road, eleven miles from Grass Valley.
I He submitted to arrest quietly and was
brought to town and lodged in jail. The
prisoner is sullen and refuses to utter a
word concerning nis crime. Beyond a few
bruises, evidently inflicted with the club
in the hands of the other halfbreed, he
was not injured during the combat.

SANDERS AGAIN
FOUND GUILTY
The Forger Sentenced
to Fourteen Years
in Prison.
Judge Cook Expresses the Be
lief That He Murdered
Wo otto n.
One of the Witnesses for the De
fense Arrested on a Perjury
Charge.
FRESNO, Cm... April 30.â Frofessor W.
A. Sanders was found guilty ibis morning
on the charpe of ionÂ»injÂ»William Wootton's
name to a $1400 draft, which he passed on
the Kutner-Gold^tein Company in this
city in February. 1894. Time for passing
sentence was waived, and at noon Judge
Carroll Cook, who has been presiding in
the trial, sentenced the defendant to four
teen years' imprisonment at San (Juentin.
Judge Cook created a sensation imme
diately after tne jury had retired to de
liberate by ordering the Sheriff to take
into custody Dr. G. B. Mclntosb, the
handwriting expert who testilied in behalf
or the defense, on a charge of perjury.
The court ordered his bail fixed at $5000,
and the doctor was taken to jail, where
he is now confined. Judge Cook stated
plainly that he Delieved the fiftieth stub
in the draftbook, to which great import
ance was attached in the case, had been
inserted by Mclntosh, and that wnile on
the stand the expert had testified falsely
as to his "discovery" of the ?tub.
Court convened in tbe morning at 8
o'clock, and the reading of his instruc
tions to the jury by the Judsje occupied
an hour's time. Judge, attorneys and
defendant all remained in the courtroom,
which was packed with spectators- Mrs.
Sanders was present, sitting a snort dis
tance from her husband. She seemed to
feel her position keenly, but the man
whose fate was in the balance maintained
the same stolid expression which has
characterized him in all the ordeals he
has passed through in the case. The de
fendant moved his chair closei to his wife
and whispered a few words to ner. The
attorneys chatted among themselves, but
every one was plainly affected by the dra
matic situation.
The minutes wore on, and each added
its grain ot hope, however slight, to the
defendant. He was expecting a disagree
ment of the jury, and trie longer it re
luained out the better indication it was
that his nope would be realized.
But at five minutes to 10 o'clock there
was a sharp rap at the door of the jury
room. In an instant al! was hushed.
Ttie defendant leaned forward a little in
his anxiety, and clo3eiy watched the
baiiiff unlock the door and talk 10 the
foreman. For the tirsi time Hie expres
sion on Sanders' face changed when the
verdict was announced, and ior a moment
he was discouraged. He and his wife
emoraced each other, and they bo'.h gave
way to icars. The painful situation lasted
only a few minutes, and theu Judge Coot:
discLarged the jury. Judge Cook fixed
the hour of noou as the time for passing
sentence.
At 12 o'clock court convened, and At
torney Phort, for the defense, made a
iormal motion for a new trial, to preserve
his rights Is the event of an appeal. It
was denied, and Judge Cook then ordered
Mr. Sanders to stand up. Coming from
the court, who is regarded as one of the
leading criminal lawyers in the Slate, the
remarks of Judae Cook to the defendant
are very interesting. The eminent jurist
expressed some important views in tne
celebrated case. He spoke as follows :
"Mr. Sanders, the duty of pronouncing
sentence in this case on one of your age
and one of your former standing m the
communiij' and of your reputed educa
tion and knowledge of matters iv general â
ihe position which you have hela in the
past in this .community of recognized
ability â is certainly a painful duty to any
Judge, particularly so to me now. This
case, I believe, cannot find i".s parallel in
history. In my whole experience at the
bar, oi over twenty years, and in ray whole
reading, i cannot recall ever having met
v.-ith or read of a case as strange in all its
details as this one. Certainly, if yon are
not guii;y of the crime w.th wtiich you are
charged, and in connection with fiat
crime of tne murder of William Wootto:) â
becaufee the one really carries ibe oiher
with itâ you are the victim of the most
pecu:iar and terrible chain of circum
stances that any man ever was the vic
tim o .
"Two juries have concluded that you
were guilty. Before one of tliese juries
there was certain evidence offered that
was not admitted on your behalf. That
has been admitted here, but this jury
now, even witn that evidence admitted,
agrees with the tirst jury, and the jurors
are the sole judges as to the facts. What
ever verdict a jury may render as to a fact
settles the fact so far as the court is con
cerned. The court will look only to the
Verdict, and from that verdirt this jury
says that you are iruilty of this forgery,
and being i mlty of the forgery, certainly
William Wootton must nave been dead,
and the jury must have so found. Under
tne rules of iaw a prosecution for the mur
der of William Wootton is rot permitted,
because the corpus delicti could not be
proven, but in re;ility there is the crime
of murder connected with the crime of
which you stand convicted. Also, in evi
dence here tlire lias he-iti evidence rela
tive to several oilier forgeries of deeds, all
of whicn, if you were pro3ecutei for them
(if this one is a forgery they certainly
are), would require a most severe sen
tenceâin fact, to the charge of mur.ier it
unquestionably would be capital punish
ment.
"But I am not permitted in passing
sentence in this case to take into con
sideration other ciimes that may have
been developed here. The evidence as to
those other crimes was admitted not for
the purpose of proving the guilt of those
Crimes, but merely for the purpose of
establishing your guilt of this crime, and
although you may have been guilty ot
murder and of twenty forgeries, you may
not have been convicted of those, and, of
course, they can form no part of this sen
tence.
"It is to me a most perplexing case
throughout, and it hardly seems to me
that any man who has a moral mind
could have thought out or concocted ti.o
schemes and the acts which nave boon
proven here and which the jury have
found you committed. 1 am satisfied in
this case if I should impose less than the
full penalty I would not be performing
my duty.
"The judement of the law and the sen
tence of the court is tha: you, W. A.
Banders, for the crime of forgery, of which
you have been convicted, l>e imprisoned
in the State prison of this State, at San
Quentin, llarin County, Stato of Cali
fornia, for the period of fourteen years.' 1
Professor Sanders did not expect such a
severe sentence â he limit of the law. He
thought that the court would give him
about eight years, deducting the two
years he has been in jail since be was sen
tsneed to ten years' imprisonment when
convicted on his second trial. When seen
at Jhe jail Hr-'A Call correspondent this
a ternoon he appeared very much per
turbed. He was pacing the corridor be
tween the rows of cells in a very im
patient manner. When called to the
grating and asked if he would appeal his
ca^etotlle Supreme Court again he said
he did not think ho would.
"My health is broken down," he con
tinued, "and 1 could not live through
another two years pending an appeal in
tiiis j.iil. I would die in jail anyway and
I had better po to San Quentin, where the
quarters are more comfortable and health
ful. All I wish to say at this time is that
lam innocent and that tne verdict is a
great injustice."
The prisoner then excused himself from
further conversation. In a moment he
returned and said he would write a few
words on the matter "nearest bid heart"
for publication if desired. Upon being
answered in the affirmative he went to his
cell and wrote the following on a slip of
paper, which he handed to the newspaper
man :
The only groat matter of solicitude in my
present overwhelming trouble is that my chil
dren may lead pure, upright, honorable lives
âsuch lives es I have always taught them by
precept and exÃmple. As to myself, no dis
grace or punishment can rob me of my nenseof
innocence and o I my abiding faith iv God and
time anil truth to establish that innocence to
the world. W. JISaXBBM.
It was after the jury entered their room
for deliberation that Judge Cook ordered
Dr. Mclntosh arrested for committinc
perjury. The point on which the court
said the doctor had testified falsely was in
regard to his "discovery" of the fiftieth
stub from which the lorged draft was
torn. This book was found in Sanders'
desk at his ranch snortly after his arrest.
Sheriff Scott and Deputy Peck and mem
bers of the Grand Jury which indicted
the professor counted the blanks carefully
and found only forty-nine, or one less
than mere are usually in such books.
This was an important point for the prose
cution, as it contended that tiie missing
blank was the one on which the forged
draft was written. Dr. Mclntosh had the
book in his hands and after this a stub
was found in the center of the book, mak
ing the fiftieth. Ke knew that the prose
cution was after him, and so to shield
himself i>e volunteered the statement in
court the other day that he had seen that
"hidden stub while a witness was turn
ing the leaves. This was before he was
intrusted with the book.
Mclntosh swore against the record. Be
sides this Judge Cook ventured the opin
ion that Mclntosh inserted the stub, the
book showing indications of having been
altered.
Dr. MclntoÂ«h formerly conducted a
commercial school in Fresno, and beine
well known his summary arrest has
caused quite a sensation.
RAILWAY XO 810 BCG JHIXBS.
Santa Fe Company to Extend a Branch
from I'rtscott.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., April 30.â President
Frank M. Murphy of the Santa Fe, Pres
cott and Phcenix Railway has formally
announced that his company has in view
the construction of a standard-gauge rail
way lrom this point to the Big Bug min
ing district, twenty-rive miles south. This
imporiant announcement is believed to
be sufficient to secure the establishment of
a smelter in this city. This project has
hung fire only through the lack of facili
ties for transporting the rich ores of the
southern mountains.
The district to be tapped is one of the
richest in Arizona, with hundreds ot well
developed mines of gold, silver ana cop
per. The gold ores are mainly found in
refractory form, necessitating smelting or
concentrating. The Southern Pac fie Com
pany has made a survey from Phoenix to
Big Bug, and at one time it had gathered
ai Pii'-r.iix a large amount of material,
ready for beginning construction. The
distance from Phcenix is about eighty
miles.
The Prescott Chamber of Commerce has
taken hoid of Mr. Kelly's proposiiion with
a good deal of energy, and substantial in
ducements will be offered by the business
men of the city to secure the early con
struction of the road.

County.
Drive Leffingwell's Men From
a Train Which They Had
Boarded.
The Idlers Divided Into Squads and
Dispersed In Different
Directions.
WOODLAND, Cat.., April 30.â The In
dustrial Army, beaded by "General" Wil
liam Leffingwell. which struck camp near
Davisville on Wednesday, boarded the
northbound freight train at Davisville
this morning and announced its intention
of riding to this city. The train crew made
an effort to eject the men, but without suc
cess. Special Ofhcer Ahem of Sacramento
was dispatched to the scene. Sheriff
Griflin was notified and immediately sum
moned all his deputies and the local offi
cers to the depot awaiting the arrival of a
special train to carry them to Davisville.
la the meantime Officer Ahem organized
the train crew and constables into a posse.
The Oroville freight train, goinz in the
same direction, was soon due and Detec
tive Ahem did not want to fight for the
possession of both trains. He did not
disturb the Industrials until No. 31 had
had pulled out of the station and was well
on its way to Woodland.
The posse then began operations. A
big fellow, whose name was not given, as
sumed the leadership of Leffing well's
army, and was inclined to be obstinate.
He weighs about 300 pounds, and boasts
of having at oue time been a policeman
in Rhode Island. Officer Ahem took him
by tbe collar and ordered mm to get off
the train. After some hesitation he
obeyed, and the iest was easy. His fol
lowers speedily followed his example.
They lined up along the road, but allowed
the train to pull out without fuither mo
lestation. The army then returned to
camp, and notified the railroad men that
they would board the next train and ride
at all hazards.
A hern came to Woodland on a special,
and returned to Davisvilla with Sheriff
Griffin and his men. They held a parley
with the industrials, and informed them
that they must obey the Jaw. They
would be transported from Davisville by
ttse railroad company to different places
in squad", but could not leave in a body.
Leffingwell and his lieutenant, Cor
bett, were sent to San Francisco. His fol
lowers, left without leaders and fright
ened by the determined stand taken by
the officers, accepted the proposition, and
are now dispersing. They were supplied
with provisions to last until they could be
transported.
For awhile it was feared that the army
would resist and that a serious right be
tween them and the officers would ensue.
Some of the army offered resistance, but
were quickly squelched.
This afternoon Sheriff Griffin, who is on
the spot, held another parley with the men
and read them a lecture, saying they must
leave as urged and unless they did so force
would be used to disband them. Every
train now carries from eight to ten of the
army and many are leaving afoot, going
la different directions. Most of the men
are well dressed and do not look like ordi-
nary tramps, yet a number of convicts,
who are known by the officers, are in the
ranks of the army.

BOWIE STATION, Ariz., April 30.â
One of the most daring feats of mountain
climbing ever undertaken was that which
caused the deatn of Tully Dj Long in the
Chiricahua Mountains last week. He
started to reach the summit of Dos Cabe
zas peak. After two days of searching
his body was found at the bottom of a
gully perhaps a thousand feet below the
peak. He was the 20-year-old son of Hon.
ti. R. D.> Lone, of Tucson.
Even tho Apaches and trained moun
taineers shudder at the thought of under
taking sucii a perilous feat, lor Dos Cabe
zas peat rises almost perpendicular from
the tab c lands. Tne lad must tiave b?en
within a few hundred feet of the summit
when he lost his footing and fell into a
side gully, striking bis bead on the stones.

VICTORIA QUARANTINE RIOT.
Cab n Passengers of the Empress of
China Objsct to Fumigation â Dip
lomatic Negotiaticns.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 30.â When the
Canadian Pacific Railway steamer Em
press of China arrived Tr.es lay and went
into quarantine at William Head because
two cases of smallpox were on board not
much was thought of it, though of course
it was very inconvenient for passengers
having to remain in quarantine for four
teen daysâ for those were the orders of
Dr. Watt, quarantine officer, on account
of smallpox having resulted from allow
ing the Northern Pacific liner Victoria to
go some months ago before her full time
was up.
There are 140 cabin passengers and 600
Chinese aboard, and when the steerage
passengers were tatcen ashore, stripped
and disinfected with a disagreeable smell
ing bath and their clothes taken from
them and baked, it was ail risht. But
when the quarantine officials approached
the cabin passengers yesterday and po
litely said, "Your turn next," there was
wrath and indignation from the knicker
bockered Londoners who protested against
the audacity of the impudent colonials in
daring to offer to bathe a real live Eng
lishman. They even indulged in threats
of resistance, with the result that twenty
rive men armed with Winchesters are now
guarding the station.
Not only this, but there is aboard his
Excellency Cnang, Embassador from
China to represent the Emperor at the
diamond jubilee in LonJon. He is ac
companied by a large suite of gorgeously
attired Chinese, and they, like their
countrymen, do not understand Western
ways, and look with hoiror and disdain
on an attempt to put the Emperor of
China by proxy under fumigation. Hisf
Excellency has refused pointblank to un- '
dergo fumigation, and not only has the
Dominion Government been appealed to,
but Lord Salisbury and the Chinese rep
resentative in London have been wired to.
Chang says he will go back to China
without proceeding to London, though in
that case he is likely to lose his head for
oibobeykig his orders from the Emperor,
and says furthermore tuat if a hand is
laid on him it means trouble between
Great Britain and China, as the person of
an embassador is sacred.
Things are in statu quo at present,
awaiting orders from the Federal authori
ties at Ottawa. Owing to the large num
ber of passengers on the steamer the ac
commodations at the quarantine station
are madrquate, and with so many women
and children the passengers protest that
coming ashore and living in rough sheds
lor several days will be dangerous to their
health. This station :s in process of en
largement to meet such cases, but it will
take a few months to do so.
SPOKANE MONGOL HANGED.
Chin Pan Suffers the Death Penalty for
the Klimg of One of His Coun
trymen.
SPOKANE, Wash., April 30.â Chin Pon
was hanged here to-Uay for the murder of
his partner, Lee Tong, on March 13, 189 d.
Lee Tong and Chin lon were Iriends, be
longing to the same society and living in
adjoining rooms in a Chinese tenement
on First avenue. They quarreled and en
gaged in a fu-ht, in which Lee caressed
Chin's head with an iron bar. Chin was
possessed of a marvelous constitution or
he would have been a dead man. He did
his share of the beating at the time, and
Lee was also laid up in the hospital.
Both served terms in the County Jai!.
On the day of their release they left the
jail separately, but met in t ho tenement
where they roomed. Chi 1 rushed for Lee,
but the latter took refuge in bis room.
He was afraid to venture out for a time,
but finally took courage and left his room
with a bucket to go for same water. Chin
was waiting- tor him and at once attacked
him. He forced Lne back into the room,
beat him unmercifully and then left i.im
for an instant, lie returned shortly with
two hatchets, and with these he attacked
his enemy. Later the Coroner had diffi
culty in getting enough remains together
to hold an inquest on.
BLAME FOR A I'OUILAM) WUECK.
Coroner's Jury Verdict on the Mleetrio-
Car Catastrophe.
PORTLAND. Ob., April 30.â The Cor
oner's inquest over the bodies of those
killed in the East siae streetcar accident
resulted in the following verdict:
"It is our opinion that the axle on said
car was broken ar the reverse curve, a short
distance east of where the said car left the
track, thereby weakening the brakes on
the front truck to such an extent that the
car with the momantum acquired by it
coming down the grade irom ha it Twelfth
street was beyond control."
The consensus of opinion is that this
would not have happened had not the car
been run down the incline at more than
double the speed allowed under the city
ordinance.
'Jlif Uniltoa]/ to Kandsburg,
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. April 3aâ Work
on the railroad irotu Kramer to Rands
burg will commence, probably, by the end
of next week. This wili form the cheapest
bit of railway construction in the State,
as there is little grading to be done, no
rock work and the soil is readily handled.
It is estimated that the entire twenty
seven miles can be built and equipped
with two locomotives, two passenger
conches and six Ireightcars at a total cost
of $87,000, making it ail ready for traffic.
Trams will be operated to tlte camp, it is
thought, by the Ist of August.

REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 30.â The
delegates to the Grand Parlor, Native
Sons of the Golden West, left this oity for
their respective homes on the forenoon

The banquet, which began at 11 o'clock
last night, did not end until an early hour
this morning. Judge John F. Davis, in re
sponding to the toast "Our Flags/ elo
quently described the heroism of Ameri
can sailors in the great Samoan hurricane,
and made special reference to the conduct
of the noble sailors of the Trenton. Toe
audience was somewhat surprised at a
sudden common and great applause in the
band. An explanation followed, when the
fact was disclosed that one of the musi
cians in Roncovieri's band was aboard the
Trenton during the great gale.
Tne delegates aeparted from the city
well satisfied with the work of the ses
sion. No bitter feuda remain to be ad
justed or fought over at the next Grand
Parlor. The contest for grand orator,
which at one time did threaten to engen
der some feeling, was happily settled by
the election of Frank L. Coombs as chair
man of the board of grand trustees, leav
ing no one to oppose Judge Rust,, and th 3
latter was unanimously elected orator.
In electing Mr. Coombs trustee by ac
clamation the Grand Parlor paid a high

Tie Mysterious Echo
Don't ever get weak, for if you do
you may be the victim of the Myste-
rious Echo. . There is a certain class
of men who begin by having ringing
sounds in the ears. This is followed
by peculiar noises in the head, and
then comes the Mysterious Echo.
This echo is unlike the mountain
echo, " for the noise is entirely
changed. Men who have lived lives
of recklessness, of dissipation or of
abuse soon find themselves in a con-
dition of â  weakness that \is indeed
horrible. Besides the noises in the
head, the spots before the eyes, the
steam-like vapor that goes through
; the body, the sweats of night, the
lost unmanly visions, and the first
break of day brings this poor fellow
to his senses. He realizes at last
that having misused himself, he has
wrecked his manhood.
To such men a reliable treatment is
offered by the greatest known doc-
' tors. This treatment cures all those
conditions which ultimately lead to
complete failure of manhood, to -
premature conditions, to impotency.

taken place since the idea of holding these
cjnferences wa<? evolved.
Fresh flowers, and in even greater
abundance than before, rendered the stage
ot Golden Gate Hall a most attractive and
inviting bower yesterday morning when
Mrs. Swift rapped for order. The attend
ance at this time was scarcely what it
should have been, probably due to the
late session of the previous evening. But
this delinquency was well made up for in
the afternoon, when the seatine accommo

exhausted and the aisles were gladly ac

The naornine session's programme was
inaugurated by Mis^ Sarah M. Severance,
who was billedto spÂ«ak ou the subject of
"The Ethical in Education." She said in

We are a congress of our ancestors, who pre
side over our various functions and so demean
themselves that we never know which we are.
One does our laughing, another our spelling,
and they jumble us into all ports of inconsist

versely; it means not to lead out. We may
bring out whichever ancestor we please. We
may repress the unworthy by withholding
largess. We are lords o-f our own lives, not

Ethics is the science of rieht action. It
tells us what we ought to do. Attainments
without ethical guidance may make a scien
tific savage of hu accomplished rascal, but
they will not make a worthy human being, for
ethics is to education what the guiding brain
is to blind forceâ the applying power without
which force becomes a demon of destruction.
Professor Stiilmin followed Miss Sever
ance with a paper on "Personal Hygiene."
This, he said, was a department of knowl
edge that relates to ttie improvement of
the health of the individual. In his
opinion, health is the condition of a hu
man body which is sound ana Rble to re
alize the best and fullest life possible.
Life, said he, is more tban mere animal
existence, and per:-otÂ»al hygiene is con
cerned with the physical basis of life, be
cause the integrity ami health ot mind
anil morals and ethics depends upon the
physical organic conditions. The human
body iÂ« the most delicate mechanism ever
created and it has the capacity for the
storage and expression of energy, which
in its highest form we see in thought and
action. It is tne duty of every person to
understand the nature and laws ol the
human body, so that health may be at
tained and conserved and the power of
life n*ed to greatest advautage.' 1
Thisconcuded the morning programme,
but by special request a paper written by
Miss Jane M. Slocum of tne Niesor Acad
emy, Idaho, on the "Place of Social
Economics in Education" was read by
Mrs. J. H. Dickinson. In substance it
was as follows:
In considering the place of social economics
in education, terms musi be used in tueir
broadest sense. Strictly speaking we under
stand by education the drawing out or develop
ing of the mental powers; and in our primary
and secondary schools studies are selected
50 el? with this end in view while the College
curriculum is determined much in the same
way. The famous o.d university oi Bologna
still delights to honor the memory of a large
and eminent clnss of women professors who
ranked with the scholars of tne seventeenth
century, and lectured not only on art, litera
ture and philosophy, but also on anatomy and
jurisprudence, when all the world sought
this ancient seat of learning for its pre-emi

Rev. C. W. Wendte opened the after
noon session with a most instructive art
dress on "Education and Morality; or, Do
people crow better as they know more?"
Mr. Wendte said it was commonly as
sumed by liberal-minded persons that to
make men intelligent w?s to make them
better and happier. Therefore, to make a
community moral you must educate it.
Erery dollar spent on schools, colleges
and libraries saves a much larger amount
in the administration of criminal juris
prudence and reformatory institutions.
Yet, there sometimes arises the doubt
whether this increasÂ« of popular educa
tion brings with it a corresponding im
provement in the public morality. The
greatest and most dangerous ropues now
adays are the well-educated rogues.
'â¢The American idea of puolic instruc
tion is sirnplv this, that all young per
sons â prospective citizens â shall have pro
vided for them by public tax instruction
in the common branches of reading, writ
ing land arithmetic," said Dr. Wendte.
"They are meanwhile not to be with
drawn from the care of the.rown families,
their religious te.".chers or any other help
ful influences which may aid in putting
other important elements of education
within their reach. AH extensions of this
elementary instruction, all ornamental,
historical, scientific or philosophical
studies taught in our public schools are
only so many expressions of public be
nevoience toward the children in the
community."
Professor A. G. Newcomer of Stanford
University opened up a new subject, he
being assigned to the next place on the
programme. His theme was "Books and
Words." He said in part:
It is the duty of the scholar to play
the part of the conservative after playing
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1897.
that of the radical. By virtue of the trans
mission of knowledge through books we
are spared the costly road of ex per c nee.
Therefore the selection of that knowledgeâ
that Is, the books which are the means of that
transmissionâ is of paramount importance.
In the words of Tennyson, "Let knowledge
grow from more to more," It cannot grow
too much. It is a stupendous proposition to
begin with. We begin with the knowledge of
the world beneath our feet, Â»nd must absorb
It. It is not the knowledge of one generation
but the generations of the world ever since
we have known it. In books we live for
higher and higher efforts.
Mme. Moantford of Jerusalem was next
introduced. She said she would speak to
the congress as an Oriental, and as such
would boldly say that no nation can ever
rise above the level of its women and live.
Woman has not had her proper place in
the world, and that, she said, was why
many nations fail.
"Why," asked the lady, "are Turkey
and Greece righting now? Why are they
butchering each other? I can tell you:
It is because our Oriental men cannot
rise above the level of their women. The
Turkish mother when she is nursing her
child calls its attention to the passing
Christian, and tells it â she instills into
itâ that it must hate thai Christian. It
must hate him because he believes in
three gods â hate him as a common enemy.
Then the so-called Christian mother of
the Kast is even worse in this regard than
the Turkish mother. She whispers to her
childâ forgetting the vital teachings of
her own creed â that he must hate that
Turk because he believes in a false
prophet."
Mme. Mountford's remarks made a deep
impression, and the applause that fol
lowed her closing sentence continued for
several minutes.
Rev. Charles L. Miel of Sacramento
read a paper on "Ethical Teaching in the
Public Schools." The reverend gentle
man said society was made up of three
important component parts â family, na
tion and church.
Education and relierion, he said, could
not be divorced any more than this trin
ity could be divided. Education's hymn
is "Nearer, My God, to Thee." The
Christian church is the founder of the
public schools of the United States.
Moral training is the crowning effort to
be achieved in education. There is not
enough ot this in the public schools of
to-dny. A study of geometry will not
make a "square" man; neither will geog
raphy ieach him where to go with safety
through this life. The speaker put him
self on record as being emphatically op
posed to the exclusion of religious train
ing in the public schools. It was one of
the greatest blunders, he said, the state
could have made.
The separation of church and state, he
said, does not mean the separation of
state ana God. The present system in
the schools was practically the teaching
of atheism, he declared. The tittle tinct
ure of religion and ideas of God-loving
that the child received at the Sunday
schools, which could be attended but once
a week, was a proposition to be compared
only to the pourine of a thimbleful of
whisky into Lake Superior and then in
viting the whole world to come and drink
and be merry.
A lady in the gallery aroused great en-
thusiasm by announcing that in her opin
ion the place for ithe religious education
of the child was at home.
C. H. Rieber, the next programme
spenker, had for his subject, "The Place
of Punishment in Moral Education." But
beore going into that matter Mr. Rieber
could not resist the temptation to take a
shy at Rev. Mr. Miol. He said he stood as
a representative product of the public
schools of California. He began in the
primary and finished in the university.
He was therefore in a position, he said, to
denounce as false the statement that re
lipious and moral training was a stranger
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE PURE-FOOD CONVENTION.
in those schools, as well as the one that
the Bible was excluded from our text
books. Mr. Rieber then took up his own
theme.
In the bringing up of a child, he said,
the parent should not resort to violence
and pasÂ«ion when the young one has
erred. The power of good over evil, he
said, was most potent. The Daman being
18 drawn to virtue, not driven. His ad
vice was to plant beside every bad habit a
correspondingly good habit and victory
was certain.
The congress proper will come to a close
this afternoon, thera being no mornini;
BÂ»ssi n n. A splendid programme has been
prepared and there will doubtless be an
immense attendance.

Adulterations of Fooi.
The Pure Food Congress at Pioneer
Hall yesterday was largely attended and
many able papers were read on various
phases of the subject.
There was much vim and determination
among the country delegates, who were a
unit in favor of stringent measures against
dealers who adulterated and sell adulter
ated foods.
President J. W. Kerr of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association made
a atirring opening address. He urged
united action between producer* for the
common object of securing pure food and
suggested that it would require thorough
organization to overcome the stubborn
opposition of shopkeepers who are not
honest.
Among other things the speaker said:
California can meet hones: competition,
but we cannot fight the producers oi spurious
goods, of convict-made wares and of danger
ous adulterations. But when our enemies
without, aided by traitors within, pour within
our borders goods which never paid the price
of honest toilâ prison products which they
dare not market in the States in which they
are made; when our lood-producers and food
growers are asked to compete with jellies in
which the juice of the fruit lorms no part
honeys which contain but 5 per cent of the
pure article; when merchant*, honorable aad
abovo reproach, complain that to such an ex
tent have these curious and In many in
stances poisonous products been forced upon
an unsuspicious people that they have been
compelled to carry them in stock or go out of
businessâ then we feel justified in invoking
the strong arm of the law â then we felt it was
our duty to call you from the quiet of your
comfortable homes that you might aid us in
this battle against a species of commercial
piracy whic'i was driving out our people trom
factory and from (arm, which was threatening
with a blight those homes which you have
left, and threatening the pro s perity oi our
people and encouraging the survival oi the
most unscrupulous.
Professor John Swett made an ex
temporaneous address that plea-ed the
audience. He said be had found groat iin-
purities existing in millc and other fooa
products, deleterious ingredients that
tend to kill infants and shorten the livea
of adults.
In the afternoon Dr. William Simpson
read a valuable paper on the milk ques
tion. Among other things ho said:
I submit that in view of this appalling death
record from consumption we are justified in
using the most stringent measures to prevent
the sale and use of tuberculous milk or tuber
culous meat What are we doing:? Let me
speak for Santa Clara County. In March,
1896, our most efficient veterinary in&pp^'or.
Dr. H. A. Spencer, began this work, testing
thirty-live cows, of whlcu six were cuuduiiniL-J.
Since that time he has tested 40i>8, comiemneu

and ajtopsied 558. or 13Ji per cent. Every
one, with possibly two exceptions, were shown
by the autopsies to be tuberculous. In about
three mon ths more the whole of the 7000 head
of cattle in Santa Clara County will have been
inspected officially. Now what is the result
irom a sanitary and monetary standpoint?
At a low estimnte 450 of these cows gave three
gallons of milk per day, and by their destruc
tion the consumption of 1350 gallons of dis
eused milk daily has been stopped. In addi
tion to th;s constant inspections as to other
adulterations are carefully made, and dairies
and barns inspected and no means left untried
to enforce the proper feediug, housing and
handling of cattle.
Dr. J. C. Spencer, City Bacteriologist,
followed with an address on "Milk." He
said the average milk, while full of mi
crobes, is not so badly infested with ma
lignant germs as some people imagine.
He advocated the pasteurization of milk
at public stations by submitting it to a
temperature of about 180 degrees Fahren
heit.
Ellwood Coopor of Santa Barbara deliv
ered an interesting address on the adul
teration of olive oil, showing that it is
tampered with more than anything ex
cept vinegar. "Less than 34 per cent of
what is sold is pure," he said, "being
made of cottolene, Jard, cotton-seed oil
and other like deleterious ingredients of
an indigestible and even dangerous char
acter." He concluded by eaying that the
man who brands adulterations as Califor
nia-made gooiis is a traitor to the State.
B. M. LeJong of the State Board of
Horticulture made even more startling
statements about olive oil. He said:
Out of forty brands of olive oil which I ex
ninined a few years ago in this market, I
found but three pure samples, ana most of
the brands had less than 3 per cent of olive
oil. 1 found 117 samples labeled, "California
olive oil," and there was no olive oil in any
of them. A doctor toid me he believed that
more thmi 300 persons had been killed by
adulterated oil containing sulphuric acid and
cotton-seed oil. Even the imported oils are
often bad, and the oils here are often sold at
less i h in the cy.it of production ot the genuine
article.
State Chemist W. B. Rising of Berkeley
read an interesting paper, wherein he
held that it is the duty of the Stale to pro
tect the people against the adulteration of
food. He said:
Adulterations destroy legitimate business
and undermine the health of tne people. We
jire a food-producing S'.ate, and nought to te
the ambitiou of every loyal Californian to see
that the quality of our product is as good as
Its variety and quantity, otherwise millions of
dollars in damage will t>e done to tne State by
the producers oi spurious goods. Butter, olive
oil and other staple products have earned
their standing and name through long years
of service, and the man who counterfeits them
ought to suffer.
A. Sbarboro delivered aa address on
wines which was heard witn marked at
tention. Among other things he said:
On account of the abundance of our juicy
grapes, wine is rarely adulterated in Califor
nia, but our great competitors are the five
story vineyards in the city of New York,
where it is well known that large quantities
of wine are manufactured without a drojrof
the juice of the grape, and what is worse still,
while our California wines are sold under
French labels, the spurious articles artifi
cially produced are labeled California wines.
This fraud must be stopped, and I would
therefore offer the following resolution for
the consideration of the committee on resolu
tions:
"Resolved, That our representatives in Con
gre>s be requested to use all honest means to
have passed by Congress a pure food law, in
cluding in the same the prohibition of adul
teration or sophistication of wines."
Let the officers oi the Board of Health con
tinue their meritorious work, and then we may
ayain sit ut lable with our families and enjoy,
the blessing of a good meal, made entirely of
pure food, which blessing will be due to the
model Board of Health of San Francisco, to
whom is due our most grateful thanks.
Professor Emory E. Smith of Stanford
read an able paper on "Pure Food Educa
tion," saying in part:
Educational tffort must be made chiefly In
two directions, nmmercial for more immedi
ate results and scholastic tor ultimate success.
Commercial conscience is largely a matter
oi competition, environment and trade cus
tom, and can only be successfully dealt with
by law and public sentiment.
The enactment of laws affecting commerce
which are to be rigidly enforced are demoral
izing in their tendency.
Good laws, actively enforced, even cannot
stamp out the evil, so lotig as dishonestly dis
posed persons are supported in their evasions
by public sentiment. :
No spasmodic agitation regarding the pur
ity of any special food or class of foods will
j prove sufficient; the question must be handled
on broad lines, and in the most systematic
manner.
The night session was taken up alto
petber with a discussion of the report of
the committee on resolutions. After
much discussion the following was
adopted, being the result of many amend
ments:
Whereas. The adulteration of food products
in the United States has become io general
and of such an alarming character as to serl
ously imperil the health and lives of the peo
ple of thi< country; and whereas, after care

to correct ihis abuse without some general

Manufacturers' and Producers' Association of
California ha? called a Pure Food Congress for
the purpose of discussing this evil and seeicing
a remedy, one that shall not injure or destroy
the domestic industries of this country, and at
the same time to prevent the manufacture
and sale ot adultera'ed foods; and whereas,
we recognize the importance of conservative,
deliberate and concerted action, and recog
nize also that this is more than n. State ques
tion, being one of National importance, we
place ourselves on record as favoring all State
and Federal laws governing the manufacture
and sale of all food products which shall make
the label of any product a contract between
the manufacturer and consumer, the essence
of said contract being a recital of all the in
gredients making up the contents of the pack
age. We are also in favor of a rigid penalty
for any and all misrepresentation with refer
ence to the quality of manufactured goods. It
is therefore
Resolved, By this congress assembled : First â
We declare that, the purpose of the Pure Food
Congress is to devise means whereby the gen
eral public may be educated as to the impor
tance of Dure foods. Secondâ We adopt as a
definition ol adulteration the language of the
stiitute of California, approved March. 20,
1895, which is as follows:
Any article shall be deemed to be adulterated
within the meauing of this act:
(a) In the case or drugs: (1) If. when sold under
or by a name recognized In the "United States Phar
macopoeia," It differs from the standard of strength,
quality or purity laid dow.i therein. (2) If, when
sold under or by a name not recognized In the
â¢'United States Pharmacopoeia," but whicn is
found in some other pharmacot oei* or other stan
dard worn on materia medica, it differs materially
from the standard of strength, quality or purity laid
down In such work. (3) If its strength, quality or
purity falls below the professed standard under
which It is sold.
(6) In the case of food: (1) If any substance or
substanres have been mixed with it, so as to
lower or depreciate, or injuriously affect Its qual
ity, strength or purity. (?) If any Inferior or
cheaper substance or substances have been sub
siituiea wholly or in part for It. (3) If any valu
able or necessary constituent or ingredient has
been wholly or In part abstracted from it. (4) If
it Is an imitation of, or is sold under the. name of,
another article, (b) If it consists wholly, or In
part, of a diseased, dÂ« composed, putrid, Intected,
calmed or rotten animal or vegetable substance or
article, whether manufactured or i.ot: or in the
case of milk, if it is the produce of a uiseased ani
mal. (6) If It is coloreu. coa.ed, polished or pow
dered, whereby damage or inferiority is concealed,
or if by auy nv'a'is it is nude to appear beiier or
of greater va ue than it really is. ('.) If it cou
:ains any added substance or Ingredient whica is
poisonous or injurious to health.
Thirdâ That to make this congress effective
your committee recommends that a plan for
permanent organization be adopted, which
organization shall have a central head in San
Fmnci&co, with branches at all principal
points throughout the State, the object of
which shall be to provide methods for tne pre
vention of traffic in adulterated food products
and to develop the Dublic' sentiment through
out tho country which will result in a National
pure-food law.

Merry picnics for everybody.

The woman question of the time is how

Tho Greeks have swapped horses while

Leave orders for The Sunday Call, and

The new Prime Minister of Greece has
the significant name "Raili," and if all
the Greeks will rally tiiey may triumph

It now looks as if the tariff bill would
be set up for every Senator to take a shot
at, and we are evidently in for a summer
siege.
The "congress woman has become a
feature of our social life hardly less con
spicuous than the "matinee girl" and is
almost as attractive.
There is a possibility tnat the storm cen
ter of European discord may be shifted
from Greece to South Africa almost before

There is no reason at all why any
adulterated fruit food should be sold in

best fruit in the world going to waste

It is all well enough to call Kaiser Wil

The Valley road is carrying prosperity
to the interior counties, and the work on
the coast road promises equal benefits to

The Greek invasion of Epirus has be
come a mere side issue in the war. It
might have been made a great thine, but
Bomehow it went awry and there is very

Now that the Senatorial fight is over

Rhode Island has decided to increase

her Supreme Court from five to six; but
where in the State there will be found
room enough to put the extra seat is not

It is said that Senator Jones of Nevada
hoids the balance of power in the Senate
Finance Committee, and, as he stands in
for thorough protection on lead, wool,
hides and citrus fruits, the West seems to
be in luck.
The vehemence with which Mr. Har
court of England denounces Mr. Chamber
lain of England for laying plans to gobble
the Transvaal may be taken as a measure
of Harcourt's longing to be in Chamber
lain's place.
There is an opinion in this country that
England should save Crete, and there is
an opinion in England that we should
<aye Cuba. There are also opinions on
these subjects in Crete and Cuba, but it is
hardly necessary to describe them.
The appearance of the army worm

The till passed by the Legislature of
British Columbia, excluding American
citizens from taking up mining claims in
that country, will hurt their mining in
terests more than it will us. It enables
British Columbia, however, to boast of a
fool Legislature that beats Kansas.
The action of the Grand .Parlor of Native
Fons in indorsing the movement of the
Grand Army of the Republic toward the
erection of a monument to Lincoln in this
City was eracefully and patriotically
taken. The movement i ** one in which
the Native Sons can well afford to co-oper
ate, and it will be an honor for them to be
associated in the enterprise with the
veterans.
A friend of the late B;i!y Birch, the
negro minstrel, quotes him as saying that
he once ?pent a month with a relative in
the country, and gleaned there more ma
terial for j;ood jokes than at any other
ptaea in his life. It is to be regretted that
the particular spot in the country was not
named. There are quite a number of
prominent jokers in these days to
whom the puolic would pladly recommend
h? place iov a summer vacation.
THE PURE FOOD CONGRESS.
The proceedings of the first day of the Pure Food Congress have strengthened the
public expectation of good results. The assembly is composed or men of more than
ordinary weight and influence throughout the State, and all the speeches and pro
ceedings gave evidence of an earnest desire toward the accomplishment of something
which would tend to check the adulteration of foods in the State, even if it did not
succeed in preventing the practice altogether.
There can be no question of the importanco of the issue. It affects our people
both as regards the consumer of food and the producer of pure articles. We are con
cerned in it on account of business as well as health, and wo may expect benefit from
it to our trade as well as to our homes. Both of these aspects of the question are well
understood by members of the congress, and accordingly we may expect action from
j it which will result in benefits to both.
There is no reason at all why there should be any kind of adulterated food prod
ucts either sold in this State or manufactured here. California produces everything
in the way of food which is needed by her people, either for the sustenance of life or
for tne pleasing of the palate. We have the necessaries and the luxuries of food in
the greatest abundance. We raise them in quantities far exceeding the local demand,
and to introduce adulterations among us is to do a wrong to ourselves in spiteof the
bounties which nature has provided for us.
The importance of pure food to the health of the community and the risht of a
consumer to obtain that for which he pays are matters so plain that they need no ar
guments to sustain them nor any urgiuc to make them recognized by the people.
The trade question, however, is not so widely comprehended. President Sonntag
made the point clearly in the statement: 'The amount of adulterated food that has
been sent to the State of California is appalling. It is a sorrowful picture and abso
lutely astounding to see the fruits of our beautiful valley dumped into the bay of San
Francisco, while the importation and sale of adulterated foods continue."
Our consular reports abound with notices of tne fact that our trade with Europe
Is largely interfered with by the practice ot unscrupulous dealers in sending to that
country foods which are either not pure or else are not up to the standard of their
labels. We have ample experience, therefore, to teach us that the best profits
in the markets of the worlu are to be obtained by pure foods rather than by adultera
tions, in thi?, as in everything else, homsty is the be-i policy. If we can make it
known to the world that all food products put up in California are pure and that the
packages contain exactly wbat is on the label we can easily secure a trade which will
afford a good market for every pound of genuine food produced in the State. With
snch a trade there wilt be no reason why any of our fruits should be left to waste in
the field or be thrown in the bay. We would have the confidence of the world, and,
having that, would easily secure the world's best trade.
TEE TARIIT BILL.
According to reports from Washington
the hope of an early enactment of the
tariff bill is rapidly fading away. The
more the question is discussed tho greater
are the differences of opinion developed
and the more diflicult does it appear to
harmonize the conflicting interests that
are wrangling over the rates of duties to
be adopted. It is now believed, moreover,
that the Democrats will change from their
policy of acquiescence in whatever the
Republicans may devise and will make a
fight against the bill sufliciently pro
longed to postpone its adoption until late
in the summer.
Tne controversy at present is directed
to the question whether the bill as pre
pared by the Republican members of the
Finance Committee shall be reported
directly to the Senate for discussion or
shall first be submitted to the full com
mittee, there to undergo consideration by
the Democratic members. In this contro
versy the committee is equally divided
between Republicans and Democrats, with
Senator Jones of Nevada holding the bal
ance of power. It will be for him to decide
whether or no the bill is to be reported at
once or held in committee for some weeks
to come.
The fact that the balance of power is in
the hands of the Nevada Senator is en
couraging to Western interests, and par
ticularly to those of Calfornia. It is
stated on what seems to be good authority
that the Senator will seek for higher du
ties on borax, wool, lead and citrus fruits
and will also support the Western Sena
tors in their movement to obtain a.dnty
on hides. Furthermore he is reported to
favor a rebate on tin for export, which
will be a benefit to all the canning indus
tries of the coast and a matter of no small
importance to our trade.
It is not easy to estimate the true value
of these various reports. The Senators of
course are not giving out definite state
ments as to their final action, for they are
well aware that compromises will have to
be made all around in order to frame a
bill which will be satisfactory to a major
ity of the Senate. It is well known that
under tho best circumstances the majority
to be hoped for must be necessarily small,
ana therefore astwoor three men have it
in their power to defeat tho bill, or at
least to greatly postpone its adoption, it is
impossible for anyoody to foresee clearly
the exact shape which the measure will
take in its completed form.
Such reports as are sent out are conflict
ing in many importantrespeets. The best
feature of the situation is tuat with every
day's delay there is an improved prospect
of better terms for Western interests, and
we therefore can wait the slow delibera
tions of the Senate without undue impa
tience.
THE TEANSVAAL QUESTION.
The annual budget of the British Gov
ernment, submitted to the Commons on
Thursday by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, shows that
the previous year has been one of national
prosperity for Great Britain and that the
revenues have yielded a surplus of over
$12,000,000, besides reducing the national
debt by over $35,000, 00' J. The debate
which followed the report, however, was
not encouraging for the coming year, in
asmuch as it turned upon the fact that the
Government has set aside about $1,000,000
for strengthening the military forces in
South Africa, thus givin? evidences of
danger of war in that direction.
The item of the budget providing for
the South African military expenditures
was attacked by Sir William Harconrt,
leadei of the opposition, who complained
that these expenditure? were entirely un
necessary and were calculated to bring
about a race war, tnua leading to heavy
and costly expenditures later on. The
reply made by Mr. Chamberlain was
tnat the Transvaal Government has
spent millions in strengthening its
armaments, and that prompt action on
the part of Great Britain in providing for
stronger military and naval power in
South Africa was really "conciliatory,"
inaimnch as it would help to maintain
the peace by impressing upon the Boers
the folly of undertaking any war with
the British or disputing their "paramount
authority."
If the issue at 'stake were no more than
a controversy between Great Britain ana
the Transvaal the danger of war would be
so slight it would hardly occasion com
ment. It happens, however, that other
powers are interested in the situation.
Germany, France and Portugal are by no
means willine that England should be
come paramount in Africa and have been
watching with considerable jealousy the
extension of ber colonies end her en-
croachments in every part of the conti
nent. These powers are very likely to
side with the Transvaal and give assist
ance to the Boers in maintaining their in
dependence and defying the sovereignty
of the British. It is this consideration
which pives importance to the situation
and makes the debate in tbe Commons a
matter of interest throughout the world.
* It bardlv seems possible that the British
Government will undertake anything like
a jingo policy in South Africa at this
time. The expansive power of the British

PREMIER RALLI.
Greece has swapped horses while cross
ing the stream, and if Abra'iam Lincoln
was right in his philosophy she has ven
tured upon a dangerous experiment in do
ing so. She has made evident to her ene
mies that her people are divided and that
her Government does not have their full
and united suprort. Even if we assume,
therefore, that the new Cabinet is to be in
every respect superior to the former, the
change made at this time can hardly be re
garded as favorable to the Greek cause.
The overthrow of the Delyannis admin
istration was clearly caused by t!iedisas
ters to the Greek army on the frontier.
The Prime Minister has been held respon
sible by the populace for tvils which were
in all probability not of his causing. It is
certain that he did not bring on the wnr,
since the clamors of the Greek people
forced his hand in that respect and com
pelled him to go forward. As & matter of
fact the Greek irregulars were crossing the
frontier in every direction and fighting the
Turk in spite of all the Governmentcould
do to restrain them. In turning against
the administration, therefore, as soon as
disasters occurred the Greeks have shown
a desire to shift responsibility upon others
instead of bearing it themselves, and this
is a sign of anything rather than of that
resolution which is necessary on the part
of a weak peopie when making war against
a stronc one.
The new Premier enters upon office
with a Boorish of oratory in striking vio
lation of the maxim, "Let not him that
buckleth on ins armor boast himself as he
that putteth it off." It is fair to presume
that the bold tone taken by Ralli was in
tended largely to have its eftect upon the
Greek population, and he probably spoke
more bravely than he felt for the purpose
of rousing and encouraging the people.
This consideration saves him from the
danger of being reputed something of a
braggart, and the world will wait to see
how neir he can come to fulfilling his
manifesto before it condemns him for
taking part in overthrowing the former
adminisirntion instead of giving it sup
port in the hour of need and at a time
whf-n all Greeks should have stood to
gether in resistance to the invader.
As a represemative of what is known
in Greece as Neo-HeHenism, Ralli is
?aid to be the popular idol of Athens, and
the confidence they have in him may go
far toward encouraging them in the war
with the Turk. There can be no question
of the influence of personal leadership at
critical periods in the history of nations,
and if the new Premier can arouse a new
ardor among the people Greece may yet
show that there are exceptions to Mr.
Lincoln's rule, and that it is advisable at
times to swap horses in crossing a stream,
even when the stream is most turbulent
and the danger is greate-t.

CULTIVATION OF bUGAR BEETS
Minneapolis Tribune.
The great desideratum in sugar beet culture
Is to produce beets of exceeding sweetness.
This requires a careful selection of seed. The
agricultural department at Washington has
some seed which is said to be wortn iv weight
in gold, because it produces a beet yielding a
ltrne percentage of saccharine matter. This
seed is being distributed with great <arÂ» to
persons who will make good uÂ»o 01 it. The
sweetest beeis from :he experimental crops
are to be selected for producing more seed,
und thus in time, perfection in quality may be
attained. It will be impossible for farmer's to
rush into extensive culture of sugar beets all
atonce, but the sooner they make a move in
that direction the sooner will this country be
producing sufficient sugar for its own con
sumption,

Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest.
Is San Francisco Defenseless?
To the Editor oftheSan Francisco Callâ Sir: In view of possible naval war with England or
Japan, the writer desires to sound the note of warning to the pub ie, so that theyâ through
the War Departmentâ may be awakened to the fact that while the front door (the Golden
Gate) may be sufficiently fortified, the back door to the City of San Francisco is wide ODen and
entirely undefended.
A sufficient fleet of ironclads and transports could seize and indefinitely hold Drakes Bay
or Santa Cruz as a base from â which to operate against us in the rear.
Now, to make the above more pain, let us illustrate with a hypothetical case: War is
suddenly precipitated, say with England. Within twenty days a fleet could easily land 5000
men with tipkl artillery, cavalry and infr.ntry with necessary equipment for a march on our
rear from llalfim-o:i I!av, only seventeen miles distant.
Within fony-eipht hours thereafter we should be looking into the muzzles of their guns
on Twin Peaks and Bernal Heights.
Tnis force would liavo a perfectly safe base in their fleet. ThuÃ would our defenses at
GoUleu Gate be successfully turned, and proud San Francisco, with all her wealth, including
big guns in th. : lorulicctions at the entrance to Golden Gate, have fallen, the handful of
troops at the Presidio having previously taken to the woods lor safely.
The question, it ttiis be true, arises, What is needed in the way of supplementary defenses
to those already in use? First, batteries of heavy ordnance at the above indicated points;
next, a permanent increase of the army at the Pfesilio; but, mainly, an immediate increase
in our naval force, as that alone could prevent the ianding ou our shores of a hostile force
by an enemy. Further, that force .-hould b9 stationed at or very near San Francisco.
This i< no fancy picture. The writer is a practical seaman and has had experience in land
ing heavy freigh: at .Mexican and Central American ports, where there is less shelter and more
obstacles than at Halimoon Buy. He has also served in the uavy in time of war.
San Francisco, April 30, 1897. SHELLBACK.
THE MILITIA AS HEAVY ARTILLEY.
During the past year nn interesting experiment has been in progress, having for its object
the training of a part of the militia in sea-coast artillery work, with a view to utilizing them
for the defense of our harbors in case of an emergency. In this, as in the Naval Militia, Mas
sachusetts was the pioneer. In January, 1800, the First Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer
Militia was designed to heavy-artillery duty ia connection with the regular troops serving at
Fort Warren, in Boston harbor.
As a preliminary, lour evnings in the early spring were devoted to the instruction ol t h
officers In their new duties, Lieutenant Weaver of the Second United Slates Artillery giving a
course of lectures covering the duties, organization and equipment of sea-coast artillery. In
one corner of the armory a full-sized model ot the 8-inch gun was built, and on the floor was
traced a miniature harbor, over which moved a ship constructed to the proper scale. With
these and a few other simple arrangements not only were the drill exercises of the piece
taurht, but the most necessary features of target practice, such as vessel- tracking and the lay
ing of guns, were i.lustrated practically.
The vnlu-* of this CRrcful preliminary work was shown in the following August, when the
regiment went Into camp at Fort Warren, where actual drills and target-practice were under
taken in co-operation with the regular garrison. At certain times the alarm was sounded, aud
the entire garrison, both regular and militia, took posis at the guns previously assigned them,
precisely as would be done in case of an actual attack by a naval force. The ammunition ser
vice was carefully organized and practice had in dismounting and mounting heavy guns.
Practice was also had in the use of blocks and the varions tackles, in cordage, knots, etc.
Camp was thus given up almost entirely to the practical application of what was previously
learned at the armory.
The proficiency thus acquired by the citizen-soldiery, even in this short period of instruc
tion is said to have been surprising. Lieutenant Weaver in his report states that these com
bined exercises have proved conclusively not only that it is possible to obtain a body of citizens
having Â«v interest in coast-defense work, but that such men can be trained in a comparatively
short time to become fairly etticient heavy-artillery men.
FIGHTING FOREVER

The world isn't through with fighting yet,
an.l wo don't see any sign of the end of man

since 18D0.
Since then we have had the war between
Italy and Abyssinia, which brought disaster
to the expeditionary army under General Bar
atieri, a ! id ended in a remarkable triumph for
King Menelek.
We have htul the great war between Chtna
and Japan, in which powerful armies and
navies fought sanguinary battles upon land
and sea, tho consequences of which were the
humiliation oi ( hints, tha loss of a part of her
territory, and ihe payment of an indemnity to
her conqueror.
We htive had the civil war in Brazil, which
ensued upon the overthrow of the empire, and
through which the new Government was
shaken for two Tear?, but which ended in the
success of the constitutional republic.
We have had the war ot France upon Mada

year of war in the Philippine*. The Spaniards
say they have crushed the Philippine insur
rection, but Cuba is yet in arms for liberty.
We have had small civil wars in five or six
of the fSpanisli-Aint ricHn republics, the most
important onfi of which was that in Ecuador,
whiCh ended in the victory of the revolution
ary party. Tne re is a fight now going on in
Uruguay, and there i.s v squabble in Hon
duras.
We had carnage upon a vast scale in Ar
menia last year, but that could not be culled
war. The Kurds and Turks met littlo resist
ance during the period in which they were
engaged in slaughtering the terrorized Chris
tians.
N>.wwehave the portentous war between
Turkey and Greece, about the results or the
consequences of which there may well be ap
prehension.
We also have the English military expedi
tion up the Nile, which lias not yetb.-en the
occasion of much lighting, but wnich may be
the occasion of a pretty hot war before Eug
landptelsto Khartoum.
As fur the belligerent affairs oi an unimpor
tant character, in many countries, during this
decade, we could not count them. The largest
oi them was perhaps the Mohammedan revolt
in nortnwestern Cnina. France has had trouble
in Siam; Japan has had some fighting in For
mosa; Zunzibir was the scene of a rumpus;
Spain tnreat'-ned Morocco; England captured
the negro King of Ashan.e-'and grabbed his
country ; tnere was a flÂ»;ht last year between a
mob of Eugiisn rilibusters and the galiant
Boers of the Transvaa'.
There has been clanger that a number of
the wars here spoken of would be the cause of
oilier and yet longer wars. Russia, France
and Germany came very near quarreling with
England at tho end of the struggle between
Japan and China. There was danger of
trouble batween this country and England
when the- English invaded the territory of
Venezuela. The Turko-Greciau war is a peril
to the peace of Europe.
Truly, the years of the last decade of the
nineteenth century have been bloody years.
Mankind are still lighting as they fought in
the day 3 when Amalek and Joshua went to
war, when Alexander fell upon the world,
when Crusnder and Moslem met in conflict,
when Napoleon strove for the earth, when
Unionist and Confederate engaged in battle.
There are alarming possibilities in the situ
ation. We are told that Russia does not want
to fight, and that England, France, Germany,
Austria nnd Italy do not. But there stand the
armies, 6,000,000 or 8,000,000 strong, watch
ing each other with jealous eye, and the hour
ot provocation for them may come with me
firing of a shot. Then again, and above ail,
history and circumstance are governed by
forces the action of which is beyond the con
trol of any individual, lorces which revel in
war despite all the preachings of peace, those
forces which in ancrent times went by the
name of Destiny, which are Known to the
Turks as Kismet, and which the Calvinists
speak of as Predestination.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Laughâ L. 8., City. The poem commencing,
"Laugh and the world laugh? with you," 19
from "Solitude," by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and
His to be found in her "Poems of Passion."
The verse in which it occurs is as follows:
Laugh and the world laughs with yon:
W eep and you weep alone,
For the Had old earth must borrow its mirth,
But lias troubles enough of its own. - .
Sine and the hills will answer; r
sigh and it is lost on the air.
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,
But shrink from sorrow's care.
To Apply for a Patentâ U. S., Decoto, Ala
meda County. Application for a patent in the
United States must be made in writing to the
Commissioner of Patents at Washington, I). C.
Such is generally made through an attorney.
The applicant must file in the Patent Office a
written description of the same and of the
! manner and process of making, constructing,
: compounding and using of it, in such full,
clear, conciso and exact terms as to enable any
person skilled in the art or science to which it
appertains or with which it Is most nearly
connected to make, construct, compound and
use the same; ana incase of a machine he
must explain the principle thereof and the
best move in which he has contemplated ap-
Dlying that principle, so as to distinguish ii
from other inventions, and particularly point
out and distinctly claim the part, improve
ment or combination which he claims as his
invention or discovery. The specification and
claim must be signed by the inventor and at
tested by two witnesses.
When the nature of the case admits of draw
i ings, the applicant must furnish a drawing of
the required size, signed by the Inventor or
his attorney in fact, and attested by two wit
nesses, to be filed in the Patent Office. In all
cases which admit of representation by model,
the applicant, if required by the Commissioner,
â hall furnish a model of convenient size to
exhibit advantageously the several parts of
his invention or discovery.
The applicant shall make oath that he verily
believes himself to be the original and first
Inventor or discoverer of the art, machine,
manufacture, composition, or improvement
for which he solicits a patent; that he does not
know and does not believe that the same was
ever before known or used, and shall slate of
what country he is a citizen. Such oath may
be made before any person within the United
States authorized by law to administer oaths,
or, when the applicant resides in a foreign
country, before any minister, charge d'affaires,
consul, or commercial agent holding com
mission under the Government of the United
States.
On the filing of such application and the
payment of the fees required by law, if on
such examination it appears that the claim
ant is justly entitled to a patent under the
law, ana that the same is sufficiently useful
and important, the Commissioner will issue a
patent therefor. " -
Every patent or any interest therein shall
be assignable in law by an instrument in
writing; and the patentee or his assigns or
legal representatives may in like manner
grant and convey an exclusive right under
his patent to the whole or any specified part
of the United States.
Who May Apply for alPatkntâ H. P., Locke
ford. San Joaquin County, Cal. Any person,
whether citizen or alien, being the original or
first inventor of any useful art, machine, man
ufacture or composition of matter, or any new
and useful improvement thereof, may obtain
a patent issued in the name ol the United
States and under the seal of the Patent. Office
for his invention or discovery, provided that
the same was not patented or described in any
printed publication in this or any foreign
country before his invention or discovery
thereof, and not in public use or on sale for
more lhan two yearn prior to his application
unless the same is proved to have been aban
doned; and by the person who, by his own in
dustry, genius, efforts and expense has in
vented and produced any new and original de
sign for a manufacture, bust, statue, alto-re
lievo orbas-re.ief ; any new and originaldesign
for the printing of woolen, silk, cotton or other
fabrics; any new and original impremlon, or
nament, patent, print or picture to be print
ed, painted, cast or otherwise placed on or
worked Into any article of manufacture; or
any new, useful and original shape or config
uration of any article of manufacture, the
same not having been known nor used by oth
ers before his invention or production thert
of, nor patented nor described in any printed
publication, noon the payment of the foes re
quired by law and other due proceedings nad.
Every patent contains a grant to the paten
tee, his heirs or assigns for the term of seven
teen years of the exclusive right to make, use
and vend the invention or discovery through
out the United States and the Territories,
referring to the specification for the particu
lars thereof.
If it appear that the inventor at the time of
makintfiis application believed himself to be
the first inventor or discoverer a patent will
not be refused on account of the invention or
discovery, or any pan thereof, having been
known or used in any foreign country before
his invention or discovery thereof if it had not
beeu before patented or described in any
printed publication. .â¦<,_Â».
Joint inventors are entitled to n joint patent,
neither can claim one separate^. md?pen.
deut inventors of distinct aad independent
improvements in the same machine cannot
obtain a joint patent for their separate Inven
tions; nor does the fact tnat one lurnishes h 6
capital and another makes the invent on
entitle them to make application as joint
inventors, but in such case they may become
joini patentees. , .â..,.â
The receipt of letters patent from a foreign
Government will not prevent the Â»n vector
from obtaininz a patent in the Lnited States,
unless the invention shall have been intro
duced into public use in tne Lnited Spates
more than two years prior to the application.
But every patent granted for an invention
which has been previously patented by tne
same invsntor in a foreign country will be so
limited as to expire at tne some time with vie
foreign patent, or, if there be more than one,
Rt the same time with the one having the
shortest unexpired term, but in no case will it
be in force more than seventeen years.

FOOD COFFEE.
FOUR OF A KIND.
And AIJ Brainy.
Four business men sat talking in an
office, when the subject of food and drink
came up.
One said that he had suffered for some
Bix months from a peculiar sensation in
the nead and had been under the care of a
physician, until he happened to read nn
article on the coffee topers of P;tri.Â», ii-
whicli the testimony of a number of physi-
cians was given to the effect that coffee
contained the same poisonous elements as
stychnine, morphine, tobacco and whisky,
but in smaller quantities.
This Ret liim to thinking, with a result
that coffee was left out of his diet, and in
less than a week the head trouble was
gone. Each of the other three gentlemen
added their testimony to the effect that
coffee had proved a sly and insidious en-
emy instead of a friend, as in each case
come stomach, liver or nervous trouble
had been produced by even mcde:a c cof-
fee drinking.
One added the remark ttat "It was
hard to givÂ« over coffee, but I got souk
Postum coffee, made of grains at Battle
Creek, Mich., and it is so perfect in color
and taste that I am enjoying my coffee
now daily, as are also my wife and cnil-
uren, for Postum is made of pure grains
(wheat, etc.) and is nourishing and fat-
tening, a pure food-drink, and another
feature not to be despised is the fact that
it goes about three times as far as coff-e,
although, of course,- the economj' is not
nearly so great a question as that of
healtti and comfort lor myself aud fam-
ily."

Cereal coffee, with ,k multitude of imita-
tions offerod aa "just as good."

The fishing-boat San.a Maria had a hard
time of it making port during yesterday's
northwester. The ieg-of- rant ton sail was
reefed twice, but still the little boat stag
gered under the canvas. While attempting
to take in the jib Antonio Lucca went
overboard, and had it not been for a
scow schooner that was ri::ht in the wake
of the fishing-boat he would never have
been heard from again. As it was, Cap
tain Jensen saw the catastrophe and hove
to. Tlie dinpey towing astern was soon
manned and the struggling fisherman
rescued. He was pat aboard hi* own
craft and shortly afterward landed at
Fishermen's wharf, little the worse for
his ducking.
There will be lively times and dull times
on the water front to-day. The few ships
that are discharging will take a rest, but
the exodus of picnicsers across the bay
in the morning will more than make up
for the stagnation of business at other
points. The parishioners of St. Francis'
Church will go to Sclv.'etzsn Park for their
annual outing, fct. Hose's parish will go

Tae iittle tchconer Prosper will start in

Captain Noyes, late of the sealing schooner
Bowhead, wilJ be in command, and he will
:ake four "clubbers" and a cook with him.
All the seals taken will be killed with a
ciub, so hunters are not wanted. The
Prosper will go as far south as the Galla
pagos group, and on the way will hunt for
sharks, from which the tins will be taken,
abalones and pearls. Siiould no seuls be
captured. Captain Noyes knows an island
where the pearl oyster abounds. So in all,
the six men who :orra the crew and Kneaa,
the owner, have bright prospects â on
paper.
There was another daylight robbery on
the water front yesterday. While the
proprietor of the City Front stables had
ins b.ick turned a sneak thief seized the
cash-drawer and got away with it bodily.
There was $:9S in coin and checks in it,
and so far nn trace of the thief bas Deen

the ollice wijen a stranger came in and
askea ;or a piece of paper and a pencil
with which to write a note. :While doing
it lie noted the position of the safe and
had a glance at the cash-drawer. While
Morshead was across the road attending
;o the sale of a horse the thief returned
and got away with tne drawer.
An investigation by Officer Mackey of
the Harbor police showed that the thief
had made an investigation of the J. F.

Last evening San Francisco Lodge No. 3, Benevolent Protective Order of Elks dedi
cated its new and magnificent- lodgeroom in Central Block, southeast corner of Sutler
street and Grant avenue. These have been fitted up at a cost of Â¥2300. The lodperoom Is
sixty feet deep and forty feet wide. From floor to ceiling is twenty-two feet, and in the
center of the ceiling is a long wide opening surmounted by a skylight six feet in height
Around the side of the room there are 180 chairs, but the seating capacity can, if occasion
requires, be increased to 500. The walls are tinted in a light color, which is relieved by a
white cornice. At the east end, over the exalted ruler's station, there is a vaulted room
in which will be placed the organ for the lodge, which will reach here in about two
weeks. The floor is covered with a fine, soft, small-figured drab carpet, the color being in
keeping with the tinting of the walls. There are dependent from the ceiling elegant chan
deliers, with 180 lights. These were made to order and are ornamented with elks' heads
the emblem of the order. Over the exalted ruler's station there is a large elk's head and
at the point of each antler there is a small Incandescent light, producing a very pretty
effect. The chairs at the various stations are of dark oak, and carved on them are the
words Fidelity, Justice, Brotherly Love and Charity. The lodpcroom, which is strikingly
attractive, is, next toKlntr Solomon's Hall in the Masonic Temple, the largest in the City
and is one oi which Â£I*s way well proud, .. ' "

The original fiction in this week's Town
Talk includes a story from life entitled '-Tne
Colonel's Romance." A leading article is one
upon the Woman's Congress, with portrait of
Mrs. Helen Gardener, guest of honor of that

resu.rie of the Music il Festival and Its par
ticipants; literary reviews; "Saunterer"

NEW AND ARTISTIC.
The "Go T den Eagle" Clothiers
Will Open for Business
Tc-Day.
Stocked With an Extens:V3 and Fine
Line of C:o Ling and
Hits.
One of the most attractive stores in San
Francisco is the ''Golden Eagle" at 104,
106 and 108 Kearny street, a new and
unique establishment dealing in clothing
I ana hats, which will throw open its doors
i to the public for the first time to-day. The
| interior of the building in qnestion has
' recently been renovated and several alter
] ations and additions effected in the prem
: ises with a view of making the Golden
Eagle one of the most modern and com
: plete as well as handsome and artistic
[ clothing and hat establishments in the
i country.
Over the entrance to the store, and set
off on either side by expansive show
winuows, beautifully drossÂ«d, is a mon
strous golden eagieâ the trademark o;
the new establishment â its outstretched
wings set off with a succession of incan
descent lights, which when lit up by meht
set off the figure in most becoming sty ie.
In the rear of the store is a skylight run
ning the entire width of the building,
through which a stream of light pour?,
illuminating the back part of the store and
adding materially to the cheerfulness of
the surroundings.
At night-time six arc lights serve the
purpose of illumination. The most im
j portant feature, however, of this new and
; grand establishment, and one which will,
!of course, interest the buying public
mostly, is the extent, variety and superior
quality of the stock of the new store,
which comprise? tome of the finest goods
j in hats and clothing to be found in the
country.

WISE WOMEN.
Those Who Heed the First Symp-
toms of Nervous Derangement.
Special from Mrs. Pinkham.
A dull, aching pain at the lower part
of the back and a sensation of little
rills of heat, or chills running down
the spine, are symptoms of general
womb derangement. _
If these symptoms are not accompa-
nied by leucor- . _>r'Jfc | w^.
rhoea, they are^fflPT^?Tv^BÃ|
toms. Any wo- IHwlk^
man of com- | HSH \\ v 8
mon sense will If V I W^
take steps to ~~ I l\ \\\
cure herself. 1 ' ' 1 \\
She will realize that I V \\ i
her generative system , \ â¢ \
is in need of help, and ' *-
that a good restorative medicine is
a positive necessity. It must be a medi-
cine with specific virtues. As a friend,
a woman friend, let me advise the use
of Lydia E Pinkham's .Vegetable
Compound. .
If your case has progressed so that a
troublesome discharge is already es-
tablished, do not delay, take the Veg-
etable Compound at once, so as to tone
up your whole nervous system ; you
can get it at any reliable drug store.
You ought also to use a local applica-
tion, or else the corrosive ; discharge
will set up an inflammation and hard-
ening of the parts. Mrs. Pinkham's
Sanative Wash is put up in packets at
25 cents each. To relieve this painful
condition this Sanative Wash is worth
its weight in gold.
Mrs. George W. SHEPABD.Watervliet,
N. V., says: "I am glad to state thai
I am cured from the worst form of fe-
male weakness. I was troubled very
much with leucorrhcea, bearing-down
pains and backache. Before using
Mrs. Pinkham's Remedies it seemed
that I had no strength at all. I was
in pain all over. I began to feel better
after taking the first dose of* Vegetable
Compound. ' I have used five bottles,
and I feel like a new woman. I know

Success !
The most successful brand of
tea baking powder . :
coffee flavoring extracts
soda spices
on this coast is Schilling's Best.
Its great success is in the
country, where grocers know
their customers personally, look
i out for their interests, and are
less apt to sell adulterated food
i â even for a big profit.
In San Francisco it is differ-
ent; you have got to insist
â  upon Schilling's â though
you will find soiue grocers who
care for other things besides
' big profits.

afternoon at 2 o'clock at the Velodrome,
Fell and Baker streets. None of the cap-
Chester A. Myrick, Captain Re
liance Club Wheelmen.
tains of the local clubs have called coun
try luns for the day, and tbeiobjective
point of all the riders will be this meet.
Never before have the wheelmen of this
City been so enthusiastic over a race meet
or so desirous that it should be a big suc
cess. They have renounced their alle
giance to the League of American Wheel
men and started out for themselves under
the name of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs, and they desire to show
their Eastern brethren, who were so quick
to refuse the West the divisional option it
asked ior at the last National assembly of
league delegates, that California can
easily do without the league and care for
itself as well if not much better than
with the L. A. W. support.
The "associated clubs" is a misnomer in
a way, for while it is and always has been
an association of the various cycling clubs,
recent changes in the by-laws provide for
the admission of individuals to member
snip on lhe payment of $1 entrance fee
and $1 annual dues, and those members
are entitled to similar privileges as were
received by L. A. W. members in this State.
As a result, the individual members have
simply flocked into the association. One
day this week a man handed in six appli
cations and the day following five more,
nnd they have come from all quarters.
Judge Kerrigan, on his return from Red
wood City yesterday, found a stack of
mail on his desk, most of which was ap
plications and remittances. Not for a long
time has a cycling movement in this State
met with such hearty support. Most of
these people who have joined are ex
league members, or whose memberships
in the old organization have not yet ex
pired. Surely the association starts out
with very flattering encouragement in the
support it has received from the riders.
It must be understood that the associ
ated clubs by no means intend to give the
major portion of their attention to the
support oi Sunday racing. That is only
one of many other features they will
cover, such as the issuance of a roadbook,
handbook, weekly bulletin, the arrange
ment of hotel rates, attention to legisla
tive matters interesting wheelmen, and
so on. Of course the issue and eventual
estrangement from the league was brought
about by the Sunday-racing question.
And as the issue was particularly on that
subject, naturally the desire is to make
to-morrow's meet as big a success as pos-
Bible to show the effete Easterners, who
cannot understand how a Caiifornian can
attend sports on the Sabbath day and
still be a Christian, that it is quite pos
sible to give a bicycle lace meet here on
a Sunday afternoon and attract to it the
best class of people.
The entries, heats and handicaps for the
meet were given in The Call yesterday.
There is a splendid programme, the riders
are some of the best amateurs and profes
sionals now in the State, and to one in
terested in ihe sport the meet should be
welt worth attending.
The appearance of OttoZieglerJr., said to
be the best rider California has ever pro
duced, and who ranks fifth in the list of
American champions, will be a greatdraw
mg card. When a man like Ziegler, whose
fame and name have been made on East
ern tracks under the sanction of the
L. A. W., is ready to forsake it for the
new association, it is safe to predict that
the other cracks who have been a bit
chary about entering into the new regime
will soon follow. Besides Ziegler, there
is Ciinton Coulter, whose unpaced mile of
1:59 is still the world's record, and who
has heretofore always raced on the Na
tional circuit.
If either Coulter or Ziegler thought for
a moment that the new association would
not be a success, or that their racing in
terests would not be better rared for than
by the L. A. W. they would not be likely
to join it and thereby incur permanent
suspension from ali Eastern track*. But
I would not be surprised to see ihe influ
ence of the C. A. C. C. spread, other State
associations formed and the control of
racing taken entirely out of the bands of
ihe L. A. W. very shortly â an end devoutly
to be wished lor.
The regular monthly meeting of the C.
A. C. C. will be held this evening at the
rooms of the Garden City Cyclers in San
Jose, and all delegates are requested to be
present.
The Imperial Cycling Club will install
its newly elected officers next Monday
night.
The Alameds Cyclers have elected the
following officers: V. A. Dodd, presi
dent; T. C. Stoddard, vice-president;
F. E. Graham, secretary; L. Hogg, treas
urer; Jesse F. Ives, Clinton Fortner and
\V. H. Ramsey, directors. Richard
Meserole was chosen captain. The club
has made arrangements for the erection
of a gymnasium on the lot adjoining the
clubhouse, and it will be lilted with all
modern appliances.
The East Oakland Wheelmen held their
first party last evtning at Washington
Hall, East Oakland. It was well attended
and every one had an enjoyable time.
The fourth annual "old man's run" of
the Reliance Club "Wheelmen will be held
to-morrow to tho top of Mount Tamal
pais. Don't think for a moment that the
"old men" propose wheeling to tnÂ« top of
the Marin County eminence. Not bo.
The itinerary includes a tug ride from the
foot of Broadway, Oakland, to San Quen
tin; thence by wheel via San Rafael to
Mill Valley, an easy ride, where the train
will be taKen to the top of the mountain.
After lunch they will return by train to
Sausalito, where they will again embark
on the tug, visit points of interest about
the bay and go home. Messrs. Jerome,
Bernays and Lovell have the outing in
charge, which is enough to insure a good
time.
Walter F. Foster, the well-known pro
fessional racer, was married Thursday to
Miss Laura Blair of this City. The happy
couple left for the south on their honey
moon.
The San Francisco Road Club was to
have held a high jinks and smoker at its
clubrooms, 503 Golden Gate avenue, this
evening, but owing to the death of one of
the members the affair has been post
poned.
Thomas H. B. Varney and C. M. Christ
offer returned from Chicago Thursday.
Christoffer had never been further East
man Oakland before he made this journey,
and happened into Varney's store at 4:30
o'clock the day he was leaving. In a
joking way, he said to Varney, "I'll go
with you." "Well, you'll have to hurry
up about it," replied Varney. "The boat
leaves at 6 o'clock." He laughed and
thousrht no more about it. Christoffer got
on his wheel, rode out to his house on
btanyan street, changed his clothes, tooK
some money, remounted his wheel and
caught the 6 o'clock boat, sending his
bicycle back by a messenger-boy. They
say the sight of him living down the cable
slot with a grip in one hand and an over
coat over his arm, was something not to
be forgotten. Varney was somewhat sur
prised when he showed up, but they had
a good time on the trip.
T. Alfred Griffiths of the Bay City
Wheelmen is touring through Lake County

THE PUGILISTS.
Bouts That Will Ba Held In This
City During tho Month
of May.
The directory of the Olympic Club de
cided at a meeting held last evening that
its grand boxing entertainment, which
was got up purposely for the benefit of
the club, will be held in Woodward's Pa
vilion on the evening of May 18 and that
the prices of admission are to be $5, $3, $2
and $1.
Jeffries, the champion heavy-weight of
Los Angeles, returned from the Angel
City yesterday and will commence train
ing to-day in Oakland under the instruc
tions of Billy Delaney. His opponent,
Henry Baker, is putting on muscle and
lubricating his nether limbs at Blanken's
hostelry. Joe Gans, the celebrated fighter,
is stationed at the Terrace baths in Ala
meda and Al. Leonard, the stocky little
New York pugilist who is to hold a fistic
interview with tne Baltimore champion,
will locate at filanken's. They hare
agreed to weigh in on the day of the tight
at 133 pounds. Riley and Lawler, two
locai bantam-weight pugilists, will open
the evening's entertainment with a ten
round bout, which gives promise of being
very interesting.
The Pacitic Athletic Club haa decided to
give a grand boxing entertainment some
evening during this month for the benefit
of the unemployed, and it is said that the
committee which has the Balboa boule
vard fund in charge will loot after me
financial end of the sbow.
A new athletic club is being organized
on the South Side, the following gentle
men having the charter roll in charge:
James H. Kennedy, Frank Skuce, Frank
Lawler, Thomas Kelly, James Learv and
several otuers. Over 200 signatures a"re on
the roll. A permanent organization will
be formed on Monday evening. May 3, at
the old Manhattan Athletic Club Hali
corner of Eighth and Folsom streets. It
is the intention of the promoters of this
club to establish one of the largest clubs
in the City. In order to have the club
house remodeled, decorated and put in
first-class shape, purchase apparatus and
refurnish the clubrooms, an initiation
fee of %2 will be charged. The dues will be
50 cents per month. It is also intende.l
to have an amateur boxing contest once
a month.
The National Club will give an enter
tainment in the latter part of this month.
The event of the evening will be a twenty
round contest between McKiever and
George Qreen.
Latent intelligence from New York is to
the effect that the boxing club munagers
are cutting each others' throats and that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY I,Â« 1897.
the snort will soon find a grave in that
great city. Tom O'Rourke, who is the
acknowledged king of the boxing club
managers, has a happy way of making
enemies for himself among those who op
pose him in business. Artful Thomas
waits until an opposition club in about to
sign two able-bodied scrappers and at the
last moment O'Rourke sends a courier tv
the training quarters of the scrappers with
a message stating that he (O Ronrke)
wishes to see them on most important
business.
Pugilists, generally speaking, have little
regard for principle; they will not hesi
tate to throw one club down and favor an
opposition club if they can profit by the
scheme in any way. The result of the
message is soon made apparent. The
pugs hold a coherence with artful
Thomas â all on the quiet â and he signs
them to do battu in his club just at a
time when an opposition club has made
all arrangement" for the contest after
having the word and "honor" of the
principals that they would positively ap
pear under its management.
O'Rourke outbids his opponents be
cause he has the "political push" at his
back and consequently can afford to
venture where the others dare not tread.
It is very probable that the boxing cluos
of New York will be short lived.
Tde next battle of importance that
O'Rourke will pull off will be a twenty
round contest between Peter Maher and
Tom Sharkey, and good judges contend
that if Maher cannot put the sailor to
sleep in six or eight rounds the latter will
have a good chance of winning the long
end of the green, as Maher cannot go a
long distanoe. Although iSbarkey is not
known as a tighter who knocks his game
out he is nevertheless a big husky fellow
who will bother any man that cannot "do
him" in tolerably quick order.
THE ANGLER.
Dynamiting Trout Near Glen Ellen.
Fishing In Lake Pillar
cltos.
Angling in coast streams should now be
at its best, but sportsmen who nave re
cently returned from the mountains re
port that the rivers and streams wili not
be ripe for fly-lishing for some weeks to
come.
Al Cum ming and Achilla Eoos got back
from a two weeks' vacation on Thursday,
and Gumming is chock full of trout
stories. He states that the trout of
| Klamath River have a soft and unpleasant
flavor, caused, doubtless, by the water,
which is of a muddisn color, attributable
to tne many tons of decayed tule in a lake
wliico is the river's source.
Mr. Camming found fisbtraps in Spen
ser Creek, which stream is in the State of
Oregon. Ths trappers catch the fish ana
j ship them to Sarramanto. He also states
that professional fishermen capture many
tons of ttout in the season by means of
I dipnets, which are placed under the
Klamaihan Falls. Fisti Commissioner
Vogelsang will pay a visit to Ager in a
few days purposely to inspect the dam.
Messrs. Cooper, Walker and Cooney
' caught some nice trout last Sunday in Los
' Gatos Creek, but the stream is yet too
hiÂ«h for good fly-fishing.
Frank Doliiver is an odd character. He
': was hshing in a stream which runs
through the grounds of the Country Club
recently, when lie was accosted by a mem
ber in this wise:
'â¢Weil, sir, what are you doing here?
Don't you know that this is private prop
erty ?"
Doliiver looked amusingly at his ques
tioner for a few seconds and then
answered:
"Oh, yes; I understand that this is the
Country Club all right enough, but I re
cently joined the Overland Hunting and
Fishing Club, which gives members the
right to fasn and 6hoot wherever they
please."
The Country Club sportsman Imme
diately saw the point of the joke and al
lowed tne trespasser to enjoy himself for
the balance of the day.
Some very nice trout have been taken
from Lake Pillarcitos since April 1 by
anglers who hart permission from the
Spring Valley Water Company to fish.
The trout are in good condition.
It is rumored that permits wili soon be
issued to anglers who desire to try their
luck on Lake San Andreas. The Crystal
Lake will not be opened this year to any
but directors of the company.
It has been learned from excellent au
thority that two saloon-keepers at Glen
Ellen have been using dynamite for the
purpose of killing fishes in Sonoma Creek.
They cast in their sticks late in the even
ing or early in the morning and as a re
sult a number of dead suclcers and chubs
can be seen floating in the pools above the
town of Glen Ellen.
The angling fraternity ha 1 ? lost in H. B.
Myers one of its oldest members. The
poor old gentleman, who was passionately
fond of angling, was buried last Thurs
day. It is only a few weeks ago when he
wa; seen watching his pole with the keen
est of interest in the center of a number of
anglers who were fishing at the "White
House," Point Reyes.
Anglers will also regret to learn that
John Sammi, one of the organizers of the
San Francisco Kod and Gun Club, has
been confined to his home with stomach
troubles for the past week, but his phyii
cian reports that he will soon be con
valescent. It is hoped that Jnck will
make a vigorous idek against dull care
and sickness and be among his friends
soon a.-am.
The FUh Commissioners, Messrs. Em
eric and Vogelsang, have requested the
Spring Valley Water Company not to
open Lake San Andreus until July 1,
when the bass season will commence. If
the Fish Commissioners were as active in
the protection of fishes in public streams
as they are in offering suggestion! to
corporations the tax-payers of the coun
try who arÂ« sportsmen and anglers would
better appreciate the service of a Fish
Commission.
THE OARSMEN.
The South Ends Will Picnic at the
Bohemian Grove To-
Morrow.
The South End crews have commenced
training for their club regatta, which will
take place over the long-bridge course on
Sunday, May 16
The Midgets were outlast Sunday morn
ing and rowed in their old-time form.
They are all in the pink of condition and
are confident that the new senior crew
will pay for the French dinner.
Gus Carson, the afterwaist, had not
rowed a barge for many months, and it is
sui I that as be stepped into the boat be
smiled lor the first rime since the 9th of
September, when on that memorable oc
casion his smiles were drowned in the
gloomy and desolate waters of tne Stock
ton Siough and the Stockton Giants were
declared the champions of 1896.
The junior crews have all been working
hard, and with another week's training
should be able to make a favorable show
ins.
Joe Lyons will captain one of the crews,
and in this position will prove a valuab.e
man.
James Feehan is alto a very ambitions
junior, and with a little more experience
be will give the men in his class a lively
race for honors.
To-morrow the South Ends will lay
aside their boats and oars, and for the first
time in many years will take up their
lunch-baskets'and fishing-poles and spend
the day among the giant redwoods and
pine forests of Bohemia Grove.
Judging from ttie amount of tickets al
ready sold and the deep interest which all
the members have taken in this outing,
it is safe to predict that it will be a grand
success.
The Dolphin Swimming and Boating
Club made a great success of its picnic
to Bohemia Grove last Sunday.
T. J. Sullivan has offered a diamond
medal to be won three times by outrigeer
skiff oarsmen. The first race will beheld
May 23, and five of the entrants have be
gun training. Alex Pape is receiving
pointers from William McCausland, and
T. R. Keenan, T. J. Kennedy, T. M. Fer
guson and Will Patch have begun work
at the boathouse. Pape will row in Mc-
Causland's boat, as it is rigged to suit him.
Three times a week the Dolphin crew
row around AlcAtraz Island. The crew is
composed of Will Patch, stroke; Alex
Pa jyj.JaUer waist; T. J. Kennedy, forward
waiÂ»t, and William Meyer, dow, with T.
K. Keenan cockswain.
Captain Patch will keep this crew to
gether and enter them in me El Campo
regatta, schedubd for June 6.
The club is building a float, 20x15, to
be anchored 100 yards irom the boathouse
for the use of the swimmers.
A challenge has been posted in the boat
house by a crew composed of T. R. Keenan,
T. J. Kennedy, Alexander Pape and W ill
Patch, to- row any crew in the club a race
in the four-oared shell against the racing
barge. The conditions are that the shell
is to have inside course in a race of mile
and a naif straight away.
James J. Cronin and James Laib have
also posted a challenge to paddle a canoe
against Fred Woerner and Charley Roach
ior a French dinner, with George R. Sulli
van ai stakeholder.
THE YACHTSMEN.
The Corinthians Will Set Sail
to McNear's To-
Night.
The iecretary of the Encinal Yacht
Club has notified the Corinthians of the
recelval of their challenge. No action will
be taken until the board of directors meet
on Monday next.
The interest in small boats is on the in
crease, as is shown by the late additions
to the Corinthian fleet.
F. E. Baker is having a cat-yawl built
by Wilson from designs tnat appeared in
the Rudder. She will be 23 feet over all
and 16 feet load water line. She has an
up-to-date appearance and should develop
great speed. Â-. .- '
Charles Barlage is having a boat simi
lar to Baker's built. She will be cat
ringed and will be 19 feet over all. When
completed she will be called the Dread
naught.
As the new boats will be finished in
time for the next regatta a good race will
surely take place among these half-raters.
The Chispa set sail for Benicia last
week. Ex-Commodore Gutte has had her
on Turner's ways, where she was thor
oughly overhauled and put in first-class
shape for the season.
In the opening cruise last Sunday the
Amigo was very much admired by yachts
men. The shifting of her mast two feet
and six inches has improved the boat won
derfully. She showed great speed and
will surely give the other footers a
close race in the coming regattas.
â  To-night all the Corinthian boats will
cruise to McNears'. . This is practically
the first cruise of the season and a large
number of boats are expected to go.
Peter Dean has again chartered the
Frolic for the season. The boat has un
dergone extensive alterations, and she
makes a handsome appearance in the
water.

HANDBALL.
Olympic Club Players Are Aaratn
Flouring Upon a New

The Olympic Club handball-players
hare determined to put their shoulders to
thÂ« wheel and subscribe sufficient money
themselves for the construction of a regu
lation-size handball court, which will be
within easy reach of the club's swimming;
tank. Last evening a number of promi
nent players met at the club and a com
mittee was appointed to confer with the
owner of the property that adjoins the
club on the weat side and report" proeress
this evening. It is said that the owner of
the lot on which the proposed court will
be constructed has offered to meet the
players half wayâ that is so far as the ex
pense attached tp the construction of a
tine court is concerned â and if all goes
well tne Olympic Club ball-players will
soon have a court, independent of the
club, that they can justly feel proud of.
The following games of hnndball will

CRICKET CHIRPS.
The Scheduled Cup Matches for the
Season and Other Interesting
Notes.
The California Cricket Association has
issued the schedule of interclub matches
to be played for the Hunter Harrison
cup. The events are thirty-six in nam
ber, the last to be played October 10.
Following are the officers and delegates
of the association for the year:
Officers â Edward Brown, president; vice
presidentsâA. G. Sheath, R. B. Hogue, John
t-alvert, A. E. Coates; Arthur lukersley, sec
retary and treasurer.
Delegates: Alameda C. Câ R. B. Hogne and

i. Sewell; San Jose C. Câ C. H. Coles and G.
A. Grahume; Lakeport C. Câ W. O. Edmauds
and EL V. Keeliug. "
At the present time it would seem that
the California club will have to drop out
of the competition. Twice have they en
deavored to put a team on the field and
failed. Should their dissolution take
place it will involve a three-cornered ar
rangement of games, which means the use
of only one field a week.
Cricket news from the East and North
is just commencing to come to hand.
The Multnomah Club of Portland, led
by their able chief, Char!ey Lawrence, an
ex-Alamedan, are busy practicing for a
cricK6t match with the Australian base
ball men â to be played some time in May.
A representative eleven from the Phila
delphia and other Eastern combinations
will start for England in the course of a
few weeks.
Owing to the inability of the Californiaa
to round up a team, their match with
Alameda, scheduled for to-morrow, will
be forfeited. This will give everybody a
chance to witness the Pacific- Bohemia
contest at Golden Gate, which is likoly to
be well worth seeing. Umfiek.
THE GUN.
Club Shoots That Will Be Held To-
Morrow Near This City.
The much-talked-of Golcher's handicap
tournament, which is open to all lovers of
inanimate-targets hooting, will be held
to-morrow at the Pacific tournament
grounds. No entrance fee will be charged,
the participants paying the price of birds
shot at only. The system of handicap
ping adopted should guarantee a large
entry, as every shooter will have a chance
of winning one or more of the valuable
prizes offered. The expert target-smash
ers will shoot at twenty-rive birds, and all
other participants will be given a handi
cap of from one to five birds, according to
their known merit in trap-shooting.
The other shooting events announced to
take place to-morrow are: California Wing
Shooting Club at Ingleside, Lincoln Gun
Clud at Alameda Point and Encinal Gun
Club bhoot at Bira's Point.
Basket Ball.
Two more scores were added to the list
of the championship games during the
week.
One of tne games was played in the
gymnasium of the Oakland Y. M. C. A.,
between tne Business Men's team and the
Ninety-sevens, botn of San Francisco, and
going to battle on foreign territory. It
was a good, clean game, and remarkable
for two records which were made. It
showed the smallest number of fouls, or
violations of rules, one single foul being
called only, and this for making progress
with the ball by Wilson of the Business
Men's team. The Ninety-sevens played
the prettiest game from a "legal' 1 stand
point. Unfortunately for tnem, they aid
not score any goals either. The Business
Men carried off the victory with 22 to 0
points to their credit.
It was a close gamÂ« when the Athens of
Oakland fought tne Rushers of San Fran
cisco. The game was' played in the gym
nasium of the Young Mens' Christian
Association on Ellis and Mason streets, of
our City. In the first half it was impossi
ble to predict which side would come out
on top. The ball was tossed up many
times to the mouth of the basket, bin the
basket did not seem to care much for the
pill and repeatedly refused to swallow it.
Manager Shaw, who did some good work
for the Rushers, became almost supersti
tious and could not see why the ball did
not do what he wauted it. The Athens
put up a splendid game. They made use
of every opportunity and when their op
ponents were not close to their sides they
would gain space and try for goal. The
score stood 6 to 1 in favor of the Athens
from Oakland.
Sacramento Sporting: News.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 29.â George H.
\oung surprised all the crackerjacks of the
Capital City Bluerock Club last Sunday by
smashing 23 out of 25 clay boys and leading
the club list. It is said that this was not a
surprise to W. H. Young, and that the old
veteran duck slaughterer. Captain Young,
was so proud over the performance of the
youngster that he get 'em up in good style.
Just the same it was a great performance, and
"My Brother George" has demonstrated that he
is a not one. The scores made were as follows :
G. H. Young 23, Thomas 21, F. M. Newbert 21.
F. C. Yoerk;i7, Ruhstaller Jr. 17, A. A. Nico
laus 15, E. D. Adams 14, Dr. Duel 14, W. H.
Young 14, Helms 13, F. Keisel 13, Roberts 19.
"The Spoonbills" were also out in force, ana
considering the hard wind they made excel
lent scores: C. Flohr 20, S'eigler 19. Soule 19,
Gruhler 18, Fitzgerald 17, Thomas 17, Wormer
17, Chapman 15, E<:khardt 15, Damni 15,
Shore 14, Bohn 12.
The racing element of the Capitol City
Wheelmen will put up a series of races on
Mayday. The protest made by the Stockton
Oluo in the late road race has aroused con
siderable indignation among the members of
the club, but they claim to possess ample
pmof that they did "the square thing."
Parson Upson's pointer has developed into a
great rustler. When hungry he leaves the
store, goes to the nearest hotel or restaurant,
orders lunch put up, and brings it with the
bill to the store and proudly carries it to his
master. Truckee's enthusiastic trout fisher,
Dr. Schoemaker, reports several good baskets
for the past week, but the streams are still
high. A whist club has been started In this
city with a membership of nearly 300 ladies
and gentlemen. The intention is to procure
flrst-clsss clubrooms, which will be kept open
day and night ior the use of members. No
gaming of any description allowed. The list
contains the names of all the leading citizens
of 'he city who enjoy the game, and a grand
success is assured. Several private tennis
courts have been formulated of late, and re
newed interest is being shown in the sport;
as yet the club has no! selected new courts to
replace the ones that have boen torn up, but
it expecu to do so in the near future.

tion met with some opposition on the part
of the police, but the Socialists came out
of the controversy victorious. On W< dnes
day the speakers assembler! on Sixth
street, below the corner of Market. >o
sooner was the speakers' stand placed
than a policeman told George Speed tnat
he would not be permitted to speak there.
Speed's answer was that nothing short of
being arretted would stop him. The bluft
worked all right and the officer Kept nim
self busy during the rest cf the meetinsr
by seeing that the sidewalk was kept
open to pedestrians.
Thursday evening W. M Wilkins, E. T.
Kinusley and others opened the meeting
again in the same place and a large
crowd assembled. Another officer went
up to the speaker and told him ttiat there
wouid be no meeting allowed there that
night and for him to get down.
This provoked the ire of Wilkins, wuo
cried : "This is a public meeting and under
the State and United States constitutions
we are allowed the right of free speech.
If you don't keep quiet or disturb this
meeting I will arrest you for disturbing a
public meeting."
Again the bluff worked, for the officer
went to the telephone and was instructed
to keep an open passage-way on the side
walk, which he did, and the meeting pro
ceeded without further disturbance.
STAHLE AGAIN INDICTED.
The Grand Jury Found That He

Investigation of the Straw BonJ
Scandal m Which Clerk* Foley
I Concerned.
The Grand Jury went into Judge Sea
well's court yesterday afternoon and pre
sented another indictment for embezzle
ment against Dr. F. H. Stahie, ex-super
intendent of the City and County Hospi
tal. The paper filed yesterday sets forth

hospital.
The investigation of charges against
John W. Foley, clerk of Police Court No.
2 was resumed yesterday afternoon by the
Grand Jury. The witnesses examined
were Officer Dukes and Wong Ting, the
expert of the Chief of Police. The expert
inspected quite a number of bonds, and
found that such alleged sureties as Chang
Chung, Ching Ling, You Chow, Sim On,
Chan Low and Ah Won did not exist.
Their names appeared on bail bonds for
the release of offenders. It was the judg
ment of the expert that the bonds were
worthless.
Clerk Foley waa on hand when the ses
sion began, but as the Finance Committee
of the Board of .Supervisors desired his
presence before that body he was excused
for the day by the jury.
The report of the Grand Jury commit
tee on parks, accompanied by the report
of the experts, will be submitted next
Tuesday. The report is elaborate and in
general terms commendatory of the man
agement of Golden Gate Pars.
A detailed statement of all moneys re
ceived and disbursed by the Park Com
missioners since July 1, 1896, is embodied
in the reports of the experts. The report
shows in itemized form for wbal purpose
the money was expended.

POISOH" TOR PETS.
A Mysterious Woman Has Declared
War Against Dogs and Cats.
The police, as well as the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, are on
the lookout for some fiend in the neigh
borhood of Baker and Folsom streets who
has been spreading poison for the extinc
tion of dogs.
The neighborhood is one of private
homes, and the residents nearly all have
pet does. Last year about this time a
Great Dane and two hunting dogs were
poisoned, and heavy rewards were offered
for the capture and conviction of the
poisoner. The latter, however, disap
peared until a week ago, when a dozen or
more dogs and cata were taken violently
ill, and were only saved from death by
remedies promptly applied.
The belief is that a mysterious woman
seen skulking about the neighborhood
some time ago threw poisoned meat into
the back yards of the different houses.
Suddeu Death.
Maurice Maloney, a native of Ireland, aged
50 years, and laborer by occupation, dropped
dead yesterday after carrying a trunk down
stairs from 1512 California street. He was as
sisting an expressman in removing trunks
from the house.
The deceased wai a single man and roomed
at the Reno House. The probable cause of
death was heart disease.

Result of an Investigation
by Expert New
man.
Two Worthless Bonds Discov
ered and One of the Defend
ants Has Fled.
A Prisoner Released on His Own
RecogD.iz.ince Fails to Appear
in Court.
As a result of an investigation by Chri3
Newman, the expert of the Board of Hu
pervtsori, two bonds recently accepted by
Judge i ampbell have beÂ«n declared worth
less and bench warrants have teen issued
from the Superior Court for the arrest of
the two defendants.
One of them, Nellie Murphy, alias
Mamie Meehan, a notorious pickpocket,
was arrested yesterday afternoon, but the
other, John Langer, a pork butcher, can
not be found, and the police believe ho
bus fled the City.
Lauger was arrested March 5, for asEault
with a deadly weapon upon G. Hranuelli,
a cook in the restaurant at 1146 Market
street, on March 5. He struck him over
the bead with an iron bucket and nearly
killed him. He was released on his own
recognizance by Judge . Conlan, but the
j'ndge, on hearing the 'serious nature of
the case issued a bench warrant for his
arrest. â¢ â  â¢ . â 
Langerkept out of the way till April
10, when Detectives Dillon and Crockett
arrested him in a butcher's shop in the
Mission. On April 16 be was held to an
swer before the Superior Court in $1000
bonds by Actinc Judge Kerrigan, and
three days later was sent to the County
Ja:l, but he was released on bonds that af
ternoon. :
The sureties were Alexander J. Meader,
a notorious straw-boudscnan, and Mrs. D.
P. Smith. Meader qualiried on lot 67,
!~'choolhouse station, tfan Mafo, which he
swore was of the value of $1000. Newman
wrote to Assessor Hayward o.' San Mateo
County and received a reply that the lot
.->essed at $00. The name of Mrs. D.
.â¢^niitb, who qualified on property ai
M ssion street, cannot be found on
â¢ tie records.
In tue case of Nellie Murphy she was
to answer for erand larceny by Judge
J achimsen in $1000 bonds, aud on April
I'l she was released on bonds.
Meader was one of the sureties, and he
n.-.iin quahliej on the same lot in San
0 assessed for JSO. The other surety
.'oseph N. More, who qualified on a
run s.c- store, 1936% Mission street, which
sed for $!Â»(J.
: These facts were communicated by
Newman to District Attorney Barnes,
and bench warrants were immediately
1 for the arrest of Langer and Nellie
Marpny..
The bonds were not handed to Newman
..'â lie Camp Dell till April 2Â»>, although
one was accepted on April 19 and the
other on April 2L
A case suowing the evil of prisoners be
ing released on their own recognizance Dy
-:e io whose court the prisoner is not
assigned came to light yesterday.
John Harris, r boiler-maker, 28 years of
â¢ is arrested Tuesday afternoon by
Policemen Buckley and Ennis in South
J-an Francisco for being arunk and for
tarrying a concealed weapon. He was
i at the soutnern station at 2:20 p.
â â¢ . v.as removed to the City Prison about
M , and was released on his own
recognizance at 5:15 p. M. by Judge Low
et the recjne*: of Attorney Gallagher.
Yesterday morning when the case was
cal.ed in Acting Police Judge Kerrigan's
Harris failed to appear, as was ex
: from the fact that he bad hinted
- much before he was released, and a
bench warrant was issued for his arrest.
secnting Attorney Mogan took occa
remart that it was an instance of
the evil of a Judce releasing a prisoner on
his .own recognizance without knowing
whether the caso would be aligned to hiÃ
court.
It is not believed that John Harris is
the man's real name, and the police ex
pect to have considerable difficulty in
nnding him.
THE YAQUINA.
Captain Hinkie Exonerated From AH
Blame by the Inspec
tors.
Captains Phillips and Bohl, Local In
spectors of Hulls, otc, yesterday made
iLeir report on the Yaquina disaster.
After recitine the facts, which have been
published already, the inspectors say:
"After careful consideration of the evi
dence we are of the opinion that Captain
Hinkie was navigating the steamer Ya
quina on the above occasion in a careful
and skillful manner and we have exoner
a:ed him from ail blame accordingly.
."The hall of the steamer remained on
the beach and about one half of the cargo
:>was sav/*d. Â, .1
. â :.â¢â  "The Yaquina vas valued at $20,000 and
the cargo lost at $3500."

glesids.
Receding in the Betting From
3 to 15 to 1, Tea Rose
Won Easily.
Rey SaUzar Was First Again-Mon
tal'.ade Proved Quite a Surprise.
Stratfarol Finished Third.
The crack Ruinnrt, winner of the Burns
handicap and the Palace Hotel stake,
came out in a seven-furlong run at Ingle
side yesterday and, according to the con
ditions of the race, packed 121 pounds
and his old a:de partner, Marty Bergen.
Wheel ol Fortune was a 7 to 5 favorite and
displayed a total absence of winning form,
never being able to raise a gallop. Kuin
art, a 0 to 5 second cboice, did not do
much better, failing to finish among the
first three. Tea Kose. the flying filly,
racing in the colors of Bookmaker George
Rose, with {'0 pounds in the saddle, made
a processional affair of it, taking: the lead
iroru Greyhurst entering the back stretch
and beating the gray colt out at the wire
by two lengths with apparent ease in
I :2B}Â£. Good Times finished a fair third.
The winner opened up at threes, receding
to 1J to 1 on a rumor that the stable did
not fancy her chances.
The attendance was good, and tho bet
ting livelier than for some days. The
favorites without exception were all
bowled over, some of them being of the
most pronounced type, and me rin Â£
reaped a harvest.
Daggie SmitU's last filly Torsida was
backed down from 7 to 5 to 9 to 10 to defea:
the six other twc-year-oida in the open
ing live-furlong scramble. Johnny Weber
had the leg up, and. as usuai, was away
in front. Rey ISalazar, the second choice,
ridden by Piggott, was quickly at her
side, and," outvoting the first choice to
the wire, won by a head in 1:02%.
Tnwanda was third.
Of the poor lot which started in the sec
ond event at seven furlongs Ricardo was
considered the best, and was chalked up
an 8 to 5 favorite, receding !a;er, uo .sever,
to 11 to 5. Earl Cochran. a7to 2 choice,
always had the footing over him. and,
maintaining the lead throughout, led Wil
liam OB past the wire by tnree lengths in
! :29. Clawsoa Janded Chappie, a 30 to I
chance, in the show.
Eight cheap selling platers faced the
barrier in the mile and a sixteenth, with
Jact Manin ruling a meek 11 to 5 choice.
After Mite Kice had led to the far turn,
Piggott on Japonica, the second choice,
went around the bunch and won, easing
up, from old Jack Richelieu. Jack Martin
secured the small end of the purse in a
drive.
Strathrol, with his suspicious legs, was
a pronounced eten-money choice for the
fifth event, over seven furlongs under
selling conditions. The first choice, with
ReQdington at his side, cut out a hot pace
to the s> retch with Mouiallade, an 8 to 1
chance, galloping iv third place. When
atrmghtened for the wire, Slaughter, on
ibe latter, let out a link, and By Holly's
horse jralloped in winner by three lengths
in I:2B}Â£. Rcddington nosed the favorite
out for me place.
The Midlothian colt Lode Star opened
up at evens to carry off the last race, a mile
purse, but in some unaccountable manner
feil out of the race at the first turn and was
fully ten lengths behind the bunch turning
into the backstretch. KN;e Smith showed
the vay to the stretcn, where she quit.
Fashion Plate then went on, winning very
handi.y by four lengths in 1:44. The
favorite made up a vast amount of lest
ground the last half, finishing third, two
lengths behind Russella.

HIGH SALARIES WIN.
Police and lire Department Officers
Will Get Increased Pay.
Judge Seawell handed down an opinion
yesterday sustaining the validity of the
law which grants large increases in sala
ries for the officers of the Police and Fire
departments of this City.
T'ne contention was raised by a suit in
stituted by Max Popper, who thought tne
law unconstitutional. His main point
was that the Legislature had no right to
impose additional burdens on the people
of this City without their consent, and
that the new law was unconstitutional.
Judge Seawell decides that as San Fran
cisco is incorporated under the consolida
tion act ths Legislature has the power to
control its affairs by general laws.
An application for stay of proceedings
was denied, and the officers can get their
increased pay on demand uniess Auditor
Broderick should prefer to wait lor the
Supreme Court's decision.

JUROR SIMONS IS
RATHER UNHAPPY
Called on to Answer for
Alleged Contempt of
Court.
Witnesses Swear That He Talked
to Them Abmt the Tur
ner Case.
Strong Testimony to That Effcl Ad
duced in tbe Hearing Before
Judge Wallace.
Isador Simon had an unplea?ant hour
in Judge Wallace's court yesterday in an
swering to a charge ot contempt of court.
Simon was a juror in the case of J. F.
Turner, who was tried for grand larceny.
When the jury came into court to report
thattbey were unable to agree, the fore
man caused a sensation by declaring one
member of the jury had refused to share
in the deliberations of the jury, but from
first to last had stood out against the
other members on the question of the de
fendant's guilt.
At that time Deputy District Attorney
Black anuounced that he could prove
that Simon had been talking about the
case, so he was cited to show cause why
he should not be punished for contempt
of court for disobeying the Judge's orders
not to converse about the case, and yes
terday was set for the hearing.
An affidavit by Simon was read by At
torney Schell. It set forth that when the
balloting began in the jury-room there
were five votes for acquittal, afterward
there were four, then three and finally
only one for acquittal. All the allega
tions of the accusing witnesses are denied,
and it was charged that Mrs. Finnecan is
the pliant tool of Megginson and Frenna
in their des're to be revsnged on Simon,
because they were deprived of their re
venge on Turner, when he would not vote
for a verdict of "guilty as charged."
The affidavit contains this additional
matter, which will be of interest to jurors
and other citizens:
The only conversation affiant had relative to
said Eisenschiinme! was during a recess of the
trial, when J. O. Hecker. one of the jurors
sworn to try snid cause, said to affiant, "Do
you know how lnuoli Eisenschimmel gots a
day?" To which afflaut replied, "I dou't
know. How much does he get a day? " To
which Htcker replied, "Well, I was told he
got $50 a day." AiTiani then said, "vVho toid
you that?" and HecJtfll answered. "Juryman
Rosenfeld told inc." Tiiert-ttfter wnen affiant
resumed hi* Â«out in the jury-box he leaned
over sail Hecker's knee and said, "Is that to
that Eisenv-'himmel gets $jO a day for ex
pening here?" and he replied, "Yes, that's so,
and Eisensthimmel saya the jurors are well
paid at $2 a day."
.T. H. Paige testified that he knows Isa
dor Simon by sitiht. He saw Simon in
the jury-box during the trial of J. F. Tur
ner, charged with grand larceny. During
one of the reces?es of ihe trial the witness
beard Simon talking to one of the wit
nesses about the testimony of expert Carl
Eisenchirnmel in the Turner case. He
ga;d, 'Did you notice how he cbauged his
testimony?" Then he spoke about the
testimony concerning the shadina of let
ters. It was at the noon recess, in the
courtroom, that the conversation between
Simon and the other witness took place.
At the request of Judge Wallace the
witness stepped down and pointed out the
chair in the courtroom in which Simon
and nimself were sitting at the time of
the conversation about the testimony in
the case.
He said: "I was talking with Meggi
soii, Frenna and Mrs. Elizabeth Finnecan,
and I said it looked like a good jury.
Somebody said they thought there would
be a disagreement, and I said if there was
I thought I couid fell who would Lethe
juror to disagree. Then I told them of
what I heard Simon say. I toid it to Meg
gison In the presence of the others."
In reply to Attorney Schell, who iepre-
Bfcnted Mr. Simon, Witness Paise said that
he went to the office of the District At
torney and swore to an affidavit set
ting forth the facts. He did so at tne re
quest of Meggison. According to nis
recollection tho conversation of Mr. Si
mon took place on the sth of April, just
before 2 o'clock.
Mrs. Elizabeth Finnican testified that
during the trial Juror Simon talked with
tier about the case. He approached her
as she stood at the door of the courtroom
and said a great deal about the case. He
said he noticed ihat she was a constant
attendant at the trial, and Trent on 10 say
that it was too bad that there was so
much villainy abroad, and wanted to
know if she was interested in the case,
and when she told him no, but she might
have something to do with this man here
after, he said ne wouid rattier it would be
she than tie who had to deal with Turner.
He thought it too bad that people like
this should prosper all the time, yet that
was the way It looked. He said he would
not have the nerve to ask a man to per
jure himself for him, but this person on
trial seemed to be able to get all that he
wanted; that when persons like thisrould
accomplish iheir ends it was too hard for
honest people.
Attorney Sci.ell had a lot ofamuseraent
in cross-questioning Mrs. Finnican, but
she proved as witty as the lawyer and her
story was not shaken,
J. F. Hecker, one of the jurors in the
Turner case, was introduced on behalf of
the defendant and testified tUat he talked
with Simon about the pay of the expert
and it appeared that they understood he
got $00 a day.
Judge Wallace said that would be a
harmless interchange between jurors.
Dr. W. P. Cool, A. D. McAvoy and J. 11.
Bartlett disputed au allegation in MegKi
son's affidavit that Simon was loitering
about Turner's office on Saturday
April 10.
Victor Duhem testified thst he wit
nessed the meeting between Mrs. Finne
can and Simon at the courtroom door.
She seemed to attract Simon's attention
and they talked only a Jew seconds.
Mr. Schell said this was important, as
Mrs. Finnecan had detailed a conversation
Hint would take live minutes by the watch
to read.
On cross-examination by Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Black it was admitted by
Mr. Duhem that he was one of Turner's
bondsmen in a former trial and was very
friendly with him.
Mrs. Duhem testified that she heard
Mrs. Finnecai* tay sho hoped to see Turner
behind the bars.
Further hcarinjr of the case was post
poned for one week.
Sunday Excursions

to scant accomodations, but not so to
pleasure seekers bound for El Campo.
The big "Ukiah" makes iour round trips

tendent Webster to elect a committee from
their number, who. shall for one year have
power â â  to decide what annuity, if any,
teacher shall be entitled to if retired. That
this committee shall b| independent is the
cause of much solicitude among the teachers.
CLINTON HUNGRY
FOR STATISTICS
The Supervisor Makes An
other Demand Upon the
Spring Valley.
With an Expert He Will New
Examine the Company's
Books.
T?x-Payers Again Address the Water
Ccmmittee oa Behalf of a R*>
duction of Ra'es.
Chairman Clinton of the Supervisors'
Water Committee expressed himself as
being put out yesterday because the
Spring Valley Company had not supplied
him with certain statistics regarding its
income, which statistics he had hoped
would assist the committee in fixing the
new water rates. More than this, he in
sisted that the figures should bo pro
duced, and a special meeting of the com
mittee will probably have to be called in
order to examine themâ if they are sur
rendered by tne company.
This was the closing feature *of yester
day's meeting of this committee, which,
as every one knows, has been struggling
along for weeks in its efforts to become
familiar with the water question and be
able to make some intelligent recommen
dations to the board.
Mr. Booker, the water company's chief
accountant, was on hand, ana it was he
who was supposed to bring alons the sta
tistics and who confessed that he had not
done so. What Dr. Clinton wanteu was
the average income of the company from
the 25-cent and 50-cent rate-payers. These
are the poor people, or small property
owner?, and it is they Clinton wants to
benefit most by a reduction of rates.
Hooker explained that ho did not keep
his Dooks with an idea to be minute in the
matter of details. He could not possibly
furnish the exact income from these par
ticular rate-payers. He could, however,
give the bulk profits.
This was not, what Dr. Clinton wanted
and it was then that Attorney Kellogg,
who represented the Spring Valley, iu
vited the chairman of the committee to
inspect the company's books for himself.
Dr. Clinton saul he would accept the in
vitation, but gave notice that he would be
accompanied by an expert accountant.
Prior to this discussion the committee
was addressed by several gentlemen who
hope to see the water rates very materially
reduced by the Supervisors. W. R. Sher
wood sj>oke first, devoting his remarks
chiefly 10 disapproving of the sentiments
contained in a communication recently
sent to the Supervisors by John T. Doyle.
The latter was opposed to a reduction of
the water company's income on the
ground that the City owed its existence to
the water supply.
Thomas Magee, the well-known real
estate dealer, also spoke against high water
rates. A reduction, he said, was impera
tive. San Francisco was already taxed to
death, and taxes were still rising higher.
"Why, irentlemen," said Mr. Magoe, "if
you and I were as sure of getting to heaven
as we are that taxes will continue to rise,
we would need to have no worry on that
point."
Charles Belden and a Mr. Woodman
spoke in ji similar vein, and then after the
set-to between Dr. Clinton and Mr. Booker
the committee aitjourned.
MISSION PAEK QUESTION.
The Improvement Union Favors the
Cemeteries Site.
A meeting of the executive committee of the
Mission Improvement Union was held yester-"
day afternoon at the olnoe of Judge F. W. Van
Ri'ynegom, 26 Montgomery street, at wtilch.
was discussed the question oi a park for the
Mission.
A. P. Van Duzer itated ho was heartily In
favor of the propositloT to have the City pur
ctiHse 1000 acres of land for a park and zou
logicnl gardens auywtiere out ill the south
western section. But as this projtct would
not give the Mission people a proper recrea
tion ground for their wives and children
Without the necessity of paying carfare he
favored the purchasing of the cemeteries, as
described In The Call of last Sunday.
This site, he said, was already laid out, and
all that wmfl necessary was to sow seed and
plant inch shrubbery and rosebushes as would
beautify the puce.
The project of the larger park was so remote
that it would take from twenty-five to thirty
years to get it into anything like park shape-
Besides, $1,000,000 would have to D 3 ex
pended upou it, which he considered the peo
ple of this City could not afford at the present
lime.
George Wai com coincided with the views of
Van Duzer, but thought the Mission was en
titled to a park of ten glgautic proportions
than the one spoken about, which would,
when established, be more in the line of r
State or coast undertaking, as the zoological
collection itself would become National.
Daniel Webster Kelly suggested that by a
selection of plants the proposed two-block
park which lies In front of the High School
could be used as a botanical school for the
student* attending '-hat institution. There
are filieen acres of land there, upon which
quite a number of piftaU could be planted.
Judge Van Reynegom iavored this view and
added tliatno place about i-ati Francisco was
t-o well adapted by climatic influence for the
growth of exotic "plants as the locality men
tioned. He favored the greater park, but
agreed with Van Duzor as to the time, and ex
pense it would lake to bring the project to
maturity.
John Bolgcr, John A. Lennon and J. C.
Young expressed themselves as being in har
mony witn the previous speakers.
On motion the committee was instructed to
call ii general nieetingof the Mission Improve
ment Union for Saturdny evening, May 8, at
Mission Improvement Hall, Twentieth Â«u:d
Guerrero streets, at which Professor George
Hanson, a landscape architect from Berkeley
University, and Dr. Miller oi ihe Mission
would be present to deliver addresses upon the
psrk question.
The Mission people are unanimous in their
opinion that they nre cntitlad to a public
park â just oue sufficiently large where their
wives and children can enter and inhale the
fresh air without the uecessity ot going lour
miles to Golden Gate Park.
They also claim that they have been
neglected sadly dv the early City authorities
when surveying and laying out the Mission,
thai no provision hr.a been made for public
squares. The Western Addition, which was
scaled and built on long after the Mission
had been improved, has numerous narks, with
the additional one of the Golden Gate at con
venient distance. The catirj Eleventh Ward
has only two or .three unimproved lots at a
remote "distance from the .settled center.
Another convincing argument to be made
by those who will urge the park question is
the araoun t of taxable property lying adjacent
to where the people want a park. To this must
be added the laci of the large voting popula
tion of tho Mission.

STILL HOPE FOR
FRESNO'S RAISINS
W. Forsyth Thinks the
Crop Will Be About
4000 Cars.
The Thrip Will Not Hurt the
Vines More Than Five
Per Cent.
Gcod Outlook fcr Grain and Mcst of
the Fruits â Business in
the Valley.
W. Forsyth, the widely known and
prominent raisin-grower of Fresno, is in
this City on a business trip. He was seen
yesterday at the Occidental and asked as
to the raisin ana fruit outlook. He said:
"The Tines never looked better, and tbe
prospects are that we will have a very
large crop. Tho thrip that has been talked
about, news of which was telegraphed
from Fresno, caused the growers some
alarm, as they came earlier than usual.
But they have npt done any damage to
amount to anything. It won't be 3 per
cent, or certainly not more than 5 per
cent.
"The thrip were called hoppers by some,
and a pood many people in this part of
California thought they were grasshop
pers, but there* were no grasshoppers
there. Professor Woodward of the Hor
ticultural Experiment stations of the
State University was sent down to make
an investigation as to the work of the
parasite. He decided it didn't amount to
any thine and he canio back.
"From all indications, there will be &
heavy crop of raisins in Fresno County
this year. About Fresno the condition ol
the "vines is ail thut could be well de
sired. Last year we shipped 3200 ten-ton
cars of raisins, and thÂ»re are about 200
cars of the crop yet on hand.
"I tninK there will be 750 ten-ton cars
more this year than last according to pres
ent indications. I his will be short of the
crop of tbe year before, which was some
thing over 4200 cars. If get a little
more rain, as we are almost sure to do, we
will have a greater raisin product even
than the amount estimated now.
"Nearly all kinds of crops there are
looking well. Apricots have been consid
erably damaged, but tbe indications are
there will be as many as there were last
year. Peaches are light. Wheat, and
other grain will be ahead of last year, even
if there is no rain. One rain would in

Break linwn the N'ervoui System of a
Well-Known Railroad Engineer.
What Built Him Up Again.
From the Gazette, ChiUicothe, Ohio.
lir. Elbridpe Waterman is a we'l-known rail
j road engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio
i Southwestern Railway, who has been a great
I sufferer irom nervous debility of an aggra
; vaied kind for the past teu years. The strain
i was telling on his nerves terribly, and sternly
; work was impossible. The loliowing is his
story: ..â  â¢
"For (he past tea years," he said, "I have
suffered as lew men have with nervousness.
i heart trouble ami rheumatism. I have lived
i on the footboard most of my life, and the con-
I stant joltine laid nervous strain slowly but
] surely undermined my constitution. I was
forced to quit work, and there seemed to be
little prospect of my going back to the throttle
again. I tried every remedy that 1 could find,
but none of them did me any good. 1 con
sulted doctors all over the country, but to no
I avail. I would be better for a time, and then
! would come on an attack more severe than
j ever, and I would have to quit work. The
j money I have spent during that time for doc-
I tors and medicine, none of which did me any
- I permanent good, would place me now out of
I want and in comparative' affluence if I had it.
I An idea of how much time and money I lost
maybe gained when I tell you that during
last summer alone I was totally unable to
j wort four months on a stretch, and was much
of the time confined to the house and to the
bed, sometimes unable to move. It makes me
; cold all over when I look back on what I have
| gone through.
! "But rheumatism was not the only thing I
; suffered from. My heart troub'ed me very
i much, and I was totally unab.e to sleep for
a , ys and weeks at a time. When I would drop
off into a doze my heart would beat itself al
| most, out of my bosom, and would wake me up
as though I had been struck by a trip hummer.
I had twichings in my arms and legs, and was
altogether in such a condition that my wife
' I and friends began to consider me beyond
reach of medical assistance.
"I was ; almost of the same opinion myself,
when I happened to see in the paper last June
a letter from an old soldier in the West who
I had been cured of rheumatism by Dr. Wil
liams' Pink Pills. The testimonial was writ
ten in such a way that I knew it was not a
faked-up one, and I determined to give this
. medicine a fair trial. I was uneble to work
at the time, and almost in despair. So I went
to the drugstore ana bought six. boxes of
| them, in order to eive them a thorough test,
i and in a few days I Began to feel the improve
! ment they, were worKing in my system. In
two weeks ; I was able to go to work, and I
have worked ever since without a lay-off,
which is something I have not done for year*.
"The first improvement I noticed was in my
heart, which grew more and more normal in
its action, until at last it did not trouble me
at all, and I was able 'to sleep, as I had not
been able for ten years. The heart trouble
has never returned, and my sleep for the past
two months has been healthy add deep. .Last
night I went to bed early and slet>t soundly
until 8 o'clocK this morning. And now, when
I wake up, I feel invigorated and : ready lor
the clay's work, just as I used to feel when I
was a boy. - â¢ " : â " â  â 
-. "The nervous twitching were also cured in
a short t.me, and have never returned or both
ered me in the least since. Tins has also been
a great relief to me, as the twitching* were
, very annoying, as well as an indication to
everyone of the .erriDle condition in which
my stat;e of health was. Ai>d;the greatest
wonder of all is that the rheumatism seems to
be cured also, and does not botiier me in the
least'- any more, except when I expose myself
unduly, and even then only for>a short time.
I consider myself a well man now. and hope
to continue so. I am still taking Pink Pilis,
for I want the ' cure to be a complete and per
manent one. I only wish I baa known them
years ago, l or 1 would have saved myself large
sums of money, as well as suffering for which
no money could repay." , '

WALDTEUFEL ACQUITTED.
Blame : in a Smuggling Case Laid
' on the Shoulders of His Dead
Father.
J. A.Waldteufol was tried before a jury in
judge Morrow's court yesterday on a
charge of having defrauded the Govern
ment out of $24, the duty on three
statuettes of religious subjects.
Waldtoufel and his father kept a Catho
lic book and music store on Market
street, in this City, and sold statu
ettes for church purposes. The statuettes
were passed through the Custom-house on
the representation that they were not for
sale, but, designed fora cnurcb in the in
terior. Revenue officials found the
statuettes exposed for sale in Waldtouiel'a
show-window. .
On the morning nfter the discovery the
fattier of the defendant cooiniiued sui
cide.
Young Waidteufel was defended by
Colonel JaniP 1 ; P. Pniith, and his defense
wsa to the effect that NVaidteufel Sr. in
duced his son to insert the three statuettes
in the permit, representing to him that
they had been purchased for use in a
church.
The jury returned .1 verdict of not guilty,
and the prisoner was discharged.
Preserved fruits, in a state fit to ba
eaten, have been taken from the ruins of
Hercuianeum.

RELY UPON KAARSBURG.
Berkeley's Hope in the Basebiil
Game to Be Played
To- Day.
Ai Dep.'nds on the Condition of the
Pitcher for tbe Ci i
fornias :
BERKELEY, Cat.., April 30.â The con
dition of Pete Kaarsburg is the all-absorb
ing topic of discussion in Berkeley to
night. It is generally thought that if he
Ditches op to bis standard of two weeks
ago Berkeley will win to-morrow's base
bail game, the decisive one of the season,
from Stanford.
The rest of the blue and gold team are
players all expert in their places. With
Kaarsburg in good form the present Cali
fornia nine is declared to be the best that
Berkeley ever had. Two weeks ago the
men played an errorless game and since
then have practiced diligently under
Coachers Nott and Cohen and with the
exception of Hoag, center fielder, all are
in first-class condition. Hoar's injured
linger i 3 much improved, bnt is still sore!
and may cause him pain in catching flies, \
but he is a steady, sure and plucKy player J
and it is confidently expected that he will j
put up his usual game.
If Berkeley win?, the blue and gold will \
l.nve achieved a season victory, tbe lirst ;
since 1892, and will have a chance for the j
s iver trophy offered by the University!
If the cardinal is victorious the |
v will go permanently to Palo A; to. i
The California team will be as follows:
Kaarsburg, pitcher; Wheeler, catcher; :
Hrnnessy, first base; Elston, second bate; ,
Krug, third base; Kuster, t-hortatop;
Sykea, right field; Hoag, center field;
McLaren, left field.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1897.
WILL TUNNEL IF
IT BE POSSIBLE
Merchants Unite on a
Plan to Cross the
Estuary.
Opposed to the Building ol Any
Bridges at All Across
the Haibor.
The Matter Clearly Set Forth in
Colonel Bridges' Report to the
Board of Trad-.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) â 
SOB Kroartway, April 30. j
It was decided to-night that on Monday
next the important project of building a
tunnel beneath the estuary, instead of a
bridge, will be formally presented to the
Supervisors by tne joint committee of the
Merchants' Exchange and the Board of
Trade.
Colonel Lyman Bridges, engineer to the
Board of Trade, has just completed his
plans and figures and they were consid
ered in detail to-day.
The cost of the tunnel will not exceed
$.09,000 according to the plans. The follow
ing statement of the engineer, which will
be presented to the Supervisory covers the
whole of the present situation regarding
Oakland, Alameda and the Southern Pa
cific Company, for the first time. It was
prepared in the form of a resolution so
that it need not be changed and no time
need be wasted in discussing it. It reads:
Whereas, The two bridges across the estu
ary of Sail Antonio, or Oakland Harbor, as it
is now called, are an obstruction to naviga
tion and a hindrance to the growth, and pros
perity of Alameda County and to the cities of
Ottkland and Alameda in particular; and
whereas, the United States Government has
demanded that before July, 1898, there shall
not be less than 150 ieet clear on each side of
the center piers of said bridges when the
draws thereof are open, thus virtually com
pelling the removal of the present bridges;
and whereas, the conditions and cir
cumstances iti force at tho time when
the railroad bridge across the harbor at the
foot of Alice street was permitted have so
changed tnat there is uo longer a necessity
for any railroad bridge whatever across said
Oakland i.arbor; and whereas, there is no in
justice to the railroad company in our urging
the abandonment oi tueir Alice-street bridge,
tliey using instead a third rail on iheir nar
row-gauge trflck on Pacific avenue to Park
street, and using the narrow-gauge pier for ail
Alameda traffic, with broad-gauge trains
on their Fruitvale route on Purk street,
adding also a third rail to the

BADLY BURNED.
James H. Kom Jr., a Fainter, Meets
With :\ Terrible Accidentâ lt
May Prove Fatal.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 30â James H.
Ross Jr., a painter, was terribly burned at
the residence of W. R. Van Brunt, at 1727
Encinal avenue, this afternoon by the
catching tire of a mixture of wax and tur
pentine which he was heating on a stove
for use. In some way the atnff caught
{ire, probably by boiling over, and the
flÂ»me3 were quickly communicated to the
woodwork of the kUcncn. Ross saw the
tire and at once rushed into the house.
He seized the mixture, which was in a
blaze, and ran int" the yard with it. In
an instant after reaching the open air
Ross was enveloped in flames, which cov
ered him from head to foot. Instead of
throwing himself on the ground and roll
ing to extinguish the flames, he b?came
frantic and ran about the yard screaming
for help.
Just as Ross ran from the burning house
a little cnild of the Van Brunts was run
ning into the building and was in immi
nent danger of catching lire. A carpenter
named J. Chalmers, who was at work on
the house, ran to the scene, and, seeing
t lie little one. grabbed it just in time to
prevent it from coming in contact with
Ross and his flaming clothes. Having
put the child in a place of safety, ho went
immediately to Ross' assistance, and aiaed
in extinguishing the flames, after whicti
be took part in patting out the fire In the
house. Medical aid v/as at once sum
moned for Ross and all wa* done that was
possible. After the burns had been dressed
he was taken to the sanitarium on San
Jose avenue for treatment. He is very
seriously injured and suffers terribly, and
if, as probable, he inhaled any of the fire
his condition will be c-iticol.

cious just at this time to state what would
induce them to come into Oakland.
E. A. Heron, chairman of the commit
tee which hns in charge the matter of ob
taining definite ideas from the Valley
road, says the letter indicates a desire on
the part of tlio directors not to act hastily.
"In this matter, which is a hie undertak
ing," said Mr. Heron, "we can ensiy see
that it would not be wise for the Valley
road to disclose its private business, and
to a certain extent our negotiations with
them must therefore bn of a confidential
nature. We feel convinced that the road
people are willing to be very candid with
us when they are assured that pending
negotiations will not be Indiscriminately
made public. This is good business fore
sight, and in a few days we shall no doubt
arrive at some definite understanding."

BEATS A RUNAWAY.
Scrambles Into the Wagon

A Piucky Acticn on Broadway
That Was Witnessed by a
Large Crowd.
fbo Little Fellow Rin a Furious
Racj and Came Out More Than

Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
yt)B Broadway, April 30. f
Jakey Baurcgarten was the hero of
Broadway at noon to-day. He succeeded
in stopping a lively runaway in a very
clever fashion and at the same time prob
ably saved a couple of lives. Most cer
tainly he saved a serious accident.
Just at noon, when the streets were
crowded with people going to their lunch,
a horse and wagon came tearing up Broad-
way from Seventh street. The animal had
evidently taken fright while its driver was
away from the wagon and being un
hitched it tore away up Broadway at a
lively jrait.
Jakey was standing at the corner of
iiightii and Broadway when the animal
rushed past. Some of the passers-by in a
spirit of jest said to him: "Catch thnt,
Jukey." A second later Jakey v,-aa half
way across the Btreet and pursuing that
iiorae ana wagon at a speed which would
give him first prize in any athletic contest
on Berkeley's carupus.
For a couple , of blocks the chase was
kept up, and Jakey gradually decreased
tne distance between himself and the tail
of the wagon. -Near Tenth street Jakey
put on a spurt and got his hands on the
rear of the wagon, ami with a few springs
he tumbled into it. He seemed to land on
his head and shoulders, but before an
other second had elapsed Jakay had
scrambled his way along to the seat and
was graspin*: for the reins.
Just at this instant a woman and child
came out of the drugstore on the corner
and were about to cross the road before
noticing the runaway. Hundreds of peo
ple yelled to them to step back, but it
only had the effect of confusing. them and
causing them to look the wrong way. A
few more steps and they would undoubt
edly have been under the horse's feet;
but just, in the nick of time Jakey tugged
1 on the reins with sufficient force to check
i the animal and turn it across the road be-
I fore the woman realized the danger to
which she had been exposed.
Jakey drove the wagon back the way it
had come, turned it over to its owner and
was rewarded with the munificent sum of
two bits. ; ;0 ': V

PRISONERS AND GUARD ALL DRUNK
Disgraceful Scene in P.
Schulfz's Saloon at
Sunnyside.
BLOODY FIGHT FOR HALF
AN HOUR.
Ben Cleary, a Guard, and Five
Prisoners Refused More
Liquor.
THE STORE AND BAR ALMOST
WRECKED.
Sennit* Yesterday Lodged a Claim
With the Sheriff for $100
Damages.
P. Schultz, a grocer and saloon-keeper
at San Jose road and Sunnyside, put in
a claim to Sheriff Whelan yesterday for
$100, for damages done to his premises
and stock by Ben Cleary, a guard at the
House of Correction, and five prisoners
last Tuesday afternoon.
Cleary was in charge of the five prison
ers, who were engaged in making repairs
on the Corbett road. On their return
journey that afternoon to the House of
Correction about 4 q'clock they pulled up
their wagon in front of Scnultz's saloon,
and Cleary and four of the prisoners dis
mounted and entered the bar. One of
them, an elderly roan, remained in the
wagon.
After Cleary and the four prisoners en
tered the bar Clear? tnrew a two-bit piece
on the counter and called for beer.
Scbuiiz alleges thatthey were ailconsider
nbly under the influence of liquor, and he
declined to serve them with the beer.
Cleary was arguing with Scnultz, when
one of the prisoners went outside and told
t!ie man in the wagon to get down and
have some beer, making use of an offen
sive expression.
The old prisoner got mad, and on en
tering ihe saioon declared that he would
allow no man to insult him by calling
him a vile name. Cleary ordered him to
'^slmt his mouth," and he struck CiÂ«ary
with his fi^-t.
One of the prisoners had a large milk
bottle in his hand, and when he saw
Cleary struck he hit the old man on the
heaa with the bottle, knocking him down.
This was the commencement of a gen
eral light that lasted over haif an hour.
The milk-bottle was freely used, and when
the tight was over they were all covered
with blood, and Schultz's bar aud grocery
in the front looted as If they haa been
visited by a cyclone. The floor was cov
ered with blood, and packages of coffee,
tea, sugar and other articles were strewn
around.
A man who happened to be in the bar
attempted to piay the part of a psace
jnaker, but one blow on the head with the
milk-bottle knocked him senseless and he
was dragged to a roam in the rear by
Schultz, where he recovered conscious
ness in about an hour.
The prisoners not only destroyed the
shelving in the grocery, but they went
oat to the rear and tore down one of the
outhouses. Schultz also alleges that they
stole about a dozen packages of coffee.
Schultz notified Superintendent Clark
son of tne House of Correction of the dam
age incurred, and as the superintendent
gave him no satisfaction he went to the
Sheriff's office yesterday and put in his
claim for $100, and he was told the matter
â would be investigated.
Schultz was seen yesterday afternoon
and talked ireeiy of the occurrence, as he
feels very indignant at the treatment he
received from Cieary and the prisoners.
"It is not alone tvs damage do:Â»e to my
place," naid Schultz, "that I angry about,
but it is the injury to my business. 1
have a wife and family and Keep a respect
able place, and this disgraceful affair has
certainly jnjuredme anu my business.
"They were all drunk when they en
tered my place Tuesday afternoon, and
Cleary was the worst of tne lot. When
he threw the 25-cent piece on the counter
and asted for rive beers, I quietly told him
they had had enough and they wouldn't
get any beer from me. They might
have gone away, but one of them, an
old-looking man who had been in the
wagon, came in and said he wouldn't
allow any one to call him a vile name.
Cleary told him to shut up, and then the
right commenced. A big man with a
largo milk-bottle in his hand used it upon
the beads of the others, and whenever
one of them was getting the better of
Cleary, crack went the bottle on his head
and down he fell.
"I wa3 at mv wits' end, as I did not
kDow what to do. My wile, with a baby
iv her arms, hearing the uproar, came to
see what was the trouble and when she
saw the men covered with blood and fight
ing she nearly fainted. She was afraid for
me and I was afraid for her.
"I did all I could to stop them, but as 1
was afraid to come from behind the bar
my voice had no effect upon them. A
man waom I know only as Jack, but wno
ib a br(Hber-in-law of the chief engineer at
the power-house, tried to quail the row,
but ne was hit on the head with the milk
bottle and knocked senseless. I jumped
from behind the bar and dragged him into
a rear room and kept him there until he
recovered consciousness.
â¢'They knocked tfown the shelving on
which my goods are stocked and carried

away about a dozen packages of coffee.
Smart, tne milkman along the road, found
two of the packages in front of his liobse
next morning, where they had been
thrown, and brought them to me. .
"The electric-cars stop at the switch in
front of my place and people on the cars
saw the disgraceful tizht. CHher people
who were attracted by the noise also saw
it. and among them was a guard at the
House of Correction, but I don't know
his name.
"Wriy. they were not satisfied with the
destruction they made in my store and
oar, but they went to the rear and de
stroyed one of the outhouses. I seriously
thought they would .wreck the whole
place, as they acted more like devils than
men.
'â¢I have plenty of witnesses besides my
wife who: will prove what I say is the
truth, and I mean to be reimbursed for
the loss 1 have sustained.
"If Cleary bad come to me next mornine
and apoioirized and paid for tbe damage I
would have said nothing about it, but he
has never come near me. I sent word to
Superintendent Clarkson, bat he took no
notice of it, so I thought the best thing I
could do was to go straight to the Sheriff.
ClarKson now wants me togoand see him,
out if he wants to see me he knows where
to tiud me
"I have no idea where they got the
liquor before they came to mv place, but
they were certainly drunk. What puzzles
me is where they got the money."
It is understood that Superintendent
Clarkson intends to prefer charges against
Cleary, but Cleary was at his post la the
institution yesterday.

Has a Wide Reputation as a

With Him
Rev. Isidore Myers has accepted the
call of the Congregation Otabai Shalome,
which worships at the Bush-street
Temple, and will eater upon his duties on
the Ist of August.
Negotiations looking to the engagement
of the eloquent rabbi have been in prj
press for about two months, and have been
mainly conducted by Joseph Schmidt, the
president of the board of irusiees ot the
congregation. They wens fortuitously
consummated yesterday by the receipt of
a telegram by Mr. Schmidt from tne rey
erena gentleman accepting the call and
the terms and conditions offered. \V'hile
the engagement of the now minister will
date from July 1, the board has gener
ously conceded him a month's grace for
JOSEPH SCHMIDT, President of the Congtz gatton of the Bush
Street Temple.
traveling to his new field of duty, and
for getting properly settled in his changed
environment.
Rabbi Isidore MyerÂ« is at present the :
spiritual leader of the Congregation Shaar
Hashumayiru, the most prominent Jewish I
religious body of Montreal, Canada. Al- i
thonÂ«h lie is but 38 years of age, he has, \
according to reporr, earned a reputation j
for eloquence and learning that a man of I
niaturer years might well be proud of.
He hap been an ordained rabbi for quite
a numbarof year?, but has not continu
ously lectared from the pulpit since his I
entrance in the ministry. For some time ,
he devoted his oratorical powers in a
purely non-sectarian manner and en
gaged in a lecture tour, which took him
to all the principal Eastern cities or the
United States anu London. Everywhere
he went his abilities were recognized and
appreciated and he was invariably greeted
by large audiences.
About a year ago he abandoned the
rostrum and returned to the pulpit,
talcing charge of the Montreal congrega
tion previously mentioned.
Ever since the resignation of Rabbi
Fryer the congregation of the Bush-street
temple has been quietly on the looKout
for a spiritual instructor for their syna
gogue, and when reports of Rabbi Myers'
abilities reach them negotiations were
opened with him. After considerable cor
respondence a satisfactory agreement was
reached, and his formal election for a
term of one year will take place at the
meeting of tne board of trustees to
morrow.
In a recent letter received from Rabbi
Myers he siated that he was bom wife
less, but intimated that he was in antici
pation of shortly changing his jonely con
dition by taking unto himself as a wife
the daughter of a lellow-rabbi. It is
therefore highly probable that his journey
from far-off Montreal to the siiores of
the Golden West will partake of the cnar
acter of a honeymoon trip.

PLANNING
FOR A GREAT
PLAYGROUND
Supervisors May Furnish
a Rival to Golden
Gate Park.
MANY SITES NOW UNDER
CONSIDERATION.
Discussed at the Meeting of
the Street Committee
Yesterday.
LAKE MERCED PROPERTY IS
TALKED OF.
Other Public Domains to Be Improved
and BeautifieJ in the Nsar
Future.
Chairman Devany and the other mem
bers of the Street Committee of the Board
of Supervisors are quietly but rabidly
gathering information and figures for use
in one of the biggest enterprises ever at
tempted by a Board of Sapervisors of this
City.
It is no less than the establishing of a
series of magnificent parks within the
City limits, one of which is to be of mag
nificent size and to rival the Golden Gate
Park in point of improvements and scenic
advantages.
The matter was discussed at a meeting
of the Street Committee, and the mem
bers spent some time examining maps for
suitable locations. One location that im
pressed them favorably was a tract of
land west of Laguna Honda and the
Almsnoupe. The scenery is romantic and
the land admirably snited for such a pur
pose. South of Ing eside was also looked
into, the idea being that such a location
could be easily reached and the land
easily obtained.
Then a tract embracing the Laguna
Puerta, which lies just north of the La
guna do la Mereed Rancho, was con
sidered, the Idea being to include the lake
for the purpose of boatiue and a place for
stocking with fish and wild fowl.
The public domain that skirts Mountain
Lake and the Ciiy cemeteries tracts were
also looked into. Tne bigt/est project,
that of paining possession of the Lazuna
de la Merced and its surroundings, was
broached last ana the Supervisors dis
cussed it Jong and earnestly.
Supervisors Has Line and Smith were
much impressed with the idea, and Mr.
Devany suid that he thought the Spring
Valley Conif any, after it had arranged its
sources of sui ply so as to be free of the
necessity of catling on Merced Lake water
in case of an emergency, would bo willing
to part with the lake lor a reasonable con
sideration. JNo action was taken, but it t
was understood that as soon as the neces
sary data are in the possession of the coiii
mit'.ee the matrÂ»r will be presented to the
board and an effort made to have the City
acquire several park sites, either by pur
chtt'e or condemnation.
"It is high time," said Chairman De
vany, "that this City was provided with
more pleasure ground* where the citizens
get away from the roar of streetcars and
bnsinesÃ. Golden Gate Park is a beauti
ful place, but it is not enough. There
should be several to give variety to those
who cannot afford to go out of the City
on Sunday.
"It is only a question of time when the
City must purchase park sites, and it
should be done now while property can
be nad at a reasonably low fisure. Twenty
yeara from now hind will come so high
that it will be difficult to buy it at prices
that the City could aftord to pay. It
would be a fine investment for the City,
for it would not only enhance the value
of real estate holdings by taking a large
tract out of the market, but would so
beautify the City as to add to its value as
a nlace of residence.
"I think that the majority of the board
will be in fivor of such v matter and that
we will hay- another big playground be
fore lon:.'. We :il-o propose to take a
number of tracts already owned by the
City and improve and beautify them so
that they will be places worth visiting.
"The pubiic will no doubt appreciate
the value of parks and will stand by us
in our endeavors to furnish them."
A SUDDEN STROKE.
Thomas M. Jewett Reported at the
Point or Death in Chi
huahua.
Mrs. Thomas M. Jcwett of this City re
ceived a telegram from Chihuahua, Mex
ico, announcing that her husband bad
been stricken with paralysis at that place
and was on the point of death. Mrs.
Jewett will start for Chihuahua to-riay.
Mr. Jewett lias been clerk for the United
States Attorn* v in this City for nearly
forty years. He went to Chihuahua a
short time ago on leave of absence on ac
connt of failing health, and at the time
he was stricken with paralysis was at his
brother's house in that place.
Charged With Forgery.
Moses M. Barnet, formerly business man
ager and managing editor of the Journal of
Commerce, surrendered himself to Chief of
Police Lees yesterday afternoon and was re
leased by Judge Campbell on nig own recogni
zance. A warrant on complaint of D. J.
O'Leary, proprietor oi the paper, had been
issued on January 13 of this year charging
Barnet with forgery, the allegation being that
he had without autnority signed the name of
the firm to subscription slips.
Barnet denies that he is puilty of Â»ny crime
and alleges that he had authority to sign the
firm name. There has bonn a disagreement
between Barnet and O'Leary for many months
concerning the business, and Barnet n-cently
tiled a suit against the paper for .fIOOO ai
leged to bo due him ior services.

THE LABOR COUNCIL.
The Japanese Question and. Others of
Importance Given Lengthy
Consideration.
At last night's session of the San Francisco
Labor Council a communication was read from
Senator White, in which he stated that in
reference to the employment of A. Francisco
in the office of Collector of tho Port at Los
Angeles he would have no authority, as tne
appointment would be controlled from Repub
lican soiirces. White added that Francisco has
no stock in the Los Angeles Times, unless he
acquired it very recently, as he happened to
know.
W. N. Anderson, secretary and treasurer of
the Anchor Milling Company, wrote that, in
contradiction to the opinion of the union,
that company is not opposing organized labor
in any form whatever. In a strike of a year
ago, he stated, a crew of lourteen union pack
ers had gone out, and, as they refused abso
lutely to return, the employment of non
union men was founa to be a necessity.
Afterward these union men had signified their
desire 10 return, and had been employed as
fast as vacancies occurred. The letter was
ordered sent to the American Federation of
Labor.
â  Secretary Rosenberg satu he was in receipt
of a letter and a blunt petition from Secretary-
James Coffin of the Alametla Sugar Company. '
requesting that signatures be procured to be
forwarded to ('oneress requesting me abroga
tion of the "Hawaiian reciprocity treaty."
Tnerenpon the council set itself on record as
opposing the abrogation ot the treaty. â â¢;
In response to an inquiry acting Secretary
Roosevelt of the Navy Department informed
the council that under existing laws the
power of Government contractors to employ
foreigners on Government worts is not cir
cumscribed and that, therefore, nothing can
be done in the case of the Union Ironworks,
alleged to employ Japanese in the construc
tion of United States men-of-war.
The secretary of the council was instructed
to gather all the data at his command and
forward the same to the American Federation
of Labor, which is now endeavoring to have
legislation of this kind enacted. Considerable
talk of holding a mass-meeting resulted.
Tne secretary oi tne Brewers' Union, J.
Waters, reported that he bad visited many
Southern California cities and towns and had
succeeded in forming a brewers' union in San
Diego. He said tne San Diego Brewery is now
a thorough union brewery, using the union
label. In Los Angeles, he added, the local
Labor Council has' taken the matter up and is
sanguine of organizing the brewers of that
city in the near future.
