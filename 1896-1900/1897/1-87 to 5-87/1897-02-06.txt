Eut the Ex- Militia Commander Makes
a Clear Explanation of His
Actions.
â¢ SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. s.â Senator
Bulla to-day carried out his interesting
programme as outlined in The Call this
morning. He paid bis compliments to the
"paid attorney" of the title insurance
companies of San Francisco, and thereby
gained a decided victory for his bill for
the certification of land titles and the sim
plification of real estate transfers, popu
larly known as the Torrens Act.
The incidents connected with the pas
sage of the bill, after it had once been de
feated, were the sensation of the day. It
was in the air that something unusual was
to transpire, and the attendance was the
. largest thus far seen in the Senate cham
ber. Among the interested spectators was
Colonel Thomas P. Barry, who, it was gen
era! known, was to be the object of Sena
tor Bulla' attack.
Bulla opened the debate for the final
passage of his bill, confining himself
- strictly to the merits of the bill.
Gillette, who led the fight against it on
tile occasion of its deleat, again took the
"floor against it. I
. Boyce took a strong stand in favor of
the measure, Dickinson opposed it and
"Witbington and Stratton supported it.
Bulla closed the debate. He began by
.answering some of the arguments made
against his bill, but he was not Jon;; in
â¢petting down to the "roast." These were
his words : " "*â *** p ~. Mv
"Nov. gentlemen, there is one thing to
winch I want to refer on this fl >or. I
. kaow â I do not make the charge through
any malice or ill will, but I know that the
title insurance companies o San Jtran
cisco have had a man on the floor of this
House, and that this man is here this
morning to oppose the passage of this
bill.
* "I will not say anything more to you,
gentlemen, than this man said to me â
that he was here as the paid attorney of
the title insurance companies of San
Francisco, and when I asked him what
was the reason for their opposition to this
bill he said in perfect frankness, candor
' and truth that it was simply because they
deemed it against their private in lerests.
I asked him if he knew that there was a
statute against lobbying. He replied that
he was not a lobbyist â that he was a paid
attorney.
"I like that expression; it is a nicer
word than lobbyist, which carries to our
. roind the detestable figure of a man who
uses his influence, his mind and his might
for money to deleat legislation; to defeat
â¢ the will of the people. I thank the gen
tleman for the term, 'Paid attorney.'
There is another term that the gentleman
wiignt have made use of, which sounds
even less offensive than ' paid attorney.'
He might have said, 'I am the profes
sional representative of certain interests.'
That wound have sounded even better
than 'paid attorney.'
"N*ow, Senators, I appeal to you to
weigh the testimony that has been of
fered to you in the consideration of this
; bill. I appeal to you whether tho repu
table Senators on this floor are to be con
sidered or the paid attorneys are to be
heard. I know that Senators have been
worried and badgered by paid attorneys
and others, but I say that when a bill of
[this kind comes up you should not give
k< redence to this kind of appeal â to the as
sertions of the paid attorney of private
interests. 1 '
At the conclusion of Senator Bulla's
speech the roll was called on the bill, and
it was passed by the decisive vote of 25
aye* to 13 noeÂ«. Mwffi
When the time of the noon recess came,
there was an indignation of the San Fran
cisco Senators over the course of Senator
Bulla. It was decided to defend Colonel
Barry on the floor of the Senate during
ihe afternoon session on a question of
privilege, and Senator Wolfe was selected
â  a.i spokesman. But before the time for
reconvening came it was decided to let the
matter drop.
Subsequently Colonel Barry made the
following explanation of his position:
"I came up here as an attorney to rep
resent some searchers of titles of San Fran
cisco. I went to Senator Bulla and told
him that I was interested in this Torrens
act, and was to appear before the Judiciary
Committee when tho bill was under con
sideration. Senator Bulla replied the
lawyers on the Judiciary Committee did
Rot need the assistance of another lawyer
in this measure, and did not inform me
when the measure was coming before the
Judiciary Committee. It was taken up '
and disposed or before the Judiciary Com
mittee before I had an opportunity to be
beard.
I "I went to Senator Simpson and told
I'-nni that I thought I bad been treated tin- ;
f fairly, as through Senator Bulla Senator
Vnipson said that if he bad known that
1 was here he would have invited me be
fore the committee, as the Judiciary Com
mittee wanted to have the measure ex
. plained.
â¢'Not having an opportunity to go be
fore the committee I had to go to individ
ual Senators and explain that I was here
The San francisco Call
to represent certain interests in San Fran
cisco â the searchers of titleâ and that I
wanted to lay before them what I consid
ered to bs objections to the bill. That is
the only representation I made to any
Senator, and the only influence that I
usedâ simply to point out the constitu
tional vi.d other objections to the bill and
its doubtful efficiency. In so doing I
have not, I believe, violated any law or
been guilty of any professional impropri
ety. 1 think every Senator will vouch for
the fact that my conduct has been
straightforward and open.
"1 would like to say one thing more;
that is. when Senator Bulla asked me what
my interests were in the matter I told
him tt. at I was here as a paid attorney,
employed by certain searchers in
Francisco to oppose tne Torren* land aci
which he hud introduced."
PROPOSED REFORMS FOR CUBA.
Regarded as the Most Ccmprehensive
Home-Rule Measure That Spam
Can Grant.
MADRID, Spain, Feb. 5.â A full ab
stract of the proposed reforms for Cuba
and Porto Rico approved by the Queen
Resent will be promulgated to-moirow in
the official gazette. The Ministry regards
them as being as comprehensive a meas
ure of home rule as can be granted under
existing conditions. It is stated that
some of them infringe so much upon the
rights belonging to the Ministry in regard
to the colonies that it will be necessary to
submit them to the Cortes before they can
be put into effect.
The most striking features of the new
reforms â wnich have not yet been an
nounced â relate to the management of
the finances of Cuba. The Council of
Administration of thirty-live members
will be constituted as already announced,
of twenty-one members elected directly
by the people, nine chosen from the com
mercial and educational societies oi
Havana and five from ex-members of the
Cortes from Cuba who have bee.i elected
the greatest number of times. The Coun
cil of Administration is eiven large pow
ers in regard to the framing of the tariff
and the budget.
They are to frame the tariff within cer
tain fixed rules prescribe! by the home
Government, and subject to the condition
that a provisional tariff shall be promul
gated by tho Minister for the Colonies
pending the organization of the machinery
of the Cuban Government.
The essential condition upon which the
Government insists is that the differential
tariff of not more than 20 per cent in favor
of Spanish products shall De imposed upon
certain articles, principally articles of
Spanish manufacture.
The tariff will consist of two columns,
one being the uniform revenue rate levied
upon the products of all countries and the
other the differential rate in favor of
Spain levied upon certain articles to be
numed by the Government, but in no case
to exceed L'O per cent of the value of tne
article.
The proposed reforms deal also with the
question of reciprocity treaties, which
may be made for Cuba, distinct from
treaties reiatinc to Spain, and which will
be framed by tne home Government upon
consultation with the Cuban Council of
Administration.
Provisions were alÂ«o made for the ap
pointment of employes by the Governor-
General, who must be born Cubans or be
Spaniards who have resided at least two
years on the island. These appointments
will be made in most rases with the con
sent of the council of administration.
Provisions are also made for the exten
sion of the power of the municipal gov
erning boards and for the appointment of
municipal judges by the members of the
municipalities.
The new reforms are to co into effect as
soon as they have received the approval
of trie courts and as soon as the state of
the island will permit.

NOW FOR COYOTE
SCALP SCANDAL
An Unexpected Sensation
Sprung Before a Senate
Committee.
Bookkeeper McCalvy May Lose
H.s Head for Peculiar
Manipu'ations.
Fu^ilist "V nnÂ» Dv chy" and a Bakers
fhld Attorney Figure as Legis
lative Lobbyists.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. s.â An en
tirely unexpected sensation developed at
the meeting of the Senate Finance Com
mittee to-day in connection with the bill
appropriating $157.000 for the payment of
coyote claims from Kern County, which
involved one of the clerks in the office of
Secretary of State Br?wn, and at the same
time revived the scandal in connection
with these claims that was published in
The Call shortly after the end of the last
session of the Legislature.
It v.as then tout on lact.- obtained from
Governor Bndd how coyote scalps that
were brought into Bakersneld were
manipulated so as to be used over and
over a^-ain to obtain receii ts for them and
so loot the State treasury. Scalps were
brought in and were supposed to be
thrown into a stove and thus destroyed
after the scalp-taker had been given his
receipt. Instead, however, of being cast
into flames there was an arrangement by
which they fell behind a partition back of
the stove and were thus available for re
peaters.
During the present session there have
been two discreet lobbyists on the scene
seeking to gain support for these claims.
One of them is Fred Halstead, a former
pugilist better known as "Young
Dutcby," and an attorney from Bakers
field.
Everything was going along nicely for
them, and there seemed every prospect
that the bill would receive the unanimous
approval of the Finance Committee, when
an apparently casual inquiry started n
line of inquiry that changed the calm
atmosphere of the committee-room into
a storm of serious aspect.
Theu this story #as brought to the
knowledge of the committee: It was
known that the claim was to be brought
before the present Legislature, and a short
time after the session began George A.
McCalvy, bookkeeper in the office of the
Secretary of State, obtained a short leave
of absence and hied himself away to Bak
ersfielJ. He was aware of the nature of
tbe pending coyote-scÂ»lp claims and
thought he saw a cbancc to turn tbe tide
of affairs in bis favor; but. as events
proved, he misjudged the tide or the
tarn.
As the story is told, he left here happy
and expectant in the prospect of bringing
back not less than $1500, all for his own
profit. We had numerous conferences with
the coyote-bouuty claimants, bnt was un
able to convince them that his services in
their benalf were worth more than $150.
Senator Smith, who is one of the mem
bers of the Finance Committee and who
represents both Kern and San LuisObispo
counties, admitted that he had knowledge
of the state of affairs. He had been in
formed by telegrams of tlie fact that some
one from tbe Secretary of State's oflice
was in Bakersticld trying to negotiate bis
services. He said he knew the name of
tbe individual, but declined at this stage
to disclose his name.
The matter had now a most serious
phase, in view of tbe fact that the ac
cused person was employed in the oflice
of the Secretary of State and that the
latter was a member of tbe State Board of
i Â£xaminers, which has to pass on all
claims against the State before they are
allowed.
There was strong talking of going into a
thorough investigation of the matter,
summoning witnesses in this city and
from Bakersfield, but after considerable
heated debate it was decided to report in
favor, of the bill appropriating the $287,
--000.
There were nine out of the ten niem
ners comprising the committee present.
Those who voted in favor of the appro
priation are: Linder, Franck, Smith,
Henderson at;d Flint. Those who op
posed it are: Voorhei?, Wolfe. Luch
singer and La Rue. The absentee was
Lanuford.
There promises to be further interesting
developments, and there is a possibility
that the committee 'nay reconsider its
action and hjld ten investigation before
the bill is rpported back to the Senate. It
is admitted that mauy of the coyote
bounty claims are just, but to what ex
tent the fraud made known by the Gov
ernor has been practiced is not possible to
determine.
It is not for a moment suspected that
Secretary of State Brown is implicated
even in the faintest way with McCalvy's
action, and for that reason it is expected
ihat the head of the bookkeeper may be
cut off.
PLAGUE SCARE IN FRANCE.
| The Many Vessels Arriving From India
Cause a Panic at the Port
of Marseilles.
MARSEILLES, France, Feb. s.â Many
j vessels from India arrive at this port and
the ravages from tne plague in that coun
try have created a very lively fear that
some of them will be the means of intro
ducing the disease here.
The most vigorous precautions have
been taken by the authorities to guard
against such an occurrence, but nothing
they have done has s?rvod to allay the
panicky feeling that pervades all classes.
The amhorities have appealed to the
{ government at Paris to support them in
i their endeavors to prevent the disease
I from entering the city, but doubts have
â  been expressed as to whether the central
authorities will give their sanction to
some of the measures taken by ths local
officials through excess of fear.
The steamer Caledonia, bound for Lon
j don, arrived to-day from Bombay, having
on board seventy-seven passengers, a ma
jority of whom intended to travel over
land to England and thus escape thp dis
comfort and loss of time that would be
occasioned by continuing on the Cale
donia. The steamer had a clean bill of
health, but this fact had no weight with
the health officials, who forbade any of
the passengers to land. The appeals of
tlie pnxsengers from this decision were
I many, but the officials were obdurate and
| the passengers will be compelled to pro
ceed by sea to London.

Files a Petition With the Presi
dent-Elect to Be Sent as
Minister ti Colcmbia.
This Talented Lady Was the Pioneer
Suffragist in the State of
N.w Hampshire.
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. s.â Mrs. Manilla
M. Ricker, the well-known woman lawyer
and equal rightist of Washington and
Dover, N. H., has filed with .President
elect McKinley a petition for appointment
as Minister to the United States of Colom
bia, which position is now tilled by the
Hon. Luther .McKinney of Manchester,
N. H.
For some time Mrs. Ricker has been
collecting recommendations from influ
ential men. She is the first woman who
has ever aspired in any practical way to
the high position of an Embassador of the
United States. To a reporter to-day she
declared her determination to leave no
stone unturned in her quest for embassa
donal honors.
"I ask for the place," she said, 'Tor I
â¦liink the time has come when women
s'coulit be recognized in the diplomatic
service and because I believe I have ability
und strength of character enough to war
runt my appointment.
"If Luther McKinney can nil the posi
tion I am free to remark that I can over
flow it. lam not over-sanguine of getting
tlie appointment, of course, but I am
fjoing to be heard in the matter, and the
world shall know that one woman, at
least, has courage enough to undertake a
line of work hitherto left to the exclusive
prerogative of men."
Mrs. Ricker was admitted to the Su
preme Court of the District of Columbia
in 18S2, standing at the head of her class,
in which there were eighteen men. She
was admitted to practice before the Su
preme Court of the United States at Wash
ington in 1891. She opened the New
Hampihire bar to women in June, 1890.
As to ler political activity, she was the
first woman in the country who tried to
vote. In March, 1870, she went before the
Selectmen of Dover, N. H., and asked to
have her name put on the check-list. She
went to the "polls three days later and
offered ihe straight Republican ticket.
She has done much political work in New
Hampshire, lowa, California and Massa
chusetts. She stumped the west from
lowa to the Pacific Coast for Harrison
during the Harrison campaign.
Mrs. Kicker has done campaign work in
Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Lodi and Los
Angeles, California.

CANTON, Ohio, Feb. s.â Chairman
Mark Hanna spent three hours with Major
McKinley this afternoon, and then, con
trary to original expectations, returned to
Cleveland. Mr. Hanna said there was no
warrant for the report that he had ac
cented the position of Postmaster-General.
His talk with Major McKinley was a very
pleasant one, and it is believed by the
politicians Jiere that Mr. Hanna will ulti
mately yield to the desire of the President
elect to have him in his Cabinet.
There are no fresh developments in the
Ohio Senatorial situation, and Governor
Bushneil, who holds the key to it, re
mains mute respecting his intentions. He
has not said he would not appoint Chair
man Hanna to the Senate of the United
Btatea to succeed John Sherman, and on
the other hand he has given no one the
smallest reason to thitiK. ue would.
Logan C. Murray of Louisville, who was
here to-day, is authority for tbe statement
that General Aleer told him that Colonel
J. J. McCookof New York is a very strong
Cabinet possibility. Tbe impression pre
vails that Colonel McCook, who is a well
known lawyer, may be made Attorney-
General for the reason that hi 3 appoint
ment would not be opposed by either wing
of the Republican party in New York.
Judge Emory Spenr of Georgia is also
talked of as a Cabinet possibility, in case
General Goff of West Virginia does not
accept a portfolio. It is Major McKin
ley's wish to give the portfolio of the In
terior Department to Judce McKenna of
California, and this will probably be done.
J. Addisou Porter of Hartford, Major
McKinley's private secretary, came to

SOUTH CAROLINA'S VOTE.
There Will He n Prof at When the Home
He/jin* thn Count.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 5 âA Herald
special from Washington says: South
Carolina is preparing to spring a sensa
tion at the counting of the electoral vote
in the House of Representatives next
Wednesday, when the counting of her
vote for Bryan and Sewall will be pro
tested.
.Representative George Washington
Murray, the colored member of the House,
who represents the Charleston district,
has just returned from South Carolina,
where he was in consultation with leading
Republicans.
He is armed with a monster petition
signed by thousands of Republicans p o
testing against the counting of the elec
toral vo:e, asking for an investigation of
the election laws and the State constitu
tion.
The ciaim is made that the election
laws and that the State constitution upon
which they are based are not in accord
ance with the Federal legislation.
While the dispute over the vote of
South Carolina cannot in any way affect
the result, it may give risÂ» ro cjmplica
tious of a serious nature.
The best authorities agree that the pe
tition cannot be ignored, and the investi
gation of precedents shows that when
such a protest is entered the count must
immediately stop nntil the question is set
tled. In fact, the law expressly antici
pates and provides for such a dilemma.
Nearly all of the South Carolina Con
gressional elections for the next Congress
have been contested on the very grounds
set forth in the petition, so that if the
House should so decide that the protest
against the electoral vote has no founda
tion, it will De a precedent which may
preclude the next Republican House from
seating the Democratic Eepresentatives
and hold the prinia facie certificates of
election.
The debate is thÂ°refore likely to be ex
citing and of an intensely partisan nature
both in the House and Senate.

REPORT OF A WOMAN VIC
TIM.
Visitors With Schemes Ssek the
Prisoner's Old Apparel â A
Phonograph "Roast."
Butler has been here but four days, and
yet he is already probably better known
and more talked about than any celebrity
that was over here before him.
Yesterday brought forth its interesting
happenings to the fiend in his cell at the
City Prison. He manifested a desire to
be accommodating â to cater to the morbid
wishes of his curious viaitors, who c.ime,
talked and passed on without let or
hindrance. The freedom permitted visit
ors has occasioned remark. No watch is
kept upon their movements.
Any one is free to and could easily band
the murderer a razor, a pistol, strychnine
or dynamite with which to end his own
existence, along with those about him.
Considering the known desperate char
acter of the prisoner and the almost con
clusive evidence of guilt that must speed
ily suffer the death penalty, these remarks
Irom certain visitors seem not wholly un
called for.
Among the visitors were persons seek
inc commercial gain. Already a man has
offered the police $1000 for permission to
exhibit Butler for one week to the other
thousands of morbidly and hysterically
curious that have not vet had an oppor
tunity to gratify their desire to see and
speak to the Australian murderer.
A shoe-dealer brought Butler a nice pair
of new lace calf shoes and tenderly car
ried away the poor old low-deck shoes
that Butler had worn since leaving New
castle.
Later in the day the old shoes and But
ler's receipt for the new shoes were
prominently displayed in a downtown
sboesiore and attracted a crowd. A hatter
came hoping to exchange a new hat for
Btitlet's little, low, soft black felt that
looks much like an old-fashioned derby,
but the new hat was too large for Butler's
head and the exchange was not made. A
newspaper man asked Butler for his belt,
which Butler asserted he had worn con
stantly for several year and had also used
as a razor strop. Butler would do any
thing to be accommodating.
If the man would get him another to
take its place he might have it and wel
come. Butler trailed complacently when
he saw the exchange. He pot an expen
sive new belt of the stamped leather
pattern.
The hat alone remains of oil Butler's
available original effects, and that Detec
tive Mcllattie avers was Captain Lac
Weller's hat. The yachting cap in which
Butler's unlucky photograph was taken
in Australia he wore up on the voyage
and haa loaned it to Sailor Wilcox only a
few moments before he was captured.
One of the most Interesting uses to
which Butler's notoriety wns pnt yester
day in a business way was the production
of a cylinder fora phonograph. Butler
could not sing. He had no apt recitation
ready to shout into the lunnel, so he read
in a loud, distinct voice his denial of the
Examiner's fake purporting to be a con
lession from him.
The man who owns that cylinder has
something that will probably bring better
pay if the voce of Butler is never heard
to murmur from it a roast of the Exami
ner for "the new journalism" that values
a good fake more than an ordinary fact.
Among the visitors who came for pur
poses of identification was Edward E. El
liot, second engineer of the steame
Monowai, about to sail for Australia. He
had bepn a friend of Captain Loe Weller.
He declared at once that the prisoner
was not Lac Weller.
"How the do you know? There
are sw>> Lee Wellers." said Butler.
Gaffney, a sailors' boarding - house
keeper, called upon Butler and recopnized
him as Richard Ashe, who had staid at
his place on the water front in IS9I, just
after leaving the Star of Russia. The
recognition was mutual. Butler still owes
$18 75 on that boara account, thoueh he
refused to pay it during the few months
subsequent while he was employed as
night watchman in the La Grande Laun
dry, near Thirteenth and Howard streets.
The examination lor identification will
be held Monday, beginning at 10:30
o'clock, before United States Commis
sioner Heacock in the Appraiser's build
ing. It wiil probably be completed that
day. Within two weeks thereafter all the
papers will be here from Washington with

BUTLER KNEW PRESTON.
Admits to His Uncle tn This City
That He Had a Message From
the Murdered PrcsDec or.
A whole famiiy in this City is mourning
the death of Arthur Preston, the young
man whom Butl r or Ashe is accused of
haying murdered while he was digging
what proved to be his own grave. A
brother, an uncle and aunt and several
cou.sms of the murdered man have resided
in tins City lor a number of years.
John Preston Sr., uncle of the deceased,
has lived in th.s City for nearly twenty*
live year?. He :i a member of the Master
Mariners' Association and for years has
been head nÂ«ger for the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company. '"Shortly after But
ler was arrested," said he yesterday, "I
went out 10 the City Prison to see him. 1
wan ed to see the jewelry and trinkets he
brougut from Ausiralia witu him, but the
chief of detective* was not there and I
have not had a lout at them yet. I was
then shown into Butler's cell ami I asked
h:ru if he had known Arthur Preston.
When he BUS wet ed that he had known
b;m I said : 'For God's sake tell me how
he came by .'.is death ?'
"He asked me. 'Who are you?'
'1 ai.swtred, 'Arthur's uncle.' He gave
a start and s^id, 'I have a messace for you,
but I cannot give it to you now,' and with
that lie g.auced at the policeman who was
Btandine in the cell watching us. Then
he began to talK about other matters, and
do w.iat 1 would I could not get him back
to the subject of Arthur's murder again.
"Arthur's mother is a widow and lives
in Liverpool. One day mother and son
had a tiff and the latter vowed that he
woulii go to Australia and seek his fortune
on the pod fields. He had tome money
of h:s own, and that lie tooK with him.
Being more or less of a sailor he deter
mined to work his way, and siened aboard
the British bark Wiodur, for Sydney,
N. S. W. He made several ventures at the
mines, but just maue expenses, and wnen
he saw the advertisement thai lured him
to his death he was no better off than
when he left home.
"A couple o: months ago we got a letter
from Arthur's motner, and in it she said
he had not written homa sines he sailed
away iv anger, and asking if mv nephew
John had seen or heard anything of him.
Nut one of us knew of his whereabouts,
and the tirst news we got was what ap
peared in the San Francisco pipers tell
ing of his murder in the Australian bush.
"As to the man calling himself Lee
Welter, I never saw him in my life Defore
and never want to see him again. He did
not impress me as beinir a murderer, but
if he shot Arthur in coid b.ood why hang
ine is too good for him."
While talsing about the traeedy the
tears frequently came into Mr. Preston's
eyes, and when ne spoke of the estrange
ment between the murdered man and his
mother there \Â»as a break in his voice that
w;>s more eioqueut than words.
John Preston Jr., one of the crew of the
PacitiC Mali Company's steamer Colon
and brotiier oi the murdered man, is now
in the United States Marine Hospital.
Just about the time the news of his bruth
or's death was chronicled in the papers of
New South Wales he was beguiled into a
resort on tue water front and druggpd.
His pay for the round trip to Panama was
taken from hini and he was left to sleep
off ti,e effect ol tne drug. "When my
nephew came to himself," said Mr. Pres
ton, "he could not explain anything. He
knew that his money was gone, but could
give no explanation. On the advice of the
doctor of lue ship I bad him removed to
the hospital, but instead of getting bener
he seems to be ge.tirr.; worse. I sent mv
â¢on out to see his cousin to-lay, but I will
not know his condition until I reach
home-. I intend next week making another
attempt at getting what I can out of Lee
Weiler. as hf calls himself, about Arthur's
life :n Aus:ralia and as to how he came to
h;s death."
"HAVE MONEY OF ME OWN"
Butler's Coin Supposed to Be in an
Australian Bank.
Butler has or had money in the Eng
lish, Scottish and Australian Bank. He
lias unwittingly admitted this from time
to time in a number of casual and dis
connected remarks.
He arrived here with only two gold
sovereigns in his possession, and without
another cent, either in that Gladstone
bag or in the pockets of his clothes. Each
of his supposed victims was known to
have had money wben he went out with
Butler on a prospecting trip. One of
thtm, it is claimed, took along $2000
They hardly went far enough to spend
much money in travel.
Butler evidently spent little money on
ciothey. Most otthose found with him
had belonged to Frank B. Harwood, tiie
mining expert, to Captain Lee M. Weller,
\o Dickson, r.r to some ottier person. Ap
parently he had no expensive tastes. s
He is not known tv have hail a single
chum or irieod who might have helped
him to spend the ill-gotten coin. He was
always seen alone, except when with his
intended victims. The series of murders
was committed within too short a period,
it would seem, for the profits to have been
consumed by board bills. And during the
latter part of his stay in Sydney, he iived
at the Sailors' Home, wrere expenses were
moderate. When he ventured to New
castle, he also chose the Sailors' Home as
his boarding piece, and he stayed there
nine clays before leaving in the Swanhilda.
The question has naturally arisen, What
has become of lhe money that i>e must
have cot at the time and irom the sources
he obtained the clothing, jewelry and other
effects?
A bankbook, only a few leaves of which
had been torn out, was found among his
things. At the time of the examination
it wns supposed to have belonged to Mrs.
C O'Connor of Aibnry â Cons. able Con
roy's married sister â for her name and
complete address were written inside the
cover. After the report of the examina
tion was published in The Call iiutler
lor ot all his manifest aiiuses he is now
best known here and in Australia by this
name â in the course of a long, rambling
con venation with a Call reporter, re
senteii the printed inference that he had
stolen the bankbook from Mrs. O'Connor
at Albury aiter obtaining her address from
Conroy in Sydney.
The nnme and address had been written
by the waitress he Knew in Sydney and
to whom he afterward gave the pooto
:-raph that resulted in his being traced.
Tuat wai one day in August, some time
before t lie epoch of murder. He was talk
ing with the young woman. He Had no
card* about him. Takir.s out his bank
book he let the pni write ihe name and
address of Mr.?. O'Connor, whom she
knew as a resident of Albury, where, ac
coidlnc to Conroy, But!er i retended to
own a cold mine. lor which he had been
offered Â£3000. Conroy has lecotjnized ihe
p:r!'s handwriting in the name and ad
dress written in pencii.
On the outside of thp bankbook ap
peared ihe name L*e Welier, but not in
Lee Welter's handwriting. Butler has re
marked that he wrote that name there,
intending to leave the checkbook with the
captain of the Swunhilda for sa;e-keeping
during the voyage to San Francisco.
Again and ug;iin, Butler has remarked
that be has money of iiis own. He dis
claims any desire to profit by the morbid

souvenir-seehers who would pay for his
autograph. Yesterday lie willingly fur
nished about forty autographs. He would
not attempt to make a bargain for money,
though several opportunities were offered
him. He preferred to be accommodating
when it was merely a favor the person
asked.
"I have money of me own." he sail.
"I wouldn't take anything to do a man a
little favor like that."
In what town that money is, or in what
name It is deposited, is a mystery. The
English, Scottish and Australian Bank on
which lie had a checkbook has headquar
ters in Melbourne, colony of Victoria, and
in Sydney, and it has branches all over
Australia.
IS SHE ANOTHER VICTIM?
An Australian Paper Intimates That
Butler W?3 the Murderer of
a Mrs. McCarthy.
The Australian Star of the 13th ult.
would swell the list of Butl<sr's victims by
the addition of a woman's name. The
Star says:
Another murder has been associated
wi;h the name of Butler. Tha news of
this one comes from Canadian Gully, near
Baliarat, Victoria. The police have been
informed that shortly after the murder of
Mrs. McCarthy at ihat place a few months
ago a man answering the description of
Butler suddenly disappeared. Detectives
have shown a photograph of Butier to two
women living in the township, and they
are positive that he was the man who was
living at Canadian Gully at that particu
lar time.
MRS. WELLER'S DEATH.
Detective McHattie Was on That
Case and Knew th â¢
Husband.
Detective McHattie of Newcastle is
doubly connected with the Butler case â
as sleuth and as valuable witness. He
knew Butler by sight in Newcastle and
he knew Captain Lee Weller quite well.
During a piece of detective work he did
at the time of the sudden and ratber sus
picious death of Mrs. Lee Weller aboard
the ship South Esk in Newcastle last
March, McHattie had an opportunity not
only to see a good deal of Captain Weller,
but of all the wife's effects.
The story of the dpatli nearly a year
ago of Mrs. Lee Weller, whom the
Examiner styles the "widow" of Captain
Weiierf thoueh Weller survived hs wife
about seven months, is an intf-restinc in
cident in the history ot the crime? with
wiiich Butler is primarily associated.
Lee Weller and his w:fs went to New
castle fiom Cape Town, South Africa, last
March as passengers in the ship South
Esk. Weller left his wife aboard ship
while he took a trip down to Sydney,
about 104 miles distant from Newcastle.
He went for a short visi: to an old friend
of his, a reporter on the Sydney Weekly
Bulletin, who, as events proved, was latar
to figure very prominently in the Butler
case, for it was by the newspaper man
that the attention of the police was first
called lo Weller's disappearance,
Mrs. Lee Weller was a very attractive
woman. The captain of the South Esk
was believed to be in love with ner. They
were often seen together in Newcastle.
One evening this captain returned to bis
sbip at 8 o'clock and found Mrs. Lee We'
lerdead. When be had gone ashore at 6
o'clock that evening she was alive and
well.
The police were suspicious. Detective
McHaltie, the foremost man of bis pro
lession at Newcastle, wai pnt on the case.
An inquest was ordered, but it showed
nothing. The Coroner's jury brought in
a verdici of huari iailure.
From his work on that case, Detective
AlcHattie became familiar with all the
thines that had been in Mrs. Lee Weller's
cabin. Among Butler's effects he recog
nizet many things that he then examine 1.
The Gladstone bag. the piaid blanket
sxiawl, much of the jewelry, ar.d some of
the photographs that Butler brought hero
McHattie immediately recognized as Mrs.
Lee Weller's, or Captain Lee Weller's. The
plain gold bracelet was a present from the
captain of the Boutn Eilc to Mrs. Lee
Wellerand had been bought in Newcastle.
Ttie photograph of a man with a full short
dark beard is that of the captain of the
South Esk. He had given it to Mrs. Wel
ler.
McHattie's particular duty at Newcas
tle is to watch for absconders from Syd
ney, who come to the coal port to lake
passage in some of the coalships. He is
on the lookout for new arrivals that go
down to the ships. It was in this way
that he took notice of Butler before lie
sailed, and long before he suspected him
of any crime.
That Butler felt that he was hunted
after he suddenly ieft Sydney is evident.
It was a woman's shrewd observation that
friehtened him out of Sydney.
Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, who had a fruit
otore In Sydney, replied to Butler's adver
tisement, but Sharp could not make sat
isfactory arrangements for a prospecting
tour. So he inserted an unsigned adver
tisement himself the next day calling for
a partner to go prospecting.* Builer an
wittingly an: we red thÂ» advertisement in
Derson, dÂ»clar:ng then that his name was
Frank Hurwood. Mis. Sharp insisted
thai she could not be deceived, and s"he
toid Butier that she would not be sur
prised if he were thÂ»Â» man that went off
with Captain Lee Weller. No in orders
had yet been even suspected.
Butler left. He showed up a few days

The third ni.-ht that he was there young

passed along the porch to his room he
noticed a light in one of the windows.
Just as he arrived opposite the window a

was Butler's room and Butler l.i Id the
pistol. As soon as he recognized voting
Booth he withdrew the pis;o'. j Butler

was the night of November 19. The Swan
hilda sailed four days later.
Word has come to Detective McHattie
from Victoria, B. C, saying that Captain
Lee Weller was well known there, and
that Mrs. Lee Weller was supposed to be
wealthy.

Captain Fraser Falls to Get Any
Information From the Blue
Hill** Murderer.
Captain Fraser of the Swanhilda called
on Murderer Butler last evening and took
him out of his cell for a talk in the cor
ridor. The man who still masquerades as
Lee Weller was cool and collected whiie
seated between the master mariner aud a
friend, and discussed matters aboard the
shin as though he was still on board.
He admitted that he knew that the rap
lain had been warned of his presenco on
board, but said that he knew no renson
why he should have tried to escape, inas
much as he was confident of proving his
innocence of any charges of murder that
micrht be brought against him.
"I wouldn't mind going back in the
ship," he said to Captain Fraser aa the
master of the vessel shook his hand at
partinc, "but I suppose there is no
chance."

VAMOOSES CRAZY CAPTAIN.
Drives a Dozen Men Into the Bay With a
Rifle and Brutally Beats a Brother
Skipper.
NEW YORK. N. V , Feb. 5.â A Herald
special from Miami, Fia., says: Captain
Mclntosh of the yacht Vamoose We.nc-
day forced a dozen men to leap into the
bay at the muzzle of a rifle, and probably
intally injured Captain Denny of the
steam launch Ozone.
Dennv took out a pany in the Ozone for
a trip on the bay. Captain Mclntosh and
Chapman, a friend, being of the number.
Mclntosh had a demijohn of whisky and
began drinking heavily. Finally he seized
a riflÂ» and threatened to kill every man on
the launch. The Ozone was not far iro>m
shore and the passengers leaned into the
water and safely reached the beach, leav
ing only Denny, Mclntosh and Chnpman
in ;he launch. Mclntosh then beat Denny
until the latter wai unconscious.
When Denny recovered he found thÂ«
launch lar out in the bay and the mad mv
standing over him with a rin>. Denny,
in fear of his life, jumped overboard and
attempted to swim tiahore. Mclntosti
jumped into a rowboat whic i the launch
had in tow and pulled Denny into it, and
then compelled him at the rifle's point to
row him and Chapman up the river to the
Vamoose.
During the trio Mclntosh rapped Den
ny's knuckles with tue ritie, breaking
every finger. Denny howled in agony, but
the captp.i'i continued to rap the mangled
fingers. Denny's face is crushed and lie
is probably fatally hurt. After reaching
the Vamoose Mclntoah barricaded him-
Mlt, but a posse stormed the boat Wednes
day night and arrested him. The feeling
against Mclutosh is so bitter that lynch
ing is feared.

Counsel F.es
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Jan. 29.â Mrs.
Carrie H. Dimond returned to Honolulu
on the Coptic to the very great surprise of
people here. Her husband went oul on
the tug with Â£ 1 Macfarlane! to meet the
Gillig party, and oue of the first to con
front him on the deck of the Coptic was
his wife. There was no scene, as mutual
friends interfered. On reaching the
wharf Mr. Dimond at once drove to the
office of his attorneys, Kinney <fc Ballou.
A petition for a temporary injunction re
straining Mrs. Dimond from entering his
home or taking the only chiid was pre
sented to Circuit Judsre Carter in cham
bers shor.iy afterward. The petition was
as follows:
Now comes the libellant, W. W. Dimond, in
the above entitled cause, and moves this court
that an injunction issue forthwith restraining
the libellee, Mrs. W. W. Dimond, in said case
from entering or attempting to cater the
home o; the libellant at Waiklfci, or from in
terfering with or molesting the person of Lucy
M. Diniond, child of libellant and libe.lee,
until furtner order of this court. This motion
is base 1 upon the record and upon the affi
davit of William W. Dimond, hereto attached
and made a part hereof.
Mr. Dimond asserted in his petition
that Mrs. Dimond voluntarily left his
house, and furiher that the premises were
leased in bis own name from the Bishop
estate- Judge Carter immediately issued
the following order:
Xow, therefore, you and every one of you
are strictly unjoined under the pain and pen
alty of being in contempt of court from enter
ing or atternp ting tb enter the house or prem
ises of W. W. Diniond at Waikiki, aud iroia in
terfering with or molesting tae person of Lucy
M. Dimond until further order of this court.
Hereof fail not at your peril.
The papers were placed in the hands of
Marshal Brown, 'jut before he could serve
them Mrs. Dimond bad already gained an
entrance into the Dimond home. The
place bad been locked and bolted, but Mr-t.
Dimond forced her way in.
All that night there was considerable
excitement in the Dimond household,
neither Mr nor Mrs. Dimond retiring.
The attorneys of both parlies, Messrs.
Thurston & Stanley for Mrs. Dimond,
Kimey & Balluu for Mr. Diamond, and
Mr. Paul Neumann, Marshal Brown, Mr.
Muore, Ned Macfarlane and others were
also congregated at the house until mid
night.
The following moruing on the advice of
her atto rneys, Mrs. Dimond took rooms
at the Arlington Hotel, where she now is.
Early on Monday morning she was served
with an order to appear before Judge Car
ter for contempt, for disobeying the order
made above in remaining In the house on
Saturday night.
The case is being bitterly fought by both
parties. Her attorneys have already sc
oured an order from Judge Garter allow
rng her $25 per week temporary alimony,
and $250 attorneys' fees.
It i> generally understood here that if a
suitable settlement of the property, ali
mony and the custody of the child in her
favor can be arranged Mr?. Dimond will
not object to the divorce; but if such set
tlement cannot be reac led that she wiil
fight the case to the bitter end and tell all
â he knows.
It is common talk that her threatened
revelations would involve many other bo
c-.etv people ana create a bin scandal in
Honolulu society, and those interested ar*
making strenuous efforts to effect a settle
ment between the principals. None has
been effected yet, and the motion to ad
judge Mrs. Dimond puilty of contempt
was partly heard in court this morning,
but went over till 10-morrow.

THE SUGAR-COFFEE WAR.
Sugar Kings Execute a Flank Movement
on the Arbuckies by Incorporating
an Oppos/ton Company.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. s. âThe Herald
says: The latest development in the
sugar-coffee war now waging between the
su^ar trust and the firm of Arbuckie
Bros, wa^ the execution of a flank move
ment by the sugar people.
In Trenton, N. J., yesterday the Ameri
can Coffee Company was incorporated
with a capital stock of $100,000. Tue in
corators are: Henry O. Havemeyer, John
E. Searie?, Johu E. Parsons and Theodore
A. Havemeyer.
The new phase in the war reached Wall
street late yesterday. A lively discussion
ensued as to a possible luture" movement
by the Arbuckies. Tne latter thus lar, if
not havniL' a de'cideJ advantage in the
contest, have rendered it a drawn battle
through their exceedingly shrewd pur
chase of the minority stock of the Wool
son fcpice Company of Toledo, second
only in size to the Arbuckie plant among
the coffee-roasting establishments in the
country.
The move is considered one of the
shrewdest bits of business of the genera
tion, for though they could not control
the plant, it enabled the Arbuckies to ap
ply for a receivership for the company,
and testimony on this application is now
bemsr taken in Toledo.
It was said if the sugar trust lost the
case in Toledo it would turn some of its
dismantled refineries in Brooklyn into
coffee-roasting plants, and the incorpora
tion of the company in Trenton yesterday
was by some per.~ons taken as foreshadow
ing the belief of tne sugar people that the
case would go against them. Other opin
ions were in effect that the sugar people
had secured the incorporation of the
American Company in Trenton with the
view of forming an immense roasted -coffee
trust, in which, after some fighting, the
Arbuckies, the Woolsons and the new
company would monopolize the trade and
drive out ail small competitors.

ware Sworn In.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. s.â During
the routine business of the Seriate to-day
Grey (D.) of Delaware presented the cre
dentials of Richard R. Kenney as Senator
elect from the State of Delaware, the cre
dentials being in due form and being
signed by the Governor and Secretary of
State of Delaware.
Chandler took occasion to say that
while he should not object to Kenney
being sworn in, he believed Dupont
should fill the vacant seat, and that the
matter would doubtless be brought before
the Senate in due time in a contest of
Kenney'a right to a seat.
Escorted by Grey, Kenney then ap
peaied before the Vice-President and took
the oath of office.
An effort was made by Morrill (R.) of
Vermont to have the Hou-e bill taken up
prohibiting the sale of intoxicating iiquors
in the Capitol, and Thurston (R.) of Ne
braska, who had the floor on Allen's Pa
cific Railroad resolution, consented to
yield it in order to accommodate Morrill,
but assurance was given by Hill (D.) of
New York that a vote on the bill could
not be reached in the morning hour.
Thereupon Allen's resolutions were
tak n up and Thurston proceeded with his
argument against his colleague's resolu
tion and in favor of a compromise arrange
ment by which the Government would re
ceive from the Union Pacific Company at
least $29,000,000 nei for its cl&im against
the road. Discussing the claim Thurston
stated that on 1040 miles of road, from
Omaha to Ogdeu, the Government would
nave to pay over $27,000,000 in cash to ex
tinguish the first mortgage, and would
rlso have to forego the receipt of the
$29,000,000 net offered for its claim against
the company.
That would make $56,000,000 which it
would cost the Government for that line
ot roaJ, to say nothing of the $1,000,000
unpaid bonds on the Omaha bridge and
some $2,000,000 of equipment bonds. As
to the 3.000,000 acrss of undisposed lands
which would revert to the Government, he
stated that they could not be sold at 50
cents an acre. He had not c .included his
argument when the morning hour expired,
and said he would continue it to-morrow.
The Nicaraguan Canal bill was laid be
fore the Senate as the unfinished business.
Thereupon a motion was made by Daniel
(D.) of Virginia to take up the bankruptcy
bill, thus displacing the Nicaragua canal
bill. A few minutes afterward, however,
the motion was withdrawn by Daniel, who
said there was a disposition to take up the
bankruptcy bill later on.
Allen (P.) of Nebraska opposed the
canal Dill, declaring that that "colossal
undertaking" would cost at least $300,000,
--000. Me would not vote for the issue of
bonds for anything. The country had be
come bond crazy and was bond weary, and
Congress would have to retrace its steps
speedily if it would not engulf the coun
try in lasting ruin and bring the people to
a condition of perpetual poverty.
Caffery (D.) of Louisiana opposed the
bill. He thought the protest of Mr. Rod
riguez, the Minister Plenipotentiary of the
Greater Republic of Central America,
should be treated with proper respect, but
instead of that the Senate was consider
ing a bill which affected vitally the in
terests of Nicaragua as if no such protest
had been made.
Caffery aid not finish his speech, but
yielded tne floor to allow private pension
bills on the calendar to be passed. There
were iorty-eight of them and they were
ail passed in thirty-five minutes, includ
ing the following: Granting pensions of
$50 a month to the widows of General
Samuel A. Rice, General William A.
Nichois and Captain Law of the navy; of
$30 to the widow of Colonel Ely b. Parker;
ol $40 to the widow of Major Turtle, and
$50 to General James McMillin.
The session lasted uutil6 o'clock, during
which several bills WW passed, merely of
local interest, aud the Senate adjouraed
until to-morrow.

Contested Election Case* and Mention
BUI* Paused Upon. \
WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. s.â ln the!
House to-day, Johnson (K.) of Indiana!
presented the unanimous report of Elec
tions Committee No. 2 upon the contest
of Alexander Benoit V 3. Charles J. Boat
ner. from the Fifth Di-.trict of Louisiana,
fin favor of Mr. Boatner. Upon a content
or the seat subject to the election in 1894
the seat wa3 declared vacant ry trie
House and a special election held to fill
the vacancy. Benoit again contested, and
the committee finds that ho had no case.
Daniels (R.) of New York presented the
report of Elections Committee No. 1 upon
the contest of N. T. Hopkins auairist Jo
seph M. Kendall from the Tenth D strict
of Kentucky in favor of Kendall. Koyse
(R.) of Indiana and Liimey (R.) of North
Carolina dissented from. the conclusion of
the majority.
The House then entered upon the con
sideration of private pen-ion bills, which
have been acted upon by the committee of
the whole. A bill" was passed granting a
pension of $30 a month to the widow of
the late Majjr-Generai Erastus B.Tyler.
A message from the President was re
ceived transmitting the final report of the
president of the Board of Commissioners
of the World's Fair, the material of which
filled five large boxes. It was referred to
the Committee on Appropriations.
The conference report on the Military
Academy bill was presented and agreed
to. It reduces by $15,000 the total amount
of the bill as it passed t. c Senate and in
creases the House total by $5000.
The report from Committee on Elec
tions No. 2 upon the contest of Taylor
Beattie against Andrew Price from the
Third Louisiana District in favor of Price,
the sitting member, was presented.
Johnson (K.) of Indiana and Long (R ) of
Kansas dissented and recommended that
the House declare the seat vacant.
A bill was passed granting a pension of
$12 a month to Amanda M. Way, now a
resident of California, who in the years I
following the war was a prominent tern- '
perance and female-suffrage worker in In- >
diane. Her services were those of volun
teer army nurse.
A bill was also passed granting a pen
sion of $50 a month to Hans Johnson,
Twenty-seventh lowa Volunteers.
When the Senate bill to pension the
widow of the Jaie General and Governor
\V. H. Stoneman of California had been
passed, with an amendment reducing the
rate from $50 to $30 a month, Load (R.) of
California called attention to the di>-
crepancy between the terms of that bill
and those of others pensioning widows of
brigadier-generals.
"General Stoneman," he said, "was no
ordinary general commanding a brigade,
but served with great distinction in charge
of important separate commands in the
Army of the Potomac, and later in the
West. I trust that when the bill gets into
conference ihe members of the Committee
on Pensions will see that the same meas
ure of justice is meted out to Mrs. Stone
man that the committee has accorded to
the widows of other general officers, many
of whom we never heard of before. To be
cure, General Stoneman was a Democratic
Governor of my State, but I hope that no
political bias has influenced the action of
the committee."
Thomas (R.) of Michigan, acting chair
man of tbo Committee on Invalid Pen
sions, said he approved every word the
gentleman from California had uttered.
Sixty-one bills were disposed of, when
thÂ» House took tho usual Friday recess
until 8 p. m.
On motion of Loudenslager of New Jer
sey the House at to-night's session
adopted a resolution that private pension
bills -hall be considered only when their
authors were present and responded to
their names. The purpose of the resolu
tion was to insure the attendance of mem-
bers having bills on the calendar, orcause
Biich bills to lose their legislative right of
wÂ«y. Only three bills under the order
were passeu over, and when the House
adjourned at 10:30 twenty-three bills had
been considered and laid aside with a fa
vorable recommendation.

Their Conduct.
ILLEGAL MILEAGE ALLOWED BY
THE COMMITTEE.
Judge Waymire Fresents an Individ,
ua! Report to Dismiss Duck
worth at Once.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. s.âAssem
blyman Way mire, chairman of the special
investigatinc committee, presented the
following report:
Mr. Speaker: The special committee ap
pointed to investigate the temporary organi
zation ol the Assembly have performed that
duty, and herewith submit their report. The
amended resolution authorizing the investl
gntion is as follows:
WHEBEAS, Charges of ft serious nature have
been made relative to frauds said to have been
practiced during the temporary organization
oi thiÂ» Assembly: and
WHEBKAS, The Chief Clerk of the Assembly,
S. 1Â». Duckworth, iÂ« chaiged with complicity
therein, and lie denies said charges; there
fore be ii
Ruolttd. That a special committee of seven
be named by the Speaker of this Assembly to
investicate all of saii eharces re.ative to the
organization of this House and to report its
findings to this House. Said committee shall
have lull power to subpena witnesses, admin
ister oaths, take testimony and such other
powers as shall be necessary for the full per
loriuancv oi their duties
Under this resolution the power of the com
mittee is restricted to reporting its findings.
This we understand Includes the power to ex
press an opinion, but does not include the
power to make recommendations.
The resolution was adopted January "6,
1-vÂ»7,a.nd the committee began its work the
same day. Mr. Chyuoweth of tne Assembly has
kindly attended all our sessions and given
valuable assistance in tne examination of wit
nesses. Mr. Duckworth was represented by
counsel and the committee has heard the te-iti
mony oi all witnesses whose presence was
deemed important. The reporter's transcript
of the testimony and the exhibits are sub
mitted herewith and is referred to for in
formation as to details.
The only statute concerning the attaches
who must be present at the organization of the
Assembly is sec Tien 237 of the Political Code,
which is as follows:
"The secretary of the Senate, the minute
clerk and serge&nt-at-arms of each House for
any session must at the next succeeding ses
sion of the body perform the duties of their
offices until their successors are elected and
qualified."
Ii is evidently tne intention of this law that
oniy the chief clerk of the Assembly, the min
ute clerk and the sergeant-at-arms of the As
sembly should hold over lrom one session to
another. They are required to attend and are
therefore entitled to mileage. No other at
taches have - any claim to mileage. it is also
clour thai the law contemplate* that these of
ficers snorld ordinarly be sufficient to organ
ize tne Assembly.
It does not. however, expressly prohibit the
employment of other attaches, and it has been
the custom of the Assembly for many years to
employ additional help. The number so em
ployed has increased each session until the
rolls for lsft)3 show a total of twenty-eight and
those of 13i)5 show forty-nine. A careful in
quiry as to the actual work to be done at the
organization of tne Assembly convinces us
that the following would be ah ample force:
A chief clerk, chap tain, minute clerk, sergeant
at-arms, one assistant sergeant-at-arms, post
mistress, mail-carrier, three iraiekeepers and
five pagesâ fifteen in all. Their total per diem
should not exceed .*74.
We find that at the organization of the pres
ent Assembly the chief clerk appointed at
tacnesas follows:
Assistant clerks 10 Assistant minute
Assi.rauit sergeant-at- j clerks 6
arms ti Clerk 10 sergeant-at-

Position not ilfsie-
naieri (fella Bate- Total 112
man) 1
The total amount allowed for per diem was
$3901 30 and for mileage other than to statu
tory officers #4265 10. As ready stated, we
rind that fifteen attache^ â twelve in addition
to the three statutory officers â would have
been ample and the aggregate of the per diem
that should have been allowed at this session
is $74. This includes the $24 per diem to the
chief clerk, serjeant-at-arms and minute clerk.
For the necessary additional attaches $50 was
sufficient and all that should have been paid.
We find, therefore, that $4215 10 has been
pail out in excess of the sum actually neces
sary.
None of the attaches should be paid for more
time than they serve. It has been a custom to
allow per diem for an entire week on the plea
that the attaches come to the Capitol at a sac
rifice of time which makes It proper. There is '<
no justice in this claim. The statute only re- |
. quires inree officers to attend and there is mi- j
hcicnt compensation 10 them for the time oc
cupied in coming and going in the mileage
allowed by law, which exceeds the actual trav
eling expenses. Tne other attaches are not re
quired to attend and if they do so voluntarily
iney nave no right to ask pay for extra time.
As a matter of fact, they usually come to seek
re-employment.
in this connection we must say that the
Committee on Mileage, in our opinion, was
grossly negligent, not only in recording
mileage but also in recommending the pay
ment of a full week's pay to all the attaches.
It whs its duty to diligently inquire into all
the fact.-, aÂ« iis report waiÂ« designed to guide
the Assembly. Had it mude proper inquiry of
any experienced member it would have at once
discovered the illegality of the surplus ap
pointments, and would have prevented the
evil consequences resulting.
We feel it our duly also to say that all the
members of tne Assembly who votci for the
adoption of the report of that committee are
censurable for their negligence. Had they
given the matter the proper attention they
would have learned that the report was wrong,
and that the payments recommended were
without any justification whatever in bo far as
â¢ the exces-iv(r appointments were concerned.
It is apparent that those who had previously
served in the legislature are more to blame
tiian those who were just entering upon their
first experience. The testimony shows that a
portion of the attaches were appointed with
the know led cc and at the request of the mem
ben, a* follows:
Frank Burnett by Leavitt.
J.L. Oliver by Wright.
H. A. Jackson and I. Â£rb by Kelly.
Ken Mflrtin by CaminL'ttl.

Ray Byron by Arnench.
Jones admitted that in the cases of J. P. Po
vine, A. A. Frledlan ter, S Voorsnneer and R.
iilakesion he authurized them to use his nann-.
â \Ve think the members who requested ap
pointments or lent their names to justi:y
them are specially deserving of censure. Yet
it is to be said in tueir deieoM thai tney had â 
right to make requests for appointments,
knowing that some should be made, and tiiat
they had a rip lit to presume the chic: clerk
would do his duty anil make no more r.ppoii;
ments thun were sctua'.ly necessary lor the
public service. With much more forco it may
be said in defense 01 all the members that
they were occupied lnrueiy In Die considera
tion of the Senatorial contest and in the ex
amination of the numaron* and voluminous
printed reports of public orticers preparatory
to the commencement of their legislative la
bors.
While thus occupied they had a right to
trus; the chief clerk to attend to the details of
the organization. He had nothing to do nut
to organ z-s the House. His mind was free
from other ca res. He had been a number of
the Legislature, and had served as chief clerk
at the last â¢ essioti. It was iair to presume that
he was iamillar with tue duties of h:s office,
aii'i would honestly perform them.
We are of the opinion, and so find, that the
chief clerk deliberately and intentionally ap
rioiiite'l tho aforesaid unnecessary nttaches.
He offers no excuse for his conduct, except the
desire to reward the persons appointed for
their political services. He has even declared
to representatives of t.19 press that if the law
is no; changed, he will at the in x; session of
the Legislature pursue the same course, even
to .the extent of exhausting the contingent
fund of the Assembly by appointing, if re
quisite for that purpose, 1000 attaches.
This is the unfortunate culmination of a bad
practice, which has increased session after
session, In consequence of the importunities
oi people who come to look upon politics as a
tradeâ a means of gaining a living. They
seem to forget that the members of the Legis
lature are but the people themselves, as
sembled in their representative capacity
for the purpose solely cf legislating
for tho common good of the whole State. They
disregard the fact mat representatives are
trustees, and have no right to expend one
dollar of the public funds without a fair
equivalent i;i service or material; that every
dollar paid out from the public treasury for
an unnecessary servant is money deliberately
perverted in violation of a siicred trust.
They work for their party, it is true, but
should, if th,ey are good citizens, do so be
cause they believe tht.t the success of their
party is necessary to good government, in
which they, at* well as others, are concerned.
In other words, they work for themselves
when they work for '.heir party.
The chief clerk is a man of unusual intelli
gence, and no one understands better thr.n he
how indefensible is his conduct. We are
happy to say that the evidence does not dis
close any attempt on his part to profit tinnn
cially by his appointments; but this fact by
no means jusiities his conduct, by ;he un
necessary appointments he has made he has
enabled others to abstract from the public
treasury a large sum of money which it will
be diflicult if not impossible to recover. His
example, if unrebuted, would be imitated by
others in the future, and this disgraceful
abuse, instead of being stopped at once and
forever, as it should be, will go on increasing
until the evil effects are felt in other depart
ments of the public service. It is not neces
sary to multiply words in condemnation ot
bis action. While we believe a complete rem
edy will require legislation, either In amend
ment to the statue or of the constitution, or
both, we think also that it is necessary that
the one who, by showing himself unworthy of
the trust rep 1 sed in him, haÂ« brought about
luis unfor mint â¢ state of affairs should be
made to suffer. As we have already stated, we
rind no authority in the resolution under
which we are ac'.ing to authorize us to recom
mend any speeilic. punishment, and we must
leave that to the judgment of the House.
We are also of the opinion that steps should
be taken to recover from the aunches now in
the service all the mileage paid them, and we
specially call the attention of the House to the
case of Mr. Hocking, to whom has been paid
the sum of $117(50 for miieaire. He is now
acting in the capacity of bookkeeper to the
serjeant-at-arms.
BY
Way mire, on behalf of himself indi
vidually, and not as a member of the com
mittee, introduced the following resolu
tion :
WHEBXAA, The committee heretofore ap
pointed by this Assembly to investigate the
irregularities attending the temooray organi
zation of the Assembly have, after a patient
consideration of all the facts, found that
100 attaches in excess of those ac
tually required were appointed io assist
in the temporary organization, thereby
leading to an unnecessary expenditure of
!t>4-15 80; anil whereas, said committee has
also found that the said attaches were de
liberately and intentionally appointed by the
chief clerk with the knowledge that they
were not necessary, and for the avowed pur
pose of rewarding the persons so appointed
for party cervices; and whereas, the said com
mittee has further found that the chief clerk
has declared that unless the law shall be
changed he will at the next session ol the
Legislature appoint enough attacnes at the
temporary organization to eihuufi the con
tingent fund of the Assembly , even if. fur that
purpose, it be necessary to appoint a thousand
attaches; now therefore, be it
Resolved, That in the opinion of the Assem
bly S. J. Duckworth, chiel clerk of the Assem
bly, is guilty of n. violation of the trust re
posed in h-m; that it is unwise to continue
him in office, and that he is hereby removed
srom office from and after the passage of this
resolution.
Neither the report nor the resolution
was read to the House, there being evi
denced a disposition on the part of the
majority to dispense with the reading
thereof. It was decided to have both
primed in the journal to-morrow morn
ing, and to make them the special order
for next Wednesday at 2 p. m.

of the Senate.
The Committee on Enrollment reported

| ble then changed nis vote and gave notice
of a motion torecons der.
The Duckworth investigation commit
tee mad* a report which reviewed the
resolution authorizing an investigation.
The report stated that the only authority
conferred upon tiie committee thereby
was confined to reporting its findings and
including an expression of i's opinion. It
was found that the law authorized only
the chief clerk, minute clerk and sergeant
at-arms to hold over, but does not i>ro
hibit additional attaches. The defect
cannot be remedied except by legislation
amending the statutes or constitution, or
both. The report states that additional
help is necessary, but that a force, num
bering fifteen, with a per diem of $74, was
surticient; and contains a list of men em
ployea by Duckworth, expressing the be
lief that the responsible party should not
co unrebuked.
The committee recommends that steps
should be taken to recover from thÂ« at
taches now employed all the mileage paid
to them, and calls particular attention to
the case ot Mr. Hocking, now bookkeeper
to t c sergeant-at-arms, who was paid
1117.
" The report of the committee was fol
lowed by two resolutions by Judge Way
rmrp, one of which provided for tne col
lection of mileage paid to the appointees
and the otner charging Duckworth with
deliberately making appointments to pay
pany debts and referring to his threats
regarding the appointment of a host of
attaches next session. Waymire con
cluded with a resolution finding Duck
worth guilty of misusing trust reposed in
him, consequently it is unwise to con

An Act to Protect the Bankrupt Rancher
J-rotn financial Miark*.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. s.â Wright's
Assembly bill 686 is designed to protect
persons whose property shall be sold un
der foreclosure of mortgage. Under the
law as it now stands if the property does
not produce sufficient to pay off the prin
cipal, interest 'and coats the deficiency
stands as a judgment against the debtor.
The bill now b fore the Judiciary Com
mittee relieves the debtor from loss by
reason of depreciation in Jand values, etc.,
and obliges tne lender to bear the loss.
The bill reads as follows:
Section 720. There can be but one action lor
the recovery of any debt, or the enforcement
of any right secured by mortgage upon real
estate or personal property, which fiction must
be in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. In such action the court may, oy Its
judgment, direct a sale of the lncumbered
property (or so much thereof as may be neces
sary), mid the application of the proceeds of
the sale to tne payment of the costs of the
court and the expenses of the sale and the
amount due to the plaintiff. If it appears
from the Sheriff* return that the proceeds are
insufficient, or that a balance still remain*
due, no judgment can be docketed
for such- balance against the defend
ant or defendants personally, nor shall
the mortgagee be given any recourse
against such defendant on account of
such debt so secured by mortgage, but In nil
cases where a creditor takes any property I
as security tor a debt, he shall, In case of de
fault in payment of such debt, be confined to !
such property or the proceeds of its sale for I
the satisfaction of his claim or demand. No
person holding a conveyance from or under
the mortgagor of the properly mortgaged, or
having a lien thereon, which conveyance or
lion does not appear of record in the proper j
office nt the time of c lmtnenceinent of the
action, need be made a party to . such action; !
and the judgment therein rendered, and the
proceedings therein had ; are as conclusive
against tbe party holding such unrecorded
conveyance or lien as if he had been made a
party to the action.

IS THE INDIANA A FAILURE?
The New Battle-Ship Put to Another Test
With a Squadron and Has to
Return to Port.
WASHINGTON", D. C, Feb. s.â What
may be represented to foreign Governments
as an failure of one of the
crack yesseis of tne new navy receives an
explanation which navy officials of ex
perience regard as satisfactory. The re
turn of the battle-ship Indiana to Hamp
ton Kottds to-day after having been at sea
with Admiral Bunce's squadron hardly
twentyvfour hours was due to the same
turrets 1 which got loose in a storm last
fall, when Captain EvaDs commanded the
ship in the evolutions off Long Island.
On t%at occasion the big guns project
ing from the turrets swung back and
forth across the decks as tho ship
heeled over on her beam ends in the sea,
and the gravest fears were felt that the
magnificent vessel would "turn turtle"
and go down. Captain Evans hove her to
and lashed the guns temporarily, which
enable^ him to reach port, and then sev
eral months were spent at the navy-yard
in trying to remedy the defect.
Ca plain Evans was succeeded in com
mand by Captsin Taylor, formerly of the
war college, and yesterday was Captain
Taylor's iirst experience for some time on
an armored *h in that has earned a repu
tation wallowing, and it is understood
that the long rollers following the recent
heavy jÂ»ale made themselves felt on the
ship w^en the fleet got off Hatteras.
li -lie had not been restricted to squad
ron formation Captain Tayior might have
headed- his course into the seas, but as the
Now York with her high free board and
notable stability was setting the course,
and asthe Indiana could not safely stay
Â«vith tlie fleet she was permitted to return.
If her turrets had broken loose off Hat
teras the ahip might have been lost.
The Navy Department gave out the fol
lowing statement regarding the matter
this afternoon:
"The- Indiana returned to-day to Hamp
ton roads, having made a run with the
squadron. When she went out this time
sue had with her a new locking device for
her turrets, lately put on at New YorK,
and which was intended to remedy the
trouble, she had the last time she put to
sea in^heavy weather. This present de
vice has three times the strength of the
former one. Very properly the officers of
the ship have been cautious and observant
as to it* workinÃS, and she has returned
to the Roads for a further inspection of it
and possible readjustment."
The department expects to have the In
diana again at sea in a few days.
ONLY A 'TRIVIAL AFFAIR.
The State Department Receives a Report
From Minister Barrett of the
Kellett Incident.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 5. -The
State Department has received a full re
port of the Kellett affair at Chieng Mai
Siam, Jrom Minister Barrett, which indi
cates that it was only a trivial affair,
greatly exaggerated in importance and al
together that a mountain was made from
an exceedingly small molehill.
It appears that there has never been
any occasion for sending a United States
gunboat to Siam on tfcis account, and cer
tainly no additional ship will be sent;
nor is there any anticipation of the slight
est strain in the relations between this
c uutry and Siam.
It seems that Mr. Kellett, who is an un
paid official, appointed by the Consul-
General, had sent two of his native ser
vants at night to post a letter and one of
them carried a cane, contrary to law.
He was arrested and taken to jail, where
Mr. Kellett proceeded and endeavored to
rescue the prisoner without formality,
and in the resistance offere I by the ser
geant Mr. Kellett was .-truck about the
head and had his face scratched.
Later in the evening tne servant was
released by the Siamese Commissioner,
who sent a servant to inquire after Mr.
Kellett's injuries. Mr. Kellett said he
had no reply to make until he commu
nicated with the Minister at Bangkok
about the insult that bad been offered him.
No doubt is held at the State Depart
ment but that the affair has been satifac
torily arranged before now, the decart
ment taking no action whatever.
A THIEVING BANK CASHIER.
After Thirty- Four Years' Service He Quits
$12,000 Short and Mysteriously
Disappears.
BETHLEHEM, Pa., Feb. s.â For fifteen
years Cyrus E. Breder, cashier of the First
National Bank of Bethlehem, has been re
garded as an upright and honorable man,
but his honesty was a cloak, and he is
now a fugitive from justice, with a short
age in his accounts at the bank of
$12,430 86.
When the First National Bank was
organized, thirty-four years ago, Breder
began with it as a clerk. By steadiness
and capacity in fourteen years he had
worked his way up to cashier. For rive
years, after becoming cashier, he appears
to have been perfectly honest.
Then he took a nominal sum of money
with tbe probable idea of returning it. It
was the old tale over again. He never
returned the lirst money taken, and
throughout the last fifteen y^ars has been
taking small sums at a time until his
shortage readied over $12,000.
Hopeless of ever b;ing able to replace
the sum, and probably knowing that de
tection could be little longer avoided,
Breder last Tuesday told his wife that he
had resigned from the bank and was going
to New York to accept a position there.
Since then nothing has been heard of
him.
1J Is absence from the bank ied to an in
vestigation of iiis accounts, and it only
took an accountant an hour to-day to dis
cover the extent of the absconding cash
ier's peculations. Breder received a salary
of $150 a month.
Ihe Dolphin Ordered South.
WASHINGTON, D. C, FeD. 5. â The
Dolphin has been ordered to Charleston,

She will arrive on Sunday.
AMENDMENT TO
CONTEMPT LAW
An Interesting Measure Is
Introduced in the
Legislature.
Places Sta'e and Federal Courts
on the Same Plane as to
Criticism.
Judge Catiin's Rulin; Causes Action
by the Free Press Defense
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. Feb. s.â There
was introduced to-day in both, houses of
the Legislature the following constitu
tional amendment:
Section 9. Every citizen may freely speak,
wr lie and publish his sentiments on all sub
jects, being responsible for the abuse of that
right; ana no law shall be passed to restrain
or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.
[Xo speech or publication reflecting upon or
concerning any court or any officer thereof
shall -be treated or punished as a contempt of
court, unless made In the immediate
presence of such, court while in ses
sion and in such a manner as to
actually interlere with its proceedings.]
In all criminal prosecutions for HheU
the truth may be given in evidence to the
jury: and if it shall appear to the jury that
the matter charged as libelous is true and was
published with gooil motives and for justifi
able ends, the party snail be acquitted, and
the jury shall have the ripht to determine the
law and the fact. Indictments found or infor
mation iaid for publications in newspapers
shall be tried in the county whore such news
papers nave their publication office, or in the
county wnere the party alleged to be libeled
resided at the time of the alleged publication,
unieÂ«s the place of trial shall be changed for
good cause.
The amendment consists of the follow
ing inserted in the present law:
No speech or publication reflecting upon or
concerning any court or any officer tnereof
shall be treated or punished as a contempt of
court unless made In the immediate presence
of such court while in session, and in such a
manner as to actually interlere with its pro
ceedings. *â¢
This language is the cist of the Barry
contempt law of IS9I, and is an exact copy
of the Federal statute now governing all
the Federal courts of the United States.
It would seem, therefore, that no reason
able objection could be offered to it as a
law for the government of the courts of
the State of California.
The measure was formulated by the
Free Press Defense league of San Fran
cisco, of which Hon. James G. Maguire is
president and James H. Barry, editor of
tbe Star, secretary. The necessity for the
introduction ot this constitutional amend
ment al this time is indicated by the fol
lowing statement of facts:
Judge A. P. Catiin of the Superior
Court of Sacramento County, in a recent
decision rininc the editor of the Sacra
mento Bee $500 for a criticism of the
court made in the newspaper, declares
that the Barry contempt law of 1891 is un
constitutional.
An appeal in the matter was taken to
the Supreme Court of this State and a de
cision, under the ninety-day rule, is due
this month. It is highly probable, how
ever, that such a decision will not be given
until after tne adjournment of the Legis
lature, and that, if it upholds the view of
the law taken by Judte Catlin, there can
be no protection for newspaper publish
ers or the public generally in this matter
of contempt until the convening of the
next Legislature.
The action of Judge Catlin, as above
referred to. drsw forth an almoÂ«t unani
mous expression from the Dress and the
public of this State, which resulted in
the reorganization of the Free Press
Defense Leaeue of San Francisco (which
obtained the passage of the original
Barry act) and the formulation by it of
the present measure. It covers fully the
ground, insuring ample protection to
every citizen who criticizes "the acts of a
Judiie, whether he does it by speech or
through the newspaper, acd it should,
therefore, meet the hearty support of
those who have already expressed them
selves on this subject.

Joy's Sarsaparilla Will Cleanse the Blood.
MR. T. STACKE.
Mr. T. Stacke lives at the Santa Rosa
Hotel, corner Fourth and San Pedro streets,
Los Angeles, Cal. He has used several
bottles of the native sarsaparilla, and is
now convinced Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla is best, "for," said he, "when I be-
gan using the Sarsaparilla I had a desire
to rest all the time. My blood was dis-
ordered, my tongue coated. At times,
just for a moment, my head swam ; I was
not the least bit dizzv. I knew my needs
and determined to use a bottle of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I easily procured
the first bottle, and after using for six days
felt better in every way. When I bought
the second bottle I had a little trouble in
getting it. The drug clerk tried to talk me
into using something else. I knew what I
wanted and insisted on getting Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I am heartily
glad I bought the remedy and will gladly
recommend it to any one. Joy's is cer-
tainly fine."
Don't let the drug clerk talk you intobuving
something else for Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.

Fresno's Jail Holds a Man
Wanted in Several
Cities.
Fassed as a Gotham Drummer
and Dealt in Worthless
Paper.
Unconsciously A:d. y d by Stockton's
Mayor in Fleecin? One of His
Victims.
FRESNO, Cai.., Feb. f>.-V. S. Wolffe,
â¢who represents himself as being a New
York drummer, and is charged with ob
taining $K'O by false preten-es from Louis
&c oiler, the proprietor of the Tivoli
saloon, was held to answer by Judge St.
John to-day la $2000 bail. The prisoner
persuaded Scholier to indorse a check
drawn by him on A. Sieel & Co. of New
York. It appears that there are several
firms in that city in which the name Sigel
appears, but Wolffe had no authority to
draw on any of tbem. After his imposi
tion on SchollÂ»r, Wolffe immediately pur
chased a railroad ticket for St. Louis, but
the telegraph overtook him ana he was in
tercepted at Los Angeles, from wnich
place Deputy Constable Crutcher brought
hici back to Fresno yesterday.
The accused addressed the court in the
examination to-day, praying for a speedy
hearing as he was suffering tortures in
jail. He represented that he had no idea
of defrauding Scholler, and that he was
willing to bear the expense of telegraph
ing to the firm of A. Sigel it Co. of New
York, on which he had drawn the $100
draft. He said the firm's place of busi
ness was at 1887 Lexington avenue, and he
hnd often drawn on it before.
Replying to Justice St. John the ac
cused admitted having drawn on the firm
for $300 in San Francisco, but he had been
indiscreet, and this was the cause of his
present trouble.
He also admitted that he had drawn on
the firm in Stockton. He claimed that
when he had an opportunity oi explaining
the matter to the linn it would be all
right. He had been allowed, tie said, to
overdraw his account.
Word has been received from Sheriff
Cunningham of San Joaquin County, stat
ing that Wolffc was also wanted in Stock
ton and asking that he be held until the
Sheriff came down. The prisoner is al
leged to have victimized a man out of |150
in that city. Wolffe is about 55 years of
age and of smooth address.

STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. s.â The good
citizens of Stockton were much impressed
one day recently by an august pageant
traveling through the streets. It con
sisted of a spanking turnout, the most
prominent occupants of which were
Mayor Baggs, the Superintendent of
Streets, the President of the Council and a
distinguished looking gentleman of portly
build, who occupied the off side on the
rear seat. There was a air of royalty
about the party that made pedestrians
stop and gaza in awe, wondering what
dignitary h.'.d struct town.
The Mayor was evidently trying to im
press his guest with the greatness of the
city, and the stranger, leaning back com
placently, seemed to regard Mr. Baggs"
bailiwick with considerable favor. The
stranger was V. S. Wolffe. now in Fresno
jail.
Wolffe remarked casually the following
day that he had a draft for $150 on A.
Rigel <fc Co., a New York house in which
he was interested, and of course the Mayor
would be good enough to identify him at
the bank. They walked over to the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, where
the check was presented. The cashier de
clined to advance the money unless
Mayor Bangs would get some one else to
indorse the draft. The executive went
with the distinguished guest of the town
to the Chicago saloon and tnere intro
duced him to John Herrmann.
Wolffe represented that he was con
nected with a wealthy liquor-house, and
they had a few tl rinks by way of proceed
ing to the business in hand. Mr. Herr
mann was induced to place his signature
on the draft, in connection y>nh the
Mayor's. Woiffa tot the $150 and left
town.
It soon came to light that there was no
such firm as that on -a-hich the draft had
been given, and Mayor Baggs was forced
to a realization of the fact that he had
b?en bilked.
Wolffe is now under arrest at Fresno
for otlier swindles of a like nature, and
Herrmann, who made pood the $150, is
mourning his loÂ«s.

that resulted in her death this morning.
In one of the exercises her head struck

started for home, appaiently not seriously
injured.
On reaching home the child com
plained of pains in her head, but inas
much as she had walked home unassisted
ana there was but a slight swelling on the

hurt, the mother and father applied the
usual simple remedies, not bclievine a
physician's attendance necessary.
Shortly before midnight the child be
gan to give forth piercing shrieks, shortly
followed by convulsions. A doctor was
summoned, but an hour later the girl was

Concussion of the brain had resulted
.from the fall and this as the nij:ht went

CARSON, Nf.v., Feb. f>.â Przefigbt
matters have quieted down some here,
pending the arrival of Dan Stuart, who
will definitely settle upon the place where
the encounter is to be held.
Should the event comp off in Carson it
is reported on good authority that work

for which the location has already been
selected, and the streets in the city will be
put into firit-class condition.
It is stated that a representative of Cor

a location for che training quarters of the

It is impossible to rent an empty build

hotel rooms have already been engaged.
\Vheelock, the partner of Stuart, is still
here, but will make no statement until
Stuart arrives. Everything points to Car

Roundabout Charges of Fraud Against
County Offic.a s Denied by Their
Supposed Author.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. s.â William
Curtis, Supervisor of Sacramento County,
has openly asserted, it is claimed, that
George 11, Clark, Coroner of Sacramento
County, had ir.formed nim that it had cost
him (Clark) $1500 to procure the appoint
ment to till the unexpirecl term of Coroner,
made vacant by the death of the former
incumbent, and that this money had been
paid to the members of the Board of
Supervisors.
This statement was brought forth, it is
said, in a tit of pique because the other
members of the board hail seen lit to
differ with Curtis as to certain boun
daries of an outlying school district,
and was in answer to a jest on tho subject
of alleged bribery of certain members of
the board, as published some time ago in
the Sunday News.
This alleged charge against Clark, who
is one of the best-known and most popu
lar young men in Sacramento City and
County, has caused a furore of excite
ment. Wtien interviewed on the subject
Clnrtc said :
"Why, I never told Mr. Curtis such a
thing in my life; I never made such a
statement to any persou. I aid not pay
any person any money,'}
Ex-Supervisor Todd, who, it is claimed,
is charged with receiving thi? $1500, said:
"There is absolutely uot one word of
truth in this assertion of Supervisor
Curtis' as far as I am concerned, and I can
account for his making any such state
ment, if he has done s-o, only by saying
that I Tear he has become mentally inca
pacitated. While Supervisor of Sacramento
County 1 favored many persons in pro
curing positions, but I can truthfully de
clare that I was never the recipi- nt of a
cent from any of them, and I am positive
that every person who was appointed by
our board will so declare on oath."
CONFLAGRATION AT CARSON.
Explosion of Gasoline in the State Print
ing Office Starts a Disastrous
Blazs.
CARSON, NEV.,Feb. sâAn5 â An explosion in
the State Printing Office this morning
nearly wrecked the interior of the build
in? and caused a cessation of work for sev
eral days.
The explosion occurred in what is known
as the carbonator of the engine. Instantly
t lie interior of the pressroom wa\a sheet
of flame. The oil ignited and spread over
the walls and ceiling and the liquid fire
seem oil to go into every conceivable place.
The xorce of the explosion sent the doors
and windows outward and the heat warped
and melted the type that was uppermost
in same of the cases in the composing
room.
The flames adhered to the edges of the
bundles of fine paper stored in the press
room, and everything of that nature was
charred. The carbonator whs a wreck,
and also the electric apparatus which sup
plied the spark for the engine.
The engine was sadly injured. The
rollers of me presses were melted so as to
be useless, but the presses did not seem to
be seriously injured.
After the explosion took place the heat
for a few moments was almost suffocat
ing, and but tor the fact that the doors
and windows were blown out the printers
would have been asphyxiated.
All made a wild plunge lor the shortest
way out, and for a while the greatest con
fusion prevailed. James Huling, who was
near the engine, had his hands badly
burned, but is not otherwise injured.

INVITES ARREST
AND GOES TO JAIL
John Case Imprisoned at
Roseburg for Train
Robbery.
Suspected of Complicity in the
ReceDt Southern Pacific
Hold-Up
"If at Any Time I Am Wan ci I Can
Ec Found," He Had F cjtiously
Written.
PORTLAND. Or., Feb. s.â John Case,
arrested for the Cow Creek train robbery
of June, 1895, and acquitted, took umbrage
at his name being connected with last
week's "bo!d-up" on the Southern Pacific
near Roseburg. He felt that an injustice
had been done him, and so declared him
self in a communication. At the same
time there was hanging over nis head an
indictment found by the late Grand Jury
of Douelas County, charging him with
having been a party to the Cow Creek
robbery and calling for his arrest. This
indictment in no way conflicted with the
trial and acquittal of Case before the
United States authorities. The Govern
ment wanted him only for robbing the
mails; the State indictment charged him
with robbing a train.
Case knew of this Grand Jury indict
ment and his liability to arrest, but he
felt himself innocent of the Sheridan farm
affair of last week and could not restrain
himself from the temptation to issue a
"deti" to those who by innuendo had ac
cused him. So, providing himself with
paper, pen and ink, he wrote of the injos
tice done him, concluding his communi
cation from Salem with the words:
"If at any lime I am wanted I can be
found."
Yesterday afternoon Sheriff Agee of
Douglas County and a deputy appeared in
Salem. Case was true to his word and
was easily found, making no effort to
escape the officer?. He was taken south
on last night s train and lodged in the
County Jail at Roseburg.
It is the general opinion that while the
indictment found by the Douglas County
Grand Jury may yet prove to be the basis
of prosecution against Case, the officers in
reality believe they will be able to prove
his complicity in last week's robbery, and
for that reason wish to have him on hand
when wanted, despite his assurance of be
ing always where he could be found.
NEWS OF SAN JOSE.
Important Ruling Affecting County Clerk's
Feesâ Officer Accused of Rcb-
bmg Chinese.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. s.â An important
ruling was made by Judge Lorigan this
morninc in regard to the cost of filing a
second appraisement of the estate of a de
ceased person, the court holding that only
the usual filing fee of 15 cents can be col
lected. The case before the court was the
application of John EL Anzerais. admin
istrator of the estate of E louard A. Au
zerais, deceased, for a writ of mandate to
compel County Clerk Ptister to -iiie a sec
ond inventory of the estate for the usual
filing fee.
E. L. Auzerais, who was formerly exec
utor of the E. A. Auzerais estate, filed an
appraisement, paying the County Clerk
$G9l. The executor died, and John E.
Auzerais was appointed executor. It was
necessary to file a second appraisement,
but the County Clerk refnsei to receive
the appraisement unless $f>(J6 in fees was
paid. The Auzerais estate is valued at
over $600,000.
In deciding the question Judge Lorigan
said that the Legislature had fixed the
means of raising revenues in the adminis
tration of estates on the line of taxation
of inheritances, and in fixing a fee of $3
for the first $1000 and $1 for each addi
tional $1000 valuation upon the tiling oi
an inventory it was the evident intent to
fix that rate for tiie purpose of compen
sating public officials for all services ren
dered in connection with the administra
tion of the estate, and that when once the
fee had been paid it could not be col
lected again.

VALLEJG'S HOME FOR ORPHANS.
nGroundless Report That the Good Ter-
plars Were About to Close
the Retreat.
VALLEJO, Cat,., Feb. 5.â A lone com
munication appeared in a local paper yes
terday, commenting in derogatory terms
on the management of the Good Tem
plars' Home for Orphans, and intimating
that owing to mismanagement the home
was likely to be abandoned for the want
of sufficient aid to carry it on.
As nearly as can be learned, neither the
trustees of the home nor the Good Tem
plars have ever entertained the idea of
closing the retreat. While funds are not
as plentiful as they have been in times
past, the management is living within its
income, and intends so to remain. Cer
tain repairs are needed, but it is not tne
desire or aim of the trustees to incur ad
ditional indebtedness. Plans have been
talked over at various time* as to the best
means of raising fands in addition to the
sum given by the State and various lodges
to carry on tne work.
There is no doubt that during the com
ing year some plan wilt be devised to raise
money aud to bring the home into more
prominence, so that the liberal people of
the State will make such provisions for en
dowments as will enable the Good Tem
plars to add to the good they are accom
plishing.

RIVERSIDE, Cal., Feb. s.â An impor
tant move to land-owners of the Moreno
and Alessaudro Irrigation districts was
made to-day by the Board of Supervisors.
After listening to evidence for two days
upon a petition of the land-owners in
those districts for a reduction of water
rates, the board fixed the figure at 1G cents
an mcli instead of 35 cents, which has
been charged by the receiver of the Bear
Valley Cjmpany for two seasons past.
Since the receiver fixed the rate at 35 cents
nearly 1000 acres of trees and vines were
abandoned by the owners, as the rate was
prohibitory. A 16-cent rate will give new
hope to the land and orchard owners in
the districts, and the result will be bene
ficial to this county.
It is believed the Bear Valley Company
will carry ihc matter into the courts, but
the residents of the district do not antici
pate that any modification of the new rate
will be ordered.

STOCKTON MAY
BE INUNDATED
Rising Streams Threaten
to Flood Portions of
the City.
Residents of Lowland Districts
Preparing for a Hasty-
Departure.
Levees on Mormon Channel Give
Way and Water Sweeps
Over Rinches
STOCKTON, Cal. Feb. s.â There is
every prospect of a Hood here before mom
ing. Householders in the districts that
were flooded three yÂ«ars ago are preparing
for the waters that are presumed to be
coining down from the east, and every one
ie on the gui vive. East of here the coun
try is all under water. At Linden, near
the Mormon Channel, the water has not
been as hiirh in years, and all the old resi
dents say that a flDod at Stockton is in
evitable.
The only thing that will save the greater
part of the city and the residence portion
in the northern part of town is that the
levee* on the south bank of Mormon
Channel enst of here have broken in many
places, letting the rushing waters over the
fields south. The north bank nas thus far
resisted the onslaught of the currents and
driftwood, thus turning the freshet off
from the lands over which it would nat
urally bave flowed on to and over the
eastern and nortueastern part of town.
Much damage from back water is an
ticipated, as the many streams emptying
into Stockton channel have filled it so full
that the water cannot run off fast enongh
into the San Joaquin River, three miles
away. Just beyond the junction of these
streams is a narrow place in the river,
with nigh levees on both sides, and when
the waters strike this they pile up and
back onto Stockton.
On the north side of Stockton channel
the water is now even with t>ie top of the
wharf, and on the water front on the
south side it is over the wharf near the
sheds of the California Navigation and
Improvement Company. It is rising in
the channel slowly but surely, and every
one uere expects to see it over the per
manent bulkhead by morning. Between
Linden and Bellota, ease of here, the
country is covered by water.
Aayia'* Heavu Rainfall.
NAPA, Cal., Feb. s.â Heavy showers
last night Mid to-day raised the river
several feet, causing it to overflow the

damage has been done. The rainfall for
the season is 19.120 inches.
SEEN ON THE YUM A DESERT.
Architect Missing from Los Angeles Found
J urneymg Across the Dreary
Waste.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Feb. s.â Preston
& McKenzie, architects, with an office in
the Edgar block on Broadway, have dis
solved partnership in a most unusual
manner.
About tne middle of January last the
paitners, happening to meet upon the
street, stopped and chatted upon some
matters of business.
McKenzie, turning suddenly to his busi
neso associate, said: "Preston, good-by,
oid boy, be good to yourself," and walked
briskly away.
Preston returned to his office and ad
dressed himself to his business.
Night came, but no McKenzie. Other
days and nights came and went and still
no word from the absent partner. Preston,
for some unknown reason, made no ado
about the absence of his former associate
except to rnrke offhand inquiries as to
whether or not his friends had seen Mc-
Kenzie anywhere.
An acquaintance of Preston arrived to
day from Yuma, and reported to the de
serted partner that he had seen McKenzie
on the desert some miles south of Yuma,
in company with Harry and Flora Kreit
zer, brother and sister, all on the hurri
cane deck of a buckboard drawn by a pair
of mules.
The party told the prospector that they
were bound for the City of Mexico. They
were in a dilapidated condition and
almost without food and water.
The erratic conduct of McKenzie in
leaving here in the manner described has
no reasonable explanation so far as Pres
ton can ascertain.
He was a man of excellent habits and
good family connection. His friends,
who were for the first time told of his long
absence and the plight iie was found in on
the desert, expressed profound astonish
ment at the information.

ENGLAND'S EGYPTIAN POLICY.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach Makes a Boasi-
ful Statement and Is Rebuked by
Liberal Leaders.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. s.â ln the Honse
of Commons to-day Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach, Chancellor of the Exchequer, an
nounced that a further advance of Egyp
tian troops would be made toward Khar
toum next season.
At regarding the action of the Egyptian
tribunals Sir Michael Hicks- Beach said
that Greai Britain would not be worried
from her policy when her mind was made
op.
He then proceeded to move a resolution
eranting the Bum of Â£798,000 to meet the
total cost of the Anglo-Egyptian expedi
tion to Dongola, including the main
tenance oi the garrisons at Suukim and
elsewhere in the Soudan and the Iniian
troops in Egypt, which Great Britain
would pay.
The action of the mixed Court of Ap
peals in upsetting the judgment of the
Egyptian-Soudnn Commission in regard
to setting aside certain Egyptian funds
toward the expense of the Dongola expe
dition, he said, was calculated to prolong
British occupation of Egypt.
Great Britain had advanced the money
to pay Egypt's share of the expenses,
leaving Great Britain and Egypt to mutu
ally decide when the sum should be
repaid.
Right Hon. John Morley (Liberal) said
that the remarks of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer amounted to a challenge to
France and Russia to take issue with
Great Britain in the latter's Egyptian
policy.
In view of the sensitive condition of Eu
rope at the present time he declared that
nothing more rnsh could be uttered.
Sir Charles Dilke, Liberal, denounced
the Egyptian policy of the Government.
I>KSPX.RATE FIG H TIM G IX CRETE.
StutMuiman* Set fire to Cnnea and the
Place If -Vetr iiurnina-
LONDON, Eng.. Feb. 5.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Athens says that
desperate righting has occurred between
the Christians and Mohammedans in the
island of Crete. The Mussulmans have
set fire to the city of Canea and the place
is now burning. The city is in a state of
anarchy and a Christian is safe nowhere.
Many Christians who had locked them
selvpg in their houses were driven out by
the flames only to meet deirh at the hands
of the Turkish soldier?, who shot them
down on sight. A number of Christians
have succeeded in rinding refuge on the
warships In the harbor, but the out
look for those still in the city is very pre
carious. The situation is so critical that
marines have been landed from the Brit
ish and French warships to protect the ;
consulates of their respective Govern
ments.
A later dispatch to the Central News
S9ys that the Christian houses in Canea
have almost all been destroyed.
The dispatch further says that fully 300
persons have been killed in Canea. Many
of them lost their lives wniie attempting
to reach the warships. The various re
ports indicate that in the first instance
the Christians wera fully as much to
blame as the Mussulmans.
The Athens correspondent of the Daily
News says that the Consuls have arrived
at Canea, and have sent messages declar
ing that the situation is hopeless. He
adds that the most intense excitement
prevails in Athens.
M. de la Ynannis, Prime Minister, an
nounced to the Chamber to-day that the
Government, at the instigation of the
King, had ordered two warships to pro
ceed to Canea immediately, and that other
warships would follow them. The state
ment was received with the wildest en
thusiasm and cheers for the union of
GrpecÂ» and Crete.
Sir William Harcourt, tbe leader of the
Liberals, expressed regret at the unwise
language and gratuitous insults to the
powers which characterized the remarks
oi Sir Michael H cks- Beach.
George S. Cnrzon, Un Jer For^isfn Secre
tary, sought to minimize the effect of Sir
Michael's language and denied that it wr.s
in any way intended as a menace to
France.
Sir Henry M. Stanley, the African ex
plorer, Unionist member for North Lam
beth, said that Great Britain was only do
ing in Egypt what Russia was doing in
Siberia and France was doing Detween the
SenegÃl and the Niger River in Africa.
After some further discussion tbe reso
lution submitted by Sir Michael Hick=-
Beach was adopted by a vote of 169 to 57.
In the lobby, of the House t ere was
much comment upon the anti-French
tone of Sir Michael HicKs-Beach, anrt sur
prise was expressed by a number of mem
bers that he should have spoken as he did.
Tbe speech was thought to have such
significance that the full text was tele
graphed to Paris this evening.
UOUStMAX K*KEBB> APPEAL.
Veterinary Erperi* T)\ffnr at to thtt Aye
of the Mare Bethel.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. s.â The hear
ing in tbe appeal of Robert T. Kneebs,
American troiting-horse owner, against
the judgment of the courts condemning
him to nine months' imprisonment for
entering a "ringer" on the German tracks,
was continued to-day when the taking ol
expert testimony was resumed. Veter
inary Experts Mills and Klinger differed
with Professor Eggeling, who had pro
duced a plaster cast of the jaw of the
mare Bethel in support of his contention
that the mare examined in America, al
leged to have been Bethel, was not as oid
as Bethel wou!d have been.
Herr Klinger maintained that it was im
possible to declare the age of the horse by
an examination of the cast of the jaw
produced by Professor Eegeling. which
conld be that of v hoise born in 1886.
At about halt- past ten o'clock to-night
the court adjudged thut Ktieebs had been
guilty of fraud. He w:is sentenced to j
nine months' imprisonment, of which i
term seven months in which KneÂ«-bs hr.s
been in custody shall be considered part
of the sentence. Kneeus was also fined
1000 marks, and condemned to lose his
civil rights for two years. Kneebs re
serves the right to appeal from the de
cision.
Mr.nitnhn School (Jurxtion.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. s.â The Tablet,
the chief Catholic organ of Great Britain,
owned and managed by Cardinal Vaughan,
publishes an article to-day upon the Mani
toba school question in which it says:
"Hon. Edward D. Biake's opinion is a
sad disappointment. It is not clear that
the best method ior the Catholics is to
support Premier Laurier in irying to
carry negotiations to a succetsiul con

The Tablet advocates the appointment
of an apostolic delegate to Canada, who
might be able to focus Catholic opinion \o
formulate a Catholic united demand and
so effect a settlement of the difficulty.

THE BRITISH ARMY.
Obtains Coffee .Direct From the Planta-
tions.
The British Government formerly
bought the coffee intended for the armv
direct from the coffee plantations in Java,
and the term 'Old Gov't Java" is familiar
to all.
Mr. P. M. Hanney, now manager of the
grocery department of the great house of
Siegel, Cooper & Co., Chicago, was located j
In Java for about nine years, purchasing j
coffee for her Majesty's troops, and his |
ability to judge of the quality and flavor
of coffee will hardly be questioned
Experts of Tea. Coff-e, Tobacco and
Whiskey are not always free users of the
article they judce so keenly of. Indeed
the reverse is frequently true
In Mr. i 1 **" 15 3 family, Postum, the
health coffee made by the Postum Cereal i
Co., Lira, of Battle Creek, Mich., is used !
In place of c .ffee. The immediate cause
being that tne wife had trouble in digest-
ing coffee, and Mr. Hâ . knowing that t = .<â¢
grain beverage which looks so much like j
coffee and which fits the coffee drinkers >
taste was a pure and nourishing drink, â 
introduced it to his own family with the
result that the old ailments which were
directly attributable to c ffee-drinkin^
nave materially disappeared.
Proper adjustment of food and drink
means good bodies, clear minds and the
ability to push to the front and make a
success of life, while those who insi t upon
usme such dietary articles as they know
check digestion and impair the health,
will lag in the race for prosperity. Tne
law of the survival of the finest is plainly
marked. *
"Just as good" as Postum Cereal are
words used to defraud the public.

Tin Street Superintendent's Office

dition of the City.
The result of the present heavy and
. -constant rain has made engine 29, sta
â, tioned at Bryant and Eleventh streets,
useless in case it should be required to
roll out to an alarm. This disability is
â¢ owing to the bad condition of the streets
in the immediate vicinity of the engine
'â¢ house. The point where those two streets
cross each other is met by the converging
line of the railroad track of the Southern
â¢ Pacific .Company, which is blocked by
fTeightcars, sidetracked, leaving a pas
sageway across the track an impossibility.
â ' To get out of the engine-house with a
= y.hree-ton load means to pet stuck in the
. ihoies within a few yards of the door
"7 way and there remain until jackscrewed
1 out, as horsepower would be unavailing.
U'nis is only one sample, however, of the
condition of some of the streets in that
ponion of the City since the present down
pour commenced.
Along the lower portion of the City on
Davis, Front, Drumm and the intersect
ing streets, cellars have been Hooded and
considerable damage done to goods stored
therein.
. " On the northwest corner of Clay and
Drumm streets the sewer culvert became
choked, causing the rush of water to back
up and flood the street and sidewalks.
To save the cellars irom becoming flooded
pumps had to be rigged to draw the water
off. -
The sewer on Douglas and Diamond at
Twenty-four h street got stopped and the
f usb of water from the adjacent heights
running in a torrent into the sewer caused
a water spout to ascend fully twe;ve feet
in height, which attracted considerable
attention trom the persons residing in
the vicinity.
The low. section at North Beach has
also suffered from choked sewera and
broken cuiverts and manholes.
To obtain anything like an exact ac
count uf the damaged condition of the
streets, sewers and culveris would entail a
force of men and a thorough examination
ol the entire streets oi the City. Hereto
fore a book was kept in the office of the
Superintendent of Streets, in which ail
lOinpiainls oi damaged streets, sewersand
culverts were entered for the information
of the jublic, who are required to foot the

stitutional, he recognizes that further contest
Â»s useless, and he now declares that all his

sible. â -â ->â¢< -,â¢..>:-â¢...-
If others who have been with Mr. Baker in
coutestitiK irrigation take the same view of
the situation, water will be on the plains of
this district within a year, and diversified
products, which water alone will bring, will
be an accomplished fact. Mr. Baker freely ex
presses his opinion that the best course to pur
sue, now that there can be no question as to
the legality of the law. is that ail should pull
toeether and prevent any further delay.
Mr. Baker is one of the wealthiest land
owners in Modesto district, and his views will
have much weight with his farmer friends.
Mr. Baiter favors the proposition that bonds
be sold for cash and that the canal work be
done by the farmers in the district, so that the
money for the work will be kept In the county.

Before introducing the speakers, he ex
plained tne system of education in vogue
in France. The aftirmativi.' side of the
question was supported by S. W. Charles
'87. C. M. Bradley '!Â» and A. li. Morgan
'98, while E. E. Painter '98, H. W. Gruu
sky '99 and Mrs. Margaret Hood '99, sup
ported the negative. No team work was
attempted, as the judges decided on the
merits of each individual rather than ou
the strength of the oj posinsr sides.
Mrs. Margaret Hood, as the representa
tive of t.je Woman's Saturday Night
Club, fully '.ustained the honor conterred
upon her by that flourishing organization.
Her experience in teactilng gave ncr a
decided advantage in the discussion of the
subject connected with education. Mrs.
Hood speaks with great decision, and if
an opponent seeks to establish his point
by a weak chain of reasoning she points
out its weakness with great clearness.
A. B. Morgan made another of his tell
ing speecues this evening. He is now a
Stanford representative in both the Carnot
and the regular intercollegiate debates
and is the first to win this double distinc
tion. His selection was conceded by the
students in general aa soon as it was
known that he would try for a place.
Morgan's style is easy and his argu
ments are convincing. While a success
lul campaign speaker, he does not assume
a "spread eagle" style. On the contrary,
he impresses his point upon his hearers
by skillfully massing his arguments
rather than by brilliant flashes of rhet
oric.
S. W. Charles was until this year princi
pal of the Palo Alto High School. Al
though a young man, be Has had con
siderable experience in public speaking
and is *xceptionaliy easy on the piat
form. His major stuiy is law.
STANFORD'S STUDENT BODY.
Its Financial Condit.on Found to Be
Satisfactory â Treasurer Morrison's
Statement.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. Feb.
5. â The committee appointed to audit the
accounts of F. W. Morrison, treasurer of
the student body, commend the busi
nesslike manner in which be conduces
the affairs of the student organization.
The committee found the receipts, ex
penditures and bnances in the various
accounis up to January 1, 1^97, to be as
follows:
Tne condition of the s:udent body at
the close of thÂ»> year was such that if it
had closed up its affairs January 1, 1897,
the assets would have balanced the liabil
ities and it would Have beer, out of debt.
The report closes with an admomt o:i
that the executive committee pursue its
present conservative policy.
All the officers this year merit a great
deal of praise, as they have reduced to
nil a debt which amounted to $1800 last
September.
T c senior class recently appointed a
committee :o find out the financial stand
ing of the class. During tne junior year
each class publishes an annual which is
usually unsuccessful from a financial
point of view.
The '97 annual failed to pay expenses
by about $325. Of this amount $.'OO will
probably be assumed by the clasÂ«. The
remainder will probably be covered by
disposing of several "trade advertise
ments." About rifiy copies of the annual
are yet unsold and tne class officials hope
to realize something on these.
After having carefully estimated the
outstanding accounts and the probable
expense of the graduation exercises the
committee on finances is of the opinion
that an assessment of $5 will relieve the
fla-s of all present and future indebted
ness.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6. 1897.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Monowai Crossed the Bar Yesterday and Had a Lively Time of It
There Was an Occasional Heavy Break and the Decks of the Stout Ship Were Well
Drenched Before She Reached the Open Sea*
STARVED OUT
A STOWAWAY
He Made a Mistake in the
Steamer's Sailing
Day.
Stood Hunger and Thirst for
Twenty- Four Hours and
Then Gave In.
Violent Death of a Saior Aboard the
British Ship RLudilan
Castle.
There was quite an exciting time of it
aboard the Oceanic Steamship Company's
Monowai yesterday morning. The
steamer was to have sailed last Thursday,
but the English mails delayed her. In
consequence an unfortunate stowaway
bad to give himself up. He was starved
out.
Wednesday night be managed to stow
himself away in one of the whale
boats, after partaking of a hearty meal.
Thursday came, and when the steamer
made no move he wondered what was the
matter.
D inns the night the rain came down in
torrents, and yesterday morning,
drenched to the skin and ravenously
hungry, he crawled out of his hidin?
piace in search of a meal. Chief Otlicer
Graham spied him and at once ordered
him ashore. In response to a piteous
plea lie was allowed to climb into the
boat again and recover his scant baggage*
Ue was then marched off the wharf and
that was the last seen of him. lie tod
Purser Bendall that be had a few dollars
and was anxious to reach Coolgardie,
where he expected to make a formne.
The Monowai look out the following
passengers in ibe cabin:
For Honoluluâ Captain I. Bray, A. R. Col
born and wile, ii- E l oii-nian, E. \\ . F.ekles,
Miss A. Einmeiutn, t'. h. Fairer, T. T. French

and wife, S. E. Laidley; Mrs. H. W. Lewis, child
aud nurse; U. Sibbald, E. B. Wolff.
Captain Fletcher, who was here last
year in the ship The ilahnemann, was
uiso a passenger. He only arrived from
Liverpool a couple of days ago and is on
his way to Honolulu to take command of
the ship NorthDrook. She had to put
into Honolulu in distress and as there has
been some dispute over the repairs
Fletcher was sent out to take charge of
affairs.
Captain I. Bray is going to Honolulu to
take charge of the missionary schooner
Morning Star, now tied up in that port.
lie will relieve Captain C. H. Garland and
will take the vessel out on her usual
yearly cruise among the South bea
islands.
Captain Carey and Chief Engineer Me-
Caig were so far recovered as to be able to
be on duty when the steamer sailed. Both
gentlemen were on the sick list during tne
entire siay of the vessel in port, and they
were more than giad when sailing day
came.
The big steamer made a pretty picture
as she crossed the bar yesterday outward
bound. Just as she passed from sight one
of ihe rollers caught iier, and heavy laden
as she was, ocr stern was thrown away up
in the air while the succeeding toiler
broke all over the forward part of the ship.
This was to have been the last trip of the
big steamer, but as the new one just com
pleted lor the line will not be ready for a
few months, the chances are that the
Monowai will make one more trip to San
Francisco.
Max Kalish, the popular agent of the
Humboldt Steamship Company, came
back from Eureka on the steamer Corona
yes;erdÂ»y. He says the new Humboidt
will be ready for service the laner part of
the month and thnt sÂ«.e will have her
trial trip about the 14th inst. She will Me

berth on the water front next Monday,
and then the finishing touches will be
put on.

outside the heads yesterday and bad to
put back under sail, fche will be repaired
at ones and wyi probably continue her
voyage to-day.
The steam schooner Excelsior brought
in yesterday the largest car o of sait that
has ever come from Carmen Inland. Ii
will be sent to r<-hiu-rie-i here and turned
into a marketable article. Carmen Island
salt is said to be of very fine grade. Tne
Exc lsior sailed from here for Guaymas
with a load of railway ties, and on the
way down she ran iuto a hurricane and
the* entire deckload was washed over
board. From Guaymas sue went to Car
men Island, thence to San Francisco.
The City of Peking pot in norn the
Orient early yesterday morning, and had
it not been for the heavy weather encoun
tered durine the latter part of the trip
she would nave reached port Thursday
afiernoon. Tne most valuable item in the
vessel's cargo was GOO cases of opium, the
duty on which will mount into a good
sized fortune.
Two representatives of the Japanese
Government came over on the steamer.
They will superintend the construction of
the warships to be built by the Union Iron
Works for the Mikado.
The bark bea King from Sydney for San
Francisco is having a bard time oi it. Ac

DON'T LIKE ME. GUNST.
The Police Commissioner's Name Men
tioned by the Cigar-Makers at
. the Trades Council. <â ? - .
The question of Eastern tenement-made
cigars was before the Federated Trades
last evening, and in the discussion Police
Commissioner Gunst came in for no small
share of censure, as he deals in some of
the ostracized brands.
At a previous meeting of the council
this same question came up and Michael
Raphae!, who was sent out hare by the
New York cigar-makers to agitate against
certain brand-, gave a list of those which
had beeii condemned. Ttie New York
firm opposed is Krebs, Wertheim & Snif
fer and the brands it handles are several
dealt i:i by the folice Commissioner.
A committee was appointed to enforce
the blue label regulation, and saw Mr.
Gunst and reported at last night's meet
ing. The report was in the form of a duly
attested affidavit.
In the report the committeemen com
plain that Mr. Gunst received them in
anything but a courteous manner. The
repor: stated that he told them the sooner
iliey, and particularly Raphael, who was
one of tne committee, were run out of the
country the better, and tbat he did not
care a tinker's imprecation for them, and
tbat he did not propose to be dictated to
by them.
Tne reading of this report brought sev-
I eral members of the council to their feÂ°t,
! each eager to get in the nrÂ« roast. The
I lang:ia.'e was forcible and pointed. Fi
; nally the whole matter was referred to tne
j executive committee and anotuercommh
tee was appointed to wait on Mr. Gunst
and see how he would receive it after be-
I iog toid that a mass meeting might be
: called to consider the result of the confer
â¢ ence.
AN EMPLOYES' SOCIAL.

TO CONCENTRATE TBIALS.
Prosecutions for Impure Food Dealings
to Be lJroujjlit in One Court.
Isidor Jacobs, chairman of the pure
food committee of the Council of Associ
ated Industries, has been securing an
understanding with the prosecuting attor
neys la the police courts and has nlso
conferred with the Judges of these courts
concerning prosecutions under the pure
food law.
"Our aim," said Mr. Jacobs yesterday,
" is to have all the prosecutions brought
in one court, instead of scattering cases.
We have spent considerable time aud
energy. We have particularly conferred
with Attorney Reynolds of Judge Low's
court. There will be many cases to be
tried, for many arrests will be made
within the coming three months. Attor
ney Reynolds ha^ agreed to make a study
of the inatier and to assist us. We havn
sent a letter out to boards of health all
over the State asking them to co-operate
in securing pure food. The movement,
which has ju?t fairly begun, will be large
am; important."

HONOLULU TOO
WARM FOR THEM
Philadelphia Society Elopers
Return on the
Peking.
Cavalier Smith and Mrs. Norris
Seek Seclusion in the
States.
The Gentleman Showed Some Nervous
ness, but His Companion Was
Perfectly Self-Possesssd.
It is rare that the Pacific Mail Com
pany's City of Peking arrives in port with
out a story aboard. This time it was the
story of an elopement, and the couple
went to the California Hotel.
The passenger list was as follows: Miss
L. N. Duryea, Mrs. S. W. B Diehl, Jurtce
and Mrs. C. H. Garoutte, Miss M. Hall,
Rev. James Homy, .Louis Imbert, J. H.
Kirkpatrick, Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Brown,
Mr. end Mrs. Henry Smith, Miss G.
Garoutte, Fred Yates, W. J. Corwin (U. S.
N.), H. A. Isenberg, K. Aoki, Mr. and
Mrs. Jas. EUinge'r, Mrs. A. F. Dixon, Mi-s
A. Garoutte, Mrs. P. Yates and child,
Payma>ter A. \V. Brown (U. S. N\), C. J.
Fischer and M. Wadagaki.
The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Smith are the
couple in question, and ths Hawaiian
Star had this to say about them soon alter
their arrival in Honolulu:
"Mrs. C. C. Pinckney Norris has eloped
with Cavalier Smith, and they are now on
their way to Japan. Mrs. Norris is one
of the best-known women in the fashion
able sec, and is the mother of two chil
dren, while Mr. Smith is equally as well
known, both in the society and club
world, nml is the father of five children."
MrÂ«. Norris and Mr. Smith eloped from
Fhiiiidelpliia on December 24 last. They
came direct to Ban Francisco and took the
steamer Peru for the Orient. Instead of
coing to Yokohama, however, they
changed their minds and stopped off at
Honolulu. They traveled in good style
and baa the bridal chamber on the
steamer, and upon reaching the capital ot
the island republic they rented a fur
nished cottage and lived like two turtle
doves.
Mrs. Ncrris was formerly Miss Maria
Gibson, and is a niece of the late Henry
Gibson of Philadelphia. She possesses a
fortune that is estimated at between
$250,000 and $30J,000. Her husband is a
prominent man in Philadelphia society
circles, and is a member of the Philadel
phia Rabbit, Country and other fashion
able cubs.
Smith is a brother of A. Donaldson
Smith, a well-known explorer. He was
left a lortune some years ago, but it is be-
Jieved ho has squandered a large portion
of it. Before his departure from Puiladel
phia it is said Smith provided to a certain
extent tor his wile and rive children.
The elopement of Mrs. Norris and Smith
was not discovered until a week after they
bad left Philadelphia. Mrs. Norris in
formed her husband at the time of her
departure that she was going to visit rela
tives in Baltimore. At the same time
Smith left his family, making a plausible
excuse about having to go to New York.
The pair fled westward, and a week later
detectives were on their track. They are
now on their way back to "face the
music."
Smith is on the passenger list as 35 years
of age, while Mrs. Smith is entered as 33.
She is a tall, shapely blonde, with large
blue eyes. Sue was dressed in a dark
cheviot tailor-made suit, over which she
wore a short broadcloth jacket. She
seemed unconcerned, but her companion
was nervous and was visibly confused
when a woman's underskirt, was pulled
out of his trunk along with some o! his
own clothing.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith registered at the
California as from this State, but when in
terviewed they positively denied they
were the Smiths in question. Smith said
they were not irom San Francisco, but
from another part of the State â from what
part, however, he positively declined to
state. Ha seems nervous and ill at ease,
but she is ca m and self-possessed and
never loses her presence of mind.
for the Carnival.
Representatives of Berkeley and Stanford
universities will meet at carnival headquar
ters this afternoon a 2 o'clock, to arrange the
details for "College night," which has been
set apart for them during carnival week. It
is the intention of the carnival management
to request the two leading universities to take
the management of the affair into their hand*,
iaviting the co-operation of the students Â«<f
the other colWges in the affair, so as to
make it illustrative of college life in Califor
nia. The programme r.as not yet been elabo
rHied, but it will conclude wiih a grand stu
dents' ball at the Mechanics' Pavilion. It will
be left to the students 10 determine whether
this will be a mask affair or an ordinary
dancing party.

IMb CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
California reaches the Cabinet at last.
Congratulations to Secretary McKenna.
The new tariff bill carries prosperity on
ita face.
Reciprocity and $50,000,000 more of rev
enue sounds veil.
Decadent journalism wears the mask of
a faker, but its trade is blackmail.
Every city of note in Nevada is getting
ready to fight its way to prosperity.
Leave your orders 10-day for The St'nday
Call and assure yourself good reading to
morrow.
The Legislature is sticking to business
well enough, but the people expect it to
stick also to economy.
The press of the interior has begun to
give uotice that tlie ground is thoroughly
wet, and no more rain is needed.
Before the Examiner gets through it will
announce positively that Butler is Li
Yung Yuen and killed Little Pete.
Extravagant appropriation bills are
sprouting thick and fast at Sacramento,
and it is time to set 10 work with the
pruning-knife.
The attempt of the Examiner eang to
blackmail the water company has been
stopped, and we can count oue more vic
tory for honesty.
Butler repudiates the Examiner's alleged
intervi-w and "It will hardly be necessary
for the Examiner to reiterate the statement
and assert it is absolu'eiy true."
Fake telegram?, fake interviews and fake
advertisements are intended by the Ex
aminer merely to fool the people. "When
it means business it hunts a subsidy.
Creelman, Li Yung Yuen and Butler
form a congenial trio tor Willie Hearst,
Lawrence and Ambrose Bierce. It is the
yard of daisies and the yard of pups in
combination.
Sending, women to interview murderers
and makine sensations of their reports is
one of the reasons why there are so many
silly and half-crazy women in tua world
to make pets of criminals.
The profit obtained on a 15-cent adver
tisement with a yard of pups thrown in
may be sufficient to help float along a
fake journal, but it would not do for one
engaged in legitimate business.
The coin from Collis Wasteful Willie takes,
And with Long Green divides the stakes;
Lone Green pays Bierce, who then emits
a roar
To make rich Collis pony up some more.
The promptness with which the Repub
licans of Congress nave set about the
work of tariff revision gives encourage
ment to every indu try in the country,
and assures the speedy coming of better
times.
If Hearst discharces some of the sub
ordinates on whom he throws the blame
for the fakes and frauds of the Examiner
the public would have more confidence in
his integrity and less suspicion of his
courage.
The blame and the shame of the secret
subsidy from the Southern Pacific were
thrown by Hearst upon his subordinates,
but as he did not prosecute any of them it
is safe to say they turned the money into
his pocket, and lie knew it.
Fake advertisements in a newspaper
destroy public confidence as effectually as
faKO stories in the news columns, and for
that reason people pay no attention to an
advertisement in the Examiner. They
can never be sure that it means business.
If the Eraminer deducted from the
amount of its advertising the illegal lottery
advertisements and the fake advertise
ments it buys with a yard of puppies it
would have less advertising to brag of,
but. it could then boast of doing a legiti
mate business.
The action of the Board of Supervisors
in calling for a complete statement of the
accounts of the water company is now ad
mitted by the Examiner to be right. The
howl for arbitrary reduction has been
silenced. This look 3 like another vindi
cation.
Now that we have forced the Examiner
to abandon its efforts to excite passion
and prejudice against corporations in or
der to extort hush money from the water
and the gas companies the work of fixing
rates can be carried out with that caini
ness and impartiality which are necessary
for accurate results.
By preventing Long Green Lawrence
and the rest of Willie Hearst's gang from
extortine money from the water and the
pas companies we have enabled those
companies to furnish water and gas to the
people more cheaply than they could
bad they been compelled to pay blackmail,
and to that extent we have rendered the
public a service of no small importance.
Bnt a little while ago the New York
Journal and the Sa:s Francisco Examiner
made a great outcry against the sensation
alism of sending women to report prize
fights and interview murderers, and now
the Examiner is to recommit the offense
bef â  re the noise of its former professions
of reform have had time to be forgotten
even by the most indifferent citizen
NAILING A LIE.
The Examiner of yesterday contained an editorial addressed to John D. Spreckels.
The first sentence reads as follows: "You (Mr. Spreckels) are a property-owner in
San Francisco, a young man of wealth and fair repute, the son of one of the most re
spected citizens of the community." To this, the editor and proprietor of The Call
gives his most cordial assent. There is, however, a phrasa in the sentence which
shows the cunning of the assassin who wrote it. The phrase is that in which Mr.
Spreckels is referred to as "yonng man of wealth and fair repute." That the charac
ter of Mr. Sprectels stands absolutely above criticism is well known. He is liontet,
honorable and courageous. He has never been known to go back upon his word or to
join hands with any man or set of men against tne public good. "We are not required
here, and it is not expected of us, that we will enter into any further eulogy of Mr-
Spreckels, for whom we have the tenderest feelings of personal friendship and the
highest regard as an honorable business man and a citizen of t !iÂ« best, repute.
The Exaviiner further says, referring to Mr. Spreckels: "You are understood to
be the owner of The Call." The Exaviiner then add 3 some cowardly remarks
regarding the character of the editor of The Call, and entirely ignore 3 the fact that
he has stood the test for over twenty years in journalism; that he is to-day the pro
prietor of the leading paper in San Jose, and, without boasting, has as many personal
friends as any citizen of that beautiful city. But so far as we are personally con
cerned we do not feel justified in further answering or denying any charges which the
lying Examiner may make. The Examiner then goes on and declares that "the people
would be very reluctant to bf lieve that you (Mr. Bpreckels) would take money or pro
mote a scheme of public plunder. Your training, your wealth and your associations
forbid the supposition."
To all of this the editor of The Call pives the heartiest approval. "Moreover,"
says the Examiner, "your brother voted as a Supervisor against the present outrageous
water order." It will also be remembered, and the Examiner, if it had an honest
thought or an honest intention, would publish the fact, that The Call approved the
course of A. B. Spieckels most heartily on that occasion. Again, the cowardly sheet
says: "Yet, it is currently reported that a large sum of money has passed from the
leagued gas, electric-light and water monopolies to somebody connected with The
Call. The exact amount even is specified." The Examiner further adds that "Â¥ou
(Mr. Soreckels) owe it to yo"urself, to your family and to your name to find out
who is dragging your reputation through the mud aud put an instant stop to his
operations." The Examiner made this statement, knowing it to be a barefaced lie,
and we here and now demand of it that it produce any evidence showing the truth of
this statement or forever be branded as a venomous liar. Nevertheless, we agree
with the Examiner that Mr. Spreckels owes it to himself to expose any one who is in
any manner "dragging his reputation throagh the mud and put a stoD to his opera
tionÃ." AYe sincerely believe that Mr. Spreckels would do this, and we thus most
publicly request of him to disclose any fact or circumstance which would in anywise
connect any person associated with The Call with having received any sum of money,
or a promise to receive any sum of money, from any human being connected with
the gas company, waier company, electric-light company or the Southern Tacific
Company.
We would like to add one word here with reference to the statement that "you
(Mr. Spreckels) are understood to be the owner of The Call." The truth is, and it Is
easily established, that Charles M. Shortrldge is the owner and sole proprietor of the'
property known as the San Francisco Call. He received the title thereof directly
from the Circuit Court of the United States, and to make it some little inducement
to the blackmailers of the Examiner to bring forth their evidence the proprietor of
The Call will pay $1000 for any evidence (oral or written) which will show tnat the
title to The Call stands in any other name, or belongs in law or in equity to any
other human being than himself. That he is under personal obligations to Mr.
Spreckels is true; that he has given his note for money borrowed is also true; that he
has paid during the past two years the interest, on this money is likewise true; but
that he is more prateful than these poor words may express any one who knows him
will admit. His personal friendship and obligation to Mr. Spreckels are of the very
highest order. He has been in the past and will be in the future loyal to him per
sonally and to his interests.
Every human being who reads these lines will well understand that the motive
which induced the article to be written in the Examiner was not lo aid or help the
fair name of Mr. Spreckels, but was written for the purpose of tearing down The Call
and with the dishonorable intent of in some manner changing the good-fellowship
which exists between the editor of The Call and Mr. Spreckels. It has been made
evident tnat the backing which Mr. Spreckels gave the editor of The Call has enabled
him to build up a great and powerful paper. It cannot be denied, and our books are
oper. for inspection, that The Call has gained in the past two years more than five
times as many new subscribers as has the Examiner, and the records will prove also
that The Call has been more largely patronized by the advertising public than the
Examiner, notwithstanding the lie which it publishes at the head of its columns.
It is stated by the Examiner in the same article, that "the records of the courts in
San Jose may assist you (Mr. Spreckels) in the search." It is true that the records of
the court* are open for inspection, and upon examination it will be found that not
one word or jot or tittle exists on the records of those courts which in any wise reflects
upon the honor or integrity of the editor of The Call, and it may be further stated
that not one human bein<Â» in all this State or elsewhere can be found who will testify
or who can produce evidence that the editor of this paper ever blackmailed any
person or corporation. We have at times fought for men and for principles, but
we conducted that light openly and honorably, as we p.re conducting the contest
now being waged between the blackmailing Examiner and The Call, whose integrity
of purpose and action no man can honestly assail.
SECRETARY M'KENNA.
The announcement yesterday that Judge
McKenna of the United States Circuit
Court has been invited to accept a posi
tion in the Cabinet of President-elect Me-
Kinley and that be has accepted the office
was no surprise to the people of Califor
nia. For a long time past it ban been
fairly well assured that some citizen of
California would have a place in the Cabi
net, and of late it has been well under
stood that the man chosen for the honor
was Judge McKenna.
While there was no surprise in the ap
pointment, there was none the leÂ«s con
siderable gratification and pleasure. The
people of California have long desired to
see the prestige of the State in the Union
recognized by the selec ion of one of its
citizens for a Cabinet position, and the
appointment of almo-t any Californinn
would therefore have been received with
satisfaction by the people. The selection
of Judge McKenna added to the gratifica
tion felt since iiis eminent worth and fit
ness for the high office are known through
out the State and the people are assured
that he will well and ably represent Cali
fornia in the high office to which, he has
been chosen.
Joseph McKenna has been a resident of
California ever since 1855. He was edu
cated to a large extent in the public
schools of the iState, has represented hiÂ»
county in the State Legislature and his
district in Congress. He is, therefore, not
only well informed concerning the needs
and interests of California, but is thor
oughly identified with its recent history
and its aspirations. In all positions of
trust he has shown himself faithful to the
best interests of the people and loyal to
his own high conceptions of public duty.
In whatever office he was called upon to
fill he has given new proofs of his ability,
his courage and his conscientious regard
for personal integrity and public welfare.
The new Secretary will enter uuon liis
duties a well-trained man in every re
s;.ect. He has been tested as a private
citizen engaged in the practice of law and
in various offices of a legislative and judi
cial capacity. In his present high posi
tion as Judge of the United States Dis
trict Court he has added to honors al
ready attained and distinguished himself
among the younger Judges of the coun
try. From what he has achieved in the
past it is easy to predict that his career in
the Cubinet will be one of more than
ordinary honor to himself and service to
the people.
It will be by no means a conventional
courtesy which will be extended to Judge
McKenna in the congratulations he will
receive trom all parts of the State upon
his appointment. The people are aware
that he well deserves the office, and feel
more than ordinary State pride in hi 3
selection. As a matter of fact, congratu
lations upon the appointment should be
addressed not more to Judge McKenna
than to President-elect McKinley and to
the whole people of the United States, in
whose service he will be engaged.
The advance report of duties proposed
for the new tariff show that California in
dustries, so far as they have been dealt
with up to this time, are to be protected,
and we can now begin to see the end of
the long depression. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1897.
THE LEGISLATURE.
Tne people or California are gratified
by the attention which the Legislature is
giving to the business beforp it, and by the
fact that, up to this time, there has been
but one sucgestion of a scandal connected
with its work. It will be well, however,
for the legislators to remember that the
people expect something more than atten
tion to business and the absence of scan
dal; they expect economy to be practiced
in every direction and the maintenance of
State institutions to be provided for with
out undue taxation upon citizens.
Many of the appropriation biils intro
duced into the Legislature are, to say t 1 c
least, suggestive of extravagance. It is
well understood that many of these have
no chance for passage, but the legislators
should make it equally certain that none
of them should be passed until every
vestige of undue expenditure is stricken
from it. Economy at the present time is
something more than a political cry. It
is an urgent necessity of the present con
dition of our industries, and no legislator
will be held guiltless who knowingly votes
for any measure which will impose upon
the taxpayers a burden which is not abso
lutely necessary for the welfare and right
ful progress of the commonwealth.
The quietness which has marked the
session of the Legislature has not dulled
public interest in its work. The people
and the press are watchful of every step
that is taken either in the Assembly or in
the Senate, and it will be impossible for
any extravagance to be undertaken there
that will not lie noticed. The Republican
members of the Legislature should bear
thnt fact in mind, and remember that they
and the Republican party generally will
be held responsible for the work of the
session. If they expect to be re-elected,
and if they desire their party to retain its
hold upon the confidence of the people,
they must so shape the legislation of the
session that, their work can be upheld in
the press and on tne stump during the
next campaign.
We have no desire to impute evil where
no evil is int*n<led. Therefore we make
no charge at ihis time of extravagance
against any particular member. We are
ready to credit every honest legislator
with a desire to serve the interests of the
State at large, as well as of his own con
stituency. It is simply because we recog
nize this desire on the part of the ma
jority of the legislators that we abstain
from hasty criticism upon their actions
and content ourselves with urging them
to be careful of every measure which
comes before them.
The time has come to re-establish among
the people of California a fall confidence
in the men whom they elect to represent
them in the State Legislature, ami the op
portunity offered at the present session
should not be lost by any man who has a
sufficient sense of his responsibility to his
constituents, his party and the State to
know what duty means.
SOMETHING ABOUT LYMANJ GAGE
New York Sun.
Personally Lyman J. Gage, who has ac
cepted the treasury portfolio from President
elect McKinley, is democratic to a decree that
will be pleasing to decrlers of convention
lity. Mr. Gage does not put his .'eu-t on the
desk, or wear his trousers in his boots, or his
hat at a leaning-tower angle; nor is his man
ner of that inviting type which warrants the
caller to s!ap him on the back. He is. how
ever, the most accessible public man in Chi
cago. The office-boy of â : hicago has not
reached the state of importance that char
acterizes him in Xew York, but it is the rule
in the banks of the Lake City to have your
name sent forward if you wish a conierence
with the president, this rule does not apply
to any official in the First National of which
Mr. Gage is the head. The door of nis room is
â I**7l open. Mr. Gage's desk is in soch prox
imity to the entrance that he may address the
caller who halts there, and without any ex
tra exertion. Tbe special policemen so con
spicuous in most monetary Institutions is
never seen about the office of Mr. Guge.
When the caller is admitted, by an indica
tion from Mr. Gage, the latter does not rlead
important business in order to hasten the
interview to conclusion. Mr. Gage is an easy
listener, and when the mission is stated he
answers rather deliberately than otherwise,
avoiding superfluous words. His stateliuess
ot physique disappears as lie talks. Frigid us
he seems when first, approached, he is recep
tive, responsive and sympathetic. These
traits In his character and his accessibility
have caused him to be imposed upon, but
such experiences have not changed his habits.
If Mr. Gage has a coacu it must be for the
benefit of his family. His home, a plain
house, is near Lincoln Park, and is two miles
from the bank. In spite of the uncertainties
of the Chicago climate and the pranks of the
cable system, Mr. Gage tnveUover the cable
tars summer and winter. People in the
vicinity of State and Division streets know to
, the minute when Mr. Gage will board the car
at that point on his way to his office.
Mr. Gage is fond of the theater, but unless
the occasion is extraordinary he is never seen
in a bos, except during the opera season or
the Theodore Thomas concert season at the
Auditorium, and only when the last events
are patronized by him does he ride in a car
riage. Mr. and Mrs. Gage gj out very little iv
society, and yet the home oi Mr. Gage is a
lavonteone with Chicago's best people. Mr.
Gage prefers the neighborly call.
Mr. Gage became generally known to the
country on account of his interest in the
World's, Fair of 1893. He was the first presi
dent of tiie directory of the Columbian Expo
sition, and although he declined to remain at
the head of the directory he never neglected
an opportunity to show that he was proud of
his city und its efforts to make the fair a suc
cess. Theie are a few men in Chicago who
know how to sit a banquet through and find
their own hats. Mr. Gage is one of them.

HIS RECORD KEPT CLEAN.
Lyncbburg News.
A few days ago a tramp called at a well
known home in the city at about breakfast
time and asked for something to eat The
gentleman of the house informed the tramp
that there was a pile oi wood in his back yard,
and that if he would saw up a quantity oi it
he would t;ive him a breakfast.
The tramp agreed, aud the gentleman of the
house forthwith conducted him to the pile of
wood, and after pointing out to Him the saw
retired Into the house.
A short time thereafter, wishing to 6ee how
the tramp was progressing, he went out into
the yard. Tne trump had disappeared and
not a log of wood had been sawed. As he ap
proached the pile of wood he uoticed a piece oi
paper fastened to the Â«aw, and on it were writ
ten these words:
Just tell them thÂ«t you saw we,
iv you never saw me saw.
SOON THERE WILL BE NO SUCH THING AS A SECRET.
Any one may be told tnings about himself which he never even dreamed of. For instance,
yon can be shown just how you wouid act under certain circumstances or when certain
emotions are arouseo. And one can be told whetner or not his love is genuine. But only
scientists who have made careful study can
do this correctly.
Now society ha 3 a new fad.
It is that oi judging the characters of hu
manity by the "windows of the sou!," and
any of those who have become interested in It
can tell you lots of things about yourself.
How do they doit?
A writer who knows nil about it gives his
knowledge to the world through the columns
of The Call, and it will all appear on Sunday.
Did you ever try to think, out just what
"power" was ?
Sometimes there is enough of that strange
thing called "power" in a little object that
would not cover an inch on a plane surface to
wreck buildings and take hundreds of human
lives.
Consider the power in a torpedo that could
sink one of onr large warships. But a way
has been found to protect warships from these
torpedoes.
The Sunday Call has a long article on the subject which it will be worth your whlla
to rend.
If you like cats tou will enjoy yourself to the utmost in reading about that Black Cat.
It's not a troublesome cat with one eye gone, but a bright, intelligent cat. One of those
that you wouldn't be afr&id to meet in some future reincarnation.
Though you dou't want to wait until the cat catches up with you.
If you don't like cats, you will be interested anyway in The Call's bright and novel story
to-morrow.
The "hobby" story is bound to catch your fancy. It treats of people you know, and their
fads. Then there is the children's page with so many pretty stories and puzzles and apt
illustrations; and there are characteristic letters trom the little ones, and very pleasant they
are, too.
The society people have received a great deal of attention this week, and their doings are
faithfully chronicled. There are fashions straight from Paris. Descriptions of bewitching
cowns and hats and lingerie. Besides, to lover 3of whist, there are new points on the game to
be found in The SUNDAY Call which are invaluable. Aad you cannot lind them any
where else.
The book page is not the least among the attractions, and will give you news concerning the
best authors aud their latest works.
In fact, there is hardly an item of live interest to our people that The BXJKDAT Call will not
touch upon. Don't fnil to have a bright, newsy sheet to read after breakfast Sunday morning-
The fcCNDAY Call is what you want.
THE COW-PUNCHERS LAMENT THE "DUCHESS."
"Yes, the 'Duchess' is dead," said one of the habitues of a downtown resort, as he elevated
his feet to .he top of a small table in a retired corner, says the Washington Post. "Yes, she' B
deaU, poor old Duchess, and who do you suppose will wear the most crape for her? It won't
be the society women who read her and pretended they didn't really care about her; it won't
be the boarding-school girls who smuggled
her stories into bed in the dormitories after
the lights were supposed to be out, nor It
won't be the ladies below stairs, but another
class of citizens entirely. It will be the cow
punchers and mule-skinners out West. As
soon as the news gets around their way they
will genuinely mourn and assure one another
that the light of modern literature bm gone
out, though that won't be the way they will
probably put it. They will discuss it around
the campfires at night, digging their boot
heels into the sand the while, and interlard
their eulogies with profanity. But the gr:ef
will be genuine, more so than will be printed
in any literary review.
"The cow-puncher is going fast. He will
soon follow the Duchess to her long home, but
while he lusts he is one of her stanch support
ers. This may seem strange, but it is so. No
less an authority than Teduy Roosevelt com
ments on it in his 'Life on the Rauge,' and I
have noted it myself, knock ing around west of
the hundredth meridian. The cow-puncher
and the miner have a vein of romanticism in
their natures not suspected by those who dew
them "from a car window' after the manner of
our own R. Harding Davis.
"I have strucK a cow camp by the road after
twilight, when the bacon was sending up its
gratetul ince.ise to heaven nnd the cook was
swearing becnuse the salaratus for the bis
cuits had piven out. .There were five men of the
outfit stretched out on the sand, reading by
the light of a stub c lantern, swung from the
tall of the grub wagon. Four of those ti\ c men
were reading stories by the Duebesp, and the
fifth was absorbed in a volume by Mrs. E. D.
N. South worth. He was n friend of mine,
'Happy Jack' Demson. of more or less feme in
Colorado. He told me once in confidence that
many years before he had read a book by Mrs.
Southworth, and ever after thar, if he wanted to read anything, he got something else by her
because he knew then he would be getting something he liked.' " '
"Many others in the arid West are of his mind, but the Duchess has the call. You know
swapping books is one of the polite amenities of the cattle trail. Every maa has two or three
paper-backs rolled in his slicker be.'iind his saddle, or stowed in his warbag at the bottom of
the grub wagon, nnd when a strnnÂ«er breaks into camp there is a general exchange of litera
ture. I have lia"hed my stock of iiierature ou a ranchhouse table after supper or in a cimp by
some remote water hole, and I always figured thut tne Duchess was ace high on a trade for
anything on the board. She will take precedence over Jules Verne and Bret Harte or any
jinmber and sort of out-of-date magazines. I confess a partiality for her myself, but I never
used to buy one of her books, bccuu.se I knew when I had traded'off all my own stoci 1 would
come back with as many of her books as I had room to pack with my plunder.
"I'm not trying to explain it. I'm only stating a fact, and an. storekeeper who vends
paper-back books in a frontier town will tell you the same thing. Tne Duchess appeals to the
Under rein of love and romance in the breast of the cow-pu:icher, aud he will, with proianlty,
lament her loss."

the election following the reappointment for
Representatives according to the latest census,
the additional members of the House from
that State are elected by the entire State in
stead of by districts. When the cumber of
Congressmen in a State is reduced, and the
Stntu also Jails to redistrict previous to elt-c
--tion, all the Representatives from that State
are elected on a general ticket, and are known
as Congressmen at large. Their duties are the
same as those of any other Representatives.
Delegates at large are those delegates who rep
resent a Slate or a county, and not a particular
district or section.

FOUNDATION-STONES FROM IRE
LAND ANDÂ£GYPi\
E. B. R ,mbo's Strange Account cf the
Purchase ani the Many Men Who
Are Behind the Enterprise-
Over a month aeo the announcement
was made from San Diego of the mys
terious purchase of 132 acres of land there
by two men, one unknown and the other
being C. A. Grconi of New York. Va
! rious reasons were assigned as probable
I for the purchase.
According to one report the land was to
be ussd as technical grounds for the Union
Pacific system, which was to be com
pleted there from Salt Lake. Another had
J it that since the land lay so near to Mex
ico it was to be used for a trans-Pacific
cable station. And still another reason
assigned for the purchase was that the
land was to be utilized for docks for a fa?-t
stearusiiip line to Japan. Another am
bitious correspondent tigured out that the
Iranchise was all owing to the determina
tion to complete at once the Nicaragua
canal.
Finally another dispatch reached San
Francisco saying the secret was out. The
land had been bought for a second Monte
Carlo.
All this was very interesting, but neces
sarily much of it must be very unreliable.
I The real reason, however, is now known.
| One of the mon who caused so much con
| jecture was E. B. Rambo of this City,
and he yesterday gave the story of the
purchase with the real reason therefor.
! Odd as it may seem it is as surprising and
| strange as any of the others that have
been assigned.
The land was bought for the establish
ment of a school for the revival of the
lost mysteries of antiquity. Tins sounds
strange, even impracticable, in this niat
ter-of-iact time, but Mr. Rambo says that
not only is that the object, Dut that the
progressive spirits whicn have cast their
lot together in the enterprise have incor
i porated in almost these irords.
A building is to 'oe erected at once. In
I fa t the cornerstone is to be laid between
i tne 15th and 20ih inst., as Mr. Rambo
i tays. Already the plan* are coninle ed,
and there is to be no delay. Foundation
stonei are to be used In the masonry
I gathered from different parts of the world.
| There is larce wealth repre ented in the
| purchase. Mr. Ranibo gave a list of the
| prominent gentlemen identified with it,
i and vita the strange school that is to be
, established. Not only are a number of
I these men very wealthy, but they are
widely known, and among them are some
of the ieauing thinkers of the country.
"The exact amount of land which we
have purchased," said Mr. Rambo, "is
132>i acres. It is on Point Loma, and
| borders the bay of San D.ego, and com
| niands a beautiful view of it. the ocean,
| Coronado and San Dieeo. In one place
i the ground mes 300 feet high, so that tne
prospect all around is commanding. Mr.
Grisconi and myself kept our mission
secret in San Diego, because if it had been
known what we were there for, we would
have had to pay probably $25,000 instead
of about $12,000 for tne land, and nine or
ten years ayo we would have had to pay a
dozen times what we paid for it.
"Toil land is ioi a system of schools
anc colleges. It has been supposed by
some that the Masons were going to begin
some extraordinary educational work
i there, and by others that the tlieosophists
were going to do so. Neither of these
suppositions is quite correct, though a
number of those in the enterprise are
either one or the other, but not all.
"Our object in buying the land is in
brief to establish a college for the revival
of the lost mysteries of antiquity. We
have thought that at this remote pointon
the American continent, where the en
vironment is so favorable, this would be
the bes; of all places for it. It is not to be
a school for youths, but for thinking
people all over tne world. We expect to
' have eminent men and women, too, as in
structors, but, perhaps, not immediately.
They will come when we get the school
! under way.
"\V'e Will at first erect a handsome
| wooden building 120 feet long, two and
three stories high, with Corinthian col-
I umns and broad piazzas. The building is
contracted for already. There are lo be
extensive libraries, a large hall, reading
| room* and other departments in the tirst
j story, including a kitchen and dining
room, which occupy one wing.
"Th<s entire building will be classical
in finish. It will have large verandas
facing the ocean and San Diego, with large
columns surrounding them. This build
in^, though spoken ol as temporary, will
1 stand and oe usod permanently. But the
j permanent building, as it is now alluded
I to, wul be in another styleof architecture.
"The coniftrÂ«toncs ot this will be laid
between the 16th and 20th of this month.
I This is to be v school oi higher education,
so called, and in it will be taught phi-
OHophy, science and religions. Tnis will
I be a very large building of stone. The
cornerstones have been collected from
different countries. There is a stone from
Ireland aireauy here, and stonen from
Scotland and Egypt are on the way.
"This building will be Kcvptian'in char
acter, like s-onie of the old temples. It
will be surrounded with smaller buildings.
It is the intention of ninny of our people,
who are men oi wealth and living in the
East and abroad, to conic here and spend
a part of each year there. They will build
| their own residences there and with their
I families enjoy the advantages ot study
I and association with those who are study
ing the mysteries of antiquity. Other
buildings will follow as we can erect them.
"Among the officers of oar society are
i men of wealth and distinction. Dr. J.
; D. Buck, the president, is of Cincinnati
i and the dean ol the Homeopathic Medi
{ cal College there; T. M. Pierce, the vice
| president, is an electrical engineer of New
York; E. A. Nercsbeimor, the treasurer,

purchase, i* manager of the International

j directors, is one of the foremost physicians

Mr. Rambo is secretary of the finance
committee of the incorporation. Though
a dealer in euns and ammunition, he
thinks men can do better things than kill
each other or themselves, and believes
that the study of the antiquities will re
sult in ;he betterment of those who
study, and indirectly the cood of all man

the study of the antiquities, as is intend
ed, says that there is no bar to any per

DAY OF HOLD-UPS
IN THE CITY HALL
The Auditor and Supervis
orial Committees Ob
durate.
Havens' Fees and Superintend
ent Condon's Salary a-Giim
mering.
Meantime the Grand Jury Puts Fire
Under the Already Bubbling Mu
nicipal Kettle.
There are great times at the City Hall.
Bills are being held up on all sides. The
architect of the Mission High School will
not be able to collect his fees without a
suit at law. The superintendent pf con
struction of the new municipal building
yesterday had his bill for services for the
last month thrown out. Smaller bills are
disputed and rejected. Meanwhile there
are mandamus proceedings under way,
others are threatened and the atmosphere
of the City Hall corridors is filled with
mutterings, objurgations and heat
lightning.
Yesterday, in fact, was a sort of field
day for holding up bills and bringing to a
focus pending matters. City and County
Auditor Broderick toiled on the lower
floor oi the hall; the Finance Committee
and the Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors worked on the
floor above. 'Meanwhile, to add to the
excitement, the Grand jury was seeking
information from the Hoard of Education,
asking for the original plans and specifi
cations of the Mission High School and
also all t he contracts appertaining thereto.
The Grand Jury's attention has been
called to the Mission Hitrh >cnoo# matter
through the opinion of Auditor Broderick,
publicly expressed, and to the recital ot
itie facts as publicly made by him. An
investigation concerning the reasons for
the excess of contracts over the estimated
cost as made up originally by Architect
Havens is probably the next move in
that direction.
So Jar as Architect Havens' fees are
concerned, the issue was plainly made up
yesterday. Auditor Broderick had complet
ed his study of decisions and authorities
and had finally determined to rest upon
the opinion furnished to him by City and
County Attorney Creawcll. This he made
clear to Mr. Havens, who called at the
Auditor's office to ascertain what was to
be done. Mr. iiroderick said that he had
determined to return the architect's bill
to the Board of Education. With this
also went the premiums for the plan and,
practically, all that is left undisputed is
the purchase of the site, as the situation
is interpreted at the educational depart
ment.
The situation concerning Architect
Havens' fees has been so fully explained
In these columns that it may not be neces
sary to say more on that point. The
cost Architect Havens estimated for the
building was $137,000. The contracts
amount to $140,000 in round figures. The
architect's fees at 5 per cent amount to
$6000. The bill, which must be collected
through the courts if at all, is for '2% per
cent, one half of the total.
The Auditor had hardly notified Mr.
Havens of his final determination when
papers were served upon him in the man
damus proceedings brought by Joseph H.
Mogan to collect salary as Fish and Game
Warden lor the City and County of San
Francisco for the month of January.
These proceedings later in the day resulted
in the instruction by the Judiciary Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors to the
City and County Attorney to represent
the Auditor in the matter.
The Finance Committee of the Super
visors had the next innings in the game
of financial battledore and shuttlecock
going on in the City Hall. Daniel E.
Condon, superintend ent of the work upon
the new municipal building, sent in his
bill for Â£JSO lor the month of January.
The Finance Committee, upon motion of
Supervisor Kottanzi, refused to recom
mend that the bill should be paid, the
ground of the refusal Deing that no work
is being performed and, therefore, there
was nothine for Condon to superintend.
For the preceding month the salary of
the superintendent was forthcoming.
Then some grading was done upon the
site. The cornerstone was laid and some
other work was performed in preparation
for the actual construction of the build
ing. The refusal of the Finance Com
mittee will undoubtedly influence the ac
tion of Auditor Broderick when the bill
shall :ome to him for services in January
and more proceedings in court may possi
bly result.
Bills from J. Millard, extra Chinese in
terpreter, and fc. ii. Simon, extra Qerman
interpreter, were also held up, and also a
bill from Mr. Nolan for two revolving
c airs, which were billed at the rate of
$27 each, and were for the Southern police
station. Supervisor Rottanzi questioned
whether chairs at that price were not a
little too luxurious for tne police use.
THE COOPER WILLS.
Last Testaments of Mother and Daugh
ter Have Been Offered for
Probate.
Probate will be asked for the wills of
both Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and her daugh
ter, Mis- Harriet Cooper, who were found
dead in bed at their residence in this City
on the 11th of last December.
Mrs. Harriet E. Skilton appears on be
half of the will of Mri. Cooper. She
represents tha: the estate of the decedent
consisted of real estate and personal prop
erty valued at about $10,000. It is
assumed in the petition that Harriet
Cooper survived her mother, as Harriet is
named as Mrs. Cooper's sole heir at law.
The proponents of Miss Cooper's will
also assume the same state of facts to be
true.
Mrs. Irene M. Rawlings presents Har
riet Cooper's will and describes the estate
as worth more than $5000, though the
value is as yet unknown owing to the fact
that no one can as yet say what interest
Miss Cooper had in hor mother's estate.
If Mrs. Cooper's will is declared in
valid, as has been 6ucgested, then Miss
Cooper inherited directly all of her
mother's estate, and the property of both
will be distributed in accordance with the
provisions of the daughter's will, which
is admitted by all to be valid in every par
ticular.
Several decisions have been given by
I the courts of this State that a holographic
will is fatally defective if it is not entirely
in the handwriting of the testator. Mrs.
Cooper's will was written on a printed
letter-head of the Golden Gate Kinder
garten Association, and in making the
date the lady used the printed figures
â¢â¢189â," and filled in the blank by adding
j the figure 'C with her pen. A claim will
I be made by Attorneys Gunnison, Booth
I & Bartnett that Mrs. Cooper republished
the date at the conclusion of her will by
the allegations that she signed said docu
ment "on the date above written," and
that by this act the technical argument
against validity is overcome.
It appears probable there will be no
contest or opposition to the pro Date of
Mrs. Cooper's will on the part of any of
â  the heirs. In that event it remains to be
; seen whether the court will of its own
I motion take cognizance of the alleged
defect in the execution of the instrument.
In any event, however, the heirs have it
in their cower to have Mrs. Cooper's
wishes carried out, as the heirs of Mrs.
Cooper are also the heirs of Miss Cooper,
j aud both estates are amply able to meet
the requirements of the legacies provided
for.
Both cases will be called for hearing in
Judge Coffey's court on the li)th inst.
MRS. MURDOCH'S ALIMONY.
Her lii-lluubmul Munt Pay No Matter
What Mi- DoÂ«Â«.
Judge Slack has rendered an important
decision in the divorce case of Nannie
Murdoch against \YUliam C. Murdoch.
Two years ago Mrs. Murdoch was
granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty
and she was allowed $125 a month alimony
and the custody of the minor child. Last
month the ex-husband applied to be re
lieved of the burden of paying alimony on
the ground that His former wife's life is
not blameless.
Mrs. Murdoch's attorney objected to the
stoppage of the alimony, .-aying that
whether she was guilty or not her husband
\vaÂ« bound to support her, and that the
decree could not be iegaliy amended in
this regard. To support this position the
decision of the Supreme Court oi New
York in the noted case of Forrest against
Forrest was cited, where the great actor's
wife was granted a divorce. Subsequently
Forrest offered to prove thut his former
wife was not living proDerly, and the
court held that even if this were true it
would not be sufficient ground for reliev
ing Forrest from the payment of alimony.
Judge Slack adopted this view of the
law in deciding the Murdoch case.
Injured at a Fire.
The Board of Fire Commissioners has recom
mended to tne Board of Supervisors to

Wright, truckman of truck 5. Wright was in

LOCATED WITH
THE X RAY
A Button in a Two- Year-
Old Baby's Windpipe
Photographed.
An Operation Was Performed,
but the Substance Could Not
Be Found.
II H*d Worked Its Way Through the
Trachea and Lodged Against
the jEophagus.
The X ray and the surgeon's knife
have again been put 10 use in an attempt
to save a human life where death seemed
inevitable. Although the ui-e of the in
struments of science was rewarded with
only partial success they served to allay
to a certain extent the fears of the pa
tient's anxious parents.
Two weeks ago the two-year-old child of
Charles Amacker of Sacramento while
playing with an older brother accident
ally drew a large tin button which he was
holding in his mouth down into his wind
pipe. The button stopped at the bifurca
tion of the trachea, or where it divides
into the bronchial tubes.
The child was seized with a fit of cough
ing, but the button refused to be dis
lodged, and in a few hours the child was
suffering Irom severe inflammation of the
bronchial tubes, raaKing respiration ex
ceedingly difficult and painful.
Several physicians were called and the
child was taken by the heels and shaken,
head downward. Vomiting and sneezing
were produced, but all efforts to dislodge
the button proved without avail, and the
child was removed to this City for treat
ment. The oaby was taken to the College
of Physicians and Surgeons, 818 Howard
street, and it was decided to make a
shadowgraph by means of the X ray, and
in case the button was located to operate.
Dr. Depuy, assisted by one of the college
students, undertook the experiment of
making the shadowgraph. The child was
laid upon his back on a large sensitized
plate, and after a towel had been placed
over the breast to protect the skin from
the rays the current was turned on. At
the end of six minutes the child was re
moved and the plate developed. The first
part of the operation was a success, as the
button showed plainly, apparently located
a little way down the right bronchial
tube. This fact justified an operation and
Dr. J. R. Lame, assisted by Dr.-Â«. Southard,
Healy and Gardener, undertook to remove
the button.
The operation known as tracheotomy
was performed. As low as possible the
windpipe was opened and the surgeons
began their explorations for the Button.
They used long forceps, but although fre
quent attempts were made to locate the
foreign substance, the}' were unsuccessful.
A slight brea'-c in the trachea proved the
reasons of 'he failure. The button had
ulcerated its way through the windpipe,
and presumably lodged against the
a'3ophagus. If it remains in its present
position, the physicians are confident that
it will become encysted, and if the child
recovers from the shock of the operation,
will cause no further trouble.
THEIR BIG DINNER.
The Iroquola Club Preparing for the
Annual Gathering of Braves at
the Banquet.
The Iroquois braves are getting ready

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
Pugilists in Trainingâ What the Athletes, Wheel
men and Sportsmen Are Doing.
The event of greatest importance to
sport-lovers is the coming championship
heavy-weight battle between Corbett and
Fitzsimmons in Nevada. As Corbett will
be here in a few days tho3e who wager
money on contests pugilistic will have an
opportunity to draw a line on the cham
pion's present condition.
The wheelmen look forward with much
interest to a tournament which will be
held in the Pavilion in the near future.
Several of the fastest riders in the coun
try will taKe part.
According to the present outlook there
will be a hotly contested tug-of-war in the
Pavilion in the latter part of this month
between teams representing all nations.
Sportsmen are making the best of the
few days that remain of the season for
duck and quail shootinc. Coursing en
thusiasts will witness some good racing
to-morrow at Ingleside.
THE WHEELMEN.
A Proposed State Racing Circuit
for the Crack Riders Here.
Another stormy week has prevented the
laying out of any trips for to-morrow in
the country, though if it is clear there
will doubtless be a small army of cyders
headed for the park, and as the mads
there dry quickly (and the cycle paths in
particular) riding should be fairly good.
The panhandle will be in poor shape, how
ever, and riders slioul.i lake tha street on
the north side of it. Fell street, which is
bituminized from Baker to Stanyan and
affords an excellent riding surface.
Not much interest seems to attach to
the Velodrome meet scheduled for next
Saturday, and little is heard about it.
Manager Shafer has announced that none
of his men will r;de, and, as his team is
comprise 1 of all the best professionals now
on the coast, he would seem to have the
reins In his hand?. He does not want
them to do any track work now, but to
devote all their time to training.
It is aiso fcaiil that the pronosed indoor
tournament scheduled for March lo to 27
has fallen through, which was not unex
pected by those who knew, as it received
little or no encouragement from the riders
and dealers,
Shafer's team is now composed of
Loughead, Zegler, Wells, the Terrills,
Stevens, McFarland. Jones, Down me,
Bovee, Morris, Becker, Davis, Whitman
and Slater, and he may pick up a couple
of more good ones, like Boyden or Dow.
With this aggregation he proposes to
start a coast circuit, to commence at Peta
luma on February 22 and go to Santa
Rosa, Healdsburg, Dixon, Woodland,
Chico, Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose
and to San Francisco, if there is an indoor
meet here about the middle of Marcu
under satisfactory management. Such a
team as this would not fail to be a star
attraction wherever it goes, particularly
in competition with all the local talent to
be met at the various places.
C. N. Ravlin is arranging the circuit
date?, and tho meets will be handled by
the clubs in the various towns. Tne pro
gramme will inciude four professional
events a day. Multicycle pacing ma
chines will be taKen along and used to
niHke the races fast. Fsying starts in
scratch competition events will be tried,
similar to horse-racing, and under such
conditions, on good tracks, fast time will
be tno rue.
The Zieglcr-McFar'and match will be
the star event of the opening day at Peta
luma, and tne much-mooted quesuon (in
ihe minds of some) as to which is the bet
ter rider will then be settled, a.thougii my
personal conviction is too strong in favor
of Ziegler lor me to change that opinion.
Meanwhile the men are in active train
ing at San Jose, ready for any good meet
that comes along after they are thor
oughly conditioned. Shafer is* in the City,
Btoppmg at the Bay City Wheelmen's
clubhouse, making arrangements for the
circuit and the coming season.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
will meet to-night at the rooms of the
Acme Club, Oakland. Several amend
ments to the by-laws will come up for con
sideration and the approaching twenty
live-mile road race of the 22d inst- will be
discussed.
It can be said on good authority that
many of the makers are thinking serious:y
about putting racing teams on ttie circuit
for the coming season. With State and
interstate circuits the expenses will be
reduced to a minimum. Ten teams are
now known to be forming for another
eea^on.
W. A. Terrill, the popular Bay City man,
has been allowed the mite professional
competition record of 2:08 1-5, made at the
Velodrome November 21. W. Foster has
been allowed the five-mile paced competi
tion record of 11:13 4-5. made on the same
track, when he defeated Wells. The three
and lour mile records of 7:01 and 9:09 4-5,
respectively, al9o go to him. Tom Cooper
get* the two-mile competition professional
record, 4:13, made at Memphis November
3. This race was single-paced.
Los Angeles has more riders under sus
pension than any district in the country
for participating in Sunday racing against
the L. A. W. rules.
All tna old-timers here will remember
Will M. Meeker, who was prominent in
the Bay City Wheelmen ten or a dozen
years ago. He was a hardy road rider,
and sixty to a hundred miles a day on an
old "ordinary" was nothing for Meeker,
KnaijD, Sheldon and that crowd. He is
now in Passaic, N. J., and I received a
letter lrom him recently which is interest
ing. After referring to some personal
matters, he says:
I see you still keep up your editorship of the
wheel column of The Call, for the folks send
me the paper regularly and I am theieby able
to keep in touch with wheeling matters on the
coast. I did a little riding ::iyi.elf last year
covering some i!0OO miles between May 18 9G'
and January 1, 1897. all of which gois to sh.>w
that your unc.e is still in the ring. We have
some splendid roads radiating from this sec
tion, and one can ride all day long with
hardly an exception on good macadamized
roads. I won't say straightaway, for toe Slate
is hardly extensive enough. The only trouble
is they are not all level or downhill both ways
and so for the honor of California I em forced
to climb up and down everything that comes
aloni;. I twisted a crank axle clean off a
couple ot months ago going up a little hill
I hud rauier an enjoyable ride about tne Ist
of January, and one which would make you
exotics wonder at, for while the roads were
good, we passed innumerable banks of snow
alongside the pikes, and passed many ponds
large and small, covered with skaters, and ah
tui?, mind you, on a bright, sunny day, almost
equal to one of California's mucn-advertis"d
winter days. I confess, though, that tbo ther
mometer aid not range far from 30 or 32, but
as there was no wind, the coolness was re
freshing. Since the Ist the climate has been
bad, and when it isn't blowing a gale the
ground is covered with snow, and snow is not
the liuest kind of riding, all tnose maniacs in
the L. A. W. bulletin to the contrary notwith
standing. Wheeling on snow may possibly be
all right for the North or West, bin heru so
near the coast it is spoiled by the saltness in
the atr, and that means continual thaws or
freezes.
The Bay City Wheelmen have a curious
entertainment scheduled for next Satur
day night, the 13tb. It will be a sort of a
smoker and each member present will be
allotted three minutes, no more no less,
in which to entertain the others in s me
way such hs he pleases. This should
prove very funny and will produce some
ludicrous effects. The proposed Laundry
F.irm run is still in abeyance.
The North California division of the
league gained twenty-eight new members
during the last week. The total member
ship is now lGfil and that of the parent
body 71,922. As soon as the riding reason
opens these numbers will be greatly
swelled. Chief Consul Kerrigan and R.
M. Welch of the racing board are now on
' their way East to attend the annual meet-
I ing of the league. From tbe latest ad
| vices from the iSast it seems tbe proposed
j Sunday meinir amendment will pas? with
{ out trouble and also t lie one admitting
i professionals to membership.
The Imperial Club's whist tournament
is now in progress* an'l is exciting a good
iifal of interest among the members. The
club bas a number of rond events planned
lor later in thii month and a ciub run to
the Velodrome to-morrow, where some
club races will be indulged in to settle
some personal questions of individual
supremacy.
The :ollowing is from Cycling West, the
largest cycling paper published west of
Chicago, and which has jt big circulation
in the Pacific Coast States:
Kroni a statement dropped by a member of
the K'gnl department ot ihe Southern I'aL-iflc
Railroad the wheelmen of Oiliiornia ami Hun
Francisco need not be uneasy concerning the
bicycle baggage bill introduced in the Culi
loruia Legislature. The bill i* patterned aiier
the "Armstrong" baggage bill, which has
been presented to tbe I/egis-latures of New
York aii'l Ohio, and is now a law in those
States. The railroad company has entirely
Changed .ront in regard to the matter since it
rescinded an order cullect a charge on bi
v-'vclcs last fall, Mibsequent to a very ow
spoken opposition to the order np expressed
by wheelmen in Thk Call. A meial>tr of tho
let-al dc] artmentoi the company said recently
thai it had V.een decided not to tight the bill
in tlie Legislature. The company may po even
further at:d provide special accommodations
in baggage-cars for bicycles.
Tne Olympic Club Wheelmen will have
a good time to-:iight. A neatly worded
and printed invitation requests the mem
bers to assemble at a popuar downtown
roiifserie at 8 o'clock to attend a banquet
tendered the clud's racing men. Tnerp
will doubtless be a large gathering of the
wearers ol the flyintr 0. Douglas White
and Thomns G. Spillane have the affair in
Charge.
John G. Rieger, a well-known wheelman
of L,os Angeles, is in the City for a lew
days renewing old acquaintances.
Tom Eck, the manager of John S. John
fin, and more recently of Michael, the
Weish wonder, will be in Caliiornia about
tne end of thi-; month and may bring
Johnson with him. In an interview with
H. A. Goddard of the Bay City Wheelmen,
in Chicago, Eck said thai his ideas of rac
ing without pacernaking had turned out
very satisfactorily. It was he who origin
ated the idea of every man in a lace hav
ing to make his sharo of pace before the
throe-quarter poie was reached, and the
result was that at Memphis in vfie day's
racing there were twenty-one heats ridden
in 2:21 or better and halves in 1:04, so it
seems his ideas are all right. Spaldixg.
THE GUN.
Sportsmen Who r'avor a Lonarer
season for Shootlne Wild Ducks.
Sportsmen have just one more week for
the enjoyment of a favorite pastime, and
judging from the weather outlook the de-
Out to Kill.
votees of quail shootingmayjustasw.il
clean their guns and put the irons away
for the season.
The lovers of duck shooting have en
joyed the best Â»port of the year during the
past month, aud good shooting may be
expected up to the last day of the season,
which will be a week from Monday.
As previously stated in this department
the season should close on Aiarch 15, in
stead of February 15, as the law stands at
present. The birds which afford the
greater amount of sport to local hunters
who shoot on the Alviso aud Sonoma
marshes are spoonbill, blnebill, sprig and
canvasback, and as these varieties are late
arrivals from the north, especially the
spoonbill and biuebill ducks, the consen
sus of opinion is that the season in which
sportsmen may lawfully hunt and shoot
wild ducks should not close until March
15. The farmers throughout the Btate are
strongly in favor of prolonging the duck
shooliug season, as tbe widzeon and other
varieties of broad-bill duck are very de
structive to young grain.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
will lend its assistance to have an amend
ment to the present law lengthening the
season for the killing of wild ducks one
month. The snipe will also come in for
its share of protection during the breeding
season.
Last Sunday several good bags of ducks
were made by hunters who shot on the
Alviso and Sonoma marshes, and the
outlook for good sport to-morrow is very
promising, particularly if the weather is
boisterous.
Thousands of people enjoy camp life in
this State during the summer months,
aod it may be of valuable interest to the
read' rs of The Call to learn what Dr. J.
W. howler, a prominent sportsman of
New York, says in Sports Afield, relative
to cures for in juries frequently received by
campers who may be a Jong distance lrom
medical assistance. The doctor writes:
The satisfaction of being able to relieve un
necessary pain, prevent permanent injury
aud possibly being the means of saving a
valuable life, stimulates me to write a short
ar:icle on simple camp remedies for injuries
and accidents to my friend*, ihe hunters and
campers. It is always best to nave a hand
kerchief in one of our pockets, if tor nothing
more than its common usaga. But a hand-
Kerchief will take the place of a bandage lor a
short time and can be of usi in many emer
gencies. Besides a handkerchief and a good
hunting-knife in the pocket a hunter's outfit
in campjshi.uid contain, for emergency cases,
the following in their order named:
A little good whisky, for medicinal purposes
An 18-f>ot ban lace, 4 or 5 Inches wide,

A few needles of different sizes and heavy silk
thread.
A common needle will do, but needles used by
tÂ»i!or.i or shoemakers are the best If one cannot
bÂ«cun> medium size surgeon needles.
MaUria sometimes will creep about our tent
but quinine will drive thnt away. One or two
capsii.es taken in the morning with a hot cup
of coffee is a preventive when one is camping
around a lake or river. Laudanum may l.c
taken in ten-drop doses and repeated a few
times for cramps. Mixed with water or oil in
the proportion of oue to five it is a good lini
ment.
A cutâ Wash in water (not necessarily warm
water), to get the pans clean, or it will not
heal nicely. Then keep tue edges of the cut
together with sticking-plaster or small band

THE BOXERS.
Jim Corbatt Will Arrive on Tuesday
and* Will Play Ball on
Wednesday.
Jim Corbett has written a friend that he
will arrive in this City on Tuesday ana
lhat on Wednesday he expects to meet
Billy Kennedy, the champion handball
player of the Olympic Club, and Jim
Nealon, the Adonis of the San Francisco
handball court, to arrange for a series of
games.
Corbett is evidently of the opinion that
he can easily dispose of the two crack
players, but he must have made wonder
ful improvement' since he left St. Ijouis,
otherwise be would not attempt to tackle
such a hard same.
When Corbett visited St. Louis one of
the first places he put foot in was tne local
handball court. The pugilistic champion
was warmly received by the handball
fraternity and a match game was quickly
arranged.
The following account of the game ap
peared in a St. Louis paper:

E. J. BROWN.
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. 4.â Track Captain Everett J. Browu was to-day declared
the unanimous nominee of the University of California Athletic Association for the
position of football manager, to succeed G. F. Reinhardt '97. His nomination means
practical election, since there is no other man in the .field for the place. The for
mality of casting the ballot will be carried out next Tuesday, as that is the day which
had previously been set for the election. Brown's unanimous nomination for the
position is unprecedented in the history of the university. At no time hitherto has

between the candidates and the two opposing factions. It being regarded as one of
the highest and most responsible positions In the gift of the student body the con
sequent interest has been almost immeasurable.
P. R. Thnyer '93 placed Brown in nomination, and when the echo of applause
had cued away and the chairman called for further nominations not a sound
was heard, though two other men bad previously announced their candidacy.
Brown s mime had swept over the meeting like a whirlwind, carrying everything
in sight with it. Since his freshman year the coming football manager has been
prominent iv all college movements, especially athletics. He is especially well known
as the mile-runner ot the university. In the intercollegiate meet of 1395 Brown took
nrst place, making the mile in 4:38 3-5. thus winning the championship. Last year
he did not enter mat event. A year ago he was elected track captain to Succeed Fred
Magee, and later he was chosen president of his class. Upon his shoulders rested the
burden of last Junior day's celebration, which proved to be so eminently successful.

Neville and Jake Holtman and were
beaten by a ecore of 10 to 21. The game
took place at the old West End court on
Vandeventer avenue and was enjoyed by
a laige crowd of enthusiasts. Coroott and
U.ley both played in good form, but
Neville and Iloitman hung with them
troru the start and in a close linish
won out.
"Corbett, by the way, is one of the most
enthusiastic handball players that ever
â¢-truck the city. He likÂ»*s the garue, and
has played it ali over the world, meeting
some of the best players in Ireland during
his last trip across the big poud. Of all
the cracks lie has met Jim thinus Lawler
of Chicago is the best. He has beaten Al
derman Dunne of Brooklyn, Champion
Ca-ey's partner, and also played numer
ous games with the champion". Casey is
recognized as the American champ on,
but Corbett think;- Lawler is 1 he best man
he ever played with in this country."
Corbett wili remain in this C.ty a few
days before taking his departure for the
Sagebrush State. He will be received in
royai style by the Olympic Club, of which
he is a prominent member.
Although many offers havn been made
by sports who fancy placing a little money
on the result of tne proposed big mill,
there has been no wager wortuy of men
tion laid on either man yet, but it is
I thought that after Corbett's arrival the
sports will open their fists and drop some
of their "hard-earned coin" into the pool
box. The Fiizsiinnions men ore looking
for long odds, something likp 2 to 1, but
it is safe to say that the oads will not vary
very much from the. present quotation,
which is 10 to 7}4, wiih Corbett on the
long end.
Among several people who were asked
to express an opinion as to the result of
the fiehr, with few exceptions Corbett was
the choice of those who will wager on the
outcome.
Jimmy Carroll, the light-weight pucri
list, who frequently said that Fitz3im
mons can wnii> any man on earth, has
j changed nis mind now that a battle be-
I tween Jim and Bob looks promising. A
{ few evenings ago Carroll said that he fan
cied Corbett, as Fitzsimmons did not per
form as well as he expected in his fi^ht
with Sharkey.
"If Corbett is in good condition when
ho enters ihe ring," said Carroll, "I look
to see him whip Fitz, because he is just as
clever us Bob. and in every other respect
he has t c advantage.'*
But Carroll's friends that Jimmy will
have a few dollars on Fitz. nevertneless.
Jimmy Markland, who is one of the
local cracks on matters pugilistic, does
not hesitate to say that Fitzsimmons will
whip Corbett in short order.
"If you will notice how Fitz has fooled
T. L. BARNES.
the public since his arrival in this conn
try," said Markland, "you will agree with
roe that he will auo fool them when he
meets Corbett.
"In nearly all the battles that Fitz
engaged in he was said to be whipped by
his opponent, but through some fluke he
happened to land on hia man just about
the time the friends of his opponent
thought the Cornishman was on Queer
street. He will play the same game with
Corbett just as sure ns Nevadu i% tne
premier prize-fighting State of the Union.' '
Torn Murray and Billy Jordan fancy
Fitz^irninons. In fact, Murray is of the
opinion that Corbett will not enter the
ring with Bob. Frank Foster. Georee
Green, Billy Kennedy and Professor Wat
sor. of the Olympic Club Â«re as certain
that Corbett will whip Fitzsimmons as
that the sun seta in the west.
John Morrissy of the Orpbeum will be
greatly disappointed if Corbett is whipped.
Danny Wlieian says that there is only one
man in the race and his name is Corbett.
A' Greg<?ains is also a Corbett man. Jack
Garrison contends that Corbett is a fancy
boxer and that Fitz is a natural fighter,
who puts hi-* opponents to sleep. He will
have his money on Bob. Tommy McDon
aid lites Corbett, but does not hesitate to
say that Fitz will whip him unless Jim is
in prime condition. Nat Hanley cannot
understand how Corbett can lose, as he
has many advantages whicn Fitz does not
possess. Howard Taylor is a Corbett man
first, last and all the time. Jack Limmer
allows that Corbett is the cleverest man,
but he cannot avoid getting some punches
from Fitz that will take all the fieht out
of him. Jack Mallon can't see how Cor
bett can lose the game if he is in good fix.
Karvey Harmon says that no man can
prognosticate the result, as the men are
clever in their way, and the result wiil de
per.d upon "who will get there first."
Charles Bergen says that he must see
Corbett first beiore he can venture an
opinion. Tom Flvnn says that the result
ol the fight will depend on Corbett's con
dition, and that if he is right he will win.
T. M. Ferguson is an admirer of Fi'z
simnions. John Conway likes Cor
bet t's chances. Phil Ryan of hand
ball fame says that Corbett will make
a monkey out of Fitz. Jim Orndorff says
that Corbett must be in good trim and
light very carefully, as his opponent is
full of tricks and hard punches. Cor
nelius Lyons is a strong Corbett man, but
like others Lyons says that he muse nave
a squint at Coroett before he ventures an
opinion. Donald McÃae predicts a victory
for Fitzsimmons. Patsy Hogaa says that
the fight will koep people guessing, but
Corbett having many advantages over
Fitz he should win in a long race. Eddie
Kolo is a Corbett man, and so is Professor
Barney Farley. Tom Casey, the water
front authority on game birds, says
that Fitzsimmons will win if Cor
bett can't hit him. Eddie Ladd fancies
Fitzsimmons' chances. Mike Lynch is an
out-and-out Corbett man. He contends
that Fitzsimruons will be boxing holes in
the air in his attempts to land on Corbett's
head. Jim Dunn is a great admirer of
Corbett and so is John Farley, but the
latter says that ( orbett must be in fine
form, as Fitzsimmons is a dangerous man.
Doubtless many of the opinions now
formed by sporting men as to the result of
the mill will change, when the proenosti
r.jtors will have a chance to "'size up"

Jeffries, the Los Angeles champion
heavy-weight, arrived yesterday and will

The Health and Police Committee of

No limit was placed on the number of

The Manhattan Athletic Club is making
extensive arrangements for its erand box
ine carnival, which is to come off at
Woodward's Gardens on next Friday
night. The very best amateurs from the
different clubs of the coast will partici
pate and some rare sport is certain to be
given. Bouts have been arranged, as here
tofore published, for all classes, from fea
ther to heavy weights.
As the receipts of the entertainment are
to be expended in the purchase of appara
tus and other necessities, it is to be hoped
that the attendance will be large.
ROD AND CREEL.
Anglers Expact Certain Amend-
merits to Fish Laws to Be Lost.
The rainstorm has come in very oppor
tune for the anglers, as breeding fishes
will now have an opportunity of reaching
the bead waters of coast streams, where
they will reproduce their species.
Last year the heavy rains arrived late,
and as a result the trout of good size,
which always make a respectable appear
ance in an angler's basket, were swept
down to salt water, leaving only the finger
lines of the tributaries of the main streams
to be caught by the anglers who can law
fully angle in April.
The present storm came with the new
moon, and in ail probability there will be
heavy rains during this month. Should
tine weather result in March it can be
safely said that the fishing in April will
be good; that is, of course, provided the
proposed amendment to the present law,
which adds another month to the tail of
the close season, will be defeated in the
Senate. Should the anglers be compelled
by law to refrain from putting in an ap
pearance on favorite streams until May
the poacbers who., fear neither law nor
man will have an excellent opportunity of
laughing at the citizens who must reluct
antly Jreep their lines dry until the month
of May. by which time tne streams will be
fished out.
Representatives of the Sportsmen's Pro
tective Associaiion and anglers who are
opposed to the openingof the trout-fishing
season in May, have signed a petition
which will be forwarded to-day to the Sen
ate Committee on Fish and Game. Several
letters have been addressed by anglers to
Senators, asking them to use their influ
ence to defeat the amendment to the As
sembly bill, which lengthens the close sea-
HOn tor trout-fishing one month beyond
the limit according to the law at pre-ent.
Anglers of the City or country who have
any interest in the sport of trout-catching
should not defer writing to auy friends
they may Lave who are iepresented in the
Senate, with the object in view of defeat
ine the scheme of ctosingthe trout-fishing
season until M&y 1.
Charley Precht lost a valuable fishing
basket last Sunrtay on his return from
Point Keyes. Within the basket were
some valuable reeis which the owner
highly prized. Any person who has ihe
creel in his possession wili be handsomely
rewarded by leaving it at 626 Clay street.
Cracknell, alias Longfellow, recently
remarked to a friend that there were only
three men on this coast who understood
how to handle a came fish. He men
tioned himself as being one of the num
ber, bat judging from Â«m exhibition he
gave recently on the Russian River of
playing a ten-pound steeihead, he can
very well afford to take a few lessons from
Butler or Bransdosff, neither of whom
would be guilty of such an unpardonable
breach of I ie art of handling a fish as to
hoid the rod witn the reel underneath,
thereby placing the whole ttrain on the
loops, when it should be on the rod.
Cracknell relies on the strength of his
tackle in playing a fish; yet he has been
known to sma^h a double leader when
trying to stop the first run of a steeihead.
Poor old Crack, he has yet much to
learn of the art of angling, even tnoueh it
be bait-fishing. Of fly-casting he knows
naught
John Bonn, the well-known fly-tier and
fisherman, has left his Norta Beach place
of business and bus opened a new labora
tory on Montgomery street. In his busi
ness he is ably assisted by his daughter,
who ties about as neat a fly as can be im
agined.

THE OARSMEN.
Great Activity Among the South
Endsâ University Regatta.
Rowing is booming at the foot of Third
streei. With two regattas in view, one on
the 27th of February and the Golden Gate
Carnival race in April, the members of
the South End Rowing Club are kept Dusy
in their endeavor to make the season of
1897 a successful one for aquatic sports.
During this season the South Ends will
hold monthly races both for barges and
skiffs and in this way select material to
represent the club in the regattas. The
first of these races will take place on the
third or fourth Sunday in February. At
the present time about tweuty-ti ye mem
bers nave signified their intention of
participating.
If possible the midgets will be induced
to enter and strive to regain their lost
laurels by defeating the new senior crew.
This would be a race well worth seeing,
and the club members should do all in
their power to bring the two crews to
gether.
The intermediate clas* will be repre
sented by two crews. Tom Barry will
captain NÂ©. 1, and the crew which entered
in the Thanksgiving regatta and lost its
heart and reputation at the stakeboat will
be looked after by Walter Dnpliasea.
In tne junior ciass at the present time
the club has material for three or perhaps
four crews.
6u last Tuesday evening fifteen applica
tions were received by Secretary Ma
honey. This now makes a total of
twenty-two applications received within
the last month, since the reduction of the
initiation fee 10 $2 50. The membership

TUG-OF-WAR.
Strong Men Who Are In Training

Much satisfaction is evinced at the lib

will receive a prize in conformity with its
standing in the tournament.
The American team of Los Angele3 has
applied for entrance as representing the
United States, but it was reluctantly re
fused, as thelocal American team is fully
organized and embraces splendid ma'
terial. Five other nationalities have
nought the privilege of entering teams,
but were refused, as it would require too
long a time to decide the contest if any
more than ten teams participated.
T c individual pulls wi.l be a new and
exciting feature of this tournament, as
the management offers separate cash
prizes therefor, besides the "ten highest

this country and Europe.

City Bluercck Club will hold its first shoot of
the season on the 122 dof February. The gun
stores report business as beinn absolutely dead
for the time being. The Helvetia Rifle Club
will hold a shoot next Sunday. A young man
who has been recuperating on a ranch in the
vicinity of Newport, on the Sacramento River,
reports that the Portujuese in that vicinity
are making night hideous by shooting at
docks, anil he claims that they stay in th.c
tules all night and Dang away at every sound
of wings that pass over. It is the belief of
many that a law should be formulated against
nifrht shooting. Last week a Portuguese liv
ing in that vicinity took about fifty ducks to
the steamboat landintr and endeavored to
ship them to the San Francisco markets, but
as the officer of the boat refused to accept
them he was obliged to give them away.
Mr. Williamson, an enthusiastic sportsman
of Penryn, \v>-s in this City this weeK, and
states that quail shooting in his locality is a
thing of the past. In former years this was
one of the best quait grounds of the State and
was a fÃvorite resort for sportsmen from this
City, but,jiow that the chaparral thickets
have been cleared away and their places filled

Judge McKenna Closing Up
His Circuit Court
Business.
Will Not Render a Decision in
the Famous Oakland Water
Front Case.
He May Not Be Abe to Reach Wash
ington in Time for the lisa.*
ural Or\ a monies
Now that it has been definitely settled
that be is to occupy a seat in President
elect McKinlcy's Cabinet, United States
Circuit Judge McKenna is losing no time
in his preparations to wind up the busi
ness before him.
There are a number of important cases
awaiting deei-ion, and Judge McKenna
intends to leave a clear tield for ins suc
cessor as far as possible. The ruoH iin
pertant case yet undecided is the Oakland
water-front suit, but tJie man who is ap
pointed to tha Circuit bench to succeed
Judge McKenna will have to handle that.
"I shall not render an opinion in the
Oakland water-front matter for several
icasons," said Judge MoKenna yesterday.
'The main one is that certain phaÂ»es of
ihe case are now beforo the State Supreme
Court, and as some of the points laid be*
fore rue by counsel may be thought by
gome to touch on State laws I shall let
luu matter rest. The decision will not be
Tendered until the Supreme Court has
iiamle*i down its opinion.
"The other matters before me will be
handled as rapidly as possible, and I hope
to have thorn all straightened out by the
lend of thirty days, so that I may be able
â end the inaugural ceremonies at
Washington.
â¢Just at present I cannot say when I
will resign my position as a Circuit Judge,
though it will certainly not be before
I pesident McKinley takes his office. This
is not because I fear President Cleveland
will name my successor, for he would
. do so during the short time that
intervenes before inauguration day, but
because I wish to clear up as much work
as possible before taking my new posi
tion.
"i really know little about what port
folio I will receive, and I doubt if I shall
know before 1 sse President McKinley at
agton. It may be the Secretary
ship oi the interior or the Attorney-Gcn
efcaUhip.
â â¢Both are places which a lawyer may
appropriately fill, the Secretaryship of
tne Interior not Jess so, perhaps, than the
Attorney-General's position. In fact,
there is much of trie business appertain
ing :o the Department of the Interior
which quite in line, so to speak, with
taut of the United States Circuit Courts.
At the same time, don't understand mo
as saying that a lawyer should necessarily
be ciios n as Secretary of the Interior, for
no one needs to be loid that we have had
excellent heads of that department who <
fcave n-ot been members of the legal wo
ie^sion."
.Judge McKenna statea that he had no
definite idea as to who would be his suc
cessor as Circuit Judge.

"It seems." said President Julian Sonn

"that the authorities at Folsom prison
are intending to push this rock-crusher

with crushed rock. It may even extend
to dressed and undressed granite.
'If these proceedings are permitted to

"We know for certain that rock which

JORDAN DEFENDS HIS ORTHODOXY.
His Letter in Answer to His Critic;;, Which, He Says, Will
Be His Last Word in the Controversy.
The following letter was sent by D.r. Jordan to the Oakland Tribune, with the
announcement that it would be his last word in the controversy:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, February 5, 1897.
G. F. Hatton, Editor " Oakland Tribune," Oakland, Cal.â My Dear Sir: Your
kind note offering raÂ« the use of your columns in reply to an " open letter" is
received. The letter in question seems not to be .'mended for me, as I have seen
it in five newspapers and have had no word from the author. Perhaps it was in
tended for the "galleries."
In any case, it requires no answer. I may however say that, so far as I know,
I have never been more " orthodox" or less orthodox than to-day, nor is it any
concern of the public if I were. 1 have never knowingly ridiculed any honest
man's religion. I have never said that " religion is the debris of the dreams of
our grandmothers." 1 regard religion as the great motive force in human prog
ress, but, like gold and diamonds, it has many imitations. I have never denied
the phenomena of instantaneous conversion, nor can 1 hold myself rcsponsib'c
for the accuracy of snapshot reports of what I have said or may say. have
never denied the helpfulness of soberly conducted revivals, in which the purpose
is that of forming a Christian ideal of character. Jn my talk at Berkeley I had
in mind solely what Dr. Ditto has called "the orgies of Mrs. Woodworth's fol
lowers." I have seen accounts of them in the Oakland papers of last year, and I
have myself been present in New York and South Carolina in "revivals"
w hich seemed to me veritable scenes from the " Inferno." >Yith the madness of
these scenes religion has nothing to do. Similar scenes can be brought
about by the taste of blood or by alcoholic madness. The sole dif
ference of Importance is the character of the hypnotic suggestion and in the
purposes of those who direct them. For cruel and terrible things have been un
knowingly done by good and devout men. To destroy the mental balance
through overstrained lcligious excitement is to offer up human sacrifices.
I had supposed that such things were now mostly confined to ignorant com
munities and to professional cataieptics of the character ascribed to .Mrs. Wood
worth and the "boy revivalist," Mr. Harrison. It seems that this is not so. I
find on my desk to-day a letter from a trustworthy friend, who w rites from a
town not far from Oakland. I suppress the name, but quote the letter otherwise
verbatim, because it illustrates exactly the kind of work which, in common with
all physicians and most evangelical clergymen, I condemn:
"I saw in Monday's 'Call.'" says my correspondent, "a statement of yours
regarding revival insanity that I w ant to say 'Amen' to. I believe that thing
to be a work of darkness, unworthy of the Christian culture of this, our cen
tury ; more treacherous because it is practiced in Christian churches, and more
mischievous because it weakens the w ills of those whose earnest desire it is to
be godly.
"During the revival here there has been a great deal of; excitement. So
called converts raved in the meetings as lunatics in an asylum, fell on the floor,
and one young lady went into trances. In her trances, which sometimes lasted
all night, she visited heaven ; saw Jesus and a golden crown awaiting her there.
In the first one Jesus told her, so she said, that she would die unless a certain
young man, named ,w as 'saved.' At 3 o'clock, in the morning the young
man was summoned to the church and prevailed upon to 'be converted.' The
next night she went into a second trance, visited heaven, and Jesus called
fÂ° r > another young man about town ; that he must be saved or she would
die. returned a profane answer. In spite of this failure she is still
alive, and has failed in another trance since, in which a third young man had
been called.
"I believe such things are an abomination. If there is a time in my life that I
would recall most gladly it is when, as a boy, I attempted to make a start toward
a better life amid the frenzy and hysterics of a revival of this type."
If there is ever a time in life when "a sober mind" in wanted it is when one
sets forth to cast aside childish and worldly things and to lead the higher lifo
which the author of the "Sermon on the Mount" has made possible for all of us.

APPEAL TO THE
PRESIDENT-ELECT
Fruit-Growers Ask for an
Increase in the
Tariff.
Eastern Market Flooded by For
eign Prunes, Raisins and
Walnuts.
D. H. Porter of Porter Bros. Voices
tue Sentiment of the Trade
in California.
By no class perhaps in the community
is the approaching installation of McKin
ley aud the dawn of a new administra
tion pledged to ameliorative measures
more confidently anticipated than by the
fruit-growers of California and tne com
mission merchants who handle their
products.
The McKinley protective tariff formerly
guaranteed to these important interests a
satisfactory degree of prosperity, but the
latter was unhappily short-lived, and the
passage of the Wilson bill was the signal
for its extinction. The prospect of a
speedy resumption of a protective tariff,
coupled with an inadequate supply from
other sources in the Eastern market,
caused an immediate increase of Califor
nia shipments last year, which may be
taken as an augury of permanent pros
perity when the President-elect is actu- I
ally insta led.
D. 11. Porter of Porter Bros., the com
mission merchants of California street,
expressed the general sentiment of the
trade in conversation with a Call repre
sentative yesterday. "During the last
thirty days," be said, "we have made
two shipment*, consisting of 10,000 boxes
earn, of prunes to France and Hamburg,
and last year quite a number of carloads
were tupulicd to foreign markets. Re
cent advices received from wholesalers
who handled these shipments state that
they are the first fruit ever imported into
France. The prunes in question were of
ti:e largest size, coing fony and titty to
the pound, which are rarely seen in
France in any quantity.
"Ii should be added that this apparent
increase in the trade is no criterion of av
erage conditions. The margin of profit
for the last three or four years has been
virtually nil. Last season, however, we
made a bare living owing to extremely
*hort crops in the East, with the exception
of the apple crop, which was unusua.ly
lar^e, and the exhaustion ot the previous
year's shipments. This comoination of
favorable circumstances created a demand,
which, however, cannot be relied on to
occur witii very great frequency.
'"The present uuty upon prunes of \yÂ±
cents a pound is entirely inadequate, as
it allows Turkish, French and German
prunes to undercut us in the New York
market. The prices of California fruits
are directly affected, because, as a mat
ter of fact, the Eastern buyers never
discriminate, nor do they pay exclusive
regard to quality, but purchase the cheap- ,
est article in the market. As far as peaches
and apricots are concerned, we are not
alraid of competition, but California
ruisin*-, almonds anil walnuts need protec
tion. The California almond is admittedly
the finest in the worid. its shell is softer
than and its ti.ivur superior to that of any
other variety produced abroad.
"We are of opinion that a cent and a
half increase of the present duty on
prunes, or a total duty ol about 3 cents,
would prove satisfactory. Tne duty on
nuts should be 5 cents, at least. lam no:
absolutely sure of the ;imount of the exist
ing duly on prunes, but believe it to be as
stated ; in any event it is very light. The
McKinley bill afforded us the necessary
protection in this particular, but the Wi.
mm bill enforced the reductions i refer to.
The commission merchant should prop
erly make a net profit of 5 per cent and
the grower 2or 3 cents a pound over and
above all expenses. At present if he real
ized half a cent he is doing well.
"The restoration of the tariff, if it pro
vides the necessary duty on California
fruits, v, ill benefit the Slate general. y.
The farmer will begin to make money,
and when the farmer is prosperous every
body is prosperou-. The btate is inter
ested in this question to the extent of
millions of dollars, and it b nothing more
than reasonable for us to demand a cer
tain decree of protection. Bear in mind
that wo do not ask for anything in the
shape of a boun'y.
"The Chamber of Commerce has taken
the matter up, and shortly after McKm
'ey's election nearly every commission
hous** here, handling fruii, sent samples
to the President-eiect, with an accom
panying request that he would bear in
mind the fact thai California needs pro
tection. We look for better traae next
yearâ provided, of course, that the Me-
Kin ley tunfl restores the duty on Califor
nia fruits."
DSESS SUIT ON THE EUN.
R. E. Steele Makes a - wo D.ivs' Chase
After It, but Finds. lt Not.
R. E. Steele has brought suit in the Jus
tices' Court against the Pacific Transfer
Company, and in his complaint tells quite
a tale of woe about a dres9-suit case and
its contents â its swallow-tailed coat, low
cut vest and bifurcates. The complaint is
full of legal phrases about the aforesaid
case and contents, etc., but these techni
cal expressions do not detract from the
pathos of the story, which runs the legal
veroiage like a streak of sunshine through
clouds.
On January 3. 1897. so Mr. Steele sets
forth, he was t c owner ot a "certain
dress-suit case and contents of the value
of $66 50, and that he was then and there
entitled to the immediate use of the
same" â presumably the contents; but tne
defendant on January 3 "came into posses
sion of the case and contents and wrong
fully and unlawfully took, converted and
appropriated the same."
Then tho complaint, without pausing
to aay whether tne dress suit fitted the
transfer company, or any part thereof, aD

picture of a stern chase after the elusive
garments.
"The defendant still keeps and refuses
to deliver the said case and contents, and
the plaintiff has spent two days in the

spent was reasonably worth $10."

Steele statistically estimated bis aatnapei
as follows: Case and contents. $66 50;

with interest on the value of the articles,
have brought the amount of the claim up
to $101 50.

MOONEY WAS RAMPANT
A Drunken Police Officer Fires
Three Shots in a Street
Car.
He Was Drowning a Sorrow and Lost
Track of the Proprieties of
Official Conduct-
Officer Joseph Mooney, who has been on
the police force of this City for thirteen
year-, started in yesterday morning on a
lurid celebration in which Mission liquor
ana v loud-voiced revolver were promi
nent elements, and at the termination of
which he found himself bereft of nis star
and temporarily relegated to the ranks of
the civilians. *
Mooney, his fellow ofhcers aver, has
always been an exemplary officer, but of
late he has been almost insane from grief
at the loss of his wife, who died about a
month ago. After reporting off at 8
o'clock yesterday morning he went in
dustriously to work to drown his sorrows,
and by noon he was hilariously drunk,
and in this condition he entered a car of
the San Francisco and San Mateo line
near the corner of Guerrero and Twenty
third streets.
Mooney dropped his umbrella from tha
car and the obliging conductor stopped to
pick it up. The car's halt suggested to
Mooney that tnings were moving too
slowly. He drew his revolver, an inci
dent of his official position, and com
menced livening things up in a manner
that would have done credit to Wild West
notion.
Three shots he fired in rapid succession.
Two of these went over his head and a
third lodged in the framework over the
windows.
Fortunately the passengers in toe car at
the time were few, and those who wit
nessed the affair lost little time in seeking
the sidewalk. For the remainder of his
journey Mooney had a nice roomy car all
to himself.
A complaint was at once lodged with
Chief Crowley, who, in view of Mooney's
recent bereavement, was inclined to view
Mooney's indulgence more leniently than
he otherwise might. Nevertheless he had
Mooney brought before him at once. He
was deprived of his star and was placed
upon the suspension list until such time
as the Commissioners shall pass upon his
case. Tiie charge against him is intoxica
tion an<l conduct unbecoming an officer.

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO, lv.', P'eb. 5 Wheat was a shade
lower to-day, but there was a fairly steady tone
and moderately good demand at the decline. The
deprecia.ion in price was due to 1 1 verpool's dis
regard of the French crop shortage, to which our
strength of yesterday was mainly ascribed.
The Paris and French country markets were
also under no apparent worry as to the outlook,
and the belief that we were borrowing trouble
found expression in the decline which look place
this morning. The Northwest received 299 cars,
against 194 last Friday and 584 a year ago.
Chicago had nineteen cars and inspected out
106,325 bushels. Quite liberal exportsâ
bushe sâ lmparted strength about the middle of
the session, but closing weak is at Liverpool de
stroyed the growing confidence and resulted in a
setback to prices- Closing Paris cables were lower
and Berlin higher. Antweru was unchanged.

UNION STOCKYARDS. 1i.,.. Feb. 5.-The re
: ceipts of cattle this week have been so light that
j there was a better market, to-day Is usually
, seen on Friday. ThÂ« week's receipts will be about
1 the same in number as last week, during which
â¢ period 42,300 head were received. The consump
tion of be<-f is not porc-pubiy larger than It has
been for some time past, and the Improvement
j thai has taken place has been attributable en
tirely 10 light supplies. About 3000 arrived to
day, and the/ gold at from strong to 10c higher
j prices. With an estimated run of 23.000 bead
and a moderately ac ive demand from Chicago
packers and shipper*, prices or hogs were steady
early, breaking 2y 2 @sc later. If to-morrow's re
ceipts are as lar Â« us last at in day's, the wee-c's
arrivals will be 17 1.000 head .gainst 157.175 last
week and 10.917 a year ago. Packers have taken
the hoes as fa-t as ."hey arrived, but they bought
them at low price*. The week's receipts of sheep
have fallen greatly below last week's and the de
cline which occurred early in the wesk has been
fully recovered. Ihe market to-day was firm to
slightly higher.

DUN'S KJEVIKW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Feb. 5.â R. O. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow in thÂ»lr weekly review of
trade: No Important change in business appears,
but the number of manufacturing establishments
starting up much exceeds those shutting down
during the week, and so much that the curtail
ment of working time in many cotton-mills prob
ably does not lessen the aggregate productive
force or amount of wages paid. There is distinct
increase in orders for wonlen goods, some Improve
ment In silk manufacture, a wal Ing condition
with gain In one branch of boots and shoes and in
dications of better things coming in the Iron and
steel manufacture.
To many it is the most discouraging feature of
current events that wheat does not rise much,
thoi eh it has advanced l%c for the week. Atlan
tic exports have been only 1.696,460 bushels,
flour included; against 1,965,456 for the same
week last year, while Western receipts have been
only 1,406,170 bushels, against 2.800.407 last
week. The course of the market is not explained
by any special information, but current prices
â¢how that no especial confidence is felt in the esti
mates of supplies available fur the rest of the
year.
Cotton fell to 71 aftÂ»r the agreement to close
the Fall River and other print cloth works be
came known, but recovered the quo atioa o.' a
week 7.Hlcâ without further news. Spin
ners' takings have bern no small bis year, that of
the Northern mills being 000 bales than in
1894-95, that the admitted narrow S3 of the de
mand for goods has at present considerable weight.
It appears that foreign trade Is also somewhat re
st-tcted by the nairownt'SH of demand. The sales
of wool have been smaller than in other recent
weeks and yet are far in excess of the consump
tion of all weeks if all were constantly employed.
At three chief markets trie aggregate lor the
week has been 13,544.700 pounds. There has
! been only a slight oliffeniug in prices, but more
foreign wool will be taken kihl stored, it is be
-1 lieved, if Western holders continue to demand
higher price*.
Prices of R'ssemer pig and Grey forge at Pitts
-1 bun; have slightly advanced with a much more
] hopctul flint;, notwithstanding the co i.p .rati ye
narrowness of the demand for finlshe.l products,
end in plaies and wire nails there is much more
business, with good prospects.
R lifts are quoted at $15 25, with scarcely any
deman 1 at present, and rods at {.'l, while No. -'7
black sheets were quote! at only 2 cents. Re
ports ' ha: only 25.000 tons of .steel and sheet bars
have been exported to England arÂ« only Indica
tion* of the temporar ' excess of supply over de
ijianlin ibis count and Â»re not supposed to
have realized Â«ny profit. Yet it Is mated th*t
prices i.f cast pipe are trom S2 to S3 per tan lower
I nt New York than at Scotch works.
I Kara are quoted at the lowest price ever known
at Pbiladephia, without much Improvement in
the demand, and fleet rails are still Inactive an 1
unchanged la price, the railroads waiting for a de
ciiu* corresponding to the tali in billets. But on
1 the wholeihe demand for Iron and steel products
Is slowly gaining, and a considerable portion of
the woric is lul'.y employed, though the gam is not
I yet enough lor tho->e who have taken large stocks
of material or pioducts on speculation.
In the money market there appears no em
barrassment, . ill the argesale of .Nor;hem Pa
cific and Oregon Navigation securities to Kuro
pean capitalists has given additional assurance
that balanif-t due this country will not b' can-
I colleJ tor some months to come, so that the pntut
1 of possible gold export* is removed still turth* r.
Trie course of th* stocK market has been uuln
strucllveand dealings have not been large. Hut
the ay rase cf railroad stocks has advanced a
Email fraction ana the average of trust stock has
Bilgbtiy de. lined.
Failures for the week have bÂ«en 311 In the
United S.ate-i, acalnst 323 last year, and 63 in
Canada, against 67 last year.

MICROBES IN BOOKS.
Sanitary Measures Adopted in European
Libraries.
It is a fact that has been well demon
strated that contagious diseases may be
spread by means of books which may have
been in the hands o! the sick or conva
lescing. All the eruptive maladies, acar
letina and vanoloid among others, as well
as diphtheria, may be transmitted in tnis
manner.
Throughout Europe, and especially in
England, strenuous efforts are being made
to stop this source of contagion. At Edin
burgh already a regular service has been
organized by which the directors of libra
ries are notified each day of the names and
addresses of all those in the city who are
ill of contagious diseases. The librarians
thereupon make careful search to find if
any of their books have been lent in any '
of the houses specified. When such is
found to be the case the health depart
ment seizes the books, which are then
either disinfected or destroyed according
to the nature of the illness. Whon a book,
for example, has been in the hands of one
ill of varioloid it is immediately destroyed.
At Bradford, Kucland, similar measures
are also in vogue and an effort is now be
ing made to put them into effect in Lon
don. This, however, owing to trie vast
and den?e population ot that city, will be
difficult of accomplishment.
In Paris this plan will also be followed
in the near future. At present the au
thorities of that city are endeavoring to
lind a satisfactory disinfectant. Experi
ments are beine made with the vapor of
formic aldehyde, which is produced by the
incomplete combustion of methylic alco
hol in contact with ihe air and incandes
cent platinum. This vapor, in addition
to its antiseptic properties, is easily em
ployed and is absolutely harmles to cloth
and* paper, and its discovery will doubt- I
i less hasten the adoption o' similar hygi
i enic measures in the public libraries of
this country. â N. Y. World.

â¢jos Broadw y, Feb. 5. f
Jack Mather returned last night from
Mexico, and but for the intervention of
the American Consul at Nosales he would
still be in a dungeon on suspicion of being
a smuggler.
Mather is a well-known Southern Pacific
fireman, residing in Oakland, and in the
early part oi October he made up his miml
that this locality was altogether too dull
ana uninteresting for a man who wished
to see more of the world. He fitted him
self out for a tr.p to Arizona and Mexico,
JACK MATHER, a Well-Known Fireman, Telling the Story of
His Experience in a Mexican JaiL
end nothing more was heard of him until
a rsontb ago, when a dispatch was received
from Xogaies stating that he was in jail.
His friends did what they could to cause
the in ervention of the American Consul,
but did not know how successful they had
been until Mather arrived. The story he
tells is somewhat romantic and he vouches
for its truth.
"Everything went well," said Maher,
"until I got down to Ei Pa s o, which city
is just across the river from Nogale?. One
Sunday morning I thought I would take
a trip into Mexican territory, and as
the two cities are connected by a bridge I
walked over it into the Mexican city. I
Ptroiled around for a few hours and took
in the town and aii the original sights,
and toward evening I started to go back
to K. Paso. Ihu 1 barely started when I
wus accosted Ijv a stranger just as 1 was
about to cross the bridgp. He had a little
parcel in his hand, which was directed to
a party in El Paso. He tola me he had
been detained and could not deliver it
himseif and asked me if 1 would attend to
it for him, at the ?ame tima offering me a
$1 bill for my trouble.
"At that time I was rather short of
money, for people who travel as I did do
not^jeneraliy carry letters of credit. So.
f-eein.' the chance to make $1, I accepted
his offer and toot tie parcel. The
stranger then left me and I proceeded on
my way toward El Paso. Beiore 1 pot to
the middle of the bridge I was stopped by
a Custom-house official an-l searched. 1
had noihine about me and was about to
walk on wnen the officer concluded to look
at the parcel.
"He opened it and to my sun-rise I saw
that it contained opals and other precious
stones. I was at once arrested and
cnarged with attempting to smuggle con
traband poods acr iss t!ie border. 1 was
thrown into jail at Nogales and it i 3 the
dampest, coldest and darkest dungeon 1
ever saw. You can't see your hand in
front of your ince. and when once the
door is closed it is never opened until the
prisoner is taken out. dead or alive. My
meals, which were just sufficient to keep
me from starving, were passed down to
me through a bole in the roof of the cell.
"After b Leg Confined for two or three
days 1 was enabled to get word through
one of the euards to the American Consul,
and was finally released.
"When I returned my friends thoncht
I was still in jail, and wen* at work trying

TRIES SUICIDE
His Mind Affected Because
of the Suicide of a Young
Cousin.
Arthur Cooke, Twelve Years
0 d, Takes Chloroform in
a Basement
As His Mania Appears to Be Perm : .
nent Re Is Ordered to an
Asyium.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,Â»
908 Broadway, Feb. 5. J
A very unhappy case or suicidal mama
developed last evening with the twelve
year-old son of the Rev. W. H. Cooke of
0244 Magnolia street.
About dusk last evening the boy was
found in the basement of the house by
members of the family unconscious and a
partly emptied bottle of chloroform was
by his side. Dr. Legault was at once
called and found that the boy had not in
haled very much of the deadly drug. He
had evidently saturated a handkerchief
with the chloroform and held it to his
nose. As soon as unconsciousness over
came him the handkerchief dropped to
his side and thus saved his life.
For nearly two months the boy has been
afflicted with a desire to end his life. This
unhappy decision was arrived at when his
cousin, Frank Locke, committed suicide
by taking poison and cutting his throat in
Golden Gate Park. Since that time the
boy has frequently appeared to be tempo
rarily deranged and has expressed the de
sire to end his life. He has told his
fatner that he might as well be dead, as
tne world did not need him.
The boy was examined this afternoon
before Judge Greene, and from the evi
dence and the testimony of Drs. Todd
and Selfridge tne lad was declared irre
sponsible and was sent to an asylum.
There was great uncertainty as to how
he procured the chloroform, bat this
afternoon Dr. Bodle, who keeps a drug
store on San Pablo avenue, cleared it up.
â¢'The other day Mrs. Cooke came to my
store," De s:tid, '"and got a bottle of chlo
roform, explaining that she was suffering
from looihache. The woman sa.d she
was Mrs. Cooke, but 1 do not know her,
alinougli I know tne Key. Mr. Cooke very
well. Yesterday a.ternoon the young
Cooke came to my store for another bottle
of chloroform, saying thai his mother was
still suffering from the toothache, so I
gave the drup."
The Rev. W. H. Cooke was at one time
pastor of the Nortti Oaklaud Congrega
tional Church, but at present he is nut in
charge of any churcn. He ascribes his
son's mania to the influence of the suicide
of his cousin, young Locke. The child
leil about a year airo ana injured his head,
and for several mouths hi* sight was
affected. He recently told Eddie James,
a schoolmate, that he wanted to commit
suicide, but that he had no grudge against
anybody, and be has frequeniiy told his
companions that he wanted to die.

A Lecture From an Eastern Delegate
Leads to Some Strongly Word.'d
Resolutions.

908 Broadway, Feb. 5. J
The Federation of Trades met last night
to hear Delegate Michael Raphael of the
Cigar-makers' Union of New York City in
regard to tenement-maoe cigars. Afteran
interesting speech the following strong
resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, The Alameda County Federation
of Trade-*, knowing thai the cigars sold and
consumed in this city are produced by Eastern
factories in tenement-houses; thiit as cigar
mnkers and their farnilii s are compelled to
hire apartments from the employer, in which
tiiey are forced to work and live, and pay ex
orbitant rents for same, from twenty to fitty
families working tn these structures under the
most unsanitary conditions; whereto, theie
workshops Â«nd living apartments combined
are dangerous to health. Sicknes-s and disease
of all kinus affect the occupants, thus
breeding contagion to the consumer,
as well as the producer. The degrading char
acter of this system of employment tends to
demoralize tlio sacredness oi home, dwarfs
the mental, moral and physical condition of
the children, who are, by force of circum
stances, prevented from attending school, in
being competed to work with the rest of the
members of the laraily ; therefore, be it
Betolped, That the AUmeda County Federa
tion oi 1 rades hereby declare that they will
use ail honorable meuns to discourage the sale
of such cigars, and will only patronize dealers
who have the Dive label of the Cigur-makers'
International Union pasted on every lot, and
see that wnlte labor v employed, and use all
cffjrts to encourage homo industry; bo it
further
KcsulvLd, That this federation inform deal
ers tuat we will refuse to pairorMze them
unless they agree to handle such cigars only
as bear the blue label and show ttml white
labor is employed.
Upon adjournment of the meeting the
members oi the various unions met in
lormally to take action in indorsing can
didates for the municipal election. A
committee of two members from eacn
union was appointed, an<J they will hold a

ALAMEDA, Cal , Feb. The attempt

ing inaugurated in the near future. Mr.
Kleuffer returned last evening from Stock
ton, where he went in answer to a sum
mons from his uncle, who is under arrest,
charged witn the killing of two men last
Tuesday at New Hope. He consulted
Attorney Tappan this morning and ad
mitted that a divorce would follow.
He refused to state which party would
take the initiative, but declared that he
and his wife would live together no
loncer.
"W> have been married only three
months," said lie to-day, '"and were living
together happily when outsiders began to
interfere. They began talking against me.
but cannot show one thing I have ever
done that I should be ashamed of. It is
simply a case of outsiders sticking their
noses into other people's affairs."
Mr. Klfupfer is considerably worfcea up
over the affair and speaks in a determined
manner. He promises to give hi- wife
every attention necessary, including a
nurse and physician, and settle the bills
for the same. He is willing to make any
concession in ti-e matter possible.

Ignored for Months Eecausc the Idea
Originated With the
Mayor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad wuy, Feb. 5. j
Although the Oakland Fire Department
proved to the jud-es of the horse show
that it could ni.ite a belter turnout than
any ot her department on the Pacific Coast
the Finance Committee of the City Coun
cil begrudges the small amount that was
expended by permitting the department
to exhibit.
The idea of sending a team to San Fran
cisco originated with P. E. Bowles, one of
the directors o! the horse sbow, and Mayor
Davie; and although the trophy which
was won is of considerable value it has
not yet been recognized officially by the
Fire Commissioners, but is confined in the
vault of Mr. Bowles' bank awaiting the
action of the board.
Councilman Kaufman in loosing over
the affairs at the City Hall to-day made
the discovery that the bill entailed by
sending the crack team across the bay is
just $'J3, Mayor Davie and others paid for
the decorations, and the bill presented to
the Council is fimply the salaries of sub
stitutes, who were employed while the
winning team was being prepared and was
on exhibition.
The bill was presented by the Fire De
partment in the usual course, and at the
la9t meeting of the Finance Committee it
decided not to pay It.
"In what other city on the face of the
! earth would so little civic pride be shown
}as over this matter?" exclaimed the
I Mayor this morning, when his expert told
him of the condition of affairs. "Here
we are with a valuable trophy on our
hands, bearing witness to the fact that
I we can make a finer showing than any
i oiher Fire Department on the coast, and
yet the cup is allowed to be hidden
away in a vault because of the in
difference of two members ol the
Fire Commission. Common decency
bbould have suggested that as soon as the
cup was received the F.re Commissioners
should have passed resolutions congratu
lating the department, accepting the cup
on behalf of the City and making an ap
propriation of a few dollars to purchase a
case in which it could be kept as an orna
ment in the otlice of the commission.
I instead of that, three months have passed
j and the City Attorney will introduce a
resolution at the next meeting bearing
I testimony to the fact that they are aware
I that the Fire Department won the first
prize.
"If such a thing had happened in Los
Angeles here would havo been a banquet,
to which all the Fire Department would
! have been invited, and tue citizens would
I not have ceased talking about it even by
this time, and I cannot understand why
Mams. Peirsol and W.lson should have
: shown so much indiftVrence or why Mr.
â  Manuel of the Finance Committee, who
I Dids good-by to politics In three weeks,
should so suddenly have become economi
cal except for the simple reason that the
idea oi sending the team across the bay
I originated with Mayor Davie."

THE NEW FOOTBALL CAPTAIN
BERKELEY. Cal.. Feb. 5. â "Bobby" K. Ilaskeil '97 was unanimously elected
captain of Berkelpy's football team this afternoon. Tbe thirteen men who by
virtue? of having played in the last intercollegiate game wore entitled to vote for
captain came together ai 4 o'clock and in a few minutes' time chose the man who
is to lead the U. C. team or victory to defeat on next Thanksgiving day. Tbe
other candidates for the placeâ Hall. Carr and Hutchinsonâ had withdrawn their
names and the tieid was left clear for Haskel!. He was practically elected outside
of the meeting, but in order to make his captaincy v..lid the formality of a
session of electors whs necessary. His choice as leader of the football forces
under the blue and sold meets with the hearty approval of the ontire
body. \\ hat the place for Has>kell was lis conscientious and careful work
while training, his da>h and spirit wm:e at play, his knowledge of California
players and his superior generalship.
Though but a payer of two years' experience, he has made phenomenal devel
opment in ihe science and tactics of the game. In his first two years at college
he did not play at all, but acquiring a fomlness for the sport came out in bis
junior year. He was first piacea at end and then at quarter. So rapidly did he
improve that when the season of 1896 opened he was placed in charge of the
second eleven, which he captained from his position at quarter. In all of tho
contests with the clubs during last fall Hask-U played quarter during part of the
game. In the inteicolle>;iate he was callad out to take the place ot Kennedy, who
broke his nose during the last half. From the time he came on the field till the
finish he kept the team goin^ at a hot pace, which is his characteristic method.
He accompanied the team on its Southern California tour, during the Christmas
vacation, and played quarter in tlie first four tames.
Haskell hails from San Bernardino, where he graduated from the high school.
He is now in hi 3 twenty-third year, stands 5 feet 6 inches and weighs, stripped
and when in training, IS6 pounds. He is of stocky build and well muscled
especially across the chest and shoulders.
Haskell entered college in '93 as a special, but after a time he changed his
status to that of a regular student. Wuile nominally a member of the class of
'97, he will not graduate in May, because of the change he made late in his course.
He will return next term to make up the balance of his hours, and will take bis
degree in Decembar. .

PAT MURPHY WAS
ON HIS METTLE
In a Very Close Finish He
Downed Moylan a
Nose.
Benamela Administered Another
Sound Drubbing to Morte
Fonse.
Lady Hurst First at Odds of 60 to 1
E mer F Scored a V ry C:ever
Winâ E^taca in Front.
There was a very close finish at Ingle
side yesterday, and the decision of the
judges did not meet with the approbation
of all of the assembled crowd, a number
of whom gathered around the judges'
stand and manifested their dissatisfaction
in ioud horse talk. The cause of all the
gibberish was the nose-and-nose termina
tion of the fourth race, in which Pat
Murphy gained ihe decision over Moylan.
Borne were positive that Moyian won by a
hea:), while others maiie it a length. The
fact of the matter was that opposite the
paddeck Moylan looked a handy winner,
but "dogged" it badly the last fifty yards,
and the fast-coming Pat nipped him a
no-e on the wire. It is f roba'uiy fortunate
for bettors that some of these noisy gentry
who indulge in much of the "Kicking" are
not picking head finishes from the stand,
for the police would be called on every
day to quell incipient riots.
Pat Murphy has shown race form of
late, ana bis partisans backed him down
from 12 to 7. Slaughter roiie one of his
rare good finishes, and Jones on Moylan
was just a bit chaeriued over the result.
Yemen, the 11 to 5 favorite, ridden by T.
61<">an. was unplaced.
The well-known trainer, Mat Storn,
sprung quite a surprise in the first race, a
six-furlons dash lor maiden three-year
olds.
He entered Atticus and Lady Hurst,
the pair cor pled reaching at one stage 60
10 lin the betting. In a bard drive Lady
Hurst finished a length in front of The
Tourist, a 50 to 1 outsider ridden by
Golden. Basquil, the favorite, was third.
I'ickine up 107 pounds Benamela, the 4
to 5 favorite, made a paliop of the mile
and a sixteenth selling run. romping in
nearly two lengths ahead of Morte Fonse,
which horse had second call in the ring.
Two Cheers ran a clever race, being third
ciose up at the end.
In the six-furlong spin that was next
called a miscellaneous collection of sell-
Ing-platers lined us, ten starting in all.
Elmer F was played from threes to 5 to 2
favoritism, and taking the lead from Red
Bird in the stretch won very handily from
Whitestone, who made a fine run from
the rear. Minnie Ccc, away poorly, was
third.
The final seven-furlont; run proved an
easy thing for the 7 to 10 favorite. Estaca,
on which Sloan had the leg up. He took
the lead irom Ei^emount at the far turn
and, not extended, passed the stand two
lengths in front of Adrlie Buchanan, with
the second choice, St. Aignon, third.
THE HOBART STAKE TO-DAY
The Greatest Field of Starters That
Has Faced the Barrier This
Season.
Seven well-hLled events make up the
card at Ineleside to-day. It is the clos
ing day of the meeting and the rich Ho
bart stake is the special feature of the
programme. All of the best handicap
horses, both local and Eastern, are entered
and at weights that give the race a very
open look. T^e crack jockeys of the coun
try will be seen sporting silk, and the
finish should be a memorable one. It is
the best field that has faced ibo barrier
this season.
After the hubbub over the Pat Murphy-
Moylan finish had subsided, Ed CorrigaD,
owner of Moylan, said jokingly to eoaie
friends, "'I went up in the stand ana told
the judges that 1 hoped they wouldn't
think I was Ut9 one that was making all
tout noise."
The Chicaco turfman added if any one
was loser throtu h the tight finisb lie
thought he ouuht to be counted in, but
that he was perfectly satisfied tbe officials
made no error. Captain Kees, the pre
siding judge, is a man of very keen per
ceptive powers, with a world of experi
ence in separating hordes at tbe wire, and
horsemen who have raced .on .Eastern
tracks where that official bus presided in
the stand say his mistakes have been few
and very, very far between.
Pat Dunne had his horse Benamela
I tilted a few hundred by Tommy Griffin.
I The brown colt was entered to be Bold in
! the selling event he won for $500. Griffin
ran second with Morte Fonse, and when
Benamela was led up to be auctioned
Tommy oid him up to $1000, Mr. Dunne
retaining his horse with the usual $5.

OTHER FUNDS IN VIEW
THIS YEAR.
The Proceeds of Clnb Games
Will Go to the Monu
ment Fund.
IMPORTANT COMMITTEES ARE
APPOINTED.
Every Member cf the Order Is in
Earnest and There Is Hope for
the Enterprise.
There was a largely attended and en
thusiastic meeting of the Caledonian Club
at Scottish Hall last night, the special ob
ject of the meeting beinc to take ateps
toward raising a fund ior the Burns mon
ument.
After a brief discussion, the resolution
of T. C. Lawson was adopted, providing
that the net proceeds of all games and
gatherings for 1807 be devoted to the
Burns monument fund. The resolution,
heretofore published in The Call, recites
that the building of a monument to
Burns in this City would be a credit to
the City and State, as wellaa to the Scotch
residents, showing that the people of the
far West appreciate the genius of the im
mortal bard.
Mr. Lawson's resolution was unani
mously adopted, following which it was
resolved to appropriate $1000 forthwith
for the Burns monument fund, the money
to be set aside from any funds now in the
treasury.
A number of communications from
sculptors and monument - irakers were
read and placed on tile, also a hearty let
ter from Judge Edward A. Belcher, who
slated that he would be pleased, at the
proper time, to contribute to the monu
ment fund. The letter was spread on the
minutes.
"We have met to act rather thsn to talk
to-night." said Chieftain McNeill, "and 1
think it is proper for us to show our in
tentions by getting into shape to do prac
tical work at the earliest possible moment.
The whole world honors the memory of
Burns, and the genius of mankind has
revered his contributions to literature. I
am proud that this band of Scots is so
active in be naif of so noble a cause as the
building of a monument to the memory
of h:m so dearly boloved in every clime.
1 am ready to announce the Burns monu
ment committee, winch will have charge
of the enterprise for this year."
The following were appointed on the
committee: D. R. McNeil], John Reid,
George Davidson, James ri. Duncan, J.W.
Cameron, D. A. Ma'.donald, Colin M.
Boyd, J. F. Kennedy, Angus McLeod,
Charies A. McPbee, James McNab. John
M. DuncMii, William Nicol, F. F. Finlay,
John McLaren, J. E. MacCormac, Angus
Graham, T. C. Lawson, Robert Suther
land, J. W. Harris.
In view of the fact that the net profits of
all games and gatherings for the year will
go to the monument fond, the personnel
of the committee in charge becomes in
teresting. It is as follows: D. R. Me-
Neill, John Reid, George David?on, James

couragement has been received from all
persons approached on the subject, and

church, and, passing over the platform,
will disappear into the adjoining room
and the door will be closed just as the '
"five foolish virgins" arrive only to find it i
is indeed "too late."
The end of the parable is almost trasic,
for the girls seem to entirely lose their
identity and become in reality the foolish,
foolish virpins. According to the pastor
the representation will almost Undoubt
edly convey the lesson it is intended to
teach.
The singing is very effective, and both
the pastor, Dr. I'ord, and Mrs. Luse may

THE ''INS" REMAIN IN.
Three Directors Elected by the
Masonic Cemetery Asso
ciation.
The Opposition Voted lor a Full New
Board, and Will Carry the
Case Into Court.
The contest between the "ins" and the
"outs" of the Masonic Cemetery Associa
tion resulted, upon a casting of the vote
Wednesday afternoon, in a distinct victory
for the -'ins" â that is, the present admin
istration.
The question at issue was as to the elec
tion oi three directors at thU time or a
full board ot nine.
The "ins" in their action follow the law
of 1858â the rural cemetery act â under
whicu the association was incoroorated,
which requires that the directors be
elected for three years, but that the terra
of tlm c of them expire every year and be
filled by ;i;i election. This has been the
course since the incorporation. Oppo
sition to it being raised by certain persons
interested this year, the advice of Ex-
Justice of the Supreme Court M. H.
Myrick and Charies L. Patton was sought,
and tiiey declared that the statute of 1858
still eoverne<i.
The opposition still protested, however,
delaring that the State Code repealed that
law. They set up a full ticket of nine di
rectors, and declared if their votes were
not counted for the nine they would carry
the matter into the couris.
The relative strength of the "outs" and
the "ins" was tested by a vote on the re
port of the committee on proxies early
yesterday afternoon. The committee was
composed of Frank VV. Sumner, Charles L.
Patton and A. H. Phelps. They reported
against nearly ninety proxies on the
ground that they did not represent full
lot?, which alone entitle the holder
10 a voie; that the joint owners of lots had
not all signed the proxies, and for other
such reasons which seemed to them good.
The vote in favor of the report was 5<J7,
against 313.
The ticket of the "ins" for the three di
rectors carried the names of Thomas
Kyle, George J. Hobe and F. W. G.
Moebus. It received the 5G6 votes.
The opposition ticket was as follows:
Aaron Doud, Charles Bone, Joseph Klop
ens:ine, J. K. C. Hobbs, G. Howard
Thompson, F. W. G. Moebus, E. M. Koot
W. F. McAJester, W. B. Bradbury. It re
ceived 319 votes. The former* was of
course elected, and would have been in
any case, but especially so inasmuch as
the votes for the nine were thrown out,
the tellers bÂ«ing unable to count them,
the election being called for the election
of but three. This forms the ground upon
which the leaders of the opposition will
go to court â the refusal to count their
votes.
The proposition was made to those
opposed to the administration to name
some suitable person for trustee and he
would be accepted by the majority and
made ono of the three. This was refused.

HIS TRENCHANT PEN
AT REST FOREVER
Mathew G. Upton, the Vet
eran Journalist, Passes
Away.
A Second Stroke of Apoplexy
Carries Off the Brilliant
Writer at Berkeley.
Of Lonsj and Varied Experience, H;
Work d lor the People and
Against Their Foes.
M. G. Upton, the veteran journalist and
editorial writer, died last evening at 8:50
o'clock at bis home, 2419 Durant avenue,
Berkeley.
He had been suffering from a complica
tion of ailments for four years, but up to
the last sear of his life he continued at in
tervals to wield his trenchant pen. The
immediate cause ot death was apoplexy,
the second stroke falling upon him yester
day morning about 10 o'clock. His wife
and family (with the exception of bis
eldest son, W. 13. Upton, a civil engineer
now in Washington, D. C. ) were with him
at the la?t. Everything was done to avert
death, but without avail. His loss will
be mourned by a large circle of friends.
Mathew G. Upton was a native of Ire
land and a graduateof Dublin University.
In early life i.c went to New York to bet
ter his fortunes, and there he began his
career as a journalist. Hi? energy and
force of character were fully equal to Lis
culture, lie was soon known in all the
newspaper offices of the metropolis as an
efficient and conscientious jonrna ist. He
was city editor of the New York Herald
for a time, where he acquired a wide
knowledge of men and methods.
He came to California in the early days,
somewhere about lS:y2. An expert sten
ographer, something of a rara avis in
ttiose days, his services became speedily
much in demand and he earned large sum s
in that way. but he was a born journalist.
He connected himself with the Herald in
this City, with which were other writers
who bad been on the staff of the New
Yorfc Herald.
His duties were multifarious. There
was no telegraphic news. He wrote lo
cals, editorials, paragraphs and articles of
all sorts, all wita equal facility and readi
ness Had his advice been followed the
Herald would not have been found in op
position to the Vigilance Committee and j
probably would not have met with dis
aster.
When he went from the Herald an edi
torial position awaited him on the old
Alta. He was the principal editor and \
writer oi thai journal when it was a power
commercially and politically in the State, i
While he was guiding the editorial policy I
of the Alta tbe railroad company sought !
to acquire possession of Goat Island. Mr. |
Upton fought that scheme with such skill
and persistency that he was appointed one >.
of the committee oi rive who were named !
to go to Washington to confer with Presi- j
dent Grant. To his influence much of the
well-known success of that mission was !
very justly attributed. The argument I
employed to influence President Grant
was that it was a military necessity for the
Government to retain possession of the |
island.
In 1872 or 1873 Mr. Upton was invited to
become one oi the editorial writers of the
Bulletin. There his literary style, which
had been good, was developed to perfec
tion. He was master of English. He
wrote laboriously, carefully and slowly
The result was a "finished product, consid
ered from a purely lilerary standpoint.
Ho was concise, polished and erudite, ant
his learning extended into many fielus
In the direction whither the natural ben
of his talent led him his mind was encyclo
pedic.
In connection with theeditorial column
of the Bulletin during the period extend
ir.tr up to 1895 he exerted a strong influ
ence during a continuous engagement o
nearly a quarter of a century. George X
Fitcb, the veteran journalist and lone
lime proprietor of the Bulletin, was hts
Both came early to California and took
a keen, instructive interest in public
affairs and public men. Their retentive
memories were akin. With them all men
of good will counseled. Only evil-doers
cringed when they cracked without mercy,
and having an eye to the public gooa, the
editorial whip.
Mr. Upton's intimate acquaintance with
the pioneers and tne history of the early
days, enabled him to judge with almost
unerring accuracy the motives of a large
number of men who have moved con
spicuously on the public stage in Califor
nia. He knew of their abilities â and he
ai ways carried a scrapbook. His services
may be best understood by Caiifornia peo
ple from tne statement that he was the
Bulletin's chief editorial writer on politi
cal and municipal affairs for many years.
Subjects which would be dry, ueated
by another, were made sources of peren
nial delight as tbey were mastered by his
pen. Statistics were arranged in such a
way as lo avoid being dull and distaste
ful. Argument was embellished by irony
ami a strong, masterful. humor, with a
peruliar flavor all its own.
Invective was so handled that it caused
those against whom it was directed to
wince ami smart. More than any other
editorial writer in California he possessed
"infinite variety" in his treatment of
themes constantly presented and repre
sented. His mind was a fountain of
quaint thoughts.
But at no time could Mathew G. Upton
be considered a trifler. He was always
very much in earnest. His flying sar
casms were aimed with deadly certainty
and intent at some target which was
rarely if ever missed entirely.
His humor did not detract from the
logic of a situation as he clearly saw it,
and his readers never lost the point that
he perspicaciously made. At all times
itnd at, all seasons he had the public good
before him as his incentive. Fearless and
aggressive he was at the same time self
contained and cool-headed in the treat
ment of questions of great public concern.
Therefore he was not betrayed into mak
ing frequent mistakes. He thought sev
eral limes before he wrote and no article
was permitted to appear from his pen
until he had carefully stuiiied over it and
considered it in the proof flips.
His industry was unsparing and un
tiring. He kept close account of all
financial statements made by City and
State officials, and knew better, probably,
than anyman in San Francisco just how
the balances stood, on any given day, in
the hands of public officials in California.
Every financial report submitted by a
public oflicial was studied diligently and
duly digested. The same systematic re
search was applied to legislative meas
ures, local, S;ate and National, and he
was an authority wtiose accuracy conid
be relied upon implicitly as to facts of
many kinds.
He was the stanch and intelligent
friend of the '"doliar limit" in San Fran
cisco, the stout and uncompromising foe
of corruption wherever it reared its head,
the doughty champion of the people in
the great struggle to throw off the grow
ing incubus of Chinese immigration, the
keen analyst, logical reasoner and astute
observer who when the Bulletin a very few
years ago attacked the Pacific Railroad
funding scheme in its incipiency Dierced
Mr. Huntington's armor with searching
keenness and helped to iay the foundation
for others to buila on.
No more striking proof of the clever- '
ness of the editorial management of the i
Bulletin politically was probably ever af- |
lorded than when, a few years ago, John
F. i^wift and Washington Bartlett were
named as candidates for Governor respec
tively by the Republican and Democratic
parties of California, both nominations
being made to cÂ«tch the indorsement of
the Bulletin. Politicians laughed and
shook their heads at Una unique spec
tacle.
Personally Mr. Upton was a very esti
mable gentleman, the embodiment of
honor and probity, a firm and true friend
and a good enemy. His virtues were
many and sterling. He was a valuable
citizen, an indulgent and kind husband
and father. Those who knew him most
intimntely admired him most. By these
he will be long mourned, his taking away
from life being an irreparable loss. He
leaves a widow and three children, one
son and two daughters.
