TROUBLED ATHENS.
Large Numbers 'of Irregulars Are Swarming
Into the City, and It Is Impossible to

ATHENS. Gkeecf, May 23.â The neu- 1
tra! zone decided apon yesterday by lhe
Grsecc-Turkisli Commission appointed for
the purpose under itie stipulations of tbe
armistice includes the pass?s of Mount
Oth ryÂ«. This compels each army to re
treat slightly. Thy commission decided
that the regular ti oops would replace the
ineuulars employed as advance guards on
both aides.
It trar. spires that the battle of Dhoinoko
was a Sedan that failed. Edhem Pasha
planned to completely overpower and i
capture tbe Greek array. The divisions
commanded by Hairi, Nuschat and Hamdi
Pashas ought to have converged at Dbo
mcko, while Memrtuh PaÂ«ha was to nut
off the retreat of the Greeks through
FourKa Pass. Hairl Pasha, however,
failed to attack the Greek-, who were thiis
able to hold Dbomoko until nightfall,
when they retreated beiore Memiiuh
Pasha could circumvent them.
Considerable anxiety is caused here by
the. fact that large numOers of irregular
troops are swarming into the city and it
is impossible to disa r m them. A batch of
.: regulars wiio bad been serving in
itiirus seized a train mid compelled the
officials to convey them to this city.
Special constables and troops patrol the
streets day and night to RU&rd against
disorders, and the prism gua r ds h:\ve
been doub.'ed, lest an attempt be made to
release the prisoners.
Considerabft difficulty is being experi
enced in getting the Italian volunteers
who were in Epirus to embark for Italy,
as meny of them are deserters from the
Italian army.
Premier Ealli is quoted as saying that
he has received assurances that the condi
tions of peace will not be likely to hinder
Greece's progress and development. This
will lead to disappointment in certain
quarters, for it is accepted aa meaning
that there will be a restoration of the

The Presidential election took place in Cuba on Saturday last, but owing to the disturbed condition of affairs on the island
it may be some days before the result is known. There were four candidates in the fieldâ Salvador Cisneros, the present
President, who is desirous of re-eJection; Bartholomae Masso, Mendez Capote and EuaeDto Hernandez.
Before the election it was generally conceded that President Cisneros would be re-elected. He has the confidence of the
army and is looked upon as a calm, clear-beadei patriot. Masso is the present vice-president, Capote is now governor oi

stone cliffs line the greater part of the way, and a body of chosen men are always on
the lookout for ihe approach of an enemy, who can be descried miles away. The top
of the mountain offers an area of good arab'.e land of sufficient size to raise all the
food npeded by the occupants, and they are independent of outside supplies. Build

Here they were forced to work forty min

double steel doors. Then led by a masked

HAVANA, Cuba, May 23.â The sugges
tion that the American administration
should purchase ' Cuban independence
meets with the enthusiastic approval of
the business men here. Commissioner
Caihoun has received mucb information
about tue real state of affairs, and the
scheme of the purchase of Cuba has been
suggested to him as a good course for
McKinley to take. What business classes
in Cuba would prefer is the intervention
of the United States in a peaceful way,
establishing, until the whole amount of
indemnity is paid to Spain, a. kind of
American protectorate over the new re
public.
The correspondent of The Call has
just learned that the plan was also sug
gested, some months ago, to the Cleve
land administration by Consul-General*
Lee in a very important report, which
at the office of the Secretary of State in
vVashingtoD. The report has been kept
secret in "Washington. Statistics on
which the arguments are based were' pre

General by Â» prominent representative of

A letter from Washington received by a
rich merchant says Sherman and McKin
ley recently gave great attention to this
document. In it Lee points out that a
monetary indemnity is the best solution
for Spain herself. One of the reasons for
Spain's stubborn resistance to interven

tion is the enormous debt contracted in
Cuba since the war of 1868, and for which
Spam, in case Cuba becomes independent,
is 1 herself responsible. An indemnity
will solve, in a great part, this perplexing
problem. The debt, which amounts now
to over . $400,000,000, will not be such a
heavy burden upon Spain if $200,000,000 is
paid to the mother country by Cuba. It
should be remembered the actual price of
Spanish-Cuban bonus are very much be
low par, and the Spanish Government,
possessing $200,000,000, can easily make
an arrangement with shareholders. Be
sides the indemnity would relieve Spain
of a * much larger monetary sacrifice,
which a continuance of the war imposes
upon her.
Lee also gave figures to show the total
inability of the island to be a further
source of revenue lor Spain and the fact
that Spain must depend upon her own

tinue the war. Recent events have proved
the soundness of this prediction. With
regard to the question of national pride
and honor the report indicates also the
course for Spain would bo to accept an in
demnity and let the island go.
Calhoun has been informed that the
Cubans in srins are ready to enter upon
such negotiations, and further they are
absolute. y determined not to give up the
struggle without securing absolute in
dependence. The home rule scheme of
Cleveland and the reforms proclaimed by
Canovas are considered here nonsensical.
A great majority of the Americans in
distress in Cuba are foreigners and me
chanics who are employed on sugar plan
tations. The barbarous edict of Weyler
in ordering the country people to concen
trate in the towns drove them out of their
places with thousands of pacilicos who
are starving. Many Americans have
been slain also In massacres of non-com
batants ordered by Weyler.
In an engagement near Madruga,
Matanzas province, the insurgents under
General Castillo routed. a Spanish column
of SOO men, which left on the field rifty
nine killed and fifteen wounded. The in- I
surgents have hanged seven Spanish spies
near Batabano, Havana province.
In the hills of Arroyos, Santa Clara
province, General Ruiz has had an en
gagement lasting three hours with the in
surgents. The Spanish column retired,
leaving twelve- killed and nineteen
wounded.
General Lnque has refused to take com
mand of the Spanish forces in the
provinca of Santiaeo de Cuba. The rea
son given in a communication to General
Weyler was that he could not assume the
responsibility of commanding a province
.absolutely controlled by the insurgents-.
Should it be officially declared that the
Cubans hold Orient, then lie said he would
gladly go to the front and tight them.
Under the present circumstances he could
not risk his name ana accept the conse
quences of the existing power of General
Garcia.
This communication aroused the anger
of Weyler, who in answer ordered Luque
to go to Santiago de Cuba or leave for
Spain. Luque chose to leave the island
and embarked for the mother country.
General Jimenez Sandoval, who was
commander of the forces which killed
Jose Mprti at the beginning of tb? war,
has also left for Spain seriously wounded.
MADRID, Bpaiw, May 23.â A grave po

day. As a result the Liberal minority in
the Senate and Chamber of Representa

tired from the Cortes.
The Prime Minister, after consulting
the Queen Regent, summoned an extra
meet.ng of the Cabinet, which decided to
meet the Chamber and demand a vote of

She had got only half way when there
was a scream and a crash, followed by the
noise of a heavy body striking the pave
ment, and the sign toppled down, almost
carrying her with it. Mrs. Bowles had
jumped from the floor above to the ground,
where she was picked up and taken to the
hospital, unconscious and badly injured.
Mrs. Mosswav, who was th 9 first person
on the fourth floor to be aroused, instead
of savins herself and child, went around
awakening the other sleepers. There was
only one way of safety and that was
through the smoke and flames in the hall
up the scuttle ladder to the roof- There
was a wiid rush for this ladder. Miss Mc-
Donald cot half way up and was being
followed by Mrs. Mossway aud her child,
when one of the lodgers, whose name the
others refused to eive, pulled them off the
ladder and rushed up himself. Misjj Mc-
Donald climbed up after him.
Mrs. Mossway became bewildered and
took her chila back to her room. She
went to a little rear window and other
lodgers saw her break the glass of the
window with her bare hands. Outside of |
the window were stout iron bars four j
inches apart. Mrs. Mossway tried to |
force her baby through the bar<, but \
failed. Then she beat the bars with her
fists. Two men watched her helpless to j
eive aid and finally, overcome by the ;â¢
smoke, she fell back. When t:e nre was ;
over she was found on the floar. On the j
bed lay her daughter dead. Mrs. Moss- j
way was taken to a hospital, where she j
died as 8 o'clock.

TO PUSH THE TARIFF BILL.
Discuss. on Begins To-Morrcw in the Senate,
but Set Speeches Will Bd Dis
countenanced.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 23âDis
cussion on the tariff bill in the Senate will
begin Tuesday. Atter â  routine morning
business Senator Aldrich of Rhode
Island, in charge of the measure, will
make the opening speech, which will be
in the nature of a stateui- nt on behalf of
the sub-committee which revised the
Dingley bill, showing the effect of the
changes made and the reasons therefor.
He will also offer numerous amendments
to the bili, none of them, however, of any
great importance. Many are to correct
typographical errors in the reported bill,
while others are minor changes author
ized by the sub-committee.
The programme of the tariff managers
comtem plates longer working hours for
the Senate and that body will ba asked,
beginning next Thursday, to change its
hour of meeting to 11 o'clock instead of
noon. No demand will be made for night
sessions until some progress ha 3 been
made with the bill.
The Republican caucus to-morrow is
called for the purpose of mapping out a
pian of action on the tariff. The first
consideration, of course, is the passago of
the bill at. the earliest possible date. An
agreement of Republican Senators will be
sought so that there shall be no set
[ speeches on the tariff question and that
tiie discussion on the Republican side
shall be confined to short replies to tne
attacks of Democrat".

How Robinson, Formerly a
Newspaper Man, Met
His Death.
H. R. Freear's Perikus Expe
dition, With Bands of Wi:d
Animals in Sight
Discovery of EnornKU" Oyster Beds,
Strange Birds and D?er at the
Mouth of the Colorado.
"Though I have hunted for wild game
and birds of all kinds in many different
sections of this continent," said H. R.
Freear at the International yesterday, "I
have never seen a stranger place than the
j mouth of the Coloraio River, near the
island occupied by the Ceres Indians.
There the tides roll in and out thirty feet
high, and the mud is so desp for miles
eac i way that you can take a pole and
I run it down twenty feel and then uot find
bottom.
"This soft stuff is the red soil that comes
! down the Colorado so thick that at Yum a,
and other p aces the turgid flood seems
j half mud. Ii is a strange sight that is
! presented about the mouth of the river. I
went down there to hunt egrets the time
that L. L. Kobinson and three comjan
10ns wpre going on an adventurous trip to
j the Ceres Islands, in the Gulf of Califor
! nia. You remember that Robinson and
! one of his men were killed by the savage
I Indians that inhabit the island?. Well,
I I was towed down the -river to within
j twenty miles of the island by their boat,
! and probably came that near getting
I Killed myself.
"It has taken a good while for the story
j to come out, but little by little I got it
! from the Indians and from men along
! (here who hnd talked with them. The
; Indians on the island v.hen the men
I toucned there came to meet them, and
i right away protested their friendship.
j They showed the men a paper and said
the Indians were at peace now with the
white men; that they were their friends
' and by making this kind of a talk they
j hired Robinson and another cf the men
! about a quarter of a mile away in the
I c ice of the timber. The other two woul 1
have gor;e, but one of them, O'Brien, was
sick. He didn't teel !ikÂ« going, tis he ex
plained afterward, and the other man
sort of stayed around to look after him.
"Well, when the Indians hail got Robin
son and his companion lured a safe uis
tance away, and were without arras of
j any kind, a lot of the Indians gathered
i aronnd them and with their bows and
arrows shot them 10 death, it \va-< all
done in plain sight. I talked with O'Brien
j about it afterward. He said that while
ihe lay in the boat, and was gazing
j vacantly over on the hillside, suddenly
the Indians set up a yell, and then they
began attaching the men.
'"O'Brien and his companion under the
I circumstances could do nothing to aid the
j men, and. it being dangerous to remain
i near the shore, pa'idled away to a safe
distance, and eventually reached land on
the opposite sine from the island. They
bad a close call for their lives. It was by
the merest accident that they escaped,
and 1 may say Ihe same thing nbout my
| self. The real idea of the Robinson ex
pedition was to engage in smuggling.
"It was given out at the time that it was
for the purpose of gaining information for
a San Francisco morning paper, and Rob-
I inson no doubt expecte I to do a little writ
ing lor it, but the rea! business was to do
some contraband work. There were some
Chinese that were to pay $50 a head for be
ing brought across the border, and after
that there promised to be a lot of other
things to do. They wouid nrobibly have
made a lot of money, too, if the Indians
| had not killed the two men and broken up
! the expedition.
"Around the mouth of the Colorado, on
| the uplands, are great herds of antdope,
I and plenty of deor. There is no limit to
! this kind of game. There are a great
many oirds, too, of diftorent kinds, one of
the most valuable of which is the blue
I herron.
"It is a wonderful country there, too,
! for oysters, and, strange to say, it doesn't
I appear to be known that there are oysters
there. But the beds are found over an
enormous area. They are magnificent
oysters. I used to go out and get them
and with a knife cut them out of the
shell, and when I had got a lot of them
roll them in a little flour and, adding salt
and pepper, put thtm on ths camp fire
and fry them. They were the finest,
sweetest oysters I ever tasted. They are
like the littla California oysters that we
get here, only I think they had a finer
flavor. Getting them fresh there as I
used to of an enrlv morning they were
literally out of sisrht."

lia Estrella's Appreciation.
The members of La Eatrella Parlor, N. D. G.
W., are young ladies in whom the bump of ap
preciation is very largely developed and they
never neglect to show their appreciation. Last
Saturday night they gave substantial proof of
their admiration of what Miss Ueien Kruse
had done for the parlor.
Ab has already teen noted in this depart
ment Miss Kruse donated, a few weeks since,
a magnificent silk American flag, which she
had made ail by band, devoting many months
in the accomplishment of the work of patriot
ism and fraternal love for the members of her
parlor, of which she is an ufficer. The mem
bers of La Estrella, conscious 01 the fact that
they are possessed ot the most handsome flag
in the order, and pardon-<b y proud of it, they
decided to present Miss Kruse a token of their
esteem of her, something she could always
have in remembrance of the presentation of
ihe flag. On Saturday evening when Miss
Kruse entered Sierra Hail in the Native Sons'
building, in which the parlor meets. Â»he was
astonished to find her station bedecked with
beautiful flowers, and when she asked "Why
is this thus?" none of her fellow members
wouid tell her.
At the close of the session she was called be
fore the altar and was addressed by Mrs. Lil
linn Carlie, past president of the parior, a lady
who is gifted with unusual elocutionary pow
ers and a most wonderful command of lang
uage. Her remarks were of the patriotic
order, soul stirring, and at the close she said
that every member of the parlor loving the
beautiful flng that had been mude for Li Es
trella wishea the maker to accept lrom them
a token ol their appreciation, and with that
she handed Miss Kruse a magnificent star,
pendant from v gold neeklfice. The recipient
responded in a few touching words, after
which the members of the parior sang the
"Star-apuugled Banner" with a vim.
Captuin Irelan, who was the drill-masier of
! the drill corps of the par. or that made such a
j fine display on the nigiit of the flag presenta
tion, made a saort address complimenting
the youug ladies of the corps for having in six
lessons learned more than many others had
I learned in fifty. Then icecream ana cakes
were served and there wns dancing.
Then- were but tew visitors at tao presenta
tion, it being a sort ot a family Rttair. The
oniy ones outs. d'j of the members were Mrs.
Maiy E. Tillnian, grand president; Mrs. J. A.
Kteinbach, district deputy; Mrs. George W.
Powell aiid Mrs. N. Napier of Veritas Parlor of
Merced and Captain Irelan.
The str.r symbolic oi the parlor is a gold one,
iniheeente- of which there is a blue field,
and In Hie middle of that a diamond. On
each of the five points of the star is a ruby,
while between the points appear the points of
a subordinate star, each tipped with a small
diamond. The chain is madu up ol links
equal in number to the member&nio of the
parlor.
The Grand Parlor, N. D. G. W.
There is a great deal of bustle in the town of
Sonora getting ready for the reception ana
entertainment of the delegates to the Grand
Parlor ot the Native Daughters of the Golden
\\ est, that will be in seesion for four dsys,
ending Friday, June 11. It is expected that
in addition to the delegates therw will be a
large number of visitors. A very line pro
gramme has been arranged for the entertain
ment of the Native Daughters. The fund for
the entertainment of the delegates has been
placed in the careo; Dardanelie Parlor.
It has reached $15, and it is expected that
before the opening of the Grand Parlor the
sum will have been increased by $500. On
the night of the 11th of June the members ot
Tuolumne Parlor, Native Sons o! the Golden
West, wi;l give a grand bali in honor of lha
visiting delegates, and the statement is made
that it wiJ be the most elaborate affair of the
kind that has ever beÂ»n givon in Sonora.
Dardanelie Farlur, N. D. G. W.
The minstrel entertainment recently given
by the members of Dardanelie Parlor in So
nora was such a great success thar the young
ladies were prevailed upon to repeat it, and
with a changed prosramme it was as success
ful as the preceding oae. Other parts of
Tuolumne County being desirous of nearinu
the fair maids from Sonora, 'hey have decided
to give a performance in the Grand Opera
house in Sient, in that county.

Sabbath Sermons and Discussions
In the Conference at Pacific
Grove.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 23.â The
third day of the convention of Pacific
Coast students opened rather mauspl
ciouslv.so far as tha weather wns concerned.
It was cold and a heavy fog obscured
the sun the early port ; on of the day. Later
the brichtnejs and life of the enthusiastic
colJege men seemed to have been infused
with the atmosphere, and the sun dissi
pated the fog into a beautiful golden mist
eventually driving it away entirely. A
large nuiuberof delegates arrived on last
evening's train, so the representation from
the various colleges is much larger than
was anticipated.
The Bible class this morning was under
the direction of Robert E. Lewis of Chi
cago, and was ably taught by him. His
subject was "The Analysis of the Tempta
tions of Chris!." Mr. Lewis brought these
temptations down to everyday life, and
made them fit with the experience, past,
present and future of all of his hearers.
The general Bummaryvpf his lecture he
made under two heads:' First, Jesus mot
and conquered temptation as the son of
man and not in his divine capacity, thus
bringing himself much nearer humanity
and its needs. Along this line he quoted
Canon Farrar as havine said that "a
divine impulse led Christ to seek his hour
of peril alone," and so secondly earned
the power to teach and lead.
L. P. Willie, the leader of the confer
ence city association delegate and the pre
siding officer of the convention, opened
the platform meeting in the Epworth
League Jecture room with a very affec
tive choral hymn which he led. The de
votional exercises were led by him and
then Robert E. Lewis delivered the ad
dress of the day on the subject "Our Fel
lowship With Christ." The strong point
of his discourse was our propensity to live
a selfish life, rather than to become fel
lows with Je>us Christ. In the second
division of His sermon he showed that,
having put away seili-h things, we earned
a right to claim a companionship with
Christ upon terms of perfect and abso
lute equality. In all his lectures Mr.
Lewis exercises most marked ability to
draw vivid word pictures, and his knowl
edge of the Holy Land and the history of
the time of Christ is unusually complete.
Noel H. Jacks, general secretary of the
Oakland Youne Men's Christian Associa
tion, delivered the sermon to the as
sembled delegates in the main auditorium
of the Methodist Episcopal Church at 11
o'clock. Besides the students there was
a large congregation of citizens of Pacific
Grove and Monterey. His subject, "Rest
Found in Christ," the text b(*ing taken
from Matthew xi: 28, "Come unto me all
ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
vrilKQir* *cv Â«st." * Â : - j
Mr. JacKs spoke el the personal care and
watchfulness of God for human creatures,
as taught by the Bible, and as contra
dicted by those who scoffed to. be fashion
able, and who claimed that God was the
person lion of "1 don't care." The for-
Idrnnessof humanity, he said, would bede
plorable were such things so. The world's
great characteristic of t c present day was
a most complete unrest, and he cited as
evidence of its need of rest the wars, riots
and general turmoil ami bloodshed.
He clinched this point with Napoleon's
words: "CjE3ar and I founded mighty
empires which did not endure because
dei ending solely upon force. Bin Christ
founded an empire upon love which shall
endure for ail time."
At 2 o'clock C. C. Michener addressed
the delegates at an informal meeting, tak
ing for his theme "Prayer," and ta king
in a practical man-to-man fashion, which
was preatiy appreciated by the students.
A feature of his ta!k wa3 the proof by
historical facts of the efficacy of prayer.
He quoted Motley in his Mistory of the
Dutch Republic regarding the beleaguered
Huguenots in the city of Liege, who were
starving and prayed for deliverance. It
came in the shape of a plentiful rain,
which cleared t c city of fever and pesti
lence and made ii possible for them to live
until aid came to them from without.
Several instances ol Old Testament his
tory were also brought forward.
At the end o! Mr. Michener's talk F. L.
Willis sang 'bavior, 1 Follow On,' ana
this closed the session.
The open-air Use class assembled a ball
hour earlier this evening and the sun was
just over the pine tree tops when the
opening song began. F. L. Willis, who
has charge of the city delegations of the
convention, conducted this evening's
clas*. He very appropriately took as his
subject "The Call of College-Bred Men to
Christian Callings." He dwell upon the
point that whether a man's calling be
religious or secular he snouid none the
less live for the good of his leiJows, as <tid
Athanasius and Stvonarola of old. The
college man was not !eft free to make his
independent choice, li 9 said, for each was
the beneficiary of his college to some ex
tent and dis preferences were influenced
by this fact.
The platform meeting In the church
auditorium was very largely attenued.
Short devotional exerciser began the ser
v.ce and addre = se.' followed.

LOCKEFORD FARMS FLOODED.
Levees Along the tfckeJumne Break anil
Water Pours Over a Great Many
Ranches.
STOCKTON, Cal., May -23.â Constable
Charles Dial of Lockeford telephoned to
this city this afternoon that the levees
along the Mokelumne River had broken
and that the farms in the vicinity of
Lockeford would be damaged to the ex
tent cf at least $10,000. The country about
is now under water, and the damage may
exceed the sum named.
The cause of the breaks is not known.
The first one occurred on William Eas
ton's place. This was followed by an
other on the Whitney ranch, and shortly
after this the levees on the Ksrr place
broke, letting the waters in upon the
country about Lockeford. That section is
very fertile and has hundreds of acres
planted in grain and potatoes. Besides
the ranches of Dr. Locke and Luther
Locke, those on the Montgomery Tract
and the Holman place are now under
water, and the flood is fast spreading.
There must have been teavy showers in
the mountains to swell the waters to the
extent they did. Just now the entire
country about Lockeford is under water.
TALKS TO STAFFORD GRADUATES.
Dr. McLean of Oak.and Dehversthe Bffcca
/aureate Sermon at falo
A/tc.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
23 âDr. McLean of Oakland delivered the
baccalaureate sermon in the chapel this
morning. The graduates attended chapel
in a body. In spite of the fact that a large
number of the undergraduates had
already departed for their summer vaca
tion, the chapel was filled to overflowing.
Dr. McLean found his text in Isaiah
lix:l6-17. In substance he said:
Mv errand hero to-day is not to deliver a
traditional oaccalaureate sermon, but to give
you a simpie and unambitious message. It
has been derived from experience. 1 have
during the past thirty-nine years been brought
into contact with young people. I wish most
heartily that time had slipped ft cog thirty
nine years ago and left me io graduate witn
you next Wednesday.
My message could be callea "Tho Noble
Army of Intercessors." Intercessors here is to be
tateu in its strongest senseâ those who inter
pose. Who and wnnt manner of a man is an
intercessor? What are his opportunities aud
VThat calls him he:e?
To the first question from the text we read,
"He saw mere no man." God wondered that
in the presence of such conditions there was
no real man. Of course there was the rabble,
which looted on existing evil, but no one
attempted to eradicate it. There was none
who dared to interpose or break forth in
righteous indignation at prevailing condi
tions, such a man is his ideal of a. completed
human being. Tne chapter pictures the strife
between good and evil. This strife will con
tinue until good prevails.
As to the intercessor's place In history we
find that he is the maker of all history. The
great army of intercessors includes all those
patriots who have not counted their lives
dearer than their piinciplei. There is abun
dant opportunity for sucti patriots to-day. Ttie
wrongs Cuba and Crete are allowed to suffer
show that nations can look on cruelties as of
old with sordid indifference.
Dr. McLsan then; advised the graduates
to make the most of tneir abundant op
portunities. They must dare to do if they
wi&hed to be enrolled in the "grand army
ol intercessors."
ALASKA V BOUNDARY DISPUTE.
Government Commission En Route North
ward to Make Another
Survey.
SEATTLE. Wash., May 23â H. G.
Bryan of Philadelphia, E. , B. Latham of
Washington, D. 0., acd S. J. Entrikin of
Westchester, Pa., constituting a Govern
ment commission, arrived in Seattle to
day from the East, en route to Alaska,
whither the party goes to make prelimi
nary suiveys and study the general to
pography of the country as an auxiliary
to the regular survey corps and commis
sion to pa appointed to act for the United
Slates, in conjunction with a British com
mission, to determine the exact route of
the international boundary between
Alaska and Canada. They will begin op
erations at Mount St. Elias and prosecute
the work until the latter part of Sep
tember. '
Mr. Bryant, who is at the bead of the
expedition, stated that its work would be
purely of a preliminary character, and
the data and information collected would
be used for the better guidance of the per
manent 1 boundary commission. He has
had much experience in this line of work,
and he will be remembered as the leader
of the Lieutenant Peary auxiliary expedi
tion sent out by the Federal Government
in 1894 to rescue the intrepid Arctic ex
plorer. , ; ;
While Bryant is in Alaska he expects to [j
settle the disputed question as to whether
Mount Logan is higher than Mount St,
Ellas and is the loftiest summit in North
America. The ascent of Mount 'S. Elias

BURIED DOUBLOONS
IN YAQUINA SANDS
Search for a Pirates'
Cache on the Ocean
Beach.
Treasure Hidden by Rovers
Before the War of the
Rebellion.
Tale of an Old Settler Who Was
Held a Prisoner on Their
Craft.
YAQUINA, Wash., May 23.â There is
an old tradition, grounded upon fact, that
many years ago, before the rebellion,
pirates buried several boxes of cold
doubloons in the mud alons: the beach
here. They never returned and the pre
sumption is that they were lost at sea.
John Hardman, now 73 years old, was
about the only dweller along the beach at
that time, and he says that he baa good
reason to remember the arrival of the
pirates. There were a dozen in all, most
of them Americans. Three of them took
him aboard their craft and there detained
him for two days. By chance he learned
that they were unloading some gold and
secreting it.
After their departure Hardman sought
for the gold, off and on, for years, but
failed to find it. In the fall of 1878 a
stranger came from Calilornia.
Bsfore he lÂ«ft he changed several doub
loons. One night, while drunk, he said
there was a half million of that kind of
gold not far from the beach and he wouid
return some day to dig it up. This man,
evidently, was one of the pirate?. He
diert in California not long ago.
William Rich of Toledo got hold of a
description of the hiding place and has
been making a search tor the treasure.
He believes that he is now about to dis
cover the gold, having found several of
the marks, bearings and trees mentioned
in the description.

Birmingham' a Fruit Ranch Invaded by
a Swarm nf the l'e*ta.
FRESNO, Cal., May 23.â W. R. Bir
mingham, formerly a capitalist of Oak
land, but now an extensive fruit-grower
of the San Joaquin bottom near i'o.laiky,
in this county, suffered seriously last
week from an invasion of grasshoppers in
his orchards. The hoppers came down
from the hills and traveled until they
reached Birmingham's place. There they
stopped and began feasting, and they are
still eating the tree foliage. The damage
will probably amount to several thousand
dollars.
This is the first report this season of
depredations by grasshoppers, and the
appearance of the pest is of course causing
some alarm. Those in the orchard in he
river bottom are not sufficient in number
to do any widespread damage, and as far
as can be learned no other swarms have
been seen.

NOXIOUS VAPORS
KILLED CAVILL
The Noted Swimmer a
Victim of His Own
Deception.
Gas Had Filled a Submerged
Pan Which Supplied
Him With Air.
Coroner's Inquest Exposes the
Sham Practiced In His
Feats Under Water.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 23.â An inquest
was helu to-day over the body of Charles
CaviU, the famous swimmer, who was
drowned last night in the Jackson
baths. The evidence presented to the
Coroner's jury made clear the methods
by which Cavill had for years deceived
the public and established "records" for
staying under water lor extended period-.
A verdict of accidental death by asphyxia
tion was rendered.
The apparatus used by Cavill in his de
ception consisted of a large zinc pan tied
with ropes to a heavy marble 3lab, which
is sunk to the bottom of the tank. The
pan keep 3 the air beneath it to the ex
clusion of water in ordinary waters, but
those at Jackson's baths come from the
natural gap. wells and aie impregnated
with pas. The gas accumulated beneath
the inverted pan to the exclusion of the
air last night, and the moment the Aus
tralian tilled ms lungs with tne noxious
vapors he was rendered unconscious. His
fellow-swimmers did not realize the cause
of his death until this morning, when the
slab and pan were brought to the surface.
In ordinary waters the swimmer would
not have been in any danger.
Nearly 1000 people gathered to-night at
Jackson's Baths to attend the benefit
given for the widow of Cavill. Mrs. Cavill
arrived from San Francisco to-night and is
quartered at the Southern Hotel. Gay and
Kaiin nave a very good exhibition to please
the crowd. On Wednesday night there
will be another benefit, in wiiich local
swimmers will appear, and a vaudeville
entertainment will be presented. The
Stockton people have taken up the caus 1
of the widow and will respond iiberailv,
as Mrs. Cavill is destitute. George Milne,
who was Cavill's manager, will probably
arrange for a benefit at Sutro Baths in San
Francisco. Cavill will be buried in
Stockton.

FRESNO, Cal., May 23.â The Demo

notion of Cnairman W. H. Alford of the

Bryan's itinerary in California. AJford
has provided that the ex-candidate for

which is in his home county. This is
pointed to as a selfish act on the cbair

favor. It is argued that Fresno, being
the largest city in the valley, should en
joy a visit from the distinguished Ne

According to the itinerary mapped out

This week the Senate tackles the tariff
It is said the Democrats in the "Senate
will fight the duty on beer and let the
rest go. . .
They have begun to call it the Aldrich-
Jones bill, and Mr. Dingley is not saying
a word.
The war has at least taught Greece the
difference between a general and a crown
prince, and the lesson was worth learn
ing. ____^___
Senator Aldrlch will soon rise and ex
plain the sugar duty and then the fellows
who have been making estimates will go
and hide their heads.
The first thing for the Western Senators
to do in the tariff fight is to knock off the
duty on tea and provide for an increase
in the revenue by an increase of duty on
wine and dried fruits.
It is said the Spanish army in Cuba has
received no pay in five months, and as it
has won no elory it would not be surpris
ing if the soldiers should start off some
fine day 10 imitate the Cubans and strike
for liberty.

It is reported to be the opinion of men
in Wall street that a month's imprison
ment will be worth $100,000 to Chapman,
and if this is so it might be worth while
to keep him there so as to make him rich
enough to scorn the sugar trust and tell
the truth.

The motor vehicles which have been
tested in th 3 East while satisfactory in
many respects are said to be extremely
noisy, and if no remedy can bo found for
that defect they will hardly be hailed as
a blessing. Civilization has too many
noises already.
Â»
The expenditures of Spain in Cuba for
the coming year are estimated at $131,
--000,000, and the revenues at $30,000,000.
It is therefore a losing game beyond hope
of redemption. Even the conquest of the
island would hardly make up for such a
loss of money to a people who can so ill
afford it as the over-taxed Spanish peas
ants.
The Toronto Globe asserts that United
States lumber companies own about 4235
square miles of forest in the province of
Ontario and export most of the lumber to
this country, and perhaps that is the rea
son why there is so much opposition in
some quarters of the East to the establish
ment of a wholesome protective duty on
lumber.
The Australian federation movement
seems to have struck a suag in the un
willingness of the province of West Au
stralia to join in. If the others go ahead,
however, the laggard will probably get ;
into the procession - before long. There
will hardly be much satisfaction for one
colony to flock off by itself in that corner
of the world.
Edison is quoted as having said recently:
"1 believe it is possible to present grand
opera in all the perfection of its detail
with nothing more than a big sheet, a lot
of phonographs and a kineioscope ma
chine." This being true it is evident that
Patti's farewell tour will sooner or later
become an accomplished fact. She will
be out of date.
The assertion that the Senate Finance
Committee made a thousand changes in
the Dingley bill has been contradicted by
the New Yoru Tribune correspondent, who
has probably counted them, and who says
they do not exceed 800. All the same the
bill na3 been disfigured and would smell
jmt as sweet under another name tnan
that of Dingley.
The assertion that the Turk is upheld
by th 6 bondholders of Europe, or that his
empire exists only by the support of Eng
land or Russia may still serve to make a
Rood point on occasion, but the fact re
mains that he has just given the world
pretty cood proof that some of his
strength is due to his Bashi-BaiDuk

right hand.
The British Government has never
looked favorably upon the project of con
necting England with France by means of
a tunnel under the channel, but it is said
to be now considering a similar enterprise
lor joining Scotland with Ireland. A
feasible route for the tunnel has been
marked out and it is estimated the work
would cost $35,000,000 and would pay good
dividends on the investment.
The latest story of the Kaiser is that
when he was a boy he was always specu
lating upon the advantage it would be to
him if Germany and France could unite
and destroy "the modern Carthage," as
he called England; and it is said he con
tinues to speculate on the subject yon to
this day. It is added that on the destruc
tion of the empire he would be willing to
let France have -Esypt and .India; pro
vided he were allowed to take the British
throne and annex the islands to Germany.
It is not likely that there " is ? much truth
in such stories,- but the fact that they are
told shows that the Kaiser ia regarded as
â¢lightly 'crazy. â 'â â â¢â¢' '-.-.'
THE TAEIFF DEBATE.
The tariff debate which is to begin in
the Senate this week will bÂ« the closing
battle of a controversy which has encaced
the attention of the country for ten years,
was the chief issue of two Presidential
campaigns and in a third was of equal im
portance with the money question. Dur
ing that time It has seriously disturbed
trade and industry, confused the public
mind to such an extent that the people
voted first for protection, then for free
trade, and after a disastrous experience
with that system returned to protection
and elected to the Presidency the man
whose name is more closely identified
with the protective system than that of
any other living American statesman.
The closing debate on & subject which
has so long involved the politics of the
Nation, and over which statesmen have
foueht so earnestly on both sides, micht
fairly be expected to be one of the greatest
in our history. In this case, however, it
will be the unexpected that happens.
Neither the Senate nor the country is in
the humor for a grand discussion or a
hard-fought struggle. The issue has been
worn threadbare, and the main desire of
all is to settle it and go forward to other
things.
If at any stage of the discussion s da
bate should arise, the advantage will be
altogether on the side o! the Republicans.
They have such tariff experts as Allison,
Aldricn, Hale, Frye, Burrows, Quay and
Platt of Connecticut to lead them, and
thess are supported by such vigorous
young Senators as Foraker, Thurston,
Mason, Fairbanks and Wilson. The Dem
ocratic ranks in the Senate, on the other
hand, have lost some of their strongest
men. They have no longer the leaders
who directed them when the combat be
gan or even when the battle was fought
over the Wilson bill. BlacKburn, Car
lisle, Colquitt, Hill, Voorhees and Vance
will be missed if a great debate should
spring up, and there are no young men of
force to take their places.
Unless all signs fail the last struggle of
the great controversy will be a tedious
and uninteresting wrangle rather than a
debate. It is known that the outcome is
to be a protective tariff, and that the peo
ple will not reopen the issue in another
campaign. The discussion, therefore,
will be over details of rates and schedules
rather than over economic principles, and
there will be no occasion for fervid ora
tory unless it be from some Senator who
may feel it necessary to talk for bun
combe by way of making himself con
spicuous for a day.
It is in tact a business issue that is now
before the Senate. Toe people have de
cided finally for protection, and the one
question is how to make protection most
comprehensive and thorough. We have
in California interests which are antag
onized by strong elements In the East,
and oar interest in the debate lies in that
fact. The bill will certainly De a compro
mise measure in the end, ana we must
sen to it that the compromise doas not in
volve a sacrifice of the West.
THE WRITING ON THE WALL.
According to the returns of the Bureau
ot Statistics at Washington, the excess of
exports of merchandise over imports dur
ing 1896 amounted to the enormous sum
of $325,322,000. In other words, t'.ie Amer
ican people last year sold $325,322,000
worth of goods more than they bought.
This is a record-breaker. The year that
came nearest to 1896 in this respect was
1873, when the excess of exports over im
ports was $305,275,000. A significant fact
in this connection is that that same year
â 1878 â in which the exports preponder
ated so largely over the imports marked
the beginning of a season of prosperity,
hence statisticians argue, with much
plausibility, that the same conditions now
indicate the eve of a similar season of
prosperous times.
The commercial history of the United
States has been a history of alternate
waves of depression and prosperity. They
recur with unvarying uniformity, nor is
there much difference in the duration of
each period. Blainein his work, "Twenty
Years in Congress," charged these fickle
conditions to tariff changes. He con
clusively showed that whenever the Dem
ocrats secured control of the Government
a low tarilt imm3diately followed and a
panic inevitably followed tne low tariff.
The panic caused the overthrow of the
Democratic party, whereupon the Whigs,
and later the Republicans, rode into
power, restored the tariff, anl prosperity
immediately ensued. This has been the
commercial record of the United States.
It has never been disputed, for it is cold
history, as distinctly marked as wars and
Presidential successions.
T.his being the case, we are evidently
entering upon a season of renewed pros
perity. Unless the Senate so emasculates
the tariff bill that its efficiency is destroyed
the next three or four years ought to be a
period of good times. And the indications
will probably be realized. It pleases the
business clas* all over the country to be
lieve so at any rate, and the business class
is never very far wrong where its cash box
is concerned.
So much for the condition of the coun
try at large. On this coast trade condi
tions have not materially changed during
the week. The crop outlook is now pretty
well defined. We know just about how
we stand. We knotf that the grain crop
will be under the average and feel toler
ably certain that all cereals will bring at
least fair prices. We aro also equally sure
that the fruit crop will not bÂ« excessive',
and indications for fair prices are as good
as those for grain. The grape crop looki
better than any other, as weather con
ditions have thus far not affected it, and
chances are promising for reasonable
prices for wine, thouch this condition 1b
not as sharply denned a3 the two others.
On the whole, acalm survey of the situa
tion leads the commercial analyst to ex
pact a good year in California.
BIMETALLISM IN ENGLAND.
The London National Review for May,
in commenting upon the appointment of
a United States commission to negotiate
an international settlement of the mone
tary question, commends President Me-
Kinley for his promptness in carrying out
the pledge of the St. Louis platiorra to
promote bimetallism by international
agreement, and advances reasons for be
lieving the commission will find cordial
support in Europe and even in England,
which has always been considered the
main defender of the gold standard.
The Review says that Senator Wolcott,
on his preliminary visit to Europe, saw all
the chief statesmen of Great Britain,
France and Germany and learned tnat a
considerable change had come over the
sentiment of Europe oa this question.
"With characteristic sagacity, " it says,
"i;e allowed absurd reports of his rebuilt
to go uucontradicted and great was the
reioicinz of the New York goldbugsand
proportionate was the confidence and re
spect hÂ« inspired in British and European
statesmen by his easy indifiarence to
gossip and misrepresentation.''
As evidences favorable to the work of
the commission, the Review quotes a state
ment of Sir Michael Hicits-Beach, Chan
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 24, 1897.
cellor of the Exchequer, who is the only
monotnetallist in the present Cabinet, as
saving: "We (the British Government)
are willingâ we ajo anxious, seeing that
there are evils in the present low value of
silver and in the fluctuations in the pres
ent value of the two metalsâ to enter into
a conference or into negotiations with
other countries on the snbjjct." The
Review ndds that the abler editors of Lon
don are beginning to realize the niofound
importance of the question and that now
the only papers of note in that city which
continue to denounce bimetallism are the
Time* and Mr. Astor's paper, the Pall Mall
Gazette.
A stricking illustration of the growth of
sentiment in favor of bimetallism in Eng
land was shown at a recent meeting of the
National Agricultural Union, at which it
was unanimously decided to include in
the parliamentary programme of the
agriculturists "the establishment by in
ternational agreement of a stable mone
tary par of exchange between jrold and
silver." The union as the Review points
out, is far the most important agricul
tural organization in England. It has
active branches all over the country and
the action of the ruling council in adopt
ing bimetallism confirms belief in the
rapid development of free silver senti
ment among the farmers of Great Britain.
It wiil be seen that the outlook for in
ternational agreement in favor of the free
coinage of silver is by no means so forlorn
as the extremists of both sides would have
us believe. The iarmers of Europe recog
nize the injury that has been done to
them, as well as to the farmers of Amer
ica, by tne establishment of the sincle
gold standard, and when the international
conference meets the bimetallism will
have no lack of supporters in Europe any
more than in the United States.
OSTEICH PAEMING.
We learn from the Los AngeleÃ papers
that last month the heaviest consignment
of ostrich plumes ever sent from Califor
nia was shipped to Paris. This is coupled
with the report that the industry lias
completely passed beyond the experi
mental stage and -is pot only profitable
but likely to increase. There is a prospect
that from $50,000 to $70,000 will be added
during the coming year to the $200,000
already invested In this business of sup
plying fashion with fine feathers.
lhe ostrich ranches being successfully
conducted at Faiadena, Anaheim, Fall
brook, Santa Monica, Coronado and Po
mona havo made sales this season aggre
gating $190,000. The profits o^ these ven
tures were for a long time in considerable
doubt, but now it is known that so long
as the ladies continue to delight in plumes
the industry is an assured success.
There is no great danger of the market
being flooded with feathers, for the cost
of starting an ostrich farm in any effective
way at all is about $15,000, and a thor
oughly equipped one requires an outlay
of $25,000 to $39.0'J0. This large invest
ment and t::e care and time necessary to
ob.nin good results will deter any disas
trous rush of capital to cum pule in the
work.
Tue prosperity of this growing business
is not only pleasing in itself but has a
suggestive leature which enhances its
value. It makes clear the fact thai there
are always splendid possibilities of intro
dueiiys; enterprises In California that will
afford siew uses for capital and industry
and thm widen the extent of (he State's
resources. Varied industries constitute a
safer base for prosperity than restriction
to a few, however profitable, and the
lesson of the ostrich farms teaches the
advisability of making still othsr experi
ments in the way of adding to our pro
ductive occupations.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
Ammlraglio di St. Bon, turret-ship of 9800
tons, was launched April 29 at the Venice
dockyard. She was laid down early in 1894.
It was rumored last month that one of the
British trans Atlantic steamship companies
were favorably considering the scheme of
building a steamer of 5000 tons to be driven
by steam turbines.
Nickel steel ii likely to displace the ordinary
mild carbon steel in many parts of ships and
marine engine*. The Japanese hare promptly
adopted" this material in the ships under.; con
siructlon and are using nickel steel for armor,
crank propeller shafts, connecting rods and
other forging*.
The remarkable success of the Turbian a
may lead to a new departure in marine pro
puliion. The little boat of 42 tons displace
ment ana 100 feet in length maae a speed
over the measured mile, April 10, of 32JÂ£
knots, the highest ever made br any vessel.
The machinery at 2000 revolutions gave 72
horsepower per ton weight and there were no
vibrations whatever.
An accident to the Star occurred at the
Portsmouth dockyard April 29. very similar
to that which befell the American torpedo
boat Ericsson about two year* ago. The Star
was going out on her second trial, and efforts
were made to keep the coal consumption
within the limits of the contract. Shortly
after getting under way the starboard low
pressure cylinder-head burnt, and although
steam was promptly shut off, five men were
badly scalded about the head and arms, but
none are expected to dio from the injuries.
One of the advantages of the water-tube
boilers fitte t in the Powerful and Terrible is
the great reduction in weight as compared
with the Scotch boilers placed in the latest
thre? battle-ships. The water tube boilers
weighed 1162 tons and developed 25,000
horsepower, giving 21.51 horsepower per ton
of boilers with water. In the battle-ships
the boilers weighed 726.51 tons and gave 10,
--000 horsepower under natural draught,
which was at the rate of 13.7(5 horsepower per
ton of boilers. The water-tube boilers thus
showed an advantage of 50 per cent over the
Scotch type.
The Andromeda, wood-sheathed and copperei
cruiser ot 11,000 tons displacement, was
launched April 31 at Pembroke. She was be
gun December 2, 1895, and was thus only sev
enteen months on tue stocks. It is claimed
for her that she will cost 5 per cent less than
her sister snip, the Spartiate, owing largely to
the economical and time-saving methods in
troduced by the constructor in charge. It has
hitherto been the practice to make wooden
molds of every frame, but. this system has in
this Case been abandoned, and the ironwork
ers take the shape ol the frame by bending a
bar of iron along the lines In the body plan as
laid down on the service-board.
Blunders in the British admiralty are kept
pretty quiet and are rarely discussed in the
press to theÃamo extent as in this country
when something goes amiss with a ship. The
fitting out of the Thames, a second-class pro
tected cruiser of 4.050 tons, for service in the
coming maneuvers, coupled with the fact that
it is the first service of that ship since she was
built twelve years ago, recalls an incidentof
a gross blunder. The Forth, Mersey, Severn
and Thames were built dur'iug the years
1883-89 and were originally intended to have
a displacement of 35.30 tons on a mean
draught of 17 feet 9 inches. Tholr average
time of construction extended over a period
of six years ana when finally completed their
tlisplacem3nt was 4050 tons or 500 tons more
ihan intended, although the normal coal sup
ply had been reduced from 750 to 720 ton
and their draught was increased about 20
inches. Their actual speed never exceeded 17
knots. The United States shies San Francisco
and Newark were built somewhat on the gen
eral plans of these Britisn sbipi, but gave far
better results in that they did not exceed
their intended draught and tholr speeds ex
ceeded by two knots their types in the Britisn
navy.

PRESITENi JuRLAN AND STATE
EMPLOYMENT.
To the Editor rf the San Fi ancitco Callâ Sir:
It is certainly safe io assume that intelligent
readers of The Call fully realize tnat the
wliolo '.rend oi thought in this country and
Europe sets strongly toward a material in
crease in the dnties of the State end the mu
nicipality with reference to the welfare of the
citizen, more especially since strong corpora
tions and trusts of aggregated .wealth and
superior business ability practically render
indivniuiiJs of ordinary means and average
ability almost wholly powerless in the open
field ol competitor* with iheso vast corporate
and trust resources arrayed against them.
There can be but one view of this matter.
It was a full recofjniiion of these conditions,
with a clear understanding cf their signifi
cance, wnich led President Jordan 01 Stanford
University in addressing the Pure Food Con
gress to ridicule the enactment oi i he laws
a-kod for by the unemployed, to oppose all
effort to find work for ifcem and to bluntly
limit the duty of tne State to providing police
men, judges and jails.
Oi course, this is carrying individualism and
its inevitable competition to their full and
foir logical result's. When I left the farm at
17, near Joliet. 111., where I was born heir to
all the disadvantages afforded a pioneer's
son, m.re ihan half a century ago, I had
learned to rear sheep, shear their wool, card
it by hand, spin it, weave it and dye the cloth
a beautiful butternut brown, and my mother
made my clothes of it. We cannot now co
back to the free competition of those times.
"Uncle Sam" is not "rich enough togive us
all a farm" now, though he was flity years
ago, for our "big brothers'' of the Miller <fc
Lux ability to grab the land, and our fool laws
which allow them and our rich Knglish
cousins across the Atlantic to acquire title to
it, never seem to worry because so many are
poor and have no land, nor home, nor work.
nor bread, and our dear old Uncle S*m is bad
ly in debt, has to borrow money himself, and
he has no time to think of us now or try io
find out some way in which he could lend R
n&nd and licj> us, tnough he used to be aft
kinii n.Â« cou.d be as long as he had any land
to g.ve us, and in those days no one had to
look for work and not find a thing to do, and
the bad word "tramp" was not made at that
time, but came into use when all the land was
gone and there was no work to be found.
These conditions are perilous. Ominous ex
ecraUons disturb the air. Hungry men clamor
lor employment, despite President Jordan's
counsel, for brend they must have lor their
titt.e ones and wires, in this juncture homes
are promised to about a tnousnnd men and
their families by one of our millionnires who
has both brains and a lican. I believe that
thousands of men all over our land will thank
God witu fervent hearts for the example of
Claus Spreckels and will invoke theiavorof
God to attend him in providing homes for
other homeless ones and bread for the hungry.
True, he helps himself whiie he helps oihers.
And this is wise. Why cannot other million
aires do the same? It will pay. A beggar's
blessing is better than a begear'b curÂ»e.
Tne way Is now prepared for a consiaeration
of the duty of the State and the municipality
to the unemployed, and I hope to show Presi
dent Jordan and the men for whom he speaks
that there ii a better and a safer way than to
dismiss the hungry men with loved one* in
distress to hunt lor work where ail know there
ii no work for them to find.

A NOVEL LAUNCH
HOW THE SUBMARINE TOKI-EDO-BOAT HOLLAND
Left tiie Ways.
The launch of the submarine ship-destroyer
Holland at Elizabethport. K. J., last week
was in some respects unlike any launch that
ever took place. The vessel slid into the
water on two greased ways, as is the custom.
This craft is ovoid in form, with the exception
of a small flat superstructura. and it was
necessary to send it into tbe WHter in a cradle
reaching well up the sides and holding the
boat rigid, so that it should not roll over on
the journey down the ways. This cradle was
fastened to tho sliding ways. The ends ot the
narrow cross-beams of the cradle were held
fast br stoct rcpi-s which were tied to supports
on the rop of t no boat. There was no anchor
I to be dropped as toe boat refiched tne water,
j but a long towline was streiched from the
j stern to a. tug to that the boat should not gel
beyond control In the water.
TheHoliaud has a heavy blunt bow, and
i tapers in the decreasing circles of the frames
to a very sharp stern. She weighed about fifty
tons when ready for launching, and it was
necessary to guard against complete sub
m*TKence ut.der the momentum gathered on
the ways. It.iats with the ordinary lines are
usually lifted at me stern LÂ»y the water when
they are .'aunched. One with a stern
aliurpeiH'a almost to a point, as tho Holland
wrs, it was feared might go to the bottom.
Five tons of wnter were put in her bow, there
fore, so as to raise her stern perceptiu. y.
Then there had to bean especial prepara
tion of the ways. Those on which the Hol
land rested ended about ten feet in the
water, where a: high tide there was a depth of
only about four feet. Mr. Nixon pieced out
the stationary ways to deep water by floating
ways, which were srapped to the stationary
ones. The idea was that when the Holland
reached the floating ways she would press
them into the mud, eiving the bost a nearly
level position before sue slid into deep water.
On the first move of the boat the crowd in the
ynrd gave a mighty cheer. When the boat
reached the water the cheer died away. The
Holland assumed nearly a horizontal position
while Dassing over the floating ways. Then she
began to dit> at the stern and gradually sink
into the water. The bow ro6i sligntly, and
finally the vessel became clear. Down into the
wa'er purged the heavily ladea bow with a
stiff courtesy. The bow was not submerged
and arose quickly. Theves-el continued to
slide backward into the water and to sink by
the stern. There was aimost abso ute still
ness a.s the spectators wHtched to see if she
was gotug under. The bow began to sink
aeain slightly, and before the vessel had gone
twenty feet the stern began to risj and in a
sec'tid or two the Holland was floating on the
water just ss it was predicted she would float.
\ nois<- akin to what pandemonium is sup
posed to bestartedin tne shipyard, and Mr.
Holland was overwhelmed with congratula
tions. One of the local experts employed in
the shipyard had writien in chalk on the ves
sel a lew days before she was launched:
"When this vessel is launched she will sink
ami never come tip." Tr.e Holland's perform
ance showed how much this local expert
know*. She floated two inches abov;.' her esti
mated water line.
AMERICAN APPLES IN EUROPE.
rhilttrttlpbia Ledger.'
Tfce American apple is par excellence carrj'
lng all before it in Austria-Hungary, but the
supply, which may be saiely chronicled as
enormous, In nowise satisfies the demand.
There wes an overwhelming invasion of the
fruit in the European market at the begin
ning of last autumn, when the belief prf
vailed that the transoceanic strangtr would
last out the winter. Cargoes, however, col
tinued to arrive throughout the winter, and
were snatched up with all dispatch. It is
now anticipate! that last year's crop* will
continue to supply the market until this year's
crops arrive. Austrian cultivators naturally
complain on the ptea thai, although the home
produce of last autumn was extremely scarce,
they look to a plentiful harvest this year,
which, owing to the Inferiority of the home
product, will bo unable to compete with the
superior American imports.

PUMPED LEAD
FOR BIG MONEY
A Rapid-Firing Rifle Match
at Shell Mound
Range.
William Giindemann Defeats
D. B. Faktor in a Hard
Contest.
For an Hour They Kept Thair Gun
Barrels Smoking Hot Shooting
for Most Points.
One of the hottest rifle matches that has
been shot for many a day took place at
the Shell Mound range yesterday. The
principals were William Giindemann of
WILLIAM GLINDEMANN, Who Defeated D. B. Faktor in a
One- Hour Rapid-Fire Rifle Contest at Shell Mound.
the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club and
D. B. Faktor, one of the best shots of the
California Schuetzen Club. The match
was for $100 a side and the former won*
As a matter of fact it waÂ« a freak match,
or contest more of endurance than skill.
The conditions were that each, man was to
snoot one continuous hour on the German
25-ririg target, 200 yard?, and the one mak
ing the most points, without regard to
the number of shots tired, was to win the
prize.
.Faktor appeared upon the range with
four line 15-pound Schuetzen single-shot
rifles and a pile of ammunition. Glinde
mann showed up with four Winchester 38
--55 repeaters, eight cartridges to the maga
zine. He was provided with about 800
smokeless-powder cartridges, as this ex
plosive does not heat or foul the barrels so
much as the black powder. At the two
targets were two crows of four markers,
wheel-turners, target-shifters and referees,
and at the scorers' stand each principal
was well represented.
At 1 o'clock the referee. gave the word
"fire." and a perfect fusillade began. For.
an hour the racket was deafening, the re
peating rifles barking twice to the single
shots' one. One man was kept busy load
ing the former and another had bis hands
full cooling off single-shot barrels. Empty
shells filled both - stands. For the first
70 to 100 shots it looked as though
Faktor nad a walkover, for while he shot
fairly fast he held well and several times
he made runs of 22's and 24's. During
the last twenty â ' minutes Glindemana got
in a steady killing pace, every shot count
ing, and he made up his lost ground at a
rapid rate, which resulted. in his victory.
When the hour bad expired and the
shooting ceased Glindemann had fired 417
â¢hotÂ» and Faktor 295. The scorers' rec
ords showed that Glindemann had 5133
points to his credit and Faktor 4956. Fak
tor also bad a scorer at the targets keep
inn "tab on Glindemann's shots. That
record gave thÂ« winner only 4983 points,
still 27 more than Faktor. The ' latter'
friends claimed that the match was lost
by the wheel on Glindemann's target not
registering properly. But it was a great
match, and it caused nearly all the shoot
ers on the ran c to suspend operations
and rather in a lar-.e crowd : back of the
two big rapid-firing marksmen.
The semi-monthly gathering of the
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club brought
out a fair representation and some excel-,
lent scores were made, particularly by J.
E. Gorman, who broke the revolver record
of the coast if not of the United States.
In six shots be made twenty points, Co

HANDY WITH A GUN.
Mn. Mattie Toye, Alias Hattie Emer
son, Hits 'Iwo lllen With One
Shot.
Mrs. Mattie Toye, alias Hattie Emerson,
was arrested yesterday afternoon by
Policemen P. H. Mu r phy and John Mac-
Lean on a charge of assault to murder.
She was in Evans' saloon, 116 Eddy
street, drinking with John P. Duff, saloon
keeper, Viy 2 Eddy street, and his bar
tender, Charles L. Richardson. A quar
rel ensued and the woman pulled a revol
ver out of ihe pocket of her dress and
tired at Duff. Ricnardson mechanically
held up his right hand to protect Duff
and the bullet passed through the fleshy
part of his baud and struck Duff on the
rieht arm, causing an abrasion.
Murphy and Mac Lean heard tbe shot
and ran to the saloon. They placed the
woman under arrest and she declared she
had fired the shot at Duff because he gave
her a severe beating about a week ago.
She had been living with him.
Richardson and Duff had their wounds
dressed at the Receiving Hospital and
Duff was detained as a witness along with
a woman named Nellie Sullivan.
Mrs. Toye is handy with a revolver.
On November 4,1891, she shot Robert
Ojedu, a marine engineer, in tne abdomen
in lier house at 68 Everett street. Ojeda
and Duff's brother had been in the habit
of frequently visiting her. Bh,e left the
Cily alter the shooting, but returned on
November 0 and was arrested. The case
was afterward dismi-sed in tbe Police
Court for luck of prosecution.
HURLED A WOMAN
INTO THE BAY
William Herron Attempts
the Life of Mrs.
Miller.
He* Has Borne a Grudge Against
the Old Lady and Wanted
Revenge.
While She Was Amusing Herself
With Her Dogs, He Threw Her
Off Third-Street Wharf.
William Herron, a young man who has
been wont to let the years of bis life roll
gently under him without extremely
exerting himself to attain fame or for
tune, all but augmented the list of mur
derers yesterday afternoon at 4:30 o'cl6ck.
In an endeavor to avenge a real or fancied
wrong done him he tnrew an aged lady,
Mrs. Mary Miller, who resides at 518>Â£
Bryant street, from Third-street wharl,
into the chilling waters of the bay.
After committing the crime he slowly
walked away, taking no notice or the
drowning woman's screams and stolidly
refusing to assist her rescuer.
Mrs. Miller daily takes two dogs to
Third-street wharf and for some time
tosses bita of wood into the water for them
to fetcn.
Herron happened to rass the old lady
when she was llanding on the wharfs
edge and for a time he loitered near her.
Then he suddenly placed his hand on her
shoulder and hurled her into the bay.
Mrs. Miller soon came to the surface
and screamed for assistance, all the time
making frantic endeavors to keep her
head above water. James Peterson,
watchman of the schooner George W.
Preston, saw Herron's act, and hurrying
to a boat, put out to the old lady's assist
ance.
He reached her as she was about to sink
a second time, and dragged her to tne
wharf. She was removed to her home,
and outside of a severe fright, was unin
jured.
Herron, who quietly walked away from
the scene, wns pointed out and arrested
by Officers O'Reilly and O'Connor, who
charged him with assault to murder at
the Southern police station.
At the station me prisoner denied hav
ing made an attempt on Mrs. Miller's
life and said she fell into tne bay acci
dentally. He acknowledged seeing ncr
fall, but when asted why he refused to gu
to her rescue said, "I wouldn't haul her
out of the bay if she were dead."
"Tne trouble which yesterday afternoon
culminated in the attempt to take my
life took place between my assailant and
me over two years a ? :O," said Mrs. Miller
ljst evening. "At the time I was living at
560>i Bryant street, aud young Herron,
his uioti er and his brother Frank occu
pied the flat nbove me.
'â One day William Herron set an ash-
I barrel near my door and I asKed him to
remove it, as the ynnd scattered the ashes
over my floor. n% refused with curses,
and the next day Fr ink, in an endeavor
I to aggravate me, scattered the ashes over
Imy front porch. I expostulated with nim
and he struck me a blow in the eye.
Shortly after that I moved, but neverthe
less William has always borne a grudge
aeainst me, ami yesterday afternoon he
nearly succeeded in taking my life lor re-
I venge."
ANOTHER PIONEER GONE.
Death of John A. Drinkhouse
Who Cama to California
in 1849
Cloe of a Long C.raer That Was
Varied by Many Vicissitudes
of Fortone
John A. Drinkhouse, a prominent pio
neer and business man of this City, died
yesterday at his residence, 2502 Broadway.
He leaves a widow, and four chiJdfen â
two sons, John Arthur and Frederick R.
DrinKbouae, and two daughters, Lulu and
Hilda. .
Mr. Drinkbouse held a prominent "posi
tion among the early settlers of the State.
When 30 years of age he gave up a clerk
ship in his father's store in Philadelphia,
attracted by ti.e accounts of the gold dis
coveries in California. With several oth
ers he started with a cargo of house
frames, building material and miscella
neous articles and arrived at San Francisco
with it on the baric Maria on the lath of
December, 1849.
Within live weeks after landing he and
his associates had cleared $7000 on the
venture. He next established a place of
business on Montgomery street, but a diÂ«
astrous fire destroyed his establishment
and for the time almost involved him in
financial ruin.
In his difficulties he fell back upon his
musical talents, which served him in good
stead, for after playins? his violin for sev
eral years in San Francisco and many
towns of the State, he saved enough to
enable him again to embark in commer
cial ventures.
Like many others of the days of '49, the
deceased pioneer at various times ex
perienced the extremes of adversity ana
prosperity. At one time he loaned money
to Mark Hopkins atlO per cent, and Collis
P. Huntington was also one of his
debtors.
Besides being engaged as a wholesale
eisar and tobacco dealer, he was actively
engaged in numerous mining enterprises.
In ail his business undertakings lie ex
hibited the prudence and sagacity for
which he was known in commercial
circles. â¢
The funer.il will.be held to-morrow
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock ai Pioneer Hall.
SPARRERS STRIKE HARD.

w The sparring match at the Chutes yes
terday between the Californian, Jim Jeff
ries, and Billy Woods of Denver pro
nounced by the manager to be the best
exhibition of the kind that has ever taken
place there. There was evidently no mu
tual agreement between the sparrers to
deal tenderly with r each other, and % the
whack of the heavy blows could be heard
.far out on the grounds. There were three
rounds, and in each Jeffries showed a su
periority orer bis opponent, although the
â¢DenVer man landed 1 ; aâ â  number of clever
blows. By > the i end of ? the 'i third round
Woods was pretty, badly winded and " both
; cheeks were bleeding.^ ;;"; ' .^ c:
The crowd at the park and ocean beach
was * very - light h considering ,r . the ; J fine
weather. At the fcutro baths f there were
some auditions to the programme which
were of much merit. ; *;iThe performance of
John Payne in hiÂ» unsupported ladder
act is wonderful. He climbs the ladder
and stands on the topmost round while
keeping it balanced on end by his un
aided efforts. Professor Kure ate,
and wrote under water.

A HOTEL BURNED
TO THE GROUND
Early Morning Blazes at
South San Fran
cisco.
Occupants of the Point House
Lose All Their Personal
Effects.
The A. Steiger's Sons Pottery at First
Supposed to Ec the Seat
of the Fire.
The Point House, a two-story frame i
.hotel situated near the packing- house of !
the Western Meat Company at South San
Francisco, was totally destroyed by tire
early yesterday morning. The fire was
discovered by James Lindhood, who was
asleep in the building at the time the fire
broke out. Only one of the remaining
ten boarders was in the hotel at the time,
most of the others being in fhe City.
An alarm was turned in at the packing
house, and immediately afterward an
alarm was sounded at South San Francisco,
a mile and a half away. The fire equipment
at that place consists of a single hose
cart and, as there was no engine to pump
the water to the building, nothing could I
be done to check the progress of the
names. Besides tue alarm in the town,
the whittle of the theater train which was
just passing South San Francisco at the
lime served to arouse the residents of the
vicinity.
All the belongings of the boarders that
were in the building were destroyed. One
of the men had left $120 in gold in his
room, and in the morning he discovered
it in a molten lump among the ashes.
The hotel site is only a few hundred
yards irom the pottery oi A. Bteiger's Sons,
which waa located at Baden less than
two years ago, after being burned oat at
San Jose. It was thought at first that the
pottery was in flames, on account of the
great illumination made by the fire.
The building was the property of the
Western Meat Company nnd waa rented
until the lsi of June to K. Williams. The
greatest io s falls upon the boarders, who
lost their belongings, the building itself
having been insured.

SAD' "FmT E .
,The New I York newspapers : recently
published the details of the suicide of a
society woman f who became ; crazed by
headache and drowned herself in the
harbor. What a sad end to a life that
ought to have * been completely, happy!
Doubly sad because advanced 'science
could â¢- have paved ; her! - Munyon has a

cures in three minutes and leaves no de-
pressing effects. One or two doses, will

â -': In striking: contrast to the above sad
case is that of Mrs. E. Hardin, 3.969 Ger-
man town Avenue, Philadelphia. Pa., wife
of the ; Clerk of the Board of Education.
â who Bays: " For thirty years- I suffered
â with sick â  headache, which appeared in
attacks of severe pain, so intense that I
was obliged to remain in bed for days
at a time. .-These attacks ; appeared al-
most every week, and at no time did I
ever receive relief, although I consulted ;
the most skilled .physicians in the city.
The headaches â â  seemed to wear them- r
selves out and then commence anew. At
last I was induced to try Munyon's
Headache Cure. The relief was magical
and almost instantaneous. I followed up
the treatment and, was completely cured
âfor three years have passed and I have
had no return of the headaches. I have
recommended Munyon's. Remedies to a

WISDOM FROM
MANY PULPITS
Rev. J. Clarke Robbins of
Berkeley Scores Cam
bridge.
Rev. Louis C. Sanford Preaches
on the Testimony of the
Resurrection.
" Enthusiasm " the Theme of Rey. Mr.
Gardnerâ Rev. Mr. Shepard oa
"Eiucation."
BERKELEY, Cal., May 23. âIn his ser
mon this evening at tne North Berkeley
Congregational Church Rev. J. Clarke
Robbins upbraided in rigorous language
Cambridge University for refusing any
longer to grant degrees to women. He
toot Miriam of old as the first type of
what is commonly known as the "new
woman."
He went on to point ont the qualities of
unwomanliness in Miriam, such as the
desire to rule over men, to look like man
ana to wear man's clothes. Returning to
the defense of the womanly woman, he
upheld the virtuous desires that prompt
her to forge ahead and to rival men in the
development of the intellect.
He said the type of new woman such as
Miriam represents does not suggest any
thing of womanliness, of gentleness, love
of devotion and sweetness, but rather the
spirit to boss other women, and, as far as
sue can, to boss men.
She was the first woman on record to
dis-pute man's superiority to women.
There are new women and new women.
There are women of all types, but the
woman who wants to be a man, who
wants to wear man's clothes, to look and
act like a man, finds but little room.
Even on the stage teople soon tire of tier;
she may venture too far, presume too
mucn. It is a ridiculous, foolish thing for
a woman to wort: for equal rights, just to
show that she is me equal of any man.
The story of Cambridge debarring wo
men from taking degrees there reads like
an anachronism when we consider that it
transpired at this time of the nineteenth
century. The fact that such a question
nas arisen shows that the women under
graduates have the requisite ability to win
a decree and that it is the bigoiry and me
dival prejudices that refuse it to them.
"\\ here was ihe chivalry of those British
scions who gave prolonged applause for
the vote that said, "No woman in Cam
bridge snail receive me honors sne has
won?"
How far can Â»uch an institution of
learning be said to meet its great end
when the university life is so far behind
the spirit of the age? The suffrage ques
tion met de!eat in California because the
men knew the women were in the right
and that if they were granted suffrage the
death warrant would be read over their
criminal factories of reform.
i * â
Testimony of
the Resurrection.
"Ye shall be my witnesses," Acts i: 8,
was the text ol Rev. Louis C. Sanford of
Belnia at St. Paul's Episcopal Church yes
terday. Among other things he said:
"This commission was issued to the
church by our Lord just before his ascen
sion. His followers were to be witnesses
to all tne world of his resurrection. The
word witness is used first in the historical
oense meaning an eye-witness that Jesus
showed himself alive after his passion' by
many infallible proofs. It is al*o used in
an ethical sense referring to the testimony
which the first Christians should bear in
tneir apright and telf-denying lives to the
resurrection, a fact of the greatest moral
Significance. For us the character of the
historical testimony has changed. In
stead of eye-witnesses we must produce
their writings. But the ethical testimony
cannot change. It demands the samefaitb,
hope and devotion it demanded of the
apostl9s themselves.
"The Christian's faith is an element in
hia ethical testimony to the resurrection.
Our faith in God is faith in righteousness.
Had we no knowledge of God we cAild
cave no laith in righteousness, the
Christian hope is a second element in the
ethical witness to Christ. Tuis life is a
real one, but since Christ has risen the
future life is more real. This life is a pro
bation in which we are preparing for a
life not of individual unconsciousness, like
the- Buddhist, but for one of the intensest
consciousness.
"In the third place, since the resurrec
tion has proved tne worth of love and
made a life of sacrifice the ideal life of the
race, our Christian love is tha third ele
ment in our ethical testimony to the
resurrection. A life of love is the stron -
est evidence we can bsar to his truth and
power. Such testimony is no less valu
able than that of the martyrs, for the
great witness of the church must be made
up of infinitesimal acts of love indefinitely
repeated." â¢
The Pre-Millennial
Coming of Christ.
Key. 0. C. Miller, pastor of the Church
of tie Holy Spirit, 2127 Jackson street,
preached yesterday morning on the sec
ond coming of Christ, selecting as '-his
tests: â  â "-.. ' â  .
Act i:llâ "This same Jesus which Is
taken up from you into heaven shall so
come in like manner as ye have seen him
go into heaven."
Maihew xxiv:27â "For as the lightning
cometh out of the east and shineth unto
the west: so shall also the coming of the
son of man be."
Mathew ixiv:o4. "But as the days of
Noah were, >>o shall also the coming ol
the son of man be."
Ilia subject was "The Preniellenial
Coming oi Christ." These texts, he
paid, establish beyond all doubt the
following statements: That Jesus is
coniins bÂ»ck to our earth again in lulfill
ment of his promise. That he will be the
fame glorified Jesus that ascended from
Olivet. That his coming Trill be in like
manner as he went away, "In the clouds
of heaven with power ana great glory.''
That the time of his coming is kept
secret from both men and angels, even as
no man by watching the clouds can tell
when they shall be rent w:th the light
ning that flashes suddenly from the east
to toe west.
A helief in the premillennial coming of
our Lord is of the greatest practical im
portance. It urges powerfully to watcb
lulness, sobriety, repentance aud faithful
ness; to our covenant with Go>l. It is a
FINANCIAL.

mighty incentive to boldness in not being
ashamed to confess Christ ; a strone bul
wark agiinst the awful influx of worldli
ness. While it teaches moderation, pa
tience and the mortification of the flesh,
it inspires absolute sincerity and conse
cration of our entire being to our Creator
as nothing else can do. It powerfully ex
horts to ministerial faithfulness, pastoral
diligence and purity of life. The beauty
and glory that shall attend the return of
our king will render it no sacrifice to give
up wnat now is. From a neglect to preach
this doctrine the church has in a great
measure lost her purity, and with it her
power from the enduement of the holy
spirit.
The Universality
of Natural Law.
Rev. J. S. David spoke on il The Univer
sality of Natural Law" at Washington
Hall last night. In part he said:
"iiy natuial law is meant normal law,
or law that inheres in the nature of
things as distinguished from arbitrary or
man-made law. Natural laws are uni
versal and eternal on all planes of being.
They originate in eternal being itself, or
God, and eternally proceed from him.
Hence they can never be violated, changed
or supended. The creation of the uni
verse and of man proceeds eternally from
God, according to unalterable laws of in
volution and tvolution. Revelation is
divine truth descending like li.ht and
veiling itself in familiar earthly forms
according to a law of correspondences or
symbols. Regeneration is an unfolding
of the higher planes of the mind accord
ing to a law of spiritual evolution. The
resurrection is a natural emerging of the
spiritual form from its physical husk.
Heaven and hell is the spiritual expan
sion or contraction, the happiness or
misery naturally resulting from a good or
evil life. All angels were once men and
developed into angnls by normal processes.
All miracles, socalled, nre extraordinary
manipulations of nature's laws and are
never suspensions of law. True religion
is a perception of nature's harmony and a
conformity of the life thereto."
Righteousness, the
Kingdom Within.
Rev. William Rader cf the Third Con
gregational Church preached yesterday
on the subject of "The Kingdom Within."
He said:
The phrase "Kingdom of God" is a re
ligious idea express 1 in political lan
guage. It was used in an age of thrones
and principalities. Our Lord used the
term kingdom in a religious sense. With
it he described his universal reign. He
said that it would come invisibly as the
leaven worked and as the seed developed;
that it was not an external wonder, bat
an inward iife; "the kingdom of God is
within you." This kingdom within is
not "meat and drink" ; that is ceremony
and form and rite. It is not church mem
bership. The church shelters, conserves
and develops the kingdom within. It is
not any Particular form of belief.
The kingdom within is righteousness.
Righteousness is character. Religion is
character. He who is righteous is re
ligious no matter to what church he be
longs. The kingdom within is happiness
and joy in the Holy Ghost. Fundament
ally Christianity is peacs. A close view
of the reiieion of the New Testament dis
closes a religion of great stability and
peace. Happiness is within. If you de
pend wholly UDon others for happiness
you will be disappointed.
Enthusiasm and
the Enthusiast.
At the West Side Christian Church yes
terday Rev. William Gardner's theme was
"Enthusiasm" and his text Acts, xxvi:'J4;
"Paul, thou art beside thyself. Much
learning doth make tbee mad." He said
in part:
"Enthusiasm is seldom popular. The
enthusiast is denominated a fanatic, and
that points him out as one who should be
shunned by the sober-minded and cul
tured. The fanatic ia incemperately zeal
ous over small tning-s; the enthusiast has
a burning zeal for things as great as God
and the universe.
"Enthusiasm is not the frenzy of sud
den excitement, but grave inward self
contro!.
"No truly great things are accomplished
in any department of lire without enthusi
asm. It makes men strong, active and
brave. It is like steam to a. locomotive.
Until the steam generates the train will
not move. Bo a man may be strong, edu
cated and cultured but, without enthusi
asm, he will accomplish little.
'â¢Every church that succeeds and every
Christian who is worthy of the name is
moved by tile spirit of zeal and earnest
ness that often calls forth from the world
the old accusation: 'Thou art beside thy
self.' "
Rev. H. T. Shepard on
"The True Education."
The Rev. H. T. Shepard delivered a ser
mon at the Olivet Congregational Church
yesterday on the subject of "Education."
In the course of his remarks he said :
The error of many who condemn edu
cation lies in mistaking a part for the
whole. Knowledge and skill are blamed
for man's misuse of them. When educa
tion does not make a man more useful
and successful and true to himself and the
world, it is imperfect or misdirected. It
is not education. The fault is the edu
cator's or his own. Wise education is al
ways a blessing.
Perfect education in civil government
would make it impossible for Turkey to
repeat its chapter of inhuman carnage
against dofenseless Armenian Christians.
Il would arouse all friends of liberty to
Cuba's support in their heroic struggle
for freedom from Spanish oppression.
CIGARETTE ORDINANCE.
The Author, Hagkins, Ex
plaina Its Provisions.
The order introduced in the Board of
Supervisors to prevent the sale of cigar
ettes in San Francisco has been referred
to the Judiciary Committee and a hAr
in tr of interested parties will take place
Tuesday of next week.
Supervisor Thomas H. Haskins, who
introduced the resolution, believes that
the order will be passed by the board, but
he will not insist on its adoption if it
should be shown that injury to retail
! merchants will follow.
On this point he sa.d : "So far as lam
able to ascertain the dealers favor the
prohibition. Tbev comprehend that the
protit in handling c earettes is very slight,
owing to the monopoly In tbe business.
Many dealer's have told me they wanted a
law adopted absolutely prohibiting the
sale. It frequently happens that a man
buying a glass of beer will say: 'Give me
a cigarette. 1 The reqiu-st is too small to
be refused, yet when the package is
broken all must be given away. Then
again so many new brHnds are always
coming out that the dealer in a business
ever so small must keep irom $30 to $50
tied up in cigarettes, and if one brand
proves unsalable the profit on all is lost.
"The law against the sale of cigarettes
is in force in Alameda," said Mr. Haw
kins, "and from all accounts ii gives gen
eral satisfaction. I shall ascertain in
what cities of the East the law is in force
nnd DRHBt the lacts to the committee
Ne, I do not anticipate objection from the
retail grocers, although I expect that
agents of the factories or wholesale firms
may present objections. My idea is to
abolish a nuisance and an injury without
interfering with the rights of trade or the
convenience of individuals."
The universities and colleges of Austria
afford employment /or 1400 professors.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 24, 1897.
WILL HELP THE
NEW DEBS PLAN
The Brotherhood of the
Co-operative Common
wealth Confers.
Religion and Politics Will Be
Barred From the Proposed
Colony.
Local Members Stand Rsadr to Pa
Forward the New Propaganda
Without Delay.
There was an interesting meeting of the
Brotherhood of the Co-operative Com
monwealth at 418 McAllister street yes
terday.
The purpose of the organization is to do
everything possible in a legal and peace
able way to realize some such scheme as
that advocated by Bellamy and other
socialistic writers.
An impetus Has lately been given their
movement by the indorsement of Eugene
V. iJoDs, who sees in some such plan a
hope of the emancipation of labor from
tne thralldom of private greed.
It was agreed in a general way at yes
terday' 3 meeting that the members are to
do all in their power to prevent religion
and politics from entering in any way
into the issues discussed by the members
of the brotherhood.
A committee from the local body stands
ready to co-operate with the national
society in a movement to acquire a large
territory where the socialistic experiment
may be fully tried. It is probable the
start will be made in Middle Tennessee,
which offers a wide variety of soils and an
equable climate. If tee first colony is
located there members from all parts of
tlie Union will be expected to contribute
10 cents a month to the success of the en
terprise. Departments of manufacture
and distribution will be founded, and ,1
thorough experiment will be made along
the lines indicated by the prospectus of
the society.
A CONTINUOUS SHOW.
The Latest Scheme of the
Walter Orpheum Com
pany.
It Has L?ased th? P ople's Palace
Building;, and Will Open Inside
of Two Koiths
A deal was consummated Saturday
afternoon that may revolutionize the
theatrical business in this City. A five
years' lease of th â¢ property known as the
People's Palace, corner of Eddy and
Mason, was obtained from the owner,
J. K. Prior, by the Walter Opheuni
Company, of which Gustav Walter in
director-gennral and H. Meyerfelrit secre
tary, the purpose being to open a first
class place of amusement and put on con
tinuous shows.
The lot is 137:6x137:6, and ft is proposed
to entirely remodel the building; a strip
of ground on the south will be utilized
also. The work of remodeling will com
mence at once. The stage will be made
large enough to accommodate the most
extensive productions, und the beating
capacity will be 3500.
The alterations are to be concluded in
two month-, and the new house will prob
ably de called the Oiympia. Continuous
houses, us they are called, have been suc
cessfully run in the Eastern cities for
some years, but this will be the first ven
ture of the kind in San Francisco.
The show will consist of plays rendered
by a good dramatic company, with vaude
ville turns between acts, or following the
dramatic performance, finort operas are
also given in the New York and Boston
houses in conjunction with variety act?,
the combination proving very popular
with Eastern theater-g< ers.
In the Eastern houses the performance
begins at 10 o'clock in the morning, and
with two short intermissions, lasts till 11
at nijiht. The Ean Francisco house will
probably give two performances a day,
afternoon and evening. Gustav Walter is
iiow in the East bookincr for both the
Orpheum and the continuous house. He
will sail for Europe Thursday to secure
the talent on the other side.
"The town is too small for the continu
ous show, in my opinion," said Jacob
Gottlob of the Columbia Theater lait
night. "Of course I don't pretend to
know it all, but it strikes me our popula
tion is too small, and we have too few
transients. However, the location is a
good one, and the venture may prove a
success."
Manager Walter Morosco of the Grand
Opera-house was of Mr. Gottlob's mind,
lie Maid in substance that the Eastern
houses depended on the traveling public
for their patronaee, and that afternoon
shows especially rarely paid. On the
whole, Manager Morosco thought the con
tinuous xhow plan a loser.
"The Orpheuni 1 as always kept faith
w'th the pub ie and will undoubtedly do
so in the future," said Manager Fred
Belasco of the Alcazar. ''As far as I'm
concerned, I wish them success."

ond lieutenant and assigned to Company X,
Fourth Infantry, at Fort Sheridan. Sergeant
Paul Giddings of Troop E. Eighth Cavalry,
has been commissioned second lieutenant and

There is a change in the revolvers used by
the troops. All Colt's of 38-caliber, model of
1892, are being replaced by those of the model
01 1894, which d ffer from ihe other in the ad
dition of a locking lever, which prevents the
hMinmer from being cocked except when the
cylinder is positively closed and locked. A
] ortion of the troops, including the first seven
regiments of cavalry, have already been sup
plied with the nrw weapons.
The Secretary of War is considering a propo
sition from Genera; Miles io substitute russet
for black leather for army bridges, saddles and
harness. Black leather has been abolished in
the armies of Europe, and the reason for the
change is thut russet leather can be Kepi in
order with los trouble than black leather
and that it does not soil so much as black
does.
Lieuienant I'reston of the Ninth Cavalry

granted to Major S. W. Grosbeck, Judge Advo
cate, United States Army.
Troop C, Fourth Cavalry, will leave the Pre
sidio to-day for duty at Sequoia and General
Grant parks.
In constquence of the fogs which prevailed
during the past week the practice with the
bigguns at Fort Point was interfered with.
As soon as clear weather permits the batteries
that have not yet tired will perform the duty
required. It is probable that in the future the
gun practice will be held toward the close of
the season instead of at the beginning.
The monthly muster and inspection will be
held at the Presidio post next Monday, but It
will be earlier thaii usual on account of the
Memorial day exercises that will be held in

zens who will go to tne post early in the morn
ing will see a pretty display oi the troops.
To-day there will be battle exercise in the
viclui y of Golf Hill, conunencinj; at about

"I/Ows" uhi ally first appear on tbe Washington

VITAL IMPORTANCE
The Valley Road Terminus
Will of Necessity Be
a Benefit.
A "Hated Corporation" U the
Bsst PatroD of a " Pub
lic Utility."
Coincidence of Recent and Old Id:as
Regarding a Terminal on
Goat Island.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 23. f
One of the most peculiar arguments
made in regard to a public enterprise is
that now being made by a few interested
people concerning the probable advent cf |
the Valley railway ir.V) Oakland. These
few declare that unless it shall come to a
certain section of tiie city it will not prove
a benefit to the whole community. This
statement pract.caliy amounts to an ad
mission that Oakland is as large now as it
ever will be, and indicates a belief that it
wili never grow.
While nothing is as yet decided, the
Valley railroad may be presumed to come
from any direction, but whatever route be
taken, it is certain that development wili
follow. The desire ot the minority is to
have tiie new road Jocate its terminus on
the south side or the estuary, where it is !
certain that there it will be necessary to j
pass through two bridges before the depot j
can be reached from the bay.
The majority want to see it located
along the beach to the north of the City,
where all sons of advantages are claimed
for ir. These a-sert that it matters little
just where the terminus of the road is
located, as it is only a matter of a few
years before Oakland will stretch clear to
Berkeley on one side and past Fruitvale
on the other, and that the city will of
necessity reach the depot before long.
This latter, viewed irrespective of any
particular location, is certainly the right
one to take. In a short time a conference
will be held of representatives of Oakland
and of the Valley road, and it is not good
policy for any one to hamper tbe mission i
of the local committee.
The location of a railroad terminus is '
riot a matter of sentiment. It is a cool
business proposition and it needs to be
handled in a broad, generous and busi
ness like manner. In ihe past this city
has suffered immensely from the sense
less behavior of a lot of ambitious poli
ticians who made capital of seeing "the !
hard of the railroad" in everything.
Thi- has disturbed the contidenoeof in
vestors, and while Oakland is altogether
too conservative and modest along certain
1 nes she is much too radical in others.
The VaJiey road project is one that can be
mat with neither conservatism nor radi
calism nor selfishness, but requires active
harmony.
A little incident happened last night
that should delight the heart of even the
least enthusiastic Populist. The narrow
rauge mole, owned by the second largest
railroad corporation in the country, was
lighted by electr:citv supplied from a I
municipal plant. For a quarter of a cen- I
tury all kinds cf people have vented their j
opinions ot me littleol lamps at the Ala- i
nieda mole and have said a great deal |
about the non-generosity of corporations i
nnd of the great benefits to be derived j
from "public ownership of general utili
ties." Now it has enrne to pass ihat thÂ«
first '"public utility" established in Ala- |
meda County has a "hated corporation"
for its best customer.
Some time ago Alar-den Manson, the
well-kaown engineer, published an article
in which he outlined a plan for the con
tinuation of the Long Wharf to Goat
Is and, and the establishment of a system
of docks and wharves at the island.
Doubte s unknown to Mr. Manson, |
there is a record in this county, and has j
l>een for thirty-one yenis, of an article of j
incorporation for just Buch a project.
In an old history of Alameda County,
under date of IS6S, appear* the following:
Among the many railroad enterprises afloat
at this t.me was oce for the construction of a
load from Oakland to lioÂ»t isiar.d. A profile I
of the pr. posed road was filed in the Recor- I
der's office on January 22, certified by Charles
>ltin, president; Periguine Fitzhugh, secre
tary, aii'l L H. Short, chief engineer. T:ie
route was in a direct line irom the outer end
of tne Ssu Francisco mil Oakland Railroad i
Companies' wharl to the island. The distance '
OTer which the road was to ba constructed '
was nearly two miles, and the greatest depth
of water to be passed over was about sixty
feet. Such a road would give railroad com
munication to within one and five-eighths
mile* of San Francisco. Goat Island was looked
upon by railroad eaglaeen es the terminal
point of tnÂ« transcontinental railroad, and as I
eariy as 1803 T. D. Judah, the original pro- I
jector of the Central Pacific Railroad, r>ut his !

CLERKS OBJECT TO
WORK FOREVER
Will Organize to Regain
the Ground Lost of
Late Years.
In Some Stores They Now Work
More Than Twelve Hours
Each Day.
When Asked to Work on Sunday They
Decided to Take Steps for Taeir
Protection.
Oakland Office Fan Fbancisco Call, |
908 Broadway, May 23. t
The retail clerks of this city will hold
a meeting to-morrow night for the pur
pose of reorganizing a union. They state
that their condition at this time is worse
than it ever was before they had iheir
union several years ago.
The Retail Clerks 1 Union of Oakland
five years ago was one of the strongest
unions around the bay. So complete
was their organ:zition that they were
able to insure the closing of all drygoorts
stoie, on Sunday, and also inaugurated
an early-closing movement. At that time
only one store in 0 skland, which after
ward pot into difficulty, attempted to
defy the union. The proprietor under
took to open his store on Sunday, even
after he had signed au agreement with
the other merchants not to do so. His
place was besieged with clerks, who held
indignation meetings on the sidewalt,
and the crowd which gathered had on one
occasion to be restrained by the police
from doing violence.
Little by little they relaxed their vigi
lance and lost all that they had fought
for. Tue union became disorganized,
meetings were neglected, one storekeeper
after another found that he could defy
the rules of the union with impunity, and
for more than two years it has been com
pletely demoralized.
One of the leaders of the movement said
to-day that they are confident of regain
ing their lost ground. "All the large
merchants are with us," he said, "and
are just as anxious that we should have a
few hours for pleasure as we are ourselves.
They do not desire to make slaves of their
clerks, but this is a movement which must
Â£>c ceneral or else it might work a hard
ship on those who agree to stand to with
us. At the present time our hours are
worse than they ever were. We work
from Bln the morning until in some in
stances 10 o'clock at night with but un
certain periods lor meals.
"Some eniDioyers have also adopted a
plan of clearing np their stores and ar
ranging new goods on Sunday and expect
their employes to put in half of that day
in addition to the long hours during the
week. It It this Sunday worJC which has
really determined us to take a new stand.
The largest employers of labor have al
ready signified their willingness to help
U3 in this matter provided we can get all
the merchants to come to a uniform agree
ment.
"In this matter we must be helped by
the general public and when we Jiave or
gauized and outline our programme we
shall take all legitimate steps to keep the
public informed of its progress and how
we are treated or maltreated."

The Bohemian* Defeated by Twenty-
Seven Runs at Alameda.
! For the second time this season the Bo
hemian 1 cricket team yesterday suffered
defeat at the hands of the Alameda team,
{his time by twenty-seven runs. Going'
first to bat, the Bohemians, thanks chiefly
to the worK of Price and McLean, put up
sixty-two. Their opponents were allowed
to top this score, though six of their wick
ets fell for zeros, j The | result was due
principally to the missing of an easy
catch from Moray in the early part of his
inning.
'.The fielding on both sides was sloppy,
and showed that week-day practice is not
being properly attende i to. The scares:

NOTES FOR THE
NATIONAL GUARD
Some Official Reports That
Have Been Long
Delayed.
Orders Issued for the Memorial-
Day Parade and Exercises
at Cemeteries.
The First Infantry Will Go Into
Camp at Ukiah Next August.
The Naval Battalion.
On the 30th of last November the com
mander-in-chiei approved new firing regula
tions which are to go Into effect on the 30th of
next June, but up to date the members of the
guard have not received any orders for target
practice. The new regulations were not op
erative and will not be lor live weeks, yet the
old ones weje in force, but not enforced. The
guardsmeu feel very much as if they had lost
an opportunity to gain credit as marksmen,
and the chances are that they will not have
an opportunity to face the targets until next
September, for the new regulations say that
such practice Fhall be held in the months of
January, May, September and October, and at
200, 300 and 500-yard ranges and skirmish
firing. The latter firing must be in the month
of May. There has evidently been 'a blunder
somewhere.
Promptness of action does not mark the
movements of those who are upper grades of
the guard of the State. Last November there
was an investigation into the aflairs of an olli
cer named Douglass, connected with the Naval
Battalion. A report was presented to the
proper officials, but as yet no action has been
taken either confirming or disapproving the
report. Another instance is the ca^e of Cap
tain Jenks of Troop A. There was an investi
gation as to the management or mismanage
ment ol the affairs of tne company. More than
three months ago there was presented a report
exonerating the captain, but no official notice
has yet been given of that lact. Possibly in
the 'distant iuture somebody will rummage
through some pigeon hole, find these reports,
and then some action may be taken on them.
Second Brigade.
The inspection of the companies of the First
Infantry, Second Brigade, the signal corps and
Troop A are over, and while the official re
turns are not in, it can be said that, with one
or two exceptions, all the companies made a
good showing numerically and that the re
ports wiL show that the condition of the sev
eral companies is much better than it was at
the previous inspection.
The First ReKiment will on Monday next
(Mcmor.al day) escort George H. Thomas Post,
G. A. R , to the Presidio and take part in the
ceremonies oJ dedication of the monument
that will be unveiled in the post cemetery on
that day.
The signal corps. Captain Perkins, and
Troop A, Captain Jeaks, and the Naval Bat
talion, Captain Turner, will act as escort to
the otner posts of the Grand Army that are to
parade down tow v, and proceed to the ceme
teries and there decorate toe graves of tneir
comrades who have passed away.
The board of officers of the First have finally
decided that the camp of that regiment shail
bo held on the site a short distance out of
Ukiah on which there have already been sev
eral encampments. This choice was made
after a number of sites haJ b.en inspected.
The time selected is Irom August 21 to the
29th, and in the selection of that time the
dates chosen by the Fifth. Infantry and thu
brigades in the southern part of the State were
considered. The further fact that the citizens
of San Francisco are entitled to have the First
Regiment parade in the City on ihe Fourth of
Juiy was also taken into consideration.
Now tnat the quesiion of camp has been
fixed it is proDosea to recruit the companies
up to as near lull strength as possible. It is
probable that, exclusive of the band, 800 men
will go to the camp near Ukiab.
While at camp the members of the First will
practice at silhouette targets, something that
is required by the new regulations but which
the members of the First cannot very well in
dulge in because of lack of a suitable runge.
Last Friday evening the Hieh Scnool Cadets,
Captain Ed wards commanding, gave a dance
in the auditorium of the Gins' High School.
There was a large attendance and a most en
j jvable evening was spent.
The Fifth Regiment lniantry has not yet set
tled upon a place for its camp, nor will it until
it is fully determined what amount will be
allowed for transportation.
Troop A.
During the past week a number of the cred
itors of Troop A were paid for bills that were
incurred during the term of Captain Sime.
There are still some bills to be paid, but when
the waiting creditors will receive their money
is not known.
The troop has been doing remarkably of late,
increasing in numbers and in proficiency.
The Veterans of the Guard.
The association known as the Veterans of
the National Guard has removed from the
Flood building to quarters lv the Pioneer
building. At the annual election held last
Wednesday Colonel A. D. Cutler was elected
commander, H. E. Snook vice-commander,
Lieutenant-Colonel P. L. Bush adjutant, ana
Captain C. P. Ie Breton paymaster. The asso
ciation will hold its annual banquet at the Oc
cidental on Wednesday next.
The Naval Battalion.
The members of the first and second divis
ions of the naval battalion have been ordered
to assemble at the armory, 22i/2 East street, at
half-past 8 o'clock next Monday to take part
in the parade, part of the memorial fervice,
in memory of the Nation's dead. Captain
Turner, commanding the naval militia, an
nounces that none but statutory excuses will
be accepted from absentees and that fines will
be imposed as provided for by the code. The
divisions will turn out as a battery.
Oi Saturday, July 3, the Camanche will
leave her moorings for her initial cruise in
command of the battalion officers and manned
by members of the battalion. It is expected
that there will be a large attendance, for there
will be much drill of a beneficial nature and
the organization will have an opportunity to
prove its nautical character. It is intended
that tha cruise shall be within the bay of San
FrancisÂ«o and its tributaries and will extend
over Sunday, the 4th, and Monday, which will
be a legAl holiday.
An effort will be made to recruit the divis
ions of the battalion to the full membership
that is 104 officers and men.
To-morrow night the bnttalion will have an
extanded order drill on the ar.reckels dock.

Rowing; Regatta.
gatta race yesterday, winning the dia
mond meda! of the CiUb from two com
petitors, Thomas Keenan and W. O.
Patch.
The course lay between Black Point
and Powell-street wharf. It is about
three-fourths of a mile in length. The
start was made at 11:45 a. m., and thÂ« race
took hardly fifteen minutes.
Pape led from the start, with Keenan
second. When Powell-9treet wharf was
reached he *as about rive boat lengths iv
the lead.
Keenan finished second on the return,
about 100 yards behind Pape, notwith
standing the fact that he collided with the
Government vessel Sternberg and was de
layed to some extent.
Captain McDonald of the Sternberg
stood on MeiKgs wharf loudly shouting
for Papa. It was afterward stated as a
''josn" that Keenan tried to knock a ho c
in the vessel.- stern to get even, but the
odds were two great.
A. K'tthkopf acted as referee, Thomas
Sullivan as timer und James Cronin as
clert of the course. The judges were Adam
Schupert, Richard Blennerhasuett and
.Edward Sullivan.
There were two visiting crews present
from the Ariel Club. The occasion was
enhanced in value to the observers by a
fancy ex;,ioitiÂ«.n by Victor Caglieri in an
Indian kyack.
The French steamer Madeline seems to
add to the list of accidents with the regu

The British ship Caradoc, lying off
Union-street, was the scene of two bloody
contests yesterday, which ended in the
arre-t of five seamen, and the first mate,
Robert Ferguson, being treaied at the
Receiving Hospital for a' lacerated wound
on th" left cheek. His eye was also badly
colored.
It is charged that William Flower first
threatened to kill Captain Jones because
he refused to pay the men off, and that be
wasfoicea to lock himself in his state
room. Then Alfred Alexis and George
Watt threatened to kill the mate, and
these three sailors were arrested and taken
to the Harbor po ice station by Officers
Crosby and H. C. Smith.
Later on another row arose between the
mate and two sailors named James Mait-
Jand and Tnomas PZliiott.

YACHTSMEN DODGE DEATH
A Sunday Morning Capsizing, a
Rescue and Silence.
There was a fine ducking of two nice
high-spirited gentlemen in the bay an
hour before church time yesterday morn
ing. The she-t was fast, wind and boat
were both scudding and the tide was rip
ping around Goat Island at the time.
There was a flip, a straddling of a Keel
and a rescue act by the crew of the ferry
boat E:icinal. Then for several hours
there was a vague, wandering, three-crow
story about the water front that a yacht
ing party had been capsized and four peo
ple drowned.
When the Encinal crossed to Alameda
on ber9:ls a. m. trip Captain Hemsworth
swung a little out of his way to pas-i near
an upturned sloop which was seen float
ing with two men on us upturned bot
tom.
The captain had a picnic train to make
connections with and so he just sang out
in a neighborly way that he wouJd'stop
tor way passengers near Goat Inland on
his n r xt trip. The two men who were
suffering a salt water bath in comparative
safety, said "all right," and made the best
of waiting for a ferry-boat.
Coming back the E icinal went after the
men and at an expense of seven m nutes
put out a boat and took tneru oft. One
was a heavy set middle-aged man with
side whiskers and the oihÂ»-r a young man
and both were apparently Alamedans out
for a pleasure sail in a plunger. Neither
would give name or residence or the name
of their sloop and at the ferry Janding
hustled off to avoid fame. The younp
man wanted to hunt up tne lost boat
which the tide was sweeping around Goat
Island toward the Berkeley shore, but
" the boat, I've had enough of her,"
I said the whiskered victim.
They gave no explanation of how the
accident happened, but everybody said
"the sheet was fast" and that must be it.
I Tne victims bad hot whisky in place of an
] inquest.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 24, 1897.
JONES FASTER
THAN ZIEGLER
The Popular Olympian De
feats the "Little Demon"
of San Jose.
He Also Shared With Elford
the Honors in the Open Pro
fessional Events.
J E Wing, the Olympic Amateur,
Was Victorious in His Class
After a H ird Ride.
A well-filled grandstand, a tuneful band
of music and a stiff wind greeted the
cycle racerj at the Velodrome yesterday
afternoon. The two first named features
were quite agreeable, and the latter rather
the reverse, but nevertheless the men
rode spiritedly aud furnished a good day's
sport.
The match races between Allan Jones
and Otto Ziegler Jr. resulted in a victory
for Jones, he winning two of the three
events. The races were well contested
and Jones merited the victory. There
was some talk about Ziegler not being in
shape, but be it said to his credit it did
not emanate from the "Little Demon"
himself. They will have it out again be
fore long, and a return match would be
well worth seeing.
J. E. Wing of the Olympic Wheelmen
had his innings yes terday. After making
fastest time in the Olympic's ten-mile
road race at Ban Leandro in the morning,
he rode in the only amateur event in the
afternoon at the Velodrome and won it
from over twenty other starters after fi p st
qualifying in preliminary and semi-final
heats. Wing is a consistent performer,
and is seldom unplaced in a race.
The first heat of the match races be
tween Jones and Ziegler was the opening
card on the long programme. Clint Coul
ter was put in to pace th<Â» heat, the dis
tance being a half mile. Zie_-ler was first
off, and was never bended, although Jones
made a game and desperate attempt to
pass him on the last turn. The time was
1:0(54-5, very fast considering the strong
wind the riders had to face on the back
stretch.
The distance of the second heat was one
mile. Coulter again paced, and this time
Jones caught first position behind him.
It was again the old story; Jones once in
front is practically unbeatable, for he
led by a full wheel's length at the tape
after a pretty sprint lasting half a lap.
Thf> time was 2:22 3 5.
The third heat of the match race was at
two miles. It was paced by Coulter and
W. S. Dent on a tandem for all but the
lest leap of the disiance. The accidental
discbarge of the starter's pistol made one
false start, and the next time the gun
would not fire, but they finally got away
to a good start, and the tandem drew
them around at a speedy clip, Ziegler get
line first place behind it.
The first mile was covered in 2:23. When
the "print came Ziegler hsd the leari, but
Jones soon drew up alongside of him and
they were on even terms rounding into
the homestretch. Jones continued to
forge ahead and crossed the tape inches
ahead of his opponent. The victory was
a popular one and Jones was liberally ap
piauded. The time for the two miles was
4:40 3-5, the last mile being ridden in
12:162-5.
There were two heats to the half-mile
handicap, professional. In the first H. E.
McCrea, Frank Byine and M. Bleuler
started. McCrea was the virtual scratch
man and enme to the front when he
thought it time, winning in a close finish
with Byrne.
Elford set all the pace in the second
heat, but was outsprinted by Davis, Boy
den running third.
This q'lalifipd Boyden, Elford, Bvrne.
McCrea and Davis for the final. Elfo-d
had a good lead wilh sixty yards handi
cap and ro<ie hard from the very start â so
hard ihat the others cou!d not iatch him.
}\" was materially aided by toe fact that
Boyden was forced to set all the pace for
the back-mark men, none of them offer
ing to relieve him. McCrea jumped out
on the last lap and got second from Davis
in a close finish.
ThÂ» starters in the two-thirds of a mile,
open, professional, were McCrea, Jones,
Bleuler, Boyden, Elford and Davis. It
was run in one heat, nnpaced.
After exchanging pace for three laps,
Bleuler jumped to the front, but was soon
supulanted by Jones, who led all the way
to the tape, closely pursued by Davis and
McCrea. The time was 1:36 2-5.
One of the best fini'hes of the day was
seen in the first heat of the half-mile,
scratch, amateur, Wyman, Motl, Kraft
and Birdcall finishing in the order named
inches aD irt.
Deacon of the Reliance Club won the
second heat, Bozio (Imperial) second.
George Fuller should have been placed,
but was crowded by the inexperience of
another rider on the turns.
Morris Cook won the next brat, with
room to spare, Norton second. Gooch of
Oakland took the fourth heat. Smith
(Acme) second. There was a narrow
escape in this run, Haley and Wing col
liding, apparently from the fault of
neither, so they were both allowed in the
final.
So many had qualified for the final it
was decided to divide it into two sami
finnK Cook and Wyman qualified in the
first semi-final and Deacon, Gooch and
Win?: in the second.
The final whs the prettiest ride of the
day, the five men all crossing the tape in
a bunch. Winer got the decision from
Deacon, Cook third. The time was 1:051-5.
The following is the summary :

and Tris to Enlist H*r
Sympathies-
Evidence seems to be growing, accord
ing to Chief Leei, to Drove that the
hysterical lurches to prove Durranf's in
nocence are infectious. In addition to
the confession of Rosenberg and the silly
story of Captain Bryan of the Colorado
Old Soldiers' Home, the police are now
contending with the efforts of one Tubb,
said to De a lawyer, and described by Mr.
Deuprey as "a young man who means all
right."
Tubb's latest freak is to try to in timid ate
members of the Emanuel Church and
others into signing a petition for Dur
rani's pardon. He seems to have elected
himself a sort of oracular guide for the
defense, having said yesterday : "Darrant
won't bane on the day set, or on any other
day."
Miss Ema Lucille Turner said yester
day: ' Mr. Tubb called on me Tuesday.
He had come, so he said, to give me an
opportunity to tell what 1 knew about the
murder that occurred in Emanuel
Church. He further said that he was go
ing to save Theo ore Durrant at any cost
and that he meunt to make it prstty warm
for the witnesses of the prosecution. He
said he had called on Elmer Wolf and
Pastor Gibson and bad given them the
same chance, but th*t Pastor Gibson in
Irs wisdom had declined to say anything;
and neither did 1, for I've been too lon^
in this case to be bullyragged by any
one."
The next day the story about Elmor
Wolf appeared in the Examiner.
Chief Lees believes the Governor will
not interiere in the case. He is to have a
conference with Governor Budd to-ciay,
and the two will go over the evidence
thoroughly.
"I believe," said the Chief yesterday,
"that the case will be decided any time
between Tuesday and Friday, and I base
my opinion on what the Governor told
me. The more he studies the case the
more fully he will see the defendant had
the widest latitude and the fairest trial
possible."
STABBED IN THE BACK.
Sam Detaettl Injured in an Altercation
at Garibaldi Hall.
Yesterday's festivities in the Latin
quarter of the City wound up wicb blood
spilled on Broadway, iv which Bam De
metti received a knife thrust back of ihe
right shoulder- blade.
As near as could be ascertained from the
excited Italians who participated in an
entertain men t given by the Italian Reali
Oarabinieri Mutual Aid Society, Demetti
tried to gain admission to the hall.
This was reiused by Joseph Merino.who
told him to go away, and at the same time
gave him a shove, and, it is said, followed
it up with a blow of hid hand in which he
held an knife.
Demetti screamed with pain and in
formed his friends that he had been cut.
He wa3 taken to the Receiving Hospital.
It was found that he bad received a stab
back of the right shoulder blade. The
wound is not necessarily fatal, though
painful.
Merino was arrested and charged at the
California street station with an assault to
commit murder.
AFTER THE GOLD

James Brazell Leaves This
City With Seven
Score Miners.
An English Syndicate Under
takes a Big Prospecting
Excursion.
â 
The Kootenay Country Northwest of
Ross 1 an i, B. C, Is to Ba Worked
Systematical y.
Seven years ago English capital was
looking for investment in the mining re
eions of British Columbia. At that time
Jamea BrazelJ, Patrick Kirwin and George
Well*, the well-known engineers, visited
the country about Kootenay and Ross, and,
and pronounced it particularly rich in
gold, silver and copper, the greatest draw
back being the tremendous stratum of
granite, in many instances forty feet thick,
interfering with the work of mining.
Brazell had then a proposition before
the English Government to send out a
party of 1500 prospectors, covering an area
of ten miles through British Columbia in
a northwesterly direction from Rossiand,
the different camps being in constant
communication with the main office of
engineers that would follow along in their
trail.
The cost of such an expedition was such
that the Engli&h or Canadian Eovern
ments wouui nave nothing to do with it,
the hazard being one that ihe Home fcec
retary couid not countenance.
The proposition, however, has met with
the approval of a syndicate of English
capitalists who believe in its merits suf
ficiently to send forth 150 men irom this
City to work the English torritory.
These miners, at the head of whom is
James Brazell. left on the overland train
last evening for Oregon. They are all
men picket! from the heads of depart
ments in the mines of the Comstock
whero Brazell was superintendent of the
Bullion and other mines in ihe days of
the bonanza.
"I beÂ»ieve that the country about
Kootenay," said Brazell yesterday after
noon, "is one 01 the richest on the face of
the globe. There is a great deal of terri
tory to coyer and 1 think that with a suffi
cient number of men who know their bus
iness I can eventually locate the entrance
to at least such another bonanza as we
found twenty-five years ogo in Nevada. 1
am starting with only 150 men. They
will be divided into prospecting camps
and cover the territory as speedily as pos
sible, so as to find a proper starting point.
If I had 1500 men. as I first demanded, I
could move along more speedily, but I
urn well satisfied wiib the number I have
got. 1 feel assured in my own mind that
before ninety days pass over I will have
enough work ahead of me to bring up
1000 miners from California."
The Universe solidified Music.
The Bri'.hmncbarin Bodabhiskshu delivered
the first of a series of four lectures on the gen
eral principles of theosophy last night at Na
tive Sons' Hall. His. subject was 'â¢Self and Its
Manifestations." The beginning of all thine*,
ne said, was a sound, and the universe is sol
idified music. Sound, vibration, motion, color
âall Bre one thinn- Tiie conception of the
iiiom is but a chemist's dream, lot the atom
can be analyzed into vi orations, and matter is
but ivtardtd motion. Science has proved that
music is convertible into geom -trie lorms. All
selfishness is but a putting of one's self in dis
cord with the music of the universe and
brings its own punishment.

"EXTREMELY CRITICAL."
Postmast 3 r McCoppin's Condition
as Reported by Dr.
Rosens irn.
Frank McCoppin, Postmaster of San
Francisco, who has been confined to his
rooms for several weens on account of
sickness, submitted to a surgical operation
yesterday. Dr. Julius Rosenstirn per
formed the operation.
The doctor was asked concerning the
prospects of the restoration of Mr. Mc-
Coppin's health, and after consultation
with those most interested in tbe Post
master's recovery, said the patient was
resting as easily as could be expected
after the operation that he had under
gone.
Few men are better known in San Fran
cisco than Frank McCoppin. He made
an excellent Mayor of the City and his |
administration of municipal affairs is fre- i
qnently mentioned as the best that was]
ever Riven to the public. As State Senator
in the Legislature he secured i he enact
ment of what is known as the one-twehth
act. Ab United States Commissioner to
the exposition in Australia he rendered
acceptable service. He was appointed
Postmaster of San Francisco by President
Cleveland and he has yet one year to
serve before his term of four years expires.
His hea.ih has been so badly impaired
durinu the past lew months that he has
not been abie to devote much attention
to h:s official duties.
At 11 o'clock last night Dr. Rosenstirn
said in response to a message of inqu ry
concerning Mr. McCoppin's condition,
"The patient is resting easy." When
asked if Mr. McCoppin's condition was
critical the pnysician said: "It is ex
tremely critical."
Dr. Rosenstirn was not authorized to
SDeak of the nature of the surgical opera
tion performed yesterday.
At 2 o'clock this morning Dr. Rosen
stirn reported that no change had taken
place and that his patient was resting
easily-
