EL PASO, Tex.. May 28.â El Paso is to
night another Venice. Its streets are
transformed by the swollen waters of the
Rio Grande into surging rivers whose
floods are destroying everything in their
path. One-third of the city is submerged,
not less than a thousand buildings have
been destroyed or badly damaged and
nearly 5000 persons have been driven from
their homes. To-night it is estimated
that 2500 men, women and children are.
absolutely shelterless, depending upon
charity for food.
For three weeks the flood has been
gradually encroaching upon the city,
despite the constant efforts of the rail
roads, the city authorities and private in
dividuals to stent the tide. Hundreds of
houses had already been destroyed, when
yesterday afternoon came the grind catas
trophe. At 3 o'clock the levee gave way
at the head of the irrigating canal which
taps the Rio Grande one mile north
of the city. The waters poured through
in a relentless torrent which swept every
thing before it, and in a few hours con
verted that portion of the city east of El
Paso street and south of Overland into a
vast lake uotted with the crumbling homes
of the poor.
When the back-water reached the al
ready overtaxed embankments opposite

rent poured without hindrance into the
city until 9 o'clock this morning, when the

embankment which protected the Texas
and Pacific tracks, giving the waters an
opportunity to spread over the lowland.
lying east of the city. Then the tide be
gan to recede slowly, and at midnight had
fallen ten inches below the highest point
of the day. It is the worst flood in El
Paso's history. The Rio Grande, which a
few weeks ago was a puny rivulet scarcely
covering a span of fifteen feet, is now. a
mighty stream more than a mile wide, y.
The suffering and a large portion of the
financial loss, which already amounts to a
quarter of a million, foils upon the poorer
portion of the community, although some
of the best residences of the city are in
cluded in the flooded district.
Almost the entire Mexican population
have lost their homes, their adobe houses
offering no resistance, to the rush of the
torrent. When the ringing of the fire
bells gave warning, that the levee had
broken, all the inhabitants of the lower
portion of the town made a grand rush for
the bills, taking with them what few val
uables they could carry. As the Mexican's
first thought is for his Oog**, and his sec
ond tor his goat, his pig or his fighting
cock, the procession presented many
laughable as well as pitiable aspects.
Every available team in the city was
promptly pressed into service hauling
away the household effects of such homes
as could be reached, and the work was
kept up all through last night and to-day.
The thousands of icfugees spent the night
on the hills in the northern portion of the
city, without shelter and almost without
food.
Early this morning a hastily organized
relief committee set to work, and nearly
half the homeless have been provided for
in such vacant structures as were avail
able, or given shelter by their friends.
Forty Government tents were sent by, the
commandant at Fort Bliss, and the build
ing* of the abandoned post north of the
city have been placed at the disposal of the
relief committee by the military authori
ties. Cnaritabie citizens distributed pro
visions among the flood victims to-day,
but the suffering was only partly miti
gated and it has been decided to ask the
Texas Legislature for aid.
â¢ The future is no* without forebodings
of worse to come. While the river is fail
ing here and .it points above to-night, it is
higher than ever at Santa Fe and is still
rising. Every effort will be ma c to
shield the city against further disaster be
fore the next rush of water reaches here.
A large force is at work attempting to
close the crevasses at the head of the canal
and ail the levees protecting the city will
be strengthened as rapidly as possible. The
Santa Fe road has been washed out for
several days at Selden, thirty miles north,
rind its trains are running over the tracks
of the Southern Pacific. Trie latter road
was the first sufferer by the flood and was
only able to resume traffic by building a
lemporary line around the submerged dis
trict.
There is a rumor to-night that some of
the flood victims, believing their misfor
tunes to be due to lack of energy, on the
part of the city officials, are threatening to
tut the embankment which protects the
Lome of Mayor Magoffin. Preparations
have been made to frustrate any attempt
of the Kind, should it be made. Wj^j^
The Texas Pacific Railway had thrown
up a dyke to protect its track near the
roundhouse. This backed the water up

street and flood hundreds of the prettiest
residences in tbe city.
Six prominent citizens, headed by Col
lector of Customs Davis, armed them
selves with Winchesters and, crossing
over the railroad levee, they cut it. , The
backwater began to recede from San An
t "iiio street. The railroad people repaired
th.' levee. It was again orderea cut by
Mayor Magoffin. Early this morning a
party of Mexican guards appeared at the
headgate of the canal on the American
side and told one workman they intended
to cut away the headgate to afford relief
on the other side. The Mexicans were
told they would be ehot if they touched
the American embankment and were or
dered back to the Mexican side.
NO JOY FOR THE IRISH.
Nationalist Members of the Commons
Dec.de Not to Pcr'lcipaio in the
Jubilee Celebration.
LONDON, Eng., May 28.â John Dillon,
leader of the anti-Parnellite section of
the Irish parliamentary party, presided
10-day at a largely attended meeting of
Nationalist members of the House of
Commons. A manifesto was nnauimously
adopted declaring the Irish parliamentary
party unable to participate in the celebra
tions in honor of the Queen's long reign.
Ireland had no cause to rejoice in the
Queen's reign. For sixty years the country
had been governed against its will under
a centralized autocratic system, though
the bonds of freedom had been widened
elsewhere in the empire. The manifesto
says misgovernment, famine and evic
tions have driven millions of the Irish
from their homes. The population of
Ireland has been reduced 'half, while
Great Britain's population has doubled
during Victoria's reign. Even for the di
minished number the Irish scale of sub
sistence is inferior and their physical
condition has been impaired, while the
country has been loaded with taxation
beyond its relative capacity.

Try In Vain to Capture the
Cuban Chief.
HAVANA, Cuba. May 28.â Details have
been received of an engagement at La
Reforma, Sancti Spiritus, between the
Spaniards, commanded by Weyler in per
son, and the Cubans under Gomez. The
battle was fought early last weekend was
the result of Weyier's scheme to crush
Gomez by surrounding him with 20,000
men. The plan failed and the battle was
reported here as an ordinary Spanish
victory without details. It is the first
time in the war that Gomez and Weyler
have faced one another.
After passing to the west and entering
the province of Matanzas Gomez, in ac
cordance with his usual tactics, proceeded
to Santa Clara, where he has remained
several months circumventing the projects
of many Spanish columns sent against
him. Weyler, with a column of 5000 men,
marched against Gomez at La Reforma,
and ordered two other Spanish columns
of 2000 men each to join him at The west
ern end of that estate., Thus 9000 men
were to be added to the forces already
operating against. Gomez, and which, to
gether with those along Juncuro-Moron
trochas made a total of 20,000. Farther
west in Santa Clara Wes'ler has 20,000
men. According to his plans this second
army was to prevent another advance by
Gomez into Matanzas province. Weyler
in this position thought the Cuban leader
would ba forced to retire in the direction
of the trocha, where his chances of escap
ing would be slight.
Gomez, placing his men in the best
strategic positions at La Reforma.
awaited Weyier, and for six hours held
him in check. Three times the Cubans
charged with machetes, and on the first
charge Weyier's left flank was completely
routed. Weyier's horse * was wounded
three times. Gomez ordered the best shots
to pursue the Spanish general, but the
latter never came to the front. Notwith
standing this fact he had a narrow escape.
When two fresh Spanish columns came
to aid Weyler Gomez retired to Central
Partake, while the Spanish abandoned the
field and returned to Sancti Spiritus.
The Spanish official reports say that
sixty-five soldiers were killed and many
wounded. It is alleged .by the Spanish
here that the commander of the Cubans
was Brigadier Jose Gomez, not General
Maximo Gomez, and so the report of the
engagement failed to attract attention. y
In tbey province of Matanzas Governor
Porcet prepared a pi -in to murder or cap
ture Dr. Pedro Betancourt, the well
known Cuban general. A traitor named
Andricain was going to join the forces
of Betancourt and either snoot the Cuban
leader or lure him into ambush Betan
court knew of the plot and ordered his
men to hang Andricain* as soon as he
came into camp. He was promptly
hanged. . -;

LONDON, Exg., May 28.â The Constan

Post telegraphs that the embassies there
have received aovices from the legations

is in a critical position. King George is
virtually barricade 1 in his palace, and it is
said he is preparing to leave the country.
The relations between the King and the
Cabinet are much strained. The general
situation is most serious.
The National Review publishes a signifi

which it says: "King George committed
a blunder in consenting to remain King

How much more kingly would he have

Interesting: Developments During*

LONDON, Esq.,' May 20â There was a
sparse attendance in the House of Com
mons to-day when the debate on the ques
tion of voting funds for Irish harbors and
lighthouses was taken up. The discussion
proceeded quietly until John E. Redmond,
Parnellite leader, suddenly interrupted
the debate and moved the discussion of
the Irish financial relations and griev
ances in preference to other matters.
. i Redmond was repeatedly called to order,
out refused to desist and finally Charles T.
Ritchie, president ot. the Board of Trade,
moved tbat Redmond be srspended.* The
motion' created considerable excitement,
and the House was soon crowded with

Redmond left the floor and went into
the gallery as if to defy the House. The
Speaker, who alone has. the power to
order a person to withdraw from the .pre
cincts of the House, was not in the chair
at the time, but was sent lor and as soon
as he appeared ordered Redmond to with
draw. Redmond complied.
The debate on the vote for Irish harbors
and lights was then resumed, but again
interrupted by John J. Clancy, Parnellite
member for North Dublin County, who
insisted upon the discussion of the same
questions which Redmond had sought to
have debated. He was called to order,
but refused to obey the ruling of the
Deputy; Speaker. He was then ordered
by the Deputy Speaker to withdraw, and
upon his refusal the sergeant : at- arms was
directed to use whatever 'force necessary
to compel Clancy- to leave the floor.
Clancy then made his exit, being con

TURKEY OBJECTS TO ANGELL.
The N:wlyy Appointed United States
Minister in ; Too Close Touch With
y Christian- Missionaries.
, .WASHINGTON,. D. C. j May Â£B.â The
Turkish Government ha* made formal ob
jection to receiving Dr. Frank B. Angell
of < Michigan; as Minister .*â¢ of the United
States; The ground for the rejection can
hot be definitely ascertained, but it is
said that the Porte does not "want a
diplomatic representative of tins country
in close touch and sympathy with the
Christian missionary element in the
Sultan's possessions, and who strongly
disapproves of the action of the Porte in
the Armenian massacres.
" ' Moustapha Bey, Turkish Minister here,
has notified Secretary Sherman of the ob
jection of his Government to Angell. As
an intimation of that character puts an
end to the matter, Angeil cannot go to
Constantinople in a diplomatic capacity.
Every Government recognizes the right of
any other Government to refuse to receive
any. objectionable diplomatic representa
tive. yy 7Jjjr...j7. j\.7.r .*â  â¢*-â  â '.â¢*
The United States has twice within re
cent years had two of its envoys rejactVd
by foreign j countries. ' Kediey was ob
jectionable .to j Austria because, his wife
was a Hebrew, and ex-Senator Henry W.
Blair, after being nominated by Harrison
for the Chinese mission and confirmed by
the Senate, was compelled to stay at
home on account of personal objections
of the Chinese Government because of ut
terances uncomplimentary to China de
livered by him in the Senate in a speech
on the exclusion bill.
The nomination of Dr. Angell was con
firmed by the Semite some time ago.; He
paid Washington a visit shortly; after his
appointment, and an interview obtained
with; him while on his way here quoted
him with reference to the war between
Turkey and Greece. This interview^ may
be one of the causes for the objection of
the Porte, as it praised the Greeks highly.
Angell came to Washington a few days
ago, presumably to receive final instruc
tions before leaving lor Constantinople.
When Angell was nominated on April 14
it was said that he would beintrnstei
with duties of a special character. What
these duties were â is not public property,
but it is hinted that they related to repre
sentations to be made about Armenian
massacres, and would probably result in a
promise by the Porte of greater security
to Christians in the Sultan's domain.
DAViD C. ROBINSON INDICTED.
The Ex-Mayor ot Eimira Charged With

. NEW YORK, N.Y.. May 28.â The Grand
Jury has indicted David C. Robinson,
ex-Mayor.of Elmira and son of the 'late
Governor Lucius Robinson, on a charge of
grand .larceny in the first degree. The
complainant is the Mutual Life Insurance
Company. The specific amount involved
is â  $30,000. i Assistant â¢ District Attorney
Lindsay stated the case as follows:
"Robinson was indicted on a charge of
obtaining by false pretenses from the Mu
tual Life $30,000 in August, 1892. He put
in an application to the insurance com
pany for a loan for that amount in the
name of Robert W. Bush, a resident of
Elmira. 'Robinson a; that time was attor
ney for the Erie Railroad, and also acted'
as the general agent tor the insurance

he filed the application for the $30,000 loan
hat he was really the * owner of property;
to a value represented to be $94,000,' but
really only $4000. A few months ago fore
closure proceedings were brought and then
the value of the property came out."
Deiancy Nicoll, counsel for "tne insur

During the afternoon exercises, were held
at all the schools, pupils of the primary,
grammar and high schools all participat

tures were Introduced into the pro

day was equally enjoyable to the pupils
who participated and to the veterans and
visitors who listened. 'â -â¢;. J7' 7
; And the veterans â bow they enjoyed
the day ! "Why, they sent us to the schools
to tell them about Lincoln," said one old
soldier 'enthusiastically, "but we learned
more, about, the great martyr from those
children than we ever knew before."
Clad in their uniforms of blue and wear
ing their badges and medals upon their
breasts their countenances fairly beamed
as they repeated the stirring reminiscences
of *â¢:â  the war or listened to the childish,
voices : singing the songs that they bad
sung many years before around their
camptires in the South..
â¢ The exercises at the Girls' High School
auditorium in the evening attracted a
large and enthusiastic audience, which:
frequently interrupted the speakers with
vigorous applause. Upon the platform
were seated: General Barnes, Hon. H. C.
Dibble, Judge Coones:, Professor Elisha*
Brooks, School Directors Head, Armor
and Bantel. W. D. Howe, F. J. Peck, W.

The large platform was tastefully dec
orated with flags and arms. A tent
pitched at one corner* of the stage and
scattered stacks of muskets, upon which
were hung belts and sabers, gave the plat
form the appearance of a real army camp.
Flag-draped busts of Washington and
Lincoln occupied the. central portion of
the stage, and just behind the speaker's
stand was placed a large portrait of the
great martyr. â  yJ''JJ
\ The main body of the hall and the front
of the gallery were also becomingly dec
orated with American flags and small
multi-colored standards.
Long before the meeting was called to
order the hall was filled. Ladies consti
tuted a large portion of the audience, and.
many childish faces were to be seen in the
throng. Evidently the ladies and the
children are taking a leading part in the
movement to honor the memory of the
great emancipator. Veterans from the
various posts of the G. A. R. were out in
great numbers with their blue uniforms
and white gloves, and their badges pinned
upon their breasts.
Prolonged applause greeted the speak
er^ and veterans as they marched onto the
stage. Principal Elisha ' Brooks of the
Girls' High School then introduced a**
chairman of the evening Hon. James D.
Phelan, Mayor of San Francisco. The
Mayor spoke as follows:
I have been selected as presiding officer this
evening, and as I understand it, I am to intro
duce the speakers and not to speak. I come,
therefore, not to speak, but to listen. Bui
is one of tbe duties 01 a chairman to state the
purposes of the meeting.
We come here ; to-night to do honor to one
whose services merit the greatest love and
gratefulness of the people of the country.
And no character. is so eminently fitted to be
held up before the youth of this City as an ob
ject lesson. :*-;.-.-
. Before . Abraham Lincoln we all become
hero-worshipers, and when we worship at
his shrine we worship more than the man, wo
worship at the very shrine of liberty.
Before the speakers were introduced
"The Star-spangled Banner" was sung by
a quartet from the Loring Club. The next
number on the programme was a selection
by the Mills Quartet, whose artistic ren
dering called forth prolonged applause.;
In the absence of President Barrington
of the â  Board of v- : Education â¢ Chairman
Phelan called upon School Director Head,
who spoke as follows:
On behalf of the Board of Education I thank
you for; your attendance here this eve Ding.
From the showing made to-day in the public
schools, . 1 know . that the veterans who so
kindly visited the *; schools saw . and ap
preciated ' the work that the} teachers have
been 'doing 'for months past . in impressing
upon I the . children ',- the nobility '.of * the char
acter and life of Abraham Lincoln, and I want
to extend to-night to the Grand Army vet
erans, those noble heroes, : the thanks of the
School Department for making a success of
to-day's celebration.
'After the rendition of a selection by. the
Loring Club quartet General W. "H. L.
Barnes was introduced as tho most elo
quent speaker in San Francisco.
In the ; course of his address General
Barnes said:
;It never remember experiencing, so much
emotion as I experienced this afternoon at the
Clement Grammar School. I understood that
we veterans were Ât o â¢ tell the children about
Abraham Lincoln; but I found that even the
smallest of them knew almost more than Iwe2
did ourselves. And when I heard their patri
otic songs and witnessed their simple saluta
tion to the flag I felt grateful to whomsoever it
was that first thought of celebrating Lincoln
day.
In the drawings upon the blackboards at
the school, inartistic, perhaps, as they may
have been, I could see the patriotism that the
":4ittle artists felt. And well may they b=; patri
"otic. For when the inhabitants of Norway and
Sweden, and the desolate regions of the north
display such patriotism as they do. why should
not an American boy or girl be justly proud
of his or her American citizenship.
No man loves his country as he ought until
he stops to think o: the things about him ;
and the exercises held in the schools to-day
will do more than aught . else to impress upon
the children the patriotism and love of their
glorious* country and glorious flag. And we
should be gratefu:, indeed, to the- teachers
who have so unselfishly iabortd to make the
celebration of Lincoln day a success.
i We ta _ oi the miracle: ot the loaves and
fishes, the miracle of turning water iuto wine,
but a greater miracle, still. more wondrous
tnan any in the sacred story, was the life of j
such a man us Abraham Lincoln; a life with
out inspiration and in is origin. almost, with
out hope. 1 once had ihe pleasure of meet
ing Abraham Lincoln, '-' on the occasion
of his arrival from Springfield for lis in,
auguration. He was, 1 thought, the queer
est looking mortal 1' ever saw. He was I
think, the most unfashionable looking
man 1 had ever seen. His hair looked as if he
had not combed it since he left Springfield;
hi-, clothes had a- million wrinkle;., *\.d, in'
short, he was the most unkempt individual 1 j
had ever beheld. When I looked .it him I said
to myself, "Can .that, be the man Wpoin a great
people have selected to lead them?"
We sat down with Mr. Lincoln at the dinner
table and "Mr." Lincoln ate. And he ate and'
ate. I never before or since have entertained
such respect lor any man* internal capacity
as 1 did for his. Alter dinner Mr. Lincoln be
gan to talk. -He talked ol the stale of me
Union, and bjiore our. party broke up. with
tne breaking of the dawn of that Washington
morning we .heard la.ll from his dps such
words of wisdonfas seldom have fallen from
the lips of men.
Once more i heard hrm speakâ on the occa- j
sion oi j his inaugurationâ when I stood less j
than twenty feet from where he was.
' Ivev^r *?ince the word was made were there
two grander spectac.es than Lincoln siguiug I
the Emancipation Proclamation and General
Grant wnen at Appomatox he dismissed that
baud of meu'who had devastated the land lor
four years; when he sent the soldiers of the
Confederacy heme with their horses to plow
their fields'; when be gave them the rations
thai he ii* d brought for his own soldiers. No
grander figures man Abraham Lincoln and
Ulysses S. Grant ever appeared upon the stage
of Tinman action.* - * '* â¢â¢
Friends, do we appreciate the blessing we
enjoy as we should '.' Ah, I lear not. Not
until we had lost them would we realize What
we ha.l lost. If. the God who hes filled to-night
the vault above with the myriads of stars
should blot them from, human sight for a
thousand year's, how we woutd then mourn'
the lack ot appreciation we had shown of
their celestial brilliance. And so it is with
oar country. While .we have and enjoy the
"blessings of liberty and happiness whicn our
country gives us we do not fully appreciate
them. But ft is by such exercises as have been
held to-day; it is by learning to revere such'
characters as Abraham Lincoln that we shall
come to appreciate more fully the blessiugs
with wnicn we are surrounded.
A solo by Miss Maude Fay followed.
After an encore, in response to a generous
applause, the cbaiiman introduced as the
next speaker Hon. Henry C. Di6ble, who
spoke in part as follows:
You do tot expect much of me alter listen
ing to the eloquence of my distinguished com
rade, whom the Mayor has so fittingly styled
the most eloquent orator in our midst. He is
our poet-orator, and after listening to his
beautiful and touching description of the
â¢character of Abranam Lincoln I .can do ;
little more than bear testimony as one
of the survivors of that great body
'of volunteers called into existence by Abra
ham Lincoln's edict, it is my privilege to add
my word of reverence to one of the greatest
wen who have ever lived; the greatest, as I
' believe, of all the characters of history.
Where in all your readings, my 'mends, j
can you find a more vivid and charming de- |
scription of Lincoln as he appeared betore the j
wor.d than that given by my comrade, Gen- I
eral Barnes, who saw in person Abraham Lin
coln when he arrived in Washington to take
charge of the -great Government at whose
head he hed been placed.
1 had sought in the lile.ot Lincoln an inci
dent most characteristic of the great President.
Ltttle or no mention has been made in the
lories of.the wonderful event la Lincoln's
life that I refer M the figure of Lincoln at
Richmond so soon before his tragic death.
From the account wr Men by my fellow
veteran. Comrade Backus, who was one of the
detail accompanying. Lincoln as he walked
through the streets of burning Richmond, I
hÂ«ve read of the occurrence.
As Lincoln walked through the. ember
strewn streets, th" black lreedmen, slaves no j
longer, fell at his feet and uttered in reverent
'tones: "Lincoln nas come, the savior has j
' come."
When there was a wide-spread opinion j
throughout the world that the American Re
public was but an experiment, and an experi- !
ment likely to fail, wnen is was declared that ,
the victory of the Southern Confederacy wou d !
demonstrate thai a Government based upon
liberty couid not stand, how it must have
made Abraham Lincoln thrill with emotion i
when he made universal freedom an accom
plished fact.
There are but a few of us veterans left here
in this City. We shall soon be gone, but we
ask of you, and we know we will not ask in
vain, to give us yonder in Golden Gate Park a
suitable monument of the great emancipator.
We are certain that you will." We feel that
the Lincoln monument is an assured success.
When we see such a grand demonstration of
affectionate sentiment as has been exhibited in
' ihe schools .-day we cannot but believe that
p. fitting u.oirihieiit will be erected iv Abra
ham Lincoln's honor. .., *
After a vocal selection, "The Vacant
Chair." by the Loring Club quartet,
Judge M. Cooney, the last speaker of the
evening, was introduced. He said:
When the names of kings and princes are
forgotten the name of Abraham Lincoln will
remain fresh in the minds of every man and
woman in this country. Lincoln, let me sum
marize, was a Solomon in war, a Washington
in peace, and now aud forever In the hearts of
his countrymen.
1 would add but a few words to the previous
speakers' in regard to the Lincoln monument
movement. We want the woÂ»k of the league
to go further than the erection of the monu
ment in Golden Gate Park. And until Lin
coln day shall have been declared a National
holiday the work of the Lincoln Monument
League of California will not cease.
. The evening's exercises concluded with
a realistic tableau, "Tenting To-night on
the Old Campground," in which the fol
lowing veterans, uniformed and armed,
took part :
Comrades Price, Wilson, Storey, Mc-
, Crone and Loane of Lincoln Post and
James Riley of Cass Post. The .Mills
Quartet sang, "We are tenting to-night on
tne old; campground," and as they sang
softly the words of the la<t verse,
"dying to-night on the old campground,"
two ot the veterans appeared upon the
stage bearine the body of a comrade. The
tableau closed with the veterans bendinz,
with heads uncovered, over the motionless
body of -their fellow-soldier. '*.'*'
At tha conclusion of the tableau the
Mayor adjourned the meeting and the
audience dispersed. ( â '

Addresses were made by the following
comrades from the C. A. R. posts -Major
Sherman, Commander Mass of Lincoln
Post. Chaplain Macomber, United States
army. Commander H. W. Mortimer and-
Frank Elliot Myers, chaplain of Garfield
Post.
In the course of bis remarks Major
Sherman referred to the Lincoln School
building and its fond associations.
"1 remember," heÂ« said, '.'when the roof
of your building burned off how; every
loyal heart felt the sharpest of pangs that
any injury should befall a building hai
lowed.'as it seemed to us, uy the name of
Lincoln.' Acain, when some vandal,
crazed with drink, came forth from some
neighboring saloon and broke off an arm
from the statue of Lincoln which so hon
orably distinguishes the front of your
building there was not a loyal member of
any Grand Arm post in all this City who
would not have joined in hanging the mis
creant from the nearest lamppost. ,
"Boys, you can never know the deep
and tender and supremely earnest feeling
that thrills the heart of every member of
every post, in the Grand Army of this City
as well as of the â¢ whole country at the
mention of the name of Lincoln."
Chaplain M acorn ber related the follow
ing touching reminiscence . of the great
President : "..'â â ;.
>' After Lee's surrender a number of us
lay in the hospital at City Paint, Borne
of us had lain there since the last charge
at Petersburg. I was among them. His
tall form and loving face bent over every
one of us. .Not one did he pass by. And
to' every one he had some wo*d of cood
cheer tenderly spoken, while his homely
face 1 became absolutely beautiful as it
beamed with love and sympathy. He
would say to each, ' God bless you, my
boy! Keep up a good heart. You'll come
through 'all right. We'll never forget
you!' Ah, I tell you, boys, we felt like
reaching up our weak arms to clasp his
neck yes, even to press our lips to his
rough cheek. We all felt impatient to get
well as fast as possible that we might
light as never before for our President,
the great heart who came to cheer and
love" us while we lay disabled from our
wounds." .;.-'";
Past Grand Commander Mortimer of
Lincoln Post spoke in part as follows of
Lincoln's respect for woman :
'No man ever drew the breath of life
who. had a more profound respect for
woman than Abraham Lincoln. You re
member that when he received the news
of his nomination hiÃ first word was,
'There is a little woman over to our house
who would Hke to hear about this. I'm
going home to tell her now.' And, again,
later in life when he had been President
a lull term, he said to some gentlemen at
the close of an earnest conversation, 'All
that I am in this world I owe to my
sainted mother!'
Professor Knowlton, vice-principal of
the school, closed with a rattling, ringing
speech. The boys received him with
hearty hand-clapping before he had
spoken, punctuated his speech with more
and gave him a crowning salvo at the
close. Among other good points he said
that Lincoln arose from the humblest to
the highest. Starting" lower than any
other great American he .rose to the very
highest pinnacle of earthly nobility, and
thence stepped level forth upon the floor
of heaven.
More than any other in all our history
his example cheers and stimulates the
humbly born sons of poverty and honest
toil.
Most of the exercises at the Washington
Grammar School were held in the yard,
whicn was tilled with the pupils and
numerous visitors. In addition to an
excellent programme of music and recita
tions a stirring address was delivered by
W. E. Reade of Lincoln Post.
A pretty feature of the exercises at the
Whittier Primary School was the "Com
parison Between Washington and Lin
coln" by two divisions of Miss Suragu'e's
class. Lincoln's boyhood and manhood
were recited somewhat similarly by a
number of pupils, each reciting a sentence
or two. Joseph Steele,* Uri McKee, John
Dessicker and other Grand Army com
rades delivered addresses.
A programme of unusual merit was
given by the classes of the Cooper School. â 
At the Mission Grammar School the dif
ferent classes rendered programmes that
reflected great credit upon both pupils and
teachers.
One of the prettiest features of the pro
gramme at the Elison . Primary School
was an acrostic, "Lincoln," by seven pupils
of Mrs. Steele's "class, Nellie Roberts,
Jesse Barnett, Maud O'Neil, Gerard
Dower, George Hansen, Luetta Bay and
Jessie Lowe. Another unique feature was
the 'Address to the Union Dog," in which
a number of boys addressed a big mastiff
dog that had been brought upon the plat
form.
At the James Lick Grammar there is no
school hall, so the exercises were held in
the different classrooms. Sketches of
Lincoln's life and quotations from his
speeches were varied by class songs and
patriotic recitations. Besides the ad
dresses of me veterans, were remarks by
School Director Hammond to the differ-
classes.
A number of excellent essays "on Lin
coln's life and character were read at the
Falrmount School. At the Haight Pri
mary, on Mission, near Twenty-sixth,
one of the most interesting numbers was
the Soldier's Hymn, by Irene Hastings,
an indefatigable little worker of the Lin
coln Monument League. "Abraham's
Work," by Robert Dodds and Chester
McLean, was also prettily rendered.
The Burnett School presented an un
usually attractive and entertaining Lincoln
programme. The looms were decorated
very tastefully, pictures of Lincoln being
everywhere entwined with ivy and gar
lands of red/white and blue flowers.
Veteran W. W. Stone, G. A. R., and presi
dent of the Lincoln Monument League,
made the closing remaikÂ«. In a few brief
but impressive words, Mr. Stone dwelt
upon the purpose for which this day had
been set apart and urged upon his young
hearers the necessity of living an upright
life. "No matter how bumble the circum
stances of birth and parentage," he con
cluded. "He whom we are met to-day to
honor rose to the highest position that
our country could offer him, but better
still he will remain enshrined in all hearts
as the savior of his country."
A feature of the programme rendered at
the Franklin Grammar School was the
excellent music. A number of duets,
quartets and choruses were executed in a
most skillful and enjoyable manner.
At the Eternal Primary School a scarf
drill, "The Red, White and Blue." by the
pupils of Miss Howard and Miss Httyden,
produced a very artistic effect.
Besides a number of veterans there were
two representatives from Seven Pines
Circle, Mrs. Angie Ayres and Mrs. Lylia
C. Hinckley, present at the Everett Pri
mary School. A number of interesting
Lincoln anecdotes formed an enjoyable
feature of the exercises.
y. At the Crocker Grammar School
speeches were made by a number of vet
erans, and by Presid nt Birnngton -and
Director Carew of the Board of Education.
In all of the other schools of the. City
programmes of equal merit were pre
sented, each school having its own unique
and appropriate features.

TILLAMOOK WfiEOK.
Captain Hanson'** License Suspended
for Thirty Days for Neglect.
United States Local Inspectors: Bolles
and Phillips have rendered a report on
the wreck of the steamer Tillamook on a
rock near Lhetco Cove, Or., on April 26,
1897.
They found that the damage to the
steamer was about $300 and to the cargo
none.
The report proceeds to say:
After careful consideration of the evidence
we are of the opinion that Captain Louis Han
sen was negligent in his navigation of the
steamer Tillamook on April 20 last by leav
ing the steamer in charge of the second mate
and trusting to the judgment of the later to
run the vessel at a safe distance off shore
along that dangerous coast and keep her off
the rocks.
Therefore, under authority conferred upon
us by section 4450, U. S. Revised Statutes, for
reason of such negligence we have this date
suspended the license of Captain Louis Han
sen as master and pilot of steam vessels for the
period of thirty days. :

TRIAL OF SEARLES
NOW UNDER WAY
Points in the Havemeyer
Case Reopened for
Argument.
Defense Contends That Con
gress Has No Power to I
Investigate.
Caustic Reply of the Prosecution.
Great Surprise Caused by an
Adjournment.'
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.â
trial of John. E. Searles, charged with re
fusing to answer certain questions before
the special committee of the Senate in
vestigating the sugar scandal, was begun
thin morning before Justice Bradley.
Kavemeyer was present, paying the same
attention to the case that he did to his
own. y
Assistant District Attorney Baker out
lined the case of the Government. Attor
ney Davis then presented the papers of
record which had been offered in the
Havemeyer case and counsel lor the de
fense admitted the papers without objec
tion, it being tacitly agreed that the case
should be decided on the point brought
up yesterdayâ the right of the committee
to put the questions which Searles de
clined to answer. '. ,
Baker read from that committee's re
port how Searles had refused to answer
Allen's question, "What amount was ex
pended by your company in campaign
contributions during 1892?" on the ground
that the committee was not authorized to
ask it.
Lawyer Johnson, for the defense, tnen
read long extracts from the committee re
port, after which Senator Gray, the com
mittee's chairman, testified that he be
lieved Searles bad not been informed that
the committee insisted on a reply when
he refused to answer Allen's question.
The Government closed its case after
Gray's testimony and Johnson moved a
verdict of acquittal on the following
grounds: First, that the questions were
relevant to nothing concerning which the
committee could have been supposed to
have been ordered to inquire into. Second,
that if there was any contempt it was not
contempt of the committee, but of Allen.
Third, that the committee had no right to
put the questions.
In arguing these points Johnson said:
"Even if it had been shown that contri
bution had been made for the purpose of
corruption, and that the sugar trust main
tained a fund for this purpose, what could
the Ssnate or Congress do about it? The
proper place for trial and punishment
should be in the courts of the State of
New York. Even if millions of dollars
had been contributed the legislature of
the United Stale* could not investigate or
punish the company or it? officials for
making such contributions. Having been
told* there, were contributions they have
reached r the limit of their right to ques
tion.' unless these contributions weie
made for corrupt purposes. Mr. Searles
answered a question -"-regarding connec
tions alleged to have existed between Sen
ators ami the trust, and there h.s respon
sibility ended." yy;
Davis, in replying, maintained that it
was the right of the senate to probe as
deeply, as possible to disclose corruption
in the election of its members. Davis sug
gested that it the rules of questioning ac
cording to common law be applied to all
Senate investigations there is great dan
ger of them all coming to nothing. He
elaborated on this point, which was one
of the strongest he has yet made. In
vestigating, he said, came from "es
pionage," and was intended to find foot
steps which might lead somewhere and
not to be found by the ordinary methods
of procedure. This contention, Davis
said, had been sustained by the Supreme
Court Several times.
Johnson replied for the defense. He
said that the sugar trust had as much
honor to protect as the Senate, and that
in reply to all questions as to theif having
corruptly offered money for votes they in
dignantly answered "No." /y" '.

John T. Dare Believed to
Have the Inside
Track.
Congressman Loud end John
D. 1 Spreckeis Can Name
the Man.
Uncle Ben McKinley May Upset
Calculations, but the Possibil
, ity Is Remote.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.â The
Call correspondent, after interviewing
Senator Perkins, John D. Spreckeis and
Congressman Loud, â  has good reason to
believe that John T. Dare will be appoint
ed Postmaster at San Francisco to suc
ceed: Frank McCoppin, deceased. No
definite agreement has yet been made be
tween the trio, but John T. Dare has the
inside track and will probably be appoint
ed. The most prominent candidates are
General Samuel W. Backus, ex- Post ma
ter of San Francisco, W. W. Dodge,
Charles F. Bassett and B. F. McKinley.
Senator Perkins said to The Call cor
respondent to-night that he would indorse
any good man who was named by Con
gressman Loud and Mr. Spreckeis. It is
believed that Senator Perkins' choice is
Charles F. Bassett, but that he will not
oppose the choice of Messrs. Loud and
Spreckeis, : provided their selection is a
good one. It may be stated, furthermore,
that Mr. Spreckeis and Congressman Loud
are working together and that they will
have no trouble in uniting upon a good
man.
John T. Dare and W.W.Dodge were
candidates for the Appraisership. It is
well known that Mr. Spreckeis was in
favor of Dare for the place, but now that
there is a vacancy in the Postoffice it is
believed by those on the inside that Dare
will be made Postmaster.' It is under
stood that Mr. Spreckeis offered the post
mastership to W. W. Montague, but that
gentleman wired that he could not ac
cept it and recommended W. W. Dodge. â 
Of course there is a possibility that Sen
ator Perkins will not agree to indose Mr.
Dare, but as he has expressed his deter
mination to support any good man recom
mended for the place it is believed that he
will fall into line. There is, too, the bare
possibility that Uncle B.F. McKinley,
with his little petition, may upset all cal
culations, but this possibility is too re
mote to be seriously considered. The
Californians here do not seem to know
much about Uncle McKinley. They say
he has never been prominent in politics.
Congressman Loud to-night received a
telegram from Charles Bemis, savin*; :
"The people here are for B. If. McKiniey
or Postmaster." ., .- â¢
A Californian in conversation with The
Call correspondent said that Uncle Mc-
Kinley's appointment would be a rank in
stance of nepotism. "Not exactly nepot
ism," said he/laughingly, "for a strict
literal definition of i nepotism is 'favorit
ism for nephews.' B. F. McKinley's ap
pointment would be a case of favoritism
for uncles, and mignt therefore ; be called
unc eitsm." ""â¢': ""f :i : : â  "Jy
" There has already been one case of this
kind, however, under President M< Kin
ley's administration. He' appointed his
cousin, Osborne, â  as Consul-General to
London. â B. F. MiKinley's friends cite
many cases of nepotism, notably the one
above and President Cleveland's appoint
ment of his wife's cousin, Ben Folsoro, as
Consul to Sheffield.' Then, too, they hunt
some ancient history wherein it is recorded
that President John Adams appointed his
own son, John Quincy Adams, as Minister
to The Hague. -
.Congressman Loud learned at the Post
office Department to-day that there is a
disposition in the department to allow the
defeated Republican candidates for. Con
gress to name the postmasters in their
districts^ in cases where they were de
feated by small majorities. The Repub
lican United States Senators are usually
allowed to make appointments in those
districts now represented in Congress by
Democrats, and if this .-.d etermination of
the department, is adhered .to Senator
Perkins will not be allowed the privilege
of selecting the postmasters in the dis
tricts now represented by , Barlow and
Castle (Populist Democrats), but . the de
feated Republican candidates, Bowers and
McLachlan, will name the men. It will
be different in the Second District, how
ever, for,. Grove Johnson was . fairly
snowed under by De Vries; besides, it is
understood at the department here that
Mr. Johnson is no longer a resident of ti.e
Second District, but has removed to San
Francisco. ,
Senator Perkins is naturally displeased,
and, it is said, is inclined to bold Mr. Loud
responsible for this policy of the Postoffice
Department. There is no doubt that there
is a spirit of rivalry between Senator Per
kins and Congressman Loud. The latter
has a strong pull at the Postoffice Depart
ment, for he is chairman of the Commit
tee on Po?toffices and Postroads of the
House of Representatives, and in this ca
pacity is able ' to â¢ grant many favors re
quested by the department, or not to, as
suits his pleasure. %
; Representative Load had another inter
view with Assistant .Secretary Spalding
at the Treasury Department to-day con
cerning the new San Francisco Postoffice
building. Mr. Spalding sent for the su
pervising architect and instructed him to
rush the work. { Mr. Loud is very well
pleased over the prospects.

STIRS THE
SENATE
Creates a Breeze by His
Talk About the Sugar
Schedule.
ASKS FOR A BRAND NEW
INVESTIGATION.
The South Carolina Statesman
Says Some People Think
There Is Corruption.
ALDRICH PUTS A QUIETUS ON
THE HARANGUE.
Declares That No One Interested In
Sugar Stocks Knew Anything
About the Schedule.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.-Till
man started a sensation in the Senate to
day by rising to a question ol ptivilege
and offering a resolution providing for an
other sugar investigation.
The resolution recites the resolution
adopted May 17. 1894, for the investiga
tion of charges then made that Senators
were speculating in sugar stocks. It also
recites the fact that certain witnesses re
fused to answer, and one is now in jail for
such refusal, and that another was acquit
ted yesterday under technicalities; also,
within t c last thirty days, newspaper
correspondents had charged that Senators
were speculating now in sugar stocks. Ii
therefore provides for the appointment of
a committee of five to examine the
charges, with power to send for persons
and papers.
The Senator was allowed to proceed
after thequesiion whether the matter was
privileged was raise. because there was
no objection. '-, y^y^y
Tillman, speaking excitedly, said the
time hau come when the Senate could no
longer afford to be under the accusation.
If the Senators had been speculating in
sugar stock, with the knowledge of the
tariff secrets, the Senate ought to rind out
and purge itself, or if the newspaper cor
respondents were lying against the Sena
tors to the press the gallery oug..t to be
cleared of all dishonest and dishonorable
correspondents, and the men who slan
dered the Senate be punished. The Sena
tors could not afford to lie back on their
diunity and say it was beneath them to
investigate such charges. Half of the
American people ana more believe there
was rottenness and corruption among the
leaders of the Democratic party in 1892.
Just so half the people believed some
thing was rotten in Denmark now. Both
parties were involved, one being as deep
in the mud as the other in the mire.
At this point Pettus of Alabama, in se
vere tones, asked Tillman not to deal in
generalities. "If," said he, "the Senator
desires to put a mark upon a Senator on
this floor I demand he shall mark him â
not indicate the S nate generally."
"I can only mark a man," Tillman re
plied impetuously, "by having witnesses
who have proof against a man or men tell
what they know." Tillman then contin
ued a lengthy characteristic invective.
When Aldrich rose to reply there was a
marked contrast in the manner of the
two men. While Tillman had been boil
ing over with excitement Aldrich ad
dressed the Senate in calm tones and in
a most dignified manner. He said:
"Tne task of the Senator who has charge
of the tariff schedule is a most difficult
and ungracious one. He enters upon that
duty with the full knowledge that cer
tain portions of the press throughout the
United States are bound to charge un
worthy motives upon him, whatever he
may do. In view "of what the Senator
from South Carolina has said ana the ex
tracts he bad caused to be read, perhapi I
oueht to make a statement in regard to
the question of duties on sugar and how
they came to be prop* sed. It is insinu
sited in various articles that the sugar
jsclie iuie as present*- by the committee is
in some manner influenced or demanded
by a sugar-refining company. I say to the
Senator from South Carolina, and to every
other Senator and to every person in the
United States that no person connec ed
with the sugar trust or with any other re
fining company and no oth-r person
whatever suggested or dictated any
schedule or any rates on sugar to mem
bers of the Finance Committee at any
time or in any place. I desire to mate
this statement as broad as it is pos.-iule
lor the English language to make it. I
desire to say further mat the Republican
members of the committee are solely re
sponsible lor mil schedule, and no one
else, and no person knew what that
schedule was to be or what the rates were
to be until it was prepared, less than two
days before it was reported to the Senate.
The oniy other person who knew, it be
fore it was reported was the Senator from
Nevada (Jones). It was submitted, to him
for his approval or for his suggestion about
thirty-six hours before reported to the
Senate. No one else knew or had any in
timation what the schedule was to be,
not a living person, and any man who
frays contrary or intimates anything of the
sort deserves to be denounced in a way
that would not be parliamentary to de
nounce him here, but be ought to be de
nounced."
Tillman asked if A'drich was willing to I
allow tne papers to prove their charges.
"So far as I am concerned," Aldrich re
plied, with perfect equanimity, "and I
ih*nk 1 can speak for every member of the
sub-committee, I say . we not only wish
but; court the most searching investiga
tion into every single act of ours in rela
tion to the siisar schedule or any other
schedule. Oueof these newspapers brings
in a gentleman named White. I neve? 1
knew White and never heard of him. "I
have no more knowledge of White than
an inhabitant of the F.ji. Islands who
never came to the United States. If any
such man exists I never heard of hi in; ; It
is certain that no such man came to the
committee-room, and no information went
out of the committee-room. 1 never
bought a share of sugar stock, directly or
indirectly, in my life, or any other stock
for speculation." '.''_â /'â 
The prtrs.diiig officer said the resolution
had gone, under the rule, to the Commit
tee on Contingent Expensjs, and thus
brought the incident to a close.
During the whole scene there was the
appearance of pent-up rage and indigna
tion among the Senators 1 on 'â¢ both sides of
the chamber. The. Senate immediately
afterward resumed the consideration of
the tariff bill. . .- J ' . ' ' *':"**

Additional Paragraphs . in the Tariff
Dill Are dapted.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.â The
tariff bill was taken up in the Senate at
1:30 p. M. to-day. The remaining para
graphs on schedule A (.chemicals, oils and
paints) were finished, except those which
have been reserved, and schedule B
(earths, earthenware and glassware) was
taken up. Several paragrapna 10 tnis
schedule were reserved, and in others,
down to 99 (cylinder and crown glass,
polished), all committee amendments
were agreed "to and all independent
amendments for a reduction of duties
voted down. The first paragraph was 04
(medical preparations containing alcohol,
55 cents pound), which was agreed to after
several Democrats had objected to an in
crease from 50 cents.
Paragraph 74 V 2 (soda ash, % of a ceut
per pound) provoked an extended dis
cussion. The House bill fixed the rate at
\i of a cent, the same as the Wilson and
McKinley acts. Vest said this article was
used in the manufacture of soap, and pre
sented a protest signed by nearly all the
soap manufacturers of the United States
against the increase. This increase, he
said, was made in the interests of a few
concerns in Nevada enraged in soda ash
manufacturing. Referring to the increase
in borax. Vest said it was put in the bill
against the best judgment of the Senate
upon demand of Jones of Nevada.
Aldrich said the United Alkali Com
pany, which controlled the output of soda
ash in Great Britain, sold the article in
this country for half the price it did in
England for the purpose of breaking down
the few American factories which were
springing up all over the country and
would soon be able to supply the entire
demand. The item was agreed to, but
subsequently, at the request of Gray, re
consiaered.
Paragraph 81 (vanillin, last of chemical
schedule) was passed and schedule B
(earths, earthenware and glassware) was
proceeded with.
In paragraph 84 (Roman, Portland and
hydraulic cements) Aldrich offered an
amendment increasing the rates of cents
per 100 pounds in barrels and 7 cents in
bulk as under the House' bill, anil the
present law to 11 cents and 10 cents, res
pectively. Vest, Caffery, White and
Bacon entered vigorous "protests. The
amendment was adopted, 30 to 108.
When, the bill was laid aside Vest re
marked as a historical fact that more
progress was made in three days than in
the last tariff bill in three weeks. Notice
was given by Cnllom of two amendments,
one to strike out the paragraph on beer
and insert a paragraph making the tax on
whisky, including whisky in bond, 70
cents a gallon, and the other to make the
tax on wood naphtha the same. ;.;.
THE lllM-EJitiTEEM CASE.
Damaging f.ridence in Frorf of a Con-
spiracif lo Wreck a House.
BLOOMSBERG, Pa., May 28.â The trial
of Lioyi S. Wintersteen for conspiracy to
wreck E. L. Waller's house with dynamite
is now well under way. Waller, the first
witness called Wednesday, gave details
of the explosion at the house and of his
subsequent efforts to get a clew to the
perpetrator of the crime, offering in evi
dence five sticks of dynamite found by
him under a board pile in Mrs. Knorr's
lot, as described by Knorr in the confession
before a magistrate.
P. G. Miller, a coal dealer, testified that
in the spring of 1594, Wintersteen said in
his (Miller's) house that he would "serve
twenty years in the penitentiary to put a
ball through Levi Waller." John Ernt
wine, a laborer, testified that in Winter
steen's office in 1894, the defendant had
said he would "be willing to serve twenty
years of my life in tbe Eastern peniten
tiary to have the privilege of putting a
bu. let through L***vi Waller's heart. 1
have laid in wait for him. but he never
came my way. I could draw his blood as
easily as not." * â  â  â¢
Kate Davis, employed by Wintersteen
n*Â» a domestic, te-tified tha' she heard
Wintersteen exclaim: "Levi Waller is a
scoundrel. I could blow bim up if it
wasn't for her" (indicating his wife).
'â  There was a craning of necks when
Clifton Knorr, who yesterday pleaded
guilty, was called. â¢ Knorr testified: "In
July, s 1895, at Reading, I walked out with
Wintersteen and -I inquired how I could
get some money. He replied tbat if my
mother would conveniently die he would
le in good shape and could get
$4000 or $")000 for me. At Reading, .on
August 27. in an upstairs room, Winter
steen saw a knife lying open in a drawer.
He picked it up and flourished it, and said
he would like to run it through Waller
because he bad hurt him in litigation.
He said he wished there was some way of
getting somebody to put Waller out of the
way or throw vitriol in his face. He said
something had to be done to remove Wal
ler, as the case bad been going on long
enough and he had been compelled to lose
too much money already. Wintersteen
said if they continued the suit much
longer, and he continued to lose money,
he would hire somebody to kill both Wal
ler and Mrs. Knorr."
MOLLIE GIB&O.S GOES AWAY UP.
Stiff Eerival in Mining Stocks Causes
I ment in D-nrer.
DENVER, Colo., May 28.â There has
been a big boom "in mining -bares during
the last lew days, and the scene around
the pit of the Mining Sock Exchange
resembles the days of 1895 when every
body went wild over stocks.
The most noticeable advance was in
Moilie G ibson. Gibson was a drug on the
market last Satumay at 13 cents. Last
night it closed strong at .55 cents, and
some curb sales were a' 65 cents. Ar
centum Juniata, another Aspen stock of
tne some class, has advanced from 11 to
32 cents since Monday. Anaconda, Isabella
and other coll stocks of Cripple Creek,
| which have been on bedrock for a month,
! ware in great demand.
The improvement is caused by the dis
covery of a vein of four feet of siiver ore
bnween the first and second level of; the
Moilie Gibson, which runs nearly â¢ 20,000
ounces to the ten. This is supposed to be
the lost vein from which the mine several
years ago paid over $4,000,000 in dividends.

Prosperity to Be Restored by
the Administration of

The Legislative Branch May Be
Trusted to Enact a Wise
Revenue Law. ,'
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 28.â At a
banquet winding up the. reunion of the
commercial clubs of Boston, Chicago, St.
Louis and Cincinnati to-night, Secretary
of the Treasury Gage made the principal
address. He said: â  â  â 'Jj--yJJ7: \7-7yA r
"Upon a settlement of the tariff and
financial questions enterprise waits and
industry languishes. . Over fifty times I
have been asked when the tariff discus
sion would end and a final vote formulate
the measure into law. Over fifty times
more I have been asked if the financial
reforms for which the people struggled in
November have been forgotten. Now, it
is not to be wondered at that you who
have so long borne the burden of anxiety
and fear, who so long waited and watched
for the restoration of conditions upon
which some secure estimate of to-morrow
can be made, should grow nervous and
impatient over every act or word which
seems to suggest doubt or delay in the
establishment of such conditions. I have
thought on this occasion I could do no
better service than to give you the needed
reassurance and hope.
"As to the great fabric now before Con
gress known as the tariff bill, I have noth
ing to say in detail. I want to bear testi
, mony, however, to the zeal and good faith
of those in both houses having the meas
ure in charge. They are fully conscious
of their great responsibilities, and are
working faithfully to discharge them.
Nor do I think the opponents of these
measures are likely to oppose with willful
and unjust obstructions the course â¢of
legislation. Protest there will bj*. Fenc
ing for position must be expected. But
having now come into contact with many
representatives of the people in both
houses, I deem it my duty to bear witness
to the honorable and patriotic motives in
spiring the minds of the great majority,
whether on one side of the house or the
other, and I prophesy an early result in
the National councils to which this great
commercial question is now committed.
"I make these remarks not to defend a
body for whom I hold no commission to
speak, but to correct in one direction tbe
operation of injurious sentiment, which
is sowing evil seeds in many directions.
i It is dividing classes, destroying unity
breeding hatreds. The only word for that
sentiment is distrust. Faith and courage
lead to conquest and victory. Distrust
paralyzes and desttoys. As to the finan
cial question I must content myself with a
few words. lam glad they may be words
of asiurance. If any of you harbor the
suspicion that the administration but -just
now installed has forgotten or is likely to
forget the mandate of the people whose
vote * in behalf of honest money and
sound finances rang out loud and clear in
November last, put that suspicion aside.
It is unjust and unfounded.
, "In good tims and in the proper order
affirmative evidences of ray declaration
will appear. In the meantime, my
friends, do your part to help those
char eel with the legislative and adminis
trative duties. Djn't let inertia, en
gendered by fear and distrnst, creep over
you. We have been passing through a
period of great trial and nobly we have
endured the strain. The future is not
dark with forebodings. It is illumined
with rational hope. *â¢
"The revival of industry is near, and
with the establishment of a revenue law
sufficient to bring into the treasury an
amount adequate to meet the reasonable
needs of our Government and with the
establishment of our finances on a sound
and enduring basis nothing now foreseen
can delay the recovery of past losses and
the inauguration ot a new forward move
ment along the lines of material advance
ment and social progress, which we may
humbly trust is in the benevolent mind
of God to bestow upon the American
i people." _______^____

Miraculous Escape From Death of a

. WICHITA, Kans., May 28.â Friday eight
young John O.iuhant of Pauls Valley,

| ime to ring, the bell a; the Methodist
church, dreamed that tho clapper was go
ing lo fall and seriously if not fatally hurt
him unless he took the precaution to pro
tect himself. The dream so impressed
itself upon the mind of- the boy that he
spoke of it to his family and friends, all
01 whom scoffed at it; but on Sunday even
ing when time came to ring tne bell he
took a chair and placing it from directly
under the bell and standing in the chair
began to ring. Very soon the clapper fell
with terrible force, but as he had prepared
himself tor it no injury resulted to mm.
If he had been standing in his accustomed
position nothing short of a miracle could
have saved him from injury and perhaps
death. Such a' possibility as the clapper
falling had not even been thought ot be
fore by any one. - J â '**. y

Had Contemplated Suicide,
but the Evidence Indi
cates Foul Flay.
Left-Home on Wednesday After
a Quarrel With Her
Husband.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., May 28.âSus
pended by . the neck to a small rope
fastened to a nail in the wall, the body of
a woman was found this morning in a
woodshed in the rear of .the National
Hotel. The unfortunate was Mrs. George
Gehrig of this city, who had registered at
the hotel 'as Mrs. Francis, Zeitler on
Wednesday, after a quarrel with her hus
band. There is evidence to prove that the
woman contemplated suicide, but this is
outweighed by the marks of cruel blows
and scattered pools of blood, which be
speak foul play.' : The mystery is a deep
one, and the authorities have as yet been,
unable to solve it. y - " ' *"
The Gehrina have â raised a family of six
children, but though prospering "finan
cially their life has not been a happy one.
On Wednesday they had trouble, late
that day Mrs. Gehrig left home, gungto the
hotel under an assumed name. Gehrig had
been searching in vain for her until he
saw the bruised and ' blood-bedraggled
corpse to-day. He feels certain that
his wife killed herself, but many of tbe
officers and citizens believe she was mur
dered. - 'J;
The woman's body was discovered at
about 6 o'clock this morning by Officer
W. G. Carr. It was suspended by the
neck from a stoat wire nail in the south
wall of the. woodshed. The nail was
about six feet from the ground and the
body was suspended by a short piece of
small rope, such as is used for clothes
lines. The rope reduced the distance to
the ground to about four feet, and the
woman not only had her feet on the
ground but had her knees bent, so that if
she died in that position it mast have
been by slow strangulation. ',: Her lace
was turned toward the wall and both
hands were raised and resting on a cross
timber, as though she had clutched at it
be.'ore death. . J- j_ .â ,â -,---â â ' : y. -yhy
Deputy Sheriff Nagle cut down the
body.' Coroner Hocking soon arrived and
the officers began an investigation. On
the ground at the edge of tne woodpile
and about forty feet from where the body
bung was a pool of blood.' The shed is a
large one, about 40 -by 80 feet lin size, be
ing us<~-d for a wagon shea also. It has an
earth floor and the dust is deep, but the
officers found no traces in it of. a body
having ben dragged about, yet blood was
spattered from one end of the shed to the
other. . Â»â *.'..'â  yy--.....- ' .; - v
Near the j largest pool lay an ax. its
handle dyed red, but the blade unstained.
It was evident that the ax was not used,
but that a stick of oak stove wood which
lay in the large pool was the bludgeon
with which the woman had been beaten
over the head. The cuts on her head were
not deep,' but her skull had been -frac
tured. - Later another stick k was fouad
covered With blood and hair, y ;
Mrs. Gehrig a few days ago '.wrote in
German a disconnected and rambling let
ter, which was not interpreted until to
day, and by some this letter is offered as
proof that she killed herself. In it is a
sentence to the effect that "if he knew
what a loving wife and good mother I
have been be would not treat me so. "
Another was: "I thank God that there
are still many good and virtuous women
in California."
An inquest will be held A to-morrow
ni.'ht and the funeral will be held on Sun
day, under the auspices of Milo Temple,

Impotent Rage of the
Mutineers at San
Quentin.
Spend a Night Shrieking and
Banging Against Iron
Cell-Doors.
Will Be Kept on Bread and Water
Until They Consent to Re
suMe Work.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Cal., May 28.
Never before in the history of San Queu
tin prison has there been such a season of
tumult and excitement as that of last
night. The 720 prisoners who rebelled
and refused to work in the big jutemiil
combined to make night hideous and
shriek upon shriek rent the air, while an
incessant banging against the massive iron
doors added to the racket and confusion.
There was little opportunity for sleep in the
prison last night on account of the noise.
To-day it was more quiet, although the
hammering and howling was heard at in
tervals throughout the morning and dur
ing the afternoon.
Within the confines of the great stone
wall, securely locked in solitary confine
ment, 720 men are living upon bread and
water and with this frugal fare they must
be content until they come to terms. With
out a doubt the revolt was instigated by
the opium fiends, who incited the men to
refuse to submit to the rules of tbe prison.
Every prisoner has adifferenijcomplaint
to make. The food supplied by the State
is declared to be insufficient, but it is an
indisputable fact that the prisoners are
fed much better than many a family in
the state at whose head is a man willing
to work.
Not lone: aso P es:dent Fitzgerald of
the Board of Prison Directors visited
the big penitentiary and inspected the
food which was supplied to the prisoners
every day. This morning Warden W. E.
Hale received a dispatch from him stating
that the Prison Directors would stand by
the warden in all he did, as they were
convinced be was in the right.
The demands of the imprisoned men
will not be granted. The bread and water
diet will be continued until tbe last man
of them gives in.
The revolt has proved the reliability of
the guards. While their position is one
irausj-ht with danger the guards to a man
have bravely faced the ordeal and not one
has flinched. The bine-coated sentinels
are within call at all times now. At a
given signal every guard in the prison
will take a position and stand ready to
carry oat the orders of Warden Hale.
"We are in the right," said the Warden
to-day, "and will bring the men to time.
We have been endeavorine to locate the
ring-leaders, but this is a difficult task."
The men are where they can do no harm. â¢
To escape is an utter impossibility, and
were they to get loose the shining Catling
guns in the guardhouses overlooking the
walls are trained upon the exits and at a
turn of the crank will belch death to those
who attempt to leave. â¢
Heretofore at various times the request
of the convicts have been in some degree
respected, but. the present revolt is one
without reason, and the prison authori
ties intend to allow no dictation from the
prisoners under them. As fast as the
leaders can be detected they are led to the
dungeons, and there in the damp dark
cells, upon a bread and water diet, they
will have the opportunity to repent at
leisure.
The great jatemill was silent to-day.
The wheels were not revolving, for the
men who are confined in the gloomy cells
are its only workmen. The manufactur
ing of jute bags has, of course, been sus
pended, and at a time when they are
greatly in demand.
The last revolt in tha jutemill lasted
four days before the strikers were ready
to leave the fare of bread and water and
return to work. This mutiny is more
serious. Over 700 are involved and they
are howling in their frenzy.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CROPS.
Orchards, V.neyards and Grain Fields
Give Promise of a Heavy
V.eld.
VIS ALIA, Cal., May 28.â Fruit men of
this vicinity are somewhat at a loss to un
derstand how the reports of short crops
have come into circulation, because the
reports are so far from being true. At a
meeting of orclmrdists in this city every
man present reported the prospects excel
lent for a crop very much larger than
that of last year. Major Try, manager
of one of the largest orchards in the State,
made the. declaration tbat tbe crop of
runes alone this year would he iv pro
portion to that of. last year, and is 5000
to 12,003 tons. Everywhere throughout
the Delta district the heavy increase ob
tains.
As for wheat, it is also in fine condi
tion, and it is estimated that it will re
quire 10,030 cars to carry the crop of
Tulare County to the bay. The growers
are looking forward to a prosperous sea
son.
There are some 2500 acres along the foot
hills of tbe east side in oranges this year.
The crop ripens irom four to six weeks
earlier than in the orange country farther
south. The yield will be from 75 to 100
carloads.
FRESNO, Cal., May 28.â Grain-buyers
as well as grain-growers of tbis county
admit a large crop this year. The harvest
is. variously estimated at from 45.00J to
50,000 tons. All the way from Summit
Lake to White's bridge there will be a
more than usually heavy crop. This is
true ot the country about Ridley and
down as far as Portervilie. ; The estimate
placed on the crop of Fresno County
by buyers who have been over the district
is 80 000 tons at its lowest, and up to
100,000 tons. On the poorer land of the
cast file the crop will not average above
two sacks to the acre, but no more is ever
expected. The very early grain has suf
fered from the drouth, but the latter and
latest grain will make up for that.
HANFORD, âCai*. May 28.âVineyard
i*-t-, orchardisis and farmers of Kings
County report excellent prospects for
this season. The raisin crop is especially
in fine form.. Lou Chittenden, manager
of the big j Lucerne ranch, declares that
all reports to the contrary 1897 is to be a
big year.
REDWOOD CI IX MZSTERX.
Authorities to Invesiijate the Death of a
Ann Mateo Man.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., May 28.â
body of the man supposed to have been
killed at San Mateo on Wednesday by
freight train 34 was identified yesterday
as that of one Bradley, an old resident of
San Mateo.
Since the identification of the body facts
have been learned which will, probably
cause the Coroner to reopen the inquest
Among the witnesses were three men of
rather unsavory character, who testified
tbat they had been drinking until a late
hour that night. Soon after the freight
train had passed San Mateo they walked
up the track \ past the > place , where ,* the
body was afterward ; found, but \ they saw
no signs of a' dead person, although they
walked up the middle of the track exactly
where the body lay. They testified " that
they would certainly have seen the body
had it been: there. , â¢ â 'â â &:
,- It has since been learned that Bradley
was seen in the company of these very
persons on the night in question.
TAKUSH HARBOR GOLD STRIKE.
Fabulously Rich Ore Uncovered by a Fros-
pector, 'Who Is Crazed by H.s
Good Fortune.
VANCOUVER,; B. C. May 28âFabu
lously rich free milling ore has been dis
covered at Takush Harbor in the northern
waters of the Gulf of Georgia, 140 miles
from .Vancouver. Every piece of rock
taken out of a vein â¢ said to be ten feet
wide is ribbed round and round with
coarse gold. It assays thousands of dol
lars to the ton and the specimens are
richer than any ever seen in the province
heretofore. Like all other rich strikes
there it was made by accident and not by
a mining expert. Hundreds of prospect
ors searched the country, bat the one who
made the Takush Harbor strike and who
was grub-staked for one month only,
camped on the very spot after giving up
his, search. He was digging a trench
around his tent when he uncovered gold
seamed rock.
A week went by and he did 'not return.
His employer went up the coast to look
for him and found him raving mad. The
excitement caused by his find had de
throned his reason and he had eaten
nothing for a week. The only words he
could say were: "I've found it; I've found
it."
There is a stampede from Vancouver
for Takush Harbor. The excitement is
intense throughout the province and
American money and men are coming in
very last. .y y '
PACIFIC GROVE CONFERENCE.
Convention of the Pac fie Coast College
Students Is Drawing to a
Close.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 28.â The
conference of the Pacific Coast students is
drawing to a close. So far all who have
had tbe work in charge feel well satisfied
with the splendid results which are already
shown here, and which will no doubt
accrue when the delegates return to their
college labors next fall.
The work of tbe morning began with tbe
session of the missionary institute, con
ducted by Robert E. Lewis. The subject
of this morning's talk was "Tbe Study of
Missions." The second hour of the session
was occupied by a joint meeting of the
students and city delegates in the east
chapel. BP@
The platform lecture was delivered by
Rev.W. A.Gardner, D.D., pastor of the Weft
Side Christian Church of San Francisco.
The lecture dealt with "Character Build
ing." Dr. Gardner gave the students ex
client advice regarding the way to build
a character, the materials to be used â
faith, love and prayer the model
Christ from which to build.
The fina.o of the singles in the tennis
tournament were played to-day between
G.fford o; Stanford, and Belcher of Berke
ley. Gifford won by a score of b*â 3. 6â2.
Belcher played a good game, but Gifford's
steady serving and backhand drives were
too much for him. The doubles matches
also got well unuer way to-day, the semi
finals being reached.
D. Eaward Collins, president of the
California Bank of Oakland and promi
neatly identified with work lor young
men in his own city, lectured to the mem
bers of the life-work conference this even
ing on "The Christian Man in the Busi
ness World." From experience in the
practical side of business life Mr. Collins
was enabled to give some valuable point
ers to these of the students who contem
plate a business career. He spoke at
some length upon ihe fundamental prin
ciples of success in business, particularly
in regard to Christianity in- commercial
relations. .. . ...'.. ..... .... Ââ  :_

who has been appointed to take charge of
the estate of the late Father Peter J.
Jeram, in Eden Valley, by Public Admin
istrator J. H. Barker of . this county, re

reported that he was ordered off the ranch
by the agent of the Public Administrator
of the City and County of San Francisco,
and was forced to leave.
Petitions for letters of administration
on Father Jeram's estate had been filed in
the Superior Court of botu this and San
Francisco counties, and in both cases let
ters were issuedâ in the former court to
the Public Administrator of this county
and in San Francisco to A. 0. Freese.
Appeals have been taken by the respective
parties, and while the mallei is pending

for supremacy. This latest move on the
part of the Freese people will, it is thought,

land and large herds. The estate, al
though purchased by the 500 colonists
whom Father Jeram induced to settle in
Eden Valley, and who departed when the
co-operation colony scheme proved to be a
failure, was all recorded in the dead
priest's name. The officials of both San
Francisco and Mendocino counties con

whither he went to call the matter to the

"I stirred up the whole question," Eb

something that Great Britain wants and
therefore must be worth having. Presi

ping, chief of the registry department of
the Portland postoffice, was arrested this
afternoon on a charge of conspiracy S to
rob the ; office. Later- Detective C. W.
Holsappie, City , Jailer Charles Watson,
Deputy Sheriff George Watson, Eugene
Gautier (alias Frank Hall), a .-notorious
Chinese certificate forger, and Â» J. H.
Stensen, a worthless character, were ar
rested as Epping's accomplices. ;.y
Suspicion had rested . upon Epping for
some time, and several p;sioifice inspec
tors had been shadowing him incognito.
This morning Epping was explaining the
plans of the robbery to one of his con
federates, ignorant that an inspector was
listening to him. The plan was that the
others should, after they had robbed tbe
office, gag him with a handkerchief bear
ing a certain initial, so as to throw the
authorities off the Holsanpie was
to make arrests of suspects, and for his
share of the work he was to get one-fifth
of the gross proceeds. That is the story
coming from an authentic source, but it
may develop that the detective was in
the play to upset the plot, which, had it
i succeeded; might have cost Uncle Sam
from $10,000 to $20,000. : â  :
The alleged conspiracy was worked up
by Inspector Thrall of the po*Â«toffice secret
service. He has been .... in Portland for
some time. When seen this evening he
said that so astonishing were the revela
tions that he lelt that the public would be
shocked and . even incredulous until- a
conviction followed, which' he felt confi
dent would be the result of the trials. ">
McCAULEY'S CASE AT TACOMA.
The Ex- Treasurer Again Under Arrest
Pend/nq Inquiry Into the Value
ol His Bonds.
TACOMA, Wash, May ;28 -Ex-City
Treasurer J. W. McCauiey is under arrest
again by authority of an order of the
Supreme Court, which' directs the Supe
rior Court to inquire into the sufficiency
of his $8000 appeal bond. '; '' 'V'yJJ
The Supreme Court a few days ago
affirmed McCauley's sentence of four years
in the penitentiary after his conviction of
having received interest on deposits of
city money while he was Treasurer two
years ago. Last evening Prosecuting At
torney Titlow made an affidavit alleging
that he had been informed that the bond
of McCanley had become impaired and
insufficient and asking that a bench war
rant be issued and McCauley brought in
by the Sheriff. ,' . .. . '.. -r" .
To-day McCauley's attorneys made a
bard fight against any inquiry by the
Superior Court, claiming that- under the
statute such action could be taken only
before the Supreme Court. They alleged,
also, that his three bondsmen; one -of
whom is Mrs. McCauley, have disposed of
no property and - that they are worth as
much now as when the bond was given.
This afternoon Judge Kean decided
there was no occasion for McCaulev's de
tention and he was permitted to go. In
the., meantime Prosecutor Titl'-w rushed
over to Olympia, presented the matter to
the Supreme Court and secured an or er
requiring the Superior Court to inquire
into the sufficiency of the bond,
j ..',. McCauley gave himself up. -He intends,
appealing to the Federal Supreme Court,-
He * claims that to-day's action is spile
work, and that the result will be to ruin
his mining business. v j, ,::v.c i -Vv; i * ,- y.

OWES HIS LIFE
TO WAKEFULNESS
Tale of a Survivor of
the American Falls
* Disaster.
Left His Coach Before the
Crash to Breathe the
Morning Air.
Frightful Havoc Wrought by the
Collision of the Two Loco
motives.
PORTLAND, Or., May 28.â George Rat
cliffe of this city, one of the survivors of
the railway accident at American Falls,
Idaho, arrived here to-day. He gives a
graphic account of the awful collision,
which resulted in the death of nine men
and injury to double that number. Rat
cliff was a passenger on the train which,
while standing at the station, was crashed
into by the freight. He owes his life to
the fact that he was awake when the train
pulled into American i Fails, and left the
car for a whiff of the crisp morning air.
â¢ "Whan the west-bound passenger train
came to a stop at American Falls station,"
said he, "dawn was breaking. I got up
and went out on the platform. After
standing on the platform for a moment I
walked forward toward the engine.. I
heard the wild freight give two whistles
and then a scare-shriek of the whistle. I
realized in an instant that there was
something wrong. Then around the
curve, about 200. yards away, shot the
freight. ..,..* , /
â¢â¢By this time the passenger engine had
tooted the whistle and started to back,
but it was too late. It, struck me that my
brother was in the way of danger, but I
could not see him for the steam. He was
inside the smoker, as I afterward learned.
Feeling thai there was a crash at hand I
ran past John Cooper, who was standing
right in front of the station. He was
killed instantly. .-'
"When the engines struck the earth
seemed to quake and the crashing, tear
ing sounds would make one's blood creep.
The wreck was at first obscured by escap
ing steam, but when I looked the freight
engine's boiler was lying up on top of the
passenger engine's head, with the end
across the sand dome of the freight. The
passenger engine was half telescoped.
"The first four cars on the freight were
loaded with Bridal Veil .lumber,, and this
lumber made veritable mincement of the
poor tramps who were supposed to be
stealing rides on the freight. Half of , the
station-house was torn down and 'the
office furniture and telegraph instruments
were destroyed by the collision of the
locomotives. ...... y ,',
"The cause of the wreck, as I learned it,
was the failure of the airbrakes to work
on the freight engine. hen it came
down the grade west of. American Falls it
ran wild. ' ...'.*. J.JyJ'-. '
"At every station on the line coming to
Portland great crowds congregated â '. about
the train to see if any passengers were
hurt. Little was known of the killed or
injured except the trainmen. After plac
ing the injured on the relief train, which*
started for Salt Lake, another engine and
a mallear arrived from Pocatelio, and we
pulled out for home at once. The mail
car on the passenger was. badly smashed.
Some ttmewill be" necessary to clear the
tracK." .'J * J "â '.':â  'J'' J J- .. J'J-yjj " '->.:

RIVERSIDE, Cal.. May 28.â A family

poor he was not found.-* â¢
.Not long after another man paid the
BaKers a visit. . He was there just about
dark. The man came up the steps of the

Mrs. Baker, whereupon the lady grabbed
an ax, which was lying close by, and used
it with such effect as to knock the insult

Baker, .who soon, afterward arrived at
the bouse, came down and notified Officer

I general prosperity of the State, while from the
interior cities and counties come appeals tor
the abrogation of the treaty.
' The point on ? which the â¢ opposition to the
treaty is based is | the beet-sugar industry, of
the State. No one can be more alive to the
importance of that industry' than myself | and
I hope to see it grow and give to the State that
prosperity which I believe it is capable of pro
ducing. â _ -y-'.y â ->â  â¢'-'â ^'â¢'â V
But there seems to be views .as to the effect
of the continuance of the reciprocity treaty
upon this Industry and it is these that have
glv^n rise to the demands for its continuance
and abrogation. Both are strongly held and
both have a strong backing of facts, so that it
is not easy to determine whether one party is
right ana another ; wrong, or whether the
truth lies somewhere between : the two opin
ions. Therefore, as you will see, my position
In reeard' to the question at. issue is embar
rassing." â¢- â  â  -y.r
We are now paying to China, the East Indies
and other countries, with which we have re
ciprocity treaties, $10,000,000 each year ior
sugar, and as long as wo are compelled to pur-'
chase sugar from foreign countries it seems
but right that we should give those granting
us reciprocal benefits an advantage in remov
ing the tariff from their staple articles of ex
port. If we were not paying out such vast
sums to our sugar-producing countries there
could be no question that the reciprocity
treaty with Hawaii should be abrogated. | But
so long as we are unable to produce . sufficient
sugar for our own consumption it is not to my
mind good policy to radically change our re
lations with a country with which reciprocity
has been mutually advantageous. .
I can only say that my best thought shall be
given to the matter, and that I shall be gov
erned in my action by the wishes of, the ma
jority of the people of the State as for as I can
ascertain what they are. That they will mÂ»ke
their wishes known in no uncertain way I
have no reason to doubt. GEO. C. Perkixs.

Be Mysterious Ecbo
Don't ever get weak, for if you do
you may be the victim of the Myste-
rious Echo. There is a certain class
of men who begin by having ringing
sounds in the ears. This is followed
by peculiar noises in the head, and
then comes the Mysterious *Echo. -.
i: This echo is unlike the mountain
echo, for the noise is entirely '
changed. Men who have lived lives
of recklessness, of dissipation or of
abuse soon find themselves in a con-
dition of weakness that is indeed
horrible. Besides the noises in the
head, the spots ' before the eyes, the
steam-like vapor that goes through
the body, the sweats of night, the
lost unmanly visions, and the first
break of day brings this poor fellow
to his senses. He realizes at last
that having misused himself, he has â¢ '
wrecked his manhood. .' ' '
To such men a reliable treatment is , -

Mamie X Easily Wins
the Yearling Race
at Sacramento. .
Two-Forty Class Event Goes to
the Hot Favorite
Prince.
Heartsease and Lo Lo Fall In a
Sprint and Jockey Holmes
Is Injured.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 28.â The
trotting and pacing events to-day failed
to draw as large a crowd as was pre-ent at
the track yesterday; still, the grand stand
held a fair sprinking of the gentler sex
and the betting ring was crowded with
men, none of whom were placing large
amounts. The day was cool and the track
rather heavy, having been deeply har
rowed to accommodate the runners yes
terday.
The first race, a yearling trot, was a
"cinch" for Mamie X, who took the lead
in both beats, leaving the other infants
strung out far in the rear.
For the 2:40 class, trot. Prince was a hot
favorite, and although be presented the
v first heat to Candy Joe he took the next
three straight, with the sweet one second
and Hobo third.
Ledgett, after a few breaks, got the run
ners off to a fair start in the third event.
Heartsease went to the front and held
that position to the middle of the turn,
where she fell, Lo Lo following suit. Moi
lie R then came to the front anil won by
three lengths, with Perhaps second and
Modestia third. Holmes, the rider of
Heartsease, got a bad tumble. One of his
legs and his collar bone were broken.
Kouher, who was ud on Lo Lo, got jarred
and had a slight cut on his scalp.
The last race, a pace, for three-year-olds,
was taken by Telephone in one-two
three order, with Los Angeles second.
Tule Ro-^e was distanced in the third heat.

Items of Interest Concerning Local and
Eastern Racers and Turfmen.
Barney Schreiber's jockeys, Slaughter and
Woods, are experiencing a very fair streak of
climate at the fair grounds, St. Louis. The
former won on two mounts yesterday and
Johnny ("Dugan") Woods also landed a couple
over the plate. * "Dugan" is cool and strong,
and ps he can ride at in the neighborhood of
sixty-eight pounds is in much demand.
Don Fulano was heavily backed to win the
last race at St. Louis in the Sausali to rooms
yesterday/but was easily beaten by Montgom
ery. The latter horse was taken away from
Felix Carr in a selling race at Ingieside before
â¢ the close of the local season here by W. P.
. Magrane. Slaughter sat astride the sprinter
yesterday, which looks as though Messrs.
Schreiber, Magraue and Carr have reached an
amicable adjustment of affairs.
It is now almost a certainty, Eastern sports
say, that Ha. ma, "The Black Whirlwind,"
wi.i face the issue in the Brooklyn handicap.
The Fair Association has opened war on the
prolrooms in St. Louis by reducing admission
to the racetrack to 50 cents.
W. L. Stanfield. the Texas horseman, will
have his good sprinter, George Miller, fired by
Dr. Fitzgerald, and wilt then turn him out to
pasturage near Antioch until next fall.

over an rttuck of lung fever, will be allowed
to "grass-up" during the summer mouths at
the tame p. ace. v
Loanie B, quite a bread-winner in her day,
recently dropped a foal by the dead Morello.
A. B. Spreckeis' string 'of . horses will be
shipped to Sacramento next weeK to rest.
Lee Shiner, who leaves lor Montana next
Week, having dissolved partnership with

-1 able stable to campaign with, In the running
I division he will be represented by Lady Hurst,
I irritator, Alcatraz, Dr. Mizner, Barney Schrei
\ler, a two-year-old purchased from William
*urrv, and a maiden two-year-old filly by Mo
rello-Peerless. Lee will also have a siring if
six trotters and â  pacers,; among .- them Billy
Frazier and Chris Peterson. The latter is ex
pected to make 2:09 look pale ere the season
is over.
"Frisco" Hoag recently purchased' Hearts
ease from Zeke Abraham ior $175. and will
try to win a little Montana coin .with the er
ratic mare.
Claude Burlingame has sent his horses' to
PleasantoD. Charles Le Bel and St. Philip,
two very useful two-year-olds, will be added
to the list. Miss Pollard has been bred to imp.

be touched up with the firing-iron.
By Holly's car will start ior Montana to-night.
The Fiosden turfman takes Judge Denny, re
cently purchased. Fusil, Fortunate. C'avallo,
Monteailade and S:r Ru-hard, and in the same
cÂ«r will no Flashlight and Encino, owned by
Farrar & Tuberville, and La Blue and C M (*,
the property of John Green. In the past By
Holly paid Montana several social calls, re
moving a ton or so of good pay ore, and there
seems to be no valid reason why he should not
repeat the intent with such a good array
o: breadwinners. K-^f^SS&HfSSEB&M
W. L. Stantield, who will leave here early
next week, will have a shy at Montana purses
with Mike Rice, Vo'.taire and Dr. McAllister.

NEW HAVEN. Cons., May 23.â In
terest among tne college men and athletes
generally is centered upon 10-morrow's
race on Lake Saltonsiall between the
crews of the University of Wisconsin and
Yale.
The former crew bas been in training on
the lake for the past fortnight, and it is
said that the prospects in the approach*
in*** contest are brighter for the Western
men than has previously been the case;
although, owing to the fact that Wiscon
sin was unable to spare all her best rowers
at this season, Yale is the favorite by long
odds. â  y-vyyj'
A large number of visitors, including
students and alumni, have arrived from
neighboring cities as well as from the
Central West. The Wisconsin crew will
probably be made up as follows; Bow,

The crew is accompanied by Substitutes

INTERFERENCE SCORED.
Supervisor Clinton Rebuked by
the Health and Police
Comm ttee.
His Suggestion That Bun; Contests
-, Be Limited to .One a Month
Reported on Adversely.
The Health and Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors administered a deli
cately worded but most pointed rebuke to
Supervisor Clinton yesterday in reference
to the resolution of the: representative of
the Eleventh Ward limiting the number
of boxing contests to one a month.
The resolution was presented at tbe last
meeting of the board and referred to the
Health and Police Committee. Chairman
Delaney stated that be thought it time that
Supervisors kept their hands out of mat
ters with which they had no concern and
instructed Clerk Russell to incorporate
the following in the report of the com
mittee:
lour committee questions the policy of
j members of the board endeavoring to interfere
with the judgment of the committees of this
board on applications referred which may
! be properly and judiciously granted, especially
when they are tbe means by whlca the treas
ury is benefited and the fund lor the aid of
the unemployed increased. These permits are
the means oi doing great* good to the unfor
tunate and providing means for a charitable
and laudable purpose which at present could
hardly be taised in any other manner.
Without any desire to offend the members
.who are particularly anxious to determine the
policy and actions of the committees of this
board, it does rppear as If the members could,
from the natuie of the duties imposed upon
all committees, be more advantngeously em
ployed in attending to the duties devolving
upon their respective committees. In this
way good work can be accomplished and the
recommendations left to the committees
which, after examination, are better qualified
to pass upon the same than a member whose
knowledge of the subject Is limited by his im
pressions. ... â  â¢,, â ..,-.. ; y-.--
Your committee therefore reports adversely
to the passage of the resolution and recom
mends that.it be indefinitely postponed. â  *--
Two Month*' Vacation- for Lawyers.
Judges ana lawyers will take a vacation of
two months. At a. meeting of the Judges of
the Superior Court yesterday; it was ordered,
for the , convenience j of , the members of the
bar, that except in cases of urgency, or by con
sent of parties, no civil causes shall be tried
between the 14th day of June and the 14th
uay of August. 1837. It was further ordered
that the foregoing shall in no 7 "way apply to
the criminal - departments of. the Superior
Court. Notwithstanding this order some of the
Judges of tee civil departments of the Superior
Court will be in attendance during the months
designated as vacation time, so the wheels of
litigation will not be blocked. Trials will go
on as usual In several departments, but law
yers who wish Â« to f prolong their holiday may
not be compelled, to 'appear in court daring
the term of the recess ordered yesterday.

Rumors That the Railroad Wil
Make Its Excursion Charge a
Regular Fare.
Possenger rates between here and Port- !
land were cut to pieces yesterday, but low
as they are no one can yet say the end has
been reached. You can now go to Port
land by rail, first class, for $10, or second
class $5. By the steamers of the 0. R.
and N. Company the first and second
class rates are $6 and $3, respectively. The
steamer transportation include* board
and the railway fare includes a sleeping
berth. /
Readers of The Call were told of the
hatchets that were playing in the hands
of the rival companies a few days ago. It
was dollars to dimes that they would enter
on a career of massacre. The Southern
Pacific first made a reduction, and then
the steamship company followed. ,
Assistant Passenger Agent Judah of the
Southern Pacific yesterday said of the
fight: yjyyy y^7yy.
â¢'On December 28 last we voluntarily
raised our rates to $21 first class and $14
second. As summer advanced tbe sea be
came smooth and weather pleasant, so
that travel went to the steamer line. In
fact we were not getting our share of it, so
we reduced our rates. On May 23 from
San Francisco and on May 27 from Port
land we carried passengers for $19 and $12
respectively.
"The O. R. and N. Company then re
duced its fares. We then announced that
on May 28, by the excursion leaving here
for Portland and June 1 from Portland,
we would reduce our rates to $15 and
$10. As we have been officially notified
that the O. R. and N. rates have been to
day cut to $6 and $3 we have. reduced our
rates to $10 and $5. The O. R. and N. has
not made any changes yet in the sound
rate. Mr., Goodall is sick. They will un
doubtedly be compelled to cut the sound
rates." y . J. . â¢?-â¢â *,-
The low railroad rates will go into effect
June 2 from Sun Francisco and June 1
from Portland, and will be applicable every

On these rates $10 more on each full- rate
ticket and $5 on each half-rate ticket will
be collected, but this extra amount will be
returned as a rebate on arriving at the end
of the journey. The same rate is charged
from Sacramento as from here. The
tickets must be used for the particular
train specified and they apply only to the
destination named. The business of the
Southern Pacific to Victoria and Port
Townsend irom Tacoma will be by the
steamer City of Kingston, owned by the
Puget Sound and Alaska Steamship Com
pany, yyj yy ;
It is not at all unlikely tbat there may
be more rate-cutting. Mr. Judah says it
is shameful, but there is an implication
that it may De worse. For a day or two
there has been a murmur that if the
Oregon KaUv-fey and Navigation Company
continued to cat the Southern Pacific
would haul off its periodic excursion by
which it now offers its reduced rates and
turn loose tbe traffic on its regular daily
trains at the reduced quoted rate. The
Southern Pacific, however, will not yet
commit itself on this.
KENNEDY DECLARED GUILTY.
He Will Be Sentenced To- Day for flap
: ping Little Baby Backmaater.
A. L. Kennedy, who has been on trial
before Judge Campbell for cruelty to Baby
Back master, was pronounced guilty yes
terday morning.
â In accordance with ' the wish of the
court the prosecution produced medical
testimony to show that such bruises as
were on the child's face could only have
been the result of one or more violent
blows,
Drs. E. G. Frisbie and ' D. A. Hodgett
held tbe view that a mild correction, such
as' Kennedy claimed he bad inflicted,
would not have caused discoloration of
the cheeks.
Kennedy called Dr. A. H. Campbell for
the defense. This physiciam, formerly of
the children's ward in the City and County
Hospi Â«1, held that ; he * could not delect
the marks of severe punishment on the
child, the discoloration being but skin
deep, and could have i been caused by 2
gentle taps administered repeatedly. Vy^
A : number of witnesses testified : as to
Kennedy's kindly disposition ; ; and - for
bearance witu children, and as to the good
reputation of the school he conducted.
The defendant J argued Â§ his own;; case.'
making * a strong appeal for clemency.
He confessed to having slapped the baby,
but with no intent to harm it. He told of
bis own life as a child and how his parents
had frequently corrected him. * In , after
years he realized the value of well-merited
chastisement and be believed he would be
failing in his duty if ho did not impose it
when necessary, even ;if it lacerated his
own heart in so doing. * y
Judge Campbell, in passing , judgment,
said there was no doubt in his mind that
Kennedy 1 meant no barm when he pun-'
ished the child, but, still, he had shown
criminal negligence . in A going â¢ beyond the
proper bounds of chastisement. ,y
The court will pass sentence this morn

COLONEL CURRIER
HAS RESIGNED
Profound Disturbance in
the Division Staff,
v N. G. C.
Talk That Lieutenant- H.
P. Bush May B 3 Promoted
to Chic: of Staff
Rumor That S3veral Resignations
Will Follow if the M JDr-Gin
eral Appoints Eu h.
Colonel J. C. Currier has resigned his
position as adjutant-general of the divis
ion, N. G. C. . Major-General James in
approving the resignation said that the
approval was given at the personal request
of Colonel Currier. The general expressed
his regret at the loss of the services of so
valuable an officer to himself personally
as well as to th * Stale of California. *
Yesterday Colonel Currier was advised
of the acceptance of the resignation.
When asked if a recent appointment to
the division stuff had any influence in
Colonel J. CÂ» Curmr.
prompting hi-? resignation he said: "I
was not influenced in my course by any
appointment made or promotion dis
cussed. My relations with General James
have been most cordial and agreeable. I
found that I could not longer attend to
the duties of the position without neglect
ing private Interests which at this time
demand my individual attention."
There is gossip in the National Guard
organizations to the effect that Lieuten
ant-Colonel H. P. Bush, now serving as
judge-advocate of the division, ; will be
promoted chief of staff to fill the vacancy
caused by Colonel Currier's resignation.
Rumor is rife of other resignations. It is
whispered that Colonel Sumner, inspector,
and Colonel D. E. Miles, signal officer,
will resign in the event of Colonel Bush's
promotion to the â¢ position of adjutant
general. Their example may be followed
by other officers. â *}?': 'â¢â *â * y â¢â¢*"Â£ *â¢>.*.*-- ;
A prominent officer commenting on the
contemplated changes remarked: "There
is no objection to Colonel Bush as a man
or a citizen. No one entertains any preju
dice toward him, but there is a feeling
that be is lacking in miliiary knowledge
and experience. It was through his in
fluence in a measure that division head
quarters were established in toe Baldwin
Hotel, The headquarters should not be
in a hotel. It looks too much using
the National Guard to bring business to
the hous**. v When Governor Budd ap
pointed Warfield brigadier-general- he
knew that he was appointing a hotel man
and brigade headquarters might be estab
lished at the house managed by General
Warfield, but it does not follow that the ma
jor-general should also select a hotel for
division headquarters. The allowance for
division headquarters may be larger than
I think it is, but it is my impression that
it is not sufficient to pay one half the ex
pense of the two rooms on the second floor
of the Baldwin." â â *-â -.Â«â¢â¢-
The officers of General James' staff
aside from those mentioned in the fore
going paragraphs are:
Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas M. Cluff, com
missary.
Lieutenant-Colonel William Edwards, ord
nance officer.
Colonel George Stone, engineer.
Colonel John Gailwey. surgeon.
Lieutenant-Colonel F. 8. Pott, paymaster.
Lleutenam-Coionel Thomas A. Nevney, In
spector of rifle practice.
Major G. E. W'ethern, A. D. C.
The gossip goes that several of these
officers will soon tender their resigna
tions. It is I well known that at least
three have said .in private conversation
that they would resign if Colonel Bush
was appointed chief of staff.

CITY WORK
IS URGED
BY LABOR
Bateman Bros. Censured for
Delaying the New
Hall. ";Jj7
"THE CALL'S" POSITION
INDORSED. '
y
No Valid Reason for the Present
Dilatory Tactics Is
Found.
OSCAR LEWIS C PPOSED FOR
SUPERINTENDENT.
It Is Charged That Municipal Con
tractors Are Oppose! to Uaion
Labor on the N w Hall-
Three representative labor organizations
met last night and opposed the'appoint
ment of 0 car Lewis as superintendent of
the new Postoffice building. They also
pat themselves on record as decisively op
posed to the dilatory policy of Bateman
Brothers and others responsible for the
cessation of work on the new City Hall.
The organizations that thus fell in line
with The Call on the question of the mu
nicipal building and gave their own views
on the Federal tendency were the
San Francisco Labor Council, the Distrist
Carpenters' Union and the Building
Trades Council.
The Building Trades Council sent dele
gates to confer with the Labor
Council committee and with them jointly
oppose the appointment of Oscar Lewis
as superintendent of the new Postoffice
building.
The committee from the Disttict Car
penters'and Joiners' Union consists of
the following: J. Connell, J. McCartney
and A. Nichol. Those from the Building
Trades' Council are: J. E. McDougal, A.
L?mmons, Martin Hughe, J. W. Rose,
John Plujs-ard, M. Schwartz and P. Han
non.
The committeemen from the Labor
Council are: W. Macarthur, J. Walters.
Ed Rosenberg, S. L. Collins, William Dove
and President J. Hill. yy;^.y r y-
This body will take action as a joint
committee representing the labor ele
ments of the City, and when its plan of
of action has received the indorsements of
the several bodies which the members rep
resent the finding will be forwarded to
President McKinley and Congressman
Loud protesting against. Lewis' appoint
ment. y \ â  ."y J
A committee, consisting of President J.
Hill. W. Macarthur, 8. L. Robbins, W. V.
Ackerman and J. Walters, were appointed
to confer with the committee appointed
by the Associated Improvement Clubs on
municipal ownership ot gas and water.
The council instructed Secretary Rosen
berg to communicate the council's oppo
sition to the Dingley tariff on tobacco.
S. L. Robbins, delegate from the Typo
graphical Union, claimed the privilege of
the floor to speak on the delay of the con
tractors having the building of the new
Temple of Justice. He said, "The reason,
as I am informed, that the contractors
for the new Temple of Justice have de
layed the building is that there are none
but scab workmen employed. 1 under
stand that Bateman Bros, have stated
that they would not employ union hands
on the building. 'â¢"."'â¢**.' y'y
"The Call has taken up the question of
delay and the Supervisors are following
suit. Therefore it is the duty of this
council to assist The Call and force those
contractors to go ahead with the work.
By dolnc this every business man on the
line of Kearny street will thank us.
"We must land heavily on the backs of
those ducks to make them feel our weight.
Br forcing them to go ahead it will give
200 or 300 men work. The money is lying
in the City treasury ready to be paid out
as the work progresses, yet men are idle
by the treachery of those men."
: Those remarks were indorsed by the
council, and on motion of W. Macarthur,
the subject was referred to the executive
committee for action. . yjj
A communication was received from
George J. Crosby and Harry A. Knox,*
members of the A. R. U. No. 345," asking
for the co-operation of the council on the
Worden matter. -.
To explain what was required of the
council on tbis subject two delegates were
present, who stated that they -had been
informed that Governor Bndd had stated
that he would not interiere with the man
date of the law in Worden's case, but that
he would give a delegation a hearing. In
order to have a .good case to lav before the
Governor the delegates stated that they :
would go fortified | with affidavits showing
that Worden did not have a fair trial and
that his witnesses had been refused a
hearing in court.
All they wanted in â this instance was
funds to prepare those affidavits. On mo
tion $15 was voted for that purpose.
The report of the executive committee
on Hawaiian emigration submitted last
night to the council was an able review of
tbe situation. It quoted the severe penal
labor laws in force in the, islands, as well
as the stringent debt laws obtaining there.!
- The committee found that under these
laws the â â¢ American'- who * went ito j labor
there would be liable to come into prac
tical slavery, not being free to leave the
islands , at , any time he - desired. y This
would be more likely, seeing that the pro
posed co-operative system would : neces
sarily placed- the American in oebt for
many months, thereby, under the island
laws, prohibitme his departure, y \-
Commissioner Fitzgerald had explained
to the committee â that the believed the
Provisional Government would suspend
its f- penal labor ; laws *in favor of ;; the
American laborer; otherwise he would
not"? recommend '- any, immigration. BHe
said Ihe would learn definitely regarding
the -matter from the Hawaiian j Govern
ment. In the absence of any definite in
formation, however, the commiitee ' from'
the labor council erapnatically warned all
workmen against emigrating to the Ha
waiian bland**. *
The Head Nurse Blamed.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury yesterday
in the inquest on the body of Elizabeth Free
bo!en, of 3 Mary' lane, was .to the effect that
death was caused by falling from the balcony
of the City and County Hospital and that the
head uurse was guilty of neglect. y

BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS.
Crop prospects in California have bright
! ened materially since the beginning of
May,' and tne reports now being received
from interiorpoiiits are of an encouraging
nature. The grain yield, as a rule, will be
much better than growers had reason toex
pectfrom the indications on the first of the
month. Under the favorable conditions
of tbe past few weeks, wheat and barley
have been filling out to a considerable ex
tent, although the crop will be short in
comparison with that of last year.
In the Sacramento Valley, the promise
is quite good, as a general thing, a meager
showing in one section being fairly made
up by an abundance in another. This is
particularly true in the matter of fruits
throughout that region. Hops are grow
ing satisfactorily, while the grape crop
bids fair to be. a very profitable one. The
fruit-growers of the lower part of the So
noma Valley are naturally joyous over the
fact that their fruit crop will exceed that
of last year; but their brethren in the
middle and upper end of the valley do
not share their measure of satisfaction,
reports from those sections exhibiting
a variable condition as to Iruit, apples and
prunes making a greater showing than in
1596, but other fruits falling behind, and
making it evident that the fruit crop
there, on the whole, will be rather light.
There will be, it is feared, short crops of
wheat, barley and hay in the Napa Valley,
where the fruit crop, however, is more
promising. The yield of plums and apricots
will be equal to that of last year, and while
peaches do not show up so well as in the
previous season, there is a marked in
crease in almonds and walnuts, and the
vines of Napa Valley are as heavily laden
as ever.
Variable conditions as to the fruit crop,
in comparison with the season of 1806, are
reported from Santa Clara Valley. In the
vicinity of San Jose, the crop, as a whole,
will be much better than that of last year ;
especially is the product larger in apri
cots, peaches, plums, walnuts and cher
ries. The hay crop will be light in the
valley.
The grain crop of the San Joaquin Val
ley has been improved on account of bat
ter weather, and from the Tulare region
comes the assurance of full peach and
pear crops. In Southern California, the
fruit crop will fall short of last year's
product, as a whole, but farmers in the
lower counties have reason to bless the
recent moist weather for the improved
appearance of their grain crops.
We have reason to be thankful for the
outlook as a whole. Some good April rains
would have made us happier by far; but,
considering the reported shortage in East
ern fruit crops, we may possibly hope to
fare better than usual in the matter of
prices.
THE IEEE MARKET.
The second conference of the Harbor
Commissioners with representatives of
various organizations of farmers on the
subject of the proposed free market re
sulted like the first in a demonstration of
the need of fuller information concerning
the probable requirements of such a mar
ket than has been obtained up to this
time. The project is one of the largest
which now engages public attention, ana
so powerfully affects so many Interests
that it would be foolish to enter upon it
until tbe full extent of the enterprise has
been studied out and some definite con
clusion reached as to what is needed and
how it can be best attained.
The delay made necessary in order to
obtain the required information concern
ing the amount of business to be bandied
at the market and the ways and means of
handling it need not De long. At the
present time the Farmers' Club of this
City is engaged in collecting that very
data. At the next meeting, which is to
be held in a short time, it is the intention
of the club to submit statements from
competent authorities on every phase of
the subject. These are to be published
either in full or in their main points and
conclusions, and will therefore furnish to
tbe public as well as to the club the facts
and statistics necessary to anything like a
business consideration of the project.
There can be no question that the peo
ple of San Francisco desire such a market
with as much eagerness as the farmers.
The act of the Legislature providing for
its establishment is as cordially supported
in the City as in the country. All would
like to see the market put into operation
at once. This has been made manifest by
the ardor with which the public has
pressed the Commissioners to start the
work. All who have read the proceedings
of the various confeiences on the subject
have learned by this time, however, that
the enterprise is one of such magnitude
that haste might mean waste, and that
wiÂ«est plan is to follow the old pro
verb and look before we leap.
MORE WAR CLOUDS.
The report that the British Government
has arranged to send to South Africa at
once an army corps of 30,000 men provided
with horses, wagons and ail equipments
for an active campaign is significant of
something more than trouble it ith the
Boers. The un progressive cattle-herders
of the Transvaal, however valiantly they
may defend their own borders, would
never seriously disturb British domina
tion in South Africa, nor give cause for a
war which would involve the transporta
tion of so many troops to the scene of
action. There is evidently another enemy
in sight of the British lion in that quarter
of the world, and it is because of that
enemy he is putting himself on euard.
Recent events show that Great Britain
has reasons to believe that alliances have
been made in Europe which threaten not
only to isolate her so far as Europe itself
is concerned, but to check her advancing
empire in other parts of the world. The
letter of. Kaiser William to President
Kruger may have been only another of the
many indiscretions of speech on the part
of that eccentric war lord, but it showed,
nevertheless, in what direction his sym
pathies tend and how gladly he would
baffle England in South Africa if he could.
- More significant still was the recent
utterance of the Austrian Embassador at
Berlin concerning the objects and the ex
tent of the policy of the 1 newly " : formed
alliance of the three emperors. That
policy, he declared, is to maintain the "ex
isting condition ' of affairs wherever the
influence of the three powers extends. He
expressly included South Africa as within
the scope of the new alliance, and in terms
almost direct gave , notice that Russia,
Germany and Austria would not permit
any further extension of British territory
in that part of the world.
These statements were not idle words.
Germany is - eagerly desirous of building
up a colonial empire. S She has enac'ed
laws to prevent the emigration of her sur
plus population to this country and: to
direct it to her- own colonies. One of the
largest and most promising of these new
foundations is in South Africa. In that
region she has set herself up as a rival to
Great Britain, and therefore regards every
extension of the flourishing colony of the
Cape as inimical to her interests.

BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY
i* The proposition of r Glaus Spreckeis to
coloniz3 for beet culture his lands in the
Salinas Valley on terms that are really
philanthropic in their design, with the
consequent prospect of an immense in
crease in the California yield of beet sugar,
makes appropriate some reference to the
remarkable growth of the beet-sugar indus
try in America.
According to Lewis S. Ware, the eminent
Philadelphia' authority on this topic, the
agitation for the promotion of the beet
sugar industry of the United States was
commenced early in the seventies, at
which time there did not exist a sin
gle beet-sugar 'factory in the;' coun
try. Interest was graaually awakened
among farmers in various parts of the
country and as a result factories were
built in California, "Maine, Delaware and
Massachusetts. The original Alvarado
factory, under intelligent management
and with advantages of. soil and climate
not enjoyed in the East, alone survived. y
The fluctuations that followed are male
evident by impor'ant data furnished by
Willett & Gray. In 1878 the production of
beet sugar was 200 tons; in 1879, 1200 tons;
1880, SCO tons; 1881-S2. less than 500 ton**;
1883. 550 tons; 1884, 953 tons; 1885. 600
tons: 1886, 800 tons; 1887, 225 tons. Wat
sonville and Chino in this State, Norfolk
and Grand Island, Nebr., Eddy, N. M.,
and smaller plants which were established
about this period helped to increase the
United States' annual production of heet
sugar as follows: 1888, 1910 tons; 1889,
2600 tons; 1890, 2800 tons; 1891, 5359 tons;
1892. 12,000 tons; 1893, 20,453 tons; 1894,
20,443 tons 1895, 30,000 tons; 1896, 40,000
tons (estimated).
The practical example of the Alvarado
beet-sugar factory in Alameda County,
where white sugar was early extracted to
find a ready sale in San Francisco, served
to establish a more general faith in the
future of the industry, the possibilities of
which capital was induced to consider
more earnestly.
During the infancy of beet-sugar manu
facture in this country it had to contend
against the sorghum craze, in which mil
lions were invested, but with the aid of
the Agricultural Department at Washing
ton the friends of beet, suear were finally
able to make capitalists understand that
it was through the beet, and through it
alone, that we could produce our own
sugar.
It is confidently claimed that the 40,000
tons now made will be increased within
five years to 100,000 tons per annum. In fact
the beet-sugar industry, the best authori
ties concede, is destined to revolution
ize the farming and manufacturing
industries ot many sections of the
United States, and the day is not far
distant when this country will manufac
ture, all the sugar it consumes. This
means more to California than to any
other State in the Union, for in no other
part of this country are the natural advan
tages of soil and climate so great as those
which we afford for sugar-b.*et culture.
Tbe industry has been taking mighty
strides here year by year, and now, under
the direction of Claus Spteskels, we ere
about to see the largest beet-sugar factory
in the world rise in the Salinas Valley.
The sugar-beet farmer is the most success
ful farmer we have. We want more
Of him. Beet-sugar factories and beet
farms are going to do more for Califor
nia's prosperity than her cold mines.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
That some of the leading statesmen and
thinkers of the Nation are becoming in
terested in the idea of postal savings
banks in tbe United States is a fact which
encourages the belief that favorable legis
lation on the subject will not be very long
deferred. Hon. Robert P. Porter, the well
known statistician, has written a Tetter
strongly advocating the system, which,
be declares, woul I be of incalculable ben
efit to the Government, while its influence
in counteracting any anarchistic tenden
cies would be i-reat.
Quoting tbe last available report, as an
illustration of the working of the system in
Great Britain, he shows there are in the
United Kingdom 5,748,239 open postoffice
savings accounts; and this means that
five or six millions of people have direct
financial dealings with the Government.
He rightly argues that the effect of such
an army of thrifty men, women and chil
dren dealing with their own Government
must be beneficial.
As far back as 1878, a bill for the estab
lishment of such institutions was intro
duced in Congress. r ~J
The measure was lost, but Mr. Porter
remarks that if the bill bad become a law
we should have had several million de
positors, and "there are strong probabili
ties that it would have ended all the wild
financial notions that have brought so
much disaster to the people of the coun
try." â *-'â  j' I
While making inquiry into the working
of postal savings bank 3 In England, Mr.
Porter discovered the interesting fact that
the honor of originating the postoffice
savings banks system in that country was
in a large measure due to Hon. William
E. Gladstone. The growth of the system
in England bas been steady and remark
able. Instead or injuring the private sav
ings banks the latter have gone on in
crea^ing in their deposits. Beginning in
1861 with deposits of $8,000,000, in round
numbers, there was steady increase, until
in 1876 there were overS.O'JO.ODO deposits
and a balance on hand of ; $ 140,0 J0, 000.
Since then these depositories have trebled
their business, and the balance on hand,
exclusive' of investments in Government
stocks, now exceeds $400,000,003.
"The country," says Mr. Porter, "will
recognize at once the universal boon of a
bank thus maintained at the public-ex
pen^e, secured by public responsibility,
with the assets of the Republic for its
capital, with a branch m every town and
village, and numerous branches in every
city, open at almost all hours, and paying
a fair amount of interest. The establish
ment of these banks would do much in
ultimately winning over the vast masses'
of 7 the \ industrial classes of the United
States to those habits of forethought and
self-denial which bring endur n*? ; reward
to the individual and materially add to
the safety of j the state."

DECORATION DAY READING.
The text and illustrations appropriate for D;coration day, which The Call will to-morrow
lay, before its readers, have been got together for the occasion partly through careful research
and application and partly through fortunate circumstances. Without 7 announcing them in
detail, which The Call refrains from for several reasons on special occasions, such as the pres

for the most complete, most readable and most artistic matter pertaining to the great day
which we shall all be celebrating to-morrow will be The Sunday Call. :f 'â¢;. ' '
Turning from features specially designed for ; the occasion the ; reader will drift into the
usual scenic stream of Sunday reading which he or she has become accustomed to in this favorite
California family newspaper, and will glide enjoy ably along it, noting with restful attention
the striking changes in the lettered landscape as each' page is lingeringly passed. : There will
be described at length the projecting and handling of some queer 5 farms which the American
Government been conducting in the Arctic regionsâ the reindeer farms, whose recently
published failure has filled with dismay the Washington officials In charge of it. Nearly
$2,000,000 has been expended In an attempt to propagate reindeer for Alaskan overland nnd
overice traffic. This article in The Call covers the moement from beginning to end and is
comprehensively illustrated. .'Â».. .
r- Among the valuable documents possessed by Hon. Frank McCoppin : at the time of his
death was' an order appointing a Postmaster-General for Ihe State of California. The
order was from Washington and dated 1848, when California was ; so Isolated that jan inde
pendent postal system was necessary. The document is intensely interesting, as is the ac
count of the circumstances connected with it. - The Call to-morrow will present both in full,
Mr. McCoppin having loaned the document to this paper a short time before his death.
Actuated by the numerous reports that the San Rafael County Jail contained a haunted

THE ADMIRAL AND THE NAVAL CONSTRUCTOR.
In November, 1869, a Japanese high commission composed of Prince Wooyeno Pantocno
kami and Prince MlcoaThuneyetobi arrived in San Francisco on their way to the Hawaiian
Islands. The Commissioners were to ascertain the condition of several hundred Japanese who
had left Japan during the revolt there the previous year, and If possible induce them to return
to their native country. :r ' : . v y'
During the sc journ of the Commissioners in this State they paid a visit to the Mare Island
Navy-yard, where they were received by the commandant, Rear-Admiral Craven. The
two .Princes and their suite with the commandant wended- their way irom the guardhouse up
toward the steam engineering buildings, and as the queer-locking procession slowly walked
along it naturally attracted much attention. The peculiar habiliments of the Japs and the
full-dress uniform of the commandant, who ordinarily wore a shabby but serviceable hunting
"The men quit work and stared at the procession."
suit and slouch hat for service in the tules, were something new and startling to the workmen
along the water front, and they quite naturally ceased working and stared at the procession.
The old admiral and visitors first passed the workmen engaged on the sloop St. Marys, ran the
gauntlet of tbo-e on the Os3ipee, and when they came to the Pensacoia still fur trier un the
commandant spoke in an under. to ths gaping workmen something about attending to
their work, but without effect, as when he turned round to see if his order was obeyed he
observed some sixty men in a transfixed state of wonder.
As soon as the visitors had left the yard Craven sent for the captain of the yard, Reed Wer
den, or as he was commonly known, "Black Jack," and instructed him to ascertain what par
ticular quarterman had charge of the men who disobeyed his order. â  Captain Werden went
down to tue Pensacoia and asking one of the carpenters on the wharf who his quarterman was,
he was answered, "His quarterman was Mr. Hill." Upon reporting this to. the admiral the
latter grumbled something about discharging the quarterman and his whole gang, but Cap
lain Werden talked him out of it for the time being. '
It so happened, however, that the admiral and the naval constructor, Ei ward Hartt, were
not on friendly terms, and a few says after/when they nad a disagreement, Craven thought of
the Japanese incident and inquired of Captain Werden if tbe men had been discharged. When
he found they, were still at work he insisted upon the immediate discharge of ihe quarterman,
and the requisition was made out ana sent to the naval constructor, who signed it with the
following indorsement: "Discharged on account of, as the commandant says, neglect of
duty." This, of course, did not put Craven In any better humor, but Mr. Hill was sent for and
told that he was discharged and without a hearing he went over to the Vallejo side.
The queer part of the business was that only two men of the Pensacoia gang which had so
grievously offended* the admiral belonged to Mr. Hill's division, and the others, who were the
real offenders, were under another quarterman.
Constructor Hartt loved nothing better than to fight with a line officer, and told Hill to
lay off for a lew days, when all would be settled. , ...
The next part in the play was Introduced by the constructor sending up a list of dis
charges of sixty shipwrights to the commandant. The latter wanted to know why it was
done, and was told that as he (the commandant) had discharged the quarterman, the men
were without a leader, and work would have to be suspended on the Pensacoia. Craven
fumed, but had to sign the discharge order, and sixty men, none of whom had been guilty of
Ignoring the commandant's or ter of attending to their work, joined Mr. Hill In V/tllejo.
A week passed, when one day Hill presented himselt at the office of the commandint
asking to be informed what trie charges were against him. * Craven told him how the men
had dlsoheved his order by refusing to attend to their work, and how he had naturally tried
to hold the quarterman responsible, but if he (Hill) had -my explanation to offer no d >Ã¼bt
It would be a satisfactory one. Hill took the hint, and wrote a brief letter expressing his
regret at the occurrence. To this document the commandant affixed his signature, and in
dorsed it, "Explanation satisfactory," sent word to the naval constructor to start up again on
the Pensscola. and the quarterman, with his sixty : men, resumed ; work. * The ill-feeling
which existed between the commandant and the naval constructor cost the workmen, col
lectively, about $2000, afforded the constructor much amusement and worried the old ad
miral; but as he retired irJtn the active list on the Ist of January to lowing nothing was
heard from the Navy Department relative to the suspension of work on the Pensacoia. " l

CABS WITHOUT HORSE 5
Operated by power bottled in-New York and
brought to Chicago half a dozen or more com

up and down Michigan avenue next month
says the | Chicago 1 Record. 1 The! horse lessee^,
riages are under construction in the shops Â»
the Hartley Power Supply Company, wherft
one of Fred Stall's pneumatic letter-collectors
runs over the floors. Â , . *
The motocyc which will be turned loose
next month will be the first to be operated by
a company which intends placing the rubber
tire, self-running wagonettes in all thecliy
parks. The system of supplying them with
power is novel, as applied to motocycles, for
the compressed fir will be bottled at a central
power station and sent to* the varum, mo:*).
cycle stands by a compressed-air delivery
wagon.' .Â«â¢ â *Â«-'
Tho first "bottles" will be charged at 2000
pounds pressure to the square inch in New
York, for the company will not have its air
compressing plant in. operation for feveral
weeks. The "bottles" are of steel, made seam
less out of a steel ingot, and are about la
size and shape of. a five-gallon mineral-water
bottle. The skin of the steel bottle is enor
mously strong, so that the ponab'e power re*,-
Pneumatic Postman.
ervoir will safely sustain an interior pressure
of one ton to the square inch. This bottled
energy will furnish enough power to a small
motocycle capable of carrying two men, or a
parcel-delivery wagon, io permit it to travel
twenty miles at a good road speed. This moto
cycle will carry two bottler, so that a distance J
of forty miles can be covered before the pre.-- /
sure is reduced below the working limit. â â '
The engine which will be u-ed on the parcel
delivery bicycle" or the mall motocycle is a
compact, contrivance wiiicu weighs twelve
pounds and which develops two horsepower.
By the arrangement of uoubla pistons the
effect of a compound engine is secured, and all
vibration due to reciprocation of tha parts is
done away with.
If the plans are carried out Chicago In a
short time will have hansom cabÂ» operated by
compressed air running noiselessly over the
streets. In every motocycle is an auxiliary
reservoir, into which the compressed air iron
the bottle is fed, so that the initial storage
pressure is reduced toa woifcing pressure of
from thirty to fifty pounds. Under this reser
voir is an oil fire, which heats the air, ex
panding it so that more .pressure is obtained.
In case the air gives out at points where the
bottled power cannot "be obtained this auxil
iary reservoir can be transformed into a steam
boiler, for the engine is fitted for either air or
steam.
It is said that a mail collector on his air mo
tocycle will be able to make fifty miles a day
with more comfort than he can make thirty
five miles with horse and wagon. *

that left here for Sydney, N. S. \V\, on De
cember 4 last. To complicate matters,
news from Port Townsend had previously
arrived stating that lumber marked in a
similar manner had been passed oft Cape
Flattery. This, however, was later found
to be part of the cargo of the Chilean bark
Antoinette, from Pugot Sound lor Austra
lia, which has since been given up as lost.
The supposition is that the Antoinette and
Samara were in collision during a storm
and both went down with all on board.
| The presence of the wreckage at Samoa
was explained in a letter to W. E. Mighell
which reached here a few days ago. It
was written by Captain Parker of the Dark
Oregon, and in it he says that on January
15 last the vessel ran into a teriific hurri
cane. Heavy seas broke aboard and time
and again it looked as if the bark would
go down. The deckload of lumber â
feet all marked B. B. B. â was swept over
board and with it went the mizzen top
mast ana part of the mizzen ringing.
After a most trying experience Captain
Parker worked his way out of the storm
and finally reached Sydney. His vessel
was docked and repaired and is now on
her way back to San Francisco again.
James Hallinan was arrested by Officer
Bean of the Harbor Police as . c was board
ing the steamer State of California yester
day. He is wanted in Sacramento, where
he worked in the railroad shops, for sell
ing a spurious warrant for $300. He was
about leaving for Portland when caught.
The gunboat Wheeling had another test
over the measured mile yesterday. It
was called "standardizing the screw," and
tests were made at various speeds. The
runs at & speed of seven and eight knots
were once down and back over the mile
course, while at a nine, ten, eleven and
twelve knots speed the gunboat had to go
down twice and buck twice. The tests
were satisfactory in every respect, and the
gunboat will have her official trial trip
to-day.
It was a mistake in stating that the
Piper, Aden, Goodall Company had
abandoned their "silver mine." Tii*?
place where the Sunol turned over and
dumped the bullion into the bay is well
known to the members of the firm, and
they propose renewing operations in the
near future for the recovery of the miss
ing bar?. - -Â- /... Â«â .,-. â  ..--,--.. . %
. The boys of the Naval Battalion ar** 1 to
have a week of drill a*uore and afloat
next July. The Camanche will be put in
commission and the men will be taken to
some suitable place up the river. Tents
will be taken along and after disembark
ing camp will be pitched. All the drills
in the book of tactics will be gone through
and then camp will be struck and the
Camanche will be headed for Hunters
Point. Somewhere in that locality the
anchor will be dropped again and another
camp will be formed ashore and the same
drills gone through with. The cruise will
last a week and Captain Turner expects it
to be of great benefit to the men. During
June Lieutenant Qunn will go out in the
barge Mayflower to select one of the
camping aces and on his return the
battalion ordnance officer will be detailed
to go out in search of the second. W&ss

Pietro Piccetti's body Is at the Morgue,
a victim of his own recklessness. In hi*
anxiety to obtain his hat, which was
wafted from his head by a passing breeze,
Piccetti sprang from Mission-street car

In the art of swinging from a car and lost
his balance the instant his feet touched
the ground, and he fell, striking his head
heavily on the pavement.
The car could not be stopped for some
distance, but when it finally came to a
standstill Frank Lagomarsini, deceased's
employer, accompanied by F. Tyler,
the motorman, and W. Kelso, the conduc
tor, hurried back and carried the injured
man into the drugstore at 4263 Mission
street. Dr.. Tarella was summoned and
he diagnosed the cue as one of concussion
of the brain. Remedies were adminis

a half after the accident occurred, Piccetti
died.
The Coroner' office was notified, and
Deputy Coroner Hailett went to take
char eof the body. When he arrived Pic
cetti's brother and sister, who had been
summoned shortly after the injured man
was removed to the drugstore, offered to
waive an inquest, stating that they had
made an investigation ana were confident
that the deceased was alone to blame for
his death. The deputy refused to accept
the waiver, however, and removed the
body to the Morirue.
The deceased was. a farmhand, about 25
years of age, and unmarried. 7^77 JJ7y

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
In the line of fistic sport the next event
of interest will be the Slavin and Butler
25-round contest at Woodward's Pavilion
on Monday evening. This will be held
under the auspices of the California Ath
letic Club.
The wheelmen have arranged excel'ent
programmes of sport for Sunday and Mon
day.
The lovers of trap-shootinc,, so called,
will have a great day's outing on Sunday.
The annual meeting of the California In
animate Target Association will be held
at . the Alameda Junction shooting
grounds.
Anglers are pleased that the San An
dreas LaKe will be opened to the frater
nity to-morrow.
All other lines of sport are in a healthy
state.
THE WHEELMEN.
Jones and Ziegler Will Meet Again
at the Vallpjo and San Jos?
Races.
Ther3 are two big race meets to enter
tain the wheelmen to-morrow and Mon
day and the prospects are that both will
be well attended by local enthusiasts
although they* are held some distance
away. To-morrow San Jose will make
the first attempt at holding a Sunday
meet there under the auspices of the Gar
den City Cyclers, and Monday the Ariel
Bicycle Club of Vallejo will open its new
trace.
For both meets there is a good pro
gramme, long entry list and valuable
prizes, the second-named feature being in
sured by the first and last. The usual ex
cursion rate of $1 25 for the round trip to
San Jose on Sunday will induce many to
go clown in the morning, though several
parties are being made up to ride clown
a- wheel this afternoon on the Oakland
side. ,'='â¢.>â¢- If
The Vallejo excursion will be made by
boat. The steamer Monticelio has been
chartered, and for $1 one may make the

round trip and have admission to the
races free. The steamer will leave Mis
sion-street wharf at 9:30 a. m., returning
at 6P. M. and midnight. Senator George
E. Dixon and a crew of five will ride the
aextnplet machine at Vallejo, a sight
which alone is worth the trip.
The racers are in splendid condition for
both these meets, having had all. the
training they require, and some splendid
racing should be seen. The meeting of
Jones and Ziegler at both places will be
watched with interest, as Ziegler claims
he is going to wipe out the onus of his de
feat by Jones last Sunday, and the latter
confidently remarks that he don't think
he can do it. "â â *-.' '.-' â >..
Herbert D. Clark of Alameda, who has
gained considerable prominence in cycling
circles here by reason of, his clever writ
ines on the sport, will spend the month
of June in Southern California on his an
nual vacation, and while devoting his
time to recreation of course will find
many opportunities to extol the benefits
of the California Associated Cycling Clubs
to the wheelmen of that portion of the
State. Mr. Clark's .missionary work in
this direction will be productive of much
good in increasing the individual.mem
bership of the association in the south.
The Eastern officials of the League of
American Wheelmen are not going to let
the North California Division die for lack
of attention if they can help it.
Captain Strong, the new chief consul,
who by the way has been a league member,
for eighteen years, says that aa soon as he
can get the run of affairs 'he will give his
attention to recruiting the membership
and making up the lost ground. He feels
confident that the league will 'continue
with a good membership in this State. He
is not going to adopt a policy of fighting
the C. A. C. C, and says that many of its
most prominent members are his personal
friends. Of course there will be no race
meets, as the C. A.-C. C. controls that field
now. But in the way of books, tour
ing, hotel rates, legislative matters and
the like there is much good that the league
can do, and he proposes to direct its ener
gies in that direction.

The California Cycling Club held an
enjoyable dance at Hinman's Hall last
Wednesday evening. Like previous af
fairs of this kind it was well attended by
the members and their lady friends, and
they will look warn to the next one
with pleasurable anticipations.

Catalina Island on a vacation.
, Francis T. Dwyer of Sacramento, vice
consul of the*- league by recent appoint
ment of President Potter, attended tbe
Velodrome meet last Sunday, thereby
sanctioning it by his august presence. Mr.
Dwyer is best remembered by the dele
gates to the C. A. C. C. as the man who
stated three times in one address that he
"paid taxes in seven counties in this
State," and was therefore held in great
reverence by the delegates present, not
one of whom could boast of paying taxes
in more than six counties. Hence he has
been known as Francis '"Tax" Dwyer ever
since that fateful evening. â "."â  J.-'A
E. A. Kolb and Frank Merrill of the
Olympic Club have returned from a two
weeks' wheeling trip to Los Angeles, and
' Mr. Kolb, who has made the journey
twice before, was much disappointed at
the poor condition of the roads now. He
thinKs a heavy rainfall would improve

I Cole were met on the way down. They
â  are expected back to-day.
A great many wheelmen from this City
â  will-make the trip to Sacramento next
j Saturday and Sunday. Saturday night
there the Board ot Governors of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs will be
the guests of the Capital City Wheelmen
for the first time, and the next day that
club will hold a big race meet on its new
three-lap board trac*. George H. Strat
ton of the Olympic Club Wheelmen has
arranged for a special car to leave here
Saturday at 4p. m. and return Sunday
night or Monday morning, and will en
gage as many cars as necessary to trans
port those who notify him they are going.
The round trip fare is $3. Entries lor the
Sacramento meet close to-day.
. A meeting of all the members of com
mittees of the California Associated
I Cycling Clubs was held last night at the
j Olympic Club for the purpose of outlining
I new work and a general interchange of
ideas whereby the association would be
benefited. Many suggestions were ad
vanced, some of which will be adopted,
and it was evident that uot only is the as
sociation in a very flourishing condition,
but it is growing beyond all expectations
and will surpass the greatest hopes of its
I directors.
The members of the Imperial Cycling

A meeting of all the wheelmen of San
Jose has been called for to-morrow morn
ing at 10:30 o'clock at Turn Verein Hall,
and will be addressed by Messrs. Kerri
gan, Wynne, Adams, Welch and others
prominent in. the California- Associated
Cycling Clubs, that the wheelmen of tbe
Garden City may know just what to expect
from the association, what it en tends to
do for them and for the sport in general.
A large attendance is expected. After the
meeting, which will not last long, the vis-'
iting wheelmen, will attend the Garden
City Cyclers' race meet, most of them be
ing down as officials.
Jules F. Hancock of the C. A. C. C. will
leave this morning on a wheeling trip to
Virginia City. Nev., and expects to do
some active work for the association en

mark the route for the new roadbook, and,
returning via Modoc County, will measure
the road down through Placerville. He
will be gone several weeks. Spalding.
THE PUGILISTS.
Slavin and Butler Ara In Great
Condition for Monday Night's
Battle. "...'v-^'^
. The only really good and ' interesting
fight that the sporting fraternity may ex
pect to witness until the National Club
gives its ; next entertainment ' will take
place on Monday evening, under tbe aus
pices of the California Athletic Club, at
Woodward's Pavilion. â ;.* â¢
. Franfc P. Slavin, the great heavy
weight, and Joe Butler, the colored pugi
list of Philadelphia, will have a decidedly
warm passage at arms. Slavin '* is un
: doubtedly one of the gamest fighters that
I ever stepped between the ropes of a ring,
j and as tbis will be the first time he has
actually trained for a. battle since his de
feat by Peter Jackson in England,' his
many admirers expect to see him make
short work jj of Butler. . But the - colored
fellow must not be underrated. ' He. is
said to be as quick as a flash and hits like
a kicking mule.
Butler has whipped some good .men in
the East, and! be says, and very confi
dently, too, that he will have Slavin's
scalp dangling from his be it before the
end of the sixth round. *.*'"â 
There is one thing certain, and it is that
the fight will be a scorcher from go to
. fiuish. Tne pugilists are heavy punchers
and knockdowns will doubtless be many
during the time of battle. â  This will be
Slavin's first appearance in â  San- Fran
cisco, and as he will:ente.*",|theTl*ing in
splendid fettle for a sharp and punishing
light, the i atrons of the game can count
upon seeing a great battle. .
Slavin has a long string of , victories to
his credit. .He-defeated' Billy^Farnum;
t who was the only pugilist that ever low
ered the colors of Peier Jackson. He also
, whipped Joe Goddard.'-'the Barrier chain-,
pion," : in one 4 round ; Joe McAuliffe yin
two rounds, Jake \ Kiirain ? in * one round,

one round, Mick Dooley in three rounds,
and fought a four-round draw with Peter
Maher. Slavin pays no attention to the
fights he bas had in the East, as he had
not trained for any of them. If he whips
Butler he will be ready to meet Jeffries or
-Shy heavy-weight, bar none.
According to Butler's record the colored
pugilist must, be a heavy puncher. The
men who went down before him are:
Henry Baser, C. C. Smith (the "Thunder
bolt"), F. Craig, Joe Goddard, Ed Binney,
Jim Daly, Proiessor Banks, George Read
ing, George Williams and other lesser
lights. '
If Butler wins he will send on a chal
lenge to fight Bob" Armstrong, who is
"Parson" Da vies' protege. yJ.y . ; ,
The preliminaries to Monday evening's
entertainment should furnish good sport.
Saramie Maxwell of Scotland will meet
Frank Rafael in a ten-round bout and Ike
Rubenstein of Sacramento will meet for
the second time Tora Cooney of Boston.
As there is "bad" blood existing between
the two last-named fighters a hurricane
battle may be looked for.
Who will now fight George Green? is
a question that many people ask, but an
swers are scarce.
Tommy Ryan is the only man who is a
fit candidate for the job, but Ryan cannot
do battle under 150 pounds and fight
strong, consequently there is little hope
Jot Butler of Philadelphia and Frank Slavin.
of a meeting between Tom and George.
Green says that be will not fight in futur â¢
any opponent who will scale over 145
pounds, and that if Ryan will agree to go
him a twenty-round rncs at or under the
welter-weight limit he can be; accom
modated. 'â¢â -j'yyy'-'ry -v;.;. y--
"They all say that I cannot fight under
150 pounds," said Green, "but I will fool
the wiseacres when any of --the welters
will agree to meet me at weight. I am
not a middle- weight yet, but I guess after
I am a little older I must tackie some of
the light middle-weights, and perhaps I
may beat some of them too, who knows? '
It was stated yesterday! that the Cali
fornia Athletic Club had - signed "Kid"
Lavigne to fight ,'- McKeever yat catch
weights some time in the latter part of
June. v .."gSMJiEBCaWBgf
It will- be remembered - tbat McKeever
had the . best of the "Kid", in an .engage
ment they had in Philadelphia some
time ago, and now the "Kid is desirous
of a return match. He will find a hard
nut to crack when he meets McKeever,
unless he V alters -bis idea of fighting at
catch weights. In first-class condition La
vigne will tight at 138 pounds, but in this
glorious climate pugilists run .' up in
.weight, and doubtless "the Kid" will scale
140, which will be about five pounds less
than bis opponent will scale.' McKeever
will develop during his sojourn on this
coast. ' Consequently there i is no telling
what weight he may fighi at when he en
ters the ring next. - y - . â¢
There is very little said of the Olympic
fights. OjDonnell is training hard for his
contest with Greggains, but judging from
the records of the fighters there should be
only one man in the game, and his name
is "Steve."; O'Donnell is a more polished
fighter than Greggains and having more"
science, height, weight end experience it
is hard to imagine where Greggains ill
get off, unless it is on lie small side of the
purse. His only hope ol success is in
punchingâ that is, if .he: can â the heart
out of O'Donnell before Steve gets a move
on. y History says that . when O'Donnell
is scoring a lead he makes short work of
his opponent, but he cannot relish an up

THE ANGLER.
Why the Trout of San Andreas Lake
Are Small This Year.
' ; The San Andreas 7 Lake will receive a
good dragging Sunday and Monday, not
by nets, as may 'â â  be supposed, bpt by'
spoons and spinners attached to the ends
of silk lines.
! Sunday -will inaugurate the opening of
the fishing season â¢at that Jake/ al hous b
the water company did not propose to
issue permits until July L ; .*;.:-
The fishes average ,very ! small this year
- - :-**â .:*---... â -... â  - " â 
in size and anglers will note when they
put up their rods after the day's enjoy
ment that the trout will run about half a
pound each in weight.
It is said that the large fishes, which
were so plentiful last year, fell victims to
the attacks of coons, cats and cranes last
winter wnen they left the deep water for
the spawning beds in tne small streams
that act as feeders to the lake.
The former keeper of the lake, Mr. Kerr,
who made a study of the fishes and their
habits, invariably kept a sharp lookout
for the breeders during the winter season,
and when they became landlocked in
some of the small pools of the streams he
netted them out and returned them to
deep water, thus saving great numbers of
large trout.
Doubtless Mr. Richardson, the present
keeper of the lake, who is most obliging
to visitors, will look out for the fishes
next winter. y y : y
The Wilson spoon is, as formerly, a most
killing lure, but anglers who prefer using
the fly will find that good results will ac
crue from trolling a cast slowly along the
west shores of the lake. Three small flies
of midget size are best, and from an ex
perience two anglers had last Sunday the
fly fancied most was a close imitation oi a
mosquitoâ dark brown body, gray hackle
and slate-color wing, size 16.
Good reports have been received from
Boulder Creek and. some of its tributaries.
Messrs. Cooper and Walker bad good suc
cess last Sunday. The streams with
easy reach of ; Ukiah and Cloverdale are
now in excellent order for fly-fishing, and
several city anglers who fished in the vi
cinity of Ukiah during the past week re
turned with well-filled baskets.
It is said that the Fish Commissioners
are taking thousands of bass fry from the
Russian River, and local anglers are pro
testing against .what they call "too much
of a good thing."
THE YACHTSMAN.
The Callfornlas and the ; Corln-
thlans Will Hold Regattas To-
Morrow and Monday. ,'
On Monday next the . Corinthian Yacht
Club will hold its twelfth annual regatta.
The owners of the different ; boats have
gone to great trouble and expense to pat
their yachts in winning trim, and as the
interest is unabated the races on . Decora
tion day should be the best that have ever
been seen on our bay. â¢ /* '
On the 'first beat to the Presidio Shoal
buoy it will be a flood-tide race, but as it
is high tide at 1:10 p. m. at Fort Point the
chances are that a strong ebb will be run
ning when the boats beat out for the sec
ond time. .j
.In' the. first class the principal struggle
should be between the Eliaand the Speed
well, as the Clara has not been sailing' in
hor true : form, owing to the number of
alterations she has undergone.
.The Speedwell points higher and will
probably gain a great deal on the beat to
windward, but the Elia should make
the time in the run and the reach. - r
- Ed Donohoe- has lightened the Speed
well by removing about twelve hundred
pounds of. ballast,; so as to give the boat
greater buoyancy and speed. '
The, Pride's '-topmast* and rigging have
been removed, and Eidie Lathrop thinks
his alteration will jbe<; a; great improve
ment. The Pride has never been. properly
tried out, but Lathrop will surely get out
all the speed that is in her. Ay.
.; Judging from ; the performance of s the
boats up to date the Speedwell should wip.
In the second class the race will be be
tween the Harpoon and Queen." The Har
poon has this season shown herself to be
a much improved boat and should easily
win out. -.-â¢*.â â¢,. ,.'-.-', . yy vl
In the 30-foot class ex-Commodore Pew
has decided not to race his Truant, but he
will sail the jEolus. ' r -. '-JJ-rAJ.
I The latter boat baa been fitted with a
new weighted -,centerboard, ; which it is
hoped will; greatly; steady her Jin a blow
and improve her sailing qualities. .;;...
I Numerous changes have also been made
on i the ? Atnigo, which % have j greatly 'im
proved her. as was seen by fine show
ing she made in the open Ing cruise. She
.will be sailed by Frank Stone. yy ,
The 'Minnon ;,\%: an excellent heavy- 1
weather boat, and ;ini a; heavy blow will
surely five a good account of herself.
The JEW us should win in her class.
yln the 25-foot class the Phoenicia stands
the best chance of winning.
In the foot class the boats are mostly
new and it is difficult to get a line on
them. If there is a hard blow some of
the latter may not start, but nothing less
than a hurricane will prevent Frank
Baker from sailing over the course in bis
Phyllis.
In the yawl class the Guinevere proved
herself to be a fast boat in the last regatta
and will probably win.

ASSOCIATION
An Important Body Organ

Ciubs. -
San Francisco, Oak. Fresno and
Los Angles Start the Ball of
Reform Rolling.
Fifteen gentlemen representing amateur
athletic interests of this State met last
night in executive session in the directors'
room of the Olympic Club.
The principal point of discussion was as
to the relative Btandinir of clubs devoted
to general athletics and those devoted to
some special branch of the same. V-y* ;
The meeting was a unit in the senti
ment that clubs which are devoted to spe
cial athletics, such as boxing clubs, row
ing clubs, bicycle clubs, etc., should not
have the same representation in the new
association as clubs, associations, universi
ties, etc., devoted to general atnletics. It
was agreed that it would be better for the
special clubs to form an association of
their own.
* The object of the proposed organization
is ultimately to relieve amateur athletics
from the evil influences of professional
sport.
Said Chairman W. P. Lawlor: -'We are
to have legitimate amateur athletics on
the Pacific Coast, which cannot be found
anywhere else in the United States, and
we will insist that no amateur athletic
club shall have any professional contest?."
At last night's meeting of the Olympics
of San Francisco, the Acmes of Oakland
and the Fresno Athletic Cub were repre
sented by delegates. Secretary J. P.
Cooke reported that Los Angeles had sent
a communication approving of the object
of the meeting and promising co-opera
tion.
R. M. Welsh and A. T. Swain of the
California Cycle Association were present
and expressed their intention, since they
have retired from the L. A. W., to affiliate
with the elements represented at the meet
ing.
As a result of the discussion the follow
ing resolutions were unanimously
adopted:
Resolved, That it be the sense of this meetiDg
that a new amateur athletic association, to
be hereafter named, be formed, which pro
posed association shall exercise jurisdiction
over all Pacific Coast States and shall be com
posed of legitimate amateur athletic associa
tions or clubs organized for the purpose of ad
vancing general and not special athletics.
Resolved, That it is tho sense of this meeting
that a committee of three be appointed to
adopt a plan of action or to comer with ama
teur athletic club* or associations in the vari
ous Pacific Stales other than those which have
expressed the intention both formally and in
formally' of joining. in this movement, and
requesting them to send delegates either lv
person or by proxy to attend the first meeting
of that association, to be held at the rooms of
the Olympic Club on Wednesday evening,
June '23.Uy.yJ. y - -*â **-
J. J. Allen of the Acme Athletic Club,
G. E. Wenzel of the Fresno Athletic Club,
and Howard P. Taylor Jr., of the Olympic
Club were appointed the committee pro
vided for in the foregoing resolutions.
Each of those gentlemen is to appoint an
alternate. yy

An Alarming Increase of
Counterfeit Half-
Dollars.
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

Pure Metal Used and Enormous
Profits Are Reaped
-Vy Thereby.
MEXICO THOUGHT TO BE THE
SOURCE.
Great Difficu ly Experienced in Dis
tinguish ra*-- These Coins From
. ths Genuine. â Â»
The Government Secret Service officials
are confronted just now by a problem
which, though not altogether new to
them, has developed to such magnitude
and threatens such alarming results as to
inflict upon them considerable worry and
anxiety. "
This disturbing problem is the discov
ery that the flooding of the country with
counterfeit half-dollarsâ but half-dollars
made of pure silver is on the increase.
The exasperating feature of these coun
terfeits is their remarkable resemblance
to the genuine article, . and; in conse
quence, the innocent handling of them all
over the country without detection of
their spuriousness. Being of silver they
naturally have the proper rinc, the slip
pery feeling so noticeable in bogus coins
is conspicuous by its absence, and to any
but a trained eye they appear to be all
right. The banks receive them without
que-tion, and pass them out again into
lie world's traffic.
It was some two years ago since Uncle
Sam's Ha wkshaws first learned of this dan
gerous scheme for robbing the Government
of its profits of coinage, and the cleverness
of the scheme ; fairly staggered them.
They had lound it comparatively easy to
pet on the scent of counterfeiters who
turned teat imitations in cheap metals,
and to run down the culprits. The bonis
coin was. always so quickly detected and
invariably left tcll-taie tracks behind it.
Bui here was ***- conspiracy of a higher or
derâso perfect, in fact, in its details as to
b-lrle all efforts to trace ii to its source.
During ihese past two years the Secret
Service agents in various parts of the
country have labored indefatigably to run
'.own the gang engaged in turning out
these half-dollars, but have met with
little or no success. ' "y\
Several months/ago they thought they
had a Clew, which" led them across the
broad Pacific in search of the supposed
counterfeiter's den. Their information
was that it was located in China, but if it
was they coaid not find it. Their latest
''tip was to the effect tbat the spurious
mint was situated in Mexico, but they
have as yet bÂ»e*i unable to develop any
thing definite out of it.
A ioush estimate by those in authority
puis the amount of these spurious silver
half-dollars in circulation to close upon
$l,0iX).00O. and that being the case the
profits of the counterfeiters must be tre
mendous^ These coins are spurious only
in the sens 1 that they are not authorized
or maim.actured by the United States
Government In other respects they are
pure enough. They have been assayed by
the 1 cal Sub-Treasurer "and hays been
locnd to differ but slightly from the genu
ine half-dollar.
Where the counterfeiters' profits come
in lie in the fact thai enough silver bullion
can be purchased right now in open mar
ket for 24 cents to make a half-dollar.
The conspirators have not attempted to
i urn out any dollars, because there is so
much more in it for them to stick to the
half-dollars. In the ordinary dollar there
are thirty-two more grains of silver than
there are in two half-dollars. The coun
terfeiter**' profits in issuing the latter are
a. lenstlOU per cent on every coin.
'Ihe fact that the interjection of this
sputioijs coin into general circulation has
-'eveioped an alarming mc. ease oi late is
worrying the authorites most.
"This is one of the most exasperating
schemes we have ever bad to deal with,"
said one of the, 'local Government agents
yesterday. "The bogus character of the
coins ii so difficult to detect that they pass
,m hand to dand daily and the resuit is
that when we yet hold of them we find it
absolutely impossible to trace them back
to their sources. It is only when tney tali
into the sub- treasury that we have an op
portunity to destroy them and put them
out of circulation. B-t, as you Ran read
ily see, it is only a small percentage of
them that ever reaches that place. We do
not know where the bogus money is being
manutacturedand, lor that matter, do not
careâ a.i we want is to locate the den and
break up tne business."
At the sub-treasury it was stated yester
day that Dot as many of the spurious sil
ver half dollars are received there nowa
days a- was the case some months ago.
Formerly, tin. bulk of tnem were re
ceived irom the banks, and hod b^en gath
ered in the cour.-e of collections from
everywhere, So '.hat there was no such
thing as tracing them bacK again to their
respective sources, even if that would have
done ;.r.,y*Li; d. In these catses the sub
treasurer-would cancel the coins by mutil
ating them in such a way that they could
not be used again, and they were in con
sequence worth after that but their bul
lion-weight to the bank â a loss of fifty per
cent. I'iie banks, finding that the coins
passed readily back into general circula
tion, ceased to risk the loss incidental to

J "We probably receive now about $18 in
these halves a month," said Assistant.
Sub-Treasurer Tom Burns yesterday. "Of
course we cancel them all. There is no
question about their being the cleverest
counterfeits and the mo-t difficult to de
tect that we have ever bad to deal with.
It is only by the closest scrutiny that the.
ordinary individual can distinguish them
from the genuine article. No, so far as I
know, the Government officers have not as
yet been able to ascertain in what part of
the world these coins are being manufac
tured." yj/jjy-Ayyy. lyyyyy...
An idea of the vast number of these
half-dollars that must be in circulation
herein San Francisco is drawn from the
experience related by Ernest Haquette,
the Kearny-street saloon man.
"When I found that spurious half-dol
lars were in circulation several months
ago I made it my business to examine tne
money I took over the bar very carefully,"
he said last evening, "and I found that
I was taking in on an average of eighteen
or twenty of them every day. My patrons
began to look upon me as a crank, how
ever, because of my tendency to scrutin
ize every coin put upon the bar, and some
of them even grew indignant, so I gave up
the practice. They are made of good sil
ver and will pass anywhere â even at the
banks. I have not the slightest idea how
many of them pass through my hands
now, if any, for I don't look for them. It
is a dangerous conspiracy, however, and
it behooves the Government to resort to
herculean efforts in order to stop this
bogus coinage." ,y :
M'BRIDE ARRESTED.
While Acting as a United States Sentry
He Shot a Hole Through a
Boat.
A. V. Scheppelman applied to the United
States Attorney yesterday aiternoon for a
warrant for the arrest of Thomas McÃride
on a charge of assault with intent to com
mit murder.
McÃride is connected with the commis
sary department of that part of the United
States army stationed at the Presidio, but
he is not an enlisted man. His duty is to
guard the wharf at the Presidio, which is
on Government ground, and to keep away
trespassers by land or water. V
Last Tuesday Scheppelman and a friend
| were in a rowboat and approached the
I wharf. He ordered them to keep away,
j but they paid no attention to the order,
I whereupon Scheppelman says that Mc
i Bride fired a shot out of his revolver, the
I bullet boring a hole iv the boat and al
! most scuttling it ' ;
A warrant was issued out of the Police
| Court yesterday morning lor McÃride' a ar
i rest, but the military authorities declined
| to allow a municipal or State official to
serve a paper or make an arrest on Federal
1 territory. Hence the warrant was issued
1 by a Federal officer. - - :
SLOTS ARE NUISANCES.
Opinion of the Attorney of tbe
Health*- Department
â¢ y Filed. '>-
The Board I; Given Advice as to the
â¢V- Bst Method of Hay the
Nuisance Abated
Attorney Garret McEnerney's long-de
layed opinion as to whether unused cable
road slots are a nuisance within the mean
ing of the Jaw has been presented to the
Board of Health. It reads a-, follows:
In answer to your â¢ communication : of the
â  20th Inst., calling my -attention to previous'
! communications on the subject, .relating to
j the duty of street-railroad companies- of San
'â ' Francisco in relation to the streets upon which.
j â¢they maintain their tracks, I beg to" report as
j follows? ? *** ' ""* ". ".., .;.. ' '-. "'
1. If a' street railroad company violates its.
franchise or abandons the. use of it an action:
J can be brought in the name ot the people of
the -State of California by the Attorney- j
| General, or with his permission, to forfeit the j
iranchise lor misuser or non-user, us the case
I may be. '.
I" 2. "1f a railroad company maintains a nui
sance in the. form of a non-used cable roadbed,'
I with an open slot, which allows debris to col
lect there in a manner injurious to the health
j cf an entire community or neighborhood or
any considerable number of persons, that con
stitutes a public nuisance. A public nuisance
can be abated in an action brought in the
name of the people of the Slate of California
by or with permission of the Attorney-Gen
eral. 1 would . have replied to your communi
cation of April 21 earlier, but I desired to
satisfy myself whether an action could be
maintained to abate all the unused tracks of
one company in one action, or whether a
separate action would have to be brought on
account of each franchise. lam not yet satis
fied that they can be included in one action,
and, as at present advised, I think the safer
course would be to bring an action on each
separately. -~ â¢â¢â¢ -'.?-*>
! Whether the maintenance of these. unused
cable roadbeds constitutes a public nuisance
or not is a question of fact of which the Board
of Health is a better judge than I am.
The duty of a street railroad to keep the
Streets upon which its roadbed is lv good re
pair is to be found iv section 493 of the Civil
Code, subdivision 2, winch provides that the
municipal authorities in granting a ritrnt of
way to street railroads must require tbe per
son to whom the franchise is g.ven to piank,
pave or macadamize the entire length of the
street used b/ their track between the raits
and for two feet on each side thereof, and â  be
tween the tracks, If there be more than one,
and to keep the same constantly in repair,
flush with '.lie street, and with good crossing.
This law has been 'n effect since March 21),
i 1870 (see statutes of 1869-70).
By reference to tbe act of .March 29, 1870, It
i will be seen that the railroads were required
j to pave or macadamize as the municipal
I authorities might direct. The provisions of
the Civil Code now in lorce and above men
tioned do not in terms authorize, the muni
cipal authorities .to designate where it shall
be planked, paved or macadamized. It may
be mat they would be authorized in granting
the franchise to designate whether it should
be planked, paved or macadamized. On the
other hand, It might be claimed by the rail
road corporations that they were authorized
to either plank, pave or macadamize, as they
should choose, and without regard to the kind
of material with which the street immediate.
adjacent was improved. It is m opinion,
however, that a fair construction of the stat
ute would require them to conform to the kind
of material use i on the street or streets upon
which their roadbed was laid.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY Â»J9, 1897.
MRS. HINCKLEY IS
NOT IN CONTEMPT
Denies That Judge Hunt's
Order Was Handed
to Her.
Charles S. Bartlett's Queer Antics
While Trying to Serve a
Summons.
, - â â¢ â¢ -Jr' '-J'-'y: ' '
stion of Veracity Raised in Which
There Is a Man on One Side and-
Two Women on the Other.
Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinckley has
temporarily escaped the penalties of con
tempt of court yesterday because Judge
Hunt has not been fully convinced that
she was legally summoned to appear, be
fore a notary public and give her deposi
tion in the case of Bergin vs. Hinckley.
Several days ago an affidavit signed by
Charles S. Bartlett ' was filed in Judge
Hunt's court alleging that the affiant
served on Mrs. Hinckley tue summons of
the court which directed that she s.iould
give her deposition at tbe time and place
specified. It was shown that Mrs. Hinck
ley failed to appear, and thereupon the
order was issued that she should be com
pelled to show cause why she should not
be punished for contempt of court for dis
regarding the court's mandate.
When the case was called yesterday |
Mrs. Hinckley was not present, but At
torney VV. H. H. Hart, representing the
lady, presented her affidavit setting forth
that no service of the summons had been
made on her, for which reason she did not
consider herself legally bound to visit the
notary public. ' y '^ryJiJ .'--.- -- - .
An affidavit signed by Mrs. Mary Hinck
ley was also presented corroborating all
that Mrs. Florence Hinckley had said.
Mr. Bartlett was called to the witness
stand 'and flatly contradicted the ladies.
He said he went to the Hinckley residence
in Fruitvaie; that he met Mrs. Mary
Hinckley and told her he was sent by
General Hart to see Mrs. Florence Hinck
ley, and that Mrs. Mary Hinckley told him
that the lady was not to be seen. '
"I heard Mrs. Florence Hinckley at the
piano in the next room, the door of which
was open, and recognized her voice," con
tinued Bartlett. "So I knew she was at
home. I went outside the house and
waned lor awhile in the shadow of tbe
stable. Then I slipped along under the
hedge un.il . I came to the back yard.
While there I heard a child calling,
'Auntie, auntie,' and saw Mrs. Florence
Hincklej standing before me. I went up
to her and handed her the two papers that
I was to serve on her. She exclaimed,
'Oh my 1' and hastened into the house. I
knew her because I had seen her before."
Bartlett said he went to serve the pa
pers to accommodate a iriend, and be
cause he had heard that Mrs. Hinckley
wanted to borrow money, and he had a
friend who had cash to lend. â -â  *
"Did you. talk to her auout the money
proposition when you handed her those
papers?" asked Judge Hunt. . VJ..J-1
.'.'No." Jj::J'.,-' â .. - - :-,â â ; .. *-â Â£*Â£â¢*&
â  â â 'Why., didn-'t you step into the room
where you say Mrs. : Hinckley was' at the
piano and serve the papers on her then?"
"Because I didn't want to do anything
ungentle manly." . *â  ~- -*â¢*â¢' *- .**.â 
The . court was curious !to know if that
was the consideration which impelled him
to say he was from General Hart's office,
and to slip along the hedge to the back
yard, but Bartlett made no response. ' '
Mrs. Mary Hinckley was sworn as a wit
ness, and disputed Barilett'sstory at every
point. She said that Mrs. Florence
Hinckley was in' the children's bedroom,
and that she was not at the piano, is
Bartlett swore; that she did not go out
into the yard at the time he said he saw
her there, and that --'he explained that she
toid him that Mrs. Florence Hinckley had
not seen anybody since the death of her
husband. JJy.-j. ..'â * M y
Judge Hunt intimated that he was not
particularly impressed with Bartlett's ex
planation; but he would give him an op
portunity to establish bis position if he
could do so, and continued the hearing
until next Tuesday, at which time Mr.
Hart promised that Mrs. Florence Hinck
ley will be in court and submit herself to
examination by court and counsel. He
added that there was no occasion to go to
trouble in serving papers on his client, as
be is authorized to acknowledge summons
for her in any and all litigation in which
she is a party in interest.
THOMAS I. BERGIN'S FEE.
He Asserts That Florence Blythe-
Hinckley Owes Him $50,003
for Legal Services.
Thomas I. Bergin, through bis counsel,
Sullivan & Sullivan, is seeking -to obtain
from Florence Blythe-Hinckley the sum
of $50,000 alleged to be dv* to him for legal
services rendered as her attorney.
When proceedings were instituted in
court to establish the right of Florence
Blythe to inherit the vast estate of
Thomas Blythe the law firm of McAllister
& Bergin was engaged- to assist W. H. H
Hurt. Much of the early law work in the
case was done by this firm.
As time wore on, Mr. Bergin's health
began to fail, and Mr. McAllister died.
Then Mr. Bergin sought and obtained an
adjustment of tbe agreement regarding
the compensation for his services, consent
ing to take a smaller sum than was stimu
lated in the original agreement. The
McAllister estate was then paid for
services performed up to the time of Hall
McAllister's death, and Mr. Bergin re
ceived a satisfactory sum for his own work
up to thai date.
Later on, Mr. Borein'*** health was in
stored, and his services were again
solicited. Florence BJythe, who had then
attained an age that permitted her to act
as a free agent, entered into an agreement
to pay Mr. Bergin for additional services.
The sum which Mr. Bergin now seeks
through his attorneys to obtain, from
Florence Biythe-Hiuckley is wholly,inde
pendent of the amount -involved* in the
percentage agreement existing between
her and W. H. H. Hart. Mr. Bergin does
not look to Mr. Hart for his fee of $50,000.
He expects Mrs. Hinckley to pay him, al
leging that she so agreed, and was compe
tent to make the agreement. He .desires
tbat she shall produce in court letters bear
ing on the subject and a blank copy of
the agreement.

RESPONSIBILITY OF
TOWBOAT PILOTS
Opinion of United States
District Judge Mor
row.
Masters Are Presumed to Know
Where Danger Lies
Ahead.
Removal- of a Buoy Unknown to a
y Pilot Affords No Excuse for
an Accident.
United States D : strict Judge. Morrow
yesterday rendered an opinion in the mat
ter of the petition of the Shipowners' and
Merchants' Tugboat Company, owner of
the steam tugs Hercules and Sea Queen,
for a limitation of liability. â¢ -~- J-' i
The petition was filed in the matter of
two libel claims against the companyâ one
by Arthur Sewall and others for damages
in $20,000 for towing the ship Benjamin F.
Packard on a sunken rock in San Fran
cisco Bay, and the other by Balfour, Guth
rie & Co. for $484 54, damages to a portion
of the cargo of wheat. The petitioners
asked that the liability of the owners of
the tug should be limited to the value of
the tug ii it should De determined that
there was any liability.
The petitioner contended that the acci
dent was excusable and inevitable, owing
to the fact that the buoy/had been re
moved and was misplace* i, thereby deceiv
ing the master of the tug as to the course
which he should take in towing past the
rock. On the other hand it was contended
by the claimants. that although the buoy
had been removed some 200 leet from its
habitual and correct position,' yet that the
master of the tug should have noticed this
displacement of the buoy, and that he was
bound to know at least approximately the
locality of the submerged rock. Judge
Morrow's decision goes on to say:
In the Effie J. Slmonds case (6 Fed. 639) it
was held that a tug is bound to know the
nature of the bottom as well as the depth of
the water in which it is being empioyeu. In
the Vigilant (10 Fed. R. 765) a tug was held
liable for the l>*ss of her tjw in consequence
of stranding her upon a depression or hole in
the surface of the bar over which she was be
ing towed. In the Robert H. Burnett (30 Fed.
K. 214);ihe court said: "The captalu of the
lug tes.iiies that he had been ruiuiugon the
river lor a year or more, but that he had no
knowledge oi the position of this rock and had
never heard of the reef. This admission of
ignorance of notorious facts, about which
there can be no question, leaves him without
any excuse for going so near the western shore
as he did,"
Applying the law as established by these
cases, it lo.lows that the master of the Hercules
should have had such familiarity with the
location of the Mission hay Rock, even,
though the buoy indicating where it was had
been displaced some '200 feet, that that dis
tance at the short range from Long Wharf,
where the towage began, would be sufficient to
have been observed by a careful pilot. The dif
ference in position between the buoy from the
place where|it should have been to where it was
irom Long Wharf was about one point and a
half. * * * This displacement was certainly
sufficient to appr.se the master of the Her
cuies that something was wrong with the po
sition of the. buoy. if he had given It any
attention whatever it should have put him on
inquiry. He did not take any bearings to as
certain whether tho buoy was in the correct
position. , 'â  â¢â¢' J.l â  yy
i While it is true that there is a presumption
that the buoys correctly indicate the places,
still it does not justtiyj navigators â 'â *;. * * in'
following blindly .these signals of danger. Ou
the contrary the* very efficiency- o4 the tug-,
boat service requires that mas. era should be,
on the watch lor * any change ln**sl*fnals of.
danger, so that the places of danger them-!
selves may be avoided. * ':.* * It is a well
known fact that buoys are apt to be moved,
and this fact should put masters on the alert
to ascertain whenever a displacement has oc
curred, In the case at bar ii wou.d teem from
the testimony of the master of the Hercules
that he did uot even lock to see whether the
buoy was in place or not.
Upon all the facts of the case, I think that*
the stranding of the ship Benjamin F.Pack
ard was due to negligent towing on the part of
those iv charge of the tugboat Hercuies in the
particular above indicated. But as there is no
proof of any privity or knowledge of this neg
ligence on the part of any of the members of
the company, the owner of the tug, the liabil
ity will be limited, to me appraised value of
the tug, the sum Of $4000.
Messrs. Page, McCuichen and Eels ap
peared as proctors for the petitioner,' and
Messrs. Andros and Frank for the claim

ROBINSON ACQUITTED.
Verdict of "Not Guilty" Given by the
Jurors Without Leaving
Their Seats.
C. P. Robinson, charged with perjury, was
acquitted In Judee Carroll Cook's court yes
terday. The court advised the jury that the !
prosecution had failed to make out a case that
would warrant a verdict against the de
fendant, .and the jurors declared Robinson
not guilty without leaving their seats.
After the jury had been discharged W. E.
RoDinson, a brother of the accused, met T. B.
Maxwell, the complaining witness, in the cor
ridors and assaulted him. ---â¢'Â«,."-:'
Mrs. Maxwell rushed into the courtroom and
deuiauaed that Judge Cook, who was still ou
the bench, should protect her husband, say
ing that he was about to be murdered by the
Robinson-, and their friends.
' Judge Cook told the lady that ho regretted
-hat he had no authority to extend her the re
lief she desired unless a formal complaint be
made out, and he suggested that the Police
Court was the proper tribunal to hear her
cnarge against Robinson."
The court expressed some surprise that one
of the Robinsons should be tne assailant in
this matter, as.it seemed that the Maxwells
were the ones who had lost the money that
led to this litigation.
VINING NOT A JUROR.
Legally Excused Because He Is Super-
intondent of a Street Railway
, Company.
E. P. Vining was summoned to serve as a
juror in Judge Dunne's department of , the Su
perior Court, and yesterday filed an affidavit
setting forth that he ii exempt from jury duty
express provision of section 200 of the Code of
Civil Procedure.
An; examination of the law disclosed that
Mr. Vining was right, in his contention) and
ho was relieved from further attendance, the
law taking it for granted that he could be of
more service to the community, by looking out
for the safety of his passengers, by providing
car-fenders and otherwise, than by Fitting as a
juror to determine disputes among local liti
gants. ' â 'â¢ J } .r'-- ; â  ''â ''''.â ':
The existence of the statute exempting sup
erintendents of street rai ways from jury duty
was nevertheless a surprise to court and coun
sel, until attention was called to the matter by
Mr. Vining'a % affidavit. It has' been on . the
books for some time, but its enforcement was
never invoked before. ..-

Long before the hour announced for the

Shortly before 11 o'clock Lieutenant
Bird sail, in charge of a squad of police,
formed on the steps of the cathedral, and

100 Postoffice clerks came in a body with
delegates from the City Hall.. : Jy-yCJr}. Jy
At the right of tbe cathedral entrance
stood the, floral piece sen t"'*by the letter

had been designed, by. A. Mann Jr. It
was three feet long and two feet wide, in
the shape of an envelope, and made of
various flowers. The stamp was there,
with the inscription Imbedded in the cor
ner, "From the Employes of the San

"Our Postmaster," worked beautifully
with violets. Around the border were

them. They were followed by the Post
office clerks, city officials and others. .'yyy-
The services consisted of a solemn re
quiem high mass, Rev. J. B. Hanigan
officiating. The master of ceremonies
was the Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast. The

From the Oasttte, Cedar Falls. lowa.
The la grippe, that dread disease that had

ously in robust health, with shattered consti
tutions and seemingly confirmed invalids.
Professor A. H.Nye, living at 2500 Olive

I* a native of , Now York State, having come

schoolteacher by proiession. having served,
as County Superintendent of Schools of this
(Black Hawk) County several terms, and he
has the j respect of all with whom he comes in

the sympathy of the entire community. He
tried the best medical skill procurable, and
spent most of his ready means in the vain
endeavor to ; recover his . health, -and : had'
about' given up completely' discouraged. .He
had stopped taking; medicine, 'Â«. being ' fully
convluced' In his. own mind that there was
no help for him and that tie would iisvto
spend the balance of his days as -in invalid,*
a burden to *-. t emily â ' and friends. Some
one who had; heard :of Dr.** Williams' .'Pink j

him to give them a trial. His poor success ;
with eminent physicians made him skeptical
and he had no faith. in what was called:. pro
prietary medicine and would not listen to this
advice for some days.i The friend j being per
sistant, however, and having faith in the
Pink Pills, would not let up until he had
finally prevailed upon the sufferer to fend
for a box, which he reluctantly did, and after
receiving them. decided, to give them a fair
trial. The first box relieved him in a sur
prising, manner; .vet .he. was not convinced
that it was the medicine that had helped him,
but the weather, which had turned pleasant,
and did not send for a further, supply until he
was again about as baa as before taking the

another trial, and. took three boxes, and to

" Every spring and summer," said he, "I have j â 
been greatly troubled with dyspepsia and constipa-

manent relief. A few weeks ago I came in pos-
session of some of these Tabules and, somewhat
incredulously, began their use. The results have .

THE GOLD SUPPLY.
According to Ottomar Haupt, the eminent Eu
ropean authority, the supply of gold in thÂ« prin
cipal banks and treasuries of the world at the end
of each year since 1890 ha: been as follows:
1890 #1,510,600.000
1891 1,699,000,000
3592 l,7**-*-t,ouO,o'Jo

1891 100,000
1895 .2,132.600,000
1*96 2,226,400 OOJ
1897 2,420, 8J0.000
The total for this year Is the estimate for April
30. The steady Increase in the supply is signifi
cant, hut appears to be confirmed by the reported
augmented production of late years. With th*
except 1 of the United States. Busda has at
pres-ni a much larger hoard of gold than any
other country in the world, the Russian Fa k,
treasury and mint holding in January, 1897,
$627,600,010 of the yellow metal.
THIS WEEK'S FAILURE*.
â¢il-p Bradstreet Mercantile Agency reports 22
failures in the Pacific Coast States and Territories
for the past week, as compared with 24 for the
previous week and 29 for the corresponding week
of 1896. The failures for the past week are
divided among the trades as follows: 1 cigar
manufacturer, 1 express, 1 barber and cigars, 1
varieties, 1 manufacturer refrigerators, 4 grocers
1 undertaker, 1 bakery. 1 hotel, 1 contractor. 4
saloons. 1 sawmill, 1 drug company, 1 butcher. 1
millinery, 1 general store.
Explanation.
Tbe arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it, if any, the amount "of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect coins of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word --hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alonz the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low- is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a -high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
neither may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

morning. Many, bought yesterday, , expecting a
rally to-day. Foreign and Eastern markets opened
steady, but almost immediately began sinking,
showing not the least encouragement. As a re

this morning on a very weak market.
December opened at $122%, declined to $1 22
and closed at $1 22%.
Barley â Nothing doing in December. There
seems to be a few shorts in May who hive been
tied up while in a trance. When they tried to
cover there was little or none for sale. .Possibly a
few aborts ye out may squeeze themselves should
they endeavor to get in to-day or to-morrow.

It seems that while on circuit Justice
Kennedy has a. chop, and a glass of
seltzer for lunch. . Justice Charles used to
take a lew cods of beef tea and a couple
of biscuits. Justice Hawkins in the half
hour adjournment takes nothing. Baron
Pollock contents himself with a largo enp
of chocolate and a biscuit. \ Justice Gave
indulges In a mutton chop and a glass of
water. Justice Wills affects a similar
luncheon..*. Justice Bruce always ha* a
cup of. tea about 3. while. Justices Wil
liams and Matbew rejoice in a cud of beef
preparation.'- y iy* ; :
Caesar's Famous Saying.
It was on his way to the battlefield of
Fharsalia that Caesar uttered the famous
saying to the fishermen. He had come
down to Brindisi to cross the Dyrrachium,
and,, finding no galley, commanded the
owner of a small sailing-boat to put him
across the Adriatic. '-â - On the voyage a
violent storm occurred, and' even the ex
perienced mariners wore terrified, but the
great captain said: "Have no fear! You
carry Csesarand bis fortunes! 'âNew York

A Little Telegram Frcm the Bride

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 28. .
Leopold Palmtag and Thomas "Welch,
two of the oldest residents of Hay wards,
who have been friends for a quarter of a
century, met this morning and Palmtag
refused the other's hand. It was all
caused by a little elopement that took place
yesterday, in which Lena Palmtag, a
young miss just out of the High School,
and Martin Welch were the prominent
figures.
For a long time young Welch has been
clandestinely paying attention to Miss
Palming and his affections were greatly
developed by the marriage of Miss Flora
Palmtag a short time ago. Miss Flora
wedded Vincent Strobsl, who is of one of
Hay wards' best families, and the marriage
made her younger sister somewhat jeal
ous. She received tbe attentions of young
Welch, and although Talmtag senior did
not make his home a welcome meeting
place the young couple pursued their
courtship in other quarters.
A few days ago Welch sold his biryde
for $42, so that he would not be without
funds when the courtship should become
so torrid that it must naturally end in an
elopement. The time came sooner than
was expected and yesterday morning Mar
ti i Welch and Lena Palmtag came to
Oakland and procured a wedding I. cense.
The groom is '22 and the bride a little over
18. After obtaining the license they went
to Rev. Mr. McAvoy at San Leandro and
were married.
Mr. and Mrs. Welch then started for
San Francisco, where they are enjoying a
brief honeymoon with the groom's
brother and preparing themselves for the
ordeal, which they fondly hope will end
wiih 'God bless you, my children."
The Palmtags are among the wealthiest
of Haywards' families, and the father is
the bead of a large brewery at that place.
He was not at all inclined to ba agreeable
to the attentions of young Welch to his
daughter, who was being educated in such
a manner that she would taKe t c place in
society her father fondly hoped she would
some day rill. But though he did all in
his power to prevent a marriage, he has
been outwitted. J'JJ'.y-
Martin Welch is a well-known cyclist,
and is a lineman sometimes employed by
ihe telephone company. The Palmtazs
are the leaders of the exclusive Entre Nous
Club of Haywards, and Mr. Welch has
not succeeded in getting an entree in to
that club, and that is the cause of the dis
favor with which the wedding was re
garded by the bride's family.
Palmtag 6r. and Welch Sr. have passed
the time of day fora generation as friends,
but it is very apparent that they cannot
shake hands as fathers-in-law to each
other's child.
, Yesterday Miss Lena left home to do
some shopping in Oakland. She did not
return, and last night Charles Heyer, a
friend of the Palm tags, received a tele
gram that read: "I was married at
noon. â Lena."
CHASED BY TWO ROBBERS
A. Hackman's Fright on the
Lonely A ameda Marsh
Read.
Twj Young S.ciety Men Were About
to Be Arrested in the Early .
Morn.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
.903 Broadway, May 28. I
Ray and Harry Baker, two of the bast
known young men in Oakland society,
were very nearly arrested yesterday morn
ing at an early hour on suspicion of being
the opera bouffe highwaymen that have
been amusing themselves lately taking
pistols from officers.
The two young gentlemen caused a
hackman to have a very severe iright, as
the result of which he drove to the police
station and told his experience to Chief
Lloyd. The Chief at once telephoned to
Chief Rogers of Alameda, and a few min
utes later the arrest of the Bakers was
avoided through the explanation fur
nished by Albert Saxton, night receiver
at the Alameda power-house. ,*.'
T' c Bikers had been attending a party
in Alameda and had left too late to catch
the last car to Oakland. They walked as
far as the power-house, and not wishing to
cross the lonely marsh road in tbe early
morning, they offered to pay for a special
car to take them to Oakland. Receiver
Saxton declined to furnish them a car, and
they started to walk. They had not gone
far when. they met a back. In the hope
that it was disengaged, they ran as fast as
they could toward it. This occurred in
the section of the road on the south side
of the marsh known as the "cut-off."
One of the Bakers is taller than the
other, and when the hackman saw the tall
and the short man, that have figured so
much in recent years in midnight un
pleasantnesses, he at once concluded thai
he was to be the next victim. He whipped
tip his horses and drove across the marsh
at a lively gait, nor did he stop until he
arrived at the Oakland city prison.
He told his story of how an attempt had
been made to 'hold him up by two high
waymen, and the information was tele
phoned to the Alameda police station.
Officer Baker was at once dispatched to
the marsh road to . capture the desper
adoes. made inquiry at the power
house, and Receiver Saxton at once told
him who the highwaymen were and why
they should be chasing a hack in the early
morning. The explanation was found to
b- true, and when the Bakers arrived on
the Oakland side of the marsh they were
not arrested.

CENTENARY OF
MISSION SAN JOSE
Rev. Thomas McNaboe Ar
ranges an Interesting
Programme.
An Old-Time Earb'cue Will Be
One of the M st Charac
teristic Features.
Archbishop Riordan Wil Caleb ate
Pcntifi.ial Mass in the Open
' Air.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,).
908 Broadway, May 28. J
The programme of events for the cen
tennial celebration of Mission San Jose is
almost completed. Rev. Thomas Mc-
Naboe, who is in charge of the present
parish, is now making the final arrange
ments for a fitting observance of the his
toric event.
One of the features of the day will be a
procession, in which many organizations
REV. THOMAS McNAEOE, Paster of Mission San Jose.
will join. -All the Catholic orders will be
represented and several secular institu
tion-*. It is probable that all the lodges
in Washington and Murray townships
will take part.
An attempt is being made to' hold a big
barbecue as one of the festive events. It
being impossible to think of Mission
San Jose without its Spanish history ot a
century ago. it is thought most fitting
that a Spanish fiesta shall form part of
the ceremony.
The religious ceremony will be presided
over by the Archbishop and a great many
clergy who will be present. There wiii te
a pontifical mass, whicb will be celebrated
in the open air, probably in front of the
only portion of the original mission
which still stands. ; * v
The mission rtf San Jose is the only
building in the little town that remains of
historic value. Unlike many other mis
sions there are no other buildings sur
rounding it of any interest. These auxil
iary institutions were never very imposing,
and such as they were they perished al
most entirely in the severe earthquake of
1868, which shook down the church and
left but a small portion of the entire quad
rilateral, a low adobe structure which was
the wine cellar of the early padres.
. At the present time a huge grapevine
covers the front of this interesting t.ur
vivor. In the- rear are a few of the old
trees whicn stood in the mission garden,.
t-ome of tbem olives, which are said to be
over eighty years old. -yy-y y
"We expect to have a very large at
tendance at our centennial celebration,"
said Father McNaboe to-day. "The Mis
sion San Jose is the cradle of civilization
in Alameda County. Its founders were
the first Christians to bring civilization to
the Indians and from that date began the
development in this district. Atone time
the mission was the center of a most flour
ishing Indian settlement. After a while
the Spaniards succeeded the Indians and
another period of progress was enjoyed.
Since the secularizajion of the mission,
however, the work of the mission has been
steadily carried on, though under differ
ent conditions. . - â¢'..

In the Intercollegiate Rifle-Shoot
Berkeley Has Been Victor

BERKELEY. Cal., May 28.-There
seems to be little doubt that the Univer
sity of California rifle team will defeat at
least a majority of the teams represent
ing the eighteen Eastern umver-ities in
the annual intercollegiate rife-shoot.
Reports came to-day from the Tennessee
and Michigan team- , the former scoring
328 and the latter 'MA, as aeainst Berke
ley's 400. Reports have hitherto been re
ceived from Illinois. lowa and Virginia
State universities, all of which fell below
the score of the U. C.
Out of the eighteen colleges in the
league, Berkeley has defeated the five so
far heard from. Advices irom the other*
are expected daily.

AMES DENIES LVEBYTHING.
Files an Answer to the Suit Brought
by His Si iter.
OAKLAND. Cal., May 28.â Josiah P.
Ames - ha-* filed an answer to the suit
brought by his sister, Mrs. Ann Harris.' in
which he denies all the allegations of the
complaint.
The answer Sits forth that owing .to
press of business the annual settlement of j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, 1 SATURDAY, MAY 29, 1897.
1894 was deferred, but everything that has
been done is straightforward and above
board. He claims bis sister gave him the
property by deed of gift, subject only to
the payment of $3010 annually during her
life.
The answer contains copies of letters
from Mrs. Harris to Amei which were
given after the action to recover the prop
erty had been commenced, in which she
says she is tatisfied her brother has been
done a wrong and also giving instructions
to her attorneys to dismiss the suit. On
the Ist of February, 1897. the attorneys
for Mrs. Harris acted according to her
instructions and,, it is claimed, -the suit
was dismissed, and so Ames declares this
action was final. Some depositions, how
ever, have been recently taken and the
matter is still pending.
ANOTHER TIEE SCANDAL.
Assistant Chief and a Hoseman Ex-
change Blows.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 28.â Assistant
Chief Murdock of the Fire Department and
Jack Rohan of one of the hose companies
had a fight this afternoon near the City
Hall.
Some days ago it was reported to Mur
dock that Rohan was seeking to have the
assistant chief deposed because of an af
fidavit said to have been made by Harry
Lawson, now in San Quentin. The affida
vit stated that Murdock had made proposi
tions to Lawson to burn down certain
buildings for various purposes. This aft
ernoon Murdock and Rohan met. Mur
dock asked Rohan for the affidavit and
petition and the latter replied that he had
it not. Murdock called Rohan a liar and
at the same time emphasized his words
with his fist. There was a short round
and the men both made their way to the
police station, Rohan declaring. -be will
have Murdock arrested for assault.
On account of the unsettled condition
of the Fire Department, consequent on
the failure of Cmef Fair to re-elected,
scandals such as this are coming to the
surface every few days, and an official
said to-day that there 'is no likelihood of
discipline being restored until the matter
of appointing a new chief is settled. .
BURGLAR CAUGHT.
Intuition of an Officer Gave the Thief
Into the Hands of the
Law.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 28.â A man giv
ing the Dame of Wheeler was arrested on
Twenty-third avenue near the tidal canal
bridge late yesterday afternoon and on his
person were found some stolen, goods,
which he owned up to have taken irom
the residence of Mrs. Dora Colby, 1118 La
fayette street. Mrs. Colby had taken oc
casion to leave her residence yesterday,
and on going away cautioned her son to
fasten all the doors, as she had seen a sus
picious character loitering around. This
the boy neglected to do, and as a result a
thief, who turned out to be Weeeler, en
tered the cellar and ransacked a trunk
that was stored there, stealing some jew
elry and other articles. He made them up
in a bundle and left town by way of the
tidal canal bridge.
While passing along Twenty-third ave
nue he met Constable Quinlan. The
officer intuitively thought mat the fellow
was a thief and started to overhaul him.i
Wheeler tooK to his heels, but was soon
caught and his bundle found to contain
stolen goods. He acknowledged that he
had robbed Mrs. Colby's house.

OAKLAND, Cal.,. May 28..-â Deputy
Constable Cronin, who was shot last night

COUNTERFEITERS
AGAIN AT WORK
Numerous Nearly Perfect
Five-Dollar Pieces
'â¢â --..- -
Passed.
The Crooks Reaped a Harvest
at the Recent Butchers'
Picnic
- : . ~~ â ~ '
Secret Service Agent Harris Is Wor
ried Over the Mater and Is
Watching.
A dangerous gang of counterfeiters, sup
posed to be the same one that operated
extensively at the racetrack-; some time
ago, has been carrying on its nefarious
business on a large scale -vilhin the past
few days, and Secret Service Agent Nick
Harris is very much worried over its dep
redations.
It was supposed that when the racing
season closed the "sho vers of the queer"
would depart, but they have found just as
promising a field in the picnics, where
change is made rapidly over the bars,
and it is at the resorts of the Sunday
revelers that the counterfeiters are now
working.
Tbe counterfeiters chose the butchers'
picnic at Shell Mound on Wednesday to
ply their trade, and the number of coun
terfeit $5 pieces that have come to light
since that event has almost driven Agent
Harris to distraction.
Captain Siebe, the manager of the park,
came to the City yesterday and called on
Harris with eight golden half eagles that
had been passed on his barkeepers, and it
is known that a large number were taken
in by those conducting other privileges as
well as at the gate.
The coins are remarkably perfect in
looks, none but an expert being able to
detect any delects in . the workmanship or
weight. The ring is poor, however, and a
few rasps of a file or an application of
strong fingers soon shows that they are
nothing but lead.
The gold plating is very heavy, how
ever, giving them the right feel as the
lead gives them weight.
Those who passed them on the bars and
lunch counters were evidently experts in
the business, for in no case were they even
suspected, and in most instances the
fraud was not discovered until the coins
were presented to banks for deposit or to
merchants whose cashiers were experts in
detecting fraudulent coin.
One bank even took a number of the
counterfeits, and one of the coins found
its way into the pocket of a member of the
banking firm. When that individual tried
to pass it on a well-known refreshment
caterer it was handed back with the re
mark that it was bo.-v". The banker in
sisted that it must be good, because it had
been taken in over his counter, and a
number of business men who examined
the coin declared they wished they had a
"barrel like it."
The mixologist is possessed of strong
fingers, however, and after he had bent
the bit of gold-covered lead out of shape
all were convinced that a most dangerous
counterfeit had been unearthed.
' Harris has determined to run the gang
to earth or drive it out of town at the
I est and will keep an eye oat at future
picnics. It is reported that the counter
feiters will try to work their wares off at
the Caledonia picnic to-day and to prevent
this and arrest tbe men if possib c, Mr.
Harris will attend the picnic with a squad
of exp -rienced assistants and keep a sharp
lookout all day.
The agent is under the impression that
the crooks are Eastern men who are un
known to the local authorities and are
therefore able to ply their shady trade
with much greater ease than would other
wise be the case, yy

CHANGED HIS PLANS.
Philip Anspnch er and George W. Wer
- ncr Dispute Over Accounts.
' ; George . W. Werner complains that
Philip Anspacher is a hard man to suit.
He says that he engaged to do some ce
ment work for Mr. Anspacher in the con
struction of a building near* the intersec
tion of Fillmore street and Broadway,* the
original contract calling for $1922 55; that
during the progress of the work Mr. Ans
pacher ordered the garden walks changed
and re-changed a great many times, and
also dictated a number of alterations in
other respects that ought to be paid for as
extra work.
The gentlemen not being able to agree
on a settlement of their differences, Mr.
Werner has instituted suit against "Mr.
Ans acher for the recovery of the amcunt
-involved." '.",..,

EACH MAN A SOVEREIGN.
Meeting of the Social Science
Club at Cambrian
Hall.
A Noyel Organizitioa Which Has
No President and No
0 fic^rs.
"Individual Sovereigns" i? the digni
fied title by which the members of the
Social Science Club refer to one another.
No interest, no taxes, no rent and inci
dentally no government is the platform
on which tie workings of this little band
is conducted. . *.-*â -
The Social Science Club was organized
some three months ago, the members
hold-ng their meetings weekly at Uni
versal Hall, a' the corner of Stockton and
Pacific streets. Wednesday evening the
headquarters of the club was removed to
Cambrian Hall, where the meetings will
be held in the future.
The platform of the club recognizes no
government and naturally has neither
president nor officers. The speaker was
chosen by general acclamation and all are
invited to join in the discussion.
S. Danieiewicz called the meeting to
order Wednesday evening, explaining
briefly and concisely the objects of the
club and the results they expect to accom
plish, yyyyy yyy.
First and foremost is the obolition of in
terest, wherein, according to the speaker,
lies the root of all evils. Then there is
tbe question of land possession, which,
the speaker stated, is as erroneous as
would be the claiming of the sun's light
in the deep waters of the sea.
"We mu>t have individual sovereignty,"
said Danielewicz. "If we had individual
law instead of National law land would be
the use ol him who needs it.
"If we had no Government to protect
money interests, the people would estab
lish a medium of exchange ot, their own,
wli eh would be Don-interest bearing."
- In conclusion, the gentleman declared
that tie Government is fostering and pro
tecting the monopolies, which are the root
of all existing evils. y*-- ;
W. C. SheparJ followed Danislewicz, ad
vocating a free monetary system as an an
tidote to the unfortunate state of existing
things. * .;..._...' . -yy-y,-;

When Convicted of Arson She Became
Hysterical and Violent. y'J'Jr-
Mrs. Katie Malcomson has been con
victed of arson of the second degree and
recommended to the mercy of the court.
The charge against Mr-. Malcomson was
that she set fire to her lodging-house at
131 Taylor street for the purpose of secur
ing the insurance money.
When the verdict of conviction was an
nounced the prisoner fainted and it was

NAILS A
FAKER TO
THE WALL
i Tr
"Examiner" Yarn About
the Watsonville Plant
Exposed.
CL AUS SPRECKELS MAKES
ANSWER.
Names Were Given of Indi
viduals Who Had No Stock
in the Company.
ERRORS "WERE THICK AS
BEES.
No Straggle to Get Possession of Dr.
Buckley's Shares, as None S ood
in His Name.
The faking newspaper of San Francisco
has been exposed again. This lime the
exposure is so complete and convincing
that the faker has no honorable course
open but retraction and apology.
Claus Spreckeis takes up a yarn printed
in the Examiner of May .23 and estab
lishes the fact beyond the shadow of a
doubt that the story, heralded under con
spicuous display lines, concerning the
shareholders and the stock of the Watson
ville sugar nlant is false from ton to
bottom. Here is the way in which Mr.
Spreckeis disposes of the Examiner's ex
clusive canard :
To the Editor of The Call: In the Examiner
of May 23, 1897, there is an article with such
headings as these: "Held Up by the Trust,"
"Outside Stockholders in the Watsonville
Plant Forced to el)," "Clans Spreckeis Gave
the Stockholders No Option," "Grip of the
Beet-Sugar Plants." This, article goes on to
say that the Watsonville Beet-Sugar Company
was largely owned by San Francisco business
men and that "more than half of the stock
was owned by Mr. Spreckeis"; that in order to
turn over control of this beet-sugar factory
to the sugar trust "Mr. Spreckeis forced the
outside stockholders to sell.; that "not one
was anxious to surrender the stock, which
paid handsomely, but that no one dared to
disobey the request to sell it"
1 wish to say that this article is utterly
false â in assertion, false in insinuation
and false in innuendo. There is nothing in
it that is true except the asseition that the
Watsonville Beet-Sugar Company had a capi
tal stock and had paid dividends of $117 per
share on same. Any one of the gentlemen
therein named as holding stock will, if asked,
say that the article is untrue. Even the table
of shareholders is not correct. This is a cor
rect list of what were called the "outside
shareholders" :
M. Ehrman, 80 shares; Joseph Ehrman, 40
shares; Fredericka Ehrraan, 50 shares; Louis
Sloss, 100 shares; John L. Koster, 100 shares;
A L. Tubbs, 100 shares; Samuel Sussman, 80
shares; K. H. Hummer, 50 shares; E. J.
Molera, 100 shares; W. c. Waters, 250 shares;
John D. Spreckeis, 250 shares; A. B. Spreckeis,
200 shares.
In the printed list in the Examiner there
were, among the various other errors, the
names of people who had no stock at all. The
Examiner put down Dr. Buckley as possessing
fifty shares and said: "The last fifty out
standing were not obtained without a strug
gle, and it is said that Dr. Buckley was paid a
higher price than his fellows. In every case
they have received all their money back and
$317 a share to boot." ; ' â¢'. i
This is also false. There were no fiity shares
standing in the name of Dr. Buckley. There
were no shares in the name of Dr. Buckley at
all. Therefore there could not have been a
"struggle over the shares standing in the
name of Dr. Buckley," and therefore Dr. Buck
ley "could not have been paid a higher price
than his fellows." As 'o the "original stock
holders receiving $317 a share," that also is
lalse. Each stockholder received $300 a share.
The statement that any one of them received
$317 a share is also false. So is the statement
that they were "held up" by Mr. Spreckeis or
"forced to sell" by him.. The stockholders
sold their shares voluntarily. .JjAyJJ.JJJ'j,
I do not see that there is much left to reply
to in this article. From the heading to the
last line, from top to bottom, from the middle
up and down and across, it is false. But if
'.here be any one who is inclined to believe
such a circumstantial and detailed falsehood;
ii anybody believes I "held up" these gentle
men or "forced them to sell," or if anyone
believes that I sought an unjust advantage
over them by paying them $300 a share for
slock which cost $100, I can only say that I
will sell my shares to them any day for $10
Jess than I paid them ior it. They received
$300. 1 will turn over to any one of these
stockholders the amount of stock he sold me
at $290 a share. Thus they can make money
by buying stock back again.

TWEHTY-FIVE STUDENTS IN A

They Refuse to Confess and Are

School. *
There has been a miniature riot brew
ing for some days or nights past among
the pupils of Miss Kate McQuade's class
The Burns Cottage Which Has Been Er:ctel in the Picnic Grounds.
in the Washington Grammar Night
School. Tha teacher hopes to avert the
impending trouble by refusing admittance
to the classroom of nearly the whole
class. Last night, after spending a most
exciting evening with them, she told no
less than twenty-five of them to take their
books and go home, and forbidding them,
at the same time, to return.
The class last evening numbered thirty
three pupils, and of these only eight were
exonerated from biame and given permis
sion to continue attendance at the school.
The Washington Grammar .School is
located on Washington street, at the cor
ner of Mason. Miss McQuade's class is
compos ed of boys about 13 years old, and
rather lively boys they are.
They have bsen given to playing prac
tical jokes upon each other, and tjie
teacher herself has not wholly escaped. A
few nights ago a powder was exploded in
the classroom that caused such an ill
smell and coughing of the pupils and
teacher tbat it almost compelled a dis
missal of the class.
On the next succeeding evening, when
the class was called up to recite, almost
every lad in the room, aa he moved out
from his desk into the aisle, stepped upon
an explosive match, and the result visa.
like an engagement of infantry or a Chi
nese holiday. The teacher was given a
nervous shock, not knowing for an in
stant the cause of the explosions.
She postponed the hearing of the les
sons and * undertook to discover who had
done the mischief by a system of thorough
questioning. No one knew where the
matches had come from, so far as she
could learn from the boys. As the pupils
moved about, going forward to be' ques
tioned or returnin â¢ or moving about in
their seats, a desultory fire was kept
up as they trod upon a stray match,
and this added great y to the amusement
of the purils and the irritation of the
teacher. One boy said be had been struck
on the head with a package of matches
that were apparently thrown in from- the
road. . This was accepted as an explana
tion, and the matter was dropped at that
time. -ACyyA -, ;
Last night the class was being in
structed in geography by means ol pic
tures thrown upon a screen through a
magic lantern. Suddenly tbe explosions
began, as upon the previous night, from
all over the room.
Miss McQuade began another vigorous
inquiry at once which s.e kept up uatil
she had convinced herself that a great
majority of her pupils were in a conspir
acy to turn the class from its purpose of
acquiring an education into that of sim
ply making merry. She found that the
matches had been prepared by cutting off
all the wool and leaving nothing but the
explosive end, so that they might be dis
tributed over the floor without being dis
covered until trodden upon.
' She became assured that they were not
thrown into the room by an outsider. She
thereupon dismissed all those whom she
had reason to believe were in the con
spiracy, with a result of leaving only
eight pupils in good standing. Most of
the pupils di-claim all knowledge of the
affair and the matter will probably be
taken before the Board of Education.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 29; 1897.
BALDWIN 'MEETS
HIS NEMESIS
Miss Emma Ashley Visits
the Man She Tried
to Shoot.*
She Urges Him to Buy a Block
of Tickets to Her Sister's
Benefit.
The Interview Caused Some Excite
ment in the Rotunda of the
Baldwin Hotel.
Miss Emma Ashley surprised "Lucky"
Baldwin and about twenty guests of
the Baldwin Hotel yesterday morning by
rushing into ihe rotunda from the Powell
street entrance and pouncing upon the
millionaire with a demand that lie buy
$30 or $40 worth of tickets to the perform
ance at tbe Auditorium to-nieht, an enter
tainment for the benefit of her sister,
Lillian Ashley.
The capitalist was sitting quietly and
reading a newspaper at the moment of
the young woman's appearance, and he
was greatly surprised when he looked up
to see his nemesis holding out a bundle of
tickets, saying: "It's a shame for me to
be hustling around and selling tickets for
the support of your daughter, Anita Bald
win, while you are enjoying life and living
on the interest of your millions."
"Go away and do not bother me," said
Baldwin, "for I want no conversation
with you and do not want to buy any
tickets."
Mis; Emma held her niece in her lap
last night and told the story of her en
counter with the man she is pursuit. c.
"I saw him yesterday morning," she
said, "and I rushed into the hotel to have
an interview, for I had been trying to see
him every day for a week. I was going
up street with Mrs. Carrie Clarke Ward,
on a Powell-street car, so* I got off and
hurried into the hotel. Baldwin was
much excited when I appeared and he
moved bis hands like an old woman,
nervously urging me to go. This was
great amusement for the office-boys
and those assembled, for they had
been accustomed to seeing me make fre
quent trips through the hotel in search
ior my niece's father, and they were pre
pare*) for tbe fun, but the old man would
not put up a cent for tickets and would
not give any encouragement, so I said,
'We'll have to meet again some day.
Good-by until I meet you alone some day
when we ran have a quiet i conversation,'
and with that I left." . :
Miss Ashley says she has been ap
proached by a man who asked bow much
she would take to cancel her engagement
at the Auditorium, and she replied that it
would be worth about 11000. She thinks
she will have a good audience. JA'-Jj
The programme for the living picture
exhibition is unique, each picture being
furnished with a legend. lln the first an
actor is dressed to personate "Lucky"
Baldwin, kneeling' before Miss Ashley.
He is made to say: "I love you, Lillian!
Oh,' how I love you!" ' In the second pic
ture Baldwin is refusing the appeals of the
mother and babe for aid, and saying, "No,
not a cent!" " ... . .*â ! . -Â. '. , -
The story throughout is told largely in
an allegorical style after the manner of
the old mystery and miracle plays. Miss
Ashley says tbe sale of tickets 'has been
very encouraging fcr to-night's perform
ance. ' " â â  ( y-jy-

John Foster, foreman of Engine Com
pany No. 6, was arrested Thursday morn
ing by special officers of the Southern
Pacific Company, charged with tampering
with the airbrakes of a freight train.
Foster, besides being a fireman, finds
time to perform the duties of lamp
lighter. While making his rounds Thurs
day morning to extinguish the lamps at
the foot of Seventh street, on Townsend,
he saw what he supposed was a man
lying under a train standing there. He
stopped and looked under the car. As he
came from the train, proceeding on his
way. he was arrested and, although he
explained his business, was locked up.
This is his statement of the circum.-tances.
He was taken before Judge Campbell
on Thursday. Neither of the persons who
arrested him appeared, and the case was
carried over until this morning.
Foster has , borne an excellent reputa
tion heretofore. :He has taken; no action
toward securing counsel. The counsel for
the railroad suggested that a mistake
might have been made. Foster is a mar
lied man and lives with j his family on
Sixth street, opposite the engine-house. â¢

The Spirit of Hospitality Still Lives
in the Scottish Bosom and Will

The fame of the Caledonian Club's hos
pitality is world wide. Many famous men
of many nations have at one time or an
other accepted it, Â»nd at the annual gath
ering and games to be held at Shell
Mound Park this afternoon it will be dis
pensed in the ; good old-fashioned \ way,
but with the nccompaniment of a number
of modern frills. The proceeds of the
games are to be turned over to the Burns
monument fund, and the day's proceed-,
ings will have a decided Burns flavor. The
chief and chieftains of the club will re
ceive their friends and visitors in a cot
tage built in imitation of the home of the
great Scotch poet in Ayrshire. In for
mer years it has been the custom to re
ceive in the "tent," and pleasant recol
lections of the good times had there linger
with all who have been fortunate enough
to have enjoyed them.
In the olden times a Scotchman's house
beloneed to his guest. The stranger was
monarch of all he surveyed and nothing
was too good for him. Even the life of
his host' was at his command if it was
necessary that it should be sacrificed in
defense of the visitor. Toe spirit of those
days still lives in the Scottish bosom and
finds vent in the entertainment during
trfese prosaic modern times at the an
nual gatherings of the clans in the recep
tions in the "tent." Try yj.; â¢;
In the Burns cottage will be exhibited a
number of relics of the poet his snuff
box, a wooden loving-cuD, a cud and sau
cer which belonged to his wife, a teapot
used in his h. me, a chair and a number of
other articles connected with which are
circumstances in the life of the bard. It
has ben suggested that a man made up
to impersonate "Bobby" Burns be chosen
to receive the visitors.
The games have aroused even more in
terest among competitors this year than
before. There will be more participants,
and it will not be surprising i: a number
of records nre shattered. Carrol, the giant
heavyweight thrower, who holds several
world's records for throwing the hammer
and putting the shot, will endeavor to
establish a new mark. All ot the runners
and jumpers belonging to tbe club are also
going to try for some or the $3000 hung up
in prizes by the committee.
An attractive feature of the competition
will be the dancing: and bagpipe-playing

DURRANT AWAITS
BUDD'S DECISION
Executive Action Promised
by the Governor
To- Day.
The Attorneys Formu'ate a New
Plan to Delay the Exe
cution.
All Sorts ; and Conditions of Crank
Letter-Writing Fiends Are'
Develrp ng.
Durrant and his attorneys expect much
from this day. ; After two weeks' atten
tion to the case Governor Bndd is to ren
der bis decision on the application for a
respite or commutation of the death sen
tence of tne condemned man to life im
prisonment. The last is only viewed as a
va^ue possibility, even by the most
ardent advocates of Durrani's cause./
The Governor sent word to the City last
night that be would make public his deci
sion this morning. Those who are best
acquainted with him and his methods say
he will not inter ere with the death sen
tence at all. The closing appeal of the
condemned man's attorneys for a respite,
in order that the Minnie Williams case
may be tried, if indicative of anything,
tends to show the desperation of their
cause.
â¢Durrant himself is hopeful. He was
disappointed to learn last night that the
Governor had not yet acted. He will re
ceive the newsâ either good or bad
through his mother, who intends ' visiting
him at San Quentin to-day.
The attorneys for tbe condemned are
prepared for any emergency with which
unfavorable action on the part of the Gov
ernor may confront them. If a respite is
refused it will not necessarily follow that
Durrant will be hanged on June 11. Bom
Eugene F. Deuprey and General Dickin
son have already formulated a plan of ap
peal to the United States courts for the
purpose of delaying the execution of the
death sentence.
/ First, it is possible to apply to the
United States District Court for a writ of
habeas corpus on the ground that Dur
rant is imprisoned in violation of the con
stitution. Such a proceeding ., will, of
course, be purely formal, but on account
of the peculiar wording of section 763 of
the Federal statutes it paves the way for
subsequent procedure that may tend ,to
postpone Durrant's death some months.
The section in question provides that an
appeal of a case may be taken* from the
final decision of any court "inferior to the
Circuit Court" of the United States.
The word "inferior" in this instance
is: the key by which Durrant's
-â¢dvisers hope to -do business.
Were an appeal taken direct to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, as the law
permits, a refusal would bar furtner hope
of delaying the death sentence. So the
programme is to apply for the writ of
habeas corpus first to the District Court.
A refusal of the application would enable
the attorneys to then appeal from this
decision to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
â¢The matter then at issue would not be the
guilt or innocence of Durrant at all, but
the refusal of the inferior court to grant
a writ of habeas corpus.
Then, of course, th re is still an appeal
to the United States Supreme Court for a
writ of error, or something .of this sort.
The lower Federal courts might, of course,
be first attacked in this way. Oi course,
all these various phases of appealing the
case will take time, and that is what Deu
prey and Dickinson are striving for these
days. Should they be successful in oten-
Ing the "appeal" door or the Federal
courts Durrant's * life is safe for many
months. Tb6 Supreme Court of the
United States or the Circuit Court of Ap
peals will not convene until October, and
the very fact that the case in any phase is
pending before these tribunals would in
itself forbid Warden Hale or the State au
thorities from proceeding with the execu
tion. - : '- J.jyJ'- '.-â 
Upon her return from her -visit, to Mrs.
Budd, the mother of the Governor, Mrs.
Durrant j began , to search for William
Meakin, a hotel clerk. Mrs. Budd had re
called to Mr?. Durrant a story sbe had
heard : some weeks ago in ' a roundabout
way that a friend of Mrs. Dr. Freeman of 122
Turk street had been told that a "Stock
ton hotel clerk,'', very j much resembling
her son, had 'ridden^ on the Powell-street
car with Blanche Lamont from the Nor
mal School. V lt :. transpires that Meakin
was in Stockton at the time of .the X mur
ders, an employe of I the Mansion ' House.
This resemblance to Durrant caused him
some annoyance among his associates at
the ; time, and , led bim .to shave off his
mustache "and side whiskers. Meakin is
now residing at Eighth and Minna streets
and told Chief Leu that he never knew
either Minnie Williams or Blanche - La
mont. y -*...;'â¢ â -â¢'..-: * 'â ---.

A FEDERAL QUARANTINE.
Dr. Rcsenau Has Received Defi
nite Orders From Wast-
ton.
Co flic t of" Authority Between ; the
State and National Dcctors Ended
for a Time. . Â.
Dr. Rosenau, the Federal Quarantine
Officer, is now supreme, and captains of
incoming ships may in future take bis
say-so on all occasions. The State quar
antine officers have all along claimed , the
right of priority inspection, but now that
is done away with, as Dr. Rosenau re
ceived his commission from the President
yesterday. Jy7~J
This action definitely settles the exist,
ing deadlock between the State and Fed
eral -authorities. : The authority of the
Federal officer is now paramount and his
decision concerning any question of disin
fection or detention is final. Collector of
the Port John H. Wise has been so in
formed.
The action of the President is the result
of an investigation made by ex-Governor
Caleb V. West,. who was sent to San Fran
cisco from Washington to investigate the
conflict of authority, between the - two
quarantine officers. As a result of his re
port the authorities at. Washington have
decided that only the permission of the
Federal Quarantine Officer is necessary to
enter the Custom-house and that the local
authorities have not the right of priority
of inspection. â â â .â 77 >
: In view of the thoroughness of the Fed
eral quarantine and the fact that the offi
cials have letters from health officers
abroad and are promptly . informed of
chances in health "conditions in all parts
of the world it would seem that the main
taining of a State quarantine was a need
less expense. '.- . :_ ..â â ...â /,', ;â¢ " y
There has been many a clash between
the two quarantine officers, and time and
again steamers have been detained await
ing either one or the I other. Passengers
from China, Japan, Australia and British
Columbia have growled frequently be
cause they were not allowed to leave the
ship. Then the growling would break out
again whenever they found they had to
submit to a second inspection. In 1 the
case of â  the â : Colon a - few days ago one
doctor passed her, while the other physi
cian ordered her into -quarantine. . All
this trouble, will now be done away with,
and ships can g hereafter be docked '- and
cargo discharged on Dr. Rosenau's order.
