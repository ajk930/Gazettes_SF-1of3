on Ways and Means, making the duties
in the bill applicable to all imports after
April 1.
Bailey (D.) of Texas made the point of
order that the amendment was not in or
der at this time. He briefly stated that
the amendment was on all fours with the
amendment offered by Mr. Dockery (D.)
of Missouri tp the tirat paragraph of the
bill. It was obnoxious also to the well
establisbed principle of law that there
should be no retroactive enactment.
McMillin (D.) of Tennessee made the
further point that the amendment sought
to regulate the practice of courts and
therefore was not germane to the bilL
Dalrell (R.) of Pennsylvania called
Bailey's attention to the fact that the
amendment was offered as a committee
amendment, to whu-h Bailey responded
that, if that be the case, of conrse his
point was not well taken; bot he insisted
that the gentleman from Pennsylvania
snouid stand in his place and distinctly
stale that the amendment had been
agreed upon by the Committee on Ways
and Means.
: - Dalzell declined to do that, but stated
that 'the amendment in substance bad
â  been agreed to by the Committee on
-Way*-- i.id Means "and referred to a sub-'
I committee to put into shape. Dalzell ad
| mitted that there had been no meeting of
j the committee, but he protested to Bailey
I that the only result of his objection would
I be to compel a meeting of the committee,
when the amendment ': would be ap
proved.
After further discussion of the point of
1 order Sherman said his ruling must de
| pend upon a question of factâ whether or
! not the Committee on Ways and Means
j authorized the sub-committee to offer the
J amendment in behalf of the committee.
Dingey (R.) of Maine said that to ob
j viate all doubt on the question the amend
j ment would be withdrawn and he gave
notice of a meeting of the Commit on
Ways and Means in three minutes.
Barrows (R.) of Massachusetts, recur
j ring to the amendment by which the duty
on -currants was increased from IJ^ to 2
cents, eloquently pleaded for a substantial
recognition of Greece, which was to-day,
he said, giving to the world a splendid
I exhibition of heroism, patriotism and
| courage.. Dintrley explained that tne duty
imposed by the bill upon Zante currants
was just half of that collected by Great
Britain. DeVries (Fusion) of California
advocated the amendment as affording
j protection to the fruit-growers of his
district. 'S.'ir, ')-
While the Committee on Ways and
Means were acting on the Grosvenor
amendment an irrelevant discussion on
the Homestead strike and the general pro
visions of the bill was engaged in by Jett
J (D.) of Illinois, Ray (R ) of New York
and Sulzer (D.) of New York. Grosvenor
then, by direction of the Committee on
Ways and Means, reinlroduced the amend
ment, making a new section.
Docitery (D.) of Missouri moved an
amendment to the section authorizing
the increase of duty on articles controlled
by trusts. Dngiey made the point of
order that it was not germane, relating to
the free list, while the Grosvenor amend
ment proposed to fix the day when the
duties fixed in the bill should take effect.
The chair sustained me point of order.
It was ruled that t c amendment pro
! posed by Grosvenor should be limited to
half an hour's ilebate. Grosvenor said
[ that the attention of the country should
| be directed to the action of the gentleman
i from Missouri (Dockery) and his asso
ciates in their iiautic efforts to do some
thing about trust*. The amendments
which they had been offering, Grosvenor
said, as a bluff, were copied by them from
the McKinley law. They were repro
| duced in tho Wilson bill, the authors tak
j ing the idea from Republican legislation,
! where the Democratic party had got every
pood idea of tte past half century. These
provisions, ho said, were the law of the
land to-day acd would not be disturbed

GUTHRIE, Oklahoma, Maich 31.â The
cyclone of last night dealt death and
destruction to everything in its path at
the town of Chandler, completely sweep
ing it off the face of the eurih. The storm
came from the southwestand swept across
the town, leaving scarcely a building of
any importance standing. Everything
was a mass of ruins in a Tew minutes, and
the air was filled with groans and cries of
tlie wounded and shrieks from every side.
The wrecks of many of the store buiid
inps took fire, and in a short time an
awful holocaust was in progress, many o.'
those injured and buried in the ruins
being burned to death. Fire broke out
first in the ruins of the New York store
and Lincoln County Banit, and spread to
many other buildings, making it neces
sary to tight the flames as well as rescue
the injured.
In addition to the people burned to
death a largo number of the injured were
badly burned and are suffering intensely.
Between the fire, the wind and the rain,
the provisions, medicine, clothing, etc., in
the stores were all destroyed or so badly
injured as to be worthies*, and unless new
â¢upplies arrive at once there will be much
snfferini:, even among those who have
money.
The storm broke upon tbe city suddenly.
The sky was clear an hour before. The
clouds .varied southeast and then whirled
north. Suddenly a funnel-shaped cloud
was developed, which touched the ground
and tore up trees like twigs, the roar be
ing deafening. A cloudburst preceded it.
The funnel split as it struck the southwest
part of town, which is on a hill overlook
ing the Cow Creek Valley, and one-half
went through the town ana the other half
turned north. Darkness soon came on,

HIS CAPTURE ATTRIBUTED TO
TREACHERY.
Nothing; bu Fear ot Exciting Ameri

NEW YORK, N. V., April 1.-A dis
patch to the Herald from Havana, via
Key West, says:
"Religions perish when they have no
longer followers who will die for them,"
said Ruiz Rivera on his stretcher at San
Cristobal. "I expect to be shot. Well, it
may help the cause. Other considerations
are not important. 1 '
Rivera will be tried by summary court
martial and may be shot at once with the
pallant Bacallao, though suffering from
his wounds. Such are said to be General
Weyler'a orders.
No man of importance has teen exe
cuted siace the war began, and n great
outcry is likely to follow if Rivera is shot,
as the general view is that civilized na
tions parole, exchange or imprison pris
oners of war.
While the Spanish say that the insur- j
gent is a prisoner of war it is remembered
that General Weyler in a decree said:
"Any man caught without a miiitarv pass
outside of the lines duriug the state of war
is guilty of rebellion."
Rivera has been charced with incen
diarism, as is usual, and if he is not
executed at once it will be because the
{ Spanish fear to act in a manner to create
a feeling against them in the United
âº States.
Already many stories are told here of
the manner in which Rivera was cap
tured. One is that a commissioner sent
to confer with Rivera had given informa
tion as to Rivera's position, forces, etc.
There are other stories of treachery, but
the story most generally accepted hers is
that he was surprised and captured owing
to his wounded condition.
It is said that Rivera is an American
citizen, bat be is not registered at the
Consulate, and no appeal bas been made
Jto Consul-General Lee. If such were the

1 Vote of Defeat.
LONDON Eng . March 31.â The debate
on the iiu/;on introduced in the Housi oi
Common/ by Hon. Edward Blake (Na
tionalist/ proposing a readjustment of the
Irish tax rate, was continued in the House
to-day. The motion was supported by
Thorns* Lough (Liberal) and opposed by
H. 0. irnold-Forsier (Unionist).
Right Hon. John Morley, Chief Secre
tary for Ireland in the Rosebery Ministry,
then took the floor and spoke in favor of
the motion, saying in the course of his
speech that besides suffering from local
depression Ireland had also suffered from
tie oppression of the landlords, but the
Utter had been s-topped by Mr. Gladstone.
Mr. Blake's motion was finally rejected by
a vote oi 317 to 157.
The motion introduced by Thomas F.
Whlttaker (Liberal) that while the ex
chequers of Great Britain and Ireland
remained consolidated all portions of the
United Kingdom must be regarded as one
country for fiscal purposes, was not voted
upon, the House adjourning before a vote
was reached.
Right Hon. George J. Goschen, Lord of
th* Admiralty, contended that the rate of
taxation in Ireland did not press any
heavier upon the poor in that island than
the English taxation did upon the poor in
London or elsewnere.
Nevertheless, he said, he could not ac
cept Mr. Whittaker's amendment because
a Government commission was already
appointed to inquire into tbe question
whether payments in Ireland for local
purposes could not be treated as offsetting
the payments by Ireland to the imperial
treasury.

CANE A, Csete, March 31.â A force of
insurgents intent on capturing Izzedin
occupied the hillside south of Suda Bay
last nigbU The position was ratber an ex
posed one, Â»nd the insurgents were com
pelled to withdraw by a warm fire poured
into the ranks by the British, Austrian
and Russian warships moored in the bay.
This afternoon, however, the insurgents
attempted to recover their ground and
the firing became very heavy.

LONDON, Esq., March 31.â The Canea
correspondent of the Standard describes
the righting ; arour- 1 the fort/at Izzedin.
The garrison ct>* sis ted of 300 ; Turks who
had twelve Jf' v P D suns and two ] Norden
â fpldt'VguV, " Tl)e guns, however, were
traineo-* award a were useless to repel
anÂ»' ttck from the , land side of the fort. â 
more troops with two Krupp and two
tSordenfeldt guns. Beyond this position
there was a strong stone wall where the
insurgents were masted under the Greek
side.
It is impossible to say which side began
the righting, but the engagement was in
full swing at 8 o'clock in the morning.
The Turuisa soldiers in the blockhouse
took but a small part in the fighting, bat
a Turkish frigate shelled freely, though
with small success.
An hour later the foreign warships were
ordered to fire. The Russian warship
Grosiastichy opened fire. She was fol
lowed by the British warship Ardent and
the Austrian warship Tiger. Each fired
in turn, aiming chiefly at the Greek vil
lage. The fire from the Russian warship
finally demolished the whole wall, every
shot from her taking effect.
Despite this the Greeks held their posi
tions and finally succeeded in driving
back the Turkish outposts, although they
were compelled to desert their principal
Dosition behind the stone wall.
The British ship Camperdown opened
fire upon the insurgents, who were then
compelled to withdraw. The Camper
down was at the range of GSOO yards. She
opened with her thirtean-inch guns. The
effect was instantaneous. Three of four
percusssion shells burst right in the midst
of the insurgents, causing them to run for
shelter in all directions. The gun prac
tice of the Camperdown was perfect, while
the noiae of the enormous shells hurtling
through the still air was enough to frighten
the enemy.
Things were now too hot to last, and the
flag was speedily lowered and the insur
gents hastily retreated, while the Russian
and Austrian warships fired with extreme
accuracy a succession of shrapnel. The
last shell was tired at a quarter past 10.
The Russian and Austrian warships then
steamed away on blockade service and tho
Ardent returned to Suda.
The Turks quickly sallied forth and
established themselves in the insurgent
positions amid demonstrations of delight.
They advanced across the open space with
great coolness under a continuous fire
from the Cretan sharpshooter?, who stood
their ground until the last moment. Tbey
never budged until further resistance was
out of the question.
At 11:30 the Turfcs were still pouring a
roarin? rifle tire into the retreating masses
of insurgents. Tbe latter replied with,
great spirit. Their grand defense excited
ihe admiration of all witnesses.
It is evident that they vrere not discour
aged by the odds against them, for they
sent a letter stating that they intended to
attack the fort at Butsunaria. In tha
evening of that day the fort was occupied
by European troops.
After the events of the morning the ad
mirals decided that it was not necessary
to place a mixed garrison at Izzadin.
A rough estimate places the number of
shells discharged througnout the engage
ment at 100.

ATHENS, Gbeece. March 3J.â A dis
patch from Retime, Crete, steles that the
Russian Consul at that pace to-day
visited the town of Alsipopulo for the
purpose of communicating to the insur
gents the proclamation recently issued by
the foreign admirals, announcing the in
tention of tha six great powers to estab
lish an autonomous form of government
ana to invite the insurgents to lay aowu2
their arms. Hi 3 attempt was as unsuc
cessful as those made in the same direc
tion by the admirals and their reprerenta
tives.
The insurgents listened patiently to the
Consul's explanation of the benefits that
would accrue to them under the form of
government proposed by the powers and
then declined to make any concessions
whatever. Tneir leaders declared that
they did not desire autonomy, feeling
that it would prove as farcical as the pre
vious attempts to establish self-govern
ment on tlie island. They had taken up
their arms to drive the Turks from the
island and to brin^ about annexation with
Greece. The desired to be placed under
the Government of King George, and they
Dimly declared that annexation was the
only thing that they would accept.
It being impossible for Colonel Vassos,
the commander of the Greek troops in
Crete, to use the cable for the transmis
sion of dispatches, the admirals having
prohibited its use, communication with
him wes established a day or so at;o by
means of Hash signals by way of the Island
of Anticythcre, south of Cerigo. To-day
Colonel Vasso3 sent to Kin^ George the
following message by heligoraph:
Alikiana, March 31.
Sir.: Contrary to promises the admirals

- CANE A, Crete, March 3L â Colonel
Vassos has sent a long and strong protest
to the foreign admirals against the charges
concerning him which they have cabled
to their, respective Governments. The
protest is addressed to Admiral Canevaro,
the Italian naval officer who is in com
mand, by reason of seniority, of the com
bined fleets of the powers. Colonel Vas
eos claims that Mussulman authorities
have armed the refugees who flocked to
this city and allowed them to sally forth
and massacre Christians. He protests
also against tbe warships firing on tbe
Christians in occupation of the coast
towns and others further Inland without
a shadow of serious motive. After these
indictments, whirh are set forth at great
length. Colonel Vassos concludes:
"Never before have religious passions
been so completely let loose. The hatred
between the two elements of the Cretan
â¢population knows no longer any bounds.
All confidence has been destroyed, not
only in the benevolence but even in the
justice ana humanity of the powers, and
the Cretan Christians whose sons and
'brothers have been massacred by the
Turkish bullets and European shells, and
who are now thenselves threatened with
a famine more destructive than war, are
bunted down and Pvsacuted by tho-e
great powers who actual^ ] ay C a j" m to be

' LONDON, Em;., March 31.â The daily
News will to-morrow say that a commis
sion, composed of Said Pasha, president
of the Council of State, and. Alexander
-Kratheedri Pasha, was to have gone to
,Greece, but an intimation . was given to
.the Porte that it would not be allowed to
land. Russia, the paper adds, threatened
to occupy Anatolia and other parts of the
territory unless the negotiations
â¢were dropped. . : <
V The News further says that the Porte
,has taken measures to prevent Greeks
leaving Turkey similar to those adopted
*ome time ago regarding the Armenians.
"A census of the Greeks in the empire 1 will
be taken for this purpose.
' Despite the report from St Petersburg
â¢that complete unanimity does not exist
among the powers as to the proper course
to be followed in the Cretan matter, a
dispatch from Canea states that it is re
garded there that the removal of the
Turkish troops is necessary as soon as the
â European . garrisons are strong enough to
fully occupy the forts.
The dispatch adds that the continued
presence of the Turkish soldiery will seri
ously hinder the pacification of the island,
the Christians not being willing to listen
to proposals for peace so long as the hated
Turks hold the fortified places.

The proposal that has been made that a

except those between proletary lines,
are also to be fixed by th, board. The
board is empowered to call a meeting of

it deems advisable. The agreement sets
forth: "Nothing herein shall b s so con

duty of the board to so exercise tie power
conferred upon it as to discourage and, so

Parties to the agree m ent are required, to

in force until December 1, 1898, when the
contracts with the members of the pres

ninety days after written notice of inten

been given by a member.
. The sentiment among railroad officials
when interviewed to-day on the bill intro
duced by Senator Foraker, permitting
pooling among the road?, was that such a
measure was sure to avert the ruin of the
roads, and they hoped it would pass
quickly as a relief from the present
emergency.

proceeded to the consideration ofxecu

the arbitration treaty but the qr.t'.ion of
tilling the vacancies on the stauufg com- i

to-morrow, or at the first favoifble oppor

that the exigencies of the times do not

The voting began proOTtly at 2 o'clock,
according to the agreenf nt, the first vote
being on the amen imeit offered by Hoar,
which consisted of a combination of tha |
Cbiiton amendment afd the amendment
to the first article of ue treaty submitted
by the committee. Tim provides that
"any difference wbih in the judgment of
either power eith crfnaierially affects is
honor or its domestic or fcreUn policy
shall not be referred to arbitrmion under
this treaty eicuviLy special agreement."
There is also adfled a provision similar
to that of Chiltol's, which stipulates that
each question proposed to be submitted
to arbitration under the treaty must first
be sent to the Senate for action by that
bo y, as in theca^e of the original treaty.
Tnis was adopted, 54 to 13.
Despite the adoption of this, Chilton
pressed his amendment, bat it was iaid
on the ta ble.
Bacon's amendment eliminated all
questions relative to the bonded indebted
ness or other securities of the States was
also iaid upon the table, but without an
aye and me vote.
Foraker, contending that the text of
the treaty was ambiguous as to the tribu
nals to bÂ« establ.sned, offered an amend
ment which provides that there shall be a
separate court for each case that may be
suumttted, and this was agreed to by a

A BjG LOCKOUT IMMINENT.
Clash Between Employers and Walking
Delegates May Affect 40,000 Men
in th* Emldng Traces
NEW YORK. N. V., March 31.-i The
Mason Builders' Association at a meeting
held lust night m the Building Trades
Club to consider the situation of the bui.d
ing irade growing out of the arbitrary
strikes recently ordered by the board of
walking delegate* determined to resist
the exactions of that body and to open a
determined tight.
To make the fight effective tdey ap
pointed a committee to obtain the co
operation of all the employers' associa
tions in the building trades.
Tuis step puts an end to the agreement
which has existed for years between the
masons' and bricklayers' unions and the
Mason Builders' Association, by which
the union kept aloof from the board of
walking delegates and the association
from the other employers' associat ons.
Tins means that there will probably be
a peneral lockout of all the men con
nected with tbe board ol walking o>le
f^ues ordered in a few days. Such a lock
out will affect at least 40,100 men.
In the event of a lockout they will be
allowed to return to work as soon as they
snver their connection* wi.h ttie board,
and the employers declare that nine
teiitiis of the good workmen are willina
to do so as soon as they learn that tuey
will be protected against sympathetic
strikes.
It is certain, however, that the em
ployers have decided tiiat tUey will not
any longer submit to the authority of the
walking delegates. No notice will be
taken of BisuoD Potter's attempt to arbi
trate the trouble.
The ooard of walking delegates will
meet this afternoon ana probably will then
decide upon an aggressive course of ac
tion.
The State Board of Mediation and Arbi
tration arrived in town last night and wili
"ffer their services as arbitrators to-day.
They will probably bÂ« rejected.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 31.â 1t is
well known here that Associate Justice
Field expects to retire in the near future.
He is now so feebie that, ho can scarcely
walk. He is no longer mentally qualified
to perform his duties on the bench, al
tticugu his real condition is carefnt'y
shielded by his associates, who assist him
in writing his opinions. Justice Fieid
walks with a cane, and only totters to Â»Â»d
from the courtroom. He has hehl on to
his ollice so that he might b.-eaK the
â¢record" for loneest service on the United
tsates Supreme Court bench. He wat>
anxious that Juage Ro-3 of I.os Angeles
might succeed him, but now realizes that
it is only a question of a EÂ«Â« months until
he must relinquish his office. No exact
time has beeu fixed upon for his retire
ment, despite the announcement of a New
York paper this niornii^.
ihe Call was the first paper in the
United States to announce that Judge
McKenna would be appointed Attorney-
Genera;. At the time lUis dispatch was
printed it was aho announced that Presi
dent McKinloy would aDPoint McKeuna
to tucceed Justice Field on the United
States Supreme bench, and this pro
gramme wili be carried ouj.
It now seems to be altogether probable
that Judge Morrow will be elevated to the
Circuit bench to succeed McKenna, and
that M. M. Estee will be appointed to
the United Slates District bench to suc
ceed Morrow.
Mr. Loud will insist upon the appoint
ment cf Harry N, Morse as Marshal for
the Northern District of California, and :
he will be appointed.
It is settled that John P. JackÂ«on will be
Collector of Customs at San Francisco,
and it is reasonably certain that Joe Spear
will be appointed surveyor. Mr. Spear
and wife will leave for home in a few days.
The sudden departure of Judge de
Haven for his home has occasioned some
surprise here. He realized that he could
not be appointed a United States Judge,
tut some members of the California dele
gation are surprised that the Judsie should
not have caliei to say good-by. One
member expressed fear that the Judge
had been "shanghaied."

in the value and benefit of the protective

features that he did not approve, but he
was willing to take it as it came from his
P.epublican associates. [Applause.]
Sayert (D. ) of Texas moved an amend
ment to the hoop-iron paragraph to admit
cotton ties free of duty, supporting in in a
vigorous speech. The amendment was
not in order.
The committee arose temporarily, and
W. ii. King, the new Representative irom

Ohio, appeared at the bar and was sworn

The iast bours for the consideration of
the bill was largely given to general de

On the separate amendment reserved

noesâ ayes 200. noes 140.
This vote was nearly along party lines,
the Republicans voting for tlie amend

it. Hartman of Montana and Shafroth of
Colorado, silver men, and Jones of Wash
ington, Martin, Shulord and Siroud of

WASHINGTON, D. C. March 31.â 1n
the Seriate to-day Pettigrew gave notice
of an amendment to the tariff bill which
will remove from the dutiable and plnce
on ihe lree list all articles of like charac
ter of domestic production or manufac
ture that are made or controlled by a
trust or combination for the purpose of

The Board of Education hns been ap

of the City west of Castro and south of

The same request was made to the pre

but the usual excuse of short fnnds was
advanced as a reason why a schooluouse

The two nearest school buildings to this
section are located, one â the Douglas

streets, and the otherâ the James Liek â
on Twenty-fifth and No? streets. Both of
these are over half a mile from the east

children of school age reside.
The two school buildings mentioned are
already overcrowded, and it hns been
found necessary to secure additional

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1897.
JAPANESE REBEL
AT HONOLULU
Furious at the Strict En
forcement of Immigra
tion Laws.
Hundreds of Emigrants Not Al
lows;! to Set Foot on
Hawaiian Soil.
Tbs Islands Are Great y Dependent
oa the Japanese Authorities
for OrJer.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, March 23.â The
United States steamer Marion arrived ou
the 18th in nineteen days from San Diego,
to relieve the Alert. The Alert sailed ior
San Francisco on the 22d.
The final outcome of tho case of Japan
ese immigrants per Shinshin Maree was
the quiet departure of that steamer for
Japan on tho2oih. taking back with her
413 of the 670 immigrants she brought.
By the advice of the Japanese Consul-
General none but passive resistance was
made by thecautain or the immigrants to
the decisions ot the court and the Govern
ment, leaving the matter of redress to the
action of the Japanese Government.
The greatest excitement has prevailed
among the reiident Japanese, who are in
censed at this exclusion of their people,
although in conformity to regulations
which have previously been enforced upon
persons of other nationalities. A mass
meeting of Japanese was held on the even
ing of the 17th after the adverse decision
of the court. Although some intemperate
language was used the influence of Japan
ese officials prevailed to secure the passage
of a moderate resolution to state the facts
in the case to the Government of Japan
and abide by their decision.
Tfce feeling among all classes of whites
has been strong in favor of tirni action In
deporting all disqualified immigrants.
Strong language has been freely used
respecting an apprehended weakness
on the part of the Government
in carrying out the laws through
fear cf trouble with Japan. The Chinese
have also been gratitieit, boing in antipa
thy to the Japanese. On the other hand
the active section of the joyai party as
represented by certain native papers and
the independent are greatly displeased,
it being their hope after the Japanese be
come more numerous to enlist them in a
combination to restore monarchy under
the protection of Japan.
The proereas of the affair has been as
follows: The case of tne immigrants hav
ing been carried beiore the Supreme Court,
as previously reported, counsel on both
sides were heard by the court for several
days. On tne morninc of the 17th a unan
imous decision of the three Justices was
rendered sustaining the power of the Col
lector.
It wai held by the court that the treaty
right claimed lor the immigrants to con
sult and employ counsel uppiied only to
aliens actually resident, and not to those
still not landed, but only under examina
tion as to their right to land. The treaty
provisions apply only to judicial proceed
ings, and not to the executive proceedings
of the Deputy Collector. The act direct
ing the Deputy Collector to make the ex
amination conflicts with no treaty right
under the "most favored nation" clause,
because no discrimination is made by it
between subjects of different countries.
Especial rÂ«-ference was made to a de
cision of the United States Supreme
<'ourt relating to the act of Congress of
March 3, 1891, which the Hawaiian statute
c osely follows, and which, like ours*, con
fers upon special officers the duty of in
spectinc all alien passengers and deciding
upon their right to land. The United
States court asserted the exclusive right
of such officer to decide the rigtus of
aliens to land, beyond interference by
other tribunal. Following the American
precedent, the Hawaiian court dismissed
the petition of thÂ« Japanese immigrants
and remanded them to the control of the
Collect or- General.
On account of the strong feeling ex
hibited by the Japanese residents, in
which their Consul-General Shimamura
manifestly participated, it was deemed
best by the Government to institute a
fresh and more thorough investigation
into every individual case of the 535
immigrants rejected by the Deputy Col
lector.
This examination was conducted by H.
E. Cooper, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and J. B. Castle, Collector-General, who,
during the 18th and 19th, did twenty-four
hours' hard work at ihe Quarantine, end
ing at midnight, when the last batch were
sent aboard. The Japanese Consul was
admitted to participate in the inquiry at
the beginning and later was allowed to
conduct inquiries independently and
apart. As a final result 122 of the 535
immigrants previously rejec:ed were al
lowed admission and 413 reshipped to
Japan, creat leniency being exercised in
the construction of evidence. A number
of cases were found where valid contracts
for labor appeared to have been made.
The leading souice of difference wai in
the construction placed upon the alleged
po^ses-uon ot $50 as required by law in the
case of tbo.se not entering as contract
laborer.-. Most ot *uch claimants exhib
ited the exact sum in their hands, either
in the form of two American gold twen
ties with one ten, or in that of Japanese
paper for 100 yen. Many of these had
freely admitted to the Deputy Collector
that the money was lent them to get
ashore with by the immigration agent, al
though on the final examination they all
declared that it had been given them by
relatives. This form of deception has long
been habitual. Not long since a white
man practicing it was reshipped to San
Francisco.
The recklessness and audacity in which
the Japanese differ from the careful and
orderly Chines-; causes much anxiety.
They are now kept, in order by the author
ity of their own officials. This makes us
dependent upon the Japanese authorities
in nn unpleasant degree.
Th? Sakura-Maru arrived from Japan on
the 20th with 316 more immigrants. The
authorities wore busy in investigating
their cases during the whole of the 21-Â«t
and 22d, witli the result that 153 were ad
mitted and 163 were rejected. These were
adjudged not to be bona-fide possessors of
the $50 required. They are to remain
here in charge of the Marshal, W. G. Ir
â¢rla <fe Co. giving bonds to return them to
Japan by the earliest opportunity.
Another batch of 500 immigrants is
learned to be on the way hither.
Btrona representations are being sent
to Japan *^y this mail denouncing as an
outrage the liberty taken by this Govern
ment in discriminating against any immi
grant who exhibits $50 in his possession.
In the case of every person rejecied, how
ever, the Collector has satisiactory evi
dence that he wan not in Dona-fide pos
session, but was under ooligation to repay
ihe loan to the agents as soon as he wa*
landed. The introduction to this city of
several hundred destitute Japanese every
week would be certain to cause more or
Jess severe distress in various ways.

to districts in Colorado, Wyoming and
the Black Hill< of South Dakota.
TLe Union Pacific experienced the great
est trouble on the main line between Sid
ney and Laratnie. West-bound ext>ress

then was run back to Laramie, where it
was sidetracked until to-day noon.

train wÂ»& tied up at Limon, Colo.; Tues
day, and has not reached Omaha yet.
The west-bound fast train was also stalled
at Limon, together wiih the limited trains
from Kansas City and St. Joe. It is ex
pected that the rotary plows will get
through the drifts some time to-morrow.

very much the same. The limited which
left Lteuver Tuesday night got as far as
McCook, Neb., where it stuck in a drift.
The west-bound train was stalled at
Holdredge, Neb., and the local trains were
tied up all along the road. Not a train is
running on the Black Hills, Wyoming
and Montana division of the road.

for my present sitnation. She made it her
business to go to the bank where I did my
business and where I nave always had the
highest standing and state that I was
destined to become bankrupt. She has
also bandied about the streets all sorts of
stories having no foundation except in
her own imagination. I was thrown out of

RANDSBURG, Cal., March 31.-During
the past two weeks many leading citizens,
prospectors and miners have caught the
Panamint fever. Two gentleraeu, on their
return from Panarnint yesterday, counted
forty teams and outfits on the road to the
new mires. Ten days ago there were only
two wooden buildings and two tents at
Ballarat, the new mining camp of the
desert. To-day there are seventeen, and
a general store, Wd yard and two saloons
are doing a thriving business.
Eight miles east of Ballarat, in Pleas
ant Canyon, another camp has been
started, and it has its store, feed yard and
saloon. Town sites are already laid oui at
both places and town lots are being sold
at from $10 to |7S ecch. An abundance of
water and mesqait timber is at hand. In
the mountains near by are great quanti
ties of pinon pine. The climate is similar
to that at Randsburc, and tents answer
very well lor the protection of the gold
seekers.
Montgomery Urothers and Longford
liave a group of nineteen mines, which are
bonded to San Francisco capitalists. Two
of the groupâ the World Beater and the
Elephant â are now being worked. Four
drifts or tunnels in the World Beater
?now high-grade free- milling ore. The
top level starts in on a four-foot vein that
increases to seventeen feet at a distance of
sixty feet. In a 120-foot drift in the Ele
phant there is a well-defined ledge of high
grade free-milling ore. The vein is six
feet wide on top and fourteen feet at a
depth of forty feet. A clean-up irom a six
days' run with a small Bryan raiil of ten
tons a day capacity netted $7000. Forty
live men are employed at $2 a day and
board each.
Many transfers are being made in the
new Panamint country. Two weeks ago
a Spaniard named Valencia discovered a
ledge and immediately sold his claim to
San Francisco capitalists for $15,000. The
purchasers have in turn sold it to a Chi
cago syndicate. Another prospector
(Charles White) sold his claim for $6000.
H. S. Meyer, a Tulare capitalist, has
bonded a group of six claimÃ adjoining the
Montgomery property, also two water
rights.
The principal camps are located in
Pleasant, Tuber, Jail and Happy canyons.
About eighty men are now employed in
tne severrl mines. Owing to the great
distance from Mojave (120 miles) hay is
worth $45 a tons. All other goods and
provisions are proportionately high. Pros
j ectors must necessarily be well supplied
with money and provisions.
In the Rademacher district there is
much activity in mining. Forty-seven
camps have been established. Consider
sble work is being done on Dr. Echafer's
mine, and aiso on the Rademacher, Louis
Riggs', McKinney Brothers' and the
O'Connor and Rutherford properties.
A couple of arastas are being run in that
district. At present most of the ore is
being shipped to Kernville. A Hunting
ton mill is now being erected at Higgens'
Wells, which will be of great benefit to the
mineÂ»fid ciaim-ownersof the Rademacher
uistrict. This district is blessed with
plenty of water, it being found at a dis
tance of thirty feet beneath the surface.
Heretofore tl.e Argus district has al
ways been considered as a silver-bearing
country, but late discoveries are showing
up well in goid. The output from this
district is shipped to Pueblo and Kern
ville.
Slate Range is forty-one miles north of
Randsburp, and it is coming to the front.
New and valuable discoveries are being
made there every aay. A number of good
mines are in active operation. The Otto

try the case if it came up. â '. Mr. McGowan

trict Attorney had been charged with a
felony and that the commissioner wished

SUNSET DISTRICT STRIFE.
Suit Brought to Oust KcWhirter and
Martin From Positions on the
Directorate.
FRESNO. Cal., March Si.â The trouble
in the Sunset Irrigation District between
the two factions which cannot agree as to
whether the irrigation scheme snail be
carried out has assumed a new phase.
Yesterday John Curtin brought suit in
the name of the people against Milton
McWhirter and L. h. Martin to oust them
from the board of directors, lo which they
were recently ejected. The election was
held on February 6 and five directors were j
chosen. The plaintiff alleges that Milton !
McVvhirter is not entitled to the office
because he has not been a resident of the
district for some time and Lias not coin*
plied with certain requirements con
nected with the assumption of the cilice.
The complaint against Martin, the other
director, is similar to that against Mc-
Whirter.
The Sunset Irrigation District appears
to be in a bad way. The people who com
prise it are divided into two factions of
about equal strength, a.nd the feeling, is
very bitter.
NOTES OF THE THEATERS.
Mrs. Russ Whytai's Pretty Act
ing in "For Fair
Virginia."
Osbourne's Strong Death Scene in
"New Blood" â Some Coining
Concerts-
A very pretty and interesting story of
war times is "For Fair Virginia," in
which Mr. and Mrs. ItuÂ«s Whytal are ap
pearing at the Columoia Theater. There
is nothing pretentious about the play, but
it teils a natural story in a simple and
effective way.
The two characters who stand out as de
lightful bits of character acting are Mrs.
Whytai's Nell Esmond, the Yankee Rirl,
and Miss Lottie Briscoe'a portrayal of
little Julian Esmond. The rest of the
cast is good and the play is artistically
staged.
"For Fair Virginia" will run all next
week.
The pretty drama, "His Grace de Gram
mont," will receive its last production at
the Baldwin Theater to-morrow. Satur
day Otis Skinner will play Hamlet, which
is considered one of his most successful
roles.
The scenes of Otis Skinner's new roman
tic play, which he will present the major
portion of next week at the Baldwin
Theater, are laid in italy at the beginning
of tha sixteenth century, at the time of
the second invasion of that country by the
French. The play is called "A Soldier of
Fortune," and is from the pen of the actor
himself.
The strongest scene in "New Blood" at
the Alcazar is Courtland Crandall's death,
when up to the last moment be hesitates
about signing an unjust will, and finally
tears it to ribbons just before breathing
his last. George Osbourne, wboplayb the
role, dies in so realistic and grewionie a
manner that the audience insists on hav
ing the curtain up again and again at the
end of the act.
The cast of "New H.ood" is a long one,
embracing twenty- two characters, all
tolJ. Most of the parts are effectively
filled, and the play is going very smoothly.
'The Dago" is drawing well at the
Grand. Its sensational scenes are start
ling and have some of the spice of novelty,
and the songs and specialties introduced
are aii clever.
"Don Juan Ad Lib," with its many
jokes and specialties, is providing plenty
of mirth for Tivoli audiences. Some of
the songs are nightly encored again and
again and the ballets win even more ap
plause than usual.
The Orpheum bill is attracting the usual
large number of variety-lovers. Henry
Lee's impersonations continue to grow in
favor, and the act of (be four Cohens is
going batter this week than it did last.
The Oberon is varying its programme
nightiy and is attracting the usual num
ber of music-lovers.
The grand Wagner concert of the Sym
hony Orchestra becrins at 3 o'clock this
afternoon at the Columbia Theater.
"Rigoletto" is to ba the bill at the Cali
fornia Thealer this evening. Henri Aibers
will sing the title role, one in which he
has achieved prominent success. On Sat
urday night "La Juive" is to be repeated
ior the last time. "William Tell" is an
nounced for Monday and the great pro
duction of "Aldn" is to be repeated by the
company on Wednesday. An event of
importance will be the production of
"Hamlet" for the first tim* in this City
on Friday night on the occasion of the tes
timonial benefit to be tendered Barytone
Albcrs.
To-morrow night Miss Dorothy L'Hote
will make her debut upon the professional
stage at the California Theater, present
ing Tom Taylor's beautiful play, "An Un
equal Match." Miss L'Hote will be as
sisted by professional talent, including
members of Modjeska's and Haworth'a
companies. Â»
NO MORE SPECIAL RATES.
They Will 1 Not Be C runted for Kxcur
- â  ion Parties Coming to San ; 
i'rancisco. â¢ '-
No men special rates .for excursion
parlies to San Francisco will be granted
by the Southern Pacific Company,. owing
to the refusal of the Board of j Supervisors
to pass the anti-scalpers' ordinance. This
means that mem bars of organizations de
siring to hold conventions in San Fran
cisco will have to pay the full fare "here
after. -.":. -' r T ; â  r r.^,.-;
â¢'The company," said one of General
Passenger Agent Goodman's representa
tives yesterday, "has been badly treated
in the past through the manipulation of
excursion tickets by scalpers, ana it has
found it Necessary to call a halt. The
new rule applies only to business directed
to San Francisco, and In order to get the
benefit of former special rates organiza
tions desiring to bold Stale conventions
will have to select some place other than
San Francisco where transportation privi
leges are not abused as they have been in
this City."

that it cures every disease that dru s will cure, and cures many, that drugs will not

Counterfeit Dollars.
The two i en whom The . Call an
nounced yesterday morning as having
been arrested for passing counterfeit coin
were -brought before United States Com
missioner Heacock yesterday. They were
George Lewiston, cashier for Barlan &

cashier for the Chicago Bookmaking Club.
The charge against them was passing a
counterfeit silver dollar. :.....
'liny explained that they had come
from the East, where paper money is most
in vogue, and that they were not suffi- 1
ciently familiar with gold and silver coin
to be able to detect counterfeits. It is not
expected that a conviction can be had,
but it is believed that the arrest will be. a
warning to them. , They were released on
$250 bail. ' . :. -
The Secret Service Department reports
that one bookmaker on the Oakland track
turned over to Detectiva Harris ninety

been withheld. If the man was known

The British ship Creasing.on, after being
out from .Newcastle, N. S. W., 106 days,
arrived in port yesterday. Her arrival
relieved the mental tension of those in
terested in both the vessel and the cargo,
but their uneasiness was perfectly nat
ural, as 106 days is an exceedingly lengthy
trip for a vessel bound to this port from
Australia.
The Crfssington is laden with 3267 tons
of coal for J. D. Spreckels Uro-. & Co.
Her lengthy voyage was due to light and
head winds and calms. On March 29, in
latitude 37 deg. X., longitude 126 deg. W.,
she encountered a heavy gale from the
southwest to north, with a very high, con
fused sea, and her mainsail and foresail
were blown away.
The steamer Rio de Janeiro, which ar
rived irom the Orient ana Honolulu the

Been on the front for a long time occurred
about 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon on the

execution, few prizerings have seen any
thing like it.
It seems that two men of a quarrelsome
disposition came on board and proceeded
to make things lively, ending with a
threat to throw second mate TinsJey over
board. They were invited to do so and
started in, when first mate Hall took a
hand.
The four men had it fiom one side of
the deck to the other, all the while tight

HIS LICENSE REVOKED.
Captain Dye Dfc'ared Responsi
ble for the Damage to
the Sunol.
Hs Is Charged With Unskillfulness
and Negligence by the Local
Inspectors.
O. F. Bolles and W. A. Phillips, local
inspectors of Steam Hulls and Boilers,
made their report yesterday on the Sunol
collision and revoked Captain Dye's
license for negligence. The report pays:
The â¢learner Sunol lef . her dock at San Fran
cisco for Vallejo at 4 o'clock p. m., March 17
ana about fifteen minutes afierward collided
wi'h the bark Olympic.
Tne barks Alden Besse and Olympic were
on this occasion coming in from sea. about
abreast of each other (the former a little
ahead) with a strong ebb tide, fresh northwest
wind and ciear weather: the A, den Besse in
tnvr of a steam tug and the Olympic under
short xail with square yards.
The Sunol passed a short distance ahead of
the Alden Besse. Captain Dye then attempted
to pass under the stern of the O.ymplc, but
fouij'l that 'he rudder of his su-anu-r would
not work. He then stopped and tacked his
engines *or a short time, and went ahead at
full spe -d trying to cross me bows oi the
Olympic, but the bark struck th<Â« Sunol tbout
amidships on the port side, pushing ahead and
rolling the it niner over.
After careful consideration of the ev.dence
we are o; the opinion that Captain Dye was
unskilliul and negligent in navigating the
â¢teamer on March 17 In trying to pass ahead
of the Oijmple. He did stop and b ck the en
gines, and ihould have continued backing in
stead of going ahead at full speed. Had he
done so. It is our opinion that the collision
would have been avoided.
Theretore. under the authority conferred
upon us by section 4450, United States Re
vised Statutes, for reason of such unskillful
ness and negligence, we have this date re
voked ihe license of Captain S. W. Dye as mas
ter and pilot oi steam vessels. License dated
December 7, 1596.
The hull oi the Sunol wag towed to the dock
and righted. Da;nÂ«ee to the steamer is esti
mated m ntjoui $8000. Bullion to the vi-.lue of
about $'25,000 was iost overboard, but may be
recovered.

of a Very Large
Estate.
Alleges That a Trust Which the
Testator Attempted to Establish
Is Invalid.
William Holt Aldrich, by his attorneys,
W. H. H. Hart, Clarence W. Ashford,
Ayleit R. Cotton and Robert W. King,
yesierday filed a suit which is la fact a
contest of the will of his late father, Wil
liam A. Aldrich, who died in Alameda
County, February 25, 1892.
The defendants named in fie action are

ning, George A. Aldrich, Willard T. Bar
ton, William G. Dunning, May C. Al
drich, Helen H. Aldrich, Bernice A. Al
drich, Ailene K. Aldrich, William Arnold
Aldrich and Swinton D. Aldrich, all of
â whom are claiming interest in the estate
of the late William Aldrich, the value of
which is estimated to be worth about
$1,000,000.
The catalogue of real estate and personal
property includes the following:
Cash, $1000; 1000 shares of Savings and
Loan Society *t< ck, 5421 snares of the South
Feather and Union Mining Company, 435

In the Abbey Homestead. San Mateo County,
and a big ranch In Merced Couuty.
Mr. Aldrich bequeathed $1000 to his
friend Charles H. Brunage, $500 to Jennie
Dougherty, $500* to the 1-abiola Hospital,
100 shares of stock in the Savings and
Loan Society to his daughter, Helen A.
Dunning; the family residence at Pied
mont to his daughter, Anna A. Barton;
and bis silverware to his son, William
Holt Aldrich of Honolulu.
The point involved in the suit is that
William A. Aldrich attempted by his will
to establish a trust contrary to law, to the
detriment of the plaintiff in this suit, con
trary to the law of California as explained,
and established by the Supreme Court in
the well-known Waiter ley estate litigation.
The trust attempted to be establisiied is
specially mentioned in the ninth section
of the will, which bequeaths: in trust the
residue of â  the estate to Irustees Annie A.
Barton, Helen A. Dunning, Joseph M.
Quay and Arthur A. Smith, with full
power for them to control the same, sub
ject to the restrictions set down in the
wilL One-fourth of the estate and profits
are directed to be paid to Annie A. Barton
and one- fourth to be distributed similarly
to Helen A. Dunning. One-quarter was
given in trust for the benefit of his Â»on,
George A. Aldrich, an inmate of the Napa
Asylum for Insane. â¢â -' -â  â 
When it came to William Holt Aldricb,
the plaintiff in this suit, the testator pro
vided that the trustees should pay for the
proper education of the children of said
William, and that they should pay to him
the remainder ol the profits and income
on one-fourth uf the estate during his
natural life, but that he should have no
power to anticipate or mortgage or in any.
way incnmber his share or the. income,
and his [Children are to succeed him in
interest under like restrictions. '
It was further provided in the will that
if at the date of me death of said William
all of his children shall not have attained
the a c of 24 years then the payment of
their share shall be postponed Until they
shall attain that age. If none of his
children survive then the one-fourth share
here considered shall pass to the other
heirs-at-law as part of the residue of the
estate of the testator.
i The plaintiff shows to the court that he
is the- son of William A. Ajdrlch, de
ceased, and one of re heirs-at-law, and as
such heir he acquired by succession on
the ; death of his father absolute title to
one-fourth of the estate of 1 the decedent,
and particularly of that property described
in the ninth section of the will, which was
attempted to : be distributed ,to the de
fendant trustees. He says': that the trus
tees here named pretend to have a right
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1897.
to the control and management of the
property de-cribed as ttie residue of the
estate, but that in fact they have no right
to do so, as the trust which the testator,
his father, attempted to impose on them
is invalid and void, because it suspended
the power of the testator from tho death
of the testator to the birth oi the plain
tiffs last child.
He asks for a decree of court setting
aside the order of distribution heretofore
maiie by tho Probate Court, and that he
b? given immediate possession of bis
quÃrter of the residue of his father's es
tate. He uvurs that bis sisters have al
ways had possession and control of the
property, for which reason he is notable
to stata its value.
At the time the order of distribution
was made in the estate of Wi liam A.
Aldrich, father of the plaintiff in this.
cs~e, in the year 1893, the principle laid
down in the \Valkerley litigation nad not
been enunciated by the Supreme Court
of Caliiornia. Since the last-nieutioned
decision several tiusts that otherwise
would have been considered valid have
been successfully attacked in Departments
9 and 10 of the Superior Court of San
Francisco, presided over by Judge Coffey
and Judge Slack.
William A. Aldrich was a member ol
the old firm of Merrill & Co.. engaged
in the island trade, and made his for*
tune in that business. He was a mem*
ber of tho Legislature in 1871-72. In
the later years of his life he had con
siderable trouble with the son who now
seeks to break down the provisions of his
will.
A Stubborn Cigar-Maker.
Joseph Leo, a cigar-maker ol 936 Harrison
Btreet, has fallen into the hands of the revenue
officials. He was nrrested yesterday on a
charge of having put 250 cigars in a box that
had been used for clears before. The United
States District Attorney and United States
Commissioner Heacock agreed to let him go if
he would promise not to repeat the offense,
but to 'heir surprise he refusefl to give the re
quired promise. He sild that the box jras his
property and that he had a right to do what
ho pleased with it. He was accordingly held
for trial with bail fixed at $250.

this City, a stranger among ntrangers, and
that be was cick and in need, beinjj with
out means. He made this fact known,

ing, but unfortunate. The delegates at

in the afternoon was handed to the un
fortunate knight to relieve his immediate
wants. ''You can go to your landlord,
who threatened to eject you," said the
knight who handed him the contribution,
"and let him see what the Maccabees do
when one of their brothers is in nee I, and
ask him what tie thinks of them."

There may be some significance in the
fact that the Czar of Russia is the head of
the Greek church, and that all the bishops
and archbishops of that church are ap
pointed by him. Hence, if they offer up
prayers for the Greek cause it may be in
ferrea that the Czar must have a friendly

C. Demetrak, president of the Greek
Hellenic Society, is exerting himself on

Call reporter la^t ni,:ht that the action
of the Christian powers against the Chris
lien Greeks and Cretans in favor of the

tory, and tha.t for thÂ» sake of civilization
be hopes that it will not be continued or
repeated.
"The plea made by the powers that they
desire to prevent a European war," con
tinued Mr. Demetrak, 'is a very flimsy
one. Greece and the Cretans hay*Â» time
and again informed them that they will
never stop fighting Turkey until they gain
their independence. The Greeks are tired
of the empty promises of the power*, and
have ranged themselves along the line of
public opinion and what they conceive to
be their rights.
"Tne powers say that they want peace.
Why do they want peace? In order that
the Turks may be allowed to massacre
Christians every day? No; we despise
peace obtained at such a fearful and im
moral cost.
"I wish America were nearer Greece at
the present time, for I am sure that the
generous soul of the people of the United
States. sympathizes witt; my countrymen
in this the hour of tlieir distress, and that
they al! hope that the day is near at hand
when the Christian Cretans shall be freed
from the dominion of the barbarous
Turk."
ANGLERS ARE FOOLED.
The Late Storm Has -polled the Sport
of the First I>Â»v oi tho
Season.
The anglers were busy yesterday pur
chasing tackle at tbe leading sporting
goods houses of this City, so as to be out
bright and early this morning to whip
their favorite irout stream". For many
years past the first day in April has boen
welcomed by the lovers of angling, as on
that day tne trout-ristiing season opens.
Unfortunately the late ruins have spoiled
the sport, which promised to be first class
on the inaugural day of the season, and
reports whicu reached this City yesteraey
from various parts of the country state
that the creeksare too high and muddy to
insure anglers anything like a good day's
outing and a full basket.
When tiie weather clears and the water
becomes clear there m v be some good
fishing in the maiu stream?, but anglers
who have had many years' experience in
trout-catching contend that tbe recent
freshen have washed down numbers of
trout to the ocean and mat the season
will not come up to expectations.
Wnile the water is high the best sport
wi>l be had by fishing me tributaries to
the main streams, and it can be safely
paid tbat the "barnyard hackle," which is
the common ground worm, will be the
most acceptable bait that a-igler i can of
fer the denizens of be streams white the
water is in n troubled state.
Notwithstanding the unfavorable con
ditions, there are m*ny followers of old
Walton who will take pot luck mil, ruin
or shine, they expect to return with some
fish if they have to bur them. The best
streams nearest of access are in Mann,
Sonoma and San Matoo counties.

ONLY ANOTHER
EXAMINER STORY
Chief Crowley Did Not Re
sign Nor Will He for
a While.
Police Commissioners Meet, but
Do Not Take Up the
Matter.
Captain Lees Anxoui to Gun the
Presmt Chief's Placeâ Bohen's
Cbanc-s
The Impending retirement of Chief of
Police Patrick Cr >wley has again come up
as a topic of interest in police circles
The oid Chief has been anxious to throw
off his uniform and retire into private life,
and he only refrained front doing so last
year because the law at that time required
a continuous service of twenty years to
entitle him to a pension.
The recent Legislature passed a bill,
which was sigued by the Governor, creat
ing a Board of Police Pension Commis
sioners, and the three existing Police
Commissioners were appointed to con
sider pension matters. The bill also stip
ulates that twenty years in tbe aggregate
instead of Consecutive service entitle an
officer to a pension of one-half the salary
of his particular rank.
This bill was introduced more particu
larly to meet the case of Chief Crowley,
who in two terms has served this City in
an official capacity for more than twenty
throe year*. He therefore proposes to re
sign his office at the earliest possible op
portunity, just as he proposed to do
twelve months ago.
There is one contingency, however,
which cuts quite a figure in the Chief's re
tirement. His long-lile friend. Judge
Tobin, who is one of the Police Commis
sioners, and likewise one of the pension
commission, hopes to make him a di
rector of the Hibernia Bank. This has
been on the tapis for a long while, b t the
meeting of the bank ppople to decide upon
this new move is to be held in the remote
future, and not until then will Chief
Crowley present his resignation.
One of the features in connection with
tho former Li I has been weighed with
care, and is a stumbling block in toe way
of Chief Crowiey's action in tbe matter of
resigning. This feature is the action
taken against thn legality of ttie raise of
salary. The matter will Le heard before
Judge Seawell to-morrow, and if the bill
is decided to be constitutional there will bo
nothing in the way of the Chief present
ing his resignation, excepting that the
Hibernia Bank directorship will 9 tilt bto
too far in the prospective..
The probable accessor to Chief Crowley
is Captain LeeÂ«, Captain Wittman being a
close second in the choice. The veteran
detective is very anxious for the place,
and he does not look with pleasure at the
close run Wittman, witn scarcely a decade
of service. is giving him.
Chief Crowley was considerably annoyed
at the publication of the story mat be had
tendered his resignation, which he char
acterized as absolutely false.
"Every one knows," he said, "that I
have been desirous of retiring from active
service since I tendered my resignation
about a year ago, after the death of my
son.
"After the amendment to the pension
bill, which permitted me to retire at any
time, wÂ«s signed by the Governor, I told
The Call that I would not retire just at
present as there was a certain contingency
in the way, but as soon as that contin
gency was removed I would probably ask
to be placed on the pension list.
"The publication of my retirement to
night i 3 altogether premature, as I am
not yet in t. position to do so. It is no
true that my resignation is in the hands
of the Commissioners, but I may as well
state that it is not now necensury for any
one qualified to be placer! on the pension
list to tender his resignation, as the
amended act provides that the Commis
sioners may, if they see fit, retire any
one without calling for his resignation.
"The regular quarterly meeting of the
Pension Commissioners takes place on
Monday next; but, of course, they can at
any time meet and transact business.
They may do so to-night; but I know
they will not do anything looking to my
retirement unless with my full consent
and approval.
"I havo a business proposition under
consideration, and if it should be settled
to-nignt there is nothing to prevent me
from retiring. If it should not be settled
to-night, as I have no expectation that it
will, then I will wait till the proper time
arrives. That may not be for some weeks
yet.
"My daughters have been pressing me
to retire for a long time, and if I had ac
ceded to their wishes I would have done
so as noon as the amendment to the pen
sion b'Al was passed. I want rest, as lam
60 years oKI now. and after my long years
of service I think lam entitled to it. But
I am not going to Ho anything definite
until I can see my way clear.
"You may rest assured that the Com
missioners will do nothing to force me to
retire, but, on the contrary, I think they
would rather that I should remain.
"My successor has been talked of, and
Captain Lees will be the man. He is en
titled to the position from his long years
of faithful and efficient service. It was
not intended to mane that public until it
had been consummated, but there has
been a leak somewhere. It was only
known to myself, the three Commissioners
and Captain L?es, although ex-Judge
Louderback hin. an inklinc of it."
Ben Bohen, with a score of years' service
as a detective, a most popuiar man, has
been mentioned aÂ« Lees' successor. In
â¢peaking of the affair yesterday Bohen
said :
"AH this talk of Chief Crowley's resic
nation, Lees' promotion and my good
fortune comas on me suddenly. I don't
know anvtbing about it. Of course, if
Captain Lees goes out I hope to take his
place. I am proud to think tbat my
name comes up in this connection."
THE POLICE TRIBUNAL.
Trial of the Men Found in a Saloon
on Bush and Montgomery
Streets.
The Police Commissioners at their
meeting last night did not have tbe resig
nation of Chief Crowley before them, nor
did they form themselves into a meeting
of tbe Pension Commissioners.
The only effect of the prognostication
of a morning paper was to disorganize
and disquiet the department for some
hours.
Policemen John Rainsbury, Albert E.
Holmes, Dennis J. Daley, Thomas It.
Lingford and William H. Harrison were
tried for being in a saloon on Bush street
while on duty.
Rainsburv, Holmes and Daley were
each fined $100; the oase against Harrison
(rat di-nii-s^d, as there was no proof

A Kentucky editor has a friend who talks to him in this way : " I attrib-
ute all the disorders of the system to the stomach ; when ' the stomach is all
â  right, we are well and happy. For a long time I suffered from the worst form
of habitual constipation. Sleeplessness and nervousness set in, and at times I
was so melancholy and out of sorts that life was a burden. An advertisement
, in our local paper induced me to give i
RIP-ANS TABILES
a trial, and they have completely cured me. I can say for Ripans Tabules,
they are, in my opinion, the best medicine for constipation on earth. They
accomplished for me what all other remedies failed to do. lam all right now
âsleep well and life is worth living. I believe the Tabules put my stomach
' in shape, and the i stomach did the rest. My general health is better than it
- â¢was for years previous."

together to put an end to the sale of
adulterated food products in any portion
of California.
The first two months of the present year
are said to have been more disastrous to
marine insurance men than any similar
period in twenty years. It is estimated
that British companies alone have lost
orer two million sterling on shipwrecks
during January and February. Whi.e it
promises tobua year of piosperity to land
industries it has opened very gloomily
for those of the deep sea.
An Ohio factory is said to have received
orders from England for 42,000 pairs of
shoes, and of course the free-traders will
quote it as a proof tnat protection to the
shoe industry is not necessary. The peo
ple will remember, however, it took many
years of protection to build up our big
shoe factories in opposition to the cheap
labor of England, and they will not be
inclined to tear it down now that we are
about to beat the British in their own
market.
A striking illustration of the advan
tages of a protective tariff was re
cently given by Dalzell of Pennsyl
vania by contrasting the conditions
of life for workin-.Ttien in Sheffield and
Pittsburg â two cities which are rivals in
many branches of industry. In the Eng
lish city there are penury, low wages,
ignorance and lack of culture, while in
the American city there are Iree schools,
high wagi's, independence and intelli
gence. If these conditions are to be
changed, said Dalzell, it should be by
bringing Sneliield up to the standard of
Pittsburg and not by bringing Pittsburg
down to the level of Sheffield.
ON TO VICTORY.
The Hou?e of Representatives has passed the Dincley tariff bill over which it has
been for two weeks fluttering on the wines of oratory. It utilized the very last minute
of its timeâ which was limited to the 31st of Marchâ as The Call predicted, but we
cannot bring ourselves to find fault now that the great object has been actually at
tained. There is much to be thanktul for in the circumstance that it passed even at
the last moment, instead of going over, until the regular meeting of Congress next
autumn.
Mark the difference between a Republican administration's manner of following
up its eiec:ion issues and pledges and that of m Democratic administration a* exem
plified in the one which rode into power on a high wave four years azo. Tlie wran
gling and dallying which ensued over the tariff after Cleveland stepped into office
sickened the whole country. The Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the
House and a comfortable majority in the Senate, yet after months of childish pulling
and hauling and filibustering they could only turn out a sicklj little bill which their
Presi ent was ashamed to sign! Nothing more absolutely ridiculous was ever heard
of in the legislative history of any country in the world.
Mr. McKinley came into office on the 4th of March. Within twenty-seven days
from that time a special session of Congress has been called, a great and complicated bill
vitally affecting the revenues and industries of the whole country has been drawn up
and concurred in by all the Republican members of the Houss, and that bill haa been
passed and aunt on to the Senate as a practical body of business men alone knew how
to do it. All this in less than a month, mind you â the fulfillment ot a Republican
promise that was not made simply for campa gn purposes.
Of course, the Republican Senators will maintain their party's repute and go sen
sibly to work as soon as the bill reaches them. There will be no wrangling amonc;
themselves and they will overcome the wranglings on the other side as speedily as
possible. There is a fair prospect that the bill will ro before President McKinley la
a very short time and that the loyal champion of protection, whose ringing truths
have thrilled the hearts of idle and hungry men for the past ten ye rs will at last have
the proud satisfaction of signing into the law of the land the measure which he has
battled for so long.
TRUTH ABOUT THE BOULEVARD.
It transpires from the report read before
the Boulevard Association at its meeting
Tuesday evening that the plan of building
a boulevard was under course of diligent
incubation long before the question of
relieving the "unemployed took its pres
ent taneidle shape. A jrood many people
have assumed that the boulevard was
planned simply to lurnish worfc for idle
men; that it was an expedient rather
than an intrinsically desirable undertak
ing. The fact is that the "unemployed"
have been chiefly a means to an end, their
advent upon the scene flavins been rather
a fortuitous coincidence than anything
else.
It may strike the enlightened reader
that this divests the act of bestowing
relief upon the needy of its romantic
philanthropy and charity. But this is far
from being the case. The generou3 people
who contributed to the fund out of which
the needy are paid did so entirely from
charitable motives. They were not the
ones that knew of the previous boulevard
plans. They simpiy gave relief to their
unfortunate brothers and thought no
further one way or the other about it.
But the fact that the boulevard was a
thing of previous inception and arrance
ment is none the less gratifying. It adds
value to the work. The committee af
firms that "the boulevard, when com
pleted to Ingieside, will form the mo-t
important public improvement which has
been accomplished in our City for many
years. Connecting with t>e park at one
end and at the other wi'h the Ocean
House road and ocean highway, it gives
opportunity for a splendid drive or bi
cycle tour of about fifteen miles through
the most picturesque part of the City and
County. And the new roadways that wili
presently follow this one, from the Ingle
side and in a northerly direction, will give
the City what it has hitherto lacked but
greatly needed â an agreeablo and direct
route to the southern boundary of the City
and into the body of our peninsula."
This manifestly adds to our satisfaction
of seeing ihe work go on. It ought to
stimulate us to redoubled efforts to swell
the lund. Five hundred men nre daily
drawing from it $1 10 apiece, and the com
mittee tells us that tde contributions do
not keep pace with these disbursements.
As thero are only sixty days required in
which to complete the work, the fund
ought easily to be made to meet the neces
sary demands, and we have no doubt that
when the liberal citizens fully compre
hend this roint they will tuke particular
care that it shall do so.'
GENERAL RIVERA'S PATE.
General Euiz Rivera may, in the soli
tude of his prison cell, view the taking of
him by the Spaniards as a mishap, the
avoidance of which would have precluded
much ultimate disadvantage to the cause
for which he has been plyins: the sword.
It is quite as probable that bis admiring
followers are also nurturing the same
gloomy conviction. Yet it may turn out
that the general's mistake in getting
caught will result in exactly the reverse of
what he apprehends.
To a mind at this distance from the af
fair it looks as though Mr. Rivera had
been selected as a shining mark for God
to love, attestation whereof is to be re
vealed in the eventual evolution of him
into a martyr whose personal misfortune
shall redound to the general eood.
In their first flush of exultation at the
novelty of having a gentleman close
enough for them to examine without fear
of getting kicked out of doors (doubtless
they had him chained), the Spanish high
waymen naturally conceived the amiable
notion of shooting him to see how he
would like that. The effect of torture
upon any live thing is an entrancing
study with the ordinary savage. And the
safety of getting so inconvenient a person
as General Rivra out of their way also
appealed to these savages of the Spanish
army, as did likewise the military distinc
tion of coart-manialing somebody, which,
of course, always fills with pride an army
that hasn't sense enough to feel the latent
gravity of a warrior's death.
Hence General Rivera's position is that
of a Cuban insurgent taken as a soldier of
war and threatened with execution by the
soldiers of the other side, who took him
prisoner. Of course his execution under
such circumstances would be unwarranta
ble and against all the conventions of
modern war as recognized by interna
tional agreement. Thi* p aces martyrdom
upon the helpless --risoner, and raises an
issue which may be turned to a salutary
advantage for the ca. se in whose interest
the martyrdom is suffered. Let the Span
ish cut-throats make a move to murder
General Rivera and the way is open ior
the United States to step in and, by pre
venting the outrage, raise the battle upon
a plane where Spain will have to be decent
or retire from the field. It is inconceiva
ble that this country could stand passively
by and Buffer any such cri me to be per
petrated, and to our way of thinking it
will only be necessary for the Spaniards
to attempt it in order to get themselves
jerked np faca to face with a few ship
loads of American sailors. One can fore
see in such an event a signal change in
the Cuban situation, with the advantage
all on the side of the insurgents.
The House laid aside discussion of
the tariff bill long enough to adopt a joint
resolution appropriating $250,000 for the
relief of the flooded tiiitricti of the Mis
sissippi, and or a time men of all parties

mon sentiment of charity and patriotic

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1897.
GOING INTO THE COUNTRY.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has become alarmed at the ten
dency of impure food to drift into the
interior of the State when routed out of
San Francisco. Canned adulterated meats
and fruits are, it is everred, surreptitiously
coming off the shelves hereabouts and go
ing forth into the country to try a change
of air.
That a change of air might do them
good the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association is not prepared te deny, but
that they will not do the air any good is a
conviction upon which every member of
the board is ready to take his stand and
tight to the bitter end. That is why a
Pure Food Congress is shortly to be held
in the Chamber of Commerce in this City,
wiih the members of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association as its prime
movers.
The purpose is to drive spuiious victuals
out of not only San Francisco, but the
wholo State. Possibly the reform may
not be extended to the hanging of every
scoundrel who has been adulterating food
in these regions, and that of course will be
regrettable, but there is hope that the
tainted food itself may be pursued and
exposed so persistently as to discourage
the villains from further criminality in
that direction. There are a few stages lefl
unrobbed. We suggest the ransacking of
them as a compromise between food cor
ruption and honest toil.
The congress is to be held on the 30th of
this month. Governor Budd will be asked
to name fifty delegates or representatives
from various parts of the State, and t.ie
Supervisors of each county will be
requested to select ten more from their
respective shires. Evidently the pro
jectors rely largely upon the size of the
gathering to impress the evil-doers- they
wish to have it virtually a universal pro
test, so general, so conclusive, so sweep
ing, that even a nature capable of adul
terating food may comprehend the verdict
and become afraid to continue his vile
offenses.
fORAKER PAVORS TRUSTS.
All of the railroad companies whose
i lines enter Chicago from the eastâ barring
the Chicago and Grand Trunk â have been
apprised that the Interstate Commerce
Commission in Washington has its eye
on them. They are calmly expected to
deliver up before April 10 all biils of lad
ing and "other evidences of shipment of
products" between the dates of April 1,
! 1896. and March 1, 1597; and also to at
tempt no funny business in the matter of
rates in the future.
The railroad officials, emerging from
the discomfiture into which these uncom
promising refreshments of the memory
must have sank them, lift up reproachful
voices to deprecate any intention to cheat
which t tie Commerce Commission might
have imputed to them, and are disposed
to regard the summons as a painlul reflec
tion upon their honor. But nothing iÂ«
'left for them to do but to put their feel
ings in their pockets and send the infor
mation which tne commission has de
manded; and the United Press corre
spondent ingenuously explains that "they
are afraid to be caught furnishing falsa
atatÂ»mÂ»ntQ " â 
The Supreme Court decision, as re
viewed in The Call a few clays ago, wa3
no dream. The raiiroad companies are
being startled into a vivid realization of
'hat every time they lapse in the faintest
degree into the old unconsciousness of tue
people's rights. Already the officials of
the big Western roads have practically
hidden a regretful farewell to the con
demned Western Freight Association.
The association will not be literally dis
solved, however, because the officers of
it hold contracts for their positions at
$10,000 a year each and ihe contracts will
not expire for nearly two years yet. The
holders of them will therefore be retained
in the employ of the various road < and
act as a bureau of information, furnishing
to each road monthly a statement of what
all the other roads have been doing. Thi*
ingenious plan wiil effectually discourage
rate-catting on the sly and may answer
one of the principal purposes of the
former combination. The Excellent cir
cumstance, however, that the roads will
all be jealous of one another and at
smothered warfare instead of dovetailed
in a cheerful clique to conctrtedly beat
everybody else will remain to solace the
pub.ic mind.
It is to be noted that Senator Foraker
has introduced a bill to license railroad
combinations, with a commission to look
after them and keep them from going
wrong. The "orders and hnd nes' of the
commission are to be accessible to any
United States Circuit Court for review,
and appeals to the Supreme Court will b>
provided for. The pdst of the bill seems
to be that Senator Foraker believes that
recognized agreements between a number
b! roads in the matter of preserving uni
form rates are desirable, if kept within
reasonable limits and subjected to gov
ernmental supervision. If the "govern
mental supervision" could, by some moral
miracle, be always depended upon to act
for the people instead of for the roadsâ or
rather to act as fainy for one as for the
otherâ this clan might do. Otherwise it
has a dubious look about it.
According to a correspondent of the

In Maine have become too poor to support
their municipal governments. Six towns

for the people of :he brave old State a
change is at hand.

THE ANTLIRUaT DECISION
This decision overrules the fajnous decision
of Justice Shiras approving and upholding
such combinations. It upsets the decisions of
Judges Lacombe and Wallace last Friday,
which held that tbe anti-trust laws did not
apply to railroads. It begins a new era in the
history of the relations of railways to tne peo
ple. It opens the way to a mortal blow at
those great trusts and monopolies such as the
Standard Oil Company, the Dressed Beef
Trust, the Grain Elevator Trust, that rob the
Deople and grow fat on extortion by means of
the railway associations. This decision de
clares that the men who form the three great
railway combinationsâ the Joint Traffic Asso
ciation, tho Western Freight Association and
the Southwestern Traffic Associationâ are law
breakers. It compels them as good citizens to
disband. It brands them criminals If they do
not disband. â New York V. orld.
The important point in the Supreme Court
decision in the case of the Trans-Missouri
Freight Association against the railroad* that
enter into a traffic agreement for controlling
transportation and maintaining rates in their
territory lies in its holding that the Hherman
anti-trust act of 181)0 applies to railroad cor
porations and their traffic agreements. This
was the very point upon which the appeal was
taken, the court below having held that the
act did not apply.â New York Times.
The fact that four out of the nine Judges
forming the court held with the courts bolow
that the provisions of the anti-trust law do
not apply to railroad transportation may en
courage the rai'uonds to seek a colorable
evasion of the law with the expectation that
on a rehearing of the matter in its new aspect
the decision may be reversed. It is not con
tempt of court to recall a somewhat recent in
stance of the second thought of the Supreme
Court differing radically from its first judg
ment, tut until that reconsideration has been
had railroad combinations to maintain rates
must bo ranked with other illegal trusts.â
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
The decision is to the effect that the defunct
Freight Association agreement to maintain
rates within a limited territory was in re
straint of trade and must be abandoned. As it
had already been abandoned, the decision, so
far as that particular association was con
cerned, was a shot fired into the air. Its ap
plication to any existing traffic or trust asso
ciation is yet to be shown. If it applies to all
associations ot this nature it is a very impor
tant decision. If it appiies only to one whose
agreement had not been drawn by a skillful
lawyjrit wlli prove ol email account.âPhila

does not boast an organist of Eddy's ability,
and the American's recital was quite an

Quite a stir has been made in the musical
world by nn interview with the celebrated Wag
nerian conductor, Felix Mottl, which was
published in Le Gaulois. Mottl was quoted
as saying that Weber misjudged Beethoven,
Rubinstein and Wagner, and that Wagner was
unjust to Brahms. The interview goes on to
say: "There is actually no musical move
ment in Germany at present, no young com
posers who promise anything â there is
nothing, nothing, nothiug, except complete
empUness. With one or two exceptions, such
as iiumperdinck, the composers of Germany
to-day are only mediocrities. It looks as If
the genius of Wagner, by its grandeur, dis
courages all other genius." When asked his
opinion about Trench music Mottl is quoted
as giving a very different opinion : ' 'In France
there is a real upward movement. I see the
beginning of a school which will make lis
way. As for Italian music, it Is ended as far
as Germany is coucerned. With the exception
of 'La Cavallcrla' and 'I Pagliacci' the Gorman
public won't listen to Italian operas." Natur
ally enough this interview crented a great
protest in Germany, whereupon Felix Mottl
came out in the Badische Presse and said;
"The statement that I said musical life is deu.fl
in Germany is entirely a dream of Le
Gaulois. 1 should have rendered myself torever
ridiculous by such a statement. I did remark
that in the field of lyric drama the French
have more facility than the Germans, who
still seem to be overshadowed by the genius
of Wagner." Mottl adds that every grand
effort in the artistic history of a country is
followed by a period of relative stagnation,
the best forces Lelng exhausted. He also says
that Humpcrdinck's "Hansel and Gretel" is
the best lyric work that Germany has pro
duced in recent years.
Operas based on Irish subjects seem to be
gaining in favor day by day, just as if com
posers were smitten with a sudden desire to
make np for the long neglect of tho rich field
for lyrio drama which lies in Irish legend and
Irish folksongs. The latest Ir.sh opera â
written by an English Hebrew, by the way, is
Isidore de Lara's "Moiena," of whose first pro
duction at Monte Carlo the critics speak in
terms of extravagant praise. Gallot, who
wrote the libretto, has placed his action in
Ireland at the end of the last century, just
when Lazare Heche essayed in vain to land
with a little French army to aid the uprising
of the Irish. The book is full of the vivid and
picturesque coloring which marks the works
of Merimee, who always reveled in popular
patriotism, and the whole story is clear,
simple and extiemely dramatic.
The first tableau is a talr sample of how
vivid the play of De Lara's new opera is.
Moiena, a young Irish girl, is betrothed to the
sailor Patrick, who returns home from sea to
take part ia the insurrection. Immediately
on his landing he and Moiena are married,
but Patrick is to leave her at the church door
to join the insurgents. While me ceremony
is going on the English soldiers arrive outside
the church looking for the rebel. Tho doors
are locked, but the Sheriff breaks them down.
At that instant the priest comes out, carrying
extreme unction to a dying man, and the
soldiers let him pass, followed by an assistant
bearing alighted candle. As they depart with
slow and measured steps the soldiers sud
denly suspect that the candle-bearer is Pat
rick, who canno. be found in the church.
"Fire," cries the Sheriff, but the English officer
iÂ§ a Catholic, and refuses to command his
soldiers to draw "aur le bon Uieu," so Patrick
escapes.
According to the French critics, De Lara has
struck a happy medium, la "Moiena," between
the old forms of opera and modern
lyric drama. There is none of the
old melodia assoluta; he has too much respect
for the action of the drama to indulge in that;
but at the same time he never sacrifices the
voice to the orchestra. In the old operas the
orchestra was the slave of the voice, and in
modern lyric drama there Is a tendency to go
to the other extreme and make the voice the
slave of the orchestra. De Lara is said to have
liberated both from bondage in "Moiena," for
the voices and the orcuestra naturally sustain
and help one another. He has made his
strings sing in a very broad stye, and has ob
tained especially beautiful effects from the
hambois and the English horn. If the first
night accounts are to be trusted, "Moiena" is
an epoch-making opera.
It seems as if the modern French composers
ezcell least of all in melodic invention. They
can write highly dramatic operas and paint
remarkable tone pictures for orchestral con
certs, but they do not seem able to hit upon
tunes which catch the public ear, the sort of
tunes in which Bizet, Gounod, Ambroise
Thomas and the other famous writers of their
day excelled. Theodore Dubois, for instance,
is one oi the most esteemed of modern French
writers, and he is Ambroise Thomas' successor
as director of the Paris Conservatory. This is
what Le Journal dcs Debate says about his
legendary poem, "Notre Dame de U Mer,"
which Lamoureuz has just produced: "The re
ligious and maritime tableaus, chorus of
sailors, religious procession for the benedic
tion of the sea, the lamentations of a mother,
awaiting the return of the fishermen, etc., are
unrolled to melodic motives that our ears have
heard a hundred times, whose end we know
from the beginning. The least grain of me
lodic originality would give us intense satis
faction."
The lasting success of "Carmen." based on
one of Merimee'<j stories, has tempted another
composer to follow Bizet's example and go to
Merimee for a plot. The new opera, "Ines
Mendo," has already been accepted for this
season at Coven t Garden. The composer's
name is Frederic d'Erlanger, but he has taken
the pseudonym of F. Regnal.
Arthur Coquard, the well-known French
composer, has chosen a very timely period
for the first production of his new "Oriental
Episode" and orchestral suite in three move
ments. The composer has utilized real Greek
themes, sung by the peasantry of the Hel
lenes. The "Greek Dance" is said to be as
strikingly charae'erif lie and racy of the soi.
as the Spanish, Polish or Bohemian types of
music with which we are so lamiliar, or the
Scandinavian music, with which Greig is
making us fiiinliiar.
The Parisian papers have been publishing
comforting little brevities, assuring triends
and relations oi the French opera company
at the California that there are neither dead
nor wounded in the troupe, as a consequence
of the derailment of the train that brought
the singers here.
Theodore Mabellini, an Italian, well known
as ihe composer of many operas, masses, etc.,
has just died in Florence. He was born in
1817, and for many years was maestro di
camara c di cappella to the court of the
Grand Duke of Tuscany.

Her dainty feet utep light y through
The mazPH of the mtnu- t :
And. oh! ii-.e sight of her sweet face
I think I never shall forget.
That qnaint old dance, the nir.lsh form,
Those petty, lUbilv tripping feet,
Those soft eyes and the waving hair,
I hey form a picture all complete.
Thp sunbeams through the casement peep;
Thc> golden network ol her hair
Imprisons them, and her bright eyes
seem to have caught the soarkles there!
The summer rlppii-s in her voice,
Her Â« y es are like the pans bloom,
The wild rose tint is in h*T cheek.
>he brightens up the dark o.d room.
The polished floor, the walls of oak,
'1 he tapestry upon the wall,
Form setting quaint for such a face, '
My love who fairest is of a I.
She'll dance through life's dull mazy paths
In just tne Â«elf-s.-me happy way.
Earth's sunshine is she, and â  od gr*nt
In her pure heart love reign* vi way.

IN TIME OF PEACE
A TOUCH OF WAR
Old Fort Wi>fi3ld Scotf
Will Be Besieged by
Friendly Foes.
Tactical Problems Which Make
the Point a Mimic Battle
-Field..
Yesterday's Muster and R view oa
the Big Presidio Parade
Grounds.
Old Fort \Vinfield Scott is to have its
day at last.
For nearly thirty years it has stood
silently and peacefully guarding the nar
row atrip of Water . that ebbs and flows
Dast it, waiting patiently for the time
I when it would be needed^ The rust has
formed around its iron portholes, the
spiders have spread their webs over the
sleeping muzzles of its guns, and, if per
chance its arches and galleries have re
verberated with the sound of its old
smoothbores, it has been but in courtesy
to some ship of the line that might some
day be its prey.
But the old fort is to have a chance at
last. This morning it will be invested
with a garrison of bluecoats, and later on
an enemy in brown will storm its walls,
and part of the action of a battle- Ibid will
be played under cover of its cannon. There
will be no powder burned and no hand-to
hand conflict", but at least the shadow of
war, if not part of its substance, will for a
time settle on the picturesque sentinel of
brick and stone. . .
The officers call it a tactical problem,
The Cavalry Troops Looked Best as They Swung Past the Reviewing Stand at Full Gallop.
and they p.nd the troops will solve it.
Commanders were hard at work all yester
day preparing for the solution, and a
number (if officers went out there in the
rain and wind to look over the ground
and prepare obstacles to the free passage
of the besieging troops. The time set is
this morning, provided the weather be
favorable.
The field of the problem wiil include the
entire point, with the fort as the objective
point. The troops at the Presidio, in
tu it try, artillery and cavalry, will be
divided into two bodies, one in the uni
form of bine and the other in their brown
working-clothe*. The creaking port
shutters of the old br:ck pile will be
thrown open; the black muzzles of the old
smoothbores wiil grin out through the
walls, and sentries will challenge from
rampart and sallyport. The men will be
maneuvered according to secret instruc
tions issued to commanders, but with
every one cisc in ignorance of the plan of
campak-Ji except through their orders, and
except that the old stronghold must be
va.iantly held or bravely taken, according
to what the senior.s have decided would
be 1-est for the ins ruction of lhe men.
The problem is one very similar to those
worked out on the hills back of the army
camp at Monterey last summer. Those
w*-re found so profitable nn instruction to
the troops that it is the desire of Colonel
tihafter, the post commander, to continue
hem at come. The besieging .of the
Peaceful old lort, whose garrison has been
for years a lighthouse-keeper and whose
portcullis has been but a sicn "No ad
mittance," will be the first of thesÃ home
;>roblems in the noDle art of war.

There was a review after the muster, in
which all the troops parsed in quick time,
then thecavalrv and light artillery passed
at a trot and then the cavalry came down

gallop.
After the review the infantry was mus
tered by Colonel Young:, the artillery by
Colonel Willistoa and the cavalry by
Captain Rogers.

dren in Distress.
The wife and friends of Thomas Craig,

THE HALL OP JUSTICE.
It la Being Built by Two Kodcarriers
nml Two Bricklayer*.
The joy which lightened Dunbar alley
and made the gloomy Morgue as cheerful
as a policeman on a pens on over the an-
nouncement that worlc on the new Hall of
Justice would be vigorously prosecuted
until the completion of the work nine
months hence was shaded by the fact that
only two hodcarrters and two or three
bricklayers were at work yesterday on the
edifice.
With this foiceas a starter, there is a
suspicion that this beautiful building will
be ready for business before the opening
of the Paris Exposition. Several 10 cents
a meal restaurant-keeperi in the vicinity
had gone to considerabis expense order
ing a barrel of whitewash to beautify
their places ot business and to shed light
on the path of the shyster, but when they
observed the indecent haste with whlci
the building is not being erected they re
scinded the order and hnve postponed
their whitewashing improvements for a
year.
It is a good thing, however, for the two
hodcarners, for their job will last them
or five years at * least; ditto the brick
layers.

There was talk at the meeting of the
Board of Education last eveniag of "nig
gers in the fence" and ether matters that
are suppo q ed to refer to queer practices,
and an acrimonious dialogue resulted.
The matter under discussion was the
matter of advertising for textbooks, an
effort being made by Director Derham to
have tbe matter referred to a committee.
Director Waller said that there were al-
ways some people looking for "a nigger
in the fence,." because they did not under
stand matters under discussion. He
stated that it was in order tp keen within
the law that the bids were necessary as
soon as possible.
Director Derh.im Mated that he did
think there was a nigger in the fence, but
he failed to specify where the individual
was located,* and the motion to refer to
the Classification Committee was adopted.

THE LADIES WERE
SAD AND GLOOMY
Backed Veragua and He
Was Lsft at the
Post.
Satsuma Took the Handicap at
Ingleside in a Fierce
Drive.
V: nkee Dooile Had No Speedâ Yemen's
Unruly Actions Caused Him
to Be Left.
"Oh my! wasn't it just awful; I'd like
to be a starter I" and all such expressions
could be heard in the grand stand at In
gieside yesterday.
It was "ladies day" and despite the
rain, the fair sex turnad out in liberal
numbers. The cause of these pet sayings
was a tip out on Veragua to win the hur
dle race tnat fairly permeated the atmos
phere. It seemed as though every woman
that entered through the turnstiles had
the jumper's name pinned in her hat.
The tip was too good; too hot; it got
scorched in the O7en. Veragua performed
a number of thrilling acrobatic gyrations
whtle the field was at the post, and witn a
look of contempt, turned and went the
other way when the barrier flew up. The
horse was a 2 to 1 choice and of course the
bookmakers felt very sorry at his ungen
tlemanly conduct. Money enough to buy
a thousand new spring bonnets was burnt
up, and Veragua will henceforth cease to
be a fireside companion.
Taken all in all tue favorites did not
Beem to enjoy the drizzling rain in tee
least, for but two landed purses. The de
feat of the others oould be ascribed to lack
of speed, except In the case of Yemen,
which was also left at the post.
By far the most inieresting event of the
d^y was the six-luriong handicap, taken
in a fierce drive by Satsuma, ably ridden
bj Charley Thorpe. Dunne's Preston,
carrying 110 pounds and Willie Martin,
carried all me Chicago coin and ruled- an
11 to 5 favorite in the betting. Insiallator,
with 105 pounds on his back, looked nicely
situated and his odds were forced down
from 6 to 4. Of the other starters Cash
Day and Sutsuma, boili at fives, attracted
the rnosi attention.
After considerable delay at the post the
bunch was dispatched to a lair start.
Greeu Morris' mare Bailie Clicquot was
possessed of all kinds of speed during the
early running, striking the stretch first,
but there having enough. Martin on
Preston then took command and it looked
easy for the brown sprinter. Suddenly
Installator, with whom Sloan had been in
a bad position, got through and soou had
Martin riding the favorite feet and hands.
The Brutus horse no sooner had the first
cho>C3 succumbed than he' in turn was
challenged by Thorpe on Satsuma and
beaten out a head. I'reston was a length
away. Down the back stretch the- winner,
whicn packed 100 pounds, was the tail
ender, looking hopelessly beaten, and his
unexpected win stamps him as a horse of
considerable quality.
Ed Purser's Yankee Doodle was sent to
the post a 7 to 10 favorite for the opening
mile run, but after half trie distance Had
been covered, was in difficulties, and
finished a poor third. The light weighted
Cappy, an 8 to 1 shot, made all the run
ning and at the end won all out, less than
a length ahead of Logan, the second
choice, in 1:43.
The seven furlong selling that followed
nearly resulted in a victory for the 30 to 1
outsider, Schnitz. Sander's chestnut led
the field to the paddock, where Marjorie,
backed down from threes to 8 to 5 favorit
ism,- overhauled and beat him out with
ease. Miss Kuth came very fast at the
end, securing third place.
A bundle of coin was burnt up over the
result of the mile and a quarter Lurdl*
ovent. Veragua was played for a good
thing at odds of 2 to 1, but balked when
the barrier flew up and was left at tÂ»ie post.
After being prominent throughout the
running Candor, the second choice, drew

NOTKS.
Starter Dick Havey is popular with the
jockeys riding here. This fact was demon
strated yesterday. Previous to the Open
ing race yesterday Air. Havey was pre
sented with an elegant gold repeating
chronometer, suitably inscribed, paid for
by subscriptions made by the different
knights of the pigskin. The good-natured
starter was much surprised at the gift and
for some minutes could not find words to
express his thanks.
Yankee Doodle looked too high in flesh

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APftlL 1, 1897.
EATON WON
THE BIG RACE
The "Indoor King" Defeated
Wells, Becker and
Loughead.
"Bob" Terrill Won a Special
Professional Match From a
Good Field.
O. L. Stevens of lowa Lowsred the
World's Half-Mile Record to
54 1-5 Seconds.
The Pavilion bicycle races drew another
large crowd last night. There wera no
accidents to mar the sport, and the men
rode hard in every event, particularly
fast time marking the professional racing.
The event of the evenine was a one
mile match between F. J. Loughead, the
Canadian champion; C. B. Wells, the
crack of the Bay City Wheelmen; Jay
Eaton, the "indoor king," and W. E.
Becker, five-mile National champion.
The race was run in heals, the condi
tions being that a man must win two
heats to possess himself of the purse.
There was considerable betting on the
race, Loughead and Wells being the pub
lic favorites. Becker was said to be a little
back in his training, and Eaton has never
been right since he reached the coast.
The first heat was paced by Stevens.
Becker got away quickest and caught
him, with Wells, Lioughead and Eaton
following in that order. No attempt was
made to steal the pacemaker from Becker.
Stevens dropped out on the sixth lap, and
the sprint commenced. Wells graduaily
drew alongside of Becker and then passed
tiini. but on the bell lap Loughead forged
to the front and Eaton passed Becker, and
it was a three-man fight to the tape,
..oughead winning by a scant lead, Wells
econd, Eaton third. The time was re
narkably fast, 2:05 2-5.
Morris was put in to pace the second
teat, and again Becker was first to catch
lim, Loughead, Wells and Eaton fol:ow
ng. Beclter did not try to hold Morri-'
>ace, and the latter soon got some way
ihead of the bunch. The men, therefore,
rode unpaced for most of the distance.
Wells jumped to the front on the fifth
ap and Lougbead rode up alongside,
bus pocketinz Becker, who was trailing
A T eils. Eaton saw his opportunity and
started one of bis long sprint 9, gaining a
;ood lead before the others could get well
mder way. He led to the tape, and
Becker, getting out of the Wells- Loughead
pocket, ran fast into second place. Loug
jead was given third. The time was
slow, 2:211-5.
The excitement was running hich, when
the men came out for the third hsat.
Stevens was again the pacemaker, and
made it exceedingly faat. The order be
hind him was Loughead, Becker, Wells,
Eaton.
At the beginning of the sixth lap
Eaton started a long sprint for home.
Lougbqad challenged him, and they raced
side by side for a lap and a half, Becker
and Wells right behind them. Eaton hat
the inside, and gained a slight lead round
ing the last turn, vhich landed him win
ner by a lenetn. Loughead's sprint died
away, and Becker beat him out inches for
secund-place honors. Welis was surely off
in his form, for he could do no better
than last. The time for this hat was
2:06.
This gave the race to Eaton, he having
won two heats. And so at last the "in
door king" had redeemed himself for his
many failures to win during the tourna
ment, and had ridden up to Ins Eastern
reputation. He was roundly applauded
for his victory, which was a marked one,
defeating as he did three of the' greatest
professionals in the country.
A match race between W. A. Terrill, Ed
Allen, T. Sullivan and A. M. Boyden. one
mile, professional, furnished some good
sport. To win the Durse a man was re
quired to win two heat?.
Terrill "recounted-' lor the first heat by
a decisive victory over the others, Sulli
van running second.
Terrill had no trouble in placing the
second heat to his credit in 2:27 3 5, as be
clearly outclassed hia field. Sullivan was
second, Allen third.
There was an amateur race on the pro
gramme at one mile, with the usual
princely prize list of $15, $7 50 and |4 that
hie management offers to compete :or. It
was noticeable that none of the cracks
were entered, Kenna, Mott, Bacon, Russ,
Lacey and Wing preferring not to ride for
the trophies offeied.
The preliminary heats reduced the field
to Barley, Imperial Club, C. M. Smith and
Hammonds of San Jose, and Tan tan,
Olympic. Barley was leading when the
sprint came, but Hammonds nipped the
victory from him at the tape. Tantau ran
third.
O. L; Stevens, the lowr professional,
rode a half mile against time, paced by
Bovee and Morris, the crack Texas tan
dem team. They made it good and iast
for ''Steve," and he rode the half in 54 1-5
seconds, world's record time. The former
record was :58.
A mile handicap Japanese race, with
three starters, was one of the divertise
mentsof the evening and furnished a good
deal of amusement.
Following is the summary:

RECORDS DISAPPEARING.
Tax Collector Block Wants Bpolca lr.
His Office Repaired by the
Supervisors.
Tax Collector James N. Block has com
plained to the Supervisors that many of
th? tax-roll books are in an almost hope
les&ly dilapidated coadition, and has
a-ked that some provision be made to res
cue the valuable records from total de
struction while there is yet time. His let
ter is as follows:
To the Mimbcrs cf the Board of Supervisorsâ
Gentlemen: During my incumbency of this
office I have several times directed the atten
tion of the board to the dilapidated condition
of some of ihe tax-toll books. Jinny of them
*re in a hopeless condition now, Dut those yet
on the road to tatters may be saved by rebind
ing. A small appropriation annually will be
sufficient lor the purpose, and it is certainly
Important that the records should be pre
served. I beg respectfully to suggest that
your honorable body should investigate the
matter.
As tiie public ha* free access to the rolls It is
impossible for a Tax Collector to prevent the
rough handling and mutilation of the same by
careless or vicious persons, but ii authorize^)
by you to do so, I will put those which may
yet be saved in proper conaitiou, and to pre
serve the others intact during my term of
office. I think 1 shall at least have the honor
of head lir from you on this subject, a pleasure
that has been denlea me by all your predeces
sors. Very sincerely yours,
Jamks N. Block, Tax Collector.

POPOCATAPETL
A German Scientist's Ob
servations of a Live
Volcano.
Is the Highest in North Amer
ica, Yet Not So Di ficuit
as Orizaba
It Tcok Professor Stopel Thres Hours
to Go Four Hundred
Meters.
Professor R. Chevers Stopel of Hoidel
berg is here on his way to Japan to study
imports auci exports, and other matters
especially relating to political economy.
He will not leave, however, till April 20,
and meantime will visit Yosemite and
some other points of iuterest.
The professor has been lor some time in
Mexico, examining into the political and
scientific features of the country. While
there be ascended, after much difficulty,
Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatnpetl.
He had Indian guides, ropes and alpen
stocks, and reached the crests of these
enormous mountains after enduring a
great deal of fatigue, and, in the case of
Orizaba, considerable danger. He also
made scientific observations. as to their
heigl.t.
"I ascended Popocatapetl during the
middle of February," said the scientist,
"and I reached the top of Orizaba March
10. lam the first German in twenty-five
years who has climbed that mountain. I
found l. y accurate observation that Popo
ratapetl wns 18,333 feet nigh, and thus the
highest in North America, and that Ori
zaba was 17,828 feet high.
"Though Popocatapetl was higher I
found it easier to climb. It is a live vol
cano, but not actively emptying. It is,
however, sending up rifts and gusts of
smoke continually. It was a great ex
perience to go up there.
"But Orizaba was the most dangerous.
I went up on the south side and in this
way managed to keep entirely clear of ice
and snow till I reached the top. The
ascent for a part o' the way, however, was
extreinelv difficult. For the last 400
meters the Indians deserted me. Tney
said it was impossible to get ud. I offered
them more money, but could not move
th'-m. Then I pushed on alone. I had to
c'imbfor three hours before I could get
to the crest.
"It was almost straight up and down,
and stones were falling all the time, so as
to make the undertaking precarious. I
was creatly fatigued wnen I finally
rea-ched the summit. All I took, how
ever, wa3 a glass of champacne.
"Ky this trip i was abie to prove that
Orizaba, .though very lofty, is not quite sa
high as Popocatepetl, which towers to the
great altitude of 18,333 feet.
. "I have written a full account of my
scientific observations and forwarded it to
Germany."
Divorces Granted.
Divorces have been granted in the Snuerlor
Court as follows: Bessie Olsen from Peter 01

FOR EVERY BICYCLIST!
Champion Michael Advises Use of
Paine's Celery Compound,
James Michael is the champion long-
distance bicyclist of the world.
He recommends all wheelmen to take
Paine's celery compound.
His experience is that of thousands of
others. With the opening of the bicycle
season many a young person and hun-
dreds of older people who have deter-
mined to tatce up bicycling as a health-
giving exercise find themselves really
lacking the proper "snap" or stamina to
begin on. Their bodily condition pre-
vents so spirited an exercise. They would
lite to ride, but they are out of sorts, run
down by a winter of work or indoor life.
Many who are really sick, who* have suf-
fered from debility or wasting diseases
for a long time until they had begun to ,
think their troubles had become chronic,
as nothing gave them relief, would turn to
bicycling for relief. But this splendid
exercise, like any other, requires strength
to undertake. The blood is oui of order,
the nerves are deranged, and nature's
food for both is needed.
All such persons will find to their im-
mense joy that Paine's c3lery compound
taken now will make them well.
Paine's celery compound worKs wonders
in the spring. . If you have labored under
the load of repeated headaches, neuralgic
pains and days ot nervous debility, now is
your best time to get well.
Michael is to-day the most phenomenal
rider in professional rank?. As far back
as 1894 he was undisputed champion of
Great Britain, and in the following year
he went to France and scored 28 straight
wins against the picked riders of Europe.
He has defeated such farcous men as
Jacquelin, Gougoltz, Huret, Rivierre, Bon-

After the exertion of my record lides
while with the Morgan & Wright team in
the south lasi winter, during which 1 lost
somewhat in weigm on account of the un-
accustomed c'imate, I was advised to use
Paine's celery compound. I am pleased
to say that it gave such satisfaction that I
was impelled to use it again to brace up
from the effects of the two unusually
roucrh ocean trips that I have taken dur-
ing the past month. I believe that wheel-
men who have to undergo ii\o hardships
of "circuit chasing" will find Paine's cel-
ery compound of assistance in keeping up
their physical tone. Jimmy Michael.
Every one needs to take a spring remedy
to purify their blood, arouse the circula-
tion and counteract the debilitating effect
of months of confining work, worry and
excitement.
The more intelligent portion of every
community are the ones who best recom-
mend Paine's ceJery compouud. They
have looked into this great remedy, fol-
lowed its remarkable achievements in tba
case of friends, neighbors and relatives,
and know just what to expect from its
use as a nerve and brain strengthener and
restorer and an ideal invigorator for a
run-down system.

George W. Silver Says He
Has Discovered the
Incas' Mines.
FABULOUS WEALTH IN

Gold Nuggets to Be Picked Up
in the Andes as Thick
as Strawb2rries.
A FAT BANK BOOK NOW IN EVI
DENCE.
Ruins of an Ancient Cityâ Pj ospects
That Hydraulic Mining Wi 1
Be Tried.
George W. Silver arrived in San Fran
cisco on the last steamer from Panama.
He says he has found a territory amidst
the Andes of South America where, figur
atively speaking, cold nuggets are as
plentiful as strawberries on a hillside, and
he believe? he has discovered the locality
of the fabulously rich mines cf the ancient
lncaa. Mr. Silver has been shipping gold
by every steamer for-ncariy a year through
AY ells, Fargo & Co., tlie express company
delivering it at the Mint, where it was
coined into glitterine twenties and depos
ited in bank here to bis credit. He has bank
books and other data to corroborate one of
the rncst interesting and prutitab.e ex
periences that a gold-hunter ever had.
Though he has been in South America
only a year on his last trip, the bank-books
in his possession show he has a deposit of
$25,000 to his order.
Mr. Silver formerly resided in Oafciand.
He has a son 11 years old in school there
now. His wife is dead, and his only
other living relatives are two brothers, who
are well-to-do business meu of Bosion-
Mass.
"1 found this gold," said Mr. Silvnr yes
terday, "with a cum nnuii rocker in "me
bed of a stream. The natives with a pan
collect from fl to $10 per day, according
to ibe decree of industry with which they
work. Like most Indians they are indo
lent, though friendly in this instance, and
will work only a day at a time. It is eas
ier to sit around iv the sun and watch
iheir crops grow.
"Nearly every country in South America
is rich in gold. I speht two years goinj;
over the country searching for the richest
spot, and I think I have found it. The
place is in the province of Pat^z, in Pern.
Fatal is on the east side of the river
yi ar.inon, o r main Amazon, about ' 4Â«)
mi.es from the coa.Â«t. It taues about n>o
weeks to get in there by mule or .burro
:ifter leaving the Mei.-gs railroad. My
companion and mypelt Jbought a 'tajo'
from an Indian for $60. There were no
j articular boundaries to our claim on the
east side and up ihe stream of the little
r.ver Ca^os, which emptie> into the Mara
non. 'NY c had the privilege of working as
far as we pleased. YVe louiid fine gold all
v.rough :hj bank, and on the bedrock
< b::uned as high as $5 25 to the pan of
c jarse gold. The deplb of the gravel was
lrom 50 to 100 feet. This was our start.
Our claims above subsequently gave big
jrospectsâ as much as ft to the pan. I
informed by reliable natives thai
T-ieces of gold weighing as high as twenty
seven pounds had been found in that vi
cinity. You can see tiiat this ground
wouid be immensely profitable witli tiy
draulic mining and macninery.
"Tue gravel benches run for miles along
tne streams and nave never been pros
pected. Tliey all carry a heavy deposit of
Ko;d. Our toxeswere at first robbed of
most oi 'he coarse gold which they con
tained. YVe did not lind this out for some
time. YVe received positive proof that our
confidential and trusted peon sold one
piece of gold for $32 which he had stolen
from our boxes during the night. YVe
lived about a quarter of a mile away from
our works arm could not watch them at
night. YVe moved down to the works.
The lower class of the biacks will steal,
though generally on a HinaiJ scale, unless
watched.
"After quitting work on our 'tajo,' "
he continued, "we prospected near ihe
summit of the rasi^e, to the eastward of
Chacncocbe, on the top and down the
sides of a big, round mountain, for some
ihing like 1000 feet.
"We lound gold everywhere over the
surface. This mountain is called Ka
erajcia. There is a layer of gravel un
wash:-d, or a debris with v.ash gravel, from
ten to sixteen feet dee].. From a pan
taken anywhere could be obtained from
60 to 100 colors anu surrn.- pieces quite
coarse. This is about ten lenuues irora
where we worked our claim. Tdis moun
tain is r>ddied with old mines, like an ant
uill, which were .worked by the Indians
before the Spanish took possession o' the
country more than 300 years ago, Tradi
tion says they were immensely rich in
goid. Probably most of this â  miuense
layer on the mountain is tne Waste and
tailings of the working of these mines.
Water can be brought on to this mountain
from tne beads of small &troams. The
yield of gold would be exceedingly great.
I never saw quicksilver used in the coim
try, and much tine cohi is necessarily lost.

SAN JOSE AND NAPA SAY "NOT NOW."
Executive Heads Believe a .New State Constitution Is .Not Yet
Required.
San Jose, Cal., March 25. 1897.
Editor Call: Responding to your request for my views as to the advisability of
calling a constitutionai convention, I will state that I Have read with much interest
The Call's account of the passage of the legislative resolution. Ordinarily I would
advocate the adoption of the very radical measure suggested by the resolution in order
to correct the many ill feature? of our present constitution. At this time, however, i
am constrained to oppose tiit* movement. I oppose ie because of the great expense
involved; because, too, ti:e people of California have just passed through a great
financial crisis, brought about, perhaps, by poorly considered legislation, and the
hour is 111-timed for tLe making of further legislative experiments. .Besides this we
have witli us still tbe memories, if not all the evil results, of the change of 1879. The
people remember the agitation thnt practically stagnated the bnsint-as community â
they recall the bitterness of feeling and the antagonism of claÂ«Â«s against class engen
dered, and, In my jr.dsrnent, stormy days cf that kind are wisely avoided.
. Then, too, as 1 understand the present organic law, a provision exists for sub
mitting any proposed amendments to the people whenever expediency may suggest.
VALENTINE KOCH, Mayor of San Jost.
i With this power la the hands of the pubiic it would seem unnecessary to delegate it
I to conventional representatives.
The recent election demonstrated the fact that the California p-nblic watch closely
and vote Intelligently upon proposed constitutional ciianges, aud with tne ballot
remedy thus at hand why assume the risk of agnui disturbing the business world?
All organic changes in laws necessarily create internal upheavals, and that this is
particularlj- true in â¢California is evidenced by the evil effects following the adoption
of our preseut law. Many of these have passeJ away. The people have grown accus
tomed to the methods of taxation, and business men generally have been guided by
I the law as it now standr.
Tne principal contention, as I understand, in favor of the change is that larger
and broader powers should be given to municipalities 1 . Conceding this, would it not
j be better ihat tUe municipal authorities secure '.heir own law at ther own expense?
j If San Francisco wants greater protection or superior facilities the legislative road is
open and her charter may be renewed or remodeled without burden tig the entire
j State with ttie enormous expense attendant upon a general convention.
Then, too, it is contended ih:it the present constitution forced capital from
California. Conceding this, also, have we any assurance that a change will bring
capital back?
If we consider the fact that to-day money is more remunerative in California than
in any Eastern State, that it produces Jar.-er and quieter returns, it may well be
doubted that a ciiange would bring to the State tne taw notables who took their gold
away.
Of course 1 know that much of the capital taken from California is now employed
in manuiacturine enterprises on tne Kastvrn seaboard for the very obvious reason that
in many States, especially tnose of New England manufacturing plants are exempt
from taxation, eitiier entirely or for a term of years. We of Calilornia can by our
votes do the same thin?, and thus encourage both labor and capital.
â For the reasons I have here brieriy indicated, my judgment is ngninst the
resolution. Yours very truly, V. KOCH, Mayor of the City of San Jose.
jillo buy gold annuaiiy to the amount of
$50,000 from the natives. 1 beiieve hrm!y
that one good hydraulic In operation
would Â°take- out more gold in one week
than is now taken out of the province in
one year by the present primitive methods
of mining.
"1 have ordered in San Francisco two
hydraulic machines," said Mr. Silver,
"and hiii having them constructed so tfiat
1 can take thorn into the country in pieces
by pack-tr.un. I have grams and con
cessions from the Government sufficient
to keep me working for the remainder of
my natural life, so that I am willing that
the world should know of this rich gold
bearing district. There are millions and
millions of easily mined gold there. 1
believe it is the richest spot in the world.
I do not want mooey from anybody, and
I have nothing to sell. I expect to return
to Peru in four or six weeks, oj as soon as
I can yet things ready. I expect to have
all the gold I want in two. or three years."
As to the ruins of the incas Mr. Silver
said: "On a tableland in the locality I
have been telling you about are some
ancient ruins covering ten miles square.
Tradition says they were the bite of a
great city of tne ancient Incas. Two stone
columns still standing are fully eighty
feet high. They appear to be the front
pillars of a temnle. John \V. Palmer of
Ogdenst/ur.!.', N. V., who went into the
country with me from the coast, made the
trip for the purpose of pxploring these
ruins, .lie took out $170,000 worth oi
ancient solid gold, silver and copper
plate and altar ornaments. The vas^s, In
fact all the relics, were richly carved and
very beautiful. He left me at Pimama
and went across the isthmus to take the
steamer tor Now York. He is going to
return to the ruins and resume excavation
on a larser scale. He will join me in San
Fr anci-co.
"History says the ancient Incas before
the Spanish conquest of Peru were the
highest and purest race of peopl? the
world has ever known. It.is a matter of
history. I believe that Piznrro took eight
shipload* of Rold in money and orna
ments, $800,000,000 worth of which came
out oi the ureat temple of Cuzco. He took
the old Inca king prisoner, you know,
and demanded a random of -$2,000,000.
The king sent his subjects up into the
mountains and in three days ihey brought
back that amount of gold. Pizarro then
demanded of the kii;g to reveal the place
where the gold came from. The king re
fused and wa3 put to death. Those an
cient mines are still undiscovered. They
were hidden by the faithful Incas. but re
main hidden to this day. Traces of an
cient highways may still be been ruir.iinir
along and over the mountains. I believe
that thos.e ancient mines are In P.itaz or
vicinity. Somebody w.ll find them some
day. May be Palmer will."

poetry. H** put in his nights in the wil

:;:i I lioney-uncKera yesterday that the
crusade of the board against impure food

made serious inroad* on the business of a
number of lar^e firms.
The trouble seems to be that in its
zealous efforts to enforce the isw the
board has failed to sufficiently dis
tinguish batween metnods of adulterating
fruit products that aredangerous to health
and those that me not.
The word "adulterated" strikes terror
into the heart of the consumer, end in
nine cases out of ten tne inference is
drawn that the goods are dangerous to
health. The board found many Eastern
products that contained acids and dyes
that were dangerous, while the larger
number of California fruits classed as
adulterated were mereiy called so because
the products of two fruits were mixed,
though the mixture might hav<Â» been per
fectly termless, and as little liable to in
jure health as the product of a single fruit.
The news has gone forth to the world,
however, that California fruits have been
found to be largely adulterated, and the

been felt to such an extent that several
canneries are threatening to go out of ex

Napa City, March 29, 1897.
Editor Call: Not being a jurist I have given but little attention to the matter of
calling a convention for the purpose of framing a new constitution beyond voicing a
casual opinion, such as may be evoked when any important subject diverts the atten
tion of the public mind.
Claiming it as our indefeasible right to convene for the communication of thought
and the formation of opinions in order to approach the defects of our present consti
tution let us ask whether it would be a wise and judicious step to tate inVioh a sea
son of depression p.s now confronts us, and whether it would not bo a. measure that
would be pronounced as being wholly a speculative and expensive experiment during
tl.ese hard times of tramps, trusts and depleted treasuries, and at its long-continued
session la the end produce a no less defective and ano more complete instrument
than the one now in existence. We remember that an appropriation was allowed lor the
last convention fora payment of 100 days' service, out the time required to perform
such service lasted 153 days, thus exceeding the time and the payment allowed,
and to this day there is owing to that delegation some $700 or $800 each, and even the
J. A. FULLER, Mayor of Napa.
I full payment for the" allotted 100 days is yet due to its members. The welfare of our
.State, we a Unit, is the vital principle of our political existence; without it we are
dead, or live only to servitude; yet it is impossible not to revert to the situation of tlie
times.
For a long period after the ratification of the present constitution our laws censed
to harmonize, which many <>f o\ir citizens can testify to by the ruinous litigation
that followed in and Feieral courts, and whicu has become an object lesson
the public have to fear: that a^ain their cause may be of doubtful merit and disas
trous issue tliat rights which they considered as d- lined by the wisdom and con
tirmed by tue authority ol nritten Uw nxay turn out 10 be no nioreJhan ideal claims,
without cither precision or security; tliat acts of parliamentary lore themselves are
no more than embryos of legislation, or at b^st but Infants, whose tirst labors shou d
not be to teach, but to learn ; and which, even fefter twenty years of pupilaee, may
require twenty more to periect a guardianship. Again, admitting that our present
bulwark may be cwlicient in some respectsâ and what constitution is perfect? â yet we
must admit that under its guidance our Stute has prospered, and during its existence
our industrial development forms a verdict for its approval.
Then what is the necessity to induce us to call this convention, to acquiesce in a
measure fraught with doubt, if not dancer? Are we not enjoying a a.ate bordering
on luxury and general satisfaction that are ever the traces by wbico good are ever to be
distinguished Irora bad governments, ana which is always to be fo-ind where a gov
ernment is moderate and mild and just to its people? I consider that the adding of a

nre. J. A. FULLER, Mayor of the City of Napa.
fore they bad been warned that they were 1
selling adulterated goods. They had no {
means of telling when. or t Â«â  goods were
pure or not, and bought on the statement
of producers that the hints were all right,
lie argued that the manufacturer should
be prosecuted instead of the retailer and
that the board should not inÂ«ist on the
prosecution of those already arrested, but
allow their cases to be postponed until the
matter could be amicably arranged.
John Nobbnsan, secretary of %he Retail
Grocers' Association, siated that the asso
ciation members were in favor of the laws
us they stand, but object to tue manner of
their enforcement. He stated that grocers 1
could not analyze goods sold them, and
charged thai in one instance, whero ar
ticles had ueen sent by a grocer to the
bo.-ird, analysis had bteo refused.
Dr. Morse denied that tile, charge was
true, and Mr. Xobbman withdrew it, say
ing that he did not send the goods him
self, but had been told on cood authority
that they had been sent.
phiiip'D. Code, of Code, Elfelt &. Co.,
voiced the sentiments 0/ the canuera of
this City.
He stated lhat for the past two years
.the market had lu>.-:i fioo:led with adul
terated Eastern jellies and other lruit
product*, and that California canneries
had been compelled to compete with them
in order to keep in businesi by lowering
the standard of California fruits. This
was done not by adulterating iv the gen
erally accf-pted sense of thÂ» term, but by
mixing jenies of fruits that could be
bought cheaply witn those that were
dearer.
For Instance, by mixing currant and
apple jelly, a jelly couid be produced that
was practically as pure as tha: of the cur
rants alone, and tue price mould be much
lower. In the ense of orange jelly, which
was demanded by the public, it was abso
lutely necessary to use apple juice to pro
duce it, as the juice of the oranire docs noi
jelly at all,
.Since the crusade of the bonrd had been
begun the trade with Colorado, Montana
and other Western States had fallen off
[*0 per cent because the impression had
gained gropnd that California fruits
were adulterated the same as Eastern
products. The former customers of Cali
fornia houses haa slopped buying here
because they made up their rdinds that
they micht us well buy adulterated East
ern goods as those from California, inas
much as they were cheaper.
Mr. Code thought that the laws would
eventuilly redound to the benefit of
California producers if they were justly en
forced, and care taken noi to let the im
pression get abroad that the goods con
tained deleterious substances.
William Oiine, one of the grocers ar
rested and convicted of selling adulter
ated goo is, said that lie bad been done a
grave, injustice. He had been arrested for
selling goods tha; be thought to be per
fectly pure, and through the publicity
given the matter had lost 50 per cent oi
his business. He thought that the manu
facturers viso produced tho goods or the
jobbers who sold them shonid be prose
cuted instead of the retailer, who could
not i.ell when he bought mkl sold adulter
ated goods.
On motion of D-. Morse, Mayor Pheian,
who presided, appointed a committee
consisting of Dr. Morse and Dr. WilHum
>on to consider ihe matters presented and
formulate some plan of action.

NEW YORK. N. V., March 31.âThe recovery
In the stock market which set in yesterday on the
Introduction of the railway pooling bill in the
Senate ma :e farther progress with- early trading
to-day. The general Us: improved y 8 to % per
cent, but shrewd traders concluded that tne rise
was being taken advantage of to market long
stock!!, and accordingly they soon chanced their
tactics. American Tobacco made an exceptional
â  advance of '_' J 4 per cent to 7414 on rumors that
the regular dividend would be declared. After
the directors adjourned it was announced that a
dividend of only 2 per cent had been declared on
the common, a reduction of 1 per cent on the
quarter.y payment on February 7. and the slock
reacted 2^. The bears in the meantime con
tinued tU-ir attacks on New Jersey Central and
succeeded 1 1 dislodging considerable long stock.
In addilioc to a revival of reports about the
probable reduction of the dividend It was stated
that some of the mines In the Wyoming (fa.)
District were flooded, xn<i tha: some of the anthra
-1 ite companies would suffer material loss. Jersey
Cential liiok 6 points to 77, and this led to a raid
on Delaware ami Hudson, which yielded readily
under the pressure, breaking from 106y a to 100%.
Lackawauna foil 31/4 to 15 "' ! and Reading^ to
20%- Ihe break In the coaler* was the signal
for a general selling moveti.ent, and the railway
arid industrial shares not previously mentioned
ylelde â  anywhere from Va to 2Vi per cent, suear,
the granges. Manhattan and Western Union
leading the downward movement, sugar was
weakened by the announcement from Albany
that the new Doscber refinery had been incor
porated under the title of the New York isugar
Kefliiin? Company. c
Thegrangeis were unfavorably Influenced by
advices from .Washington quoting . certain sen
ator!} a* authority tor the statement that no pool-
Ing- bill win be p*ssea at this session of Congress.
Although prices advanced Vk to 1 per ceut from
Ihe low-cut, in the final sacs. the tune of the mar
ket 'was weak. American spirits was noticeably
firm throughout the. day on the news that the
agreement between the American Spirits l:etiii:i:c
Company and the ontsl le distillers, which had
been uula consideration for several months, had
been arranged. Net changes -how declines of y 2
to 5 per cent. Jersey Central leading, 'lotal sales

COALâ A circular for Australia says: "Since the
beslnninc of February to date,, there have been
only live arrivals of Coal from Newcastle with
14,9141 tons; thit Is <an exceptionally small
amount. A few years ago this would have caused
a marked advance in 1 rices locally, whereas at
present no change is apparent, demonstrating thai
other sources of supply are ample for all our fuel
wants. Within the naxt 60 days only seven car
goes of Newcastle can possibly arrive here, with
about 18.0JU tons of Coal, hence this market will
1 be very bare of Australian' grades lir.o June next,
but the already engaged tonnage will keep us cop
, iously supplied about August - and September and
I fur several subsequent mouths. Ihe latest cabled
freight rates from (be Colonies are reported strong
lor early loading, but lower, for any loading after
July-August. This Is confirmed. Dy liberal offer
ings of second-grade steam. Coals delivered here
later In the year at reduced fissures. There has
been a freight decline of tuily 2s V ton this month'
from Swansea. All importers of foreign Coal are
very anxious as to the rates of Coal duly which
will be established by the present Congress; of
course the importers avoid all risks of an advance
of tariff as every Coal contract for future delivery
specifies that the consumers shall be liable for any
and every change." '.

A NOVEL DEFENSE
If They Pay Now for Budd's j
Band Wagon They
Would Be Felons.
An Appeal Has Been Taken and |
the Fees Run Up Near a
Thousand Dollars.
Twenty Eo lars Apiece Will Proba
b'.y Be the Demand, Where But
Four Was First Asked.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 31. f
Instead of Laving to pay four dollars
apiece the members of the Democratic
County Central Committee will probably
have to part with aa many times that
amount before they settle the bills for \
ihe band wagon and electric lighting
that helped to elect Governor Budd two
years ago.
For be it known to the world that those
plucky bandmen, who dared to play Dem
ocratic music in a Republican city, have. j
not vet received their free silver lor their j
heroic acts.
A bond on appeal has been filed in. ; the
Superior Court and the case is to : be tried
again. There are about a hundred de- !
fendants including the most prominent !
Democrats in the county, arid according
to Attorney McDonald they cannot now!
pay these bills without committing a j
felony. This is perhaps one of the most '
novel defenses ever put forward :n a court
of justice. -. .'â  ' â¢'â¢ '
"The thins is this way," said Mr. Mc-
Donald. "Under the i urity of .election
law money for campaign expenses must
be paid ia a certain manner and within a
certain time, and no candidate can spend
more than a limited amount. The time'
has long since passed when these bills:
should have been paid, and I fear that the
creditors stand a poor show, of getting
their money. >"ever'.heloss, I cannot but
admire the persistency of." Collector
Stewart, who has shown enough courage
to accept the assignment of these claims. '
He is, 1 believe, sending men all over the j
county serving subpenas, and demurrers,
ana summonses, and complaints, and in
some instances I believe it has taken $30 ;
to serve one paper. At this rate that un- ;
fortunate little bill of $240, which we were
kinÂ»ily iniormed a year ago could be )
liquidated ly paying $4 apiece, will soon !
amount to $1000. lfe*3BQS!
"It would be quite illegal to pay this
amount, for all our funds are derived from |
the assessments of candidates and those :
who are willing to help their election. To
assess any of these people now wonld be a !
violation of the law, and as good Demo- \
crats we cannot contemplate any such j
crime."
Collector Stewart has not lost heart and
declares he will get that money. During
the past two weeks Alfred Banteau, some- !
times known as the "baron," has been'
spending a small fortune of somebody's
! money chasing up delinquent Democrats. !
If, as Mr. McDonald say?, to pay the i
money would be to commit a crime it is 1
hardly likely that a Republican Judge â '
and .hey are ail Republicanâ will order j
an unfortunate Democrat to do any such
wicked thins.- . ... r -.. T
MISS MUEPHT'S WILL.
She "Wished Her Property to Go to Her
- Surviving Sisters.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â Victor
; Metua;f, attorney for Miss Isabel Murphy,
who died recently in London, has in his
â¢ possession what lie believes is the only
will of the deceased. He stated to-day,
that the will was made some time ago and
left with him. He does not believe she
made any other disposition of her prop
erty, and says that he will not allow the
contents of the will he holds to become
public until it is filed for probate. He
will await further advices from the dead
girl's sisters.
It is not likely Jbat there is anything
tensational in the late Mis Murphy's
will, for Mr. Melcalf, when told of the
dispatches from London yesterday, said
that he knew it/was Miss Murphy's desire
that uer property should go to her sister?.
It is presumed ttiat when making this re
mark the attorney was guided by a knowl
edge of the will in his safe.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â There is a
bitter war go ng on for the position of
Chief of the Fire Department. Chief
Fair, who realizes that he is to go, is being
opposed by Wiiliam Smith, foreman ot
chemical eneine 1, and the two men are
going around telling all sorts of petty

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1897.
GAVE HIS ESTATE
FOR AFFECTION
Thomas Moore Says He
Was the Dupe of a De
signing Wcman.
She Married Him, Was Di
vorced Soon Alter and Mir
ried Him Again.
Now She Seeks Another D.vorcj and
He Wants to Gst Back His
Property.
Oakland Office San Fp.ancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Murch 31. )
Another romance under the gaise of a
suit to recover property was tiled in the:
Superior Court this afternoon.
Thomas Moore, a San Francisco capital
ist who has been residing for some time
in Monterey, was three years ago a very
wealthy man. Now, judging from his
complaint, all he has on hand is a
wrecked physique and mind and a de
signing wife who has just sued him the
second time for a divorce.
Three years ago Mr. Moore, on
account of his mental condition, was ad
judged incompetent. During this period
be says that a designing woman, well
versed in all the arts and wiles that cause
a man to show his weakness, came across
his path. This woman wis Elizabeth
Howe, a married person of ISan Francisco.
When she knew that Moore had a large
estate she did not allow such a trifling
incumbrance as a husband to trouble her.
She quickiy procured a divorce and in
November, 1893, and on the same day !
that Moore was declared competent he
became the second husband of Mrs. Eliza
beth Howe Moore.
For a few months everything went
smoothly and one day Moore was sur
prised by b intr served w.th a complaint
for divorce brought by his wife, who
charged all manner of cruelty against
tiim. Little affairs, Fuch as attempting to \
choke her, throwing her out in the street !
and similar incidents, appear to have j
been of daily occurrence in the Moore
household.
li.mking he had the worst of the bar
gain Moore did not make much of a de
fense ana willing y consented to agree
that she should have the divorce and $600 â 
in cash in full payment of fee and all
claims.
After a little while Mrs. Howe Moore
became dissatisfied with her agreement, i
but it was too late to alter it. Moore had j
two or three spells of mental incompe- j
tency and passed a season at tne Napa j
asylum. Some time later he went to the i
Paraiso Hot Springs to benefit his health. <
While there bis ex-wife came to him, ap
peared very penitent, told him th:it their
match had been made in heaven and that '
no man should be permitted to br;alr it.
A:ter a few months of making violent;
love to the old plaintiff he finally gay* in j
and they were married a second time.
Again there were a few months of smooth ]
sailing, after which Mrs. Moore- left his â¢
home nnd re. used to return. A little later !
s c agreed to return and be a wife to him !
if he Tould tleed her eighty acres* of vaiu- ;
able land in Alameda County. The deed I
was drawn up, Moore signed it and it
went on record. About a week of (
so-called happiness followed, when Mrs. j
Moore again left her husband. At the \
end of a few weeks she promised she !
would faithfully resume her wifely duties
and be the truest of friends to Moore it he j
would aeed to her some valuable real i
estate in tlje city of Alarm da. Believing!
tliat shf bad repented and was truly con
verted from the error of her ways, Moore
signed the deed, which duly went on
record, and a few days later he was again
deserted.
Having some property still Jeft Mrs.
Moore again came back to her husband,
more penitent than ever, and promised
that if be would only try her once a^ain
she would be a dutiful, affectionate and
faithful wife.
In the goodness of hin heart the old
capitalist wfcose capital, by the way, had
rapidly diminished with his matrimonial
experiences decided to give her one moie
chance. Before she would consent to ac
cept it, however, she was anxious for a
little piece more of his property, and some
more deeds went oh record.
It is very evident that Mr. Moore has
but little properly left, for a week ago Mrs.
Moore brought suit for divorce in Mon
terey County.
After telling this tale of many chapters
of woes Mr. Moore says that he is con
vinced that Elizabeth Howe is a designing
woman versed in all thfcway3 of the worid,
who determined from the first to take ad
vantage of his weak mental and physical
condition to carry out a plot to play upon
bis affections until she succeeded in cajol
ing him out of his property. Under the
circumstances he asks the court to declare
that the deeds were obtained from him by
undue influence and to order the property
restored to him.
Mrs. Moore will probably file an inter
esting complaint within tne next few
days. As she has obtained property val
ued at about $75,000 it is not likely that
she will give it up without a bitter legal
struggle.
THE BRIDGE MATTER.
A Novel Solution of the Question Pro
posedâTrains to Run on m
Loop.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 31.â An ap
parently feasible solution of the estuary
bridge proposition is offered by Engineer
yon Schmidt, the well-known dredger
proprietor. If carried out it will remove
nearly every objectionable feature of
travel to and from Alameda as at present
existing ami wiil obviate the necessity of
constructing and maintaining an expen
sive bridge or bridges. Mr. yon Schmidt's
propos.tion is to use both moles, as at
present, bnt to lay third rail-, so that
narrow-gauge trains may run on the
broad-gauge mole and broad-gauge trains
on the narrow-gauge pier. Then operate
all trains on a loop line. That !Â«, have
trains run from the brond'gaugo mole
through Oikland and around the head of
the estuary, then throueh Alameda to the
present narrow-gauge pier and bRCk again
lo the starting j omt. Have the narrow
gauge trains do tiie same thing, swinging
around at High street in this city so as to
connect with the present line by Fruit
vale. Passengers couhl thus go either
way to reach the ferry, and no matter
winch way a train was running it would
bring up at eitherone of the moles. This
would greatly relieve the stress of travel
when it is at its height, as there would be
no empty trains running one way and
crowded one.< ti e other, as at present.
It would, as stated, obviate all necessity
of maintaining a pridse, with the vexa
tious delays incidental to its irequent
OpCQlor, which are becoming worse and
worse 83 travel in the estuary increases.
The expense of fitting the tracks lor both
gauges and of connecting the present
line* would be small. In fact the travel
ing public would be greatly ommoded by
tue increased facilities afforded, and it ia ;
difficult to see what objection can be
offered to the proposition.
Held to Answer.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 31.â GnsUve
Mulier, the clam-digger who filled thelegÃ
of a Mongolian fellow-toiler with shot the
other day, has been held in $1000 bonds to

intention of shooting the Chinaman, and
that hwonly fired the gun to empty the

CALL FOR FOOTBALL MEN.
Captain Haskell of the Berkeley
Team Files a List of
Eiigib'es.
He Makes an Appeal to All Able-
Bodifd College M n to Turn
Out and Practice.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 31.â Captain
Haskell of the University of California
football team has taken time by the fore
lock, and if there is any virtue in a long
season of training in preparation for the
annual intercollegiate match, he seems I
determined to reap the benefit. To-day I
he posted a list of 125 young college men |
from all four classes whose physical meas
urements and general muscular strength
quaiify them lor football playing. In his J
appeal to them he declares that all who
are able to encage in sport as violent an
football should for the sake of their col
lege come out and try for the team.
"We must have men from which to pick
our team," says he, '"and I will promiso
every one who comes out a chance to
learn the game and pienty of chances to
show ms ability. It depends upon the
determination of those whose names are
mentioned in the list whether Â»hey sue- j
ceed at the tame or not. If any one j
whose name I have mentioned has reason
fur not coming out I wish ne would please
let me know it."
Though about twenty men have been |
coming out regularly for practice at kick- j
in.' and running with the ba 1 for thret or ;
four weeks, this is the first general call
that has been made this year.
In fact, there has never before in the
history of intercollegiate matches on this
coast been a demand for men so early in
the season. The Berkeley men will p it- '.
tern somewhat after the Eastern college \
athletes, and train moderately for five or
Biz months rather than violently jor six
wi cks or two month-*, as bÂ»s been the ;
custom. This new plnn is largely credited â 
to Charles P. Xott, the Brown ex-captain, j
who is now a student at Berkeley, and '
who assisted Butterworth last season.
Kott will probably be the only coach ;
Berkeley will have for the coming tea
son.

DAVIE`S REIGN
IS NOW ENDED
The Ex-Mayor's Term Ren
dered Valueless Because
of Opposition.
Two Years of the Most Ridicu
lous Government Oakland
Ever Knew.
With Mayor Thr ma>* Advent There Is
Scm.3 Hope for Harmony and
Manicpal Progress.
Oakland Offic? San Francisco Call,)
9<iÃ Broadway, March 31. J
John L. Davie vacated the Mayor's
office to-night, and to-morrow morning
.Captain W. R. Thomas will assume the
duties of chief executive of this city.
The career of Mr. Pa vie has been one of
great interest. Had he met with the sup
port ol the Council and Beard of Public
Works, such as a Mayor has a right to ex*
pect, his administration would have been
one of marked success and progress. As
it is, Oakland has straggled along daring
the past two years, but has added nothing
to her ditcnity or her prosperity. ~
Mr. Davie was unfortunate from the
start. He was elected to office by one of
those peculiar freaks of politics common
to this city. His opponent, J. W. Nelson,
Dad the indorsement and nomination of
everything in the city but the People's
party. Had the Populist vote been ac
corded the Councilmen as it was the
Mayor, there would have been harmony
at the City Hal , and John L. Davie would
have ranked as one of the greatest Mayors
Oakland ever had.
When future history ii read, however,
the administration that closed at mid
night will be viewed as one of the most
useless and ridiculous known. The fail
ure to do anything of value by the gov
ernment just passed away is due partly to
the personal feeling shown on both sides.
Annoyed at finding himself impotent
I against the attacks and policy of his po
litical enemies, Mr. Davie was forced in a
measure to strike back in the same man
ner in which he was assailed. This kind
of warfare invariably grows until it be
comes absurd. It was so in this case, and
for the past two years Oakland's muni
c pal .government has been the laughing
stock of the State.
One of Mr. Davie's most praiseworthy
acts was to insist on a low tax levy at a
time when business was stagnant and
everybody was comparatively poor. For
doing this he was at once assailed as being
j the tool of the bankers and corporations.
I This, however, is not just, and many men
who have just vacated their offices cannot
look back on as consistent a record as that
of the ex-Mayor.
One of his most bitter enemies has been
I ex-President Mott of the Council. But
' the records show that Mott's policy has
i changed many times, while that of the
! Mayor has been comparatively uniform.
The last act of the Council is typical of its
whole term of office. It passed an ordi
nance, Mr. Mott assisting, over the veto of
; Mayor Davie. This ordinance ives ex
; elusive" right to a large portion of the city
, wharf to one firm, and the Mayor pro
duces the charter to prove that. this is
illegal. : â¢â¢- â¢â¢-â â  - . 'â '
Some Â«time ago' Mr. Mott, 0 as one of a
I special committee appointed by the Mer
i chants' Exchange, signed, a report which
'states in very forcible language that the
letting of the exclusive right to the city
wnarf would be a detriment to the com
mercial interests of the city.
Partly guided by this report. Mayor
Davie framed his veto, and, in his desire
j to show bis personal animosity .to the
! Mayor, Councilman Mott voted against
j his own signed advice. -
Under these conditions the city is to be
I congratulated that such an administra
| tion has passed away. To-morrow morn
'â  ing an out-and-out Republican Mayor
will take charge of Oakland. He has a
i Republican majority in every branch of
i the city government, and, having de
| cared that it is his intention' to work in
harmony with ail the departments, there
is now a probable certainty that the scan
| dals of the last two years will not be re
i peated. __ ____________

OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â Dr. George
C. Pardee stated to-day that the plea 'of

ment:
My father has been dead now six months.

hoping that you would not repeat it. "You
have seen fit to do so, and I cannot ignore
it a second time."
Mr. Baggett again tried to interpose, but
Judce Bahrs was not through, and he
continued:
"You know yourself, and no one knows
better tlian you, that such language is un
professional. lam sure that if the mat
ter was brought to the attention of the
Supreme Court that tribunal would sus
tain my position, and I aru willing at any
time to leave it to a jury of my feliow-
Judges and abide by their decision.
"I shall allow no sucn language to ba
used in my court, and I trust that you
will not again repeat the remarks to
which I have been compelled, in uphold
ing the dignity of this court, to refer."
Attorney Baggett made, a few remarks
m which he disclaimed any intention of
offending the court, and said that his
motive in asking the question had not
been understood.
Judge Babrs listened until he had
finished and then said quietly:
"Proceed, gentlemen."
The -mile on Attorney Barnes' face
while the scene described was being en
acted was childlike and bland.
TO THE SAN MATEO LINE.
Boulevard to Be Pushed Thither
. From Golden Gate
, Park.
If Horsemen and Cyclists Will Assist,
a Splendid Enterprise May B;
Consummated.
Those who are contributing to the
boulevard fan <, in addition to aiding
their deserving; fellow-creatures by giving
hem employment, are alao contributing
to make for San Franciico a most at
tractive driveway.
The $14,021 already subscribed will
about half- finish the boulevard. To leave
such a proposed boulevard half-finished
would not do justice to San Francisco's
reputation. Those of the citizens who
have the time should visit the scene of
operation and see for themselves the
grandeur of the work already done.
Now that there are 700 men at work tne
daman. l on the treasury becomes greater
than it was during he earlier period.
Nearly one-half of the total amount sub
scribed has been paid out,: leaving the
small sum of about $7000 in the hands of
til-- committee to complete a $14,000 job. Â°
The citizens who have contributed to
this fund deserve great credit, while nt
the same time greater praise should be
bestowed upon the relief committee,
which has worked hard for the success of
the movement to give employment to the
wort ny men of San Francisco, and now
well it has succeeded can be attested by
the grand driveway which is all but com
pleted ' for near two miles. The relief
movement has been wonderfully success
iul as la* as :> it has por.e, but it must be
understood there are more than 1000 appli
cants for work who have not yet been
given any chance, for the simple reason
that all who apply cannot be accommo
dated at once.
. There has been careful management of
the movement, and especial pains have
been taken in reference to the most de
serving families. It is the intention of the
committee to give each worthy applicant
at least fourteen days' employment, and
new men are being placed on each day in
order that as many as can may be as
sisted while the money holds out.
By this rule the employment of all ap
plicants is made possible lor fourteen
days' work. The relief committee is en
deavoring' to provide all head* of needy
families with work, vet there are many
among the laborers who are really unable
to do a full day's work, even for a dollar.
Some of them are too aged or too i 1 or in
firm to do manual labor, yet are needy,
and in some cases destitute, yet the relief
committee is doing all .in its power to aid i
them. .
The first coating of macadam was spread
over a portion of the boulevard yesterday.
This is taken from the land of the Spring'
Valley Water Company, between the park
and Lake Honda. A roadway twenty feet
wide will be made in the center of the
boulevard as the grading progresses, and
later the entire width will be thoroughly
macadamized.
It is the invention of the committee to
push this boulevard as far as the county
line to San Mateo before stopping, if the
citizms will respond with, sufficient
money.;
Three blocks of '.his boulevard are al
ready complete on the park end, travelers
| leaving X street by Late Honda through
I a portion of the Aimshouse tract to where
the present work has been commenced.
That portion where op rations are ; now.
going on is not difficult, as the greater
portion runs througn loose sand and soft
soil, whereas the northern end will be
much more tedious in consequence of the
deep filline over the pond and. the heavy
cutting on the west side of the Spring
Valley works' property west of the creek.
An appeal has been made to the stable
men and the directors of the Ingieside
racecourse, as also to the wheelmen, to
subscribe what they can so that the relief
committee will be in a position to. put
more men to work by Monday.

Bought Stock nf a Defunct Bank.
, Oa, November 3, 1892, Mrs. K. A. D&nielsen
of Los Angeles purchased thirty-six shares of
Btoclc of | the j City Bank of Los Angeles' from
George â¢ P. oakum. At the | time of | the pur
chase the bank was a defunct institution, but
the woman did not learn that such was the
case until her. personal property was seized
a year later to justify the claims of eighty of
the bank's creditors, the proportion of the lia
bilities on her stock being $984 10. This she
paid, but she sued Yoakum for the recovery oi
the money she had paid to him for the siocic
â  and the money she had paid out, the $984 10.
The . first she recovered by judgment, but the
latter she could not recover, although the lia
bilities accrued previous to her purchase. The
I Supreme Court yesterday be<a that as Mrs:

was no cause, for action, and the decision of
of the lower court was affirmed. "

LIGHT TO SHINE
ALONG THE ROADS
Park Commissioners Have
Decided to Erect a
Power- House.
It Will Cost $40,000 to Make
the Driveways Bright
as Day.
The Museum Has Surpassed Al Others
in the United States in Attend
ance and Growth.
o
The Park Commissioners have decided
to light up the Golden Gate Park with
powerful electric arc lamps.
The matter has been discussed for some
time, and the decision was reached on
Saturday afternoon. Everything i* to be
arranged botn in the most improved and
the moÂ»t economical way.
The park will have a power-hcuse to
generate the electricity within the grounds.
The plans have been drawn and accepted,
and work will comrnenco in about three
weeks. These plans were furnished by
Commissioner Irving M. Scott free of
charge, and thus the first move in the
improvement is characterized by economy.
The power-house wilt be situated near
the water-works plant of the park, and it
will have sufficient capacity to light up all
the main driveways. All the important
machinery will be in duplicate so that in
case of derangement of one part the other
can instantly be set to work, ami keep tne
lights shining. The wires will be laid un
derground, and everything will be done
In the most modern style. It is estimated
that the total cost will be about Â£35,000 to
$40,000.
T..e details of the number and the loca
tion of the lamps have not yet been de
culed on, but there will be a capacity in
the power plant much beyond what tha
first development wiil require. Provision
is ihus made fur a gradual extension of
the illumination. When the plan is fully
carried out horses and bicycles can ba
speeded clear to the ocean beech on moon
le-s nights in a flood of dgnt that will
make an outing suie and pleasant.
Last Tuesday was the second anniver
sary of the founding of tne park museum,
and it has made a mo-a remarkable rec
ord. Many people iiere will periiaps bo
surt nsed to learn that, th- attendance at
this museum was larger in iwt-lv** months
than at any other in the United States. In
round numbers the annual attendance
was half a million. Even at the Govern
ment museum at Washington the attend
ance fell short of this by about 200,000.
In the two years of its existence it has
exceeded in the value of the treasures ac
cumulated tlie collections of any other
museum in the country, not merely for
two years, but for ten.
It is wort, y of note that among that
wist crowd oi half a million visitors not
one has ever injured any of the articles
displayed nor misbehaved so as to make
arrest necos.-iiry. The curator thicks this
is a remarkable record for a half million
people to make.
A very fine addition has just been made
to the attractions of the mn-euiu in a
donation of a collection of rare and valo
ao!e articles from M. H. de Young of San
Francisco. The tirst in interest is a mag-
I nificent silver "Ivanhoe Shield." designed
and modeled by the Inie C. B. Birch,
A.R.A.. which has j:i3t arrived from Eng
land. It is ornamented in Celtic style,
and the cente? plaque repre-ents the
combat between Ivanhoe and Bois Guil
bert. The live small plaques surround
ing it contain the heads of Kowena, Re
becca, Coeur de Lion, Cedric and Ivanhoe.
Next in beauty is a marble siatue.
"Etc," by Lauret de Broussei. This ia
from Paris. Also from Paris there is ft
fauteuil, or arm chair, hand carved and
gilt, upholstered in crimson velvet, of the
period of Louis XIII. Other articles of
the collection are an antique clock and
some ancient sword guards inlaid with
gold and silver.
SOCIALISM`S MESSAGE
Rev. S. Gocdenough's Lecture
at the Turk-Street
Temple.
Exposition of the Principles and
Beliefs of the So
cialists.
A large audience, despite the unfavor
able weather, was present lest night at
the Turk-street Temple at the lecture
given by Rev. S. Goodenough, tne Popu
list nominee for Mayor at the late city
election in Oakland. ThÂ« reverend gen
tleman received quite an ovation as be
stepped to the platform. His subject was
"The Message ol Socialism to Humanity."
Mr. Goodenough said:
Socialism indorses the fundamental princi
ples of the Declaration of Indeoendenre. It
invites the co-operation of every ind:>Mnal,
but asks no man to efface himself. SociiUism
1 is not self-surrender. On the contrary, It aims
1 at tbe unfolding of the divine character in
' humanity while it recognizes the need ot
proper conditions. It is essentially a humane
j raetsage, and eminently scientific as well as
fraternal, believing that there can be no real
or permanent advance in civilization that is
notgeueral in its character which would er
" ait man in the enjoyment f f his liberty and
\ remove all obstacles in the shape of exist
ing inequalities to the common futhvrhood
â  of God ana the univorsal brotherhood of man.
Christ was the most practical man that ever
; lived -when he said, "Stall ye first the kingdom
, of Gnd and bi< righteousness and all these
i things snail be added to you."
' The speaker was frequently interrupted
1 by applause, which was continued for sev
\ eral minutes as he finished his address.

STUDYING THE PLANT
AT NILES CANYON
Supervisors Spend a Day
Looking Over Spring
Valley Property.
Trip by Boat and Buggy to
Bedrock Dam and Return
by Rail.
Chief Engineer Schussler Explains
Hew Alameda Creek So'; Vis
toe Problem-
01 the Supervisors only Dr. Dodge
missed the boat at Folsom-street wharf
yesterday morning bound for Dumbarton
Pomt â the party going to Niles to inspect
the Spring Valley Water Company's
supply and plant at tfcat place. Mayor
Fhelan also was not on board. The boat
was the tup Vigilant, and the party, when
she ran away from the wharf at&:3o, num
bered twenty-lour. There was Chief En
ginesr Scdussler and three or four assist
ants, the Supervisors and their sergeant
at-arma, three or four guests and newspa-
pernien.
The run down the bay was very pleasant
as tho morning was perfect and rapid
time was made, the thirty miles to Dura
btrton being covered in an hour and fifty
minutes. At Dumbarton Point the bay
is less than a mile wide and here the
crossing is made by the company with
their submarine pipes. Mr. Schussler ex
plained the system to the Supervisors,
how the 36-pioe lhat comes down from
ICiles is divided, before the plunge into the
bay is taken, into two 1G inch pipes, how
provision is made here for preventing re
fuse of any character from passing into the
submarine pipe* and how by dividing the
pipes, that is by having two instead of
one for the lons stretch under the bay,
one may be shut off and the straining ap
paratus cleaned without interrupting tue
flow toward San Francisco.
The inspection here being concluded
the parly walked on to Jarus Slough over
the wooden footpath above the big pipe,
which is here suspended above the swamp.
At the sloughâ where the pipe again drops
under water â the party was ferried to the
other side, and there found a variety of
onen two-horse rigs awaiti; g thpm. In
these they were driven through Newark
to the Alameda Creek near that point,
and thence to Centervillo and uregory's
Hotel. H?re the long procession rounded
up ana took dinner and rented lor an
hour. Then the ride was resumed to
Niles, where a special engine and car
stood in readiness to carry the party up
the canyon to a point as near the com
pany's cam as possible. A walk ci half a
mile single tile over the stone aqueduct
brought the party to Bedrock Dam, where
the water of the crej?k is diverted through
the aqueduct and pipes to Belmont pumps.
Standing here Mr. Schussler explained
how the watersheds <>l tli.s mountainous
district would, by more dams and proper
husbanding, afford an increaÂ«inc suppy
of water and particularly solve tue water
question for San Francisco. With greater
demands new pipes would have to be laid
and with them other submarine pipes.
The present pipes having crossed the bay
to Ravens wood follow the public ro.id
neariy all the way to the pumping station
at Bt'lmont, and new pipes would proba
bly follow the same course.
The party returned to the car and were
carried speedily to t c Oakland Mole, and
all declared having spent a day of profi.
able inspection of one branch of the big
and complicated water plant.
CARPENTERS' DISTRICT COUNCIL
A Long, Loud ProieÂ»t Over Police Offi
cers Doing Craftsmen* Work.
There was a large attendance at the
meeting of the District Council of Carpen
ters and Joiners at 102 O'Farrell street last
evening. The principal business discussed
v.as that of the members ot the Police De
partment working as carpenters, plumb
ers, painters, etc.
The arguments were the same aa those
heretofore advanced that patrolmen
should not be required to perform such
services while they are receiving pay at
$100 per month to patrol the streets and
protect citizens and property. Every po
liceman thus employed keeps one or more
men who follow these trades for a living,
from earning his daily bread.
For the majority of carpenters in this
C>ty times are Hard at best and there are
many more workingmeu than there are
positions.
The Dosltion of the Chief of Police is
that the work now being performed by
patrolmen must be done, and that th*>
reason policemen are made to do carpen
tenneand tinkering generally is be on use
the Supervisors have not provided any
money for the payment of regular crafts
men. Tne Supervisors plead that the cis
not enough money to go around, and, as
usual, the workingman is made to nuffer.
An effort will be made by the committee
of the District Council to secure another
hearing before the Supervisors and see if
something can be done to have regular
carpentars employed for city work ana
thÂ« polic\ sent back to their teats.
During the coming week an able speaker
from the carpenters' ranks will be sent to
Han Jose with a view of arousing a little
more life among the unions of the Garden
City ana the Santa Clara Valley.
MILL VALLEY SANITARIUM.
An Inktltution on New Lines to Be
Founded for Convalescents.
Several of the prominent pnysicians of
'this City have come together and formed
a body, which will soon be incorporated
under the title of the "Mill Valley Sani
tarium Company," organized for tne pur
pose of instituting a sanitarium for the
convalescent in Mill Valiey.
- The need of such an institution, these
practitioners claim, ha 3 been long felt.
U'ney have been in the habit of sending
such of their patients as could afford it to
one of the private hospitals in tne out
skirts of Ban Francisco, but believe, and
so state, that a sanitarium is much
needed where salients can s*cure the ad
vantages of the pure country air and all
the exhilarating influence that accrue
from living as near as possible to nature.
For the purpose of a sanitarium tbe
hotel at Mill Valley, a building of forty
rooms, has been leased, and all arrange
ments in this respect were completed
about two months ago. The idea is to
make it as near as possible like a German
resort, and it is estimated that to do so
will cost those interested from $50,000 to
$60,000.
In connection with the sanitarium use
will be made of the mud springs in the
vicinity, of known efficacy in certain dis
eases. They contain, it lias been deter
mined by chemical analysis, silica, mag
nesia and other elements of a hygienic
quality.
Amonc those mentioned es interested
in the sanitarium are: Jjr. Charles A.
Clinton, Dr. Joseph R. Davidson, Dr. yon
Hoffman and Â£. SteHe of Mill Valley.
Each member has 200 shares. Seven di
rectors will soon be chosen.
The leaf of Ihc cocoanut trie is nearly
thirty feet Ion?. A single leaf of the para
sol magnolia of Ceylon affords shade ior
fifteen or twenty persons.

THE HEAVIEST SPECIFI
CATIONS IN THE WORLD
Six New Steel Bridges Built
During the Past Year
Within the State.
MANY OTHER BIG PLANS OF
IMPROVEMENT.
Twenty New Locomotives Purchased
and Everything on Wheels
8.-ing Repaired.
California within the past year acquired
the distinction of having within its borders
a number of bridges built from the heav
iest specifications ever used in the United
States, and this means in the world.
They were put up at various points on
In Niles Canyon, Over Alameda Creek.
the Soutnern Pacific Company's lines, in
pursuance of the policy of each year
replacing a certain number of wooden
bridges with tbe best modern mild steel
structures.
This course is taken not only with reier
ence to this State, but along all its lines.
Between Los Angeles and New Orleans,
: a distance of 2038 miles, there are to-day
but three wooden spans, though there are
on the Southern Pacific Railroad, between
the points named, not less than two hun
dred bridges.
Other big plans of improvement have
ai&o been carried out during the pa?t year
in the matter of equipment, both as to lo
comotives and cars.
No leas than six modern and expensive
steel bridges were constructert during 1896.
The material for these is what is known
as mild steel in contradistinction to tool
steel. Mid steel has tbe greater ductile
property, and will bend ra her tban break
undcrjircai weicht. All of these struc
tures are, 'iosig'.sed to carry locomotives
weighing 260 tons each, followed by a
train weighing two tons to the linear foot.
All tbe work of putting up the structures
was done by the men employed in the
maintenance of wav department under
the supervision of W. G. Curtis, engineer
of that department. Tbe material was
shaped on specifications furnished by the
Southern i'acihc Company.
One of tat; new bridges crosses Cache
Creek on the west side line near Wood

Two of them bridge tbe Truckee River â

BLOOD AND SKIN
HUMORS
Afflicting a Whole Family.
Speedily Cured by
CUTICURA.
Statements Sworn to Before the
Clerk of the Supreme
Court.
My wife had appear on her limbs, jast above
the ankles, five small pimples that began to
enlarge, and soon developed into eating ulcers
of the indolent type, which, despite all reme-
dies and our efforts to cure them, grew worse
and worse, and at the end of three months
had become very bad, two of them having
eaten to the bone. At that time we began to
use Ccticura remedies, and with two bottles
of Resolvent, one box of Ccticuka, and
one cake of CtrriCDRA Soap, they were cured
sound and well in about two months. The
' scars are there to-day as living witnesses of
the severity and extent of the ulcers.
I also was afflicted the sarrle winter with
papular rash, from which I could not rest day
or night. My skin became in a very bad fix
when I began using Cuticura remedies. I
used' them for about one month and was
cured.
My little baby girl, when about ten months
old, was afflicted with Eczema, her limbs from
.her knees down were one solid sore from
which she suffered greatly. We tried several
remedies which only aggravated them, before
we began the use or the Citthji.'ra remedies,
in which case there was a complete cure with
no return of the disease. -

one at the first crossing and another at
the fourth crossing. Each, of these is a
single span of 1208 feet.
Prosser Creek, between Truckee and
Reno, is crossed with a viaduct 200 feet in
length, consisting of four spans.
One of the most picturesque structures
may te seen in Niles Canyon, about four
miles from Niles, stretched across Ala
meda rreek. It is composed of two spans,
one 200 feet lon t and the other 100 feet.
The longest of thÂ« entire number may
be viewed near MrConnell station, on the
road between Stockton ana Sacramento.
It crosses the Cosumnes River, consists
of eight spans of fifty feet eacn, and rests
on iron cylinder piers. In the latter par
ticular this bridge differs trom all the
others, which rest on cut granite piera.
The estimated cost of bridges of this
character is about $Â£0 a foot. As the ag
gregate number of feet in the structures
specified is 1476, it will bn seen t at an
expenditure of nearly $120,000 was in
volved in their construction.
Between Los Anaeles and Indio, sev
enty miies of Crack were relaid with sev
enty-five-ponnd steel rails, in place of fifty
pound and sixty-pound rails, and this sec
tion of the line was also thoroughly bal
lasted. The cost of this work was in tue
neighborhood of $3u0,000.
In the company's shops at Sacramento
the working Jorce is now at his:h tide, the
r.ivroll for March showing more than
2000 names uj>on it. The men are busy,
as General Manager Kru:;schnitt puts it,
repairing everything on wheels in expecta
tion of a heavy wheat crop to be moved
the coming season. Among, other things
some lftij boxcars that have suffered in
wrecks at various times and places are
being rebuilt.
The rno^t important addition to the
eauipment will be twenty very large new
locomotives, with 20x20 cylinders, each
locomotive with tender weighing 112 tons
and having 63-inch driving-wheels. They
will be used for both passenger and freight
business, and will be distributed over the
entire system of the Southern Pacific
Company. Ten of these have practically
been delivered, and the entire number
will be ready for service by July. These
co6t an average of about $10,000 each.
General Manager Krutischmtt states
that this activity is displayed in anticipa
tion of a very heavy freight movement
during the coming fall, as the result of
increaed prosperity under the new Re
publican regime.

MINING MEN ARE ALERT
Looking Sharply After the Min
eral Land Bill Pending
in Congress.
An Agent Appointed to Stir the
Miners to tbe Necessity of Sub
scr b ng to Emergency Fund.
A called meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California Miners' Associa
tion was held last evening at the Union
League Ciut> to talk'over the mineral land
bill. Julian Sonntas withdrew his resig
nation ac secretary upon tbe earnest re
quest of Pre-idpnt N'eff. The president
and secretary were by motion added to
the committee appointed by the last con
vention to confer with the .United States
Dabris Commissioner and the secretary
was instructed to write to the commission
that such committee had been appointed.
8. K. Thornton was appointed to visit
all the mining counties of the State and
to urge upon the miners the necessity of
subscribing toward the fund for tbe carry
ing on of the work of the association.
Tirey L. Ford, in speaking of the min
eral land bill, said he had reason to hope
that it would pass, but that our (senators
and re present a lives should be instructed
to devote their attention toward securing
its passage tn benall of California alone,
as otherwise ihe opposition to it would be
strengthened. The motion was adopted.
Mr. Ford paid an earnest tribute to the
members of- the late Legislature. He said
that body bad favored more wholesome
mining legislation than any other two or
three legislatures. He said this, the first
mining Stat* in the country, had iaborea
under more bad lawÂ« than any other State
and was tbe last to adopt reasonable regu
lations, and the present Legislature at
the session just closed had seen the errors
and corrected many of them. "They did
all we ask*d of them and did it with a
zeÂ«t," said Mr. Ford. He mentioned
Judge Boward, chairman of the Committee
on Mines, as conspicuous in tbe good
work.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1897.
ALSIP WAS
VICTIMIZED
Why Attorney E. M. Mor
gan May Have Fled in
Such Haste.
CONCERNED IN AN UGLY
SCHEME.
Alsip Thought Himself the
Father of a Nameless
Child.
SOME DOCTORS MIXED TIP IN
THE AFFAIR.
The Capitalist Bled to the Extent of
Thousandsâ The Foundling in
the Cue.
When Attorney Edward M. Morgan
shook the dust of this City from ois feet
the cause of his action was unknown.
But a story has now leaked out in which
it is alleged that Morgan took to flight
because Edwin K. Alsip, real estate dealer
and capitalist, a victim, assumed the role
of avenger.
Alsip's story is the old one of a man
who strayed into forbidden paths. He was
made to believe that he was the father of
Eugenic Flora Howeil's child, and it is
| stated that the belief cost him nearly
j $15,000.
As told by Mrs. Margaret Morgan, the
divorced wife of the man accusad of the
conspiracy and blackmail, who lives at
1617 Taylor street, the story is as follows:
Eugenic Flora Howell, fresh from an
Eastern college, came to San Francisco in
March, 1894. She was only 21 years of
age, and a beautiful girl.
Uufortunately for herself and him she
met Edwin K. Alsip wuile attending a
church in the Mission. Ho became vio
lently infatuated, and the result was Miss
Howell's downfall.
Fearing that she was in a condition
which would soon betray her, in Septem
ber, 1894. tlie unfortunate girl called on a
doctor who resides on O'Farrell street for
medical advice. He was told the girl's
story and passed it on to Morgan, who
was an intimate friend-.
Morgan offered the girl a refuge in his
house until her trouble was a thing of the
past. Sue gladly consented and went to
live under his roof.
"In due time," said Mrs. Morgan "the
pirl discovered that her condition was not
what she thought, but Morgan persuaded
her that her future dei ended entirely
upon making Alsip pay for her support
anyhow.
'â¢Htr doctor and Morgan^then induced
another >ioctor to go to the City and
County Hospital and select a ten Jays'
old infant resembling Alsip in the color of
Where the Central Pacific Railroad Makes Its Fourth Crossing of
the Truckle River.
its hair and eyes. The baby was taten
from the hospital by a woman to her home
on Hayes street. It was then taken to
Morgan's home Dy himself in a cloned
carriage.
"One of the doctors then assisted in
the operrtion of injecting strychnine into
Miss Howell's veins, the purpose being to
make nor look pale and ill. The baby
was placed by her side and Alsip lor.
"Alsip fell readily into the meshes 6f
the plat. He t-ug2estÂ»d that ttie little
one be eiven the name of Eugene Jorgen-
Ben, the surname Delne tbat of his mother
before her marriage. From tbat time on
Morgan bled him continuously, and of
the large sum he got it is said that Miss
Howelt received only about $400."
In August, 1896. Mrs. Morgan, who bad
procured a divorce from her husband,
went to Alsip and told him all. He in
vestigated tbe tale, found it true, and im
mediately descended upon Morgan with
tire in his eye.
Being short of ready cash, he had given
his noiotf for $7000 during the year 1896,
and the- return of these was first de
manded. They had been discounted, and
it was in order to redeem them that Mor
gan was forced to extremities. He could
not procure enough, and an Alsip was im
portunate in nis demands he is said to
have sought safety in Sight.
In December, 185>4, Miss Ho well re
turned to her Eastern bom<>, where it is
said she is now married and leading a re
spectable life. The foundling child is in
tha care of Mr?. Carberry, Morgan's
cousin, who has grown to love it dearly.
The doctor chiefly involved was seen at
his office yesterday, but he bad no com
ment whatever to make. The matter, he
said, was one of a professional character,
and he would not discuss it at all unless
ordered to do so in court.
MR. ALSIP'S VERSION.
He Admits That Ho Was Vic
timized.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 31.âEd
win K. Alsip admitted to a Bee reporter
to-day that the story that he had been a
victim of blackmail at the bands of Attor
ney Edward M. Morgan was in the main
true.
He admitted having had guilty relations
with Eugenic Flora Howell, and that he
hod promised to care for her child.
Morgan, he said, demanded $50,000 from
him. He-refused to give it, and the iay wer
threatened to bring suit.
He then told his wife of his troubles,
and she advised him not to be black
mailed. In all he admits having paid out
$2350.
He discovered that he was the victim of
a conspiracy first through Attorney Reel
B. Terry. He says further that bis
mother's maiden name was Janeil and
that he did not suggest the name Jorgen
sen for the child.
Some of his notes are yet out, but with
them and the money Already raid he
would not have suffered to tne extent of
much more than $6000. The woman in
the case has made an affidavit to him, he
says, that Morgan induced her to enter the
conspiracy.
AMONG THE ATHLETES.
Pacific Coast Amateurs Wili
Stand by Union
Rules.
Amateur Clubs Must Not Encourage
Professionalism of Any
Kind.
The Pacific Coast Amateur Athletic As
sociation held a very interesting meeting
last evening in one of the compartments
of the Olympic Club.
The first matter discussed was the cham
pionship swimming tournament, which
will be held at the Lurline Swimming
Baths April 20 and 21. It was stated that
in all events I andsome medals will be
given, viz., a gold medal for first, a gold
and silver for second and a silver for third,
provided three or more contestants will
participate in the contest. No Â©otry will
be received after April 14. and all entries
must conform to the amateur rules as re
gards registration.
An entrance fee of $1 for each event
wiil be charged, but this sum will be re
funded to all bona-fide starters. All com
munications ehould be addressed to O. L.
Sweet, the swimming commissioner of ihe
Lurline baths.
Mr. Humphrey, president of the asso
ciation, stated that there was not an iota
of fact in the published article that the
Pacific Association was seriously thinking
of withdrawing from the Amateur Ath
letic Union.
Mr. Humphrey also thought that the
registration rule as imposed by the
A. A. U. was an excellent move in ihe
right direction, as by registration a card
of identification would be uiven to ev< ry
bona-nde amateur athlete, admitting him
into any game held by any club which is
a member of the union.
It was rumored that the University of
California bad concluded to resign irom
the P. A. A., but its representative who
attended the meeting last evening said
that there was no trufh in the report.
The members of the P. A. A. did not
deny the fact that thÂ»-v were in favor of
the establishment of a Western union or
association, provided it cou!d be governed
by Btrictly amateur ruling, ns then the
moneys accruing from the clubs would
assist very materially to support the
games held west of the big mountains.
The championship games will be held
on May 1, and the annual convention will
be held on May 14, at the .Reliance Club
in Oakland.
According to a letter that was received
yesterday at the Olympic Club from the
secretary ol the Multnomah Club of Port

HUGO TOLAND`S TIGHTS.
He Must Expose the Contour of
His Limbs Next
Week.
And Like Cissy Fitzgerald He Remon
stratod With His Manager, Who
Proved Hard-Hearted.
Hueo Toland has discovered that the lot
of an actor is by no means a state of per
petual bliss. His agony is caused by a
pair of tights â of course, his own tightsâ
which Manager Belasco insists he must
wear next week in the new play, "Wild
Oats," which calls for the Directoire cos
tume of the Frenoh Revolution.
It is not that the good-looking actor is
fearful lest he might not be able to till any
pair of tights that might be brought to
him, but he fears that he may not fill
them beautifully, or, rather, too well,
after the manner of the plump garlic
sftusages which delieht the eye in the pork
shops of the Latin quarter. Hence the
sensitive embonpoint of his nether limbs
shrank from the publicity to be given to
their adiposity.
So he went to Manager Belasco in the
hurry-me-up-quick style and without any
preliminaries bluntly refused to allow his
legs to play the role of mammoth bo
logna", Directoire or no Directoire. Man
ager Belasco insisted that the play would
be spoiled without Toland in tights, and
insisted that the proper costume should
be worn.
The actor persisted in his refusal. His
contract contained no provision requiring
him to wear tights and he would see Mr.
Belasco in the gallery or elsewhere .before
be would make an exhibition of himself.
Mr. Belasco declined to â¢o there, and
informed Mr. Toland that he would cease
to be a member of the company and that
his contract would terminate in case
his stubbornness continued. Then To
land threatened to resign. This had
no ' effect, and the actor saw that
the manager was determined, and that
he wouid hare to cive in or walk
out into that gloomy place whore unem
ployed actors lounge and where .the ghost
never walks. He could not bold out like
Cissy Fitzgerald when she lefused to wear
those thin things, because he hadn't the
same reason that she had.
Tb n be tried cajolery and promised the
manager that he would treat him to the
best dinner in town every day for a month
if he would only let him wear anything
but those French bolsters. But it was of
no use, although the promise of the din
ners hit the manager below the belt and
the actor final y surrendered. The man
ager suggested, for the same reason that a
condemned prisoner is fed well before be
ing led to the scaffold, that Mr. Toland
might mitigate the severity of his punish- ,
men I by wearing jet black tights, which
would minimize the obtrusiveness of his
embonpoint.
But Toiand was desperate and swore
thai be would wear fleshings of turquoise
blue.
Bets are even that he won't.
KILLED BY A TRUCK.
The Life Crushed Out of a Four- Year-
Old Boy on I-olsom Street
Yesterday.
James Holmes, a bright-faced boy of 4
years, was run over and killed yesterday
afternoon by a truck driven by James
Myers, who lives at 138^ Silver street.
The little boy and a companion of about
the same age stole a ride on the truck, and
Myers tried to drive them off by cracking
his whip. One of the children jumped off
the rear end of the vehicle, but tne Holmes
boy fell in front of a hind wheel and the
life was crushed out of him.
The driver was arrpsted by Officer .Gal
loway on a charge of manslaughter, and
was released on hia own recognizance, by
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan.
Mrs. B. T. Schell of 119 Langton street
is the boy's mother. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
