Turkish officers and forty soldiers who

The only condition that' Colonel Vassos
imposes on the officials is that the men be
deported from the islands. He makes the
offer out of consideration for Turkish
religious scruples, fearing that the prison

Some One Blundered About the Orders
and the "Blues" Had â¢All
the Advantage.
Fort"Wintield Scott was successfully de
fended yesterday against a gallant attack
.of land forces under command of Captain
Brant, First Infantry.
The battle was sharp and decisive, the
enemy being repulsed with what. would
have been heavy loss had the guns been
loaded. 'As it was the' fighting and
maneuvering offered a spirited picture of
war to tbe spectators and an excellent ob
ject lesson to the troops.
* The day was fine, with a smart ; breeze
blowing from the sea. The call to arm*
was sounded et. 10:25 o'clock and the
brigade charged with the duty of defend
ing the fort fell in on the grounds in front
of tha infantry barracks and the attacking
party on the cavalry parade grounds. This
party was dressed in the brown clothes of
"police duty.*" -â¦'/â¢Vy^^V^'' '
Both parties were of equal strength and
composition two troops of cavalry, two
compauie's of infantry, one of heavy and .
one of light artillery.
' Orders had' ,been. issued by Colonel
Young the day previous for the practical
.working out of a tactical" problem .under
the eye of Colonel George H. Burton, in
spector-general of the United States army.
Tne problem was the defense of a battery
posted on the heights above tne fort as
against attack .from a land, force moving
against it from the rear or from the land .
the direction of the garrison. The attack
was to be in the nature of a surprise that
is, the men were to be called from the bar
rack's to arms and to s taUe position at once
to meet it. . . r
Under the order the signal to begin the
attack was to be given in just one hour
from tbe call to arms, in which time the
party of defense was to move out all the
way to the .fort and immediately return
and take up their positions covering the
several approaches to the heights.
That is as Captain James Lockett of
the Fourth Cavalry, who was charged
with the defense, understood it. He laid
â bis plans and executed them excellently
in accordance with that understanding.
He bad* ridden over the ground the day
before' with capable aids, and chose
his position and instructed the officers
under him fust where they were to be2
posted and what they were to do in this
or that event. For they did not know the
plan of the attack and were not to know
. it until it developed itself.
.-' Captain Brant, on the ether hand,
charged with the attack, did not so under
v stand the ordersâ or, rather, believes U. at
â¢< the orders as issued must have been
'-changed at the last minute as to the de
* fense. He understood that the defense â
the blues, as they were called were to
move out to the heignt3 and. there remain
â¢ /-"until the signal - was given, and that heâ
the attacking party would only move
'.forward at that time, each thus on an
equal footing to endeavor to circumvent
. .the other. .-]â .-.. ''.;â¢â¢'
.'. .Whether or not some one blundered in
the interpretation ''.of', the .'.order.-, or
*.. whether the orders so intended, the effect
â¢ was to put the attacking party at a great
disadvantage and quickly terminate the.
.contest. -For. when the gun was fired or
. ; dering he fight to begin it found Captain
â¢^ Locketi's men already occupying every
position of vantage along, the ridge ex
tending from the fort clear across from
â¢Central avenue gate to Harbor View, com
manning the whole field . of " view, and
every means of approach, the several
companies posted in secure positions,. pro
tected from view for the most part by
â  trees and other natural earth works,' while
Captain Brant's men, the Browns, were
massed in single column in an' eighteen
foot road leading toward the McDowell
gate. .'..;. '..'..;' .â .'â -.;'...â ..':â¢ '.-"
They supposed the enemy was a mile
away waiting, as they were, for the signal
to move and take position, while, instead,
a battery occupying and concealed behind
a knoll a thousand yards away had a full
view of them. -Â-â¢ 'â¢' 'â  "â '?.i*-*.-l-*.-.^.'Vl ;
When the signal-gun was firea the echo
. was taken up by this battery, directed full
-into the ranks. The surprise was com
plete. Brant's purDOseof deploying west
ward, protected from view by making an
effort tnus to get to the rear of the enemy's
position, was promptly abandoned. The
battery had to be turned about in the nar
row road and a rapid run made for a knoll
.commanding the position of the enemy.
This was secured and the fire of the en
emy returned. <-;â¢;:.
; In the, meantime the cavalry of the
Browns pressed forward Â» through the
C brush, dismounted, in an attempt to. take :
the battery. Their approach was met and I
repulsed, however. -" X 'â '-.'â :' : -Xyy : T m -"- X *
While the artillery was thus engaeed the
infantry (two companies and a foot battery)
was dispatched eastward over , the foot
path through the woods toward the garri
â  son with a view of making a flank move
ment by the cemetery. But here again \
' they encountered the infantry of . the
Blues, and after a sharp exchange of fire
they were counted to have been van
quished and the recall was soundedâ tbe J
day had been won and lost
Away over on the hill to the extreme
left, near the posit-on of the, recently !
planted guns above the fort. Lieutenant '
Birkheimer, in command of the artillery, j
had taken a position with a battery com- j
mending at 3000 yards all the roads of I
approach. When the Browns, having
fallen back and secured their position on
the knoll above the McDowell gale,
made their presence known by opening
fire on the Blues' battery that had first
attacked them, Birkheimer began a rapid
fire that would no doubt have caused
great damage bad the guns carried any
thing more terrible than powder and
paper.
The fight is characterized by the officers
as merely a bit of active drill, intended
to familiarize officers and. men with the
real movement of war; with the rapid
disposition of troops under fire or the
shifting or maintaining 'of . position in !
making' or repulsing attack; with the
issuing, carrying and interpreting of
ordeis in action. 'For," as one of the
officers said yesterday, "a general may
plan ever so effectively, if his orders are
not understood or executed they are likely
to fall. Many a battle has been lost
through this cause."
The fight was conducted yesterday by
means of umpires who decided from the
position and respective advantage of the
men as it progressed, when victory or de
feat came. This delicate duty devolved
upon Captains Rogers, Potts and Starr.
The men were not allowed to approach
nearer to each other than fifty yards to
avoid injury from the fire. ,*;
When the cavalry of Captain Brant, for
instance, found themselves confronted
with the battery nt McDowell gate, it was
clear that, in real warfare, they were at
the mercy of the guns, and they were i
therefore counted out.
When the batteries of the Browns hur
riedly gained a position on the knoll to re
* turn the Blues' fire they had already been
under fire for some time and immediately
came under the fire of Birkheimer, safely
posted far above them at the point, and
were clearly at a disadvantage. So, too,
when Brant's infantry sallied into the
garrison, only to discover the Blues al
ready there protected by the brick build
ings, which if need be they could have oc
cupied, firing from the' windows, they
â¢ also were promptly counted out, and the
recall was sounded, taken up and re
peated all down the line, giving notice
that the battle was over â notice to all ex
. cept Birkheimer, who in his distant posi
tion, with the wind blowing inland, could
not even hear the reports of the guns.
Because of this he, s?eing the move
ment of the enemy toward the gtrrison
after they had capitulated, mistook it for
.an attack and continued firing until an
orderly rode up with orders and the an
nouncement that the fight was over.
Great interest was manifested in the ex
ercise, and the hills were dotted with men
and women, who, many oi them, watched
through glasses.
The exercises of 'yesterday were the first
of a number that are arranged to take
place during the next few months not
only at the Presidio but at all posts
throughout the army. Orders from the
War Department require that during six
weeks of each year all troops are to be ex
ercised in practical maneuvers employing
the functions of the three armies of the
service â infantry, cavalry and artillery.
This order has materially quickened the
life at the several barracks hereabouts.

'Uncle Sam Demands the Release of an
â  .Â»â Jsnprisoned . Seaman.
'â¢j* WASHINGTON, D. C, April 1. âIn
addition to the McCordrcaje the United
States has another grievance against
Peru. Minister McKenzie at Lima, Peru,
has been instructed by Secretary Sherman
to demand the immediate release of Mate
Ramsey, an American seaman, of the
steamer Cambrian Monarch, .who was ar
rested several months ago at Callao on a
charge of disorderly conduct while ashore,
and has just been sentenced to one year in
jail.
The ground, for the demand , is that
Ramsey, was not treated. in accordance
with article XVI of our convention of 1870
-with Peru, which provided that citizens
of "either, country arrested in tbe other
".-ball in all; cases be brought before a
magistrate or other legal authority for
examination within twenty-four . hours
after arrest, and if not so* examined the
accused shall forthwith be discharged
from custody."
... These conditions were not fulfilled at
the time of 'Ramsey's arrest, and he was
kept locked up without examination for
a week despite the protests of the Consul,
* who was sustained by Secretary Olney..
The demand for bis release is now made
peremptorily, and Ramsey, will be vigor
ously r -backed by this Government for
damages against Peru. ,v:~\* v

WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â The
proceedings in the Senate to-day during
the hour of its open session. were of a
rather interesting character. In the first
place a resolution was introduced and
passed authorizing the Secretary of the
Navy to place a vessel of war and a char
tered merchant vessel at the disposal of
the Collector of the Port of New York for
transporting contributions of wheat, flour
and corn to relieve the famishing poor of
India. In the brief discussion to which
the measure gave rise, Stewart (Pop.) of
Nevada expressed the idea that the pe
riodical famines of India were trifles com
pared to the evils caused by the legisla
tion which destroyed the value of silver,
and Morgan (D.) of Alabama intimated
that he would within a few days intro
duce a similar measure for the purpose of
taking supplies to the island of Cuba and
Crete to feed the poor, miserable Ameri
cans penned up in the villages and towns
of Cuba, and the Cretans whom Great
Britain and the other powers were en
deavoring by starvation to force into sub
mission to tyrannical rule.
This episode was followed by the offer
ing 'of a resolution by Allen (Pop.) of
Nebraska on the subject of the reported
purpose 'by the Spanish Government to
try by drumhead court-martial and shoot
to death the Cuban general, Rivera, re
cently wounded in battle and captured.
The resolution declares it to be the duty
of the United States Government to pro
test to the Spanish Government against
such a violation of the rules of civilized
warfare. The resolution went over until
to-morrow under, an objection by Hoar
(R.) of Massachusetts, with the sarcastic
remark that he did not understand that
the power of life and death over persons on
either side of the contest in Cuba had
been committed to the United States Sen
, ate. Hoar added that if the two bouses of
Congress had not prodded and goaded
Spain by such absolutely futile and in
effective resolutions it would have been
much better for the cause of Cuba and
that such intemperate utterances had
been infinitely mischievous.
There were three other Cuban transac
tions in the * Senate before that
body â¢ went into executive session.
These were 'the " resolutions offered
I last Tuesday by \ Morgan as to the
i letters of Maximo, Gomez to .President
j Cleveland and. President McKinley end
i the resolution offered yesterday .by .Mills
I (D.) of Texas, to the obligations assumed
| by the United States" toward the people of
Cuba in asserting and maintaining the
right to prevent the* acquisition of the
island by a European power.
A joint resolution was introduced to
day by Morgan extending belligerent
rights to both the Spanish and Cuban
governments in the ports and territory of
i the United States. The two first were
j agreed to and the last went over until
i Monday. The Senate was in executive
; session from 1 to 5:15 p. m., when it ad
journed until Monday.
AMENDMENTS ARE MADE.
Ante the Senate Will Vote Upon the Ar
bitration Treaty.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â Not
content with its work yesterday, the Sen
ate to-day still further emasculated the
general treaty of arbitration with Great
Britain by striking out the eighth section
entirely and adopting an amendment by
Bacon, which is intended to protect the
Southern States from any claim based
upon securities issued during the recon
struction period. Several other minor
amendments were offered, but rejected,
with the exception of one or two imma
terial changes in the verbiage of the text.
The achate to-day was devoted almost
entirely to Bacon's amendment, that Sen
ator making an elaborate speech in- sup
port of his suggestion. Ii was antag
onized in an exhaustive speech by Lind
say, who discurseil the legal phase of the
case," and also by Gray. When tbe vote
was taken tbe amendment prevailed by a
majority of rive votes. It adds at the end
of article IV of the treaty a proviso
reading as follows: "No claims of a citi
zen of Great Britain against the State or
territory of the United States shall be
a subject for arbitration under this
treaty."
Bacon sought to amend the first article,
wherein it is agreed that all questions
tbat fail of adjustment by diplomatic ne
gotiations are to.be arbitrated, by add in
to the words "diplomatic negotiations"
the words "or by convention or treaty,"
is idea being that this was essential to a
full settlement of controversial questions.
It was voted down. Ia like manner the
Senate voted down Morgan's motion to
strike out article seven, which governs
objections that may-be made to the juris
diction of the arbitral tribunal. '
Hansbrougb withdrew his resolution,
mentioned in these dispatches last night,
for the reason that the amendments of
Senator Foraker, providing for a separate
court for each case submitted, met bis
contention that the ratification of the
treaty. 'would be unconstitutional before
the fixed and permanent character 'of the
court contemplated. "
On -motion of Rawlins article eight,
which .provides that the President may
appoint a judicial officer of a State or Ter
ritory as a member of the court in MMM
in which such State or Territory might be
concerned, was stricken out altogether.
- Tue remainder of the afternoon was
spent in laying upon the table immaterial
amendments which, were offered almost
without number. Davis pressed for a day
lor the vote,' but did not succeed. Chand
ler said that while he should probably vote
for the treaty he. did not care to vote on a
day when the British guns wero firing on
the Christians of the island of Crete and
seekinir to establish upon that island the
permanent rule of the Ottoman empire.
Chandler asserted that it would be well in
considering the treaty to also consider the
general , policy of Great Britain toward
the other nations of the earth.
Hale retorted that' what Great Britain
might do elsewhere should not be taken
into consideration her**. The nending
treaty was between the United States and
Great Britain alone, ana Hale ehided
Chandler for the lemarks he bad made.

nation as those who inhabited tbe island
ot Crete without expressing bis conviction
in relation to such conduct. He was un
able to look upon these matters in that
cold-blooded fa-hion peculiar to the Sena
tor from Maine.
Hale denied that he was, cold-blooded
and esserted that it was quite possible
that his blood was as easily stirred as was
that of Chandler.
The treaty is now beyond the amend
ment stage and when the Senate takes the
final vote it will be upon' tbe instrument
as now constructed.
â¢ The most important amendment is that
by Hoar and agreed to yesterday. It re
lates to article one, and* the precise lan
guage of that article is as follows :
â¢ "The high contracting parties agree to
submit to arbitration in accordance with
the provisions and subject to the limita
tions of this treaty all questions in differ
ence between them which they may fail
to adjust by diplomatic negotiations; but
no difference shall be submitte I under
this treaty which, in the judgment of
either power, materially affects its honor,
the integrity of. its territory, and its for
eign and domestic policy. Nor shall the
question bo submitted whetherany treaty,
once existing, should continue in force:
provided, that the agreement to submit;
with its formulations, shall in every case
beiore it becomes final be communicated by
the President of the Unite i States- to the
Senate, with his approval and. be con
curred in by two-thirds of the Senators
present, and shall also be approved by her
Majesty, the Queen of the United King

NO DANGER OF A. RATE WAR.
Railroads Adopt the Form of the New
Organization and a Feeling of
Security Exists.
CHICAGO, 111., April Executive
officers of Western railroads met to-day
with tueir passenger and freight officials
and adopted the form of organization
under which the roads will operate in con
formity with the trans-Missouri decision
of the Supreme Court. In the case of the
Freight Association, now to be called the
Western Freight Traffic Bureau, the agree
ment already published was adopted with
one exception, that relating to the ..power
given the B ard of Commissioners to fix
the division of throueb rates. The regu
lation substituted provides that each road
is to file with the commissioners its sched
ules of divisions of through rates. The
change was advised by the attorneys, who
believed that it would be violative of the
spirit of the anti-trust law for the board to
fix the percentages. The rest of tbe agree
ment really makes the bureau only an
organization for the collection and distri
bution of statistics as to rates, tonnage,
etc.,' for which work the Western roads
will pay out in salaries alone about $100,
--000. yyZHy
It is believed that some of the salaried
officers will find other positions soon, and
by resigning reduce the cost of the bureau
that much. '. The executive officers au
thorized the passenger men to prepare an
agreement, retaining the mileage and
clergy permit bureaus and incorporating
tbe statistical feature of the freight-bureau
agreement.
The new Dassengor . compact will . be
made operative alter approval of the at
torneys without another meeting of the
executive officers. It was decided to re
tain all the machinery, of the Western
Passenger Association, probably under
the same name, but Chairman Caldwell's
title will be changed to harmonize with
the spirit of the new decision.
All danger of ra:e demoralisation in the
WeÂ«t as a result of the dissolution of '
traffic associations for maintaining rates,
seems to hava passed away and a feeling
of general security exists. This condition
â¢ has been brought about by individual ac
tion on the part of the . president and
other officers of each* road interested.
Strict orders have been issued to contract
ing agents and others concerned that
under no circumstances or provocation of
competitors must the rate bo cut in order
to secure traffic aSiS
A violation of this order-. will result in
dismissal from the service. Loss of traffic
is to weigh as nothing against the mainte
nance of rates, and after such orders have
been issued no road can assume the re
sponsibility of being branded as rate
demoralizers, and freight agents will also
be careful of their reputations.

Arizona Wants Uncle. Sam to Prosecute
Red Men Guilty of Crime.
WASHINGTON. D. 6., April Lâ The
Legislative Assembly ot Arizona has pe
titioned Congress to take such action as
will result in the prosecution by tbe
Federal courts of . Indians committing
crimes against other Indians. Under the
existing law these Indians are subject to
the laws of the Territory, and, in conse
quence, the various counties have been so
burdened with debt in conducting tho-ie
prosecutions that in many of them tho
Boarus of Supervisors have refused to al
low the Sheriff and other peace officers to
arrest Indians, and thus crime has gone
unpunished.
The Legislature in its memorial says
that ttto jurisdiction concerning the trial
and conviction of Indians properly be
longs to the United States and that such
cases should be tried in the courts of the
United Slates. Some action is urgod.

McKinley Ignores Da Young's -
Pretensions. â¢
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â James
A. Waymire of Alameda was expected to
arrive in Washington .last night, but his
train was delayed. Inauiry at tbe hotels
to-night failed to locate him, although
everal members of the California delega
tion are eagerly awaiting his arrival. The
report that lie will be made Attorney-
General to succeed McKenna when the
latter succeeds Justice Field on the United
States Supreme bench seems to be with
out foundation. The Call correspondent
talked with several members of the Cali
fornia delegation to-night, who might
naturally be supposed to know the ambi
tion of Judge Waymire, and they ah said
that they had no knowledge of bis can
i didacy for the Attorney-Generalship.
The dispatch of last night to The Call
stated that Waymire wanted to be a
United Slates Judge, and the Californians
here think this is correct. He would like
to succeed McKenna as Circuit Judge, but
failing in this will ask for the District
Judgeship to succeed Morrow, if the
latter should be promoted. It is pretty
well settled, however, that Judge Morrow
will be made Circuit Judge and Morris M.
Estee District Judge.
. Judge Waymire may be rewarded for
his services to the party in some way, for
be is in close touch with Senator Mark
Hanna. It is 'possible that he may be
made one of the assistant attorney-gen-
erals. It is understood that the law part
ner of VV. H. H. Hart has written a letter
here in behalf of , Mr. Hart for Assistant
Attorney-General, and that several other
members of the California bar have done,
likewise, but in the opinion of the Califor
nians here Mr. Hart will not receive the
coveted appointment.
A California Republican who is in close
touch with the administration said to
The Call correspondent to-night that, in
bis opinion. California would not receive
much patronage beyond the appointments
that naturally belong to her, for Presi
dent McKinley in bis selection of Mc-
Kenna as a member of bis Cabinet feels
t at he has done a good deal for the State,
and in the elevation of McKenna to the
Supreme bench he will have still further
complimented the California Republi
cans. â¢ - . XyX 'â ''.
' Judge Waymire will not be appointed
to any i osition if Senator Perkins*, wishes
are regarded. It is well known in Cali
fornia that the two "gentlemen are no
longer. warm friends since the California
delegation fiflfced to Indorse Waymire for
a Cabinet position, and it is also well un
derstood that 'Waymire not only . held
Senator Perkins personally responsible
for this failure but accused him of. in
gratitude.
It -was definitely -settled to-day that
John P. Jackson will be appointed Col
lector of the Port of San Francisco and
Joseph S. 8 near of San Francisco Sur
veyor of the Port. â  The probable appoint
ment of Mr. Spear was exclusively tele
graphed The Call on Tuesday. Mr. Spear
visited the Washington office of The Call
to-night and confirmed, the report that he
bad been selected for the surveyors hip.
Mr. Spear, -although originally a candi
date for 'the collectorship, feels that be
has been highly honored. Tbe place pays
$5000 per annum. The term of the incum
bent does not expire until next November.
It is understood that Mr. Spear realized
that he could not be appointed Collector
against tho protest of Senator Perkins and
asked for the next best thing. Senator.
Perkins* was determined that his friend
JacKson should have the collectorship, and
having won his point he is quite willing
that Spear shall have the surveyorship,
inasmuch as President McKinley ex
pressed a desire to reward Spear in some
way. The, President remembers that
Spear as a delegate to the Minneapolis
convention in 1892 voted for his nomina
tion lor President, and also knows ,how
hard he worked for his nomination in 1896.
Mr. Spear and wife will remain in the East
for two weeks, making snort trips to Fort
ress Monroe and Atlantic City before re
turning to San Francisco.
The nomination of William F. Draper
of Massachusetts to be Embassador to
Italy was also exclusively wired to The
Call two weeks ago. . This disposes of the
ambition of Mr. De Young, who was
anxious to go to Rome. His best friends
here do not know whether the gentleman
will ask for anything else at the hands of
the administration. - Mr. de Young is now
in New York.
Colonel John P. Irish is yet in Wash
ington. It. seems to be conceded that he
will 'be allowed to serve out his term as
Naval Officer, and it is not impossible that
he will be appointed for a new term. If
he is not reappointed William B. Hamil
ton witl get this $5000 job. â¢
The Caiitornians here do not entertain
i for a moment the possibility that Colonel
| Harrison Gray Otis of the Lot Angeles
Times will accept the post of < Consul-
General to Calcutta, which it is under
stood has been tendered him by the
President.
Nothing has been beard lately of ex-
Representative Johnson's candidacy for
Solicitor-General of the Department of
Justice, although be announced to several
iriends in Congress before his departure
that he would like to have this appoint
ment.
Ex-Representative McLachlan lingers
in Washington ostensibly to represent
Southern California fruit-growers in tbeir
efforts to secure protection for their prod
ucts, but he has .not yet abandoned his
hope of securing an appointment.
It is understood thai Representative
Loud has not yet decided who he will
recommend -for: Postmaster at Ban Fran
cisco, as' Mr. McCoppin has yet a long
while to serve.

Dingleii Tariff in Â»w York XX. Â»â 
NEW YORK, N. Yâ April I.â The re _
was a great rush yesterday to pay duties
at v the Custom-house. Importers' bad
heard that tbe dew Dingley tariff bill was
to be in effect from April 1, and tbey
wanted to obtain tit* benefit of the lower
duties under the Wilson law. The total
receipts were 1,726,453, and of this the
sum of $1,268,232 represented duties on
goods withdrawn* from bond, leaving the
amount of duties -on direct importations
at $453,220. The duties raid were mostly
on woolens and tobacco. The receipts at
the New York Custom-hou'e for the
month of March were $17,579,633. They
were exceeded in any month only once
before in the history of the Government.
In- August, 1372, aft a alO per centre
auction in the tariff, they were $19,336,000.
In July, 1890, just before the McKinley
bill went into effect, the duties paid
amounted to $17,243,864. Deposits yester
day in the sub-treasury for which certifi .

At Fargo the situation is growing more
serious. The river is rising four inches

nothing encouraging along the river front
to-day. People are fleeing for their lives.

NASSAU, N. P.. April I.â The British
cruiser Partridge, Captain Hanigan com
manding, reports that on Sunday last he
rived upon ' a suspicious vessel that re
sembled the old filibuster Bermuda. The
Partridge started on a cruise on March 25
and early Sunday morning sighted the
steamer, which she at first thought was a
West Indian fruiter. â¢ The vessel . refused
to show her colors and the Partridge
fired two .blank shots and then a
solid shot at the steamship. The range
was too long for the shot to be effective
and the cruiser started in pursuit. The
cruiser being the slower vessel the sus
picions steamship escaped. '.--. X
The Partridge returned to Watlings
Island to look after a schooner that was
with the steamship,' but she, too, had
escaped. It. is supposed the vessels were
part of a filibustering expedition that
started from Nassau to Cuba. The Part
ridge will leave again to-day for another
search after them.

GUATEMALA, March 10.â The open

gloriously. fine and the parade in connec
tion with the opening of the exhibition

occasion. -.
President Barrios arrived at the main
exhibition building about noon and was
escorted to a seat in the State gallery re

MUST FISH H ITHOUT FIXES.
Xesofoundland Enforces the f.mr Against
French Pis her mess.
.. ST. JOHNS, N. F., April I.â The Gov
ernment announces its aggressive policy
against French fishermen. It will strictly
enforce the coast fisheries act, which for
bids tbe seining of herring for bait before
the middle of May. This will destroy the
French vessels' chances of obtaining early
bait and will badly cripple their first voy
age to the great * banks. The American
fishing vessels are also necessarily injured
somewhat by the proposed enforcement,
as they will now be able only to procure
herring taken with nets, which is a tedious
operation, besides costing them three
timei as much as by the former method.
The captain of; the Gloucester schooner
Levi Morton, which is now at Sound
Island. Placentia Bay, has wired the Fish
eries Department asking permission to
sefne herring, but the request was refused.
The revenue cruiser Fiona has been dis
patched to see that the new ations
are strictly enforced.

CHICAGO, 111., April 1. â Woman's
higher education was notably exemplified
within the walls of the auditorium to
night, on the occasion of the quarterly
convocation of the University of Chicago.
On the initiation of William H. Harper
the unprecedented honor of delivering the
convocation address was given to a woman,
and an English woman, the Countess of
Aberdeen, wife ,of the Governor-General
of Canada, both of whom are well and' fa
vorably known here because of their work
in the interest of Irish industries and
Irish people at the World's Fair.
Lady Aberdeen's audience numbered
5000 men and women. ' She delivered a
thoughtful * address on "The University
and Its Effect on the Home." . The Coun
tess was received with a ripple of applause
as she entered by the side of President
Harper, who read a telegram of regret
from the Eari of Aberdeen.
Lady Aberdeen began by remarking up
on the day, adding tbat on account of the
unusual honor accorded her she had asked .
herself whether or not.#he was the presi
| dent's April Fool day joke. She then re
ferred to tbe : ' irreparable loss which the
world had suffered in the death of Profes
sor Henry Drummond, who had been one
of her predecessors at the convocation ex
ercises. ' Continuing, Lady Aberdeen
said : | t â¢ '.*â 
"The home has not reaped that harvest
from the benefits of university education
which might have been expected it might
have claimed for its share. The average
home is not yet fitted to get all the possi
ble good from a university education. I
am told that one reason for the non-suc
cess of the university students is tnat they
come unprepared for such training as they
get in our universities. They come and
gather knowledge rather tnan culture.
They do not gain truÂ» culture nor scholar
ship. â¢ They learn at home on their return
from college that persons and not things
are talked about; that newspapers and nOt
books are the 'staple things and that the
material hard things and not ideas are the
chief objects to be pursued.
"The whole face of social life and phil
anthropy has been transformed, by the
rigbtful position accorded in recent years
te women in the . sphere, of â  education.
Women found their usefulness. They
have developed tne -heart and mind of
woman. They have taugnt her to value
the difference between despotic and dem
ocratic government; to trust in and sup
port one another. The women movement
in this country has had ample scope to
develop and mature itself. Man was not
born to live alone and still less was
woman. It may be' well enough to have a
council of mothers, but do tbe fathers
count for so little in the home that their
council is not needed ? The revival of tha
home must be the new watchword, not
the narrow, cold, selfi>h home, but one in
which the family must be the loving cen
ter of mutual help and from which all
healthy influences- must flow. A univer
sity which omits this not fro.m its ideal
will indeed deserve of its country and of
the world."

HuyriAoiox AX It armor plate.
Said to Re Interested in Big Factory
for 'Aeszport JStxts.
NEW, YORK, N. V., April 1.- A Press
special from Norfolk, Vs., says:
A well-authenticated rumor to the effect
that Col lis P. Huntington and a company
of English and American capitalists
shortly will establish at Newport News a
large ordnance and armor plate factory is
beipg given wide circulation here, and it
is accepted as true here.
Huntington, accompanied by a number
of capitalists, , recently went over -the
ground, and, it is said, selected a site for
the mammoth 'enterprise near the ship
building plant in which he is largely in
terested. This company is now building
several battfr-ships, and wilt bid for more
when the opportunity offers, y
The construction of the armor factory,
therefore, would give it it tremendous ad
vantage over any other ship-but ding con
cern . in America. .' It is stated that the
capital of the concern will bo between
$3,000,000 and $5,000,000, half of which, will
come from abroad.
Newport News is peculiarly well situ
ated for the manufacture of armor -plate,
which is a mixture of Virginia and Cuban

Mere Fids in Connection With, the
Caminetti Bill and the G:v
ernrr's Veto.
:â¢ SACRAMENTO, Cat.., April I.âAssem
bly bill No. 977, better known as the
Bridgford bill, which yesterday received
the approval of the Governor and will
therefore become the law of the state, is
almost if not quite identical with Assem
bly bill No. 273, introduced by Assembly
man Caminetti, about which the Exam
iner attempted to create a storm of indig
. nation. The same principle runs through
both bills, viz.: - '"'
That a litigant is entitled to a trial be
fore a lair and impartial Judge.
The Examiner assailed Assembly bill
273 as a "vicious measure" and repeatedly
denominated it as an "infamous bill." It
has paraded the unsupported assertion
that governor Budd vetoed it because it
was vicious and infamous, when as a
matter of fact in his message refusing his
approval thereto he makes use of the fol
lowing language:
â¢ "Acts which provide for the disqualifica
tion of a prejudiced or biased Judge are in
operation in other States, and any proper
legislation which will relieve a .litigant
from the necessity of having his case tried
before a Judge who is biased or prejudiced
against him, or who has a fixed opinion
on the case, 'is; desirable and praise
worthy." ; z c 'â¢'
,The Governor's reasons for his veto are
based on objections he sets forth in his
message, s-ucu as that it was not definite
enough as to the affidavit required nor as
to the time of filing, nor did it provide for
countet-affidavits. After conferring wan
the author (Mr. Caminetti) and other
members it was concluded, says the Gov
ernor in his message, that a new bill
could be passed which would be free from
the objections to which '273 was open and
which would at the' same time permit a
litigant to legally object to a prejudiced
and biased Judce.
.The Bridgford bill was introduced Feb
ruary 26, long before 273 was sent to the
Governor. The amendments suggested
by the Governor were made, and the
Bridgford bill passed the House and Sen
ate, notwithstanding tbe storm the Exam
iner was try ing to create. It went to the
Governor in due time,, and, as. stated
above, in accordance with his message,
has received bis approval. â¢ â â â¢â  i ."..':': â¢.'-.â¢.'.â  - ..
So that comparisons may be maje, and
the unfounded statements c. tne Exam
iner, that 273 was vicious and infamous,
may be exposed' as deliberate falsehoods,
Lota 273 end 977 are given as follows.

follows :
Section* 1. Section 53 of the Code of Civil

amended to read as follow .- :
. Sec. 53. The Supreme Court may affirm, re

peal was taken.
Sec. 2. This act shall take effect from and

'Judge Dibble surprise! the House by
announcing that this bill applied to the
Hale it Norcross case aeainst Hayward,
bow pending on appeal in the Supreme |
Court, where the company had a separate ;
judgment for $203,000, and desired the j
passage of this bill so that an execution
could be issued against the defendants. I

adopted, adding the following to the bill: !

.Mr. Baggett felt no further interest in
the bdl after that, and it was allowed to

Reference is now made in this matter
fo show that the Examiner made no at
tack on this attempt to tit a case it and its
attorney are interested in. It must be <
remembered that Mr. Baguett appeared
for the Examiner before the Judiciary
Committee of the Hou?e against the
Bridgford bill, while he was at the same
time working for bill 700. y â  *
0 In all serionsness it looks as though an
attack -was made 273; so as to rnsn
through 700 in the excitement caused by
the unwarranted charges made by the
Examiner. Two hundred and seventy
three could only apply to the Hale
Norcross suit en two events happening
first, reversal of the j judgment by the
Supreme Court; and second, that Juige
Hebbard is biased or prejudiced against
Hayward, while 700 applied directly and
specifically to that suit in favor of the

ACTS WHICH FAIL
TO BECOME LAWS
Governor Budd Strikes Out
State Printing Appro
. priations.
Bills for Improving the State
. Capitol Meet Executive
Objection.
, Full Reasons for These and Als Legis
â  lative Measures That Received
a Black Eye.. ' C
- SACRAMENTO, April I.â The act
making appropriations for the support of
the government of the State of California
; for the forty-uinth and fiftieth fiscal years
â¢has received the signature of Governor
Budd, with. important exceptions. "* .
.-â¢ The first of these* is the "sum recom
mended for 'boring well, setting stand
pipes, .tanks'*' and laying pipes in the
Capitol grounds, and among the most im
portant i? his disapproval of the appropri
ation of $6000 for the salary of the super
intendent of State printing. Following
are the Governor's reasons in full:
Executive Department, State of Cau-'
. foema, Sacramento, April 1, 1397. j
This bill, being Assem nly bill 937, entitled
i ."An act making appropriations lor the sup
j port of the government of the State of Califor
, nia for the forty-ninth and fiftieth fiscal
j years," is approved with the exception of the
j following items, io which I object, and the
I following are my objections thereto and the
! seasons therefor, to wit: '
.Objection Iâ l object to the Item, "for lor
â  ing well, setting stand pipe, tanks and laying
j pipe* in Capitol ground*, $S<X)O." for* the
following reasons, viz.: This item' is ob
-1 jected to and not approved for the reason
I that it is not sustained by existing laws,
is a permanent improvement, is not expressed
I in the act, and is in violation of sections 24
j and 29, ; article IV, Â»of the constitution oi
( this State. The" appropriation could have
j been made by special act. It such
J items be allowed in the general appropria
; tion bill the special appropriation act may be
1 done away with; and the general appropria
! tion bill loaded with appropriations for per
j manent Improvements to State institutions,*
and not subserve the purpose for which it is
I intended by the constitutionâ to provide
solely for "support." Were the items mere re-
I pairs they would be allowable.
j Objection 2â "'For purchasing and placing
j in position" electric plant, including three
; pumps and three motors, $2500." This item
j is objected to and not approved for the reasons
; given in objection first, in objecting to the
j item last above disapproved.
Objection The item "for extra help neces
sary for the caring of the State Capitol build
! ing, including extra firemen, engineers, elec
tricians, elevator attendants, watchmen, por
ters and all other, such necessary extra help
during the thirty-second session of the Legis
lature, to be expended under the direction ol
the Secretary of State, $3000." y ; *,
This item is objected to and not approved for
the reason that the same is unnecessary, un
authorized and Indefinite. Such expenses
have heretofore been paid out of the appro
nations for the contingant expenses of the
egislature. ' Â«* . â *â *
j Objection The item, "for salary of State
j Librarian, six thousand dollars," is objected
to and not approved for the reason that the
j support, ol the Sate library* is * provided
I for by special . fund set apart- as the
s ''library fund," which fund is not sustained
j or applied by taxes, but from fees collected
j for services Tendered or property sold by
certain State officers, said fund being for
s the maintenance of the library, there Is no
i more reason why the same should be exempt
ed from the payment of the salary of the Li
brarian than from the payment ot the
; other expenses ol the HoraTy," and un
j less there be some provision of jaw which I
I have not yet seen prohibiting the" payment
I of such salary from such fund, and requiring
j its payment by an appropriation. I believe the
Librarian should first look to the library fund
for his salary. The custom has heretofore been
to make appropriations lor these salaries, but
after careful consideration my -conclusion is
s that the.library fund roust maintain the li-
I brary or a special, act ol the Legislature pro
; vide otherwise. *
Objection sâ The. ltem "for salary .of two
; Deputy State Librarians $7200" is objected
i to and not approved for the reasons given in
. objection 4 to the it.-m for the salary of the
State Librarian, and such objections are made
I a part of this objection.
Objection oâ The Item "for salirvof porter
j of State Librarian's office $2400" "is objected
j to and not approved for the reasons eiven in
; the last two objections, and said objections
! are made a part hereof and constitute my ob
:| jections to this item. *
f. Objection 7â The item 'for salary of Paper
i intendent of State Printing $0000" is ob-'
: jected to and not approved for the reason that
< the same will be paid under, the general law
â¢of the State, though not appropriated
:by this . act, and because lis elimi-
I nation is necessary to render futile
; the attempt made by* the amendment, to
section 5 of this act 'to confer upon a majority
of the Board of Examiners a power whicn for
j years past, through an unbroken succession of
; appropriation acts, has been conferred only
! upon the entire board. Such attempted
change in the law can only apply in the case*
j of departments, officers, boards and institu
! lions, "for whose benefit and support appro
j priations are made in this act."
The evident purpose of the change ln section
five was to render it possible to preven - "* â¢
, Governor from exercising some of his c
: tutlonal powers and to prevent his v.
I member of the Board of Lxa*
! on what he mighty deem Â«*n nnm... ... ,
expenditure of public money, or an lm
, I proper discharge of duty by a subordinate
officer. There can be no doubt that the con
troversy, between the State Printing and
] the chief executive of the State has led certain
political opponents to cunningly incorporate
â  into the general appropriation bill during the
i closing days of an excited session this most
! unusual provision, and the executive of the
I State deems It his duty, in order to maintain
j his constitutional right and discharge his ob
i ligations to the public, to prevent the injur
ous operations of this clause oi the general
appropriation bill. Had the attempt been
made by a separate bill it could never
I have been enacted, but being Insjrted
iin the general appropriation bill
I it was evidently tnonght that the Governor
must acquiesce therein, reject the entire bill
I and call an extra session of the Legislature to
! provide for the support of all the State insti
: tutions, or perhaps submit to being overruled
j as to all matters of deficiency and difference
that might arise between himself and the State
, Printing Office. The author of the change,
j however, in making the same overlooked the
clause, "for whose benefit and support appro
! priations are ma te In this act,". and has thus
; given -the Governor the power, without any
damage to any State institution, of
i preventing the accomplishment of the
design intended. The injustice of the
proposition Intended to be grafted on the
laws by such a clause will be clean v seen
j when it is. considered that the constitution
| vests iv the Governor the power to object to
; any legislative bill, rfo matter what
, appropriation *it may carry, and that
I under the constitution his objection can
1 be only, overcome by a vote of two-thirds
; of the members elected to each branch of the
1 Legislature, and that the constitution, recog
: nizing that when the Legislature had closed
itÂ«vssion the Governor should be the one
official charged with passing . upon the
i appropriations for Slate Institutions
! and laws- passed by the Legislature,
, and has conferred on . him also the
j absolute power to strike from any appropria
j tion bill any item of expenditure, or by Ms
j objection thereto to prevent any measure,
, even though it may have received the unani-
I mous vota, of both houses, from becoming
j law, provided it did not reach the Governor
; upward of ten- days prior to the adjourn
| ment of . the â¢ Legislature, vet here is
an attempt to reacn beyond the Legislature
! and permit deficiencies ia my amount after
1 its adjournment, by a' board created under
; statute, and to prevent the veto power of the
Governor from having effect, and giving to a
majority of this board a power denied by the
constitution to the Legislature itself.
"Under the circumstances, 1 deem St mv duty
to eliminate all appropriations for the depart
ment. In whose behalf this clause was in
serted, and over which 'I nave no proper
power of control, and- whicn powers, tnough
promised by the committee of the legislature
appointed to confer with the Board of Exam
iners, were never given.
No barm can be done ,by this elimination
for each department o- the State can, in case
of necessity, out of.it appropriation pay for
such printing as Its has done at the State
Printing Office or elsewhere, and if they
did not have such power there -Is no doubt
tort under the act of 1893 (statutes 1893. p.
285) a deficiency could be created in their con
tingent or other fund; or for the support* of
the State Printing Office," that would author
ize all of the State printing necessary.
Objection Bâ The item "for support of State
Printing Office, including pay â  of ' employes,
purchasing supplies, type, machlnerv, perma
nent material and for Improvements, eta; ex
empt from the provisions of . section
4 of this act, $275,000," v is "objected
to and not approved; firs', because ' the
same is excessive; second, for the reasons
given ia the objection to the item for the sal
ary of the Superintendent of State Printing,
which objection is hereby - referred to, and
made a part hereof, and third, for the reasons
stated in objections two and three hereof, to
the items for boring wells.etc, "for purchasing
and placing in position - electric plant, etc,"
which objections are hereby referred to and
made a part hereof; and because the same is
in violation of sections. 24 and 29. article IV,
or the constitution; fourth, because said items
are not segregated, and it is Impossible to tell
therefrom what amount of said appropriation
is for the purpose ot, or would be expended in
the purchase of, machinery and -permanent
material and for Improvements, all of which
items should be provided for by a special bill
and not included in a lump sum in a bill lor
the support of any one office.
Another and very serious objection is the
principal one made in my veto message of
February 9 last. This is one of the very larg
est appropriations made by the State. I have
been convinced In the past that extravagance
has been practiced in its expenditure. The
experts appointed by the Legislature reported
many irregularities. They reported tnat no
separate umebooks were "kept" by which the
cost of schoolbooks can be ascertained, or
which would prevent the use of fchoolbook
money for other Sute printing; that no proper
stockbook is kept by which the condition or
value of stock on hand can be determined; that
inexperienced help Is employed .at great loss,
and the experts report that if certain reforms
were instituted in the management of tbe
Office a saving of from $15,000 to $20,000 an
nually would result to the State. The
Superintendent of State .' Printing has
failed to make to me the reports required by
law, and has made reports which were mis
leading and from which it appeared that it
required $146,000 to do $94,000 worth of
work. This condition of things has never
been satisfactorily explained, and the experts,
after allowing him many credits not claimed
in his report, still found a balance of $21,000
for which no proper F showing could be made.
No proper or adequate system of auditing the
Claims train*! this great appropriation exists,
and the Board of Examiners have no means of
determining whether such claims so presented
to them are proper or correct. . ,'
I Mated for some legislation to remedy this
loose system of accounts, a board of printing
auditors, power for the Board of Examiners to
employ and pay a printing expert to inform I
them as to the nature or accuracy of accounts
which taey were called upon to allow or other I
preper safeguards, but no such enactments
were made.' On the contrary the only exist- i
ing power I possessed to keep that office at j
least within the limits of its appropriation !
was taken from me, as shown in objection, ]
and as I have now no control over this de- |
partment.- and as the Legislature has not seen,
fit to check its expenditure*, i cannot sanction
the enactment of this item.
Objection 9â The item "For school text-book
department, pay of employes and for stock and
material, $40,000, subject to the provisions
of an act entitled 'An act to provide j
for compiling, Illustrating, electrotyp
ing, printing, binding, copyrighting and
distributing certain books of a State j
series of school textbooks and appropriating
money therefor, approved March* 18, 1887, j
and the same is hereby exempted trom the j
provisions of section 4 oi this act," is objected
to and not approved for the reasons given for j
objecting to tne two preceding items, as set out
in objection hereof, which said objections and J
reasons are made a part hereof, and ior the i
further reason .that it is an attempt. through !
gem-rat appropriation bill to leglslate'on the i
subject contained in said item, and for. the |
lurther reason that said item 'is in violation I
of article IX, section 71, of the constitution, i
A study of the subject has led to the conclu- â 
sion that money appropriated for text-book |
. purposes under said article of the constitution i
should be appropriated to be expended by and !
under the direction and control of a . State |
Board of Education solely. .-
Another reaioff for my objection is tbat this j
item requires the appropriation it carrier ;
snail be expended subject to the provisions of j
a' certain act which cannot be located as de- j
scribed. The act nearest in description to the
act described is not properly applicable to the j
"purposes intended by this item. It provides for ,
the compiling, illustrating, etc.. of only a |
limited number of the State series of school |
textbooks, leaving many to be provided tor in :
other acts, and is otherwise . inapplicable. .
The constitution provides .that the' State i
schoolbooks . shall be sold at cost
and the fund from .which the expense
of * their preparation and production
is paid should be -oelf-sus tain ing. As there is
now money in this'fund and a large number
ox books on hand, the necessary sew ones can
be prepared aud printed from the sums re
suiting from the sale of these books, and no
interference with the printing of necessary
school books will result from the disapproval
of this item. â¢;*-..
' Objection 10â The item "for support of Vet
erans' Home at Youniville. $90,000," is ob- j
jected to and not approved for the sole reason '
that a like sum is- provided for as a continu
ing appropriation by another law of the State, i
being the act of 1893 (statutes 1893, p. 214), |
and the allowance oi tnis amount ln the gen- i
eral appropriation bill Is therefore unneces- j
sary, and would constitute a double appro- j
priation.
Objection 11â item "for the claim for '
Marin County for moneys expended by it for
prosecutions Of crime committed within the j
state Prison at San Quentin $4229 50" is ob- \
jected to and not approved on the ground that j
said item is in violation ot article IV, section :
29, of the constitution, and is not proper '
claim in the general appropriation bill. ..
Objection 12â The item, "for purchase of
material and construction of fencing the ice '
plant and enlarging cow barn, Preston School
"l Industry, two thousand six hundred dol- j
lars," is objected to and not approved for' the i
reasons given in objections first and
second hereof," which objections aj-e hereby
made my objections to this item. I was first
inclined to believe this Item correct, but a :
'study of the snbjeet bas convinced me that ft <
haÂ« no place in this bill.
Objection 13â The Item, "for support of I
Santa Clara State School, $35,000." is ob- j
jected to and not approved because said '
school was not established.
Objection 14 â The, item, "for use of |
State University department of viticulture i
$10,000." and the item, "for use of !
State University forestry stations $8000," â 
and the item, "for State University de- i
partment of agriculture for experimental '.
â¢urposea relative to tbe diseases, breeding '
nd other necessary information connected I
vith the raising and card of chickens in this j
State, and the issuance of bulletins concern
ing same, $5000," are each objected to and
not approved, and each is objected to and !
not approved for the reasons," first, tbat
lb* same are excessive, and second, - whatever .
allowance may be necessary in the judgment
of the regents of the University of the State"
of California, can be made from -the other
funds of the said university.
During the past two years the State bas lib- ;
erally responded to the requests of ihe Uni
versity, giving in 1895 a quarter of a million ;
dollars for its affiliated- colleges and so pro
viding for the University itself by the
act of 1897 that it shall receive !
2 cents pe"r â¢ annum on every I
$100 of taxable property la this State, j
being annually nearly another quarter of a j
million of dollars. In my judgment, with
.this annual income, together -with the income i
from the regular funds now . on | hand, no fur- i
ther provision should be asked tor by that insti- !
tution. under existing financial conditions i
â it is the duty of the 'university to use such
earetal economy as will make its present '
available resources sufficient for the conduct ,
of such of its departments and stations as in j
the judgment of the regents it may be neces- i
sary to maintain. Â» â  â 
Objection 15â The item, "for aid to District!
Agricultural Society No. 1, $10,000," is ob
jected to and not allowed for tne reasons here
tofore - given in my * bbl *ctions to sim
ilar appropriations in 1895, and for tbe
reasons stated in my inaugural address, and
in my first biennial message. - The aggregate j
of these appropriations is so great that,- in \
view of the present financial condition of our [
people, it would be inadvisable to burden
them with so heavy a tax as -would!
be .required to raise . this v sum. If
the number of districts bad been s ma
terially reduced and- the appropriations
correspondingly so, it would present a differ
ent case. To select a few districts, as now con
stituted and provided for, from -the whole
number would be discriminating and other
wise Inadvisable, and 1 have no other recourse
but to disapprove of all items for aid to dis
trict agricultural societies.'.

BORREGO GANG
TO HANG TO-DAY
No Further Respite for the
Four New Mexico
Assassins.
In Tears They Hear Their
Doom Pronounced and Seek
Relief in Prayer.
Extraordinary Precautions Are Taken
to Circumvent Any Attempt
at Rescu?.
SANTA FE, N. Mex.,* April 1. -For the
first time during their long confinement
the Borrego assassins relinquished all
hope of clemency at noon to-day, when
Sheriff Kinsell read to them a copy of At
torney-General McKehna's message to
â¦Governor Thornton announcing the Presi
dent's decision of no further interference.
Pale and trembling and in tears the
doomed men took to their prayer-books. *
At 3 o'clock the Sheriff admitted to the
large cell occupied by the prisoners their
â wives and children and a few near rela
tives, and for two hours tbe trying ordeal
of saying farewell continued. This is the
third time these women and children have
gone through this sad conference.
The prisoners have been in custody
since January, 1394,' have been thrice sen
tenced and twice tbeir sentences have
been commuted. They will be executed
at 9 o'clock to-morrow in the jail yard in
the presence of about twenty witnesses.
The scaffold, which has been covered with
canvas to obstruct tbe views of the curi
ous wbo may mount the flat roofs of the
adjacent houses, is within thirty feet of
the cell they now occupy.
To circumvent any attempt at rescue
the militia is on guard to-night, and tbe
Governor has ordered both the cavalry
troops and the infantry to report to
Sheriff. Kinsell for duty at 7 A. M. to
morrow. . -
The decision of President McKinley is
received with much satisfaction among
supporters of law and order in the Terri
tory, and taKen in connection with the
previous findings of the Supreme Court
and Mr. Cleveland has served to remove
all possible* political taint from toe case
and will have a salutary effect upon the
lawless element. * -
Frank Borrego told his wife that he had
made peace with his God and all mankind
and was "prepared to die with bis lips
sealed as to all be knew of the crime. He
had prepared a written statement to
be ..' read from the scaffold, but
decided to destroy Â« it, as its
contents referred to men more or
less prominent in public life, and. he did
not wish to leave the 300 Kinsmen of him
self and associates any pretext for resort
ing to vengeance in future upon those he
would necessarily have to name.
. Borrego also directed, his wife as to the
care of his body and that of his brother,
Antonio, and his kinsman, Lauriano
Alarid. He said they were to be taken
home and kept side] by. side.. till Sunday
morning next, when they must be buried
in the clothing ill which they were exe
cuted and in coffins furnished by tne
county. .**-â¢ X

nation of Â« x"-Sberiff Chavez is said to have
killed and'robbed two men in the streets
here in 1886 and 1883, and also made a

I -STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
" I.â The University of California baseball
%â¢ team was defeated by the Santa Clara
College team on Stanford's diamond this
a . afternoon by a score of sto 3. The game
| was a fine exhibition of baseball, with but
a total of three errors, two of which*were
â¢L made by the winning team. Santa Clara
M made her runs in two innings. Berkeley
m was unable to score up to the last half of
the ninth inning. By some well-played
hits they brought three over the home
* . base. * , .*
. Kelly pitched his usual good game for
. the victorious team. Up to the last inning
but three hits were made off* his delivery.
The college boys got five more hits in the
ninth, however. He struck out four men
. and gave one man his base on balls. .
Connor. Bride, Leake, Garnettand King
. ' \ also played "excellent ball for the Santa
Clara nine." King accepted in fine style
â¢I . two "difficult flies in center field, which
called forth .merited applause from the
'audience. King and Hoag of Berkeley
carried off the honors in fielding.
Kaarsberg pitched for the University of
I California. He is not noted for speed, but
he has several effective curves, his "drop"
being especially puzzling. Seven hits
were scored' against him.' Both sides
would have got more base hits had not. the
pitchers been given' excellent' support.
Kaarsberg struck out two men and gave
three their "'base on balls. He made one
wild pitch. .Wheeler of last year's* Varsity
team, caught him in good shape. He
made several pretty throws to second.
*. "Hennessey, who has just recovered from
a sprained ankle, played first base. He
understands the position well, but was
: . rather weak at the bat. '
By Santa Clara winning this game the
four team's of the league are put on a level.
It is difficult (o draw a comparison between
Stanford and Berkeley at present, as Stan
ford defeated the team that bat Berkeley
* V to-day and the Olympic team won from
Stanford, who in turn was defeated by
Berkeley^ The teams were made up as

LOS ANGELES STEAMER SERVICE.
Line to Be Established Between That City
and Lower California and Mexi
can Forts.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. April I.â After
much discussion and a voluminous corre
spondence upon the subject by leading
merchants of this city and its three com
mercial organizations, Los Angeles it
seems is to enjoy regular freight steamer
transportation with Lower California on
the same terms as San Francisco. In fact,
tuis city has already commenced this
trade, and three weeks ago made a ship
ment of about 130 tons of merchandise,
purchased here, from San Pedro to Ensen
ada. -The shipment was made by schooner.
Hereafter these shipment will.be made by
the regular steamers of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company.
The Pacific CoasvSteamship Company
runs a regular monthly steamer from San
Francisco down the coast as far as Mazat
lan, but the company has never been
willing to matte a 'stop at a Los Angeles
port, there being no established trade
irom here. The only way in which ship
ments could, be made from tbis. city -to
Mexican ports was tp send merchandise
to San Francisco and then reship from
there. Of course it was impossible to
build up a trade or maintain' one under
â such conditions. '
'Recently S. B. Hvnes, general manager
of the Terminal Railway Company, nas
been giving this matter of Mexican trade
some very close attention; and to his
efforts rather than to any other cause is
to be .credited the favorable result ob
tained.- It came to Mr. Hynes'- attention
that Senor H. Moorkens, a member of the
State Council of Lower California and an
extensive commission -merchant at En
senada and San Quintin. would purchase
a considerable quantity of goods in Los
Angeles if he could land them in Lower
California without greater cost to him
than if purchased in San Francisco.
Moorkens ascertained that he could do so,
and thus the business was launched, and
promises to be a great success.

Republican for $25,000 was called in the
United States Court this morning and con
tinued until l Tuesday. Rev. Johnson is
the evangelist who caused a sensation in
Fresno some time ago. The Republican
stated that Johnson bad made slanderous
statements regarding the virtue of Fresno
young women, which -statements,* he as

publication being the foundation of the
present suit. The same state of facts exists

CONSTERNATION ON
THE PHILADELPHIA
The Cruiser Is Ordered to
. Proceed at Once to
Honolulu.
Japanese on Sugar Plantations
in Deadly Corfl With
the Natives.
Officers of th Flagship Had Been An
ticipating a Season of Fes
tivity.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., April About half
past 3 o'clock this afternoon a launch
pulled alongside the flagship Philadelphia
to where she was lying off the Coronado
wharf and a few minutes later 'Admiral
Bsardslee was reading a cipher dispatch
from the Secretary of the Navy, which,
being interpreted, gave orders to coal up
and take provisions and equipment imme
diately, enough to. last six months, and
proceed with all dispatch for Honolulu at
the earliest possible date.
. The order created consternation aboard
the flagship. Many of the officers had
been looking forward with pleasurable
anticipation to at least a three weeks' stay
at San Diego before going north to join
in : the Golden Gate Carnival festivities,
which open May 3. . Captain Cotton had
all his trunks packed and was ready to
leave for .the East, and the command of
the Philadelphia was to be turned over to
a junior captain for the time, but now he
will proceed to Honolulu; with his vessel.
Chaplain Edmuudson is in a peck of
trouble. His wife was to meet him here,
and to-night be wired her to stay where
she was, for the present at least, only to
receive an answer that she was already on
her way here.
Tonight the stewards, purchasing and
equipment officers are busy laying in
stores and supplies for the cruise, and in
the morning at 8 o'clock the Philadelphia
will begin taking on 800 tons of coal from
the Spreckels bunkers. The vessel needs
some slight overhauling and ought to re
ceive a coat of paint, but- these matters
will be put off for the present. She will
sail Wednesday morning and expects to
reach Honolulu four days later, on
the llth.
The officers are very reticent concerning '
the orders received, but it was learned to
night that there bas been an insurrection
of the Japanese on one of Mr. Spreckels'
big sugar plantations and that several na
tives have been killed within, the past ten
days. The Philadelphia being the fastest
warship on the Pacific Coast, as well as
tise most available, has been therefore
probably selected, to protect American in
terests on the island.; -

DOUBLE WEIIDISG OF CELESTIALS
Judge Smith Ties the Knots, Aided by an
Interpreter. . â¢Â»
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. April Lâ With
the aid of a Chinese interpreter .Judge
Smith united in marriage Won? Sal Fee
and Hung Yet Tor and Wong Kirn and
Chow Fung this noon. The Juuge asked
the couple to join tbeir right hands and
stand up. Then turning to the groom he
began: "Do you take this woman to be
your lawful wiia?" BRIEI
Fee grasped the meaning and readily
assented by a nod of the bead. Then tbe
Judge began to address the bride. He
had not uttered more than half a dozen
words when he was informed that the
poung lady was entirely ignorant of tbe
English language. Tuis put a stop to the
proceedings. 3SM
"We must have an interpreter," said
the Judge. "I want this woman to know
what she is doing." XX
Colonel Know volunteered to act as mes
senger, and-rusbed out. In a few moments
he returned with not only an iutemreter
but another celestial couple, who also
wished to be married. The, ceremony of
uniting the first pair was continued, and
when .they were pronounced man and
wife the Judge ordered Fee to kiss bis
bride. But the latter demurred; the bride
blushed and toddled to one side, where
she would not be quite so conspicuous.
Then Judge Smith performed a like ser
vice for the second pair, ami all departed
happy as larks. The newly wedded couples
are all members of the Chinese 400.
A. BAILRO.iI> FOR SALE.
The Atlantic and Pacific to Come Under
the Hammer.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April The
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad will be sold
at auction on May 3, at Gallup, N. M., to
the highest bidder.
. No bid of less than $5,000,000 will be en
tertained by the auctioneer, Owen ;N.
Warran, but, despite the value of the
road, less fuss will attach to its sale than
is usually developed at an auction of
second-hand pots and pans. The. road will
be knocked down to the Santa Fe people
as a matter of course.
Judge Sterry, solicitor for the Atlantic
and Pacitic and the Southern California
railways, has just returned from, a trip to
Albuquerque. He was seen to-day in his
office by a Call correspondent and said:
"As you know, the Atlantic and Pacific
runs from Albuquerque to The Needles.
From the jatter piace to Mojsive Junction
the company has been operating the Mo
jave division, of the Southern Pacific,
which it will pvrchase next month. Large
sums of money will- certainly be spent in
improvements on this through line. < The
roadbed will be braced up and a new line
of telegraph constructed from Barstow: to
Los Angeles, which; while not a part of the
Atlantic and Pacitic, is its near relation.

FRANTIC DEED OF
A LINDEN MAN
Fires Two Shots Into His
Divorced Wife's
Breast.
Then Turns the" Weapon Upon
â¢ ' Himself but Comes Out
Unscathed.
Caught While Trying to Escapeâ The
Woman May Rect-v-râ
the Cause.
STOCKTON, Cal., April I.â At 8 o'clock
this- morning James Douglass, a laborer
residing at Linden, shot .and seriously
wounded his divorced wife, whom he ac
cused with intimacy with other men.
The shooting occurred at Mrs. Douglass'
home in that town. Douglass entered the
house shortly before tne hour named and
immediately began to abuse her, declare
ing that since the divorce, which was
granted about a year ago, she had been
too familiar with other men. He de
clared that if he could not live with her
they would both die together,, and, so say*
ing, he drew a revolver and fired two bul
lets into her left, breast in the region of
the heart. . With a scream she threw up
her arms and fell to the floor, and the
would-be murderer instantly turned the
weapon upon himself and emptied the
pistol, but not one of the leaden missiles
struck him, although the revolver" was
held so close that his clothing was powder
burned.
Thinking that the prostrate form before
him was dead Douglass, after tailing in
his attempt to take his own life, fled into
the country, making his way toward ' the
foothills of the Sierras. George Botts, a
Deputy Sheriff, and a man named Frank
; Beaver started .in pursuit, and before the
fugitive had gained two miles they over
took him and compelled him to surrender.
He was brought hack to Linden.
It is known tbat lie was intensely jeal
ous of his former wife,- who is rather
good-looking, about 35 years old, and that
his suspicious rested upon several persons,
but at Linden it is believed that he ac
cused her unjustly. He bad been :in the
habit of visiting the house to see their two
little children, a boy and a girl, a ed re
spectively . about 4 and 6 years. Two or
three weeks ago he called at the bouse
and in a fit of jealous rage attacked Mrs.
Douglass and choked her almost to death.
The wounds inflicted this morning were
examined by Dr. Wing of Linden, who ex
tracted the two bullets. He is of the
opinion that w en Mrs. Douglass threw
up her arms, at the instant the shots were
fired, : the action ;of < tbe .muscles of the
breast deflected the leaden missiles from
their course enough to make them glance,
and thus they. were prevented; from enter
ing the cavity of - the chest and piercing
the heart,. As it was, the wounds though
serious are not fata!.- - â¢ * v

THE SEN ATE AND THE TARIFF.
Now that the Dingley bill has passed from the House of Representatives to the
Senate it enter's upon a new phase; one in which lurks some danger to the bill and a
possibility of injury to the country. The House , framed and passed the bill promptly,
as the urgency of the crisis required. ; ln the Senate, however, it may, be delayed for
so long a time as to seriously unsettle commercial business and retard the revival of
industry. â¢ .'
So lar as the Republicans of the House could guard against the danger of delay they
did so by enacting that the new tariff should go into effect on the first of April. * If this
clause is ratified by the Senate it Will serve to protect our industries from the competition
J of large quantities of imported goods and will also secure for the Government a large
addition of much-needed revenue. It depends upon the Senate, however, whether
this clause shall sfand, and therefore the feeling of uncertainty is but little diminished
by its adoption in the House.
Reports from Washington as to tho probabilities of prompt action by the Senate
are conflicting. .On the one side it has been stated by such representative Democrats as
Gormon, Morgan, Mills and Jones of Arkansas tbat tho Democrats will make no effort
to delay passage of the act, but on the other hand certain statements made by Sep*
ators Allen, Ptsttigrew and other extremists forebode a bitter and prolonged opposition
to every feature of the act, even including tho title.
It is to be remembered, moreover, that- the Senate at its best is a very deliberative
body indeed. Even when no! obstructive tactics are interposed it takes a
long time to transact any business of importance. According to some estimates it
will take the Senate Committee on Finance six weeKs to consider the bill before
reporting it. Others claim. that their report will be made inside a month. It will be
seen that, if either of these estimates is correct, the chances of speedy action are
slight. â¢ . . - ' \ y â '
This being the situation of affairs, it would be well for boards of trade, chambers
of commerce, and all industrial and commercial bodies throughout the Union to
urgently petition the Senate, to act promptly on the measure. It is known that
Senators Allison and Aldrich will do all in their power to advance the bill as rapidly
as posslbfe and that they will have tho cordial support of their Republican colleagues.
The danger is that too many Senators will consider their reputations as statesmen at
stake if they do not play a large part in amending the bill as it comes from the House
and shaping it according to their own ideas.- Nothing is more likely to prevent delay
from this cause than earnest and resolute action on the part of the people and a
persistent agitation for prompt action.
â¢*>:? The danger is great and cannot be ignored. It is time to have this long-perplexed
question settled. It is time that our commerce and our industry were freed from any
feeling of uncertainty. Let the people, therefore, begin to take action. Ln the
Senate be notified that delays are dangerous and that the country desires the bill as
it is and needs it at once. , . . . â¢
.THE PAROE .IN EUROPE.
Not only in the Cuban affair, but in the
Cretan affair as well, the attitude of the
Christian; military world toward tbe 'op
pressed in war is calculated to bring down
ridicule upon the very idea of civilized,
warfare... Has the military world turned
into a brass-band parade of dotards? One
might, by an idle play upon the imagina
tion, copceive of ah infirmary of old men
out on a holiday, their impotent bodes
encased in armor in senile emulation of
Don Quixote, and the feet and arms, of
them whirling, around .in a burst of de
lirious peacockery ; ,and one wouldn't ex
pect anything but a. pitiable farce irom
them. Rut to the recognized "powers" of
Europe, the very' cream of modern sol
diery, for whom are invented . cannons
that will shoot ten miles and armor plates
that will withstand the cannons at any
distance, one is likely to look for greater
things..
: Perhaps the constant improvement of
arms and tbe corresponding improvement
of armor to withstand them has devel
oped an uncertainty and a fear of war's
consequences which in turn have ulti
mately resolved into -a' persuasion" that
there never will be any serious attempt to
force .war to the test. This may have
made them' reckless in the face of warlike
threats, and overconfident in the power
of diplomacy to settle differences between
â¢ nations. -At any rate diplomacy and ar
bitration have grown in favor correspond
ingly as implements of war. have grown in
effectiveness. And to-day, as a result- of
this ludicrous inconsistency, the world is
edified by the spectacle of great squadrons
of steel-clad vessels, armed to the very
water line. and' looking like floating pin
cushions with, cannons for.pins, paroling
up and down before little Greece in a
solemn endeavor to promote arbitration
and maintain diplomacy! Ye Athenian
gods and Mediterranean fishes! -what a
parody upon the deeds of our ancestors.
Greece doesn't, want anything to do
with these children's games of arbitration
and diplomacy. She wants plain', simple,
old-fashioned justice, and she is going to
fight for it in the good old way which
made and unmade empires, raised heroes
from the ranks, brought kings and princes
to. their knees and peop^ei history with
characters of flesh and blood. Read the
message of Colonel. Vassos to the "pow
ers.'-' ' "It to the people of Europe that
I appeal," he exclaims "those people who
ignore the method and reject the sophis
try of diplomacy. It is for them now to
put an end to a policy' which, whatever
its professed aim, is fraught with untold
horrors, and threatens a whole people
with extermination." !-,* X..X
BAILEY OF 'TEXAS.
' The new Democratic leader in the House
of Representatives, who is sometimes
called "Baby Bailey" and sometimes
"Young Bailey of Texas," deserves some
congratulation upon the manner in which
he has led his party during the contro
versy, over the tariff. He has saved
Democracy from making the unseemly
Wrangle which it made against the Mc-
Kinley bill, and 'has thus done much to
restore the fallen prestage of his party.
â¢ The new leader is in some respects a
notable man. =â¢ He wa-Â« elected to Congress
at the age of 26, and has now been re
elected three times. He is the youngest
man ever chosen to lead a great party in
the House of Representatives, and it is
something to His credit that, while so
young in years, he has achieved a leader
ship over such veterans in party warfare
as McMillin of Tennessee, Bland of Mis
souri and others of almost equal length of
service and party eminence. , ' *
The new leader is a conservative. It is
said that he was opposed to Bryan, and
supported him only through .loyalty . to
tbe Democratic 'party. His choice by the
Democrats of the House for the leadership
was regarded in Washington as an evi
dence that the party intended to break
away from the radicalism of the Bryan
â¢movement arid return to that conservatism
which has been its hereditary policy. The
manner in whjch Mr. Bailey conducted
fight against the tariff seems to con
firm these views. He 'certainly* showed
himself to be a good parliamentarian, a
man of calm temper, self-possession and
courtesy 'to his opponents, and the very
reverse of an agitator. *
The Democratic party may well con
gratulate itself on having such a leader at
this time. When one contrasts his tactics
with the manner in which tbe leaders of
-the party conducted the fight against the
."McKinley bill, and recalls the disgraceful
uproars which distui bed the proceedings
of Congress at that time, it will be seen
that * the new leader* is worth much to
the party. He could not defeat the Re
publican tariff, he could and did hold
the' fools of his own party in restraint,
and that is an accomplishment of which
any leader "may be proud.
Randsburg and Ballarat, in California,
may.be as rich in gold as the places they
are named after * in , South Africa and
Australia, but would have been just
as rich had they been called -by Calitor
nian names.' Why should we try sto gild
our gold districts with foreign reputations?
THE SAN FRANCISCO; CALL, FRIDAY, A^RIL 2, 1897.
AMERICA- MUST ACT.
It was a foregone conclusion that Wey
ler would want to kill General Rivera
after he had taken" him prisoner. Weyler
is just the kind of a creature who couldn't
for the life of him see why he should not
take advantage of so soft a snap for doing
away with an enemy. The prime consid
eration between this engaging scoundrel
and the pleasure of slaughtering an op
ponent iB that of getting the opponent in
his power. All other considerations
such as custom, rules of warfare or con
ventional military etiquetteâ are intrica.
pies which he doesn't pretend to under
stand, and which he would regard with
amazement if he 'did* understand them.
As for mere, ordinary decency, that is a
trait to which he was born an utter
â¢stranger, and to which he has never since
been introduced.
In The Call's review of General Rivera's
j prospects for getting shot like a rat in a
trap, as published yesterday, the immi
nence of the prisoner's peril was probably
' underestimated. Subsequent dispatches
| apprise us that Weyler is more restless
' over his captive's continued enjoyment of
life than was at first supposed. The gen-
I eral.is'in a fair way, to be ordered out for
! execution on the very fiist cold and dis
agreeable morning that dawns.
Now, what does the United States Gov
ernment think of such a situation? If it
| is going to take the trouble to think any
i thing of it at all it had better begin doing
it pretty suddenly. The general time for.
| dallying is long and perennial, but the
| present moment in its relation to the late
j of General, Ruz Rivera doesn't happen to
|be a part of it. Unless United States,
! does something besides dallying General
j Ruiz Rivera will be murdered. That is
i exactly the alternative. ; Unless some
j civilized power steps in and says that this
j ruffian -Weyler, who is no more fit to eon
' duct, a war against decent people or to
deal with honorable soldiers than a
, baboon is to preside over a university,
I shall not carry out' his sickening and out
| rageous ideas of military justice, the civil
i lzfcd t world is going to be treated- to a
j universal disgrace that will make all of its
; proud pretensions to military deportment
I mere mockeries in the sight of heaven.
What cares any sensible human being
j for all these army parades, these spangled
uniforms, these brass bands and various
j other spectacular things which go to
; make up the "majesty" and tho "impres
, siveness" 'of standing* armies â what
cares he for all this show if it avails noth
ing in an actual emergency, like the pres
ent, when the "majesty" of all the stand
ing armies on earth is about to.be de
graded by the cold-blooded murder of an
honorable prisoner of war at the hands of
one who vulgarly ignores every decent
convention of the 'modern code! That
| foul blot wouldn't look well on an es
cutcheon that 'has been worn thin with
I diligent burnishing during : all these years
I of shining peace.
The American Government must no*.
let this crime occur. It is its duty, by
I all the rules of morality, decency and
j military honor, to interfere. There will
j be no faintest excuse lor its not doing so.
j If no hand is raised from America to stay
this outrage, when there lies open to us so
fair and even pressing an opportunity,
the only inference to ba left after the
cruel deed is done will be that the United
States would not favor Cuba in its strug
gle for republican independence even
though it could have done so as easily as
not. And that would he a proud reflec.
I tion upon our boasted love for liberty and
| justice, wouldn't it?

I called Jones for purposes of identification,
j and he may be located at Cincinnati, al
though, he has a different name and lives in
i another place. Shortly before inauguration
, Jones called upon the President at Canton to
| pay his respects and to bis embarrassment
I Major McKinley inquired how ho was getting
j on with his lovo affair. ' Jones dodged the
i question, but the major pinned him down and
hnally extracted trom his reluctant lips a
confession that he had not yet persuaded the
young lady In the case to accept his heart and
hand, although' he hoped to be able to do so.
Jones exp.ained that nls prospects were not
very alluring arid that love in a cottage had
no attractions for the young lady he desired
.lor bis wife.
"Do you think she, would like to live abroad
a little wniie?" asked the President.
' "I wouldn't wonder," said Jones, ''although
I have 'never discussed thatsdl ject with her.
I I Imagine she is like most youug ladies, and
| would enjoy seeing foreign lauds."
"Well," said the President," "if you thihk It
i will do any good, tell her that I will give you
| a consular appointment as a wedding present.
Pick out eignt or ten places in Europe that you
think. wouidsuii her, and when I take up con-
I sular matters I will nominate you lor one of
| them.i' "
I Jones thanked the President warmly, and
has since notified him that, he would be mar
i ried early in June.

regard to the Oregon Senatorlel vacaucy. He
said: "There is certainly ' no inconsistency
between Senator Edmunds' opinion about the
present case and the letter he wrote in 1885.
In that letter he said 'that if a State Legisla
ture has once acted or had an opportunity to
act, while the vacancy existed, the Governor
has no power to supply the failure of the Leg
islature to fill it up. The present Oregon case
clearly falls without the above rule, Inasmuch
as there was no organization of the Oregon
Legislature in 1897, and the attempt to organ
ize was abandoned before the vacancy origin
ated. The Senator is, therefore, perfectly con

a satisfactory manner cannot fail to Interest the reading and thinking public â

"Now, it will be noted by' all who have.intelligence enough to vote a Populist ticket that
the money on hand In the 173 commercial banks is $9.2-11,590 54, and that the depositors
have put $55,907,500 16 Into the vaults, so that they would 'have to raise a little over six
times as much money they have on hand to pas off their depositors if these depositors
should happen to want it about the same time. In a word, they have 10-J per cent on*' hand
instead of the 25 percent requires by law. So I repeat that there is no lack of confidence in
our banks, at least so far r.s the commercial banks are concerned, Indeed, I might almost be
justified in saying that there-is a superabundance of confidence. : " '. ,

Glancing back to the figures or the 173 commercial, banks it will be seen that their
resources are placed at nearly $110,000,000, and here are 04 savings banks with resources <*et
down at nearly $142,000,000, the deposits in these savings banks running up to almost si 0 .
000.000, as compared with nearly $56,000,000 in 173 commercial banks. But when we come to
compare the money on hand in the saving* banks with that in the other banks w***Â«hall see how
exceedingly great the pubiieconfidence is ln our savings ba- ks. We hate seen'that the com
mercial banks have $16 50 on hand w.ith which to pay oft each $100 due their depositors, or mo
ther words they have $1 with which topsy $6, though of course they "have mouey invested
in stocks and bonds to the amount of $9,500,000. and they have loaned money on stocks "and
bonds to the amount of $11,000,000; on real estate, $21,000,000; on personal security
$34,000,000, and soon, which.lt is presumed could be turned into money tar awhile if all
the money they owe depositors should ever be railed for at the same time." * â¢â¢Â«"â¢
-â  But how much money have the savings bÂ«nkÂ» on hand as compared with the commercial
banks? Their sworn statements show $3,145,258 47, while the commercial" banks have $0 -
-241.590 54, or nearly, three times as much as the savings * banks. , But the comparison ends
here, for.there is no comparison between the $3,000,000 on hand in the savings banks with
which to pay nearly $142,000,000 due their depositors and the $1 on hand in the commercial
cants with which to pay the $6 due depositors. In fact, the savings banks, according to their
own showing under oath, have but 53.000.000 cash on hand -with which t-> pay almost
$126,000,000 due their depositors, which is just 2^ per cent on the $100. In other words if
the savings banks were called upon to pay their depositor* all off about the same time they
would have $2 25 on hand to pay each one who called for $100 due him. I This clearly shows *
to my mind, that there* is great public confidenceâ no lack of it whateverâ in either the com
mercial or savings banks of this State; and moreover, that nearly all ihe money in the State
is In circulation among the people.' . * : â¢>.*-;; y* - JOSEPH ASBURY JOHNSOX Â«.

rather, who want to marry again before a
year from the ' decree which freed them
from the bonds of the first alliance, Will
find a stone wail across the path of true
love, if the" second love be such. -' .
At the instance of Senator Bulla the iast
L,et-islature passed ' a ' law that prohibits
people from marrying" until the} have
heen "divorced an entire year. In words
and figures the* law is identically as fol
lows, but "there is a way. to beat it," ps
the gamblers say, which is another story :
CHAPTER XXXVI.
tAn tAct to amend section sixty out of the Civil Code, relating to the granting
â  . '*. "â¢ * *of divorces.
;'*. '* \ â _. [Approved February 25, 1897.]-
The -.People of the Stats of California, 'represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact
â¢ - - * â¢*; ' j X'.'." as follows:
SECTION i. . Section sixty-one of the Civil Code is hereby amended so' as to
read as follows: '. â¢ '
61. A subsequent marriage contracted by any person during the life of a former
husband or wife or such person, with any person other than such former husband or
wife, : is illegal and void from the beginning unless:
I. The former marriage has been annulled or dissolved; provided, that in case it be
dissolved, the decree of divorce must have been rendered and made at least one year
prior to such subsequent marriage; â¢ â¢ â  .
2. Unless Such former husband or wife was absent, and not known to such per
son to be living for the space of. five successive years immediately preceding such
subsequent marriage, or was generally reputed or believed by such person to be dead,
at the time such subsequent marriage wis contracted; in either of which cases the
subsequent marriage is valid until its nullity is adjudged by a competent tribunal.
The every-day Anglo-Saxon of the fore
going law, so far as it affects people about
to be divorced, is tbat tliey may not marry
in this State a^ai'ti for one year.'after. di
vorce-* When it is considered that divorces
have heretofore often been followed by a
second * marriage within a few" days, or
even hours, and that hereafter Â£65 day
must intervene before a second marriage
may be validly celebrated, it will be seen
that the law has solemnly declared that
people "must 'be off with the old love be
fore on with the new." ..-â¢
â Similar -prohibitions against the mar
riage of divorced persons have been mad*
in many States,' notably in New York and
Massachusetts, but the divorced inhabi
tants of each of these Stales flee to ah
American Gretna Green, New Yorkers
evading the inhibitions of their law by re
marrying in New Jersey, and Mass'achu-.
settes divorced fleeing to Connecticut
and marrying there with impunity. *- '<
'"In both States it. has been uniformly
held, 1 .- aid. Attorney -Samuel M. Short
ridge, General W. H. L. Barnes and other
prominent attorneys yesterday, "that the
marriages contracted in -adjoining States
are eood even .when the parties return to
make their homes in the State whose laws
tbÂ»Â»y have evaded." ". . *.-.'
The two great legal works on marriage
are -'.Bishop on Marriage â¢ and Divorce 1 '
arid 'Stewart on Marriage." .Bptn works
are full of- cases upholding the validity
of marriages contracted in -adjoining
States whero there are no inhibitions. '
Stewart's ;.; work, section -432, says: ."A
New Yorker : . prohibited ;by a New YorK
law from marrying within a year has but
tb'step into New Jersey to be married, and
the New York courts- hold the marriage
valid. See Van V.oorhis va Brintnellj 86
New York." â¢. â¢ -.- .*
â¢ Bishop's great book on marriage says,',
section 867:. "Marriages valid by the inter
national law of marriage and .by.the law
of the State where celebrated are valid by
our State laws." â¢'.,.
â¢ In t section . 869 * the same author says:
.'.'The prohibitions of marriage after "di
vorce are not extraterritorial, but are lim
ited in tneir effects to the Mate creating
them. . To illu-trate: A statute in Massa
chusetts disqualified the "guilty party after,
a divorce to contract a second marriage;
thereafter a man and woman, both domi
ciled in Ma-sachuseetts, went to Connecti
cut for the purpose of evading â¢ the pro
hibitory law, and were there married,
immediately returning, and their marriage
was held .by the Massachusetts courts to
be. good. Putnam vs. Putnam, Bth Pic!*-.,"
433." " . .
According. to local attorneys and an un
broken line of decisions and principles
laid down in legal textbooks, people di
vorced in California may go into "other
States and marry legally in spite of the
new law here.
As section 69 of . the Civil Code, relating
to the issuing of marriage licenses, ha->
not been amended, it is likely that per
sons ignorant of the new law may obtain
licences and be married. They will learn
too late that their marriages are illegal. "
The refuge of persons prohibited by the
new law here is likely to be the sister
States of Oreion, Nevada, Arizona and
Washington, where there are no laws for
bidding "marriages* after divoice. In
Washington the Jaw is ambiguous and it
may that divorced persons must wait
six months. Another refuse is likely to
be the high seas. Persons divorced here
may be legally married beyond , three
miles from shore, but not on a California
vessel, because the law of the State fol
lows the vessels of the State beyond tbe
marine league. ' Altogether many queer
comnlicationa are likely to arise over the
new law, but there is hope for those who
go beyond the State into other States
where such laws do not obtain. *

fact nothing more than a mortgage, and
that as the mortgages negotiated by
Turner were not of sufficient nvieni
to impair Frenna's security for the money
advance 1, . therefore Turner was not
guilty of any illegal i.et. To bear out this
theory,. Mr. Collins offered to prove the
value of the property as compared -with
the amount of the mortgages negotiated
by Turner.
Judge Wallace said he thought it his
duty to rule out this line of testimony, as
it would bean endless task to attempt to
unravel the different transactions involved
in Turner's manipulation of the property.
He said that after all there was but one
question for the jury to decide, and that
was whether or not Turner intended to
take t c deed for the purpose to which he
afterward put it at the time of the actual
taking.
Attorney H. C. Dibble, who is assisting
Deputy District Attorney Black in the
prosecution, contended that criminal in
tent must- be implied from the fact that
unlawful use was made of the paper after
it came into Turner's possession.
â¢ To this Mr. Collins took exception and
gave notice that he would appeal from
Judge Wallace's order which' excluded
proof regarding the sufficiency of Fren
na's security.
In the afternoon Expert Chirographer

A New Trial â¢ Given â¢ to the
Ex-District Attorney of
- This- City.
y 'i... Ââ. ,â '
The Supreme Cturt Takes a Very
Lib.ral Vi w of the Evidence
in the Case. ..
Thr* Justices and Commissioners of the
State Supreme" Court gave the lawyers
and the criminal element, something to
think about yesterday apropos of the Page
case. Ex-District Attorney James D.
Page was convicted of embezzlement last
year, It was shown at the trial that be
had absorbed the entire estate of his in
sane ward Louie Lichtneeer. amounting
to $4262. Page, upon being confronted
with the evidence ot his guilt, fled to Salt
Lake, where, he lived under the assumed
nam e of James Mason.
Upon ' learning that his whereabouts
had been made known by a man travel
ing across the continent, Page, alias
Mason, fled to New York, where he was
subsequently arrested' and returned to
this City on a. Grand Jury indictment.
At the trial it was shown that Page* was
appointed guardian o: Lichtneger, an in
sane man, on January .3, 18'JL On April
4 Of the same year he was ordered to file
his account of bis ward's estate, but be
did not do so until May 4, 1834. This ac
count showed .that, in 'June, 1892, Page
paid $190 to the Acnews Asylum, and at
that date he had $3776 92 on hand. Judge
Levy, in wuose court this was filed, was
unable to obtain further information
from Page. 1 At the trial of Page, Judge
Levy . testified that Page had drawn
from the German Bank all hut $51
of the insane man's estate. Page waÂ« re
moved as guardian by Superior Judge
Slack on May 28, 1895, but at that time no
demand was made upon mm for the de
livery of his ward's money, nor was any
other guardian appointed.
In his appeal for a new trial Page con
tended that the indictment of the Grand
Jury under wnich he was tried was il
legal; but the Supreme Court held that
it was legal and that Superior Judge Wal
lace, before" whom Page was convicted,
did not make a mistake in refusing to set
aside the indictment or in refusing to
sustain the defendant's demurrer. How
ever, the Supreme Court did grant the
ex- District Attorney a new trial on the
ground of the insufficiency of the evidence
to justify his conviction for embezzle
ment. The Supreme Court was so liberal
in its views as to hold that because no'
demand had been made upon Page for his
ward's money there was no evidence to
show that he had misappropriated the
estate, and could not be held as an em
bezzler. 'â  -
The case of Treasurer Royce, who
cleaned up several thousand dollars out
of the Veterans' Home Association, was
{ cited.. Ia that case the Supreme Court
j held that Boyce "may have had the
| money all that time ready to refund to
I any demand of the association. If the
] verdict in that case was not justified by
j the evidence it is quite clear that it was
i not in this." 3*^l*ffl****tt^CTbSSa
, The fact that Page fled from the State
when called .upon for an accounting for
his shortcomings did not .seem to cut any
figure in the order for a neÂ«v trial. The
decision was rendered by Court Commis
j sioners Belcher, Searls .and Uaynes, and
was affirmed by Justices Garoutte, Har-
I rison and Van, Fleet. â¦

About noon to-morrow, if nothing un

singular sight will be seeu by curiosity I
seekers along the water front. Together
the Mariposa and Swanhtlda will sail j
through the Golden Gate the latter the
vessel that brought Butler into this port,
red-handed from the scene of his assas
sinations in Australia, and the former the
ship that bears him back to the scene of
his crimes, to satisfy the demands of
justice, outraged and grim.
The Swanhilda came down from Port
Costa a few days ago, loaded with a cargo
of grain and shipped all her men yester
day. About noon to-morrow she will
clear lor Queenstown.
The Mariposa was expected to depart to
day, having been delayed already twenty
four hours by the tardy arrival of the
English mail. But it was stated yester
day that she will probably be obliged to
extend the hour of her departure till near
noon to-morrow.
Howard-street wharf was the scene of a
shooting yesterday that resulted in the
man who was so careless with his eun
getting two beautifully mottled eyes an
a chance to ponder on the' uncertainty of
existence in the Harbor Police station.
The man in question is John Barth, and
he arrived in port on the schooner Eva as
second mate.
Day before yesterday Barth was being
paid for bis services on the Eva, when a
woman appeared who seemed, to know
him and demanded $25. . He gave her $10,
and Officer George VV. Lake saved bim
from the anger of a crowa at tbe woman's
beck by placing him on a car and starling
him uptown.
Yesterday Barth invested part of his
earnings in a revolver and came down to
the wharf with the expectation of signing
as. seaman on the Invincible, soon to uo to
the Alaska fishine grounds. His account
of subsequent occurrences is that a man
named George Kemp, who, he claims, is
the husband of the woman in question,
started to pummel him, whereupon Barth
pulled his revolver and discharged it at
Kemp,- but missed.'
A crowd then -sot upon him and beat
him nearly into insensibility. He was
taken to the station and*. locked up on a
charge of discharging firearms.

to carry them out to sea.
They were unable to help themselves
any and the launch picked them up on
seeing their distress. When they neared
the wharf the skiff capsized and gave the
three an involuntary ducking in the cold
water. It was righted and shortly after
ward repeated the performance, but the
men at last reached the dock, shivering
but thankful. ... â¢
In - the afternoon the Coptic, with a

VEBSTEE'S EECOMMENOATIONS.
The School Superintendent Makes Sug
gestions '<> the Board of Education.
In his first report to the Board of Edu
cation, made on Wednesday evening, Su
perintendent of Schools Webster made
soma valuable suggestions that will prob
ably be acted on by the board later.
In regard to school materials he stated
that several citizens had complained to
him that a custom prevails in some
schools of compelling children to pur
chase writing-tablets of certain manufac
ture, and books not authorized by law, or
by an order from the Board of Education.
He says that this comes dangerously
near to violating the provisions of section
1730 of the Political Code, and should re
ceive close attention.
The duties of* janitors are treated of at
length, and the Superintendent says that
he apprehends thai a very liberal con
struction is put on the words "reasonable
duties" by some principals. Janitors are
required to perform reasonab'e services
required by the heads of schools in addi
tion to the duties set forth in the rules. â¢
"Ordering janitors," continues Mr. Web
ster, "to prepare a hot lunch and then
clear away the relics and wash the dishes;
to cook during vacation on 'a public stove
with public fuel for private delectation;
compelling a janitor in receipt of less than
$40 per month to devote his entire time to
the school*, and this without contributing
a cent for the service â might be regarded
by some as unreasonable duties.
"Principals should be considerate in
their demands and I trust that this sug
gestion may prove sufficient."*
TWO OLD RELICS.
The First Broom and Sack of Flour
; Made in This State.
J. A. Filcher, manager of the State
Board of Trade, has secured two valuable
curiosities â relics of. former days, as it
were that he has added to the exhibit at
the headquarters at 16 Post street. One is
the first broom made in (he State and the
other is the first sack of flour made in Cal
ifornia. On the latter is the wording:
"Homer's Mills, Union City, Cal.;
">Â£ bbl., 49 lbs, Superfineâ War
ranted from pure California wheat. Oct.,
1853. Homer & Co., agents, San Fran
cisco."- *
The broom is of a very large size, and
was made from exceedingly large broom
straw, It was made on J street in Sacra
mento in 1852, and it won a silver medal
worth $10 at tho first fair ever held here.
These relics were .the property* of the
late Colonel G. L. L. F. Warren, who at
one time was the editor of the ' California
Farm.
Sudden Death of a Young Woman.
Mrs. Lillie Fornum, wife of Captain F. A.
Farnum, a prominent mining superintendent
of Nevada and California, died of pleuropneu
monia at the Brown Valley mine, near Grass
Valley, on the 2Uth of last month at the early
age of 32 years. Mrs. Farnum was a native of
Carson, Nev., where she had a large circle of
friends and relatives..- Her mother, Mrs. M. P.
Dorsey, was at her bedside when her gentle
spirit took its flight. Sue leaves surviving her

Celestin Andre -Worried Over
Family and Financial
Matters. *
He Was Found Full of Gas and Closs*
to the Expiring Point in His * ;-*
Bedroom.
Celestin Andre, a vigorous young
mountaineer of Switzerland, ia.eznecteil
to die at any moment in the City Receiv
ing Hospital, is;
He was carried there early yesterday
morning from room 42 of the Hubbard
House. V-
The man was discovered lying on his i
bed and tho gasjet in the room was open.
Whether it was suicide or an accident
cannot be learned, as the surrounding
circumstances ere most peculiar. '
Andre grew up among the Alps, and he
earned his living as a guide. He "was
able, in that capacity, to lay aside some
money. . .
* A niece of his came to this country
same six years aeo and married a butcher.
She wrote to her uncle such glorious
tures of what fortunes awaited him here
that Andre pave up his alpenstock and
came to California about four years ago.
Mrs. Charles Kaulet, proprietor of the
Hubbard House, tells, the remainder of
the story. She says: ' â¢
"Celestin Andre thinks the world of his
niece, and be came here because she told
hint to. They had .some financial trouble,
and from that time on he and his niece
and her husband have been at outs. He
brooded over this affair and was very
despondent.
"When he ran short of money some
seven months ago he went to work; for me
as a bedmaker. He worked first in the
Fauntleroy, on O'Farrell street, and a
couple of months ago be came here. He
was a hard-working and saving man."
The room in which Andre was found
nad a door ajar to the extent of an inch or
two and the transom was open, which
somewhat allay* the suspicion of at
tempted suicide. .
For a Dredger Patent.
Judge Morrow was engaged as Circuit Judge
in hearing the case of A. B. Bowers against
the San Francisco Bridge Company for an
alleged inirinKement oa a dredger patent
claimed by Bowers. The case was tried in
1892 before a jury, >ut the jury disagreed. It
is now being tried before thtÂ» court.
J. H. Miller and John H. Hoone appeared as
counsel for Bowers and D. M. Deimas and R.
Percy Wrieht for the bridge company. The
case will be resumed this morning.
Already Serving a Sentence.
The case of J. D. Hogan, an ex-convict,
charged with robbery, was dismissed by Judge

ANOTHER PIONEER
PASSES OVER
Death of Henry Livingston,
. an Early Day Jour- ;
nalist.
One of the Men . Who Shaped
â¢ - Destinies in the Day s . . .
0f"49.
Came of a Family That Dates Back
to William the Con/
queror.
Henry Livingston, one of the pioneers
.of the Pioneers, one of the men of mark
in the earlier California, died yesterday.
He was 72 years of age, and, reduced in
circumstances, had been little heard of
for many years.
In the old days Harry Livingston was a
force in California. He was a newspaper
man, one who knew how to write and
what to write about, and a man whose
personality was as strong as his pen was
trenchant. He was an educated and cul
tured gentleman and one of the best
dressed men in the profession of those
days. '.
He arrived here fresh from college, 24
years of age, in- June, 1849, and at once
took a prominent part in affairs. Al
' though hailing from Connecticut, he was
a Sympathizer with the Southern wing of
the Democracy, and bis tastes were fash
ioned after the- chivalric temper of the
time. In the late '50' he acted c âas corre
. spondent at the State capital for John
â¢Nugent's paper, the Herald. He was con
nected at one time or another with all the
early newspapers of this City down to the
time' of and during the war. For ten
years he-has been; the historian for the
â  Society of Pioneers, and his chief occupa
tion has been the writing of the biogra
phies of his fellows of the society, living
and dead. _ â¢
The family of the ' deceased t was a very
old and atone time powerful' one.
* His ancestry on the paternal side of * the
ho a were Scotch, and ; he was directly
descended from the Levingstons of the
days -of William the Norman, who occu
- pied the baronial estate and castle known
as ''Lithhngon."
Shortly after tho discovery of New York
by Hendrick Hudson, the "Fatrooji estate
on the; east side of* Hudson River was
settled and taken possession of by Gilbert
Robert Livingston, where to-day the name
of Livin ston can be found in nnd about
j New York. Other members of the family
moved to Redhobk, now known as Tivoli,
. in Dutchess County, directly opposite the
Kaaterskill. ranee of mountains oh the
west side of the Hudson River.
The father of the deceased, James Kane
Livingston, was born in .Schenectady,* as
were also several other members of the
same family. "* . .
- The deceased waÂ« born in Litchfield, N.
Y A , on August 19, 1825. In 1&10 he entered
as a freshman in William College, aud
four years later received he A. B. degree,
in company with Judge Budd of Stockton,
H. P. Coon, late of -San Francisco, and
Rev. C. T. Mills of Mills Seminary.
Graduating from there in 1847, he ,read
air with his uncle, David Codwise,' and
I in IS4S was admitted to the bar in New
York.. â¢
. About this time the news had reached
the East of the gold discovery in Califor
nia and he at once resolved to come to
this State. He was a passenger on board
the ship Chnstoval Colon. Oa this vessel
he had for companions Hall McAllister.
Sara Ward, John G. Hyer, Joseph Nevet
and George Derby. '
The ship dropped anchor inside the
Golden Gate on the morning of June' 4,
1849, after a voyage of six month".
After but two days' stay in San Fran
cisco he went to Sutterville, a place then
about two miles below Sacramento on the
river bank, where on the day of - his ar
rival he experienced a heavy rainstorm,
which he afterward spoke of as being a
summer phenomenon. Afterward he
j * THE LATE HENRY B. LIVINGSTON. '.
went to Sacramento, where he was ap
pointed editor ot a Whig newspaper in
Sacramento, which died in 1851. Shortly
after its death, he became associated with
Dr. John F. MorÂ«e in editorial work on
the Sacramento Union. : .
Subsequently he ; returned to San Fran
cisco, and as stated, was employed on the
newspapers of this. City, entering first
into the service of the Alta. He made a
visit East in 1853, and again a scorrespond
ent of the Alta to St. Louis in 1859. He
has written for newspapers during the last
twenty years. the biography he has
written of himself for the Pioneers, he
recounts as one of his "sins of omission"
the fact that he never married,

erallyâ it would not be unwise to call such a convention. The people look with sus
picion upon such an instrument got up in haste and without any chance on their
part to read and think oyer the matter, and for that reason, among others which
might be mentioned, I am opposed to any attempt to frame a new constitution.
No useful purpose could be subserved by having such a convention. The farmers
of this State are now overtaxed, and the property of the majority of them is mort
gaged, or otherwise incumbered, and a constitutional convention, with its additional
burdens of expense, would have a great tendency not only to make the present con
dition of things worse, but to drive away new capital, which might otherwise seek
investment here, ana would also retard the investment of such idle capital as we may
have in this State.
The question, it seems to me, for us to consider, while admitting that the present
constitution is defective, is whether or not a new constitution would not be fraught
with greater faultiness and Weakness than the present one; and, while we may bs
greatly in need of a new constitution, we are not sure that the people would get what
they wanted, as conventions of. this sort are controlled, to a great extent, by politi
cians, lawyers and corporate influences. Let us "rather bear the ills we have than fly
toothers we know not of." Respectfully, ,

MONEY POURED
INTO THE SEWERS
The Auditor Investigating
Board of Health Ex- '
penditures.
An Old City and County Hos
pital Scandal That Will
â¢ Not Down.
The Watchman of the Treasury Stops
a Drain on the Urgent Neces
sity Fund.
The old scandal over the City and
County Hospital sanitary system has
cropped up again, and the Board of Health
is once more in hot water over it.
Auditor Broderick is investigating the
manner in which proposed improvements
are being conducted by the health au
thorities, and has expressed .himself as
somewhat dissatisfied with the lavish way
in which money is being spent.
Under a previous Board of Health $10,
--000 was spent and wasted in putting in a
sewerage system that was worse than use
less. The Grand Jury is now engaged in
sifting that matter to ascertain whether
some one cannot be brought to account
for the disgraceful work that was done and
accepted by the authorities.
Shortly after the â  present board came
into power it declared that the hospital
was a nuisance and threatened, unless the
I sewers were repaired so that they wpuld
carry off the refuse, they would close the
institution. They stated that $500 would
place .the sewers in such condition that
they would relieve the immediate danger
of an epidemic, and obtained an appro
priation of that sum.
Tire money for hospital repairs was ex
hausted, but on the* members of the
board representing, to Auditor Broderick
that the repairs were of vital importance,
that official consented to allow the money
to be drawn out of the urgent necessity
fund. He regretted his decision in the
matter later when bills for repairs amount
ing to $3000 were contracted without the
end being reached, and he served notice
on the Board of Health then. and there
that the members had not lived up to
their promises, and that no such indebt
edness would ,be paid ; out of the urgent
necessity fund.
The Auditor Is of the opinion that the
big bills have arisen from the use of iron
pipes instead of stone, which he believes
would have served the purpose just as well.
He made a personal inspect on of the im
provements now under way yesterday,
with a view of ; suggesting some method of
checking the outflow of money.
. Within a few days. funds under the con
trol of the Board of Health will be avail
able to pay tbe bills, and the contractors
will probably have to wait until then. It
is hinted that some Health Department
salaries may be delayed before tbe end of
the - fiscal year if the board is not more
careful in its expenditure of money.
It has been discovered .that most pre
cious stones, ; such as the ruby, the sap
phire and the emerald, can â ' be readily be
told from their imitations by means of the
Roentgen rays. .., . <.'-;-.
WING GETS THE
FIVE-MILE RECORD
A Remarkable Exhibition
' of Speed at the Indoor
Cycle Meet.
"King" Eaton Also Clipped a
Second From the Quarter-
Mile Mark. .
McFarland and Stevens "Won the
Professional Events and Tantau '
the Amateur Mile Race.
i The cycle races at the Pavilion last night
were rather spiritless, the racing lacking
the vim that has characterized some of
the contests during the tournament. The
record* rides of Wing and Eaton, however,
were well worth seeing. c .
The fastest mile of the evening was 2:19,
in the final of the mile open, professional,
the beats being run in from 2:25 to 2:30,
and even slower. * â â¢
J. E. Wing of the Olympic Club Wheel
men rode five miles against time, tandem
paced. The first mile was paced by Bird
sail and Hammonds in 2:03. Dixon and
Luce carried him the second mile, tho
time being 4:10 for two miles. Three
miles were ridden in 6:16 2-5, the pacing
team being Kroetz and Elfcru. Four
miles rolled by in 8:27, Dixon and Loos
again pacing. Birdsail and Hammonds
swung in to pace tne last mile and took
i ira over the tape at a rattling gait, the
time lor the five miles being 10:29, beat
ing tne former world's amateur record
21 3-5 seconds.
Wing's" time was within 4 seconds of
that made by Michael, the Welsh wonder,
on un eigbt-lap indoor track a few-months
aco, 10:25, which was considered by the
cycling world at the time a phenomenal
performance. Wing's pacing last nigut
was perfect.
Jay Eaton, the indoor king, rode an ex
hioition quarter mile, un paced, against
the world's record of 28 2-5 sec, and suc
ceeded in bringing it down to 27 3-5 sec.
It was one of the prettiest exhibitions of
the tournament.
When the field in the mile open, profes
sional, had been reduced by the prelimi
nary and semi-final heats, the starters
who qualified for the final were Jones,
McFarland, Morris and Davis. It looked
like. Jones' race almost to the tape, when
McFarland snatched victory from him by
a clever sprint. Morris ran into third
position. igjgESS *
There were two preliminary heats to the
hall-mile open professional, and those
who qualified for the final were: Davis,
Stevens, Allen and Terrill. After oue
lalse start the men got away, and it was a
sprint irom start to finish. Stevens look
the load on the second lap and led ail the
way, Terrill running a close second, Allen
third. The time was 1:05 2-5.
The one amateur race on "the pro
gramme, at one mile, was won by George
Tantau of the Olympic Wheelmen in.

An exhibition of fancy riding by little

Tha Baldwin- Co t Rey El Salto Played
". in Luckâ Damien Found An
m[) .;' other Easy Spot." â  â¢
. â¢ . . ... . o â
â¢ With a continuance of health and a lit
tle luck the- old iron horse Logan will
soon have completed his century, ln the
last race run at Ingleside yesterday, a
mile purse event, he celebrated his ninety-'
eighth victory, beating Wawona and five
: other platers in ordinary time. Sallie
.Clicquot was. an even-money chance and
raced with Logan, who was second choice
in the betting, to the stretch, when she
had enough. The iron horse then went
on and' won with little to spare. ,
Al&ojigh only a fair card, the attend- !
ance'was above the average.. The track 1
was in a heavy condition from the show- |
ers of the preceding day, but favorites
managed to 'score on four occasions.
It looked very much as though the mil
lionaire horseman E. J. Baldwin again
experienced one of his famous lucky
streaks in tbe two-year-old event first de
cided. His colt Rey el Salto, coupled in
the betting : with Juan del Kio, ruled 8 to j
5 choices in the betting. Hermo&o led all |
the Way and looked to have downed i
Flushington a nose, with Hey el Salto j
third, beaten a neck, but the Baldwin
colt was placed first and Flushington
second. The decision, though, was per
fectly satisfactory to the .bulk of the
crowd.
After receding in the betting from 8 to
5 to threes Morven took the six-furlong
selling run with light welter-weights up
in a drive from Peril. The latter made
all - the running, but was outgamed
through the stretch and beaten naif a
length. Cash Sloan on the sto 2 favorite
Potentate pulled up as the barrier went
up and was practically left at the post.
He showed a good turn of speed and off
well would undoubtedly, have captured
the purse. -
As though it were made according to
the doctor's prescription. Damien, start
ing at odds* of 7 to 10, fairiy scampered
away with the mile and a furlong purse
event, winning under restraint, a length
before Lincoln 11. Scarborough was
beaten out for the place through a fumb
ling sort of ride on the part of Ciawson
the last hundred yards.
- With his..w ell-known preference for
muddy going, Barney Schreiber's Sweet
William was backed to beat the favorite,
Caliente, in the fourth race over seven fur
longs, decided under selling conditions.
William could not shake Stemler's colt
off, and "dogging" it through the stretch I
was even defeated for the place by Bus- |
sella. Caliente won easily by four j
lengths. ...*...â¢ . .
â¢ Purser's colt Rey del Tierra was an. ,'
odds-on 7to 10 choree for the mile " and a
furlong selling affair. The 30 to 1 out
sider, Addie Buchanan, led the favorite
to the turn, down the backsiretch, where I
the faV' rite took command nnd romped j
in. 'â¢ Addie Buchanan, weakly, ridden Dv '
Mathews, was beaten out for the place by j
Foremost, ridden by "Sheets" Martin. .'

CONTESTS HIS MOTHER'S WILL.
Byron Digging Does Not Think He Was'
F"alrlv Treated.
' Byron Diggins has filed a contest to the
will of Mrs. Eliza Diggins, his mother.
Mrs. Digeins died March 2, 1896, leaving
property valued at $12,500. She left a will
bearing date of February 27, 18y5. ln
which she bequeathed the bulk of her
property, consisting chiefly of real estate
on Sutter street, near Devisadero, to her
daughter-in-iaw, Louise, wife of her son,
Julius C. Diggins; her daughter, Julie
GELETT BURGESS.
Parrlsh, and" her granddaughter, Lovina
L..Peck. Her son Byron was cut off -with
the sum of $50.
The document was admitted to probate
April 2, 1896, and to-day, just within the
limit of time allowed, Byron Diegins filed
his contest.' He claims that his mother,
who was 88 years of age when she died,*
was unduly influenced by, persons un
known to disinherit him.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1897.
WHY "THE LARK"
HAD LISTENERS
Its Songs Were New and
Its Fun Had
â¢ Meaning. â¢'
Its Tribute to Stevenson Said
to Outrank All
Others.
A Few Samples Called From Some of
Editor Burgess' Better
Vs-rse.
Ever since The Call printed the full
story of the death of The LarK, brightest
of Western singers, Doxey's publication
ollice has been flooded with eager in
quirers. Thousands are asking "Who is
Uelett Burgess and who is Bruce Porter?",
tbe two chief and master spirits that
made the bird sing. *
Editor Burgess has lately explained
that he was born in Boston thirty-one
years ago, which accounts for his culture.
< He was graduated from '.he Massachusetts
Institute of Technology as a civil engineer
iri 1837. afler which he. surveyed for the
Southern Pacific Railway Company for
three years. He was then an instructor
in civil engineering at the University of
California for three years, since which
time he has been engaged in designing
furniture and other articles of use and
beauty, meantime conducting Tho Lark.
In surveying the mission of the queer
publication just now closing its career
there are a lew .things that stand forth
strikingly and give it a distinctive char
acterâthe "goops," queer drawings that
rival the Brownies, the odd verse and
essays of the editors, and the extraordi
nary things in English by Portei Garnett.
A strange feature about The Lark ii that
it ran nearly a year before a female note
j -was* heard, since which time two women
have contributed anonymously, with
| marked success. *.".-â 
j "My own greatast hit was 'The Purple
Cow,' " said Editor Burgess yesterday. "1
cannot get rid of it, ana I am remembered
chiefly by it. I like best ray 'A Boy's
Will Is the Wind's Will' and the ' Song
for tbe New Year.' Mr. Porter's tribute
to Stevenson made . a great hit. Mrs.
Stevenson regards it as the best of all that
has been written."
The tribute to Stevenson is as follows:
O sailor, sailing the unfa: homed sea.
What wind now speeds thee, and what star's
thy guide?
And what adventure worth thy bravery
. Calls, with the lifting tide?
For thee, the new coasts, gleaming, still;
For us, the hope, the plunge, the engulfing
.-. night! .
land! and set thy beacon on the hill!
Our pilot into ligbt! -
"A Rondel of Perfect Friendship," by
Editor Burgess, gives a good idea of some
01 the verse in that vein that gave the pub
lication its fame. It is here reproduced:
Friend of my soul, forever true,
hat do we care lor flying years,
Unburdened al by doubts or fears. - -~.: -
--'â¢ Trusting wha-. naught can e'er subdue? â¢
Fate leads! Ht-r path Is out of view:
Nor time nor distance interferes.
Friend of ray soul, fjrever true,
What do we care for flying years?
For. planted when the world was new
In other lives, In other spheres, '
Our love to-day a bud appears.
. Not yet the bit siom's periect hue,
Friend of my soul, forever true!
A fair sample* of tbe nonsensically
h-umorous verse of The Lark is seen in
"The Protest of the . Illiterate" in the
March number., It is as follows:
1 seen a dunce of a poet one a-wrltin' a little book,
And he says to me, with a smile, says he, "Heie's
a pomeâ d' you want to look?" < ...v ..-.
And I threw my eye at -the pome; says I, "Wot's
â¢â¢ the use o' this here rot?"
"It's a double sesilne," says he, looking mean,
"and they're hard as the deuce*, that's what."
'There's blood in your Inkwellâ l do'nt think,"
says I. bogfnnln* to preach:
â¢â¢Oh,' there's not, mach force." says he, "& course.
â¢ â â¢ but there's plenty of lingers o' sueech!" '.-"â¢â  â¢
â¢Why write about maids, and violet shades?" says

A LOST SOEEW.
Suit Against Harbor Commission Em
ployes to Recover a Propeller.
Some me ago the United States reve
nue cutter Hartley lost her screw pro
peller off the seawall. The screw was of
bronze and cost $200. Not having the
necessary appliances lor grappling and
raising the propeller Lieutenant-Com
mander Burt determined to wait until the
arrival of another cutter from the north.
In tbe meantime employes of State
dredger No. 2 were shown the spot ' where
the screw had sunk and recovered it.
Then they demanded $140 for salvage â al
most as much as the propeller was worth.
The lieutenant-commander refused to
pay it and referred the matter to Wash
ington. A reply from the naval authori
ties wa3 returned to the effect that the
United States District. Attorney should
sue the tinders for the possession of the
screw. In accordance with those instruc
tions Assistant United States District At
torney Knight yesterday filed an action
in the Circuit Court to recover the article
or its value and to collect $100 damages.
The defendants are Michael Redmond,
Thomas Gutrey, John O'Day, Deed Ash
ley, Henry Todman, Thomas Lanahan
and Martin Mead. The Harbor Commis
sioners have backed up their employes in
their demand lor salvage.
LISTENED TO WAGNER.
The San Franc sco Symphony
Society's Fiith Concert
Well Attended. V
Wagnerites Highly Delighted With
the Rendering of the Quintet
From "Die Meistersinger."
The programme of the fifth concert of
the San Francisco Symphony Society yes
terday was entirely ' Wagnerian. Wag
nerian overtures, preludes, solos, duets
and quintets were rendered and duly ad
mired by the lovers of the great German
composer. But there were others to
whom Warner was evidently dull and
uninteresting. The majority, however,
were Wa-jnarites pure and simple, who
bad come to admire, to applaud and inci
dentally to be educated.
Jacob Mueller, a barytone who was at
one time very well known and who sang
with the Fabbri Opera Company," sang
the "Song to the Evening Star" very ac
ceptably indeed. In the recitative which
preceded the solo Mr. Mueller's voice was
a little inclined to be throaty, but the
"Star" song at once placed him in the
pood graces of his audienc*. Mathilde
Wiide sang "Elizabeth's Prayer' and the
aria "Dich. Theure Halle."
The prelude to "Lohengrin" was well
rendered by the orchestra, and then fol
lowed the balcony scene from "Lohen
grin," with Mrs. Cecelia A. Keesing as
Elsa and Mrs. Katberine Fleming
richs as Ortrud. Mrs. Keesing has a
pleasing voice, but the dramatic music of
Ortrud was a trifle too heavy for Mrs.
Hinricbs. ;
One of the prettiest numbers on the
programme was the "Murmuring Forest"
from "Siegfried." The quintet. "Wal
ther's Preislied," from "Die Meis**r
singer," was beautifully done by Mrs.
Keesing. Mrs. Hinricbs, Rljvs Thomas,
Alois Werner and Jacob Mueller. Mr.
Thomas' solo was the best vocal piece of
work durinc the afternoon.
The date for Iho next concert has not
yet been announced. XX-

diseased or disordered nervous system soon creates a disturbance of all the bodily
functions and lays the foundation for constitutional diseases.
It is no lonscr an open question regarding the cures made by the Electro-Medical
treatment of all cases of Nervous Debility,; Sleeplessness, Impoverished Blood, Neu-
ralgia. Rheumatism, Impaired Vigor and all conditions arising from a debilitated
nervous system. -;â¢â -'â¢ : * â¢'â . -
At this season of the year especially you need a remedy for impure blood and a
tonic for your nerves, because your system is run down in vitality and vigor. The
Electro-Medical treatment brings n*-w-lifo to the worn, fagged, nerveless, emaciated
sufferer. It imparts new energy,. makes yoa feel the lire of youth again, makes work
a pleasure, makes you capable of enjoying to the utmost every enjoyable thing. It
produces a permanent incieaso of vital activity in the system, and by/ its electric
energy excites the parts to more vigorous exertion, thus giving them the power to
throw off and everlastingly eradicate disease. * '.^ . . w ,' 'â¢â¢

J. B. Farish on the Big Gold
Output of Leadville, and
Cripple Creek.
Predicts an Increase of Three to Five
Millions â Is Only on a Short
myxx Visit
.. ""
â **
John B. Farish, the widely known min
ing man of Denver, who was born in Cali
fornia and lived for a number of years in
Marysville and this City, is among the
arrivals at the Palace. 'i; r
Mr. Farish has come to the coast on
mining business, but says he has nothing
far enough along to make any announce
ment concerning it. He will be here two
or three days yet.' -* .'.
"I think things are picking up a little
in Colorado," said Mr. Farish. "There
seems to be a slightly improved condi
tion of affairs at Denver, and at Leadville
it is a good deal better. â  The settlement of
the strike there has put things on a much
better basis. . '"- .-; X .â  ':,*â 'â  'â â '-.â 
"Cripple Creek has during the past four
months produced. more' gold than during
any similar period of her history. That
shows that the camp is advancing in the
right way.
"Tbe gold product of the State last year
was just a lit tie under California. I have
seen the figures, but I have forgotten just
now what, they are. I think this year
there will be an increase. of $3,000,000 to
$5,000,000.
"The increase will be largely from .Crip
ple Creek, but Leadville and other parts
of Colorado will contribute heavily. The
section Known as the 'Downtown mines'
at Leadville will add materially to the
gold output. These mines were closed
down during the long strike, or at least
for a good part of that time, and the prod
uct was thus much curtailed.
"The Colorado men are very pushing.
They do not mean to be quiet. They will
be at work as usual, and are sure to turn
something up."
Mr. Farish says many Colorado men
have become interested in the large enter
prises at Randsburg,
SEW TEANSfEES.
Changes That Will Affect the Post acd
Market Street Lines.
Commencing Monday, April 5, transfers
will be given at the corner of Polk and
Market streets from outward-bound cars
ot the Post-street line to outward-bound
Market-street cars; also from inward
bound Market-street cars to inward- bound
Post-street cars; provided, however, that
passengers traveling upon the Post-street
line on transfers received from inward
bound cars of the Market, Hayes or Ellis
streets lines will not be given transfers to
outward-bound cars of any. of said three
lines.

Prince Bismarck's Study.
f "Count Bismarck's study, as be called
it in English, was a room of no great size
nor furnished with any splendor. It was
comfortable, nothing more. There was a
rug on the varnished floor of the usual
hard wood. A large writing desk, littered
with papers, stood in the right-hand : : cor
ner on the further side. There were few
books. A print or two hung on the walls.
A ;i>ieboard stood in the center, near the
writing table, and there were armchairs.
It was a working-room. None of the co
quetry nor luxury which some hard work
ers like to surround themselves with was
visible. There was no .lack of comfort,
but comfort had not been -the thing
chiefly considered when the room bad
been furnished. The palace, as a whole,
was built on a Inrse scale, with large rooms,
but most of them had no great splendor.
The impression, as of other. official resi
dences which 1 afterward saw, was one of
dignity; the appointment* were sufficient,
the* rooms overloaded sometimes* with
ornaments, but left rather bare of furni
ture."Youth's Companion. ,: /.; â }

Another violent death .has come to a
member of the Pacheco family. During
the past year three members of this old
family have been taken off suddenly. '
About a year ago Diana Pachecb took
Dart in a double suicide that occurred in a
lodging-houÂ»e in this city. Her father
forbade the marriage, and rather than be
separated -the girl and her lover-lay down
together and it is. presumed he shot her
and then himself, although there
ing 'to prove- it was not a case of double
suicide.
Toe ' news of his daughter's death so
affected her aged father, who lives across
the line in, Contra Costa. County,; that
shortly afterward he was overtaken by a
fit and suddenly expired.
Now one of the lads is dead at Concord,
thronch the premature discharge, of a
gun. He went out in the field near his
home to shoot meadowlarks with ah old
muzzle-loading gnu. The lad had b?en.
warned not to use the ancient weapon,
but be scorned all advice and started out
hunting. He hat! not gone' far before he
Diet with an accident, which soon proved
fatal. He was in the act of loading the
weapon." when â¢it was .discharged. The
charge entered : .his left arm above the
elbow and shattered the member in a
frightful manner. â  y.x
He was too fara*vay from home for any
one to hear hs calls for assistance, but he
managed to crawl to the porch of his
home, where he was found by his younger
brother on his. return - from , school. At
tnat time the injured boy was almost
dead from less of blood.
.-- Dr.'McKenzie was summoned and was
required at once. to amputate a portion
the arm. Tuesday morning it was neces
sary to s -ver the limb at the shoulder. In
consultation with several other doctors
this latter .operation was declared to be
necessary to save bis life, but the boy Was
so weak from loss of blood that he died
.jtist after being taken from tbe operating
table. ".'-.- . ' y-,-'yy.
". He will be buried in the same grave with'
.iis father and sister. He was the oldest
boy in the family and was recently taken
from school so that he could help support
his motner."

TRYING TO DROWN

Chief Fair Suspends En

Ambitious.

Fred A. Campbell Seems to Have the
Insiie Trick at tin Present
Tim .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
;.*;;â¢ 908 Broadway, April 1. J
There is war in the Fire Department,
and Chief Fair has suspended Engineer
W. B. Smith for violating the rules of the
| department. So far as can be learned,
The Present Condition of the Oakland Fire Department.
the violation of the rules consists in mak
ing an effort to become Chief Fair's suc
cessor. * â¢
â¢ For several weeks the two men have
been bitter enemies, and not content with
personally expressing their animosity to
ward each other, they have been guilty of
the error of rushing into print. Smith
hag stated that when he should have been
attending to his duties in Oakland Chief
Fair was on one occasion tending a bar in
San Francisco. He then proceeded to
charge his chief with flirting, and stated
that Fair used to put the lights out in his
buggy- so as not to attract attention when
going on undesirable missions.
Chief Fair, on the other hand, has said
that Smith is not a rood fireman, that his
engine is always jdirty and that if he
wished he could say many things which
would injure his family, evidently not
thinking that such a statement is even
more damaging than if he mentions what
the charges were. X.?'.-tÂ£. x
This morning Mr. Fair suspended Mr.
Smith, and when the latter asked for the
reason ho was simply told the one word â
insubordination.
It also appears that Fred Murdock, the
chief assistant of the department, has not
any love for Smith, and saloons seem to
be the bone of contention between all
parties. Fair says tbat Smith used to own
a half interest in the saloon in which he
claims Fair tended bar. Fair also hints
that Smith is not a stranger to other
saloons, and recently Murdock was sued
by a whisky man of Alameda for a bill,
and this incident also is now , Imn.: urged
to show that he is not a good man to
as-ist Chief Fair in the charge of the de*
.partment. â¢ '^* v .":.-
There are other candidates for the posi
tion of Chic. of the Fire Department, and
although so far not one word can be
charged against them in regard to the
present strife, their presence in the fight
has certainly not been conducive to ibe
speedy restoration of discipline.
Fred A. Campbell would like to be chief
of the department. When Fair was ap
pointed every insurance man and nearly
all the merchants indorsed the candidacy
of Fred Campbell, but the Board of Works
- ignored the indorsements and at the re
' cent- election were themselves ignored.
Now Campbell is making a fight for the
place on the strength ot the same backing
he baa two years ago, and as Chief Fair is
slated to make a "vacancy in the near
future Campbell may carry off the plum.
Ex-Chief Liawton is also a candidate,
but his combination was broken. He was
â  a leading spirit in the Labor. League that
met at tier's Hall, and v.bich was solid
for Davie, Garrtt7 and Clement. As
Clement was the only winner it is feared
that the old chief's chances are about
I number three in the list.
It is absolutely necessary that some-,
thing be dune speedily to quiet the unrest
in the fire department, for the men will
do politics so long as they think there i- a
chance for promotion by so doing, and
just so Ion? as there are four candidates
in the field for chief there will certainly
be politics in the department.

STOLE A MARCH.
How the Chinese Laundrymen Tricked
the High-License Advocatesâ They
Cannot Be Molested for a ear
ALAMEDA, Cal., April I.â The advo
cates of the high, laundry license ordi
nance are busy wondering just exactly
where they are, and have scarcely found
out yet. Some time ago it was proposed
to levy a license of $100 a quarter on all
laundries doing business in this city or
soliciting custom here. The object was to
force the removal of a lot of unsightly
rookerie\ which are an eyesore to me
town. As soon as the proposition was
made it encountered bitter opposition, one
of the principal objections, urced being
that the proposed rate was practically
prohibitory, and that to enforce it would
be to drive every laundry except one out
of business, as none ol the smaller ones
could pay so large a tax. The matter was
deferred to permit the City Attorney to
draw up a new ordinance dealing with
the laundries from a police and sanitary
standpoint. The delay was just what the
Chinese and their attorney, M. P.Wiggin,
wanted, for pending action the end of the
month came and with it the expiration of
every license that was in existence. The
laundryraen at once . applied for new
licenses for the ensuing year, and having
no option they were issued. So whatever
action the Trustees may take the laundry
men are secure lor the next twelvemonths
and cannot be molested. .' * X *â ;â¢*.

DALTON ARRESTED
BY HIS FOREMAN
Beggs Objected To Because
< : He Once Made a
', Mistake.
For a Long Time Ha Denied
That He Had Ever Been
in Jail-
When the Troth Came Out Oae of the
Directors Attempted to Take His
Job From Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April L )
P. E. Dalton', one of the proprietors of
the Contra Costa laundry, was arrested
this morning by his foreman, Richard C.
Becgs, for battery and disturbing the
peace.
The facts leading up to the arrest are
very unusual. Two months ago the Con
tra Costa laundry, which is the largest in-
stitutton of its kind in this county, em
ploying 220 people, . engaged Richard C.
Beggs as foreman. It i 3 a responsible po
sition, carrying with-it the authority to
employ or discbarge all help.
P. E. Dalton and Pliny Bartiett, two
wealthy men, are the leading stockhold
er in the concern. When questioning
Beggs, it occurred to Dalton that Beggs
had the same name as the man who five
years ago stole $600 from the Grove-street
power-bouse, where he was engaged as
secretary. s. .;/
Casually Mr. Dalton asked Beggs if he
was the same man, and Beggs replied thai
he was not; in fact be took an oath that
he was not the power-house robber. He
was engaged and had proved a very
earnest and conscientious foreman, ac
cording to the story of Mr. Bartiett. Dai
ton, . however, bad some trouble witb
Be^gs over the discharge of Daiton'* half
brother. -Beggs says that by way of re
venge Dalton started to verify bis suspi
cion that the foreman was the man who
bad been in San Qienttn.
As a matter of met Beggs the robber and
Beggs the foreman are the same man, and
he admitted that he bad cenied his con
nection with the robbery because he
needed a position to support bis wife and
family. For the past three years he has
been leading an honest life, and he con
siders himself justified in acting as he did.
Dalton discovered this and this morning.
according to his own statement, he went
to the laundry, told Beggs . to go about
bis business, informed the help that Beggs
was no longer their foreman and that they
should take no further notice of him, and
taking him by tbe arm he assisted bim to
leave the laundry.
: Beggs arrested Dalton, turned him over
to an officer and the proprietor was re
leased alter depositing bail.
Mr. Bartiett.. who is the superintendent
ol the laundry, says that the trouble oc
curred when .Beggs discharged Mr. Dal
j ton's half-brother. â¢
"About a month ago," said Mr. Bart
left, "Mr. Dalton came to me and said
that Beggs was a thief and had been in
San Qaentin. Wo asked Beggs about it
and lie denied it. Later, however, he ac
knowledged to mo that he bad s'olen
money from the Consolidated Street Rail
way Company, but ha said he was trying
to do better and live down bis past and
the laundry directors decided to give him
a fair trial. In every other way he was
j entirely satisfactory. Dalton, however,
was not satisfied and took it upon himself
to discharge Beggs. Dalton is a share
holder,' but he overstepped bis bounds.
He holds no executive position and had
no right to discbarge the man. The di
rectors immediately reinstated Beggs."
To-morrow morning, the case will be
tried in the Police Court.

Ex- League of the Cross Cadets
N.'w in Legal Diifi
cuit es.
â¢ i â¢ â¢â¢
Father Philip O'Ryan, spiritual adviser
of the i League of the Cross Cadets, has'
begun suit in the justice Court in that
capacity against Eiward P. Fitzgerald, <Â£
J. Began,* James A. Lamey, W. Fitzgerald-,
and Thomas M. Moroney to recover
thir:y-five*suits of clothes or their value,
which is set at $250! â¢.' *
The defendants were members of a
League of the Cross Cadet company that
was mustered out some time ago. E. P.
Fitzgerald b mp captain, C. J. Regan
lieutenant and the other members. Their
uniforms were boxed up and left in tbeir
New Montgomery - street headquarters,
presumably at the disposal of the league
when they were needed.
About a month ago Father O'Ryan, who
is in charge of the personal belongings of
the league, was informed that tho uni
forms were about to be sold by their
former wearers nnd*at once took steps to
gain possej-sion of the suits. â¢
A few days ago a search warrant was
sworn out and the police took possession
of the uniforms, which are now in posses
sion of the police. It was at first intended
to prosecute the young men, bu; Attorney
Garret McEnerney, > wbo represented
Father O'Ryan, advised against any such'
course, as it would bring the ex-cadets un
der a charge of felony, and he thought
that proceeding would be too severe.
The matter came up in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday, and that jurist in
timated that he wonld dismiss the pro
ceedings on the ground that it bad not
been shown that the uniforms belonged to
the league. . / ; . * *
To keep a legal'hold on Ihe suits the ac
tion mentioned was begun The com
plaint alleges that on March 5 the defend
ants unlawfully took possession, of the
uniforms and now hold them.
The ex-cadets claim that the uniforms
belong to them and that* Father O'Ryan
has no right to the possession of t em,
while the adviser of the league maintains
that the property, which is really worth
$350, was purchased with league money
and that the defendants have no right or
title to it. â¢

'.'.. .'â¢' Amohiz the bills recently approved by.
Governor Biidd'is Assembly bill 983. "An
' act in relation to Boards of Freeholders'
'.-. and.. proposed charters.". ...The measure
.-â¢ was indorsed by .the Merchants' Associa
-.* tion of Kan.' Francisco, and ' under its pro
*. visions. a '.Board of â¢ Freeholders may. he
elected and a vote taKen upon a proposed,
â  charter with slight expense to the public.
-The way is now open for 'the people of
- San Francisco to "beein at once the work
- of pr paring a new charter. â¢
â¢ -Speaking on this topic yesterday Mr.
Dohrmann saidt "Yes, this is the bill
which secured' the sanction' of the Mer
-.. chants' Association.' .It- is proper.* now to
Â begin ' the agitation for a new charter.
Under this act the cost of reentering .and '
..'receiving the vote very slight compared
with the cost of holding a genera! elec
â¢ tion. I am not, however, in favor of
.haste in the. framing of a charter. It
would be advisable, I think, to submit. the
whole subject to a committee of- 100' to
â¢determine the cardinal principles of the
instrument. Good citizens uiffe'r. widely,
on one question, and that' relates to the
centralization of great -power in the hand's
'of the Mayor. Time. should be taken to
discuss the charter deliberately and as
certain as near as possible what the peo
pie most desire in the way .of changes
from the present -system." 1 ' fancy the
way is open to submit alternative propo
sitions to a vote. The .agitation for a new
charier should begin now. and I see no
'.reason why a charter should not be framed
'. and submitted to the people within one
â¢ year from this time."
â¢-. J. J. Truman' expressed the opinion that
steps should be at onoe taken, to secure a
new. charter for San Francisco. "This
' new law," said Mr. Truman, "greatly re
..- duces the expense Of registering votes and
holding elections. The first step neces
sary is. for Board of Supervisors to
call for. the election of Freeholders. Now
is the time to act, while the subject is
! fresh in the minds of the people. Many
- cf the provisions of the charter submitted
.- at the last general election are still-dis
tinctly remembered. Every one. who baa:
; given the " subject any . study whatever
perceives that the City, stands in need of a
plain and simple governing act, and under
this law a charter may be submitted on
i:Â« merits,, independent of the conflicting
: influence of a general election."
â¢ Following is the text of the bill which
the Governor approved day "before yes
terday: â¢ .â¢ â¢

~ The Passengers Were Given a Lively
Shaking Up, but Met With No
Serious Injuries
What might have been a most disas
.'. trous railroad accident, in which, many
innocent lives would have been sacrificed,
was narrowly averted last evening near
".. the- Ingleside racetrack.
". Train No.-19, the evening* "regular" for
San Jose and way stations, left the South
ern Pacific depot at Third and Townsend
"!: streets at 5:30 o'clock, schedule time, car
â¢ rying some sixty passengers, most of
whom were visitors to San Francisco. The
usual care was taken in winding out of
â¢' the City, and top speed was not attempted
until the train was well past Ocean View."
â¢ Here a sharp run is always made until
the station known as Spring Valley draws
" near, and* tne "slow-down" orders take
.'-â¢'; effect. This is done for the reason that
;. there are some sidings here and a spur
'-track which i* used by rhe excursion trains
- ; carrying . people to . the Ingleside race
' course. â  ''
â¢When train 19: came rolling along the
:. last race had been .run at the track, the
;.-â¢ spectators were homeward bound and had
already boarded. their fpeciai.
. The latter had been sent down the spur
â â _' -âa mile and a half' of â  trackâ was
.-â  waiting within a hundred yards or so of
.-'.. "'â¢ the main track until the San Jose train
should, pass," thus, giving it a clean rail
-"down to Third and Townsend streets. â¢-.
X ... While this special was lying there, snort
.'â¢' ing arid hissing impatiently, a switchman
'."â â¢ named Slogan, who the railroad people
.' gay must have been in a temporary trance,
-.or was troubled with something . even
'-.*' more serious, opened tne switch connect
â¢ :. in-' the spur track with the main line. :. J
It was evidently his intention to make
.-"â¢ the way clear for the special to go. out,
".. having forgotten that the southbound
â¢.' regular was scheduled to pass before the
; "excursionists could resume their journey
cityward. â¢ ... Â;:'-.
â¢ . â¢â¢ The effect of his blunder was to direct
the course ot the now whistling and rap
".idly approaching regular, with its sixty
innocent 'â¢ouis on board, squarely into the
spur track ana where a collision "with the
sspecial,5 special, also with its human freight, was
ceriain.-;' â¢
- Fortunately for those whose lives.were
thus imperiled by this piece of apparently
inexcusable carelessness, the engineer of
the San Jose train was sharp-eyed enough
to see that the switch was open. .
â¢*.' Like a flasn he reversed his engine
R and clapped on the air brakes. He was
. not a second, too soon, for his train was
last closing.in on the special before the
. brakes and reversal began to have their
â¢Sj effect. .When they did, though; they op
/crated quickly and with force. But even
".' all of this lightning-like and heroic work
â  was not enough to prevent a collision.
'â¢' . That was. -inevitable.* but nevertheless
â¢ the crash was so eatly minimized that
.â¢ tbo-e who were passengers on either train
â¢ ' suffered scarcely more than a heavy jar.
.'Had the southbound regular been mov
".' ing down the main track at full speed, in
;; stead of slowly, the two trains would cer
". tainly have been telescoped and a fright
; ful wene would have ensued. The loss of
life would have been great. But as it was
nobody was hurt beyona receiving a shak
ing up and there was little wreckage. *
â¢'. ... The pilot of the engine "drawing the
* southbound train was smashed and partly
carried away ana some of the machinery
â¢ was -injured. News of the mishap was
telephoned -to ', the Southern Pacific
yards and a new locomotive was dis
. patched to the Spring Valley station to
take the place of the injured one. All
. . this. occasioned a delay of about an hour
Â«nd then the San Jose train resumed its
. journey south.
â¢ " The locomotive ahead of the racetrack
â * special was not damaged enough to inter
fere with its task of bringing the race
goers home. A baggage-car attached to
the train was. however, lifted from
the track by the.- force of. the col
lision in such a manner that the
forward coupling was broken and that
end of the car thrown unon the tender
It did not require a great deal of time to
..- get everything in working order again and

them who nad not taken to the street

';.,. The railroad people acknowledge that
. -they, had a very narrow escape from hav
-* ing one more fatal disaster added to their
record. - Superintendent Frazer ot the
- * coast division said last night that he was
amazed that so little damage was done.
/.'*' A few hours' work, ha said, would see
the injured locomotive as good as ever,
. - and as for any other bad effects of the cO
-1.... lision they amounted to nothing. But
- what he considered most fortunate was

The New Call Building, the Scene of a Huge April Fool Hoax.
A MONUMENTAL
APRIL-FOOL JOKE
People Witness a Man's
Fall From the New
Call Building.
He Turns Out to Be but a
Dummy Dressed to Repre
sent a Workman.
Wcmsa Scream and Men Turn Pale.
The Whole Only a Colossal
Joke on the "Boss."
At 5:30 p.m. yesterday a large crowd
was assembled at the corner of Market
and Third streets to watch the workmen
perform the hazardous feat of sliding
down the steel cable attached to the der
rick on the sixteenth story of the new
Call building.
Now a few days ago one of the workmen
who is accustomed to the perlormance of
this daring and . foolhardy, act* was : se
verely injured by dropping the sack which
he had twisted around the rope, and in
consequence having the palms of his hands
severely torn and burned; so the overseer
had issued bis ukase that the cable-sliding
be discontinued. But the public were
unaware of that fact and the crowd was
on hand in anticipation of the usual
thrilling sport.*
It was not disappointed. Shortly after
the hour for ceasing work : tnree work
men made their appearance and carefully
crawled out on the derrick on their hands
and knees. Instantly all was eager atten
tion on the part of the sightseers, who
craned their necks to gaze upward at the
three figures, who appeared as pigmies
against the heaven on account of the great
height. . i .
As one of the men, assisted by his com
rades, cautiously crawled over the edge of
the derrick and seized hold of the caole,
the air was filled with the "ohs" and
"ahs" of the expectant witnesses. A mo
ment of breathless suspense, and the man
began slowly to descend.
fie had gone but a few < feet when his
speed began to increase. Faster and
faster he flew, and yet faster and faster. I
It was only a matter of a few seconds till
his speed was that of a cannon-ball. ?"*~ : {
Horror of horrors! The man has lost
his bold. Almost before the crowd has
time to realize it he speeds downward
like the: lightning flash and strikes the
ground with an awful thud. .The force of
bis impact was such as to throw him back
into the air for several feet, and then he
fell again, to lie silent and motionless, r i
- A great and concerted groan arose from
the crowd who were witnesses to the ter
rible, catastrophe which, came so unex
pectedly. Strong men stood with' faces
blanched and drawn, gazing helplessly at
one another. Women screamed and bid
their faces in their bands to shut out the
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1897;
awful sight. Then a scene of confusion
prevailed.
As soon as they had in part recovered
their senses a few of the more thoughtful
rushea to the. assistance of the poor wretch
who had dropped to the earth, from a
point over 300 leet above. As they did so
their minds were filled with the sickening
spectacle of a human being crushed and
bleeding, with his bones mangled and his
face a shapeless mass.
The foremost man stooped to touch the
poor unfortunate with a face at once ex
pressive of sympathy and awe. As he did
so he drew back with a look of surprise
and bewilderment.
Could it be possible? _ Yes, it was so, or
his senses were deceiving him. He
stooped again and took hold of the man
again. . This time he drew bacK with a
countenance on which the li.'ht of under
standing was beginning to gleam, and
laughed, actually laughed. His laughter
swelled' until it grew into an uproarious
guffaw.
At this heartless act the crowd rushed
forward. What they saw produced mer
riment in some and disgust in others.
What had fallen was not a man at all, but
adummy dressed to represent a workman.
Above tbe din the cackling of the work
men high above could be distinctly heard.
Instead of two there were now a dozen or
so in sight.
The affair turned out to be a huge April
fool joke, perpetrated primarily upon the
boss on account of his edict against sid
ing down the cable and secondarily, upon
| the public in proper celebration of the day.
But* the sight of that dummy coming
down the rope will not soon be forgotten
by the eye-witnesses. And many of the
ladies will never assemble again even to
see a live man risk life and limb on that
new Call building derrick cable.
FOR BLUE-LABEL OIGAKS.
The Local Unions Want to Drive Out
the Tenement-House Product.
A special meeting of Cigar- makers'
Union No. 228 was held last evening in
conjunction with the San Francisco Trades
Council. M. -; C. Dunn, the president,
stated that the object of the gathering was
to continue the agitation in favor .of the
union's blue-label goods in preference to
the products of the Eastern tenements and
Western Chinese factories.
James Wood, the organizer for tbe
International Union, delivered an interest
ing address, in which he described the
filthy hovels in the East where the scab
cigars are make by overworked, underfed,
underpaid operatives.
He said that such cigars were injurious
to health, for tne people who make tbem
eat, live and sleep in the, places wherÂ° the
.tobacco' and cigars are ' made and kept.
Many : loathsome diseases are ' thereby
spread among the consumers.
The case of the Physicians' Club of New
York City was cited. A large number of
respectable physicians contracted a dis
ease by smoking.- cigars from a nefi;ro fac
tory in which were employed a number of
unhealthy operatives.
Mr. Woods stated that a large number
of the . popular brands of cigar* of thi-*
City are made up in the tenements under
the conditions described. He referred to'
.the statements upon this subject of such
men as Professor Bumstead, Professor
Otis and Dr. Kirk patrick, the physician of
the Montreal City Hospital, which prove
that cigars made by unclean operatives
spread disease to an alarming extent.
x\ short address was made by Walter
McArthnr. j The president announced tbat
at the next meeting of \ the union he will
appoint a committee to continue the agi
tation against non-union made cigars.

Several Drivers of Patrol Wagois and
Janitors Dismissed for Incompe
tency and Lack of Full.
The Supervisors last night heard Engi
neer Schussler on behalf of the Spring- Val
ley WatÂ«r Company, and also received ' a
communication from the Castroville
Lakes Water Company offering, to supply
the City with 36,000,000 gallons daily and
to pipe the water here and turn over the
whole plant to the City for $14,000,000.
After deciding to adjourn until Thurs
day evening for further consideration of
the water question, the board removed
Frank Murphy, George Brown and Pat
rick O'Connell, drivers of patrol wagons,
and put in their places James C. Simon,
George Howard and John Holland, the
dissenting votes being Delaney and Rot
tanzi. Janitors Robert Barton and Dennis
Coleman were removed and John O'Brien
and Ed Nolan were appointed in their
stead.
Dr. Rottanzi asked what was the matter
with the drivers of the patrol wa gon, and
Mr. Lack man replied that no reason had
been. given earlier in the year for other re
movals and there was no reason to be
given in the present instance. Gross in
competency was alleged as the reason for
dismissing the janitors.
Before tue meeting of the board opened
a delegation headed by John Pengally
from Southern Heights, above the Potre
ro, complasned that the Spring Valley
Water Company had not put on sufficient
pressure to give them the water that they
needed.
Engineer Schussler explained that the
manufacturing establishments of that dis
trict took off the pressure by usine a large
quantity of water and that the company
would put in a big supply this year.
The cause of the delay," he said, was the
fact that Mr. Clark, the representative of
the Hearst estate, had asked the exorbi
tant price of from $10,000 to $12,000 for a
lot 200x'200.0n lop of a rocky hill, which
the company wanted to use as the site for
a steel pressure tank. They had finally
succeeded in oeating down the price to
$5000, and had contracted to buy the lot
and place on it a steel water-tank which
would give the hilly part of the Potrero
all the water needed before the end of the
present year.
When the board convened Supervisor
Haskin9 introduced ( a resolution naming
the boulevard Balboa boulevard, which
was adopted unanimously. Then the
board went into committee of the whole
on water rates.
Mr. Quinlan explained that Mr. Stettin
wrote a communication addressed to Dr.
Clinton to the effect that he (Stettin) had
made a mistake when he testified the
other evening that be had been over
charged for water for wetting down brick.
The witness mailed the letter yesterday.
Mr. Perley was the agent for the com
pany and was to be paid a percentage on
his collections, but the collections had not
paid expenses yet, Perley having taken
the place of the former agent. Perley had
no authority to sign any contracts.
All that he and the other agents had
authority to do was to charge according
to the legal rate.
Engineer Schussler. in answer to ques
tions, said that in 1877 the water company
had offered its entire plant to the City for
$13,500,000. The City offered $11,000,000.
and they did not come together. Since
that time $11,300,000 had been spent on
the works. To this should be added the
increase in the value of the property for
tbe'past twenty years.
On the Ist of March of this year the
company owed $10,410,151 45. The total
income last year from all sources was $1,
--767,070 38. During the present year the
company would need $300,000 and $800,000
to pay interest, etc For interest on bonds
there would be needed $498,500; interest
on capital stock," $792,000; running ex
penses. $400,000; taxes. $105,000; interest,
on borrowed money, $45,000, making . a
total of $1,840,000. Deducting rent, $20,000,
would leave $1,820,000.-
Mr. Bchussler went on to explain that
a good deal of money would be required
for the replacing of old pipes with new
pipes. In laying new pipes, say in the
Richmond District, , the new. water col
lections will not pay more than 2 per
cent interest, simply because it is often
necessary to lay three blocks of pipes to
reach one consumer. .
Mayor Phelan asked whether the com
pany could not supply. Clarendon and
Richmond districts with the surplus water
which the company had without having
to make extensions to the watershed, but
Mr. Schussler replied that the company,
would have to put, in money for laying
pipes, etc., and interest would have to be
paid on that also. Wherever they changed
small pipes for larger ones hey had to put
in more hydrants, but tne $60 per, year re
ceived by the city for each hyurant would
not reimDurse the company for tbe outlay.
In response to questions by the Mayor,
Cashier Ames ' said "that the company's
new building, on the corner of Geary and
Powell streets, would be finished at the
end of the year, and that the net revenue
from the building, beginning. January 1,
1898. would be a little more that 6 per cent
on the cost of building. \
The Mayor said that if .'the. water com
pany - had not paid $25,000 taxes in, ad
vance, and had practiced a little more
economy, the March -dividend need not
have been passed. . â  ' .
Mr. Ames explained ; that in > 1895 the
company carried over one tax payment
from November to March, but since. that
time they had paid in full every - Novem
ber. V ..-'..-".
Mr. Schussler said that the company
intended to take out 6000 meters this year.
The * meters had . served * the â¢ purpose for
which they had been iiut in, and he did
not believe that the people wanted them.
The meters were very, unpopular.
[â¢: Supervisor Dodge asked whether 15 per
cent of the water consumed in tbis City
was not derived from wells and sources
other than Spring Valley, . and Mr.
Schussler said that the proportion was
variously ' estimated at from 5 to 20 per
cent. He added that if the City went into
the water business and supplied the
citizens with water at a lower rate than
tne Spring Valley,* that company would
have to adopt lower rates.
"If the City should Introduce water,"
asked the Mayor, "and you should be de
prived of your customers, you could sell
your property for other purposes and still
be able to pay to your stockholders and
bondholders the amount of tneir original
investment?"
"We would make a good profit over and
above what the land cost," was the reply.
Cleric Russell read a proposition from
the Castroville Lakes Water Supply Com
pany, offering to supply 36,000.000 gallons
of water per day to San Francisco, and to
lay all necessary mains, pipes, etc., for
$14,000,000 for* the source of the supply
and the entire plant, with 122 square
miles of watershed. The report was
signed by Charles A. Ogden and William
Irelan. '.*â  .yX^XXi X :
Mr. Ogden was sworn and testified that
the Castroville lakes were 100 feet deep,
and that drawing 36,000,000 gallons of
water a day would have no effect on thÂ«>
volume of water in the lakÂ»s. There was
a sufficient capacity of 100,000,000 gallons
a day of pure, clear water.
He swore also that he was a competent
engineer and had worked for a year on tbe
Croton works in New York.
Then the board adjourned to take up
the water question next Thursday even
ing.
"RIGOLETTO" IN FRENCH
Henri A! bers Plays the Title
Role of Verdi's Pretty
Opera.
The Barytone Follows Victor .Hugo
Throughout in His Reading
of the Role.
As the opera season at the California
Theater nears its close, tbe management,
having tested the popularity of Henri Al
bers, is putting forward operas with star
barytone roles in order to give every op
portunity to the singer who, without dis
paragement to his fellow-performers, is
generally acknowledged to be the best
artiste in the troupe. - X"- '-, X
Last night Albers was given a chance to
show his mettle as Rigoletto, a role which
gives almost as fine a scope for acting as
for singing. "Rigoletio" is an Italianized
version of Victor Hugo's "Le Roi
s'Aiuuse," and the public has become
familiar with the stereotyped reading of the
title role which has been stamped on it by
barytones of the Italian school.
Albers sang the Verdi music brilliantly'
last night, but in bis acting he broke en
tirely away from tbe traditional Italian
Rigoletto and played bis role on tbe lines
of Victor Hugo's drama. The part gained
immensely by i-eing thus interpreted, ex
cept that so vivid and lifelike was the act
ing mat one almost lorgot the singer in
the tragedian.
The scenes in which Albers rose to tbe
greatest heights of tragic power were those
where Riuoletto seeks and meets Gilda in
the Duke's palace. * Albers enters singing
the gay "Li, La," which suddenly breaks
and changes to a sob as the jester looks
feverishly for signs of hid daughter's
presence.
Tbe aria in which he pleads with the
mocking courtiers for the return of his
daughter, ."Rendez la moi," was a tine
piece of lyric pleading, and the scene
culminated in a splendid outburst of ter
ror, changing to tierce rage, as the jester
cowers before Monterone's malediction,
and in hs turn heaps maledictions on the
head of Gilda's betrayer.
All through the opera", however, Albers
did brilliant work, and won constant
marks of appreciation from the audience.
Massart was an excellent Duke of
Mantua. His acting was, as usual, stereo
typed, but be sang brilliantly and made
love to Gilda in the garden scene with an
ardor which won him enthusiastic ap
plause.
Although Mme. Berthet's voice is
lighter than those one is accustomed to
hear in the role of Gilda, she sang the
florid trusic with charming ease and
fluency and acted so prettily that she
made a distinct hit in the part and shared
in the honors . with Massart and Henri
Albers.
Mine. Andree Savini was a good Made
leine, Chateau delivered Monterone's
malediction effectively, Javid did well as
Sparafucile and the little roles were in
good handy. The choruses were passable,
but the orchestra, under the direction of
M. Nicasias, contributed largely to the
success of the performance.
On Saturday night "Carmen" will be
the bill. --.v xy
MET DEATH OUT AT SEA.
Andrew Thompson, Mate of the
John N. Ingalls, Killed
in a Storm.
The Main-Boom Tackle Gave Way
and a Swinging Block Crushed
in His Skull.
The little trading schooner John N.
Ingalls rocked mournfully at anchor about
half a mile off Meiggs wharf last night.
Down below in one of the neat rooms the
body of Andrew Thompson, who had
sailed thousands of knots on the vessel as
her first mate, lay, the skull crushed in by
a blow received from a broken tackle late
Wednesday evening. \,:
Yesterday at 6:45 p. m. the schooner
sailed into port, 28 days from San Bias,"
Mex., and dropped her anchor. .
Captain Thomas last evening told the
story of the accident which resulted in
the death of Mate Thompson. "We were
sailing along about thirty miles off the
Farallones," he said, "in a brisk south
wester.
"The sea was very heavy,* and as a mat
ter of precaution we had every stitch of
canvas double-reefed. Every now and
then the boat would rock and wallow and
whip tbe main boom back and forth as
though it were light as a feather. .
"I was standing at the wheel and the
mate was just in front of me when we ran I
into an .unusually rough sea.. I was
afraid that something would break and had
just shouted to th* mate to keep a sharp
lookout when the main boom tackle,
which was secured to the starboard rail
just aft of the after rigging, gave way.
"The tackle flew through the air, drawn
by the boom as it swung over, like the
1 lash of a whip.
:. "The heavy block struck Thompson on
the forehead nnd he fell "dead without
even a groan. 1 was knocked down by a
piece of swinging rope, . but I soon regained
my feet. " . â¢'-' .'-:*
"As soon as we could secure the boom
we carried Thompson's body below and
laid it on the bunk he used to occupy. All
last night I watched the .body, and I will
do the same to-night and as many ni hts
as are necessary, for the mate was a splen
did fellow.. We all liked him and mourn
his death." .. *

Â§ Sometimes* when
the la*t spark of life
seems almost extin- 9
guished "it is fanned
into flange again by
prompt, vigorous ac-
tion. It is a mistake
however, to put off
â¢action too long; an-
other mistake is to
despair too easily.
Both these miptakes
are made in dealing
with disease, par-
ticularly' with con-
etintption. It is neg-
lected at first until,
someone names it.
Then the name
terror to the
' mind ; the # nature of
the disease'is misnn-
stood: It is a
blood disease, set-
tled in the lungs. . If
. it settled somewhere
| -else the doctors
*^ " - would give it a dif-
ferent name : â scrofula, kidne^ disease or
"liver complaint."* But the name only tells
where it settles. It is really all one dis-
ease : â Bad blood; and there '; is only one
cure : Good blood. *â¢â "â¢â¢
An abuddance of good, rich, red, blood put
Into the circulation, cures every orife of these
complaints, consumption as well-as the rest
âif it hasn't gone too far. g It is on this true
physiological principle proven by ex-
perienceâthat Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery cures* Consumption and all other
blood diseases. It tones up the' blood-mak-
ing 'organs to produce a fresh supply of
healthy,' red blood ; this carries new nour-
ishment and life to the wasted lung tissue ;
or any other tissue ; that is affected. :It
drives out the poisonous disease - germs
which clog the skin, liver or kidneys*. It is
simply a question of purifying and building
up ; where there is anything left to build on
the "Golden Medical Discovery " will in- '
fallibly buildup and cure. It-cures cases
which doctors declare "incurable.''' That
word has lost its meaning ; ance Doctor
