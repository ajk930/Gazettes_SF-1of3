Arms Over Cret?.
LONDON. Exg., April sâ The Times
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Athens saying that the impatience with
which the present' condition of affairo is
increesinp, and that the demands are
made irom various quarters for an imme
diate declaration of war by Greece against
Turkey.
The King's inactiou is denounced by
those who are anxious for the opening of
hostilities. The Government journals con
tinue to enjoin the public impatience, but
they haye little influence.
It is whispered that if the Government
delays much longer to effect the national
mandate the pentup tide 01 patriotism
will burst not only on the frontier, but in
Athens. The seed of discontent is sown
by enemies of the Government, who circu
late the report that a humiliating surren
der is meditated Even the Kin?, despite
the sympathy felt for him and the popu
lar feeling in his favor, does not escape
malignant criticism.
The daily arrival of volunteers adds fuel
to the flames of excitement. These vol
unterrs aie really a source of weakness
and add to tne embarassments of mili
tary authorities, who must provide them
with arms and uniforms and transport
them to the frontier, notwithstanding fre
quent unfitness.
One hundred and fifty Cyprians arrived
in Athens to-day. They marched through
the streets bearing with them a banner
demanding the union of Cyprus and
Greece.
In the House of Commons to-day G. N.
Curzon, Under Foreign Secretary, stated
in answer to a question by Right Hon.
John Morley that all of the European
powers except Germany had landed troops
in Crete. Germany, he added, had not
explained why she hai refrained from
sending troops as the other powers had
done.
Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, First Lord of
the Treasury, *aid that Great Britain
would not hesitate to participate In a
blockade of Greece if such action became
necessary in the interests of peace.
Sir William Harcourt, the leader of the
opposition, said that it was his desire tbat
the country should Know the policy of the
Government more definitely than it was
known at present, and he therefore gave
notice that he would move an address to
the Queen.
Balfour said that the ministerial major
ity wouid give a day to be devoted to do
bating a motion directing a vote of cen
sure against the Government, but he
would not promise yet whether or not
they would grant a day for debating put
in the form indicated by the notice given
by Sir William Haroourt
S;r William asked whether the Turkish
troops would be withdrawn from Crete
and whether the British forces would take
part in a blockade of Greece. Upon these
matters be desired the Government to
make a dehnite statement and also to in
dicate the policy of the Government in re
gard to Crete and Greece.
.Balfour said that the date of the with
drawal of the Turltish troops from Crete
bad not yet been fixed. In the mean
time, he said, the powers were making a
joint declaration to the Government at
Athens and to the Government at Con
stantinople, as the result of wh eh it
wr<= hoped that peace would be main
tained. This declaration was that in the
event of a conflict upon the Greek frontier
the aggressor would be answerable for all
the consequence* of a disturbance of
peace, to which the powers attached the
greatest importance, and also that what
ever might be the result of a struggle be
tween Greece ani Turkey the powers
Would not consent that the aggressors
â¢iiould derive the elighteÃt advantage
therefrom.
The Constantinople correspondent of
the Standard telegraphs tiiat since Sun
day morning the TurJcish military prepa
rations, which had been suspended for
some days, had been renewed with great
energy. The Sultan to-day summoned a
military council, which sat until a late
hour to-night.
Twenty battalions of reserves belong
in r to the Second Army Corps have been
ordered to mobilize.
CANEA, Crete, April s.â The Russian
Consul here requested the Governor to ex
plain the attack mat was made by Bashi-
Bazotiks Saiurday on the insurgents on
the Akrotiri peninsula, whiie the latter,
acting on the consent of the foreign ad
mirals, were about to retire to the interior
of the island. The Governor's reply was
very brief, ho remarking that tho circular
issued on March 25 placed the whole police
iorce ot Cansa and environs of the city in
tbe hands of the commanders.
Tbe admirals will hold an inquiry into
the arming of the Moslem refugees who
have flocked into Canea since the begin

in Saturday's attack upou the Christians
under the eyes of the foreign military
commanders and the Kuns of the foreign
warships. The admirals will also inquire
as to the number of rifle- that are now in
tho Turkish Government depot. Tbey
will also ascertain what, if any, measures
have been taken by tne Turkish officials
to deport refugees from the island.
The presence of a force of international
troops in the blockhouse at Bucksonaria
has had the effect of preventing the in
surgents from attacking that point. To
day strong bodies of insurgents approached
the blockhouse from several directions
and made a concurrent attack upon it.
The garrison replied with artillery. The
fighting lasted four hours.
As staed yesterday tne disarming of
the Basbi-Bazouks who participated in
the fighting on the peninsula of Akrotiri
trai not a complete success, owing to the
fact that those who first reached the gates
of the city and had their arms taken Irani
tliem subsequently returned along the
Suda road and warned their comrades not
to take their weapons intoCanea. To-day
a search for the weapons that were hidden
resulted in the finding of a number of
them. The work will be proceeded with
until the arms of the Basbi-Bazouks are
taken from them.
The admirals commanding the foreign
fleets to-day made a vigorous demand
upon the Governor to explain why he had
armed the Bashi-Bazouks despite his
promise not to do so. They have also in
sisted upon the surrender to them of
tweive oi the leaders of Saturday's attack.
It is thought that interesting complica
tions will follow if the Governor refuses to
surrender the ringleaders.
Of the 4000 rifles that were distributed
to the Moslem refugees only 400 nave been
returned.
LARISSA, Greece, Anril 5. â Crown
Prince Constantine, who is in command
of the Greek troops in Thessaly, to-day
issued the following ecneral order, which
was called for by the fact that to-morrow
is the seventy-sixth anniversary of the
raising by the Greeks of the standard of
the cross against the Crescent which led
to Grecian independence of Turkish rule.
It was generally thought that the remem
brance o! the war of 1821 would lead the
Greek troops to commit some overt act
that would lead to ooen hostility against
the Turkish forces on the frontier, and it
Is this that the proclatiun of the Crown
Prince is designed to prevent. The order
says:
"In view of the (treat anniversary to be
celebrated to-morrow, I order all the
troops under my command to display the
utmost self-restraint and not to allow
themselves to be carried away by re
membrances of the glorious day. I am
sure the order will be respected. "
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 5.â
The Porte has issued a categorical denial

ROME, Italy, April s.â The new Italian
Parliament was formally opened this
morning by the King in person. Queen
Margherite was also present, and 40U Dep

but the Republican and Socialist Deputies
were absent.
The speech from the throne announced
tbe institution of a number of social and

outlined by the speech was received very
coldly, but the reference to the efficiency
of tbe army and navy was loudly ap
plauded.
Tbe King and Queen were cheered by

The speech from the throne declared

The speech forecasts a revision of tax

WHAT /S A LITHOGRAPH?
That Is the Question That Bobs Up in
Pennell's Suit for Libel Against
the Review.
LONDON. ETC., April s.â Toe Queen's
Bench division of the Hich Court of Jus
tice to-day beard an action of libel
brought by the artist, Joseph Penneli,
against the Saturday Review and Walter
Sickert, a writer on that paper, for the
publication of an article commenting
upon Mr. Pennell's exhibition of etchings
illustrating Washington Irving's "Val
abro."
The ground for the suit was the state
ment in the Review's article, which was
written by S;ckert, that Pennell had
sought to palm off as lithographs of his
owiÂ» works pictures which were mere
transfers of the work of others.
Among the witnesses who testified in
behalf of Pennell were J. M. Whistler,
Alfred Gilbert and Sydney Colvin. The
case raised the question, "What is a
lithograph?"
In his answer to this question, Mr.
Whistler said that to an artist there was
no distinction between work on stone,
zinc or paper, so long as the result was
his own work.
The article in the Saturday Review,
*which was the cause of Mr. Pennell's ac
tion against that publication, aliened thai
Mr. Whs:ler pursued the same course
which Mr. Pennell took in the manner of
drawing his work and the witness was
asked his opinion of the paper's references
to himself. Mr. Whistlsr replied: "lam
not angry over it, but merely vexed that
distinguished people like ourselves anould
be brought here Dy a gentleman who is
absolutely unknown to us."
Mr. Whistler said he was not surprised
to hear that the Royal Academy had re
jected the transfer lithographs, but he
was not au fait with the limitations of the
Royal Academy. [Laughter.] The case
was still on when adjournment was
taken.

WEYLER'S
HAND TO
BE STAYED
Uncle Sam Will Protest
Against the Shooting
of Rivera.
CIVILIZED WARFARE
MUST BE UPHELD.
Senator Allen's Resolution Is
Adopted After Vigorous
Argument.
BRUTAL TACTICS OF A ROBBER
NATION DENOUNCED.
Statesmen Bold y Declare That the
President Shouid Sew) a Fleet to
Check Spanish Baibirity.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April s.â ln
tbe Senate to-day the resolution offered
by Alleu (Poo.) of Nebraska on Thursday
last In regard to tbe drum-head court
martial on General Rivera in Cuba pre
cipitated quite an animated Cuban debate.
Allen's resolution declared it to be tue
duty of the United States to protest
against this violation of the laws of civil
ized warfare.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts declared
that the whole resolution was founded on
rumor, misunderstandinz and hearsay;
that tbe Senate has no facts to go upon
except newspaper rumors.
Allen retorted with some bitterness that
in the four years he had sat in the Sen
ate he had never be^n able once to intro
duce a resolution which had met the ap
proval ol the senior Senator from Massa
chusetts. For his own part he felt so
strongly on this matter that he would
grind into a million infinitesimal bits the
Spaniards unless they relaxed their cruel
treatment of the Cubans.
Allen read dispatches from the various
newspapers concerning the capture of
Rivera and also tbo report that Weyler
would soon have him shot. He said in
answer to a question by Gray (D.) of Dela
ware that the only charge known is that
Rivera was in rebellion against Spain.
Allen declared that the United States
had a right to express an opinion on this
question. Weyler was not conducting a
civilized modern warfare. The Senate, he
said, had expressed its opinion regarding
the massacre of Armenians by Turks.
Cuba, he said, was only a hundred
miles from our coast and the island had
been drenched with blood for several
years. Women and children nad been
murdered, rapine, outrage, butchery
practiced, and yet Senators say we are not
10 raise our voice while these awful butch
eries by the Spaniards continue. The
United States should not remain idle
while Cuba was being destroyed. For
centuries Snain has been an out
law nation and no great nation should
honor or respect her. We should say to
Spain: "If you conauer Cuba, you should
do it through civilized methods."
Allen held up Hoar and others to ridi
cule fur changing front. He said they
oucht to join all the patriots in checking
this bloodshed. All demanded, he said,
that President McX nley would send our
navy to Cuba and ii McKinley were firm
war would cease.
Replying to Allen Hoar said he was
willing to deal with the question spirit
edly, but he rejected with indignatiou the
insinuation that he was influenced by
busntss interests. War meant misery,
de-pair, etc., but if national honor was at
stake, Hoar saiii, he would go as far as
Allen in condemninz Spain. Nothing,
however, should be done on guesses.
Alien then read from the Record to
prove what he said Hoar did on April 2.
Gallinger was no less bitter in his de
nunciations, and he expressed his pro
fonnd conviction that when any great na
tion resorted to cruelty and barbarity to
subdue a people fighting for liberty and
independence it was the duty of the
American Republic to take cognizance of
it and to put an end to it at the shortest
possible date.
Hale (R.) of Maine moved that the reso
lution of Allen be referred to the Com
mittee on Foreien Relations. After quite
an animated debate the motion to reler
was lostâ ayes 21, noes 27.
Two suggested amendments of phrase
ology were adopted and the resolution
then read in substance tbat information
had come lo the Senate that General Ruiz
Rivera was to be tried by court-martial
and shot, and that in the judgment of the
Senate it was the duty of the United
S:ateÃ, in case this information proved
true, to protest to the Spanish Govern
ment against such a violation of the rules
of civilized warfare. This was adopted by
a vote of 44 ayes and no noe?.
The resolution as agreed to reads as fol
lows:
Whereas, Information has come to the Sen
ate tliaiUeneral Ruiz Rivera, a leader of tho
Cuban army of independence, recently cap
tured by the Spanish force?, is to be tried by
drumhead court-martial and sbot; therefore,
Resolved, That in the judgment of the Senate
it is the duty of the President cf the United
States, if such iuiormation be found to be
true, to protest to the Spanish Government
against such a violation oi the rules of civil
ized warfare.
VUIGEXEItALKJ> BY C. (t MI Z
Failing to Capture the Cuban Chief,
iteyl-r Hill Retort to Bribery.
NEW YORK. N. Y. April 5.â A dis
patch to the Herald from Havana says:
General Weyler'a two weeks' excursion to
Santa Clara has been utterly without re
sult from a military point of view, and
causes bitter comment here, as it was ex
pected that he would at least operate in
force against the insurgents which are
positively known to be at Arroya Blanco
under Gomez.
One explanation which lias been sug
gested regarding General Weyler's puz
zling tactics is that failing to make head
way against Gomez by military tactics he
is now working out a plan whereby an
elaborate attempt will be made through
bribery to capture Gomez and his|escon
as Rivera is alleged to have been cap
tured in Pinar del Rio â that is, by having
an overwhelming force guided by a traitor
so as to hurry to surround the rebel camp
in the night.
Before Weyler left Havana there was
mvc â > talk of a combined movement of
the columns to drive Gomez into a corner
where ha must tight or attempt to break
through the trocha, which was said to be
impa>sable. But the much vauuted flying
columns vrere disordered by Gomez witn
om necessity of attacking the trocba;
whic.li no one doubts he couJd have crossed
at any one 01 a dozen points had it been
necessary.
General Weyler is coming back from his
fruitless eastern trip soon, and will an
nounce the pacification of all the country
west of the trocha, and news direct from
his camp assure tnat he can mobilize
3000 men in and along the Puerto Principe
and Santa Clara boundary at the shortest
notice.
The fact is that the insurgents of Puerto
Principe and Santa Clara are active, and
the Spanish despair' of pacification in a
reasonable time. Spain's resources will
not permit of her keeping a ereat army
here another summer, even with
out activity in the field. One thing is cer
tain, if the interior garrisons are with
drawn the insurgents will control tbe
island at once, and when the columns are
no longer feared will make a demonstra
tion against Havana.
Ruiz Rivera has not yet been shot, and
is not likely to be soon, unless General
Weyler has his way. General Weyler is
said 10 be ansry that the Madrid Govern
ment has taker, a hand in the disposition
oi Rivera's case and will not permit the
summary execution of Mnceo's successor.
The fact is Rivera's life will probably be
spared, not from motives of humanity,
but bscause the shooting of this man
would incite civilized nations against
Spam.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
TO REVIVE
AMERICAN
SHIPPING
Elkins of West Virginia
Makes a Strong Plea
in the Senate.
TELLING ARGUMENT IN
URGING A BILL.
The United States Must Enter
tte Uruggle With England
for Marine Supremacy.
BUT A FREE -SHIP POLICY IS
DANGEROUS HERS.
With the Encouragement of tlie ProÂ«
posed R bite of Duties the Build
ing of Vessels Wculd Increase.
WASfiINGTON, D. C, April s.â The
galleries of the Senate were crowded to
day with New England excursionist?. As
the morning hour hac expired Morgan's
resolution extending belligerent rights to
both Spain and Cuba, offered last Thurs
day, went over until to-morrow.
Elkins (R. ) of West Virginia addressed
the Senate in support of his bill to allow a
rebate of 10 per cent on customs duties in
favor of merchandise imported in vessels
of the United States. lie opened his
speech with the explanation that under a
proper policy of encouragement to Ameri
can shipping the United States with its
8000 mile 9of sea coast, its navigable rivers
and lake coasts, fine harbors, variety of
climate, productive capacity, rapidly in
creasing population, its position on the
globeâ Asia on one side with 600.000.000
and Europe on the other side with -100,
--000,000 people, should bethe leading com
mercial and maritime power of the world.
The people of the United States bad not
daring the last thirty years, Elkins said,
given to shipping the attention it deserved.
They paid $500,000 a day to foreign sbip-
owners for carrying what the people sold
and bought. Tat enormous sum, or
most of it, should be saved to the country
and would be saved under a proper policy
of aid to shipping.
The United States had a common inter
est in the oceans and seas of the world
and should share in the fruits and bene
fits that arise from occupying them with
its vessels; especially should it have tna
largest share in carrying its own foreign
trade.
To restore our lost shipping and place
the United States where it belongs in the
carrying trade of the world would in
volve a great contest â chiefly with Eng
land â not of arms, but as friendly rivals
for commercial supremacy. Great Britain
would resist every step in the direction of
restoring American shipping. One of the
reasons urged against the passage of the
bill unaer consideration is that Great
Uritain and other ship-owning countries
will retaliate. But should European
countries adopt retaliation they will do it
in a way not to increase the cost of our
farm products to their people. Two-thir.la
of all our exports to Great Britain are food
products, and she cannot afford to in
crease the price of these products to her
people. It is doubtful whether England
would retaliate; to do so would be to
adopt protection and reverse her free*
trade policy.
As to the plan or policy of free ships
Elkins declared his opposition to it, and
said: "So far as our ship-building inter
est is concerned, the free-ship policy
would reduce us to a state of dependency
and vassalage. Because we can buy ships
cheaper from foreign builders is not a
sufficient reason for doing so. If wo
wouJd pursue tbis policy we never would,
build our own ships, and in the event of
war between other countries and the
United States our commerce would bo
swept from the seas."
The passage of this bill would provide
business for our ships which they do not
now have and cannot get under present
conditions. Under the provisions this act
will not take effect for fifteen months after
its passage. Ships can ba built and got
ready for the new business that will come
to them.
If American ships could havÂ»the carry
ins: of our imports which would cive
them regularly the incoming carco to the
United States this would put them In a
position to compete with foreign ships for
outgoing cargoes, especially tramp ship 3
coming io our ports in balhist. lc is esti
mated that more than 5000 foreign vessels
came to our ports in 1594 in ballast in
search of return cargoes. It may be said
that other ship-owning countries, espe
cially Great Britain, would retaliate and
not allow American vessels to haul their
imports. In case of retaliation we might
not transport in American ships our ex
ports to ship-owning countries, but we
would be in a position to successfully
compete for and take the business of car
rying exports from the United States to
countries not owning ships; we would
gain this in addition to carrying our im
ports in our own ships. It is believed
that among the goo 1 results that will
follow the passage of this bill one will be,
and not th .â¢ least, it will hasten the crea
tion of a department of commerce so
much needed and so ably championed by
the distinguished chairman of the Senate
Committee on Commerce (Frye).
In conclusion Mr. Elkins said: "I haya
trisd in what I have said to present the
cause of American shipping to the Senate
and to the country, and make this appeal
in its behalf. If I do nothing more than
draw attention to the facts and help to
add to the interest already aroused in this
great subject I will feel amply lewarded
for whatever I .have done or may do here
after. If any plan better than the ova
B2
propoaed here can be suggested I wiil ac
cept it, although it must be insisted that
the policy of discriminating duties sanc
tioned by the founders of our Government
and tried for more than thirty years with
the best results has again rdtfeived the ap
proval of the people in the Mast National
election and should at least have another
trial.
"The revival of American shipping, so
lone neglected, is not the result of any
party nor of auy particular interest; it
belongs to no pection ; it concerns the
whole country, its future prosperity and
welfare; i:s has become the cause of
70,000,000 of people, henceforth they will
take care of it; in tlieir keeping it will no
longer languish and die.
"I feel that sooner or later the patriotic
cause of upbuilding American shipping
will triump â  and Americans will enjoy
and u-e their common snare in the oceans
of the world and have their part in their
carrying trade; that the time is not dis
tant when the American fla^ wiil be seen
on every sea and float from vessels of the
United States in all portaof the earth, and
American merchants, business men and
banners will i c established and doing re
munerative business in all commercial
center*.'*
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky addressed the
Senate in favor of the bankruptcy bill.
The Senate adopted a resolution offered
some time instructing ago the Committee
on Civil Service and Retrenchment to in
vestigate the case of the discharged em
picyes from the Bureau of Animal Indus
try in South Omaha, Nebraska, for mere
political reasons, and also one offered to
day for a line investigation of the dis
missal of eiehty-tive colored persons from
the Bureau of Eneraving and Printing in
Waehington for no other cause than that
of color.
A bill was introduced by Chandler (R.)
of New Hampshire, abolishing competi
tion in trade productions and authorizing
commissions to enable merchants, manu
facturers and producers of commodities,
subject to interstate commerce, to main
tain prices and make protits notwithstand
ing business depression. He explained
that he had no intension ot urging its pas
sage unless in the case of the passage of
the bill to allow railroad pooling. It was
characterized by Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
as "the rankest kind of Populism," cud
Allen added that "in the palmiest days of
Populism no man was ever wild enough
or long-haired enough to introduce a bill
of that kind."
A joint resolution was introduced by
Bate(D. ) of Texas, and was passed unani
mously, authorizing the President to
direct the surgeon-general of the Marine
Hospital Bureau to distribute all availa
ble supplies of tents, blankets, food and
medicine and to purchase such further
supplies as may be needed for the suffer
ers by tlie Mississippi floods.
The Senate at 5 o'clock adjourned.
GLOBE SAVINGS BANK CLOSED.
Receirer Appointed tor a Well - Known
Chicago Concern â Debts to Be
All fed in Tune.
CHICAGO. 111., April s.â The Globe
Savings Bane did not open its doors this
morning. Later the Chicago Title and
Trust Company was appointed receiver.
The capital stock of the bank is $200,000.
A few days ago an assessment of 50 per
cent on its capital stock was made, and it
iB supposed the tardy response on the
part of the stockholders is the causa of the
failure.
Mr. Churchill in an interview said:
"The assessment was made by order of
the State .Bank Examiner, who thought
that some of our assets were not very
good. He objected to items amountinp
to $103,324 and ordered this amount
charged up to profit and loss, and an as
sessment of $100,000 made to cover the de
ficiency.

The ex-Collector writes that he Is now

action toward clearing the record, but the
probability is that Leavy will be acquitted
of any knowledge or participation in the
frauds.
The ambition of Frank Coombs of Cali

FELL THROUGH A TRESTLE.
Disastrous Wreck of an Engine and Fl
-teen Cars on the Pennsylvania
Railroad.
PITTSBURG, Pa., April 5.â A disas
trous railroad wrecK took place here this
mornin?, disastrous to property, but for
tunately only one man was killed. A
freight train on the Pennsylvania railroad
was about to cross the Ohio River bridge
at 6:15 this morning, and when on the
approaches broke through the trestle over
Hanover street.
The engine and fifteen cars fell into the
street below, completely blocking the
thoroughfare. The trestle broke under
the engine, whicn went down first, and
the cars came down on top of it.
So great was the mass of failen carÂ« and
timbers from the bridge that considerable
time elapsed Before it could be found
what lobs of life had actually occurred.
When the engine was finally reached
the engineer was found to be alive, but
was terribly crushed and wili probably
die. The fireman was lying under the
wreckage and was dead when taken
out. Five other men riding on the train
were very badiy hurt, but will probabiy
recover.
The cause of the accident is not yet
known, but a rigid examination into it
will be held. The trestle that gave way
to-day had frequently held much heavier
trains and was supposed to be perfectly
aafe.

Peculiar Conduct tf a Lawyer Who It
*unt Him Own JUvarce.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 5.-A Sun
special from Atlanta says: John M. Petrie,
a lawyer of Marietta, has discounted law
yers of Chicago in securing dlvoroes with
secrecy and dispatch. He began to prac
tice only about a year ago.
The trial of a case in the Cobb Superior
Court last week developed a curious state
of affairs. Joe Robertson was indicted,
tried and convicted of living with Georgia
Lester, contrary to law. He contended
that he had been divorced from his first
wife and was lawfully married to his sec
ond. A paper was exhibited in court pur
port ing to be a divorce granted Robertson
at the November term, the jury verdict
signed by Asker Dobbs, foreman, and the
decree signed by George F. <i bier. Judge
and W. R. Montgomery, Clerfc of Court. '
Robertson suid he lisd paid $35 for his
services and Petrie had furnished him
with that paper. He said he thought he
was legally divorced, and had applied to
and obtained from Juage Stone the ordi
nary marriage license, and was married
to Georgia Lester last December. The
name signed to the verdict of the sup
posed jury is that of a man whose name is
not in the jury-box. The signature of the
decree is a clumsy effort to imitate the
Judge's peculiar ciiirography.
A rule has been issued by Judge Gobler
against Petrie to appear before him and
show cause why he should not be stricken

from the bar aa an attorney. Tut- Sheriff
has so far been unable to find Petrie to
serve the papers. An investigation has
been made which shows that Petrie had
established a divorce bureau of his own,
in which he granted decrees and collected
fees without any reference to trials by
court

Colonel Tafel will be the first Democratic

RUN OF THE BATTLE-SHIP IOWA.
The Big Modern Vessel Makes a Success

an Hour.
BOSTON, Mass., April s.â The battle
ship lowa was given a preliminary run
to-day over the Cape Ann course, where
she will have her final trial spin on
Wednesday.
The trial as far as it went was thor
oughly successful. The lowa was sent
over the first half of the course after she
had done come "jockeying" to warm up
her engines. She accomplished the thirty
three miles in the remarkably good time
of one hour and fifty-five minutes and
tweiity-one seconds, or at the rate of 17.16
knots an hour.
The conditions under which this was
accomplished were not the most iavorable,
for, while the sea was as smooth as could
bs wished, the wind was directly aft,
about the worst direction it could blow
from to insure a good draught.
After the first leg of the return journey
Had been covered at a rattling pace the
vessel ran into a dense fog bank and

"While in the West I had pleasant inter

"1 am sure tne Jockey Club in no ruling

BOSTON, Mass., April 5â Mrs. Mary
Lincoln, aged 93, died in Bristol, R. 1.,
to-day after fasting forty-eight days. The
case is considered a most remarkable one.
the was in very good physical condition
and was brightand cheerful until six weeks
ago, when attacked with the final illness
which caused her to declare against any
more food.
Physicians from all over New England
have puzzied over the case lor weeks, at
tempting every known means to get sus
tenance into her system, but her strange
disease baffled science.
While conscious of all that was going
on abouv her, Mrs. L'ncoln said she did
not care for anything more to eat. She
was determined and actually starved to
death in the midst of plenty. She slept a
great deal during her illness which wns
somewhat refreshing to her, but her ereat
constitution was undermined more and
more each day as she went without food.
This is not only one of thÂ« longest fists
on recori, b'tt it is the only case where a
person anywhere near her great anÂ» ever
lived for any length of time under such
remarkable circumstances. Sha was very
patient and seldom complained. She had
no i rganic disease whatever.
Mrs. Lincoln was widely known in
Bristol and highly respected. She leaves
three sisters, all advanced in years. A
brother, William Lndsey, died only six
weeks ago after he had just called on his
sister, Mrs. Lincoln, and arranged for her
funeral. She was one of a family of ten
children.

Rear- Admiral George Brown, who reaches
the, preÃcripiive age three months from

. Rear-Admiral Ramsay has been identi

years, having â¢ been appointed from Penn

that of miilshipmau â a grade no longer
existing in the American navy. >â ;;.â 
He saw considerable service during the
war and was rapidly advanced' because of
bis conspicuous merit. Since he became
rear-admiral, â  three years ago , to-day, he
has not had command of a fleet, and has
enjoyed the unique distinction of being
the only fleet officer in the navy who had
never commanded a fleet.
This has been due to the desire of the
former Secretary of the Navy to keep him
in a position where he could pet the full
benefit of his fairness and his great knowl
edge of naval affairs. His retirement will
bring about the promotion to the rank of
rear-admiral of Montgomery Sicarc 1 , now
commander of the Brooklyn Navy-yard.

Death.

Pass a Night of Torture, and Are
Discovered When Only Their
Heads Are in Sight
BEDDING, Cal., April s.â Michael Mc-
Crellan and Michael Gleason of Jackass
Flat, this county, have no fault to tind
with Providence to-day. Were they given
to prayer, the two Michaels would have
spent much of the time since early Sunday
morning on their knees pouring out their
thanks for deliverance from a horrible
death. But they have not yet recovered
from the awful suspense and torture expe
rienced when one sees the end of his career
approaching and is powerless to escape;
when he cries out in anguish and there is
none to hear his shrieks and resce him.
For hours these men suffered mentnl and
phys.cal anguish, and that they are alive
is due to one of the Btrokes of rare good
fortune which come to few creatures on
earth.
McCrellan and Gleason were returning
home Saturday evening Irom tneir liba
tions at a neighboring winery, and, being
somewnat confused as to tneir bearings,
tliey wandered unconsciously into the red
shckens of the Valentine <fe Chapman re
straining dam in Jackass Gulch. The red
slickens were as sticky &i mud and treach
erous as quicksand, and they could not
extricate themselves unaided. The more
tliey struggled the deeper they sank.
They were lield as though in a vise.
Tnroughout the night the two men, so
bered t>y the appreciation of their danger,
raised their voices in frantic cries for as
sisiauce, but none were near to hear them.
Siowiy they sank into the treacherous
mire. It reached their waists, and their
lower limbs became benumbed by the
pressure. The hours passed until the
dawu of the Saobath day began to lighten
the east, and the red mass had risen until
only their heads and shoulders remained
above it. It seemed to the men as though
the tentacles of a monster octopus had en
circled their chests. They breathei in
gasps, and horrible pains shot through
their bodies. They had given up hope of
a rescue, and their half-stifled cries were
less frequent.
At 6 o'clock the men had sunk in the
slickens until only their heads were free.
It became oniy a question- of minutes
when their torture would be at an end.
The demijohn of liquor which they car
ried had Jon? before disappeared from
View, and was finding its way to the bot
tom of the slimy mass.
Suddenly McCrellan and Gleason beard
a shout. Mr. Chapman had arisen from
bed eariier than was his wont on Sunday
mornings, and Had gone for a stroll down
to the dam. He saw the heads of the two
unfortunates sticking up above the bed of
slickens. Shouting to Jet them know that
relief was at hand, he dashed back for as
sistance. Planks were laid above the red
disii bot*. and ten minutes iater McCrellan
and Gleason had been dragged by willling
hands from their loathsome prison.
The two men are still dazed from their
bsir-raising experience, and neither has
so far recovered his equanimity as to sug
gest to the other that they resume their
libations where they suddenly came to an
end.

CLOVERDALE, Cal., April s.â George
G. Victerson, ex-proprietor of the City
Restaurant and Hotel, who mysteriously
disappeared last Sunday evening, leaving
a host of creditors to mourn his departure
has not since been heard from. His young
wife and one-year-old child who, it was
first reported, had accompanied him, but
who in reality he delibeiately deserted,
are stopping with Mrs. Vicserson's pa
rents, Mr. and Mrs. Peter McKenna, old
time residents and highly esteemed in
Sonoma County. . . Â»;â¢;&;â :
An invoice of the furniture and fixings
In the suspended restaurant reveals the
fact that mere is only a valuation of about
quarter the amount of Vickerson's debts.
Mrs. Vickerson is almost heartbroken,
and it is rumored that she will probably
apply for a divorce on the grounds of will
ful desertion and failure to provide.

VANCOUVER, 8.C., April 5.-British
Columbia is not to be suffered to become a
second Hawaii as regards flooding by Ja
panese coolie labor. The Provincial Leg
islature has, to the general satisfaction of
the white workers, passed an act abso
lutely forbidding under penalty the em
ployment of either Japanese or Chinese or
undertaking possessing charter right*
rranted by the Legislature. The Japan
ese Consul will, it is thought, protest at
OttiW3, and seek to get the act disallowed
by the Governor-General in Counc.l, ia
which case there will be trouble in British
Columbia.

County Assessor, has called in eight of
his nine field deputies, although their
work is only half done. Under the new
county government law the salary of As
sessor, including his deputies' compensa
tion, is greatly reduced; hence Gibson's
action. Most of his work will now be done
in his office.

must be made and those which may be
made were stated by the City Attorney in
an elaborate opinion read at the meeting
cf the Mayor and the Common Council
this evening.
Most important among these is the fact
that four members of the Council retire,
leaving the four others to constitute that
body until their successors and one other
are elected one year hence. Those who
retire are: Tbomass C. Hogan, First
Ward; A. S. ilangrum, Second Ward;
E. P. Main, Third Ward; J. P. Jarman,
Fourth Wanl. The Holdovers are: W. T.
Nolting First Ward; J. P. Fay, Second
Ward; George B. Dittus, Third Ward;
Julius KriÂ°g, Fourth Ward.
The Mayor must, with the consent of
the Council, appoint a city clerk and he
may appoint a city attorney and a city
engineer also, with the consent of the
Council.
Four library trustees must be appointed
in the same manner and one may be ap
pointed, as the charter places the number
oi trustees at five, but provides for the ap
pointment ol but four in the interim be
tween now and the election of an appoin;
ing board.
In the same way five Park Commission
ers and four member-, of the Board of
Health may be appointed, and one mem
ber of the latter body mv.st he appointed.
The Council, as at present constituted,
will hold one more meeting. This will be
on Saturday evening, when an effort will
be made to settle up all the business on
hand and leave the desks clear lor the re
oreanized body.
AU the members were present at tte
meeting this evening, and all matters
were disposed of promptly. Besides the
renting of the leport of the City Attorney,
there was considerable to attract the at
tention of the Council. An ordinance was
adopted prohibiting reckless driving and
conduct liable to Â«care horses or annoy
pe^ons passing along ih*Â» streets. The
contract for the Eight:.-street sewer was
awarded.
In the new busmen? considered was an
ordinance which will create a commction
among the Chinese laundry men, as it pre
vents the sprinkling of clothes by means
of the mouth. It was given first readinj*
and will be adopted at the next meeting.
BICYCLE PATH TO SAN JOSE.
Garden Ci'y Wheelmen Favor the Con
struction of the Proposed Course
From Oak land.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April s.â The project
on foot among some of the prominent
wheelmen of this city, Oakland and San
Francisco to construct a wooden bicycle
path between San Jose and Oakland is
favorably looked upon by cyclers. A San
Jose contractor has given an estimate on
the work and offers to build the path for
$1100 a mile.
The distance to Oakland over the pro
posed route is about fifty miles. This
would make the c<~>Â«t foo.'OO. The pro
jectors believe that 25,000 bicvele riders in
and about San Francisco and Oakland
would subscribe $150 or Sj each; that
there are 5000 wheelmen in this county
who would aid the fund; that, the wheel
men along the Una of the path would also
assist, so that if the mattet is properly
presented the project may be carried to a
successful result.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 1897.
UNDONE BY LOVE
FOR A WIDOW FAIR
Rancher Orth of Petaluma
Gets Into Jail at Los
Angeles.
Arrested on Complaint of the
Woman With Whcm H?
Had E oped.
She Takes R-ven<?e Wh a Ho Lsaves
Her to Raturn to Hxs Wife
and Child.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 5. âIf
Rancher Nicholas Ortii of Petaluma had
heeded the admonition of the senior
Weller to his son Samivel to "bevare of
the vidders,'' he would doubtless be a far
happier man than he is to-night. Mrs.
Magdalena Pickelhoff is a grass widow
and was a near neighbor of benedict Orth,
who has a wife and several children
on a chicken ranch near Petaluma.
The aforesaid widow was fair to look upon,
and in an evil hour Orth left home, wife
and children and little larrn to see the
world with the bewitching widow.
He is now in jail here, charged with
grand larceny, and Mrs. PickelhorT is the
complaining witness. Orth attempted to
'â¢shaKe" the widow and she retaliated.
This is the unrcmantic b- quel to a very
gay. romantic and speedy time.
Orth ana Mrs. PicKelhoff left Petaluma
on January 14 and went to San Francisco.
After doing San Francisco the pair, pass
ing for husband and wife, boarded a
steamer and went to San Diego. They took
a week's worth of climate there and then
came to Lob Angeles. Their pace had
about burned up their money, and Orth
sayt he was seized about the same time
with a feeling of remorse, and began lying
awake nights thinking of his family and
little ones away up in Fetaluma. He
wanted to go home.
In February Orth parted with the inter
esting widow and left her home, and she
did not hear anything more from her
missing friend. The lady grew angry at
being trifled with in this fashion and
swore to a complaint charging Orth with
theft. The warrant was issued from Jus
tice Young's court Word was received
some days ago that Orth was at ivtalurna
with his family, so Deputy Sheriff Barn
hill was sent with the warrants. Barnhill
lost no time in apprehending Orth and
bringing him to this city.
The prisoner arrived yesterday and vai
arraigned before Justice Young this
morning on a grand-larceny charge, and
his examination set for to-morrow, bail
being fixed at $ 1000. This* Orth could not
supply, and he was remanded to the
County Jail.
DWARFING CHILDREN'S FEET.
Los Angeles Humane Officers Will En
deavor to Check the Cruel Chinese
Custom,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April s.â At least
one Chinaman in this city has ascertained
that be cannot do what he pienses even
with his own offspring. Wong Si Hone,
one of the most influential merchants in
Chinatown, was arrested this morning by
Humane Officer Clark, charged with cru
elty to children. For some time past the
officers have repored to Clark that Wong
was in the habit of binding the feet of his
children, and as the operation appeared
to be a painful one they believed some
thing should be done to put a stop to it.
Tue officer visited Wong's place to-day
and there saw two little Cninese girls, one
7 and the other 9 years of age, whose feet
had been encased and bound in pieces of
stout cloth, which held them in a com
pressed position and prevented their
natural growth. Shoes and stockings in
closed the material over the feet. Clark
took charee of the children and arrested
Wong. The police surgeon will probably
be called on to pass judgment as to the
effect of the binding procjss on the feet.
If Clark succeeds in -convicting Wong it
will prove a sad blow to that particular
Chinese custom.
NO WINE AT COMMUNION.
Pastor Rice of the Los Angeles Universal
ist Church Announces an
Innovation.
LOS ANGELES, April s.â The **me cup
and the wine were forever ab .lished at the
Los Angeles Universalist Church yester
da3*, and those who participated in the
communion service were served with
prayer alone. Rev. A. A. Rice, the pas
tor, announced this innovation, and it was
a surprise to his congregation. The pas
ter was emphatic in his stand.
Rev. Mr. Rice said he did not believe in
passing wine aronnd among his congrega
tion, and Christians everywhere agreed
with him that such a course might be the
cause of placing temptation in the way of
those reformed from the drink habit.
Even the cup containing water, passed
from lip to lip as a symbol only, might
carry on its brim the deadly microbe.
The spiiit, not the letter of the law, was
what the teachings of Christ intended
man should follow, and, as the passing of
the cup was merely acting the letter of a
law, it was better to do away with it alto
gether than to sacrifice the spirit. 80
f here will be no more wine served at Mr.
Rice's church.

PORTLAND CHINESE SELL A GIRL.
Pretty Ah Lum Lee Wishes to Marry a
Christian, but Her Parents De
c de 0 he rwise.
PORTLAND, Ob., April 5â A curious
tale was unfolded in Judge Sears' court
this morning iii th 9 case of Ab Lum Lee,
a nineteen-year-old miss, who was habeas
corpused out of a Chinatown prison by a
citizen with benevolent and humane incli
nations, and then voluntarily went back
again to the owners of her body and soul.
Ah Lum Lee is as bright, neat and
pretty a Chinese girl as one wouid want
to see. She is well educated, talks Eng
lish well, and iaÂ« or was up to a few days
ago, as liberty-loving in her way as an
American girl. Lee Won Gow and his
wife are the girl's uncle and wife, and
they were trying to force her to marry a
countryman of their own selection, who
offered $300 for her.
Lum Lee's heart it seems was set upon
another, and she stormed and refused to
consent to marrying a heathen. Gow and
his wife imprisoned her in their apart
ments and subjected her to a vigorous
course of treatment, calculated to restore
her to reason and bring her to listening to
them.
Lum L-?e was "game," and thoush shut
up in a pen and poorly fed she defied them
and sa>d siie would marry a Christian
Chinaman, who is a cook in this city, or
else would die.
The news of Lum Lee's imprisonment
came to the ears of W. B. Millar on Sat
urday. Taking pity on the oppressed
Chinese girl he determined to invoke the
law in her behalf.
Lnm Lee made quite an impression in
the courtroom when she was placed on
the stand and told her story. She said
that her uncle and aunt had been trying
to compel her to marry a heathen. She
wanted to marry a Christian. Since the
trouble came up she had learned, she
said, that the man they wanted her to
marry was not a heathen after all.
He was a good Christian and worshiped
the right and only God. This was the sole
explanation offered for her change of
mind. She consented, slie said, to marry
according to her relatives' wishes, since
the proposed husband was not an idol
worshiper. It was scarcely satisfactory,
but it had to go all the same, and the
court had nothing left to do uut dismiss
the writ
OREGON'S POLITICAL FEUD.
Cause for the Delay in Seat nj Banker
Corbett in the United States
Senate.
PORTLAND, Or., April 5.â J. Thorburn
Ross, who accompanied Senator H. \V.
Corbett to Washington, returned to Port
land last evening.
"When we first reached Washington,"
remarked Mr. Ross, "we encountered a
very unkindly sentiment with reference
to the seatinc of Mr. Corbett. This we
soon discovered to arise from the fact that
false reports had reached the Senators, as
well as the Eastern press, with reference
to the contingency that rendered it in
cumbent upon Governor Lord to malce
the appointment.
"First we learned that the Legislature
of Oregon was held ud in order that Mr.
Corbelt might succeed Mr. Mitchell.
Another report which reached us, and
which we had much difficulty in running
down for the purpose of chancing the
public sentiment, was that Air. Mitchell,
before the adjournment of the Legislature,
bad, -.vith hid following, submitted ten
first-class names for that body to select
from, with the notice that the ex-Sanator
would withdraw from the field.
"This was naws to us, and while we
placed no credence in the report, we wired
to Senators Simon, Selling and Mackay
for enlightenment upon this point. Their
reply was that no such measure of com
promise had come from the Mitchell
forces, but that, on the contrary, the anti-
Mitchell members of the House and
Senate had mr.de advances of that nature,
which were repulsed.
"This telegram 1 exhibited to Senator
Hanna and several of his colleagues, and
their sentiment with respect to the seat
ing of Mr. Corbett at once underwent a
radical change."
Mr. Ross added that if the tariff debates
prevented the seating of Corbett during
the current special session, he would se
cure the recognition due him in De
cember.
TACOUA'S WATER FRONT WAR.
Quarreling Stevedoring Firms Delay the
Departure of the City of
Madras.
TACOMA, Wash., April s.â For nine
days the City of Madras, under charter to
load a cargo of lumber for Callao, has
been lying at the Tacoma Mill Company's
wharf ready to load and with the lumber
on band ready to be loaded,
but until this afternoon not a stick
has gone into her hold, all because
of v;ar between two stevedoring
linns from Port Townsend. Barneson &
Chilcat, until two years ago, practically
bad control of the field at Port Townsend,
and with agents here, captured the lum
ber-loading trade. Jones it Rothchild
have been making inroads on the
monopoly, and the feeling has become
intensely bitter.
When the Madras arrived Jones & Roth
child appeared with a stevedoring con
tract made with the owners of the vessel.
Bartlett <fc Steeb, local aeents for Barne-
Bon & Chilcat, claimed the right to load
the vessel under contract from the Ta
coma Mill. The captain would not allow
them to load and the Tacoma Mill would
not let Jones & Rothchild touch its lum
ber. The deadlock caused high limes on
tbe water front and several personal en
counters between employes of the rival
concerns, but no ono was badly hurt.
To-day .Bartlett A: Steeb produced an
other and later contract with the owners
of the vessel permitting ihem to load.
Then the cnptain save in. Jones & Roth
child now say they will libel the ship.

COLONEL FINIGAN
IS IN CONTEMPT
San Rafael Millionaire in
the Custody of ths
Sheriff.
Would Net Pay Alimcny to His
Wile, Who h Suing for
a Divorce.
Offers to Mortgage Alameda Property
to Appease Mrs. Finigan's
Wrath.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., April s.â Colonal
Peter A. Finigan was adjudged guilty
of contempt of court by Superior Judge
F. M. AuÃelotti this morning and ordered
confined in the County Jail until he obeys
the order of court and pays the sum of
$750 to his wife, Emily B. Finiean, as ali
mony and fees which Judge Angelotti al
lowed her. pending her proceeding* ior ui
vorce.
When the case was called this morning
J. P. Sweeney, the attorney for the mil
lionaire defendant, stated to the court
that Colonel Finigan bad been unable to
procure the necessary money, but that he
had property in Alameda of the value of
$30,000 which he was willing to mortgage
and pay his wife a sum which would more
than cover the costs in this case. Attor
ney Sweeney further said that he was
aware that this was not a strict compli
ance with the court's order, but Mr. Fini
gan was willing to make this sacrifice.
T. J. Crowley, acting as attorney for
Mrs. Finigan. said he would not consent
to this proposition. To his mind Colonel
Finigan had been trifling with the court;
he was well able to pay the sum of $750,
but resorted to these tactics to annoy and
retard the court. He said that it seemed
I strange that up to the time when Mrs.
Finigan had brought the action for divorce
the defendant was "rolling in money,"
but as soon as the case was commenced he
had suddenly become a pauper.
"Mr. Finigan's conduct in the entire
proceedings," said the plaintiff's attor
ney, "clearly showed that he was conceal
ing facts from the court. While he lived
in the finest hotel in the land, his wife
could starve to death. Up to the time of
the commencemen t of this action he could
go to the bank and draw his check for any
amount. Mr. Finigan thinks the county
jail is not big enough for him. He is
practicaiiy putting his finger to his nose
to his wife while he lives at, the finest
hotel."
Colonel Fiuigan' s attorney said that
the defendant was living at the Hotel
Rafael on his credit. He was not a pauper,
but his business was speculation, and
while one day ha might have a large
amount oi money, at another time he
would be without it, as was the case now.
Judge Angelotti remarked that he be
lieved that if Mr. Finigaa wanted to be
could have procured the sum ordered by
the court. Under the circumstances he
could only commit him to the custody of
the Sheriff until such time as the
money would be forthcoming.
Under Sheriff John Hannon took the
millionaire to dinner at noon.

due regard lor the public interests";
and whereas, Governor James H. Budii, having

LEWISTON, Idaho, April s.â The de

district has crated a demand for a new
traffic route for the transportation of con
centrates and smelting ores.
The Oregon Short Line is approaching
this mining belt from the soutii and will

REDDING. Cal., April 5 -The wild pig
ion excitement does not abate in tbe
"'eighborhood of Redding. Fora week or
o past local sportmen have been enjoying
are sport hunting wild pigeons along ihe
ecramento River between this city and
Anderson. The birds appeared in no un
usual numbers until yesterday, when newa
was brought in by James Fletcher, a
prominent miner living near Round Moun
tain, in the eastern part of Shasta County,
that there had appeared in that section a
flock of wiid pigeons outnumbering auy
Â»een there since the pioneer days of the
Middle West when flocks came in such
numbers as to darken the sun and break
the branches of the trees where they
roosted. Where the wild pigeons of the
early days ever went to was a mystery,
and the re appearace of the birds in Shasta
County is only adding to it.
Fletcher says that last Thursday, as he
was returning to his cabin from work at
liis mine, he neard a whirring noise be
hind him like the rush of a coming !-torm
of wind. Turninc his head ho saw a Bock
of wild birds, their specie not at that time
beinc reco.nized by him. The whirring
noise was only a prelude to a preat storm
yet to come. For probably live minutes,
he says, he sioou dazed, watching the
flight of the birds, that came by hundreds
and thousands. lie was ?o startlea and
-o lost in wonderment that he can give
no adequate description of the size of the
flock, or mafee any estimate of the num
ber; but he says it must have been a mile
in length and with a varying width of
from 100 to 200 yards.
Fletcher's cabin is situated about two
miles distant from where he first saw the
birds, and the valley there is about three
quarters of a mile wide and is covered by
a heavy growth of black caks. He arrived
at bis cabin a half hour after the la*t
stragglers had passed and found that tne
birds had taken possession of the grove.
Apparently every twig and limb of the
grove, covering perhaps 100 acres of land,
was a roostine-place for birds, which he
could now readily recognize a* a variety
of pigeons, though plainly not the domes
tic bird. The cooing and love-maicing was
going on at a great rato, and the pigeons
have evidently taken possession of the
grove for a nesting and breeding-plnce.
Fletcher says that the birds were bo
thick that he could without difficulty kill
tny number he wanted with a club or a
Btone. His grove has been visited by
svery one in the neighborhood, who gaze
in wonderment at the novel sight ana who
shoot ana kill pigeons until the sport
ceases to be a novelty. Fletcher brought
about three dozens of the birds to Redding
yesterday, and pÂ»oi>le who pretend to
know something of ornitholoey pronounce
them to be the true wild pigeon that added
to the romance of the early settler of Ken
tucky, Ohio and Indiana.
An accurate descriDtion gives them a
iengthof not quite twelve inches from die
tip of the bill io the end of the tail. The
prevailing color is a bluish gray, in some
parts with green and purple "refactions
and with two broad and distinct bars of
black across the colored winss. The lower
part of the back is white, while the tail is
a deep gray, with a broad, black bar Â«t the
end. The bill is blackish brown and the
legs and toes are of reddish orange. There
is great uniformity, in both size and
color, of the birds brought to Redding.
Where they came from, how long they
will stay in Fletcher's grove and whither
ti ey will go are all matters of pure con
jecture. Certain It fs that this is probsbly
the first instance Â«n the Pacific Coast of
the coming of one of the enormous flocks
of wild pigeons our grandfathers saw in
tlie "West.
REJECTED BY A PORTLAND BELLE.
Clatsop Cduniy Swam Attempts to Insti
tute a Breach of Promise Suit
for $50,000.
PORTLAND. Or. April S.-On Satur
day afternoon a youna. man giving his
name as Peter S. Olney ana his place of
residence in Clatsop County called on
Deputy District Attorney Fitzgerald with
the request that he institute a breach of
promise suit against a ycrung woman,
a member of one of the wealthiest fam
ilies here, whom tue losb of thai sum
would not greatly embarrass were they
absolutely compelled to surrender it.
Olney iÂ« about 28 years eld. without oc
cupation, but expecting to go to Rossland,
B. C, as soon as i.is blasted matrimonial
l^rospects are set arieht in some shape.
He aileges that he "prefers to marry the
girl who has promised to be his wife and
remain penniless rathe" than take all the
wealth ber family possesses and lose her.
lie first met his ex- fiancee at Clatsop last
summer, ana it was a case of "love at
jijrht."
Her mother and others of the family
then also at Clatsop raised no objections
at that t:me to the'attention* he paid the
young lady. He came to Portland last
Thursday, but nis fiancee declined to see
or communicate with him without permis
sion of her family, which he was unable to
obtain.
Olney added that his betrothed was 24
years old and that she was of a lawfm age
when she could choose a husband without
consulting anybody. He farther stated
that he did not require assistance of any
kind from tne young lady's family, as he
had means and ability enough of "his own
to comfortably sunuort a wife. Olney has
a stack of Rushing. love tetters from his
seaside sweetheart, which, however, he
declines to exhibit unless they are neces
sary to strengthen his can^e in court.
Fitzgerald declined to act in the mat
terâhrst, because he is not engaged ib
me private practice ot law at present;
Â«econd, because he did not believe that
Olney had good ground for action ; and,
jurther, because of his aversion to bring
ing a respectable family into notoriety
where the public good is not involved.
Olney will, however, find no difficulty in
engaging ottoer legal assistance to create
a sensation in local swelldom.

VICTORY FOR WaSHOE SETTLERS.
Will Reta,n Land Innccenth Purchased of
an Indian Who Obtained
Title by Fraud.
CARSON, New, April 6.â ln the United
States District Court to-day wbat is
known as the Muzzer case was disposed of
by Judge Hawlej'.
The case is of considerable importance,
as it entail* a decision important to many
Washoo Valley settlers. The decision
embodies five distinct cases with nineteen
defendants.
In 1804, when tne Sioux reservation was
soid according to an act of Congress, the
Indians were reimbursed in scrip.
Charles Muzzer was entitled to a certifi
cate for 480 acres.
Muzzer, before receiving the certificate,
disappeared, and years later an Indian
purporting to be Muzzer appeared before
a commissioner and demanded bis claim.
Upon advancing what was believed to
be adequate identification his demands
were complied with, and hÂ« took up land
in Washoe County, which he afterward
sold for a large consideration to immi-
I grants.
A short time ago the genuine Charles
Miszzer applied at Washington for his
j rights ana proved the fraudulent transac
tion of past years.
The Government immediately began
suit against the Wasuoe seitlers to compel
ihem to vacate the laud, of which they
were innocent purchasers and wbich they
{ ba-1 improved to the extent of thousands
lof dollars. The case was to-day decided
! iv their favor.

still breathing nnd may recover. Tne
three others were dead.

The Fhenomenally Busy Scene at the Palace Hotel Yesterday.
This is the height of the tourist season, and throngs of visitors from different parts of the
East are arriving here every week. Nearly every day sees tourists reach here, and the attaches
of the hotels, especially those of the Palace, to which most of the Raymond and Whitcomb
tourists are ticketed, have all they can do to attend to them. The United Carriage company
has for some time past, owing to the extra demands because of increased travel, had some
difficulty in supplying the needed carriages.
The tourist season, which opened earlier this winter than usual, ana which has now
reached such a point that it has not been equaled for three years, will last for probably a
month more.
Yesterday for several hours there was a crush and jam at the Palace that made the drive
way and office look like a section out of the neart of Market street, so many people here there
to look after. At Bin the morning a special party of Eastern people known as the Pennsyl
vania excursion, which has been here for several days, got their traps together and started
eastward. The Golden Gate excursion and a large number of Raymonds yet remained.
At 2 in the afternoon another party of Raymond and Whitcomb tourists, who required four
pages of the register for their names, reached the hotel. Carriages had been busy with the
other tourists, and when these rolled into the hotel about all the available vehicleshad Deen
brought into service. There whs an exceedingly busy scene about the big caravansary while
the guests were being assigned to rooms and their baggage was being looked after.
"This is by far the heaviest travel we have had for the last two years," said Assistant Man
ager Warren; "in fact, it is heavier than it has beeu since the Midwinter Fair. It is now the
height of the season lor travel. It will last for about a month yet "
"The people are from Massachusetts. New Hampshire. Vermont and Pennsylvania," said
Chief Clerk Cummings. "Most of them come from Boston. That is where Raymond and
Whitcomb have their headquarters, and that is where the travel starts. There are some
coming from New York, pnt not so many as from the other places."
The tourists began coming from Southern California about six weeks ago. They have been
flown there seeing the sights and are now, like birds of passage, working their way north.

shed. The affidavits alleze that the money
bad been placed in the shea by some per
son other than Craemer, and that the
chief's testimony that he discovered the
money in a mitre- box was ialse. This
box, they assert, occupied a most con
spicuous place in the building. The piece
of wood found behind the shed and iden
tified as a piece of Craemer's hammer
handle was, the affidavits assert, placed
there after the arrest and could not possi
bly have been sawed off by Creamer. Fur
ther on in the affidavits the allegation is
made that the handle was sawed and
placed behind the woodsued by I Lowers
after the arrest. Kogers is also charged
with havine made away with certain evi
dence favorable to the accused.
â¢ There are "likewise several affid'avirs 1
showing that "Jack" Quincy, wuo e ihe
police asserted was a myth, was (as con
tended by the condemned man) with
Craemer in Tacoma on the day of the
murder. By hotel registers it is shown
tbat subsequent to the murder
Quincy stopped in Victoria and Monte
Christo and that some years prior to the
crime he lived in Los Angele-.
The case has attracted widespread at
tention and many Germans in San Fran
cisco and other cities throughont the
United States contributed money at the
solicitation of O. P. Wagner to the end
that a new trial might be obtained.
Aside from the affidavits the motion it
a novel one, being a revival of the old
writ of coraru nobis. The questions upon
which the granting of the writ may turn
are whetuer or not it is the common law
in the absence of the statute in this State,
and whether or not the statute has ab
rogated or supplemented this proceeding.
The bearing is set for Monday next.

But This Time in Connec

Relay Race.
OLYMPIC RIDERS ALLEGE
TRICKERY.
They Charge the Bay City M^n
With Using Face-
Makers.
KbNNA'S FINISH ALSO QUES
TIONED.
\
A Formal Protest Filed With tbe
Racing Beard and an Investiga
t on Demanded.
Dreamy ppace and joyous harmony are
not destined to be tiie coief elements of
the aftermath of Sunday's great century
relay, after all.
When Kenna, the Bay City Wheelmen's
star, sbot over the tape in Aiameda full
two minutes in advance of Win.*, the
Olympic Club flyer, the popular opinion
was that the absence of the customary
"close finish" would leave no room for
subsequent doubt as to the winner.
But now that the race is over rumblings
of discontent are beard emanating from
the big red-and-yellow building on Post
Btreei.
In short en obstacle confronts the Bay
City victory in the shape of a formal pro
test filed with Mr. Adams of the racing
board. In this document the Olympic
Club Wheelmen charge teat the Bay City
riders did not win the big race on their
merits.that the Bay City Wheelmen as an
organization resorted to trickery and un
sportsmanlike conduct in order to encom
pass the victory, and in consequence that
the cup should be held in abeyance and
not awarded until it is fairly won.
In accordance with the rules eoverning
amateur oicycie racing this protest will
have to be given serious consideration.
The O'ympic Club complainants will be
asked to prove their assertions, and. on
the oilier hand, the Bay City boys will be
accorded the privilege of presenting a
defence. In detail, the indictment by the
Olympic Club la that the Bay City Wheel
men totally ignored the rules of the relay
regarding the pacing of the riders.
Sunday's event was to be, they say, es
.-entiaily an unpaced and purely amateur
race. The ruies granted tliat each club
participating in the race should be al
lowed to send out behind each rider wear
ing its colors onÂ« "trailer," but that this
individual should at no time pass in front
of the relay-rider for the purpose of pac
ing him.
Now the Olympic Club beys claim that
the Bay Cities paid no attention to this
restriction â In fact that they violated it
in nearly every relay by sending out
dozens of pace-makers. To make it
Btrongerthey declare that in the ninth and
tenth relays the victorious club operated
over fifty riders. It was an easy matter,
they say, for many of these extra forces to
zij-zai; over the course and annoy and in
terfere with the riders who represented
rival clubs.
They will not put themselves on record
just now that this sort ot interference was
resorted to, explaining that they nave not
all of their evidence at hand.
This is not all.
T;.e complnining Olympians call atten
tion to Kenna's finish, which was
watched by thousands of dilated eyes.
Everybody, they declare, will remember
that four riders snrrouuded the doughty
Bay City athlete when he dashed over
the line. He should have bien accom
panied by but one man, his official trailer.
The others, tb* Olympic men say, de
liberately whirled into Konna's wake in
order to '"pocket" nim, so to speak, and
Urns prevent any rival racer from passing
him on the way to the tape. True, there
was no competitor near enougu to Kenna
to give liim any alarm, but the authors of
the protest say that is not the pomt â it i
tlie principlo of the thing that they are
talking about.
"We don't want to pose as soreheads or
as beintr envious of ihp victors," said
George H. Stratton of the Olympic Wneel
men last night. "We don't want the cup.
What we are after is a square deal, and if
there is any way of getting it we propose
to have it.
"Nov. 1 was at Mountain Vlpw Sunday
to see that oar representative, Tantau, got
off all right on the fifth relay. In obedi
ence to the rules, we seDt one trailer out
behind our man. .But what did the Bay
City people do? Why, they had six or
NWn men there, and eve*ry one of ihem
took care to bring along a wheel exactly
the size of that ridden by their relay
rider."
Lew Hunter, ex-chairman of the racing
board aud an enthusiastic Olympic cycler,
was another who was giving vent to his
feelings last night at the Pout-street head
quarters.
Jaclr McGlynn, also of the Olympics,
cays that a special complaint will be
lodged with the racing board in regard
to the conduct of Vincent, who was the
trailer for Krafts, the Bay City rider on
the ninth relay. Vincent, he says,
deliberately paced the "Flying Dutch
man" for several miles. Dans, the trailer
for Kroeiz, who carried the Olympic colors
in this relay, took Vincent to task for his
acion, and the pair came to blows.
Meanwhile the Bay City lads are still
celebrating their victory and singing
nongs, the trend of which is the discomfit
lire of their defeated rivals.
Little or no nttpntion is paid to the
Olympic protest. As a matter of fact, few
of the boys have had time to hear that a
*'k:ct" is on.
CUBA'S FRIENDS ACTIVE.
The New Method of Aiding
Them Is to Sell Bonds at
Half Their Faca.
Names to the Petition for Freedom
Ara Coming In From All P rts
of tbe State.
In spite of the demands of business at
Jiome the chief and master spirits of the
local Cuban League are planning vigor
ously to aid tbe little country in its
struggle for fr?edorn.
The latest development in the local
situation is a movement to sell Cuban
bonds here for tbe aid of the cause of the
oppressed.
"We received ,a letter from Colonel
Ethan Allen of New York to-day," said
President Jones, "and be asks that we co
operate with William O. McDowell of
New York in the sale of Cuban bonds lor
the aid of tbe cause, lie says tbe more
bonds ibat are sold tbe more he will re
joice and be guarantees that McDowell is
a irenuine agent of the Government."
Tbe following is the full text of Mc-
Dowell's letter on tbe bond question:
New York, March 30, 1897.
John IT. Jones, Eta., 9006 Maton Street,
San Francisco, Cal.âMY Dear Sir: Your
nuine has been given mv as thai of an earnest
American, h lover of liberty and a friend of
Cuban independence who would be likely to
purchase one or more Cuban bonds. Tnese
bonds are issued under the authority of the
Constitutional Assembly of the Cuban Repub
lic, amd are In denominations of #1000, $500,
$100 and $50. They are ten-years U-per-eeiu
gold bond:*, interest payable April and Octo
ber, with provision that payment can be de
ferred until six months after the evacuation
ol Cuba by the Spanish forces.
We are selling thvse bonds at the present
times at 50 cents on the dollar, and with the
success ot the republic, which seems near at
hand, they should be not only a good invest
ment but a great speculatiou.
See inclosed letter from Colonel Ethan
Allen, which please remait to me after read
inp. I would appreciate it if, with your an
swer, you would give me the names and sd
dresses of other persons who you think might
be possible customers for the bonds. Very
truly yours, W. Â°- McDowklu
A great many signatures to the petition
for Cuba's cause are coniine in daily from

Smiley Tell* His Friend to Beware of
a Certain 'Mild kate. "
"Do you see that old 6kate over there?"
asked yuung Smiley of his friend
Sprighly.
"Yes," replied Sprighly, wondering at
the disrespect. "That's Miss Blighly's
father. What's the matter with him?"
"Just look out for him, that's all," an
swered Smiley.
"But what has be done?' 1 demanded
Sprighly.
"Why, tha old skate came it over me in
great shape," Smiley declared. "I was
always kind of gone on his daughter, you
know. Well, I thought I would work him
a little and get his consent :o ask her to
marry. One day Ifi shed a roll of bills
before him and he struck me for a 'tenner.'
I gave up like a little man. Later he
asked me for ten asain, and again, and
again, and he kept on withoutever paying
back. Now it was ten and again it v-'as
twenty. He k-pt it up until it reached
the jolly total of $200 or so. Then I
thought it was about time to get in my
bid for the girl."
"Did you ask him?" put in Spriehly.
"Yes, I did," responded Smiley, "and he
threw me down."
"How did he do it?" asked Sprighly.
"Why, be asked me what may salary
and prospects were. 1 told him. He hem
med and hawed a minute, and then said
that my prospects were good, but that ray
salary wasn't enough. 'And people can't
live on prospects, you Know,' he said,
looking kind of grand, as if that wasn't
what be was doing."
"Well, did you ask him for the two hun
dred?" asked Sprightly.
"Yes," responded Smiley, "I mentioned
it delicately, and that was where he threw
me. He didn't have any money then, he
said, but he hoped to have some in the
spring. Then he would pay me. I sup
pose that's what he calls my good pros
pects. He knew what I was lending him
money for all the time, blame him, and be
worked me for about all I had in the bank.
That's why I'm telling you to look out for

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APKIL 6, 1897.
BUCKWA A FAST
RUNNING "HOSS"
The Pacific- Union Selling
Stake a Walk for
Him.
The Roman Beat the Weakly
Ridden Damien Out ior
the Place.
Elsie Smith an Easy WinnerâHer
moso Final. y Scored Again â Pres
ton in Good Form.
The California Jockey Club was favored
with beautiful weather lor tbe opening
day of iti semi-monthly meeting at
Emeryville track, and as tbe card was
v. ay and above tbe average, tbe attend
ance was lartre. No doubt tbe tact that
tbe Pacific Union selling stake, at one
mile and a furlong, worth $1100 to the
winner, was to be decided was the mag
net which attracted many. T c race was
a disappointment. There were but four
starters, and Buckwa, carrying 109
pounds, went to the post an 11 to 20 favor
ite, backed down from 7to 10. The son of
Buckra was in rare fettle, and aÂ°ter trip
ping off iha first mile in l:4o>Â£, be won
eased up from The Roman in 1:54%.
Damien, the second choice, was an indif
ferent third.
Tbe track was fast and favorites more
than beld their own, taking four of tbe
seven events run.
The win of Devault at odds of 15 to 1
was one of the biggest surprises of the
afternoon.
Elsie Smith, the 4to 5 favorite for the
pening five and a half furlong scramble,
defeated her field with ease, winning
eased up from Grandezia after making all
of the running. Cavallo was a good third.
Burns & Waterbouse also furnished a
hot favorite in the mils selling affair that
tollowed in Osric 11, which ruled a 7 to 10
choice. He was outspdnted the last quar
ter by Don Clarencio, the 4 to 1 second
choice, v. hirb won handily by over three
lengths in 1:42^. Charlemagne, asoto 1
chance backed down to 20, was third.
The fast Sir Modred colt Heimoso dually
landed another rsce. With Mike Hen
nessy up he was a 7 to 5 choice over bis
fieid, and won with ii t tie to Â»t>are, a
length in adyar.ee of Michael, against
which 7to 1 was laid. Bliss Ruckor, a son
of Salvator, was a fast coming third.
Of the eleven starters in the fifth event
over one mile and a sixteenth, decided
under selling conditions, Una Colorado
beemed the pick of the talent and issued
from the paddock a 2 to 1 choice. He led
the bunch into the stretch, and was then
outfooted by Devault, a 15 to 1 shot, rid
den by J. Shields. The aÂ»t jump or two
the favorite was led out for the place by
Del Paso, a 100 to 1 atiot.
The field in the seven-furlong purse run
was reduced by scratching to six. Pres
ton was always a favorite, and after being
cut off at ttie start won handily from
Torsina, which mare, at odds of 12 to 1,
cutout the t ace ana, although tiring at
the end, downed Wheel of Fortune for
tbe place.
The final event of the day, a five and a
half furlong spin, reculted in a dead heat
between Lost Girl, a 15 to 1 shot, and Dun
boy, which with Scotch Rose ruled a fa
vorite. The purse was divided. After
maklne the running Scotch Rose tired the
last sixteenth, finishing third.
NOTES.
Tod Sloan, disappointed that the
Legislature ordered no buildings or
streets named after him, followed in the
wake of his acattered army of followers
and departed for tbe East last evening,
and with him also went brother Cash*.
Tod showed himself no wonder and bis
absence will hardly be felt. Racing will
progress just the same.
The California Jockey Clnb is making
an effort to bring tbe starters in the
Derby together again. It will add $1000
for another race to be decided on Wednes
day of the coming week, the owner of
each entry to deposit $50; tbe entrance
money to go to the second horse.
Advices receired from Chicago state that
the Wisconsin racing bill will come up for
final passage on Thursday. For the sate
ol honest sport it is to be hoped Ideal
Park will become a thine of tbe p ist.
Tommy Griffin and his string of horses
will depart for tbe East on Wednesday.
In ttie same car Mr. Benson will bend
honest old David.
While at the post in the opening race,
Receive, along-priced outsider, was kicked
in tbe snonlder and badly cut by one of
the other starters. He wai allowed to be
drawn.
Nineteen bookmakers did a lively busi
ness in the ring.
Gene Leigh left for Kentucky last even
inc to look after his summer string.
Don Clarencio was bid up $200 over his
entered selling price.
W. H. Moloney. who spends his winters
on the California tracks, together with his
three sons, departs for New York to-day.
Mr. Moloney takes with him about $2200,
earned in well-placed bets.
Some time ago the InglÂ«side Association
advertised to receive bids for privileges to
be let for the fall meeting of 1897. In
furnishing the list it is just probable that
the directors omitted ihÂ« cigar-stand priv
ilege. Are certain plums reserved forcer
tain ones on this qow queeriy conducted
There have been many inquiries of late
as to why Joe Pigeon is not seen in * the
saddle any more. It appears Joe is a
victim of circumstances, (Some time ago,
the local boy. signed a contract to ride lor
Edward Corri?an, and straightway he got
in trouble. Soon after donning the green
with white sash, colors of the master of
Hawthorne, Joe was given the mount on
Satyr. . . ' : r -.~ : '.,. -'. â  Â â 
The stable orders were "if he could not
win not to punish the horse to finish
within the ' money. V,; â¢ Piggott managed to
get away poorly from the post, but after
going half the distance moved up, and at
the end was beaten but a neck &nd a Dead
by Tulare and Treachery in the. order
naaMtt. It was an error of judgment, and
looks as though Mr. Corn can was work
ing a hardship in keeping the lad on the
ground. â¢

PEESIDENT M'OALL 18 HEBE.
He Came With President Blpley and
Will Stay a Week.
John A. McCail, president of the New-
York Life Insurance Company, arrived
hers yesterday and is at the Palace. He
and his friends came with President
llipley of the Santa Fe to Southern Cali
fornia, and Mr. McCali came leisurely to
San Francisco from there. He will be
here a week or two. Rumor has it that
Mr. McCail will before taking his depart
ure try to get a site for a tnll building to
be erected by the New York Life. Tne
Blythe block has Deen talked of in con
nection with the rumored purchase, but if
it was ever serlou.-ly considered it is ap
parently out of itio question, in view of
the recent decision ot the United States
Supreme Court. By this decision the
estate is yet in an unsettled condition.
Mr. McCali met several friends and at
tended the theater last n pin. Ac> remit
tee of prominent insurant c men met him
at Meuio in the morning and accompanied
him to the City.
Stole a Bicycle.
Georgre Mason, 20 yenrs of aj:e, hired a
bicycle yesterday from C. M. Christoff -jr, 419
Stanyan street. He di<i not return with It and
the police were notified. Dvtccttves Dillon
and Crockett found that Manon had take') the
bicycle to 11. Kiorski and sold it for $12. It
was valued ut $75. lie was to relun last
night to got the money, and when he male
his appearance the detectives arresed him.
He was booked for grand larceny and on an
other charge of carrying a concealed weapon,
as a revolver was found in his pocket.
SUPERB WORK IN
WILLIAM TELL
Alb9rs Plays the Title
Role in Rossini's
Opera.
"A Soldier of Fortune" Fails
to Take the Baldwin by
Storm.
Tel and in Costume Is the A !â¢ Absorb
ing Topic of interest at the
A cazar Theater.
There was not a large bouse to welcome
"William Tell" at the California Theater
last night, but the audience made up in
enthusiasm what it lacked in numbers.
Since the opening of the reason no such
ovations have been bestowed upon any of
the artists as Albers and Prevost received.
It is tbe fashion among disciples of the
Wagner cult to decry Rossini and all his
works, "William Tell" among them, but
last night's enthusiasm showed that there
is a good deal of vitality left in the old
opera yet.
The overture has been hackneyed,
played by third-rate bands, and even
mutilated by amateurs in a way that
would render hateful less pleasing
music, but the n pera is seldom performed
by any but good companies, for it requires
a heroic barytone, and Arnold is one of
the highest and most difficult robust tenor
roles in the whole Italian repertoire.
The overture last night was very wisely
played between the first and second acts,
which gave every one a chance of bearing
it. It was rendered with a great deal of
olor, verve and precision and brought
Mr. Nicosias, the chef d'orchestre, a pro
longed oration.
"William Tell" is one of tbe few operas
in which more vocal plums fall to tbe bary
tone than to the tenor. The barytone is the
title ro c and the heaviest share of the
acting falls on his shoulders. In revenue
for this Arnold, the tenor, has a chance of
takings hi,h l) and has Cs and Bs palore,
with which he can delight lovers of h.^h
note*.
I lie plot of the opera is based on Schil
ler's "William Tell" and most of the inci
dents popularly ascribed to the Swiss hero,
iuclu ling snooting she apple off h:s son's
heed, a: to reproduced on the stage.
Masmnceut work was done by Harm
Albers in the title role and by Prevo-t,
who sang Arnold. In the great duet of
the first am, when Tell tries to inflame
his young compatriot against the Austrian
tyrant, honors were about equally divided.
The singing by both artist- was macnin
cenlly dramatic in this scene. Albers
maintained an even standard of excellence
all through tue opera, winning and de
serving deep "bravos," both for the oatn
scene and the scene where Tell shoots the
historic apple from Jemmy's bead.
Prevosi's voice showed signs or fatigue
in the duct with Matilde, and he took two
of his skyrocket notes falsetto, but that
was bis only weakness. In* the succeed
ing scene, where Amu d swears 'vita the
two other patriots to overthrow the
Austrian tyrant, Prcvoat was superb, both
vocally and dramatically.
The rest of the cast was for the most
part excellent. Mme. Bertnet made a
charming Matilde. Javid was good as the
tyrant Gessler. Aches did excellent work
as the patriot Walter, and Cuateau was a
clever Leutbold. The orchestra was ex*
cellent, bat the choruses were weak.
On Saturday Mile, Aimee Pa-cal will
sing in one number of the long bill.
At the Baldwin.
Otis Skinner opened his second week at the
Baldwin last evening in his own play, "A Sol
dier of Fortune."
"A Soldier ol Fortune" is a penny dreadful
in a romantic dress. It seems as if Skinner
had taken all the characters identified with
tbe dramas of the pait and endeared by long
association to the habitual theater-goer and.
shaking them together with uncertain touch
and unskillful hand, produced his Torelli,
soldier of fortune.
To place the action of his drama in the six
teenth century is the only concession the
actor-playwright has made to the prevailing
taste oi the day.
The occupation of Italy by the French army
under Louis XII, and the ceaseless skirmishes
between the forces of the Borgia and the
equally feared and hated Macchiaveili, give a
slim political interest to the play.
The author has kept himself constantly in
evidence. He continually holds the center of
the stage. He is ready with his sword and
prepared to t'.eh'. at shortest notice, either for
his friend, his foe or his breakfast. Skinner
has given too much evidence of tact, savoir
faire and more than the usually allotted in
telligence to keep "The Soldier" in his repÂ«r
toue.
Charming Maud Durbin is given but scanty
opportunities in the play. In the third act
she makes a pretty picture in her doublet and
hose and compels attention by her womanly
1 aitractivenes-.
As for the o. nor characters they receive no
mote attention than they merit.
Miii-ciufiv â¢ Ii and Borgia are but sorry con
splr.itors. The dreaded Lucreiia at times re
calls memoiiesof the many Lady Gay Spankers
it has been the misfortune ol a scoffing public
to see, and the Cardinal in his make-up out
mothers Mother Goose.
On Thursday night Skinner is to produce
"Ham let" agalD, for which the public is clam
oring, and at Saturday matinee "Borneo and
Juliet" will be the bill.
At the Columbia.
"For Fair Virginia," that pretty fireside
story of tbe late unpleasantness, continues to
please the patrons of the Powell-street house.
The dainty love scenes, as well as the more
Intense sltuntions, are of a character that bear
a r.-peated visit to the theater. This drama
of the South will continue until Monday next,
when ii i.rsria Cay van will make her initial
appvarar.ee as a star in thi< Ci-y in a play
.'Kill to be particularly 6Uited to her, "Squire
Kate."
"Squire Kate" is from the pen of Buchanan,
and was one of Miss Cayvan's most marked
successes during that lady's connection with
the Lyceum Theater in New York. Seats lor
Miss cayvan's engagement will be on sale be
ginning Thursday.
At the A.cazar.
When the curtain rolled up on "Wild Oats"
at tne Alcazar last nights the patrons of that
cozy little theater wore an expectant air re
garding Hugo Toland's tights. It was not
till the third act, when Mr. Toland strolled on
"a la Beiu Brummel." that the audience rea
lized that whatever reasons Mr. Toland may
have had for objecting to don the dlrectoire
costume tbe fear 01 "cutting an awful figure"
was not one of them.
One of the nits of the performance was made
by Gordon Foster, whose clever Impersonation
of a good-humored but emphatically "coun
try" boy won h laugb on every line. Francis
Powers looted dec dedly handsome, and did
his customary good work as Kover, the
i. rolling gentlemanly player. Georxe O-
bourrse played Ephralm Smooth, a very qua
kery Quaker in his usual finished manner.
The rest of the cast do their usual good work.
Grand Opera-House.
The "Stowaway" at Morosco'n is a thrilling
story of low life in London, with toughs,
trampa, thieve*, drunkards and a dingy gin
palace. The plot is of a lost heir who has be
come degraded when he is found by his father's
old servant.
The principal scene is the cracking of a real
safe with real tools and finished off with dyna
mite.
Miss Thompson, the new sonbrette. give a
' clever rendering of a newsboy, up in the latest
Kiting and ready for all comers. The whole
cast was good.
Tlvoll Opera- House.
The second week of "Don Juan" opened to a
good house last night. One of the b.-st fea.
tures of the burlesque is Its clever ballets.
The mermaid's dance in lhe third act is *pe
cially praiseworthy. Miss Seabrooke'a "Elsie
From Chelsea" seems to have caught on im
mensely. West's song, â¢â¢Hugh McOue. You
Mick, You," calls forth laugh after laugh.
At the Orpheum.
Two new "acu" opened at the Orpheum lust
night. The new faces, Mile. Titenin. the als
scriptlve dancer, and Dslmore and Lee, were
well received. The bills offered at this house
lately have not been at all up to the standard.
One or two good numbers during the evening
will not carry a performnnce through to the
entire satisfaction of the iiidience.
The Chutes did a large business en Sunday.
It is getting to be quite the thin? to visit this
popular resort, with its Ion? list of attrac
tions. The animatoscope pleases hundreds
and the outdoor show is a success.

King George may not be relying on his

A flutter of the carnival excitement is

As the French Government is said to
have a "mysterious pla-i" for settling the
Cuban crisi3 it may be said truly that the
plot thickens.
T*he Missouri River is rising to swell the

California, it seems, is to play a lone

It is said the recent frosts resulted in

Tbe Examiner suggests that the "Porte"

It is well to rejoice in new boulevards

Victoria will Keep the peace of Europe

The capture of Rivera has intensified
American sympathy with Cuba without
in any way weakening the courage of the

The trade revival goes slowly, but
nevertheless it moves steadily. There is
not much difference between one week
and another, but compared with last year
at this season trade is now better in every
way.
Senator Hoar says the Senate represents
the sober second thought of the American
people, but all the same they do not seem
pober when they talk, and their second
thoughts are very slow in coming some
times.
It was hardly necessary for Gladstone
to explain that he wrote his famous letter
not more to save Greece from wrong than
to save England from dishonor. That
was the way in which the world under
stood it.
The importers are rushing things. A
single steamer from Germany, which ar
rived at New York on Sunday, brought
13.200 tons of cargo including 60,000 bags
of sugar. The new tariff cannot be eu
ac'.ed too soon.
McKinley's plan of appointing a com
mission to consider the currency problem
Â»nd make a report to Congress grows iv
favor with the country and it ii to be
hoped the commission will be appointed
in time to submit a plan before the next
elections, so that the people can have a
vote on it.
An Eastern syndicate has purchased a
large tract of land in Nebraska for the
purpose of establishing a sugar-beet in
dustry, and notice is therefore given to
California that if she wishes to secure her
snare of the sugar production of the coun
try she must begin work at once. We can
produce all the sugar needed in the United
(States, but the East is not .going to Bit
down and wait for us to do it.
The report that the ereat operatic com
bine of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau is in
debt and unabie to meet its obligations
will raise again the question why operatic
stars should be paid larger salaries than
they can earn. Every other class of work
ers in the world are satisfied with the
profits of their industry, but the star
singer demands not only the receipts of
the liouj c but a bonus besides.
The President has hardly been an well
advised in selecting a Minister to Japan
as in making other foreign appointments.
The choice of a man from Georgia for that
position instead of a resident of tlie Pacific
~oaÂ«t looks like a mistake. A Califorman
would have been thoroughly posted on
many matters connected with our com
merce with Japan which the man chosen
will have to learn after he reaches his
post, and it wiil go well with us if some
costly mistakes are not' made in the
learning.
FUSH THE WORK.
The issue which appeals most to the public spirit of the people of San Francisco
at this time is the work of constructing the Balboa boulevard. Other issues are in
the future. This is present. Others may be for a time postponed. This cannot
be delayed now without throwing many men out of employment and without losing
much of what has been already gained in the work.
It is imperative that the money needed for completing the work should be speedily
forthcoming. The sum required is not large. If every well-to-do citizen would
contribute something no one would have to give much. There has been great liberal
ity displayed in raising money lor the work so far, and the example thus set should
be followed by all who can afford it.
This work is doubly important to the City. In the first place, it provides the only
employment possible for a large uumber of industrious men. Without the wages
wh ich they are earning on the road, their families would be destitute and in many
cases dependent on charity. It is nothing more than a duty of common humanity
that those who have means should contribute a little to provide employment for their
less fortunate fellow-men, who are willing to give good work for small wage.
In this ca*e, moreover, the employment given is one which will prove of vast
benefit io the whole community. The opening of the Balboa road means something
more than a pleasure-drive ior the rich. It will afford enjoyment to thousands, open
up for settlement a large tract of land which will materially advance the growth of
the City and, furthermore, will prepare the way for the eventual construction of a
grand boulevard around the southern end of the bay, which will be one of the most
noted driveways in the world, and a new attraction to bring people of wealth and
means to make their homes along its splendid roadway.
It should require no reiterated appeals to the people to raise the money now
needed to complete the work. Every citizen should take the matter into consideration
for himself and see what he can do to aid it. Every contribution, however small,
will help. Let each man therefore give in proportion to hi 9 means. Let us roll up
the fund rapldiy, and see if we cannot provide before the week closes a sufficient sum
to continue the employment of labor and assure the speedy completion of the work.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
The action of Senator Elkins in press
tac upon Congress an immediate consid
eration of a bill providing for the ad
vancement of our merchant marine is an
other evidence of the earnestness with
which the Republican leaders have set
about the task of fulfilling all the prom
ises and pledges made to the people in
the St. Louis platform. While it is true
public interests require that the tariff bill
should be enacted belore any other legis
lation is attempted, it is nevertheless de
sirable that preliminary steps for the
protection of American shipping should
be taken at once, and therefore the Elkins
bill is decidedly opportune and timely.
The St. Louis platform in dealing with
the subject of our merchant marine de
clares: "We favor restoring the early
American policy of discriminating duties
for the upbuilding of our merchant marine
and the protection o f our shipping in '.he
foreign carrying trade, so that American
shipsâ the product of American laoor em
ployed in American shipyards, sailing

merce."
The b 11 advocated by Senator Elkins is
in accordance with the princ.ple declared
in the National platform. It provides for
a 10 r>er cent tax o:i all goods broupht to
the United States in foreign ships. This,
it. will be seen, will give an advantage to
merchants whose goods are shipped in
American vessel*, and will have, there
fore a tendency to increase the profits of
our ship-owners and materially advance
all the industries engaged in our merchant
marine.
The bill will meet with no little opposi
| tion. It has already been argued that dis
j criminating duties imposed by our Gov
-1 ernment will lead other nations to retali
i ate by similar dutie;. Such arguments
I might be with equal force urged against
I the whole protective system. It will be
' remembered that in the early days of the
1 Republic we practiced a policy exactly
i similar to that now advocated, and it re
i suited in such a development of American
) ship-building t: at our flag was seen on
I every sea and the greater portion of our
foreign trade was carried on in American
vessels. What was done once can be done
again. Certainly it is time that some ef
fort Bhould be made to build up our mer
chant marine, and the bill of Senator
Elkins will be hailed as an important step
in that direction.
THE GLORY OP GREECE.
Whatever may be the cutcome of the
Cretan crisis there can be no question
about the effect which the action of
Greece will have upon its eventual solu
tion. King George, by his courage, has
taken the problem out of the domain of
diplomatic intrigues and made it a part of
that broad politics in which the people
play a part and have a potent voice in
determining the result. Public opinion
hns now i.een aroused on t c subject and
the issue will never be settled until it is
settled in accordance with ttie judgment
of liberal and enlightened men.
In speaking of this phase of the situ
ation, Mr. Gladstone, in his recent letter
to the Duke of Westminster, said: "It re
mains to be recognized that at the present
juncture Greece, whom some seem dis
posed to treat as a criminal and disturber,
has by her bold action conferred a great
servic- upon Europe. She has made it
impossible to palter with this question as
we paltered with the blood-stained ques
tion of Armenia. Sue nas extricated it
from the mesiies of diplomacy and placed
it on the order of the day for definitive
solution. I can remember no case in
which so small a state has conferred so
great a benefit."
These words of Mr. Gladstone in no
wise exaggerate what has been accom
plished by King Georee and the Greek
people. The bold move of sending a
Greek army to occupy Orate was in no
sense rash or inconsiderate. It was in
fact the most diplomatic step that could
have been takÂ«n. It had the effect of tak
ing the appeal trom the court of diplo
macy to the supreme tribunal of public
sentiment. Before that tribunal the
Greeks are now conducting their cast with
as much discretion as courage. They have
not made a sinplt misiake and have only
to hold on in the way tsey have began to
accomplish the annexation oi Crete to the
Greek kingdom and thus prepare the way
for a final solution of tha whole Turkish
problem.
The confusion which prevails in the
councils of the great powers is the best
possible evidence of the wisdom of the
course adopted by the Greeks. All the
alliances formed to maintain the Turkish
empire have proven useless in the face of
the new emergency raised by the courage
and the wisdom of the government at
Athens. At the present time neither of
the great nations knows what course to
pursue. They are at discord one with an
other, and as in the politics of this world
a well-directed and resolute wiil never
fails to dominate a hesitating, doubtful
and irresolute multitude, so will it be seen
in the end that the little nation of Greece,
by the mere fact of having definite convic
tions and the courage to fighi for them,
wiil overcome the obstacles p.lnced in her
way by the great powers and achieve a
victory as glorious as any recorded in her
annais, not even excepting those that are
associated with the field of Marathon and
tne mountain passes of Thermopylae.
Having obtained pussessk-n of Delacos
Bay Victoria is now in a position to ask
President Kruger in firm tones what he
meant by calling her "Â£en kwÂ»je vrouw."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 1897.
[THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE.
The most noticeable article in the cur
rent number of the Forum is one by Sena
tor Hoar dealing with lhe oft-repeated
charges that the Senate does not properly
represent the people, that it obstructs pub
j lie business and that it is inferior to the
i House as a legislative body. To all of
these charges Senator Hoar enters a de
nial and cites evidence to show that they
*re unfounded in every respect.
The saiient feature of the article Is the
contrast made between the method of pro
cedure in the House and that in the Sen
| ate. Obstructive tactics in the House, he
t says, have become so common that it has
j been found necessary to almost entirely
I curtail discussion. Appropriation bi.ls
: are passed as a whole because the majority
; of the House agree with the Speaker that
' '"it is not safe or practicable to trust the
i Representatives of the people to deal with
| the items of expenditure one by one after
! full discussion."
This being the condition of the House,
I it is imperative according to Senator Hoar
that the Senate should allow ample time
for debate on every feature of every bill.
He says fransly:
The promptness with which tne House of
Representatives deals with some important
questions is t> good thing; Dut us capacity for
prompt action ig purchased at the price of
repudiation of public debts and the suppres
sion of the constitutional rights, personal dig
nity and official authority of the sreat mass
o( Its members. Gentlemen occupy seats there
who from the beginning to the end of their
term of service are not permitted to make a
motion or lo utter a word to the assembly of
which they are members. Perhaps wise legis
lation may be secured while one House is con
ducted ou that principle; but I am afraid free
government would not long endure if it were
applied to both Houtes.
The debates in the Senate are said by
the Senator tÂ« be by no means so often
obstructed as is supposed. He defends
the members of that body against the at
tacks made on them by the Eastern mug
wump* and is particularly strong in point
j ing out that the Western members from
the new States are not the ignorant cranks
which the Eastern papers represent them.
The Senate as a whole he claims ia better
than ever before (a our history, and he
cites as a proof of it some of the outrages
committed in the Senate in the old days
when drunkenness was common and the
slave power was supreme.
While holding that the Senate is a bet
ter legislative body than the House and
is better conducted thaa in former days,
Senator Hoar does not regard it as perfect.
He advocates the adoption of rules which
will put a stop to tne obstruction by mi
norities of the wil! of the people and of
majorities without sacrificing the right of
reasonable debate and unlimited amend
' meut. He also declares we must devise
some means for securing the honest elec
! tion of Representatives and Senators.
These reforms he does not de-pair of ac
; complisliing, and he aternly rebukes
i those who "apeak or think of these, the
i best days of the American Republic, as if
; they were the T-orÂ«t."

CHARITIES IN CONFERENCE
A Flan Adopted for the Relief of
the 111 Among the
Poor.
There was another conference yesterday
at the Second Unitarian Church of the
local charitable organizations, irrespec
tive of religious denomination, for the
purpose of further considering plans for
alleviating suffering among the poor.
The conference decided to begin its con
certed work by first looking after the sick.
President Woodward was authorized to
appoint a committee to take charge of this
matter at hiseariieat possible convenience
As ioon as the committee is announced
and is organized it will proceed to em
ploy a trained nurse who will be required
to look into every case of sickness re
ported among the* deserving poor. This
nurÂ«e will respond to calls coming Irora
every oreanization represented in the
conferenceâ some twenty in allâ and the
plan If, in tbe event that one is found to
bi insufficient, to employ more.
After mis matter had been settled by
the conference, Lawyer Bobbins read an
interesting paper on" the best method for
helping the unemployed. Jl s advice
was that every church in the City, no
matter what its denomination, should
immediately establish a poor fund, and
itself atteud to every case of want within
its reach or hearing.

"THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL."
Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current Interest.
The Man in History.
Fditor San Franeifco CaltâSm: If it shall fall to my lot to leÃd a few bright minds yet
unacquainted with John Clark Ridpath, tlie new editor of the Arena, to read what he writes
my reward will be thanks of more worth than gold and gems. They will thereafter want to
keep company with such a mind, for one learns to think on broad lines who reads Ridftjathâ
not merely to think he thinks. And the reach of his thought hounds the theme of which he
treats, while be informs the mind with the facts set in place and in due proportion.
The .Arena for April lies before me, and I have just read Ridpatli's sixteen luminous pages
on "The Man in History." What shall I say of it ? Tbat when you have read it you will know
why he has won tbe first place among the gifted few of all time who have made history take
rank as the surest guide for the race. In the time and space I can tike not much can be said to
show how ho lets the light shine on one of (he dark paths where strong men have lost .their
way. 'Great has been the oixcntioa of thinkers," he says, "a* to the true place of man in
history. By man we do not mean the race or tribe, but the individual human being; by
history we do not mean the puny record of events made by scribe or chronicler, but the events
themselves in their majestic progress across the iandscaps of the wond.
He goes to the heart of the question of historical verity in saying that "there is now no
indisputable historical teaching in the world," and that "there is no instruction In the science
of history which proceeds from a postulate at once undisputed and philosophical, and justly
charges that "out of the most reputable universities in the world cotr.es only an uncertain
sound. One class of thinkers assume that man, the indiTldual. is the creator of the whole
course of events; "these end in the mistsof hero worship. The other class begin with the
assumption that men are nothing, and that general causation Is everything; these end in the
far, cold clouds of historical fatalism." He instances Thomns Carlyle and Henry Thomas
Buckle as striking examples of these two classes of thinkers, and says: "Both were nistorians
of the first rank, and both must be classed among the greatest thinkers of the age. Both were
equally sincere."
The temptation is irresistible here to break into the paragraph and ask the reader to note
the depth and incisiveness of wha follows. "The writings of each are equally exempt from
tnat poisonous ulterior purpose which is the bane of so large a part of the Historical literature
ol our times." As I see things, that â¢'poisonous ulterior purpose" is insiduou ly infecting all
our textbooks, too, in the hieher schools of learning more especially, nnd nronceals a peril to
our country which lew surmise and fewer still comprehend. But. to resume our story: ;'Car
lyle is. pernaps, the greatest example of a hero-worshiper," he fays, "among the hith-up intel
lects of the English-speaking race. Buckle, on the other hand, knows no hero at all, but is
rather the example of that scientific rationalism which has affected, if it has not conquered,
nearly all the historians oi the last half of the present century." But I must not linger.
Taking up the modern view that "man is but the result of Irstorica antecedenceâ the
product of his own age, ' Dr. Ridpath adduces some indisputable iacts. ''Look at the indi
vidual at any time and in any country. Se ect the man from any situation whatsoever, and
see whether he has determined eveu himself, to say nothing of the events of his epoch. Did
he before his coming mark the time of his birth? Did he determine and cnoose his country?
Did he reckon on the conditions of Climate and scene into wnich he should be thrown, and the
consequent limitations of his power? Did he fix his birthplace in river, valley, on mountain
slope, ln populous city, on solitary steppe, in moaning forest, or by the beach of the in
finite sea?"
Again he asks: "Did any man ever choose his race and blood? Did any ever selert hisown
paternityâ his father, his mother, the physical and moral un on of their lives in him? Did any
ever make himself a Hindu, a Persian, a Greek, |a fire-worsi iper, a pHgan, a Christian? Did any
ever prepare beforehand to be a soldier, a poet, a priest? Could any fix himself by preference
and will in Babylon, in Rome, in Peking, in London? â¢ â¢ â¢ Could any be a Hun or a mis
sionary, a Crusader or an infiael, a prince or a boor, a fool or a philosopher, man or woman,
slave or general, black, brown, or white, strong or weak, blind or seeing, dwarf or herculean,
Capable or incapable of action and accomplishment? Has any man in any age or country to
any dezree whatever influenced, not to say determined, the antecedent conditions of his own
life and activities? i( he have not dove so, then how can he be said to be the maker of
history?"
With equal fairness and force Dr. Ridpath stated the opposite viewâ that held by the
Carlyle scnool, and made it* defender cite "the manifest originating power and controlling
band of man over the incidents and events of history," who "goes forward from mateiial
facts aud conditions to abstract and moral considerations, charging the adverse view with
ab.-urd predestinarianism, with materialism, with every species of fatalistic philosophism
Invented by a blind and absolute science," claiming that "such a view is against the evidence
of the prescriptions of the mind and the common testimony of the race," and asking, "Who
but man has reclaimed and peopled and civilized the domains of the world? Did any
city ever found Itself?" or "Did any institution or event rise anywhere but by the up
liiting hands of men? Did not Cecrors iound Athens, and tbe twin robbers draw the
ramparts aroundlprimiiive Rome?" "Did not Mo*es and Solon and Numa make laws for the
Jew, the Greek and the Roman?" "Were Luther and Cromwell only the open and uncon
scious mouths of religious and democratic insurrections?" "Was Richelieu only a puppet,
wired and pulled by late ?"
But I transcend my limits, and yet I have not fairly put the "cause" to the court "On tha
one side :s the man set forth as the author of history ; ou the other is history set forth as the
maker of man. The convention is as far-reaching as the origin of the human race, as strenu
ous as the cords that bind our destinies, and as profound as the seabd of life." I have but
aimed to indicate the treud of thought in this masterly paper by Dr. Ridpath, in order to
induce the reader to get it and enjoy its profound scholarship, so simp:y stated in lucid words,
its vast survey of pivotal events and its transce dent faith in the future. In his view the
gneral hcheme of history tends ever "to the betterment and perfection of the human race."
I want all men and women who have learned to think for themselves to become acquainted
with the work of John Clark Ridpith. Joseph Asbury Johnson.

A NEW LINE OF
GASOLINE BOATS
One of Them Will Piy
Between Here and
Fort Ross.
The Treasure Lost From the
Steamer Sunol Lccated
at Last.
News of the Drowning of R. Vacc â â ,
the Mail Company's Agent, Comes
Up by ths Newport.
Georce W. Call, (he wealthy rancher
and owner of Fort Ross, and Ross <fc
Hewlett, the shipping and produce mer
chants, are about to put in operation a
new line of steam schooners between here
and coast ports. The fir-t one to be
launched wiJl run between here and Fort
Ross, and in her spare moments will run
excursions on the uay. She will probably
be named Tne Call â not the San Fran
cisco Call, but the G. F. Call, after the
popular and courteous owner of Fort
Ros;. The new boat will be 115 feet long
on the keel, 14 feet beam and 5 leet deep.
Her gasoline engines will develop forty
horsepower and will at any stage of the
tide drive her nine kno s an hour. She
has twice the power of the Mary C and
Etla B, both of which vessels are about
the same size.
Fort Ross is considered the paradise of
fishermen aud hunters. The new gasoline
boat will be ready to convey them there
about the first week in June. The new
boat will have accommodation for from
twelve to fifteen cabin passengers and
everything possible will be done for their
comfort. Donald Ross of Ross & Hewlett
said yesterday that the vessel would be
ready in about thirty-five days lor her
'irial trip.
The same company baÂ« another gasoline
schooner under way whose dimensions
will be 74 feet overall. Just where she
will run Mr. Ross refused to state. That
it will be to some of the near-by ports
goes without saying.
A. E. Pryor, general manaeer of the
Piper- Aden-Goodall Company, has at last
located the treasure that went overboard
when the steamer Sunol turned turtle.
For ten days the wrecker Whitelaw worked
on the job and secured on tar of lead and
the steamer's boile.-s. Nothing else could
be located, and the expense being heavy
the wiecker was withdrawn. Then Pryor
and genial "Joe" Aden buckled on their
armor jind entered tne fray. They secured
five boats from t; eir fleet of schooners and
two small tugboats. A!l of them were
fixed up w itli tiracs, and inside of two
hours the treasure was located. The
schooner broke away from her moor
ings, however, and the work had to be
done all over again. All day Sunday t c
wo:k was prosecuted without result, but
yesterday morning the treasure was
located again and buoyed. A diver was
sent down, and after a thorough exami
nation he reported that the iron safe, the
lead bars an i a lot of miscellaneous stuff
was all piled up in a heap just as they
were dropped from the dect of the
steamer.
An attempt will be made to raise the lot
some time to-dHy and Messrs. Aden and
Pryor are confident that nuarly every
thing of value will be recovered. Should
their predictions prove correct it will be
hailed with joy by everybody on the water
front, as tne Piper-Aden-GoodaU Com
paDy is deservedly the most popular in
San Francisco.
E. H. Doiph, the diver who went down
to locate the treasure, proved himself to
be the right man in the right place. "He
proved himself to be faithful and sincere
in all his endeavors," said Mr. Pryor.
â¢'and worked hard in our interests Ironi
the word go. I hope we will never re
quire the services of a diver again, bnt
should we Dolpn will assuredly have the
call."
The Mail Company's steamer Newport
arrived from Panama and way ports yes-
Ulday. She was delayed at some of the
Central American ports and in conse
quence will not be able to get away until
the 10th inst. The cabin passengers were:
Captain E. R. Sewell, W. McDougall, R.
Ibach. J. E. Green. A. T. Lowel, H. N. Kirkland,
Mrs. '1. Qumones, E. Bartholenieu, H. <i. fcmith,

J. W. Winston, Miss 1 subtile O'Connor, T. T.
Anthony, Mrs. M. Newman, John Bradbury
and wife.
Captain Lee H. Sewell, the nephew of
Arthur Sewell, owner of the Kenilworth,
intended to go to Honolulu on that vessel.
A3 it happened tue clipper made a very
smart run to San Francisco anil receiving
quick dispatch got away from here in
ballast on the 31 inst. Had the Newport
been on time Captain Sewell might stiJl
have caught the vesee , but all the cir
cumstances were against him. The gal
lant skiiiper will sail on the Rio -le Janeiro
and join, the Kenilwortii at Honolulu,
where the latter will load sugar for New
York. It wi:i be remembered that the
Keniiwortii is an English-built ship ami
several years ago was burnt t,o the water's
edge at Port Costa during the big fire.
She was then told to the tiighest bidder
and after being repaired was placed under
the American flag.
Since that time she has made many fast
trip?, and me present one may be gauged
by the fact that theDirigo. theonlv Amer
ican-built s'eei ship afloat, which left New
York rive days before the Kenilworth,
ba< not yet reac ed port.
On the arrival of the Newport at Aca
jutia I:. Vance, the agent of the Mail
Company, went out to her. This was on
February 25 last, and he remained aboard
all night. In the morning be sought to
get ashore again, but as it was very rough
in the roadstead he was persuaded to wait
for an hour. At that time tne conditions
were no better, and be insisted upon go
ing ashore in a small native bout. JL
roller capsized the boat and Vance was
thrown heavily against a rock. He wns
badly injured, but the natives got him
ashore. Ever/thing possible was done for
the unfortunate a:ent, but he died. Vance
was very popular with the Pacific Mail
Company's officers, and his Bidden death
v*a< a shock to the crew of tbe Newport.
The British bark Palmyra got in from

HIS AGE EXCEEDED
FIVE SCORE YEARS
David Harris Died a Cen
tenarian and With Years
to Spare.
In Another M^nth Wou'd Hay
Celebrated H s One Hundred
and Fourth Birthday.
He Was Born in Prussia, but Live 1
the Majir Portion of His Useful
Lif â¢ in America-
Had David Harris lived to see the 15th
of next month he would have been the re
cipient of congratulations upon the one
hundred and fourth anniversary of bis
birth.
The cold hand of death grasped him
Sunday, however, and now sadness and
mourning have taken the place of the
hoped-for joy and celebration that was in
tended to take place at the Harris resi
dence, 822 Turk street.
David Harris was in bis lifetime very
well known in San Francisco. He bad
lived here almost continuously for over
twenty years, and until the last few years
of his life had been actively engaged in
local mercantile affairs.
The vitality and strength of the old
gentleman were remarkable, but no more
so than the vigor and clearness of his
mind and the reliability of bis memory.
Mr. Harris' relatives â most of whom
were children, grandchildren and great
grandchildren â were never certain as to
the real date of his birth until a month
ago, shortly after he had been taken ill.
He then told Mrs. Isaac Harris, his
daughter-in-law, and with whom he had
b<sen living during the past twelve years,
that he was born on the 15th of May, 1793.
He explained to her that he had made a
practice of telling people that he was
younger, but now that he felt tne end was
near he would tell her the true facts.
The dead centenarian was born at
Lankhorst, in the west of Prussia, and
came of a wealthy Jewish family. When
about thirty years of age he started out to
shift for himsaif, having at his command
quite a c>n\fortable fortune. He chose
the occupation of a merchant. For a time
he was quite successful, but the restless
state of Europe at that time combined
with some unfortunate speculations of his
own to bring about a series of reverses
which nearly beggared him and his par
ents as well.
It was tnen that Mr. Harris decided to
emigrate to Americaâ the laud of the free.
He arrived in New York early in 1861.
He launched forth lor himself moderately
as a trader, but was indifferently success
ful. He had two brothers living in New
Orleans and at their suggestion went there
to try his luck. He went Into the genera;
trading business there and made money
from the start. After seven years of this
life he concluded that golden California
offered as many inducements to him as to
the thousands who had come hither and
made fortunes, so he undertook another
journey.
Mr. Harris lived here ever after that,
DAVID HARRIS, Who Died on the Eve of His JC4 h Birthday.
and during his career in this locality has
engaged in many different vocations, but
principally in his favorite capacity of a
trader. During the last-few years of his
life, however, he abstained from the mer
cantile field, and lived in ease and rest
such as he deserved.
The deceased leaves four sons and one
daughter, all ot whom are well past the
meridian ot life themselves, nine grand
children and fifteen great-grandchildren.
The funeral will take place to-day from
the residence of Mrs. Isaac Harris, 822
Turk street.
OLAM-DIGGEE'S PEEIL
Frank Wilson Rescued After Clinging

He was in his boat, about a mile out
from Hunters Point, about 2 o'clock, when

He remained in that position lor over four
hours, when be was rescued by two fisher
men in the boat Gracchi.
They took him to the foot of Green

MILITARY NOTES.
Work of the Signal Corp* of the Third
; * Brigade
Sunday, the 21st, was an ideal day for long
distance heliograph work over theSacrataento
Valley. The Third Brigade Signal Corps cov
ered the distance of thirty-one miles, from the
Capitol, to Vacaville, with .ease... Sergeant
Byrne and Ed Harvey, assisted by Mr. Fother
inghazn, a former member of â  the corps, ran
the instrument at Vacaville, while Lieutenant
Martin and Sergeant Watkhis, with a squad,
â were stationed on the Capitol.
From the Capliol dome, toward the north
west, the Marytville Buttes were plainly dis
cernible; to the soutnwest Mount Diablo's
form was clearly cut against the bright sky;
while ihe iootbilli and beautiful snow-capped
Sierras to the northeast and east offered a
most inviting range ior long-distance work.
Stations were to hhve been opened by 10
o'clock, but a dispa'ch was received from Ser
geant Byrne that owing to the distance of the
Vacavllle station from town a flash could not
be expected until Hbotit noon. The boyÂ« on
the Capitol wni.e<l patiently until about half
past IS, not knowing the exact location of the
communicating station. Exactly at that hour
a bright flash was caught from the foothills
above Vacavllle. The home station was set
up, and signals were kept going for an hour.
Last Tuesday the Signal Corps tendered a re
ception to one of Jts former manners, Assem
blyman Scott F. Ennis. Besides Mr. Ennis

BURNING PAPER
TOLD THE TALE
It Has Landed Katie Mal
conson in a Prison
Cell.
Fire Marshal Towe Claims to
Have a Piain Case of In
cendiarism
The Aftermath of a Strange Confla
gration Last Sa'u diy on
Taylor S'reet.
Katie Malconson has been arrested by
Fire Marshal Towe on a charge of arson.
The prisoner has settled down into a
weeping condition, and can tell nothing
about how she cot into trouble, excepting
that her roomers upstairs must have set
tire to the nous?.
HIJThe story has been told. The house on
Taylor street, near Ellis, wa3 discovered
afire at 4:45 o'clock Saturday morning,
THE LATE WILLIAM P. HUMPHREYS.
and as soon as Assistant Chief John
Dou-.-herty reached the scene he placed
Katie Malconson and two other people he
tound on the grounds under arrest.
It was evident to Dougherty that incen
diarism had been committed, and his
prisoners were turned over to Fire Mar
shal Towe.
The latter has been investigating the
fire ever since with the result that Katie
Malconson will have to explain many
suspicious circumstances.
Tha official rerort of Fire Marshal
Towe shows that t. c insurance, amount*
ing to $1000, was excessive. Further than
t.. at the rooms in which the tire started
were either lock-d or prepared for the
furtherance of a conflagration by ripping
of mattresses and a plentiful distribution
of inflammable material.
Upon ths discovery of a fire in their
home Kntie Malconsou remained in her
room with her head bnried in her hands
instead of runnin? out into the street to
get away from the flames.
But worse tnan all Fire Marshal Towe
ban positive evidence that a piece of
burned newspaper presumed to have been
used in the firing of one of the rooms cor
responds perfectly with another piece
found in the room where Katie Malcon
son was arrested.
The prisoner nas been the keeper of a
lodging-house for transient trade, and she
has lately been a heavy Io3Â«r <~.n the races.

A STATE PIONEER
DIES OF CANCER
William P. Humphreys
Expires at the Lane
Hospital.
A Prominent Character in Local
History for Nearly Half
a Century.
Surveyor for Fifteen Years and Pro
jjctor of Plans for S.wering
tbs City tf Mtxico
William P. Humphreys, Assistant City
and County Surveyor, and for many years
prominent in local history, died at the
Lane hospital yesterday of hemorrhages
and brain fever, both of which resulted
from a malignant cancer of the throat
Mr. Humphreys had not complained of
the affection for more than three months,
though he knew be was doomed long ago.
Mr. Humphreys was born in Pennsyl
vania in 1829 and educated at the Carlisle
University. He came from an old line of
scientists and naval officers. His grand
father was Chief of Construction in the
United States navy, and was offered a
fabulous sum to take charge of some great
engineering work for the Russian Gov
ernment, but he declined.
Afier graduating at Carlisle young
Humphreys entered the navy and was a
midshipman, serving on the Brazil station
on the famous Cumberland. He was or
dered to California in April, 1849, and
after his arrival he was engaged for years
in coast survey work. In 1852 he was
elected City Surveyor, but he went East
in 1853 and remained until 1857, when he
resigned from tbe coast survey. Fiom
1867 to 1882 he was City and County Sur
veyor, and from 1882 until 1886 he was
Railroad Commissioner. After his term
expired he was called to the City of Mex
ico, where he planned the sewer system
by whict that City is now being drained,
he then engaged in dredging operations
in the East, but for three years past he
has been assistant 10 Surveyor Tilton.
Mr. Tilton, though differing from Hum
phreys in politics, was retained lor fifteen
years as assistant during the Humphreys
reeime.
Deceased leaves a widow and two chil
dren â William P. Humphreys and Miss
Alice Humphreys. He was married to
Miss Mary Stincen in 1870. The funeral
will be private and will take place irom
the Jate residence at 11 a. m. to-morrovr.
MARBLE-CUTTERS OBJECT.
They Do Not Want the City Hall Dome
Work Paid For.
The Marble-cutter 3' and Finishers' Asso
ciation discussed the marble work in the
dome of the City Hall iast evening. The
special committee appointed to keep
watch of that job reported that the work
was not up to the standard, and that the
contractors â the California Travertine
Company â are not living op to tht plans
and specifications. The committee far
ther reported that it could do nothing
with the City Hall Commissioners toward
having the irregularities corrected.
The association passed a resolution,
which will be forwarded to the Commis
sioners, demanding that they refuse to
pay tho Travertine Company for the rea
sons stated. More than that the union
practically decided If the Commissioners
do not pay any attention to the resolution
Mint the union will, as citizens, bring an
injunction action aeainst the Commis
sioners to restrain them from paying the
demands of the contractors.

HUBBARD AGAIN
FOR HUNTINGTON
No Changes Anticipated in
Southern Pacific
Officers.
Views Expressed by the. Repre
sentative of the Searles
Estate.
Well Satisfied With the Management
of the Great Railroad Cor
poration.
According to the views of General
Thomas H. Hubbard, there will be no
unusual development at the annual meet
Sng of the stockholders of the Southern
Pacific Company, which is to be held to
morrow. General Hubbard, who arrived
from the East on Sunday night, is the
representative of the Searles estate and is
Becond vice-president of the company.
He was accompanied by William Maul.
controller of the Southern Pacific Com-
pany.
Great interest centers in General Hub
bard, owing to the fact that a year ago he
was strongly ureed by Mrs. Stanford to
stand as a candidate for the presidency of
the great railroad corporation In opposi
tion to Collis P. Huntington. He de
clined to do so, but despite his attitude in
the matter, Mrs. Stanford instructed her
two representatives in the directory of the
Company to cast their votes for the Gen
eral, it is believed that Messrs. Wilson
and Lathrop will follow the same course
at the coining election.
General liubbard appeared in the rail
road building, at the corner of Market
and Montgomery streets, at 11 o'clock
this morning and spent tne greater nart
of the day in conference with C. P. Hunt
ingdon, Colonel Charles F. Crocker and
other prominent officials of the company.
He will also devote most of to-day to fa
miliarizing himself with the affairs of the
company, so far as tney relate to this part
of tne country, and in renewing his ac
quaintanceship with the local otiiLial^.
The main object of the gentleman's
visit is to be present at the elections of
directors and officers of the company,
which are to be held on Wednesday and
Thursday respectively, and to tasu part
in the discussions relative to the future
pol'cy of tlie Southern Pacihc Company.
Though General Hubbard resides in tne
East he is well informed on Southern Pi
cilic Railroad matters on the coast. In
the course of an interview yesterday he
stated that work on ihe rifiy-five-mile gap
on the coast division, between Surf and
Elwood, wonld be pusned as soon as there
â were sufficient funds available for the pur
pose. The last twenty-two miles, he
stated, were particularly expensive, while
business was dull and rates low. Tnis is
one of tne matters that will be discussed
at the meetings of the railroad people to
be held this week.
Concerning the election of officers, he
declared that he did not believe there
would be eny changes, and that no great
divergence would be made in the policy
of the company in any respect.
He was ask-jd if he would cast his vote
for C. P. Huntington as president, but
would not make any direct avowal 01 his
intention. He simply remarked that he
did not see any nece-sity for a change
and did not think there would ba any.
This leaves tne clear inference that C. P.
Huntington will continue as the president
of the Southern Pacihc Company for the
next term.
CONDEMNS ELDER JACKS.
Dr. Scott Spaaks to Pastors
on the Ethics of
Property.
Rev. G. A. Scauite Aidresses the
Baptistsâ German Ministers
Meet.
Rev. Dr. Bcott seized the occasion of a
discussion on "The Ethics of Property,"
at the Presbyterian Ministerial Union
yesterday, to denounce the mercenary
conduct of "the wealthy Presbyterian
elder of San Jose who a few days ago put
an aged couple out on the sidewalk be
cause they were in arrears with their
rent."
Dr. Scott's scathing allusion to the
misuse of wealth was the climax to a
discussion in which Dr. Scott had con
tended that "property that has been
gathered together by the impoverishment
of some one else is robbery." He con
tended that the element of brotherhood
ehould prevail everywhere, and that the
ricti man who overlooks the obligations
ol brotherhood is abusing a sacred trust.
Rev. Dr. Bevier said he thought the
ethics of property a question that belongs
to the church; men should be taught to
look upon wealth as a sacred trust, to be
used for the loftiest ends. Dr. Arthur
Thompson thought the socialistic and an
archistic platforms could do nothing; the
epirit of Christ could alone teach men the
true ethics of property.
Several other questions were considered
by the Presbyterian Union yesterday.
Rev. Dr. Ketchum, while speaking ar
dently in favor of Presoyterianism, re
flected somewhat on the presbytery as an
executive. Rev. J. B. Warren decried tbe
practice of admitting uneducated men
Jrom other denominations into the Pres
byterian ministry.
The following officers of the Presbyterian
Ministerial Union were elected: President,
Rev. Dr. Keichum; vice-president, Rev. H.
W. Bevier; secretary and treasurer, Rev.
James N. Woodworth.
At the Baptist Ministerial Union Rev.
G. A. Scbulte of New York, secretary of
the American Baptist Home Missionary
Society for the Germans, delivered a brief
address, showing the wonderful growth of
the German Baptist church in the United
States.
Rev. Dr. Taft of Alameda read a paper
on "The Day of the Crucifixion." It was
a reply to one read a few weeks ago by
Rev. W. F. Binny.
At the German ministers' monthly
meetirfg a paper was read by Key. I. G.
Bhultz of Lorin.
Key. Dr. James M. Grey, the "lawyer
preacher.' read the paper belore the Chris
istian ministers yesterday. His subject
was "Life in Christ."
At the meeting of the Methodist Min
inters' Association Rev. G. Milnes read a
paper on "The Forces Which Shall Tell on
the Kestored Kingdom of God."
It was announced tnat Dr. Berry would
address the next Monday meeting. A
motion was made to invite ail the min
isters of the Methodist Episcopal Church
South to hear him. Dr. ateele, editor of
the Youne People's Paper of the M. E.
Church Souih n is expected here the last
week in this month. It is likely that he
will address the cub during his visit here.

TO PBOTECT CHILDREN.
A New' Society | Organize*, ' Selects , a
Natne and Elects Officer*.
The Eureka Society for the Protection
of Children is the name of the new or
ganization formed for the prevention of
cruelty to the little ones and for the care
and protection of tho helpless
Tr.e new body is to some extent an off
shoot of the old one, and was brought
into existence by the fact ihat the presi
dent of the California socieiy refused to
investigate charges made against Secre
tary Welch.
Ihe members comprising the new or
gan zation met yesterday in the Donohoe
building, and, after adopting a name and
a constitution and by-laws, elected the
following trustees: Mrs. Kate Pettie, J.
W. Walton, A. C. Bauer, A. R. Frederick,
Henry W. Thorp, M. Stein, Mrs. L. A.
Roberts, E. Wadhani, Mr*. J. W. Reay.
Mrs. W. J. Gurnevt and R. A. Tuttle.
Immediately after the board selected
and appointed tiie following officers:
President, Mrs. Kate Pettie* vice-presi
dent, R. H. Tuttle; treasurer, J. W. Wal
ton; secretary. F. A. Holbrook. It was an
nounced that in addition to work of look
ing after cases oi cruelty the society will
build a home of its own, where homeless
little ones will be sheltered, instead of, as
in the past, being dependent upon orphan
asylums and other charitable institution".
It is expected tnat the new society will
occupy the rooms of the old body in con
junction with the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals.
URBAN FARMERS MEET.
The Formal Organization of a
Club Effected Last
Night.
Professor Pleha Delivered an Inter
esting Lcture on Overtax iticn
en Firms
Formal organization was effected last
night of the San Francisco Farmers' Club
at the Mechanics' Institute. Edward F.
Adams presided.
Professor-Carl C. Plehn of the University
ARCHDEACON PERCY C WEBBER Speaking to the Business Men in the
Chamber of Commerce.
of California delivered a lecture designed
to show how the farmer of this country
was overtaxed in comparison with ti is
more fortunate urban compatriot. He
cited some interesting statistics from the
census of 1800 to make good his claims.
His line of thought was that the evil to
which he called particular attention was
due to the heavy burdens ot taxation
placed on real estate compared to other
property. He argued that the possession
of any form of personal propeny and the
enjoyment of any income, salary or wage
wasequally a sign of ability, and in conclu
sion said, "Eauality in taxation means
equality according to ability."
An informal discussion of the lecture
followed, and advocates of the single tax
theory propounded questions until the
chairman suggested that perhaps the dis
cussion was broadening out too much,
and thus pleasantly put an end to the in
teresting controversy.
In bringing the matter of organization
to the attention of those present Chairman
Adams stated that the object of the club
was to collect and diffuse information on
egricultural subjects, and that in this con
nection documents treating of such mat
ters would be accumulated for the benefit
of the members of the ciub.
The constitution prepared by the com
mittee appointed for that purpose was
read and adopted without amendment.
No president was elected, as the right
mun, bo the chairman informed the mem
bers, had not yet turned up. A man who
was well known as a farmer or large farm
land owner to the people of this City and
the State was wanted, be said .
H. H. Taylor was elected vice-president
and Lovell White treasurer. In view of
the non-election of a president Mr. Taylor
was authorized to appoint the executive
committee of live and the secretary. It is
understood that V. L. O'Brien will be ap
pointed secretary, and that the executive
committee will consist of E. F. Adorns
Ernst A. Denicke, Alfred Hoiman, J. J.
Chappell and Pluto U. JeÂ«?U. The office
of the club will be at 402 Montgomery
street and its place of meeting at the
assembly-room of the Milb building.
Meetings will be held the first Monday of
each month.

Tilt SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 1897.
BUSINES SMEN
KNEEL IN PRAYER
Noon Lenten Services Held
in the Chamber of
Commerce.
Bankers and Brokers Give Hall
an Hour 10 Midday
Worship.
Rev. Percy C. Webber of Boston De
livers the Discourse, Bishop
Nichols the Benedictions
The Chamber of Commerce saw another
signt than that to which it has long been
accustomed. At noon yesterday the deep
tones of an orean shook out into long,
soothing, melodious waves the sharp vi
brations of 'change. Banker and broker,
lawyer and merchant, professional and
business man knelt together in the big,
gloomy room that since its dedication
years ago has echoed daily and to nothing
other than the quick tread of the money
changer.
A minister of the gospel was conducting
divine service and a gathering of men
auch as never came together in San Fran
cisco for the purpose was joining in the
prayer and:responses.
The meeting was the first of a series of
ten, to be held for aa many succeeding
days, inaugurating the Lenten season. A
large organ had been placed in the room
to the lett of the rostrum, the floor had
been covered with white crash ana hand
biils had been circulated throu h the
m&rts and avenues of trade, calling upon
business men to assemble there for a Half
hour at noon to join in divine service.
The meetings are beins conducted under
the auspices of the Brotherhood of St.
Andrew, some one member of which â a
different one each day â will lead them.
Promptly at quarter past 12 o'cioct,
the hour fixed, George H. Andreuss, as
"an humble member of the Brotherhood
of St. Andrew," opened the service. The
rreetinjjs. he said, were addressed to busi
ness men and would be conducted on
business principles; would begin prompt
ly, and be dismissed as promptly upon
the expiration of the half-hour allotted to
them.
The hall was reasonably well filled, all
the Episcopal ministers of the City being
present, seated at the side near the organ,
while Bishop Nichols occupied a seat %>
the front row with the audience. Hugh
Craig and Colin M. Mclntosb did service
as ushers.
Service-books of the society were in
eyery seat. E. W. Bieelow served es or
ganist, and, after the brief introductory of
the leader, the hymn was announced from
a special leaflet printed lor the occasion,
the hymn beginning, "Jesus calls us from
the tumult of our life's wild, restless sea,"
which Roes on to Bay:
Jesus calis us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store;
>rom each idol that would keep us,
baying, "Christians, lovo me more."
And the audience joined heartily in the
singing. V
Archdeacon Webber of Boston then be
gan the short practical address which
characterized the meeting. It was an ap
peal to those present, as captains of in
dustry, to make their business callings as
one with the service of God; that they
should carry that thought with them al
ways into trade, politics and profession;
that in conducting their own business
they : should . ever remember \ that i they
were at the same time "like ' r the man of
Nazarath conducting "My Father's busi
ness." â¢;
He urged upon them, in consonance
with this thought, consideration for oth
ers. "When a poor man comes to your
desk asking for work do not turn to him
with a sharp word of denial, excusing
yourself with the thought of the affairs
pressing upon you, but think of the hours
that the man may have waited outside
before he plucked up courage to enter.
The thoughtless word from you will be
ashes to his lips and add to his burden of
discouragement.
"Then, again, if you have a man in your
service who has some weakness, why
should you dismiss him summarily, or re
fuse to try him again, and so loose his
hold upon possible redemption and give
him over to destruction ?"
He charged his hearers to broaden their
jives by being interested. "Bo interested
in human nature, interested in the pros
perity of the City. The greatest power of
all is the power over human hearts. You
and I know there i* no such power with
out that interest that deepens into joy and
hope in Jife and without it."
Bishop Nichols delivered the benedic
tion and the business men went back to
their labors, expressing great satisfaction
in the expenence. The meeting will be
held to-day at the same hour.

REV. MR . CRUZAN RESIGNS
He Will Now Devote All
Hi 3 Energies to "The
Pacific."
Olivet Congregational Church has lost
a rirst-class pastor nnd the Pacific, the
organ of Congregationalism, has gained a
first-class managing editor, business man
ager and all-around man of affairs, all in
the same person.
For several years past the Pacific had
been conducted by Rev. John Kimbail
and Deacon S. S. Smith. Mr. Kimball
being the manasing editor and Deicon
Smith the business manager. But old
ate and ill health overtook them, Deacon
Smith almost having lost his eyesight
and Rev. Mr. Kimbail becoming so intinn
that he could not do the work.
In thiÂ«s contingency Rev. John A. Cru
zan, pastor of Olivet Church, was asked
to taki charge of the paper, he having
been an old-time printer and familiar with
newspaper work. He accepted, and no
tified his congregation on January 1 of
this year that as ne would do the work of
three men on the Pacific, it would not be
possible for him to perform trie duties of
his pastorate, and that he would tender
his resignation as soon as a successor could
be obtain* d.
Sinca that date Rev. Mr. Crnzan has
filled the pulpit of Olivet Church, but has
not performed any oi his pastoral duties.
Rev. H. D. Shepard, a young preacher of
great nromise, was asked to become the
pastor of Olivet Church, and he accepted
the trust a week ago, whereupon Rev. Mr.
Cruzan resigned.
Hey. Mr. Shepard is a single man, just
enteiing into the prime of life. He waa a
classmate of Dr. Rader in tne Andover
Theological Seminary, and recently held
the pastorate of the Congregational
church at Elk Point, near Sioux Falls, S.
D. His preaching is ex emTioraneous,
and is said to be ail the more effective on
that account.

WISHES OFFICIALS
TO DO THEIR DUTY
Mayor Phelan on the
District Attorney's
Office.
Interesting Figures Will B
C m id ud: cared to the
Supervisors.
â¢
Expenses Increased Faster Than Work.
Health Beard Attorney Should
Do His Work.
Mayor Phelan's quiet investigation into
the manner in which the District Attor
ney's office is conducted has convinced
him that there is need of a reform of some
kind and he will address the Supervisors
on the matter in a manner that will prob
ably make the members of the board open
their eyes.
The inquiry that is now progressing
was suggested to the Mayor by a com
munication Irom District Attorney Barnes
to the Supervisors, in which that official
requested that Attorney Joseph P. Dunne
be retained as special counsel to assist in
keeping the office from running behind
with its work.
Mr. Barnes took occasion to remark in
his petition that there were fifty-eight
criminal cases on the calendars of the va
rious courts that must be attended to and
that the services of Mr. Dunne were very
necessary lor an indefinite period to come.
At the time the Mayor called the atten -
tion of the board to the fact that the spe
cial counsel fund was exhausted and that
there was no money to pay Him ii he was
retained. He also stated that the attor
ney was engaged almost exclusively in
prosecuting violators of the pure-food
laws and had been paid a salary for doing
what the City al.owed the attorney of the
Board of Health $3000 a year for attend
ing to.
In spite of the Mayor's mild remon
strance the board saw fit to stand in with
the District Attorney and voted to retain
Mr. Dunne.
Then Mr. Phelan started in to ascertain
whether or not the attorney was actually
needed and procured information as to
the character of the cases that the District
Attorney has under his care, whether or
not continuance* had been granted and
who asked lor them.
As a result of the investigation he learned
many interesting and valuable facts that
will be embodied in the message to the
board.
"I have ascertained," said the Mayor
yesterday, "that the business of the Dis
trict Attorney's office has not increased to
any material extent during the past few
years, but that the expenses have been run
up to a degree that requires investigation
and correction.
"There are a number of sinecures that
might be dispensed with, and lam told
that in one case an official who receives a
fat salary does work of a character entirely
opposite 01 wcat it should be. It is time
tna: the officer of this City government
â were run on business principles.
"Attorney Dunne is expected to handle
these pure food cases while we have an at
-1 orney at $3000 per year to look after them.
I understand that he turns the pay over to
the widow of Dennis Spencer, who died
while holding the office.
"That is probably true, and Spencer was
no doubt a good fellow, but I do not
see why the City should pension Mrs.
Spencer, even though it is a deserving
case. It has not been done in other cases
and it is not business.
"The Boaid of Health fnnds pay for the
service and the man who draws it should
either do the service required or give way
to some one who will. 1 trust that the
board will see that this is only common
sense and their duty to taxpayers and
remedy the matter."
Tne board was addressed yesterday by
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation in a letter asking that the board
appoint Attorney Dunne an Assistant
District Attorney and find some means of
paying his salary. The association is
particularly anxious to have Dunne kept
in office because of the fact that be is en
gaged in prosecuting violators of the pure
lood laws.
BAD MONEY.
Frank Karvine Acquitted of the Charge
of Fasting Counterfeits.
United States Commissioner Heacock
yesterday dismissed the case of the United
States against Frank Karvine on the
charge of having passed a counterfeit
dollar.
Karvine is cashier for the Chicago Club
bookmakjng concern at the races and he
passed the counterfeit coin on George S.
Loryea in payment of a winning pool
ticket. The testimony showed that Kar
vine was in the-enipioy of Abe Levy; tnat
the money received for pool tickets was
token in by Levy, placed on a tray and
passed over to Karvin to pay the winners.
The similar charge against George Lew
ison, cashier for Uarlan & Co., will be
heard this morning. The complainant is
G. Leopold.
The tJnited States oiEcors have recently
beard much complaint concerning the ut
tering of bad coin dollars and $5 gold
pieces at the racetrack. There have been
more complaints of counterfeit money
there than anywhere else. The bad dollar
is a dangerous counterfeit, having all the
appearance and the ring of the genuine,
but it is a little lighter in weight.

The Afro-American League of California has

IN THE FAIR CASE
Half a Hundred Continu
ances Have Been
Granted.
Mr. Delmas Insisted on a
Speedy Trial for Mrs.
Craven.
Attorneys for th? Opposition Joined
in A:king for More Delay and
Won Thtir Point.
Another continuance in the Fair-Craven
litigation!
It was granted yesterday on the desire
of attorneys for thosa representing the
Fair estate and the heirs at law.
It was the fiftieth continuance in the
case and may be fitly celebrated by those
who enjoy these postponements aa the
semi-centennial of the taliy of contin
uances that will doubtieas reach par if all
the parties to the controversy live long
enough.
Wnen the full hundred is touched then
the centennial ceremonies may be pro
vided for and to mark the event another
distribution of proceeds of the estate may
be looked for, provided the funds hold
out.
Public interest in this litigation never
flags. As a judicial spectacuar it is a
drawing card. This truth received addi
tional illustration yesterday by the eager
crowd of lawyers and citizens in Judge
Slack's court in anticipation of his
Honor's decision of several important
points in the suit of the executors of
James G. Fair's will agaiast Mrs. Nettie
R. Craven.
As usual Judge Slack had a long calen
dar in probate and insolvency proceed
ings, yet the people sat patiently through
two hours and a half of tedious legal
wrangling in order to listen to the judicial
opinion touching the question of impanel
ing a jury to assist Juuge Slack iv decid
ing issues of fact. and. secondarily, as to
the motion of Delmas & Shortridge, attor
neys for Mrs. Craven, to strike Miss Vir
ginia Fair's complaint iv intervention
from the files of the case.
It was high noon when the Judge began
to read his opinion, yet there was no
diminution of the audience and tbe closest
possible attention was given to every word
that fell irom the lips from the beginning
to the end.
A succinct history of the litigation was
presented by Judge Slack in the opening
portion of his opinion. He casually arew
attention to the fact that the action was
begun on June 23, 1896, by James S. Angus,
Thomas G. Crothers and W. S. Goodiel
low, as surviving special administrators of
the estate of James G. Fair, deceased,
against Nettie It. Craven, Marc Leving
ston, George R. Williams, Stephen
Itoberts, Elizabeth Haskins and several
others sued under fictitious names.
O:i July 2, 1896, the defendants George
B. Williams, Stephen Roberts and Eliza
beth Haskins riled a disclaimer, and on
August 11, lf*9ti, the default of the de
leudunt Marc .Levingston waa entered.
Thp defendant Nettie R. Craven on July
7, 1896, hied an answer and also a cross
complaint in ejectment to recover the
possession of the lands described in the
compiaint and for rents, pTofits and dam
aee--. To this cross-cornr>laint the
plaintiffs, on August 3, 1896, tiled an
answer consisting of admissions and de
nials. After thus stating the inception of
the suit tne court adds:
While the pleadings were in this condition
& stipulation was entered into between the at
torneys for the plaintiffs and the attorneys lor
the defendant, Netlie R. Craven, by which it
was agTeed that the "action" should be set for
trial for February 2. 1897, "and that the same
be tried before a jury, if either party shall ten
days before said date give and file a written
request for a jury." In due time, on January
s', 1897, the attorneys for the defendant, Net
tie R. Craven, filed a writing by which they
"request and demand a jury for the trial of
said cause." The case appeared on the calen
dar for trial on February 2, 1897, but the trial
was postponed.
In the meantime the will of James O. Fair
was admitted to probate, and the plaintiff*
were appointed executors. The plaintiffs,
having obtained an order permitting them
selves to be substituted in the action as
executors, in place Â« i special administrators,
filed, on February 25, 1897, a supplemental
complaint. The supplemental complaint al
leges that on December 28, 1894, James G.
Fair was the owner in fee simple, and in the
possession, of two described pieces of land;
that on said day and while he was the owner
In fee simpie of the lands, James G. Fair died,
leaving- a last will; that on January 2, 1895,
the plaintiffs, together with one Louis C.
Hresse, were appointed special administrators
ot the estate oi the deceased, with certain
powers; tnat the .special administrators
immediately qualified and took and
retained possession of all of the estate of the
deceased, including the lands in question un
til April 22. 1896, when J-ouis C. Brerse died,
since which time until November 10, 1896,
the plaintiffs, as surviving special adminlstrH
tors, continued In possession ; that on June 23.<
'3896, this court authorized the plaintiffs, a/
surviving special administrators, to commence
this action; that on November 16, 1896, the
last will of James G. lair was admitted to
probate nnd the QlaintiS-i were appointed
and qualified as executors; and that since
November 16. 1896, the plaintiffs, as such ex
ecutors, have continued in the possession and
management of all the estate of the deceased,
including the lands in controversy, and have
collected and received, and are now collecting
and receiving, the reals, issues and profits of
Eaia lands, amounting to the sum ol $4000 per
month'or thereabouts.
The supplemental complaint proceeds to al
lege in language substantially the same as
contained in the original complaint that the
deeds nndcr which the defendants claim title
are forced and simulated and ought to be
canceled.
The prayer of the supplemental complaint
also conforms substantially to the prayer of
the original complaial.
The ansr.or and cross-complaint oi the
defendant, Nettie R. Craven, tiled on February
29, 1897, to the hu^picmerital complaint, arÂ«
similar to the answer and cross-compiaint tiled
by her to the original complaint. " â¢ â¢
The cross-com plaint is In the ordinary form
oi a complaint li> ejectment. It alleges that Â«n
January 2, 1895, the defendant, Nettie R.
Craven, was the owner, and seized in fee and
in the possession of the iands described in the
supplemental comp'.ainl; that on January 2,
1895, the plaintiffs were appointed special
administrators ol the estate ot James G. Fair,
deceased, with certain powers; that thereupon
they qualified as such, and that their special
letters were never ' modified, revoked
or set aside until November 16, 1896;
that on November 16. 18!)U, an Instru
ment, purporting to be the last
will ofJatr.es G. Fair, was admitted to probate,
and the plaintiffs were appointed and quali
fied as executors thereof, and have ever since
been and stilt are the qualified nnd acting
executors; that on January 2, 1895, while the
defendant was such owner' and so seized and
entitled to the possession of me premises, the
plaintiffs, acting us such special Kdministra
lors. without right or i i lie, did enter into and
upon the premises, and did oust nnd eject the
deicudant therefrom; that thereafter, until
November 1tÂ», 18!)6, Die plaintlfs. as such
tpecial admiuHtrntors, have withheld and
stil. withhold the pouesalbn thereof from the
defendant, to her damage in the sum of $200,
--000; and that tin- value of the rents and
pr.itm oi thu t-rctniscs, irom and affer January
~ H!Â»5, in. Ii aÂ» been and will continue to be
$5000 per month.
The plaintiffs, on March 8, 1897, filed an
answer to th'j cross-complaint, in which, as in
tneir answer to the original crcss-compiaint,
they deny all of Mrs. Craven's allegations.
The decision necessarily contained many
quotations from lormer pleadings, jroing
over subjects already familiar to the read
ing public. After setting forth the condi
tions that prevailed up to the time of the
tiling of Miss Fair's bill In mtervenor the
court said:
'''our days after the answer to the cross
complaint was filed, and three days before the
case was to be called for trial, on the dny on
which it was set, to wit, on March 12. 1897,
Virginia Fair tiled, by leave of the court, a
complaint in intervention in which she alleges
that she is the owner in fee simp c absolute of
an undivided one-third of the lands described
In the original complaint and in the cross
comDlaint; that James G. Fair was during all
the month of September, 1894, the owner in
fee simple absolute of the lands; that James
G. Pair died on or about December 27, 1894;
that iv the year 1895 the defendants, Nettie
K. Craven, Elizabeth Haskius and James J.
Cooney, together with other persons whose
true names are unknown to the lnterveaor,
com Dined and confederated together and en
tered into and concocted a fraudulent scheme,
combination and conspiracy for the purpose
of procuring for themselves, by means of forged
documents and false evidence, the said real
property; that thereafter and pursuant to the
fraudulent scheme, combination and con
spiracy, the said defendants prepared and ut
tered two fahe and pretended deeds, purport
ing to havo been executed by James G. Fair on
September 8. 1894; that said deeds were not
made or executed by James G. Fair, nor ever
acknowledged by him, and the instruments
and the signatures thereto are false, forged
and simulated, and were made subsequent to
the death of James G. Fair, pursuant to and as
a part of the fraudulent scheme, combination
and conspiracy.
Miss Fair's complaint in intervention is
epitomized down to the last allegation
and intention of frnud and conspiracy,
after which the court takes up tbe thread
of the narrative in regard to the course of
the present litigation. He said:
On March 13. 1897, Itie defendant, Nettie R.
Craven, moved to strike the complaint in in
tervention irom the files, and to vacato and
set aside the order permitting it to be tiled, ou
tlie principal grounds ibat by it tne inter
venor sought to change the subject-matter of
the action; that the intervenor sought an
other and other and diilerent relief than any
which could be granted to either parly upon
the issues heretofore joined in the action ;
that the intervenor sought to change the
method of procedure established by law for
the trial of such actions, and adopted
by the parties to the action; that the
intervenor sought to delay the trial of
the action, and tha result of permit
ting t ho intervention would be to delay
the trial; that tne intervenor nas been guilty
of gross laches in delaying her attempt to in
tervene; tnai the intervenor is not a neces
sity party to the action, and a judgment in
favor 01 the plaintiffs -will as completely
establish her claim as a judgment in favor of
herself; that the complaint in intervention is
not filed In good faith, but has been filed solely
for the purpose of hindering and delaying the
defendant in estab.ishing her rights* and to
vox, annoy and harass the defendant; and
that the complaint in intervention does not
disclose facts authorizing an intervention. No
affidavit in support of the motion was tiled.
The motion to strike the complaint in in
tervention irom the tiles was partly heard and
then continued until March 15, 1897, at which
time the action had been set for trial. On that
day, at the calling of the case on the calendar,
the plaintiffs moved the court to proceed witn
the trial of the equitable issue raised by the
pleadings in the case, and to dispose of those
issues before a jury should be called to try the
legal issues .Both motions woretresisted. â¢ *
The motion to proceed with the trial of the
equitable issues will be first considered, be
cause the questions presented by it are in
volved, to some extent, in the motion to strike
the intervention from the files.
After quoting copiously from the au
thorities touching 'be matter under dis
cussion Judge Slack added:
Sufficient has been said to show that an
aciion to quiet title, brought under section
738 of the Code of Civil Procedure, oy a plain
tiff in possession, whose possession has not
been disturbed by legal proceedings, and an
action to remove a cloud from tit.c are in their
nature alike. The one is equitable as is the
other, and the one rests quite as much upon
the principle quia timet rainer than upon the
doctrine of preventing a multiplicity of suits
â s does the other, so fur as the purposes of
the actions are concerned, however, there is
a difference between them. This difference
between actions to remove clouds from title
and actions to quiet title under the statute is
clearly pointed out by Commissioner llayne
in Castro vs. Barry (79 Cal. 443, 446).
In the decision tne following significant
passage occurs:
It is to be remarked that Nettie R. Craven,
the only defendant who has answered, does
not set forth in her answer the particulars of
her claim*, further than her admissions of
allegations of the supplemental complaint and
her averments thai "the deeds are true and
genuine and that she is the owner in fee s;:u
p.e may so operate. The unnecssary matter
in the supplemental compiaiiu whs not, how
ever, attacked, nor was any objection made to
the efficiency of the answer. The meaperness
ofth.e ayermer.ts of the answer, nevertheless,
affords sonic: justification for the special plea j
iv the answer to the cross-complaint, assailing
the deeds as a cloud upon title.
Notwithstanding the equitable nature of
the supplemental complaint, the defendant,
Nettie R. Craven, is entitled 10 a jury trial as
to the legal issues which it may be present;
â¢ * * but not as to equitable issues, if any
there be: Hancock vs. hammer, GO id. 337;
Crouker vs. Carpenter, 93 Id. 413. The proper
course of procedure to pursue, did the case
stand alone upon the supplemental complaint
and the answer, is stated by Chief Jnstlee
field in Curtis vs. Sutter, 15 Cnl. 200, 203. ***
The defeudant, -Settle R. Craven, had with
out doubt, the right to file her cross-complaint
in ejectment: see Donahue vs. Meister, 88
Cal. 121 ; and, in fact, her right to do so is not
disputed. In so doing she became an actor
standing with reference to the cross-com
plaint substantially in the same position aa if
she had filed it as an original complaint iv a
separate aciion, and the plaintiffs, on the
other hand, are substantially in the position
of defendants in suen nn action: Ewlng vs.
Patterson, 35 Ind. 320 330. No good reason
has been suggested why a defendant in an ac
tion of ejectment, or a plaintiff when a cross
complaint in ejectment has been interposed
against him, may not. in the exercise of his
righ; to piead any defense which he may have
under proper certain circumstances set forth
facts showing that the instruments relied
upon by the complaiuant as muniments of
title constitute v cloud upon his own title and
pray that the cloud be removed. There
is, of course, nn doubt that he might under
denials show the complainants muniments of
of title to be void. â¢ * â¢
It is to be observed in this case that the
plaintiff* are in pos*et>sio:i and the defendant,
Nettie K. Craven, is out of possession, and it
may be assumed that the intervenor is also
out of possession.
The deeds in question, although they are
alleged to be forced, constitute, if the allega
tions are true, cloud* upon title, because their
inval.dity does rot appear on their face, and
because, particularly, having certificates ot
acknowiedmen; attached, and having been
recorded, they may be read in evidence with
out further proof, and certified copies of their
records can also be tnut read in evidence,
under section 1951 ot the Codo of Civil Pro
cclure: Remington Paper Compar.y vs.
O '.Dougherty, 81 N. V.,474; Natiuua. Bank vs.
Levy, 127 Idaho, 549; Dunes vs. (jalliisther , r>
Biatchf., 481; Byerly vs. Humphrey, 95 N. C,
151. * â¢ â¢
Judge Slack thus presented bis con
clusion in regard to the right of Mrs.
Craven to jury trial under the conditions
as produced by the tiling of Miss Fair's
coni plaint in intervention :
The issues raised by the cross-complaint must
fim bo disposed oi: Whittier vs. Btege, Gi, <;al.,
'J3B; Kish vÂ«. Benson, 71 Id., 428, 434. The
equitable delense to the cross-complaint is,
furthermore; flrit to be passed upou, and on
tnu trial of the issues presented by such
defense, the parties have no lepal right to a |
jury: Argueilovs. Ediriger, 10 Cal.. 150, 100; I
Estrada vs. Mutiny. 19 Id.. 248, 272; Weber!
vs. Marshall, 19 id., 447, 457: Lvstrade vs.
Barth, 19 Id.. 061, 071 ; Downer vs. Smith, 24
lv.. 114 184; Mania vs. Z"llerbach. 38 Id..
300,319; Fish vs. Kensou, 71 Id.. 428. 434;
Suasoy vs. Adair, 88, Id., 179. Thus, in Es
trada vs. Murphy, supra, the Court, after the
language already quoted, continues: "The
equitable defense is, therelore, iirst to be
passed upon by the court, and until it is dis
posed uf the assertion ol the legal remedy is
in effect stayed. Upon the determination of
the court upon the relief prayed by the an
swer the necessity of proceeding witn the ac
tion at law will depend. When it does proceed
the legal title will control its result." Again,
in Weber vs. Marshall, eupra, it Was said; '-It
does not by any means follow that a jury
mast be called to pass upon an equitable de
fense to an action of ejectment. The parties
are entitled to a irial by jury upon the
legal is^ufis, but the court, sitting to admin
ister equitaole relief, either by way of
defense to an action of ejectment or affirma
tively sits as a chancellor and in the exerc.se
of equitable powers, may or may not order an
iosue or issues to a jury in it* discretion." The
legai issues may thereafter be required to be
submitted to a jury as of right: Taylor vs.
Ford, 92 Cal. 419. These results cannot at
ell be affected by the fact that the parties at
an early stage of the controversy stipulated
that the ".iction" shruld be tried before a
jury: See Bouiey vs. Ferguson, 30 Cnl., fill.
The motion :o proceed first with the trial of
the eauitable issues must ihereiorebe giauted
in soiarunl s > far only as it relates to the
eg iritabie issues presented by the answer to
ih c cross-complaint.
The ruling on the motion to strike the
complaint in the intervention from the
files, as Judge Slack lemarked, was fore
shadowed in most particulars by the
views of the court already expressed.
The objection that the complaint in inter
vention should not be allowed because of the
iDtervenor's delay cannot be sustained. The
intervention was in time under the law as it
now stands if the application for leave to in
tervene was made, as here, before the trial.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 1897.
(Coburn vs. Smart, 53 Cal., 742; Thompson vs.
Huron Lumber.Company. 4 Wash, COO) The
case of Smith vs. Gale. 144 U. S., 509, which
holds to tbe contrary, Unit the application
may be refused because oi unreasonable delay,
even though made before the trial, is based
upon the case of Hacker vs. Kelley, 14 Cnl.,
I 104, decided under a statutory provision dif
i Jerent from the section of the code above
I quoted. Besides, an intervenor, as the one at
me bar. who makes application for leave to in
tervene four days after the issues were joined
iv the principal suit and three days before the
case was to be called for trial, cannot be said
i to have been guilty of unreasonable delay.
It is also contended that the proceedings in
' intervention, if .permitted to stand, will re
! tard the principal Milt, and that this must
I not be done. (Gaiaes vs. Page, 15 La.
I Ann., 108; Taylor vs. Boedicker, 22
M., 79: Van Gorden vs. Ormsby,
.->â¢â¢ lowa, 057: Teachout vs. Dcs &Loines and
I r. Railway, 75 Id., 722: Kassing vs. Walter,
i\T> N. W ., 832 (Iowa); Eccles vs. Hill,
jl3 Texas, 67; Kagland vs. Wisrock, 61
Id., 391). This rule, in Louisiana and in lowa,
Is ba*ed upon special statutory provisions:
(Lb. Rev. Code of Pr. Art. 191; McClain's Ann.
Code of lowa, ccc. 3890). The rule, however,
has its limitations. It does not apply to the
necessary delay in reaching issues on the
complaint in intervention, but only to such
delays as continuances to procure evidence.
The motion to strike the complaint in inter
vention from the liles must, for these reasons,
be denied.
The close of Judge Slack's remarks was
the signal for anotuer struggle on the part
of attorneys opposed to Mrs. Craven to
see which could offer the most potent
reason for furtner delay.
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler intimated
that it was luncheon time, and said that
though he wished to offer certain sug
gestions to the court in opposition to the
calling cf a jury to assist tbe chancellor
at this time, yet he would prefer to take
up tbe subject at 2 o'clock in the after
noon, so a recess was taken until that
time.
In tbe afternoon another gathering of
lawyers and citizens tilled Judge black's
courtroom, and ibe interest was unabated.
The Judge looked inquiringly at Mr.
Wheeler, and that gentleman somewhat
bashfully began to tell why he did not
think It wise to call in a jury at this stage
of the proceedings, but he had not cot far
in his baiting argument before he paused,
and with evident embarrassment said that
it had just occurred to him that no answer
to Miss Fair's intervention had been filed
by Mrs. Craven.
"I was not unmindful of tbat fact," re
marked Judge black dryly.
Mr. Delmas asked that the answer be
considered filed, and that the matter be
proceeded with at once. Ho desired to
avoid delay.
The court was still looking quizzically
at Mr. Wheeler.
There were signs of balking on Mr.
Wheeler's part, but Judge Slack mildly
insisted that certain suggestions bad been
promised for the after-luncheon session,
und he would like to hear them.
At length Mr. Wheeler appealed to the
court, asking tbat he be excused from
further remarks until after Mrs. Craven's
answer to the suit in intervention has
been filed.
Mr. Delmas again protested against this,
saying that it would only cause vexatious
and unprofitable delay, and that as the
answer would ba a simple denial, it might
be considered in.
Mr. Wheeler's embarrassment was be
coming painful, and tbe court at last
granted the relief so vehemently sought
by him.
Then another plan for putting off the
trial was disclosed. Mr. McEnerney
stated that Mr. Angus and the other
trustees under the will do not admit Miss
Fair's ownership of the property and that
he, as attorney for the trustees, would file
an answer to her complaint.
Judge Slack in reply to a remark by
Mr. Delmas said tbat this course was
rightfully open to Mr. McEnerney'3
c.ienis, and that Mr*. Craven might
answer or demur or might decline to act
altogether with respect 10 thn su t in in
tervention. H; would not be held re
sponsible, however, lor the result oi inac
tion.
Mr. Delmas said it was recognized that
the court had not passed on the sufficiency
of the complaint, but Mrs. Craven hesi
tated to fi.e a demurrer lest it might inter
fere with the trial of the main issue.
It was agreed that all opposing parties
shall answer or demur within forty-eight
hours, and that the suggestions of
Wheeler against the railing in of a jury
ahull be heard next Thursday.
Formal orders were made tor the partial
distribution of the bequests provided in
the will, including $2000 to Herbert
Clarke, $10,000 for J. 8. Anjrus, $14,800 for
the estate of Mr. Bresse, $10,000 for James
Fair, $r30.000 for Archbishop Â»Riordan,
$70,000 for minor heirs represented by at
torney Van R. Pate.-son, $22,727 for Wesley
Crotbers and other small legacies bring
ing the total up to about $200,000. It was
ascertained that the estate has plenty of
money on band and that tbe bequests
may be paid without inconvenience.
Then Mr. Wheeier arose and said that
he wished to press the petition of the
children of James G. Fair that all tbe roal
property owned by the deceased be dis
tributed to them directly and immedi
ately.
Mr. Delmas objected to any such action
touching the real property claimed by the
client represented by himself and Mr.
Sbortridge.
Judge Slack thought it would compli
cate matters to include tbe disputed lota
In such an order of distribution, and Mr.
Wheeler abandoned tbat point.
It remains to be seen what plea for se
curing more delay will be thought up by
the opponents of Mrs. Craven between
now and next Thursday.
TOE JEWISH CHILDBED

HIS MINES AVAILED NOT.
George W. Silver Arrested for Issuing
a Bogus Check.
George W. Silver, the alleged discoverer
of gold mines in the Peruvian Andes
South America, was arrested last night by
Detectives Dillon and Crockett at 1149
Mission street, and will be charged with
issuing a fictitious check.
Yesterday he gave his landlady a check
for $2 in payment of ono week's rent, on
the American Trust Bank. When she
presented the check at the bank she was
told that no such man had an account
there, so she notified the police.
The polite are making an investigation
into S.lrer's antecedents and they say that
ne is an accomplished fraud.
At the same time investigation hnÂ« veri
fied at least a portion of his wonder'u!
story. His alleged mines, it seems, were
discovered sevsral years ago, reports
made upon them, macliinery boueht and
shipped to Peru and the matter kept
durk by those closely interested. It is
thought that Silver in some way came
into possession of the knowledge of the
mines and that his stories werg built on
that information.

HEADS ARE SAFE
FOR THE PRESENT
Beard of Supervisors Said
to Have Declared a
Truce.
Only One Patrol Wagon Driver
Removed at Yesterday's
Meeting.
Police Commission r M- A- Gunst
Given a L?ava of Ab.encs Be
cause of Sickness.
The gallery and lobby of the meeting
room of the Board of Supervisors were
crowded yesterday in anticipation that
something sensational in the way of
changes in the matter of City employes
would occur, but for some reason a truce
has been declared among the warring poli
ticians and only one man lost his job.
Supervisor Clinton is particularly inter
ested in Edward Nolan and had him for a
patrol- winon driver's position, Emt when
the slate was made up at the last meeting
Nolan was put down for a janitor's bertn.
Tii is did not suit the doctor a little bit and
he refused to vote for the slate.
Yesterday the matter was patched up
by removing Patrol Driver George How
ard and eiving Nolan the place. Nolan's
vacant jamtorsnip was filled by the ap
pointment of Charles Eerkson.
It is confidently asserted by Supervisors
in a position to know the state of affairs
that while there may be a few more minor
chanzes the board will not make the gen
eral cleaning out that was feared a few
days ago.
Polica Commissioner M. A. Gunst was
granted a six months' leave of absence,
with permission to leave the State, to be
t'iu on the 11th inst. His physician certi
fied that he was seriously ill and that it
would be necessary for him to consnlt cer
tain physicians in Europe in order to ob
tain the best results.
Gas and Water Inspector Charles L.Tay
lor notified the board that the Spring Val
ley Water Company had failed to place
meters in certain public buildings and
squares as required. la his communica
tion he say- :
Pursuant to your resolutionâ No. 15,851,
third seriesâ requiring the Spring Valley
Water Company to attach meters to several
scnoolhouses named therein, also City and
County Hospital and Alta pluza, I have to re
port:
Upon receipt of the resolution referred to I
immediately railed upon the company and re
quested that they would notify me as soon as
tne rneterx were placed as requested, to which
the reply was made that it would be some lit
tle time before this could be accomplished as
they had no meters available for the purpose.
I have siiuee made several calls ou the com
pany in order to ascertain what they iutended
to do in tnis matter, but with very little satis
fnction, as the company claimed that there
must be an understanding witn the Vt Â»ier
Committee of the Board of Supervisors as to
who will pay tbe cost of the mÂ»iers, especially
as they claim that, it will be necessary to
either have them manu:actur d or Â»cud East
for them. This is one ot the subjects for your
consideration and in which 1 nave no power
or discretion.
The matter was referred to the Water
Committee. Supervisor Clinton gave no
tice thai at tne npxt meeting he would
offer a resolution that several men be ap
pointed as street and sidewalk inspectors
so that all public work may be examined
as it goes along. His action was caused
by the protest of proper:y-owners in dif
ferent sections that their sidewalJcs, curbs
ana other street improvements are not
being done according to specifications.
A resolution permitting the perform
ance of street work by private contract
until certain material points bearing on
the matter are decided by the Supreme
Court was adopted unanimously.
Supervisor Clinton presented a resolu
tion ordering abandoned and removed
certain hydrants that had been reported
by the Fire Department as of no further
use to the City. The resolution, which
was adopted, was as follows:
Reso'ved, That the Chief Engineer of the Fire
Department is hereby empowered to have re
moved by the mechanics employed in said de
partment the hydrants erected and maintained
at the following locations, the same being of
no further service for the extinguishing of
fires, to wit: One hydrant at each of the fol
lowing locations: On the east line of Fifth av
enue ; at points 22b feet north of Fulton street,
80 feet south of C street, 300 feet north of C
street, 80 feet south o! B street and 300 feet
north of B street, aiso at the Dortbeast corner
of Fulton street and Fourth avenue.
Resolved. That the Spring Valley Water Com
pany is hereby required to take notice lhat
said hydrants being of no further use. are
hereby abandoned and no further payment
will De made on said hydrants.
Thomas i Sawyer, president of the Society
of Old Friends, notified the board that the
parties who recently aDplied for a permit
for a masquerade ball under the name of
the society have no connection with the
original organization and that the organi
zation has no masquerade under contem
plation.
Mayor Phelan appointed as a Committee
on Taxation, in conformity with the reso
lution offered at the last meeting by Su
pervisor Clinton, Supervisors Clinton,
Dodge und Lack man.

WILL HAVE A NEW LAUNCH
A Beautiful Craft to Be Built
:or the Fish Com
mission. â¢
It Will Be Used to Apprehend Illegal
Fish?rmen on the Rivers
and Bays-
The California State Fish and Game
Commission is to have a gasoline launch
of its own, and fiom the plans proposed
by John Twigg & Son, the builders, it will
be a clipper in its line. In tue past the
commissioners have been obliged to hire
a launch for all raids upon the rivers and
on the bay. For tbree years the Hustler
has b' en doing service in this line at a
great expense to the State.
At the meetine of the commissioners
yesterday the contract for the Quinnat,
for this will be the name of the bout, was
let. In dimensions it will be 36 feet long,
T 1 ... feet beam, and will draw only 3 feet of
water. This will permit of going into
many places where a deeper vessel would
not be able.
The boat will be driven by a twenty
horsepower union gas engine, and it is
expected that the craft will be the speedi
est of her class in these waters. The cabin
is to be inclosed by glass and will have
sleeping and living accommodations for
six men.
The launch will probably he completed
within ninety days nnd will cost $261.0.
Deputy Davis, who is now up the river
on the Hustler, reported that recently,
while on the Tolanu drift, near Rio Vista,
be confiscated a salmon boat and net, but
th at the men escaped into tbe tulec
Above Coliinsville he capture 1 three men,
a salmon boat and net. All of these were
violating the law which prohibits tbe
talcing of salmon between sunrise on Snt

My troubles had annoyed me for years, and my back was so weak I could not lift twenty-five pound*.
The belt knocked the pain out in six weeks and the rheumatism in three, and I have no; Telt a touch

changed now and am talking for it nij-3eif. Yours truly, E. J. BURKE. 1624 Powell street.
Remember that there is no other Electric Belt like Dr. Scnden's. His thirty years' study
and experience has made his Belt as near perfect as an Electric Belt can be. - The regulator
alone is an important feature ; possessed by no other Electric Belt, and any one wlio has used
the old-style article will appreciate beinK able to make the current mild or strong at will
while the Belt is on the body. To cure, an Electric Belt must be strong, durable and easy 'to

' " I can speak in the highest term* of
Ripans Tahules
said the man from Washington. "I have been for years troubled with
nightmare (an erroneous expression, but one-that thousands are familiar with),
and have suffered a thousand deaths, being caused directly by a torpid liver,
thence stagnation of the blood. A short while after retiring I would experi-
ence the most terrible sensation that human can fall heir to, such as having
heavyweights upon you, seeing horrible animals, burglars, etc., and being
unable to get out of their reach. I have tried everything on the market that I
coaki think would be of benefit, but never struck the right remedy until I tried
Ripans Tabules, and since that time nightmare with me is a thing of the past."
I (Emphas'ze the fact, when you are talking to
scnool officers, that the veterans of the war
represent the history of Lincoln's time, and
that we offer an object lesson that will be ap
preciated by every patriotic teachej.
This day will be a memorable one in the
history of the Grand Army, ii we do our duty.
Letters are coming from a"ll parts of the coun
| try asking for full information, and we are
referring such people to the Grand Army com
rades, so every one ahoaid ba poated ou the
subject.
It is expected that a formal programme will
be shortly made out by a committee of school
principals, under the direction of Comrade
Brooks, who is chairman of the Committee on
Schools and Churches.
It is desired to lorm from amon? the ichiol
children throughout the United states a Lin
coln Monument National League, for the pur
pose of lalsing funds with which to erect a
National monument to the memory oi Abra
ham Lincoln, the same to De placed in Golden
Gate Park. Any one wishing to join may do
co by paying into the monument fund twenty,
five cents. Subscribers wilt receive a certifi
cate of membership and a league button.
Branch leagues should be formed in every
locality. TDis work is now entirely in the
hands of the Grand Army, and the monument
to be built will be in every sense a standing
testimonial of the Grand Army to the memory
of the great shining light of the nineteenth
century.
Children will be askpd to bring flowers to
their teachers for G. A. R. memorial commit
tees on Friday preceaiag Memorial day. It is
proposed on that day to ask posts of the Grand
Army throughout the whole country to detail
veterans to visit schools, and to talk to the
children on matters pertaining to the struggle
against disunion.
I shall be happy to hear from any comrade
on this subject, and also from my brother aud
sister co-workers in the schools of the State.
Fraternally, W. W. Stone,
President Lincoln Monument National League,
322 Haight street, Sau Francisco.
The oreanizera of the National League
are in constant receipt of letters com
mending the movement, and the corre
spondence indicates that many active men
a welling east of the Mississippi River will
join the people of the Paacific Coast in
this worthy and patriotic effort.
An estimate is made that $100,000 will
be required to erect such a monument as
should be raised in Golden Gate Park to
commemorate the memory of Lincoln.
There is no doubt that school children
throughout the United States will join the
league, and the interest that such enlist
ment is sure to impart will encourage
patriotic contributious from individuals
and societies independent o! the schools.
undoubtedly California will contribute
generou-ly in aid of the monument fund.
The subject will receive the attention of
trie Department Encampment of the
Grand Army, which meets in Salinas this
month. Representative men of the Loyal
Legion are reao>y to lend a help
ing hand. Colonel 8. M. B. Young,
commander of tlie legion, and Colonel J.
C. Currier, senior vice commander, com
mend the proposition. Colonel \Villiam
R, Snafter, whose nomination for com
mander of the legion to succeed Colonel
Young has already been made, is known
to be a great admirer of Lincoln.
To-day there will be a meeting of the
Lincoln monument committee to consider
the observance of Lincoln day in the pub
lic schools.

UNION STOCKYARDS. 111., April 6.-The
average qualit-' of cattle to-day was better than a
few weeks ago, there being more pretty good
beeves and fewer common lot*.
As was generally expected, tlie development of
weakness in the hoz market has caused feeders
to withhold their supply. Ihi hogs that were
bought by country shippers and held until the
roads Improved have been mostly forwarded, and
smaller supplies are looked for until prices are
marked up. The s:uallaes.t of the supply to-day
prevented a decline.
Only about 9000 head of sheep and lambs ar
rived to-day, as compared wan J4.00U last Mon
day and 12.50J a year ag i. There was a lively
demand, and prices averaged 10 to 16 cents
hlirher.

Sb.3 Declares That No Woman Should

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, April 5. )
Miss Ray Frank ot Oakland was greatly
surprised to-day when informed that she
i;aii been the innocent cause of a squabble
in a Stockton synagogue.
For a long time there has been some
dissension among the Hebrew congrega
tion at Stockton, and M. S. Jaffe, the presi
dent, has Deen drying to effect a reconcili

factory, and the members almost laid aside i
their differences, when A. S. Gottheip sent
a communication to ths newspapers, in
which be stated that Dr. Jaffe was trying
to get Miss Frank to come to the synagogue
as the regular rabbi. Mr. Gottheip quoted
fccripture to prove that a woman rabbi
was: in opposition to Mosaic law and the
breach was opened wider than ever.
Dr. Jaffe, who is a great admirer of Miss
Frank's abilities, wanted her to lecture at
the 6tockton synagogue during the Easter
holidays. But the directors voted it
down.
Aiiss Frank was seen at her home to-day
nnd said that it would be useless for Dr.
Jaffe to propose her for rabbi as sbe
â¢would r.ot accept the position. She said
she was asked to go to Stockton to heal
the breach and she believed she had suc
ceeded.
'When I left Stockton," she said, "mat
ters were very harmonious. I lectured
there and very successfully, too. Not
only was the synagogue crowded, but
much interest was shown on tbe outside.
Regarding my candidacy lor rnbbi, I
knew nothing until I saw a mention of it
in the papers. This morning I tele
graphed to Dr. Jaffe to withdraw my
name. I would not permanently accept
any pulpit, although many others have
b en offered me, and one immediately
after leaving the Theological Seminary.
I would like to hear of the appointment
of a male rabbi, and do not like to see a
woman permanently occupy any pulpit. I
was asked by the board of trustees to go to
Stockton and try to restore harmony, and
my mission was a success. I was asked
to come again, but have not made any ar
rangements for a course of lectuies."

DISTRIBUTING CIRCULARS.
A Wheelman Arrested for Doing So
Who Will Make a Test

ALAMEDA, Cal., April 5.â E. G. Wil

superintendent of the cyclery in that city,
was arrestea here yesterday on a charge
of distributing circulars on the street
without taking out a license. It appears
that vViibur came over here to see the end
of the relay race and had in his
pocket a few circulars of the institution
named. He gave out a few of them to ac
quaintances, but was told Dy an officer
that it was against the iaw to distribute
such documents on the street, though
nothing was sad about any license. Wil

with him he handed him a circular.
Thereupon the officer came up and in a
rude and boisterous manner, as Wilbur
claims, pnt him under arrest. Wilbur
told the officer he was not distributing the
circulars and that anyhow he was on pri
vate proDertv and the officer had no right
to arrest him. Nevertheless, he was ar
rested and now proposes to make a test
case of it and find out if a man can be ar
rested for handing a friend a piece of
paper, whether it be a circular or what
not.

VAL GATTER'S DISCOVERY.
When Expecting an Explosion
He Did Something That May
Mean a Fortune.
Experiments With Nitro- Glycerine
That Are Being Carefully Guarded
by the Inveitor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broailway, April 5. 1
Val Gatter, an employe at the Pinole
Powder Works, is the most surprised man
probably in the world to-day. Owing to a
mistake, which, under ordinary circum
stances, would have blown himself, com
panions and the works to atoms, he de
clares be has made a remarkable discovery.
Recently, while employed as a washer, he
made a mistake and an explosion was im
minent. In his excitement he threw into
the charge on which be was working a
substance that was at band. To his great
surprise instead of the expected crash
everything quieted down.
The next day be made an experiment
on the same line and satisfied himself that
hi- experience, though accidental, was of
great value. After several experiments
he told tbe superintendent of the matter
; and was laughed at. Gatter was in
I earnest, and waÂ« given a complete charge
upon which to use his discovery. The re
sult was all that he could hope for, and it
stool a thirty-five-minute test.
Overtures were at once made to pur
chase his secret, but Gatter refused to en
lighten anybody regarding his discovery.
One night he returned home and found
that his quarters had been ransacked
throughout, the visitors evidently hoping
that they might find something that
would afford a clew.
In their efforts to make the same dis
covery, the people at Pinole have had
their chemist at work experimenting for
several days and last weefc he nearly blew
his hands off while seeking to solve the
problem.
This discovery will allow nitro-glycerine
to stand a heat test of 160 degrees for
from fifteen to thirty-five minutes. At
present it will only stand a test of from
lour to ten minute .

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 1897.
FIRST MESSAGE OF
MAYOR THOMAS
Very Significant S'ate
ment About the
Water War.
Unless the City Buys a Plant
the Money- Losing Rivals
Will Combine.
Other Sections of the Inaugural Ad
dress D.-al With Generalities
More Than Details.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, April 5l )
Mayor Thomas submitied his inaugural
message to the City Council this evening.
There is nothing of any particular mo
ment in the message except the section
relating to water. Tlie remarks of his
Honor in this connection may justly be
regarded as significant, as they clearly
outline a policy that has not vet been
touched upon by any predecessor in the
Mayor's olHce.
There is no doubt that Mayor Thomas'
remarks regarding tbe present rate war
between water companies is destined to
have a far- reaching effect.
His message in full is as follows:
The Auditor has furnished me with an esti
mate, which is herewith transmitted, showing
the condition of the municipal funds under
the control of the Council, rs the same will
appear at the close oi the fi cal year, June 30,
1897. This report very ciearly indicates that
if all of the taxes levied for that year could be
collected, and vio expenses other than those
now authorized or absolutely necessary are
incurred between now and June 30, there will
still be a net deficit of $30 47. but the alarm
ing feature of this report is contained In the
brief statement that all of tbe taxes levied lor
that year will not be collected. Tnere Is
now due and unpaid $8900, and the Auditor
estimates that the delinquency on both in
stallments of taxes will b^ $12,000. As these
taxes, which under the laws of the State of
California will not be collected for five
years or more, the sum so delinquent must
therefore be deducted from the amount avail
able from the fund and added to ihe deficit
stated in the Auditor's report. This increases
the deficit to $12,036 47. With these figures
staring us in ihe face it is scarcely necessary
to urge "economy" as a watchword.
Happily, contracts have not teen definitely
made wiih respect to nil of the expenditures
authorized by your predecessors, and it is
therefore possible to ho d in abeyance some
of the proposed improvements, uuiil the con
dition of the municipal treasury justifys their
further consideration.
The neglect since 1882 to adequately provide
for the redemption of the bo i.ls known as
"The Redemption Bonds of 1882," has fortu
nately resulted in no serious Injury to the
municipality up to the present time. These
bonds, amounting to $140,000, should b;
called in at once. The necessary mm misht
be raised by tax levy by April 1, 1898, and the
outstanding bonds retired, bu such a course,
involving as it would an increase in the tax
leyy of 31 cents on ihe $100, would be neither
wise nor just.
There it another and more prudential
method for adjusting this question, which is
submitted for your consideration.
The refunding of these bonds was duly
authorized at a special election held August
31,1895. By an act of the late Legislature,
there has been provided a plalu method 01
procedure in lespect 10 such transactions, and
the Council should, in my judgment, imme
diately proceed under the power now vested
in it to accomplish this end. Toe acts and
powers of the Council to nx the length of time
tor which such bond* should. run, not to
exceed forty yearsâ bonds running
twenty year* â would, in my judgment, meet
wiin the approval of tna tax-payers and be
acceptable as will to purchasers of bonds.
Tne Legislature has also enacted a statute
providing for she destruction of unsold bonds,
and your attention is directed to the fact that
there are $140,000 of this city's bonds remain
in;; unsold, because of the uncertain legality
of their issue, which should be destroyed as
provided by this statute.
â WATER.
Municipal ownership of water works Is, In
my judgment, destined to become a fixed
polity in America. The conditions prevailing
in this city in respect to our water supply is
most curious and unnatural. That it will
continue is contradicted by reason and exDo
rience. Two water companies struggling for
supremacy are engaged In a rate war which
nas brought about a reduction to the con
sumer unparalleled in our State's history.
Both of these corporations claim to be suffer
lug great losses iv money at prevailing rates.
This statement may be accepted as true, but it
is equally true tnat these losses, whatever
they may be, will ultimate. find their way
into the bonded indebtedness of the com
panies, and the consumer will be compelled
10 pay not only interest on the present fosses,
but eventually the principal as well. Indi
viduals may quarrel forever, out It is a law of
property unwritten, but irrevocable, that hos
tile moneyed interests invariably prefer to
bury their hatreds and come together for joint
profit at the public's expense, rather than suf
fer continued losses.
In the nature of things these corporations
must consolidate, or both be absorbed by a
newer or stronger corporation. When that
day comes this city and the Oakland water
consumers will likely be at war again with
on: water company. Such a prospect is not
inviting, but it seems inevitable, indeed, high
rates are and must be the natural sequence to
prevailing conditions. Prudence urges me to
suggest that the question of municipal owner
ship receive at us early a date as possible your
careful and earnest attention. Nothing, of
course, can be done without submission of the
question to the people, but preliminary steps
may be taken by the Council that will be of
incalculable benefit. Perhaps a delegation of
representative citizens can be found who may
be induced 10 go to the bottom if the ques
tion. , As Mayor of the city and as a private
citizen, I would be pleased to act in any
capacity that would give the subject research
and investigation. This subject is one which
should be seriously considered and discussed
by the public ana the press, as well as by your
selves.
STREETS.
Standing at the threshold of my official life
it would be presumption la attempt to outline
a complete and tnorough review of this most
important : branch of our government. It is
certain, however, that repairs should be kept
up with unremitting zeal and diligence unless
the vast sums of money heretofore expended
bo practically wasted ana go lor naught
Meanwhile we should proceed rapidly but
cautiously with street Improvements. Prop
erty-owners should come to realize that
modern improvements and material advance
ment in realty values are only possiole along
well-paved streets. Many of our citizens are
deeply interested in good roads Â»nd have
given to this subject much study and research.
It is my purpose to avail myself of this infor
mation, and embody such suggestions as ex
perience may approve in a future message.
PARKS.
Our city is not blessed with a great park, but
such as we have are a matter of continued and
increasing expense. In my judgment we
should set about to procure from some ski.hu!
specialist a plat of each of the city's parks, ac
companied by a distinct and defiuite plnn for
future improvements. Such a proceeding
would inject something of method into our
park expenditures and appropriations here
after made wood go toward thÂ« consumma
tion of a specific, definite and permanent im
provement sccording to tae accepted plan
Haphazard expenditures, sugitestet by caprice
or by a passing desire to do something for a
ward, are not productive of tangible or satis
factory results. The above plan is therefore
suggested for consideration.
WATEB FRONT.
Our duty with respect to the water front
litigation is so plain that It scarcely needs
pointing out. Our case rests with Â«he courts
and la in the bands of eminent and able at
torneys.
To falter in pushing our claims to this yreat
property would not only be cowardice, but
contemptible and unforgivable treachery as
well. We are pledged as citizens and public
officers to maintain the stand taken by our
predecessors and it is our bounden du:y to
foriifv our legal counselor, aud ever be pre
pared to maintain and defend our right to vie
courts of last resort.
In all matters pertaining to labor or public
improvement, great care thould be exercised
lhat snch employment as the City has to give
goes to citizens of Oakland. This should be a
fundamental ruie for onr guidance, and so Jar
as the matter lies within my power, citizen*
of Oakland shall in ail cases have the prefer
ence in the public work Â«.f this municipality.
Gentlemen, in conclusion, let me â *Â» that
my policy as i he chi-f executive <>t this city
shall always be for harmony. Your advice
and your counsel will ever bi welcome, for,
after ali. we are to a great ex'.etC dependent
upon each other, and must share whatever of
censure, of commendation our constituents
may visit upon us for our nets.

Who la the Boss?
OAKLAND, Cal., April s.â The Dis
trict Attorney n. s been a-ked by the Su
pervisors to decide who shall control the
Websier-street drawbridge. One of the
bridge-tenders is appointed by the South
ern Pacific Company, the other by the
county. Recently there has been mnch
conflict between the men as to who
should be dobs. One would say, "We will
open tne bridge before the train comes
and let the schooner throueh"; and the
other would say, "Let us permit the train
to pass and then open the bridge." The
two men cannot agree, and the District
Attorney will have to decide which is the
boss and which is the inferior.
By the City Council.
OAKLAND, Cal., April s.â At the meet
ing of the City Council to-night F. R.
Girard made an effort to have city ex
penses reduced by offering a resolution
abolishing the office of Assistant CiiyAttor
nÂ«?y. On motion of Councilman Heitman
the resolution sa< indefinitely postponed.
Girard also opposed the motion to raise
the salary of Assistant Superintendent of
Streets Ayres from $100 to $125 per month,
but failed to carry his point.
An appropriation of $1000 was made for
the improvement of engine house 2.
The annual taxes of the world aggregate
the enormous sum of Â£870,000,000.
BRISK CAMPAIGN
IN BERKELEY
First Effort to Organize
the Republican
Party.
Lively Contest Between the Two
Candidates for the 0 fice of
Town Marshal.
The Fight for Town Clerk Locked to
for Demonstration of the Strength
of the Parties.
BERKELEY, Cal., April s âThe com
ing week, the last before the local elec
tion is decided, promises to be one of
lively politics. The main interest in the
fights of candidates is absorbed ov the
Schmidt-L!oyd racÂ« for the office of Mar
shal, which has developed into a bitter
personal war in which the records of the
two men are being discussed and attacked
with a good deal of asperity by their re
spective opposers.
Schmidt is the regular Republican nom
inee and has the indorsement of the Peo-
Four Men Who Will Take a Prominent Part in Berkeley's Coming
Election*
pie's party, and his friends claim for him
a good majority in the whole town and a
very large margin in the West End. Bets
have been offered that in the seven wards
the Republicans will have a clear majority
of 2CO votes. The Republicans base their
claims on the fact that they are in an
overwhelming majority and on the per
sonal popularity of their man.
On the other hand the Non-Partisans
are macing a strong canvass for Richard
Lloyd, the present incumbent. Their
right is put up on the proposition of con
tinuing non-partisanisrr. in local affairs.
In that respect the present campaign is a
unique one in the history of Berkeley.
The Republican party has never been or
ganized locally before the commencement
of this campaign. At that time the Berke
ley Republican Club amalgamated and
declared in favor of a party ticket. It was
argued that as the citizens of the town are
Republican in such proportion that Dem
ocrats and Populists are almost without
organization, tte Republicans should as
sume the responsibility of conducting
municipal administrations. All the party
clubs united on the proposition ana the
present ticket is the result.
Then came the opposition. It began in
the Good Government Club, an organiza
tion of leading citizens pledged to keep
partisanship out of Berkeley politics and
to watch town government. The club ha 3
over 100 members. Through the efforts
of its leaders and the party managers
amalgamation of the forces* of the two
non-partisan parties â the Non-Partisans
and the Independent Taxpayers â was ef
fected.
Thp lictit as it now stands is between
the Republican Clubs and the Good Gov
ernment Club and its non-partisan fol
lowers. The Republicans are char ed
with being naught but a gang of office
seekers by their opponents, wnile they
retort that the Good Government
Club is controlled by Democrats, and thus
the fight goes merrily on.
The issue of Republican control or non
partisanship in local affairs is so obscured,
however, and the two tickets are so mixed
that in only one or two cases wili there be
any real test of the public sentiment on
the question. The Schmidt-Lloyd affair
is an old feud, T. ey have encountered
each other before in a contest for office
in Berkeley, victory perching on tne ban
ner of the present Republican candidate.
For the offices of Town Trustees, School
Directors and library trustees the as
pirants named by both parties are largely
the same. In the case of the Town Clerk
the issue is clear cut as nearly as can be,
and there is much speculation* as
to the outcome. M. L. Hanscom, the in
cumbent, is on the Non-Partisan ticket
opposed to J. C. Sberratt, Republican
nominee.
Both men have many friends and both
have made a friendly, quiet contest for
the place, each being admittedly compe
tent, so that the question for decision is
really Republicanism against Non-Parti
sanship. Messrs. Hanscom and Shorratt
The fac-simile XT^ s/tf/r. * ~ *â  on c v e *7 wrapper
signature of â  ;; XSut&ff7<c&itf& .of CASTORIA. .
both declined the Populist nomination
on account of the platform that party
adopted.'
The present administration boards and
town officers are also an issue in the cam
paign. Tje Good Government Club fac
tion has deciured its emphatic Indorse
ment of the Board of Trustees now in
office and of the incumbent executives,
while the Republicans have vigorous com
plaints to make. They demand economy,
and charce reckless expenditure in the
creation of such offices as the assistant
superintendent of streets.
The People's party and the Prohibition
ists also have tickets in the field, the for
mer especially making a vigorous cam
paign. They are holding mass-meetings
in all pans of town and iheir speakers are
vigorous and eloquent in denunciation of
the government tiiat now hods sway over
the town. The Prohibitionists did not
nane executive officers, confining their
nominations to trustees and library di
rectors.
The coming week may see some lively
developments in the dispute over what
shall go on the official ballots.
It is now said that efforts will be made
to secure authoritative lesjal declaration
that the non-partisan parties have no
standing. It is declared by some Repub
licans that, as the parlies in question were
not in the tieia in the !ate county, State
and ISational elections, they have no
riÂ»ht on ballots ihis time without the re
quired petition lor new parties. The non
partisans have not filed any such petition,
relying upon the fact that they polled
over 2 per cent, the required proportion of
the votes of the town, at the last local
election.
Annexatlonists Will Be Correct.
OAKLAND, Cal., April s.â The annexa
tion committee have decided that, to
avoid all possible legal objections, they will
prepare a new petition to submit to the
Council. In the amended document there
will be no possibility of error, as it will be
submitted to attorneys before canvassing
for signatures.

Mrs Eeiser of Washington Gives Oak
land Ladies a Surprise With Her
Adv-nc d Ideas
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 5. J
Many ladies of this city were surprised
last evening <v the information conveyed
by Mrs. Anna May Keiser, who is knowu
all over the Northwest as the woman mine
owner.
Mrs. Keiser took unon herself some time
ago to organize an immense mining com
pany, consisting of 2,000,000 shares, and
she declares that success is in sight, and
that it differs from all men's associations
because none of the officers are receiving a
cent of salary, nor will they do so until
dividends are declared.
Mrs. Keiser cougratulated the many
ladies present at Shasta Hall upon the ad
vancement made by the.r sex in the field
of mining. She described the work being
accomplished by the Woman's Mining
Bnreau of Washington and said it was
their intention to extend the work into
California.
"Oar venture is owned and controled by
women," she said, "and is wholly a
woman's enterprise. At the present time
we control and own five immense proper
ties in the conduct of which we seek no
advice from men. These mines are not
bonded, but are our own property. Our
stock Is so pooled that it cannot be placed
on the market until our affairs are on a
diyidend-payin* basis. Three of our
mines nave sufficient ore in sight to keep
them going, and we have no need to a^-Jc
for assessments. There are no salaried
officers and thove of us, ail women, who
are devoting our time and energy to the
interets of the enterprise feel that the
increase in the v.-.lue of our stock and the
certainty of forthcoming; dividends will
be ample remuneration for our time ana
money.
"There will also be a compensation
which cannot be measured by material
considerations. It is the supreme sa is
faction of proving that women are capable
01 manipulating large business affairs
with that wisdom, honor and discretion
which will be an honor to our sex. We
are not men-haters, bat are co-worker?
who wish to emulate their example by
systematic business methods, duly appre
ciating their many favors and intending
wherever pos-ibie to improve on the metb
o is of our brethren."

to Meet.
Chances of a Fistic Display by

The National Club Will Hold Its Next
Show at the Peop.t's
P.ilace.
The National Club will give a boxing
entertainment on Friday evening in the
People's Palace, corner of Mason and
Eddy streets.
The feature of the show will be a fitteen
round boxing contest between Jim Jef
fries, the champion heavy-weight pugilist
of Los Angeles, wbo put in two weeks in
the Corbeit camp at Carson boxing with
the ex-champion, and Theodore Van Bus
kirk of the Olympic Club, who was one of
Professor Walter Watson's pupils.
Jeffriea will have considerable advan
tage in weight, but otherwise the men are
said to be evenly matched. Van Â±susÂ£irk
has improved considerably in boxing in
the past year, and his friends are of the
opinion that lie wilt whip the Los Angeles
man handily, as Jeffries leaves hit faco
open to attack. But there are many
sports wno can see only one rnau in the
contest, and he represents the City of
Angels.
The sports contend that the experience
Jeffries had while boxing with Corbett is
belter than two years' tuition unuer some
slow teacher, consequently they will play
him to win. It is uoubtful if the bout
will last more than four rounds. The
other attractions are Henry Slater and
Homer McCoy, ten rounds: Ed Morriaey
and bani Maxwell, ten rounds. The
prices of admission are reasonable, and
as a consequence the managers of the
show expect to see a good crowd present.
George Green in rusticating at Glen
Ellen, and although saying but little con
cerning his future he is nevertheless tak
ing excellent care of himself and training
daily. Green, according to Colonel Harri
son of the Mervin Hotel, is one of the
most export fish-eaters in the country,
and when hungry after a ten or twenty
miles' jog through the country he thinks
nothing of gourmandizing 100 six-inch
trout at a bitting. It is no wonder, then,
that George is a brainy tallow, who wins
battles by a display 01 good judgment.
Nothing has been heard from Tommy
Ryan of late and the secretary of the
Olympic Club has come to the conclusion
that the Eastern welter-weight has no
use for Green since George whipped
"Mysterious" Billy Smith so handily in
Carson.
THE ANCIENT WORKMEN
The Grand Lodge Delegates Will
Meet in Convention This
Morning.
An Attempt Will Re Made to Hava

The annual convention of the Grand Lodge
of the Ancient Order of United Workmen of
the jurisdiction of California will be held in
B'nal B'rith Hall on Eddy street this morning,
commencing at 10 o'clock.
. The committee on credentials will meet an
hour earlier in the same building for the pur
pose of passing upon the certificates of the
delegates trom the various portions of the
State. As there will be some important legit*
lation to be transacted by the grand body, It
is likely that there will' be a full representa
tion of delegates to represent the 304 lodges.
There seem* ! to be a I general ' awakening til
along the line,- and lodges which have been dor
mant for many -ears are giving pronounced signs
of coming activity. - - ; ...
During the year 1898 a greater number of lodges
show initiations than during any year for seven
or eight, years previous and .he outlook for 1897
is still mure encouraging, and all Indications point
to a wooderfu.ly increased membership by the Ist
of January, 1898. these conditions are attributed
to the new plan of c as -Hied assessments and the
liercu can work performed -by the ; Grand Lodge
officers since the adopt. on of me ciasslfi-d plan.
- The grand master workman and grand overseer
have visited a' large number of lodges, and the
deputy grand master workman has been busy vis- -
icing and Instituting lodges. 9 The grand . recorder
has devoted a large amount of time to the expla
nation or the new system, both in public ad
cresses and In editorial wort for ihe daily papers
and the official organ of the order j The grand re
ceiver has made many visitations Â»nd has ren
dered valuable assistance In the forwaid move
men;. One of the mos. efficient we rkers for the
cause has been the grand lecturer, who has made a
large number of vsitai;ms and has instructed
lodges in the ritualistic and. secret work, with,
which he Is entirely familiar. - . ' . ; . .-.
A number of Fast | Grand Master Workmen,
among, whom can be mentioned William H. Jor
flan. James Booth, F. Adams William H. Barnes,
J. T. Rogers and J. N. Young, have rendered
great assistance. ' .. ;.' Â ."";.- /'â â  /'._ ;.,â¢'â *
- Kvery hope is expressed that after the meeting
of the Urand .Lodge there will be such a decided"
movement in tne Workmen circles in California
that all previous effor s wlil be eclipsed. '.'â¢ 'â ;
' Among the matters that are to come before the
Grand Lodge will be the bo. dins; of. biennial in
stead of annual sessions, as it Is believed mat the
$5000 which ii costs to hod a session can be used
to better advantage. An effort will be made to
reduce the fees of the grand medical examiner
from 50 to -25 cents. Tha". If carried will, a is ex
pected, effect a saving of #110 j a year. Â An effort I
wilt also be made 'to raise Hie per capita tax to
$2 60. and there is a muvement todo away with
the official oman on the ground Â»f economy. Ihe ?
movement,' however, is not popular with the mem
bers, â¢ who . are anxious that lc should be main
tamed, for It is. a popular piece or literature for
them, containing all the official vrders.*, â  Â '"'â â¢ -..:_.
It is expected that supreme Master Workman

THE DOUBLE
APPEARED
TOO LATE
Sensational Story Follow
ing on Butler's De
parture.
FLANS OF ESCAPE OUT
LINED.
A Quondam Brother Named
Reardon Mentioned in
the Plot.
SOME LEITEE3 THAT : OLD
ALL.
Their Resemblance Said to Hive
Suggested a Desperate Chance
for Liberty.
The man from Cloverdale who when ar
rested on Drumm street on Friday night,
March 26, for being drunk, gave the
name of John J. Reardonj was one of the
most interested spectators at the Pacific
Mail dock Saturday when Butier, tlie
Australian murderer, was escorted on
board the Marlposa by Marshal Baldwin
and Deputy Marshal Gallagher.
It will be remembered that on the
morning after Reardon's arrest his ex
traordinary resemblance to Butler startled
Detective Bainbridge and Corooral Gei
mann when they saw him standing among
the "drunks" in the City Prison.
Ihe two officers were so amazed by the
resemblance tiiat they took Reardon to
Captain Lees' oflicc. and the captain nearly
fell off his chair with astonishment, think
ing that Butler had by some unheard-cf
means escaped from the County Jail.
Chief Crowley was equally surpris3d and
others who saw Reardon accosted him as
Butler.
Reardon appeared to willingly consent
to sit for his photograph, aDd laughingly
asked the favor of having a copy, as he
had not been photographed for many
years. He never called for it and he had
a good reason for not doing so.
Reardon said he was born in Ireland in
1834 and came to this country when a
boy. He fought through the war and
ultimately came to this coast and worked
as a longshoreman about ten years ago.
Then he went to the country and bad
been there since.
When arrested he cave his age as 40, and
lie certainly looted more like 40 than 63.
When this was pointed out to him he was
confused for a moment and then re
marked that he had taken good care of
himself. Another thing was pointed out
to him. He gave the name of Daniel
Iteardon when arrested, but next morn
ing when asked what was his Christian
name he said "John J." He was again
confused when told ha had given the
name of Daniel and put it off by saying
that he was drunk and didn't know what
he was doing.
Detective Bainbridze, whose remark
able faculty for remembering faces is so
invaluable to the department, has re
marked several times since that notwith
standing Reardon's name and nationality
he must be a blood relation of Butler.
And according to Reardon'3 own con
fession Bain bridge is right.
Reardon and Butler are Drothers, and
their true surname is Ashe, Butler being
Richard Ashe and Reardon John J. Ashe.
Behind that is the story of a plot con
cocted by ihe Australian murderer to
make his escape from the City Prison
witn the assistance of his brother, aided
by the extraordinary resemblance between
them.
A gentleman of the utmost integrity,
but whose abhorrence of notoriety pre
vents his name from being made public,
is the authority for the statement of the
relationship between the two and the de
tails of the plot.
"I was anxious to eet a last glimpse of
Butler," he said to a Call reporter yester
day, "and went down to the Mail dock
Saturday afternoon.
"I had read the story of the two Dro
mios in The Call about a week before
with the picture o! Bntler and his double.
While walking around I noticed a man
standine aloof from the crowd with a roll
of blankets strapped across his back.
"I tooK a good look at him, and hi? re
markable rtsemblance to Butler at once
struck me and 1 jumped to the conclusion
that he was Butler's double.
"My curiosity led me to speak to the
man, and I asked him if he was waiting to
have ft look at Butler. He replied tl-at he
was, and I commented on his resemblance
to the murderer.
" 'You were the man that wa3 arrested
for being drunk and the policemen thought
was so like But.er, aren't you,' I asked,
and he rather reluctantly admitted that
hÂ« was the man.
"We chatted for a few minutes and as I
found h;rn an interestinx talker I took
him across to a saloon and we had three
rir.nks. HedranK whisky and I had beer.

JOHN J. REARDON. Who Says He Is Butler's Brother.
The whisky loosened his tongue and I
asked him bluntly: 'Now is it not a fact
that you and Butler are related to each
other? I have a curiosity to know, and as
he is going back to Australia to suffer the
penalty for his crime there can be no
harm in telling me.'
"To my surprise he admitted that But
ler was his brother, and that he came to
the City from the mountains in Sonoma
County at his request. To my eager
questions this was what he told me as
near as I can recollect:
" 'Richard Ashe is my brother's true
name and we are natives of England. He
is between four and five years younger
than I. I left home when I was about 13
years of a c and have never returned, so
that I have not seen nor heard of my
brother for nearly thirty years. When
we were children we looked exactly like
each other and wo have apparently kept
it up.
"For a number of years I have been
working in the mines and on ranches in
this State, and while in the mountains of
Sonoma County 1 saw a San Francisco
paper in which there was an account of
the arrest of Butler, alias Richard Ashe,
for the murders in Australia. The name
Richard Ashe and tne uicture in the pa
per made me wonder if it was my broiher.
"I wrote him a letter to the City Prison,
telling him who I was aad asking him 'O
let me know if he was my brother. Tnat
was about the middle of February. I did
not go to the postoffice for about a month,
and found a letter wailing for me. It had
been there lot about two weeks. I opened
it, and sure enough :t was from the brother
I had not seen or heard of for nearly thirty
years.
"He implored me to come to the City
an l try to save him. Here is the letter;
you can read it for yourself.' 1
"I at once recognized Butler's hand
writing from what I hnd seen of it in the
newspapers," continued the gentleman,
"and that confirmed f>r me the truth of
the man's story. I wantei to get pos
session of it. so that it could have been
published, and offered him $1 10, all ihe
money I had in my pocket, for it, but he
said he would not part with it for $1000,
as it was the rir3t and would probably De
the last he would receive from him.
"The letter spoke of family affairs, men
tioning the place or tueir birth, which I
am sorry to say I have forgot, and then
went on to speak of the disgrace to the
family if he were hanged for murder. '
Then he went on to urge his brother to :
come to the City at once and try to save i
him, as it was his last ray of hoDe. He j
described the interior of the City Prison, i
that the first cell was where women were
kept, then there was No. 2, and next to ]
No. 2 was the cell in whith lie was con- j
fined. He wrote that every morning about i
6 o'clock he was allowed to leave his cell
to go to the sink at the end of the prison
to wash his face and hands, and about the
same time the drunk cell was opened and
the 'drunks' put outside, so that the j
prison-keeper and the trusties could re- I
move the bedding and washout the cell.
"The scheme detailed in the letter was
for his brother to come to the City, get '
drunk and be arrested. He was to shave
himself leaving the inch of closely cropped i
side whiskers on each side of his face, and i
instructions were given as to how ho I
should dress himself. Then in the morn
ing when Butler went to wash himself he |
would wait till the 'drunks' came out of
their cell and he would take his brother's
place among the 'drunks,' his brother to
walk on to his cell and quietly lie down
until he was disturbed. By tnat time
Butler would have been discharged along
with the other 'drunks' and at liberty.
"Butler ingenuously wrote that his.' i
brother could easily prove his identity
and could say that he walked into his i
(Butler's) cell by mistake. I wish I could '
have memorized the exact words of the
letter, but that was in effect what it 3 con- i
tents were, and I was amazed at the in
genuity of the scheme. *
"Butler's brother then told that as soon
as he could he came to the City and at
once filled up wkh water-front whisky,
and was arrested. When he was talien to
the City Prison he looked into the cell j
where nis brother wrote that he was con- :
fined, but he was not there. When the
'drunks' were ordered out he looked
everywhere, but could find no one who re
sembled his brother, and it was not till
Detective Bainbridire and Corporal Ger
mainn spoke to him that he learned his
brother had been removed to the County
JaiL He had not seen any paper from
the time he wrote to his brother, and
therefore did not know that he had been
taken from the prison. He spoke to no
body about it, as the resemblance to each
other might have been noticed, ana that
was also why he cave the name of Rear
don and said that he was born in Ire
land. ' ' : â¢ .
"After listening to this extraordinary
story I asked him if he uad gone to the
County Jail to see his brother and he said
he had been afraid, as the police iiad
taken his picture and he was su-spicious
tie might be arrested.
"I a^ain pressed upon him to give me
the letter, but he refused and said all the
money in the world wouldn't buy it. He
said he would return to ti:e mountains as
soon as he got a look at his brother, and
as I had business to attend to uptown I
had to leave him, but gave tne dollar to
help him oq kis way back.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 189"?.
"1 felt sorry for the poor fellow and I
suppose he opened his heart to me from
the way I taiked to him. I firmly believe
he was telling me the truth, and although
I am not an expert on handwriting I will
swear the letter was written by Butler,
at least if what I saw in the newspapers
was his.
"There was no envelope, but he had the
letter folded in a piece of newspaper. I
dul not ask him his posiollice address, but
it is in Sonoma County, as he told me
that was where he was working."
Butler was arrested on the Swanhilda
on February 2 and was removed to the
County Jail on March 17, as he had at
tempted to end his life.
Victor Wolff, another prisoner, was
placed in the ceil with him in the prison
for several days before his removal and
he told Wo'ff that one of his best chances
of escape was when he was allowed to go
to the sink to wash himself. The prison
keeper and "trusties" were then busy
with the "drunk?," and it would be easy
for him to knock down the prison-keeper,
seize the key of the prison door and make
his escape.
He was probably thinking of what he
had written to his brother when he talked
to Woiff about that means of escape.
FOSTER'S CAUSTIC REPLY
Denies AH Charges of Misman
agement and Discrim
ination.
M.kes a Pointed Suggestion lo the
Large Land-Owners of Mann
County.
On behalf o? the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway, President A. W.
Foster yesterday filed with the Railroad
Commissicn the answer of that company
to the complaint of J. S. McCue.
McCue's charges are indicated in this
answer. The document denies "that by
mismanagement of its business its in
terest has been injured or the prosperity
of any citizen ( f M.irin County retarded ;
; or that it makes any unlawful discrimina
: tion in the priCe of commutation tickets
1 between men and women, or that there is
| no reason why this company cannot make
| Its business as prosperous as that of the
i railroad companies operating in Alameda
j County, or that this defendant is respon
sible for the country between Sausalito
and San Rafael being a series of cow
I rancnes."
The answer further "avers that J. S.
| McCue is neither a resident cf (san Rafael
i nor oi any other station on the road of this
company, nor a pairon of said road in any
: particular. "
President Foster then makes a novel
point, as follows:
The first demand of petitioner is that your
: honorable board nrrange the by
which trains should be run, so that the trains
of this company sball alternate with thote of
the other railroad company cited to appeiir
I heroin. It is respectfully submitted that this
would in effect require you to mnke the lnde
! pendent railroad companies divide or pool
i their traffic, which i.s illegal and against the
j best interest of this company and the public.
In conclusion lie asks that the complaint
i of the petitioner be dismissed, and makes
i a pointed suggestion to Marin County
j land-owners, as fo.lows:
The petitioner, in stating his case, has
omitted to say that the present service or this
company ministers to a country which will be
a material assistance to this company when
the present owners of land feel disposed, as
they are not now, to place their land on the
market, instead of maintaining it as they
do nt present, simply as a dairy country. This
company would bo greatly p:ea-ed and bene
j lited to have the owners of land between
! Tiburon am! i^an Kafa>.-1, who now refuso to
: sell n. sinple lot, place their land upon the
j market and thereby assist this company to at
i least earn the taxes paid by it upon it's right
1 of way through such section.
The hearine of this case will be had
before the Railroad Commission on
April 14.

DYING NOTES
OF "THE LARK"
The Author of "The Purple
Cow" Sings for the
Last Time.
Publisher Doxey Says the Little
Magazine Has Help?d West
ern Writers.
The Names of the Anonymous Con
tributors Will Soon Be Given
to the Public.
The last issue of the Lark will appear
to-day. Tile characteristic feature is a
picture of "The furple Cow," which made
Editor Burgess famous. The cartoon is a
caricature of the editor, drawn on the
lines of his "goopB," and something like
his wonderful "Chewing-gum Man."
The following is the announcement con
veying news that tne paper is to be no
more:
With this number the second book of the
Lark is completed, and the further issuance of
the Lark is suspended. There will, however,
be publibhed an Epilark, or Memoir, contain
ing certain phases of the intimate history of
the Lark, with reflections thereon. The Epi
lark will also contain a table of contents of the
second book of the Lark disclosing the au
thorship of the articles which have appeared
anonymously duriug the yeor.
One of the features of the Epilark will
be the disclosure of the names of those
who wrote various articles that have at
tracted attention during the year.
The current number contains the fol
lowing characteristic poem by Bruce Por
ter, which, is the poetic feature of the
issue:
Ptill to be sure or the Dawn-
Still to be glnd for the SeÂ»â
Htiil to know fire of the blood:
Ood keep these gifts In me!
Thenâ t shall cleave the dark!
Then, I shall breast the redoubt,!
Then i shall Glory the Lordâ
And go down to the grave
With a shout!
William E. Doxey, the publisher of the
Lark and other literary novelties, thinks
the little publication that is just ending
its career has done much to pave tb.B way
for Calilornia writers.
'â¢Only two or three years ago," said Mr.
Doxey yesterday, "it was almost impossi
ble to get an Eastern critic to look at any
thing that came from the West. It is

POLSOM-STEEET PAVEMENT.
Concrete Work Not So Bad as Was at
Firm Thought.
Last week a report was runde that the
work on Folsom street was poorly per
formed and that the concrete had been
cut to pieces so as to be of little use for a
foundation for the bitumen pavement
that was to be plsced tnereon. At the re
quest of Mayor Phelan the work was re
examined yesterday by Ernest McCul
lough, the consulting civil encineer to the
Mayor. Mr. McCullourli presented the
following report to Mayor Phelan:
Wo took up several pieces of the foundation,
and found tbem to be six inches in thickness,
except where the teams had been permitted to
travel over the work. 1 believe that where
the material was less than five or six inches
thick it was due to the teaming and also to the
standing of horses lor long periods in one
place and consequent pawing ol the street.
Wnere I lound iteany to penetrate on Friday
was in phices where the foundation was well
worn and loosened by travel.
But the concrete was four weeks down, and
had uot set nearly as weli as it should havo
done in that time. This may have been owing
partly to the weather and partly to the cement.
But it is as good a job as the greater part of
street foundations in this City.
My previous report was based on the surface
indications, which are very bad, and make the
street look more like a macadamized street
than a concrete foundation for bitumen. The
incident, however, is of value, as it shows a
few changes are required in the methods of
doing street work in this city. In the first
place, contractors should te permitted to lay
only one side of a street at a time; and. sec
ondly, the side out of use should be barri
caded ana an ordinance pasted to prevent
any one destroying the barricade or using the
street until the concrete has set. Had
this been done on Foisom street there would
hitve been nothing iv the appearance ol the
foundation to attract attention. Folsomstreet
has hud extremely heavy travel on the ex
po>-ed concrete foundation, and it took a test
like that of this moraine to show that it was
all right.
"It seems," said Mayor Phelan, "that
the con;ractors are the parties who are
guilty of neglect in not properly protect
ing the work. The Superintendent of
Streets had called their atiention to it and
planks were laid to protect it, but subse
quently removed by the contractors be
cause the people of the neighborhood took
them away. The work will now ba done
properly, because this office and the Su
perintendent of Streets ara in thorough
accord. I desire to exonerate the Super
intendent of Streets from any impiied
blame."
Mayor Phelan explained the matter of
the investigation of tne concrete before
the meeting of the Supervisors. He stated
that the Superintendent of Street* had
not been derelict in his duty, but had been
more tnan usually vigilant in watching
the work. The fault lay, he said, with the
contractors, who had failed to protect the
concrete after it was laid.
WADE IS WANTED.
The Â£x- Assistant Secretary of the Board
of Education in Trouble.
Frank A. Gardner, a money-broker,
swore to a complaint in Judge Low's
court yesterday, charging George W.
Wade, ex-assistant secretary of the Board
of Education, with obtaining money by
false pretenses.
The complaint alleges that on August
24 last "Wade went, to Gardner, and on the
representation tnat he would Oe entitled

Necessary for Its Comple
tion Subscribed.
The boulevard fund lacks just $99 25 of
the $18,000 necfc?sary to complete the fund
required to finish the great Balboa
rosd. Of the sum already subscribed
$8571 40 has been paid for labor, and the
labor has all been done by the "unem
ployed."
The hauling of macadam to coat the
roadway has commenced, and it will not
be lone before the work of macadamizing
will be begun on each sido of the twenty
foot layer in the center. While all the
crading ha 3 been practically completed,
there is an immense till and a heavy eat
lo be disposed of, and the work on these
alone will consume hundreds of dollars.
This work, together with the macadam
izing will take far mure funds than all
that 13 to be spent in grading. Three
tramway tra ins of four cars each were put
on yesterday to carry earth to the big till.
It will take at least 50.C00 yards of earth
and sand to complete it.

CLOSE CALL FOR
CHIEF CROWLEY
Ptomaine Poison Lurked in
the Luscious Oyster
That He Ate.
Violent Sickness of the Stomach
and Intense Pain Caused
Alarm.
For Several Hours the Patient Was in
a Critical Conditioi, but Is Now
Out of Danger.
Patrick Crowley, Chief of Police, had a
close call Sunday night, and came very
nearly retiring from office without the
consent of the Board of Police Com
missioners.
he was feeling so well Saturday evening
just before going home that he fancied
a dish of oysters would agree with him.
Accordingly ne entered a restaurant down
town and was served witb oysters. When
he reached home and went to bed he was
all right, but early Sunday morning he
was seized by a violent sickness of the
stomach. So treat and alarming was his
distress that hi 3 physician, Dr. Keeney,
was summoned. The doctor, noting the
symptoms and ascertaining what the Chief
nad been eating, pronounced the sickness
a case of ptomaine poisoning. The poison
is produced by a slight decomposition
resulting from chemical changes, and
when admitted to the stomach causes
intense pain and distress.
For several hours the Chief was in a
critical condition, and subsequently suf
ferred so much mat he obtained no sleep
Sunday night.
Last evening he was much better and
considered out of danger, but, on the ad
vice of his physician, the Chief was not
allowed to receive callers. Perfect, un
disturbed repose was what the physicians
prescribed, and the ladies of the family
carried out the orders of the medicaldirec
tor and permitted no one outside of the
family- circle to see the patient.
It was stated that, owing to the Chief's
excellent health and perfi ct physical con
dition, his system responded io the medi
cine administered, nnd, tnerefore, his re
covery may be speedy.

white chiffon.

gation for Further Argument.
Judge J. M. Seawell of the Superior
Court has reopened the Effie V. R. Hol
strorn guardianship case, and will hear
further argument in regard to the mat
ter.
Judge Seawell filed A written opinion
saying that he is not entirely satisfied
with the conclusions reached by him in
granting the guardianship to Mrs. Lu
cinda Holstrom, the foster-mother of iha
child. The Judge remarks that on ac
count of the press of other lititration and
ihe urgent desire of the temporary guard
ian to be relieved of her charge, prac
tically no argument was presented on be
half of Mrs. d'Artenay, mother of the
minor.
The permanent welfare of the child is
the paramount question to be decided,

tne full consideration to which it is enti
tled it is deemed essential to hear further
argument. Next Friday morning has
been set for the argument.
