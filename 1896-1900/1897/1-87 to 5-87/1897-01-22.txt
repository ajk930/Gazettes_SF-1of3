FREEDOM IS
THE DEMAND
Upon No Other Terms Will
the Cubans Cease to
Battle.
NO FAITH IN PROMISED
REFORMS.
General Palma Says That Spain
Acts in a Spirit of Weakness,
Not Leniency.
'.0 THE PATRIOTS WILL FIGHT
TO A FINISH.
If Autonomy Is Accepted the Future
of the Island Will Be Ruin
and Starvation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 2Lâ General
T. Estrada Palma of the Cuba Junta in
this city issued the following statement
to-day:
"So much lately has been said of the
probability of the termination of the
Cuban revolution by the acceptance on
the part of the Cubans of autonomy or
reforms tbat I feel it incumbent on me, as
the accredited representative of the
Cubans, to ma_e a brief statement on the
Bubject. Resolutions were passed by the
Spanish Cortes. Dut the outbreak of this
revolution was not stayed one hour.
There was and is but one idea for which
the Cubans are fighting. We have had
enough of so-called retorms; enough of
promises of more reforms; enough of
promised autonomy. Every intelligent
man would rightly condemn the leaders
and participants of this movement if
anything short of independence be the
basis of a treaty of peace with Spain.
"It is claimed that General Gomez is
willing to treat with Spain on the last;-, of
autonomy, and that a letter to that effect
has been received by me. There is no such
letter. Knowing General Gomez as a
commander in the last revolution, know
in. his opinions as expressed to me before
and during this war, knowing his stain
less patriotism, I : can vouch lor him. He
is made ol too stern material to surrender
to such terms, especially as, in bis last let
ter to me, he writes contentedly of his re
sources and his confidence that the winter
campaign will be successful.
"But though any of bur foremost lead
ers should be inclined to terminate the
war by acceptance of autonomy, which is
barely within the bounds, of possibility,
while be himself might surrender, he
would do so alone. We Cubans are not
worshipers of individualities; ..we are
Blaadfast followers of our ideal. The
death of our glorious Maceo struck sorrow
to every heart, but we did not falter, his
forces did not surrender and the revolu
tion received no perceptible check. The
leaders who proposed peace under the
Spanish flag would find themselves with
out followers. No treaty of peace can be
made by the Cubans unless ratified by a
specially convoked assembly.. It Is be
yond the bounds of possibility to expect
that tbe Cubans, after two years of san
guinary strife, when they find themselves
in a position such as has never been their
good fortune to occupy, in point of num
bers, equipment and resources, will now
weakly accept terms of compromise.
"Every Cuban, every American knows
that the apparent generous and concilia
tory spirit of Spain springs not from her
strength but from her weakness. How
can we, then, under the circumstances, be
expected to waver?
"If the Cubans in the field are too strong
to even consider such proposals, the
Cubans in the cities are too well advised
of Spain's plans and - Spain's precarious
situation to counsel this step. In the
cities, Spain's only stronghold, men of po
sition, of refinement, of wealth, have but
lately signed a statement, in which they
unequivocally say to those in this country
who seemed to have labored under the
idea that autonomy would be the result
of the so-called Cuban problem, that
, nothing but independence is acceptable to
them. They base their statement not only
on political but on economical reasons,
s. V. hat forms of autonomy would help
Cuba, when saddled, not only with her
previous debt, but with the added burden
of the cost oi the present war? The future
of the country would be ruin and starva
tion.
"News oi our success in the field may be
suffocated by the censor; pacification of
the island provinces may be falsely pro
claimed as in the case of Pinar del Rio;
decrees allowing grinding o. sugar may be
Issued where all cane has been destroyed;
promises of reforms and autonomy given
and amnesty promulgated ; but we
Cubans will continue to fight for inde
pendence and nothing but independence,
first, last and all the time. Our leaders
may fall; but others will take their places.
The opportunity will find the men. Gomez
himself has written that even should he
fail, the revolution is strong enough to
continue to its triumph. The only excuse
we will have for having begun the war is
its triumph; the only fitting monument
for our fallen comrades the independence
of their country.

GARCIA VERY CONFIDENT.
Bays the Cubans Can Whip the Spaniards
Without Aid.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.â The Sun's
p correspondent in Manzanillo, Cuba, writ
i ing under date of January 13, Bays Gen-
I eral Calixto Garcia says: "I am more con
evinced than ever that we do not need help
i.-om any other country to achieve our in
dependence. We can fight the Spaniards
alone and drive them out of the island,
notwithstanding their superiority in num
bers and resources. Interference on the
part of the American Nation is therefore
unnecessary. We can have the glory of
being an American country that can win
The San Francisco Call
its freedom without aid from abroad. We
do not expect such assistance as when the
United States offiered a friendly hand to
Juarez to free Mexico from a European
monarch."
General Garcia had with him about 6000
well-armed men and his stock of ammu
nition is satisfactory as compared with
the usual scarcity of cartridges in the
Cuban army. He has two cannon, one of
them a dynamite gun, which he uses
effectively.
A dispatch to the Herald via Key West
says: General Weyler . left on Tuesday
morning to take command of the oper
ations in the east. He drove from here to
Tuayono in his carriage, there mounted
his horse and took command of the oper
ations in the field.
Since the capture of the train near
Guanabacoa by Aranguren, General Wev
ler has decided very wisely, it would seem,
not to hazard a railway journey, and it is
announced that he will make this cam
paign on horseback and surrounded by his
gallant troops. He proposes to proceed
by easy stages to Jucaro and there visit
and inspect the famous trocha, which
Cubans pass witb such ease and expe
dition. He will then proceed to Matanzas
and perhaps on to Las Villas.
Wnile there are hints given from official
sources that this campaign will result in
complete pacification on the western half
of the island, it is thought by the best in
formed that, as usual when General Wey
ler concentrates bis columns, they will
find nothing before them, and that the
campaign will result in a simple tour of
inspection of the forces in the field by the
i commander-in-chief.
Tne latest news from General Gomez is
that he is advancing slowly westward. A
few days ago be captured the town of Los
Remidos, in the northwestern part of
Santa Clara, and then proceeded in a
northwesterly direction. This is denied
in official circles, but is none the less true.
The action of the general in leaving the
capital in these critical days is severely
criticized.
ANOTHER SPANISH VICTOR!.
Ruthless Slaughter of Woman and Chil-
dren in a Burning City.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21. -A Her
ald special from Jacksonville, Fla., says:
According to advices received by Cubans
here, 500 insurgents, under command of
Colonel Francisco de Paulo, dashed into
San Miguel, Padrone, Havana Province,
Saturday night, Tbe Spanish garrison,
consisting of 500 men, withdrew from the
town without firing a gun. The insur
gents held possession for three hours, loot
ing the stores, public buildings and many
of the residences occupied by Spanish
families. They captured the Mayor, and
forced him to deliver the money in his
possession, amounting to $3090. After
firing tbe best portion of t_e town and
several private residences, the insurgents
withdrew.
As soon as the insurgents withdrew,
the inhabitants, men, women and
children, busied them.eives trying to ex
tinguish the flames and saving their
effecs from burning buildings. While
thus engaged the Spanish forces returned,
_nd, it is alleged, opened fire on the men,
women and , children who were fighting
the flames. .;â , 'Yr,r Â»v_ -/; v ; -j.i >. ', ; ;., lj '
Volley after volley was poured in on the
helpless inhabitants, many of whom in
their terror rushed into the burning
houses and were cremated. The Spanish
then cnarged through the streets, using
the bayonet on all whom, they met,
sparing neither women nor children. Tbe
report says forty persons were killed out
right, eighteen of whom were women and
children. Sixty others were wounded,
some of them fatally. Several of those
wounded fell by the side of tbe burning
buildings and perished.
Adding to the forty killed outright
those wbo had fled into the burning
buildings and perished and those who
died of their wounds, nearly 100 persons
fell victims to the Spaniards. In report
ing tbe affair the Spanish commander, it
is said, stated that insurgents burned the
town, but were repulsed with neavy loss.
He admits that twelve of the inhabi
tants were killed by insurgent bullets.
CAUSED A SENS ATI OX.
Sinking of the Gunboat Relampago by
the Insurgent*.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 21.â Passengers
by she Olivette, bringing Havana news of
yesterday's date, report that the sinking
of the gunboat Relampago caused a sen
sation. Nothing is known except from
the official report. Private advices are
anxiously expected. It is said a mysteri
ous snip was seen near Cape Cruz, and it
is being asked if it had any connection
with the occurrence.
Weyler has started with 10,000 men, and
intends crossing Havana Province and to
march through Matanzas toward Santa
Clara. He has ordered the commanders
in the zones of Havana within three days
to destroy all houses on plantations which
may serve as a refuge for the enemy, ex
cept those for the use of the detachments.
The rebels continue burning cane fields.
General Pin prohibited in an indirect
way the grinding of cane in Cienfuegos,
arresting laborers and capturing carts.
The foreign planters wished to know if he
had a written order to prevent work. Pin
consulted with Weyler, not hiding his
sympathies with the planters. Weyler
sent a curt reply, transferring Pin to
Bayamo, and P;n returns on sick leave to
Spain. All classes at Cienfuegos have
telegraphed Weyler expressing regret on
Pin's departure.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 21.â The remains
of Henry Del-ado, the American prisoner
who died yesterday morning at the San
Ambrosio Hospital, where he had been
confined ever since his arrival in this city
after his capture in an insurgent hospital
in the province of Pinar del Rio, were in
terred at 4 o'clock this afternoon in the
Colon Cemetery. The funeral was a very
modest one and was attended only by the
American correspondents here, the clerks
from the American Consulate and Dr.
Burgess. The interment was in a special
plat.
Captain-General Weyler, after he left
Havana, marched along the highway to
Guinea, which place be reached yesterday.
Nothing further is known of his move
ments.
MURDERED BY SPANIARDS.
Honest Cubans Sl-iin in Cold Blood by
IheA- -Oppressors.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.-In fur
ther confirmation of the news reports o c
murders committed by - the Spanish
authorities at Guanabacoa, a suburb of
Havana, the Cuban Junta in this city
gave out to-day the names and descrip
tion of the victims who were massacred
in one week. The statement follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, JANUARY 22, 1897.
â¢'Murders committed in Guanabacoa
during one week: Lieutenant Fondeciel*
Nicolas Hernandez, white, proprietor of a
tackle factory, known as and representing
the Autonomist party; Andrea and San
tiago Ruiz, mulattos, well educated and
honest, owners of an undertaking estab
lishment and of a cafe and billiard-room
in Palo Blanco street; Jose Abella, white,
proprietor of a livery stable, honest man;
Luis Nunez, white, a man without re
proach; Ramon SotolOngo, white, em
ploye and nephew of the Marquis de la
Rael Proclamacion , Pedro and Jose Acos
ta, white, clerks; Justo Garcia, white, su
perintendent of a store; Ramon Mata,
white, clerk; Juan Manuel Pastoriza, cele
brated pitcher of the Almendarez Baseball
Club and a very popular young man : two
employes of Mr. Almagro, owner of the
Mariel estate. All were honest people and
of good antecedents, their only crime be
ing that of being Cubans." . â¢
These wanton murders have occurred
with such frequency that \ towns
people, fear-stricken, fled from, the town,
and ' the tradesmen "of " 6ua]na bacoa,*' ail
Spaniards, called and complained to
Lieutenant-General Ahumada in order to
stop the emigration, not through human
ity, but because their interests suffered.
The Cuban League of the United States,
of which Colonel Ethan Allen ot 155
Broadway, New YorK, is president, is or
ganizing a branch league in every town or
city in this country of 5000 inhabitants
and upward. There are 750 such towns
and cities in the United States. The ob
ject of the league is to call for an expres
sion of the sentiment of the American
people in favor of Cuban independence.
An effort is also being made to secure
the passage of a resolution in every State
Legislature demanding that such action
should be taken by this country to put an
end to the murder in Cuba.
The league is receiving letters daily, not
only from men, but from women of prom
inence, suggesting plans ior assisting the
Cuban patriots.
ROBBERY OF A TRAIN.
Bandits Loot the Express Car on the
Southern Railway on the Bir
mingham Division.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Jan. 21.â Train
robbers got in their work again to-night
on a Southern Railway passenger train.
The hold-up was, as on the previous occa
sion, at Berry station, on the Birmingham
and Greenville division, and within 300
yards of the previous occurrence.
Details are meager, as the officers are
very reticent and lave used every effort
to keep the matter quiet, but enough is
known to say that the express-car was
looced. This assertion is warranted, as it
is known that Express Agent Hailey re
ceived a telegram about 0 o'clock, which
said in substance: "Train held up at
same place beyond Berry station. Send
Burns." â¢''
As soon as possible a special was got
from the Southern roundhouse and Ed
wards and Special Detective Burns, with
a posse, left for the scene.
The robbers, it is supposed, got on the
train at Berry station, and when a large
stream was reached got into tbe engine
and made th â¢ engineer halt the train.
The express-car wus forced open and the
3 iff looted and men the engineer was
ordered to null out.
It is impossible to learn the amount of
money in the safe, as the company's
agent is not to be found.
Squabbles of Urigndiers.
BURLINGTON, lowa, Jan. 21.â The
bitter fight between Generals Prime and
Guest, for the brigadier-generalship for
tbe lowa State Militia, which was de
cided in favor of Guest by the lowa Dis
trict Court, was reopened by General
Guest appointing a full list of staff officers,
and signing the order "James A. Guest,:

lington." General Guest was acting un
der orders ' from Governor . Drake, who
firmly believes Guest was legally elected,
and to-day formally recognized Guest and
asked him to make the appointments. A
bitter fight is looked for.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 21. â San
Francisco's chances for a paid Fire De
partment were greatly advanced to-day
by the action, taken by the San Francisco
delegation,; which had under consider
ation during most of its session the bill of
Senator Mahoney, which has this object
in view. The full ' text of the measure is
as follows: ..
_â Section 1. Whenever the public interest,
safety or convenience may require, or it be
deemed expedient, the City, Council of any
municipality of the first class' may, by ordi
nance, make and enforce such rules and regu
lations within said .municipality as may be
necessary or | proper for increasing, the effici
ency of its Fire Department, and to that end,
.among other things, ; may provide for and
authorize the appointment and continued em
ployment of such officers, engineers, members,
| firemen, 'employes/ and ' other 'help' in
and for said Fire Department, in addition
to those whose employment is now or may
be hereafter authorized". by law,' as. the needs
of said department may require, and may fix
.their salaries, and compensation and may in
crease the, salaries and compensation of the
officers, engineers, members, * firemen, ' em
ploye's and other help 'now or hereafter au
thorized by law whose salaries and compensa
tion as now or hereafter fixed may be deemed
inadequate. And said, City Council may in
like manner provide for .the purchase and re
pair and authorize to be purchased and kept
in repair, in addition to those for the purchase
and repair of which provision is now or may
be hereafter made by law, all additional en
gines, horses, hook and ladder wagons and all
such other engines, machinery, implements,
extinguishers and other apparatus that may
be necessary, advantageous or auxiliary, to ex
tinguish or afford adequate protection against
fire. And in order to provide the necessary
funds with which to accomplish the foregoing
ends may make all necessary and supplement
ary appropriations, allowances and payments
in addition to those hereafter authorized by
law.** ' ".' " .".'',
Sec. 2. The officers, engineers, members, fire
men, employes and other help to be appointed, ;
as . provided In section 1 of this , act, shall
bo appointed, governed and controlled
in the same manner and by the same laws as
their fellow officers, engineers, members, fire
men, employes and other help whose appoint-;
ment is now or : may be hereafter authorized
by law are appointed, governed and controlled.
The engines, wagons, machinery. Implements,
'extinguishers and other apparatus, the pur
chase and repair of which are authorized by.
section 1 of this act, shall be purchased and
repaired in like manner and under tne same
regulations as like articles, the purchase and
repair of which are now or may be hereafter
authorized bylaw are purchased and repeired.
Sec. 3. The term "City Council," as used in
this act, is hereby declared to include any
body or bodies, board or boards, which, under
law, constitute the legislative department of
any municipality of the first class.
This delegation has now virtually all
the powers of a regular standing commit
tee, as it will probably be created such a
committee within a day or two. It was
decided to report the Mahoney bill favor
ably to the Senate to-morrow, with a
stipulation that the measure may be re
ferred to the San Francisco delegation for
any desired amendments without losing
its position on the file.

FOR. CHEAP CARFARE.
After Amendment Braunhnrl'a Bill la
Favorably < on aider
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 21.â One of
the strongest objections j made to the bill
â¢of Senator Braunhart, providing for a re
duction of : streetcar fares during certain
hours of the day, was that it will work a
hardship on the street railroads operated
in the -mailer cities of tbe State. This
measure was under consideration at the
meeting this afternoon of the Committee
on Corporations, and in order to meet the
objection mentioned .Braun. -art amended
bis measure so as to make it applicable to
only cities of the first class, that is, San
Francisco. A further amendment was
made to the bill retaining for the streetcar
patron all the transfer privileges that are
now allowed. The principal features of
the bill as amended are here given. â¢ ..
"No street railroad within the incorpo
rated limits of municipal corporations of
t c first-class shall, during the hours from
6 o'clock to 8 o'clock in the forenoon and
from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock: in the after
noon, charge or collect a higher rate of
fare than 2J_ cents for each passenger or
trip of any distance in one direction,
either going or coming, along any part of
the whole length of the road or its con
nections; provided, that the. privileges of
transfer to all branch lines belonging to
the same system, or other railroads, ex
isting on the Ist day of January, 1897, must
in no wise be abridged or impaired by rea
son of the provisions of t' is act. All such
street railroad companies shall issue
tickets, each good for a full trip during
such hours of the day as above specified,
and sell the same to any person offering
2% cents apiece therefor, in lots
not exceeding sixty to any one person at
any one time. Any person riding on the
cars of any such railroad companies dur
ing the hours above specified shall be en
titled to receive in change for any coin
exceeding such fare, tendered for his fare,
as many of such tickets as be may require,
not exceeding sixty.
"Every violation of the provisions of
section 1 of this act shall subject the
owner or owners of tbe street railroad
violating tbe same to a forfeiture to the
person so unlawfully charged or paying
more than is herein allowed to be charged,
in the sum of $250 for each and every un
lawful charge so made or collected, to be
recovered on suit in any court of com
petent jurisdiction; such causes of action
shall be ; assignable, and the action may
be maintained by the assignee in bis own
name, and several causes of action arising
out of unlawful charges or collection from
different persons may be vested in .the
assignee and united in the same action."
After being thus amended it was decided
to refer it to the San Francisco delegation,
Which ; is to . bold a meeting to-morrow.
It.will then b* decided whether to report
the measure favorably or not. The out
look is that the recommendation will be
made to the Senate that it pass.

to help them. The vessel went ashore
here at 4 o'clock. For hours she pounded
higher and higher on the sandy beach.
Then with a crash she went to pieces, and
one by one the nine sailors on board, who
could be plainly seen clinging to her rig
ging, were engulfed with the wreckage and
died within hailing distance of the life
saving crews on shore.
It was raining hard when the Chapin
came ashore. It was not exactly foggy,
but the rain was thick and a sort of white
mist enveloped the face of the ocean and
hid from view even the tops of the hui:e
waves as they came tumbling in. A stiff
gale was blowing from the northeast. The
surf was unusually high and the waves
beat upon the beach with great fury. The
storm was at its worst when the wreck
occurred. The villagers ' say that it was
the worst storm that part of Long Island
has known for years.
1 The patrol from. the life-saving stations
were on their beats. Suddenly above the
roar came a faint, shrill cry. full of mean
ing to the practiced ear of the patrol, for
it was the wailing of the foghorns that
sailing vessels carry. ' Then, through the
darkness, flashed a vivid light, the glare
of a rocket. For an instant the white
mist disappeared as though the curtain
was thrust aside, and coming madly be
fore the gale, the men on the beach saw a
three-masted schooner, her sails in shreds,
beating in hard upon the beach, not 400
yards from shore. . : jj-.t'<i:
The schooner struck the bar and then
careened over on one side. It was the
work of but a few moments for the patrol
to give the signal to the station to which
they belonged, and in a few moments the
life-saving crew was on its way to the
place.
A rope was fired from the mortar, but
the men could not fasten the rope. The
vessel in the meantime bad been made
out to be a three-masted schooner. She
was at daybreak within 350 yards of the
shore and beating in every minute. The
men on the beach could make out nine
men in the rigging. Six of the men were
clinging to the foremast rigging and tbree
men were on the jibboom. The life-savers
aid all in their power to get assistance out
to tbe doomed men, but it was impossible,
and finally at a few minutes before 7
o'clock, it was apparent to all that the
end was at hand. .
The vessel had been sinking, her decks
were under water, and only the masts and
jibboom end, to which three men were
clinging, could be seen. With every wave
the men on the jibboom were buried in
the sea and. hidden from the sight of the
watchers on the beach. At last a huge
wave came along, and when it had passed
over the jibboom one man was missing.
He was never seen again.
Other waves swept over the schooner,
and five minutes later another man was
swept from the jibboom. and but one man
could be seen clinging to the spar. He
held on to the last.
A few minutes later the foremast
came down with a crash, and at the same
time the cry of the six persons in the rig
ging told those on the beach that all was
over. In a few minutes great quantities
of wreckage began coming to shore. The
name of the vessel was not known up to
that time, but from a piece of wreckage it
was learned. At that moment it was
seen that two of those who were clinging
were not men as was supposed, but one a
woman and the other a child. It is sup
posed the woman was the wife of the cap
tain.
The Chapin was a vessel of 500 tons bur*
den and belonged in Rockland, Me. She
was commanded by Captain Arey. About
half an hour after the foremast went
down a man's body was washed ashore
with the wreckage. From the' dress it
was surmised that he was either the cap
tain or mate of the lost vessel.
The beach for miles around is now
strewn with wreckage from the vessel.
A "_*""V_._Â»A PACIFIC SURPRISE.
Plan of the Syndicate to Buy It la

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.â The plan
of the syndicate recently formed to pur

Union Pacific met with unexpected oppo
sition to-day from Russell Sage and the
Union and United States Trust compa
nies, who declared themselves unalterably
opposed to any plan which contemplates
the elimination of the Government's in

the interest of the United States Govern

Sage owns $400,000 wor;h of Union Pacific
securities, George Gould represents $800,

$2,000,000. As Pierrepont Morgan holds
the same view as Sage, it is believed the

KING OF BENIN
A "JU JU" MAN
Annihilates a Peaceful
Expedition Going to
Promote Trade. '
A Few Hide in the Jungle and
Escape Alter Terrible
Suffering.
The English Will, Punish This Can
nibal King Whose City Is Fn 1
of Human Bones.
LONDON. Eng., Jan. 21.â Further de
tails have reached here of the recent mas
sacre of members of a peaceable British
expedition by the natives of the Benin
country, and the facts as now known have
excited the deepest indignation, even
among the "Little Englanders," who de
clare that prompt punishment should be
meted out to the murderers.
As reported at the time in dispatches to
the United Associated Presses, an ex
pedition started from Bonney, on the Ni
ger coast protectorate. West Africa, for
Benin, Its object being to ask the King of
Benin to remove the obstacles be places
in the way of trade. The expedition con
sisted of acting Consul-General Phillips;
Major Copeland-Crawford, Deputy Com
missioner; Captain Boisragon, command
ant of the Niger coast protectorate force;
Messrs. Locke and Campbell of the staff,
and Messrs. Powis ana Gordon, civilians,
together with about twenty-five Kroomen
and native carriers.
None of the men were armed, and they
were in no wise prepared to meet an at
t_c_ should one be made upon them. This
was considered here to be a remarkably
foolhardy method of entering Benin, as it
lad been known for some time that the
king of, that country was hostile toward
the English, notwithstanding he had en
tered into treaty obligations with them.
It was explained that the expedition did
not desire to make any show of force
against tbe king, it being thought its ob
jects would be more readily attained were
no firearms carried. Tbis was a fatal mis
take, as subsequent events proved.
The expedition left Bonney about the
first of January and in about two weeks
the >acbt Ivy, belonging to the consulate,
returned to Bonney, after having left the
expedition, preparatory to making the
land journey to Benin, with the news of
the mas.acre of the entire expedition.
Later it was learned that seven of the
Kroomen escaped and that Captain Bois
ragon and Consular Officer Locke bad also
escaped.
Now it is learned that after the expe
dition left Sapele it proceeded without
difficulty, save that experienced from the
nature of the country, to within a few
miles of Benin City. Some of the Kroo
men had been sent forward to cut a path
through the jungle, and when the re
mainder of the expedition were almost
within si bt of the town tbey came upon
the bodies oi these pioneers, who had been
massacred. Before the expedition could
retreat, the Benin tribesmen attacked
them and, having tbem completely at a
disadvantage, the party was almost com
pletely annihilated.
. Captain Boisragon and Consular Officer
Locke were wounded, as were also the
seven Kroomen who subsequently reached
the coast. Tuey managed to crawl unob
served in the almost impenetrable jungle,
and after days of horrible suffering from
their wounds and the exhaustion of their
toilsome journey succeeded in reaching
New Benin on the coast, 220 miles west of
Bonney.
It was announced some time ago that
an expedition was to leave Bonney for
Benin City, and it was said then, as the
King of Benin was a "Jn Ju" man, and as
his city was full of the remains of human
sacrifices, it was not expected that he
would agree to the request of the protec
torate officials for better trade facilities.
In tbe event of his refusal it was in
tended to get the sanction of the British
Foreien Office for ar> armed expedition to
proceed against the King, who bad threat
ened to kill the next white man who at
tempted to visit bim. In view of this
threat it is difficult to understand why an
unarmed expedition should have sought
to enter his country.
As soon as the news of tbe massacre
reached England ordeis were given for
the British officers stationed on tbe coast,
wbo were home on furlough, to return to
their posts, and instructions were given
for the formation of an expedition to pun
ish the King ot Benin.
Tbis expedition will consist of forces of
the Niger coast pro ectorate and contin
gents of sailors from tbe vessels of the
West Africa squadron. It is said that
such an expedition would bave to pro
ceed to Benin City in a short time, even
bad the massacre not occurred, as the
whole of the Niger coast protectorate was
suffering from the cruelties and tbe ex
actions of tbe King of Benin. Slavery is
rampant in tbat country and human sacri
fices and cannibalistic heathen rites are
matters of daily occurrence.
* It is seen that if the country is to be
made of any value whatsoever it will be
necessary to suppress the King with a
-strong hand. The country is said to be
very rich, and it would not be very sur
prising to find that one result of the expe
dition would be the annexation of tbe
whole territory to the British possessions
in West Africa.
The expedition was divided into two
sections to facilitate traveling. As they
progressed into the country they were
greeted in a friendly manner by the resi
dents of several villages, which led to the
hope that no opposition would be met
with anywhere along the route. When
the commander of the expedition had
reached a point twenty miles from the
Benin River couriers from tbe King ar
rived bearing peaceful measures, wbich
added to the leeling of security which
pervaded the party.
, Here it was determined to send a num
ber of tbe carriers ahead as bearers of
presents to the King. They followed the
route laid out by the pioneers and met
with no hostility from any of tbe natives
Who were seen. '
These carriers were lour hours ahead of
the main body of the. expedition, wben
without a warning of any kind tbey were
attacked by a large number of warriors,
who bad already dispatc ed the pioneer
Kroomen. Every one of the carriers and
.those witb tbem were massacred. . .iggggj
The second company, entirely unaware
of tbe fate of tbeir predecessors, was
'marching along, when suddenly they
came upon the piled-up bodies of their
-massacred companions. There were no
signs of an enemy about, tbe Benin war
riors having 'bid themselves in the thick
. Jungle to await tbe coming of the second
party. As the latter were stopped by the
sight of tbe bodies and began to examine
them, a murderous volley was poured
.into them by the natives iv ambush.
- Acting Consul-General Phi. lips and Mr.
Powis were instantly killed. Major Cop
lan -Crawford was wounded and died
shortly alter. The natives again fired
into the party and then fell upon them
and either shot, stabbed or clubbed them
to death.
â  Mr. Campbell, . one of the consular
officials, was captured, and it is supposed
he was taken to Benin to be executed.
It has been learned that Captain Bois-
ragon and Mr. Locke each had a revolver,
and b.-fore they made their escape into
the bush they shot several of: the attack
ing party. When they got away from the
scone of the massacre they made their
way toward the river, subsisting as best
they could on cassava
The only means they had of quenching
their thirst was to suck dew off the plants
at night. They finally reached the river,
procured a canoe from some friendly na
tives .and* made their way to New Benin,
where they met a British launch. Had
they not procured the canoe it is doubtful
if they ever would have reached the coast.
The King has sent to the British the
rings that were worn by Mr. Phillips.
This is regarded as an act ot defiance which
the King will soon have cause to regret.
Mr. Powis was the agent of Millar Bros.
& Co. of Glasgow, and Mr. Gordon repre
sented the association of Liverpool. Both
men have been on the coast as traders for
several years.

EDMUNDS ON ARBITRATION.
This Noted Ex-Senator and Constitutional
Authority Answers Objections Made
to Its Consummation.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa.., Jan. 21.â Ex-
Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont,
one of the leading authorities on consti
tutional law in the United States, has
written the following letter to several
gentlemen here who sought his opin
ion on the arbitration treaty between tbis
country and Great Britian. Mr. Edmunds
said :
The three principal criticisms of the treaty
are: Firstâ That it commits this Government
to submitting to arbitration questions that
may arise in connection with the Monroe
doctrine. With sincere respect for the gentle
man who, it is said, have suggested this ob
jection 1 think that it is quite unfounded aud
that those who have advanced it must have
failed to observe .the careful language used in
the treaty. The words upon which the criti
cism is based are found ln Article IV, as fol
lows: "All other matters in difference, In re
spect of which eitber of the high contracting
parties shall have rights against tbe other in
the treaty or otherwise."
What; then, are ''rights against the other"?
In the theory of the state and of all its auton
omy the rights of one citizen against another
are essentially ana exclusively those that the
stale enjoins upon one as against another.
This is the definition. The same is trne of in
ternational law and the centuries of inter
course between nations. This I believe all
writers on natural law and international law
agree in. To illustrate these propositions: I
take it that the United States has no rights
against Great Britain in regard to her opera
tions in Abyssinia, nor would she have any
rights against us if we were to attempt to
snare in tbe partition of Africa. In the case
oi Turkey, if we were to seiza the whole of
Asia Minor and establish peace and order
there (as tbe British have done in substance
in Egypt) we should have invaded no right of
any power except that of Turkey.
Tne same is of course true in respect to our
relations and conduct with the state of the
Wvstern Hemisphere, under the Monroe doc
trine, or under any other article we think it
just to adopt. . This is clearly and distinctly
understood in regard to the rights of nations
that doubtless led to a separate treaty in re
gard to Venezuela, for both Governments
knew that the affair could not possibly come
within the scope of 'the general treaty. You
will see, therefore, that the phrase of the
treaty which is criticized is the most apt
possible boundary of arbitration, and leaves
the Monroe doctrine clear.-
The second is a fear that the treaty may
affect our attitude in regard to the Nicaragua
canal, in which tbe Interests of the United
States are so deeply concerned, What I have
already said disposes of that solicitude. I have
not time to go into details about it.
The third and last objection I have heard is
the supposed danger of leaving it to any Euro
pean power to name an umnire in certain
contingencies. It is enough to say that so far
as our considerable experience has gone in
such matters we have never bad occasion to
complain ot the action of any sovereign in
naming an umpire or in deciding a dispute.
In a great arbitration treaty of 1867 we agreed
that three members of the Geneva tribunal
should be named by tbree sovereigns, three of
them European, and that if any or all of these
sovereigns should fail to name these members
the King of Sweden should name them all;
and in tbe same treaty we did not hesitate to
submit the very Important question of our
boundary on the Pacific Coast to the Emperor
of Germany. lam intense in my support of
the Monroe doctrine. I believe the build
ing of the Nicaragua canal under tbe auspices
of the Untied States to be of urgent necessity.
I believe most earnestly in international arbi
tration to the utmost extent that civilized,
just and self-respecting nations can go, and 1
most earnestly hope that the Senate will ratify
the treaty as it is proposed as the first stepâ
very great and auspiciousâ toward the attain
ment of peace among nations.'
GAMEKEEPERS .% EARLY LYNCHED
They Shot Four Farmers and Are Now
in Jail; P-S|
CHICAGO, 111,, Jan. 21.â Lake County,
Indiana, bas been greatly stirred by the
shooting of four farmers by the game
keepers of the Tolleston Gun Club Tues
day morning. In Hammond, Whiting,
Tolleston and Crown Point the farmers
gathered yesterday and threats were not
only freely made against the men who
were concerned in the shooting but
against the proprietors of the Gun Club
grounds as well. Threats of organizing to
"clean out*' the gamekeepers, sack the
| property and blow up the clubhouse were
not infrequent. .V'-V .
Up to 6 o'clock last night none of the
men injured in the shooting of Monday
had dlea, but the doctors said that Co
tick, the farmhand who was shot through
the lung witb a rifle ball,. had no chance
of recovery, and they also gave it as their
opinion tbat Pratt, who received two
charges of shot in his legs, would not re
cover. The four game wardens are in jail
at present and an additional guard has
been stationed there to prevent a possible
lynching.
Close of an lowa Bank.
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 21.â The
German Savings Bank closed Its doors
ibis morning. The bank owed its de
positors at the last report $2,554,000. .The
assets, as stated, are $7,661,040. The failure
.was a great surprise, the bank being under
a conservative management. A great
crowd surrounds the doors. There is no
sign of runs on other banks. ,

LONDON, Eng., Jan. 21.â The Govern
ment has issued a blue book containing
the official correspondence in regard to
proiected reforms in Turkey. The corre
spondence shows that on September 23
last Lord Salisbury proposed that the
powers take measures to enforce their pro
posals, and that in the event of unwilling
ness on the part of any power to assume
its share in the coercive measures applied,
that power should not oppose the action
of any other. >
Austria gave her assent to this proposi
tion without qualification, and later Ger
many assented, with the provision that
any coercive action taken, against Turkey
mu--t be unanimous, and further, that the
integrity of the Ottoman empire mnst be
maintained, Italy gave her absolute as
i sent to the proposal, but Russia objected
to any scheme which involved the appli
cation of coercion to make it operative.
* In interposing objection M. Shisbkin,
then at the head of the Russian Foreign
Office, stated that coercive action was re
puenant to the Czar. .
In reply to this. Lord Salisbury expostu
lated with the Russian Minister, saying
that it would be useless for the powers to
make further concert-d representations to
the Porte in regard to reforms unless they
were prepared to enforce their proposals.
On Novetnbnr 24 Mr. Shishkin wrote to
Lord Salisbury, saying tbat the Czar had
agreed to consider the subject of coercion,
if the Sultan should prove recalcitrant,
and the other powers were unanimously
in favor of resorting to coercion.
About the end of December France gave
similar assent to measures of coercion,
and the Governments of Russia, Austria
and Italy reaffirmed their adhesion to
that plan of action.

AFTER THE BOOKMAKERS.
Senator Feeney Has a Bill Rather
Sweeping in Its Nature.
bACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 21.â Senator
Feeney is after the poolsellers and book
makers. He introduced a measure to-day
tbat would. sweep tbese worthies from the
face of the earth. He proposes to punish
not only those wbo register bets, but also
the owners of property who allow such
premises to be used by the "bookies."
This is his bill in full:
Every corporation, partnership, association,
society or person who keeps any room, shed,
tenement, tent, booth or building, or any part
thereof, or who occupies any place upon any
public or private grounds within this State
with books, apparatus or paraphernalia for
the purpose of recording or registering bets or
wagers or of selling poois, and any person who
records or registers bets or wagers, or sells
pools UDon the result of any trial or contest of
skill, speed or power of. endurance of man or
beast, or upon the result of any political
nomination, appointment or election; or be
ing the owner, agent, lessee or occupant of
any room, shed, tenement, tent, booth or
building, or any part thereof, or of private
grounds, knowingly permits the same to be
used or occupied for any of tbe above-named
purposes, or therein keeps, exhibits or em
ploys any device or apparatus for the purpose
of recording or registering such bets or wagers
or the selling of such pools, or becomes the
custodian or depositary for hire or reward of
any money, property or thing of value stated,
wagered or pledged upon any such result,
shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and -upon
conviction thereof shall be punished accord
ingly.
. It bas been looked for every day since
the beginning of the session, and those
interested are therefore fully prepared to
give it tbe reception they believe it de
serves. The bill was referred to the Com
mittee on Public Morals. It is signifi
cantly asserted that if the welfare of the
public morals was. really the incentive
that induced Senator Feeney to introduce
it be should bave made it less radical. -;=.-;
Senator Mahoney introduced a bill to
day which provides that any political
party which cast 5 per cent of the vote at
a preceding election shall be entitled to
representation in tbe precinct boards of
election! '..,--. i. : --.*'*
Senator Hall introduced a bill providing
for the establishment of a "municipal hos
pital for disease* of the nervous system."
in San Francisco. This is to be main
tained for tbe treatment of dipsomaniacs
and morphine, opium and alcohol inebri
ates, and is to be conducted in connection

magistrates are given tbe right to commit
to the institution for not more tban one
year, but the medical superintendent may
discbarge an inmate before the expiration
of bis term of commitment, if be considers

IRRIGATION AMENDMENTS.
Numerous Plans to Remedy the Errors
in the Wright Act.
, SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan; 21.â When
the joint Committee on Irrigation extend
ed an invitation to all person to come be
fore them and submit suggestions for
amending and perfecting the Wright act
they probably did not realize the character
and extent of the floodgates which' tbey
had thrown open. To-night was the time
set for considering all matters pertaining
to irrigation and water rights, and there
was no dearth of material presented to the
committee.
' Attorney Easton bad a. bill of about 1800
words prepared and submitted it.' 1 He ex
plained that it was a measure providing
particularly for a less onerous system of
redemption of lands forfeited by reason of
failure to pay irrigation district taxes. Its
salient features are that it extends the
time for redemption from one year to two
years, permits redemption j as long as the
property remains in the hands of the irri
gation district, and gives six months after
the passage of the proposed act for the re
demption of all property that has not been
sold to private persons. It also materially
reduces the penalties, interest, etc., to be
paid by the, property-owner on redemp
tion of his land. : ' - >\
- J. E. Ward of Modesto presented a
measure designed to protect collectors of
irrigation districts in the cases of taxes
paid under protest. ;\
R. Perry Wright of > San Francisco sub
mitted a long- list of suggestions for the
amendment of the Wright act, covering
every important feature "of , the bill that
bad been found seriously defective by past
experience. -]' .'* - :V.' : < J.-'-^
George H. Maxwell of San Francisco
spoke of the unsatisfactory . conditions
which he said prevailed in every irrigation
district, and suggested tbe appointment
of a commission to investigate the entire
matter.
E. J. Hazen of Turlock and I. M. Wood
also addressed the committee briefly.
It was getting late and Senator Pedlar,
in ordÂ«r to simplify matters and at the
same time to check the flood of suggestion,
offered the following resolution, which
was adopted:
Resolved, That a joint committee of nine
five from the Assembly and four Irom the
Senate, including the chairman of the Irriga
tion Committee of each Houseâ appointed
by. the chairman of the joint committee to con
sider all amendments offered at this meeting
as well as all bills now pending in both houses
relating to the act known as the Wright law.'
Said joint committee shall embody amend
ments and pending bills in one geueral bill aa
far as practicable and Introduce -aid bill as
soon as prepared.
Chairman Androus* announced the fol
lowing as the joint sub-committee: Sena
tors Aram, Linder, Pedlar and Androus,
and Assemblymen Way mire, Melick,
Boone, Bridgford and Lindenberger.
. When this sub-committee formulates a
bill it will be submitted for approval to
the whole committee, which in turn will
report it in one of the houses.
Meanwhile, as the matter of redemption
is an urgent question which must be acted
upon before the first of February, the
Senate Committee on Irrigation to-day de
c d-d to report favorably Bridgford's As
sembly bill providing for a six months'
extension of tbe time for redemption. T..e
Senate will be asked to suspend the rules
and put the bill upon its final passage to
morrow. There is no doubt that this
procedure will be followed. This measure
will therefore bear the distinction of being
the first to be placed in the hands of the
Governor this session.
ELECTION V OX TESTS.
Committees May let Be Compelled to
1 runt Ballots.
SACRAMENTO. Cat,.. Jan. 21.â There
was an extended session of the Senate
Committee on Elections this afternoon in
the Senate chamber, which drew a large
and interested audience.
Martin Stevens appeared on behalf of
Welch (R.), who is contesting the seat of
Hall (l)-). It was understood that all the
testimony and argument used 1:1 the case
of Tyrrell against Hall should . apply to
the Welch-Hall case. In addition to this,
Stevens claimed that Hall shall be un
seated on the ground- that he had violated
the purity of the election law by having
promised a situation in tbe mint to a man
named Love. j;. ~3-
Frank H. Powers appeared to plead the
cause of Chandler against Feeney. He
stated that Feeney was a life member of
the San Francisco Fire Department, that
he lived in the engine-house where he was
employed, and which is located outside of
the district in which Feeney ran for Sena
tor, and that. consequently Feeney was
not eligible to election. Powers also
argued tbat the Senatorial nominations
were all filed with the Registrar in a
bunch, and that consequently Feeney's,
being among the number, was not law
fully registered. Finally he contended
that in the Twenty-fifth Senatorial Dis
trict About 180 illiterate voters had their
ballots marked by an outsider instead of a
member of the precinct election board. J
This closed the hearing, and the com
mittee adjourned to go into executive
session this evening to deliberate upon
these two cases and also that of Tyrrell
against Hall, heard last Tuesday night.
At this time it was a question on the part
of the committee whether or not the
ballots in the Hall cases should be pro
duced and canvassed. During the secret
session to-night it was decided that tbe
ballots should be made part of the testi
mony.
While no definite conclusion was
reached in tbe Chandler- Feeney contest

.TONES' IMPORTANT BILLS.
One of Them Relates to the Pensioning
of Schoolteachers.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 21.âAssem
blyman Leon E. Jones is one of the
quietest and most unobtrusive men on
the floor of the Assembly, but be is an
industrious worker, who prefers quality to
quantity, and be does not propose to in
troduce many bills, but a few good ones. Â
One of these is the teachers' annuity
bill an amendment to " the existing law,
and providing that all teachers who wish
to partake of the benefits of the pension
system would be required to join within
i ninety days after the passage of the act or
after tbey began teaching in the public
schools. The bill extends the operations
of the pension act to every county in tbe
State, so that after a continuous service of
thirty years tbey may retire on a pension
of $50 per montb. Teachers when dis
abled in the discharge of their duty will
receive a pension in proportion to the
length of time which they may have
served. Treasurers of the different conn
ties are made custodians of the fund.
â¢ Another important bill by Jones pro
vides for the protection of the business
of expert accountants by licensing' them
and obliging them to pass an examination
before certain professors of the State Uni
versity.
He is now preparing a bill to amend tbe
purity of elections law by providing that
party tickets be printed as a whole on the
official ballot, and not alphabetically ,as
they, are arranged now,, with the party
title after each name!, Parties which
have bad a National ticket in. the field
such as the Democrat, the Republican, the
Silverites, the People's party, and the Pro
hibitionistsâwill have the names of their
candidates printed .on the ballot,; each
with its own heading. All other candi
dates will be worded "Independent."

375, by the same author, confers much
needed powers upon the Board of Health.
It applies particularly to San Francisco
and will be therefore "or great interest to
the people. It reads as follows:
The Board of Health of every municipality
and of every county in this State shall have
the same powers with respect to the adoption
and passage of ordinances relating to matters
of a sanitary character and to matters which
effector relate to the health ot such munici

as are now or may be hereafter conferred
upon the Common Council or other governing

The said ordinances shall be passed in the

county, the former, to the extent to which the
conflict exists, shall prevail and be paramount.
A measure for the relief of agricultural
district associations has been referred to
the Committee on Agriculture. It is Mr.
Harris' Assembly bill No. 364. Its pro
visions are: >;-''\ :'â  â â :.â '/
The president of any district agricultural
association organized under the laws of this
State as a State institution for tbe purpose of

by and for such association, and by and for
any agricultural association or society,
to the possession of the property held,
by which' said district agricultural as
sociation bas succeeded, for moneys used
in improving such property for the pur
pose of holding agricultural fairs, and for
money expended in holding such fairs, or for
either or any of such purposes. Such claim

Henry had an eye to the interests of
lajbor when he introduced Assembly bill
363. It adds a new section to the Penal
Code, providing that all "goods, wares
and merchandise made by convict labor
in any penitentiary or .other establish
ment in which convict labor is employed
sbali before being sold or exposed for sale
be branded, labeled or marked as herein

lows:
No license shall hereafter be imposed upon
any person soliciting orders lor the sale of any
article or articles manufactured or produced
in this State, which, under the constitution

THE CANAL BILL
Senator Turpie Hurls Sar
casm at the Nicaragua
Waterway-
Morgan Failed to Get the Senate
to. Fix a Time for the
Vote.
A Bill Making th. Terms of Post
masters Four Years Put Aside
Without Action.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â A few
days ago the memorial of Henry Dupont
for admission to a seat in the Senate was
presented by Chandler of New Hampshire
and Was referred to the Committee on
Privileges and Elections. To-aay a certifi
cate of election was presented by the same
Senator, and was similarly referred, to the
effect that John Edward Addicks has been
legally elected to the vacant seat in the
Senate from the State ot Delaware.
An unsuccessful attempt was made by
Hill (D.) of New York, backed by Chand
ler to have a bill considered and passed
fixing the term of oftice of all Postmas
ters at four years. Hale (R.) of Maine ob
jected, however, on the ground that the
bill would only intensify the scramble for
postoffice appointments, and the bill was
not taken up.
Most of the morning hour, which is
really two hours, was taken up to-day, as
it has been for the' past few days, in a
wrangle over the bill as to electric con
duits in the city of Washington, Hilt
making an additional argument in oppo
sition to the bill. It went over without
action.
Then Tarpie (D.) of Indiana began his
third day's argument against the Nic
aragua canal bill, illumining the subject
with ' scintillations of bitter sarcasm.
There was no parallel, he said, between
the Suez canal and the Nicaragua canal.
Disraeli had bought for the British Gov
ernment the control of the Suez canal be
cause that was "a bird in the hand," but
if Mr. Olney were to do the same for the
Nicaragua canal it would be buying "a
bird in a bush."
He characterized the Maritime Canal
Company of Nicaragua as an 'incorporated
myth."
Referring to Morgan's statement that
there was a race between Great Britain
and the United States as to who should
build the Nicaragua canal, Turpie said
that if there was such a race it was a very
languid and indolent one. It was a race
in which the books had been open 150
years and there were no entries yet.
If this offer was made to the British
Parliament tne answer to the company
would be: "You have no right to make
the transfer. That right is forbidden by
[the terms of your own contract. You took
this concession for ten years from the 2lst
of April, 1887. and your life expires on the
__st of April, 1897. Do you ttiink that we
are going to give you $100,000,000 for a
corpse and then have to bury it at our
own charge?" [Laughter.]
Turpie closed his speech at 3 P. m., hav
ing thus occupied exactly five hours in
the three days through which his speech
has extended.
Morgan asked Turpie whether he had
any amendments to offer to the canal bill.
Turpie said that he had a substitute to
offer for it, but he was not prepared to
offei it.
Morgan remarked that the bill was one
on which action one way or the other
should be taken without unnecessary de
lay. He wanted action one way or the
ether ana he asked unanimous consent to
have the vote taken on the bill and amend
ments at . o'clock to-morrow.
Turpie objected, saying he was not pre
pared to offer the proposed amendment
and he knew of two or three Senators not
now present who desired to speak on the
bill.
Morgan suggested taking the vote on
Tuesday next at 3 o'clock, but Turpie
would not agree to having any time
fixed.
"Very well," said Morgan, "then I bave
no other alternative but to ask the Sen
ate to sit out the bill."
I'effer (Fop.) of Kansas made a brief
argument against the. bill, saying he was
utterly opposed to the guaranteeing or the
issuing of bonds by the Government.
Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin expressed a,hope
that the Senator from Alabama (Morgan)
would not insist on an unusual course on
a bill which appropriated $200,000,000 of
public money. Morgan suggested to Vilas
to fix his own time for taking tUe vote.
"I do not thinK," Vilas replied, 'that
we have reached a point where the oppo
nents of the measure should be called
upon to name an hour and day for taking
a vote."
Hoar (R. ) of Massachusetts reminded
Vilas that the custom which prevailed in
the Senate when he first came to Congress
was not to lay an important measure
aside after two or three hours' discussion
each day, but to continue the debate until
3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, and so
bring the measure to a vote. He thought
that should be the rule now.
Vilas remarked that during his service
in the Senate one bill had been debated
for months.
"What bill was that?" Hoar asked.
. "The tariff bill," was the reply. ',
"Oh," said Hoar, ''the tariff bill is not
only a thousand bills in one, but it is also
a thousand ills in one." (Laughter.)
Hill put in the remark that the Sher
man silver bill had been before the Senate
from August until November. ;â¢'
"Never mind the past," Chandler sug
gested, cynically. "How are we now?
The morning hour of each day is taken up
by the Senator from New York, and the
Senator from Wisconsin proposes to take
up the re3t of the day."
"Where does the Senator from New
Hampshire come in?" was Hill's com
ment.
Morgan, in urging that there should be
no delay in action on the bill, said that
the Senate could not afford to go into the
consideration of the arbitration treaty
without action being taken on the Nicara
guan canal, because such action would
aetermine whether the canal and all the
treaties relating were matters of differ
ence between the Government of the
United States and the Government of
Great Britain.
According to this view of the exigency
it was not fair to the country or fair to the
Senate to undertake filibustering to defeat
a measure on which the fate of other im
portant public matters hung. .
Vilas resented the charge of filibustering
and declared that there would be no ob
jection to having the vote taken alter fair
and reasonable discussion; but if oppor
tunity for the discussion was not given,
then "he would move that when the Senate
adjourn to-day it adjourn to meet on Mon
day next, and on that motion he de
manded the ayes and noes. ThÂ« vote was:
Ayes 13, noes 26 â Senators less than a
quorum.
The House bill transferring the county
of Audrain, in Missouri, from the western
to the eastern judicial district in Missouri ,
was passed ; also a House joint resoiution
authorizing the ate of Fort Hi dwell, Cal.,
for an Indian training-school, and.Senate
Dili extending for four years the time for
the completion of the East Nebraska and
Gulf railway through the Omaha and
Winnebago Indian reservation.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire pre- |
sented an amendment to be offered to the
naval appropriation bill looking to the
erection of a statue in the city of Wash
ington to the late Admiral David D. Por- ,
ter. Referred.
â¢Gallineer (R.) of New Hampshire called
attention to what he called "extraordinary
legislation" in the House of Representa
tives. He referred to Senate bills increas
ing individual pensions, and said that
these bills were amended in the House by
reducing the amount of tensions now be
ing paid to the beneficiary. The better
legislation, he said, would be lor the
House to reject those bills, instead of
necessitating conference committees.
Hill (D.) of New York asked unanimous
consent to have the bijll fixing the term of
postmasters at four years taken up. Ob
jection was made by Sherman (R. ) of
Ohio, who suggested that the bill "go over
uutil to-morrow.
Chandler stated that the bill bad been
reported unanimously from the Posiotfice
Committee; that it had been carefully
scrutinized by Senators of all politics, and
that there seemed to be no objection to it.
Hale (R.) of Maine suggested that the
passage of the bill would lead to a general
scramble for these offices.
"The scramble is now," said Chandler,
"and the object of the bill is to prevent
the custom of partisan inroads on a new
administration for the clearing out of the
postmasters of the country."
The bill was laid aside without action.
The District of Columbia subway bill
was taken up and Hill (D.) of New York
made another argument against it, con
tending that the bill was in the interest of
a monopoly and against the principle of
fair competition.
The bill went over witnout action.
Chandler rose to a question of privilege
and presented a paper claiming to be the
credentials of Edward J. Addicks as Sena
tor from the State of Delaware.
"From what source does that paper em
anate?" asked Gray (D.) of Delaware.
"It was addressed to me," Chandler an
swered, "by Mr. Addicks, who believes
himself lawfully elected Senator trom
the State of Delaware and believes he is
entitled to be sworn in now. But in view
of the fact that I presented last week the
memorial of Mr. Dupont setting out that
he is entitled to that seat and had that
memorial referred to the Committee on
Privileges and Election, I will not ask that
Mr. Addicks be sworn until the commit
tee has considered both sides of the case.
I therefore ask that this paper be referred
to the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions." The paper was so referred.
Tbe Senate' adjourned at 4:30 till to
morrow.

Exorbitant Fries Bring a Reprimand
on a Quartermaster.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â Major
Horatio B. Lowery, staff quartermaster
of the marine corps, has been severely
reprimanded in public orders by Secre
tary Herbert, thereby escaping court
martial. A court of inquiry recently in
vestigated the contracts let by Major
Lowery for the laundry work of the ma
rine corps, and found that although, they
were let to the lowest bidder the price
paid was clearly exorbitant, the average
rate being $8 20 per hundred, as compared
with $1 the year previous.
A man named Betford, who was not a
laundryman, secured the contracts at all
the navy-yards and then sublet them at
an enormous profit, the conditions and
prices in the Washington contract being
similar to those at Portsmouth, N. H.,
Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Norfolk, Boston
and Annapolis. The court decided that
Major Lowery had committed seven spe
cies of offenses.
Secretary Herbert decided not to con
vene a court-martial, as no further evi
dence can be obtained, and the evidence
now before him is not sufficient, when
taken in connection with the previous
good character of Major Lowery, to justify
the conclusion that he has been corrupt
or guilty of anything else than careless
ness and insubordination.
THE A RBI .*TI ON IRE A T_.
Some Criticisms Are Replied To by the
State Department.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.âCon
trasting the criticism of the new general
arbitration treaty made in some quarters
that a European ruler under the terms
might b3 called upon to settle any dispute
involving the Monroe doctrine, it is
pointed out at the State Department that
territorial matters are to be governed
wholly by article 6, which stipulates
that a final "award by a majority of not
less than five to one" of the six arbitrators
appointed by the Supreme Courts of the
two countries.
Article 10, which names the' King of
Sweden to appoint an umpire in case the
arbitrators fail to select one specifically
by ita own terms, relates wholly to arbi
trations under articles 3 and 5. Article '3
is restricted to claims of $500,000 or Jess,
each country having one â¢ jurist as arbi
trator. Article 5 is restricted to matters
exceeding $500,000, "provided such mat
ters in difference did not involve the de
termination of territorial claims."
It will be seen that matters, involving
the Monroe doctrine or any territorial dis
pute can be determined by a vote of 5 to 1
of the arbitrators originally selected by
the two countries and that no reference to
aliens of both countries was contemplated.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â A bill
was favorably reported to the Senate to
day authorizing the erection of a life
saving station at, or near Point Arena,
Mendocino County, .Cal., and a quaran
tine station near Astoria, Or. The House
joint resolution authorizing the use. of

Asiatic Fleet Engineer Prostrated.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 2Lâ The
disastrous policy of maintaining a naval
organization with an insufficient corps of
naval engineers has again been presented
by the prostration of Fleet Engineer JBtir
nap of the Olympia, the flagship of the
Asiatic squadron. A veteran of the Civil
War and a man closely approaching the
compulsory naval age of retirement he
has collapsed under the strain of looking
out for the 17,000 horsepower machinery
of the Olympia, while at the same time
exercising the general duties of fleet en
gineer of the squadron.
Pointers for American Merchants.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 21.â Consul
Ridgeley at Geneva reports to the State
Department increased activity of Ameri

ing foreign markets, as manifested in his
district, by most attractive catalogues
which are being distributed broadcast,
but which are unhappily printed in the
English language. He suggests that com
mercial literature for the foreign Coun

English is seldom understood.

MR. TUCKER NOW
TAKES THE SEAT
Repressed Excitement in
the House on a Con
tested Election.
Scathing Comments on the Elec
tion Laws of the State of
Virginia.
..;.-.
The Vote Was Cose, but Yost, the
Contestor, Was Beaten and His
D: â at Clinch?-
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 2Lâ After
126 members of the House of Representa
tives, including fifty-three Republicans,
bad voted in accordance with the .recom
mendation of the majority of Elections
Committee No. 3 that Tucker was entitled
to retain his seat as a member of , the
Fifty-fourth Congress from the Tenth
Virginia District," which was contested by
Yost (R.), two ' hours were spent in
making the vote effective and finally
settling the matter. The case had been
discussed from 3to 4:30 p. m. DeArmond
(D.) of Vermont, Walker (R.) of Massa
chusetts, Tucker (the contestee) and Mc-
Call (R.) of Massachusetts, chairman ot
the committee reporting the case, spoke.
The report of the minority that Yost is
the Representative-elect and should be
given his seat was supported by Grow
(R. of Pennsylvania, Lacey (R.) of lowa,
Brumm (R.) of Pennsylvania, Thorp (R.)
of Virginia and Walker (R.) of Virginia,
the latter of whom, with Thomas (R.) of
Michi.an, constituted the minority of the
Elections Committee. The vote in favor
of Yost was 120, Thomas having changed
his vote in ' order to move a reconsidera
tion, and this closeness induced the
friends of the minority, led by Hepburn
(R.) of lowa and Thomas, to make a fight
to force an adjournment in hopes that a
different result might be effected to
morrow. Tne fight was futile and the re
port to seat : TucKer was adopted at 4:35.
The matter was clinched by the defeat of
the motion to reconsider the matter.
Consideration was resumed of the con
tested election case ot. Yost vs. Tucker
from the Tenth District -of Virginia. De
Armond supported the adoption of the
resolution, declaring Tucker entitled to
retain his seat. ; : He declared in this case,
there being no Federal statute interven
ing, the law of Virginia was the law of
Congress, and should be followed by the
House. ". Â*.'.. ... '"?â¢.
--â¢ Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania, the vener
able lex-Speaker, spoke briefly on the
principles tbat should, control the House
in determining House elections, his time
being jointly yielded one-half from each
side. The House, sat as a hig.i court of
judicature, he said, and any, member who
did not act upon that principle should be
impeached for incompetency, or for a want
of that American principle which should
animate him in the discharge of his duties.
TApplause.], He hoped the timo would
boon come when members would regard
themselves as the representatives of, the
United States, and not personal embassa
dors coming from some little petty com
munity, living within the geographical
limits of some local name. They should,
he said, learn that their first duty was to
the Government* from which they drew
their salaries, and' whose boners they en
joyed. This talk of State rights had run
mad ; whatever necessity or occasion there
had been for it in the past had disap
peared. ..,-â  *.''â¢'. . 'â¢â¢â ., Â'
Thomas (R.) of Michigan, who joined
Mr. Walker in recommending that the
contestant Yost be seated, followed in a
brief speech supporting that position.
Thomas was followed by Walker (R.) of
Massachusetts,' wbo spoke in favor of the
majority report, and Taylor (R.) of Ohio
and Lacey (R.) of lowa in opposition.
Brumm (R.) of Pennsylvania and Thorp
(R.) of Virginia, of : whom the latter was
seated at the last session of Congress by
the unanimous report of the committee
which examined the pending .contest,
briefly argued that the contestant was en
titled to bis seat. _' â¢.'
The next speaker was tbe contestee.
Tucker (D.) of Virginia, who was accorded
but fifteen minutes for the presentation
of his views. He began by paraphrasing
St. Paul, accounting himself fortunate
that be was called upon this day to an
swer before the House touching ail those
things whereof he' was accused. Unless
the gentlemen had made up their minds,
he said, they must yield to the force of
the statements he would make from the
record. First, as to the imperfect ballots,
it was considered by many the pivotal
point in the case, and the statement was
made that if these were counted he would
be elected. He denied it. If every one of
them was counted ..,' for .Yost,. "Tucker
said, he (Tucker) would still have a ma
jority of 36. '
The charge that a conspiracy, existed
between election officers in the district to
destroy imperfect ballots, about which so
much had ' been said by the gentleman
from Ohio (Grosvenor), Tucker declared
to be without foundation.
j] The concluding speech in behalf of the
contestant was made by.. Walker (R.) of
Virginia, who supported the minority re
port, | He | made ja . vigorous attack upon
political conditions . in Virginia. He had
no personal objection otherwise to the
contest in this case, but upon the policy
of the party he represented he would wage
bitter, relenting and unceasing warfare.
He was glad to take this opportunity in
tbis public place to enter his indignant
protest against the most unrighteous sys
tem of laws and elections that had every
disgraced any people or any State. These
laws were enacted upon the central idea
of making fraud and deception easy and
of hoodwinking the illiterate voters.
Their execution was intrusted to men who
hesitated at nothing to accomplish their
nefarious purpose. This criticism upon
the election laws and methods of the
State was in accordance with the senti
ment of leading Democrats and Demo
cratic papers who had gone much farther
in denouncing them than he had, declar
ing them to be the embodiment of petty
larceny. â  â  '"v^. : .ipp-^ ; i; ". â  ' ."'r.?.'
Walker addressed himself then to the
consideration of the law as applied to the
imperfect ballots, holding that they should
have been counted. If they were counted,
be asserted, Yost's majority,' as shown by
the report of the committee, would have
been 161.
The argument was closed by McCall (R.)
of Massachusetts, chairman of the com
mittee which had reported in favor of the
contestee, | Tucker. He referred to some
of tbe statements made yesterday by his
"mathematical friend"* from Ohio (Gros
venor), one of which was as to the disposi
tion ofthe cases brought before the com
mittee. It had acted upon _ fifteen crises,
and in tbree of tbem had reported in favor
of unseating Democratic members. The
present House, with the largest Repub
lican majority on the] rolicail ever held by
any party in the history of the country,
would seat more mem Ders, increasing that
phenomenal majority more than any
House since the adoption of the consti
tution.' " -; v ;; ' ; *
At 4:40 o'clock the vote was taken on
the resolution declaring Mr. Yost entitled
to his seat as tbe Representative in the,
Fifty-fourth Congress from the Tenth Dis
trict of Virginia. The rolicail proceeded
amid repressed . excitement, for it was
seen that the vote would be close. The
vote was stated to beâ ayes 119, noes '.127,
Thomas (R.) of Michigan, before the an
nouncement of -the- result was made,
changing from aye to no. The Democrats
voted solidly against the resolution, and
the following Republicans joined them: ,\
Acheson, Adams, Arnold (Pa), Bennett,
Blue, Broderick,' Codding, Coffin, Cooke (111.),
Corliss, Draper, Fletcher, Gillett (N. V.), Gil
lett (Mass.), Griswold, Hartman, Henry
(Conn.), Hill (Conn.), Hooker, Hulick, Jenkins,
Kerr, Leiseorlng, Leonard, Loud. Loudens
lager, McCall (Mass.), McEwsn, Meiklejohn,
Mercer, Moody, Overstreet, Parker, .Phillips,
Pitney, Poole, Fowers, Quigg, Reyburn, Scran
ton, Shafroth, Shannon, Sherman, Slmpkins,
Smith (111.), Southard, Southwick, Taft,
Thomas, Towne, Wadsworth, Wanger, Wilson
(Idaho).
Thomas' purpose in changing bis vote
was revealed by his moving to reconsider
the vote just taken. McCall (R.) of Mas
sachusetts and Hepburn (R.) of lowa si
multaneously addressed tbe chair. The
former moved to lay Thomas' motion on
the table, and the latter to adjourn.
Hepburn was recognized, and a rolicail
was taken on the motion to adjourn. The
house refused (112 to 121) to adjourn, and
the vote recurred on the motion by Mc-
Call to lay on the table Thomas' motion
to reconsider the vote by which Yost was
declared to be entitled to his seat. It re
sulted: 120 noes, 105 ayes.
Hepburn moved to recommit the reso
lution reported by the committee declar
ing Tucker to be entitled to retain his
seat. The motion was lost by a vote of 13
to 115. Nearly all the members favoring
Yost had left the hall. i' -
Hepburn made the point of no quorum.
The Speaker decided the point overruled.
The question was then put on the passage
of the resolution, resulting in a di
vision. . â 
Again Hepburn made the point that no
quorum had voted and again the Speaker
overruled the point, suggesting, however,
that the. point that no quorum was pres
ent could be made. This was done by
Hepburn and the Speaker counted tbe
House, reporting 150 present, not a quor
rum. â "; Under the rules a call of the House
was considered ordered in connection with
the vole on the Question. The doors were
closed and the sergeant-at-arms was in
structed to bring in the absentees. . The
rolicail revealed the presence of 180 mem
bers, more than a quorum. The vote re
sulted, ayes 119, noes 47, and the resolu
tion was passed. ,
The formal motion to reconsider and to
lay that motion on the table was agreed
to,* and at 6:30 o'clock on motion of McCall
the House adjourned.

FRESNO FARMERS' INSTITUTE.
Instruct/re Addresses by Scientific Men
Mark the C/oss of a Highly
Successful Session.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 21.â The Fresno
County Farmers' Institute convened at
Malaga this morning with a much larger
attendance than was had yesterday. The
day's programme proved as successful as
did that of the day before and the farmers
are much pleased with the results of the
two days' session. They have , learned
much from the lectures of the university
professors on what has been accomplished
by science in the an of farming and many
were surprised to learn what college pro
fessors knew of the business.
The first on tbe programme this morn
ing was a talk by Professor Loughbridge
of the College of Agriculture at Berkeley
on "The Use of Fertilizers."
Farmers in this new country have not
yet had occasion to study this important
subject, but. they realize that the time is
now at hand when they must give it some
attention. For this reason Professor
Loughbridge's intelligent and instructive
address was well received. Educated by
the results of the professor's studies and
experiments tbe farmers will undoubtedly
be in much better position to fertilize
their lands advantageously.
A. P. Hayne made an address on "Vine
Disease," which was, of course, a subject
of absorbing interest to the vineyardists.
He discussed the subject in its various
phases and from a standpoint of experi
ence and study. Fresno vineyardists have
thus far in the history of "the industry
escaped any general disease.
They dread it none tie less, however,
and evinced an eagerness to gain knowl
edge concerning it so that they may be
better prepared if the disease should show
itself.
The last on the programme was a talk
on "Good Roads," by Mr. Irwin, Stale
Commissioner of Public . Highways, lt
was favorably received and his ideas for
the betterment of the public thorough
fares were giv n the warm indorsement of
the farmers. This closed the session of
the institute, which has been highly suc
cessful indeed. That this movement by
the State University is a commendable
one was evidenced to a marked degree by
the way the Fresno County farmers re
ceived it. .
KLAMATH FALLS TRAGEDY.
Town Marshal Cordon Kills Tom McKay, a
Noted Character. Who Was Look.ng
for Trouble.
KLAMATH FALLS, Or., Jan. ILâ Tom
McKay, a noted character in this section,
was shot and instantly killed by Newt
Gordon, Town Marshal, about 4 o'clock
this morning. Gordon and Charles D.
Wilson, a saloon-keeper, were stand me in
front of the Linkville Hotel, when McKay,
who was intoxicated, accused Wilson of
talking about bis family. McKay started
for Wilson, saying he would cut his giz
zard out. He struck Wilson and knocked
him over against the building. McKay

DISASTROUS FIRE AT PORTLAND.
Large Warehouse of C. F. Weber & Co
Destroyedâ Loss About $200,000.
Fully Insnred.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 2Lâ At 8 o'clock
this morning the warehouse of C. F.
Weber & Co. on Pettygrove street was
totally destroyed by fire. The evening
papers fix the loss at $200,000, but further
inquiry . reduces it 10 per cent of that
figure. The stock and building were also
insured, but the amount of the insurance
for the same reason could not be learned.
All the policies are held by San Francisco
agencies, where the headquarters of the
firm are located. It is estimated that the
loss on tbe stock will reach $20,000, and
perhaps more. Nothing was saved, and
even books, - correspondence and other
records of the firm that bad not been
placed in the safes and wbich cannot be
replaced were destroyed. The origin of
the tire is a mystery.

pled with the man, intending to hold him
until an officer could be called, but the
thief broke from his grasp and ran. Mi
chael then pulled a pistol and fired three
shots without effect at the fugitive, who
tamed up an alley and escaped. The
shooting, which took place on the prin

FAY ACQUITTED,
AT BAKERSFIELD
The Jury Takes but Five
Minutes to Reach a
Verdict.

No Criminal latent Is. Shown
and the Public Generally
jls Pleased. â¢
Moss-Covered Indictments Against Ex-
County Clerk Packard Sum
marily Dismissed.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Jan. 21.-The
trial of District Attorney Fay on an action
to remove him from office preferred by
the Grand Jury in the early part of 1896.
alleging that he had .embezzled certain
school-land fees to the amount of over
$600, was concluded here to-day, after oc
cupying the attention of the court for two
days, with a verdict of not guilty, requir
ing only five minutes for the jury to Re
turn its verdict,.
. Judge-W. M. Conley of Madera presided
and in his charge to the jury he made
plain and forcible the point that it was
the jury's duty to find whether the de
fendant appropriated the money with in
tent to willfully defraud the county and if
so to render a verdict, of guilty, if not to
j acquit him.
j Jesse Hardesty. of the Attorney-Gen-
eral's office represented the people and a
local firm the defendant. Fay openly
claimed that he appropriated the fees in
question to his own use, but aid so be
lieving that he was entitled to them under
the law governing his office.
He said^that he had consulted with
other District Attorneys in the State and
also other eminent counsel, and tbey were
also of the opinion that he bad* a right to
the fees, though the court refused to ad.
Mit this testimony. Fay stated on the
stand that he and the Attorney-General
differed od the subject and that he had so
told the Grand Jury that returned the in
dictment against him. The Attorney-
General filed an opinion with the Grand
Jury.
No one here believes that Fay nad any
criminal intent when he kept the fees, and
therefore the verdict meets with general
approval.
The last of the indictments of the noto
rious lon..- Grand Jury of two years ago
are now coming before the court to be
beard. Judge W. M. Conley of Madera is
trying them, in view of Judge Mahon
having had connection with the cases as
counsel before be took office.
The first were called this afternoon.
They were those against ex-County Clerk
N. R. Packard. They were four of them,
and they were returned solely upon the
evidence of Grand Jury's expert, Edgar
Moore oi Los An eles, who made many
thousands of dollars out of the county for
his alleged expert services. The whole
four cases possibly involve $20 no more.
These indictments allege \ mat, Packard
embezzled f<-es of tbe office to this amount.
They have been hanging fire in the court
for over' two years, during which time
Packard has been anxious for them to
come to trial.
When the first one was called up it was
shown that Packard bad the Treasurer's
receipt for the amount alleged to be in
volved, and the court immediately dis
missed the charge.
The next one was submitted on the
ground that it was a misdemeanor and
the court therefore* had no jurisdiction,
and the other two were also submitted on
the ground that defendant had a right to
such fees under the laV. The court will
pass upon them to-morrow and the gen
eral belief is that he will likewise dismiss
them.
Packard is one of the oldest and most
honored citizens of this county and nat
urally he has felt the stigma having
criminal indictments banking over bim
all these years. However, he and his
friends have never had the least doubt as
to the outcome. On his own application
Expert Moore is quartered at the jail, not
caring, it is said, to appear on the streets
after the complete refulal of all his
charges against prominent citizens.

DEVILS AT PACIFIC GROVE.
Strange Hallucination That Lands a
Salvationist in Agnews.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Jan. 21.â J.
Cunningham, a resident of this place, was
to-day committed to Agnews Insane Asy
lum. Cunningham's case is a strange one,
and to a degree bis collapse was sudden,
though many of his friends have noticed
signs of mental derangement for some
time past. He was an ardent worker in
the local Salvation Army corps and car
ried his zeal almost to the point of fanati
cism. At times he would conceive the
idea that it was impossible for him to be
"good" and do right . and would give up
trying, feeling that evil spirits so beset
bim that their influence would counteract
all his efforts against them. This delu
sion only lasted a short time, however,
and he would soon regain his normal
state of mind.
Last week, while he was at work at
, Stewart's ranch, about twelve miles from
this rlace, one of "the devil spells," as be
called them, came upon him, and it
seemed impossible^ for htm to shake it oft.
Stewart, his employer, who is also a mem
ber of the Salvation Army,, tried to reason
with and persuade Cunningham, but
words were useless, and suddenly Cun
ningham began to cry that devils were
after him, tor he could see tbem, and
.starting at a run . came ail the twelve
miles to Pacific Grove without chancing
his pace. When be reached this place he
had become so violent that it was neces
sary to confine him. There has been no
improvement in his condition since then.
His case is deemed hopeless.

were objectionable to some of the passen

behave himself or get off the car.
Then Sherman flashed bis muderous

A BIG HOLE IN HIS HEAD
It was a fearful accident which occurred
in Oakland yesterday, and it goes to prove
that carelessness is as dangerous as dissi-
pation, indulgences, excesses and abuses.
A big hole in a man's head is sometimes
easily patched up provided the individual
has been in good health and has not
abused himself or dissipated. There are
hundreds of men, however, who never can
recover because they have misused them-
selves in a variety of ways in early life.
You cannot stay out all night, drink a
barrel of whisky and continue to abuse
yourself and retain your good health.
If you have indulged in any of these
forms of abuses the sure and speedy cure
is the great "HUDYAN" remedy treat-
ment "HUDYAN" cures nervous de-
bility, neurasthenia, melancholia and the
diseases and disabilities of man. "HUD-
YAN" has been used as a remedy treat-
ment by the great doctors of the Hud -on
â¢Medical Institute for many, many years;
and has been so perfected now that it is
absolutely certain to cure. If you have
not read the testimonials about "HUD-
YAN,",or if you have not read tbe circu-

BLOOD POISON.
It is certainly not known to the laity,
though it is true, that blood poison in its ,
first, secondary and tertiary state, if not
properly cured, will be carried down from
father to son. After three or four genera-
tions blood poison ends in scrofula, malig-
nant cancers, etc. You have : a body to
protect, young man, and you owe it to
yourself and to your children to be per-
manently and skillfully cured of blood
poi-on. If you are suffering from blood
poison, if you notice falling hair, glandu-
lar lumps on the tongue, lumps on the
back of the neck, sores, sore throat, loosen-
ing teeth, copper-colored spots on the
body, consult the great doctors of the
Hudson Medical Institute about their 30-
-day cure. The 30-day cure is certainâ
30-day cure is positive. If you are ..not

5 THE CALL SPEAKS TOR AllOREGON HOW HAS
TWO ASSEMBLIES
One Permanently Organizsd
and the Other Only
Temporarily.
Neither Will Be Recognized by
the Senate, the Governor or
Secretary of State.
An Interesting Political Complication
Creating a Great Diversity
of Opinion-.
SALEM, Ob., Jan. 21.â The Houre met
to-day at 9:30 o'clock with the same result
as yesterday. Before adjournment was
taken, however, notice was given that an
attempt would be made to organize with
those present, although not two-thirds as
the constitution seems to demand. The
constitution of Oregon reads:
Two-thirds of each House shall constitute a
quorum to do business, but a smaller number
may meet and adjourn from day to day and
â¢ compel the attendance of absent members.
Senator Mitchell telegraphed to George
F. Hoar:
Can the House organize permanently, a ma
jority only being present, and can such House j
electa Senator and lawfully do other legis
lative business, provided two-thirds of such
majority is present?
H< ar replied:
I think two-thirds of thÂ« number actually
qualified make a good constitutional quorum.
If only thirty-five qualify they may organize
and lawfully do business. The same question
and principle was settled. in the National
House and Senate in the time of the Rebellion.
The House met again at 2 p.m. and a
rolicail showed thirty- three present. The
room was packed with an excited crowd,
as it was generally known that an attempt
to organize with a majority, instead of by
two-thirds of the membership, would be
made.
When temporary Chairman Davis called
the House to order Brown of' Morrow
moved that they proceed to form a tem
porary organization by calling Smith of
Marion to the chair.
Representative Riddle rose and pro
tested against the attempt to organize in
this way, and read an opinion from Hon.
George H. Williams of Portland, saying
that any attempt to organize without two
thirds of the members-elect would be in
direct violation of the constitution.
When Smith tooK the chair Thomas
read the report of the committee on cre
dentials. Then Chief Justice Moore was
sent for and swore in thirty-one members
of the sixty who were present, This done,
Benson of Josephine was proposed for per
manent Speaker, and having received 28
votes was declared duly elected.
On taking the --hair by the side of Davis
the House proceeded to elect officers, and
when sworn the House adjourned until
10 o'clock to-morrow.
Thus Oregon at present has two houses,
one organized temporarily and no doubt
legally, and the other permanently and
possibly illegally. Whether the proceed
ings to-day will stand the test of law is a
matter on which there is a great diversity
of opinion, lt is contended that it will
neither be recognized by the Senate, the
Governor or Secretary of State. If that
be so, all the work of to-day will be of no
effect.
The retirement of Riddle from the
House and the declination of another
member all along for Mitchell, shows if
these men are sincere that the Senator
will fall one vote short of election, even
if the organization of to-day should prove
to be constitutional and permanent
To-morrow morning's session will prob
ably reveal some new developments.
TBREE BALLOTS AT OLTMFIA.
But No Senator Is Chosen and the Situa-
tion la Unchanged.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 2Lâ Three bal
lots were taken in joint session to-day,
but there was no election of Senator. The
Situation has changed but little, though
the Turner men are still confident of ulti
mate success. Cline is developing more
strength. He is personally responsible
forthe statement that a Senator will be
chosen on Saturday. Who he will be he
refused to say. _____JB
The sixth vote of tbe session and the
last one to-day resulted: Turner 24, Denny
26, Squire 4, Cline 16, Daniels 14, Winsor
9, scattering 19.
The Turner men were anxious for con
tinual balloting to-day, but after three
ballots the others secured an . adjourn
ment The Turner men have issued a call
for a caucus, to te signed by fifty-seven
persons, forty-three to control the caucus,
and are confident they have this many
votes. â 
It is said to-night that a nnmber of
Populists want to go to Turner, but dare
not go in a bunch, and from now on a few
will go to him each day. It is also said
that Senator Wilson is bringing all forces
possible to bear to prevent the election of
Turner, as it will kill him for two years
from now.
The Pom-lists are still Insisting hard
that only a middle-of-the-road man should
be elected, but tbere are enough Populists
who will stand by Turner to prevent that.
The House to-day turned Governor
Rogers down. In his message be called
attention to irregularities in penitentiary
affairs at Walla Walla and asked for an
investigation. Yesterday he sent a bill to
the Hou't? to .ive him power to appoint a
committee to investigate. The House ob
jected, saying the investigating committee
shauld come from the Legislature, and de
feated the bill bv -i good majority. This
is the first time anything from the Gov
ernor has come before them, aud their re
fusal to stand by him is an indication of
their temperament _
DEL AX IN DU ROTS' TOR.
Will Be Elected, Unless the Populists
Soon Unite.
BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 21.â Two ballots
were to-day taken in the State Legislature
lor United States Senator. On the first
Ballentyne receive^ 28 Votes, Dubois. 26,
T. i: Nelson (Pop.) 13, scattering 3; sec
ond ballotâ Ballentyne 26, Dubois 26, Nel
son 18.. _.v>
The Democrats submitted three names
to the Populistsâ Nelson, Lewis and Wal
tonâbut the Populists refused to combine
with tha Democrats on either, and put
themselves in the position of refusing to
elect a man (Walton) for whom on three
ballots they cast almost their entire vote.
Clagget is undoubtedly the overwhelming
choice of the Populists, and it is pretty
certain that Clagget in reality ' controls
their caucus. It is asserted that he has
ten men on a written pledge not- to per
mit the election of any other Populist.
There is a feeling abroad to-night that
if the Populists do not soon put up a man,
by the aid of the Democrats, Dubois will
be elected. It is thought that the main
Eurpose of the Democrats outside of the
legislature in working for Dubois ii to
produce, a situation, that can only be
solved by the election of a Democrat by
the aid â : of the silver Republicans, but
there is little chance of the silver Repub
licans being stampeded to a Democrat at
present. ,
Utah's Senatorial Contest Continues.
SALT LAKE, Utah; Jan. 21.â One bal
lot was taken to-day for Senator without
result. The vote stood Thatcher 21, Hen
derson 19, Rawlins 14. The Republicans
and Populists scattered their votes among
several other nominees.

Cullom Yet a Cabinet PossibilityâBur
rows Smiles for Alger-â Peace Meet
ing in tho Shenandoah.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. Lyman J.
Gage of Chicago, who was first mentioned
in these dispatches as a Cabinet possi
bility, is being seriously considered with
reference to his ability for the appoint
ment of Secretary of the Treasury. Mr.
Gage is a well-known banker, but is op
posed by some of the active Republicans
of Illinois on the ground that he is a mug
wump.
Judge Grosscup had some conversation
on the subject of Mr. Gage and the treasury
portfolio to-day. It was deemed certain
that S. M. Cullom will not be Secretary of
the Treasury. He was not a candidate for
this or any other Cabinet office, but was
considered from time to time as a possi
bility and may be offered the Department
of the Interior.. .:â¢
Senator Burrows of Michigan bad an
other interview with President-elect Mc-
Kinley to-day with reference to R. A. Alger
for Secretary of War, and left for Wash
ington apparently satisfied with his inter
view. Senator Burrows repeated his as
sertion that there were no longer any dif
ferences between Senator Sherman and
General Alger.
A delegation of Confederate soldiers
from the Valley of Virginia â Roller,
Colonel R. P. Rogers, J. P. Funkhauser
and G. W. Rickmanâ called on Major Mc-
Kinley and invited him to attend a grand
peace-meeting inthe Shenandoah Valley
next autumn. It .was proposed to have
the Union and Confederate veterans to
meet on Southern soil on that occasion.
Major McKinley will probably deliver an
address.
The Territorial delegate, N. O. Murphy
of Arizona, discussed the politics of the
Territory with Major McKinley to-day.
He said M. ri. McCord, Bert Dunlap and
Doctors Evans and Goodrich are the
prominent candidates for appointment of
Governor of the Territory. It is thought
that C. F. Ainsworth has the best chance
of being appointed Chief Justice of the
Territory.
Xo Election in South Dakota.
PIERRE, 8. Dak., Jan. 21.â The Legis
lature again met in joint session at noon
to-day and failed to elect a United States
Senator. There was but little change,
and the anticipated break has failed to
come as yet. Three Democrats, who have
been held in reserve, went to Kyle, but
his vote stood the same as yesterday, be
having lost one vote each to Loucks and
Goooykuutz and one of his men was
absent.
The vote was: Pickier 53. Kyle 33,
Loucks 15, Plowman 12, Woodykoontz 7,
scattering 3. But one ballot was taken. j

PLAINPIELD, N. J., Jan. 21.â A higher
decree than that of any court has freed
Mrs. Jennie V. Wells of matrimonial
bonds. ' She and her husband, -Robert C.
Wells, formerly lived in this city. Both
were wealthy. Three years ago her. hus
band left her and six months ago she be
gan a suit for divorce on the .round of
desertion. Three weeft . ago , Mrs. Wells
was notified at Los Angeles, Cal., where
she was spending the 'winter, that the
commissioner was ready to take evidence
in the case.
She started East immediately. When
she was on her way across the continent
news came that a man had been blown
from a train near Atlantic City and man
gled so badly as to be almost unrecogniz
able. Some things about the person,
however, led to the .belief that it was
Wells, and so it proved. Application will
now be made to have the case dismissed.

JOHN F. DE LACY'S WILL.
Judge Coffey Will , Consider a Motion
for the Revocation of the .
Instrument.
An important point in probate practice
was yesterday brought to the attention of
Judge Coffey by a brief filed by Attorney
H. E. Hiehton in the estate of John F. de
Lacy, deceased.
< The contention arises over the applica
tion of certain heirs at law of the decedent
for a revocation of the will . whereby it is
provided that many relatives are excluded
from any considerable share of the estate,
which is said to .be worth between $30,000
and $40,000. At tbe time the will was
admitted to probate satisfactory proof was
adduced as to the genuineness of the sig
natures of the testator and the witnesses.
' Mr. Highton favors the revocation of
tbe order admitting the will to ..: probate.
Among otber things be says:
De Lacy was a resident ' of San Francisco at
tbe time of his death, August 9, 1896, on board
the British steamer Gaelic, on the hlgn seas.
off tbe coast of Japan, of which steamer he
was the steward. . The instrument admitted to
probate is claimed to have been executed and
declared, in the presence of two witnesses/
both of wbom are alleged in the petition for
probate to be residents of San Francisco. '
There is no attestation clause at the end- ot
the will, and its admission, to probate rested
solely on the proof that the testator was of
sound mind; that his signature and the sig
natures of the attesting witnesses were
genuine, and that the witnesses at the time of
the hearing were beyond the jurisdiction of
the court. On this proof it is claimed that
under the law the will was duly executed and
declared with , every formality prescribed by
the statute.
Mr. High ton here sets forth the requi
sites established by the code to the due
execution of a will, namely, the signing
by the maker of the will or by some
authorized by him; that it be signed. in
the pre-ence of the witnesses or acknowl
edged before them; that at the time of
the subscription or acknowledgment the
testator must declare to the attesting wit
nesses that the instrument is bis will,
and that the two attesting witnesses must
sign their names at the end of the will at
the testator's request and in his presence.
Mr. Highton continues: .
Now, on this state of the law and by the ap
plication of the doctrine of .presumption, it is
insisted that the bare signatures ot the Tes
tator and the witnesses, and evidence of com
petency In the testator, prove every fact
necessary in the absence of contradictory tes
timony to establish the will was duly executed
and duly declared and witnessed.
On principle and apart from authority, and
balancing the possible argument pro and con,
it would seem to be most dangerous to uphold
this contention, which surely conflicts with
the ordinary rule, where statutory require
ments have to be observed, and especially in
view of tbe fact that a will is not helped
by the common law, but depends, for its
validity upon substantial compliance with the
statute. â¢'.."'. ".'*â â¢.''.' "': : ':t:
After quoting the provisions of the code
and certain decisions and other authori
ties, including the requirement for the
taking of depositions 01 absent witnesses,
Mr. Highton contends that the deposi
tions of these witnesses have not been but
may be taken; that neither of them is
shown to be dead or ' insane ; it is not im
possible to obtain their testimony and
they have not removed beyond the juris
diction. The brief says:
The generalizations are qualified and per
haps completed by other generalizations from
the books, and it would be as unsafe to rely
conclusively on the quotations here presented
as it would be to rely on the dictum of Justice
Field, in Itself entitled to great respect, in a
case where, if I understand it, both witnesses
were dead.
Mr. Hiehton quotes from the decision
of the California Supreme Court in the
estate of Cartery (56 Cal., 472), where it is
set forth that the right in make testa
mentary disposition of property is not an
inherent right, but rests wholly on the
legislative will. In conferring that right
the Legislature bas seen fit to prescribe
certain exactions and requirements look
ing to tba execution and authentication of
the instrument, and a compliance with
these becomes necessary to its exercise.
In view of these matters, Mr. Highton
concludes as follows:
I respectfully submit that every conceiv
able and available kind of evidence should be
exhausted before so flimsy a substitute for
ordinary proof should be accepted. Ami on
tbe citations presented, and on the facts of
this record, it may be claimed, 1 think, that
reason and authority concur in support of the
motion.
Judge Coffey has promised' the attor
neys to take up the matter at an early
day. He suggested that if the subscribing
witnesses are really in this City, it may
be deemed better for the proponent of the
will to secure their attendance in court.
By tbat method the question of the sign
ing an dpublication of the will may be in
quired into in a manner satisfactory alike
to tne court and all others concerned.
SHOT HIMSELF IN A PARK
Robert Harris Ends. His Life
A ter Losing Mcney on
the Races.
Discovered by Two B cycle Riders
and Removed to the Hospital
. to Die.
. Though but 21 years of age young
Robert Harris, rinding that fortune cast
him aside at the . race course, ended his
life last night at 11:30 o'clock by shooting
himself through the head. He sought a
public place.
Jefferson square, Gou.h street and
Golden Gate avenue, and walking out
onto a grass plat drew the weapon and
fired. Two young men who were passing
the square on a tandem heard the shot,
and, surmising that a life had been ended,
notified Officer Rooker.
The two returned to the park and after
a short search found the young man lying
face down on the grass. They turned him
over and found the brains oozing through
a hole iii bis forehead. The ambulance
was summoned and the dying man was
removed to the Receiving Hospital.
He died but a few moments after reach
ing the hospital and his body was removed
to the Morgue. Young Harris resided
with his aunt, Mrs. McQuarrie, at 324
O'Farrell street. He was going to school
in this City and was supplied with money
by bis mother, who lives on a farm above
Chico. y_lfi____-Ml___J_l
Mrs. McQnarrie said last evening that
ber nephew left her house with some
friends to go to the races last Monday
evening and . bad not been home since.
He took all his money and jewelry with
him. His aunt is of the opinion that he
lost his money on the races, and fearful
that his mother would discover his loss
and rebuke bim, became despondent and
ended bis life.
LARGE STREET WORK.
Contracts for Polk-Street Gradingâ The
Boole varding of Taa Ness Avenue .
'Considered.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors had a lively session yester
day. The first matter brought up was
tne petition of the Polk-street Improve
ment Club for the illumination of the
blocks between Broadway and Lewis
street, in the order declaring Van Ness
avenue a boulevard. ; This was favored by
James Den man; Chairman Devany and
Supervisor Sheehan opposed it. Super
visor Sheehan said that a wealthy prop
erty-owner had agreed to do the necessary
grading to connect Van Ness avenue with
Black Point, and that Mayor Phelan was
interested in the boulevard system which
board is pledged to carry out. On
motion of Supervisor Sheehan the peti
tion was denied. ,
It was decided to recommend that a
contract be awarded to Warren & , Malley
to grade Polk street, between Greenwich
and Lombard, the contract price being 33
cents per cubic yard. It was also decided
to recommend to award to J. W. McDon
ald the contract for the paving of Bran
nan street, between Ninth and Tenth.
The petition for the bituminizing of Lom
bard street, from Van Ness avenue to the
Presidio, went over for one week, prop
erty-owners appearing to favor macadam
instead of bitumen. ; 5 v
Herbert Law of the Van Ness Avenue
Improvement Club said that he. would be
satisfied with macadam.
Ji Mrs. Minna Foest, who lives on the cor
ner of Railroad avenue south and Eight
eenth street, appeared vto ask that John
Kelso might ,be 'â ;. prevented from blasting
near her home. She said that sue had
been \ so ! frightened by bowlders thrown
through the side of her home and through
her barn and showers of lesser stones fall
ing in her yard and killing her chickens
that she bad lost her health and had heart
disease. She grew much: excited before
the committee. : Mr. Kelso told about the
blasting. ..'â¢>.â *â . '^ V. .--
The committee decided to recommend
that he should pet new bondsmen and
that he should pay Mrs. Foest's expenses

that he should also repair all damages

BALDWIN RAFTERS
RING ONCE AGAIN
Another Evening With
Madame Nordica and
Her Troupe-
Preliminary Numbers More
Warmly Received Than
Scenes From Opera.
The Last Act From "Ii Trovatore"
Well and V ry Effectively
Rendered
The second Nordica-Scalcbi concert took
place at the Baldwin Theater last night
and brought together an even larger au
dience than that of the opening concert
As before, every seat was occupied, but
there was a larger - number of people
standing who were unable to procure
seats. There was almost as much toilette
display as on Monday and the big theater
hat Was delightfully conspicuous by its
absence.
A rather singular feature of these con
certs is that the audience manifests in
finitely more satisfaction and delight over
the miscellaneous portion of the pro
gramme than over the operatic act which
brings them to a close. This is the more
remarkable as both . Nordica and Scalchi
are remarkable for tneir skill as actresses.
The miscellaneous part of the pro
gramme last night opened with the over
ture by Chorubini, "The Water Carriers,"
which was agreeably played by the orches
tra conducted by Isadore Lucksione. All
through the concert Mr. Luckstone did
unostentatious but very efficient service
by bis sympathetic accompaniment.
J. C. Dempsey, the baritone basso of the
organization, was the first vocalist to ap
pear and was very warmly greeted. " .:â /
--' He sang Handel's "Honor and Arms,"
whicii abounds with that florid vocaliza
tion witb which Handel delighted to tax
the abilities of a singer. Mr. Dempsey
was equal to the occasion, however, for he
performed all the runs and turns with a
smoothness and ease which did credit to
his act. There was a lack of the breadth
and majesty of true oratorio style about his
interpretation of "Honor and Arms," but
it is only a carping public that demands
! everything, and the public last night was
so pleased withDempsey's finished vocali
zation that it gave him quite an ovation
and would not be satisfied till be had sung
again. The singer gave a quaint Irish
ditty, "Off to Philadelphia," and sang it
in the daintiest possible way.
Mme. Scalchi, who was rapturously re
ceived, sane the recitation and aria from
Clock's "Orpheo," in which Orpheus
laments over his lost wife.
Her interpretation of the beautiful reci
tation, "Sposal Euradice!" was a mag
nificent piece of dramatic singing, and her
rendering of the aria, "Che Faro Senza
Euradice," was a treat to lovers of this
lovely air which age , and constant use
never seem to stale. Here and there
Scalchi's notes sounded worn in the "che
faro," but this effect was only momentary
and was more than atoned for by her ar
tistic interpretation and by her rich low
notes. . '* :
Of course the audience would not let
her go without an encore, and after she
bad sunt' Gounod's "Mandolinata" charm
ingly, still another encore was demanded
and'she gave "Annie Laurie" with a repe
tition of Monday night's success.
. Barron Berthold, the tenor, has evi
dently not studied those "nods ana becks
and wreathed smiles" and other littl
mannerisms wherewith lyric artists so
frequently seek to enhance their popular
ity with the public; in fact, his platform
manner is almost brusque.
He dashed on the stage in a way that
caused a politely subdued little titter last
night, and when his aria from Verdi's "I
Lombard brought him a decided en
core he seemed surprised and a little
aggrieved, though he responded gracefully
enough with Clay's "I'll Sing Thee Songs
of Araby." It is a pity to see so much
fine material as lies in Mr. Berthold's
voice going to waste, so to speak,
for want of a more intelligent
way of using it. The voice is
there, and a good deal of dramatic in
stinct are there also, but Berthold's
throaty way of producing bis tones mars
what would otherwise be good work. One
can pardon even throatiness, but for a
tenor to indulge in unmixed falsetto, even
though it be but one note, is unpardon
able in a lyric artist of Berthold's fame;
and that is what he did at .the end of "I'll
Sing Thee Songs of Araby."
Nordica received a great ovation on her
appearance. All through the performance
the numbers she sang were better calcu
lated to win her applause than those she
gave on Monday â dramatic qualities
of ber voice were more in evidence i and
the thinness of her upper tones was not so
apparent. Nordica deserved every band
clap and every "bravo!" she received for
her rendering of , "Dich Theure Halle,"
from "Tannhauser."
She was magnificiently dramatic in ncr
interpretation, and her voice rang out
rich and clear, and without the straining
and effort that marked the Hungarian
aria she gave on Monday.
Of course, an encore was demanded, and
Nordica sang Foerster's "Ich Lie be Dich"
in a broad and spirited style. The audi
ence was not satisfied then, however, so
she obligingly reappeared and sang "Robin
Adair" as effectively as Scalchi had sung
"Annie Laurie."
The last actof "II Trovatore" closed the
performance. As Leonora, - Nordica was
much more in her element, vocally speak
ing, than she was on Monday as Mar
guerite. The miserere scene was most
dramatically sung and, acted,, and yet,
strange to say, the audience took it all
coldly. Dempsey as the Count di Luna
was not in hid element; he was cot dra
matic enough, and showed absolutely no
ability for singing recitative. '..
In the prison scene Scalchi and Bertnold
were clamorously encored for the duet,
"Ai Nos tri Monti," though truth to say
It was Scalchi's dramatic singing that won
the encores. â¢ â¢ '
The next concert 'â  will be - to-morrow,
afternoon, and the farewell concert will
take place on Sunday night.' â¢'
GERM THEOEY OF DISEASE.
The Cause and the Care for Almost Any
Form of Ailment.
The medical world now pretty generally
accepts the' "germ theory of disease as
discovered by M. Pasteur and many other
eminent savants whose distinguished ser
vices to science have been of incalculable
value to humanity. Since, therefore, the
cause of - all disease, according to tbe
scientists of late years, is due to microbes,
a H remedy for the â¢ destruction of such
germs is the more direct way to deal with
the greater number of all ailments.
Radam's Microbe i Killer ?in reality is
nothing more than ' pure water heavily
charged with gases destructive to all dis
ease .germs 'â  and is perfectly ? harmless to
humanity. It is * considered â  among - the
most wonderful curatives for almost any
form of disease." ;

LOUGHEAD WILL RIDE.
Champion Canadian Cycler to
Appear at the Velodrome
To- Mor row. '
Downing Has Er'ered the Competitive
Events and Z egl?r May Ride *
an [Exhibition-
Chief Consul Kerrigan and the others
who have charge of the League of Amer
ican Wheelmen's benefit cycle meet, to be
held at the Velodrome to-morrow afttr
noon, have been striving all the week to
add to the already strong list of attrac
tions to be presented by securing others.
As a result Fred J. Longhead, the cham
pion of Canada, and who ranks fifth in the
percentage table of all the racers of Amer
ica, one point ahead of Ziegler, has agreed
to ride an exhibition mile; Hardy Down
ing, San Jose's favorite, will compete in
the one-third mile scratch professional
race, and the probabilities are that Otto
Ziegler Jr. himself will ride an exhibi
tion.
* C. 8. Wells, "Bob" Terrill, Trainer Dave
Shp.fer and the others who have been in
San Jose the forepart of this week prepar
ing for the big meet to be held there to
day by the Garden City Cyclers, have been
largely instrumental in securing these
men to ride and they have done good
work, as Loughead, Downing and Ziegler
are star attractions.; The former only ar
rived here last Saturday, but he has found
the climate agrees with him, and after a
few preliminary spina he ! was able to fol
low pace at such a rate that his trainer,
Mr. Shafer, concluded that although not
in the best of form, he would matte a
creditable showing, and he and Loughead
willingly consented the request to ride,
as ' also did Hardy downing. Ziegler â¢is
not quite so sure of his condition, and has
been backward about appearing before a
California audience, and particularly in
San Francisco, until he was at his best. If
he rides in ; anything like his proper style
a: the San Jose meet to-day he will surely
be seen here to-morrow.
These are splendid additions to what
was already a long and attractive pro
gramme best ever presented here, it
is said. The advance sale of seats has
been phenomenally large and a big crowd
is expected. The .proceeds all go to the
North California division, League of
American Wheelmen.
There will be two amateur events, in
which the entries are so numerous that
each has to be divided into six beats, and
two professional events almost as equally
well filled. Then there is the Velodrome
shield race between C. E. Dow of Seattle
and D. E. Whitman of . Los Angeles, and
as the winner of tbe shield this time has
the prospect of - holding ' it unmolested
until February 22 the race can be relied
upon to be hotly contested. These events
would constitute a more than ordinarily
fine programme, and with the addition of
Loughead, Downing and Ziegler there is
little to be wished * "^W^llmVmWr^aW
r- * The races are to start promptly at 2
o'clock, as the long programme will take
some time. Reserved, seats can .be had
after ','â l2', o'clock to-day ,at Sherman &
Clay's and after 12 o'clock to-morrow at
the track.,
' ; The bicycle baggage bill has been re
ported* favorably upon .by the Judiciary
Committee of the Legislature and the
chances for its â  passage ?: are : favorable.
The -League - : of American '. Wheelmen .is
supporting the measure and Charles A. ,
Adams and Percy V. Long are at Sacra
mento attending to its interests.

THE BAKEE MONUMENT.
Our esteemed contemporary the Evening
Post declares the demand for the passage of
a bill by the present Legislature appropri
ating ?15,000 for the erection of a monu
ment to Senator Baker brings up for
discussion what it calls "an interesting
question concerning memorials to great
men." While the Post does not state
directly what this interesting question is,
it implies by innuendo that it is a ques
tion whether such monuments should be
erected at all.
The point raised is somewhat in the na
ture of a scoop. We are not aware that
any such question existed in the minds of
intelligent men. We knew of course that
some races have not erected memorials to
great men, but they have been races with
out a trace of civilization. There has been
no cultured people, and certainly no na
tion of any eminence in history, that has
not erected such monuments.
The Pott by innuendo implies that the
monument to Senator Baker would be "a
brazen monstrosity to scowl unborn gen
erations out of countenance." It may be,
therefore, that the question which it calls
interesting Is simply one of artistic ac
complishment and cultured taste. Pos
sibly the Post would approve of a monu
ment if it were intrusted with the work of
designing it, so that it would not be a
monstrosity. If this is tbe question in
the mind of the Post we decline to discuss
it. Matters of taste, as has been said of
old, are not to be disputed; and it is well
known that nothing has ever been done in
the way of expressing the higher senti
ments of man but what has raised the
question, "Is it art?"
On the general principle of the advisa
bility of erecting memorials to great men
there has certainly never been a question
in the minds of any civilized people.
From tbe days of earliest Egypt down to
our time such monuments nave been
erected and in every instance they are
accounted as among the best accomplish
ments of the art of the day when they
were raised. Human- genius has rarely
done better work for humanity than when
it set itself to the task of perpetuating the
memory of great men. Whether this
work of perpetuation has been wrought
out in poetry, in painting or in sculpture
matters little. The essential point is that
a large labor has been performed in the
work of educating the minds of the people
and infusing true ideas of right manhood
whenever a fitting memorial to a great
man has been made visible to the commu
nity which he served.
A monument erected to a man of the
talent, aspirations, fortunes and fate cf
Senator Baker would b?, in the fullest
sense of the word, an education to the
youth of the State. It would manifest to
them what manner of man it is that wins
most honor in his life and Is most remem
bered in death. The lessons drawn from
such monument would awaken in the
minds of young men high ideals of patriot
ism and inspire them with a true grandeur
of sentiment. It would be a'stimulus to
worthy ambition and would impress upon
the hearts of all the nobility of genius
when allied to patriotism and the heroism
of courage when directed to right ends.
In every land in the world where no
bility of character has been revered,
where true manhood has been honored,
and where distinguished service in the
cause of the State and of humanity has
been appreciated, it has been the delight
of the people to erect monuments to such
men and women as in their lives have ex
emplified these great virtues. In Cali
fornia we have developed a civilization
in complete sympathy with the highest
known to history. Our people share the
best aspirations of the best men of all the
ages. They desire to see the memory of
their great men fitly honored. They
recognize that Senator Baker was one of
those who served the State of his adoption
with a loyalty even to death, and whose
talents reflect a glory upon it. They, there
fore, ask of the Legislature that this recog
nition be made manifest to the world in a
monument of stainless marble or endur
ing bronze.
EIVAL QUABANTINES.
It is a matter of no little satisfaction to
the shipping interests of San Francisoo
that the question of precedence between
State and Federal quarantine officers at
this port has at last come to a head, and
that an issue has arisen which promises to
lead to a final settlement of the contro
versy and to close what has long been a
grievous annoyance to our commerce.
When the Umatilla arrived from Puget
Sound the United States quarantine officers
boarded her off Fort Point, and after in
specting her bills of health took sixteen
Japanese from the steerage and landed
them at Angel Island for further inspec
tion. Later on Dr. Chalmers, representing
the State quarantine, boarded the steamer,
and finding that there were no Japanese
on board as the manifest called for,
refused for a time to allow the
passengers to land. The deadlock
was eventually broken by permitting the
detained passengers to come ashore,
as a matter of courtesy, but the right was
reserved by the State Board of Health to
resist what it claims was an unwarranted
assumption of authority on the part of
the Federal officials.
It will be seen tbat in this case a direct
conflict has been raised, and until it bas
been settled the shipping interests of San
Francisco will suffer. The masters of
vessels have two sets of authorities over
them and cannot please the one without
offending the other. Such a condition of
affairs is certainly injurious to the port,
and the sooner the evil is remedied by de
termining which quarantine is supreme
the better it will be for all concerned.
The Chamber of Commerce has already
called public attention to the evil and has
urged captains and owners of vessels to
take some action which would bring the
issue to a point for determination.
Their advice simply forestalled what has
occurred. The point they Bought to raise
has been raised for them. It seems that
the controversy is now put in a position
where it can be brought fairly before the
proper authorities and the long vexed
problem solved.
Until the authorities have heard all 'the
evidence and investigated the rights of
the rival powers it would not be fair for
public sentiment to declare itself in favor
of either. -Whichever way the matter is
decided will be a benefit to the public , All
that is desired is to get rid of the conflict
now going on and to relieve our shipping
from the burdens and vexations which
the conflict imposes upon it-
A MINING COMMISSION.
A resolution has been introduced by
Senator Perkins calling for the appoint
ment of a Government : commission con
sisting of the Commissioner of the Gen
eral Land ' Office, the Commissioner ;of
Labor and tbe Director of . the Geological
Survey to determine] tbe best method of
ascertaining all the facts of ; general im
portance relating to mines and mining in
tbe United States. The commission is to
report to the; Secretary of the Interior
whether the _ mining interests could be
best served by the establishment of a mln
ng bureau, or a Secretary of Mines and
THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 1897.
Mining, and is to submit a bill providing
means for securing ail necessary informa
tion concerning mining and related indus
tries in this country.
The preamble of the resolution sets forth
very clearly the needs of such a commis
sion. Itis stated that at present the min
ing industries of the United States have
no clearly defined representation in the
Government. The statistics relating to
the industry now obtained are secured
partly by the Geological Survey, partly by
the Director of the Mint, and partly by
the General Land Office. ;It is certainly
desirable, as is stated in the resolution,
that all statistics relating to our mines
and mining should be collected by one or
ganization, and it is to effect such a re
form that the resolution of the Senator is
directed. â¢ ' â¢ Â« â¢-" -
The proposed commission will be a step
in the direction of securing the establish
ment of a Secretary of Mines and Mining.
To that extent it is commendable and will
have the approval of all the mining States.
It would seem, however, that it might
have been better to have proceeded at
once to the desired object and introduced
a resolution calling for the creation of the
much-needed office. All the arguments
which the proposed commission can gather
could be furnished at once by the mining
associations of tho various States of the
Union. The commission, therefore, can
do little more than make an official report
and summary of facts which are already
well known. . -i .
It is possible, however, that such Is the
conservatism of Congress on the subject
that Senator Perkins has acted wisely in
resorting to this preliminary step instead
of proceeding at once to the settlement of
the main issue. Any action at thi3 time
is better than none. The proposed com
mission will hardly entail much delay
and may prove of much benefit to the
project. The report which it is called on
to make will serve at any rate to set bsfore
Congress in a comprehensive manner the
prevailing confusion in our mining laws
and tbe claims which the industry has
upon the Government for a better system
of supervision. This being so, we trust
the resolution will find a cordial support
in the Senate and be adopted by both
houses of Congress before the close of the
present session.
A PAKK IMPROVEMENT.
A bill has been introduced into the
Legislature by Assemblyman Dennery to
amend the act of 18S9 providing for the
maintenance and support of public parks,
which is of interest to the people of San
Francisco, and particularly to those who
own fine horses and are fond of riding
and driving. It is a measure which will
have public approval and should have
the support of legislators from all parts of
the State. p - '
The object of the proposed amendments
is to provide a means for establishing
within the park suitable buildings for the
proper care of horses which have been
exercised on the speed track. At the
present time no such structures exist and
as a consequence a large portion of the
benefits of the speedway are lost to the
public, since drivers have at the end of
the track no suitable place to rest and
care for their horses.
The amendments proposed authorize
park commissions to erect such buildings
and structures in parks under their
charge "as will promote the comfort and
convenience of the public," but no build
ing or t group of buildings constituting
such improvement shall involve an ex
penditure of more than $20,000. The
commissions are also permitted to lease
any portion of the park, not exceeding
one acre, with the buildings or structures
thereon, for a term of not exceeding three
years. Proper conditions and safeguards
are placed around the authority thus
given to assure the public against any
injurious use of it.
The need of a suitable group of build
ings for the care of horses at the ocean
end of the speed track is known to. every
lover of riding and driving in San Fran
cisco. Some time ago a petition was laid
before the Park Commissioners asking
for the erection of such buildings, with
the Golden Gate Driving Association as
its sponsors. The petition set forth that
the park speed track, which cost nearly
$30,000, was constructed entirely through
voluntary contributions, and therefore it
would be nothing more than fair that
those who bad paid for the opening of
this splendid roadway should be provided
with the means of enjoying the full
benefit of it.
At the time the petition was submitted
a doubt was expressed whether the laws
governing public parks would permit the
erection of buildings for the use desired,
and though eminent legal authorities con
strued the law as favorable to the project,
it was thought best to make sure by wait
ing and procuring the amendments which
have been proposed. The bills introduced
are simply in tbe nature of guaranteeing
the right of the Park Commissioners to
furnish the required buildings.
There is no question but what such
structures will promote the comfort and
convenience of the public, and as the cost
of erecting them is not under any circum
stances to exceed $20,000, it seems clear
that the Legislature will have the warm
approval of the people in adopting the
amendments. '*"-"..',.'-'â

THE GENERAL AND THE PRIVATE.
One of the wittiest men in the lower House of congress is John M. Allen of the First
District of Mississippi. Mr. Allen is now serving his sixth term in Congress, and watt re-elected
last fall. . He is familiarly known as "Private" Allen, though many
people are unaware of the cause which led to the sobriquet being
fastened to his name. He was a law student in the office" of Judge
Lamar after the war, and soon after being admitted to the bar was
made District Attorney of his county. In the campaign of 1884 he
was nominated by the younger element in* his district for Congress,
'the opposing candidate being a Confederate veteran, General Tucker.'
Allen promptly challenged his antagonist to discuss the issues of
the campaign with him on the stump. The offer was accepted, and
at the first meeting the honor of opening the debate was accorded
to the senior, General Tucker. The general dwelt 1 strongly upon
his services to the Confederacy during the late unpleasantness, and
made especial reference to a battle in which he commanded on
the Confederate side. "Fellow-citizens," said he, "I slept one night
in a tent on the mountain side awaiting the battle on the morrow."
When ho had finished Allen got up and said: "Friends and fellow
citizens: It's all true what General Tucker has told you about sleep
ing in a tent the night before tho battle.* I know all about it, because
I was guarding that tent all night long in the cold and wet on
picket. And now I want to Bay to all of you who were generals in
the war and slept at night in your guarded tents like General
â Tucker, you vote for him, but all you fellows that guarded the
tents in the cold and wet like me, you vote for Private Allen."
John was elected, and has been known as "l'nvate" Allen ever since.

THE TREATY OF ARBITRATION.
New York Sun.
The various serious questions involved in the
proposed treaty of arbitration between the
United States and Great Britain must make
its ratification at the present session some
what doubtful. With fewer than fifty work
ing days remaining: and many important meas
ures demanding' attention the Senate might
have to sacrifice some of these in order to find
time for properly examining, amending and
finally deciding upon the Olney-Pauncefote
arbitration treaty. ,
There are various features of this agreement
to be weighed, among them the selection by a
European monarch of an umpire under two of
the articles of the treaty. The relations, past,
present and prospective, of England and Swe
den must, ol course, be carefully considered
under this proposed plan of accepting the
choice of the King of Sweden. There Is no
doubt, we think, that the attitude of Euro
pean Umpires in our Bering Sea dispute with
England will be reviewed in the Senate when
the treaty is discussed. The interpretation
likely to be put upon the relations of our coun
try with England under this agreement by
other European powers, particularly by Russia,
hitherto always friendly to us, will also become
a subject of study.
There need obviously be no haste in acting
upon this important treaty, because there is
no doubt that, even sho.uld there fail to be an
extra session of Congress, such as President
McKinley is fully expected to call, there will
certainly be a special session of the Senate for
i confirming executive nominations and ap
pointments, according to j custom, immedi
ately following the ceremony of inauguration.
The really urgent matter for settlement with
England, her adhesion to the Monroe doc
trine and her substitution of. fair arbitration
for force in dealing .with Venezuela, has al
ready been disposed of. That concerned ac
complished facts and known elements of con
troversy. The new. agreement, sweeping in
Its scope, and designed to be binding upon us
under conditions not foreseen,, should nat
urally be acted upon only with the greatest
deliberation. . .

AN INVENTOR MISSING,
Aa Interest Taken in the Where
; abouts of Fredrecks C.
de Prengal.
He fold Gjs Range Stock, and the
Investors Wis a They Had
Their Money Back.
There are quite a number of people , in
this City who would like to know the
whereabouts of Fredrecks C. de Prengal,
inventor, corporation president, promoter
and restaurant-keeper. This very busy
person made his appearance in this City a
little before Christmas â¢ and rented a
restaurant on Powell street, near O'Far
rell. For this he paid Mr. Davis, , the
owner of the property, a small sum of
money in advance, and that was all.
This bad beginning caused Davis to
close the place. ',:|*'r "
But De Prengal had not been idle during
the time he was in the restaurant, for he
told many persons that he was the in
ventor of a patent gas ranee that possessed
special merits. He said that he had sold
the rights to the patent for Germany, and
that he received a goodly sum of money
regularly from that country.
The plans; models, etc., of his range
showed unmistakable merits, and com
mended themselves to those who exam
ined the same. Among these were T.
Peterson, a plumber on Powell street, and
J. H. Dissmeyer, who owns a machine
shop on Twenty-sixth and Noe streets.
These men were particularly interested in
the gas range, especially when De Prengal
told them that they bad a chance to get
rich out of it, as he had not fully disposed
of the United States rights to the patent.
He told them further that a man named
Fisher in New York City had the rights
for several Eastern States, and that a
company, of which he (De Prengal) was
the president, had been incorporated in
the State of Virginia. In proof of this the
inventor showed a paper purporting to
give him full power of attorney to transact
business for the Virginia corporation.
Tbis power of attorney was signed
by De Prengal as president. This
was subsequently filed for record in the
Recorder's office. All of this talk made an
impression upon his friends, and in a
short time he had several anxious to buy
shares of the gas-range stock. One was a
milkman, who furnished milk for paper
purporting to be stock. Another built a
ranee complete and was provided with an
interest in stock. Peterson, the plumber,
also took up stock, and even Dissmeyer,
the machinist, knew agood thing when he
saw it.
The machinist now wishes that he had
not known so much. He and Prengal en
tered into a written agreement by which
in exchange for a half interest in the Pa
cific Coast rights he was to pay $2000.
Even his little shop and tools went into
the agreement. Dissmeyer was to be made
agent for the Pacific Coast, and eventually
become the general manager.
This looked so nice on paper that the
machinist gave De Prengal $412. The
promoter had other men on the string and
was making hay while the sun was out.
In the course of affairs some of these men
wanted to learn the legal aspect of the situ*
ation, and in company with De Prengal
they called upon Attorney H. U. Jones in
the Parrott building. The stock certifi
cates were produced and showed on the
face. "Prengal's Economizing Fuel Gas
Range Manufacturing Company. Incor
porated in Virginin in February, 1893."
These were signed by De Prengal, as
president, and Peterson, the plumber, as
secretary. Here was the first stumbling
block and the attorney . informed his
visitors that the stock was not worth the
paper it was printed upon. Such stock
could only be issued at the home office of
the company. The promoter's power of
attorney was of no use under such cir
cumstances. Mr. Jones refused a gift of
fifty shares from De Prengal. As may be
expected this started trouble and one
man who was about to put $5000 into the
affair suddenly changed his mind. A few
days later the investors called at De Pren
gal's room, but he had disappeared, leav
ing a part of his wardrobe.
A short time ago an unopened letter ad
dressed to De Prengal was picked up in
Aptos, Santa Cruz County. As it was in
care of Dissmeyer, the machinist, the
letter was forwarded and proved to be a
bill from Pert & Meyerdlrks, printers, on
California street, for the stock certificates
of the Virginia company. Tne printers
said that De Prengal nad the certificates
printed and that he owes a bill for $22 60.
All of tbese facts have caused a more
general desire on the part of those who
parted with their good money for Califor
nia printed corporation stock to meet the
inventor of the gas range.
Attorney Jones sent East and learned
that such a patent as described bad been
taken out by a Frederick C. de Prengal in
1594 and that William Fisher holds the
Eastern rights. :.':.'â .-'.â â '-

BAKER'S MEMORY
TO BE HONORED
; :
The Monument Project
Seems to Be an As
sured Success.
Military Organizations Prepar
ing to Address the
Legislature.
Strong utions Passed by th?
Oakland Republican Munici
pal Convention.
The introduction into the Legislature
of a bill making an approprirtion of $15,000
to erect a monument in Golden Gate Park
to the memory of Colonel E. D. Baker has
aroused the greatest enthusiasm, and the
friends of the monument project see
nothing but success ahead.
The measure was placed in charge of
Senator Stratton and Assemblyman Way
mire, -and they have already gained so
many adherents that its passage by both
branches of the Legislature is now deemed
a certainty. To make assurance doubly
sure, however, those who have been work
ing on the project are losing no opportu
nity to press its claims.
The first definite movement to raise a
fund for a monument to tne distinguished
soldier began in 1891, when the Colonel E.
D. Baser Monument Association, consist
ing of prominent firms and individuals
all over the State, was formed. Its avowed
object was to raise a sufficient sum to
erect a suitable tribute to Colonel Baker's
memory. The following were charter

Although energetic efforts were made to
raise the fund, the public did not respond
so generously as was expected, and the
money came in slowly. Then it was de
cided to appeal to the Legislature for aid,
and the bill mentioned was drafted.
It provides for three Commissioners to
take charge of the fund and see that the
monument i* of a suitable character and
the best that the appropriation will pro
viue. .1
The aim is to cain as many votes in the
Legislature as possible before. the bill
comes up for passage. The Republican
municipal convention of Oakland at its
recent meeting passed the following reso
lutions strongly commend the monu
ment scheme:
Whereas, We know that the late Colonel E.
D. Baker, the orator, statesman and soldier,
did more than any other Individual to hold
the State of California in the Union; and,
whereas, he fell at the head of a forlorn hope, or
the battle of Ball's Bluff, in defense of the
principles which he had always advocated,
namely the preservation of the Union and lib
erty ; and, whereas, his remains have for over,
a quarter of a century lain in Laurel Hill
Cemetery, unmarked save by a single slab to
indicate his last res tine place; . therefore we,
the Republicans of the city of Oakland, in con
vention assembled, do hereby protest against
the seeming neglect of the cities of California,
and do hereby indorse the bill introduced Into
the Legislature of California at its present ses
sion by Hon. James A. Way mire, in tne House,
and Hon. F. S. Stratton in the Senate, to appro

Resolved, That we ask the Legislature to pass
the said bill without deba'e or controversy, in
order that the monument may be erected
as an example of the love and 'gratitude which
the citizens of California bear to their friend
in the time of war and turmoil, and as a
tribute to tho sifted orator whose silent voice
with that of the immortal Starr King and
others was ever raised in behalf of the down

The Sons of Veterans, Army and Navy

matter up with a will and will not only

THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
Messages of Encouragement Received
From .Law-Makers in "Wash
ington.
The public-spirited people of Ban Fran
cisco who have labored for the interests of
the Nicaragua canal project believe now
that their efforts have not been in vain.
The matter is now under consideration at
Washington, and the people of this City
have on several occasions signified their
wishes for the completion of the canal.
Among these was tbe Merchants' Asso
ciation, which body recently passed reso
lutions favoring the canal. A few days
ago a mass-meeting under the auspices of
the Chamber of Commerce adopted sim
ilar resolutions.
On all such occasions copies of the reso
lutions were forwarded to the Pacific
Coast delegates at Washington and many
favorable answers have been received.
Among the recent answers, was one to the
Merchants' Association from Congress
man Hilborn as follows:
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
of a copy ol the resolutions, adopted by your
association, favoring the construction of the
Nicaragua canal. I assure you tbat lam
heartily in accord with the spirit of these
resolutions, and shall leave nothing undone
to secure the early completion of this most
important matter. Very truly,
' S. O. HILBORN.
A few days ago the Chamber of Com
merce held a rousing mass-meeting of
business men, at which Mayor Phelan
presided. . Similar resolutions were passed
and sent to Washington, D. C. The first
reply to these was a dispatch sent by Wil
liam H. Doolittle of the State of Washing
ton, who has been an active worker in the
cause. He wired as follows:"
Washington, D. C, January 20.
Hon. James D. Phelan: I very deenly appre
ciate the kind words contained in your mes
sage. They encourage me to additional effort.
The Nicaragua canal means permanent pros
perity to our coast and most beneficial results
to all industries and commerce of our country.
Our Senators and Representatives will make
every effort possible to accomplish legislation
insuring the canal during this Congress.

A Rumor That the Pacific, Owned by
A'.vmza Hayward, Wi 1 Soon
Start Up Again.
The gold district of Amador County
centering about Plymouth is, from all ac
counts, having rather lively times at
present. It Is said that everybody is at
work there, and that good ledges are
being opened in properties which have
hitherto for a long time been idle. Every
hotel in the camp is full. A new hotel
has recently been completed in order to
accommodate the people.
C. Elwood Browu of this City, who with
Attorney W. W. McNair and others is en
gaged in pushing work on the Gowanus
mine, in the Plymouth district, gives a
very cheering account of the condition of
things among the miners. Mr., Brown
has been there for some time past, and
has recently come down to spend a few
days at his home here. He is president of
the Gowanus Gold Mining Comoany.
"Everything is moving along in a steady
and satisfactory way in tbe Plymouth dis
trict," said Mr. Brown yesterday. "It is
active, no matter which way you turn.
Times are pgood. A lot of work is being
done on different properties, and as a rule
they are looking welL ;-,
"The workings of the Allison mine are
now down eighty feet, and a seven-foot
ledge has been opened, which the owners
say runs from $9 to $20 a ton.
"The Pocahontas is down 160 feet and
has an eight-foot ledge of good ore. The
property is looking very well every way,
and the owners believe it will prove a
great mine. â¢'./;:
"Of our work on the Gowanus I can say
that it is eminently satisfactory. The
mine is not on a spur but on the main
mother lode. We are down but 40 feet,
but I have just had an assay of what is
supposed to be average ore in the bottom,
and it was something over $3Q to the ton.
The Gowanus is an old mine, and we have
lately started up work on it. We are told
that before it closed down mill runs were
obtained on the ore and that they were
good.
"A Mr. Potter, who owns a farm of 160 |
acres, has haa an offer of $20,000 for iv : It j
is a field, but it is believed that a good I
ledge of ore or more than one can be
opened on it. There is some talk, too, of
opening up the old Pacific mine, of which
Alvinza Hayward is proprietor. Ido not
know if it will really be done.
"There is a good ledge in the Wheeler
mine. This property has long been run
ning a five-stamp mill. The hills are fall
bf prospectors all over the district."

MANUrAOTUEERS* ASSOCIATION.
Speaker Reed Asked to Take Up the
Southwick Convict Bill.
- A special meeting of the directors of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion was held yesterday for the particular
purpose of electing two directors to fill
the vacancies caused by the resignation
of H. J. Crocker and Michael McGlynn.
President Julian Sonntag presided. Di
rectors A. McLaughlin, W. F. Bowers, J.
P. Currier, A. Sbarboro, M. J. Keller and
J. W. Kerr were present
The nominating committee recom
mended as * the new directors Isidor
Jacobs of 425 Brannan street and Charles
R. Alien of 144 Steuart street. These
gentlemen were at once elected.
President Sonntag read the letter of
Congressman Southwick of New York
which was published in The Call yester
day, in which he said Speaker Reed does
not seem inclined to favor the bill relat
ing to the transportation of and branding
goods made by convicts in the Eastern
penitentiaries.
Mr. Kerr made a statement saying there
are large Eastern capitalists interested in
its defeat, and if the Labor Committee of
the Home is not recognized the bill will
never be submitted. There is money, Mr.
Kerr' said, back of ; the opposition, for
those who are making large profits out of
convict labor are not going to let the
measure come up to spoil their profits.
.California suffers more than any of
the other States from prison-made goods,
and something should, be done. There
fore he offered a resolution that Speaker
Reed be requested to recognize, the Labor
Committee and give that body a chance to
introduce the bill ; also that the state of
affairs be submitted to the labor unions of
San Francisco and their co-operation
asked in this very important matter.
Both resolutions were passed.'
Director Sbarboro called attention to
the fact that complaints bad been made
that the Sanitary "Reduction Works of
San Francisco are to get- their boilers
from the East. He desired to 'state that
the company; haa purchased California
made boilers and would fit up its entire
garbage reduction works from California
materials. A vote of thanks was extended
to that company by the directors for the
preference its officers had given for Cali
fornia-made goods and materials.

JURORS MAY GET
THEIR MEALS YET
Superior Judges Will
Disregard the Super
visorial Ukase
la a Good Round Hand Notice
Was Yesterday 0 ficially
Served.
An Issue Is Made Up Point Blank in
a Matter Which May Be More
Discussed Later.
The jurors in criminal cases in the
Superior Court departments mpy not go
hungry after all. The Board of Super
visors at their meeting last Monday hav
ing first fortified themselves with advice
as to the matter adopted a resolution, in
which they called attention of the Judges
of the Superior Court "to the determina
tion of this board to allow no demands on
tho treasury for meals furnished to juror 3
subsequent to February 1, 1897."
The reason furnished for this determina
tion of the Supervisors was that compen
sation is now allowed to jurors for attend
ance at the rate of $2 per diem. This
notice to the Superior Court Judges was
expected to have a deterrent effect upon
appetites which otherwise might be made
to assume uncommonly robust propor
tions in view of the lunches to be provided
and heretofore provided at the expense of
the public, lt goes with the saying that
this measure of economy caused certain
more or less well-defined shivers to run up
and down the spines of those who have
the selection of the proper kind of timber
for jurors. However the measure was one
of economy and was supposed to "go,"
having the stamp of official approval
upon it.
Yesterday Judge Carroll Cook, having
thought the matter over and having con
sulted with other Judges of the Superior
Court, preferred a communication which
was addressed to the Board of Supervisors:
In every county in the State where jurors
have always been paid for attendance In
criminal cases their meals have been uni
formly furnished by the county. I would also'
say that when a jury has been delivered Into
the charge of the Sheriff the law requires that
they should be kept together, and the court
would not be justified in keeping them to
gether over meal hours without nourishment;
nor would the court be authorized to require
the Sheriff to compel those who did not nave
the means to deliay the expenses of a meal to
accompany others for such purpose. I have
consulted other Judges. of this court in this
manner, and it is the sense of all with whom
I have so consulted that, notwithstanding the
fact that jurors are compensated for their
service, meals must be furnished them at the
expense of the City and County. The resolu
tion, a copy of which you sent to me, there
fore must be disregarded.
The hnal words describe the situation.
The resolution will be disregarded, jurors
will be provided with meals as heretofore
and either the Supervisors must recede or
meet an issue.
WANT ANOTHER GAME.
Lick School Challenges Y. M. C. A.
Football Team to Flay Again.
The following challenge from the Lick
School football team to play another game
in this City with the never-defeated Y. M.
C. A. lightweight team is self-explana
tory:
Sporting Editor Callâ We, the under
signed members of the California School of
Mechanical Arts football team, do hereby
challenge the I'oucg Men's Christian Associa
tion football team to a grume of ball, to be
played at some near and convenient date on
any gridiron that may be designated by the
Y. M. C. A. players, provided that such j
grounds are within the limits of the City. i
The officials of such game shall be jointly j
agreed upon by the managers of both teams.
The above challenge is issued by us in view
of the fact that It is the general opinion that
last Saturday's game between the Y. M. C. A.
and C. S. M. A. (Lick) was won by the former
team only by a chance fumble, and not by any
superior skill in playing by the said Y. M. C.
A. team. Therefore we consider the result in
decisive, and we ask for another game to de
cide which is the better team.

The Schooner Gracie S as She Left the Tug Behind and Landed Her Pilot on Board the Schooner Aloha, Inbound From the Hawaiian Islands. !

TUG AND PILOT
RACE AT SEA
Thought They Saw the
Swanhilda Coming Up
Mid-Channel.
The Aloha Mistaken for the Big
Bark With Butler on
Board.
Fleet Gracie S Had the Prize Before
the Towboat Could Ccme Within
Hailing Distance.
An exciting race for a vessel at first sup
posed to be the Swanhilda took place out
side the heads on Wednesday night be
tween the saucy pilot-boat Gracie S and
the tug Sea King.
It was the Grade's last night out and
she was lying hove-to in mid-channel,
about five miles inside the Farallons. The
night was clear, and the little vessel slid
gracefully over the long green swells that
swept majestically landward, alternately
pointing her pretty nose toward the stars
and then threatening to bury it in the
coming waves. Off to the southwest the
tug's lights shone clear in the night air as
she rose on top of the great swells. -
t Presently the man on watch in the cock
pit of the Gracie saw a torch flame ud far
out at sea, and by the aid of a glass made
out the dim outline of a vessel's sails.
At the distance she appeared to be a
square-rigger braced sharp up, and Pilot
Jordan, who was cruising the Gracie, was
called on deck. Though stiil too far off to
tell what she was the torch was evidence
that she wanted a pilot or a towboat, and
the Grade's head was turned in the direc
tion of her lights, with directions to head
the stranger off by all means. ",'
It was not long before the Sea King saw
the approaching vessel, and smoke began
pouring out of her funnel. Then the race
became exciting. If the pilot was first to
hall it might mean that the tug would
lose a job, and the same might be the fate
of the pilot should the tug be first on
hand. With the wind abeam and the
wheel in the skillful hands of Sailing Mas
ter Dave Dugan the swift schooner flew
through the water toward the vessel that
was bowling down mid channel.
Ere many minutes had passed it became
evident that the incomer was not the
Swanhilda, for though she carried four
masts they were schooner-rigged, and it
was evident that the Aloha, the big island
sugar-freighter, had been mistaken for
the coal-laden bark.
A ship was a ship, however, and the
race continued, the Gracie, under Dugan's
masterly handling, coming within hailing
distance, while the tug was still puffing
along a mile to leeward.
"Schooner ahoy I Want a pilot?" yelled
Captain Jordan from tne forward deck.
"Come aboard,", was wafted back across
the waters, and in a few moments the
yawl was in the water, and the Aloha
passed under tbe command of the pilot.
Another race took piace on the home
run. With a staysail and a bonnet on Per
jib to help her the little Gracie fled for the
Golden Gate to catch the tide ere it turned
to ebb; and so fleet was she that the big
schooner, with the tug as a consort, was
left far astern. * *
THE JABEZ WENT ASHORE.
Coral Reefs at Tahiti Claimed the
Bark and Her Cargo.
The barkentine City of Papeete got in
from Tahiti early yesterday morning.
Among the passengers was the crew of the
Norwegian bark Jabez, from Australia for
Holland. She bad on board a cargo of
blue gum piles, that were to be used in
constructing dykes along the foreshore of
the Dutch coast, but went ashore on
the coral reefs that guard Papeete. Captain
Salvesen remained behind to look after
the wreck, two of his men shipped on a
trading schooner and the remainder came
to San Francisco. First Officer G. Peter
son was the only man among the crew
that could speak English. He gave the
following account of the disaster:
"We were bound from Sydney for Rot
terdam with a cargo of blue cum. The
Jabez was a wooden vessel of 953 tons,
Duilt in 1884. She was seaworthy in every
respect, but in latitude 57 south we ran
into a furious hurricane, which nearly
threw the vessel on her beam-ends and did
considerable damage to rigging and the
deckhouses.
"â When the weather moderated we made
such repairs as were possible to be made
and prepared to continue our voyage,
when we encountered worse weather. On
August 27 and 28 it blew a gale. Our fore
rigging was carried away and the ship
badly damaged. We sprang a leak soon
after encountering the first storm and the
continuance of the storms caused the ves
sel's seams to open up wider and we took
in water so fast that the captain decided
to head for the Society Islands.
"We sighted Tahiti on the first day of
September and on the 2d of September we
began to feel our way into port. While
trying to make the harbor we were carried
onto a reef and the bottom was torn out
of the vessel; she was held on the coral,
however, and did not sink and we had no
difficuly in getting ashore."
The names of the men who came up on
the barkentine are as follows:
A. v Lelliot", .G. Lelliott, H. Steegro, J.
Steegro, G. Peterson, T. Reinersseu, T.
Jacobsen, Z. Housen, Pete Olsen. A. Am
mond, J. Tholkaidsen, S. Jacobsen, M.
Nelson, T. Peertlimus.
The rescued men will not go back to
Europe, but will ship here on the first ves
sel that requires a crew.
The fight between the rival quarantine
officers is not over by nny means. Dr.
Chalmers stands on his State rights and
insists that due consideration shall be
given to his ruling*. Uncle Sam asserts
that no child of his shall gainsay his rul
ing and thus the matter stands. Califor
nia has grown to be a great big baby, but
Uncle Sam still insists upon the right of
spanking her when he think, she demands
correction. In consequence the State
quarantine officer is ignored and a general
mixup is the result.
The schooner Mary and Ida has been
purchased from the estate of Preston &
McKinnon by the Pacific Marine Supply
Company. She will go into the cod
fishing business early in the spring.
F. E. Bridges, the careful compiler of
news on the Guide, has, under the super
vision of J. J. Keegan, secretary of the
Harbor Commission, got up one of the
most useful books issued by the State. It
is a record of* the dockageand tonnage of
the port of San Francisco for the year
1896.
Says the Hawaiian Gazette:
An English firm running a line of steamers
between Yokohama, Vicioria and Tacoma
finds that iv order to compete successfully
with the Nippon Yusen Kaisha better class
steamers must be put on, consequently three
larger and faster steamers have been ordeied
from London. The steamship companies no
doubt are somewhat disgruntled on account
of improvements which competition * neces
sitates, but we who derive b3uefits from one of
the competing lines can offer no complaint if
our steamer service is improved.
RAILROAD IN THE NORTH.
Company Incorporated to Build
From Upton to Fall

Another Indication of Growing Con
; dence F. It in California's

Articles of incorporation of the McCloud
River Railroad Company have been tiled.
It is proposed to construct a standard
gauge railroad from a junction with the
Southern Pacific Railroad tracks at Upton,
near Sisson, to the town of Fall River,
Shasta County, near the confluence of the
Pitt and Fall rivers, a distance of sixty
miles. 188
The capital stock is fixed at $1,200,000
of which $66,000 has been actually sub
scribed and $6600 has been paid to the
treasurer of the corporation. The incor
porators are William E. Brown, William
W. Van . Arsdale. Daniel W. Earl, J. Dal
zell Brown and George W. Scott, each of
whom has subscribed for $13,200 worth of
stock. -' 2- . ;
The men interested are all well known
and substantial citizens and their course
in paying so much cash into the hands of
the treasurer seems to indicate that they
mean business. .
.Persons acquainted with the territory

A New Tru.tee of th. Library.
At the last held meeting of the trustees of
; the Free Public Library James D. Phelan, one
of the trustees, tendered his resignation. - He
took this step for the reason that under the
law the Mayor of the . City is ex-officio a trus
tee, and having been elected to that office he
felt that it was a duty to create a vacancy and
he did so. T. B. Bishop, a well-known attor
ney, was chosen to fill that vacancy. ...
THE SAN ,.- FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 1897.
CARDINAL LINKS
FOR ALMA MATER
Stanford Alumni in This
City Form a Club
Nucleus-
Women Are Admitted to Mem
bership in the New
A. filiation.
Its Objct Is to Unite the Urban
Graduates and Preserve Strong
University Ties.
The Stanford graduates in this City have
organized themselves into an alumni asso
ciation. There are fifty-seven graduates
hereabouts, including seven women, who
have received the university degree of
bachelor of arts.
There has been a Stanford Alumni As-
GEORGE E. CROTHERS, AM., President of the New Stanford
Alumni Association of San Francisco*
sociation ever since the summer of 1892,
when the first degrees were conferred by
tbe new university upon certain students
from other institutions who had been ad
mitted to senior standing \ when college
work was begun in October, 1891. But
this is the first club of graduates con
fined to a particular locality. The organi
zation is line with a movement recently
advocated by the executive committee of
tbe main association, which recommended
the formation of an alumni club wherever
there should be a sufficient number to
warrant it. This means that in San Fran
cisco there are more Stanford graduates
than in any other one place in this conn-
try. .' -i'-'J'
In addition to the regular alumni here,
there are perhaps sixty or more old ; Stan-'
ford students in and [. near this City who
attended the university a year or more.
They will be made associate members of
the local association.
The chief object of the organization' is
the welfare of alma mater in San Fran
cisco and vicinity and the preservation of
college ties. ' * .â -.'.
- . About 450 persons ' have so far been
Graduated from Stanford University. The
great majority of these were members of
the classes of ,1895 and 1896, the first to
complete the full four years' course at
Palo Alto. .: It now appears that over a
ninth of Stanford's graduates have located
m San Francisco and in the main are now
following the profess for which they
specially trained in collece. Of the men
11 are pursuing the law, 8 are in business,
8 are engaged in electrical and mechan
ical engineering, 7 are teaching, 5 are Jaw
students, 4 are medical students, 2 are en
gaged in civil engineering, 2 in mining
and geological work, 1 is in journalism
and 1 is specializing in science.
Three are married.
The new organization resulted prima
rily from an alumni dinner last batnr
day nik-ht, at which tbere were twenty
five resident graduates gathered about a
long table made suggestively Stanford by
a covering of cardinal cheese and
draped with classic ivy, twined among the
candelabra.
With tbe perfection subsequently of an
organization, the following officers were
elected for the ensuing year:
President, George E. Crothers, '95; vice
president, . Charles K. Field. '95, secre
tary, William E. Stuart, '95; treasurer,
Lester J.. Hinsdill, '95.
The 1 following graduates comprise the
original membership: _ .
Of the class of Thomas G. Crothers, J.
H. Means, A. B. Thompson and George B.
Miller.
Of the class of '93â W. B. Clark.
â¢ Of the class of '94â Aylett Cotton Jr., John

Cora M. Palmer '95, Miss Luella M. Reilav '95,
Miss Henrietta M. Stadtmuller '95, and Miss
Sarah Comstock '96. ,.
George E. Crothers, the president of the
local association, was a San Jose boy.
; While a student at the. San Jose High
School he was president of his class three
successive terms.- He was also the organ
izer there of the high school fraternity of
Gamma Eta v Kappa and of the High
School Senate, â¢; which ;is . now a ; depart
ment recognized by the Board of Educa
tion. V While at â ' Stanford University he
was president for one term of ' the pioneer
class, which originally had a membership
of over 300. sHe ; was also , a prominent
member of the Sigma Nu fraternity.
There are already Stanlord clubs in
Portland, Or., in Los Angeles, in New
York City, at John Hopkins University
and at Harvard University, * but t they are
not properly alumni associations.:
It is probable that the San Francisco as
sociation will eventually become a club
with regular headquarters.

Walter Nung Fong, is a native-born Chi
nese, the first that has ever received a col
lege degree in the West. : ; I

It is growing monotonous waiting on
Meiggs wharf for the ship tbat will come
in with her passenger whom a half dozen
lookout detectives are desirous of wel
coming to these shores. Though they
cannot see the Swanhilda slipping in
through the heads they hope she is safe
somewhere on the Pacific, and also that
Butler is on board and enjoying good
health ; and physically prepared for a re
turn passage to Australia, where the
Coroner and the courts are waiting to
question him regarding several dead men
found' among the bills.
Somebody has called the vigil on Meiggs
wharf a "dead watch." If so it is a
watch that partakes little of the gravity or
ante-mortem solemnity . of ihe death
watch. When Sergeant Bonner, who is
the dean of the squad, turns out at the

sworn to preserve the peace of the great

Detectives Silvia and Ferguson take
turn about helping Conroy wash the

wild yarns of water-front life.
But while the coffee is boiling and other
household duties go on the watchâ death
or otherwiseâ goes on night and day.
Every moment somebody has the field
glass in hand scanning the Golden Gate
for the first glimpse of the big four-master
Swanhildaâ and Butler. The revenue
cutter still swings at her lines, steam up,
waiting the signal. '--J r
The Swanhilda is now out 59 days from
Newcastle, but she is not alone in her lin
gering, for a fleet of five others are long
out. They are the British ship Morialta.
77 days out; the British shiD King Ed
ward, 67 days; the British ship Olivebank,
64 days; the American ship Sterling, 63
days, and the British ship Burmah, 63
days. There are also five others out from
59 to 27 days and eleven vessels between
Newcastle and San ..Francisco. So, with
the time record of rive .ships which left
port before her it will be no marvel if the
Swanhilda takes a week or ten days more
to make port. â  _â "
Yesterday afternoon the Australian offi
cers received a telegram irom the Colonial
detective, Roche,. which was sent from
Washington. It stated that he was on hi
way to San Francisco with all the neces
sary" extradition papers and would be in
this City next Tuesday.
Officer Conroy, speaking of the dis
patch in the evening papers to tho effect
that the body- of Lesa.h, the third victim
of Butler, had been iou:ul, said that the
news was undoubtedly true. He believes
that more bodies, buried by the mur
derer, wiil be dug up, and that. by the
time the detectives get back to Australia
with their man the world will have the
evidence that he is one of the greatest
murderers of the century.
In the meanwhile the detectives keep
house, keep watch and keep the reporters
interested by their tales of catching But
lers and other noted people iv two conti
nents, while the Swanhilda lingers some
where out on the Pacific.

the club's representatives yesterday, and
the following questions were asked: Shall
the club disband? Second â Shall the
money in the treasury be held in trust or
deposited as a guarantee fund for the hold
ing of a show this year by the Olympic
Gun Club? Thirdâ Shall the money be
distributed to such charitable institutions
as the officers of the club may decide
at their next meeting, which will be next
Tuesday evening?
One of the committee said last evening
that the members he had seen were in
favor ef depositing the money as a guar
antee fund for the holding N of a show by
the Olympic Gun Club.
The Olympic Gun . Club will certainly
decide on Wednesday evening whether it
will give a show this year or net. Should
the Pacific Kennel Club conclude to dis
band it is safe to say that a dog show will
be held in this City next May.

MUNYON
HAS A CURE FOR EACH DISEASE. .
With Munyon's Improved Homffl.pathic
Remedies in the House, Mothers Can

v j
Professor Munyon is honored to-day as
the leading authority in t he medical world.
His new and humane met: ods of treat-
ment have .went away all the old-fash-
ioned ideas of doctoring with poisonous
drugs that create a dozen diseases in the
effort to get rid of one. He does not claim
that he has one remedy that will cure all
complaints, but that he has prepared a
specific cure for nearly every disease. He
does not claim that Munyon's Rheuma-
tism Cure will cure consumption, dyspep-
sia or any other complaint, but he does
assert 'hat it will curerneumatism. Mun-
yon* Dyspepsia Cure is prepared expressly
to cure dyspepsia; Munyon's Cough Cure
to cure coughs; Munyon's Catarrh Reme-
dies to cure catarrh; Munyon's Kidney
Cure to cure kidney troubles. The same
may be said of ail Munyon's different rem-
edies. They may be obtained at all drug-
stores, mostly at 25'cen-s a bottle.
Personal letters to Prof. Munyon, 1505

IN HIS SLEEP
A Steamship Fireman's Ex
perience on His Night
Ashore.
He Climbed a Wall in Pioneer
Court and Was Found at
the Bottom. . '
â¢
Some Peoph Took Him for a Burglar,
but Ha Wondered How It
All Happened.
'
Michael Reiley says he walk's in his
sleep. He is a fireman on the steamer
Newsboy and works hard for a living.
Some time Wednesday night or yesterday
morning he must have been asleep, for he
Where Reiley Fell and Was Found Groaning in Agony Hours Later
climbed a high wall at the rear of the
Academy of Science building and fell into
a light well at the other side fully twenty
feet from the top.
Early in the morning his moans were
heard by the janitor of the Pioneer build
ing, who bent his efforts to release Reiley.
And now the hapless seaman is lying low
at the Receiving Hospital suffering from
internal injuries.
', How he came to that wail or bow he
climbed it and fell over puzzled him
tremendously yesterday. The only way
he can account for his accident is he
walked in his sleep. Incidentally, Reiley
had Wednesday ashore and spent tbe day
with convivial friends and the flowing
bowl. i^'T .;''..
There was considerable fuss over Reiley,
Who was aecl ared a burglar and all sorts
of a desperado, with designs on the nu-
Mum. A. E. Fisher, janitor ot the Acad-
emy building, insisted that tbe unfortu
nate fellow was dangerous. "I was told
by the Pioneer peonle that a man was
moaning at the bottom of the alley," he
said, "but I did not want to touch him
till -the police came along. Then we got
him out with a ladder and sent him to the
hospital." ; : _.s.;p.
-To all appearances Reiley wandered
into Pioneer court, off Fourth street and
between the Flood and Pioneer buildings.
At the end of tbe court is a wail ten feet
high, inside of which is a narrow space
/used as a light well by the Academy of
I Sciences building lower floor.
I When Reiley encountered the wall his
\tjes fell upon an electrician's ladder
"* hanging upon a peg and chained fiat
against the wall. Iv his rather mixed
condition it seems he thought he was in
; the hold of a steamer, and he climbed up
' on deck on the straight ladder. The deck
was "the coping of the wall, but a heavy
- sea was rolling as the sailor's foot touched
the rail and Reiley went overboard. It
was eitber that way or he walked in his
sleep, because he said so afterward when
"the mishap was a blank in his memory. (
About 7 a.m. his cries of pain attracted
attention and two policemen took Reiley
; out to the Receiving Hospital, where it
'was. found he had received internal in
juries. His hands were evidence enough
to prove that he was a hard working fel
low, and his clothes showed the nature of
his occupation. < So the police concluded
it could not have been a case of attempted
â¢burglary, j It was the evil result of walk
in/ in one's sleep. Reiley's sleep cost $2
which he got from the captain of the
Newsboy Wednesday afternoon.

THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
G. W. Owen Begins His Testimony
as a Witness tor the
Defense. *
When the criminal libel case aeainst
Benjamin F. Hudelson was called in
Judge Campbell's court yesterday after
noon the Judge remarked that he was
very tired of the business and hoped it
would not, like the brook, go on forever.
The remark was called forth when the
complaining witness," Attorney D. B.
Woodworth, reminded the court that he
had asked the privilege of bringing wit
nesses for the prosecution, although rest
ing his case.
It was at first agreed to continue the
case till Tuesday afternoon, but Attorney
Jordan, af'.er consultin-.' with G. W.
Owen, who now lives in Santa Cruz,
asked that his evidence might be taken,
and he took the stand as a witness for the
defense. ,â¢.;.â >â¢ :.; ;
Owen testified to being in Rev. Donald
M. Ross' house in the beginning of April,
1896, with H. IT. Marshall, when Wood
work called, and Ross introduced. Wood
worth to Owen as the great political wire
puller for the Canadian Government.
Woodworth spoke of the unfair way that
Hudelson had* treated Ross and Marshall
and took from his pocket the famous
Marshall' affidavit, which was to be used
as a lever to compel Hudeison to lend his
influence in selling the Plumas County
mine to John D. -Soreckels. Woodworth
explained the whole scheme and Owen
was asked to see Mr. Spreekels.
Owen had eot as far as the second con
ference with Ross and Woodworth, which
was after Hudeison had told Woodworth
that the scheme was a piece of blackmail,
when the court adjourned. Owen's ex
amination will be continued Tuesday
afternoon.

_______
Reports Show neral Progress in
Work and en Increase in
Membership.
The fifteenth quarterly convention of
the Epworth League Alliance of San Fran
cisco and other cities on the bay was held
last night at California-street Methodist
Church. Much interest was manifested
in the meeting. The church was crowded,
many of those present coming from Oak
land, Alameda and Berkeley.
Early in the evening the Junior League
held its convention. . A. C. Stevens pre
sided. i This part of the programme was
opened with a praise service 'by Louis
Paltenghi," which was followed with ij
prayer by Mrs. H. I. Benson. Rev. G. R.
Stanly gave' a Scripture reading, â¢ after
which short reports on the league's prog
ress were made by the â  junior superin
tendent. , .. - j
L. J. Norton of the board of control de
livered a brief address. ' He said that this
was the important time to catch . the
young people while they were in the
formative period. He also urged ; his
hearers not to sit Idly by and see the chil
dren leave paths of righteousness, and
then at last endeavor to bring them bacK ;
but to foster in them tbe good and true
and build them up for work in the church
and in the world.
The junior service was concluded with
an address by Rev. George W. Beatty of
Oakland. ;â  â¢ i '.<â '-. ..'â _â 
Liter tbe alliance assembled with R. D.
Beals in the chair. Bishop J. P. Newman
wa- on the platform- surrounded with
pastors and active officers of the league.
The meeting was opened with a song by
the congregation, after which Rev.* W.
S. Urmy pronounced a prayer. There
was Scripture reading by Rev. M. C. Har
ris, followed by a song, "When the Roll
Is Called Up Yonder."
Reading of annual reports of officers oc
cupied the alliance for some time. These
reports showed a general growth in the
work and in the number of members.
The membership of the alliance was about
1700. Finances were in a flourishing con
dition.
Officers for the ensuing year were elect
ed as follows: R. D. Beals, president;
A. C. Stevens, vice-president; Mrs. H. I.
Benson, second vice-president;. W. W.
Kelly, third vice-president; George Ja
cobs, fourth vice-president; M. V. Donald
son, secretary; A. Wistrand, treasurer;
Louis Paltenglii. chorister.
The Cninese Quartet gave selections of
hymns which interested the audience.
Bishop Newman spoke about the Ep
worth League. In opening he said he ad-,
vised with Dr. Clark, the founder of the
It-aeue, regarding its formation and as
sisted in its establishment in 1885. This
was in Cleveland, Ohio, as the outgrowth
of five or six different young people's
societies in the church. Now the league
ha- a total membership of 1.500,000 and
_1 000 branches. The departments of
the league were taken up. The first
vice-president attended to the spiritual
department, the Becond bad charge of the
mercy and help work, the third was occu
pied with the literature ot the league, and
the fourth with social matters. Bishop
Newman said he was glad that the league
had that feature. Christianity recognizes
social life; Christ came into the world to
bring joy and gladness, and he every
where recognizes man's social nature.
Mrs. Ella Eaird-Wescotl sang, and Rev.
J. W. Phelps led a pentecostal service.
The convention closed with benediction
by Rev. D. W. Chilson.
School Department Deficit.
Mayor- Phelan conferred yesterday with
'School Directors Waller and Burns concerning
the deficit of over $90,000 in the funds of the
School Department. The problem is how to
close the present fiscal year with a clean
balance. .After talking the matter over some
time no definite conclusion was reached and
the School Directors will still further have to
struggle with the problem thrust upon them.
New Station Ready for Business.
The San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad opened up a station yesterday at
Geneva, which is Jjetween Merced and La
Grand, seventy-five miles from Stockton and
forty-nine miles from Fresno. A handsome
combination passenger and freight depot has
inst been completed there.

Metnodist Deaconesses' Home, a most
magnificent place situated on the hill just
outside of Hamburg, which coÂ°t $150,000

grounds. It was built and donated to the
Methodist deaconesses in appreciation of
their courage in caring lor those who were
afflicted with th- cholera scourge that
broke over Germany three or four > years

THIRD STREET TO
BE MUCH IMPROVED
Electric-Light Movement Is
to Bring About
Reform-
More Bitumen Pavement and
Some Big Buildings Con- _
templated.
Third street, from Harrison to Mission,
is to be lighted within ten days by arc
lights suspended midway of the thorough
fare, and i other material improvements
are promised. But the few blocks of
lights will be only the beginning of the
system very soon to extend the entire
length of Third street, from the very busi
ness center of the City at' newspaper cor
ners to the railroad station. .
Committees' are at work canvassiug the
' property-owners to obtain their co-opera
tion in the enterprise that is calculated
to enhance the value of property, and at
the same time make tbe street more at
tractive to storekeepers, who, under other
circumstances, might move into thor
oughfares already enlivened by electric
lights.
It is a movement with " which* the prop
erty-owners generally are in hearty ac
cord.* They look upon it in a way as a
profitable and a necessary investment.
They do not think that the storekeepers
that are merely tenants should be asked
to maintain the improvement that is cal
culated to put the street in line with other
progressive streets that have already made
improvements that may attract storekeep
ers to locate in them. , .
'The project was originally suggested
nearly a month ago by Hugo Keil, one of
the directors of the Merchants' Associa
tion and himself a property-owner on
Third street. A general committee con
sisting of James O'Dwyer, Joseph Silver
man, Rienzi Hughes and Katchinski then
undertook the work of canvassing among
the property-owners and with gratifying
results. Then when the success of the
undertaking began to be assured tbe other
parties to the movement placed matters
in the hands of Messrs. Silverman and
Hughes, who have during the last few
days been actively engaged in the work.
, This committee, discussing the subject
yesterday.said:
, "The lighting of Third street has become
a necessity. Other streets have put in arc
lights and we must keep our tenants.
"With the Southern Pacific Railroad 1
depot already at one end jj of the street ;
and a strong probability of the terminus j
of - the San â¢â * Joaquin Valley road ' being \
there also, Third street will naturally have j
the travel to the center of the City. Since 1
we have been among the property-owners j
and talked the subject over with them w e '
have found out that quite a number of'
property-owners intend: soon to put- up
some new buildings and better houses on |
the street, ..We were assured by one prop- 'Â«
erty-owner that be intends to erect Jan.
eight-story building between Mission and
Howard streets. Another means to build I
a large modern hotel between Howard and
Folsom streets. ' -â¢'.â  *â¢'.' , .._. ,

being aroused Uo; the: prospects of the ;

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.â The tendency
of the stock market was toward a lower range of
prices again to-day. Considering the sharp break
in some specialties and other developments, how
ever, the general list held steady, the decline
for the day ln such stocks as the grangers, Chi
cago Gas, Sugar and Louisville and Nashville
showing losses of 14 to Ufa per cent. Quotations
from London came lower at the oprfnin.-, showing
that the reduction in the Bank of England rate
bad been discounted. This was a disappointment
to tbe bulls, while It encouraged the bears to re
new their eft irta at hammering the _aarket. The
dullness and absence of the outside orders was
against an Improvement in prices. Sugar figured
for 51,300 for a total in the whole list of 163.700
shares, but in a majority of Instances the demand
was unusually light.
The sensational event of the day was a break of
I_3,_ 111 .locking Valley preferred to 40 and of
884 in the common to B*4. The decline was
started by an effort to margin a small amount of
stock. In the absence of supporting orders the
bears found it an easy matter to bring about the
subsequent sharp fall, especially as a rumor was
circula ed that a receiver for the property was
Imminent. V ice- President Samuel Davis subse
quently denied the rumor and the common ral led

bituminous coal carriers, has suffered from the
fierce war th. t has been waged between them for

Prices have been so reduced that the very ne

Settlement, wh eh up to the piesent time the man

they claim to have made important concessions.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 21.â Not a vestige of yes
terday's strength existed In the wheat market
this morning. . The bulge to-day was the direct
result of reported heavy sales of cash wheat at St.
Louis, aud when the Claims were emphatically
denied prices flattened out and aropped to yester
day's lowest figures. The Liverpool cables were a
disappointment, only a insignificant response to
our gain of yesterday being reported at Ihe en
lug and that was lost later. The Cincinnati Price
Current summary gave an encouraging ou look,
and reported the flour trade slack. Receipts at
: Chicago were 29 cars, and 99.193 busnels were
, withdrawn from store. T.ie Northwest had 252
i cart against 272 la-.t Thursday and 436 a year a.o.
! Closing Continental cables were slightly higher.
' Exports amounted to 411.081 bushels. The
â market continued weak until the last half hour,
when covering by 'shorts" caused a raily. May
wheat opened from 79%@79Â»4c, closing at 79*j4
<g,79V_ c Did, I/4.C under yesterday. Estimated re-
I ceipts for to-morrow 25 cars. No. 2 spot rei
j - wheat ran .e.i from 87%Â®8?.V B e, Closing at BS",_c
I CORNâ The tone waa e*sy, reflecting that of
wheat. There was no Important buying or selling
orders. The Cincinnati Price Current explains I
the dullness in flour trade being due to corn prod
ucts, which would argue a greater consumption of
1 this cereal. Receipts were '.05 cars, and 106,400
bushels were taken from store. Liverpool was
quiet and unchanged. Exports were heavy at
'. 500.461 bushels. May opened at 2414 c declined
jto 24c and closed at 24@)24i/ c. V B Â®V.c lower than
j yesterday. Estimated receipts ior to-morrow
were 2-5 cars.
OATSâ Very little to attract attention occurred
in oats. This was a smaller edition of the wheat
m rket in that it moved up or down with the lat
ter. Receipts were 187 cars, Â»nd 26,672 bushels
were withdrawn from store. Exports were light
at 8146 bushels. May closed V.'l' V.c lower. Es
-1 timated rce ipts for to-morrow .16 cars.
! PKuVlsiO.sSâ Were inclined to improve at
i the opening, and by so doing r fleeted the action
j of the hog market. The depiesslou in grain, bow
] ever, worked to the disadvantage of general specu
lation, product suffering with everything else.

ON VACCINATION

Be Undone.
According to Medical Men the Law Is
Not Mandatory Except in an
Epidemic.
Oakland Offick San Feancuoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 2L J
Dr. J. TJ. Oberg bas issued an open letter
to the Berkeley School Board regarding
the present war in tbat town over the
vaccination of pupils.
At a meeting of the board last Tuesday
Dr. Oberg was invited to be present and
listen to the discussion on the subject.
The Trustees decided to enforce the law
with the proviso "if the children are in a
condition to stand vaccination, otherwise
t>wait until they are; and again provid
-m/r.z hat they do not absolutely refuse to
TcpjuP 1 "* with the law because they do not
Wlieve in its efficacy."
"There is no proviso in the law," said
Dr. Oberg, "wherein we find authority
given to physicians or parents to use dis
cretion in regard to its enforcement. It
specifically states tbat all cbildren ad
mitted to the public schools must be vac
cinated. It further states tbat if one trial
does not prove sufficient they must repeat
it again and again until it does.
"If a party is able to attend school the
law takes it for granted that ha is able to
stand the ordeal of vaccination, and when
the Health Officer of Berkeley advises any
discretion in its enforcement he does so
contrary to law. "When the School Trus
tees give authority to the Health Officer to
use discretion, they also act in defiance of
law. It nowhere states that the health of
the party must be considered before its en
forcement, nor does it state that any len
iency must be shown toward those who
do pot believe in the efficacy of vaccina
tion. The Trustees bave decided that the
law is mandatory and must be enforced,
and if it is not to be enforced it should be
repealed while the Legislature is now in
session.
"Upon reading the law it is seen that it
is not mandatory and that it must be
rigidly enforced in emergencies only. It
is called an act to 'encourage' general
vaccination. The intention of the act is
more clearly shown in section 5, wherein
it commands the various school boards to
render an accurate report of the vacci
nated and unvaccinated children attend
ing school between the ages of 5 and 17.
It the law were mandatory it would take
it for granted that ali sucb children were
vaccinated before admission to school.
The Trustees have clearly only read a
portion of the law and have not seen that
it is an emergency measure only to be
rigidly enforced during a violent epi
demic. To enforce it when there is no in
dication of any danger would bo in- 1
(judicious in the extreme, and even crimi- I
Tai, because the effect is not claimed to
jt>e permanent; hence may prove useless
'__* the time an epidemic does come.
"Its enforcement, therefore, becomes a
signal for war upon those who honestly
believe it injurious instead of beneficial,
and who consider the law a species of class
legislation which is unconstitutional,
hence its enforcement can never fully take
place, and as it stands at present, it injures
the believers in its efficacy, and hampers
the Health Department.
"The School Board of Berkeley, there
fore, has a duty to perform, viz.: To
rigidly enforce the same without favor
toward any one daring an epidemic, and
to see that it is not enforced when there is
. none."
A petition is being largely signed asking
the Board of Health to rescind their action
of the 18th inst. and enforce the law only
when it is needed, and at no other time. '
ROARK STILL MISSING,
Mystery Over Which the Peo
ple of Berkeley Are Much
Puzzled.
For Four Moiths a Wife and Family
of Little On-s Have Looked in
Vain for Tidings.
BERKELEY. Cal., Jan. 21.â Since he
laid aside his tools to go to lunch at noon
nearly four months past not a trace of
Thomas P. Roark of West Berkeley has
been found. His wife, struggling in pov
erty to support six children, the eldest
only 9, has watched and waited, and made
inquiries, and haunted the offices ofthe
police, but all without result, and now the
, -fortunate woman thinks that she is a
'^yidow and that her husband was mur
deV.ed and his body put out of the Way
somewhere along the lonely stretch of the
West Berkeley beach. â¢ .{ A
Roark was employed as a carpenter by
one Dugan, who keeps a saloon on Rose
. street. The relations of themissing man
and the saloon-keeper were not merely
those of employer and employe, however,
as the carpenter is said to have been a
good customer at Dut-an's bar. Oi late
' he bad drunk and gambled a good. deal.
On the morning of September 23 he said
. ! good- by to his wife at the breakfast table
! and went to his work as usual. The night
before he had been making plans lor
future work and he had hired an assistant
r to work for him on the 24th.
"I had lunch ready for him," said Mrs.
Dugan, "but he did not come. Supper
time came, and still he was away, and I
lay awake all night, expecting every mo
v. ment to bear him come in.
"I. thought lie might come home at
Christmas, but it is passed and so is New
Year's, and 1 know that if he was alive
; he would not stay away from me ana the
: children. He was very much attached to
them, and he would know if he were
alive that there is no money for me to
keep them with.
"He was not the kind of a man to kill
himself, and if he is dead he did not die
- by his own hand. Men who drink and
play cards get in trouble and are some
times put out of the way, and because I
have no money the police take no interest
in looking for him."
IRoark was very well known in Berkeley,
bft vin resided on Ninth street, near Unl
â "pS-'sity avenue, for eighteen years. His
' win? is now supporting herself and six
. children by selling milk. Her home â is
I mortgaged for $1000, and ere long may be
taken from her. ; . Â£JZ*
Roark was a master mechanic,' and as
far as is known had no reason for suicide
or for leaving his home.

TALCOTT MADE A RECORD
Only a Year Ago He Was an
Ardent Believer in -
Democracy.
Now the Republicans Admit That He
Is a Masbr-Wielder of the
Gave!.
Oakland Office San Fbancmco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 21. J
Politicians to-day are discussing the
chances of election of the ticket nominated
last night by the Republicans, and already
there is talk of opposition candidates.
One of the incidents of the convention
was the expeditious manner in which
Judge Talcott wielded the gave!. He has
only been in this city a short time, and
with the exception of a speech on last
Fourth of July, the Judge is almost a
stranger to public life. A year ago he was
an ardent Democrat, but the planks in
the Chicago platform were more than he
JUDGE H. D. TALCOTT, a Converted Democrat, Who Gave
Old Republicans Pointers About Running a Convention.
could stand, and for some time he has
been a sincere advocate of Republican
principles.
Already there is talk of getting together
the Municipal League and making up a
ticket by indorsing candidates on other
tickets or encouraging them to run inde
pendently by promising the league's in
dorsement.
As the leading spirit of the Municipal
League took an active part in last night's
convention, it is not easy to see how.
without some treacherous practices, the
remnant of the league can show sufficient
strength to make their indorsement worth
having.
Dr. Pardee and Giles H. Gray have been
the pillars of strength on which the league
depended. Both these men were in evi
dence last night, and indeed Dr. Pardee
has been the controlling spirit in all the
preliminary work that led up to the con
vention.
There is more than a probability that
John R. Glascock may be induced to run
by the Democrats, and if such should be
the case he will probably receive the sup
port of a section of the league. Although
the league has always been considered a
Republican body, and indeed has been
one, it has always called itself non
partisan, and, consequently, cannot be
accused of inconsistency by supporting a
Democrat for office even after the nomina
tion of a popular Republican such a. W.
R. Thomas.
It is now certain that there will be an
independent citizens' ticket,- and there
can be no doubt that such a movement
would bring together under the leadership
of John L. Davie nearly all the disaffected
elements in politics. J. K. Peirsol, the
present City Attorney, was nominated to
succeed himself last night by the Popu
lists, and if he retains anything like the
strength he showed two years ago he will
prove a formidable rival to W. A. Dow,
who was nominated by the Republicans.
Up to the day before . the Republican
convention met there was a strong move
ment to throw down City Engineer Wil
son and take up Ross Morgan. The name
of Morgan, however, was not submitted to
the convention, and it is believed now
that it was withdrawn for the purpose of
making him a strong candidate on an in
dependent ticket. â  â¢/.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 1897.
TRIP JENNINGS
WAS TOO NERVY
Made His Companion Obey
Him With an Empty
Revolver.
Exhibited Stolen Treasures
Hidden in a Barn Near
Sunol.
Finally Became So Overbearing Tha
He Was Led Into the Hands
of the Sheriff â¢ -
Oakland Office San Fea_*oisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Jan. 21. )
John Jennings is one of the smoothest
individuals that ever tramped the roads
of Alameda County or pillaged a lady's
jewel case at a ranchhouse. ,
Jennings turned up at Pleasanton four
days ago under peculiar circumstances.
Some laborers who were repairing the rail
road track observed his coming out of a
little hut which they were accustomed to
use for a cookhouse. He had gone inside
and helped himself liberally to whatever
food lie could find and politely told the
men what he had done, and expressed a
hope that he had not subjected them to
any inconvenience.
A little later he took Into his confidence
Herman Jarmen and told him that he
could put him in the way of earning a far
better living than by working. He per
suaded Jarmen to accompany him, and
when near Sunol Jennings went into a
little hot and showed Jarmen several
pieces of jewelry, which he plainly stated
he had stolen. He then took a revolver,
pointed it at Jarmen and hinted what his
fate would be should he divulge his plans.
After putting tbe jewelry in his pocket the
two men took to the road again and
walked till they were hungry.
Toward evening they were near a ranch
house, and Jennings told Jarmen to wait
by the roadside till be came back. In balf
an hour he returned with a fat chicken,
which was still alive. He told Jarmen to
kill it and Jarmen, who is very tender
hearted, 'refused to do so. Jennings again
produced his revolver, and a few seconds
later Jarmen had killed the chicken.
After a nastily cooked meal they retired
for the night to an empty barn. Jarmen
was told to keep watch at the door while
Jennings slept, but before lying down the
thief put his revolver by his side and
hinted to Jarmen what the penalty would
be if any barm happened to him.
By this time Jarmen was thoroughly
frightened and concluded that the sooner
he parted - company with Jennings the
safer he would feel. He waited until Jen
nings was asleep and. started out to find
Constable Lyster. Marshal Ramage of
Haywards was also notified, and a few
hours later Jennings was caught, and
when his revolver was taken: from him
there was not a single cartridge in in it, nor
had he one about his person.
Jennings took his arrest very quietly,
admitted stealing the jewelry and told the
officers where he got it, and a little later
gave them the information that he was
released from San Quentin last Thursday,
where he had just completed a term for
burglary. He is now in the County Jail
witn another charge oi burglary banging
over him. ___ â¢' â¢ â¢
A BID ALTERED.
The Board of Works Will Investigate
the Affair.
OAKLAND, Cai,., Jan. 21.â 1t has been
discovered that there has been a change in
a bid for sewering East Twelfth street.
The bid originally read "8 9.10 cents," not
specifying that amount was for â¢ square
feet, square yards, or. for the whole job.
The assessments were made out for the
sum mentioned for the gutters. It has
Just now been discovered tbat by the use
of ditto marks the bid now reads "8 9.10
cents per square foot."
Assistant Ellery and Miss Babcock, bolh
of the Street. Department, are positive
that the original . bid was without ditto
marks. There is a difference of several
hundred dollars in: the original bid and
the way in which it now appears. _' ".

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. ' 21.â The Con

concert of the season under its new con

in the Congregational church, corner of

THE HUSBAND TESTIFIES.
He Defends Himself in the Watson Dl-
vorce Case.
OAKLAND, Cal, Jan. 21.â W. C. Wat
son, who was on the witness-stand to-day
in support of his side of the divorce case
now pending, denied that he was jealous
of his wife. He thought he had caught
her flirting several 1 times and said he did
not approve of her long interviews with
tradespeople. He. was on the stand all
morning and denied that he ever accused
bis wife of unfaithfulness or ever struck
her. ' During his testimony Dr. O'Don
nell's name was mentioned and mucn of
the evidence was of a very repulsive
nature.
At one time Watson consulted the Rev.
Mr. Strong about his daughter and the
father-in-law said he did not know any
thing that would justify in taking any
steps in the matter. He referred to a
quarrel which they had when he discov
ered some tags for goods which had been
sent to the co-respondent Reed. .He de
nied exhibiting a revolver on any oc
casion and stated tbat his wife was too
fond of wine.
This afternoon the defense was com
pleted and if the prosecution takes ad
vantage of the privilege of introducing
testimony in rebuttal the case may last a
few days longer.
The )Vatsons are a very obscure Ala
meda family and were never heard of in
social or active life until Mr. Watson
became suspicious of his wife's attention
to others and brought suit for divorce.
The names of many respectable people
have been injected into the case without
sense or reason in an attempt to make the
paltry action appear sensational. . L .-

The reports to be presented during the
session will show that the order is in a
healthy condition in the entire jurisdic
tion, and that it has held its own as to
membership. ...i^v.~
One of the most important matters to
come up during the session will be the
consideration of ti.e existing endowment
system by which the beneficiary of . each
member receives $2000, that is if the mem
ber is married. With unmarried members
it is optional whether they take out a cer
tificate of endowment.
The present plan does not meet, with
the views of the majority of the member
ship and some time ago a committee on
endowment was appointed to prepare a
plan that would meet the views of these
members, but the. report they presented
did not receive the support of the lodges
it was expected it would. A number of
the local lodges appointed a conference
committee that prepared a plan which, it
is likely, will be adopted with possibly one
or two modifications In addition to these
two there will be presented for considera
tion a plan submitted by Albert Ekus and
one that is known in fraternal circles as
the Morse equalization plan. .
Another matter that will come up for
discussion wi*l be a proposition to abolish
"the religious free school wbich has been
sustained by. the lodges of the district at
an annual cost of $1750. This has been
open not only to the children of members,
but to the children of any Hebrew, though
not a member of the order. Of late many
of the lodges have come to the conclusion
that this is a pretty heavy tax on the
membership and for that reason a move
ment will be made to have tbe school
abolished. â¢: * [-*:'-*:'"_ ......

MEMORABLE START
AT EMERYVILLE
Two of a Field of Four
Dispatched by the
Starter.
"Skeets" Martin Under a Cloud

tina.
Ostler Joe Carried Educated Money and
Wonâ livi Favorites in Front.
Mahogany First at 50 to 1.
There is a singular feeling of danger
and excitement experienced in putting
down a bet at Emeryville that is unfath
omable. There is an element of uncer
tainty about it that causes the face to
wrinkle and the bair to turn gray prema
turely. The old-timer, accustomed to re
verses, enjoys it, because the disgust and
ravings of the tenderfoot acts as a sooth
ine lotion to his hungry-looking pocket.
There was a race run at Emeryville yes
terday that caused these same weather
' beaten veterans to scratch their heads in
an endeavor to recall its equal. Four
well-backed horses started in a seven and
a half furlong race, and two were left at
the post.
This farcical pantomime on racing was
the fifth race on the card, and the an
nounced starters were Chartreuse . 11,
Midlo, Applause and Alvarado. It never
occurred to the backers of these horses
that nearly fifty minutes would be con
sumed in an endeavor to send them away
from the post, yet such was the case. In
the betting Chartreuse was a pronounced
choice, with Applause heavily in demand.
The latter mate had shown a very fast
mile in private and her stable folks un
loaded a bundle of coin on her chances.
Tne other two starters were also exten
sively played at trifie longer prices. At
the post both Applause and Alvarado un
folded equine pianks that were supposed
to have long ago become extinct. Weary
and patience-worn Starter Ferguson,
when nearly an 1 our had been wasted,
vainly importuned his assistant to com
mit suicide or else line them up. The
judges had sounded the bell to send them
away regardless of results many minutes
before, but Mr. Ferguson thought of bis
record and could not find the heart to do
it. Then again, each horse had received
substantial support, and when one specu
lates a run is expected for the amount in
vested.
When everything looked -* darkest
Thomas H. Williams Jr. strode over to
the post and took the starting-flag from
Mr. Ferguson's hand. The Burns and
Waterhouse in try, Midlo, and the favor
ite, Chartreuse, broke away and Mr.
Williams swished the flag. Several thou
sand dollars bet on Applause and Alva
rado was burned up by this fall of red
bunting. Ferguson could nave sent three
o: the starters away early in the game,
and President Williams' starting was not
appreciated by the crowd, who plainly
manifested their disapproval. Chartreuse
beat Midlo very handsomely in 1:35*4.
The nice, with its many peculiar features,
will provide gossip for tne regulars for
tome time to come.
For a change five favorites out of s'x
breasted me wire first. The crowd had
their betting clothes on and speculation
in the ring was of the briskest sort. Per
fect weatner and a good track were favor
able to fast time.
The mile purse event had a very sus
picious flavor about it. Argentina, the
Baldwin entry, warmed like a cyclone in
her preliminary eallop and looked like
ready money. Uncanny rumors were
prevalent about her in the ring, causing
the mare's price to recede in the betting.
Her showing under "Skeets" Martin's
pilotage justified these rumors, for she
finished fourth after displaying all sorts of
speed to the stretch. Ostler Joe, backed
down to 6to 5 under weight of the edu
cated coin, romped in before Peter II in
the slow time of 1:42*4. Frank Jau bert
was third.
Of the twelve starters in the first race
run, a six furlong selling dash, with light
welter-weights up, Ben Benjamin's black
gelding Yaldoshad a call in the betting at
threes, but got mixed up in the bumping
match that ensued in the s. retch and
failed to show. Mahogany, a 50 to 1
chance, with McDonald up, came out oi
the rumpus unscathed and won cleverly
from Marionette, another outsider.
The mi c run following went to the 7 to
10 favorite, Olive, ridden by Bob Isom.
The mare looked beaten before striking
the stretch, but ciraa fast the last part,
beating Last Chance out a head in 1 :43%.
Miss Ruth finished in the show.
Third on tbe card was a six-furlong spin
for three-year-olds, which was taken by
the Baldwin entry, Bernardiho, a 13 to 20
choice in the betting. Looking beaten at
one stage the gelding responded to Mar
tin's riding in the stretch, downing Don
Clarencio a head. Barney Schreiber's
Sugar Foot was a bang-up third at the end.
Tally Coulter's mare California fell in
with a dull crowd in the final race of the
day over six furlongs, and, starting a 7 to
10 choice, won hands down from Poten
tate and Lost Girl.
NOXJ*-..
'-_"'" i
Jack Riley, the tipster, had Mahogany
as tbe "good thing" of the day's racing
card.
In future at Emeryville track bad actors
at the post will be given bat one trial at
the post. After one recall they will be
left at the post. ;' / i ' *
During the long delay at the post yester
day, Ferguson pulled the lever and all
four of the starters were left standing.
Now the question arises if there bad been
no recall flag, which one would the ring
have had to pay off on?
Ed Corrigan, who took a flying trip over
the Rockies, arrived from Chicago Wednes
day evening.
The judges called for tbe bookmakers'
sheets at the conclusion of the Ostler Joe
race, and it is quite apparent that their
observations and researchers were none
too favorable to "ijkeets" Martin, who
rode Argentina in the race.
Judge Burke stated at the conclusion of
the race that Martin had been warned
tbat on the first occasion of any crooked
or suspicious riding on his part be would
be ruled off the turf. This is not the first
time tbis promising rider has been called
into the stand to explain away hypnotical
rides, and it seems about* time that
"Skeets" remembered that there's an end
to every piece of rope.
Captain Harris, one of tbe official timers,
who was thrown from his horse last week,
is confined to bis bed, having received
quite a severe shaking up.
Opening at 20 to 1 Frank Jaubert went
to 100 to 1 in tbe betting and was then
played down to 30 to 1. .... -
Starter Ferguson at one time concluded
to send the quartet of starters in the fiftn
race away to a flag start, but orders from
the stand forbade this. Tbey could all
have then been dispatched, and it seems
as tnough it would have been as fair for
one as another. Judge Burke stated tbat
the ring did not book on the race under
this consideration, which prevented the
old style of starting being resorted to. Are
the public entitled to any consideration?
Potentate was plainly beaten out â  by
Lost Girl for place in the last race, bat tbe
Burns <fc Waterhouse horse was given the
decision. â j
The combination book was ordered yes

The First Baptist Church Reports a
Quiet but Prosperous Year.
At the annual meeting of the Firt Bap
tist Church Wednesday evening the re
ports of various organizations were read,
showing deep interest and earnest work
for the year.
Tbe election of officers resulted in a
choice of tbe old board of trustees,
which is composed of D. M. Cunnan, N.
Brace, C. S. Bare ford, F. F. Weill and G.
H. Moore. ;O. C. Pope was re-elected
church clerk. 3. C. Wright' was made
treasurer and Mrs. B. C. Wright assistant
treasurer; Professor J. A. Wiles, chief
usher; Mrs. M. Gardiner, Mrs. N. Brace,
Mrs. James Patterson and Mrs. AT. A.
Clark were re-elected deaconesses.
During the year 1896 109 persons have
joined the church and twenty-five have
been dismissed, a net gain of eighty-four.
The treasurer's report showed that not
withstanding the straitened times the in
come of the year met all expenses as well
as reducing the floating debt by a consid
erable amount.
During the year tbe Ladies' Aid So
ciety was most active, and it was due to
their efforts that tbe interior of the church
was thoroughly renovated and was made
more comfortable.
CONSUMPTIVE COWS.
Herman Vogel Fined 8100 for Violating
the Health nance.
Herman Vogel, butcher, San Bruno road
and Silver avenue, appeared lor sentence
before Judge Conlan yesterday morning.
He was arrested Tuesday night by Meat
Inspector Davis and Policeman Butter
worth while killing a consumptive cow in
the rear of his shop. When asked if he had
anything to say why sentence should not
be* passed upon him he said he had kille.i
the cow for P. L. Salomon, a neighboring
butcher, who was to pay him $1 for the
job.
The excuse had no effect upon the
Judee. who sentenced Vogel to pay a fine
of $100. The fine was paid. Salomon was
in court and the Judge ordered Policeman
Butterworth to arrest him and charge him
with violating the health ordinance.
Louis Pata, who helped Vogel to kill the
cow, was arrested Wednesday night by
Butterwortb. His case was called in court
yesterday, but was continued till to-mor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 1897.
WANTS HIS MONEY
FROM THE CONSUL
E. G. Kelton of Mazatlan
Sued for Money
Deposited. '
He Took $500 for Safe Keeping
and Went Through In
solvency.
The Man Who Owned Goat Island
Appears as Plaintiff in a
Strange Case. â  . '
The man who. like Robinson Crusoe on
Juan Fernandez, was once monarch of all
he surveyed on Goat Island, was in the
Superior Court of this City and County
Tuesday afternoon as plaintiff against E.
G. Kelton, formerly United Slates Consul
at Mazatlan. ":-*'
At one time he was the proud possessor,
the lord and master of Yerba Buena Island
in Ban Francisco Bay, but then it was
known by another name, that of Sea Bird
Island, a cognomen which suggested itself
to the early settlers on account of the
number of sea fowl seen upon ihe barren
rocks.
80 it was known when Samuel Moore
made his first appearance in California as
early as 1848.
The island in the middle of the bay
offered many inducements to him, but
none to the Spanish residents and officials,
who gladly gave him a grant to tne sea
girt territory. Moore immediately took
up his abode there with a herd of goats,
whicb caused the name of the island to
change imperceptibly with ttie going of
the birds and the coming of the herds. In
the course of years Uncle Sam determined
to possess the island. Much red tape was
measured out in course of the process ol
taking the land for Federal purposes, and
as a result, Moore still retains bundles of
documents showing that the Government
bought the property and paid him some
thing like $2,000,000, which, however, be
never received. Tbe money passed through
otner hands, as the railway company had
some connection with the matter. Any
how, Moore lost island and money.
The old man declares be is one of the
most unfortunate of men in business deal
ings with others. As in the case of the
island he was unfortunate in a transaction
with ex-United States Consul Kelton at
Mazatlan in 1883 This involves $500 which
was left with the Consul for safekeeping un
til Moore should return. According to the
documents in the case submitted on briefs
Tuesday, Moore's attorney., McNair &
Somers, contend tbat the transaction was
in tbe nature of a bailment in trust; that
the Consul was custodian oi the money
instead of a mere debtor, and accordingly
could not lav a defense on the statute of
limitations. The defense claimed to avoid
payment under this statute, and also on
the ground that' Kelton bad been through
insolvency at Mazatlan. 'So tne case rests.
Moore, it is sail, may be regarded as an
eccentric and odd cbaractor, a native of
Chile, who came to the United State
when 19 years of age. That was in 1845,
and he entered ttie navy, in which he
served for three years, until getting his
shore legs agr.in in California in 1848.
He then secured possession of Goat Island
and among other acquisitions got a section
or portion of a section of land in Sacra
mento, where the capitol stands to-day.
He claims some kind of title to half the
city of Sacramento. From here he went
to Maza'lan in the earlier days and there
he lived for some time. In 1883 he re
turned to Calilornia to look after a lawsuit
over his property, and it was then the
money was deposited in ex-Consul Keiton' s
keeping. Moore holds the receipt, signed
April 14, 1883.
Eleven years later, after Moore had
traveled abroad and rested alternately
near Sacramento, he made a demand
through the Bank of California for his
$500 d< posited with Kelton. The draft was
returned with the information that Kel
ton had been through insolvency. Other
news was to the effect that he had died,
although the ex-Consul was seen in San
Francisco in "the interim. He served on
the United States Grand Jury and acted in
various capacities for the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company.-.
Subsequently he' was agent for Weils,
Fargo & Co. and the steamship company
in Central America. He is now in Guate
mala in some such office. If the ease were
decided in Moore's favor he cannot re
cover anything, as Kelton has no prop
erty wnich might be attached for debt.
EUREKA VALLEY CLUB.
A Vigorous Protest Against the Pro
posed Location of the .rest-house.
The people of Eureka Valley, within the
shadow of the Twin Peaks, have their
grievance as well as others less favored by
the fact of having their homes nestling on
the sunny side of the switchback hill.
Among the many ills whicu they
proclaim against is one in particular that
of being in darkness after the sun hides
its siining face behind the "-. peaks. To
remedy this they have, through the
medium of their improvement club, peti
tioned the Supervisors for five additional
electric lights, to be distributed as follows:
Two on State street, between Castro and
Diamond. Sixteenth and Seventeenth,
one on Corbett road, one on Moss and
Casein avenue, and one on Merritt, be
tween Hattie, Danvers, Clover and Caselli
avenue, making five in all. Should this
prayer be answered and the lights placed
there a vote ol thanks may be expected at
the City Hall.
ÂThe Street Superintendent's attention
is called through the club to a pile of
rubbisn left on the Corbett road by some
contractor who wished his memory pre
served by all passing teamsters, who are
compelled to pull into private lands in
order to pass it by.
The proposed location of tba Pest house
on the favored Almshouse tract has
broueht forth 1000 signatures in opposi
tion to its being placed there.
The last kick of the property-owners in
the valley is directed against Attorney
Mhoon, who has informed tbem that un
| less they come to his terms in settling
with him for the. services rendered in de
feating the Fell-street sewer assessment
he will place a lien on their property.

A BIG JOB UNCOVERED AT THE
CITY AND COUNTY HOSPITAL
An Investigation Reveals Fraud and Falsity in the
Estimates Upon Wliich Bills Were
Allowed.
EXPERTS AT WORK ON
THE BOOKS.
Kalsomining Charges That Appall
the Members of the Board
of Health.
THE GRAND JURY WILL BE
ASKED TO ACT.
Expanses for Repairs Paid From the
General Fund and Time Checks
"Kited."
A condition of affairs that savors of a
big job at least, if not of fraud, has been
uncovered at the City and County Ho.pi
tal. Experts in the employ of the Board
of Health have discovered that the greater
portion of the appropriation of $10,000,
provided for repairs on that institution,
has been squandered in payment of bills
that were "'cited."
The books show that repairs properly
belonging to the repair fund have oeen
transferred to the general hospital fund.
Time checks have been paid for which
there is no evidence of work performed.
Extortionate charges mark every piece of
work done in the repairs.
The condition of things is so serious that
the Grand Jury is to be asked to investi
gate the matter, and there is probability
of two or three indictments at least. The
Hospital Committee of the Supervisors
was made aware of the state of affairs yes
terday and an expert employed by the
City will at once begin an official investi
gation of the management of the institu
tion under Dr. Stahle.
Dr. J. M. Williamson, the present super
intendent, is responsible for the expose.
When he succeeded Dr. Stahle a few days
ago an inspection or. the hospital con
vinced him that the improvements for
which the City had been taxed were very
slight.
W. D. Griffin, the official expert of the
Board of Health, was at once called in,
and the result Of his labors up to last
night revealed that while the appropria
tion of $10,000 has already been over
drawn to the extent of $759, the nature of
the repairs consist' principally of open
Bewers. a couple of sheds on the grounds
and a few slight repairs in plumbing and
ventilating. As far as the investigation
has gone, and it is only in its inception,
evidences of extortion and absolute fraud
have been found.
On December 18 the sum of $275 was
paid to F. Flynn lor lathing and plaster
ing. The work performed by Flynn was
done on closets in lour wards. In Ward
A tbÂ«Â» area attended to was ten square
leet, according to measurements made Dy
Griffin, assisted by Officer Lutterworth,
the official measurer of tlie board in
Chinatown; in Ward B _2J_ feet; in Ward
C, including theainkroom, about four feet,
and a simile*, area ii. Ward D.
This makes a total of all ol" not over 40
square feet which the City paid to have
lathed and plastered at the rate of over
$6 per foot; and. to make matters worse,
tbere are no indications of any lathing.
This is bad enough, but when the charge
of $480 of J. Muicreavy for concrete work
the condition of affairs becomes peculiarly
interesting. In this bill Mulcreavy de
tails each piece of work performed. The
measurements of the storeroom are set
down at 24x24 feet, while the measure
ments of Griffin and Butterworth show
that the room is only 24x19:6 feet, show
ing an overcharge for 104 square feet oi
work.
The vegetable-room Mulcreavy charged
at the rate of 27 by 27 feet, In reality itis
but .seventeen .feet square, showing that
the City has paid lor just 440 feet of work
that could not possibly have been per
formed. The butcher-shop is Bet down in
the bill as 28 by 17 feet, which happens to
be correct.
Three of the passageways were con
creted. The measurement of the first is
charged for on the basis of 9 by 50 feet; in
reality it is only forty-six feet long.
A second pas^-a eway is put down as 15
feet long by 10 wide. It is but eleven feet
long and six leet wide.
In all tbe Mulcreavy bill calls for
664 extra feet of work, and, taking his
own figures for each square foot of work
done, the work of Griffin and Butterworth
shows that the City wus overcharged the
sum of $211 79, which the Bonrd of Health
thinks is pressing the limit in a total of
$480.
When Dr. Williamson heard of the dis
crepancies in the measurements of the
various rooms repaired by Mulcreavy they
asked Dr. Dudley, the resident physician,
and Steward Paul Edwards to go over the
work again. The figures returned by Dud
ley and Edwards tallied with those of
Griffin and Butterworth, and are now
accepted by the board as positive evidence
that in the case of concrete repairs the
City was defrauded.
There is another bill for kalsomining
among the long list of repairs in which
the $10,000 appropriation was exhausted.
It is a charge of $1275 for whitewashing
nine closets and sin k rooms and a small
number of other apartments. This bill
the experts do not hesitate to declare is
grossly extortionate. The rooms referred

to in the bill are in as bad a condition now
as before the work was done. The white
wash has peeled and fallen off.
The plumbing cuts a big item in the
general expense, and this work is to be
measured at once. The work will prob
ably take a week and some interesting
facts are expected to i Â«â  revealed.
Tbe general payroll shows that there
were time-checks i.onored.for which there
is positively no evidence of any work be
ine done.
The irregularities in charging the cost of
repairs to the general funds of the hospi
tal has induced the Board of Health to
employ a skillful accountant to go over
the books of the institution under Dr.
Stable's administration.
This work will possibly take a month's
time. Every item of repairs in the long
list, which has already cost $10,789, will be
measured and examined in detail. There
are rumors that when the subject of the
contracts for supplies is reached it will be
found that milk and vegetables were very
costly luxuries. Instances are recorded
where turnips were purchased for 55
cents a dozen when selling in the open
market for 12 cents.
Supervisors Rottanzi, Dodge and Clin
ton, as the Hospital Committee, visited
the hospital yesterday, and, after learning
the results of tbe expert's work, declared
their intention of going before the Grand
Jury at once, and asking the members to
probe the affair to the bottom. -
'â¢It's the worst condition of things,"
said Dr. Rottanzi, "I ever heard of. No
other wora will suit it but plain down
right theft. The guilty ones will be prose
cuted at once."
Dr. Henry H. Hart, the chairman of the
Hospital Committee of the Board of
Health, said last night that the results of
the work of the experts thus far indicated
some startline revelations to follow.
"This is but the beginning," said Dr.
Hart, "but we are fully satisfied that
something is radically wrone. . We will
push the investigation to the bottom and
bring the guilty ones to justice, if possi
ble. We have appointed an expert ac
countant of the books of the institution,
because we believe the real story lies
there."
Ex-Steward Robinson denies that he |
had anything to do with the disposition of j
the repair fund. The Board of Health
say that this is not quite probable, and
will probably ask Robinson and Stahle for
information to-day. * 'â¢' .

With a Handsome Token,
When A. J. Vining, past commander of

drummed out, and shortly afterward, to
his bewilderment, drummed in again.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY, 22, 1897.
Some Rats Have Been Pilfering Cigars From the Lockers of the
Police Officers at the Potrero Station for Two Years,
Utterly Mystifying: the Detectives.
A MYSTERY OF
POTRERO STATION
The Lockers of the Officers
Regularly Robbed Dur
ing Two Years.
Every Man Led to Suspect His
. Fellows, but the Detectives
Utterly Foiled.
Rats Discovered to Have Filched a
Bushel of Good Cigars From
the Lockers.
For two long years Officer Bob Macon
nell, not naturally a suspicious man, has
suffered witb a doubt on his mind. Macon
nell is the office-man at the Potrero police
station. Big Tom Stanton, Clancy, Dough
erty and Lewis all officers of the station
â have not been free irom doubt either
any more than they have been free from
suspicion. . *.' *
Maconnell is an inveterate smoker and
makes it a point never to be without a
1 cigar -that is he has tried to make it a
point, but the cigars that he laid away in
his locKer have disappeared with a regu
larity that has been the mystery of the
station lor these two years and that has
caused suspicion in the mind of Macon
nell to lower over the heads of. all the
other officers.
To be sure all the other officers com
plained occasionally themselves of the
loss of choice cigars which they may have
stowed away in their lockers for some
after-dinner occasion. But to Maconnell
this only served to feed suspicion â guilty
men would have done that same thing.
But Clancy, and Stanton, and Dougherty,
and Lewis, and Lieutenant Bennett him
self, bad all of them really missed cigars
time and again â they knew that their
complaints were as well based as
those of Macconnell, they had carefully
placed a choice brand now and again in a
snug place in their respective lockers,
turned the key, shook the door so there
could bs no mistake about it being locked
and turned homeward to their dinner with
a feeling that things were well with them
and lile was altogether worth Jiving.
They had returned to the station with a
mind even more tuned to contentment,
drifted straight to the locker, adjusted the
key in the Yale lock, opened the door, felt
in the little secret, corner for the cigar that
was to have given an emphasis to all the
blessings of their lot and discovered that
it was not there.
That had occurred so often that it came
to be recognized at last as the mystery
of the station, for which no man could be
held responsible. Every man set himself
to solve it, so that the blame might be
placed where it belonged. Tom Stanton
said he would discover the thief or never
more lay claim to consideration as a de
tective. Tom has long made claims in
that direction, and there is a picture of
him pasted even now on the walls of the
station representing him in the guise of a
sleuth.
Tom thought and thought and laid
plans and plans, but the cigars disap
peared as rapidly as they were laid away
in the lockers, and the mystery only deep
ened. Tom labeled some cigars with pri
vate marks and loaded ihem with ex
plosives and substituted twisted cigars for
straight ones, and still they disappearedâ
marks and twists and explosives and all â
disappeared utterly. No on. was seen
smoking the markeo. orthe twisted cigars,
and certainly no cigars were heard to
blow up about the station.
Maconnell stroked ; bis whiskers more
solemnly as the months went on and the
gloom of the uncanny thing settled more
heavily about the place. One morning,
being left alone for some time, he made
use of the occasion to take off the lock and
put on a new one. ' J -J :_. ; :
"Now we'll see how long I can leave a
cigar in here for my own exclusive use,"
he said grimly, running his fingers
through his whiskers again. An hour
afterward the cigar that he had placed
there as the test was gone. Did he swear?
Oh, yes, he swore, but he was rattier more
amazed and worried now than angry, for
he bad not been out of the station and he
knew that no tangible and visible form
could have "worked the box."
All this time Lieutenant Bennett had
been suffering from malaria or some other
influence of a depressing nature. A few
days ago he determined to make some
changes in the arrangement of things in
the station looking to better sanitary con
ditions, as well as more light and room.
The row of much pilfered lockers was torn
away and the floor pulled up. Behind
some boards that had been nailed against
the wall, leaving a space in the corner as
large as a bushel basket, was found a rat's
nest composed entirely of cigars. ..*'.:
There were several hundred of them,
and among the number, were several .of
Tom Stanton's twisters. The cigars were
mostly broken and chewed to pieces, but
they seemed to form a very cozy nest.
No rats were there, and it is only. Lieuten
ant Bennett's guess that they were rats
rats that had formed the bad habit of the
use of tobacco through loafing about the
police station, or that had. wisely chosen
the material as a protection against fleas.
At any rate the mystery that had hung
over the Potrero station for two years,
vexing and defeating the best efforts of its
detective talent, was solved!',' ,;,

chinery, assembled in the handsome audi
torium of the institution to enjoy a pro
gramme, musical and oratorical. -
Edward Coleman, president of the Pa
cific Coast Rolling-mills, occupied the
chair, and delivered a brief opening ad
dress. The audience was also warmly
welcomed by General Secretary McCoy ,
who later in the evening expatiated elo
quently on the numerous attractions and
advantages which the Y. M. C. A. affords
its patrons.
The most noteworthy and distinctive
feature of the evening's entertainment
was an address by Irving M. Scott of the
Union Iron Works. He spoke, as one
whose profession entitles him to speak, of
what the mechanical arts and sciences
have accomplished for humanity.
'The mechanic." he said, "is more than
a man. He is a man and a mechanic, too.'
Most of the luxuries and grand enter
prises of to-day are the work of. the me
chanic. This concentration of intelligent
force, agitated along well-known lines,
makes the constructive engineer or the
educated mechanic a colossus in the do
main of human production.
"All the wealth the world possesses,
whether stored in the caverns, in the
rocks, the bowels of the earth, in the sky
or in the sea, respond * to the touch of the
skilled mechanic and obeys the laws
wbich be has studied and developed.
Thus recognizing the position of the me
chanic in the economy of civilization, we
have in this hall a mechanics' night."
The speaker contrasted the widely dif
fused comforts and luxuries of modern
times with the squalor and discomlort
shared alikÂ» by king and peasant 300
years ago. At that time the mechanic had
no place in tne social scale.
Since then he has risen to the realization
of a position which enables him to aspire
to every honorable occupation. "The
Queen of Sbeba or King Solomon him
self," exclaimed Mr. Scott, in a forcible
passage, "never went upstairs in an ele
vator."
Coming nearer home he alluded to the
successful achievements of San Francisco
in the mechanical world.
"What a mighty race," he said, "might
we not be if we could but bold fast to all
the virtues and shake loose from all the
vices of those civilizations . which have
preceded us. In this country where schools
are free and the workshops open to the
young, we ought to find the highest type
of human being of which history has
record.
"If we are true to the principles upon
which our Government is founded, true to
ourselves and to the arts mechanical,
there is no doubt that in the future we
may rise to a higher and a nobler plane.
Let us therefore put shoulder to brother's
shoulder and strive steadfastly for the
consummation of that grand object, when
humanity shall live as God intended it
should live, in brotherly peace, charity
and love."
The balance of the programme included
selections by the California Quartet and
the Columbian orchestra, recitation and
character monologue, by Professor C. B.
Newton, recitation by" Rev. Dr. Henry
Varley,-the celebrated English evangelist,
and finally an athletic exnibition and a
game of basket-ball in the gymnasium.
Nursery for Homeless Children.
t The annual meeting of the board of mana
gers of the San Francisco Nursery for Home
less: Children was held at the nursery, 570
Harrison street, Tuesday, January 12. The
following ladies will serve as officers of the
board for the coming year: President, Mrs. S.
E. Holiis; first vice-president. Mrs. F. hertz;

urer, Mrs. Samuel B. McLenegan. ,-
The debt of $900 which confronted those
interested in the institution on January 1,
1890, has been .educed. to $300 . during the
year, and still . the home has < had within its
walls seventy-two children, four more than
ever before.
Earnest effort on the part of .the ladies
of the board, together : with the ; kind
co-operation of friends, has brought about
this encouraging state of affairs, but it is the
sincere hope of every one interested that new
friends enough may be gained to assist in en
tirely wiping out the present indebtedness.

Emergency Home Enter
tainment at Native
Sons' Hall-
Many Features of the Programme
Were by O.ympic Club
Members.
The Success of the Affair Largely
Due to the Efihrts of Mrs.
William F sher.
A fair-sized audience spent a delightful
time in Native Sons' Hall last evening
enjoying a vaudeville programme given
to raise funds for a permanent institution
to be known as the Emergency Home for
Waifs.
The affair was entirely under the man
agement of Mrs. .William Fisher, vice
president of the home, as Mrs. John
Pettee, the president, fell ill yesterday
morning and was unable to be present.
Both ladies have devoted most of their
time during the last three days to making
arrangements for the entertainment and
assisting in the sale of tickets.
The programme opened with an over
ture by Blanchard's orchestra, being fol
lowed by the Girls' Alumnae Glee Club,
under the leadersnip of Baroness Yon
Meyerlnck.
Then came a boxing contest by Messrs.
Philip Wand and Stuart Carter of the
Olympic Club. They cuffed each other
energetically for three fast rounds. Cap
tain Howard Taylor acted as master of
ceremonies and timekeeper.
Miss Caroline Shindler, a soprano song
stress favorably known In local musical
circles, rendered the song "To Sevilla"
and was encored.
Messrs. Steyman, Toohing and Mc-
Nally of the Acme Athletic Club gave a
clever exhibition of acrobatic features
and were recalled as a compliment for
their efforts.
Messrs. Dana Thompson and Frank
Duck of the Olympic Club appeared in a
character sketch embracing tumbling and
clownish features. Thompson is the cele
brated boy swimmer and Duck a very
nimble acrobat.
The Knickerbocker quartet, composed
of Messrs. D. M. Lawrence, C. M. Elliot,
D. B. Crane and L. A. Larsen, finished the
excellently rendered programme with sev
eral choice vocal selections.
The floor was cleared of chairs and a
majority of those present devoted their
service to the muse of dance till some
"wee sma' hour avant the twa."
Mrs. Fisher is enthusiastic on the sub
ject of the Emergency Home for Waifs,
and is happy that her efforts toward it
have been so well appreciated. Similar
entertainments may follow, s*
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Some of the Specialties in " The Devil's
Auction" â Coming Attractions
for >"ext Week.
"The Devil's Auction" is one of the
most attractive performances that the
Colombia Theater has had for some time.
All its variety "turns" are clever. Some
of those which appear to have pleased the
public most are the comic cyclers, as
sisted by the clever trick rider Alexander
Decker, and the aerial grotesque act of
Tonner and Fro bei, who perform on a
frail ladder and trapeze attached to the
highest point of the proscenium arch.
Miss Mayo, the singing and dancing sou
brette, has becomÂ« quite a favorite, and
Richard T. Brown's varied performances
make him one of" the leading features of
the present edition of "The Devil's Auc
tion."
"Jack and the Beanstalk" is just closing
a very successful run at the Tivoli. Its
last performance will take place on Sun
day evening. . "Montana" will open on
Monday night for five, performances, and
on Saturday evening, the 30th inst.,
"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp" will
be produced. '
The members of the Alcazar company,
aided by Company L, First Regiment,
N. G. C, are giving successful perform
ances of "A Fair Rebel." The play is
prettily staged, and the receiving of tele
graphic messages is a feature that never
fails to interest the audience. Next Mon
day "All the Comforts of Home" will be
revived.
The Orpheum's bill is drawing well this
week as usual. The Frantz Family's
startling gymnastic performances are in
teresting the public, and John Wilson's
tramp impersonation has taken well. The
Hungarian orchestra remains one of the
chief attractions of tbe bill.
"Against the Stream" is proving popu
lar at the Grand Opera-house. The drama
is an interesting one and has some very
realistic effects. *>â 
TO AID THE MAYOR.
A Humored Bill to Give Him Greater
Appointing Power.
It was rumored at the City Hall yester
day that the Mayor and Board of Super
visors bad agreed upon a bill for the
modification of the City government, to
be sent to Sacramento. - '
By its provisions, the rumor runs, the
Mayor is to be given the power to appoint
park, police and fire commissioners, also
membersof the Board of Health. Other
provisions tend to transfer various powers
from the State's chief Executive to the
Mayor and Board of Supervisors. '>Â§Â£$&Â£
Seen in regard to the matter last night,
Mayor Phelan said : "I do not know any
thing about the matter, and I have little

SONOMA PEOPLE
UP IN ARMS
Aroused Against Making
the Town a Sunday
Resort.
Attempt of the Railroad to
Lease tho Vallejo Place
for Picnics.
President Foster Says No Lease Has
Been Madeâ Would Make It a
High-C'ass Resort.
The good people and all kinds of people
over in the valley at Sonoma are agitated
over the possibility of the establishment
of a picnic ground at that place.
For some time the principal officials of
the San Francisco and North Pacific Coast
Railway Company have been revolving in
their minds the question of presenting to
the everyday and Sunday picnic public a
new resort. Railroad experience shows
that something new in the way of Sunday
resorts is the bait that catches the crowd,
and the San Francisco and North Pacific
Coast people desired to satisfy such a de
mand during the coming picnic and Sun
day outing season.
President A. W. Foster, General Mana
ger H. C. Whiting and General Passenger
Agent R. X. Ryan had a site at Sonoma
in mind, and ihe other day they got into
a private car and ran up to the wine cen
ter to look at it. Â-.,.
The site is the beautiful old Vallejo
place, near Sonoma.
. A visit from so many railroad officials at
one time naturally attracted considerable
attention and aroused much curiosity in
tbe town. But when the railroad trio
drove out to the Vallejo place, looked it
over and bad a protracted conference with
Mrs. Emparon, the daughter of the late
general and pioneer, speculation on the
object of the visit changed. In a few
days it became known that the railroad
company had talked to Mrs. Emparon on
the subject of renting the place for a pub
lic resort. Then all kinds of people ob
jected.
President A. W. Foster. was seen yester
day afternoon concerning the matter. He
said in substance:
"We have been considering the leasing
of the Vallejo place and making a picnic
resort of it. We called on Mrs. Emparon.
but could get no satisfaction from . her,
She wanted us to name a figure, and we
asked her to name terms. She did not do
so and has not done so, and we shall not
ask her again. There is absolutely nothing
in the whole matter to speak about.
"As to Glen Ellen, we have never had
an idea of abandoning it," he said. "We
have a long lease of the grounds. We in
tended, .to .present both Glen Ellen and
Sonoma to the public, but we expected to
make the Sonoma grounds attractive to
the best class of people."
CELESTIAL SCENERY.
Interesting Astronomical Lecture by
'â¢â  Miss Rose O'Halloran.
Those interested in astronomical- sub
jects were attracted in large numbers to
the Union-square Hall last night to hear
Miss Rose O'Halloran , one of the directors
of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific
Coast, deliver .'an \ illustrated lecture on
"Celestial^Scenery." More than sixty
splendid views of the heavenly bodies
were displayed by means of the stereopti
con during the evening.
' The lecturer, having introduced ncr
subject with a ; few observations on the
modern development of astronomical sci*
ence, proceeded to discuss the planets,
comets and nebula; in rapid detail. The
moon, she said, was not a world
vaguely known, but a real locality, dis
tinctly measured and having a topogra
phy more familiar than some portions of
the earth. The chief characteristics of the
moon are the absence of visible water, the
scarcity of mountain chains, the multi
plicity of mountains in ring form and the
strange system of white streaks which
radiate from some of them.
The planets Mars and Saturn were sub
sequently described. The former is known
to have light and dart* tracts upon its sur
face; to rotate on its axis every twenty
four and a half hours, and to have white
polar tracts, whicb increase and decrease
in extent, as in the case of the Arctic and
Antartic regions on the earth. It was only
within the last few years, however, that
the so-called canals were known to be dis
tributed over its surface. These dark
tracts were formerly supposed to be the
Martian oceans, until in December, 1892,
Mr. Schaeerle of the LioK Observatory
came to a different conclusion, based upon
the presence of lines and ridges by which
these tracts were seen to be crossed. Per
cival Lowell has corroborated this new
theory by the discovery of certain bright
lines never before distinctly discerned. .
The planet Saturn, so unlike any known
to-day in the universe, was a mystery to
astronomers and mathematicians until
the middle of the present century, when
the metereologicalf nature of the ringed
system was suspected and finally de
termined by the spectroscopic researches
of Mr. Keeler of the Alleghany Observa
tory, and of Mr. Doppler. These rings
are now known to be composed of myriads
of small satellites, each revolving in its
own period round the planet.
A slide showing these interesting spec
troscopic phenomena, which Mr. Keeler
made for Professor George Davidson, was,
by the courtesy of the latter, displayed
for the first time last night to a public
audience in this City.
