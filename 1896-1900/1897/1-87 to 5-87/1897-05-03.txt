HORRORS OF THE
GREEK RETREAT
FROM EPIRUS
Blunders Committed During
V the Disorderly Scramble
to Arta.
PACKED MASSES STUMBLE TO A
PLACE OE SAFETY.
Turks Continue to Advance Toward the
Historical Plain of Pharsala, Where
a Decisive Battle May Be
Fought To-Day.
LONDON, Esq., May 2.â Belated special
accounts of the retreat of tne Greeks on
Thursday to Arta reveal inexplicable neg
lect in not re-enforcing the hard-pressed
front lines, although there was an abund
ance of men and guns within easy dis- j
tance.*- While the Turks maintained a
vigorous fusillade some of the Greek guns j
which were well placed were unaccount
ably silent and eventually withdrawn.
The Evzones or mountaineers made a good ',
stand, firing steadily and effectively until !
ordered to retire. When they left their j
-positions it was with groans of disgust, i
Other troops left their posts without i
orders.
The retreat occurred under cover of the
darkness and the rouio was along perilous
mountain paths into the highway leading
to Arta, where it proceeded in utter con
â fusion. A packed mass of troops stumbled
. along sullenly and silently without hurry
ing. There was no apparent excitement,
- only a stubborn resolve not to face the
_.*.-. and i.ie mass moved back toward
Arta like a sluggish, it resistible wave.
Officers were utterly powerless to control
the men. Scared inhabitants of villages
along the route mingled with the troops.
Thousands of men, women and children
carrying chattels and driving immense
numbers of cattle, sheep and goats joined
.- the retreating army until the road was
blocked with a rolling mass of terror
- .stricken creatures.
"The cries of parents who had lost chil
,*; dren and children who had lost parents i
.- added to the confusion, while the glare of :
; their burning homes which the Turks
â¢were firing behind them served to remind
â â¢â  the poor people that all they had was lost. '
*.',Arta bridge was reached at 2:30 o'clock in j
â¢the- morning. Hete there was a great !
blockade of artillery, cavalry, infantry, i
... -villagers and animals, but the mass slowly j
*. .filtered across until by dawn there were I
no Greeks on the Turkish side of the
'.. river.
â¢; Thus a division numbering 11,000 men
â¢* with forty guns who had successfully es
â¢*.* tabiished themselves in the enemy's coun- !
.try abandoned their position in a reason- ,
â¢ less panic and made their way back to
â¢the place whence they started to invade \
J Turkish territory.
A special dispatch to the Times from
:.*.. Pharsala dated to-day says there are !
. about 30,000 Greek troops in and about i
'-â¢"the city. They have sixty guns. Infor
mation regarding the Turks is scanty, but i
they are probably advancing from Trik- ,

I kala. The Greeks aro inactive and their ;
â  positions are weak.
A dispatch from Athens confirms the I
: reports of a Turkish repulse at Velestino.
General Smolentz, commander at that
i place, is now regarded as the hero of the
campaign. A foreign officer who wit
j nessed the affair estimates that the Turks
numbered 2000 and the Greeks 8000. He
: doubts whether it was intended as a seri
i ous effort to turn the Greek position. The
1 same officer stales that the Turks are
i steadily advancing on Pharsala, where he
believes a decisive conflict will occur,
! either to-morrow or Tuesday.
Another officer who witnessed the re
i pulse of the Turks at Velestino says the
J Turkish cavalrymen who made the attack
' were mounted on mere ponies. They rode
; close to the Greek lines, fired and then
retired with a loss of thirty men. The
i Greek cavalry pursued them. It is re
's ported they captured nine men and nine
j teen horses. The. retreat of the Greeks
from Epirus remains a mystery. The en
tire Greek loss in that province is esti
mated at 200 killed or wounded.
ATHENS, Greece, May The general
expectation that a decisive battle would
be fought to-day at Pharsala created in
tense anxiety. Groups gathered in the
streets and animatedly discussed the ex
pected combat, but no attack upon the
Greek positions was made by the Turks.
Colonel Tsamavo*. the new Minister of
War, and Theotakis. Minister of the In
terior, arrived at Pharsala at noon and
reviewed the troops, whose morale is now
described as excellent.
Although the Greeks maintained their
position at Velestino they suffered serious
losses. It is reported that the Turks,
when retreating from Velestino, burned
several villages. It is estimated the value
of provisions and war material captured
by the Turks thus far in the campaign is
4,500,000 drachmas (about $900,000).
The deep irritation against members of
the royal family continues. Diplomats
! here held a protracted conference to-day.
| It is believed they discussed the question
; of sending notes to their respective Gov-
I ernments in reference to mediation.
A dispatch from Arta announces that
the Greer force under Colonel Manos,
which recently retired to Arta from Pente
pigadia and Phillipiada, has again ad
vanced into EDiruÂ«, reoccupying Philli
piada. The Turks are strongly entrenched
along the road to Janina, the capital of
the province.

On the right as you pass from Trikeri Channel into the mouth of the Gulf of Volo is a rocky promontory which extends north and south about eight miles. At the
lower end nestled on the slope of the bill at the concave end of a horseshoe-shaped bay is the little town of Volo. Above it on the summit of the hill is a large chateau *
commanding a view of the Gulf of Volo to the north, Trikeri Channel and the iEgean Sea to the east and Oreas Channel and Cape Slauros to the west. On the south
eastern end of the point is the Greek fortress erected since 1881, which commands the entrance to the gulf and the approaches thereto from both east and west. To the
left in the distance is Halmyro Point and the expanse of Volo beyond the point of view is from the hills southeast of the town.
to-night for Epirus, Unusual attention
was attracted to them by the fact that
their standard-bearer is a 17-year-old girl
named Helen Constantinide, daughter of
a local dentist. As the brigade passed
through the streets the girl marched
proudly at its head bearing the Grecian
standard. Crowds along the line enthu
siastically cheered the girl, whom they
compared to Joan of Arc.
She wears the same uniform as the men,
and is a good shot. She declares she does
not fear death, and will fight in the front
rank. Her brother accompanies her.

PILLAGE AND MASSACRE.
Moslems Seem Determined to
Slaughter All Defenseless
Christians In Turkey.
ATHENS, Greece, May 2.â Reports
reaching here show the Turkish soldiery,
though checked by officers in the towns,
are committing hideous atrocities in the
rural districts of Thessaly.
The Albanian troops at Zarkos, about
twenty miles west of Larissa, have massa
cred several inhabitants of that place.
Others would doubtless have been killed
had it not been for the officers who inter
vened.
The Albanians seemed determined to
massacre all the Christians in the place,
and the officers had much difficulty in
rescuing the residents.
The bulk of the population of Thessaly
is so badly frightened at the prospect of
encountering the Turks that they are
fleeing to the mountains. It is evident
from the clothing found upon the Turks
killed in several attacks upon Velestino
and from articles found on their bodien
that there was much pillaging when the
Moslems took Larissa.
The work of equipping the volunteers
and reservists, large numbers of whom
have been in the city considerable timo
waiting to be sent to the front, is now pro
ceeding rapidly. Squads have already
been dispatched to join the forces in
Thessaly.
A dispatch from Volo states the Turks
have evacuated Karditza, about thirty
miles northwest of Pharsala, and the
Greeks have reoccupied that town.

ON PHARSAUA'S FIELD.
The Great Battle for Supremacy
Waged Between Caesar and
â  Pompey. *;;'-â¢ ',
Again the famous field of Pharsalia
seems about to become the scene of an
important and may be decisive contest.
Lying as it does in the center of the
Greeks' new and best line of defense on the
main road from Larissa to Athens, Edhem
Pasha must of necessity reduce it before
advancing further south.
Many times from its first appearance on
the page of history (B. C. 480) to the be
ginning of our era was Pharsalia (now
Pharsala) the scene of contests and sieges
more or less noted, but all of them dwindle
to mere historical incidents in comparison
with the great battle between Caesar and
Pompey, June 29, 48 B. C, which finds
place in history as one of the twelve most
important contests the world has known
in point of resultsâ which gave to one
man the practical if not nominal control
of the mighty Roman empire.
The administration of affairs of the
Roman world had gradually been taken
into the hands of a triumvirate, composed
of Orassr.s, Pompey and Ctesar, who, di
viding the countries controlled by Rome
between themselves, managed each his
own dominion independently of the oth
ers and really of the Senate, which was
largely composed of the creatures and
tools of the three.
The death of Crassus in battle with the
Parthians, June 53, B. CL, put an end to
the triumvirate and precipitated the con
test for the sole control between Pompey
and Caesar. 'V-'S**.?-;--.--*.'-:'
Pompey was in Rome and Caesar at Ra
venna, 240 miles away, where he had
passed the winter. -Backed by the aristo
cratic party, Pompey sought to strip
Caesar of what power he already had by
taking away his legions and finally put
ting himself at the head of the troops on
: band and by raising fresh leves, pre
; pared to march against him.
. On receipt of the news Caesar was quick
to act. He called the Thirteenth Legion
from Tergeste (Trieste) to Ravenna, and
with it crossed the Rubicon, the boundary
of his province, on the night of December
16. 50 B. C, civil war had begun. Leav
ing Rome unmolested he pushed on down
the Adriatic coast, gaining city after city
and recruits, until he had Pompey and
his followers shut up in Brundisium
(Brindisi). Unable to withstand Caesar
in Italy Pompey crossed over to Epirus
sending Scipio to ; Syria* to raise fresh
troops. This was in February, 49 B.C.
Caesar did not immediately , follow, but
turned to the reduction of .Pompey's
power in Spain, Italy and Africa. He re
turned to Brundisium; (Brindisi) Novem
ber 17, 49 B. C, and on the 28th set sail
with seven small legions and 600 horse for
Epirus, leaving Antony to follow with the
rest. He landed at Pa teste (Paliassa), a
short distance north of Corfu, on the 29; h,
and the same day marched over the high
mountains to Oricum and thence to Ap^
palonia (Avlona), and on December 2
headed for Dyrrachium (Durazzo), near
which Pompey lay, the most important
point on the coast, at the terminus of the
paved road, the Via Egnaiia from the
east," via J Therma or Thessalonica
(Salonika) to Italy. Effecting a junction
with Antony, who had followed him over
landine north of "Dyrrachium, he sent de
tachments under Longinus and Sabienus
to' Thessaly and iEtolia '.for forage, and
Domitius by the Via Egnatia, into Mace
donia, to head off Scipio, who, recalled
from Syria by Pompey â¢! on Caesar's .'first
landing in Epirus, ' was advancing west
from Thessalonica. 4i Engaging twice at
Dyrrachium, winning the first ana being
badly beaten in the second battle,
Ctcsar decided to move over into Thes
saly and there concentrating all his forces
hazard battle again. Getting a good start
before Pompey was aware of his move he
gained ApDollonia, and after a short stay
there started June 1 for Thessaly. March
ing up the Aous (Vovousa) River, north
of the present city of Janina, he crossed
the main chain of the Pindus Mountains
by way of the present town of Metzovo
and Zygos Pass, and striking tbe head
waters of the Peneus by the same route,
by which the insurgents recently invaded
Macedonia, followed that stream down to
Eginium at the bead of tbe Thessalian
Plain, near the present town of Kalabak,
the terminus of the railroad from Volo
and Trikkala. Reaching there June 7, he
was joined a week later by Domltius, who,
after some passages nt arms with Scipio
on the Haliacmon (Kara-su) and a nar
row escape from Pompey, had come over
the Khas-ia Mountains by Velemisti and
Meteora. Starting from Eginium on June
15, leaving Tricca (Trikkala) to his left, be
advanced leisurely across the broad and
fertile plains, recruiting his ranks and,
strengthening the physique and morale cf
his men, by the rich cities of Gam phi
(Gilunthi) which he captured by assault,
Metropolis (Karditza) and Pyrgos, which
successively submitted, to the Eastern end
of the Thessalian. Plain, and went into
camp on the left bank of the Enipeus
River just north of Pnarsalia to rest his
troops and await Pom pey, who was ap
proaching Lirissa. Having beaten Cai3ar
at Durrachium Pompey could have
crossed back over to Italy and regained it
to his side. He decided, however, to join
Scipio, follow Cassar and destroy his army
before he could rehabilitate it in strength
and tone. After pursuing directly for
four days, he turned from Asparagium up
the Apsus (Skumbia) River, and striking
the Via Egnatia, proceeded on to Heraclea
(Mouastir), where, learning that Scipio
had gone south toward Thessaly, he also
turned in the same direction, and pro
ceeding by way of Servia and Eiassona,
joined bis lieutenant at Larissa June 21,
where the latter had been for a week.
Resting his men a lew days, he pro
ceeded to find Caesar, having been led to
believe that victory would be certain for
him. He was abundantly justified in this
belief, as be had nearly it not quite two to
one both of legionaries and auxiliaries,
and 7000 horse to Caesar's 1000. Marching
south from Larissa across the plateau,
he approached Pharsalia from the
east and pitched bis camp on the
foothills of Karadja Ahmet, near the
south bank of the river Enipeus, five miles
from Caesar's,- a very strong position,
which he proceeded to further strengthen
with castellan or small stone forts on his
left and rear. He hoped to induce Cae-ar
to attack him here on the 'slope with the
river on one flank and the hills on the
other. Caesar had no such intention. He
wanted to brine Pompey to battle, but not
on his own chosen ground. Day after day
he led out his men and set them in array,
advancing each time nearer to the foot of
the slope, - where Pompey persistently
stayed. Finally, when about to despair of
getting battle on even ground his oppor
tunity came. ) .
Pompey's friends demanded a battle
and under tbis pressure, on the morning
of June 29, he came down from the slope
and took position oh the plain about half
way between the two camps. }>iv*j
His legions were drawn ,up in three
lines, the right resting on the bank of the
river, which was very steep and protected
by. 600 cavalry from Pontus, while his left
touched the rising ground on the other
side of the narrow plain. On the elope it
self, was posted the main body of his
horse. According, to Caesar there , were
BATTLEFIELD OF PHARSALIA.
45,000 men in the three lines and ten deep.
The cavalry, light troops and auxiliaries
added fully one-half to this number.
Porap-y himself took his post with his
left wing.
The lines extended across the bed of the
Phetsaiilis River, which at this season of
the year was dry.
C*_3ar's whole force numbered 30,000
men, 22,000 of whom were legionaries.
Leaving two legions to guard the camp, he
drew up the rest in three lines, covering
the whole of Pompey's front, and placed
his small body of horse on his right facing
Pompey's.
He took his own post with the Tenth
Legion, just opposite his rivaL These
arrays were 300 feet apart and near the
present railroad station, northeast of the
present town of Pharsala.
After viewing the disposition of the
troops Caesar saw that his chief danger
lay from Pompey's cavalry on his own
right, which so far outnumbered his own,
and hastily withdrawing from each legion
a choice cohort, he made up a fourth line,
which he placed behind his horse and
told them of bis purpose ingoing so. ; On
this move and Aha f manner of attack the
fate of the .battle finally turned. Pom
pey's men were confident of success, while
Caesar's were determined to win or die.
It was usual to join battle by both sides
advancing toward each other. Pompey
made the mistake of Keeping his men still
inline. Caesar well knew the advantage,
both moral and physical, of striking a sta
tionary foe with the impetus of a charge,
and ordered . a rapid advance. At the
word his men rushed forward with eager
ness, paused midway for a moment to
catch breath and then advanced again.
Casting their javelins they drew their
swords and rushed on the enemy, who
met them sturdily and bravely. At the
moment of this meeting of the legion ar
rays, Pompey's cavalry, followed by the
archers and slingers, had been hurled
against Caesar's small body of horse.
Weight told, and the latter were forced
back and finally broke.
Pompey's. men, believing that victory
was in their grasp, began to' move off in
small bodies to get in the rear of Caesar's
line. Here Caesar's foresight saved him
the day. At . his command that fourth
line, made up at . the last moment, ad
vanced to meet the enemy's horse. These
soon broke and fled ; then, cutting to pieces
the body of slingers and archers, the line
wheeled against Jhe left and rear of Pom
pey's main line while they were locked in
contest with those in their front.
The end was at band. Caesar flung his
third or reserve line forward, the others
making way for them, and with one charge
Pompey's line was destroyed. Caesar lost
200 men, while 15,000 of Pompey's soldiers
were left dead on the field. Pompey fled
to his camp, as did most of his men.
Caesar followed up at once and soon cap
tured it., Pompey mounted his horse and
fled with a small escort to Larissa, and
thence by the Vale of Tompe up the coast
to Thissalonika. ' Pharsalia was won and
the world was Caesar's.

by Garcia, Will Be Sent
Back to Spain.
HAVANA, Cuba, May 2.â General Wey
ler left to-night to assume charge of mili
tary operations in Santa Clara province.
General Adolol Castillo, a prominent
Cuban leader of Havana province, makes
the following signed statement:
â¢"The mendacity of Weyler's report
about tho pacification of Havana and
Pinar del Rio provinces is evident, be
cause since March the revolution in these
provinces has been stronger than ever. I
can certify to the operations of the
forces under my immediate command.
March 4 I took by force the
important town of Guines in Havana
province. I remained there with many
troops six hour and paraded through the
streets. May 8 I took also by force of
arms the . town of Bejucal in the same
province. As in Guines I retired only
after my soldiers had provided themselves
with all kinds of goods and all the ammu
nition in the town. In both places 1
severely punished our enemies and spies
in the service of Spain.
"On March 12 I captured a valuable
Spanish convoy.' Six big carts loaded
with ammunition fell into our hands.
March 2-8 my cavalry fought the Spanish
cavalry near Guines. The Spanish regi
ments of Pizzaro and Vill a osa, 1000
men each, were routed by my 700 cavalry
men.
"At the first shock twenty-two Spaniards
were killed and seven made prisoners.
Our losses were six killed and fifteen
wounded. Then the Spaniards fled in
disorder, and pursuing them we killed
some thirty more.
'â¢On April 1, obeying orders from Gen
eral Rodriguez, I passed over to Pinar del
Rio province. At El Brei jo we had a
a terrible encounter with a Span
ish column. I was told in the column
was our captured leader, General Rivera.
I ordered the charge with machetes in
order to come to hand to hand fighting.
General Rivera was not there, but the
result of the action was the Spanish lost a
lieutenant-colonel, a major, leader of the
vanguard, and a captain, besides some
hundreds of soldiers.
"On April 3, near Mariel, |I narrowly
escaped b-ing captured. With a small
detachment of my forces I was reconnoi
tering the outposts of that town, when I
fell into ambush. A Spanish soldier col
lared me, but I had time to stab him with

followed by more than fifty Spaniards.
But my men came to the rescue, and the
Spanish fled. I returned and put fire to
one of their forts from which the force in
ambush had come. The garrison, after a
short resistance, abandoned the fort, leav
ing fifty dead.
"Since that day until this time, April
25, I have been in Havana province again
and my troops are constantly fighting.
Fights occur daily also between the Span
ish forces and Cubans under General
Rodriguez and Colonels Nester Aranguren
and Raoul Aranjro. But notwithstanding
all that has occurred in March and April,
Weyler declares that Havana is pacified.
We are still in the field to prove he lies."
Near gaDCti Bpiritas the column of Gen
eral Aldave had an engagement yesterday
with insurgents under General Francisco
Carriilo. The fight lasted five hours and
the Spaniards retreated.
The exact number of losses is not
known, but it is said Aldave's column
had more than eighty killed.
General Nicolas Del Rey, who was re
called from Santiago de Cuba province by
Weyler on account of General Garcia's
victory over him at Guamo, arrived yes
terday. Rey replied in strong terms to
Weyler, sending him a tart communica
tion before leaving Santiago de Cuba.
General Key will probably return to Spain
"on account of his health."
It is generally believed that even the
sham reforms granted by Spain will be
modified before Weyler attempts to en-
force them.
DR. ZERIVCHA'S ARREST.
General Weyler Orders the Insurgent
to De Deported.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 2.â The Jour
nal's copyrighted special from Havana
says: Dr. Zertucha was arrested in his
home near Guines yesterday ana brought
to Havana under close guard. He is now
in the military prison in the fortress of
La Cabanas, opposite the city. It is un
derstood at the palace that Weyler this
morning ordered his deportment to Chaf
arinas Island, a Spanish penal station off
the African coast.
- Dr. Zertucha was formerly chief surgeon
of the insurgent forces in Pinar del Rio
and the personal physician of General Ma
ceo until the Matter's death at Punta
Brava. He surrendered to the Spanish
after Maceo was killed. The Cubans de
clared he betrayed Maceo into the Span

posed deportation have created wide

TREASURER BART LEY'S THEFTS.
Nebraska Will Sue the Omaha National
Bank to Recover the Sum of
$201,884 05.
OMAHA, Nebr., May 2.â The State will
sue the Omaha National Bank for $201,
--83-105, this being the amount of money
paid defaulting State Treasurer J. S. Bart
ley on the now celebrated sinking fund
warrant. The papers in the case are
being prepared by Attorney - General
Smyth and will be filed as soon as they
can be completed. The filing of this suit
will mark the culmination of one of the
most sensational features in the exposure
of the defalcations in the State Treasurer's
office while it was administered by J. S.
Bartley.
Up to March 20 of the present year it
was popularly supposed that Bartley's
trouble was due entirely to the weakened
condition of the Nebraska banks with
which he had deposited public funds.
Bartley evaded a prompt settlement with
his successor on the plea that if he drew
his funds from the banks in which they
were deposited the banks would be forced
to suspend, and thus hundreds of private
business men in all parts of Nebraska
would be forced to the wall and a wide
spread panic precipi ated upon the State.
Then the truth became public. He was
short $.500,000. Nearly one-half of this
was in a warrant sold to the Chemical Na
tional Bank of New York through the
Omaha National Bank. Attorney-General
Smyth contends, on the part of the State,
that the warrant was illegally drawn, that
it bore an illegal rate of interest and that
the Omaha National Bank had no right
to pay it out of the funds belonging to the
State, although a check for the amount
bearing Bartley's signature was duly pre
sented. Hence suit is to be brought to

.After a Seven Years' Fight Mary Lydia
Leggett Will Enter the Divinity
School.
BOSTON. Mass., May 2.â After a seven
years' fight Harvard University has given
way to a woman, a Western preacher, and
has just decided to admit her to the di
vinity school.
Mary Lydia Leggett of Topeka, Kan.,
has the distinction of being the first
.woman to take the divinity course at
Harvard. As a Unitarian minister she is
well known in many parts of the West.
Sue was assistant pastor at Topeka and
built a church at Beatrice. Her present
charge is the Congregational Unitarian
at Dighton, Mass., about an hour from
Boston.
By making weekly trips from Cambridge
to her parish she will fulfill the pastorate
duties in the pulpit and otherwise while
pursuing her studies. It has been a long,
brave tight for her rights which is now re
warded by her admission which has just
ben attained by a special vote of the fac
ulty, and was a big surprise. She is still
debarred from homiletics. however.
In response to the question whether she
is finally admitted to all the instruction
desired, Miss Leggett answered in the
negative. She takes her half loaf grate
fully, and aided as far as possible by Dean
Everett scrambles about in the bashes
seeking the homiietics.

ABOUT TO REPORT
THE TARIFF BILL
Senate Sub-Committee
Ready to Submit
Its Work.
The Democrats to Be Given
Time to Consider the
Measure.
Jones of Nevada Holds the Key to
the Situation and Ie With
the Republicans.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 2.âSena
tor Jones of Nevada, the Populist mem
ber of the Committee onJFinance.has been
in consultation all day with old-time Re
publican associates who are members of
tho sub-committee engaged in revising
the Dingley tariff bill. The sub-committee
was in session at a late hour to-night, and
apparently nothing now stands in the
way of their intention to report the bill
to the full committee next Tuesday.
The revised bill has been printed and
could be reported to-morrow, but as Piatt
of Connecticut, a member of the sub
committee, will not return from his wed
ding trip until to-morrow night, action
will be postponed until his arrival.
Senator Jones is a Republican still, so
far as his tariff views are concerned, and
owing to the peculiar personnel of the
Finance Committee he holds the key to
the situation.
The sub-committee now feels assured
that the Democrats will not insist upon
delaying the bill in committee, even if
able to do so, and its programme provides
for reporting the bill to the Senate next
Thursday. The Republicans will accede
to the request of the Democrats for time
to consider the bill, and it will not be
called up for consideration in the Senate
for about a fortnight after it is placed on
the calendar.
The present intention of the Republi
cans is to move to take up the bill in the
Senate on Monday, May 17, and they are
hopeful that the Democrats will find the
intervening time sufficient lor considering
the measure.
There have been some important
changes in the various schedules during
the past few days, including a slight in
crease in some grades of wools and fruits,
and also some changes in the sugar sched
ule. As a whole the bill, when finally re
ported, will provide for a decided reduc
tion in rates as fixed in the measure
passed by the House.
FLOOD OF FOREIGN GOODS.
Enormous Increase in the Importation
of Free-List Article*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 2. â The
treasury figures for the month just ended
confirm Chairman Dingley's statement
made to The Call correspondent a few
days ago, that there is likely to be nearly
a year's supply of foreign goods in the
country when the new tariff goes into
effect.
While the retroactive clause, so called,
of the Dingley bill probably prevented
some of the new contracts which would
have been made and the new orders which
would have been given, it did not re
due? the amount of goods brought in
during April as compared with the pre
ceding month. That clause of the bill
provided that the new rates of duty
should apply to all goods coming in after
April 1 which had been purchased prior
to tbat date.
This, of course, permitted all goods con
tracted for or ordered prior to April 1 to
come in under Wilson-law rates, and also
left it largely in the hands of the import
ers to indicate by their own statements
whether goods coming in after April 1
bad been purchased or ordered prior to
that date.
Some of the importers have also clung
to the belief that this feature of the bill
would fail to pass the Senate, especially in
view of recent publications so indicating,
while still others have chosen to take the
risKs upon being required to pay the extra
duty in case this feature of the bill should
become a law.
The result of these conditions is that
the April importations have been phe
nomenally large âas large, indeed, as
those of the month preceding, and larger
than those of any other month since the
Wilson law began to pour forth its flood
of foreign goods into the country. The
importations of foreign goods during the
month of April will foot up a total of
probably $80,000,000 in value.
The following figures indicate the hot
haste with which foreign manufacturers
and home importers have filled tbe ware
houses of the United States: The total
importations in August, 1596, amounted
to less than $50,000,000. In December
they amounted to $59,000,000, and in
April, just ended, $80,000,000.
While the increase has been especially
noticeable by reason of the increase in
customs receipts the growth has been
even greater than is shown because of the
fact that importers have naturally in
creased their orders for goods now on the
free list which they had reason to believe
will be placed upon the dutiable list under
the now law.
There has been an enormous increase in
the importation of articles upon the free
list The importation of non-dutiable ar
ticles in August, 1896, amounted to $20,
--000,000, ano in April last $45,000,000.
That the election ofa Republican Presi
dent and Congress proved a signal for in
stant activity on the part of the import
ers and for immediate preparations for
flooding the country with foreign goods
before the new law could go into effect is
shown not alone by the above figures, but
by the increase in customs receipts.
The growth in these since the month in
which President McKinley was elected has
been remarkable. In November, 1896, the
customs receipts were $10,000,000, and in
April, just ended, they amounted to $23.
--000,000, or an increase of more than 100
per cent. '
WARRIORS CRY FOR QUARTER.
Reg to Be Relieved From Ihe Duty of
Ciurt-Slartlaling Women.
ATLANTA, Ga., May The army
officers constituting the military court
which has been trying Captain Romeyn
at Fort McPherson will be sunt home as
soon as their duties connected with that
inquiry are over. They will not be re
quired to participate in the general inves
tigation of affairs at the barracks that the
War Department contemplates. The
members of the court urgently begged the
War Department to relieve them from
their present unpleasant duties, pleading
that the charges and counter-charces

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 3, 1897.
McPherson were not such as should be
tried before a jury of military men. They
say they don't believe it to be their duty
to court-martial women, which they have
virtually been doing in the Roracyn-
O'Brien-Bamford case. They assert that
the condition of affairs at the garrison
cannot be remedied by military inquiry.
In view of their departure tho future of
the charges preferred against O'Brien,
Bamford and others is problematical.
AMERICA HAS A GORILLA.
Ths First One Ever Brought to This
Country io Be Placed in tho
Eos on Zoo.
BOSTON, Mass., May 2 âThere arrived
here to-day from England, aboard the
Cunarder Pavonia, the first gorilla ever
brought alive to the New World. Skeptics
may smile at this, so to prove the accuracy
of the statement a few words by W. T.
Hornaday of New York, the highest
zoological authority in America, may be
quoted. Writing to Mr. Edwards, the
brother of the man who brought the ani
mal over, Mr. Hornaday says: "Thus far,
during all its sixty-seven years of exist
ence, the London Zoo has had just two
gorrillas, one in 1887 and one in 1896.
There has never been one landed alive on
this side."
The animal was placed in the Boston
Zoo. The gorilla is a youngling. He is
not very tali, perhaps two feet when he
stands up, but, he is almost as broad as he
is high, that is bis forteâ breadth. His
bands are small and well made; hi 3 legs
are short and all muscles. Unlike the
baboon, he has no tail; he is enveloped in
a well-fitting coat of soft black fur.
It is a remarkable head, the most human
easily, judged by the shape, ever shown
by a wild animal. Its contour is strikingly
childlike. The brow is low and broad and
deeply wrinkled. The mouth and chin
are well formed. The eyes are large, soft,
brilliant and black. He is stunted, pudgy,
black-skinned, shaggy â the double of a
veritable Georgian backwoods pickaninny.
TURFMEN AT THE SHORT END.
The American Trotting Association Grieves
Over Spalding's Infatuation for
His Typewriter.
CHICAGO, 111., M iy 2.â The American
Trotting Association is among the public
institutions of the West which have cause
to mourn over the infatuation of Spald
ing, the defaulting banker, for his type
writer, Sarah Ervin. Spalding was treas
urer of the Western League of Track Man
agers, and is reported to have had the
custody of $25,000 or $30,000 belonging to
the association at the time of the collapse
of the Globe Savings Bank. Action has
been begun against the bondsmen of
Spalding to recover $31,000, but it is feared
little if anything will be recovered.
Spalding is not a horseman and is not
identified with the American Trotting As
sociation except as custodian of its funds.
It is said that his election as treasurer was
due to the fact that he was president of
the bank at which the association had
been in the habit of doing business.
Edward Hayes, who owned a half in
terest in Alix (2:035.0. queen of the trot
ting turf, was formerly vice-president of
the Globe bank, while his partner, Morris
J. Jones, was a director o! the American
Trotting Association. Hayes thus be
came treasurer of the trotting association,
but left the bank and resigned the treas
urership two or three years ago. When
he did so Spalding, president of the bank,
was chosen to succeed him. A large part
of the lost funds is said to be accumulated
profits. It is not believed that the asso
ciation will be embarrassed on account of
this financial complication.
A DIFFEREST STORY.
What the World Correspondent Says of
the Situation.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 3.â The World
prints a Washington dispatch differing
radically from all other reports. The cor
respondent says that the sub-committee,
alter an all-Sunday session, has concluded
that the tariff schedules it had in mind,
which were lower than those of the Ding
ley or McKinley bills, will not produce
sufficient revenue during the first year or
eighteen months to pay the expenses of
the Government.
The correspondent continues: "As Sen
ators Aldrich, Allison and Piatt are
strongly opposed to prohibitive rates they
have been forced to consider new sources
of revenue. It will, therefore, amaze the
whole country to-morrow when it learns
that these distinguished Republican pro
tectionists are considering a tax on those
articles of universal consumption which
all free-traders consider the surest sources
of revenue tea and coffeeâ together with
an increased tax on tobacco and beer."
The correspondent then, without giving
any authority for his statements, declares
that the committee intends to raise $30,
--000.000 additional revenue on beer, while
the tax on tea and coffee is expected to
raise $30,000,000 more. "The sub-commit
tee," the article continues, "has also con
sidered an increase of tobacco taxes,
equivalent to $14,000,000, making $74,000,
--000 in all."
EVERY BOER WILL BATTLE.
Views of the Postmaster- General of the
South African Republic.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 2.âPostmas
ter-General Van Alphen of the South Af
rican republic is here to attend the inter
national postal congress. He said to-day
the Boers would go to every extreme to
avoid war with England, but if attacked
would fight hard. He said the Uitlanders
had nothing to complain of.
On the contrary, the extravagances and
vices they had introduced in the country
had justly offended the Boers, whose
youths are being corrupted by foreigners
of dissipated habits. The Uitlanders' out
cry about a lack of suffrage be denied as
hypocritical, because they repeatedly re
fused to secure it by forswearing alle
giance to other countries. They wanted
the Transvaal mines only. He said the
whole Transvaal's population of 80,000
would rise to defend the country if neces
sary.

WENT OUT IN A
BLAZE OF GLORY
Brilliant Close of the
Fourth Woman's
Congress.
Professor Jordan Cleverly Tells
a Few Truths About
"Misery."
Miss Eliza Keith Weaves Personal
Experiences Into a Striking
Paper.
The fourth annual meeting of the
Woman's Congress is a thing of the past.
The closing session was held las t evening
and was a fitting end in point of bril
liancy. intellect and attendance for the
great truths promulgated and the success
it achieved.
All the great and shining lights that
had contributed to the success of the con
gressâwith, of course, the exception of
the white-eowned and turbaned Hindoo
youthâ were assembled on the stage,
seated on either side of their dignified
president, Mrs. John F. Swift.
Miss Ray Frank was the first speaker of
the evening. She began her able address
by neatly complimenting the ladies for
the good work they had accomplished and
for the many practical things made pos- j
sible by the discussion of the excellent j
paners read.
Miss Frank's paper was a strong plea
that filial love and devotion bei not swal
lowed up in these times of too much
education.
Among other things, Miss Frank said:
Two theories are held regarding the moral
nature of man. One is that morality Is of di
vine birth ; the other that our ancestors found
it ezpedient in the best, to retain certain
characteristics because they had found them
to b3 the best. In all the discussion during
this convention each one has dwelt upon the
Importance of this element that makes and
unmakes usâ the mora! element. In exempli
fication there is that od and trite sayimr. a
nation is no greater than its morality. The
average man gives the average strength of the
nation. If this be so it certainly behooves us
to learn what is the average strength of this
great American Nation.
If knowledge made ono wise we would not
be in need of reformers. Only one thing
counts, and that is the moral thoughtâ the
moral thought that gives birth to obedience
and reverence to the law.
Miss Keith followed Miss Frank, sum
ming up in a brilliant paper her knowl
edge of children as gleaned from many
years' experience in the public schools.
Miss Keith looks upon our public schools
as the nursery of this great American
Nation.
Among other things Miss Keith said:
The child who says, "I won't; you can't make
me," is already an anarchist and a menace to
law and order. Who says "please" to a refrac
tory pupil? Incorrigible pupils should be
weeded out, even If the school's enrollment
and the principal's salary shrink at the same
time.
Mothers should talk with their sons as well
as with their dauehters. The moral education
â should begin in the nursery. Save your boys.
It is a dangerous doctrine that says the boy
can go to the devil and return and be wel
comed back into the fold.
Miss Keith closed her paper with a
glowing description of the' patriotism of
the * Ã¼blic school children.
Mme. Montford filled in the brief recess
between Miss Keith's paper and Professor
Jordan's address with many anecdotes of
her life in the far-off Orient. At the same
time she took exception to a suggestion
from Miss Keith that the sexes in the
schools be separated, contending that this
separation of the sexes was the ruin of
tbe Orient.
Professor Jordan's brilliant paper, a few
truths about "Misery," brought the ses
sion to a close. Among other things Pro
fessor Jordan said:
I am going to talk for a little while about
miseryâ nature's protest against nature's de
generation. Misery is pain so constant and
steady tbat it is always present ...->'.-â 
Let us separate misery from borrow. Sorrow
relates to some one else; misery is all to your
self. Sorrow is sacred. Misery is at once a
symptom, a cause and effect of nature's de
generation.
Nearly ail the causes of misery come from
mistake in the pursuit of happiness. Happi
ness comes in tno first place tn the exercise of
the functions; the following out ol impulses.
Happiness may be looked upon as nature's
bribe to do the thing we have to do.
Genuine pleasure gives strength. But any
form of unearned happiness is sure to bring in
its train unbounded misery and depression. If
one would live as he ought to live he would
never have any blue days, but he wquld have
the pleasures of living.
During the evening Mrs. Lovell White
read the following resolutions which were
unanimously adopted:
The Woman's Congress desires to express its
appreciation of the co-operation of all who
have contributed to the success of its fourth
annual meeting. It is therefore

FEATHERED THEIR NESTS.
Hew Two Thieving War Department Offi-
cials Under Cleveland Were Caught
by Lamont.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 2 âDuring
the last few months of Cleveland's ad
ministration Joseph B. Doe, Assistant
Secretary of War, held a sinecure, and
people are just beginning to find out the
reason.
He was deprived of all authority, not
allowed to issue any orders or sign any
but routine mail, and dii not perform any
other function of his cffice^ He was not
even permitted to issue requisitions. La
mont assumed all the labor and responsi
bility that had formerly been done by the
assistant except such as could ba in
trusted to bis chief clerk.
The extraordinary circumstances were
known by the employes, but the reasons
were not understood. There was also
considerable comment concerning the un
usual act of President McKinley in accept
ing Doe's resignation before the selection
of his successor.
It is customary for assistant secretaries
to hold over until new members of the
cabinet have familiarized themselves
with the duties of their offices, and in all
departments except the war and navy
some of the Cleveland officials are still re
tained. But Doe's resignation was ac
cepted at once. This was due to a hint
from Lamont. â â "'.
As early as he was able to find time Sec
retary Alger began an investigation of the
official conduct of Doe, but Boon discov
ered that Lamont had anticipated him,
and the only result of his inquiries was
the dismissal of Richard J. Whitton, who
was brought to Washington by Doe and
served as his private secretary for two
years.
Whitton was then transferred to the
supply division, and as soon as h*-** had
familiarized himself with the duties of
the office he was promoted to be chief of
the division in place of Captain Thorpe,
an old soldier wbo had held office for a
quarter of a century. There were no
charges against Thorpe and no complaint
of bis official conduct. "
He was simply forced out by Doe to
make a place for Whitton with the ul
terior object soon to be disclosed. Whit
ton's duties were to buy the supplies of
the department and disburse the appro
priations, except the payroll.
Shortly after he came in Whitton en
deavored to secure the dismissal of David
Cranmer, another old soldier, who had
been storekeeper for the department for
many years, and had the custody of the
supplies; but the conspiracy was de
feated by Colonel Ainsworth, chief of the
war records division.
About & year ago Doe began to issue
orders to the division of supply and other
branches of the department that caused
considerable gossip among the clerks and
to make requisitions for articles for per
sonal use which had not before been pur*
chased from the public funds.
He continued to do so during the fre
quent absence of Lamont until after the
election in November, when that sort of
business became so active as to attract
general attention, and within a few weeks
this gossip reached the ears of the head of
tbe department. 'JJJJ'.'
Lamont at once called before him the
clerks in the supply division, the store
keeper and other officials, and secured
statements which caused him to require
Doe and Whitton to make restitution to
the amount of nearly $1000 in cash and to
surrender to the department a consider
able amount ***/ property which in La
mont' opinion belonged to the Govern
ment.
It was disclosed, for example, that in
the absence of the Secretary of War Doe
had ordered two bicycles, one for himself
and one for Whitton, wnich were returned
to tbe department and are now stored in
the basement.
The ofliciai photographer of the depart
ment testified that he had made two sets
of prints, about 1000 in number, from
negatives purchased by Congress some
years ago from Brady, the cele
brated war photographer, and George K.
Jenvy, in charge of the "department
bindery, testified that he had mount*
these prints and bound thorn in hand
some Russia leather albums at the ex
pense of the Governmet A. K. Johnson,
the department carpenter, testified that
he had been employed several weeks
under orders of Doe in making packing
for furniture and other articles which
were shipped "deadhead" to Janesville,
Wis., Doe's home.
: Lamont himself accidentally discovered
one day in the carpenter's room' a large
chest, sealed and addressed to Doe.; When
opened by his orders it was found to con
tain a large quantity of fine stationery,
sufficient to last Doe the rest 'of his life,
which had been packed by the storekeeper
on Wanton's requisition. , *â  , â¢ -

Most Disastrous Confla

Years.
In Two Hours $2,500,000
Worth of Property Is
Consumed.
Flames Galnlnsr on the Firemen
and Threatening a Section of
the City.
PITTbBURG. Pa., May 3-2 a. M.â
biggest fire Pittsburg has had f ;r many
years started just before midnight, and in
two nours $2,500,000 worth of property
was destroyed. It is reported that one
fireman has been killed by falling walls.
The largest losses were suffered Dy T. C.
Jenkins*, wholesale grocer, whose building
valued at $100,000, and stock, $400,000. were
consumed; Joseph Horn & Co.'s retail
dry goods house, the finest in the city,
valued at $600,000, and the office building,
worth $1,500,000, belonging to the firm,
were also destroyed.
Tbe Methodist book concern building is
burned to the ground. At 1:50 A.M. tbe
Honkins-Duquesne Theater caught fire
and is doomed.
Tbe fire was first seen by the watchman.
It started among some waste paper on the
ground floor. The watchman first tried to
extinguish the blaze with buckets of
water and a man iv a building across
Cecil alley ge.ve the alarm. Bofore ail the
engines had reached the scene the fire had
spread until the square bounded by Fifth
avenue, Liberty street, Perm avenue and
Sixth avenue was ablaze.
The fire steadily gained on the firemen
and at this hour threatens to sweep that
entire part of the city.
Horn's big drygoods bouse, the Du
quesne theater, several large office build
ings and a number of retail shops and
wholesale stores are in the immediate
neighborhood. The Hotel Anderson, one
of the chief hotels in the city, occupies
the corner of Perm and Ffth avenues.
It is crowed with guests, but none of
them is in any danger, as they will have
sufficient time .to escape. Two other
hotels are in adjoining blocks. v _

"When my son was 7 years old he began
to complain of soreness on both sides of
his neck, and soon lumps began to gather
on one side and grew to hall the size of an
egg. We then became more uneasy and
began to doctor him for scrofula. He
gradually grew worse, however, until at
the age of 12 years we had lost all hope of
his recovery. He became so weak he
could sit up but a few minutes at a time.
My w'fa saw Hood's Sarsaparilla recom-
mended as a great blood purifier and we
sent and got a bottle. We began giving
our boy the medicine according to direc-
tions and it was not long before we saw he
was improving. He continued taking it
until he was in very good health. He is
now 13 years old and ls well. We recom-
mend Hood's Sarsaparilla for all troubles
caused by impure blood." 8. M. Silver,

HIS OWN DOCTOR
You will meet a man every
now and again who is his
own doctor. He will buy
shoes from shoemakers, meat
from butchers and soap from
chandlers, but he must be
his . own doctor. He tinkers
with himself, uses every
kind of tea or herb he can ,
find. This being yourown
doctor is all very good forthe
motherly woman of a big
family, whose experience,
actual contactâ is great
but the ordinary man can no
more be his own doctor than
can a goat read Latin, or a
mule study Greek. A man
who finds he is suffering .
from a nervous disorder or
who discovers that he Is suf-
fering from
FAILING MANHOOD
Should go about seeking
relief the same as he would
any other requisite he may
require. He should go to the
place that shows the greatest

its ability. If you will call
to the doctors of Hudson
Medical Institute you can
read for yourself files and
files and files of testimonials
from living men; from men
who have been cured of se-
cret disorders, of lost man-
hood and like diseases. The
doctors always use Hudyan
remedy- treatment as a basis
or as a foundation for the
cure, and never guarantee
anything of which they are
not absolutely sure of keep-

able treatment in cases where
dissipation or abuse has

James Brooks' Careful
Plot to Slay the
Quails.
The Sanger Suicide Had Kept
'-â  *." a Loaded Gun Ready
. ; -' for Use.
Falling to Entice Miss Quails to
Her Death He Adopted a
*"' Bolder Course.
FRESNO, Cal., May 2.â Mrs. David
â¢ Quails, who was shot in the arm by
James Brooks in her home north of Sanger
â¢ last Tuesday night in the fiendish attempt
of the love-crazed man to murder her
and her daughter, continues to improve;
but she cannot drive from her mind the
terrible experience of that night and is
.till. very nervous.
â¢ â¢ Miss Quails displays much more nerve
and does not worry much. She is a
plucky girl and takes a more philosophi
â  cal view of the matter than does her
.- mother.
"-When Quails, the girl's father, inter
.".â  icecled in Brooks' behalf, some time ago,
- .and had him released from jail, where he
had been confined because of his in
_ ability to give a bond that he would
.' hot molest the Quails, as he had
threatened to do, the father was advised
by Constable J. S. Irvine of Sanger not to
-do so. The constable told him that
. Brocks was the kind of man who might
carry out the dire threat ho had made to
destroy the family. Quails did not like
the idea of keeping the fellow in jail in
' .definitely, and upon Brooks' promise not
â¢ to come around the piace procured his re
.â¢ lease.
- . ~ Brooks had evidently planned for some
time to carry out his intention of aveng
... ing his rejection by Miss Quails. A few
"weeks ago he borrowed the shotgun from
..' the foreman of the ranch on which he was
working to shoot a dog, he said. He made
particular inquiry as to the number of the
snot in the shells. He shot no dogs, but
kept the hrearm in his room.
After Brooks had been at the Quails
place the evening before his desperate
deed, when the young lady refused .to ko
riding with him he drove home and un
. â¢ hitched his horse. He then procured the
gun and lantern and walked back to the
â¢ Quails' place. He took advantage of the
ausence of the foreman, and was alone at
the ranch.
It is now believed that the fellow's pur
" pose in wishing to have the girl go riding
with him in the evening was to take her
to the ranch on which he .vas employed
and there murder her. When he was
coaxing her to accept his invitation he
' made the peculiar remark that the man
I .with whom he was worKing was away.
Failing in this plan he was determined
that his resolve to end her life and his
own should not be thwarted, and he re
sorted to the bolder proceed*

A Story of Hardship and Fatigue
Told to Manager Cowley on
tha Mountain.
MILL VALLEY, Ca*l., May 2.â A party
of three, two ladies and a eentleman, ap
plied for admission at about 3 o'clock Fri
day morning at the Tavern of Tamalpais
on the summit of the mountain. They
did not leave their names, but they pre
sented a sorry spectacle to Fred Cowley,
the manager of the hotel, who got out of
bed to answer their summons.
They said that they had come from San
Francisco and left Mill Valley in the
afternoon to walk to the top of Tamalpais,
but when they had covered half the dis
tance the fog rolled in from the ocean and
losing their way they had been wandering
about in the chaparral in an effort to
reach some habitation where tbey could
obtain a bite to eat, as they were almost
famished. The ladies were well-nigh ex
hausted, and the gentleman, wbom Mr.
Cowley describes as short and heavy-set,
with black whiskers, was well worn out.
They told of the nours they had spent
picking their way through the brushes in
the pitchy darkness with the cold, pene
trating log soaking their clothes. Their
bedraggled appearance bore out their
statements, and after they had partaken of
refreshments they were assigned rooms
and spent the remainder of the morning
in the hotel. The formality of registering
their names was not complied with.
After breakfast they resolved to attempt
to walk down the mountain rather than
wait for the afternoon train.
They walked down the trails and after a
couple of hours' tramping came upon the
track of the mountain road, having again
lost their way. They met a San Francisco
attorney, J. M. Wright, who was walking
along the track, and inquired of him
where they were. He informed them
that they were within 100 yards of the
hotel on the summit. Their surprise
knew no bound, for they had after two
hours' tramping brought up within a few
hundred feet of the spot from which they
had started. They returned to the hotel
resolving to trust no further experiences
and left for the metropolis on the after
noon train.
They were pretty well fagged out and
the rough experience had told hard on
theUadies. __________^___

Wind Storm at Pacific Orore.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 2.-A
windstorm has prevailed here for the past
two days. It reached its greatest severity
about 5 o'clock yesterday evening, and is
said to have been the worst that has
swept this vicinity in two years. Nogreat
damage was done to property except in
the matter of fences being blown over and
ornamental trees being broken and in
some cases the smaller ones being up
rooted, but the waves along the bay shore
were lashed to such fury that considerable
havoc was wrought about the bathing
beach, where extensive improvements
have lately been made. At the hi<*-h tide
of yesterday the breakers ran so high that
the Southern Pacific Company's track
was badly washed, and in several places
the rocks which form the buttress along
the water's edge were dislodged, necessitat
ing immediate repairs. Even in the shel
tered harbor of Monterey some of the fish
ing boats broke loose from their moorings
and were with difficulty recovered.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 3, 1897.
THE CITY OF PORTLAND.
By the Secretary of the Manufacturers' Association of the Northwest.
PORTLAND, Or., April 30.â The at
tractions which nature offers in "The Pa
cific Northwest" to the tourist, the health
seeker and the sportsman, in addition to
the healthful and invigorating climate,
are its scenery, its health and pleasure
resorts and its bunting and fishing.
It is but rarely that grand and im
pressive scenery is united in one section
of country with the productive soil and
wealth of natural resources, and, as a rule
the enjoyment of the wonders which na
ture has produced in her fiercest moods, is
limited to those who possess the means and
the leisure to travel considerable distances,
and spend much time, to see and enjoy
alone. But in "The Pacific Northwest" is
found, not only an equable and healthful
climate, and all that boundless wealth of
natural resources necessary for the great
est prosperity of a dense population, but
in the greatest profusion and everywhere
in easy reach, all the varieties of won
drous scenery which nature has yet pro
duced and which contributes so largely to
the enjoyment of those that are alive to
nature's beauties.
Here are the fertile, peaceful valleys,

The Hotel Portland jix.Boujers-mMAo*,
Manufacturing Plants and Business Blocks in the City of Portland*
wearing throughout the year their mantle
of green, and sleeping eternally in the
lap of spring. Here are the rugged
mountains, with their yawning chasms,
rnshing, roaring torrents, peaceful Alpine
lakes, and grand old sentinels, rearing
their lofty heads to the realm of eternal
winter, and bearing on their sides glaciers,
excelled by none in beauty or magnitude.
And here are rivers of all degrees, and of
all varieties.
Of rivers, the Columbia is without a
rival in the world in the grandeur of its
scenery, as it has but lew iv the volume
of its waters, or the amount of country
which it drains. Though other rivers
may here and there touch the borders of
mountains, winding to one side on their
way to the sea, or follow down their
slopes, from their sources at the summits
to the lower lands of the valleys, it alone
has broken through these stern barriers,
and crossed directly through two mighty
mountain chains, carving for itself a way
embattled by the lofty peaks which in
effectually resisted its onward march.
In its gorge in the Cascade Mountains
the Columbia River offers scenery so
grand, so majestic, so altogether different
from aught else of the kind that the world
affords, tbat it is the wonder of all who
behold it, and so real is its sublime gran
deur that the wondsr but grows with re
peated seeing. Here are the cliffs of the
Yosemite, only greater in extent; the val
ley of the Yosemite, only longer and
wider, and flowing through it all a river
more mighty than the Hudson, the Rhine
or the Mississippi.
Those who first see the Columbia in the
giandenrof its passage through the Cas
cade Mountains are apt to fail in appreci
ation of its other beauties. But between
these mountains and the sea it has a
beauty all its own. which is unsurpassed
by that of any other river in the world.
Of a varying width of from one and a half
to three miles to within twenty milÂ»Â»s of
the ocean, it there widens to what might
almost be called a bay of from six to ten
miles in width, and from its point of
junction with the Willamette, 100 miles
from the sea, it is of such volumeas to
float the largest of ocean-going ships. Its
scenery varies from the lowlands of the
Mississippi in the immediate foreground,
with the mountains of the Coast and Cas
cade ranges in the distance, to the Pali
sades and the rugged and precipitous
banks of the Hudson or the Rhine.
To tempt the hardy Alpine climber
there are the snow-clad peaks of the
Three Sisters. Jefferson, Hood, St. Helens,
Adams and Rainier, and here he may find
the glaciers, and all degree of danger from
slippery path, yawning chasm or fatal
crevasse that his heart may desire. From
thesa there are all grades down to the
more gentle elevations, which alone tempt
the less ambitious, who are content to do
their mountain climbing on the back of a
horse or mule, or seated in the comforta
ble stage coacb or mountain wagon. *
Niagara has long been regarded as the
most wondrous of cataracts, and ; far be it
from as to seek, by erer so little, to take
from the power and majesty of his might--'
plunge. He has but one equal, but tha 1
one is here in Snoshone Falls, Idaho. Na"
ture in the creation of her wonders does not
repeat herself. In the fertility of her
genins sne finds a charm for each of her
creations peculiar to itself, and any at
tempt at a comparison of Shoshone with
Niagara, save only in the pre-eminence of
its grandeur, would be absurd. The Niag
ara prior to its plunge winds its way
through a comparatively level country.
The Snake comes plunging from its moun
tain sources, with many a cascade and
cataract, forcing its way along its tortuous
course, between rocky walls, until at Sho
shone the walls which form its boundaries
and confine it to its bed rise straieht above
it on -dither hand to a height of hundreds
of feet, while all along these walls is a
velvety drapery of ferns and mosses, and
here, amid a shower of pearls and dia
monds, and ever-changing, vanishing and
reforming rainbows, the river takes its
final mighty plunge. The volume of
water is somewhat less, but the height is
a third greater than Niagara. But we
cannot do better than to give the eloquent
description of this falls from the pen of
.Richardson:
'"The cataract is unequaled in the world
save by Niagara, of wbich it vividly re
minds us. It is not all height like Yo-
Semite, no>*all breadth and power like the
great Falls of the Missouri, nor all strength
and volume like Niagara, but combines
the three elements.
"The torrent is less than Niagara, and
its crescent summit appears less than 1000
feet wide. But the descent 2lo â is
one-third greater, while above the brink,
solemn portals of lava rising for hundreds
of feet on each bank supply an element of
grandeur which the monarch of cataracts
altogether lacks. Tbe fall itsÂ«lf is of the
purest white, interspersed with myriads
of glittering, glassy drops â a cataract of
snow with an avalanche of jewels, mock
ing and belittling all human splendor.
Nature is here in her lace and pearls, her
robe of diamonds and tiara of rainbow."
Of falls of lesser magnitude, the num
ber is almost countless, and they vary in
height from Multnomah Falls, situate on
the south bank of the Columbia, within
the gorge of the Cascade Mountains, 850
feet. in height, to the ordinary cataracts
which are the wonders of less favored
lands. Crater Lake is situated in the
northwestern portion of Klamath County,
Oregon, and is best reached by leaving
the Southern Pacific Railroad at Medford,
which is 328 miles south of Portland, and
about eighty miles from the lake, which
can be reached by a very good wagon
road. The lake is about six miles wide
and seven miles long, but it is not its size
which is its beauty or its attraction. The
surface of the water in the lake is 6256 feet
above the level of the sea ana surrounded
by cliffs or walls from 1000 to 2000 feet in
height, which are scantily covered with
timber and offer at but one point a way
of reaching the water. The depth of the
water is very great and it Is very transpar
ent and of deep blue color. Toward the
southwestern portion of the lake is Wizard
Island, 845 feet high, circular in shape
and slightly covered with timber. In the
top of this island is a depression or crater,
the Witches' Cauldron, 100 feet deep and
475 feet in diameter, which was evidently
the last smoking chimney of a once
mighty volcano and which is now covered
within and without with volcanic rocks.
North of this island and on the west side
of the lake is Llao Rock, reaching to a
height of 2000 feet above the water and
so perpendicular that a stone may be
dropped from its summit to the waters at
its base, nearly a half mile belpw, '.*,**.
So far below the surrounding mountains
is the surface of the waters in this lake
that the mountain brc-zes rarely ripple
them, and looking from the surrounding
wall, the sky and cliffs are seen mirrored
in the glassy surface, and it is with diffi
culty the eye can distinguish the line
where the cliff leaves off and the reflected
counterfeits begin. Lake Tahoe, so long
the recognized monarch of mountain lakes
must hide its diminished bead before
one which has all its beauties, but is in
each a tuousand times greater.
Lumbering has been, is now and will
continue to be for years to come the lead
ing manufacturing industry of the Pacitic
} Northwestern States. The : supply of
standing timber is practically unlimited,
and the production of lumber and kindred
articles of commerce will increase in pro
portion to the demand, and the decrease
in the supply of merchantable timber in
tbe lake States and other States which
have lorn: held the bulk of the lumbering
business. Any discussion of the possibi
lities in the forestry line necessarily in
volves estimates as to the quantity of
timber available for the requirements of
commerce and suitable for the various uses
to which it is to be put.
The combination effected by the North
Pacific Lumber Company, the Willamette
Steam Mills and Manufacturing Company
and In man. Poulsen & Co. has done much
to advance the lumber interests of the
Northwest. These three concerns, repre
senting a capital of over $1,500,000, con
duct their business under the firm name
of the Oregon Pine Lumber Company,
with offices in the Chamber of Commerce
building. Tne yards and mills of this
triple organization cover an area of 120
acres, with over a mile of water front.
Their railroad trackage is sufficient to
allow of sixty cars being sidetracked on
the company's own switches at one time.
With -such facilities for manufacturing
and handling lumber the Oregon Pine
Lumber Company is in position to do an
immense annual business, which wiil
grow as the requirements of the Pacific
Coast trade advance.
The great plant of the Wolff & Z wicker
Iron Works, located on tne Willamette

relation to Portland and the Northwest
that the Union Iron Works does to San

prises, which naturally seek a concern
whose capacity is equal to all demands
which may be made upon it, both as to
material and workmanship, with due re
gard also to rapidity of construction. These
qualifications are nre-eminently possessed
by the Wolff & Z wicker Iron Works, a fact
which has now become so generally recog
nized and admitted that large contracts
In metal work naturally gravitate to this
concern. The proud position attained by
Wolff & Zwicker, which has finally led to
the allotment to them of a contract by the
United States Government for the con
struction of two torpedo-boats, is due
neither to original capital invested nor to
the assistance of subsidies. The measure
of success has been filled entirely by the
indomitable perseverance and untiring en
ergy of the proprietors themselves.
The Government has more recently
awarded Wolff <fc Zwicker another con
tract for the construction of two light
ships and tbe shipyards of this company
are probably the most active in the United
States at this time.

SAUSALITO, Cal., May 2.â The first
public bicycle races held in Sausalito were
witnessed to-day by a large crowd. Water
street was lined on eitber side by young
ladies in summer costumes, who with
their escorts cheered the riders as lh-
sped past.
An unfortunate accident occurred early
in the afternoon, when West, while ridfnp
on the grade near Wildwood Glen, at
tempted to pass a team, and losing his
Dalance rolled down the steep embank
ment, fracturing his hip in the fall. He
was conveyed, to the waiting-room of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad, where his
injuries were attended to. He was taken
to the City on an afternoon boat.
Marshal Jobn E. Creed had his dignity
shocked by seeing H. Williams appear in
racing costume without stockings. Creed
proceeded to arm himself to belabor tne
unfortunate rider. He was finally per
suaded to abandon this idea. William?, j
in order to avoid trouble, donned his
stockings, and Creed's opportunity to gain
fame was lost.
Following are^he results of the races:

LOST IM A VALLEJO FIRE.
Valuable Historical Chart of the World
Destroyed.
VALLEJO, Cal., May 2.â Elder Miles
Grant lost in a fire in the Cornell Baptist
Church Friday night a valuable Adams'
historical chart of the world, which ha
has been using for the past twenty years
throughout the United States to assist in
illustrating his biblical lectures of the
earlier history of the world. The chart,
which had been enlarged on canvas to
sixty feet in length, was to have beau
used in the church tbat evening. Prior to
opening the doors for the lecture tho
elder, with one or two assistants, was en
gaged in placing the canvas in position on
tbe platform at the rear of the altar. A
gust of wind from one of the open win
dows blew the end of the roll of pictures
against a gasjet, and in a moment tbe en
tire roll was in flames. Only by heroic
efforts on the part of the elder and his
assistants were the tapistry and altar sur
roundings saved from destruction.
Close of Tulare's Carnival.
TULARE, Cal, May 2.â Tulare's
highly successful roÂ«e carnival closed last
night after a splendid three nights' dis
play. Never before were such profusion
and variety of floral beauty placed before
a Tulare public. The Rose Queen, Miss
Nellie Wilson, ruled graciously, and her
loyal legions enjoyed every moment of the
festivities. Prizes were awarded for tbe
best display of pansies, roses and sweet
peas, Jacob Faust, Mrs. D. R. Miller and
Mrs. Miles Ellsworth being the winners
in the order named.

2798, Fourth 3071. Fifth 4321. Sixth 3762.
Seventh 4040, Eighth 3331, Ninth 2769;

The most interesting point in the

it is the Kaiser or the Czar who is acting

If the Senators do not hurry up a little

It is said that Bailey of Texas has the

The Boston Herald is right enough in

The people from other cities who at

When Cleveland raised to office a man

The statesmen out of office in Europe

By and by there will be a kinetoscope
syndicate to send a battalion of men with
machines to take battle scenes in all wars,
and then the folks that stay at home

they occurred, and war correspondents will

It is announced that in response to an
invitation from Philadelphia fifty or more
representative business men from South
and Central America and Mexico will
visit the principal cities of this country

a good idea to bring them West for a time.
There is a chance for them to find trade

Petitions are pouring in upon Congress

New York has discovered that for the

The Indiana law fixing the streetcar

.S. .â¢â -.â  .-.'-:. .
THE DAWN OF FBOSPEBITY.
In spite of the occasional sneer of popo
cratic philosophers that the dawn of pros
perity is being strangely delayed, it can
not be denied that tbe trade situation is
brightening and that business is bet
ter than in 1896. The exports of
produce from the United States thus far
this year show an increase of $144,000,000
oveT the same period in 1896, which is a
gain large enough to satisfy the most ex
acting grumbler.
If we look below the surface and study
the Custom-house exhibits we will see
that the balance of ttade has been in
favor of the United States for a year,
taking this period as a whole. Under a
proper tariff we would not only enjoy the
profits arising from this large balance, but
those derived from a greatly stimulated
internal commerce as well. This fact is
well understood by business men, hence
their anxiety for the passage of a suitable
tariff bill.
The local situation is pretty well fo
cused down to two features the tariff and
the crop outlook. Taken as a whole, the
latter is brilliant. True, the cereal out
look is somewhat dubious, owing to the
recent lack of rain, but the fruit outlook
'is more than excellent. Up to last
"Wednesday the fruit interests expected
low prices to rule during the coming sea
son, but on Thursday the whole prospects
underwent a sudden change. Reports
that the fruit crops of the Eastern States
had been seriously damaged by late â  frosts
created an immediate revulsion of opinion.
It will be remembered that six or seven
years ago the failure of the Eastern fruit
crops put millions of additional profits
into the pockets of California fruit-grow
ers. Everything that could be shipped
East was sent there and brought large re
turns. It was a banner year for the fruit
men. The present year bids fair to be
S similar, though prices will probably not
Ibe as high as they were then. Values of
i all commodities are on a lower plane now,
I and the purchasing power of the country
jis not as large. Besides, the destruction
lin the East is not as widespread. It is se
j vere enough, however, to almost insure
good profits to growers of California fruit
I this season.
I For the past several days The Call has
â  been publishing a series of exclusive fruit
crop reports, both from the East and Cali
fornia. They tell the story. They show
that the home crop will not be heavy and
the Eastern crop will be scanty. Good
! prices will follow as a natural result, and
I millions of Eastern money will probably
I flow into California pockets later on.
And as prices for wheat bid fair to keep
j up to a profitable plane it is safe to say
j that the California farmer will do better
I this year than for some years back.
When the farmer prospers the rest of
the community flourishes; hence if pres
ent indications are realized we ought to
enjoy increased mercantile activity during
the rest of the year.
A COMING OPPORTUNITY.
The merchants and manufacturers of the
larger cities in the East are making ar
rangements for the reception this summer
of a number of men representing leading
lines of business in South America, Cen
tral America and Mexico, who are to visit
this country for the purpose of studying
our products and seeing to what extent
they can carry on a profitable trade with
us.
The visitors are to come to this country
on the invitation of the officials of the
Philadelphia Commercial Museum. It
will be remembered that last year a num
ber of American manufacturers made a
tour of investigation through South Amer
ican countries for trade purposes, and the
return visit from the merchants of those
countries is an outcome of that tour. The
manufacturers saw that a good field was
open for them to the south, and now they
have Invited representative merchants
from the various countries to visit us in
order that they may see what goods we can
furnish to supply their demands.
It is announced that the visitors are ex
pected to arrive next JiAe, but we have
not seen any notice. of the extent of the
tour which they will make nor any state
ment of what cities they will visit. It
would seem, therefore, to be advisable for
some orcanizntion in this City, either the
State Board of Trade, the Chamber of
Commerce or the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, to communicate with
the officers of the Philadelphia Commer
cial Museum and if possible make ar
rangements for bringing the visitors to
San Francisco.
If the time of the visitors permits it, it
would be a good plan to arrange for them
a general tour of the cities of the Pacific
Coast from Pnget Sound to San Diego.
There can be no question that much is
produced along this coast for which good
markets can be fonnd in Mexico, Central
and South America and which the mer
chants of those countries could find it
profitable to handle. All of those coun
tries ought to consume a considerable
quantity of California wine, and a large
number of articles of our manufacture.
At any rate, the visit of such men to this
country for trade purposes is certainly an
industrial and commercial opportunity
for as which we ought not to ht pass with
out employing.
The press of the leading Eastern cities
is giving considerable space to the subject,
and it. is evident that each city will vie
with the other in giving entertainment to
the visitors. The total number expected
will hardly exceed fifty, but they are said
to ba men who represent large interests
and are capable of influencing a vast
amount of trade in their various countries.
California could easily afford to give an
entertainment to these men not inferior
to that provided for them in any other
State in the Union, and it is worth our
while to undertake it.
VENEZUELA'S GREAT RAILWAY.
It was a iavorite and plausible argu
ment of some Englishmen in regard to
British rights in settling the Venezuelan
boundary that to surrender any of the
territory claimed by the English was sim
ply to limit the bounds of civilization and
give to an unprogressive state opportuni
ties which it would never properly utilize.
Uncle Sam, basing his authority on the
Monroe doctrine, overruled that argu
ment, and a recent report to the State
Department from our Consul, Plumacher,
giving an account of the great railway
in Venezuela shows that country is pro
gressing and has possibilities of future
greatness to an extent which gives a com
plete refutation to the Britisher's logic.
The road is one of the finest pieces of
engineering skill in the world. It had
more obstacles to surmount than the far
famed Oroya Railroad of Peru and the
trans-Andine line between Chile and
Buenos Ayres. It connects the capital,
Caracas, with the thriving interior city of
Valencia, which is the metropolis of an
immense section of fertile land. The road
boldly strikes across a strip of country so
frowning with precipitous mountain brows
and threatening with deep and seemingly
impassable gorges that nature appeared
to bave placed her veto there to any pass
age that was not winged.
The successful undertaking of this road

peopled with 2,000,000, is capable of sup
porting in bountiful plenty a population
of 30,000,000. It is said there are no ex
tremes of heat and cold, and the region
abounds with breezy highlands and val
leys which are perfectly healthy. Sugar
cane, coffee, Indian corn and vegetables
of all kinds flourish there. The Govern
ment realizes the need of immigration.
Liberal concessions have been granted,
and laws especially framed for this pur
pose have been passed.
Mr. Plumacher adds that internal peace
seems now tolerably assured, and that
with the exception of a few professional
revolutionists, who cannot comprehend
that the people are yearly becoming more
intelligent, scarcely any one thinks of
civil war a3 a romedy for real or supposed
grievances. If this proves to be true the
future of Venezuela is assured, and we
may yet have in that country a trade that
will be vastly beneficial to our own.
PABK PLANS.
The rapidity with which the movement
for park extension in this City goes for
ward affords ample grounds to justify the
conclusion that it will shortly become one
of the dominant issues of municipal de
velopment. The proposal for the estab
lishment of a park in the Mission has been
warmly supported by the entire press of
the City, and now some of the influential
members of the Board of Supervisors have
begun the consideration of a vaster scheme
of the same kind, and have put it into a
shape that will attract public considera
tion and doubtless win a considerable
decree of popular favor.
Ths plan as proposed by Chairman
Devany and other members of the Street
Committee of the Board of Supervisors is
truly a magnificent one. It proposes the
establishment of a series of parks within
the City limits, one of which at least is to
be of sufficient magnitude to rival Golden
Gate Park, and the others are to consti
tute no inconsiderable additions to the
general park plans. It is the desire of the
promoters to hasten the accomplishment
of this extension as rapidly as possible, as
it is evident that the land required for the
proposed parks can be obtained now much
cheaper than at any future time. \
An undertaking of such an ambitious
nature will be something of a surprise
to the people of San Francisco. It is
only in Chicago of all the progressive
cities of America where such a chain
of narks connected by stately boule
vards has been realized. The park sys
tem of that city has been the admira
tion aud despair of her rivals in the East.
It is the admiration of San Francisco
also, but from the movement now begun
it is evident that it may not be our de
spair. There are men among us who be
lieve that we cannot only rival it, but sur
pass it, and girdle Ban Francisco with a
series of parks from the Presidio on the
north round by the Golden Gate on the
ocean, across the mountain-tops, and so
on, to the shores of the bay at the south
ern extremity of the City.
The establishment of such a series of
parks is ' possible, and if the subject is
kept well to the front and the plans aie
devised with ordinary wisdom, there is a
prospect it may become probable. At any
rate an idea of this kind once put forward
will never be wholly lost sight of. Al
ways there will be more or less considera
tion given to the project, and in the grow
ing civic patriotism of the people, the in
creasing municipal pride of citizens and
the fuller understanding of the import
ance of parks to tho community, it is not
unlikely that a time will come when this
ambitious scheme will be taken up practi
cally and accomplished to the satisfaction
of our most sanguine hopes.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
The old Japanese training-ship Asama,
built of wood about forty years ago, was re
cently sold at auction for $5340, and some of
the journals assert that there was corruption
iv tbe transaction.
Ninety-five ships-of-war of 335,455 tons are
in course of construction in the dockyards
and private yards in England. Of this num
ber 53 vessels of 121, 375 tons are building in
private yards for the British navy and 28 of
71,060 tons for loreign Governments.
Schneider's works at Le Creuzot are to build
three torpedo-boats for the French navy. The
boats are to have a speed of 24 knots and to
cost $63,380 each. The contract price of
boats in this country of 24 5 knot speed is
$97,500, or 54 per cent higher than the
French boats.
China has decided to keep pace with Japan's
navy and will order in the near future four
more armored cruisers of about 8000 tons,
two fast cruisers, or commerce-destroyers, and
several torpedo-boat destroyers. The size of
the larger vessels is limited by the absence of
harbors and drydocks in China to accommo
date anything larger than 10,000 tons.
A triple-screw battle-ship of 12.052 tons is
to be begun shortly at Brest. The engines will
be of 15,500 horsepower under forced draught,
to give a speed of 18 knots. The boilers will
be adapted for the burning of either coal or
petroleum. The armanjent will consist of
four 12-inch Canet guns,' eight 6J--Â£-inch, eight
4-inch and sixteen six-pounders. All of the
guns except the four 12-inch will be quick
firers. â â â ;:â â '-.:
Japan is carrying out her naval programme
with dispatch and orders for ono and possibly
two battle-ships will be given to English ship
builders. The two ships will be 14,850 tons
displacement, and are to carry four 12-inch
wire-wound guns mounted at an elevation of
twenty-five feet above water, enabling them
to be fought in the heaviest seas. The other
armament will include ten (5-inch and twenty
slx-pounder3. Each ship will cost nearly
$4,000,000, exclusive of guns.
The turbine system of propulsion is likely to
receive a trial on a largo scale warranted by
its success in a small torpedo-boat. The Tur
biana, built at Newcastle-on-Tyne, developed
a little over 30 knots speed on her first trial
about three months ago, but with certain im
provements has finally reached 32% knots.
The boat is only 42 tons displacement and 100
feet In length and is at least three-quarters of
a knot faster than any of tho torpedo-boat de
stroyers which range from 220 to 250 tons
and have a length of 180 to 220 feet.
Olive green has been selected by the German
Admiralty as the most suitable color for war
vessels as it renders ships least visible to
the enemy. This color was chosen by our
Navy Department a couple of years ago, but
having no war on hand, nor in prospect, our
ships are still painted white, which is more
conducive to the comfort on board ship than
any other color. During the Brazil rebellion
in 1894 the loyal ships were painted olive
green, which enabled the torpedo-boats to
approach the rebel flagship Aquldaban within
400 yards undetected and destroy her.
A Russian naval commission, appointed to
decide as to the most suitable fuel for large
ships-of-war aud torpedo-boats, has recom
mended that in consequence of the cost of
liquid fuel, as compared with coal, the Baltic
fleet shall use coal, but that as an experiment
half of the boilers of the battle-ship Admiral
Aprlxaus shall be adapted for liquid fuel. As
regards torpedo-boats these crafts are to use
liquid fuel. Owing to the difficulty of estab
lishing naphtha tanks at stations not under
Russia's control all large cruisers and ar
mored ships will have to continue to burn
coal. _____

David N. Carvaiho and David T. Ames oi New
Statement of Crop of Sugar Beets Raised for the Western Beet-Sugar
Company, Watson in J 896, by Dethlefsen Brothers on
the Ranch of P. Breen, Near San Juan, Cal.
We give below a statement of the cost of raising and profits of beets farmed by the Dethlef
sen brothers, near San Juan. It will be noticed that a handsome saving was effected by work
ins beets by 'day labor instead of contracting them. Tho thinning, topping and loading of
beets Into wagons cost 55 cents per ton of beets, whereas the neighbors paid $1 05 per ton of
beets to contract those operations. Tho Detblefsens here made a gain oi $2225 50. It should
be stated that the profits to the Dethlefsens were greater than shown by the statement, as all of
their own work is charged for at full rates of wages. The hauling charge of 50 cents per ton
for a three-mile haul is too high, and with improved roads and sprinkling service will
cost loss this year. We will from time to time furnish our readers with similar accounts of the
best- farmed beet-fields in the Pajaro, Salinas and San Benito valleys. Beet farmers will find
these useful for comparison. [-JJJJ.J- \ ...- -,

Investors' Attention at Present

Contracts Recorded.
During the past week affairs in the real es

ever, is not in bad condition and prices re
main firm, notwithstanding the prevailing
apathy. . l'jÂ§
The tendency with investors Just now is to
ward the smaller-priced lots for building pur
poses. The town is spreading out very rapidly
in all directions, and centrally located resi
dence sites at a moderate figure will soon be
at a premium. The extension of the street
car service to all of the outlying sections of
the City and the building of cross-town roads
has had a good effect upon small holdings.
Money continues easy, the banks being filled
with coin, and the several building contracts
which pass to record weekly show that opera
tions in this line are quite lively.

SPOOKS ON THE
CAPTAIN WEBER
Dr. McCall and Frank
Boley Are Now Play
ing Pranks.
Waiters Assert That They Have
Seen Both Men Twice
Since Their Death.
Â«
Act Over Again in tbe Stateroom
Tbeir Last Night on
Earth.
Negroes are the most superstitious peo
ple in the United States, and those em
ployed on the steamer Captain Weber are
no exception to the rule. They swear by
all the saints in the calendar that the
spirits of Dr. James C. McCall and Frank
Boley hold high revel in one of the stern
wheeler's staterooms between the hours of
12 and 4 a. m.
The two men go through what one of the
waiters calls '"a Cherokee war dance.' 1
Then one of the men lies down and a min
ute later draws a flask from bis hip rocket
and takes a drink. He puts the flask close
to bis left hand and goes to sleep.
The other spirit remains around for a
time and then starts to get to bed. It
takes off its shoes and stockings, puts a
pillow from the upper berth on the floor
and lies down. Then the spook sees the
flask, reaches over and seizes it. After
the curtain falls and rises again all the
negroes can see is the ordinary stateroom
usually seen on a river steamer, in which
is an empty whisky flask and two bodies â
apparently two passengers "under the
weather."
"So help me, mister," Baid one of the
waiters yesterday, "it it isn't just like
life. Dr. McCall he goes to sleep quick.
The other man he walks around a long
time. When he takes that last drink of
whisky, then the lights go out."
Thursday morning the Stockton steamer
Captain Weber arrived at Clay-street
wharf with two dead bodies in one of tbe
rooms. They were Dr. James C. McCall,
a physician, and Frank Boiey, a
a carpenter. Both men were well known
in Stockton, and several of their boon
companions were down to see them off
when tbe steamer sailed. McCall secured
a stateroom, but Boley only paid his gen
eral fare, which amounted to 25 cents. At
Antioch he and the doctor went ashore
and alter asking their way to a saloon
disappeared. The supposition is that on
their return they brought a flask of
whisky with them, and that the doctor
dropped more than his wont of his favorite
drug into it.
Be that as it may both men were hi
larious when the steamer was once again
under way for San Francisco. Neither
was seen alive again and just how they
came to their death no one knows unless
it happened as the negro waiters on the
Captain Weber assert it did. Twice they
have seen Dr. McCall and *Frank Boiey in
a state of jollity and then tney see the doc
tor go to sleep and then Boley follow his
example.
The captain and purser of the steamer
laugh at the story and say it is all born of
the imagination. Purser Gillis has slept
in the room in which the men were found
and he never saw Â« sign of a spook. "Best
room in the ship. Never had a better
night's rest in my life," was all Mr. Gillis
would say. The unfortunate part of the
business is that since the ghost story has
got around the entire traveling public
wants that particular room.
It will be no fault of the waiters if every
passenger on to-night's trip does not have
"the" room in question. Just who will
see the ghosts, however, remains to be
seen.
Accidental Deaths.
Edward Cuardo, a teamster, while unload
ing some lumber on Friday, was caught under
the falling boards, and received injuries
which caused his death. He was conveyed to
the City and County Hospital after receiving
the injuries, which eventually proved fatal.
His body was removed to the Morgue.
Amanda yon Ronn, a young woman of 29
years, was found dead at the home of her par
ents, 1134 Filbert street, yesterday morning
from the effects of coal eas through careless
ness, it is supposed, in turning oS the jet. An
open book was found on a chair at the head of
the girl's bed, snowing that she had been
reading previous to turning out the light
This, with a very loose stopcock on the jet'
was taken as proof that. in turning out the
light the girl made a mistake.
The woman tennis champion of New
Zealand has but one hand, and that is the

A NORTHWESTER
RAISED TROUBLE
Steamers Walla Walla and
Corona Were Both De
layed.
The Missionary Barkentine
Morning Star Caught in
the Gale.
Arrival of a Scotchman Who Has
Been Twenty-Five Years in
the Carolines.
Every vessel that reached port yester
day had a tale of hard times to tell. The
Walla Walla, from Puget Sound ports,
ran into the storm off Flattery and was
delayed five hours, the Corona was nine
hours behind time and it was only by a
scratch that the missionary barkentine
Morning Star got in at all.
The representatives of the Pacific Trans
fer Company and the Commercial Trans
fer Company made a race for the Corona,
and both men had a very hard time of it.
M. Kelly, for the Pacifies, got aboard, but
got wet through in making it. Wells
stood on and off in his launch, and using
the megaphone secured the bulk of the
business. When the Corona docked both
runners looked as though they had been
soaking in the bay for half an hour.
"OS Flattery it blew a gale," said Cap
tain Wallace of the Walla Walla yester
day. "There were times when we were
lucky to hold our own, and if it had not
been for a lucky change in the wind we
would not have got in Sunday morning."
According to the passengers the waves at
times ran mountains high and frequently
broke over the ship, making it very un
comfortable for people promenading the
deck.
The Corona had almost a similar expe
rience. Between Point Conception and
Port Harford Captain Jepsen said she was
ten hours making forty miles, and after
passing Point Sur there were time-* when
the good ship was not making a knot an
hour. "Even if we are behind time," said
Captain Jepsen yesterday, "we have made
a splendid run considering the weather.
We had the gale blowing in our teeth ever
since wo passed Conception, and in the
circumstances the Corona has made a
splendid showing." i|
The Morning Star is the missionary ves
sel connected with the Congregational
Church. She is barkentine riirged and
has an auxiliary screw. Yesterday
while making an anchorage she had
several narrow escapes. A native seaman
was at the wheel and when Captain Bray
ordered him to put his helm to starboard
he put it hard aport and nearly ran the
vessel Into the ferry-boat San Rafael.
When given the word "steady" he im
mediately put a rope around the spokes to
hold the wheel "hard aport" and as the
Morning Star began describing a circle
she nearly ran down the schooner Piute.
After that the captain took the wheel
Mr.v Jeannette Thornton, Who Attempted Suicids, and HÂ«*N-Â»
Thorntor> Her H-usfcait?*
himself and finally brought the barken
tine to an anchor.
The Morning Star had a terrible time of
it in the northwester. All hands were on
deck for fifty-six hours and Captain Bray
and Chief Officer Garland were completely
worn out when the vessel came to an
anchor. The Star 'has been constantly in
commission for five years and during that
time she has only been twice on the dry
dockâonce at Auckland, N. Z., and once
at Honolulu, H. I. She is now in San
Francisco for a thorough overhauling.
Captain Bray, who was formerly secretary
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion of Oakland, brought her up, while
Captain Garland, who had commanded
the craft in the southern seas, came up as
first mate.
For five years the Morning Star has
been cruising among the Gilbert, Marshall
and Caroline groups, mating her head
quarters at Run in the Carolines.
Amoug the passengers from that point
is a venturesome Scotchman named A.
(Sandy) Bowker. He made his home in
Ruk in ISBI and there married one of the
native princesses. He has now three
handsome little children and wants them
educated. He is a carpenter by trade, but
is a handy man at anything. When the
Moraine " Star's engineer was taken sick
"Sandy" took charge of the machinery
and ran the ve-sel as though he had been
born to the business. According to him
Chriatianity is gaining ground in the
Southern seas and in a lew years idols of
wood and stone will be sold as curiosities.
Lieutenant E. F. Webber, engineer in
charge of the revenue cutter Hartley, has
been ordered to New "fork, where he will
take command of the engine-room of the
revenue cutter Chandler. Mr. Webber has
made a host of friends while in California,
all of whom will be sorry to hear of his
removal. __^_____

LOVE STRONGER

Mediums Glad They Sur
vived Trances and
Chloroform.
Professor Thornton and His Wife
Deny Charges of His
Bigamy.
"I Married Him When Wide Awake,
and I Lova Him With Mj
Eyes Open," She Says.
Mrs. Jeanette Daisy Thornton, pretty,
brunette, and 19. is happy with her hus
band, the hypnotist, at 44 Sixth street.
She is glad that the chloroform tbat she
drank Saturday night when she believed
her husband had divers wives elsewhere
did not kill her.
And Professor H. N. Thornton, tail,
blond, and 28, is glad he did not die at
the Receiving Hospital in a hypnotic fit,
caused by his wife's trial at suicide. Both
were alive, well and happy yesterday.
But Mrs. Thornton's parents were dis
consolate all day at 956 Folsom street
They say they went to the wedding be
cause they did not want an elopement,
but they now believe that Thornton has a
wife in the Eeast.
"We have been told about his wife by
an officer," said Mrs. Powell, "and will
sift it to the bottom. If be is & bigamist
it is all up with him."
But Thornton is happy. "I've no other
wile," said be, "and I love this little girl
devotedly."
Then Mrs. Thornton expressed herself
on the subject, saying*: "I don't want
people to say I was married when in a
hypnotic sleep, though I do have trances
and day inspirational music. I married
bim awake and I love him with my eyes
open, and I don't care who knows it."
The bride and groom are mediums well
known in spiritualistic circles. The bride's
parents assert that their daughter's pow
ers are of a higher order than her hus
band's.
"He married her to make money," said
Mrs. .Powell, "and he will mate it out of
her superior mediumship."
The professor denies that he used any
arts diabolical to win bis fair bride. He
frankly admits that he can hypnotize cer
tain people; that he often has strange
trances wherein be hears the angels talk,
and that he is a spiritualist to the core.
"But my wife has trances, too," he said,
"and when she sits nt a piano her inspira
tional playing is grand. Why don't they
call her the spell-binder and me tbe sub
ject?"
The professor insists that he has no
wives elsewhere. "I'd be a fool to marry
this young girl," he said, "if 1 had a wife
anywhere else, and if I have I ought to
go to some dark: and noisome prison."
The bride and groom were happy yes
terday afternoon. They intend to give
hypnotic exhibitions and seances. As
the bride's parents are spiritualists also
the professor believes they will be good
Iriends with him again when they learn
that they have been imposed upon by
rumors. '

From City Pulpits
Yesterday morning witnessed the en
trance of Dr. E. Nelander. Ph. D., npon
the pastorate of the First English Evan
gelical Lutheran Church, Geary street,
near Goueh.
Shortly after 11 o'clock the new pastor
was escorted by the council of the church j
to the altar, where he was received by the j
retiring minister, the whole congregation j
rising. Following this ceremony came an
anthem by the choir, then the. regular j
morning service or ritual, with hymns, j
another anthem and a basso solo by Rob- I
crt Blair.
Dr. Nelander made his first sermon from j
the text, "Give me thy hand" (II Kings, j
x. 15), delivering a very earnest, sympa- I
thetic and powerful address on the mutual
work which he and the congregation this i
day were about to enter upon. The â 
hearty handshaking by the congregation \
en masse after the service would indicate j
that his words bad deeply impressed the |
hearers.
Dr. Nelander, who is quite well known I
in the City from his connection with the '
Ebenezer Swedish Lutheran Church, was ;
born at Knoxville, 111.. September 16, 1555, â¢
and was educated in the public schools of j
Knoxville, at Knox Academy, Gaiesbttrg,
IH., at Augustana Colleee, Rock Island. ;
and at tne University of Berlin, in Ger- J
many.
He received the degrees of A.B. and ;
A.M. from Augustana College. In ISS3 '
be was elected president of Bethany Col- j
lege, Liudsborg, Kans. This position he j
held for seven years, during which the
institution from an attendance of sixty
students increased to 360. and from two
instructors to thirteen. He accepced ttie
pastorate of the Swedish Lutheran Church
at Kansas City, Mo., in 1889.
Dr. Nelander has been known as one of
the most ardent advocates ofthe introduc
tion of English into the services of the :
Swedish churches of the Augustana Sy
nod as a means of keep ng the youneer j
generation attached to the mother church. ,
Previous to accepting the call of the j
First Enelish Lutheran Church he served
a very successful pastorate at the Ed- j
enezer Church for four years, and severed j
his connection therewith only on account
of the greater opportunities which he be- j
lieves there are for prosecuting evangeli- |
cal Lutheran work in the English lan
guage.
.
The Worldliness of
The Church of To-Day
At the Cuurch of the Holy Spirit. 2127
Jackson street, the pastor. Rev. 0. C.
_liiler, beg.-in a series of afternoon ser
mons, under the general head of a protest
against the unscriptural methods of the
present day Protestant church.
His subject was that of revivals; his
text from Habakkuk iii:2: "0 Lord, revive
thy work in the midst of the years, in the
midst of the years make known; in
wrath remember mercy." lie said in
pari:
The text should be the prayer of the
church to-dry, enfeebied as she is by loss
of the Spirit's power. Both church and
Nation are in a transition period. Eccle
siasticism is not the Christianity of Christ.
Denominationalism is in decay and decay
is the forerunner of death. Revival and
reviving is the normal condition of the
church.
It is the work of the Holy Spirit. Not
by might nor by power of man, but by
the spirit of the Lord. The effects of a
genuine revival are the regeneration of
sinners and quickening of believers â the
latter must loilow as a preparation for the
former. The first thing in order is the
conversion of the church. For genuine
revival there is but one model, that car
ried out in the first twelve chapters of the
Acts. A few obscure believers get to
getner in prayer, and they continue with
one accoru. Had there been a daily pa
per in Jerusalem at the time the report
ers would have scarcely found it out.
How different from the way the church
tries to do it to-day ! Consecration of
service and money followed prayer. There
could be "no unction without function."
Revival must come from better observa
tion of the Lord's supper and more scrip
tural home life. Let us go back tc the
one Pentecostal model. New methods are
not needed; human nature is the sama.
Compare the modern methods with tha
Pentecostal model and they are found
v,* an ting. â 
The Holy Spirit is not so incapable that
he must come to man for methods. Man
is instrument, not method, when used by
him. The two agencies of a genuine re
vival are the Holy Spirit and the church,
and these are inseparable. Since the days
of Finney there have be-'n no widespread
revivals, nor will there be until there is a
new order of Protestant Christianity. The
lost power of the church can only be re
gained by her return to purity through
the sanctifying influence of the Holy
Spirit. The present day church with its

strife and worldliness cannot furnish a
refuse for the newly converted. Jewels
mini be set in pure, fine gold. The growing
plant cannot stand the icehouse. Nothing
but a genuine revival can silence the skep
tician of to-day ana bring protection of
the church against her many enemies,
the most dangers of which are within ber
communion. The body of true believers
can confidently say with David: "Though
I walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt
revive me; thou shalt stretch forth thine
band against the wrath of mine enemies
and thy right hand shall save me."
The burden of revival-bringiug preach
ing must be the burden of sin pressed
upon the individual heart and conscience.
Tne preaching of the law must nail us
each to his cross that we may die, that
Christ may live within us. Even in these
perilous times and last days before our
Lord fulfills his promise to "so come
in like manner as he was seen to go Into
heaven."

Christianity and
Socialism Compared.
Last evening Rev. William Rader of the
Third Congregational Church spoke on
"Christianity and Socialism." In part he
said:
"In the evolution of government we â 
have passed the stage where government j
was everything and man was nothing,
and the stage where man was everything i
and the government nothing.
â¢'Tne one was the age of paternalism, '
when the individual sat in the lap of the j
state; the other was the age of per
sonal liberty, according to the doctrine of j
Rousseau.
"We are now enjoying the period of
fraternity in which the government and
personal freedom are wonting in har
mony. Out 01 this new relation is spring
ing a universal unity. In religion we call
it brotherhood, in politics democracy and
in industry ana society socialism.
"Christianity and socialism have much
in common when both are properly de
fined. Christian socialism is applied
Christianity. This mans more than a
single element of sociaiitm such as state j
ownership of the implements of industry. |
"There is a Christianity in socialism and j
a socialism in Christianity. Jesus was an \
individualist, it is true, and did not speak I
against taxation or the wrong use of wine
or the evils of existing government. Bat
He was aiso a socialist. He did not use
that term, but the phrase, 'Kingdom of
God,' a dream of a reconstructed social j
order as old as the Republic of Plato.
"Socialism and Christianity alike believe j
in making the worid better; tbe one from j
without, the other from within; the one
beginning with the individual, the other
beginning with the social order. Evjry j
good man cannot escape the duty of being !
both individualist and socialist at tho
same time. Ju las and his money bag af
ford a field of labor lor both.
"The golden link binding Christianity
with socialism is the commandment,
'Love thy neighbor as thyself,' the mean
ing of wbich is that there is no difference
between the happiness of the individual
and that of the public; that what is
wrong for the one is not right for the
many. He who has a religion fur himself
and another for the public is a fraud."
The Promise
of the Father.
The Rev. D. V. Bowen of the First
New Jerusalem Church preached yes
terday from the following words: "Be
hold I send the promise of my Father
upon you; but tarry in the city of Jeru
salem until ye be endued with power
from on high." (Luke xxiv:49). In part
he said:
"The promise of the Fatherâ the gift of
the Holy Spiritâ was fulfilled on the day
of Pentecost. And the Apostle Peter de
clares 'that Jesus shed lorth this which
was seen and heard, and that the gift of
the Holy Spirit was promised to all, even
as many as the. Lord our God shall call
unto him.' By the Holy Spirit, the Com
forter, the Helper, the Spirit of Truth is
meant the spiritual influence of the Lord
upon the minds and hearts of men, which
is forthe purpose of reformation, regener
ation and finally salvation.
"The Lord breathed on his disciples and
said 'Receive ye the Holy Spirit.' And he

out of Heaven â in the doctrines of the
spiritual sense of the word. W-* are to
tarry, to learn, practice and receive into
our lives these heavenly things, and then
we can be endued with power frora on
high, or the highest power, the power
of the Holy Spirit, which is the baptism of
fire, an influence of unselfish, divine love
in our hearts. Then we can know that the
Lord is, not only the way â the truth â but
the life â etern?.l life to all who will re
ceive him. And, as we abide with him,
live the highest truths we know, he will
endue us each day more and more with
power, power to turn from false things,
power to overcome all evil. And we shall
then know him as our Redeemer, the ever
present Savior, the Holy Spirit."
After service the holy supper was ad
ministered and seven members received,
making seventeen new members admitted
to the society during the short time that
Mr. Bowen has been tbe pastor.

The Philosophy of
Life and Death.
At Olivet Church yesterday Rev. H. T.
Shepard preached on the subject of "Life
and Death." He said in part:
The grain of wheat decays and feeds the
new germ, and lives again in many other
grains like itself, and thus increases its
usefulness. The human body constantly
dies. It becomes an entirely new body
again and again after short periods of
years. Religious thought is constantly
evolved with new harvests of golden truth,
instinct with new life. This is the history
of the Christian religion from its begin
ning to the present time. This constant
development is not a dogma nor a theory,
but a fact. Christianity and science are
joining hands to-day in paying reverence
to the uniathomed if not unfathomable
mystery of life. One may see God in it,
while the other sees oniy the unknown
force, but acknowledgment of an un
known and apparently superhuman force
that cannot be created by any means
which arc known to man is akin faith in
Israel's Jehovah, and tends toward refuge
from doubt in the known and incarnate
Christ, the creating "Word" of the Gospel
of John.
How to Acquire
And How to Hold.
Rev. Dr. Jewell of Trinity M. E. Churcb
spoke yesterday from the text, "Look to
yourselves that we lose not that which
we have wrought, but that we receive a
full reward." In part he said:
There are two cautions one ia "take
care and not lose," and the other is "to
invest that which you have so
as to make it most productive."
It requires brain to acquire, more
brain to keep after you have acquired,
and, most of all. to so invest/as to realize
the largest possible returns. For every
thing of value you possess there is some
one watching to snatch it from you. Every
man of wealth has a reason to feel that
there is a conspiracy in society to wrest
from him that which he has acquired.
So in morals and relicious thing-; the
mother i-eeks to embalm the innocence of
her child, knowing well that contact with
society imperils that pearl of innocence.
The boy of San Francisco sees the
gleaming light of the night schools and
the loaded shelves and open doors of ] free
libraries floating round him, yet be trends
as listlessly as though he were on the
broad bosom of the Sahara.
Paine's Error
About the Bible.
Rev. J. S. David gave a lecture on
"Tnomas Paine and the Bible" at Wash
ington Hall list evening, in the course of
which he said: "Thomas Paine was a
deist. He believed in one God, and he
hoped for happiness beyond this life. He
was a noble man, and was a champion of
reform. His denial of the Bible was evi
dently owing to the fact that he confined
his studies to the letter of Scripture and
Knew nothing of its internal sense. He
took the symbols for the things signified.
Tbe internal sense of tbe word is the
only incontestable evidence of its divinity.
"And now that the race is prepared to
receive deeper truth than could be re
ceived in former ages the seals of the
Word are opened. Paine gloried in the
beauty and sublimity of creation, and re
garded that as the only revelation of God;
but nature, like the Bible, has her dark
side as well as ber bright side, and both
nature and Scripture are faithful mirrors
of both the lights and shadows of human
life. The Bible would not be a true reve
lation ot human states and experiences
and of the path to eternal life if it illus
trated only the beautiful and sublime in
human life."

Contract Street-Cleaning Consists of

"'.'.-* Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad waj*, .May 2. ,
* The action of the Council in refusing to
grant any licenses contrary to tho wishes
of the residents at Twenty-third avenue
â will be commended by all those who de
sire to Keep saloons out of the residence
territory. The Seventh Ward, of which
Twenty-third avenue is a part, was one of
the few wards in the city that at the re
cent election gave a" majority in favor of
the closing of saloons at all times. This
being so, a protest from that ward should
naturally have more weight than one from
a ward in which a majority was given for
keeping saloons en.
During the campaign preceding the elec
tion it was stated by the Liquor Men's
. â Protective Association that they would
prefer to have all the deadfalls in the city
closed up, so that they could no longer
' bring discredit on the legitimate dealers.
The records of the Police Court show that
: these outside saloons and roadside houses
are productive of much crime, and the
: City Council certainly did right in re
â¢ specting the wishes of the large number
of Protestants.
The object of many, but not all, of these
outside saloons is Pot to profit by the
business in the locality where they wish
to be established, but to draw from tbe
' center of Oakland an element which is not
desirable, but which is probably less un
.desirable when on the outskirts. This is
the argument made by the protestants,
and which the respectable liquor dealers
indorse.
- Ex-Judge Gibson still retains that old
feeling that animated him when be
marched under the Union flag a genera
tion ago. A little incident that happened
in a restaurant a few days ago shows very
'. strongly the Judge's character.
He sat down to his meal and just as he
... was commencing a colored man, a well
known janitor, walked into the restaurant
. and going to the most secluded corner took
a seat.
"What are you doing down there,
Allen?" cried the Judge.
"Well, sir, I generally gets into the
quietest corner," said Allen.
* "Are you too proud to eat with me?"
..: asked Judge Gibson.
"No, sah."
"Then come up here," and the Judge
and the colored janitor ate their dinner
tocether on one check and conversed of
thirty years ago.
The old barn that passes for a City Hall
periodically furnishes an argument why
it should at least be succeeded by a build
ing not inferior in size or architecture to
that of our smaller sister city of Ala
meda.
During the week one more man walked
. out of his cell and to liberty, and he was
not 'missed for several days. The conve
nient old prison had so far decayed that
â¢ boys have been known to creep out of the
-. top of cells, men have broken the piece of
j rust that restrained them, and on ono oc
â¢ .easion an inmate removed a portion of the
stone wall and crawled through. There
â¢ is nothing to prevent an ingenious fellow
â¢ from getting out of the jail, and each year
V the chances for escaping increase as the
old place rots.
On several occasions Mayors bave advo
'* cated the issuing of bonds and the erec
tion of a decent municipal pile, but the
suggestions have fallen to the ground, and
-a like fate will overtake the old building
-.if some radical improvements are not
made.
... The greatest, most offensive ana most
â¢ expensive of all the ofliciai nuisances now
. being maintained in Oaklandis the farcical
.method adopted for cleaning the streets.
Merchants and residents have protested
. against the nuisance for years, but in
â¢ vain. When the street sweeper goes by,
beating all the dirt and dust on the street
â¢' high into the air, ladies walk into entran
ces and storekeepers rush to close their
doors and windows. Sometimes as early
â¢ as 7 o'clock in the evening the abomina
tion commences and more goods are
spoiled hy this stupid system than would
pay for sweeping all the streets by hand.
* Before the present contract was let an
attempt wag made to have the work done
by hand, as Is done in San Francisco, but
it was found that tbis would cost a few
more dollars. The main fact, however,
that after the streets were swept by hand
they would be clean and no nuisance
would have been committed did not seem
to impress itself upon local officials. If
any. one wishing to make lame by cari
caturing the public contract system of Oak
land were to be on Broadway while the
street is being "cleaned" he could not
wish a better subject.

Oakland Office San* Fraxcisco Call,)
903 Broadway, MÂ«y 2- i
Chairman W. V. Spaffard of Calistoga,
chairman of the grievance committee of
the 0. K. C. system, lias written a letter
to the Federation of Railway Employes
that lias been received as a damper on the
proposed plan of federation of the five
powerful railroad unions on this coast.
The letter came in response to a request
from Secretary L. J. Bulen whom the fed
eration in this city asked to ascertain the
standing of the grievance committee as
constituted prior to the A. R. TJ. strike.
The answer was read this afternoon to a
few representatives of the federation, and
is as follows:
On May G, 1894, tho O. R. C, B. K. T., B. L.
I*., O. R. 1. and & M. A. A. met through their
representatives and signed the system federa
tion (Cedar Rapids plan). 1 was elected sec
retary of the board and C. E. Swain of the ,
B. R. T. was elected chairman. Two months
later came tne strike. The S. M. A. A. and
the B. L. F. walked out almost to a man, so
that there was not enough of them left upon
the system. to carry out their laws and dis
cipline the balance. Â» * * Three years have
elapsed and I should think that the whole
matter has lapsed under the statute of limi
tations. There have been many changes in
the material that comprises the different
orders and Ido not believe that the member
ship generally would be willing to recognize
the authority of a board oi tne '94 federa
tion. This , of course, is only my personal
opinion, but it seems to me that in order to
ascertain the feeling a vote would be neces
sary.
Owing to the failure of some one in
sending out notices there was no meeting
of the representatives of the various rail
way orders this afternoon, hence no
official action could be taken on the com
munication, but those present expressed
a determination to go ahead and organize
the federation along the ola lines. Some
of the men accuse the writer of being op
posed to the scheme of federation on the
ground of his being as far* up as he can
get and hence cares nothing for his less
fortunate brother workingmen. This is
said to be the cause of several other in
stances of indifference. However, the
matter will be pressed to a completion at
an early date.
The Golden Gate Division, No. 361 0. R.

will come in special trains from Boston,
Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta and at
the cose of the meeting come to Oakland
and San Francisco for a couple of days.

The L. A. of O. R. C. gave a very enjoy
able social at the home of Mrs. M. Plumb,
918 Center street, last evening. Whist
and other card games were played and
light refreshments served. These monthly
gatherings are greatly enjoyed by the
railroad men and their iormer families.
The statement telegraphed from New
York several days ago that a Chinese em
bassy was at work seevring American rail
road men to go to China created consider

delegation of the men waited upon the

San Francisco to ascertain the truth of
the statement. They were greatly disap
pointed when toll that "no such soft

navy is on its last legs, judging from the
lack of interest displayed this season in

with the departure of Commodore Fouts
for Eureka the end is not far. In the
races to-day there were only five entries,
] and of these the Amelia and Aeolus did
not finish, but withdrew after having
covered lhe course twice. It was a pretty
race, however, between the other three
entries, the Surprise being victor in
1:45:39, sailing time. The starting' gun
was at 2:30 o'clock and for the three prin
cipal races the time was:
Alert, W. C, start. 2:30:45; past buoy,
: 3:4:50; second, 3:40 finish, 4:10:30.

Gauzy Circulars Being Sea' Out
, Freely in Alameda
County..
A Hard Fat: Certainly Waits for
P. ople Who Make Such
Crpzy C vises.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 2. f
The old bark Mermaid which was towed
off the mut in the estuary ft few days ago
j is still being kepi prominently before the j
I people of tnis city, who have watched it j
i decaying nt its moorings for so long a
lime. Circulars are being freely distrib- i
; uted all over the city setting forth that by |
! payment of $100 one share can be ob- j
J tamed in the South Sea Islands Mining j
| and Colonization Company of San Fran- I
i cisco. These circulars set forth In glow- j
: ing terms the prospect of wealth and a J
j happy life on the Solomon Island, eight â .
i degrees south of the Equator, and inter- j
ested parties are invited to correspond i
with A. S. Lowndes of San Francisco. -< : JJ:
It is stated that there is a branch office
in this city, but so far no one has been
able to locate it. The announcement says !
that the "last-sailing bark Mermaid," j
which expression causes all Oaklanders
wbo have lately been around the estuary |
i to smile, bas been titted out for the expe
dition and will sail in a few days. The de-
I tails of the affair are much the same as
i those set forth in connection with tbe
Reinhardt fiasco, which sailed some time
ago for the manless isles of the South Sea.
The great objects of the expedition as
noted in the prospectus are on arriving at
the islands "to erect a sawmill, carry on
ship-building, stock-raising and agricul
ture, the latter including cotton, coffee,
sugarcane, tobacco, rye and indigo.''
Henry Walton, the first mate of a
British ship now in port, who is well ac
quainted with the Solomon Islands, re
ceived one of thesa circulars. The specu
lators could hardly have placed it in less
I profitable hands, for Mr. Walton makes I
no secret of the probable future of any j
such expedition.
"The class of men that are likely to bite I
at such a prospectus as this," he said, |
"had better commit suicide before they !
sail. The Solomon Islands are about the
most unlikely place for white men to set
tle in that I know of. A large portion of
the population nre savages, : pure and
simple, and men who go on such schemes
as this are not liKely lo do much ship
building or agriculture eigbtdegrees south
of the equator.
"It is from these islands that the
'blackbird' catchers employed by the
sugar-planters of New South Wales and
Victoria procure the men who work on
their sugar bald i and they are known to
be a treacherous, lazy lot of fellows, who
are only valuable because they can work
in the hot sun.
"These islands are already partly pro
tected by two European governments and
even under them it is not at all easy to
prevent tierce tribal fighting. The Solo
mon Islands is a locality where a man is
just as liKely to be eaten as not and cer- j
tainly the portions of the islands where I
such cranks would go, who would take
part in such an expedition os this, would j
naturally by the wildest and least sale.
That old" Mermaid had better be well sur- i
veyed and over: anted before she sails on i
any such cra/.v rrufse."

the South?
The Guardsmen Will Son B3 Armed
With the Improv d Springfis d
Rifl sâ lnspsctiom Needed.
There is in existence for the use of the
National Guard of the State of California
a book that is commonly known as the
"red book" from the color, of the cover.
It purports to be a book of instruction for
the guardsmen, but in view of the fact
that it was published in 1890 and sine*
then a grea: number of change- have been
made in the guard, one of which was its
entire reoganization, the red book as it is
now is of no use except to confuse those
I who read it. Several months ago a num
ber of prominent National Guard officers
agreed to revise it and maKe such changes
as would bring it tip to date and make it
accord with the changed laws, but beyond
the promises nothing has been done. The
guard is in need of a first-class red book
that will give the men an opportunity to
know, as a phrase oi the day goes, "where
they are at." The adjutant-general of
the State certainly ought to have suffi
cient interest in the matter to prepare
rules and regulations that will give every
member of the guard a clear understand
| ing of his position and duties. ',
The matter of filling the vacancy in the
office of judge-advocate on the staff of
the division commander is not yet settled.
The major-general has mail** his selection,
but the nominee, Colonel H. B. Bush, re
tired, has expressed a determination not
to accept unless it is with the rank on
which he was retired. Whether this can
be done or not is another matter. One
section of the law is very positive in as
serting that a retired officer must hold the
rank attached 10 the position to which he
is assigned, and in this case the rank of
the judge-advocate is lieutenant-colonel.
There is another section which may be
construed by a stretch of it as allowing a
retired officer 10 be detailed for a specific
duty on his rank. For the good of the
service, and to avoid the setting of a
precedent that would give every man in
the guard the right to say "If the supe
rior officer can quibble with the law why
cannot I do so?'* the retired colonel, if he
wishes to take an active part in the guard,
should accept the position tendered him
with the rank it carries, and if be feels
that, be cannot afford to be disrated he
ought to give some one else a chance.
The great need of tho guard at this time
is inspections that should be made by offi
cers detailed lor that purpose at times
when the inspecting officers are not ex
pected. Such officers could, unannounced,
visit the armories on drill nights and see
how the men drill when the inspector is
not looked for. By such visits the inspec
tor could discover exactly what the men
do and suggest reforms that would re
dound to the benefit of the guard.
The adjutant-general has consented to
allow the First Infantry and the Fifth In
fantry of the Second Brigade to bold regi
mental encampments as asked for, but no
amount has yet been apportioned for such.
The brigades in the southern part of the
State want brigade encampments, but if
such, instead of regimental or battalion
encampments, aro allowed, it will, for cost
of transportation, make a terrible inroad in
to the camp appropriation, without it is the
expressed opinion of National guardsmen,
producing any beneficial results, for the
reason that for several years the men have
had but little opportunity to come to
gether as regiments and are not as well
up in regimental drill as they might be.
In a seven-day regimental camp they
could learn something that would be of
benefit to them, while in a seven-day brig
ade camp they would have to go through
maneuvers that tney know little or noth
ing about, and by tho time they acquired
tbe first principles of it it would be lime
to return home. The money appropriated
for camp purpose should be used so as to
do the great* good to the ,uird.
The ndjutan -general has sent a request
to the War Department at Washington,
1). C, for the Slate's quota of the Spring
hell rifles that were discarded lor the
Krag-Jorgensens.
A number of canteens and haversacks
lor the use of the guard are on the way to
the distributing point and will be ready
fordelivery in due time.
Itis probable thai the First Infantry,
Second Brigade, will be ordered to parade
on Memorial day with George H. Thomas
Bust on the occasion of the unveiling of
the monument in the Presidio Cemetery,
and that the Naval Battalion, Troop A,
and the Signal Corps will be ordered to do
escort duty for the parade by Lincoln and
Cass Posts, G. A. R.
Orders are out for the inspection of the
companies of the Third Brigade, Brigade-
General Muiler commanding.
Second Brigade.
It is expected that within thirty days
the members of the First Regiment will
be armed with the latest issue of the
Springfield rifles, which have beon called
for by the adjutant-general. They will
also receive the Webb cartridge belts that
have been ordered.
There will boa meeting to-night of the
board of officers of the First Regiment In
fin try, which will be the first since Colonel
Smith assumed command.
The election of captain of Company D,
First Regiment, was held last Friday
night. Major Wagner presided, and as
Second Lieutenant Thomas J. McCreagh
was the only candidate bis election was
made unanimous.
Then followed the election of second
lieutenant. The candidates were Frank
W. Newbert. first sergeant, and Charles J.
White, second snrceant. After a spirited
contest Sergeant White was elected by a
vote of 32 to 25. The new captain bas
been in the guard for nine years, three
years of which he has been lieutenant.
He is very popular with his company.
Tne new second lieutenant has served for
seven years in the company as private,
1 corporal and sergeant, and he wiil no
doubt be an efficient assistant to the new
captain.
Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce, while out
yachting a week ago last Sunday on the
White Wings, met with an ace dent by
which one or his knees was wrenched and
he was in consequence confined to
his home for a week. He made his ap
pearance on crutches last Saturday for
the first time after the mishap. While
the injury sustained is not serious it is
painful and very annoying to a man so
active as the lieutenant-colonel.
In compliance with general orders No.
2, c. s., headquarters Second Brigade, the
annual inspection and muster of the regi
ment will be held unaer the supervision
of Major Charles Jansen, brigade in
spector, in fatigue uniform, as follows:

and Defy the

PECULIAR POSITION OF
TEE RIDERS.
Barred Now Frcm All Sanc
tioned Eastern Race-
Meets.
ALL WERE WILLING TO TAKE
THE STEP.
A Large Crowd Attends the Opening
of the California Associa
tion's Venture-
â¢ Sunday bicycle racing was inaugurated
at the Velodrome track yesterday and it
proved an undoubted success. Not only
were the contests fast and exciting, but an
immense throng of people crowded the ,
stands and cheered their favorites on to
victory. It was the largest crowd the Ye- [
lodrome had ever held, and the stands
were taxed to their utmost capacity.
It was a "swell" crowd, too, and the '
large number of ladies present added ;
color to the scene, for in the grandstand ;
they predominated. It was just such a :
crowd as attended the races last Christmas !
aud New Year's, only there were about
three times aÂ« many yesterday as at any '
previous meet.
From a racing point of view the success â 
of this meet, the first attempt of the Cali- !
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs to hold a j
meet on Sunday, in defiance of the rules j
of the League of American Wheelmen,
was assured when the entry list was given ;
out the middle of last week, for with but
few exceptions all the cracks of the Stare
â were entered, and as the prize list was I
eood. they could ba depended upon to ride
for all there was in them.
This open violation of the L. A. W. ;
mandate against Sunday track-racing did ;
not mean so much to the amateurs, who
never ride outside their own State, as it I
did to the professionals, and particularly j
the speedier ones, who might be likely at !
any time to want a race on Eastern tracks,
and would be debarred by their participa
tion in any meet here not sanctioned by
the league. To a man with hopes of an ,
Eastern career it was a serious step, for if j
the California Association make a failure '
of the new move they will be out of the
* racing business tor good.
But the support of ail the clubs in the I
State and of everybody prominent in the
sport is behind the venture, and from ap- \
pearances yesterday it will succeed.
So the racing men who had the courage \
of their convictions and were willing to
risk all and stand or fall by the result are
feeling highly elated.
Ziegler, Jones and Coulter risked more
than the others, for Ziegler and Coulter
particularly have heretofore done all their
riding in the East, and Jones was eligible i
at any time by reason of his phenomenal j

It was just such a trifle as this that
caused the big row and that dreadful
scene at the Woman's Congress
Saturday night. At least, ihe
Hindoo Brahmacharin, who claims
he was grossiy insulted by the women in
congress, says that was the cause of it,
and he certainly must have had some rea

for rising up in his robes that night and
making the atmosphere of Golden Gate

but will find enough meets in this State to 1
keep them from growing stale.
If the meets continue to be successful, I
California will gradually become the
Mecca of cyclers from the East as welt as ]
the West.
The public likes short, snappy races as
a rule, and the card yesterday was made '
up to suit, there beins nothing at a fur- i
ther distance than a mile.
The most interest in the races was cen- !
tered on the professional events, and par
ticularly in the riding of Otto Ztegler Jr., â¢
said to be the greatest racer this State has I
ever produced, and who has a National |
reputation by reason of his wonderful
performances on Eastern tracks. He has j
not been seen in competition here in
three years, although he has ridden an
occasional paced exhibition.
Clinton Coulter, another National
: circuit champion, was big drawing :
card, particularly to those who remem- j
bered his performances of a couple of j
years ago in competition with Bald, !
Cooper and other Eastern cracks.
There were two professional and two
amateur events on the pro ramme, the
many preliminary and final heats furnish- j
ing a fine afternoon's sport. The first of '
the professional races was a handicap at
two-thirds of a mile, run in two heats and
a final.
In the first heat Coulter, Allan Jone*, j
A. M. Boyden, Frank Byrne and M Bleu
ler, the latter recently from France,
started, Bleuler being the limit man with
seventy-five yards handicap, which was
none too much, as he was soon caught '
: and passed. Coulter and Jones from the
scratch mark alternated pace and soon I
made up their handicaps, passing their
field and finishing in the order named. I
j Bayden was third.
Ziegler appeared for the second heat j
and was given a splendid reception, the
applause lasting for several minutes.
He started from scratch, of course, the
others. Davis, Slater, McCrea, Chapman j
and Elford, being on various marks I
ahead, Elford, the limit man, having j
eighty-five yards handicap. By a splendid â¢
tide Ziegler caught the field in two laps |
ground of the congress just close.! â that
is, the ladies who assumed the manage
ment, are very much shocked and crieved
in a smiling way over the affair of Satur
j day nieht which came so near terminat
i ing their meeting in a riot. And
the Brahmacharin, too, is still indignant,
for he is unable to see yet why he should
have been subjected to discourtesy, par
ticularly as he is a stranger in our City
I and unaccustomed to our ways and man
ners. While regretting the incident, he
still adheres to the belief that an apology
may be due him, and the ladies, on the
i other hand, say that the name of this
Hindoo priest will be expunged from
their record ana denied the privilege of
going down into history as a participant
in tbeir congress unless he squares him
self in some emphatic and abject manner.
in searching for an explanation of that
big rumpus one will find two versions,
and as distinct as day from night. When
the Brahmacharin delivered himÂ«elf of
his "roast' ' on the congiess Saturday, he
simply vouchsafed that he bad been in
sulted and wished to resent it. He went
no further. Some people wondered what
had riled him, and others who knew held
their peace. /
â  But yesterday everybody was willing lo
talk, and did so. The Hindoo had com
pletely recovered from his fervor, but was
none the less positive that he was right in
wnat he did.
"In some respects I am sorry that it
happened," he said last evening, after his
return from Palo Alto, where he had
been lecturing to the Stanford students.
"But again lam not. The leaders who
had the congress in charge have only
themselves to blame for the scene. I did
not wish to come here in the first place,
but trey coaxed me. I was sojourning in
Los Angeles, and they wrote me letters
tellin**- me how delighted ihey would be
! to have me come and tell them something
about Oriental philosophy.
I permitted myself to believe that they
were serious that they really wished to
be enlightened and instructedâ and I
came. I have found, however, that I was
I only called to talk to a lot of society folks
who neither listen nor think, and I am
sorry that I came.
"But I will tell you how it happened. I
i was specially invited to be present last
Thursday afternoon because a paper on
j 'Heredity' was to be read by Mrs. Helen
. Gardener, and I was supposed to reply to
I it. 1 did reply and that is what caused all
I the trouble. Mrs. Gardener's theories
j were diametrically .opposed to mine on
) that subject and I supposed I would be
j allowed the right to say so.
"Well, I got up and talked, and what
was the result?
"Why, despite my earnestnessâ because
I was saying what I Had been taught to
believeâ lot of them began to snicker in
my face, and I could hear whispered com
j ments all around me.
I "I was speaking of our reincarnation
belief and our opposition to heredity, when
one of those women began to deliber
ately jerk my gown from behind,
doubtless meaning that 1 .should
desist. Such an insult I never had thrust
upon me before in my life, and I nope I
never shall again. Why.it they warned
me to stop talking, why did they not fay
so, instead of exhibiting such discourtesy ?
But at all events 1 kept my temper and
had my say. I was resolveu, however, to
tell them something before that congress
was over.
"My opportunity came Saiurday night.
I was down on the programme to read a
paper, and when my turn came I simply
arose and sa<d I would read no paper and
explained why I would not. I was per
fectly cool and calm and had no idea of
raising a disturbance. In fact I did not.
It was they who did it all. *.<

and sprinted on the third, having mis
calculated and thinking it was the end of
the race, when in fact he should Lave
ridden four. After passing the tape in the
lead on the third lap he stopped working
and sat up, and before he realized it tho
field went, by him liKe a shot ami lie was
left. McCrea won, Davis and Chapman
prising him closeh*.
This brought Coulter, Jones, McCrea,
Boydf n and Davis into the final. McCrea
and Boyden on tho long distance marks
set such a hot clip the others could not
overtake them, though they did not ap
pear to try very hard until tlie last lap.
McCrea won, Boyden second, and Jones
beat out Coulter and Davis for third
money.
In the first heat of the mile open, pro
fessional, Ziegler, Jones, Slater, Chapman
and Davis started. By alternatine the
pace-setting they moved along at quite a
lively clip for five laps, when Jones
jumped for the lead, closely followed by
Davis, Ziegler being neatly pocketed on
the inside. This order was unchanged at
the tape.
Coulter was by long odds the best man
in the other heat against McCrea, Boy
den, Elford ana Bleuler, ana won with
room to spare; Elford, the new profes
sional, who was recently a star amateur,
setting second place, Bleuler third.
By being third in the fastest heat Zieg
ler qualified for the final, the others be
ing the winners ana seconds, Jones,
Coulter, Davis and Elford. To make it
fast Chapman was put in to pace, and by
a pretty play for the position Ziegler got
first place behind him, Davis next, then
Elford, Coulter, Jones. On the fifth lap
Davis got bumped somehow and went
down throwing Elford, who turned a com
plete somersault over him. Neither was
hurt. *-: <-.*â¢ ** â¢ *'.*'
The pacer dropped out at the end of the
fifth and Jones and Coulter went by
Zecler, but the "Little Demon" was not
there to be beaten without a hard fight,
and, with his nose almost pressed against
the handle-bars ot his machine, he started
such a sprint as has seldom been seen on
a California track. Round the back turn
they flew, Jones still leading, Coulter
of a rattlesnake and then everybody went
mad.
"I do not recede one inch frora ray posi
tion. I was their guest, and had a right
to expect at least decent treatment. I did
not expect them to believe in my philos
ophy, but they certainly should have
been ladies enough to listen to me, even
though I was opposing one of their pet
theories."
The Brahmacharin would have said more
for be was in the humor, but the inter
view was necessarily cut short because he
was compelled to hurry away to Native
Sons' Hall, where he was scheduled to
deliver a lecture.
Then the other side. The ladies assert

It is not probable --that the little contretemps of Saturday night will at all injure tbe recognized good results of the
Woman's Congress. Indeed, that the discreet touch of a lady's hand on the Brahmacharin's robe, when 'the Oriental showed
syn-j-ptoms of exceeding the limits of discretion, may have averted greater discord is generally thought, possible. At any
rate, the learned Hindoo has expressed regret for his dramatic burst of anger, and the ladies are merely smiling. 'â¢ \' :
second and Ziegler on the outside, even
with Coulter. As they rounded into the
homestretch he put forth a final effort and
went by Jones, as though the latter was
standing still, winning a magnificent race
by three open lengths in 2:15 2-5, very fast,
considering the gale which opposed them
on the backstretch. Ziegler was given an
ovation when he dismounted.
Two amateur races, each with over
thirty starter*-*, furnished some good run

Road Club, and A. B. Johnson of Red

the half-mile handicap.
The limit m-n naturally made all the
running, and Russ, on the scratch mark,
had to work hard to catch them, but it
was "all off" when he did at the begin
ning of tne third lap, for be was never
headed once he assumed the lead. Gooch
ran second and Kraft third.
For the two-thirds mile open, amateur,
five winners of preliminary heats and the
second in the fastest heat qualified. They
were: Russ and Wing, Olympic; Barton
of Fresno, Williamson of Santa Rosa, D.
E. Francis. Road Club, and Mott, Re

ground out a lively gait for them. Russ

A VOICE FROM THE PULPIT.
j Dr. Dille Preaches a- Sermon on
Sunday Desecration, and Re
fers to Bicycle- Racing*.
Last evening Dr. Dillo of the Central
M. E. Church preached* on the subject,
"The Sabbathâ a â¢ Holy Day or a Holi
day?" and in his sermon he took occasion
to refer to the action of the California
Association in seceding from the League
of American Wheelmen and in adding
more to the influences which are robbing
Sunday of much of its religious character.
In reference to Sunday desecration, he
said:
After all the kind of desecration we have
most to fear is not Sunday labor, but Sunday
revelsâ the Sunday of Continental Europe,
the gay and godless Parisian Sunday, with its
sports and dissoluteness and vice.
I am not pleading for the Puritan Sabbath.
The conditions are different now. and we sim
ply could not have such a Sabbath as theirs.
Their life was simpler; the feverish hurry and
grind ol our industrial life was unknown. But
in our day, and especially in our large cities,
Sunday is about the only day many wage
workers have a chance to breathe the fresh
air of heaven. We must remember that the
Sabbath was made for man, for the whole
man â soul and spirit.
Let no workingman who is confined every
working day in close hot foundry or factory
or mill or stuffy store or office say that I ob
ject to his taking the air with wife and family
on the Sabbath so long as his outing does not
lead him to join the throng of Sabbath-bieak
ers, who turn the day of rest into a day of
reveling, and so long as it does not lead him
to neglect the house of God and the proper in
struction of his children. Let no one look
upon the Sabbath as a yoke, but as a delight,
a joy, a benedictionâ the best and brightest j
day of the week. But with how many is the
Sunday insteaa of the best day the worst day?
I know it is said tnat the civilization ofthe
nineteenth century requires that Sunday ob
servance should be relaxed.
For reply I point to Toronto, which has
grown faster in the last twenty years than any
other American city, save Chicago, and there
are no Sunday mails, Sunday saloons, Sunday '
cars, Sunday sports or Sunday papers there.
The fact is the Sunday bicycle, the Sunday
bout and train and Sunday amusements are
the index and the source of a corruption of
morals, a depraved taste and au irreverence
for sacred things that must fill every thought
ful mind with alarm and with foreboding.
Reverence for God's day. and by the same
token for all things sacred and holy, is drop
ping out of our young California life, and if the
present tendency continues the Native Sons
and Daughters who hear me will live to see
the fine gold of the Golden West become dim
and her luster fade.
As to the bicycle I believe in it and I believe
in it on Sunday. I think every church ought
to nave its bicycle stall; for it is better to "ride
afoot," as the Indian characterized wheeling,
than to walk aioot. But all SundÃy pleasure
riding comes under the ban of God's word
against seeking our pleasure on his holy day.
It is the shame of California that our wheel
men in their associated capacity have seceded
from the National League of Wheelmen be
cause that noble body forbids Sunday racing.
I continued, "and it would not
have been tolerated anywhere else
in the world except at a
Woman** Congress. Had he attempted
todo anything of the kind at the Pure
Food Congress or any meeting composed
of men he would have been uncere
moniously thrown out into the
street on his head. By a spe
cial dispensation of our rules we
permitted' this Hindoo to speak after Mrs.
Gardener had read her very excellent pa
per on 'Heredity.' The time allotted for
these discussions is ten minutes for every
body, the average rule being that each
person consume about three minutes. But
what did this man do? Why, he talked
for thirty minutes, and such a tirade of

abuse I never heard before. But we sat it
out, and I am in a position to say that not
one word of insult or discourtesy was of
fered him.
"Did anybody jerk bis robe? I say no;
emphatically no. The Brahmacharin stood
right by my side all the time he was speak
ing and could have readily seen anybody
who came near bim. and nobody did. It is
barely possible that some of the ladies in
passing to and tro on the platform might
have brushed against him with their
skirts, but I doubt even that.
"I know that nobody pulled his coat
tails. If any insults were handed ont he
was the donor. He insulted everybody in
the congress. If he attempts to attend
! our meeting to-night he will be thrown
out"
But tbe Brahmacharin did not attend
the meeting last night, so there was no
opportunity to see Mrs. Swift's threat
carried out.
The Brahmacharin Preaches.
The Brabmacharin Bodarhasksbu de
livered an elegant address to a large au
dience at Native Sons' Hall last night. It
was given under the auspices of tbe Theo
sophical Society, and Secretary W. J.
Walters introduced the speaker.
His subject was "Religion as a Synonym
for Education," ana this lecture was pre
viously billed to be delivered at the
Woman's Congress, but owing to a mis
understaning which the Indian savant
had with some of the members of the con
gress on Saturday, he refused to carry out
that part of the programme.
In "the address last night not the re
motest reference was made to the quarrel.
In his talk the Brahmacharin explained
that the true aim of education was the de
velopment of the divine, which lies latent
in all men, and that this is accomplished
through many reincarnations.
SALVATIONISTS IN EIOT.
Bedlam Broke JLoone in the Merchant-
Street Hall Last Evening.
The gentle religious sentiment which
usually permeates the souls of the Salva
tionists who nightly wage war against sin
in a neat little hall at 639 Merchant street,
was rudely suspended last evening by a
lust for retribution for a wrong heaped
upon them by three intoxicated frequent
ers of the water front.
As a result the room of worship was
transformed into a den of irreligious riot
and its floor and tidy benches were spat
tered with the blood of half-frenzied com
batants.
The fight lasted for over ten minutes.
Benjamin Johannie was the leader of
the rioters, the Salvationists say. He re
fused to leave the building when it wai
time to close and concentrated his force***,
consisting of two muscular sailors, and
the fight began. j
There were twenty Salvationists in the j
room, and they proceeded to batter the in
stigators of the fight into submission.
It was a hard task. Man after man
went down under the powerful blows of
the sailors, who for some time remained
untouched.
Johannie's cheek was finally laid open
to the bone by Olaf Olafson. a friend of
the Salvationists, and he went reeling
into the street in a semi-conscious condi
tion.
A police whistle was blown, but it only
served to get the innocent into trouble. -
Jerry McGowan, an interested onlooker,
was: sent stumbling into the street by a
B wine from a policeman's club, and Axel
Schold, a man-o'-warsman, who was at
tracted to the scene , by the wail of strife,
was arrested for bein**-- drunk. In the
meantime the rioters, excepting Johan
nie, made their escape and the Salvation
ists retired to dress their wounds.
