SAN FRANCISCO
WANTS A NEW
POSTOFFICE
Supervising Architect Aiken
Declares That the Begin

Yet Afar Off.

Local Bodies Will Insist Upon
Work Being Begun at Once*
San Francisco wants its new Postoffice. That point at whicr
patience ceases to be a virtue has been reached. If there is any means
of overcoming Governmental inertia without breaking the laws or the
windows at Washington the time has come to employ it. SAN FRAN'
CISCO WANTS HER POSTOFFICE BUILDING! She wants ii
badly. She needs it. Her business interests demand it, and by the
Eternal and the right that is vested in the Â£100,000,000 that she" has
raid into the treasury at Washington within the past fourteen years,
lected from her customs dues, she must see an end to the inefficient
and the paltering that withholds it from her.
It is time that this big City learned just what is the cause of the
delay ; why the lagging years move past and see no change in thai
it at Mission and Seventh streets known to the wondering genera
of youngsters that have grown up about there as the Postoffice
site. Who is it that stands in the way ? Or is it merely a lack of
interest in Washington ? Whatever the reason be it should be dis
covered and done away with. Construction of the new Postoffice
building should be begun at once.
For seven years there has been lying in the United States treasury
the sum of Â§210,000 to the credit of the new Federal building. It is
â¢ available for immediate use, say the Commissioners, in the construc
tion of the building. The site was chosen and paid for four years ago.
And there the business stopped. Some drawings of plans were sent
out here early last year. They are said to have been approved, with
some modifications, and finally adopted. November lof last year was
fixed as the date upon which the strange spell was to be brokenâ work
was to be commenced.
The patient people of San Francisco saw the day go by and the
high fence around the Postoffice site remained fixed and unmoved.
November has been followed by December and January and February',
and still the supervising architect has made no sign.
THE Call yesterday telegraphed to its correspondent in Washing
ton to put the question to Mr. Aiken "Why?" and the amazing reply
comes back that "the beginning of work seems as far distant as ever;
that the engineers, after all these years, have still "certain problems
to solve"; that they only reported on the site in "a general way,"
although over $1,000,000 was paid for the site upon their express
recommendations. He adds that the appropriation was not large enough
to complete the work, but thisâ seven years after the report was filedâ
is the first that we have heard of it. The tests of the site are to be
begun again, for, Mr. Aiken says, "until they are completed it will be
impossible for him to know what kind of a building to put upon the site."
Now, inasmuch as the tests were made and the report accepted,
and Mr. Aiken himself has offered proof of that fact in completed plans
of the building, which have been approved, his explanation of yesterday
must be taken as so much diplomatic lying. There must be some other
reason for the delay, and San Francisco ought to know what it is.
No other city in the country has been subjected to such slights at
the hands of the National Government. It is eight years since Con
gress made an appropriation of three millions for the construction of a
Federal building in this City, independent of the site. For the site,
$1,250,000 was appropriated. The site chosen cost $1,040,000, which
of the ready cash appropriated $210,000. This sum has been
'ing in the treasury ever since and is available for immediate use in
'instruction.
Now think of itâ with all these conditions, we have men dragging
a wagon about the street begging food for themselves and a thousand
others who suffer for nothing but lack of work ; the site chosen, the
plans agreed upon and the money in the treasury, while honest men
clamor and starve for want of work.
We must discover the mysterious cause of this delay. San Fran
cisco and the State must call upon her Senators and Representatives to
lose no time in making the discovery and then removing every obstacle
to the inception and completion of this work. The Board of Super
visors will appeal to them as a body and will ask the Legislature to do
the same. The Manufacturers' and Producers' Association, Chamber
of Commerce, the City and State Boards of Trade, the Merchants'
Association and every other body identified with the business interests
of the City should be heard in the matter, so that this disappointing
pause in the matter of the Federal building may be brought to an end
We want the building and the unemployed want the work.
â¢ The present Postoffice and Federal building cannot be matched in
this country as dismal, antiquated ruins. The time to begin the work
<Â»r a speedy reform is now.

J WASHINGTON*. D. C. Feb. 24.â The
prospect for beginning actual construc
tion of the new San Francisco Postcffice
building seems more remote than ever.

tect, Mr. Aiken, that bids for the excava

It will be remeirhe ed that the engi
neers reported nearly two years ago that
their examination of the site hhowed that
it was firm enough to support such a
structure as it was proposed to erect at
Seventh and Mission streets. It was sup
posed that this report settled the matter
of foundation, and that there would be no
further reason offered for delay in com
mencing construction. The supervising
architect afterward stated that although
the engineers had ascertained thÂ« founda
tion to be substantial enough, there were
"certain engineering problems" to be

solved before actual construction could
commence. "We must determine the
weight that can be supported by the
foundation beore we can decide what
sort of a building to erect," said
Mr. Aiken. Several days ago The
Call correspondent was informed by
a Treasury Department official that
those engineering problems bad been set
tled and work would soon commence. But
when a representative of The Call inter
viewed the supervising architect to-day
he was informed tnat work could not pro
ceed until the tests of the Seventh and
Mission streets foundation were com
pleted.
"But did the board of engineers not
complete its labors and make its report
nearly two years ago? " asked the corre
spondent, and Mr. Aiken replied:
"They made a general rAport to the ef
fect that the site was all right as a whole,
but that certain parts of it was not firm
enough and piling would be necessary.
They did not make a detailed report,
however. It is necessary for our draughts
men to have before them the most careful
computations before the plans of a public
building could be determined on. We must
know the weight that can be supported by
each part of the lot."
"But why didn't the engineers finish
this examination and make the computa

â¢ JAMES D. PWELAM. MAYOR.
,<Â§*fe^Â£^f|Â£i^ Sam Francisco. CÂ«.. P^bruary 24, 2897.
To the Editor of "The Call"â Dear Sir: I agree with your con-
tention that the delay in erecting the Postoff ice is unpardonable
and inexcusable. On account of the large business done by San
Francisco through the Postoffice, and the inadequate facilities
which we now possess, there is no reason why . the Government should
hesitate. The lot is and has been ready for several years. Not
only the Postoffice, but the Federal judiciary and other Federal
officers should be rescued from the dismal quarters in which they
are now located. San Francisco has contributed in customs dues
alone over P100,000,000 in the last fourteen years to the Federal
Government and is entitled to some consideration. If the work were
begun forthwith it would give employment to our people, which is no
small matter, in view of the times and the constant drain which the
Federal Government makes upon our resources. Respectfully,
given us his opinion, however, that the
engineers may defray their expenses out
of the general appropriation made for the
San Francisco building. We expect that
the examinacion of the lot will be resumed
immediately."
"Will new borings be made?"
"I don't know that they will be neces
sary," said Mr. Aiken, "but some of the
tests already commenced will be com
pleted."
"Will engineers be sent from Washing
' ton to Sun Francisco to make the exanii
j nation?"
"No, I think not," said the supervising
! architect, "'for there are now War Depart
ment engineers in California who will
probably bi called upon to do the work."
"Will there be any change in the design
of the building other than diminishing
the height of the towers," asked The Call
correspondent.
"Not many changes. The lower part of
the building will be ornamented and em
bellished a little more. The towers will
not be diminished to one half of their
present height as has been reported. The
plain part of the towers will be de
creased eighteen or twenty feet, but
the ensemble of the building will
remain the same as printed in The
Call. We are aware, of course, that
many criticisms of the building have been
made in California, and especially
by the San Francisco newspapers,
bet the the design meets with the
approval of architects. I submitted ten
designs of public buildings to architects in
Baltimore and New Yort a short time ago, â¢
and almost without exception they agreed â 
that the San Francisco 'buiiding design i
excelled any of the 'others. They pro- j
nounced it as: lendid desi-n. I feel sure
that the San Franciscans will approve of |
the building after it is erected. As for the :
interior arrangement, I shall have a talk j
with Judge McKenna when he comes to j
Washington to take his place in the new j
Cabinet. I shall consult him especially !
about the arrangement of courtrooms, as j
I have asked Judge Morrow and Postmas
ter McCoppin."
"Will you give to the press photographs
of the modified building?'
"No more pictures will be given out, for '
the modifications in the design will no' be \
great enough to make much change in the '
general appearance of the structure. The ;
supervising architect's office has been i
rushed with work, but we now hope io j
proceed a little faster, as we have secured I
an additional appropriation oi 5210,000,
which will enable us to employ more men. ;
It is my wish to push ahead the work on j
the San Francisco. I'ortland and Denver !
buildings as rapidly as possible, but I \
don't thinK it probable that the excava- j
tions for the foundation of the San Fran
cisco building can be commenced before |
midsummer of the present year."
|| Judge Maguire said to The Call cor- j
respondent to-night: "I am satisfied that '
the Treasury Department has been for a i
long time determined not to commence j
the construction of the San Francisco Post
office during the present administration.
Of course, that determination has not been
openly announced. Delays have been ex
cused on various grounds, such as the de
termination of Mr. Aiken to adopi a dif
ferent style of architecture from that of
O Rourke ; second, changes in the portions
of the building intended for the Federal
courts and tneii officers, and lastly, the
failure of the commission of army engi
neers detailed for the examination of the
foundation to make their report to the
Secretary.
'â¢Senators White and Perkins, Mr. Loud
arÂ»a myself and other members of the del
egation have repeatedly urged the com
mencement and speedy prosecution of
construction. We were at last met with
the statement that the engineers had ex
hausted the $3000 appropriated for the
examination of tne lot; that their exami
nation was not either complete or satis
factory, nnd that they could not make the
requisite report. We then sought to have
the necessary funds provided in the gen
eral appropriation bill, but before that
was accomplished and within the last few
days the department has decided to use
for that purpose so much of the appronri
ation made two years ago for construction
as may be necessary. I presume the en
gineers will immediately proceed to com
plete their examination and make their
report, but of course the report must be
made to the new Secretary of the Treas
ury. It is true that the department could
not proceed with the construction under
the law until the engineers had made a
full report on the foundation, but the Sec
retary's course in preventing the com
mencement of work on other public build
iiius throughout the country seems to
indicate a studied purpose to delay all
such work, including the San Francisco
Postoffice.
"Two years ago Mr. Carlisle was strongly
disposed to commence the construction of
the San Francisco Postoffice and told me
if I could secure an appropriation of
$50,000 in addition to $135,000 then on
hand with the right to make contracts for
construction payable in future years he
could proceed almost immediately to
bniid. That information was telegraphed
to San Francisco. One week later Secre
tary Carlisle drew from his desk a letter
containing clippings from two San Fran
cisco papers in which the site was posi
tively declared in one of them to be a bog
and in ihe other a swamp. One heading
read : "To build on the bog at last Mr.
Carlisle then positively declared that he
would not take the responsibility of build
ing on the site until it had been exam
ined and reported upon by competent en
gineers,saying that the Chicago Postoffice
experience must not be repeated. The
provision lor the examination by army
engineers was then put in the appropria
tion bill, and the report has not yet been
made."
Representative Loud said:
"I do not know the reason for delay,
but I think my colleague, Judge Maguire,
is right in his surmise that the Treasury
Department is procrastinating and is not
really anxious to pay money out of the
Treasury. I realize that it is hopeless to
attempt to get the present administration

WASHINGTON. D. C. Feb. 24. âIn
the Senate to-day, Allen (Pop.) of Ne
braska offerred tbe following resolution,
and asfced for its immediate considera
tion:
Bttolved, That It is the sense of the Senate
that the President should speedily and effect
ually protect the lives and liberties ot peace
able American citizens residing or sojourniug
in Cuba, and that he should promptly insist
that Spain in her war against her colonists on
the island should conduct the same on princi
ples of civilized warfare, eliminating all un
usual and unnecessary cruelty and barbarity;
and for the enforcement of the reasonable a id
just requirements United States battle-ships
should be sent without delay to Cuban waters.
Objection to the immediate considera
tion of the resolution was made by Sena
tors Gray (D.) of Delaware and Quay (R.)
of Pennsylvania and it went over until to
morrow.
Hill (D.) of New York offered another
resolution and it was agreed to without
objection. It was as follows:
Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and
he hereby is requested to transmit to the Sen
ate, either in open or secret session, as he may
prefer, all the correspondence and reports ol
the Consul-General of tne United States at Ha
vana relating to ail American citizens now in
prison in the Island of Cuba, not preyiously
reported on.
The third and most important proposi
tion on the subject ol the war in Cuba was
presented by Morgan (D.) of Alabama,
who said that he had been instructed by
the' Committee on Foreign Relations to
report a joint resolution "demanding the
release of Julio Sanguilly, an American
imprisoned in Cuba." As it was in bis
his own handwriting he read it to the
Senate, as follows:
Resolved, by the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, that i he Government of the United
States demands the immediate and uncondi
tional release of Julio Sanguilly, a citizen of
the United States, imprisoned under charges
pending s gainsc him in ihe military and civil
courts of Cuba on alleged charges of rebellion
and kidnaping, contrary to the treaty rights
of each of the said Governments and in viola
tion of the law of nations. And the President
of the United States is requested to communi
cate this resolution to the Government of
Spain, and to demand of that Government
such compensation as he shall deem just /or
the imprisonment and sufferings oi Julio
Sanguilly.
"The committee thought," Mr. Morgan
continued, "hat it was its duty to request
the eariiest action on this joint resolution,
and inasmuch as some members of the
committee were absent at tne time, the
resolution was ordered to be reported. I
gift notice and call the attention of the
chairman of the Corcmittee on Foreign
Relations to it, that I will move to-morrow
morning to take up the joint resolution
for action."
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, said: "The
resolution was agreed to unanimously by
the committee. I have no objection what
ever to letting it go over until to-morrow,
and I hope that the Senate will then act
upon it."
The joint resolution accordingly went
over until to-morrow.
CRITICAL 81 UATIUX AT HAVANA.
Wildest Humor* afloat and War With
Thin Country Expected.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.-A dis
patch to the Herald from Havana via
Key West says:
The situation here is critical. Every
soldier and every camp in Havana knows
of the threatened breaking off of relations
between the United States and Spain, and
they are preparing for it. The work upon
defenses is being pushed with great en
ergy, and it is rumored every five minutes
of the day that General Lee has received
his passports and that war is declared.
The position of our citizens is most crit
ical. The rumor, whether true or false,
has gone abroad that the American Gov
ernment would not intervene, that Amer
icans can be murdered with perfect im
punity so long as the trade interests of the
country are not interfered with. Unless
something firm and decisive and strongly
American is done by our Government in
Washington, Americans are in great dan
ger of their live?.
The murder of Ruiz and the demand for
the release of Scott are the sole topics of
conversation. The amusement and the
great hilarity which were to be observed
at the palace Tue3Jay have changed.
Minister de Lome has cabled the Captain-
Genera! that Lee will not be recalled, that
bis resignation is not accepted and that he
may be sustained. .
General Lee views the question from a
calm, dispassionate standpoint, and lie
authorizes me to express the hope that
the situation created by the murder of
Ruiz and his own determination not to
submit to another similar atrocity should
not be exploited by partisan advocatei a!2
any particular policy toward the island of
Cuba.
The issue he think 3is clear. It is
whether law-abiding American citizens
residing abroad are to be protected or
whether we are to serve notice that tbey
can be murdered and tortured with im
punity.
â¢ For many months past General Lee has
satisfied himseli ana placed overwhelming
facts before our Government that not a
single provision of treaty rights is being
observed by the authorities of the island.
These incidents have been suppressed as
they occurred by the executive branch of
our Government, and General Lee could
do no more than fulfill his duty, which
' was to place the fads before the responsi
ble department of our Government.
Not a single one of these violations of
treaty rights, not to speak of the humane
laws which bind us all, has ever elicited
from the State Department a sign of life
or even acknowledgment that it had been
received.
This was the situation when the murder
of Dr. Ruiz took place. In tne case of
Ruiz General Lee had notified the de
partment that no charge had been
brought against the man within twenty
four hours afier his arrest, as the law re
quires, and he further notified the de
, partment that Ruiz was being kept in
communicado for a lougcr period than the
' Spanish code allows.
He took the same steps in the case of
Scott, and in every incident, step by step,
has pointed out the illegalities that have
characterized each and every proceeding
of the Spanish authorities here in their
treatment of American citizens.
These cablegrams have never been
answered one way or the other. Urgent
inquiries addressed to the department
asking for the opinion of the proper law
. officer of the Government upon the legal
questions of the cases as they arose have
never been noticed, until the conclusion
was forced upon General Lac that
in fulfilline his oath of office to protect the
lives and property of American citizens in
this, terror-stricken country, be would
have to rely only on his own resources,
and the respect and confidence of his fel
low-citizens.
At this juncture the Ruiz murder, which
he had foreseen, and of which he had fore
warned the Secretary of State, took place
General Lee investigated the terrible facts,
of this tragedy and without delay cabled
the department. For three days He re
ceived no reply.
General T/ee immediately decided to act
* as his sense of duty and responsibility
dictated and as his conscience told him
was right. He demanded the release of
Scott from the illegal restraint he was
suffering.
â¢He informed the department of the de
mand he had made. Ho told the Wash
ington authorities of the gravity of the
situation. He asked them to act promptly
to avert bloodshed and incalculable losses.
He asked that the warships might be
sent to Havana to sustain bio just de
mands and he concluded by saying:
"I will not and I cannot stand another
Ruiz murder."
He wrote that a week ago and he has
repeated it twice since by cable and by
letter.
Since Sunday night last both his
resignation and sequest for removal have
been in the hands of the State Depart
ment at Washington, and President
Cleveland has failed to accent the resigna
tion or order his removal.
General Lee has stated publicly his plat
form. He will not and he cannot have
another Ruiz murder. Ho cannot and
will not accept any share of the bloi-d
--guiltiness that will fall upon the American
Consul-General here who stands by and
raises not a finger to prevent the perpe
tration of such atrocities.

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.â The Ha
vana correspondent of the Times, writing
under date of February 20, says:
General Lee to-day, in discussing his
course in connection with the arrest of
Americans, said :
"I am und'T orders from Washington,
and I must obey irstructions from head
quarters. The department authorizes me
to act a certain way, and I but carry out
my order*.
"I came here unprejudiced and deter

directly under my observation.
"From the moment I landed, my
American blood began to boil and if I stay
here much longer and am forced to wit
ness the indignities heaped upon my
countrymen without cause, it will liter
ally boii away. They trample on our flag
and hiss us on the streets.
"Americans are murdered and impris
oned, indignities are heaped upon our
women and every atrocity conceivable for
a Spaniard to put on Americans is thrust
upon us."

THE TOBACCO TRUST.
In the Nay York Investigation It Is Testi
fied That the Cigarette Output Has
Nearly Doubled.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24â There
was a larire attendance of spectators thia
morning when tne joint legislative com
mittee resumed its investigation of trusts,
monopolies, etc. On calling the commit
teo to order Chairman Lexow said the
coal trust would be taken up to-morrow.
President Dnke of the American Tobac
co Company again took the stand. He
said the American Tobacco Company was
capitalized original.)- at $25,000,000, which
wa* aiterward increased io $29,835,000. I
Approximately the Duke Company and j
Allen & Ototer received $7,600,000. Kinm-y '
& Co., Kiniball & Co. and the Goodwin ,
Company $2,500,000, the Duke Company j
receiving $t>,000,000 for good will, such as |
patent.* and trademarks.
About $5,000,000 worth of *tock was j
issued for l;v*Â» assets of the various com- I
panics and ?20.000,000 for the good will, \
trademarks and patents. The witness |
said when tne *tock was increased to $29,
--835,000 there were about forty stockhold
ers; now there were between two and
three thousand.
He denied ttiat his company had secured
control of all the cigarette-making ma
chineb by combining with the other com
panies, lie said that prior to consolida
tion the live original companies employed
5895 hands, and in February, 1896. the
American Tobacco Company had99l4eni
ployes.
In reply to another question the wkness
9aid that common stock in 1894 paid 12
pÂ«r cent, In lÃ'.^sit paid nothing, and in
1896 it paid 9 per cent in caÂ«h, and there
was also a surpins of $1,400,000. Tue wit
ness attributed the decline in the price of
the stock from 177 to 63 to unloading. He
said thai be had more of the stock now
than ever before. He declared that the
output in ciqaretus had almost doubled
since the consolidation.
Josiah Brown of Bpringfield, N. J., sec
retary of the American Tobacco Company,
was then culled, but his testimony was un
imnortant.
Francis B. Thurber of the American
Fubiisnine Company took the stand and
read a long statement concerning the his
tory of the trusts. Mr. Thurber said the
total result of the combinations intelli
gently administered were beneficial to (he
public at largo and to the laboring class.
He said there good trusts and bad trusts,
but the good ones predominated.
George B. Wheeler, a wholesale cigar
dealer from Svracu-t. the next witness,
testified that the American Tooacco Com
pany's factory agreement had wrought
him injustice in the fact that it refused to
sell him goods because he re! used to buy
exclusively from it. The jobber, be de
clared, could not do business without the
factory's agreement. The witness denied
that he was under salary with the Na
tional Cigarette Company, a competing
firm.
Counsel for the American Tobacco Com- |
pany, who was present, at this point de- I
dared that the witness was simpiy the
mouthpiece of the National Cigarette

SACRAMENTO. Cal,, Feb. 24.â At 2
o'clock this afternoon Foreman Rogers of
the State Printing Office notified the
bookbinders, typesetierd and oiher em
ployes that as the pressmen had walked
out and refused to work any longer be
cause they had been kept six weeks with
out pay, the office would be snut aown.
I: was apparent to all the employes thr,t
there was no need of setting up type
merely to tie it up with string aud let it
lie on the stones, and there was no mur
muring because of the action of the fore
man.
None of the employes had received a
dollar of pay during the past six weeks
and they were about tired of working for
nothing. Rent and butchers' bills were
accumulating and it was not very pleasant
for employes of the State to be forced to
have their warrants shaved by money
brokers while there was plenty of money
lying idle in the State treasury. Printers,
bookbinders, etc., are not allowed by the
rules of their unions to work for an em
ployer who has contracted the incon
venient habit of skipping pay days, and
they do not see w:.y the State, which is
well able to pay them, should be made an
exception to the ruie.
Foreman Ropers, bat in hand, made a
speech to the tifty and odd girls in tlie
bindery. He explained that the presa
nien had refused to worlc longer without
pay; that their action had blocked the
wheels in all the departments, and that
therefore all hands wouid have to be
laid off.
"Republicans and Democrats in the
Slate Capitol have been c'oinj; politics at
our expense," said Mr. Rogers, "aud we
have been Kept out of our money. You
must not understand this to be a strike.
The pressmen have refused to work, and
that, naturally, stops til work in the in
stitution. They have refused to go to
work until they shall be paid what is due
them by the State."
The pressmen went to work ibis morn
ing with the rest of the 300 employes, and
I at 8 o'clock, alter the journals of the
I Senate and Assembly and tne day's files
had been run through the presses they
put on their coats and walsed out. At
half past 12 o'clock they held a meeting in
Federated Trades faall and appointed the
j following committee, J. J. C. Fitzgerald,
| A. J. Galligan and EJ E.Hart, to wait
upon the State Board of Examiner* and
lay their case before tbat august body.
Another committee consisting of John R.
Welch, W. M. Thomas and John L. Hav
erlan, was detailed to notify sister unions
of the pressmen's strike.
The first-named committee ascertained
that Governor Budd and Attorney-Gen
eral Fitzgerald were in San Francisco, and
would not return until to-night. It in
terviewed Secretary of State Brown,
who assured them that he would cheer
fully sign any claim that they might make
for the wages due them.
H. H. Watts of Ban Francisco, district
organizer of tne International Typograph
ical Union, arrived on the 11:20 train to
day, but he found that his services were
not needed. The pressmen's union does
not worfc under a charier from the typo
graphical union, and he had no authority
to advise the strikers. The printers were
simply laid off, and Mr. Watts had noth
ing to settle in hi* official capacity.
Stale Printer Johnston informed n. Call
corre pondent that he had requested the
pressmen to remain at work until after
the meeting of the State Board of Exam
j iners to-morrow, but that they decided to
Igo out to-day. They thought that they
had remained in the office too long. Up
to date, including all claims, there is be
tween $38,000 and $40,000 due the office.
The Examiner of yesterday morning
contained an article charging that wbile
Johnston had used only a little more
stock and material than his predecessor,
Captain Young, his bills were much
larger in proportion to the quantity of
j material used up. Mr. Johnston, in reply,
i says that Captain Young did printing for
only forty different rublic institutions,
while Johnston does the printing lor
Sixty-one* Another important item, he
says, is the fact that the price of stock in
about one-tbtrd of what it was eight and
ten years a^o, and this fact will do away
with any apparent discrepancy on that
score. The State Printing Office now does
all the engrossing and enrolling of bills,
which work under Captain Yoang's ad
nnnisiration was done by clerks in the
Capitol. This work alone for the last
three sessions aggregated $ JO. 000 worth.
At 3:30 o'clock Mr. Johnston informed
the Assembly that Assembly bills Nos.
308. 122, 278, 8-5, 427. 440, 504. 310, 62, 653,
311, 297, 307, 281, 229, 312 and 174 could not
be engrossed because of the strike of the
pressmen.
When Governor Budd and Attorney-
General Fitzgerald arrived to-night they
were met by a deputation of pressmen,
who asked whether the two officials could
give them any direct assurance that their
wages would be paid. An answer was re
turned to the effect that the Board of Ex
eminers would approve of the payroll, and
with this assurance the pressmen seemed
to be satisfied. The State Printer himself
appealed to the men to-night not to ham
per the work of the Legislature, and the
result was that the pressmen agreed to go
to work to-morrow moraing on the jour
nals, the tiles and other necessary prfn ting
for the Legislature. As many compositors,
binders, etc., as may be necessary for this
work will be put on also.
The $40,000 which tbe Governor proposes
to allow, shouid the Legislature to-mor
row pas* such a bill, will pay the expenses
of the office up to Saturday night. As the
payroll alone aggregates nearly $6000 per
week, it is plain that all or nearly all the
employes would have to go home unpaid
next Saturday night, should the whole
force bÂ» put on.

projiriatiun for the Oflicr,
SACRAMENTO, CaiÂ», Feb. 24âGov
ernor Budd and Attorney-General Fitzger
ald arrived from Ban Francisco this even
ing and met at 9 o'clock with Secretary of
State Brown as tbe State Board of Exam
iners.
Messrs. Brown and Fitzgerald asked that
the State Pr.nter might be alloy/ed |75,000
to do tbe legislative printing for the re
mainder of the tisoal year, and to pay toe
claims already due, amounting next Sat
urday evening to about $45,000.
Governor Bndd said that be would re
fuse to sign any bill calling for more than
$40,000 lor legislative printing. The mat
ter of appropriating $35,000 additional
woula be taken up afterward, he Mid,
The constitution would not permit the
creation of a deficiency unless by unani
mous vote of the Board of Examiners.
The Legislature had power to provide for
iisownle islative printing. The Governor
thereupon introduced a resolution recom
mending that the Legislature make a pres
ent appropriation of $40,000 for legislative
printing.
The Attorney-General suggested that
the appropriation should be for $75,000,
sufficient to pay off the indebtedness of
the u fiice and run it until the end of (he
term, but tbe Governor thought that $40,
--000 was ample for legislative prinune
Secretary of State Brown, who was the
first to vote on the rollcall, voted "aye"
on the resolution. The Attorney-General
voted "no" and before tbe Governor's vote
aye could be recorded Brown remarked
tnat he thought that the vote was to be
unanimous, but if Judge Fitzgerald was
going to vote "no" he did not care about
voting at all.
"Suppose we make it $65,000," ha sug
gested. 6
â¢I think $40,000 is enough," said the
Governor.
Mr. Brown was considerably worked up
and made a remark to the effect that the
btate of California should not repudiate
its just debts, to which the Governor re
torted severely that the State of California
bad never repudiated its just debts.
"That may be true," replied Mr. Brown,
"bat I notice that it has done so on mere
technicalities."
"Don't you think," suggested the At
torney-General, "that in order to save
time, trouble and expensa to tue Legisla
ture it would be better to recommend an
â  mount sufficient to carry the office until
the adjournment of the Legislature?"
The Governor sÂ«aid that he woulU neither
recommend nor sign a bill for more than
$40,000.
"It's no use to prolong this contro
versy," said Mr. Brown, taking his hat
and walking toward the door. "The Gov
ernor say* he won't sign for any more
than $40,000. and I'm going home."
"Record Mr. Brown as voting 4 aye' on
the resolution," said the Governor to Sec
retary Markley, "and I vote 'aye; 1 Gen
eral Fitzgerald votes 'no.' "
"No, I don't vote 'no,'" said the Attor
ney-General. "J don't wish to make any
recommendation whatever to the Legis
lature."
Governor Budd inquired of Assembly
man Leavitt whether he would recom
mend to tbe As-fimbly to-morrow the
passage of the $40,000 bill.
"No, sir," replied Leavitt; "you can ask
Mr. Stianahan to do that."
"Ob, tben you are making a matter of
politics out of this," said the Governor.
"No," replied Mr. Leavitt. "I believe
that the State Printing Office requires
$ 75, 000. and 1 don't want to recommend
any smaller amount."
Thwn Mr. Leav.tt, a little white about
the jti'ls, went out of the room.
The Governor announced that the board
would meet at 10 o'clock to-morrow to
investigate the $-35,000 bill.

SENATE SESSION
FULL OF INTEREST
Heated Discussion of the
Indian Appropriation
Bill.
Two Temporary Presiding O-'fi
cers Receive Rebuffs From
Angry Senators.
Pettigrew of Scuta Dakota Eitt rly
Scored by Hoar of M ssa
chuietts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.â The
proceedings in the Senate were full of
interest from the opening to the closing.
No less than three propositions were
made in relation to Cuba â one by Senator
Alien (P.) of Nebraska, one by Senator
Hill (D.) of New York, ana one by Sen
ator Morgan (D.) of Alabama as the
unanimous report of ttie Committee on
Fcreipn Relations. It is in the form of a
joint resolution demanding the immedi
ate and unconditional release of Julio
Sanguilly, and compensation from the
Government of Spain for his imprison
ment mid sufferings. Morgan was backed
by the chairnif.n of the Foreign Relations
Committee, ar.d stated thai action on the
resolution wouid be asked to-morrow.
The Indian appropriation bill was taken
up, and two or three of tho committee
amendments to it provoked long and
rather angry discussion.
Remarkably enough, two of the tem
porary occupants of the chair received
stinging rebuffs from Senators â first, Per
kins (R.) of California from Alllen (Pop.)
of Nebraska, and afterward Hill (D.) of
New York from Pettigrew (Sil.)of North
Dakota. But the scene which attracted
the most attention was one in which Pet
tigrew and Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts
were the chief actors.
Pettigrew had made an attack upon
Chandler's com raittee amendment as the
large claim on ths Western Cherokees for
illegal services rendered to the Cherokees
by attempting to turn into ridicule the
New England sympatuy for the Indians,
and recalling tue cruelties practiced in
King Philip's war and by Miles Standish.
Chandler retaliated by inquiring from
Pettigrew where he was born â a question
which Pettigrew declined to answer, and
concerning which his conflict with Sena
tor Hill (in the chair) took place.
Hoar alÂ«o indulged in some very scath
ing comments on Pettigrew, as one who
went "mousing" into ancestry to meet an
argument; as having studied more history
ior the purpose of his speech than he had
ever done before, and as belonging to the
species of Dirds which befoul their own
nests.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont withdrew the
notice which ue had given fora spe cii to
morrow on the Cuban question, his reason
being an unwillingness 10 occupy ths time
which should be given to appropriation
bills, and Allison (R.) of lowa, chairman
oi the Committee on Acpropriations, re
marked upon the backward condition of
the appropriation bills, and gave notice
thai irum to-morrow on late night ses
sions wuuld ba absolutely necessary.
At 11 a. m., which is to be the regular
hour of meeting for the rest of the session,
the Senate was called to order. House
bill to amend the postal lawÃ by providing
limited indemnity ($10) for loss of regis
tered mail matter was passed without
amendment. An effort was made by Dan
Nelson (R.) of Minnesota to have a time
fixed for taking the rote on the bank
runtcy bill, tut unanimous consent was
necessary and objection was made by sev
eral Senators.
Quay askel unanimous consent to take
up the Duiuih bridge bill, but objection
was made by Vilas (D. ) of Wisconsin and
a remonstrance was also made by Petti
grew (8.) of South Dakota, who unreJ the
necessity of proceeding with tho Inditn
appropriation bill. Thereupon the foimal
motion to take up the bridge bill wa<
made by Quay and was defeated â 17 to 29.
The Lnoian appropriation bill was taken
up, and Quay, under the range of debate,
renewed his proposition in relation to the
Dulntb bridge bill. A lively debate en
sued between Vilhs of Wisconsin and
Nelson of Minnesota. The bridge matter
tUt- u went over, and the consideration of
the Indian appropriation bill was pro
ceeded with.
A long discussion was carried on by
Senators Galltnger (R.) of New Hamp
shire, Allen (Pop.) ot Nebraska and Jones
(I) ) ot Arkansas, turning upon the ques
tion of overcharging tne Indians on
reservations for foods sold by Indian
traders. The conduct of Lieutenant-
Colonel Freeman in suppressing a news
paper published in tbe Osage Nation was
argued pro and con by the two last
namsd Senators, Allen taking the ground
that the action was despotic and illegal,
and Jones excusing it for the reason that
the newspaper in question had teen pub
lishing articles against the Indian
school-.
Tbe only incident worthy of notice oc
curred when the char was occupied by
Perkins (R.) of Caliornm. Allen had
been making a long speecn, when Gal
iinper, interrupting, address d the chair.
"Does the Senator from Nebraska yield
to the Senator from New Hampshire?"
asked the presiding officer,
"It is the Senator from New Hamp
shire," Galiint;er pat in, "who has yielded
to the Senator from Nebraska."
"How Jong does the Senator yield?" the
pre-iding officer asked, with an uumlstafc
ablf- toucb 01 sarcasm.
"I do not know," Allen broke in angrily.
"What concern is it of the presiding offi
cer how long the Senator yields? lam
not here to be badgered by the presiding
officer oi the Senate, and I hope it will
not occur again."
TThe presiding officer took no notice of
this angry outburst and Allen went on
with bis speech, which he closed with the
contemptuously uttered words: "With
my thanks to the chair for tbe courtesy
which I have received, I yield the floor."
The committee amendment for the pay
ment of $50,000 to t;je Pawnee tribe of In
dians out of their trust land money on de
Â£o31 1 in the treasury was agreed to â ayes
I. noes 16.
A long controversy arose over the old
question of attorneys' fees on the Western
Cnerotee trust funds to the amount of
$800,36!), the committee amendment pro
posing to confer jurisdiction of the subject
on the Court of Claims.
The amendment was severely criticized
by Chandler, who wai iesponded to by
Pettigrew (silver) of Soutn Dakota in
charge of the bill. HÂ«s -poKe of New
England's solicitude lor the poor Imlia-i
as a reversal ol what New England had
done in her early history against the
Indiana. The blot on the early history of
the Anglo-Saxon race, he asserted, was
the treatmentof the Indians by the people
of Massachusetts.
"Where was the Senator born?" Chan
dler asked in dersive tones.
"I judge from the Senator's manner,"
Pettigrew responded, "that he can answer
bis own question. It is therefore unneces
sary for me to inform him." (The C<>n
gressional Directory stives Pmiigrew's
birthplace as Ludlow, Vt.)
The presiding officer (Hill of New York)
remarked with mock gravity : "The Sena
tor from South Dakota declines to state
where he was born." [Great laughter].
Pettigrew (indignantly)â Tiie remark of
the chi<ir is of course voluntary on hi*
part and Is a little out of the order. Bu>k
as the Sonator from New York will not bff
long with us, we can endure almost any
thing from him. [Laughter]
The presding iliicor â The Senate will
have to endure the Senator from South
Dakota. [Laughter],
Pet'.igrew's sueecu was replied to by
Hoar, who spoke of it with a great show
of indignation as a "mousing into the
ancient history of New England, 1 ' and
sugge-led that the "per.-on who bad ju-t
spoken" had studied more history for is
speech than he hnd done in all his life
before. [Laughter.]
The treatment oi the Indians by Miles
Standisb, Hoar said, bad occurred
years ago, and yet that was the only argu
ment that the Senator from Soutn ihikota
had been able to make to oppose the at*
tack upon the amendment.
"I can only.' 1 Hoar added (facing Petti
grew and speaking with all the scorn ha
could lend to hi* language), "pity the man
who can find in history nothing t>ut toe
material for befouling the very nest in
which he was born."
Afier this stormy session no attempt
was made to get a vote on the amend
ment.
A conference report on the bill to amend
the act repealing the timber culture . a v.s
was presented and a reed to.
A disagreement of the conference on the
army appropriation bill was reported,
and a new conference was ordered.
The postoflice appropriation bill was re
ported and placed on the calendar.
Morriil (R.) of Vermont withdrew the
notice which he had given of his purpose
to address the Senate to-morrow on the
Cameron Cuban resolution, giving as Ihb
reason his unwillingness to interfere with
the appropriation bills and expressing a
whether they could all get through.

Governor's Palace Burned
and Incendiarism
Is Rife.
Last Vestige of the Turkish
Government's Machinery
Destroyed.
Queen Olga Pr. udiy Declines an Honor
Conf rrcd by tfce Russian
Government.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 24.â The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Canea giving a vivid description of
the burning of the Governor's palace there
to-day.
Vice-Adiral Canevare of the Italian
squadron, who is in command of the
united naval forces in Cretan waters, re
sided in the palace, which w#s guarded by
a strong force of Italian sailors. The
energetic efforts of the British ma
rines, who form a part of the
foreign force occupying the town,
and which were continued for three hour?,
alone saved the ihickly populated dis
tricts in which the palace was located
from destruction. Detachments of sailors
from the warships in the harbor were
landed, ami rendered valuable aid in
fighting the flames.
The fire destroyed the last vestice of the
machinery of tee Turkish Government.
All of the records were consumed as well
as contracts and financial, le^al and
municipal documents. While the
palace was burning the Moslem
rabble set fire to several houses
in tbe towns and suburbs. -The Monte
negrin police, who patrolled the town, ex
tinguished These fires when it was pos
sible for them to do so, but three large
houses beloncing to Christian merchants,
who were absent, were destroyed.
The Moslems are much excited, and
more incendiarism is expected. In the
event of the setting on rire of several
buildings in different sections at the same
time the force of sailors and marines now
in the town would be insufficient to cope
with the fires.
The representatives of the powers, it is
stated, wi 1 not attempt to fulfil! tiieir en
casements to preserve the safety of the
town. They will protect the Turks and
Turkish property, and will neglect the
Christians and their belongings.
No strong efforts were made to save the
three houses before mentioned, and in
view of this apathy it would not be sur
prising if the Moslems should Degin a
course of wholesale destruction of the
property of absentees.
A dispatch from Canea to a news agency
here says the situation in that town caases
much anxiety. The Mussulman populf.ce
are armed and gieatly excited. Turks
have been parading tne streets, exhibiting
their indignation i:i various ways.
Tiie situation at Selino, the disuatch
pay?, is serious. The Benghazi Arabs
threaten to burn the entire town. The
suggestion of the Consuls that a mixed
force be landed in order to allow taÂ«
besieged Moslems to retreat has not been
adopted, the foreign admirals having de
cided 10 confine their action to the send
ine of warships to exercise a moral in
fluence upon the contending parties,
whom it seems, however, there is little
hot>e of reconciling.
The Daily News will publish to-mor
row a dispatch from its correspond
ent at Vienna saying it is reported
that Olga of Greece, hav
ing been appointed an honorary admiral
of the Russian fleet, has returned the in
signia of tbe posiuon to St. Petersburg,
â¢deciannz that she is unable to hold the
rank since the Russian fleet has tired upon
Greek subjects and orthodox Chrisiians.
The Timss to-morrow will print a dis
patch from Constantinople saying that
Emperor William of Germany has again
wired to the Sultan assurances of his
friendship and support.
The Daily New? to-morrow will say that
the stÃiem s nt to be made in Parliament
by Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour regard
ing the Cretan situation are to the effect
that the powers b:ive aereed to Lord Salis
bury's proposal* iind have decided to lib
erate Crete from direct Turkish rule.
Tlie Standard to-morrow will publish
an Athens dis-ptrch Â«nyinjr it is stated
there upon authority that the Greek Gov
ernment rejects the proposals of ihe
powers to establish autonomy in Crete and
proposes 10 persevere iv the policy adopted
by King George. The dispatch also Â«<ays
th a the official report of the engagement
which took place outside of Canea last
Friday states mat 50 Greeks were killed
and 150 captured.
To-morrow the Times will nub ish a dis
patch from Canea confirming the report
of the dangerous situation which exists in
the town, owing to the lack of proper
control.
Tnere is a strong suspicion, the dis
patcii says, that the tire that destroyed
the Governor's palace was of incendiary
origin. Band* daily make excursions to
the Haiepa district for tbe. purpose of
looting the houses of Christians which
have been destroyed.
A report has been received from the
commander of the British warship lying
off Titia, at tlie eastern extremity of the
island of Crete, faying that the report of
a massacre of Moslems at that place is
utterly untrue
The Standard to-morrow will publish
a Constantinople dispatch saying* it
is reported that at the council
held at the Yildiz Palace yester
day it was decided Â»o make prepara
tions for the eventnal advance upon
Athens of three columns comprisinc six
divisions of infantry. A note to the Greek
Government would prfcede the advance,
demanding theevacuation of Crete within
certain period and threatening that if this
demand was not complied with that the
Ottoman troops would cross the frontier.
The dispatch also says that the Minister
of Marine hai pledged his word that he
would have thirteen warships ready ior
action within a week.
Wilitary preparationsjlare being pushed
with unparalleled activity. Reports from
various sources state that energetic prepa
rations are being carried on day and night,
although many of the instructions issued
are impossible of execution and an ugly
feeling of unrest prevail".

ATHENS, Grece. Feb. 24 âA dispatch
from Canea- says that during the fire in
the Governor's palace to-uay the Gover
nor's safe fell from the floor on which it
stood into the ruins and tnirst open. The
safe contained Â£7000 in Turkish money.
The soldiers who had gathered ahout
the burning building and were engaged in
trying to extinguish the flames, seeing
the contents of the safe exposed tried to
steal the money, but were prevented by the
European officer*, who directed the sailors
under their command to tire a volley of
blank cartridges at the would-be robbers.
The incident nearly caused a riot between
the Turks and Europeans.
lsmael Bey accused the sailors of plun
dering the palace and an investigation
was at once begun by the admirals of the
foreign ships. The inquiry proved that
the charges against the sailors were en
tirely without foundation.

CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 24.â Reports
to-nigbi from Pomeroy, Ironton and
Portt mouth are that all the business por
tions of these places are submerged, and
many families are sleeping in public balls,
schoolbouses and churches.
The Ohio River is still rising here at the
rate of two inches an hour, which has
been the rate for the twelve hours preced
ing 8 o'clock to-night, at which hour 58
feet 5 inches was the stage. Al
thouch the river is falling at Fimbure, it
will take until Friday or Saturday for the
crest of the rse to pass here under the
most favorable circumstances. The 63
--foot stage will be reached early to-morrow
morning. The chief signal service officer
predicts that the 60-foot stage will be
the limit. Other experienced men say
the water will go considerably higher than
that.
Merchants on East Front street who
would be driven out by sixty -two feet are
making no attempt to move their goods.
The gymnasium grounds, the baseball
park, the Ludlow Lagoon and Cooney
Island are all more or less under water.
The expensively constructed Gest-street
tunnel und bridge is being rapidly under
mined and is in great danger. All of the
railroads have now abandoned Union
Central Station and are using a tempor
ary depot at Eighth street. Forty families
applied at one charitable institution to
day for relief on account of the high water
driving them from home. Dayton and
Bellevue on the Kentucky side have been
cut off lrom streetcar connection at New
port, and travel is now by flat boat. The
western part of Newport is suffering
greatly.
The police reported at 8 o'clock to-night
that over 100 families had been driven
from their homes by the water, and that
j the GO- foot stage, expected by morning,
i would reach as many more. The police
| force of Newport is now largely occupied
I in patrolling the submerged districts in
! skiffs. Public halls an t churches may be
â  thrown open, but so far the sufferers have
j all beer, taken care of. At Riverside the
I Town Hall has been opened for flood suf

IN CHICAGO BOOKS
Thousands Won on Hunn's
Horse by the Ryan
Brothers.
Slate-Maker Arthur Webb Said
to Have Been Caught by
the "Killing"
Ondague's Victory at N w Orleans
Costs the Poolrooms a
Rcund Sum-
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 24.â A combina
tion of gamblers which has for weeks
been beating the poolrooms and hand
books made a winning to-day of about
130,000. The poolrooms that suffered
were: Arthur Webb's place, the
places of John Condon and James
O'Lsary at Eoby and Washington
Height! and the binall books which have
been doing a hand business abont town.
The winning combination was headed by
the Kyans, Tom and Ed, whose operations
have for the last year been directed
mainly against the Kentucky and (Jhio
tracks about Cincinnati.
Yesterday the combination camped with
all its money on Ferrier in the fourth race
at San Francisco, and on Ondague iti the
third race at New Orleans, and as a result
practically swept out ali the available coin
that remained in the hands of the pur
veyors of orders after their run of three
weeks of "tough luck."
Conservative sporting men about xown
place the estimate upon the amount won
by the combination at $30,000, of which
the Roby and Washington Heights books
lost neariy half, whiie Arthur Webb is
said to have suffered a third of the losses
with the remainder divided between the
recently opened book atElmhurst and the
hand books about town.
CLEVELAND'S PENSION POLICY.
In Vetoing the Bill to Pension Maria
Somer/at the President Defines
His Position.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.â 1n
sending to the Senate his veto of a bill to
pension Maria Somerlat, a remarried
widow of a volunteer soldier. President
Cleveland takes occasion to define and de
fend his pensioa policy as follows:
The rule governing the operation of general
pension laws which lorfeits a widow's pension
on her remarriage seems so reasonable and
just and its relaxation must necessarily lead
to such a departure from just principle* and
to such vexatious pension administration that
I am convinced it ought to be strictly main
tained.
1 hope I may be permitted to call the atten
tion of the Senate to the iucreasing latitude
clearly discernible in special pension license.
It has seemed to me so useless to attempt to
stem the tide of this legislation by executive
interference thnt I haveoontented myself with
non-acquUscence In numerous capes where I
could not approve.
Taere have been already presented to me
for executive action during the present ses
sion of Congress 2(>o pension biiis, of which I
have actually Â« xannned 115. The entire num
ber of such bills that have become laws during
the four sessions of Congress since March 4,
1893, is 391. Soirre < f ihese presented at the
extra session are not based upon the least pre
text that the death or disability involved is
related to army service, while in numerous

bear Knowing. Polite, cool, intelligent,
up-to-date and easy slaving. True, it is
not only in toe glide of the razor, the clip
of the scissors and the part of the hair that
San Francisco barbers excel â no, it is for
thosa delicate finishing touches, here and
there; it is the knowing how and when to
use hot, eld, lukewarm cloths, where to
part and how to part the hair, and, lastly,
to leave the customer the tree option of
tipping or not at his own sweet will. Yet,
hold, let me pausa to bring you into the
presence of one ol Frisco's gifted barbers.
You see his portrait above; his name is
George Jordan. He is well known and it
is well to know him, for he is the true type
of a "Sunset" barber. Yesterday I aid
chat with Mr. Jordan, and among other
things he spoke of the great good the
casos it is extremely difficult to satisfactorily
discover such relationship.
There is one featura of tnis legislation which
lam sure deserves attention. 1 refer to the
great number of special bi<ls passed for the
purpose of increasing the pension, of those al
ready on the rolls. Of the 115 special pen
sions which 1 have examined since the begin
ning of the present session of Congress fifty
eight granted or restored pensions and nfty
seveu increased those already existing. wLiie
me appropriation of money necessary co meet
these increases alone exceeds considerably
the amount required to pay the original pen
sions gran:ed or restored by the remaining
fifty-eight bills.
I can not discover that these increases are reg
ulated by any rule or principle and when we re
member there are nearly a million pensioners
on our rolls, aud the opportunity for such in
crease th.-it must follow these precedents al
ready made, the relation of the subject to a
justifiable increase of our National revenues
cannot escape attention.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.-Mr.
Bryan was a-ked to-nijsht to give his
opinion on the address issued by the Sil

"I believe that they are right In con
tinuing a separate organization as Silver
Republicans. They %vere among t; c most
effective supporters of bimetallism during
the campaign and since tbe election they
have stood unshaken and undismayed.
They do not consider themselves Demo
crats or Ponulists, and since they cannot
affiliate with the Republican party while
it stands for tho gold standard, they havo
wisely decided to complete an organiza
tion and hold their forces together.
"In accepting the nomination of the
National Silver party I stated that we did
not insist upon the Silver Republicans
becoming Democrats, but that we ac
cepted their support with the understand
ing that the same patriotism whicd di
rected them in 189*3 would be present to
direct them in 1900. The Democratic
party deserved their confidence in 1896
and I hope it will deserve their support in
the next campaign. Future events must
determine what is wise in 1903."

It began by calling upon Populists to

THE RULES.
R feree Siler Hits Upon a Scheme
That Will Prevent Threatened
Disagreements.
CARSOX, Nev, Feb. 24 âGeorge Siler.
the celebrated Chicago sportsman, who is
to act as referee of the world's champion
ship battle between Corbett and Fnzsim
moaa, went out to Cook's ranch this
â¢morning and put in several hours of earn
est and animated conversation with the
Cornishman. It was ail about Fitzsim
mons' recently developed and wholly
unexpected objection to that clause in the
Marquis of Queensberry rules which per
mits either or both of the contestants to
hit with a free arm in clinches and to put
in a punch if possible in the breakaway.
Piler did not mmcc words with Bob;
neither cid he essay to coerce him into
agreeing to fight under rules not to his
liking. What be did say was to call the
lanky pugilist's attention to the fact that,
having once agreed to let "everything
go" in the mill, it would look bad for him
to start in quibbiinc over technicalities at
this late stage of the g.nue. Siler said
that, Â«o far as lie was concerned, tie would
be willing to stand by any arrangement
the pugilists would agree upon, and he
would guarantee to decide the battle, if
necessary, upon the fulfillment or failure
to carry out that same agreement. What
he would insist upon would be an out-and
out understanding between the principals
and the referee before the trio entered the
ring. He wanted no room left for com
i laints or misconceptions of the rules
after the fight was over.
Fitzsimmons was s'.ubborn at first. Ha
even reiterated hiÂ» declaration of Tnesdny
afternoon that he would not fight if he
was compelled to adopt tactics he did not
â like. But as the conversation wore along
fie became more good-natured and finally
worked himself into a really reasonable
frame of mind.
"The point of the whole matter is just
this," said Fitzsimmons, finally. "I do
not intend to announce thus early in the
game just what methods 1 am going to
employ in the ring with tuis man Corbett.
It wouja be a pretty how-do-you-do for
rue to notify him in advance aa to whether
or not I aui going to hit in the clinches,
or break away fair and square.
"That would give him an opportunuv
to devote ail of his practicing hours to
discovering a means for counteracting my
assaults. No, I Bay, let all this go until
we step into the ring. It will then be time
enough to announce what rules shall gov
ern us, and neither of us will have any
advantage over the other, ls not that
fair enough ? Ido not want to be accused
cf quibbling over trifles nor of showing
any sign of the white feather, but I want
a square deal and propose to have it.
Mv entire professional future depends
upon the resuit of this fight, and I don't
pn p":se to agree to anythine governing
the conduct of the contest which is apt
to put me to a disadvantage. That's all
there is to it.'
Siler evolved a theory to-nieht which be
assured me he thought woyjd solve the
whole difficulty and probably send the
men into the ring together on St Patrick's
day on comparatively amicable terms. At
me same time Siler is not at all pleased
with the way Fitzsimmons is acting.
W ben both Corbett and the Cornishman
agree I that they would fight under the
plain Marquis o! Queensberry rules, thus
permittini: them to use their fists in the
clinches and breaks, the referee was im
mensely pleased, for he realized that such
an understand. ng would remove a load of
responsibility from his shoulders and do
away with the possibility of procrastina
tion in tha ring over alleped fouls and
supposed uniair tactic?.. But Fitzsim
mons' objections to the clinch clause
broke open the old sore and it began to
look as though there would be no end of
trouble in consequence.
Siler's pian now is the best that could
be devised under the circumstances for
averting the threatened rupture. He
proposes to compile immediately a com
plete set of the unadulterated and un
amended Marquis of Queensberry rules,
and provide each of the big fellows with a
copy. These they will be allowed to pon
der over for a week or two. and when
Siler think? they Have had ample time to
decide whether or not they will abide by
these rules he will favor them with a visit
and ask for their ultimatum. If both
a?ree tc accept the resuiations as they
Mand, why there is an end to the trouble;
or if they mutually decide upon any
amendment it will be equally satisfactory
to the referee. On the other hand, if they
disagree â one want ng one thins: and the
other something else â then Siler proposes
to take the law into his own bands, as he
lias a perfect right to do, and arbitrarily
announce the rules that will govern the
content.
In the event that the latter course
should be found compulsory Siler will
favor Fitztimmons to the extent that be
will net issue bis proclamation until the
mornine of the battle. That seems to be
what the Cornishman wants, bis aim be
ing to prevent Corbett from concentrating
his preparatory work on any one particu
lar line of fiehting. Corbett must do some
guessing. But just the same it seems to
be a foregone conclusion that if the final
decision as regards the tactics to be fol
lowed h left to Siler he will decree that
hitting in the clinches and breaks will be
tolerated and shall not be considered foul.
There was another new arrival at Fiti-
MR. CORBETT AND THE LADY.
(INTERCEPTED.)
CARSON, NEV., Feb. 24, 1897.
To the JournaLExamiwr (Copyrighted):
I am suffering from a severe attack of writers' cramp and my letter
will be brief. 1 am pleased to see that you gave two full pages of
to-day's paper to the fight. 1 think it would be a stroke of enterprise
to print nothing but fight matter until the thing comes off. All my ac
quaintances read nothing else.
One of our lady reporters showed up to-day and was warmly wel
comed. 1 read and approved her letter and sent it with this.
Would it not be well to buy up and destroy the issue containing
the editorial on women at prize-fights ? It was printed at the time of
the Sharkey-Fitzsimmons match, which brought us so much profit and
so little credit. Our readers have probably forgotten the editorial, but
the other papers might get hold of it and make us trouble. Thank
heaven, all we write now is copyrighted, and when we publish a fake
or make a break in the editorial columns it cannot be quoted against us.
The lady reporter's article follows.
COPYRIGHTED CORBETT.
MR. CORBETT THROUGH A WOMAN'S EYES.
BY A COPYRIGHTED WOMAN. â ' ;
Two events in one day! How few of my sisters can write that. Many of them are
born, grow up and pass into the cold shades of eternity without having one occur
rence in their lives worth recording. But Iâ happy Iâ hare had two great events
within the short compass of twenty-four hours.
I saw Corbet t and I fainted.
I saw him first.
I was sitting in the local room meditating upon my romantic career as reporter
when I heard a voice from the editorial sanctum. "Hurl yourself into a hack," it
said, "catch the first train for Nevada and interview Corbett. Your position depends
upon your success. "We must have the interview. Nevermind the expense, the more
you spend the better. remember that Mr. Hearst is a multi-milJioniare."
How my heart palpitated. /
To think that I should have been chosen for this great errand ; that 1 should have
been selected to speak to the Great Gladiator of the Golden West.
Ah, me! lamto be famous thus.
A glance at the reflection of my hat in the little mirror I always carry, a hurried
plunge down the dusty stain and lam out in the broad sunlight of Mission street. A
moment more and lam at Lotta's Fountain. The little dwarf boy holds up a bunch
of fragrant dew-be jeweled violets. "Please Miss." he pleads, "buy them. Me mother
so sick."
In a moment the dainty blossoms are in my bosom and on their way to Corbett.
I have been told that the little dwarf boy is 30 years old and owns a nursery. I
don't believe it.
I don't believe it because I don't want to believe it.
I will give the violets to Mr. Corbett. lam not the woman who gave violets to
Mr. Purrant. I gave him daisies and sweet peas.
How slow this car runs. Ido not wonder that the people dislike Mr. Vining.
1 hate, I loathe, I detest him.
Thank heaven, lam at the ferry at last In with the crowd, while the great bell
peals and peals and peals. What does it say to themâ to the throng that hastens on
board. Ala?, I know not, bat to me it says one thine and says it over and over again
with persistent vehemence: "She is going to see Mr. Corbett, the great Mr. Cor bet
and the gulls screamed, "She is going, to see Mr. Corbett, the great Mr. Corbett."
I felt that people were looking at me. Something had told them that I was to
wear the laurel crown of fame and be known wherever Corbett is known.
In the car I drew a veil over my face and sent my mind adrift on a sea of delicious
reverie. I thought of the glorious opportunities opening on every band to advancing
womanhood. The great struggle for place in the ranks of journalism was won. â  A
woman had been selected to interview Corbett! I would wiite to Susan B. Anthony
and dear Miss Shaw and tell them that they had not toiled in vain. I dropped a tear
as I thought of the legion of women hidden -away in nameless graves who might have
been great and glorious.
Then I thought of my own death.
Helas!
I thought of my monument. It would be a plain but costly shaft. No name
would be carven upon its marble face, but there would be the all-sufficient inscription:

The train rattled on and at last Carson was in sight.
Our sylphlike Sporting Editor met me at the depot, and greeted me with effusive
cordiality.
II think he overdid the thing.
Can he be jealous? â¢
The snDrÂ»me moment came at last. I was in the presence of James J. Corbett.
I recognized him at once by 'our copyrighted pictures of his pompadour.
Can I describe my emotions! Can I put in cold and chilling words the rapture
with which I gazed on that form!
Never! Ah, meâ never!
He has the bead of a Greek god. Hi? neck rises above his shoulders like a tower of
ivory. He has the torso of a Hercules, the arms and thighs of an Apollo Belvedere
And bis feet!
If the soul of Phidias, the sculptor, still wanders over this sordid earth surely it
is to be found worshiping at the feet of Corbett. ' .
I looked at them and fainted.

Simmons' camp to-day in the shape of '
Stelzner, the boxer who trained Bob for
bis late fight with Sailor Snarkey, &nd
who was recently matched to fight Jef
fries but failed to do so on account of ill
ness. Fitzsimmonson was immensely
pleased upon beholding nis old spurring
partner, for be has felt the need of his
services during bis training. Dan Uictcey
has been doing well enough with the tail
chap, but he could not give him work
enough to do. Now Stelzner can take
half of the work off Hickey's bands,
and between them tney can keeD tbe
Cornisuman hustling. Stelzner was at the
ranch scarcely an hour to-day before he
challenged FitKsimmons to a bout and was
reaciiiy accommodated. The pair thumped
each other and both were soon streaming
wiih perspiration. Stelzner finally said
be had enoueb, but Bob had not, and so
Hickey took the other trainer's place and
there was another merry go. Even alter
Hickey was punope>i out Fitssimmons
made Roeber. the wrestler, put on the
gloves and put the finishing touches on the
wariuing-up process.
One thing I noticed in particular in
| Fitzsimmons' work to-day was the fact
that he roes at his sparring partners in
dead earnest and eeems to be guided
throughout the bouts by a desire to thor
j ought? best them. The trail. ers have mi
i struclions to do their level best and hit
i the Cornisfircan as often and as hard as
| they can. Both Uickey and Stelzner are
fast and stiff punchers and fairly clever as
well. The result is that when one sees
I Fits at his work be is sure to witness a
| far better entertainment than would be
| the case had he paid Corbett a visit at
| tioaws Springs.
6 rbett seems to tower over bis sparring
partners, and is co far their superior as a
boxer and a hitter that they seldom make
a good showing with him and scarcely
ever land on him. But Fitz seems to re

the stable-keeper and get a percentage of
the profits accruing from the letting out
of teams.
The event out at CorbetPs training
quarters to-day was the arrival of Billy
Delaney, the veteran trainer, and Jeffries,
the well-known young giant from Loa An
geles. Delaney, of coarse, is here to take
full charge of the training of Corbelt. He
haa made the big Californlan ready for ali
of his great battles, and, indeed, is said to
be Jim's mascot. Billy worships tfie very
ground Corbett walks ou, and it would
break his heart if James ever trained for
a fignt under any other than the veteran's
watchful eye.
Delaney did not remain long in town
after his arrival. He was anxious to be
near Corbett, and fretted and stewed until
a conveyance waa finally engaged to take
him out to the springs.
I had a little chat with billy this after
noon, after he had had an opportunity to
watch thb pompadoured athlete at his
work. The trainer was bulb ing over
with admiration lor his protege.
"Jim ls not only himself again, but he
looks better to me than he ever did be
forÂ»," said Billy. "He looked well enough
when 1 saw him a fortnight ago in Ban
Francisco, but he is a hundred per cent
bettar now. There is no getting around
the fact that I thought it was all up with
Jim after he madt that poor showing with
bharkey. I {tared he was going bacK, but
it turns out that that experience waa the
saving of him. Nobody knew better than
he that he had made a mistake, and he set
about immediately to rectify it. His
present condition shows how faithfully he
attended to the rebuilding process. Alter
watching him carefully this afternoon I
satisfie 1 myself that he has already
reached the top notch of condition. I can
see readily that my chief task from now
on will be to prevent him from overwork
ing himself and growing stale. He is a
glutton for work and always has to be held
iv check during his training with a Hand
of iron. Ha is ready to fight right now,
and all we have to do is to keep him where
be is. I am going to start him out tor
road work immediately and get his wind
perfect.
"What do I think of the outlook? Why,
Corbett in a walk. He will treat Fitz as a
cooper would a barrei. I do not think
Fitz is dead game and never did think so.
He does not like a hard punch, and he is
going to get lots of them in this fight be
fore he lies down."
There has been some talk among the
Coroett hosts as to whether Delaney or
Charley White is to have the distinction
of being the chief trainer of the camp.
This was fettled for good to-aay, when
Corbett announoed that Delaney would
wield the baton. White's services will be
valuable because he has trained Fitz and
claims to be familiar with all of the Cor
nishman's weak points. Jeffries' duty at
the spring* will be to spar with Corbett
twice a day. The bulky lad will not pat
on the gloves with Jim to-day, but will
make his debut in the morning. He has
never boxed with Oorbett. and naturally
feels a little nervous about the first meet
ing. Corbett realized this, and it was his
own snggestion that Jeffries rest until the
morning.
"1 Know how it is myself," he said,
patting Jeffries on the back good &*â¢
turedly, "we will go mo the handball
court in the morning all by ourselves ana
get thoroughly acquainted. After we get
so we understand each other we can box
in tue presence of company."
Corbett's work during the day did Dot
differ from his usual routine of bag
nunching, hanaball playing and boxing.
He busted his best bag while beating a
tattoo on it, and knocked Billy Woods
down once whiie sparjing with him.
Big Jack McVey. tne wrestler, has so
far recovered from his recent illness that
he will be able to resume his daily prac
tice with James J to-morrow morning.
The programme for the lGth of March

Corbett) and -â¢â¢Mysterious" Billy .Smith
were formally matched, and article- of
agreement were a.'*o signed -for a 'finish
â¡gat for the leather- championship
and a purse of $2300 between Dal Hawkins
of San Francisco and Martin Flaherty of
Boston, who recently jumped into promi

Where Smith and jf'laherty will do their
training has not been decided. It is pos
sible that one, perhaps both, will be in
stalled at Cook's ranch, bat space is lim
ited thereabouts. The two Eastern pngi
iists left for Nevada to-night and should
reach Carson on Monday next. HawkinÂ»
and Green are expected within two days.
Secretary Wheelock now roughly esti
mates tbe seating capscity of the pavilion
at from 17,000 to 20,000. The exact num
ber of seats cannot be calculated until
more perfect blue prints are proved. The
plans were sent to Ban Francisco, it being
impossible to obtain clear copies in Carson
owing to the extreme cold. The super
structure of the arena is shooting up like a
mushroom, and it now seems probable
that work will be completed at an earlier
date thfcn that originally fixedâ March 12.
Dan Stuart was well enough to be out of
doors to-day, but fear of a relapse has
made him cautious, and he will stick to
his room for a day or so longer. The
weather is moderating, and roads will be
fit for wheeling to-morrow.
OLMYPIC CLUB REJECTED.
San Francisco Kennel Club Admitted to
Membership in the American Kennel
Club at New York.
ITSff YOKK, N. V., Feb. 24. â The
regular annual meeting of the American
Kennel Club was held this afternoon dar
ing the dog snow at Madison Square
Garden. The election of offioers resulted
in the re-election of August Belmont and
Henry Brooks as president and vice-presi
dent, respectively. After a number of
amendments to the constitution were
passed the meetin* adjourned and re
convened as an executive committee.
Several letters and telegrams were read
as to the rival claims for admission to
membership by the San Fiancisco Kennel
and the O.ympic club*, showing that there
was great excitemant over tne rivalry.
Tne constitution of the Olympic Club
was found to hnve no provision for hold
ing bench Â«hows, and accordingly the
application was rejected. Tne San Fran
cisco Kennel Club was elected to mem
bership, as was al>o the Santa Clara
Valley Club. All the does which had
been improperly entered at the Boston
show and disqualified by the secretary
under the rules were ruled out by action
of the club.
lEUtiY llAl.t DROPS OUT.
SelUnetr It Writ Ahtatt in the Six-Hay
Cycle liner.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 21â Teddy Hale,
the Irish champion, lost all hope of win
ning a prize in the six days' cycle race at
Tattersali's and abandoned the contest to
day. He had ridden since midnight, and
shortly after 8 o'clock this morning, in
company with Trainer Johnson, loft the
building for a hotel in the neighborhood.
Expressions of regret that Hale could not
finish the contest are numerous.
Schineer still has a commanding lead
over the field, and maintains that he will
hold this advantage to the end. He is in
excellent condition and is riding bard.
Asninger, however, will try to make up
the gap between himself and* the leader
before the six day* are up, and is trying
hard to make a constant gain. Miller will
also make a tight to win, but it is the gen
i eral opinion that Schineer will keep the
lead. This evening, however, bis heart
action was irregular, but little alarm is
felt for his condition.
At midnight the score stood: Schincer
1050, Milier 952, Ashineer 941. Lawson 932,
Stewart 896, Bradis 854, Hanson 853, Ho.

CN SLENDER CLEWS.
PacifioAvenue School Teachers Much
Disturbedâ Second Occurrencj
cf the Kind.
Whistling a merry tune, little Douglass
Talbot started for school from bis home at
Â£6?0 Jackson street last Tuesday morning,
and now for any informa:ion conrerning
bis whereabouts one might as well ques
tion the sphinx.
Has he voluntarily absented himself
from home? Has he been kidnaped? Or,
worse yet, is he dead? These are the
questions that are disturbing the quietude i
of his stepfather's household and have i
driven his invalid mother into a frenzy of !
suspense and grief,
Concerned with the boy's mysterious i
disappearance are many vague rumor*, j
more or less authentic, some to the effect
thai he has at last followed a youthful
inclination to leave home and become a
modern Don Qaixote. and others that he !
has been stolen by his fnher, named La- I
mont. This latter theory ii entirely dis- \
credited at the Talbot residence, as it is
there believed the father of the boy died
in Australia three or four years ago.
Little Donglase is the son of Mrs. Talbot
wife of W. H. Talbot of the firm of Pope Â«fc
Talbot, wealthy lumber merchants, with
offices at 230 California street. She was
divorced fn.>m the boy's father some years
aeo.
He was a pupil of the Pacific-avenue
- School, located near the intersection of
Broderick street and Pacific avenue, and
was in i be sixth grade. He had- not at
tended school at all during the present
rr.or.th owing to the illness of his mother.
Tuesday morning, however, he started
(ior school once more.
I When 1 o'clock arrived and be had not
come home for luncheon the Japanese
Sutler was sent up to the school to find
out the cause. To the parents' wonder
end alarm it was discovered that neither
his teacher. Miss McCleary, nor any of
the pupils had seen anything of him.
Miss Shaw, the principal, was as ignorant
of his whereabouts as tne rest.
in the middle of the afternoon the but
ler was again sent up to tne school, and
when the time came for dismissing the
classes the coachman was also put on the
search, but nobody had yet seen anything
of the boy.
Then it was that the mother's alarm
grew so great that her husband deemed it
wi-e to communicate with the police, and
Detective Cody, with several assistants,
was immediately detailed on the case..
Meanwhile the parents drove out to
Golden Gate Park in a carriage, and
Fcoured all the country round about. The
homes of his- intimate companions were
visited, and tne region of the school thor
oughly pone over oy th* scouring parties,
but all to no avail. Night closed in and
, nothing of the boy had been seen.
From that time to this nothing has been
| learned at all. The suspense v that reigns
in the Talboi home is awful, and new
"theories are constantly appearing to ex
plain the boy's absence.
he strongest theory is that the boy has
rone off with lis father, in spite of tne
fact that it is com batted both by Mrs. Tal
-lot ar.a her husband. There are many in
cidents that give it ground for credence.
Mrs. Talbot was born in this City And ii
the daughter of Stephen Douglass, a sail
niaker, now. deceased. - Her Christian
f laker, now deceased. Her Christian
srne is Anna.
i When she was 18 years of ace she mar
jied a man named^Larnont, but some time
after she secured a divorce from him.
Then she married W. H. Talbot of the
firm of Pope & Talbot.
For ten years their domestic happiness
has remained unmarred and the first dis
turbing factor i- the disappearace of the
hoy,.X)ouglass. News reached Mrs. Talbot
four or live years ago that Lamont had died
in Australia.
Tner- are many who believe that he still
lives, and among them was the little boy i
himself. His own remarks showed this '
fact.
About one month ago little Robbie Law- j
ler, son of Dr. Lawler of Ban Quentin, said
to a boy companion:
"I wonder what's the matter with j
Douglass? He has everything that he j
could wish. He admits tha if he bad not
been told he would never have known
from the treatment he received that Mr.
! Taiboi was not his father. Yet some |
time ago he tola me he nad found out his j
father was in Australia, and he was go:nu
10 write to him to come and take him
away."
"We mijht take some stock in this no
tion," said Mr. Taiboi yesterday, "if we
did not know i Â«Â»*itiveiy that his father
died about four yeara ago. As for the boy
himself he was petted and pampered ;n
every conceivable way and was devotedly
fonu of his mother. Her illness has kept
him from school a great deal of late, as he
would not consent to leave her unless I
could remain.
'â¢Our belief is that he may have Been
kidnaped in the hope of extorting a large
sum for his return. Again his head was
tilled with all sorts ol romantic notions,
ana he early evinced a desire to go to sea.
He may have done so now.
"We do not believe that any accident
could have happened to him, such as
drowning for instance, as he never went
fishing and seldom played near the
water."
During this conversation Mrs. Talbot's
nerves kbvc way and she burst into a fit
of violent weeping. It was caused by the
thoUiTUt that something may so happen
to her founeen-year-o!d son- Leroy, now
attending St. Matthew's private school in
San Mateo County. The directors of that
institution have been, notified- of the
younger son's disappearance and told to
keep a close wa.cb. upon the elder.
At the residence of Dr. Liiillaw, 1715
Broderick, Mrs.. Talbot's sister said she
bad heard nothing at all, but she also be
li<>ved Lamoni was dead. -
Miss Shaw, the principal of the Pacific
avenue school, was much surprised over
the news. Snesaid:
"Detectives were here this morning, but
we were unable to give then: any informa
tion. The last any of the 'pupils saw of
the child was when he and his dog were
playing down at the beach last Monday.
"The boy was studious in bis habits,
quiet in demeanor and never gave any
trouble. We never had to keep vim after
school*
"I regret this sad occurrence very much,
because about a year aeo another boy dis
appeared from the school. It was after
ward discovered that his father had taken
him away. Parents are likely to get
frightened and imagine their children are
in danger of being kidnaped from here at
any time."
Laft night Special Officer Hillbusn re
mained on guard near the Talbot resi
dence.
The boy was 12 years of age. When he
left home he wore a gray suit.

WANTS A NEW
POSTOFFICE.
Continued from First Page.
to commence this work, and I shall not go j
near the Treasury Department until the
new Secretary is installed. I feel quite
confident that something can be done
then. Of course I am not expected to
have much influence with a Democratic
administration, but I shall n.Â«e my best
efforts to induce the new administration
to undertake this work as soon as it is in- i
stalled. Of course the work will be under
supervision of one of the assistant Secre
taries, and these may not be appointed for
a month or six weeks after the 4th of
March, but by the middle of April 1 hope
that we may pet the work under way."
Senators Perkins and White and Repre
sentatives Hiiborn, Johnson and Barbara
were seen, and in response to The Call's
urgent appeal promised to do everything
in their power to get the actual work of
construction commenced as soon as possi
ble. The Call correspondent learned to
nlgnt that a short time ago Senator Whito
and Representative Barnam saw Secretary
Carlisle, and urged that Thomas Beck oV
appointed superintendent of construction
of the building. Mr. Jttecfc superintended
the construction of the Santa Cruz Court
house. They were considerably surprised
when informed that Mr. Beck was not
eligible because be bad not passed the
civil service examination. Neither White
nor Barham were aware that civil service
examination bad been held for superin
tendent, but this appears to be the case.
Representative Johnson said that if
Judge Maguire had done bis du.y the Ban
Francisco PostoSice building by this time
wotiid have been fully under way of con
struction. "I will do all in my power to
advance its completion and give the un
employed of California a chance to earn a
living. I have always believed that the
Government should during hard limes ex
| pend money so that the suffering people
j should not have to seek chanty.
"I think the California delegation should
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1R97.
ask the Senate to put an amendment on
the sundry olvil appropriation bill asking
for $3000 for more borings and not take
this amount from the original appropria
tion for the building."
Representative Barham said he thought
the cause of delay in not only the Ban
Francisco Postoffice, but the improvement
of rivers and harbors, was owing to the
fact that the present administration did
not propose to issue more bonds during its
last days.
FOR ACTION.
The Work to Ba Started by Five
Bis Commercial Bodies.
Without doubt the Chamber of Com
merce, Manufactureâ¢' and Producers'
Association, the Board of Trade of San
Franchco, California State Board of
Trede and the Merchants' Association will
taue the Postoffice proposition in hand.
Within the next two or three days a meet
ing will be held by the presidents of these
live large commercial and manufacturing
organizations with the view of uniting the
strength of their associations in one
miehty effort to effect the desired object,
namely, the beginning of-work on the new
Postoffice. The suggestion came from
Julian Sonntag, president of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association,
who said: "It is high time thatsometbing
should be done in the matter of erecting
the new Postoffice. While efforts to have
the work started have been made in'the
past, still those efforts have been made by
individual organizations and not by all
combined. There is money on hand for
beginning the work of excavating and
there could be no better time than the
present, when times are none too flush
and when there is plenty of labor to be
had. It would certainly put money in
circulation at a time when it would do the
most good.
'â¢The live large commercial bodies com
bined would be able to make a fine show
ing in a demand upon the United States
authorities that the work be commenced.
As a preliminary to such a movement
there should be a meeting of Hugh Craig,
president of the Chamber of Commerce;
A. A. Watkinn, president of the Board of
Trade of San Francisco; W.F. Dohrmann,
president of the Me rchants' Association;
J. F. Chipruan, president of the California
State Board of Trade, and the president of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
station (Julian Sonntag). Arrangements
could be made by which all these leaders
should send to the supervising architect
at Washington and to the Pacific Coast
Representative, urgently requesting them
lo do something to make the funds on
hand available for the nrat work on :he
site. lam willing to do all in my power |
to help such a movement alone. Some
thing ought to be done, and that at once."
Hugh Craig of the Chamher of Com
merce stated that ever since the Postoffice
â ji te was selected the chamber has done all
in its power to have the work begun. On
four occasions that booy sent most earnest
petitions to Congress, to the Pacific Coast
delegates and to the Treasury officials to
have the work started. Tne only answer
that has ever been received wa< that the
rlansof the building were being altered
or being prepared in tbo architect's de
partment. The last effort in this direction
was in June, 1896, when the Chamner sent
long, urgent resolutions to Washington. I
In regard to this matter Mr. Craig said:
"This would be a most excellent time for
making use of money that is appropriated
for Postoffice purposes. After the lot on
Seventh street was purchased there was
about $210,000 left over, which might just
as well as not be uaed for excavating the
lot, even though the plans for the build
ing proper have not been completed.
There is plenty of excavating to be done,
and this would give s- me relief to the
badly overcrowded labor market. At least
500 men could be put to work ctearine
away for the foundation, and every man
should receive the regular price of $2 a
day for his labor. Something should be
done to relieve ihe strain, for there are
900 men with families and fully 10U0 single
men who are now in the ranks of the un
employed. They must have work, and to
what. better use couid the Postofflce money
be put than in reliuving a lot of worthy
men who are willine to work? By hold
ing a meeting we could frame a petition
to the Secretary of the Treasury, asking
him to use his efforts in behalf of the San
Francisco Postottice."
Captain W. L. Merry is equally enthusi
astic in desiring that the first movement
in the erection of the Postoflice be made.
He said that the Chamber of Commerce,
of which be is the secretary, has made re
peated efforts to get the people in Wash
ington to do sometning in the desired
direction, but these petitions or requests
hayÂ« always been turned off with some
excuse or other. He said that he is con
vinced that to start the work at once
would be of double benefit, and, with Mr.
Craie, be hopes that the public will take
up this matter and not stop until the
thing desired is accomplished.
J. F. Filcher, manager of the State
Board of Trade, stated that of all things
desirable to San Francisco this is one of
the most, as it would give employment to
a large number of men and thU3 relieve
the pressure on the labor market. He
baid: "It seems to me that we have had
enough nonsense about the Postoflice
building. We have the site and plenty of
money to begin the work: on the founda
tion. O.her cities have had postoffices
built since the San Francisco Postoffiee
project was started. They got their many
Bites and buildings, and we have only a
site. I will gladly telegraph to Sacra
mento to have President Chipinan come
down and join in toil conference with the
other bodies. For that matter, I would
round up half of the board for that pur
pose if it would be of any benefit.''
"The Call" Is Dolnff a Public Servlca.
City Hall Architect Frank Sheaâ The
Government is noted, in all other cases,
for pushing work upon public buildings
under it* contract rapidly, which makes
the delay here more noticeable and re
markable. The building should be erected
at one?, and The Call ia doing a public
service in advocating a more energetic
course. The first thin? to be done is to
ascertain, through cur Senators and Rep
resentatives at Washington, to what cause
the delay is due. That is the only way to
reach a proper understanding of the real
facts. The Postoffice building will be one
of the finest in the United States. Pressure
should be exerted on Representatives at
Washington. There are so many men
iiile that this is surely the opportune time
to make a start
To Help the Unemployed.
Colonel Sullivan, secretary to Mayor
Phelan â The delay in constructing the
Postoffice building is an outrage. When
the large number of unemployed is con
sidered the urgency appears. Consider
that our Postoffice is one of the most im
portant in the United States, yielding a
large revenue. Also consider the large
amount of money collected through the
Customs service and Internal Revenue
service here. Then iC will be seen how
unfairly we are being treated in this
matter. The only way to accomplish
anything is to get after our representa
tives in Washington. Action will follow
when the situation is fully compiebended
by the Government.
A Crylnjr Necessity.
Chief of the Fire Department Sullivanâ
Of course there is need now for the new
Postoffice building, and there has been a
crying necessity for it during a long lime
â ever since the s:te was purchased by the
Government. The earlier the work is done
the better.

Very likely I will introduce a resolution

Would Put Coin In Circulation.
Supervisor Devaneyâ The local labor
question can be solved at once for a time
at least by beginning and pushing with
necessary vieor the work upon the new
Postoffice buiiding, for a large force of
skilled and unskilled workmen must be
employed and their employment would
cause a large amount of money to be
placed in circulation. California has fared
poorly at the hands of the General Gov
ernment â San Francisco conspicuously,
and Oakland has not been treated as it
ought to have been. This is the time to
do the work without delay. I will vote in
tbe board in favor of calling attention to
this matter.
Our Rf pr- sentatlv^s to Blame,
Edward W. Williams, clerk of tbe Jus
tices' Coun â Oar representatives at Wash
ington have been to blame. The present
delegation should do tbe business for U9.
I do not know any better thing for San
Francisco than the beginning of work on
the new Postoffice. We have two San
Francisco ConKressraen. Two Senators
can also be credited to San Francisco, for
they were elected by the votes of San
Francisco Senators and Assemblymen at
Sacramento. The present .Postoffice is the
worst west of ihe Rocky Mountain?. I
think that it would be well to ask tbe Leg
islature to send on a memorial to Wash
ington to urge our representatives to take
the proper action.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THURSDAY FEBRUARY SB, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
4500 inches
of advertisements, which is
492 inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
How about our new Postoffice building?
There is one consolation: Grover must
get a more on in eight days.
Congress gave us an appropriation for a
new Postoffice building many years ago,
but where is it?
The Legislature promises to force the
fighting and try to knock the session out
in two rounds of one week each.
The agitation for free Cuba has revived
in the East with new vigor and now is the
time for San Francisco to speak out.
According to reports from the East, the
blizzards are over and floods are submerg
ing several districts as harbingers of spring.
San Jose will meet the new era with a
new charter and be as proud and lively as
a debutante at a frolic with a license to
flirt.
The object of the Greeks in invading !
Crete seems to be parth' to bring about
pan-Hellenism and partly to pot the
Turks.
Greece does the fighting and England
does the talkine, but it is evidently Russia
that holds the lort and has the say-so in
the crisis.
The San Dlegc carnival committee
closed its fro ics with all bills paid and
money in the treasury. It was a water
carnival, but it wasn't at all at sea.
There would be work for a cood many
of the unemployed if ihe construction of
ournew Postoffire building were underway
and sonif effort should be made at once to
get ii started.
It seems clear that the only way to get a
move on the Government officials who are
holding ba^k the work of constructing the
new Postoffice bu lding in this City is to
start an agitation which will shake
them up.
The situation in the Levant involves a
curious contradiction. It is cvervwhere
said that the existence of the Turkish em
pire is r. menace to the peace of Europe,
and yet all the great powers are in alliance
to keep it in existence.
As Senator Sherman says the fake in
terview purporting to come from him
which was rec ntly published in the
Examiner was "sheer idiocy," it may be
t;i ken for granted that it was written in
.thatoffiie, being in fact another Li Ynnz
Yuen telegram.
If reports from Havana are true it is full
time tor v squadron of warships to be sent
by our Government to that port in order
to protect our citizens residing there. The
vindictive spirit of the Spaniards has been
aroused and there may be an outbreak of
Violence at any time.
If Judge McKenna had any doubt of the
favor with which his appointment to a
position in the Cabinet has been received
in this City it must have been fully al
layed by this time. All classes and par
ties of citizens have unite I in doing him
honor and making a feast of it. He has
In fact been so toaÂ«ted that he need have
no fears of ever being roasted.
It is 'aid to have taken eight freightcars
to carry to "Washington City the personal
belongings of Charles P. Sprague, a mil
lionaire Congressman-elect from Massa
chusetts. It is safe to say, however, that
some poor statesman from the West will
go there with nothing but a hair trunk
and a gripsack and cut a bigger swath at
the capital and have a larger hearing out
side.
As dishonest butter-makers in other
States have been shipuing butter to
Europe under the brand of New York,
where the butter is kept up to standard
by official inspection, a movement is to
be made to get Congress to authorize the
copyrighting of the New York State brand
. for dairy products. If the plan succeeds
why should we not have a State copyright
for California fruit?
The New York Congressman who on the
floor of the House opposed the Boston
dry dork bill, but declared his sympathy
with the people of that City "in trying to
make Boston a seaport," will find himself
grossly misunderstood by the people with
whom he sympathized. Tney will be sure
to regard his speech as inappropriate to
the occasion and wonder where he ob
tained his lack of culture.
There may yet be formed a great Eu
ropean diplomatic council to sit perma
nently at Constantinople to keep tbo peace
in the Levant, and this council of em
bas?adors may eventually act in the set*
tlement of nearly all international ques
tions, so that in the course of time Con
stantinople may become the diplomatic
capital of Europe, AÂ«ia and Africa, and
eclipse the glory of the days when she was
the center of the Roman empire.
THE POSTOFFICE BUILDING.
According to reports from our correspondent at Washington it is not likely that
we shall see the beginning of work on our new postoffice building for a long time
unless some means can be devised to induce the Government officials to act with much
more speed and promptness than tney seem inclined to do. The supervising archi
tect declares the Government is not yet satisfied that the site is a safe one for the
proposed structure. New tests are to be made, and these have not yet been begun.
The attitude of the administration toward this work has long been
irritating and is now of a character to arouse indignation. The agitation
for a new ToatofHce building in this City dates back to a time so remote
that the memory of the oldest inhabitant hardly runs so far. After years of
agitations, requests, arguments and pleadings Congress was induced to vote an
appropriation for the work. Still the work was not begun. Upon one excuse or
another it has been delayed year after year. For a time it was said that the Govern
ment doubted whether the site selected was suited fcr the structure. At another time
it was repotted that the office of the supervising architect was overworked and that
plans had not been prepared. Still later it was declared that the drain upon the
public treasury was such that the Government could undertake no work not abso
lutely necessary or not Imperatively required by act of Congress.
Each of these excuses served its turn. The demand of the public for the construc
tion of the work was allayed again and again. So the years have passed and the
money appropriated by Congress lies idle in the treasury, the Governmeut officials
sit apparently idle at their desks and San Franrisco is seemlnely no 'nearer the
accomplishment of her long desire for the new building than she was when the agita
tion for it first began.
When the tests of the site were made by engineers of the War Department fully
two years ago it was fondly hoped that we were near the beginning of the work. It
will be a surprise to our people to learn now that this report is considered inadequate.
It looks, indeed, as if this administration had no intention at any time to carry out
the act of Congress providiog for the building, and as if its officials were using any
thing as an excuse for delay.
This Leing the ca?e it is time for the people of San Francisco to renew
the agitation. A large number of men ia this City are clamoring for em
ployment. Private generosity is being called coon to subscribe money to
provide work for those who need it. It would be a most opportune season,
therefore, for the Government to now enter upon the task of erecting the
proposed building. The site has been selected, the money has been appropriated,
plans fcr the building have been drawn up, and it would seem that nothing is needed
to set the work moving except a will to do so on the part of those who have been en
trusted with it.
A new administration will soon be in office, and from that we may expect better
things than we have received from this administration of deficiency and debt
We should begin at once to worlc to the end of inducing the McKtnlÂ«y
administration to undertake the structure without further delay. In these
efforts all the people of San Francisco should unite. Every association rarre
senting any department of the industry or the business interests of the City sbftuld
add its influence to the movement and give all the active aid in its power. Let us
make it known at Washington that San Francisco needs the new building, that her
unemployed workinemen need the work which it will require, and that it is the duty
of the officials of the Government to proceed at once in carrying out the act ol Con
gress appropriating money for the building.
A TEUE OALIFOBNIAN.
If Judge McKenna at any time had any
doubt of the popular favor with which his
selection for a position in the McKinley
Cabinet would be received by the people
of California, it niu?t have been fully and
thoroughly dispelled by this time. His
appointment was everywhere nailed with
gladness. The prÂ»ss throughout the State
gave expression to the sentiments of re
joicing which were universally felt, and
he has had additional proof of the pleas
ure of the people In the banquets which
have been tendered him in this City by
men representing all classes and all par
ties.
The testimonials of esteem shown to
Judge McKenna are to a large extent per
sonal. Ii is quite true that the people re
joice in his appointment because it gives
a Califorman a place in the great execu
tive council of the Nation, but it is equally
true that they would not have been so
much gratiri d had not the man chosen
been one whom they delight to honor
and whom they bel.eve to be worthy
of being the first representative of Califor
nia in the Cabinet of the Nation. Judge
McKenna may rightly accept a large por
tion of the congratulations given him as
being tributes to himself as well as being
expressions of gratified State pride. The
peopl rejoice ce~ause their State has at
tained a high office and because the man
who will fill it wiil add a new honor to the
State by the manner in which he will per
form his duties.
In his address at the banquet on Tues
day evening Judge McKenna showed how
thoroughly he is in sympathy with the
sentiments of his fellow-citizens. After
pointing out that a Cabinet officer is not a
representative of a State, be expressed his
recognition of the fact that an appoint
ment to such an orrice is in some sense an
honor to the State from which the man
who receives it hails. "In that sense," he
said, "setting aside my own connection
with the matter, I may rejoice that a Cali
fornian Is in the Cabinet."
With words of genuine earnestness
Judge McKenna declared his devotion to
the State and his determination to work
with all his energy for its welfare. "I
love California," ha said, "lor its sheer
physical beauty and genial climate. I
love it in its higher *ensibility, in its
birth, in its lie and its action. I shall co
into the Cabinet a Californian, And that
shall be my highest title." These were
right words fitly spoken. They were in
harmony with the occasion and touched
the sympathies of all who were present.
California was doing honor to one of her
fortunate sons, and it was most appropri
ate that he 6hould receive the tribute
paid him witn due recognition of what he
owes to his State and with clear expres
sions of bis loyalty to it
It is a source of gratification that in the
first appointment to the Cabinet from
California the selection has been male of
a man whocarries with him into his office
the respect and the esteem of all his fel
low-citizens. Bnch a man in such an office
will have great influ-nce in promoting
that spirit of harmony which ia essential
to California patriotism. Having the con
fidence of all his lellow-citizens, and being
recognized by men of ail parties as a truo
and loyal representative of California, he
will be able to serve the West in many
ways, and we may rightly rejoice in hav
ing such a man to stand for our State in
the Cabinet.
FALSE BRANLS.
The injury done to articles of standard
merit by the practice of dishonest dealers
in putting the brand of these articles upon
others of inferior worth has long been
known in the United Stntes and has been
frequently complained of. Almost every
section of the Union suffers in some of its
industries (rom the practice, and repeated
efforts have been made to devise a means
of preventing the evil.
It is now reported that a new effort in
the direction of securing the needed pro
tection for standard articles is to be made
by the dairymen of New York. The dairy
law of that State provides that the State
Agricultural Commissioner shall furnish
a brand to butter manufacturers, snd the
produce under the law is kept up to a
certain standard. As a consequence of
this butter bearine the New York brand
has found a profitable market in Europe.
It seems, however, that butter-makers in
other States where tbere is no official in
spection have found out the value of the
New York Drand and are now shipping
Dutter to Liverpool under the stamp of
that State. The consequence is the repu
tation of the brand is being injured, and
the New Yore butter-makers are losing the
trade they have so laboriously built up.
To prevent ouch shipments in future a
bill is to be offered in Congress to nuthor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1897.
ize the copyrighting of the New York
State brand. Such a law would protect
New York dairies and the reputation they
have established from being undermined
by dishonest dealers. It is not clear
whether such special legislation would be
favorably regarded in Congress, but the
dairy interests of the Empire State are
strong enough to mike a fight for it, and
the proposed bill will probably be intro
duced at the next session.
The California fruit industry has suf
f red as much from the practices of dis
honest dealers as has the industry of New
York. It has become the custom in some
of the Eastern cities for dealers in fruit to
label inferior fruits with California brand*.
This evil has been exposed time and
again, bat up to this time no adequate
remedy has been provided against it.
There will be a good deal of sympathy
therefore in California with th? New York
dairymen. If a State brand can be copy
righted forda:ry products, there seems no
reason why one should not be copyrighted
for fruit products, and if so we might de
rive as much benefit from the proposed
legislation as New York itself. The sub
ject, at any rate, is one deserving consid
eration, and the California delegates in
Congre-s should watch the progress ot the
New York oill in order to Califor
nia interests when it crimes up.
"SHEER IDIOuY."
In an interview with Thk Call corre
spondent at Washington Senator Saer
man took occasion to express himself very
emphatically on the course of the New
York Journal and the San Francisco
Examiner in publishing what purported
to be a statement from him, but which
was in fact not only a fake but a deliber
ate falsehood. The Senator denounced
the statement of Mr. Hearst's papers as a
lie and declared that the reports in them
were of such a nature as to mate it "sheer
idiocy to print such statements as emanat
ing from me."
It was hardly necessary for Senator
Sherman to deny the interview which was
published. T;ie statements contained in
it were, as he says, "sheer idiocy," and
could have dccc ved nobody who had any
knowledge ott Â« Senator's charac er and
;ecord as a statesman. He did not need
therefore to deny them to save his own
reputation, but it was nevertheleÂ«s worth
his while to do so, inasmuc i as public at
tention can never be too often called to
the falseness of ihe so-called news which
is printed daily by Mr. Hearst's papers.
We havft had repeated occasion of late
to refer to these "sheer idiocies." The
fakes whicn emanate irom the new jour
nalism have not even the merit of bring
ciever. No amount of exposure seems to
animate the fakers with a desire to do
better next time. The LI Yung Yuen
dispatch, which was the object of so much
ridicule a nhort time ago, has been fol
lowed by another dispatch purporting to
come from the K'ng o^ Greece, and by
several others hardly less idiotic. Not
the slightest attempt is made by tbe
falters to give even the color of truth to
their alleged dispa:chÂ»s, and they lie
with an equal facility about every class of
people from statesmen to prize-fighters,
from Chinese to Greeks.
Senator Sherman, owine to tha fact that
he is soon to enter upon the office of Sec
retary of State, feels no doubt more than
ordinarily sensitive to the misrepresenta
tions which may be made of th j policy
which he will pursue in h:s new office. It
was therefore no doubt extremely irritat
ine to him to find two newspapers pub
lishing in flashy style and with great dis
play headlines an idiotic fake purporting
to be statements direct from him and
containing a falsehood in every line. He
is, therefore, justified in using harsh lan
guage concerning the men who so delib
erately published the falsehoods. To call
the interview "a lio" and to refer to its
publication as "sheer idiocy" was none
too severe under the circumstances.
CLAIMS THh CRti j! F^RJOHN HAY
Kansas City star.
Ex- Attorney -General William* of Kansas
City says he is responsible for John Hay's start
in life. Hay lived in Warsaw, 111., and Wil
liams was studying law at Qulncy. Hay was a
country poet in those daysâ the "Unlettered
Bard" he subscribed himself. He wrote a
quality of poetry that made Mr. Williams
tired, and his rural airs and manners were
â¢imply Killing to the practical Qniucy boy.
"I'll drive that fellow off the riTer," Mr. Wil
liams declared one day, and so ne did.
Mr. Williams got himself together one day
and wrote the rottencst sort of alleged verses.
These he signed, "The Cnbuttered Bard," and
caused them to be Drinted on coarse brown
wrapping paper, such as grocers used Jn those
days. Then he stole up to Warsaw, and in the
dead hour of night he posted the "Unbuttered
Bard's" verses all over the town. This took
tbe conceit out of Hay in au hour. A stern
resolve came into his face and the next week
he left town, going to Springfield, where Lin
coin tooit him Into his law offioe. and after
ward installed him in the Wnite House as his
private secretary.
"Whatever Jonn Hay is or will be," Mr. Wil
liams once said, "1 made him. If I had not
caused him to see himself as others saw him
he would never have left Warsaw, and leaving
Warsaw was what gave him his start."

Editor Call: This, the most glorious coun
try on earth! Thousand* ot men and women
walking the streets, unable to find employ
ment even at a pittance to tarn enough to
keep body and soul together. California, by
nature the most lavishly endowed State in this
Union, in regard to soil and cUmate, where a
very few acres will produce sufficient fur the
subsistence of a family. California, where her
surplus product* are often dumped in the bay
in order to keep the wharves clear for con

where often whoie boatloads of toothsome fish
are thrown overboard in order to keep up the
high price; yes, the for a poor man prohibi

land in this State to-day, of which one ten
thousandth part would produce sufficient

ordinary family, yet there are thousands of
willing and able men and women crying for a
chance to work for a living, and instead ot
soliciting subscriptions for the bull lint? 'of
boulevard, park drive or something similar
.why not buy and equip say, a 10,000-acre farm
and put the unemployed to work on it with
the understanding that they would finally be
come the owner of each a few acres on which
they could by Industry and frugality, as prac
ticed in older and I might say colder countries,
become independent, or at least wouid
not need to apply for assistance from
the community where they happen to reside
at every recurrent bard year. - 1 think that by
following my suggestion a popular subscrip
tion could be more advantageously applied
than by building boulevards and drives, which
would only be of the merest temporary relief
to the unemployed, ana of benefit only to a
few who can afford horses and who would per

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The San Francisco Oratorio Society, con
ducted by James Hamilton Howe, Is having
very fatisfactory rehearsals of "The Messiah,"
which will be the lending feature of ihe grand
music festival to be given in thin City in the
spring, probably in April, The Oakland, Aia
meda and San Jose societies which will lend
their assistance are also taking great interest
In tne work. Musical people are looking for
ward to hearing Mme. Genevra Johnstone
Bishop, who has been engaged to come from
Chicago as the leading soprano soloist at the
festival. Mme. Bishop is acKnowledge dto be
one of the best exponents of oratorio in Amer
ica. She is a pupil of Mme. Anna de la Grange
of Paris, and has sung a good deal with Atie
lina Patti, who is her warm friend and ad
mirer. During the last visit that poor Alex
ander Salvini paid to Patti at Crag-y-Nos.
Mme. Bishop was bis fellow-guest. Mme.
MME GENEVRA JOHNSTONE BISHOP, Who Will Sing in
This City at the Oratorio Festival.
Bishop's voice is said to be of great range,
power and sweetness. Many of the critics
have compared her to Kellogg aud Parepa
Ross.
Singers of moderate ability are allowed to
join toe festival chorus. No fees are charged.
Many anecdotes are being revived of poor
Casteimary, who died recently on the stage of
the Metropolitan Opera-house during a per
formance of "Martha." No opera singer was
prouder or more self-respecting than "Castle,"
as his friends familiarly called him. lie had
saved nothing lor his old rge, and was in con
stant dread of being superseded by some
younger singer, but he was too proud to show
his fears and too seli-respecting to receive
favors from any one. Even in little things
these traits showed themselves. Jean de
Reszce, who was his frequent companion, says
that he would often offer "Castle" cigars and
other small luxuries. "Thank you," ihe basso
would reply, "but I have cigars of my own,
and I never smoke any other brand." When
quite young he married Marie Sasse, a well
known opera singer, and beiore long she ran
away wl:h Victor Maurel. Casteimary never
got over th- blow, bui he did not let it embitter
his intercourse with the world; he was a
genial, pood-hearted fellow, always willing to
â¢rive advice and help to younger art-.s-ts, espe
cially on the subject of costume, on which he
was an acknowledged authority. It was a fad
of his to sing Mephistopneies in black.
During the last few days Paris has discov
ered a composer of great talent. He Is named
Emmanuel Chabricr and the papers are full of
his praises, his music Is beiug played every
where; indeed it will become the proper thing
to play Chubrier, for he has suddenly become
the rage. Unfortunately he la dead. I sup
pose you are surprised at his success, for in
his lifetime poor Chabrier never had a quar
ter of this applause. It is not long since he
joined ihÂ« great majority. We all knew him,
hopeful, brave and addicted to writing charm
ing things, that no one took any notice of.
His opera "Gwendoline" could not hold the
boards of the Grand Opera, perhaps because
Chabrier made the mistake of not dying be
fore the first performance. Bat what is the
use of DOinting this out? it is the usual thing
in Paris. That which happened to Bizet has
happened to Chabrier; it will happen tooth
era. The worst of it is that this time there are
a wife and children to whom the posthumous
success give* glory, but not money, for Cha
brier left his family in want. Can the state
do notnlng in such case-? Reparation is made
to victims of judicial errors. Is no reparation
due to those who have been neglected by the
world when the world finds out its error too
late to do anything but pay them in souvenirs
and re.- rets, the fa so money of human ingrati
tude?â Notes dun Parisian in Le Figaro.
Sousa gives the following wise advice to
composers of light operas:
"There is such a thing as overdressing a
score, just as a woman is guilty of the same
offense to good taste in regard to her toilet.
Every part of her attire may be of the richest
material, but the crowding together of incon
gruous colors and ultra effects may spoil the
beauty of the subject.
"In my exp rienc* I have usually found
that the man whose education has been fur
thest removed from the knowledge of or
chestral instrumentsâ that is, who has niaGe
his compositions througn the aid of a piano
or organ, and has not conceived throuuh the
channel of orchestral effectsâ tries to keep
everybody in the orchestra busy, from the
bass drummer up to the piccolo. He usually
succeeds in keeping his audience busier than
all in trying to decipher what he is getting at.
A man not knowing how to create orchestral
effects is apt to become imitative and tries to
reproduce those orchestral nuances appealing
mo-t powerfully to him. This is one of the
reasons why we have liad au undue quality
of Wajcnerlan orchestration in many of the
modern comic operas. Wagner appeals to
these musician* on account of the greatness
of 1m orchestrat-on ; he strikes these non
creative composers as the proper man to imi
tate, and the sad spectacle is witnessed of
some poor little emaciated soprano'i voice
loaded down with an orchestration fitted for
a Lehman or a Materna, or some little topical
song, enunciated by a voiceless comedian,
builded on solid brass chords, filagreed wood
and arpeggioized strings."
Tho Parisian papers are complaining that
the ca/e concert is rapidly vitiating the pub
lic taste for anything more refined in the way
of music and drama. The cafe concerts are a
combination of music hall and restaurant,
where the entertainment Is very often of any
thing but an elevating character. They are to
be iound In all quarters of Paris and range
from costly and luxurious halls to cneap beer
saloons, with a rough wooden stage. The tne
aters and opera-houses are comp.aining bit
terly of the competition of these rivals, which
they say create a taste for what is vulgar and
obscene. SDeakinu editorially on the sub
ject Le Figaro says: People set the cafe-con
cert habU; they go there every night with
their families. Poor people and people of
moderate means can eujoy warmth and light
there, they can smoke and eat and drinlt, hear
vulgar songi, and see horse play, and women
dressed in spangles, all at popular prices.
They find it less austere than staying at home
and less dear. The laborer can get an illusion
of luxury and there forget his everyday sur
roundings. Alas! to forget our surroundings
seems to cc becoming a need of our times.
There are two musicians attracting atten
tion in Paris at present who belong to races
not usually associated with modern music.
One is a young East Indian prima donna
named Yumata-Tiero, who is meeting with
groat success at the Olympia. The other, who
devotes himself to serious music, is an Arme
nian named Vtihrnn Sevadjiam. He Is a grad
uate of the conservatories of Venice and of Vi
enna, and is said to be a most accomplished
pianoforte virtuoso. At a concert recently
given in the Salle Erard the first part of his
programme consisted of Beethoven, Schumann,
Chopin aud Liszt, and the second part con
sisted of national Armenian airs, transcribed
by himself, and an "Armenian Rhapsodic" of
his own composition. French musicians are
very much interested in his work, and they
think he may be able to Initiate them into the
mysteries of Oriental music
The popular prima donna, Mme. Ada
Adini, met with a curious experience the
other d*y in Bucharest, where she has been
creating a big furor. One night the crowd
was so great that many people were unable to
obtain entrance to the National Opera-house.
Among those turned away were 100 students
of the University of Bucharest. These young
men at once assembled in the operÃ-house
square and made a riotous demonstration,
threatening to break into the theater and
carry off the prlma donna it they were not at
one* lei in. A force ot police which was
hastily brought on the scene managed to quell
the revolutionary project, but the manager of
the opera-house, who did not want to antcg
onfzeso many of the students of Koumania,
offered to let them into the th-ater if they
could crowd themselves into the aisles. The
offer was accepted, nnd th-* students showed
their satisfaction at the end ot the perform
ance by taking the horses out of Mme. Adinl's
carriage aud drawing her home in triumph.
Monte Carlo seems to be having a feast of
opera and concart. Paderewski has appeared
there several times this month, having ap
parently quite recovered from his recent ner
vous illness. In addition to his own Polish
"Fantasia," he has played several other concer
tos wiih Vigna's orchestra, including Liszt's E
flat concerto. At the opera in Monte Carlo
Adelina Patti is appearing in "La Traviata,"
and the papers speak of her voice as being as
fresh aud young as ever. The California
soprano, Mile. Francesca, continues her suc
cess at Monte Carlo, and the conductor, Arthur
Visna, a young Italian, is another newcomer
who is spoken of in terms of enthusiastic
praise.
Melba is a good pedestrian and a great club

little Bauermeister rides a hobby horse in her

methods of exercise are \o ward oft too much

Massenet's opera ' Le Cid" has been as much
a fai ure at the Metropolitan Opera-house as it
was some years ago a: La Scalain Milan. Both
the De Reszkes, as well as Clementine ac Vere.
Lftsselle and Pol Plancon.were in the cast, and
to the surprise of these stars the New York
public devo:ed almost its entire stock of en
thusiasm to tho ballet and gave very little at
tention to the singers.
Irish opera having proved so successful in
New York Harry B. Smith and Reginald de

Robert Bruce will be one of the chief char

violinist who has been studying abroad for

Snsan Strong, the Brooklyn soprano who
made her American debut with Mapleson's ill
fated company, has now joined the Damrosch
forces, though the critics do not consider her
asuccesslul interpreter of Wagnerlan roles.
Melba will leave Paris for New York next
Saturday. The talk about her suffering from
cancer in the throat seems to be mere idle
rumor.

There Was an Exciting Race in th: Brooklyn Basin Between British Boats Last Sunday. The Rathdown's Cutter That "Was Built in New Zealand Beat Them
and Now the Apprentice Boys Are Anxicus 1o Race Any Boat in San Francisco.
CUPID A-SAILING
ON THE QUEEN
Lovers Could Not Get Mar
ried at Sea by the
Captain.
Alexander Had a Similar Ex
perience Once Eelcre on
the Santa Rosa.
An Exciting Boatrace in the
Brooklyn Basin Last Mon
day.
The steamer Queen brought a story to
the front yesterday. A young couple ran
away from Los Alamos, and when the ves
sel was well out to sea the man asked Cap
tain Alexander to marry them. The pop
ular master of the steamer had had a
similar experience some months ago, how
ever, and, as tbere was a general kicK
from the powers that be, he thought twice
before acceding to the request, rie went
to the young iady, and after a quiet chat
with ber decided that no "marriaee on the i
The Executive and Finance Committees Appointed by the General Relief Committee Discussing the Question of Raising Funds and
Districting the Gty for the Benefit of the Unemployed*
hieh seas" should be performed aboard
the Queen.
The eioping couple were Miss Lena Lea
he and K. W. Cook. The young iadv was
barely out of sbort dresses, and it was
owing to her youthful appearance that the
gallant captain refused to perform the
ceremony. The young couple's happi
ness was short-lived, however, as tbe
young lady's atber awaited her as soon
as the vessel docked. There was an alter
cation and an explanation, after ryhich a
marriage license was procured and every
thing ended iiappily.
The groom is a popular employe of ihe
railroad company at Los Alamos "and Mrs.
Coot is thedaucbter of a well-known at
torney in Santa Bari ara. Tbe only objec
tion to the marriage was the age of the
young people, ana Captain Alexander,
who is a jtidkre in such matters, says the
objection was a good one.
Taey had a rattiin? race in the Brook
lyn Basin last Monday. Quite a number
of foreign shipping is tied up tbere and
tbe men aboard find it hard work to make
the time pass. Ihe captains would not
allow a race on Sunday, but Washington's
birthday beinj; a holiday they allowed the
men the use of tne boats and one of tbe
prettiest races ever seen in the creek was
the result. The Raihdown's cutter was
an easy winner and her crew assert that
tbere is not a boat of her class in Cali
fornia that can beat her.
1 he crack cutter was built in Auckland,
N. Z., and is constructed from the famous
Kauri pine. She is one of the prettiest
little boais of her kind ever turned out of
a shipyard, and if the Maonlatidera turn
out as pood yachts as they do ship's boats
Unc c Bam will nave to look to his laurels.
The Uathdown was in a hurricane during
her laat voyage and after being on her
beam ends and receiving considerable
damage beside losing one of the port boats
had to put into Auckland for repairs. She
was discharged, drydnckeJ and repaired
and the port boat replaced. It is clinker
built and as pretty a model as ever left a
builder's hands. Captain Dyke is so proud
of its sailing qualities that he is willing to
wager a month's salary that there is not a
vessel in her class that can beat her ovÂ« r
an all-round course. In yachting circles
England and Canada nave been heard
from, but this b the first time that a New
Zealand boat ;.as put in nn appearance. A
race between her and the crack boat of the
Naval Reserve should be a pretty sight.
The race was between the boats from the
â¢RuthUowÃ, Genesta and Leicester Castle
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25. 1897.
and was over a straightaway course. Tbe
Rathdown's boat took tbe 'lead from the
start and easily held it to the finish. The
new crackajack ii twenty-four feet over all
and the apprentice-boys who man her are
just aching for a race. Captain Dyke
never thinks of taking a train for the mole,
as he says it is easy work to set into the
cutter, set sail aud beat both train and
steamer into San Franciscoâ when tbe
wind is fair.
The Bailors' Union will celebrate its
twelfth anniversary on the 6th of March
ii 1 xt. During its existence tbe organiza
tion ha-< met with several defeats, but nev
ertheless tbe sailor, owing to its work, is
now on a better footing than he ever was
before. Coast seamen have now a say in
the matter of shipping men and to the
Coast Seamen's Union tho cradit belongs.
On March 6, at 7:30 p. m., the parade will
start from the corner of Folsom and East
streets, and it is expected that there will
be at least 300 uniformed sailors in line.
From ther.ee they will march up East
street to the union headquarters, and men
to Market. From mere ibe men and tbe
kindred societies will march to Var. Ness
avenue, wbere the sailors will counter
march and return to headquarters. As
the procession will be p-ecedatl by a brass
buna and each sailor will carry a torch tbe
parade should be a pretty one*
Powell-street wharf has been declared
dangerous. As before stated in Tiie Call
It was built at enormous expense to tbe
State ani never earned enough to keep it
in repair. Now the tides and tbe toreuoes
have got in their work and the piles are
giving way, the wbart is sagging ana the
Chief Wharfinger has reported that the
sooner it h removed the better. So the
end of a wharf which cost the State over
$60,000 is near at hand and the question
will again be asked. Where did the money
go to?
Commissioner Cole's term of office will
expire in a few weeks, and as he has tbe
naming of several collectors and wharf
ingers whose time expires with bis he is
in a quandary. There are ualf a hundred
applications for the different places, but
"Uncle Dan" ennnot decide upon any one.
The majority of the boardâ Colnon and
Chadbourne â are against him in some of
ins appointments and be cloas not know
just where he stands. Thomas Casey, the
collector at Freernont street, has reMcned,
anrt it is certain that he will succeed W.
K. Cooney as wharfinger at Clay street.
This is President Colnon's appointment
and it is therefore not necessary to say
that Casey is a Democrat and Cooney a
Republican.
GAS ENDED HIS LIFE.
Suicide of Alexander Garraneaa, an
Aged Frenchman, Who Asked
to Be Cremated.
Alexander Gnrraneau, an aged French
man, committed suicide by turning on
thegason Tuesday evening at his lodg
ings, 317 Golden Gate avenue. The body
was found yesterday by Mrs. Moden, with
whom he boarded, and was taken to tbe
Morgue.
The deceased left several letters stating
that it was his intention to end his lite,
but giving no definite reason for so doing!
One letter was addressed to the Mayor
s:ating that he wished to be cremated and
that he did not desire to have his name
or picture In the newspapers.
He wrote that he has no relatives in
this country nor fritnds, bayond the peo
ple with whom be boarded, and that he
ile-iredto be cremated with as little cere
mony as possible. He left a letter for his
landlady, in which he asked her to keep
bis trunk and other belongings as tokens
of friendship and as compensation for un
paid room rent
From other letters that were found
among bis effects it appears that Garra
neau recently came to tois City from Salt
Lake, and that he was by occupation a
retoucher. He was evidently not lacking
in opportunities for work, for letters were
found from various persons offering him
employment.
Struck by a Beam.
Clement Richardson, a laborer living on
Cortiand avenue and Hanover street, was
engaged yesterday in tearing down an old
bulldinc on Beale street when a large beam
struck him. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where it was lound that his skull
aud spine were possibly fractured and his
lower limbs were paralyzed.
WHEELMEN TO BE
ASKED TO HELP
They May Contribute to
the Boulevard
Fund.
Ex-Mayor Ellert Made This
Suggestion at Yesterday's
M3eting.
Finance and Execu ive Relief Com
mittees Are at Work District
ing the City.
The executive and finance committees
recently nominated by William M.
Bunker, the chairman of the general re
lief committee, met according to appoint
ment in the rooms of the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday afternoon and be
gan the neceqpary work of dividing the
City into convenient districts and prepar
ing provisional lists of various sub-com
mittees to canvass particular industries,
trades and professions for subscriptions.
The boulevard scheme was incidentally
discussed, and it was stated that both the
Spring Valley Water Works Company
and ex-Mayor Entro havesigned the deeds
conferring the necessary right of way
through their property. There is, there
fore, every reason to believe that an actual
be 8 inning will be made on the work of
construction at an early date.
Among the gentlemen present yesterday
when Chairman Hunker called the meet
ing to order were: L. R. Ellert, H. J.
Crocker, Hugh Craig, C. W. McAfee,
Lippman Sachs, Louis Slost Jr., J. C.
Johnson and the secretary, Charles Fay.
L. R. Ellert wÂ»? appointed chairman of
the executive committee, and at once ad
dressed himself to the immediate object of
the meeting, expressing the hope that
they might be successful in building the
boulevard. He suggested that ttie first
order of business would be to map out a
plan of finance.
Hugh Craig said it would be well to bear
Mr. O'Connor's report with reference to
the rigbt-ot-way deeds.
Mr. O'Connor stated that both docu
ments had been signed and were in the
Mayor's possession, and that hÂ« (Mr.
O'Connor) would have another conference
with ex-Mayor Butro at 3 o'clock. Tnere
would be no trouble whatever in this con
nection. The route was arranged and the
grades were fixed. He expected that the
deeds would be ready to present to-morrow
(Thursday).
The chairman inquired as to the extent
of the right of way.
Air. O'Connor said that it was a mile and
a quarter long, from the Almshouse to the
Trocadero and about 103 feet wide, so that
there would be work enough for the men
provided the necessary subscriptions wero
forthcoming.
Mr. Bunker urged that the first thing to
be done was to raiss money, and that the
method previously adopted would proba
bly be found best on this occasion. Twenty
blankhooks had been prepared for collec
tion purposes. The City should oe dis
tricted and the principal corporations,
especially the banks and insurance com
panies, should all be allotted committees
in preference to the usual practice of leav
ing these to the finance committee. These
canvassing committees must be made up
at once; questions concerning deeds and
titles were secondary considerations.
Nothing whatever could be accomplished
without monÂ«y. He moved that the
finance committee be requested to district
the City and name the varioui canvassing
committees for those districts. He added,
before the motion had been seconded,
that A. L. Baldwin could not attend the
present meeting owing to an engagement,
but had assured the speaker that he was
in complote sympathy with the work and
mi- f ht be counted upon to assi9t.
H. J. Crocker agreed with Mr. Bunker.
The collector appointed would be asfced a
great many questions, and it was only
riiht and proper to be able to show what
they proposed to do. At yesterday's
meeting they advocated the boulevara.
The unemployed now expected to get
work, and intimations lad been received
that many of them would flock in from
the country, though this contingency
had been to some extent guarded against
by requiring applicants to show rroof of
three months' residence. The committee,
l>e argued, should have some idea of the
amount it proposed to pay tbe men.
There was present, he added, a gentle
man, Drury Melone, who bad haa a great
deal of experience in the hiring of men in
the country, and could thereiore inform
them as to the sentiment aroused there
by the action of Ban Francisco, in so far
as this might be construed as likely to
attract labor from the country and create
dissensions between the farmer and his
men.
Before Mr. Melone complied with this
request the meeting unanimously carried
Mr. Bunker's motion. Mr. Melone then
said that he had been tai&ing with two
members of the committee, and had point
ed out that ihe first question asiced would
be, "How much will you pay these men?"
He himself, for example, if approached
for a subscription, would want to know
this. He had assured his hearers that if
they prÂ»ve the men more than the farmer
could afford to pay labor would be invited
here to an indefinite extent. If less were
offered, then the men would, perhaps, ap
ply to the farmer, and he thought that
labor should be induced to co into the
country. It was true that washes were de
pressed and lower than ever before in the
history of California, but thest- conditions
had to be met, tnongh ho begged his hear
ers not to quote him as being m favor of
any lower wage? than the absolute neces
sity of the occasion demanded and com
pelled.
He was confronted two or three years ago,
when a large sum was raised for the re
liof of the unemployed, with the statement
advanced by workingmen that they could
make more in tbe City than upon tne
farm. It was, therefore, necessary to con
sider this aspect of tbe question â to>stim
ulate the workman's pride and allow him
to earn something by his own industry.
They might communicate with tbu farm
ers and find many men they could take
and at what wages. He did not think,
however, that there was a single farmer
who could pay more than 50 cents a day
and board, and then there was not one out
of twenty men who would earn as
much as would repay his employer.
But something mn-t be done, or tbe w hole
structure of society would fall in pieces
and chao3 would ensue. In conclusion he
repeated that he was in favor of just the
highest wa^es that could be paid if they
knew where the money was coming from.
"But," hr said, "Jo not do anything in
sucb a way us to enter into competition
with a class that must be supported or
none of us could live."
Mr. Bunker emphasized the serious na
ture of the situation. He thought they
should Â»ro aheau with the money proposi
tion. "If," he said, "we are asked ques
tons we can say we are raising money to
provide work for the unemployed. They
are here by the thousand ami must be pro
vided lor. They are acting straighior
wardly and have asked our assistance.
Here we have a chance to obtain a perma
nent improvement, as well as assist the
poor. Tuat answers, 1 think, every ques
tion we expect to be ask Ad. As to what
wages we will pay that depends entirely
upon the funds we get. We want to make
the money go as far as possible. We are
not prepared to discuss wages at this stage
of the proceedings, and 1 do not under
stand that there is a dollar in the hands
of the treasurer to-day."
Mr. Crocker remarked that about $2000
had been subscribed.
Lippman Sachs said that precautions
would be taken to confine relief to City
re-sctents.as formally, and that Mr. Melone
need have no anxiety on that score. For
a man with a family a dollar a day would
be little enough.
Mr. Melone offered to engage five men
at 50 cents a day and board on the under
standing that they would be perfectly at
liberty to leave him the moment they
could" better themselves;
Hugh Craig thought that Labor Com- i
missioner Fitzgerald should be notitiei to
tli is effect at once.
Louis Sloss Jr. thought that no general
advantage could accrue from this pro
posal. It would siiunly take a few men
out of town for a short time and neces
sitate their return again, perhaps, without
money to bring them back. It would be
better to keep them here, where tfiey be
longed.
"Our remarks," said Mr. Craig,
"do not apply to family men, but
to single men. If there are 1500 un
married men who will not accept an offer
of this kind they deserve to starve, and I
will not collect money for those who are
capable of refusing such an offer. If the
single mpn can be provided for in that
way they should thank God for it."
Ihe chairman here made a valuable
suggestion to the effect that the wheel
men of the City should be asked to con
tribute something to the boulevard.
"We have no good road leading out of
the City," he said, "except the San Bruno
road, which ia only good for six months
in the year; and the Mission road, wnere
the grades are too steep. lam quite sure
that if the 20,000 wheelmen in this City
knew that the boulevard would be made
so a to afford an out.et, they would con
tribute very liberally. I think that two or
three of them should be put on the com
mittee to solicit funds."
The importance of Mr. Ellert's sugges
tion was generally recognized and steps
will probably be taken in this direction.
The executive committee then adjourned
and the finance committee met for the
puipoies stated in Mr. Bunker's motion.
The secretary informed the committee
that he had received Irom Mayor Phelan
a letter addressed to the latter
from J. W. Anderson, president of
the San Francisco Dry-goods Baseball
League, which stated that the league
would play a series of thirty games during
1807 and had decided to make the open
ing game a benefit for the unemployed
fund. The league ieit sure that the game
would attract 4000 people, whicn, at 25
cents each, meant a large sum of money.
The league desired the committee to name
one or more parties to co-operate with it
and :or itself guaranteed the sale of 1200
tickets.
No immediate action was taken, beyond
instructing the secretary to acknowledge
ibe letter.
The committee proceeded to map out
the City into districts and to draft a list of
sub-committees to canvass among other
special departments the following:
B:mks, insurance, Produce Exchange, City
Hall, butchers, real estate, Stock and Bond
Exchange, Bar Association, transportation
companies, lumber, wine and theaters.
Mr. Bunker afterward moved that the
committee appeal to the public to meet
the demands of immediate necessity t>y
sending supplies of all kinds to the head
quarters of the unemployed as soon as
possible. In tne case of money donations
subscribers are warned not to mate the
same to any save properly authorized
committees.
W. J. Martin of the South San Francisco
Laud and Improvement Company desired
to confer with the committee on behalf of
San Mateo on the subject of the proposed
boulevard, but was referred to the boule
vard committee.
The meeting adjourned with the under
standing that the finance committee will
meet again at 11 o'clock this morning and
the executive committee at 3 p. M. to com
plete the appointment of the sub-commit
tees.
â¢ The unemployed headquarters yester
day presented the usual scene of bustle
and activity. There are now nearly 1400
names on ibe register and the cry is "still
they come." Apart lrom the men who
are supported on the premises the organi
zation is provisioning fifty outside fami
lies, which are in immediate need, and its
committee on lamily relief is kept con tin
ualy busy investigating additional appli
cations for this kinu of assistance. The
commissariat wagon was out yesterday,
and in the course of its travels through
South San Francisco collected, among
other food supplies, five sacks of potatoes,
SOU pounds of meat, two Â«acks of flour, a
sack of beans and 75 pounds of pigsfeet.
Walter Morosco hus donated nfty
pounds of coffee and two whole sheep,

Deep Harbor Commission
Has Arrived at an
Agreement.
Morgan the Only Member Who
Favors Santa Monica's
Selection.
Sinator White Notifies His Friend?,
Who Are Quietly Makin?
â¢ . Investments.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 24.â Private
letters and telegrams have been received
here by some of the most confidential
friends of Senator White, from his private
secretary, which indicate beyond the
shadow of a doubt that the Board of
Harbor ComniLtsioners has agreed almost
â unanimously in favor of San Fedro as the
site for the deep-sea harbor for Southern
California. The findings of the board
have not yet been formulated into a re
port, but according to the information re
ferred to the members of this comra ission,
by a vote of four to one, nave selected San
Pedro. This decision settles every issue
respecting a deep-sea harbor on the South
ern Coast, and secures the Congressional
appropriation of $3,000,000, already pro
vided for by an act last May. Nothing is
now in the wav of the expenditure of this
sum of money for the purpose Indicated.
It is said that Commissioner Morgan
only, out ol the five members, favored
Santa Monica.
A prominent member of the Los
Angeles county bar said to a Call cor
respondent to-day that he had seen a
telegram from Senator White himself,
sent yesterday, which left no doubt in his
mind that the report would locate thÂ«
harbor at San Pedro. A prominent
official of the Los Angeles Terminal
Railway Company, which has been in the
thick of the fight from the start, said
to-day :
"I am not at liberty to give you par
ticulars nor the source of my informa
tion, but I tell you that I am absolutely
certain that San Pedro has been agreed
upon for the deep harbor."
Other sources of information were care
fnlly investicated by a Call correspond
ent to-day, and every bit of intelligence on
the subject confirms the foregoing state
mo nt.
Dr. Hill of San Pedro, a leading physi
cian and Democratic worker of that sea
port town, lias been in this city for two
days arranging the details of a real estate
syndicate to bond or purchase large tracts
of land in his town. In couversation
the gentleman said:
"Our town is alive with activity in every
direction. We are in the midst of the
greatest boom ever known in the history
of the. place. Keal estate is chancing
bands in such rapid succession as to be
lairly bewildering. I purchased a small
tract two weets ago, for which I paia
$1800. I have been offered $5000 for it and
refused the offer. You may judtre by
these things as to what we expect in the
way of a decision by the Board of Harbor
Commissioners."
No man in Southern California, per
haps, is more close to Senator White than
John T. Gaffey, Collector o? Port at Sjn
Pedro. Ii any man in California has
White's confidence in the fullest sense, it
is Gaffey. He is at the head of a syndi
cate which has bonded large tracts :n and
around the town, in addition to this.
Gaffey's company has procured a fran
chise to operate an electric street railway
in the town and a city water system.
These things have their significance, and
In this instance they indicate that the
astute Senator aud his closest friends are
not averse to turning a Dennv to good
account, for it is believed that White him
self is directly and financially interested
in all the operations wherein Collector
Gaffey is now so prominent.

PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS.
Bill Providing lor an Annuity Fund Given
a Large Majority in the
Assembly.
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. Feb. 24.â Jones
of Sau Francisco heaved a s-igh of relief
when the Assembly this evening finally
passed the teachers' annuity pension fund
bill. H felt that he could return to San
Francisco at tue close of the session and
face the smiling schoolmarms, who would
rise up and cah him a good old darling.
To the surprise of almost every one,
there were several very bitter opponents
of the bill. Â£oone of Tulare was one of
these. He read a resolution from the Tu
lare Grange and a protest from teacners of
Tulare County ngainst any legislation of
that kind. He also read a resoiution
passed by A. J. Piilsbury and the Grand
Jury of Tulare County obj"Cting to the
pensioning of school teachers.
"When you say that the teachers are
workine for the Â«ood of humanity you are
PHj'ing something that is not true," said
Mr. Uoone. "They are working for dol
lars and tents, like* everybody else. They
have good salaries and should be ab.'e to
provide a retirement fund of their own on
wliich to live."
Leavitt of Alameda also opposed the bill
because it obliged County Treasurers to be
custodians of the funds and District At
torneys to prosecute suits on behalf of
Claimants thereto.
Emmons of Kern made a ringine speech
in favor of the measure and referred to the
fact that in many counties District Attor
neys took private cases and accepted fees
for the same.
Jones of San Francisco explained that
the biil did not propose to tax the people
one cent.
Tlie Mil was finally passed by a vote of
52 to 10.

NEW BONANZA
0N THE RAND
Los Angeles Capitalists
Buy the Famous St.
Elmo Mine.
Broad Ledge Which in Places
Assays One Dollar to the
Pound of Ore.
The Purchase Price $250,000, and De
velopment Work Wiil Be Done
at Once.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 24.â The
largeet mining deal ever recorded in
Randsburg consisted of the sale two days
ngo of the famous St. Elmo mine owned
and worked by Bogwardt, Pyle and Douil
lard. The property now passes into the
hands of a corporation with headquarters
in this city and of which William Fereu
son is president, J. F. Turner vice-presi
dent and M. W. Turner secretary. Other
members of the company are Ceptain
Thomas C. G. North. M. J. Eraisdel and
E. H. Gould, all of Los Angeles.
D. M. Pyle, one of tue owners, was
taken into the directory, and the name of
the corporation was chbiged to the St.
Elmo Mining and Water Company. The
consideration at which tbe St. Elmo was
taken is understood to be $250,000. The new
company starts out under the most favor
able auspices, with a mine which at
present is second to none in the Rand
district, and is regarded by many exper
ienced miners as the best property there,
with men of capital behind it to push all
ordinary development work without the
sale of stock, and in a locality easy of ac
cess and only twenty miles from Kramer,
on the Santa Fe Railroad.
For the present the purpose of the com
pany is to sink a double compartment
shaft at some point on the ledge to a
depth sufficient to fully develop the mine,
and for the additional purpose of obtain
ing water, which will probably be reached
at 300 feet, or certainly before going 500,
which is now the depth proposed. They
do not intend to mill any ore for the
present, and if they strike water sufficient,
works will be put up on the mine and the
ore can be milled at a minimum cost,
thus saving the cost of transportation,
with the additional loss of from $10 to $15
on every ton run off into the tallines.
This ledge has been prospected and
shafts sunk in eight different places long
distances apart, and ore milled from ail
of them, with the lowest return of $33 per
ton, while selected ore has run as high as
$1 per pound. The ledge at a depth of
eighty feet has never shown less width
than two feet, while it has been ten and
twelve feet in some place?, and in one
place at the surface it is thirty feet wide.
It has been located for 6000 feet and that
is the length included in this deal. There
are two parallel ledges, distant from the
main ledge 200 and 280 feet. These bave
been prospected in a number of places and
show as rich ore as the main led.-c. The
St. Elmo is a strong vein of ore, lying out
on the open, level desert, with no high
hills near, and gives every indication of
being a true hssr.re vein and will doubt
less prove a bonanza to the new owners
if properly managed.

DIED IN THE BLACK ABYSS.
Frank Monahan, a Nevada Miner, Fell 335
FeÂ«t and His Body Was Horribly
Mangled.
VIRGINIA, Nbv., Feb. 24.â A mining
accident, attended with details of excep
tional horror, occurred at tlie Savage mine
about 3 o'clock tuis afternoon. Frank
Monahan, a well-known and respected
miner, met with an awful deatb.
Wiih two companions, Dennis Sullivan
and W. H. Thomas, Monahan was en
gaged in repairing the shaft between the
400 and 500 level. The men stood on a
platform of two-inch planks placed across
the shaft. Ordinarily but one platform is
used, but the awful accident which oc
curred in the same shaf t just a month ago,
when William Byrne was Killed, had the
effect of inspiring unusual caution among
sbattmen, and they had an extra platiorra
placed below the one on which they were
working in order to catch them should
they Jail.
They had finished with one set of tim
bers and were raising the lower platform
about rive feet above their heads, with the
intention of repairing the part of the shaft
just overhead, when Monahan sprang to
one side 10 make room for the last plank
to be rais-ed. He lit with apparently a
secure foothold upon one of the thnbars
just inserted in the side of the shaft, but a
moment later his two companions were
horrified to see him piich forward and dis
appear througu a three-foot opening in the
platlorm into the black abyss below.
Monahan's companions immediately
gave the signal to hoist and were taken to
the top, where they were joined by the
foreman, and descended into the shaft to
search for MonaÃnn : 8 body. They found
it at the 850-foot level. 335 feet below the
platform from which Monahan had fallen.
A few planks had been placed across the
shaft at this place and Monahan had
fallen on them. His body was horribly
mangled. Not n bone was left unbroken,
the top of his head was gone, his nose was
broken, Â«nd through a great gaping
wound in the back both kidneys dropped
out as soon as his clothing was removed.
Monahan was a highly respected and
popular citizen. He was prominent in
silver party politics and represented
Storey County in the State Assembly
some years ago. He was a native of Ire
land, aged about 45, and leaves a widow
and five children.

DENOUNUED AS " OINOHES."
Local Business Men Bitterly Oppose
Two Assembly Bills.
There was an important conference yes
terday between a committee of the San
Francisco Board of Trade and the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association in
the Board of Trade rooms. The object of
1 tlio gathering was to discuss bills 546 and
547. now before the Legislature.
The first is an act requiring manufac
turers to stamp upon their products on
manufactured wares an indication of the
kind of labor employed and the plan of
manufacture. The penalty tor violating
the proposed law was fixed by fines not
less thnn $50 nor more than $500 and mx
months' imprisonment.
The other bill proposes to compel em
ployers to furnish surgical and medical
attendance to employes injured during
workim; hours in mills, factories, ship
yards, foundries and other places where
machinery is used or forfeit a penalty of
three times the value of the medical
service required.
From the beginning of the session these
two measures were roundly denounced as
cinch bills of the worst order. The state
ment was made that at tHS present time
the Pacific Coast manufacturers are
hampered in dozens of unnecessary ways
and that it is a shame to add further
stumbling blocks to the manufacturing
industries.
Resolutions condemning the bills were
passed and last evening letters were sent to
all the Assemblymen unking them to kill
the bills before ihey go further. The bills
have slipped through tho second reading
already.

MEAT INSPECTION
IS SET ASIDE
Four Large Abattoirs Make
an Interesting De
parture.
The Department of Agriculture
Granted an Earnest
Petition.
Consent "Wa? Based on the Statement
That TJiÂ«y Are Not Engaged
in Exportasin.
A move which will occasion some sur
prise among butchers and provision deal
ers has reached a culminating point within
the last two days. This is nothing less
than the removal of t c Government meat
inspection from four large abattoirs in
this City, owned respectively by Miller &
Lux, Moffat:, Horn & Judge and James
Hall. The ordera were received by Mr.
Barker, chief of the service in this City,
two days ago. On Tuesday the inspectors
were removed from duty at the first three
places named. Yesterday the meat in
spection at James Hall's place came to an
end.
This action came about through a peti
tion which was forwarded by the farms
concerned some time ago to Dr. D. E.
Salmon, Chief of the Bureau of Animal
Industry of the United States Department
of Agriculture at Washington. This peti
tion set forth in substance that the firms
were concerned only in killing for the lo
cal trade and that they were not engaged
in the export or interstate trade. The in
spection of the Government applies only
to meat for exportation.
Before the inspection was instituted
t! ese firms had to make application to
the Secretary of Agriculture. Thereupon
the United States sent the proper in
spectors, who under the law and regula
tions for the inspection of livestocK and
their products, wera compelled, when all
the conditions were complied with, to
issue certificates and tags and stamps,
showing whether the meat inspected was
for export or for the interstate trade. A
daiiy report waa returned to the depart
ment concerning all inspections.
No teason other than that given in the
petition is assigned for the action of the
tour lirma named. Mr. Barker said yester
day: "T;ie retail butchers will feel this
exclusion from inspection; first, for the
reason that when a butcher buys a car
cass, or a quarter, his trade calls lor only
a part of th;s quantity. The remainder
must be disposed of to packers for sau
sage, for canning and so on. But meat
killed at abattoirs where therÂ« is. no Gov
ernment inspection cannot be stamped o\
tagged for cxi ortation or for the inter
state trade. I'he removal of the Govern
ment inspection, which wns only for the
special purposes named, does not inter
fere with or set as)de the health inspec
tion by the ioeftl au horit.es."

The Ultimata Destination of the Qu er
Voyage Some M Â«nd Where
Life Is Eisy.
Faith ia the principal portion of the car
co that the brig Percy Edwards will carry
with it on the voyage the managers of the
South- Sea colonization scheme contem
. plate starting out on to-rtay. Of course
mere will be some 150 tons of iive and dead
irÂ«ight stowed away in various nooks and
coiners Id the vessel, but this is a very un
important matter as compared with the
btnign confidence those on buard have in
the "future.
It is i faith that knows no doubt or mis
giving.
. â 'â .Somewhere down in the South Pacific
t re is a haicyon island where poverty
4 har.i work are unknown," is the creed
Xaat inspires, it. Even the dogs and the
tats in the forecastle have become imbued
with this* star it. The brig is scheduled to
Bail some time this morn ing, according to a
programme decided upon late yesterday
aiternooM.
The clearance papers yesterday issued
to Captain Petersen in the name of the
United Brotherhood of the South Sea Isl
ands de-ignate Levuka, in the Fiji group
of islands, as the destination of the voy
age. From that point Caotain Pelersen
announce! he will proceed to Bougain Isl
â aiid in the Solomon group. Ueyond this
all is haze and mist. The expedition then
loses itself anywhere in the coral dotted
ocean if the word of those who are nianas
in-j-it is to be taken seriou-iy.
There are provisions aboard the vessel
sufficient to feed the voyiigers for one
y-ear. In all there are jusi 100 men in the
crowd. They hail from all point-- j-ionz
ti;p coast and embrace alruos'. ever? trade
and profession. There is one notable va
cancy, and, considering the co-operative
side of of the affair, it is an important one.
There is no shoemaker in their number.
Of those who have decided to cast their
fortune with this chimerical expedition
the majority are young men from the in
terior town?. They hail from the farms
of the Willamette and the San Joaquin
Valleys, from the orange groves of the
' south, and men from tne desolate prairies
of Stales east of the Kocky Mountains.
They comprise almost every creed and na
tionality, although Germany has the pref
erence. As a class the men seem indus
trious and ambitious, but it is their won
derful hope in the future of the venture.
.;n spite of all logical deductions to the
contrary, that is their chief characteristic.
Of thoae who win sail but two men
aboard have any accurate knowledge of
\iSe topography and geography of t tie re
gion they are going to. Tne remainder ]
have crude notions of Jife in the tropics, j
Tlie South Seas to them is a laud of ro- j
l nrance and pleasant living. True, once \
' and a while one of them awakes to a reali- !
zation that the scene there may not be as ;
iair as it has been painted, but Fuch |
vagaries are speedily dispelled by some
companion.
It b the strangest voyage that ever was
planned â as strange and as o^d as the
motley and fantastic crew that go to make
up its promoters. There is a disorder and
h vagueness about it all that is inspiring
in these days of business and hard com
mon-sense. The men seem, for the most
1 art, to be boys that have cavorted about
v.iih unsuccesh, and prefer a beautiful un
certainty to a plain and prosaic reality.
General Manager Reinhart is the only
man aboard from present indications who
â¢ will get a run for his money. Reinhart
has up to date received some $10,000 in
contributions from the volunteer^ to the
venture.. The brie cost him but $2500, and
even after repairs and supplies are paid
for, there is still quite a snug sum lest in
the treasury, wnicn in this instance
means Reinnart's pocketbook. So it goes
without saying that the promoter of the
scheme. ls enthusiastic over its prospective
le.-ults.
For a time yesterday there were indica
tions of a mutiny in the poetical sur
loundingÃ ol the expedition. A young
rancher from Stanislaus County was told
Hint beans was a s'aple crop in the South
Seas, and this was not to his fancy. V.a
ions of hard labor with little profits on a
bean ia:ru flitted through his mind, and
he demanded the return ol his money.
This feeling was contagious, and soon
half a dozen of the colonists were on the
joint of deserting the ship and taking
chances in California again.
A search was made for Reinhart, but for
reasons .best Jcnown to himself, the pro
mdter of the expedition failed to put in
an appearance during the day. First
Mate Kigffs, however, managed to allay
the discontent by a disseitation on bread
fruit and bananas, and last night the re
calcitrant members of the enterprise were
dreaming of a balruv and indolent exist
ence in the Sou'.h Seas.
tThe provisions and general supplies
-ye Deen paid for out of the funds col
d by Rt-inbart. Each member of the
however, has laid in some
extras on his own account. In the item
of firearms and ammunition, a Kesrny-
B'reet store sold stock to-the amount of
$1400 to the Percy Edwards' passenger
i.st. These arms were purchased with a
view of mixiiiir up with cannibals. Tha
baggage list comprises some queer articles.
An Italian, who hails from Stoc&ton, took
with bim as his possession a fiddle and a
ten-gallon demijohn oi cheap claret.
At 5 o'ciock lust night the vessel was
rractically loaded. The day had been
consumed in stowing away baggage and
jrovi-ions. All day long a steuuy stream
of express wagons drove on to the Liule
Main-street wharf loaded down with
household furniture, trunks, valise*,
stoves, cooking utensils and such like.
Each man took a personal interest in the
disposition of his own baggage, but once it
was consigned to the hoia it b.carce com
mon property. Trunks, stoves, mattreste.",
wirebeds and rubber boots were piled
t romiscuously on top of each other.
'1 here was no system observed in this part
â  f the preparation for the voyage. By
night the nold was p. confused mass of
haega^e, lumber and agricultural itnpie
nients, jammed together without any pre
tense a^ lash ng. The first heavy 9<?a that
the brig encounters will make lively times
below decks at least. The rgriculturnl
implements include several plows, harrows
ana cultivators. These are to be used, so
the colonists say, in tilling the land of th?
island they will cast their lot with. There
are dogs and cats without number scat
tered about decks.
j The brig is 189 tons net and but 104 feet
ling, consequently Reinhart and his fo'-
Vowers find their new quarters none too
upaciou*. In fact, the matter of sleeping
accommodati ns has been a source of much
worry. The cabin has bean provided with
bunks at the expense of the cubic air recu
lattons. In the stern an additional house
has been boll?, equipped with a cooking
palley, where mor* bunks have been con
structed. Below in the hold the remainder
of the crowd will sleep as best they can.
Xhe crew of the vessel will consist of six

teen sailors. Like every body else on board,
they too have a lars?e *tock of faith, for
their wages for the most part consist of
prospective profit* tn the South Seas. The
hiehest-salaried officer aboard is the first
officer, who will receive 75 cents per month.
Four cabin-boys signed for -3 cents a
month. The rank and tile of the crew will
work for 60 cents a month. There will be
a boatswain, cockswain and many other
petty officers at cabin-boy wages.
Captain Pet^rsen expects to reach
Le7uka within sixty day?. From tliat
point to the Solomon Islands is over 1500
miles in a northwesterly direction, and
the course is tortuous with islands and
coral reefs. Here all definite ideas ot the
voyage end, but with the beat of weather
over 100 days will be spent in getting
this far.
Somewhere in the vague ideas that
Moat through the brains of the promoters
of the expedition they have a plan to
drop a portion ot the expedition on one
island and the vessel is then to proceed to
a second island and land the remainder.
Reinhar: had a lucid interval ye^t-rday
long enough to realize that he and his
colonists would probably have some diffi
culty in landing anywhere in the South
beas without the consent of the authori
ties that be. Almost every island in that
resion is under the protectorate of either
England, France or Germany.
By way of petting a ii tile information
along tin so lines lieinhart called on Brit
ish Consul Warburlon to learri that he
would have to consult the British Governor
at Suva if lie wisned to locate ti is regi
ment of adventurers in either the Fiji or
Solomon proups. German Consui Ro*en
tual was sought; for nformation about
Xew Guinea, wtiich is one of the prospec
tive promised lands, and he told his callers
that permission to settle there must be ob
tained from the "New Guinea Associa
tion." It is in the programme of the ex
pedition, if stress of circumstances should
warrant it, to place itself by means of a
declaration of naturalization under the
protection of sora3 of the foreign protec
torates to better aid in any struggles with
natives. Once the passengers are safely
landed Captain Petersen and Reinhart say
they will return to San Francisco with a
cargo of mahogany. They then anticipate
taking a second installment of colonists to
the South Sea 9.
Reinhart says he has now over 1800 ap
plications for berths on the vessel. He has
organized his colonization scheme into an
incorporated society, with a permanent
secretary and office in the Mills block.
What the outcome of the exposition
wiil be ia a matter of interesting conjec
ture. The scuerue owes its inception to a
fake story in a sensational morning news
paper about an island in the South Pacihc
that was desolate of men by reason of war
and "blackbirdinr." This weird narrative
declared that the crew o! a passing ship
bad been entreated by the great numbers
of lonesome women to remain and marry
them. There were other like embellish
ments and the "Adamiess Eden" island
began to be taken sersonÂ«ly for a time.
Subsequently the myth was exploded in
the newspapers, Reinhart, so it 13 said,
at first had in vlÂ»w the idea of supplying
tne dusky and husband-Hungry females
with mates. Subsequently, when the
story was exploded, he changed the char
acter by calling it a "colonization scheme."
W hat the end of ;t will be remains to be
seen.

It is anticipated by the leaders of tbe
Cuban sympathizers in this City that the

but a majority will be there, and as all

evening.
Suggestions as to the plans that will
help the cause coma from sources outside
the City every day, and all axe given cart
ful attention that they may be utilized
should the league, when fully organized,
ses fit to use them.
D. Â£. Bohannon of Sacramento, who has
shown an active interest in the league
ever since it was organized by Messrs.
Jones and Mascberini, wrote to the secre
tary suggesting a plan for bringing the
sentiment of the people of San Francisco
to the attention of Congress. His letter
is as follows:
Sacramento, Cal., Feb. 22, 1897.
Fauat Matchtrini, Secretary Cuban League,
!006 Mason street, San Francisco, CaI.â IJEAR Sir:
1 desire to submit the following to your hon
orable body as * suggestion.
That your league secure the co-opsration of
similar leagues throughout the country to
follow a plan similar to the one herein sug
gested, viz. :
That Cuban leagues in the United States,
each :n 111 respective locality, secure the aid
of some leading newspaper in circulating, and
securing signatures to a petition similar to the
attached copy, and have said petition*, at
tested by the proper officers of leagues, for
warded to Representatives at Washington.

The form of petition forwarded with Mr.
Bohannon's letter reads as follows:
Ban Francisco, Cal., Feb 1897.
To Washington, D. C
In the name of liberty, justice and human
ity, we imrjore yon to us* your influence in
urging Congress to recognize the indepen
dence of Cuba, to the end that the Govern
ment of tlie United States take immediate ac
tion in endeavoring to bring about a speedy
termination of hostilities in that island; also
to tike proper steps in behalf of American
citizens now tn Cuban dungeons, as well .is to
redress the wrongs oi those who have been un
fairly dealt with by Spanish authorities In
Cuba. And we ever pray, etc.
Signed
Several men. some of them well-known
in this City, called on Secretary Mnscher.ni
of the league yesterday and offered to
serve on the committee, but as Mayor
The an has already appointed the body
and thus sienined whom he wishes to serve
the secretary did not feel at liberty to add
more names. All wera invited to attend
the meeting to-morrow night, however, as
it is desired to get the advice of as many
sympathizers as possible.
It is hoped to have Professor Brown of
Stanford University, who has been organ
izing a branch league in the great institu
tion of learning, present to address the
committee, and also at the mass-meeting
that is to be called. In addition to Gen
eral Barne-i a number of prominent local
orators will address the gathering.
The news of Consul-General Lee's resig
nation as the chief representative of the
United States in Cuba has raised high
bopes in the breasts of tbe sympathizers
in this City that bit course will lorce the
present administration to take a decided
stand at once.
Thty feel confident that each succeeding
day brings the Cubans nearer to liberty,
and that ere long they will see a fulfill
ment of their long-cherished hoDes.

Stubbornly Cjntest.d F.nishes Marked
the Day's Sportâ Sir Richard
First at Olds of 20 to I
Ingleside track was the pleasure ground
yesterday to which thousands of ladies
found their way. The gate was lree to the
fair sex and besides it offered an oppor
tunity perchance to win a little pin
money. The weatber was warm and
balmy and the grand stand was crowded
almost to suffocation. Tbe lavorites were
in good form, winning lour of tbe seven
events run off, and tbe big tbrong filed
aboard tbe cars for borne in the very
brightest of spirits.
The sport was the best witnessed for
some days. Nearly all of tbe finishes were
stubbornly contested, keeping the occu
pants of the ttand in almost constant up
roar and excitement. Sir Richard en
livened the day's proceedings by talcing
the second race at odds of 20 to 1, and as
he was played to considerable extent
there was much joy among ins adherents.
The milfl handicap with six sporting
colors furuisheu one of the prettiest tin-
I lajiet of the afternoon. Ferrier waa a list
less sort of 0 to j favorite around post
time, the bulk of the coin bet apparently
going into the books on Instaiiator and
Ostler Joe. When sent away Ostler Joe
was allowed to set the pace for half the
distance, wh n Tod Sloan sent Ferrier ouc
in front. Thorpe on Instaiiator now
moved up, and, although riding his mount
hard, could not overhaul the hrst choice,
I who won by a head in 1:42^. Ostler
Joe took show honor;.
The first of the get of the dead Morello
carried silk to victory in the opening three
and a half furlong dash for two-year olds.
Morana, starting an 8 to 5 favorite over
the other eleven youngsters, collared Old
Jack at the paduock and won cleverly by
a length in :43& seconds. Sabaoth was a
distant third.
The gray horse Sir Kichard surprised
the crowd by talking the *ix-furlong purse
event that followed, after receding in the
betting from 6t020t0 1. He beaded (he
bunch before a quarter of the distance had
been covered and hard ridden at the end,
downed Br.uuetta who was coming fast
at the finish, a length. Camelia, the 8 to 5
Choice, was ihird.
The second two-year old scramble a(
three and a half furlongs was nothing but
a canter for Free Lady, the 9 to 10 favorite.
MaÂ»rane's hily jurnDed out in the lead,
and running unaer wraps all the way, ied
Aluminum out by neany a length. In a
hard drive On Gua Nita nosed out
| Moringa lor tue snow.
For the mile and a quarter hurdle event
Three Forks, carrying 181 pounds, was a
pronounced 1 to 2 favorite, with Recidiniz
ton next in demand at o to 2. The pair
had the race to theniselve- almost from
the start. In the siretcti HennesÂ«y gave
the favorite his head and, torginc to ihe
front. Purser's crack jumper won by three
lengths. Governor Buad was third, nboui

jump, was challenged at the paddock by
Perseus, the secoud choice, with Piggott
In t'.ie saddle, and. looking beaten forty
yards irom tne wire, snatched tne race
out of the coals the last jump, winning by
obiut four ?ncnes.

Jockey Spencer was fined $25 by StÃrter
Harvey for breaking through the barrier
with Irritator while the field was at the
post in tbe third race. The boys nad pre
viously been warned in the weigUine-room
to pay strict attention to the starter's in
structions.
Willie S^m* is once more in good stand
ing with the Incieside officials. Monday's
rating, which virtually banished him from
the tracK as far as appearing in the saddle
went, was modified yesterday to a fine of
$200 and suspension for ;hÂ« balance of the
meeting. "Jockey Bill" also apologized
to the officials for his ungentlemanly con
duct in t.':e scalesroom.
Several of the g-t of Morello have been
seen in public oi late, but Morana is the
first to earn brackets, She beat a very in
ferior iot yesterday and cave Blight im
pression of any stake form.
Fusil, a rather racy looking filly by Â£1
Ray o which started in the opening dasij,
is a half-sister to Fly, being from Fusi

up, and she looks as thnugti she might be
possessed of more speed than was distrib
uted about yesterday.
Ther* wa> an underground tip out on
imp. Disparity to win the second event.
The black Australian mare is a daughter
of Frying Pan and the coin bet slipped
out into the fire, for she failed to gel a
mark.
S nee the beginning of the mealing Mr.
Harvey's starling has been excellent and
yesterday was no exception. In the open
ing event the twelve two-year-olds were
dispatched in almost perfect alignment
witboui perceptible delay.
Formal would nave nad a merry old
time beating Ferrier yesterday. Mr.
Hunn's big chestnut horse retired very
early on Tuesday evening after partaking
of a very light supper, winch perhaps
accounted for the additional amount of
speed developed. Again, he is nut much
ot a weight-packer, never having been
asked in ihe East 10 carry over 140 pounds,
and the six pounds up irom the Formal
race worked up an exhilarating feeling
not unlike firewater in the stomach of a
Sioux Indian.
'Ostler Joe must have received sad news
from Montana previous to the handicap,
for after traveling half a mile he became
thoroughly disgusted with racing.
Wnoi a lunuy sort of a strawberry
headed little jockey J. Shield*, ibe son o:
Alex Shields, tno owner of Logan, is. He
seems to thorough y understand tne tem
perament of the horse Frank Juubert and
in turn Frank seems on very good term?
with his owner'-i son. One day Jaubert
will line up at the barrier, Jockey Shields
will oeat bis n>ld away and get in line.
Another day, Frank Jaubert comes out,
warms up good, the barrier flies up, little
strawberry- headed Shields appears in
some sort of a stupor, does a nula-buia
dance on the horses back, moves up to see
how good '.he third uorse is, falls back to
say something to the jockey ou the third
horse and just about that time the wire
slips around and Shields finds Himself
fourth. The story is a touching one of Â»
father's devotion to teach his boy to be
come a jockey.
When Formal, owned by H. Hunn, win
ner of the sixth'race, was put up to be sold,
Sam Dogcett raised him $300 over his
entered selling price of $500. Mr. Hunn
responded with ass bid an.i just to give
the owner a Â«care, President A. B. Spreck
els said $810. Another $5 bid sent the
horse back to his stable.
Greyhurst was up to one of his old tricks
and when the barrier sent the starters in
the handicap away, jumped backward and
was left.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, li.i,. Feb 24 âWheat was very doll
and prices lower this morning. The cessation of
the European war talk, which was very notice
able, deprived the bulls of the strongest cf their
arguments. That foreigners were also feeling
more at ease was evidenced by higher quotations
0:1 English consols from London and lower quota
tions on wheat from Liverpool, i Trade was so
light, however, that only narrow fluctuations too*
place and but moderate declines were noted. The
receipts at Chicago were 38 cars and 106,550
bushels were taken from store.
. The Northwest had 190 cars against 165 last
Wednesday and 441 a year ago. Brada'.reet's re
ported a decrease In the world's available stocks
of 796.000 bushels. The sinallness of this reduc
tion brought In some selling orders, ana prices
' slumped over a cent, continental cabUs were
â weak and lower. Export clearances were light
at 212.920 bushels. May wheat opened from 76c
to /B e, sold between 75i/i,c andl73%c,closlngat
74G474i B e, lVi@ls/ 8 c under yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 12 cars. No. 2 red Â»pot
wheat ranged from 82% cto 85y 2 c, closed about
83@94c.
CoKNâ The confidence shown In the corn mar
ket yesterday was absent to-day. The St. Louis
operator of considerable prominence who naare-
t Ct-ntly been doing Â»ome heavy buying was not in
the market to any fxlent to-day. A large "short"
line was covered yesterday, thus removing that
support from the market, and under the circum
stances little life and leÂ«s strength was apparent.
Wheat belne easy was another adverse factor.
Heceipts. 312 cars, were '23 more than expected,
and <4,â¬07 bushels were takÂ»n f m ore. Liv
erpool cables were quiet and steady. There was a
dec Ine when wheat brone. uo support being ap
parent. Bradstreets gave an increase in stock of
1.421.000 bushe s. Exports were large at 620,508
bushels. May corn opened at 245/ ac, sold between
241/2 and 241,4 c closing at the Inside, i/ 4 c under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 125
cars
OATSâ Most of the tradlnT In May oa'fi during
the morning was at 17V 4 @l7a^c, a fractional loss
from yesterday's clcsmg T..e receipts were b 4
cars over the estimate, 404 cars arriving. Wea -
ness was partly due to this, but lhe action of
wheat and corn was of more impnrianre. With
diawals from store were 12.43U bushels. P'tlcei
lined luriher when iheo.her markets collapsed
Kxpon clearances weiv *180 busbels. Brad
streets gave an increase in stocks of 420.000

Unscrupulous Efforts to De

A. C. H?nry's Position Ii One
of the Mysteries of the
Campaign.
Colonel John P. Irish and the Chris
tiaa Endeavorers Take
a Hand
Oakland (Jfftce San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, Feb. 24. f
A week ago politics in Oakland looked
very dull, and the future was very hungry
for those who n gard a municipal cam
paign in the same manner that a tramp
views a square meal. During the pa*t
twenty-four hours this has all changea,
and now the lines are drawn about equally
between party fealty, saloon closing and
anti-saloon closing.
Tue anonymous circular has made its
appearance, the secret story is being gen
eroubly passed around without an author,
;'ie forgotten transaction of years ago has
teen revived, political records long since
One of the Enigmas of Oakland's Municipal Campaign.
annihilated have been re-embodied, and '
all these things require affirmation and
' contradiction, and in consequence the
crowd of politicians for subsistence only
has found employment and the campaign
has assumed a businesslike air.
'In addition to this tbe saloon and anti
saloon element have both unsheathed
their swords and whetted t em, ana each
has declared that nothing will satisfy
them but the utter routof their opponents.
The chief interest centers in the struggle j
for Mayor, and none of tbe candidates i
know where they stand. Tho'e strong on I
one point are weak on another, and be- I
tween the many rocks it is impossible to
tell who will steer safely to victory. Judg
ing from party lines only the plum should
be carried off by Captain Thomas, who, in
addition to being the Republican candi
date, is a very popular O. A. R. man. But
although his chance is superior to any ac
this time everything is being done to un
dermine his political standing and draw
off his lowers, and in this direction
much unscrupulous work is being carried
' out
In this connection there appears one of
the mysteries of the present campaign. It
is the campaign of A. C. Henry. Mr.
Henry was once Mayor of Oakland and
has founded four of its present banks.
Being a rich man he certainly does not
want office for the salary, but he certainly
â¢ does want to be Mayor, and this want has
1 Miurred him on to make a vigorous effort.
lOn Ninth street a vacant store in the
I block owned by him has been lilted up for
\beadqn-.rters.
Mr. Henry's headquarters are a study,
' as much from their appearance as from
<he men who flit in and out. Over the
entrance la a large transparency almost
4 Mr enough to bold a meeting of Mr.
Henry's followers, and inside is a com
lortab'.e stove, around which two or three
men are sitting all day long and a good
. part of the night, a piano that has seen
better days, a little bunting, a few stools
from a neighboring furniture warehouse
and a pitcher of water.
'. In case any one might think th*y had
stumbled across a branch Salvation Army
barracks the transparency is boldly let
tered, "Headquart-rs of A. C. Henry."
His followers are making all kinds of
claims regarding bis strength, but to the
average observer it is very difficult to ste
on what their claims are ba-etl. Colonel
J. P. McElroy whispered this afternoon
that Mr. Henry has some Grand Army
. following, but Major Wood ward contradict
ed this and said that Henry'; strength in
that direction consists of Major McElroy,
.Marcus I>. Hyde and an unknown, ana
that the Army and Navy League U almost
a unit for Captain Thomas.
Altogether Mr. Henry's candidacy,
which is an independent one, is at this
time the enigma of the campaign.
Colonel John P. Irish has also taken a
hand in tbe campaign and to-nk'ht pub
lishes a statement in which he says some
pertinent things. He says: As usual
the municipal election is made to turn
.upon matters of less moment to the ex
clusion of what is greater. Las; month
I wo men of large property came here from
f -Montana to buy homes, settle their fam
/ilies and invest their means. They iv
, tended to stop in Oakland; they took a
look at it across the West Oakland flats,
]>assed tbe marsh bog and tbe swamp
e-ephant and the garbage crematory tbat
does not cremate, and then one made h:s
investment in Ban Jose and tbe other in
Xapa."
After referring to the necessity of intel
ligent improvement the colonel con
cludes: "Let us attend to tbe needs o!
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
this source whence cometh our strength,
rather than make a petty wrangle over
tbe issue of a man's rig "it to a citizen's
privi'ege being deniable because he is a
commuter and earns in San Francisco
what he spends in Oakland."
The president of ttie City Christian En
deavor Union issued to-night a letter in
which he uses some remarkably strong
language. If he speaks with authority,
the closing paragraph must have a marked
effect on the election, as tbe Endeavorers
certainly control about 1800 votes. It
reads: "We will never comprornis* with
the devil or i is imps. Any candidate who
is a liquor man or backed by liquor men
need not come around wooing for our suf
frage. We want the women and children
protected and fed. This is simp y a po
lici* regulation restricting the s.iie of m

liberty is at stake and every honest, clean
Christian and non-Christian man should
vote yes on the proposition."
The letter also corAuns a reference to
Councilman Manuel, -who voted against
Sunday closing after promising to give
the people a chance to vote upon it. It
says that although he trifd yesterday to
cali a special meeting of the council to re
consider the action of last Wedne:-day mat
he has made bis record, and a death-bed
repentance will not save his name nor his
followers from defeat.
This final hint is construed to mean
thattne Endeavorera will give their sup
port for Mayor to Rev. S. Goodenoiuh,
the Populist candidate, rather than to
Captain Thomas, the Repub ican nomi
nee. Just what argument can be made to
justify their position no one seems to
know, but that such is the case there i 3 no
doubt.
With all these irons in the fire there will
be plenty of campaigning lor the poli
ticians before Monday, March 8.

Her Short, Unhappy
Married Life.
Torn Photcgrapbs and Bible and
Many Letters Figure in
the Exhibits.
Ju ge Ogden Said the Prisoner Was
Worse Than a Highway
Robber.
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Br-advay, Feb. 24. )
Willis* B. Gay, self-confessed bigamist,
stood in the docK to-day while Judge
Ogden read him a scathing rebuke and
sentenced him to three years in San
Quentin, the limit the law allows for
bigamy,
In the court was Mrs. Gay No. 3 and
Mrs. Gay No. 4 The story to.d by the
third Mrs. Gay, who uses her previous
name of Mrs. Edeau, was the most re
markable ever told in an Alameda court.
In brief it was this : A few years ago Gay
married a young girl whose only name
known is that 01 Alice. After living with
her a few montus there was a desertion,
and Gay married Miss May Griner. This
lady was Mr-. Gay fora lew months, when
her house burned down, and she charged
Gay with knowing a good deal about it.
Another woman came on the scene and
Mrs. Gay I*o. 2 secured a divorce.
A lew month? laierGay met Mrs. Edeau,
a very worthy lady of Pueblo, Colo. Sue
was a prominent churcn member, an ar
dent temperance lecturer and very promi
nent in fraternal circles. Anticipating
the necessity for making a defense in case
Gay should attack her reputation, Mrs.
Edeau laid before the court the most
valuable set of testimonials and references
that any woman ever possessed. Ther
left no doubt whatever that she was all
that a good, pure woman should be.
Afier a few moothe of marri d lif >, dur
ine which Gay treated her cruelly and ac
knowledged in letters that his claim to for
tune was a myth, sue wai also deserted,
but not before Gay had proposed that she
insure her house and store ana hinted that
if it should burn down it would be a good
thing. Before leaving Guy also tore up all
the fami y portraits and destroyed all the
family records tn the family Bible, and
the fragments of tiiem were produced in
court to-day to support the position taken
by Mrs. Edeau. After deserting her Gay
came to Alameda, married a young girl
named Mary Gafford and was living with
her when caught by Mis Gay of Puebio.
His arrest followed, bÂ« pleaded guilty, and
to-day was sent to the penitentiary. Judge
Ogden remarking that his conduct was
more reprehensible than that of a highway
robber and that it was a pity the law did
not permit a longer sentence than three
years.
Mrs. Gay No. 3 has resumed her name of
Mrs. Edeau and will secure a divorce, and
t.re-ueus that when Gay's term is up thai
be will be taken back to Pueb.o to answer
a charge of irrand larceny for having sto
len and sold her lurniture without her
permission or knowledge while she was
sick ia a hospital.
A CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE
Ministers of Oakland Will Ap
point Fourteen Mer
chants.
They Will Take C arge of the Anti-
Saloon Fight at the
Election.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broauway, Feb. 24. )
An important meeting was held in the
uarlors of the First Presbyterian Church
this evening, wiiich marked the inaugura
tion of the anti-saloon party's vigorous
campaign.
Tnc Invitations to the meeting had been
sent out privately, and no public notice of
the gathering had bean given. Nearly all
the leading clergymen of the city were
present and a few laymen.
Rev. C. H. Hobart explained the object
of the meeting. He said it was to take
such stops as would insure two years of
decent government by the next adminis
tration. H* meant by this tnat they
wanted two years of a government that
would not be controlled by the saloons.
The city had been governed from back
rooms of saloons long enough, and it was
time that.ail this should cease.
AftT some further discussion Dr. Chap
roan made a motion that a committee
should be appointed to take charge of the.
campaign and that it should consist of
three members. Much debate followed,
and it was proposed that the three mem
bers should appoint fourteen, and that
the aptioiniees should act. This plan was
approved.
It wan finally dcci.led that the commit
tee of three shou d cons. at of Kov. C. H.
Hobart, H. R. Waters and K. S. Finch.
These three were commissioned to ap
point fourteen oihers, two from each of
the seven wards In the city. The politi
cal complexion of the lourieeu is to be as
nearly as possible distributed among old
parties. Under no consideration must
they appoint a pastor, but all must b*
merchants.
The duty of the fourteen is to arrange
for several mas--meeting3, to crocure a
permit from the Mayor to hoid meetings
on street-corners and to report in regard
to the propriety of indorsing a ticket
of men favorable to their cause.
The action of the ministers has added to
the political ferment, and the saloon men
are now considering the nature of the
campaign they should make.
A lamed v City Note*.
Those who expect to cast their ballot at the
coming municipal election, April 13, and who
are not registered, should bear in mind that
March 13 will be the last day for registration.

MOURNING A SON, HE DIED
Heart Disease Suddenly Carries

Dealers on the Pacific
Coast.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 24. )
J. C. Wilson, the weil-known coal mer
chant and yachtsman, died somewhat
suddenly this morning in San Francisco.
Although he has been sick for a few
weeks, his death was not expected, but he
was stricken with hears disease while at
the Lane Hospital, where he expired.
The deceased merchant was one of the
largest coal dealers on the Pacific Coast,
and has large business interests in San

ago, when he purchased a handsome home
on Hoburt street.
In 1875 he married Miss Agnes Cowan,
the daughter of a prominent citizen of
San Franc sco.
The tragic death of his son Hneb last
September accelerated J. C. Wilson's
death. It will be recalled that while
Hugh Wilson's yacht was at aucnor near
Antloch be went in swimming, was seized
with cramps and drowned. Tue fearful
news caused his father a severe shock
lrom which he never recovered.

ANOTHER TEAM
MAY GO EAST
Prospects That Berkeley
May Send Her Men as
Far as Chicago.
Some Very Premising Candi
dates on the List of Track
and Fie id Athletes.
A! L3D, th> Prof ss ona! Trainer, I,
Greatiy Phased With the
Prosp cts.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 24.â There is a
prospect oi Berkeley's sending another
track athletic team across the continent
this spring to compete on Eastern fields.
This is a dope which is being quietly cher
ished among leaders of athletics at the
university, and to which utterance has
been given only in the moat careful and
guarded manner.
Almost the whole scheme will be de
pendent upon the outcome of the intercol
legiate games in April. Bhoulc Stanford
be deleaied by a good majority the trip,
so say those who know, will be assured.
Just bow far they will go will depend
largely upon the ability oi the learn and
the finances. A dozen or more men will
probably be sent at least aa lar as Chicago
to compete in the Western intercollegiate
championship meet and with such co
leges and athletic clubs as are in the im
mediate Vicinity.
At no lime since the founding of the
university have such a large number oi
candi :ates for places on the team con
tinued through the season to come out
for daily practice, and the prospects indi
cate ti.a; several surprises nil! be sprang
in the coming games with tue Palo Alto
boys.
In the sprints Berkeley has Barnes,
Dickie, Drum and Brougbton, all of whom
have made as low time aa 10 4-5 sec
These lour men, aa well as Miller and
llerreshoff, will enter the 2:20. In the
4:40 there is Humphreys. In tho miU
and the balf-miia are Brown, Jackson and
Carroll, with half a dozen more entries
wtiuse ability is unknown.
In the mile walk there are Westerfeld,
Aiken, t-kaiie ana Gr.ilin. Bakewell and
Cheakhave thea-cemleucy in the hurdles.
Craits, Squires and Cusier are the bicy*
uhsts. Doz.er for the broad is out again
with Humphreys and i.heck. Edgren is
sull in the university and will compete in
the hammer throw. Lloyd, Edgren and
Cheek will put the shot, while Lloyd,
Cheek and Hoffman will try the vault.
TuÂ«se are the leading men who will en
ter the contests, with a score or more
others whose real ability has not yet been
tested. A tryout field day will be held in
about ten duys, when all those who do
not equal or exceed certain records will be
droi ped from the list.
Al Lean, the well-known professional
athlete, has begun regular work with the
men, preparing them for the games. He
says the prospects for a crack team are fa
vorable in the extreme.
One of the prime reasons that Berkeley
wishes to send a team to compete on
Eastern tracks is that this is EJgren's last
year with the university, and that Hum
phreys will probably not return in the
fall. These two men alone are believed to
dc able to take at least three first places
against any team in the country.
As for the money to tend a team East,
there is something like $1700 in the treas
ury o: the association at the present time,
and small amounts are being continually
added to it from time to time throutrb
concerts, benefits and individual coniribu
t ons. According to the conditions upon
which |1500 of the amount is held. Berke
ley must send a team East either this
year or next, or the money will revert to
other uses of the association than paying
the expenses of a transcontinental tour.
Water Rates Lowered.
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb 24.â Alongand
lively meeting or the Town Board was
held last evening at which the question of
water rate? occupied the greater part of
the session. A settlement was asked by
which meter rales are to be reduced about
35 per cent; street sprinkling rates,
'25 per cent, and the company is
allowed $1 50 tor small hydrants, which
have not been paid for at all during the
year. After a settlement was reached
several citizens and some of the Trustees
(ought for a still greater reduction, and
the discussion which followed may yet
result in the reconsideration of the entire
question.

icg election. The lady declared that she
was not an expert on politics and inquired
the reason for their visit.
One of the men, named Stockinger, re
marked that a woman who could* act a
Mrs. Prescott had done was certainly bet
ter able to give ail vice than any man that
he knew. A few months ago Stocktnger's
wi:e was living in a part of town where it
wa-< impossible for her to bring up her
chid with Uue regard to its welfare. She
had left her husband and taken the ch.ld
with her. T c case was reponed to Mrs.
Prescott, and one day rinding the chil I in
objectionaole company she at once took
charge of it and restored it to its father.
Nothing more was thought of v until
Stockinger app-ared at her office yester
day, asking for her preferences as regarded
political candidates.
"Thin experience is somewhat novel to
me," said Mrs. Prescott when asked si bout
the matter, "and I cannot help but feel
gratified. I am not in politics, but sev
eral people seem to think my advice worth
having. They invariably sympathize with
me that I am not able to vote myse.f, nnd
declare that they would be only too glad
to do as I wish."

BUTLER TO FIGHT
HIS EXTRADITION
He Has Cabled to a Bank
in Australia for
Funds.
One of the Papers Has Offered
Him $100 for a Brand
New Name.
If Commissioner Heacock Decides
Against H m He Will Appeal
to the Supreme Court.
From present indications it will be
months before murderer Butler takes his
departure for Australia to stand his trial
for the fiendish crimes charged against
him.
Butler is now determined to fieht his
extradition to the bitter end, and if Com
missioner Heacock decides against him
he will appeal to the United States Su
preme Courr.
"1 have to-day," said Butler yesterday,
"cabled to a bank in Sydney, through my
attorneys, where 1 have funds, for Â£100 to
pay my attorneys for carrying the ca9e to
the Supreme Couit, and I want ail the
money I can to help me in that direction.
I am writing a boole of my life, in ac
cordance with a contract with a publisher,
and I will get 40 per cent of the profits."
Butler also said he was going to get $100
from a newspaper for another name for
himself, a brand new, exclusive one, but
Butler has so often made statements and
then denied them that it really makes lit
tle difference what name he gives. He
admitted yesterday that he went by a
iar^e number of names, as he found it
convenient to do so for many reasons.
He also received a handsome sum from
tne phonograph men, so that all along he
has had an eye to business.
He acknowledged yesterday that the
story published exclusively in The Call
of his connection with tne Canadian
mounted police was correct.
He was in the Northwest in 1887 after
leaving the British marine service. He
was only there a short time, and must
have either bought his d.scharga or
deserted.
It is believed that Butler is a native of
Brommage, Staffordshire, England, where
be served as a constable for a short time
and taen enlisted in the Gordon High
landers. His subsequent career has since
his arrest on the Swanhiida, been almost
entirely published in The Call lrom time
to time.
"I am not fighting my extradition," he
said, "because lam afraid to go back to
Sydney to stand my trial, as I know they
can't prove anything against me. If I
bad committed the murders do you think
I would have lived openly in Sydney be
fore sailing on the Svranhildu? I have
made blunders, I confess, but that can't
De helped now. I am going to fight my
extradition to the bitter end, because I
enow I am innocent and don't want to be
dragged back to Austmlia as a murderer."
INSULTED WOMEN.
J. Cameron Smith Sent to the County
Jail for Six Months.
J. Cameron Smith, a man about 30 years
of ape, was sent to the County Jail for six
months by Judge Con Jan yesterday, a fact
which, will be pleasing news to many
lasiies in the City.
Smith has been arrested several time*
for insulting ladies. He was always care
ful that no one was around at me lime,
and so he escaped punishment through
lack of evidence.
About a year ago he was arrested, and
as he knew there was a strong case acairnt
h.m he jumped his bonds. Judge Conian
is-ued a bench warrant for his arrest, but
he succeeded in escaping the vigilnnge of
the police till Saturday last, wnen p )lice
man W. D. Scott recognized him and took
him to the Ci;y Prison.
Smith was at one time a clerk in a ship
ping office, and later a collector. He is of
medium height, reddish hair and mus
tache.
Fought the Conductor.
W. T. Bsgley, a young man living at 28 Eddy
street, had a fight^with the conductor of a
Union-streetcar near Polk street yesterday.
Bag.ey had the worst of the oncou i tcr, as the
conductor used his beilpuuch w.th trood effect.
Hag.ey went to the Receiving Hospital and
Dr. Uunnt'll dr.'ssed a wound on his left jaw
and another on his let hand.

MUCH BLUFFING,
BUT NO FIGHT
Attorneys Smith and Loud
erback Engage in a
Wordy War.
The Ex-Judge Accuses the Other
of Fixing a Member of
the Jury.
Acrid Recrimination Evcntualy Winds
Up ia Mutu;l Expressions of
Apo oÂ»y.
There was quit* a heated discussion yes
terday between Mr.jor Smith and ex-Judge
Londerback in Judge Joachimsen's court.
Attorney Smith 1? defending some 250
Chinese, arrested a week ago last Satur
day in dens about Cbinatown. Louder
â  back is the special counsel employed by
.Chief Crowley for the prosecution.
The trial of these cases has causrd both
Attorney Smith and Joseph Coffey, his
. associate, to be placed in contempt, with
a fine o\ $100 and imprisonme.it in the
County Jail to be held over their heads.
The habeas corpus writ sued out by them
resulted in their being remanded to jail,
but they have managed to hays execution
of judgment withheld while the cases of
their Chinese clients are before the court.
It was the trial of Wonp Lung, a visitor
to a gambling game, that came up yester
day. The evidence was the same a* given
in other cases of the kind, and was con
clusive enoueh for the jury to lind the
defendant gnilty*
Durine the argument made by the
prosecution Attorney Smith arose and de
clared that: "Judire Louderback is con
' Burning too much time. He is waging
words so as to prevent us getting in our
argument for the defense at this hearing."
Judge Louderback immediately fired
back the brand that created ail tne
trouble.
"You don't want an armament made,"
he said, "because you buve a juryman
lixeti."
Attorney Smith blanched. He squirmed
in his chair and started to stutter an an
swer. His first words were forcible
enough, b<u did not reacti the ear of the
court. Then, having given vent to his
pent-up passion, he addressed ex-Judge
L'juderback personally, pointing his
linper at the person addressed.
"You, i-ir, say that I have a juryman in
this box 'fixed.' You are not speaking
what is true, and it I had you outside of
â  this courtroom I wou.d brand its falsity
upon you in a manner entirely different."
'â¢Tut, tut, tut!" interposed Judge
Joachiinsen, "1 want Done of that talk in
this court."
"Mv honor is impugned," broke in At
torney Smith. "I never before have been
accused of â¢lixing 1 or tampering with a
jury, and I certainly have never been ac
cused of being 'fixed' while on the bench."
The intimation that ex-Judge Louder
back had lent a willing ear to defendants
while he presided over one of the Police
comts some years ago was not taken up.
Aiter Wong Lung had been convicted
l/ouderbuck and Smith met in the corri
dor outside the courtroom.
'"Major, let's call it off?" said LouJer
back in an inquiring way. 'I didn't mean
what 1 said."
"That's all right," answered Smith, ac
cepting iheglad hand, "neither did I."
, Wong Lung in the meantime comes op

MARY MOOTiLY IS ANGKY.
Complains of Excess ye 1 liargea Ajjnirn
I'^r ISrothcr'a Kstute.
Miss Mary Mootry showed great impa
tience white on the witness-stand in Judpe
Goffey's department of the Superior Court
yesterday. She accused Henry A. Crane,
executor of the will of Thomas Mootry,
deceased, and his attorney, M. Mullany, of
having prevented her from serving as
executrix of the estate of her brother, the
late Thomas Mootry, and complained that
Mr. Crane had been allowed $3000 and Mr.
Mullany $2000 out of her brother's estate
for their management of the estate's
affairs, when she thought it was worth no
such sum.
Attorney Deal, representing Miss Mootry,
introduced figures to show that the in
come of the estate had been $5134 and that
MoÂ«srs. Crane and Mullany had taken
$5000 of this sum.
"They wanted a great deal more," said
Judge Coffey. "Mr. Crane even Â»aid he
wouldn't do the work again for $5000. I
don't think be gave anything like a quar
ter of bis time to the affairs of thin ate.
I told him then as I tell him now that be
was not compelled to accept the office of
executor anymore than I am compelled
to accept this office where I get only $4000
a year for all my time. Yet he appraised
bis s rvices at that high figure."
Miss Mootry was much moved. She
testified that when she came here from
New York City afier her brother's death
she wanted to :ee the Judge of the court,
but Mr. Crane warned her that Judge Cof
fey was a very unapproachable man, and
consequently she was debarred trom her
rights as an executrix of her brother's es
; tate. She was given no information and
I wax not even told when the final account
was to be presented to the court, so that
she could be present and see where the
money was going. She said that Mr. Mul
lany had also attempted to keep her from
acting as executrix.
Judge Coffey said it was apparent that
Mr. Crane's acts had kept Miss Mootry
from the enjoyment of her rights in the
premises, and he thought she was entitled
to her position as executrix to associate
with Executor Crane in the management
of the estate. The court intimated that
the compensation to the executor and his
attorney bad been excessive.
Further testimony will be heard next |
Tuesday at 2 p. m.
Swindled a Dentist.
G. W. Crane had a charge of obtaining money
by false pretenses booked apalust him at the
City I'r.son last night. He went to Dr.
Shepard's office Monday and ordered a set of
leeth. He returned yesterday, and after tell
ing the doctor he had $100 in bank he bor
rowed 50 cents. The doctor ascertained he
had no money in bank, and when he called
last evening and asked for 25 cents more tbe
doctor arrested him and handed him over to
Policeman T. C. Murphy.
Charged With Uurglary.
Charles \V. Nelson broke into the stables at
219 Seventh street Monday and stole two
bridlei. They wera recovered by Detectives
Dillon and CrockeU and Nelson was arrested

PREPARING FOR
THE FINAL BATTLE
How the Fair People
Hoped to Get a Show
of Hands.
The Pencil De ds Fight Will
Swallow Up the Case of
the Notary.
All Issues in the Famous Litigation
Now Pending on the Struggle
to Begin Monday.
. Both sides in the fight between (Mrs.
Craven and (be representatives of the Fair
estate are busy sharpening their spears in
anticipation of the struggle which will
begin Monday morning before Judge
Siack.
Attorney W. M. Pierson, whose illness
was the cause of the postponement, is
convalescent again. As the attorneys who
will lead the onslaught against the pencil
deeds, he and his- partner, K. B. Mitchell,
yesterday liled a formal amended com
plaint in the big case. The documents set
lorth that the trust will lias already bee-n
admitted to probate, and in accordance
with an order of court W. K. Goodfellow,
James S. Angus and Thomas R. Crothers
are now executois under that will, instead
of special administrators.
Copies of this complaint, were served on
Mrs. Craven's attorneys yesterday. To
day they will join issue, as lawyers say,
and thus the last technicality in the way
of the big lawsuit has been removed.
The beginning of the civil case will be
the means of transferring interest from i
the Cooney affair to the fight over the
pencil deeds. Every issue in the compli
cated litigation is after all involved in the
cnee at issue before Judge Slacic. The part
Cooney played in the drama was after all
a small one, but he afforded a mark for
the Fair children to strike at in prefer
ence to an attack on their chief opponent.
It was an idea, bo it is said, of putting
obstacles in the way of the trial of the
pencil deeds that led youug Fair and
Captain Lees to charge the young notary
with perjury. They anticipated on a pre
liminary examination to introduce enough
evidence to have Cooney held for trial,
and then with a criminal action pending
they were confident Mrs. Craven would be
deterred from prosecutine her claims in
the civil courts.
The determination of the executors of
the estate to proceed in this case instead
of urging the trial of Cooney has not met
with the approbation of the attorneys
representing Mrs. Herman Oelrichs, Miss
Virginia I 1 air and their brother. Instead
it is now a bone of considerable conten
tion. The heirs ana their lawyers were
for using the criminal lever first and mak
ing an attempt at washing out the foreery
charge? in a haphazard manner before a
jury. From the beginning of the case
against Cooney it is known that the exe
cutors strongly disapproved of this flank
way of attacking Mr?. Craven. They
were for making the light in the civ:l
courts, an*i had convinced the lawyers for
Mrs. Oelrichs and Miss Fair of thef utility
of this couree. Young Fair, however, was
anxious to get betore the kaleidoscope,
and he proceeded at once to charge Cooney
with pper j ury, asserting that the certifi
cates upon which he made his acknowl
edgment of tlje pencil deeds were of &
form not printed until January, 1896, two
years after the death of me bonanza king.
Fair's attorneys at the time intimated
that more arrests would follow, but they
finally decided to rest their fortunes lor
the time being on Cooney's prosecution.
In addition to putting an obstacle in the
way of the civil trial the Fair attorneys
also hoped, it is said, to comtel Mrs.
Craven to show her hand, so to speak, in
Cooney's dofense. They expected t. at
Delmas and Shortridge and the other at
torneys for the pencil deeds wonld intro
duce evidence to clear Cooney of the
charge, and thus make public their plan
of campaign. The ruse failed,, as the
notary's attorneys preferred to allow him
to he held for trial, holding their ammu
nition in reserve for the big fight in the
civil courts.
Events thus far show that the Fair peo
ple have only succeeded fn their plans to
a 'partial dejiiee. They have succeeded
in having Cooney held lor trial in accord
ance with an order to that effect made
yesterday by Judge Cook, but they are aa
much in the tiarfc as ever in hauling out
the coveted chestnuts from the hearth*
Ftnne of the pencil deeds.
The Grand Jury has been asked by Judge
.Cook to consider the testimony presented
aga nst the notary, but as ail this lineu
must of necessity be washed out in the
â¢civil case, it is not probable that that body
will lake any action until trie result of
tne action before Judge Slack is decided.

Cuticura Brings Speedy Relief,

I was a sufferer for eight years from that
most distressing of all diseases, Eczema, but
can now say truthfully that I am entirely
cured. I tried some of the best physicians
io the country, but they did me little good.
The palms of. my hands were covered, and
would become inflamed; little white blisters
at first would appear, then they would peel
â¢ off, leaving a red, smooth surface which would
â¢burn like fire and itch ; well, there is no name
for. it. On the inside of the upper part of
both uiviiiubs. great red blotches, not unlike
hives, would appear, and as soon a3 I became
â warm, the burning and itching would begin.
Night after night I would lie awake all night
ana scratch and almost go wild. I beard of
Cuticura remedies, got a box of Cuticcra
" (ointment), a bottle of Cdticira Resolvent
(blood purifier), and gave them a thorough
trial, and after a few applications I noticed
the redness and inflammation disappear ; be-
fore /had used one box there wa* not a Â»ign of

CLEVER NEWSPAPER ART WORK
Chronicle's Exhibition for Charity of
I', eat l'en Drawing* for Big Journal*.
Aunioueand interesting exhibition of
the original drawings for the illustrations
of the greatest newspapers of the country
was opened yesterday in the rooms of the
Partiuglon School of Illustration at 424
Pine street. The collection, numbering
over 800 pieces and covering walls and
numerous screens, represents the best
work of the best-known newspaper artists
of the aay.
All manner of things and scenes and
persons are included in the display of
skillful drawings contributed by the
Rocky Mountain News, the St. L mis Re
public, the Detroit Evening News, the
Chicago Times-Herald, thp Atlanta Con
stitution, the Chicago News, the Chi
cago Herald, the Philadelphia Pub
lic Ledger, the New York Morn
ing World, the New York Sunday
World, the New York Press, the New
York Adverti er, the Cincinnati Enquirer,
the Chica.o Inter Ocean, the Chicago

Washington Post, the Denver Republican,
the Chicago Tribune, the New York
Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the
Washington Evening Star, the Baltimore
American, the Salt Lake Tribune, the San
Francisco Chronicle and work of the San
Francisco Stetch Club.
The whole exhibit is most entertaining
ami instructive, the more so, perhaps,
because newspaper illustrations and the
names of newspaper artists are widely
known.
Charity is to profit from the nominal
admission price charged ana from the
sale of the pictures, all of which, collected
by the San "Francisco Chronicle from the
cleverest journalistic artists in the United
States, will be sold in aid of a worthy
cause.
The exhibition will continue to-day,
Friday and Saturday during forenoons,
afternoons and evenings.
A great many persons attended the
exhibition last night and fair sales were
made. Music was a feature of the even
ing; it will enlighten the remaining even

NO RELIEF TOR INDIA.
The Local Charitable Movement Had
to Be Abandoned Yesterday.
To the great mortification of the local
Indian famine relief committee the move
ment to send ships laden with grain from
the United States to Calcutta has had to
be abandoned.
Yesterday the whole thing fell through,
so to speak, and the promises made will
not be fuililied. The reason was summed
up in two words, "no money."
With free ships! free grain and pros
pective free transportation, the relief !
scheme had to be abandoned because it j
would cost too much money to bring the j
grain from the Western States to this i
port. The cost of collecting the food j
would have amounted to a very large sum, j
and this the committee was unable to col- '
lect because of the demands upon the
generous of this City on behalf of the un- j
employed now here assembled.
Wherever the committee went for money
it found that the people were more in
clined to look after those on the Pacific
Coast Wi.o are in need of assistance than
those of other rich countries who are un
fortunate. However. Treasurer Lilien
thal will send the $800 already collected
to the relief committee in London.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Suits lor divorce have b^en Hied as follows:
Otto Gross against Clara Gross, for cruelty;
Catherine Scott against Chester Scott, for
cruelly; Abbte Gregory against William M.
Gregory, ior cruelty ; Bertha H. Jordan against
Kmest B. Jordan, for cruelty.
Damages to a Kentnd Schooner.
J. J. Raver. as assignee of J. K. Kane, has
sued Henry A. Hebard in the Justices' Court
to recover on account of damages to the
schooner Alta, which was rented by Uebard,
the sum of $299 99.
A CHAMPION OF OLD IRELAND.
Rev. Jamps McFadden, commonly known as "the Patriot driest of Gweedore,"
will lecture on "Ireland and Her Wrongs" at Metropolitan Temple on the evening
of Marcti 10.
Peculiar interest attaches to the lecture on account of the personality of Father
McFadden. He acquired considerable notoriety in Ireland on account of his
manliness and fearlessness in defense of nis people against landlords and misgov
eniment. In 1888 he was imprisoned for six months in Londonderry jail under
Mr. Ual four's "forever and forever" coercion act, and again in 1889 for three
months.
At his arrest on leaving his church on Sunday, February 3, 1888, in presence of
the congregation, the people became so excited that the District Inspector of
Police, who had charge of the warrant of arrest, lost his life. The reign of
terror that followed in Gweedore after the catastrophe is said to nave baffled
description.
An nrmy of occupation was drafted into Gweedore by the Irish executive at
Dublin Castle and the peasants were harried by every manner of persecution, mid
night raids, etc. A police constable was appointed to give "passes" to wÂ« lt tiie
public roaiis; arrests were numerous, and gunboats searched the caves along the
shorea with electric lights. Derry jail was crowded with Gweedore peasants, while
it also retained within its stone walls and iron rails their much-revered parish
priest. Prosecutions and trials, changing of venues, packing of juries and all the
aggravations of the evil of Castle rule in Ireland followed. "Delenda est Gwee
dore" became the motto of the Government, and the priest of Gweedore and his
people were transferred to Maryborough, in Queens County, to insure the end.
Discredit and defeat, however, followed in due time, and the peasants are now
at home in poverty-stricken Gweedore and Father McFadden is pursuing a mission
of charity in San Francisco.
His Jot has fallen on evil days. Times are hard, depression general. This has
told on the father's mission. It. is thought that Irishmen in San Francisco, as
well as the citizens generally, will give this hero of the Irish priesthood a warm
reception in Metropolitan Temple on March 10, and by i heir aplendid rally save
the good priest's mission to the City from almost total failure.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1897.
WILL SPREAD THE
LIGHT OF ASIA
Rev. D. Dharmapala Is
Here From Calcutta,
India.
Will Deliver Lectures on The
osophy, Philosophy and
Religion.
Us s Scholarly English and Accepts
No Money in His Life's
Work.
A du*ky Buddhist priest from Calcutta
India, attired in the picturesque yellow
I silken toga peculiar to his high religious
office, arrived here yesterday, and will re
main live weeks, delivering philosophical
discourses at the different churches, and
telling sometoing of the teachings of the
ancient religion which, partly through his
j efforts, is now being restored to India
after long oblivion.
His name is H. Dharmapala, and he
was official representative of the Bud
dhists to the world's parliament of reli-
I gions in Chicago during the fair.
Of high culture and intellectual bearing,
he is a man who at once impresses his
I hearers with a feeling that with many
such men in India there would be littie
need for missionaries. He uses English
! with the ease and skill of one accustomed
! to end educated in the language from
I childhood, and yet he is a foreigner who
speaks other languages as well.
He baa come here primarily upon the
invitation of Golden Gale Branch Xhe
osophical Society.
And respecting the India relief meas
ures, he has a plan to suggest. Let those
> here a-nd in London who are raising iunus
! to send on corn telegraph at once to South
| crn India, where corn in plenty is stored,
| asking that it be immediately shipped lo
tiie northern districts, the English ana
American contributors guaranteeing to
reimburse the granaries. By the tedious
means of transportation across the seas,
thousands will have died before relief
arrives.
The following Sunday evening lectures
will be given by Key. Mr. Dnarmapala in
Native Sons' buiiding for the Golden
Gale Branch Theosophical Society:
February '28â "Buddhism and Christianity."
March 7â '-Brahmans and Buddhistic Tran-
I scendenial Science."
March 14â "Religions of India."
March 21 â "What Is Theosophy ?"
March 'J.Hâ "Future oi Christianity in Asia."
He spoke last nitrht before the Golden
i Gate Branch in Native Sons' building
; upon tbeosophy.
Aside ironi these occasions he is open to
all engagements to speak at other times
on Sundays and on weekdays.
"I should like," be said, "to give my
! message through various Christian
I churches in tbis City, in Oakland and in
i Aiameda, but I shall lecture on whatever
'â  subject is preferable to my audience.
"From here I shall go to Boston. I
â  shall lecture there at Harvard University
J and in Maine, and also at Baltimore.
"In Aupust I shall pass through bere
on my way to China.
"Next year I purpose to explore Thibet,
' a land .-acred to Tbeosophists. It is, you
j know, the only country where missiona
ries have not oeneiratea. I wish very
much to go to see the country and to bring
back a true account of that country of
mystery, from which all explorers have
been turned back after going just so far.
It is believed to be the home, the school,
of occult pbiiosophy. In its capital of
I Lhassa there is a great temple, in which
Friends: It was in October, 1893, that I had the pleasure of becoming ac
quainted with your people. The first cordiality 6hown to me in my travels â the
affectionate hospitality I received wherever I went â inspired me to love your peo
ple, and I promised my friends to revisit America, the land of noble freedom, the
refuge of the persecuted from intolerance and religious b'gotry.
Since I left the shores of the golden Pacific 1 have been a messenger of peace
and brotherhood to the nations inhabiting Japan, China, Slam, Burmali, Thibet,
Ceylon and India. Indiaâ the cradle land of religions, the birthplace of Buddhism,
the holy land of the Buddhists, well-nigh forgotten for seven centuries by the fol
lowers of the Lord of Compassion â was the scene of my labors during the lan
two years for the rescuing of the great shrine at Buddha Gaya. A powerful Brah
manical priesthood and a despotic political bureaucracy were the machines set in
motion against the efforts I was making to revive the hopelessly forgotten teach
ings of Buddha. India, once the land of the Buddha, now not one of her children
knows the history of her past greatness. There is now not one Buddhist in all
India. Seven centuries ago the persecuting and iconoclastic sword of the Moham
medans destroyed three religions from their native soils â Christianity from Pales
tine, Zoroaatrianism, the religion of the Parsees, from Persia, a.nd Buddhism from
India.
Convinced of the great truth that righteousness ultimately triumphs I worked
on for the consummation of the object which was to all my friends and co
religionists a chimera.
The spiritual battle that was begun on the birthday anniversary of Buddha,
the full moon day of May. 1894, against priestly Brahmanical selfishness ended in
the occupation of this holy spot on the very day two years later when for tiie first
time the anniversary of the birthday of the Great Teacher was being celebrated
after seven hundred years in the metropolis of British India, Calcutta, by the
native Hindoo?, who participated in the rejoicings in the hope that Buddhism, the
religion of compassion, will again have a place in India.
Your glorious poet-philosopher, Emerson, said, "America, thy name is oppor
tunity," and to America is given the opportunity to save India from the clutches
of priestly selfishness and political despotism. The teeming millions are treated
like dumb beasts, native industries are being killed by importation of cheap and
worthless goods, people groaning under heavy taxation, laborers compelled to
work for starving wages, grain that used to be stored up in the ancient days under
native kings in anticipation of lamines exported to the last seed, the revenue of
the lands wasted in carrying out useless military expeditions in the foolish fear
of the phantom created by the Russophobe politician, so that the Russian bear
may be frightened. The peace that the people of India enjoy under
British administation is that of the child that is tortured to death by
the cruel father, who insists on the child by threats to hold his tongue
and not speak a word and not cry! Thousands oi deaths occur every year
by the depredations of tigers and yet not one is allowed to keep firearms in
his house. The British politician has killed the individuality of the people like
the Pharoabs of Egypt. A great people, who have given world-saviors like
Buddha and Sankara Charya, law-givers like Manu, poets like Kalidasa, Kings
like Asoka, whose rock cut edicts, alter 2000 years, are being discovered and deci
phered in all parts of India, are now being ill-treated by the most glorious and
heroic of all nations. The British sing daily, "Britons shall never be slaves,"
but they take a glory in enslaving races and destroying the independence which
they would like to enjoy. The Buddhist tings of old praised not conquest by
sword, but they praised conquest by knowledge in spreading the gospel of peace
in unknown lands, as recorded in the A-oka edicts.
The best people on earth, to you I bring the lamentations of the peopie of
India, who are dying by thousands from want of food caused by a catastrophe
the greatest the world's history has seen, which is expected to last till next June.
British administration is alone responsible for this terrible calamity. Like the
sleeping virgins they slept and the bridegroom came, but they were too late.
Ayain I say with Emerson "America, tby name is opportunity." Mother India
wants your help.
7000 monks congregate three times a day ]
and chant sacred song? and invoke bless- j
inps on all the world, '.bet there be peace
and love among all peoples and all races
and nations.' It must be an impressive
scene.
"I came to Chicago by way of England
last September, but I was there three
years ago at the Congress of Religions.
Since 1 left here three years ago I have
traveled about 6o,ooo miles through many
countries.
"Since 1886, when I renounced my home j
in Ceylon to devote my life to work for |
humanity, I have been traveling from
place to place. For five years I was en
gaged in educational work in Ceylon.
"My work in India now is to revive j
Buddhism, the ancient religion of the
country. Only recently we have not back,
after rive years' struggle, the Maba-bodi j
Temple, about 200 miles ironi Calcutta, i
For 700 years the Brahmans held posses- I
sion oi It. It was restored afier a big and j
sensational lawsuit in Calcutta, which '
cost the alleged owner $50,000 to defend I
his claim and attempt to prove that it was
a Hindoo ten*,le. Its possession has
brought fame to its alleced proprietor, (or
all the tourists that visited it also called j
upon him. Possession is only partly re- I
stored, but in that temple now controlled
by the Government th* budduists have
one sacred foothold in India.
"Suiuangala, the high priest of Bud- ;
dbism, who resides in Ceylon, is one of th*Â»
cleverest Oriental scholars now livinc. !
He is an honorary member of the Royal j
Asiatic Society, which implies the very j
highest scholastic honor. He is also j
president of tne Maha-BodQi Society.
"India, the land of the noble ones,
twenty-five centuries ago was in the
zenith of her intellectual glory. It was a
period of struggle, the Brahmanical hier- |
arcny maintaining principles of ritualism '
and upholding purity of birth as
the absolute qualification for gaining de
liverance; wandering ascetics subscribing
to do promulgated system of religion;
sectarian teachers advocating their own
beliefs, each teaching that his doctrine is
the best and that all the rest are false. At
such a time, in the midst of search and
strife after religious growth, the 'Lion of
the Sakya Race,' the supremely enlight
ened, all-perfect Buddna appeared on the
scene.
"Buddha's doctrine is an ethical code
and a transcendental psychology.
"What did he teach? After centuries of
oblivion European Orientalists hare given
out the doctrines of the great teacher;
they hÂ»Â»ve made the declaration that his
code ol morality is perfect.
"His chief tenets are these:
Oneâ That the existence of suffering Is a
truth; that this suffering exists in manifold
ways; thai birth, decay, dissolution of the
physical body, painful separation and painful
association ali brine sorrow.
Twoâ That this suffering is due to the un
quenched, unsatisfied, selfish desires, the
longing to exist in the enjoyment of sensual
pleasure, the longing for a continuity of per
sonal existence in the bliss ul regions, the
pe>simistic longing for self-annihilation.
This is called the truth of the cause of suffer
ing.
Threeâ Emancipation from sorrow, the eter
nal, unconditioned, absolute peace, the end of
suffermp aud sorrow. This is called the truths
of cessation ot suffering.
Fourâ The: noble way, the eightfold path;
(a) right conception of the law of cause and
effect; (b) right thought; (c) right speech;
(6) ngnt notion; (c) right living; (f) rieht
endeavor; (g) righi utseipline of mind. This
is the i!Oole eightfold path, the middle way,
which Buiiiliia discovered, avoiding the ex
trvmeso! physical asceticism and ot sensual
luxurious livingâ both unworthy for gaining
the high ideal.

MRS. STANFORD
GOES EAST
It Is Given Out That She
Will Sell Her Wash
ington Property.
The Rare Pictures, Curios and
Bric-a-Brac to Be Brought
to This City.
Will Witness the Inauguration of
McKinley â Her Private Secretary
and Henry Lathrop Go Along.
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford ieft last evening
for Washington, D. C, where she will re
main several weeks. She was accom
panied by Henry Lathrop, Mrs. Bothnei,
her secretary, and maid and butler.
The lady and suite went in the private
car Stanford, in which she and the Sena
tor used to travel for so many years, in
going to New York, Washington and
other places. It is a favorite car with
her, and it is said that she would not
think of traveling in any other, so much
is she attached to it, because of the pleas
ant memories surrounding it.
Mrs. Stanford had made several prepar
ations to co previously, and each time the
car was victualed and otherwise stocked,
but little matters of business intervened
and caused a postponement. She will
now co straight through to Washington,
and will arrive in time for the exercises in
connection with the inaugural of Presi
dent McKinley. Probably none will be
more â¢welcome at the White House than
the philanthropic lady of California.
The great object, however, of Mrs. Stan
ford in going East at this time, as given
out, is to sell the great mansion in Wash
ington. Mrs. Stanford has been closing
out different properties lately. She has
turned over the California-street residence
to be used as an art gallery and place for
popular lectures in connection with the
university. It is in this, so it is stated, that
she will concentrate her treasures.
The curio?, brick-a-brac,paintings and rare
things from at home and abroad, now in
the Washington mansion, are to be put in
the big house on the hill for the univer
sity. Eventually the works of art and
curios in the Mcnlo mansion will go there
also, but that will probably be a long time
in the future.
But meantime the Washington property,
aside from that to be moved here it is un
derstood, will be sold.
Mrs. Stanford is disposing of a great
deal of her property now besides the Cali
tornia-street property which is to be used
for an art gallery and place for lectures
after her lifetime, and which was deeded
by her to the. university recently. She is
advertising the sale oi her extensive Sands
in Teham3, San Liuis Obispo, Contra
Costa and Santa Clara counties. The lady
wants to rid herself of the responsibility
of holding all these properties. The great
Gridley, Palo Alto and the other ranches
Kiven oricinally by Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford to the Stanford University were worth
$.0,000,000. T.'ese bequests of Mrs. Stan
ford are additional.
Mrs. Stanford left- last nieht at 5:30
o'clock.
The Labor 3laÂ«i- Meeting
The California Liibor Convention will hold
a mass-meeting this evening in Metropolitan
Temple for the purpose of reviewing the action
oi the State Legislature with reference to the
labor bills indorsed by the convention. The
committee of arrangements of the latter body
met last evening, and reports were made that
all the necessary talent and music had been
obtained. It was suggested thnt the matter of
the impending strike of printers in the State
Printing Office be one of the subjects for dis
cussion, but it was decided to not meddle with
the matter until more definite information be
obtained.
