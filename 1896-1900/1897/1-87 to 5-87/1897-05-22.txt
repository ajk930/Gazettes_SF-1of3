IN SYMPATHY
WITH CUBAN
INSURGENTS
But President McKinley Will
Not Be Forced to Act
Prematurely.
INTENDS TO AWAIT CALHOUN'S
REPORT.
Already the Commissioner Has Secured
Ample Proof That Ruiz Was Mur
dered in Jail â Friends Ready to
Aid Starving Americans.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.â What
action will be taken by the House con
cerning the Senate resolution recognizing j
the belligerency of the Cubans is some
thing nobody can tell at the present time.
The President, while in hearty sympathy
â¢ with the cause of the insurgents, and
ready to extend them the moral assistance |
of the United States at the earliest mo
ment he beiieves it practicable, would
like the House to hold the measure in
abeyance until the executive end of the
tvernment can see its way clear to act.
He indicated this pretty emphatically at
to-day's meeting of the Cabinet during
the general discussion of the Cuban situa
tion. Tue passage of the Morgan resolu
tion formed an initiatory subject, and led
to the consideration of the struggle in the
island, with especial reference to the in
terest of this coantry in bringing it to
an end.
President McKinley gave earnest ex
pression to his views on what he believed
to b*> an attempt of Senators to force his
ftandi What he said" showed very clearly
that he does not in .end to be swerved
fr< m his purpose to postpone action until
Calnoun, the special Commissioner, makes
a report. It is generally understood the
Fresiaent will do all he can to bring about
Cuban independence, but he believes the
executive, and not Congress, should take
the initiative. The President and his
advisers believe the most critical feature
of the situation is the altitude of the
Liberal party in the Cor toward the
war. Action in Madrid is more likely to
precipitate a crisis than action by the
Congress of the United States, and the
suggestion that Spain may make a final
move toward the freedom of Cuba is saia
to have some supporters among members
of the administration. Minister Taylor
in Madrid is keeping the State Depart
ment informed of the political situation
there, and news of the speedy fall of the
Canovas Ministry would not surprise this
Government.
MeanwDile Consul-General Lee is de
voting himself to the reiief of the dis
tressed Americans in Cuba. He is not
sending any interesting dispatches to the
State Department and is seeminely
awaiting the end witu the complacency
. born of the knowledge that he has not
been deceived at anytime by tha claims
of the Spaniards that thay would ulti
mately conquer the insurgents.
Part of the relief fund carried by the
joint resolution which pass-ed the House
yesterday was placed at his disposal on
the suggestion of Consul Brice, who tele
graphed from Matanzas that American
citizens there needed immediate relief. A
disratch was accordingly sent Lee direct

sire to return to the United States.
Lee was also instructed to furnish Con
suls at discretion sums for this purpose.
These directions were sent with the un
derstanding that the relief resolution
would be signed by the President to-day,
but a hitch occurred which prevents the
money from becoming available until
Monday. Hobart failed to si^n the reso
lution when it passed the Senate, and as
he is required to announce his certifica-
tion in open session the measure cannot
be sent to the President until lha Senate
meets again on Monday. This has not
caused any embarrassment, however, as
any money drawn by Lee prior to thai
time will be charged against the emer
gency fund until the resolution is form
all? approved. Tne $10,000 placed at the
disposal of Lee is merely for emergency
cases, and the remaining 540,000 will be
distributed in a manner not jet de
cided on.
Among the President's callers to-day
waj Representative Mills of Chicago. He
told McKinley the feeling in the West
was unanimously in favor of the recogni
tion of the Cubans. The President, he
said, replied that the West was no greater
friend of Cuba than ha was.
"The President knew wtat hewasdoing
when he commissioned Caihoun to in
vestigate the Ruiz murder," said Repre
sentative Warner of Illinois to-night.
"Caihoun is in sympathy with the
Cubans. I know this, for I have had it
from his own lips, and if there is the least
shadow of an excuse for making it favor
able to the insurgents I believe he will
do so. I don't think I am going too far
when I say the President knew Calhoun's
sentiments on the Cuban question when
he appointed him."
RUIZ WAS MURDERED.
CommlsÃloner Caihoun Has Dis-
covered Evidence to That Ef-
feet and Will So Report.
HAVANA, Ct-ba, May 2LâCommis
sioner Calhoun has arrived at a moral cer
tainty that Ruiz was assassinated by the
Spaniards in the jail of Guanabacoa, but
the case will never be proved :o t: c satis
faction of the Spanish Government. Much
private testimony has been given Calhoun
of the murJer, but in no case wa3 the in
formant willing that his name be made
public because of the fear of persecution
by Fondesviella and the Spanish authori
ties. Calhoun has the report of the au
'opsy on the body of Ruiz made by an
American surgeon, Dr. Burgess. Burgess
says the wounds in the head and forearm
which the body presented could not have

been inflicted on himself by Ruiz, because
of their position. Ruiz' head was evi
dently struck by another person with
some hard instrument, probably ol iron,
which fractured the skull and caused a
hemorrhage of the brain. . The wound in
the forearm and m&rks in the hand, Dr.
Burgess thinks, indicate that the mur
dered man tried with his hands to protect
his h> ad against an assault of somebody
armed with a heavy club or piece of iron.
The declarations of the oiiicials of the
jail of Guanabacoa are considered worth
less by the American Consulate. Counsel
for the Spaniarda. Senor Enrique Roig,
says the message of Ruiz to his widow and
children written on a chair in the prison
appears to be a fake. Roig is a youne
man, under 25, who is doing all in his
power to thwart the investigation. A
well-informed person told The Call cor
respondent to-day the end of it all will be
that the parties will never come to a con
clusion satisfactory to both, for which
reason Caihoun wiil bs obliged to give up
the investigation and report to his Gov
ernment.
About the general situation in the isl
and McKinley's commissioner has re
ceived much evidence the war will be end
less unless the United States interferes,
and such interference is the solution de
sired by all business men in the island.
Consul-General Lee's report about the
distress in Cuba has been confirmed fully
by Caihoun, as well as the impossibility of
Spain's quelling the revolution by force of
arms. Caihoun will send a long letter to
McKinley to-morrow embodying all he
knows about the situation. An official re
port in extenso will be made later.
It is said here that Weyler will leave the
island as soon as ho considers the provinces
of Pinar Â«'el Rio, Havana, Matanzus and
Santa Clara iv good condition for tho es
tablishment of reforms which will begin
in July. Another general of a more lib
eral policy than he will be appointed to
carry out the reforms. The Spanish Gov
ernment understands that Weyler's un
popularity is too great to enable him to be
successful.
A. Duboachett, an American citizen,
has presented a claim to the United States
Government, through the American Con
sulate here, against Spain. The Spanish
commander of the Battalion Infante ha.s
notified VVeyler that he found a great
quantity of dynamite bomDs hidden in
the hills around Asiento Viejo, Taburete,
Canada and El Ineles, in Pinar del Rio.
Some of the bomb 3 exploded, killing
many Spanish soldiers of the infante and
Aragon battalions. This report has been
suppressed by the censor. Captain Juan
Urguia, leader of the Spanish euerrillas
and noted for his cruelty, has be mi as
sasainateJ at Bermeja by several Chinese
merchants of whom he demanded money.
There aio now 16,000 Spanish soldiers in
ihe hospitals of the city and province of
Havana. An epidemic of dysetrery is
making ravages among the troops.
SPANIARDS ARE ANGRY.
During an Altercation the Duke of
Tetuan Boxas a Senator's
Ears.
MADRID, SrAiN, May 21.â An alterca
tion occurred to-day in the lobby of the
Cortes between the Duke of Tetuan, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, and a Liberal
Senator in reference to the statement of
the Foreign Minister just made in the
Senate regarding tlie resolution adopted
yesterday ty the American Senate, recog
nizing the Cuban insurgents as belliger
ents. The two statesmen used very strong
language, and finally the DuJte of Tetuan
boxed his adversary'B ears.
Tin.; caused great commotion in the
lobby, and the fact becoming known in
the Senate caused great excitement, dur
ing which the sitting was suspended.
The Liberals immediately assembled to
consider the situation and a summons
was sent to Senor Sagas ta. The Ministeri
alists also met and sent an urgent sum
mons to the Prime Minister. Both were
absent. After a conference with his col
leagues, the Duke of Tetaan resigned his
officr. which wiJi hfa.^ 'ed ad inte'im by
the Premier.
The Senator whose ears were boxed was
Senor Comas, who had raised the question
of the action of the American Senate.
Tne eicitinj: incident which culminated
in the Senate light was provoked by the
statement of the Duke of Tetuan that Sa
pasta's speech the other day to the Lib
erals had contributed to bring about the
vote in the American Senate.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Tcbkey, May 21.â
Representatives of the powers here sent
identical telegrams to their respective
Governments yesterday asking instruc
tions on their procedure in the negotia
tions for peace between Greece and Turkey.
In response the Embassadors this after
noon received telegraphic instructions
that the abolition of capitulations affect
ing Greek subjects in Turkey, as de
manded by the Porte, would not be al
lowed, nor would annexation to Turkey
be permitted. The only concessions to
which the powers wiil assent, the diplo
mats are informed, are the strategic recti
fication of the Turkish frontier and the
payment by Greece of an indemnity not
to exceed 115,000,000 francs. The Porte
will be notified formally to this effect to
morrow.
ATHENS, Greece, May 21.â Crown
Prince Constamine has telegraphed his
Government that sections of the Turkish
army have advanced 800 meters beyond
the positions occupied at the conclusion
of the armistice. Their movements have
been toward the villages of Daitsa and
Tsopanatis on the left and lMvri and
Kophalovritski on the right. The Gov
ernment has protested to the powers
against this flagrant breach of the armis
tice. The Turks have also piliaged a pri
vate estate near Sofalis, seizing the furni
ture and burning dwellings. A number of
women were assaulted.
LONDON, Eng., May 21.â Not even yet,
apparently, has the mil measure of the
last Gteek disaster at Dbomcko been
cnade known at Athens. Various ac
counts received here agree in declaring

the battle the most sanguinary of the
whole campaign. The first estimate
cabled to the Sun and Call that 2000
Ureeks were killed was probably not ex
aggerated. Fully 1000 Turks were also
killed.
Reasons for the facts being concealed by
the Greek Government have already been
indicated. It is hoped in Athens that tha
revolutionary spirit will now be kept
down, but the danger will not be.over for
some days yet. It is not expected that
anything definite regarding the terms of
peace will be arranj -\ before the expira
tion of the seventeen days' armistice, and
it will probably be necessary to make one
if not several extensions of the time.
The Porle is now blowing hot and cold.
The strength of the Russian and German
influence in Constantinople is the imme
diate key to the situation. Efforts are
being made, especially in Paris, to show
the foreign controller of the Sultan is the
Czar, not Emperor William, and the letter
of the Russian Emperor to the Sultan,
which secured the armistice, is quoted as
proof of this. English diplomats are be
ginning to undeceive themselves and
recognize that the three emperors ara
jointly in full control at Constantinople.
Meanwhile actual peace negotiations are
not even begun, for the Embassadors at
Constantinople telegraphed their Govern
ments for Instructions only to-day. Specu
lation about the terms thereof is only
guesswork.
A dispatch to the Daily Telegraph from
Vienna says it is stated semi-officially
that there is a serious difference in the
Greek Cabinet, and the Premier will prob2
ably resign after ieace is trroclaimed.
This is connected with tlie likelihood of
anti-dynastic manifestations, especially
against the Crown Prince. O:iou, the Rus
sian Minister, and other envoys have
warned Ralh not to foster such manifesta
tions.
The Chronicle's Vienna correspondent
says the overthrow of the Greek dynasty
was only averted last week by the ener
petic action of the powers, Onou warning
Ralli in the plaine t terms that what the
powers were doing was more for the
dynasty's sake than for Greece.
RANK COWARDICE.
Correspondents Tell of the Peculiar
Conduct of Constantino Â£r.d
His Officers.
PARIS, France, May 2Lâ Fresh charges
of cowardice and iucompetency against
I'rir.ce Ccnstantine are arriving almost
constantly from correspondents with the
Greek army whose communications have
escaped falsification by Greek censor 3.
A French reporter writes that during
the fighting on the frontier the Crown
l'rince was at Lanssa, far awa\* from the
scene of battle, smoking cigarettes and
readme novels. On the morning of the
evacuation of L.irissa the Crown Prince
\va~ aboard the first train that departed
and women and children wore ejected
from the cars to make room for him and
his horses.
At Velestino, the correspondent says,
â two officers drove two wounded privates
from the train going to Voio in order that
they ruieht take thc-ir jlaces. In many
cases whole battalions were abandoned by
officers, who sought safety in flight, while
the men continued lighting without leaa
e s. Generals Bmolenski and Yanikosti
are highly praised by the correspondents,
â who also speak in the highest terms ot
the Greek evzones and artillery. These
men, all accounts agree, continued fight
ing to the last and retired only after they
had been ordered repeatedly to retreat.
Aruilcar Cipriani, the Italian Socialist
leader, who was wounded while fighting
on the Greek side, describes the Greek
soldiers as plucky and courageous, but
declares the leaders incapable and the
monarch treacherous, the King betraying
Greeca in order to safeguard his dynasty.
FOREIGNERS FIRED UPON.
Bashi Bazouks and Insurgents Yet
Make Things Lively on Crete
island.
PARIS. France, May 21. â A sensation
was caused to-ctay by the receipt of a dis
patcti from Canea, Crete, stating an at
tempt had been made to shoot three
French naval officers. Admiral Pottier,
commander of the French squadron, went
ashore at Canea yesterday for the first
time since his arrival there. He was ac
companied by two chief officers of the
riapship Charner. When the trio landed
they were tired upon nve times by a num
ber of Bashi Bazouks (Turkish irregular
troops), but no one was hit.
LONDON, Eng., May 2Lâ An hour pre
v.ous to. the attack on Admiral Pottier,
mention of which is made in the dispatch
from Paris. Vice-Admiral Harris, comman
der of the British fleet, wa? subjected to a
similar fusi.'ade. Later Oitoman soldiers
fired upon British sailors. Vice- Admiral
Harris subsequently sent an ultimatum
to the insurgents demanding that they re
store the arms of Lieutenant Nelson, the
British officer who was robbed in tbe
vicinity oi Smia on Wednesday. The Brit
ish cruiser Cambrian has pone from
Canea to Suda Bay to enforce the ulti
matum. Both Musselmans and Christians
are getting beyond control. The former
threaten to prevent the Turkish soldiers
from departing from the island. There is
some brigandage among the insurgents.

Divinity School has ju-t graduated the
first native African in the history of the
school. Louis Pennick Clinton, a native*
born African, the hereditary King of the
Bassa tribe, has been made a minister of
the Free Baptist church.
The Bassa tribe is a powerful one, esti
mated at 2,000,000. Clinton, or So-Mayou,
as he calls his iribal name, is a typical
African, with flattened nose, big lips and
retreating temple. He is oi stocky build,
weighing 145 pounds an j standing 5 feet
5 inches. His address is good, and En
giish he speaks fluently. fco-Mayou's
plans are to return to his tribe. He in
tends to go back in the spring of 1898 and
live among his people â a people barbar
ous, addicted to cannibalism, supersti
tious, knowing nothing of civilization ex
cept what they have learned from inter
course witn foreign traders, sharp and
bright enough iv their way, but in great
terror of the medicine man.

JUDGE CONVICTED
OF BRIBE-TAKING
Tried on Two Charges
in a United States
Court.
A Leading Texan Republican
and Held in General
Esteem.
His Friends Believe Him Innocent
and a Victim of Circumstances
and Conspirators.
PARIS.Tex, May 21. â E. H. Leutweiler,
formerly United States Commissioner at
Duncan, Ind. T., who has been on trial in
the United States court in this city for
two days past upon a charge of bribery,
was to-day found guilty as charged in two
of the indictments.
Owing to the prominence of Judge Leut
weiler the trial Las attracted widespread
attention, and the courtroom was tin onged
while it was in progress. The evidence
upon which he was convicted showed that
he bad accepted a bribe of $125 from a
physician in a liquor case and a bribe of
$500 in another case from a wealthy iarmer
whose relative was in trouble upon an
other account.
Leutweiler does not deny receiving
money from the parties named, but claims
thai it was not received as a bribe, but in
payment of attorney fees due him in j
cases In other courts. The Judge has
many friends here and throughout Texas
who believe him to be innocent and but
the victim of circumstances and conspir
acy. He was ably represented by counsel,
and the verdict was a surprise. Doubtless
a motion will be made ior a rehearing.
Leutweiler is one of the prominent Re
publicans, not only of the panhandle
country, but of Texas, and solely through
his efforts many counties were carried for
the McKinley delegates to the National
convention at St. Louis. He was also a
member of the delegation that went to
Canton to formally present the name of
National Committeeman John Grant for
a Cabinet portfolio. Judge Leutweiler re
sides at Bowie, Texas, where he is uni
versally esteemed.
EASTERN OR CALIFORNIA STONE?
Supervising Architect A ken Talks of the
Pest office Building â Interest of the
Southern Pjcfic.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.-The
Call correspondent had another inter
view with the supervising architect of the
Treasury to-day about the San Francisco
Postoffice building. Mr. Aiken was shown
some of the copies of The Call containing
editorial expressions of the paper as well
aa interviews of prominent businessmen
of California in favor of using stone from
California quarries in the structure in
stead cf Eastern material. Mr. Aiken
said:
''I have noticed in The Call the oeoplo
of San Francisco are considerably exer
cised about the suggestion that Eastern
stone miatht be used. You may say to
your people that as far as I am concerned
I am heartily in favor oi BOOK s'one f.orn
the California quarries. I waH in Cali
fornia two years ago, and irom persona!
observation I know that the stone in the
quarries of that State is of excellent
quality. l)f course, I do not know just
how long my tenure of office will be, but
if I have anything to do with the matter
the stone used will be from California
quarries."
Mr. Aiken mentioned ieveral quarries.
He was inclined to believe that the granite
and marble quarries in the State would be
much bsiter for a building of such pro
portions than either sandstone or lime
stone, both of which latter were well
enough for smaller building!. He men
tioned particularly the .Raymond granite
and Inyo County marble for the
Postoffice building. He thought th at
it might be a good plan to construct
the lower story of granite and the upper
part of marble. Be believed that this
would be a very pretty combination. The
suggestions were merely tnntative, how
ever. He said he had no preference as be
tween the various California quarries and
no favoritism to show.
In the course of a rambling conversation
the supervising architect inadvertently let
out a hint thai will surprise San Francisco
people. The Southern Pacific Railroad
agent here may endeavor to have the
stone shipped from the East in order to
give them a longer haul. Mr. Aiken did
not make this positive statement ; itcame
about in this way :
"What influence might bring about the
selection of Eastern material?" asked
The Call correspondent.
The supervising architect smiled as he
replied: "Oh, various influences over
which I would have no control, as, for in
stance, the Southern Pacific Railroad,
which seems to be all powerful in Wash
ington."
Mr. Aiken added that be had no knowl
edge that the railroad would attempt any
thing of the kind. It was merely a sur
mise on hit part. He said that of course
the officers of the department would not
knowingly favor the railroad company,
but there were various ways in which the
railroad might bring influence to bear.
Senatorial and Congressional influence
might be a factor, be said.

Suddenly she turned pale and fell back

IN SYMPATHY WITH
CUBAN INSURGENTS

happening is due to cowardice and feeble
ness of the Government."
Senator Comas sud : "You will discuss
that to-morrow,"
"We will discuss it," replied the Duke
of Tetuan, "but I will accept dictation
from nobody."
"Nor I either," retorted Comas.
At this the Duke boxed both ears of
Comas and felled him to the floor. Comas'
son threw himself upon the Duke and
struck him a heavy blow with his fist.
Several Senators intervened and a general
scuffle ensued.
In the Chamber Representative Mores
questioned the Premier on the subject.
Canovas declared that the Government
entirely approved of Weyler's policy and
accepted the responsibility therelor. It
bad full confidence in his statements con
cerning the decline of the rebellion. The
Government, the Premier added, had no
diplomatic information to communicate.
Its exchange of views with the powers re
garding Cuba bad always been unofficial.
The powers maintained great reserve in
the matter, but their attitude induced the
belief thai they would not offer effective
intervention. Tne exchange of communi
cations with the United States had been
friendly, but Spain had refused the prof
fered American mediation and had de
clared she would not submit to foreign
interference.
Liberal members of the Senate have de
cided not to attend the sittings of that
body until the Duke of Tetuan gives satis
faction to Comas and the Liberal party
tor the insult he has given him and it.
WILLING TO GO TO WAR.
Spain Said to Be Determined Not
to Tolerate Foreign Interven
tion in Cuba.
LONDON, Enq., May 21.â The Stan
dard's Madrid correspondent says that
in political and official circles the opinion
is held that tne relations between Spain
and the Uuiied States are not li&ely to be
much altered by the adoption of Morgan's
resolution, inasmuch as the Spaniards
don't believe McKiniey and Sherman will
ailow :he Senate to drive them into a con
flict. The country is willing to go to war
rather than discuss the independence or
sale of Cuba or tolerate fureign interven
tion.
GUARD THE CONSULATE.
Spanish Troops Will Prevent Any
Insult to Consul-Genera!
Lee.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 21.â 1t is ru
mored here that a mob in Havana has
made demonstrations against the Ameri
can consulate. The report is not cor
roborated, however.
There is considerable excitement in
Havana over Washington reports, and it
is understood that the palace officials are
greatly worried over recent leports sent
them by De Lome.
The Spanish officials, fearing some out-
break by the people when the news got
out, quietly placed a guard of troops
around the American consulate, though
they are ostensibly placed thereto guard
another building.
ALL AMERICANS BARRED.
Pr.nce Luigi H'isfcfb His Expedition to
Mount St. El i as to Be Exclusively
Italian.
BOSTON, Mass., May 2Lâ Prince Luigi
bars all Americans from his expedition to
Mount (St. Elias. The Appalachian Moun
tain Club is greatly interested in his ex
pedition, but it wiil not take part in it.
Correspondence has been maintained be
tween Sella, the Italian photographer,
and Professor C. E. Fay of the Appala
chians. In one of these letters Sella thus
expresses nimseif:
"The young Duca Peg i Abruzzi is
jealous to keep for his expedition aii ex
clusively Italian character and would be
sorry should anything occur to make it
appear otherwise."
The Prince brings with him a party of
friends who are experienced in mountain
ascents, including Seila and probably
others of the Italian Alpine clubs ml a
party of live guides, who have been
selected from the most skilled of tho-:e on
the Italian side of the Alps. No Appala
chian or other American will be a member
of (he climbing party.
On the other hand the Appalachians
will not be guilty of the discourtesy of
permitting this exploring party-of repre
sentatives of interests so allied to its own
to pass through our country without re
ceiving such aid as wiil serve to bring it
most easily to the scene of its real alpine
activities and to give it the greatest pos
sible assistance within these lines. Pro
fessor Fay has therefore been exceedingly
interested in securing transportation fa
cilities., including a small steamer for use
beyond Sitka and Porters to carry pro
visions to the base of the mountain, and
tne fullest possible supply of information
regarding the mountain and its difficul
ties, all of which tne club is very glad to
do to aid the visitors.
UNITED STATES CONSULS.
After a Tour of the World Chief Chilton

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.â Chief
of the State Department's Consular Bureau
Chilton returned from a trip around the
worid inspecting consulates and will sub
mit a detailed report to Secretary Sher
man upon the general system. He visited
every United fctates consulate in Great
Britain, France, Germany. Austria, Italy
and the smaller countries of Europe and
then crossed to Egypt. In Europe Chil
ton found the service on the whole in ex
cellent condition, althougU he will report
that several barnacles in the Government
employ for years might be removed and
their places filled by competent men. He
says no consular system in the world is
better than ours and that European of
ficials are now admitting that United
States Consuls are doing more for their
Government than those of any other
country. In Cuina and Japan Chilton
found some defects in the prevailing sys
tem. As a result of h s tour a general re
arrangement of the present system will
probably be ordered.

AN IRISH RELIEF
POLICY OUTLINED
Balfour Makes a Most
Important Statement
in the Commons.
It Is Proposed to Pay Poor
Rates and County Cess
Out of the Exchequer.
One of the Greatest Reforms to
Be Carried Out Under the
S fest Conditions.
LONDON, Exg., May 21.â First Lord of
the Treasury aiid Government Leader
Balfour made an important statement in
the House of Commons today regarding
the Government's Irish policy, which will
be carried out next session.
He said it was the intention of the Gov
ernment to place both the poor law and
the country's administration on a broad,
popular basis. Landlords will be relieved
of all rural rates. At present land-owners
are liable for half of the poor rates, which
the Government proposes to pay herealter
oat of the imperial fund. Tenants are
liable for the other half of the poor rates
and the county cess. The Government
proposes hereafter to pay the county ces3
out of the imperial fund.
BaJfour explained that this double
benefit to the two classes would enable
the Government to launch a scheme for
local government. He couid not give the
details of this scheme, which would piacea
large charge upon the exchequer; but it
was a charge which the country at large
and the Unionists would not grudge if
thereby they could see the way to carry
out the reforms to which they had pledged
themseiv s.
Balfour tnought every class of the coun
try was disposed to favor what must
prove one of the greatest reforms carried
out under the salest conditions ever sug-
Kested.
Loud cheers greeted the announcement
of this Irish relief policy.
FATHER KIEIPPE
CALLED TO REST
Continued from First Page.
spired by a Bavarian priest, the ADoe
Kneipi c. and cousists in packs and local
cold water applications. Ii condemns
shower-baths and all surface friction. The
use of the towel is absolutely forbidden.
Once wet the patient must remain wet
till dried by nature.
The devotees wring their nightgowns
out in the basin and go to bed in them.
They also wear wet stockings a specified
length of time each day or walk bare
footed in wet grass or snow. They may
not take coffee or liquor, or wear flnnuel
or silk, or furs or corsets. The regimen
is severe and the garment worn near the
skin, summer or winter, is of coarse,
brown linen, known as Carnieiito or
Kneippiste linen.
Naturally this heroic Cnrmelitist treat
ment is easiest followed in the country,
The Late Father Kneippe
and within a short time the abbe's little
village of Woerischoff'-n in Bavaria has
become a place of pilgrimage so renowned
that in five months last summer nearly
20,000 visitors, it is said, registered there.
Ii is the quality of these visitors that at
tracts attention, for they number among
them such important personages as the
Rothschilds of Vienna, the Duke and
Duchess Paul of Mecklenburg, the Duke
d'Alencon, the Infanta Maria Therese of
Portugal, the Persian Shah's daughter
and Bishops, patriarchs and papal nun
cios.
Ttie things that such people do every
body else wants to do, and so the Kneippe
cure is the fashion.
Moreover pome value has been found in
it. The German physicians who began
by pooh-poohing have ended by certify
ing that the humble aobe is a natural
physician and his system worth the atten
tion of the scientifically trained doctor,
and everybody in the German countries
to-day has Kneippiste literature in the
hand.
As to Father Kneippe himself he seems
to bear modestly his honors, which have
recently culminated in bis being ruanded
to Rome to treat the Pope. Credit is evi
dently due him for a disinterested effort
to bring luxury-enfeebled people back to
nature, and the simple and regular life of
the orders appear to have furnished bim
the model.
The matter has ended by reaching
France and there are, it is said, already
several Kneippiste journals, pharmacies
and physicians, and the gossip is of a
Kneippe institution to treat invalids at
Paris.
DIHGLtY'S TARIFF BILL.
ft Will Soon Come Up for Consideration in
the Senate, but Can't Become a
Law by July 1.
WASHINGTON. D C, May 21.â it is
probable tiiat the Dingloy tariff bill, as re
vised by the Senate Committee on Fi
nance, will be called up for action in the
Senate Monday, according to the pro
gramme already agreed upon, unless the
Senate shall adjourn immediately after
the meeting out of respect to the memory
of the late Senator Earle of South Caro
lina. Should this Â»ction take place the
tariff bill will come up Tuesday, and
Aidrich, as spokesman of the Republican
members of the Finance Committee, will
explain its provisi >ns in detail to the Sen
ate in a speech which he has been busily
working upon for the paa t few days. Pre
liminary to the consideration of the bill
in the Senate the Republican Senators
will hold a caucus Monday morning to
agree upon a plan for controlling the time
of debate, which under the rules of the
Senate can only be done by an amicable
understanding.
it is probable the work of considering
the schedules will begin promptly, with
out any formal preliminary speeches on
either bide, except that of Aldrich, and
possibly a rejoinder from Vest as spokes
man for the minority of the Finance Com
mittee. On both sides of the chamber
there is an evident detire to dispose of the
bill at the earliest day, but promises orisi-
nally made by the Senators in charue
that it will be a law by July 1 can hardly
be kept.

HUMAN FLESH IN THE VAT.
Chicago Police Claim That the Noose Is
Tightening Around the Sausage
Manufacturer's Neck.
CHICAGO, 111., May 21.â Frank Bial,
formerly night watchman at Luetgert's
sausage factory, has iniormed the police
that a few nights before the disappearance
of Mrs. Luetgert he helped his employer
to rill the vat in which the police say the
woman's body was destroyed. The con
tents, he snys, were of a different charac
ter from what had ever before been used,
and he burned his hand so badly that he
had to carry it in a sling for a week.
Analytical chemists say that the flesh
and bones in and about the vat are human.
More bloodstains and hair, said to be
human, have been found, and the police
claim that t.e noose is tightening around
Luetgert's neck.
There are still many persons who be
lieve him innocent and that Mrs. Luet
gert will yet be found alive. The testi
mony of credible witnesses who have
claimed to have seen her near Kenosha
since the date of the alleged murder will,
they believe, bd fnJlv substantiated.

Influence of the Works of
the Great Writer.
LONDON, EJRJ., May 21.â A large and
distinguished company today witnessed
the unveiling of the bust of Sir Walter
Scott In poets' corner, Westminster Ab
bey. The ceremony was performed by tiie
Duke o: Bucc.euch and Queensberry.
Among many notable persons present
were: Ilignt Hon. Arthur Ballour, Lord
Tennyson, sou of the In te poet laureate,
and United States Embassador Hay. The
Dean o: Wesimin>ter presided.
Balfour delivered a brief speed), eulo
g.zing the work of Scott, and was fol
lowed by Emb;t?sador Hay. Hay said
that no face in modern history was better
known than Scott's, except that of Napo
leon. He himself, he said, represented
one of Scott's immense constituencies.
Nowhre had Scoti's writings received
greater welcome than in America. When
that country was young the books most
read were Scott's poem, "Magic and Sen
timent," and his "Romance of Chivalry."
Scot', Colonel Hay said, had not exerted
maierial political influence in America,
but he still had enormous influence other
wise upon the people who were peculiarly
sensitive owing to their environment.
The Duke of Jiuccleuch and Queensberrv
said be was proud of the idea that he wa3
one of the few left who had shaken hands
with Scott, though ho hud done so as a
baby.

Brooke, commanding the Department of
the Missouri, will be made a majur-gen
eral, to succeed General .Bliss, reiired.
There was some thouglit of promoting
General Coppinger to be a major-general,
but as his promotion several years ago to
be a brigadier-eeneral over General Shafrer
and other;<, through the influence of Mr.
Blame, created a good deal of adverse
criticism, it wns deemed wise not to nomi
nate him over the head of General Brook",
who has been twice passed. Besides, the
administration sees mat a storm of criti
cism is already brewing on account of the
army promotions an<t retirements made
recently. A good many tern news
papers are criticizing the President for in
creasing the retired list in order that he
may' make all the more army . appoint

HEALTH FREE
IT IS ADMITTED THAT THE
only thing on earth that is absolutely
priceless is health. When once gone

great trouble seems to be that those who
are ill do not apply for relief in time, or if
they do they go to where- they have the
least chance of finding help The man-
agement of thi Hudson Medical Institute
has decidrd that for a week they will give
quite freely to those who are ill the latest
work on nervous diseases which has been
issued by their specialists. And in addi-
tion they propose to send a neat pocket
memorandum-book to all those who will
apply for it in the manner described be-
low, PROVIDING THAT THEY ARE
ILL. This is an attempt to help the sick
and should not b; taken advantage of by
those who. are well. Cut this coupon out

After the election Supreme Chancellor
Colgrovc was esccrted to the opera-house,
where he delivered an address to tho
Grand Lodge. The Rathbona Sisters
were especially invited, as were a number
cf citizens. The address was an admirable
one and elicited prolonged applause. At
us conclusion Stanton L. Carter of Fresno,
for the Grand Lodge, stepped lorward
ana presented the supreme chancellor
-with a diamond stud as a token of the
high esteem in which he is held by Cali
. Knights. Eloquent and ready as
he is, tue chancellor could not speak for
tiie moment, so affected was he by this
unexpected expression of regard lrom his
fellows. However, he replied, fittingly
exiuc^sing his deep appreciation and
speaking of the splendid personnel of the
order in this State.
Tne la;er part of the session of the day
was devoted to the exemplification ol the
wurk of the order by the supreme chan
cellor.
This evening a magnificent banqnet was
spread for Hie members of the Grand
LoduÃ at Hiii'a Hall, while (lie Kathbone
B -;>:. r s w -re entertained in the lodgerooru
by the local lodge. And thus the enter
tainment cf the visitors as Knights and

To-morrow the entertainment goes for
ward at an increased impetus, as the city
of Hanford will celebrate the coming of
the San Jnaquin Valley Railroad and the
emancipation of the valley. All is in
reaJiness for the big demonstration.
Two trains will bring visitors over the

advices that Claus Spreckels wiil not be j
able to be present, and great disappoint- i
nient is manifested on this account, as he I
is the man the city desired most to honor, j
Terminating the day's demonstration, I
which will begin witu a salute ot 200 guns |

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 22, 1897.
SUPREME CHANCELLOR COLGROVE.
Career of the High Official Who Is Visiting the Knijhts of
Pythias at Hanford*
HANFORD, Cal., May 21.â Supreme Chancellor Philip T. Colgrove, now visiting the Grand
Lodge of Knights of Pythias in this city, is tne youngest of the long iine who have ever held
his high office. He is but 38 years of age, and his tour of visitation is also his wedding jour
ney. His wife has received the same marked attention at the hands oi the ladies of Hanford
and the Rathboue Sisters that he has received from the Knights. He is a man or force and
character, besides being hundsome and jolly. His strong point, is eloquent speech, and he has
made an excellent impression upon the local Knights.
Supreme Chancellor Colgrove 's home is at Hastings, Mich., where he was admitted to prac
tice before the Supreme Court of that State on his twenty-tirst birthday in 1879. Ha was
elected District Attorney in 1882 and was twice afterward re-elected. Ho was once chosen to
represent his district in the State Senate and declined a renorainat ion. He is president of the
State Republican League, and hug been chairman of the State Control Committee for several
years. He was nominated for Congress in 1894 but declined, as he was then in line for his
present office, and decidtd that he could not hold the two offices.
The high office which he holds in the order of Knights of Pythias is one that must be
reached step by step through all the chairs of the local lodges and the Slate Grand Lodge to
the Supreme Lodge. There advancement goes rather by selection. He was elected to the
Supreme Lodge at the Milwaukee session in 1890. In 1892 he was made chairman of the com
mittee on law, which is the position that puts the man to the lest. He survived the test and
whs made tbe supreme vice-chancellor at Washington in 18i>4, Â«nd at Cleveland last year he
mounted to where the order has nothing further to give. His office is to the order what the
Presidency of the United S.ates is to the Nation. Ha Is commauder-in-chief of the Uniform
Rauk and chairman of the board of control of the Endowment Rank. His term of office is two
years. He receives a salary of $5000 per year and expenses, with $2500 for a secretary.
Colgrove Is intenseJy patriotic, and in his address before the Grand Lodge the flag and
country wag his theme, and he fairly carried those who heard him off their (ML He is a
member of tne Hastings Battalion. Uniform Rank, and has held the position of left guide in
that famous organization, and despite the fact that he is coniraaiider-in-chief of all the uni
form orders, he fills the position of left guide in all the exhibition or contest drills of hia own
baUalioJ.
la the history of the order this is but the third time a supreme chancellor hes visited the
coast. Colgrove says he thought he would reverse the custom and give the West a great part
of his attention. H-j has come from British Columbia, visiting the grand lodges of Oregon and
Washington on the way. He will spend another week in tills State, visiting Los Angeles and
San Francisco; thence he goes !o Arizona, Nevada and Utah and expects to arive home the lat
ter part of June. Later he goes to the maritime provinces of New Uruuswick, where there is a
grand ledge.
Speaking of the order to-day to The Call representative the supreme chancellor said :
"It is the only frÂ«ternal order thÃt Is chartered by act of Congress. When we went before
Congress in 1904 and asked for a charter the question was out to <i~, 4 By what ri-jht ao you
ask 11 ? The Matons, Odd Fellows, nor any other orderF, are charton-d by Congress.' Our reply
was that all other orders originated in other lands. The Knights of Pytliias is essentially
American and it must remain so. It is confined to North America; it was organized to cement
the brotherhood of Americans throughout ull the States and tho members of its Uniform
Rank, 48,000 strong, are pledged to the defense of the flag, to exchange their swords
lor muskets whenever the country calls upon them. On a page of the records of tbe earliest
grand lodge at Washington are these words, "Adjourned for the defense of the flig. 1 We got
our charter.
"I consider, for tho reasons given, the Uniform Rank to be the most important brar,ch of
the order. Its members art; recognized, tnough perhaps not officially, by State and Nation o&.
citizen soldiers. The Government has loaned it horses, tents and other paraphernalia at its
encampments.
"The Endowment Rank is the insurance branch of the order and It carries $102,000,000 of
insura c;. On the 31st of March It had paid out .i?3o8.000 upon policies for the three months
preceding. It has a reserve fund of $750,000. The government of the order is formed upon
the same lines as that of the Nation, having three arms, legislative, executive and judicial,
and Is tie only fraternal order so constituted. Ail questions of law are submitted to the tri
bunals, and appeals may be carried from the lower courts to the supreme tribunal, composed
of five judges. Tiieir judsmen's are printed, and we now have two books of these die slons.
The order is in the highest state of prosperiiy."
SAN DIEGO SMUGGLERS.
Arrest of Two Men Charged With Bnng-

SAN DIEGO, Cal., May 21.â James D.
Wright and Peter Asmussen were arrpsted
this afternoon by Chinese Inspector Nor
man chargeJ with aiding Chinese laborers
to enter United St3tes territory. The
men were taken before United States
Commissioner Knoles and held to answer
in the United States District Court.
Wright's bond was fixed at $2000, in de
fault of which be went to jail. It is
claimed that he has for two years past
been tne leader of a band of border ruf
fians whose principal business has been
smuggling Mexican goods and opium and
running Chinamen across the line. His
latest venture was the purchase of a small
schooner, which he named the Punta
Kami i. With his little vessel he would
sail down the Mexican coast, put into
port on .-ome pretcx: and get away again
without exiiting comment with from five
to ten Chinamen aboard. He knows
every taile of the coast between Ensenada
and Santa Monica and on his last trip he
ran into San Juan and larded eight Celes
tials in an open boat. The authorities
estimate that he has been instrumental in
getting over 200 Chinamen into tnis coun
try in the past two years.

TWO LIVES SAVED
BY SKIN-GRAFTING
Novel Surgical Cases in
Stockton and Los
Angeles.
Five Thousand Pieces of Cuti
cle Used on a Single
Patient.
Many Persons Contribute to Save
the Sufferers From Death
by Torture.
/
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., May 21.â A suit
tried in the Superior Court to-day dis
closed tbe details of a most interesting
surgical case. A local physician sued the
receiver of tbe bankrupt Los Angeles Iron
and iSteel Company for $2250, and a drug
gist demanded of the same defendant
$357. The bills are for medical services
and medicine for a boy named Lamar
Moore, who was scalded by stepping into
a barrel of boiling water at the rolling
mill in January, 1896.
The boy was employed at the mill and
accidentally stepped into the barrel which
was set into tne ground to receive con
densed steam from the engine. Wnen
taken from the boiling water he was in a
horrible condition and there seemed little
hope of saving his life. The usual treat
ment for burns was applied, and the
physician who is the i iai uiff in this suit
was called to give attendance.
The doctor was assisted by others of his
profession, and they together planned to
make young Moore whole again by the
process of skin-grafting to replace the
cutfele that had peeled from his legs as a
result of '.be scalding. The boy was a
great sufferer, but he stood the ordeal
well. In the proc3ss of grafting new skin
from kind contributors to the quivering
Hesh of the unfortunate boy, 5200 pieces of
cuticle were used. They were donated by
fellow-employe) and sympathizing strang
ers, imd one section came from the person
of the receiver of the mill, Willis J. Boyle,
the defendant in this suit. The patches
of sfctn varied in size from a half inch to
an inch square, and the persons who
sacrificed them for humanity's sake
showed mucn fortitude.
The boy's life was spared, but he is not
vet well, though the most of the trans
planted cuticle grew upon tho wounds.
The doctor and druggist sued the receiver
of the company for their bill, holding the
company responsible for the accident.
Judge Shaw this afternoon rejected the
drug bill entirely, and ordered that $10 be
aliowed the doctor.

Two Ynung Women Contribute Cuticle to
bare a Child.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 21.â Quite a
remarkablo skin-grafting operation has
been performed on little Elsie Galbraitb
by Drs. Fitzgerald and Hinkie. Two or
three weeks ago Elsie, the four-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Gal
braith, who live near Collegeville, was
severely burned while playing with other
children. The little ones built a bonfire
and the dress ol Elsie was ignited. Her
lÂ«>gs and back were badly burned and the
physicians found that the skin was en
tirely destroyed and that new nkin would
have to be grafted to prevent ihe muscies
from contracting.
The case was explained to the family,
and while the lather and mother were
both willing to part with portions of their
cuticle for their child the doctors pre
ferred the skin of younger people.
They did not. have any difficulty in find
ing it, for an aunt of the little child and
another young <ady, who was staying at
the house, at once volunteered to con
tribute. The skin was taken from their
arms, several hundred pieces being needed
to cover the burned flesh of the child. It
was cut as deeply as possible without
causing excessive bleeding. The subjects
submitted to the operation witnout an
anesthetic, but they suffered many a
sharp twitch lor the sake of the child
whom they loved.
Each bit of skin was put on the child's
body, the pieces being placed at a slight
distance from each other, ;o that they
might crow together. They were then all
covered and the child is now doing nicely.

tor the Murder of George $.
Wash burn.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 21.â Benito
Lopez, the 70-year-old murderer of George
S. Washburn of San Andres, Calaveras
County, walked calmly from his cell in
murderers' row, at the Folaom State
Prison, this mornine, climbed the lew
steps leading to the gallows and was
launched into eternity.
Lopez passed a peaceful night, sleeping
as calmly as a child. He arose early, ate
a hearty breakfaat and passed the rest of
his brief span of life in the company of
his spiritual advisers, Father Santan
dreu, pastor of the Spanish church of
San Francisco, and Father Hunt of this
city. When on the gallows, the former
stated that Lopez asked pardon for all his
sins and forgave all his enemies.
Lopez and bis victim, George S. Wash
burn, were residents of San Andreas and
near neighbors. Both men wore well ad
vanced in years and had frequently quar
reled.
Lopez was the possessor of a well, the
water of whicn overflownd and ran onto
the place of his victim. On the day of the
murder, the 4th of April, 151*3, Washburn
was attempting to dig a small ditcn across
Ihe road to lead the surplus water away
lrom his grounds, when he was accosted
by Lopez, who demanded that he stop the
work he was engaged in and leave. One
word brought on anotner, and eventually
he called Lopez an old tnief, and the lat
ter stepped into his cottage, picked up a
revolver and shot Washbura dead.
Among the eye- witnesses of tho murder
was G orge B. Washburn of San Fran
cisco, a son of the murdered man, aiid
Sheriff Ben Thorn of Calaveras County.
Tue latter says Lopez once stabbed a man
in San Andreas, and he was suspected of
having murdered a man several years ago,
but the authorities were never able to
iasten the crime upon him. The Sheriff
says Lopez was always considered a dan
gerous man.

REDWOOD CITY. Cal.. May 21.â Dor*
Wilson yesterday Hied a contest of the
will of the late Jjumj Quentin, who died
at San Gregorio last October and left an
estate whicli has bjen appraised a: $103,
--000. It consists of real aud personal prop
erty and money in bank.
Quentin left a will by which he disposed
of all his estate, leaving v to friends and
to orphan asylums, as he iiad no relatives.
In the will there is an express provision
that none of the property ahcu.d go to
Dora Horn or any member of the Horn
family on the ground that they have no
claims upon him. Dora Wilson (formerly
Dora Horn) now seeks to break the will,
claiming that she is the daughter of the
deceased. It is believed sue has a good
one.
Mrs. Horn, the mother of the contest
ant, was at one time married to James
Quentin, but they were divorced before
Dora was born. In the will it is alleged
that Dora is the daughter of J;imes Horn.
The case may possibly be compromised,
but should it come to a hearing sensa
tional evidence will be introduced.
After setting forth her relationship to
the deceased the contestant alleges that
at the time when thu wili was mad*
James Quentin was not of sound and dis
posing mind, and by reason thereof was
incompetent to make any will. She
charges that undue influence was exerted
over him by Thoma* Stealey, who, with
his wife, is a devisee to the extent of one
third or all the real and personal estate of
Quentin.
POINT LOMA'S UNIVERSITY.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., May 21.â Dr. R. A.
Partridge and wife of Cincinnati to-day
took formal pors?ssion of the hand
some Queen Anne cottage that has just
besn finished for trie use of the caretakers
of the property Known as the site of the
School lor the Revival of the Lost
Mysteries of Antiquity, the cornerstone
cf which was recently dedicated by Mrs.
Kate Tingley and the thcosophical cru
saders accompanying her.
For sÂ«veral weeks following Mrs. Ting
ley's departure little was done by tha
theosonhists, and the opinion became
general that tlie scheme to establish a
.university on Point Loma was visionary
and unreal and would probably never
materialize. Soon, however, money began
to arrive from the East, consigned to
Ballou <&,, Cosgrove, ihe wholesale mer
chants who are acting as financial agents
fjr the school.
This was followed by the building of the
cottage and other improvements, sucn as
grading and fencing, and then more land

SHOT AT WHILE SEARCHING
THE PASSENGERS.
The Dead Man Believed by Some to
Be Dunham, the Campbell
Murderer.
TACOMA. Wash., May 22.â The most
desperate attempt at robbery by a single
bandit ever recorded in this section was
made this afternoon. Nearly five miles
miles southwest of this city, on tne Steila
coom division of the Tacoma Railway
Company's lines, an unknown man, at
4:30 o'cloct, entered a car on its way to
Tacoma, ordered the passencers to throw
up their hands and was searching their
pockets when Superintendent T. L. Dame
opened fire on him. The robber returned
the fire, wounding Dame and two others.
Then Dame killed the robber.
The car was coming upgrade when a
rough-looking man signaled it to stop and
stepped on the front platform. As he did
ko he drew down over his face a piece of
blue and white gingham with eyeholes
cut through, and pointing a revolver at
the passengers gave the order, "Hands
up." Superintendent Dame was on board
and running the car, Motorman Wellman
Leine at his side. They were ordered to
the farther end of the car ana passed into
the rear part, used for carrying baggage.
The robber stepped into the main part,
where seven passengers sat. He ordered,
"Men put hands up and ladies sit still,"
searched the roctets of Contractor George
B. Evans and had commenced on William
E. Hacker when Superintendent Dame
came forward with revolver in band,
threw his weapon over Haclcer's shoulder
and pulled the trigger. The highwayman
turned quickly and fired three snots In
rapid succession. Dame fired once more.
Tne robber staggered backward to the front
platform and fell oft, dead. Wnen picked
up nis head was lying in the mud and
his feet upon tne track.
The robber's first bullet struck Dame in
the Jefc arm, just below the elbow, break
ing and shattering the bones. The second
struck Jewett Smith, advertising agent of
the company, in ihe left leg. near the hip,
piving him a bad wound. The third bul
let passed tnroush the partition between
ttie passenger and baggage compartments
and struck Motorman Howard Wellman
in the breast, over the heart. It caused
only a triflina wound, oeing a spent ball.
Conductor Ciendennin and the passen
gers lifted the dead desperado into the
baggage end and ran the train speedily
to the city. Smith was taken to the
Funny Paddock Hospital, while Dame and
Weilman went to a physician's office to
have their wounds dressed.
The desperado's Dody was taken to the
morgue, where it haa been viewed to-night
by nearly 1000 men. At a late hour it re
mains unidentified. The police have been
investigating numerous reports as to the
robber's iaentity. One was that he was a
woodchopper named Moning, living near
the scene of the holu-up. This was quickly
disproved. Others claimed he much re
sembled Dunham, the California mur
derer. His appearance nearly tallies with
the description of a member of a gan<Â» of
train-robbers having headquarters at Rose
burs:, Or.
He was about 35 years of age, 6 feet 2
inches tall and of tine proportions. Under
a blue flannel shirt, old coat and rough
trousers he wore fine tailor-made trousers
and silk underweur. The only mark on
Ins body U a scar commencing at the top
of the forehead in the center and extend
ing straight upward for an inch and a
half into the hair.
Superintendent Dame was out on the
streets this evening, and many friends
were congratulating him on his bravery
and his escape with his life. The people
on the car were Motorman Wellman, Con
ductor Ciendennin, Jewett Smith, Mr. and
Mrs. W. F. Hacker, George Evans and
Mrs. Downing.

ROMANCE OF PORTLAND.
Untimely Hunger of a Yachtsman Defeats
the Pans of an Eioping
Couple.
PORTLAND, Or., May 21.â Horace
Thrall, the owner of a small;yacht,.last
night lost a {20 fee and spoiled what
might have been a sensational elopement,
just because he was hungry and could not
wait an hour or two to gratify his "gnaw
ing appetite," as he called it. At 8 o'clock
a fine-looking young couple engaged his
yacht at the foot of Taylor street to take
them down the river a few miles to inter
cept in Astoria-fcound steamer. The
yacht-owner was to receive $.0 for his ser
vices, but he insisted upon eating before
setting sail, despite the anxiety of the
young people to get away.
While Thrall was gorging himself an
other carriage drove down to the dock
and in the twinkling of an eye a woman
and two gentlemen alighted. The gentle
men quietly hustled the fair eloper into
the carriage, which was rapidly driven
uptown. By this time Thrall appeared
on the wharf, ready to sail, but instead of
his $20 fee he got a severe tongue-lashing
from the young man, and a few moments
later the latter proceeded uptown afoot,
in a most unamiabie mind.
The young man is Thomas W. Breeden,
son of a wealthy Cripple Creek (Colo.)
miner, who for several months success
fully wooed the young woman, Miss Susie
Galashman, in Denver. Her parents are
classed among the well-to-do.
The objection to the young man on the
part of Miss Galashman'^ people, who are
strict Catholics, is that he has a divorced
wife living. To her be was wedded
eighteen months ago, and they separated
eight months later. It now is but five
months since young Mr-. Breeden ob
tained a divorce.
To wean Miss Galashman from Breeden's
society the young woman, two weeks aeo,
was sent here to remain all summer with
a well-Known family, almost life-long
friends of her parents. Two days ago Miss
Galasbman's friends became apprised of
Breeden's presence in town.
He called on Miss GalaÂ«hman once only
and was permitted to see her in the pres
ence of a member of the family. The
manner in which the two subsequently
managed to communicate witn eacn other
or how they contrived to plan the unsuc
cessful elopement is not known. Yester
day afternoon Miss Galashman indis
creetly confi<lÂ«d the details of the plot to
a young nurse in the family, whom she
implcitly trusted. That was a fatal mis
take, for when tbe young woman was
missed in the evening the treacherous
nurse gave trie secret away.
PORTLAND GHOULS CAUGHT.
Stolen Body of Mill, on air 3 Ladd Found
Buried on a Farm Near ihs
the City.
PORTLAND, Or., May 21.â Detectives

ish plot, and tnis evening Welch and Sim
mons arrested Charles Montgomery, Ma

banker's body was concealed if the irons
were removed from him. He kept his
word, and the body was dug up at a depth
of eighteen inches on Maroon's farm.
Montgomery is a baa character, having

him but for tde timely arrival of Detective
Maher, who subdued him with a club.

YUMA, Ai:iz., May 21â Six weeks ago
Calvin De Turk and W. J. Trebarthen left
Yuma in a sKiff for Hardy Colorado Hot
Spring 3, seventy miles below Yama. The
former reached Hanlon's ranch, nine
miles below town Wednesday, and re
ported the death of his companion, Tre
barthen, by drowning. They attempted
to return from the springs by wa v of
Padrones Slough, a cutoff from the Colo
rado which shortens the distance by half,
but is exceedingly swift and dangerous,
the channel being deep and narrow.
At a place where the current is so swift
and the banks so close together tnat the
oars could not be used to propel the boat,
Trebarthen fell overboard in an attempt
to pull tne boat up stream by catching
hold of some willow bushes growing on
tne bank. The undercurrent pulled him
down, and he was swept down stream and
drowned. His partner could not find his
body, though he searched for two days.

Coast Students'
Conference.
Pacific Grove Welcomes Rep
resentatives From Many
Colleges.
Leaders In Gospel Work Present
to Give Counsel to the
Delegates.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 21.â The
little city among the pines is full of life
ana interest now, for the delegates to the
second annual Pacific Coast Students'
Conference have arrived. The young men
came on the evening train, full of the
breezy enthusiasm and heartiness of the
typical student. They were quickly
busied in getting settled in the quarters
wuich had been prepared for them by
their advance agents, but as a larger num
ber arrived than was expected upon the
first evening there was some delay and
confusion, and several of the young men
were obliged to go supperless 10 the pre
liminary meeting in the chapel of the M.
E. Church.
The first session of the convention was
called to order by Chairman C. C. Micn
ener of New York City, wbo is also college
secretary of the international committee
of the Young Men's Christian Association.
After an opening prayer and hymn Mr.
Michener delivered a short opening ad
dress, in which he made a few suggestions
regarding the methods of working, and
p'.aying also, during the convention.* He
introduced as the speater of the evening
F. L. Willis of Omaha, Neor.
Mr. Willis spoke of the marked advance
of the Y. M. C. A. work among the
students of the great colleges and univer
sities of America and the amount of good
being accomplished by this work. He
touched in a general way upon the aims
of the Y. M. C, A. and the object of the
convention, which was to ail in further
ing these aims.
H. J. McCoy, secretary of the Sau Fran
cisco Y. M. C A., and Robert E. Lewis of
Chicago delivered short talks.
F. L. "Willis was chosen presiding of
ficer of the convention and upon taKing
the chair asked as a notable feature of
this, the first session, that each delegate
introduce himself to him personally.
After the introductions Mr. Willis an
nounced that the afternoon proceedings
would consist exclusively of athletic
sports of various kinds, the programme to
be decided upon Irom day to day. The
work of the convention would be carried
on from 8 a., m. to 12:30 p. >t. and the plat
form exercises would be held iv the even
ing of each day.
Among the notable persons who will ad
dress the convention at these platform
meetings are: Bishop William Ford
Nichols of San Francisco, Rev. E. S. Chap
man of Oakland, Rev. George C.Adams,
Dr. E. R. Dille and Robert F. Lewis, of
Chicago, formerly college secretary of
Massachusetts, and who will have ch&rge
of the Bible cirss.
More time will be devoted this year
than last to the equipping of men for the
responsible work of Bible classes. Mr.
Lewis has charge of the missionary insti
tute, which will be the feature of the con
ference this year, as he is the traveling
secreiary of the Students' Volunteer
movement.
An exceedingly valuable eerie* of lect
ures on the development of missionary in
terest will be presented. The courses of
study to be pursued by missionary classes
â luring the coming yenr will be outlined.
Mr. Lewis will follow up the work begun
by Mr. Eddy last year.
The music during the conference will be
under tha direction of F. L. Willis, who
has had much to do with the Southern
students' conferences.
Another feature of this year's conference
will be the delegation meetings. At these
meetings the delegates from each college
will meet at the close of the day to gather
up the chief impressions and to apply
mem to the work of the home association-.
The informal meetings which were held
each evening at twilight at Cazadero,
known as hillside meeting?, will be
repeated here.
The ultimate aim of these conventions
is to demonstrate the practical side ol
Christian work among college men, and
to train the undergraduates for the posi
tions of leaders and organizers of Young
Mens Christian Association work in their
respective colleges. For this reason, par
ticular attention will be paid to athletic
exercises of every kind during the con
veution, and pleasure will go hand la
hand with work. There are about filty
delegates here already, and more will
arrive to- morrow.
Between seventy-five and 100 are ex
pected, including men from the city asso
ciation*, as well as from all the colleges.
To-morrow's ptogramme will consist of

LOS ANGELES PRISONERS FOILED.
Abortive Attempt cf Nne Inmates of the
City Jail to Saw Their Way
to Freedom.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 21.â The
officers in the city jail to-day discovered
an abortive attempt of nine prisoners to
escape from confinement. Tne nine have
been condemned to the darkness of the
steel dungeon.
The prisoners concerned were hll serv
ing long terms, some for passing off Con
federate money for genuine currency.
They had been working for several days
on their scheme, which was discovered by
accident, though mys'.e rious sounds had
been heard by the jailer every day since
Tuesday, when the operations were begun.
In a cell was discovered a saw and a
butcher-knife. With these toois. which
had been supplied by a confederate fioru
without, the prisoners had succeeded in
sawing through one bar and partiy
through another. Had the work not been
interrupted, in another day the opening
in the window-grating would have per
mitted a man to go through.
The scheme was to overpower the jailer
at an opportune time, white the lorty
four prisoners were going to their meals,
kill him, if necessary, with the butcher
knife, and escape from the jail through

LOS ANGELES WOMAN'S COUP.
Prevents for a Tme the Erection of a
Trolley Polo Before Her
Residence.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 21.â Mrs.
Mary Walsh of 812 Hill street objected to
day to an electric railway company plant
ing a trolley pole in front of her house.
Her expostulations having no effect on
the workmen Mrs. Walsh outwitted them
in a way peculiar to herself.
She took a chair out of her house, placed
it over tl:e hole the men had dug to re
ceive the pole, and there she sat and de
fied the corporation's hired men to re
move her.
The men tried every method except
force to move her, but she would not
budge. Then the officials of the railway
went out and pleaded with her to pet off
her chair and let, the work go on. But all
had no effect.
She would not have the pole in front of
her bouse, even if she had to sit over that
hole forever.
The aid of the police was invoked, but
the officers could not see any way of rout
ing Mrs. Welsh from her position, and
there she remained until the railway
forces had quit work for tbe day. She re
tired flushed with victory, but in the
morning she will find that trolley pole
standing bravely before her domicile.

Fro feat or Ifcldtn and Bin tiuborctinate
l>i* agree a* to Method*.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 21.â Burnham,
Barnard and now Hussey.
Some day it will be a tradition that Ed
ward S. Holden, the terrible man on the
mount, has caused neariy as many stars
to fall from thÂ«i intellectual zenith of the
Lick Observatory as could be caught in
their downward flight by tiie great tele
scope.
Barnard and Burnham, whose names
were an ornament to the educational
roster of California, have long since given
up the fight against the methods of Pro
fessor Holden, and now it is mainly to in
vestigate the misunderstanding between
holden and Professor E. W. Hussey that
the astronomical committee of the Board
of Regents of ihe University of California
is determined to visit Mount Hamilton to
morrow.
It is at least a peculiar coincidence that
the complaints of all the eminent scien
tists who have been stationed upon the
mountain have been alike in tenor. It
was the complaint of Barnard and it was
the complaint of Burnham that in those
lines of work in which they were ac
knowledged to be peculiarly efficient they
were hampered and retarded.
Those instruments with which they
were fsiui iar were seldom or never at
their disposal, while the instruments to
which they were comparative strangers,
according to the director, were the ones of
which Professor Holden felt an impera
tive need.
The visit of the astronomical committee
promises to be rather a doubtful success
in point of number?. According to Judge
Charles F. Slact.who is on the scene
ready to take an early stage
for Mount Hamilton in the morn
ing, the visit is not the
result of an unpleasantness amonsr the
professors, although he admits that it will
receive some attention from them. He
says that before tuis trouble had arisen
the committee had decided to make an
official visit to the observatory.
Judge black ha* been informed that
Governor liudd, on account of a pressure
of business, will not arrive; Charles F.
Crocker is in the East, and Timottiy Guy
Phelpa could not be found to-night.
Judge Slack is rather inclined to take a
deprecating view of the difficulties.
"The trouble ,Â«eems to be," tie paid,
"thai Professor Hussey understood that
he was to take up the work carried on by
Professor Barnard.
"The latter left the observatory onJanu
ary 1. 1896, and Profe-sor Hu3Â»ey, then of
Stanford, was elected to succeed him.
Professor Hussey expected to be allowed
to work with the lurge telescope and with
the 12-inch instrument along the lines
Professor Barncrl had pursued.
"Instead, he says, he was placed at work
with a reflector, in the handling of which
he lacked experience. He submitted to
Professor Holden's instructions, but he
did so under protest.
"Director Holden's ?tory,as I understand
it. is that nothing hud been done with ttie
Crossley reflector in the way of photograph
ing, and he thought it was time it was
tested. He accordingly asked Hnssey to
take hold of it and see wtiat he couid iio."
Judge Slack says, as far as he knows,
there has been no social friction upon the
mountain, and there has been no formal
complaint lodged with the Board of Re
gents concerning the matter.

LONDON, Eng., May 21.â A large num
ber of officials of the leading railroads,
master car-builders and others, to-day In
spected at Windsor the new royal train of
six carriages, which bus been constructed
at the shops of the Great Western Rail
way at Swindon, and which will be used
for the first time to-morrow for the royal
journey to Balmoral.
The carnages are of the saloon order, of
the finest woods, and the hand decorations
and hangings are of the most magnificent
character. The door of the Queen's per
sonal carriage are so contrived as to allow
of the entrance of two attendants, one on
either side of her Majesty. Theapproaches
to the royal saloon are so constructed as
to be eitctly on a level with a platform,
thus uispensiutj entirely wiih any neces
sity for the me of a footstool or steps.

GOLD PROSPECTORS
ON MARIN`S COAST
San Franciscans Seek
ing for Riches in
the Sands.
Party Headed by the Inventor
of a Novel Amalgamat
ing Machine.
Yellow Flakes and Traces of Quick
silver Found on the Ocean
Beach.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., May 21.â Far
away from thÂ« prying eyes of the public,
at the mou'.n of the great redwood can
yon, a party of three is searching for gold
washed upon the rocky coast of Marin.
E. J. Verrue, Mrs. Verrue and J. D. Gra
ham compose the party, and they are
"roughing it" in order to put an amal
gamating machine invented by Mr. Ver
rue into practical operation. They se
lected the isolated spot where their camp
has been pitched so as to be away from
the world at large while they watched the
workings of the mechanism set up by
Verrue.
The route to the prospectors' abode
leads one over a wild section of country,
where the great fogs from the ocean sweep
in and envelop the hills in a cold embrace
and the winds bowl continually. Bend
ing over a couple of pan 3 when The Call
representative arrived to-day were the two
men, while the woman was preparing din
ner on a stove erected on the Bands.
E. J. Verrue is by no means unknown
to the world of science, and has already
placed a number of inventions on the
market, one of tbem being an instanta
neous water-heater, and another being a
rotary force pump used for ruining par
poses. Verrue said to-day that lie had
come away from the city so as to be iree
io experiment and prospect without an
noyance. He v.'as just washing out a pan
of sand, and aiter a moment'- examina
tion sain tnat it contained a quantity of
quicksilver. Since the party has been at
the Laguna, a 9 the spot where they are
camped is known, the wash'ngs have re
vealed traces of gold and much more
quicksilver.
"My machine," said Verrne, "is differ
ent in some respects from those now in
use. I have never exhibited it id public,
and the only tests I have made with it in
San Francisco have been in my back
yard, where no one lias .seen it. lam not
prepared to explain the principle beyond
that 1 do not use the gravity system used
in other amalgamating machines. I have
had it in successiui operation for about a
moatb, and before I put it before the pub
lic I wi3h to test it practically. 1 intend
to visit other beaches on ifce Marin coast
and will also go to Bolinas Bay.
"The gold here is in tine particles and
is being constantly washed ud by the
ocean. It is found in the dark sand. I
have discovered since 1 have bÂ«en here
that this country is rich in quicksilver and
I rind quantities in every pan I prospect."
Ti.o outdoor life of the party is such as
the early settlers led in the good old days
of gold. It took them two days to make
the journey from Sausalito over the hills
und through the wooded canyons leading
to the ocean. Their teut has been erected
by the side 01. arunuing stream of moun
tain water, and. the incessant ro-ir of the
ocean as the huge breakers roll on the
white sands or crash against the great
cliffs to the north and south is a strange
music.
Tne party intends to remain about two
weeks, but the report that it is searching
for gold ou the shores of the Marin eo.ist
has gone forth, and it is not likely that
the prospectors will be allowed to con
tinue their search alone. Verrue hopes to
rind a spot where the tiny particiesof gold
will be found in sufficient quantities to
justify him in working his new machine
on a large sc;iic, scooping up the dirt by
the use of horses, an.i running it into the
machine in large quantities.

CORNER STONHJF HEALTH
Effect of Paine's Celery Compound
Upon the Blood and Nerves.
Now is the season to Jay the foundation
for futvre health and strength.
The corner stones of good health ere
complete digestion, sound sleep, pure
blood and a perfectly nourished nervous
system.
The wonderful success of Paine's celery
compound in making people well and
keeping them so has always been ac-
counted for by physicians by its extra-
ordinary power of nourishing and regu-
lating all of these functions.
It is not strange that so many unscien-
tific remedies do no permanent good when
they disregard tnis close interdependence
of the nerves and the organs of digestion
and circulation, and attend to but one de-
ranged part at the expense of all the rest.
The only possible way that a real last-
ing gain in strength and vitality can come
is through purer blood, better nourished
nerves and tissues, more refrestiing sleep
and an economy in the expenditure of
nerve force.

SILVER JUBILEE
Twenty-Five Years Ago in
Rome the Pastor Was
Ordained.
Plans for an E aborate Celebra
tion of the Event at St.
Brendan's.
Special Mnsic to Be Rendered by Art
is's of Renown at the Solemn
High Mas?.
Next Tuesday, May 25, the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the ordination of Rev.
John F. Nugent, pastor of bt. Brendan's
Church, corner of Fremont and Harrison
streets, will be celebrated.
The coming event has already awakened
widespread interest.
Father Nugent was ordained in Rome
May 25, 1*72, in the church of St. John
Lateran by the Eminent Cardinal Pairizi.
Bishop Farlev, auxiliary Archbishop of
New York, was ordained at the same irae.

Senator Perkins Takes Up the Case of a
Hebrew Who Has Long Lived in
California.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 2Lâ When
the Senate meets on Monday Senator Per
kins will introduce a resolution which is
calculated to create a big sensation
throughout the United States, especially
among the Hebrew people, and it may
possibly create a controversy between this
country and Russia. Senator Perkins
was called upon a few days ago by a con
stituent who has lived in the Golden State
for forty year?, who informed him that he
wanted to visit his sister in Warsaw,
Russian Poland. He was from Fresno.
The Senator said tnat all that was neces
sary for him to do was to go to the State
I'eparment and procure a pa- sport, which
he could do by making the required affi
davit and paying the usual fee. There
upon his constituent informed Senator
P. rkins that he was a Hebrew.
The Senator then advised him to take
tbe passport to the Russian Minister to
this country and have that official in
dorse it. The gentleman went to the
State Department and procured tbe pass
port as a matter of course. Then he pro
ceeded to the Russian legation and asked
ihf Minister to vise the passport. That
official examined the document, found it
in proper firm, and then inquired:
'Are you a Christian?"
"I am not," was the reply of Senator
Perkins' constituent. "I am a Hebrew. "
"In that case," said the Russian Minis
ter, "i am compelled to inform you that 1
cannot vise the passport. lam forbidden
by my Government to do so.' 1
T;ie Californian then returned to Sen
ator Perkins and informed h m of the re
sult ol his visit to the Russian representa
tive. The Senator was greatly astonished.
He at once procured a coDy of our treaty
with Russia to learn if *.nere was any
authority in that instrument for the ex
clusion from Russia of American citizens
who are Hebrews. He failed to find any
such authority. Then he went over to the
8 ate Department and laid the matter
before assistant Secretary Day, who scared
in Senator Perkins' astonishment and
entered immediately into an investigation
of the matter.
After a brief delay he addressed a note
to the Senator saying that the matter was
as stated by the Senators constituent.
It seems that Russia looks upon tbe
Hebrews as forming a political party re
garded as inimical to the Czar's Govern
ment and that therefore the Hebrews
who owe allegiance to other Governments
than Russie are not permitted to enter the
empire even to visit members of their
own families.
Senator Perkins intends to introduce a
resolution in the Senate to ascertain why
this is so and why this Government per
mits a class of its citizens to be discrim
inated against by a Government with
which the United States is at peace and
with which it is and always has been on
friendly terms. The Senator regards
this ai presenting a vastly more impor
tant matter for the consideration of Con
press a:id of the executive than either the
independence or belligerency of CuDa.
The outcome will be awaited with interest
by every American citizen.

-Hf* Viter Lack of Diplomacy Mrifce*
Ilanna forcibly.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21. â A
pood story is soiiig the rounds here about
"how Michael failed."
This means Michael H. de Younjr. He
was indorsed by all of the Republicans in
Congress (except Loud) for Minister
to Italy, Belgium, Russia, "or something
equally as good." But the appointment
did not materialize. Finally De Young
came East. One day while on Fifteenth
street Senator Mark Ilanna came along,
and seeing the Californian, he said,
'â¢ilello, De Youne."
"Hello, Hanna," said the Californian;
"I am glad to see you, for I want to talk
to you."
They walked up the street together.
D.iys passed and still Mr. de Young's
name did not appear in the list of nomi
nations as Minister to anywhere. He
then delegated George Heazleton to try
and find out how Senator Hanna felt
â¢oward him, and Mr. Heazleton enlisted
the services of an old-time correspondent
whom he had known here years ago when
he was Washington correspondent of the
Chronicle.
The newspaper friend, being intimately
acquainted with Senator Hanna, met him
a tew days later in the marb:e-room of the
Senate, ana incidentally inquired about
De Young ? s chances for a foreign mission.
The newspaper friend of Henzleton asked,
"What do you think of De Young?"
Senator Hanna rep. ied: "I do not like
him very weil. Ido not think much of
him. He tried to bulldoze me down at
the St. Louis convention."
Â«Mr. HannaUld not go into details, but
those wno were at the convention know
that he referred particularly to De Young's
energetic efforts to have the delegates of
his own faction seated in the convention,
and that Hanna resented bis importuni
ties. Mr. Hanna may not have expressed
his displeasure at that time, bnt it seems
tnat he is of the opinion that De Young is
not diplomatic enough in his ways to
make a fitting representative of this coun
try abroad.
COLLISION ON LAKE HURON.
Steamer Florida Sunk by the G. W. Roby
in a Dense Fog â Every Membsr of
the Crew Saved.
CHICAGO, Ilu, May 21.â During a
dense fog the steamer Florida of the Lack
awana line was sunk by collision with the
steamer G.W. Roby on Lake Huron yester
day. The crew of the Florida were taken
to Port Huron.
The captain of the steamer Glidden,
which arrived at the Soo tbis morning,
reports having passed the pilot-house and
other wreckage from the Florida off Middle
Island last evening.
Captain \Villiam Smith of the Roby
states tbat when he first sighted tbe
Florida through the fog he stopped and
backed bis engines, but the two boats
were so close that it was impossible to
avoid a crash. The Roby struck the
Fionda on the starboard side about mid
ships and a hole twelve feet long was cut
in that steamer's wooden side.
It was instantly seen that it was only a
question of minutes before the Florida
would godown. The Roby steamed along
side the doomed boat and took off part of
her crew. The remainder bad instantly
lowered the yawl boat and succeeded ih
getting free of the sinking steamer. They
were picked up subsequ ntlv by the Roby.
Twelve minutes atter the crash the
Florida went to the bottom, sinking stern
rirst, and breaking in two about amid
ships. As she went aown the air impris
oned in tbe hold blew off the cabins and
upper works. This debris is now scattered
over the surface of the lake.
The Roby was bzdly damaged at the
bow, and will go into the drydock at Port
Huron.
The careo of the Florida consisted of
56,000 bushels of wheat and 56 tons of mer
chandise. The loss on the cargo is esti
mated at $60,000.
The Florida belonged to the Killerhouse
syndicate of Buffalo, bnt has been for
many years under cnarter to the L-icka
wana line. Her valuation was $100,000;
injured for $ SO. OOO.
The Roby was bound to Lake Superior
without a cargo. The collision occurred
between Middle Island and Presque Isle.
There is probably not a square mile of the
bottom of the lake in that region without
one or more wrecks caused by collision.
It is the i oint where the great highways
of commerce between Lake Michigan and
Laka Superior converge.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 22, 1897.
COUNTRY SHOTS
GAINED THE DAY
Gala Opening of the State
Live-Bird Tourna
ment.
Gocd Scores Recorded in Spite
of the High Prevailing
Winds.
Hardy Pigeons Were Famished and
an Excellent Day's Sport
Resulted.
The State live-bird tournament which
was begun at ingleside yesterday under
the auspices of the Olympic Gun Club
gave the crack shooters a chance to dis
play their skill and nerve.
Shooters from Los Angeles, San Diego,
Stockton, Sacramento, Monterey and San
Francisco contended for the honors, and
it was acknowledged last nipht that gun
ners from the interior gained the laurels.
The attendance of shooters and spectators
was large for the opening day. The wind
blew across tne traps with considerable
force, nance the birds were hard to hit.
Owing to the high wind a dead bird oc
casionally fell outside the limit. The
traps worked well all day, and not a hitch
occurred. The shooting started at 9A. M..
and at 3:30 p. m. the day's programme was
concluded. Ttie birds were strong, hardy
and swift flyers.
David Winders of Stockton made tbe
best individual score. He shot through
the first three events without losing a
bird and used the second barrel only
twice.
Martinez Chick of Los Angeles made
the second test record.
In the first two events Otto Feudner,
the local champion, was not in good form,
and consequently failed to justify the ex
pectations of his many admirers. Frank
Maskey did some clever shooting and ra*
ceived many compliments.
Frank Merrill, a young man of Stock
ton, displayed remarkable skill and cool
ness. He made one mistake, however,
which caused him to lose $20. He goi
eleven birds straight and the twelfth bird
was trapped without the word coming
from him. He could have neglected it,
but he judged it an easy comer and elected
to shoot. The bird proved to be a remark
ably swift in-comer, and the first barrel
missed him. On tbe second barrel the
bird fell just ou side the limit.
The events to-day are:
First eventâ Six birds; entrance $2 50,810
added; high gurrn to win.
Second eventâ Gold Dust medal race; 20
birds; entrance $3. dinner will receive
medal which entitles him on surrender
thereof to entrance-money in the next shoot.
In this race the club will give to the second
hieh gun if 15 and to third high gun $10.
Tnird event â Se'iby race; 10 birda; entrance
$5, $25 added by the Selby Smelting and Lead
Company. Three moneys, class shooting.
liose system.
The Gold Dust medal is now held by J.
S. Far. n ing.
The Fay diamond medal will bo com
peted for to-morrow. The present holder
is Oito Feudner.
At the tournament yesterday Merton
Allen was official scorer, William Mar
dock was trapper and Mr. Judd releree.
Trie shooting in this tournament is
under American Shooting Association
rules, with the additional provision that
if a shooter discharge both barrels at once
the referee shall order another bird,
whether the bird shot at be killed or lost.
The club does not permit the promiscuous
shooting of lost birds. If a bird escapes
the fire of the marksman his liberty is
guaranteed as haying been fairly earned.
The assurance is given that if perfect
grounds, good birds, hard work and nn
attractive programme count for anything,
this tournament will bs the most notable
event of the kind ever held in California.
All that is asked of the shooting fraternity
is the encouragement of tbmr presence.
The chief place of resort for the visiting
sportsmen s the clubhouse of the Oiym-
Die Gun Club, 1309 Van Ness avenue.
Many shooters were entertained there last
evening by Captain Len D. Owens.
The indications are that the number of
shooters and the throng of spectators will
be largely increased to-day.

Sought Her Mother, Whom She Told
She Was Not Bally I jure*
and Then Fainted.
Helen Pendis, a pretty miss of 12
yearns who resides with her widowed
mother at 1115 Sutter street, miiaculously
escaped death in her home yesterday
afternoon.
The little girl fell a distance of over
twenty feet, and escaped with a fracture
of her arm and a few cuts and bruises
about her limbs and body.
The injured girl was playing in an attic
over the third floor oi her home when
the acciaent which so nearly cost her her
life occurred.
She slipped upon a thin glass which
covered a small skylight It crashed into
atoms under her weight and ahe shot
down through tnÂ« opening to a staircase
a story bÂ«low, and then rolled down the
ih :ht to the second floor below.
Sue slowly regained her feet and walked
down the stairs to the first floor of the
building in search of her mother.
When the injured child entered the
room in which her mother if as she hur
ried toward her and stammered, "Mother,
I am not hurt very mncn," and then
fainted in her mother's arms.
Mrs. Pendis was much alarmed when
ber daughter fainted as she was unaware
that an accident had occurred.
Little Helen recovered shortly, however,
and told of her startling plunge through
the skylight.
Dr. Adl<Â»r was summoned, and after an
examination he found the child was suf
fering from a fracture of the right arm
and several cuts and contusions.
The physician dressed tue wounds and
strt the broken arm, after which the little
eirl was put to bed and made as comfort
able as a motoer's care could make her.

HOW OLD AEE YOU?
Anybody Can Ascertain Another's Age
. ;. by. This Method.
One day there came to the court of a
king a gray-haired professor, who amused
the kine greatly. He told the monarch a
number of thine s that he never. knew be
fore, and the king was delighted. But
finally it came to the point when the ruler
wanted to know the ag; of the professor,
so he thought of a mathematical problera.
"Ahem," said the king. "I have an inÂ«
teresting sum for you; it is a trial in men
tal arithmetic. Think of the number of
the month of your birth."
Now the professor was 60 years old and
bad been born two days before Christmas;
so he thoueht of twelve, December beine
the twelfth month. : . ;
"Yes,'' faid the professor. , ; -.
"Multiply it by two," continued the
king. â -'â : â â â â â â ;. ; , " 'â¢â¢;." -,
"Yes."
"Add five."
" "Yes," answered the professor, doing so.
"Now multiply that by fifty." "Yes."
"Add your ace." "Yes."
'.'Subtract 365." "Yes." . . ,;
"Add 115." "Yei."
"And now," said the King, "might lask
what the result is?" *
"Twelve hundred and sixty," replied
the professor, wondering]*.
"ThanK you," was the King's response.
"So you - were born in December, sixty
years ago, eh?" . /. ,
"Why. how in the world do you know?"
cried the professor. â¢
"Why," retorted the King, "from your
answerâ The month of > your birth
was the twelfth and the last two figures
gave your age." v .
"Ha, ha, ha," laughed the professor. !
"Capital idea. I'll try ie on the next per
son. It's a polite way of i finding out peo
ple's ages."â Brooklyn Eagle. ;
NOT MANY PEIVILEGES.
Some of tbe Disadvantages of Being a
Queen.
The Queen is not allowed a great many
privileges that the humblest of her sub
jects can boast, says the London Tid Bits.
For instance she is denied the pleasure of
handling a newspaper of any kind. She
does not read a letter from au7 person ex
cept from her own family, and no member
of the royal family or household considers
it etiqnette to speak to her of any piece of
news in any publication.
All tho information the Queen is per
mitted to nave must first be strained
through tbe intellect of a man whose
business it is to cut out from the papers
each day what he thinks she would like
to know. These scraps he fastens on a
silk sheet with a gold fringe all about it
and presents it to Her Majesty. This
silken sheet with gold fringe is imperative
for ail communications to the Queen.
The deprivation* of tbe Queen's life arc
illustrated by an incident which occurred
not long ago.
An American lady sent her Majesty an
immense collection of flowers of the
United States, pressed and mounted. The
Queen was delighted with the collection
and Kept it lor three months, turning over
the leaves frequently with great delight.
At the end of that time, which was as
Jong as she was allowed by etiquette to
keep it, she bad it pent back with a letter
saying that, being Queen of Great Britain
she was not allowed to have any gifts, and
that she parted with it with deep regret.
A Satisfactory Proof.
In County Sligo, among tbe hills, there
is a small lake renowned in that rezoin
for its fabulous depth. A professor hap
pened to be in that part of Ireland last
summer and started out one fine day for a
ramble among tbe mountains, accompa
nied by a native guide. As they climbed
Pat asked him if he would like to see this
lake, "for it's no bottom at all, sorr."
"But how do you know that, Pat?"
asked the professor.
"Well, sorr, I'll tell ye; me own causin
was showin* tbe pond to a gentleman one
day, sorr, and he looked Increduious-like,
just a* you do, and me cousin couldn't
stand itfor him to doubt bis word, sorr,
and so he eaid, 'Begorra, I'll prove ttie
truth of me worrds,' and off with his
clothes and in he jumped."
Tbe professor's face wore an amused
and qu zzical expression.
"YeÂ«, sorr, in" he jumped, and didn't
come up again at all."
"Bui," said the professor, "I don't see
that your cousin proved his point by
recklessly drowning himself."
"Sure, sorr, it wasn't drowned at all he
was; the next day comes a cable from
him in Australia, ask.n' to send on his
clothes."â Tit-Bits.
â¢'Babies Checked Here!"
A carious feature of a large relief works
camr> in the Punjab, sa.vs i he Allahabad
Pioneer Mail, where about 40,000 persons
are at work, is the arrangement just in
troduced by which a large number of
babies are looked after while their mot tiers
are at work.
Previous to this 700 or 800 babies of all
sorts were left in one place and the
mothers, anxious in the evening to re
claim their little one?, presemed a ccene
which is better imagined than described.
It was not possible even for mothers to
find their own babies easily, and the au
| THK EMFORIUM
thorities were embarrassed not a little.
The officer in charge, however, has treated
the babies on the umbrella ana coat prin
ciple. He nas provided each of trie bab >"
with a string and a ticket in d up!' .\tÂ»,
one being hung round the baby's ueck
and the other given to the mother.
A German Artifice.
A correspondent, writing from a Ger
man city, warns American manufacturers
not to be too liberal in sending samples
and descriptions of their goods to un
known parties in Europe. While, he says,
there is in Germany a 3tiong prejudice
against American meat.*, everytnin;; else
American, especially industrial products,
seem to have the preference over do
mestic goods. It is therefore hardly
surprisiug that the German manu
facturers should write to the American
manufacturer-! for a "lull line ot sam
ples," descriptive catalogues and other de
tails, opening out the prosp. ct of a good
business, ana representing themselves as
dealers in the >;oods. The real object of
tiiese negotiations, however, is but too
frequently to obtain the samples f om first
hands for the purpose of imitation. Such
a thing could not be done in Germany
itself. Under its Jaw "against unfair com
petition," penalties of tine and imprison
ment are tbe consequences of fraudulent
advertisements, of attempts to brine work
men in factories to betray the secrets of
their employers, cf inducements offered
to salesmen or other employes of competi
tors lor trie purpose of obtaining Informa
tion about their business, and other simi
lar unprincipled commercial subterfuges.
Punishing Shopkeepers.
France kDows how to protect the rights
of her people. Anybody who doubts the
genuineness of an article of food that he
has purchased from a Parisian tradesman
may take it to the municipal laboratory
for analysis. It will cost him nothing to
have it analyzed nni the fact determinea
i whether it is unadulterated or adulterated;
and if the latter, the law deals with the
offender without further action on the
part of the purchaser. The shopkeeper is
liable to be heavily fined and imprisoned,
and has to display conspicuously in his
â¢hopwindow or on his door for a year a
large placard bearing the words, "Con
victed t/f Adulteration."

The surveying parties in Tejon Pass

are laid.
Weary of waiting for the State or Con
gress to do something for the improve
ment of Alviso harbor the people of Santa
Clara County are talking of undertaking
the beginning of the work themselves,
and on the old principle that self-help is

way of getting the thing done. Moreover,
Coneress will probably be inclined to help
thÂ«-se who help themselves, just to show
that it has some divinity in it.
Thursday was i field day for Cuba in
Congress. The Senate passed the Morgan
resolutions and the House passed the bill
providing for the relief of Americans who
are destitute on the island. These things
were good, but better still was the decla
ration of Coneressman Hiti: "I have
reason to believe the President is taking
as active and as effective steps as he can to
secure the independence of Cuba, and that
fact I am convinced has reached Spanish
headquarters. 1 '
PEACE WITH INDEPENDENCE.
The developments in the Cuban situation on Thursday were so favorable to the
independence of the island as to give reasons for the most sanguine expectations of
its BDeedy attainment. The vote in the Senate in favor of the Morgan resolution was
carried by a majority so large as to preclude any doubt that it represnts the senti
ments of the American people, while the debate in the House on Bailey's motion
clearly points to the conclusion that Congressman Hittdehned the policy of the ad
ministration when he said, "The purpose of the Republicans is to secure peace with
independence."
The reports published on "Wednesday of the ppeech made in Madrid by Sagasta,
who virtually declared the Spanish Government would no longer receive the support
of the opposition party in continuing the war, adds to the effect produced by the pro
ceedings in congress. It made clear the fact that the Spanish people, or at least a
large and influential portion of t: em, are no longer willing to pay taxes to continue
a wasteful and useless stiugele. It has been learned at Madrid, as well as at Wash
ington, that the conquest of Cuba is impoÂ«sible to Spain, and the wiser element of the
Spanish people is opposed to a further waste of blood and treasure for tne mere sake
of gratifying pride or a spirit of revenge.
Tne opposition to the war in Spain is not a mere political movement. V A consid
erable number of wealthy Spaniards own property in Cuba and have been well nigh
ruined by the war. They prefer peace and prosperity, with Cuban independence,
rather than to incur further losses in the forlorn hope of crushing the patriots. In
addition to these there is a considerable number of merchants who have large busi
ness connections with Cuba and they also desire a return of peace in order have a
return of their former profits. The business sentiment! of the country are, therefore,
on the side of the conservative taxpayers, and the two together constitute a force
which will go far towerd inclining the Spanish Government to accede to any reasona
ble terms for the evacuation of the island and the recognition of its independence.
Congressman Hitt, who, it is well known, will be chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations when the House committees are appoiuteu, and who, therefore, is
a recognized authority, stated in the House he had reason to believe the President is
taking active and effective steps to secure the indeDendence of Cuba. He added:
'Tuat fact lam convinced has reached Spanish headquarter?, for the news reaches
us to-day that the Spanish Minister who will probably be in power in about thirty
days has said the Cuban war is mterly hopeless."
This statement ought to put at rest any doubts which may have existed concern
ing the attitude of the administration toward Cuba. Pjacu oan be brought about
much more speedily by the exercise of tact on the part of our Government than it
could by any hasty or inconsiderate action. We can safely trust to the President to
carry oat the wishes of the people in this regard, and may reasonably hope to see the
speedy accomplishment of "peace with independence."
GOOD WORK WELL DONE.
The report of the directors of the Mer
chants' Association, submitted at the ttiird
annual meeting, was one of tlie most er.
couraging documents which has been read
to a San Francisco audience for mnny a
year. It was eloquent in the concise
statement of things done. It cheered the
luture by narrating the accomplishments
of the past, and gave assurance of con
tinued usefulness by the record of present
services.
The increase in membership of the as
sociation is in itself a striking illustration
of the va-lue of the oigan:zation and a
proof that when any body of men really
achieve much for public benefit it will noi
lack for support, but will draw into its
membership many progressive citizens
who hesitated to join at first. The asso
ciation began its career three years ago
with but 47 members; two years a<;o
the roll numbered 406; to-day 867 busi
ness firms are enrolled as regular mem
bers. Every industry in the City is repre
sented, and the strength of the organiza
tion is now sufficiently great to enter upon
undertakings which, in the beginning, it
would have regarded as almost beyond Us
power to accomplish.
The record of what has been done for
the municipality daring the three years of
the life of the association is one of which
it may be justly proud. It has not at
tained ail that it aimed nt, but it ha- done
much. The streets and sidewalks have
been made cleaner, the pavements better,
street sprinkling has been improved, the
cobbles which have long disfigured many
of the principal streets are disappearing,
the aavantaÂ«e-i of better lighting along
the business thoroughfares have been
demonstrated by experiments voluntarily
borne by merchants and in many other
ways the energies of the association have
achieved results which tend greatly to
improve the business comfort and the
liealth of the community.
All that has been acnioved so far is re
garded by the association as but the
earnest of things yet to oe done. The re
port clearly sets forth a determination not
only to continue the efforts for better
street pavements, street cleaning and
street lighting, but to undertake other
tasks not ie-s important. Among these
pointed out in the report are the improve
ment of the drainage system, the adoptioa
of a more liberal policy in the construc
tion of street pavements, thn establish
ment of a more economical system of
municipal government and the advance
ment of the movementfor obtaining a new
charter. All of these undertakings so di
rectly concern the welfare of every citizen
that all may be rightly counted on to co
operate with toe association in carrying
them to a successful conclusion.
San Francisco is to bÂ« congratulated on
having such a body of men among her
citizens. The work done by the Mer
chants' Association is a sufficient proof
that we are not lacking In civic patriotism,
and that we have citizens among us who
are capable not only of outlining a pro
gressive policy, but of conducting it with
ability and efficiency. With such a record
the association can rightly appeal to the
public generally for support in all work
that it undertakes hereafter, and every
citizen ought to feel that he will honor
himself by becoming a member of the as
sociation or allying himself with it as a
supporter of its enterprise.
THE WESTEBN GONGEEBS
The Tram-Mississippi Congress which is
to convene in Salt Lake City on July 14
will afford California an opportunity to
take her riehtfui position as tne leader of
the great West These congresses in the
past have not been so beneficial to us as
they should have been. The chief result
accomplished by them has been the im
provement of the harbor at Galveston,
and while that is something which libh
well repaid tha trouble of asserting West
ern sentiment it is tima to direct the at
tention of Congress to needs further West
than the ssacoast of Tsxas.
California at this time has several pro
jects to advance for the welfare, not of
nor peoDle only, but of the whole country.
Among these are the establishment of a
National department of mines and min
ing, the promotion of the enactment of a
National pure-food law, the opening of
facilities for trade with Mexico and South
America, the improvement of arid lands
ana legislation which will prevent the use
of convict-made toods in competition
with manufacturers employing free labor.
None of these things are in any sense
local. Borne of them affect the whole
Union and all of them concern every
btate in the West. They can be called
Californian only because this State has
taken the lead in the movement to obtain
them and because by reason of its greater
wealth and larger population it has more
power than any other Western State to
support them in Congress.
To achieve any good work at the pro
posed gathering in Salt Lake City for any
of these movements it will be necessary
for us to send there a delegation of men
who can not only talk earnestly and con
vincingly, but can also act with vigor and
effect combinations and organizations
which will be strong enough to exert an
; TPIE ;- SAN FRANCISCO : C LL \ S*T TTT? T^Y. :> MAY 00, 18 7 v
influence at Washington. Such a delega
tion cannot bs gathered at haphazard.
The selection of the men who are to rep
resent us must be made with careful con
sideration, and it is time we were de
voting some attention to the subject.
ALVISO HARBOR.
The action of Governor Budd in vetoing
the appropriation made by the Legisla
ture for the improvement of Alviso har
bor so far from dampening t c ardor of
the people cf Santa Clara County in that
enterprise has liad the effect of stimu
lating their energies and rousing them to
new effort. As was announced in The
Call yesterday the Board of Trade of San
Jcse is working energetically on the pro
ject and it is probable that within the
next two months Rome definite plan of
act on will be adopted and important
steps taKen to curry it out.
For more than eight years now the
people of Santa Clara County have been
directing a large part of their progressive
energy toward the accomplishment of im
provements at Alviso which would make
that port a commodious harbor for ship
ping. As was natural they -ought first to
obtain an appropriation for the work from
the General Government, for It comes
rightly within the scope of river and har
bor improvements. While, however,
something was eained in that way by the
persistent efforts of Congressman Loud
not enough was done to keep up to the in
creasing requirements of the expanding
trade of 'he port. Efforts were therefore
made to get assistance from the State.
These also were baffled by reason of the
Governor's veto. The county is now con
yidering thn advisability of undertaking
the preliminary work of improvement at
her own expense, on the principle that
self-help is the best help.
The moat casual study of a map of Cali
fornia will show the value that a
good harbor at Alviso would be to the
State. It would open up deep-water com
munication with one of the largest and
most extensive of our valleys and provide
transportation facilities for an industrious
population, whose numbers and whose in
dustries are rapidly advancing. The
amount of business done at the port, even
under present adverse conditions, is large,
and there can be no question it would in
crease rapidly ns soon as proper facilities
were provided for it
Th-re are no serious difficulties in
volved in the problems ot the proposed
improvement. Nothing is to be done ex
cept the removal of soil washed down by
the streams, which nas filled up the
southern end of the bay and formed the
extensive marshes along its borders. By
dredging out the desirt d channel it would
De possible at the same tims to furnish
:he material for embankments, which
would reclaim a considerable district of
tba surrounding country, and thus render
useful some ot the richest lands in the
State.
All the advantages to flow from the pro
posed enterprise are well understood by
the progressive people of Santa Clara, and
it is not surprising they have determined
to pvit their own hands to the plow and to
do some work for themselves while wait
ing for the fulfillment of their rightful ex
pectations of assistance from the General
Government. The San Jose Board of
Trade, which is directing the movement,'
is in the hands of able and energetic men,
and there is every prospect that with the
cordial co-operation of the people of tbe
county they will devise a means of begin
ning the work and carry it so far that
there will ba no longer any hesitation on
the part of Congress to grant the appro
priation, which should long ago have been
made.

Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest
President Jcrdan and the State.
Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: In the remarks of President Jordan of the Stanford
Univeraiiy before the Pure Food Congress, as reported in the newspapers, there is much food
for pure thought. Indeed, he is a thought-provoking teacher. And yet he is a reactionary
thinker on the greatest problem which confronts civilization at the end of the nineteenth cen
tury after Christ. "Every working citizen," says Governor Adams of Colorado, "is a valuabl "
asset in the inventory of a State's wealtn: every unemployed workman is a liability." 1 Ilk J
that thought But President Jordan says: "The enterprise of rinding work is what makes
men." Men in quest of work earn no bread ; they are a liability.
President Jordan affirms that it is the duty of the State to punish by fines and imprison,
men t the miscreants who adulterate ana poison our food to the end that we may have pure
food for sale, and in this he is right. But adulteration, as we all know, is the result of our
fierce competitionâ the awful struggle of the day to do business at a profit We all know, too,
that this competition rules all branches of production is well as trade, and, aided by ma
chinery, it hns thrown men out of work in vas; numbers. What shall these men and their
families do? Work is not to be fonnd for them. Shall the State step in and force competition
to keep the food pure while it lets the men beg for it or starve?
"It is not a wise charity to fir-d work for the unemployed." says President Jordan. The
fnnction or duty of the State is to punish offenders neaiust society by fines and imprisonment
and stop there, as I nnderstand President Jojdan. This is a very old view of the duty of the
State, a limitation of Its function which was repudiated by Aristotle, when he said, "It is the
doty of the State to reach every worthy end." The Jordan view of the State limirs it to the law,
the policeman, the Judge and the jail. If this be the true view, we must abolish the public
schools, the State University, the State and all public libraries, all our asylums, also, and
leave only our State's prisons and our jails. This is a fair deduction from his definition of the
duty of the Sute, and I tnink It does him no injustice, for he is a logical thinker and I am
snre I can show that he is consistent, too. But there is more in what lam about to say than
the average reader is prepared to believe.
How many readers of TnE Call have thought much, or evÂ«n taised the question, as to why
Mr. Stanford founded a rival university to that of the State, located in Berkeley, only a few
wiles away irom Palo Alto ? Why did he not munificently endow the State's great schoolâ
the people's universitv-r-already founded for ihe education of the aspiring sons nnd daughters
of the common people? And why did Mr. Rockefeller endow the Chicago University so munifi
cently instead of tne Illinois State University? If the reader will think a bit over these ques
tions they will not seem querulous or irrelevant. I am trying to go to the bo 1 lorn of this mat
ter, and I am writing for the "average reader," who seldom thinks of these things, and forced
brevity may obscure where amplification ana details would make all clear.
Few seem to know that a deep and subtle theory is at work in society as to the function or
duty of the Slate, and the influence of that theory is already far-reaching and much more dis
astrous to tne liberties of the common people than the average reader has ever learned to sus
pect. I have only room in this brief "letter" to make a single; suggestion, and to s*v that step
by step lam coming to the doty of the State with reference to the unemployed. My sugges
tion is this: Our State University is the natural and logical outgrowth of our system of gov
ernment; it is, in fact, a distinctively American institution, and is justly the pride and glory
i of the common people. It is for that very reason a thorn in the side of our new aristocracy,
' but its wholesome American influence is checked and almost entirely perverted in some
i States by the appointment of wealthy aristocratic regents who select teacnÂ«>rs and professors
who will inculcaie the "conservative" ideas of there regents. Our Stanford University, on the
other hand, is just as distinctively alien to our form of government, ana its influence.lf I may
judge it by the teachingof its president, is not in any true cen^e â certainly not in tne Abraham
Lincoln Benseâ an American influence. But I must abruptly close here.

An Advocate of the Franchise for Women.
To the Editor of the San Pranci*ca Callâ Sir: In your issue of this morning giving some ac
! count of the proceedings of the Episcopal Convention on Thursday, your reporter has fallen
| into an error in regard to the personality of the speaker who addressed the convention in be
half of the propriety of admitting the women of the Episcopal church to tne right of franchise
in voting for a vestry. The remarks which were made upon that subject, and which con
tributed io the large and decisive vote favorable to â woman suffrage in the church, which were
attributed to the Rev. J. B. Wakefield, D.D.. of San Jose, were made by the Rev. L Delos Mans
field, late rector of ChriÂ«t Church, Mission of San Jose; and whatever responsibility attaches
to the advocacy of the equal rights of the women of the church with the men in the choice of
its officers must be given to Mr. Man^fleid and not to Dr. Wakefleid. The error In names was
not, perhaps unnatural, as they closely res^mbe each other'and both gentlemen are of nearly
tho same age, and both from San Jose. But Dr. Wakefield's views on the subject are not known
and could not have been expressed on Thursday .iiorning, as lie was not nresent in the conven
tion at the time of the discussiou of the question, but had been summoned to San Jose to at
tend the funeral of one of his parishioners. Will The Call please publish tnis correction ia
justice tn both gentlemen named and In the interest of historical accuracy?

If a couple are so romantic that they desire â  â¢

nothing to prevent them from so doing, but
there is a good deal of doubt as to the legality
of such a marriage if performed by the master
of a vessel. In this State a marriage license
issued in any county is not valid oatslde of the
County lliniia, therefore If a couple obtained a
license in San Francisco, then took a minister
with them and went in a vessel outside of the
three-mile limit the license obtained would
have as much value as a piece of blank paper
Marriage is a serious tning, and those wno
â¢want to marry should do so within the law.

should be removed for the jubilee thanksgiv

sanction the proposal. "I am unwilling to

said to have remarked. "If I permit it some
one may consider it a justification for re
moving my statue some day on a similar oc

FOOD COFFEE.
BE PAIE
With the Only Body Yon Huve.
People dislike to look unpleasant facts
in the face, and yet we must do this in
order to avoid the habiti which the body
shows are killing. A man or woman may
hare warning, from stomach, nerves or
liver trouble, that cofTee-drinfcing is stead-
ily undermining their conÂ«titution, the
illnesi day after day showinn absolutely
that there is some serious disturbance,
and their common sense tells them that it
gets worse instead of better.
They know coffee is the cause, but try
ami deceive themselves with assurance
that it is some temporary disorder of the
Btomach and will e<> away of itself. 80
the drug (coflep) is swallowed oach day
and the dismal war j?oes on. It would
teem the part of common sense to look
it atters squarely in the face and make a
CUtfoi health aiid liberty iroai bodily dis-
tress. Anyone esteems health to be of
more value than money or property, so
why not make a little 'n'elligent effort to
gain and keep it? Drop the coffee and

the pure grains of the field, intended by

SHE WAS PLACED

A Suspected Case of Small
p:x on the Steamer
Belgic.
It Turned Out to B3 Measles,
However, so the Embargo
Was Raised.
Captain Jihn L?e Nearly Asphyxiated
in the Windsor Hotel Last
Thursday Night.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Belgic has been playing in
hard luck of late. Several months ago
she broke her thrust-shaft and had to lay
up at Hong Kong for repairs. AY lien she
arrived in port yesterday morning a case
of measles was discovered, and as a small
pox case had been landed at Kobe, in
Japan, Dr. Blue ordered her into quaran
tine. She was followed to the An^el
Island station by tbe United States quar
antine boat Sternberg, the State quaran
tine boat Governor Perkins, the revenue
cutter llartlev and the Mail Company's
tug Milien Griffins. The facts of the case
were submitted to Dr. Rosenau by Dr.
Biue, and then both gentlemen made an
examination of the case. Dr. Chalmers
also mode a careful study of the case, and
it was finally decided to release the vessel.
Before this, however, the mail had been
landed, and about 4 p. m. the cabin passen
gers weie brought ashore on the Milieu
Gr.llihs. An hour later the steamer was
ailoweu to dock. The cabin passengers
were:
U. Ammann, Dr. and Mrs. S. Asano, Dr. and

Two days before the vessel left the port
of Hongkong a tire was discovered on
board, but it was prevented from
spreading and finally put out. Nothing
was lost except some baggage and a quan
tity of matting. The Hongkong h'reboat
was sent out and rendered material as- j
sistance in subduing the flames. Wiiiie â

A private letter from Unalaska snys
thnt both the whalers Balena and Belve- |
dere were caught in the storm that ;
wrecked the General Siglin and Samaria. :
"Captain Williams is again in command
of the Baiena," says the letter, and
thereby hangs a tale. Last yenr when
the whalers wintered in the Arctic there
was trouble on the Balena and when the
latter ar:ived in San the cab:n
boy swore out a warrant for the arrest of ;
the skipper. The latter could not be ;
found and the Balena went to sea in com- |
mand of Captain A. T. Simmons. Out- !
side the heads Williams boaried her in a j
Whitehall and took command. Simmons '
is now chief officer. Tlie Balena will i
winter in the Arctic.
During the storm the Bulena lost a '
number of sails, had part of her railing !
I carried away nrci lost some of her boats.
The Belvedere had three ol her boats i
i carried away, lost all her headgear and j
was otherwise damaged. Both whalers j
put Into Unalaska fur repairs.

and .-hows the Knockout blow in the Cor- j
bett-Fitzsimmons fight to perfection, to j
which fnct Marine SuperintendentTabrett \
of the Kisdon Iron Works will bear wit- !
ness.
Tabrett was curious nnd wanted to ex- j
amine the machine. 'Keep it a short dis- j
tance away from your eye, and when you j
get the right focus press the button," said
Little, as innocently as possible. Tabrett
pressed t lie button, and the next instant a
hand sprang out of the box nnd strtici;
him in tbe eye. It was a knock-out blow
and no mistake, as the well-known en
gineer has one of his optics in mournina !
as evidence. Little Is still lausj ing over j
the joke, and Tabrettâ well, he has got j
over his chasrnn and is laughiVig himself.
Captain John Lee, late of the G. D.
Bryant and formerly of the bark Colusa, ;
came near to ending his life last Thurs- .
day night. He had been out spending the i
eveninn at the theater with a friend, and |
having missed the last boat went to tae
Windsor Hotel and engaged a room.
After turning off the gas he turned it on
again, and was almost dead when dis
covered. After working over him for
some time, the doctors pronounced him
out of danger, and he was taken home.
While in command of one of the sugar j
fleet some years ago Captain Lee got into
trouble with the Hawaiian authorities
over th<> opium quejtion and on the arrival j
of the Bryant here from Sydney last year
he had considerable trouble with his crew.

TWO BROKEN WRISTS.
While Drunk, a Hostler Fell From
the Sccoml Storj- of the
Adelphia Houie.
Lonis Bertos, 32 years of age, and until
two weeks ago a hostler near the Pre
sidio, was picked up yesteruay morning
at 3:30 o'clock on the sidewalk in front of
the Adolpbia Housa at Pacific and Kearny
streets.
Both wrists were broken, his face was
bleeding and he suffer, d from internal
injuries.
At the Receiving Hospital he could not
explain how he received his injuries any
further than saying he fell from tbe
building.
The man was seen around the upper
floor of the Adelphia Hour, and it is
presumed he fell out of an open window
on the second story.
He was removed to the City and County
Hospital.

Mrs. Sophie McGuire and Mr. Johanna
Gunn both live at 134 Twenty-nin:h street,
tlit- back yard of wnicu it divided by alow
fence, that each might know exactly how
much of the territory its her own.
Mrs. McGuire, however, objected to Mrs.
Gunn peering over the fence and watering
her doings, so she began building ttie
fence higher, when Mrs. Gunn caught her
in the act and ordered tier to desist.
A wordy war broke out, terminating in
Mrs. McGuire being bit over the head
with a billet of woo i. She wns treated at
the Receiving Hospital, after which she
swore oul a warrant lor her neighbor's
arrest.

FABIOLA DAY
AT EMERYVILLE
The Close of Horse-Racing
Here Until Next
October.
Fashion and Society Will
Grace the Sport This
Afternoon.
An Attractive Programme Furnished.
Hard Times Exists Among Many
Ownersâ Other G ssip.
Fabiola Hospital of Oakland will be the
recipient of a benefit at Emeryville race
course to-day, and the elite of society in
the cry across the bay are expected to till
the big grand stand, as great efforts have
been extended to make the affair a big
success. The card is an attractive one,
with the Fabiola Derby, over one and a
quarter miles, as the special feature.
It ia pleasant to read of the performance
of a mighty racer and the thousands de
ducted from the bookmakers' bankrolls by
the fortunate owner, but the rath of all
horsemen is not strewn with roses.
An owner over from Emeryville track
yesterday morning said attachments were
flying around thicker than mosquitoes in
New Jersey, and that the Sheriff's lock
was quite a fashionable decoration nowa
days. But, said he, the boys have got a
way o! fooling 'em, referring to the depu
ties. Of course the latter are always in
structed to snap the lock on the stall of
the best horses In the string. Possibly ex
pecting trouble tlie astuteCtrainer shifts
his horses about, and while the fcxy
deputy is smiling, with the bird sifely in
the cage, the trainer moves the good
horses away, leaving the forlorn "crab" as
payment for the bill.
"handy" Smith, toe well-known reSns
man, will probably have a "try" for some
of the purges hung up this season over
the California circuit. Sandy was second
for Charles Marvin when the latter veteran
handled the Palo Alto record-breakers,
and is a very capable man with the rib
bons.
San Diraas, which died recently in the
East, was considered the crack of the
Burns & Waterhonse string. The colt had
fhown very fast before leaving her?, and
great things were expected of him in ihe
Eastern country. The Brutus- Mistletoe
ia the same Rtable is also said to be a very
speedy youngster.
It is not generally known that Willie
Martin and Pat Dunne came very close to
severing the friendship existing between
the jockey and owner one day at Ingle
Â«ide. On the occasion, near the close of
the meeting, that Rey del Tierra, owned
by Ed Purser, finished in front of Dunne's
t.orse, Cabriilo, Willie, who rode the lat
ter, was very wratuy and bid the latter
up $500 over his entered selling price.
Owner Dunne handed his portion of the
run-up money back to Purser and turn
ing to the jockey told him that if be ever
repeated the trick while riding one of his
horses they would cease to be friends.
Glover, who rode Masoero some days
ago and was suspended for the poor show
ing made in the race, is looking for rein
statement. Considering the fact that 'he
horse is a very erratic performer and that
Glover is no cracka-jack the boy is en
titled to another trial.
â¢ ! Pop" Weaver, who left for Denver
about a fortnight ago with Cabriilo, Char
lemagne and Tulare, writes a friend here
that the latter getding came very near
dying on the way, but is now taking
gallops.
Joe Plpgott leaves for Chicago next
week to till his engagement with tho Cor
rigan stable.
After Lucretia Borgia with the "catch"
on ncr back had lowered the lour-mile
rfcord on Thursday Owner Boots said
that he might agair. start the chestnut
mare in the fall with her entitled weght,
105 pounds, up in the saddle. Her per
lormance was a good exhibition of sturdi
ness but by no means bordering on the
wonderful or marvelous.
Many bettors at Emeryville on Thurs
day who bet on Billy McCloskey suffer
under the delusion, so rumor has it, that
Claws-'on vat going to "place" Collins,
which horse receded very steadily in the
bettng. If the youngster ever did agree
to do t lie feat he must have lorgotten his
instructions, for he put up a very vigorous
finish attne end.
The critics are inclined to blame the de
feat of Ornament in the Kentucky Derby
captured by Typhoon II to the see-saw
ride furnished by Clayton.
Theattendance'during the recent Nash
ville meeting was small and the meeting
was a lailure financially.
Handspring recently went a mile and a
quarter in 2:18, and as the big colt's heels
don't teem to hurt him will receive a
Brooklyn handicap "prep."
"Curley" Brown is said to have made a
bin hit by his excellent starting at the
YEW TO-DAY.
Grocers, who will give
your money back (without
grumbling) if you don't like
Schilling 's Best tea, are
helping us.
It is good business for
all concerned.
A Schilling & Company
Sao Francisco 496
Queen City race meeting. "OicK" Brown,
a Mother of me Eastern starter, at pres
ent in this City, will make an effort to
secure the starting on the coming Cali
fornia circuit. Dick wielded the flag some
two years back on some of tne interior
tracks, and, as a rule, gave good satisfac
tion.

NEED NOT BE INSPECTED.
Supervisors Eliminate Certain Specifi
cations in Contracts for Supplies of
Public Institutions.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Supervisors look a step yesterday that
may cause a couflct of authority between
the board and tne Health Department.
It was decided to recommend that the
clause in the contracts for iood supplies
for public institutions rtquiring con
tractors to exhibit and submit the goods
for examination at food inspection sta
tions before delivering them be elimina
ted.
This action was taken on the ground
that the officials of puDlic institution-* are
supposed to inspect good 3 delivered to
them and reject all that are not up to
Bieciti cation?.
The committee also decided to recom
mend that the board repeal the ordinance
requiring the materials mentioned to be
taken to the stations.
Sold Liquor to a Minor.
John Lynch, owner of a store at tho north
west corner oi Twelfth and Folsom streets,
will have to pay a fine of $100 for selling beer
to a 14-yenr-olu girl. He was convicted in the
Police Court but took an appeal to the Supe
rior Court. Judge Dunne reviewed the evi
dence and sustained the judgment.
Iturglar Jackson <Tailed.
James Jackson, convicted of burglary o[ the
second degree, was sentenced to serve ten

THE PUGILISTS.
George Green and Charley Mc-
Keever Will Meet on Wednes
day Evening.
Next Wednesday evening the National
Athletic Ciub will entertain gentlemen of
sporting proclivities at Woodward's Pa
vilion.
The club has a first-class card and
doubtless tbe place ot amusement will be
filled to overflowing with pleasure-hunt
ers. As already stated, George Green, the
clever Callfornian welier-weieht, will en
gage in a passage-at-arms with Charley
McKeever, who by the way is ranked as
the most polished exponent of the manly
art east of the big mountain!. McKeever
is a Philadelphian and his record of win
nings stamps him as being a remarkable
fighter.
Sporting men who have seen McKeever
in battle state that he is an extraordinary
quick tighter and that he uses excellent
judgment. Green will have an advantage
in weieht of probably eight or ten pounds,
and tbe handicap in his favor in this
particular leads many of the sports to the
opinion that he should win, as he is
ranked as being just as clever as his oppo
nent.
There are, however, some authorities
on the game who contend that the Cali
fornian will not go twenty rounds if the
battle be bard fought trom tbe start.
They advance in the way of argument the
fiehts that Green had with Tracey and
Smith.
One of the prominent sports of this City
said in the presence of a number of peo
ple a lew evenings ago at a sporting re
sort that Green was fading away in the
ninth and tenth rounds of bis tight with
Tracey and that if the contested been
twenty rounds instead of ten -Tracey
would have won the battle. Then when
Green fought Smith in Carson he was
growing weak wbeD Smith quit fighting.
It must be remembereJ, however, that
those fights were harri ones, especially the
Tracey njsbt. which was of the hurricane
order of thunip.ng from start to finish.
Green is improving with age and if he
fails to receive a verdict in his favor on
Wednesday evening his numerous friends
will be sadly disappointed. The betting
is 2 to 1 with McKeÂ«ver on the short end".
Tbe California Club will introduce for
the first time in thi s City on the evening
of the 31st inst. Frann P. Slavln. the pu
gilist who pave Puter Jackson such a hard
battle in England, bltvin was whipped,
but wnen the contest came to an end Jack
son was in a very bad condition. In fact,
the wonderful colored pugilist did not re
cover from the punishment he received for
many days after the batt c, and it will be
remembered that he has not fougnt a mill
worthy of any mention since that time.
Slnvin neglected himself, and for many
months after his defeat he live 1 a wild life,
which was fast making inroads on his
magnificent constitution. He left Eng
land for America about two years ago, and
while in New York he continued the pace
that kills for some month?. Finally be
realized that too oi act of a good time was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAT 22, 1897.
not conducive to either health or wealth,
and he resolved "to brace up" and have
another try for championship honors.
Within the past twelve months Slavin
has improved in health and although be
has met with some reverses he is still a
dangerous man in the ring. Judging
from his looks and general appearance
now he shouid give a tirst-ciass account
of himself when he nieÂ«sures arms with
Joe Butler, the colored Hercules of Phila
delphia, on Monday, May 31.
Slavin is training at the Seal Rock
House and his prospective opponent is
locat3d in San Rafael with MtixwelJ, who
is matched to tight Frank Rafael on the
same evening.
Butler's record gays that he has de
feated Smith, "the Thunderbolt," in three
rounds; Henry Baker in 1 minute and 32
seconds, Joe Goddard in three rounds,
and on the 3d inst. he put George Wil
liams to sleep in one round.
The Olympic Club has matched Billy
Smith of Australia an<l Baker, tbe fighter
who was whipped by Jeffrivs, for July.
THE ANGLER.
Why Coast Streams Should Be
Largely Stocked With
Trout Fry.
Trout fishing in the coast streams this
summer has been very poor. In fact the
sport is annually becoming less interest
ing, aud anglers are wondering why they
cannot journey to their lavorite streams
as in former years and return with some
thing like a decent catch of fish. They
forget, however, that there are new anglers
born daily and that yearly new faces are
seen on favorite waters.
Angling is becoming quite a fad, and as
the army increases the trout family gradu
ally decreases.
If the anglers of thi9 City, who are
many, should form a club possibly the
Fish Commissioners would give some at
tention to their suggestions, as in unity
there is strength.
The Call has always contended that
the streams which are fished 'he most
persistently should be stocked largely
every year. The Lagnnitas, Paper Mill,
Sonoma, Purissima and Lo-i Gatos creeks
should ba stocked with thousands of trout
fry at least twice a year, and the stocking
should be under the supervision of some
official who understands his business.
In a recent publication of an Eastern
journal, which is devoted to the sports of
rod and gun, there appears a very inter
esting communication from a fish cul
turist, in whicu it is stated that it is only
a loss of time and money to stock tront
streams with trout fry that are not at least
eight or nine months old. The writer
contends that the dumping of oaby fry
into tront streams means only a waste of
iishes. Doubtless the Fish Commissioners
will stock largely the coast streams that
are fished most next year.
The Spring Valley Water Company will
issue permits to stockholders who desire
to fish in San Andreas Lake on Sunday,
the 30th inst.
Charley Precht caught a beautiful
basket of fish last Sunday at Point Reyes.
The trout at tbe "White House" are of
good size and will take the fly only. In
the morning and evening the fishing is
reported as being first class.
The following catches were made at the
Geysers last week:
Frank Jordan of Alameda and If. Maion of
Oakland, 820; Jake Vassar, 57; J. Marsden of
Honolulu, 35; A. Vogelsang, John Slebe and
W. D. Mansfield, of San Francisco, 150. Total,
1057.
The following catches were also made at
Pieta Creek during this week:
R. Cantel, 54; P. Bargagliotti, 80; C. Cantel,
50; Ed J. Dunn and Mr. Richardson, of San
Fraucisco, big catches.
Angling at Glen Ellen continues to in
crease in interest. Boniface Harrison of
tbe Mervyn reports good catches daily and
states that the trout are already more than
"ringerlings." Two persistent lady anglers
are bringing in messes of nineteen to
twenty nice fish every day, and "still they
come."
THE OARSMEN.
Crews In Active Training for the El
Campo Regatta, to Take Place
May 30.
The members of the South End Rowing
Club are looking forward with great inter
est to tbe club regatta which is to take
place on Sunday morning, May 30.
Tbe three junior crews hare been train
ing bard for the past two weeks and at
great rivalry exists between them an in
teresting raca is expected.
Following is the list of those who have
entered up to the present date:
Senior skiff raceâ Frank Dupllssea and
Dr. Dennis.
Junior skiff race â James Foley, George
Fox, Henry Bode, Matthew Breen,
diaries Cutter and Thomas Barry.
In the junior shell event Robert Me-
Arthur is the only entry, but Ed Sbortall
and Joseph O'Dav are to be beard from.
In the senior barge event tbe losing
crew will pay for a French dinner. The
midgets will row in the same positions,
with Frank Duplissea stroke, Gus Carson
afterwaist, Bob McArthur forwardwaist
and Henry Bode bow.
Their opponents, known as tbe new
senior crew, will row in the following
positions: Ed Scully, .stroke; George
Bates, afterwaist; Matt Breen, forward
waist; James Pallas, bow.
The three junior crews are composed of
the following:
Crew No. Iâ Herbert Hawkins, stroke; Will
Mead, aftervraist: Frank Relchling, forward
waist; Frank Tobin, bow.
Crew No. 2â Joe Lyons, stroke; Alex Mc-
George, aftcrwaist ; Will Fox or Jim Neaion,
forward wai* ; Will Metierin, oow.
Crew No. 3â T. 1. Filzpatrick, stroke; Hugh
Mclsaao, aner waist; George Fox, forward
waist; Joe Campodonico, bow.
George McGrill, Doc Flynn and Frank
J. Burke act as cockswains.
It is now a certainty that George Phelan
of the Ariels will enter the senior skiff
race; in fact, he is having a boat built
especially for this event. This will bring
about the tong-looked-for struggle between
ho and McCausland. Among the other
material that is striving for entry in the
senior event may be mentioned* James
Wilson and G. Wutkoff.
In case a shell race is decided upon the
club will be represented by McOauslund
and Wutk( ff.
Andrew Carroll and C. McAulifft will
enter for the junior skiff.
A junior barge crew is now inconstant
training, the personnel being Archie
Tavlor, G. T. McGuiness, James o' Conceit
and C. Bulger.
There is much speculation concerning
who will comprise the senior barcre crew.
If Fbelan and McCausland can be pre
vailed upon to enter, the chances of se
lecting a winning crew will bo much
brighter.
The club is anxiously awaiting the com
pletion of Its new barge, to be ready in a
few days. If it proves as fast as is ex
pected it will doubtless be an added en
couragement to the aspiring oarsmen.
STOCKTON. Cal.. May 21.â At a meet
ing of the directors of the Stockton Ath
letic Association last evening it was de
cided to have a regatta on Stockton Chan
nel on tbe coming Fourth of July, or
rather, on July 5, since the National holi
day falls on Sunday. A bicycle race on
the afternoon of the slb was agreed upon
CHARLES S. DOLE, Nephew of President Dole of Hawaii, and
the Best All-Round Athlete of the Stanford University.
by a committee of the association and rep
resentatives of the Koad and Terminal
City clubs.
THE YACHTSMEN.
The Entries for tha Corinthian Re-
gatta on Decoration Day
Have Been Filed.
The last f raise of the Corinthians was a
great success. The boats had several
lively brushes, notably among which was
the race between the Elia and Pride.
Captain Ames made a boast that if the
Ella did not outsail the Pride he would
jump into the bay.
Now the confident mariner is sorry that
h6 spoke, for trie tars on board the Pride
have called upon him to make good bis
boast. List week they sent Inn a care
fully worded communication in which he
wan called upon to fulfill bis promise. So
to-morrow the jolly Corinthians are m
vitrd to assemble at the clubhouse at 4:30,
when the doughty captain will take bis
plunge. Bets are even that Ames will
wear a bathing suit.
There is no regular cruise on for to
morrow, but it is expected that a numter
of the yachtsmen will accept the invita
tion of Messrs. Schultze and Hill and
visit Larkspur, to take part in a grand
clambake. A launch will be in waiting at
San Quentin to tow the boats up the
slongb.
Measurer Gorter will measure all yachts
to-morrow which have entered the Cor
inthian regatta, which will take place on
Decoration day.
The regatta promises to be very success
ful, as there have been quite a number of
entries.
The following yachts have entered :
First classâ Clara, Elia, Rover, Speedwell,
Pride.
36-foot classâ Harpoon, Thelma, Thetis.
30-foot classâ .Eolus, Amieo, Mljtnon, Ten

nephew of President Dole of Hawaii, who
will go East to represent his college in a
forthcoming field â¢ day. Is one of the
best all-around athletes Stanford has ever
produced and his equal in this particular is
not often met. Among his athletic records
are the .ollowing: High Jump, 5 feet 9%
inches; broad jump, 21 leet 1 inch; poie
vault, 10 feet 11 inches; shot-put, 32 fee! ;
120-yard hurdles, 17 sec; 220-yard hurdles,
26 3 5 sec. ; 100-yard dash, 10 3-5 sec. ; 220
--yard dash, 23J Â£ sec.
Dole hah nun a number of university
honors. He was unanimously elected track
captain, and at the last intercollegiate field
day carried off three first places.
He has also been elected to several class dis
tinctions besides serving on the student body
executive and athletic committees. Dole has
served ks substitute three years on the Varsity
football team and only an accident at an in
opportune time has prevented him from
making the football eleven. Walter Cuuip has
a high opinion of him as a halfback. At
present he is one of Stanford's representatives
in the Pacific Athletic Association. He served
as one of the editors of the '98 annual this
year. Personally Dole is a great favorite. He
is a good student and a man of decided charac
ter. His major subject is law.

â¢ WOMEN'S AUXILIARY.
The California Branch <iolds Its Annosl
Sleet li g.
The California Brtnch of the Women's
Auxiliary and the Board of Mifsnns held
their annual all-day meeting in St. Paul's
Episcopal Church yesterday. The morn
ing session was devoted to the celebrating
of the holy communion by Bishop Nichols
and a sermon by the Rev. C. L. Miel, rec
tor of St. Paul's Church, Sacramento. His
text was: "I beard a voice from heaven
â aying unto me, Write, Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord."
Mr. Miel spoke of tne pain and the pleas
ure of workâ of unconscions work and
work the result of pain, of tne visible and
invisible (ffects, of faithful activity. He
closed with an appeal to the members of
the auxiliary to continue their work hope
fully unto the end.
A'lunch was -erved to the auxiliary by
the ladies of St. Paul's.
The afternoon session was called to
order by the president of the auxiliary,
Mrs. Newlands. The reports of the vari
ous officers were tnen read, showing in
many ways a decided improvement over
tne reports of 1896. During the year
$5878 66 has been raised by the auxiliary
and its many branches. The Bishop then
made a short address, in which he said
he hoped the ladies would be able to raise
the necessary $50 a month for an arch
deacon. He also spoke of the excellent
w>>rk being done by the mission clashes.
Mrs. Laurie, secretary of the auxiliary,
moved that the children of the kinder
garten schools be asked to eive fifty cents
a year toward baptismal fonts for mis
sions. This motion was carried unani
mously, and Mrs. Lauiie and Mrs. Nobles
were appointed a committee to a?'.
Short addresses were made by RÂ«v. Dr.
Sanford of Selraa, Miss Wade oi Berke
ley, Rev. Dr. Bours, Miss Juliet Smith of
the' juniors. Rev. Dr. Linsay and Mrs. L

Lawyers. Court and Jury
in the Fair-Craven Case
Victims of Ennui.
So There Was a Short Session
and Then Adjournment
to Next Week.
MaxGumpel, the Handwriting Expert,
Gats Mix d Up With Attorney
Foote Ov.r Illustrathns
The long and fatiguing work of a week
showed its effects upon the attorneys, and
in fact everybody else connected with the
Fair-Craven trial, yesterday, and by
mutual consent an early adjournment
was taken. ':'.'.â  ,'â ''
Tbe morn ing session was permitted to
protrude just a little into the afternoon
without taking the usual lunch recess
and then the whole case went over until
Monday. Judge Slack, upon whom the
strain is probably greatest, was only too
glad to enter into the rest-giving compact.
It was in consequence of this that the
: >n*ious!y awaited cross-examination of
: Hiud writing Expert Gumpel is still left a
matter for tiie future. Some stirring epi
sodes are kioked for when Attorney W.
W. Foote lor the defense gets Gumpel on
the. griddle. Mr- Foote is extremely net-
tti;igjn his methods â in fact has the repu
tation of being one of the severest cross
eXavuiners ia the professionâ and the
. rt is oi a highly excitable tempera
ment.
... The direct examination of Gumpel by
: iVitofney Miicnell was resumed when
coffrt opened for the morning session.
The expert said that one of his chief
reasons for saying that he believed the
Hire .of Senator Fair to the disputed
Mission-street deed was not genuine was
t: at ii- could not rind in it the character
istic of evenness and tiuency that he de
tected in Fair's every-day writing. ThiÂ»,
he said, had forced him to conclude that
the deed signature had been simulated
and writieu very slowly and carefully.
Am attempt, he thought, had been made
to impart this missing characteristic to
the alleged simulated signature by re-
Ing it in places.
Gum pel calied the attention of the jury
to the initial "J" in the deceased million
aire's narue and to one or two oiher let
ters, and said they had been retouched.
It became quite apparent at once that
at ieast some of the jurors sitting in the
case do not take everything for {-ranted
that fails from the lips of the handwriting;
experts. The deed with the signature
Gi.ru pel had just been analyzing was
passed to the jury for inspection, and
with it the magnifying glass he had been
using.
Each one took a squint at it. Juror
W lgtitman handed the deed back to Gum
pel and at the same time asked him. this
significant question:
"By what means were you assisted in
detecting those defects? '
'â I don't quite understand you, sir,"
said Gum pel, looking rather puzz.ed.
"i mean lo usk if you used this glnsa we
I through or sume other?' 1
'â¢Oh, this is the glass â the one you just
used," Gumpel.
Mr. Wiqiuirian nodded sort of doubt
fully and sat down. Unless his expres
sion belied his thoughts he hadn't seen
the glaring discrepancies the experts talk
about with so much assurance.
Resuming his uarra.ive Gumpel said he
had d. -covered something peculiar outside
nof the signature in connection with the Sa-
Borne-street deed. Tnis was that the words
â¢' ruber," "eight" and "iour/ 1 which
. tilled into trie date-line blank,
were nut written Dv the same hand thai
wo:e the body of the document. To be
more explicit he said he thought these
particular words were written by the In
dividual v.ho executed the "pencil"' will.
He ai-o gave a similar opinion regarding
ihe wonla "Mattie Craven" appearing in
ti.ed- .
Gumpel said he noticed that in both of
the si/naiures to the disputed deeds the
letter "a" appeering in James and in Fair
was open at the top. This was a feature
he could not find in any of Fair's original
writngs in use as exemplars. . . .
He wrote on the blackboard what was
intended to be a fac-simile of the signa
ture showing this delect, and in doing so
got himself into hot water. He had not
reproduced the signature exactly, and Al
torney Foote accused him of making a
faulty drawing for the special purpose oi
lending the jury astray.
G mpel ezciiediy denied the impeach
meni and tne attorneys for the plaintiffs
sent un a chorus of protests against Mr.
Fobte's remarks.
Mr. Foote got the original signature
from which Gumpel had made th draw
ing anil, handing the paper to the jury,
asked that it be compared with the black
board lac-simile in support of his accusa-
tion.
'iumpel said if it were so desired he
woull reproduce the signature to suit Mr.
Foote.
â¢'Oh, that's it, is it?" said Mr. Foote
ironically. "Then you can do it to suit
anybody. I guess that's ali I wish to
know."
Mr. Mitchell wanted Attorney Foote'a
remarks stricken from tno record, but the
latter gentleman insisted thai they stay
there, and they did.
That erasure beneath ihe words "Mattie
Craven" in one of the deeds, to which the
plaintiffs' counsel attach so much signifi
cance, \va3 now called to the attention of
Gumpe!. Alter he had announced that he
could see it plainly', he was asked for a
theory re.-ardinjj it. H;s response was
that, in his opinion, some nanip had been
erased ana the word Craven written over
it. Trie deed then went to the jury, and
each member was given an opportunity to
eearch for the erasure with the aid of
Gumpei's clas*.
After this the expert essayed to Illus
trate the alleged defects in another of the
disputed signatures of F.iir on the blaclc
board, and again cot into trouble wJih
Mr. Fonte on account of not reproducing
it correctly. It was while the disenssion
of this matter wsis going oil thai the ad
j lurnnient was taken.

AT SUTRO BATHS.
Attractions in Addition to the Usual
Kecreations This Afternoon
and livening.
For this afternoon and evening the man
agement of Sutro baths has provided spe
cial attractions of a novel character.
To see a real live man conduct himself
under water much the same as he does in
his natural element is something that
should cause considerable comment, and
this is just what Professor Karl will do at
Sutro Baihs this afternoon and to-nieht.
He eats, smoke?, writes, sieeps and drinks
under water, and every one in attendance
to-day can see the novel spectacle with
her or his own eyes.
Then there will be a hazardous feat in
ladder-climbing and balancing by John
Payne, who has performed all over the
world. The weil-stoc.ked museum, the
merry bathers and the thousand and one
other things which amuse and instruct
will also attract.
TABACCO TRUST IN JAPAN.
Little Brown Men of the Orient Are
Great Users of American
Cigarettes.
Captain J. D. Lee of Yokohama, general
agent in the Orient of the tobacco trust,
arrived here on the Belgic yesterday. It
has been seven years since be has been in
America, his native land. He says Japan
is an enormous user of tobacco, and that
China uses rnther more than Japan. For
this reason the great tobacco men of this
country who are in the syndicate, as well
as English importers, are Keeping a sharp
eye on the Orient.
"Japan in 18S8 consumed about
400,000.000 cigarettes," he said, "but is now
consuming probably 1.000.000,000 each
year. Of this vast quantity more than
200,000,000 are imported into Japan. Eng
land luruiÂ«hes 20.u00.000 or 30,000,000 of
this and America the rest. Japan and
China are great markets for American
tobacco, but freight! are so high that we
have to look out or the profits ere con
sumed."
General Agent Lee is on his way East,
and intends remaining in i is native land
for some lime, now that he has been away
so long.

CUSTOM-HOUSE DELAYS.
A Sharp Letter on the Subject From the
Treasury Department.
There han been much complaint among
shippers for some time past because of
their being required to make so many
trips to the Custom-house to transact
business, and because of the vexatious
rule whicn has been enforced by the Col
lector of the Port.
The attention of the Treasury D?part
ment was called to the matter by Special
Atrent Moore, and yesterday Collector
Wise received a !<harp letter from Wash
ington, containing the following:
Tht letter of the department was based upon
the report of the special agent, whicu indi
cated a ceni<urÂ»ble degree of looseness at your
port in the above matter, the special agent
averring that it was a frequent occurrence
'.hat thirty days eUused between the fl. ing of
entry end the lakingof the importer's declara
tion. This is confirmed by an inspection of
your rules. It is not muterlal at what particu
lar point in the proceeding on entry the dec
laration iÂ» tiled, and your rule allowing an in
terval of thirty days should be modified so as
to allow not exceeding five days' Interval.
So lar as the procedure in New York relates
to this question you are informed that the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 32, 1897.
CUPID LAUGHS AT
THE LATEST LAW
W. R. Hathaway and Mrs.
Martha R Talmage
Wedded at Sea.
Rev. Joseph Rowell Tied the
Knot oq Board the Big
Tug Vigilant.
A. License Could Not Bi Procured as
the Lady Had Not Been Divorced
Twelve Months.
William R. Hathaway, receiver of the
Spring Valley Water Company, and Mrs.
Martha 11. Talmage, who Keeps a lodging
house at G O'Farrell street, were married
at sea on the tug Vigilant last Wednesday.
On this occasion Captain John Silovich
did not perform the ceremony, but Rev.
Joseph Rowell of the Mariners' Church
saw that the tug was beyond the three
league limit and that the ceremony was
perlormed according to the rites pre
scribed by the Church of England.
Early in the week Hathaway went to
the marriage- license office and had a short
interview with "Oupid" Danforth. The
latter began making out the necessary
permit and when be came to the lady's
name looked up and queried, "'Widow?"
"No," was the answer. 'She is divorced
from her husband."
"How long has she been a divorced
woman?"
"About six months, I think."
"Can't is^ue you any license. Under
the new law a woman or man must be
divorced at least twelve months before
they can remarry."
It was then that Hathaway turned
mournfully away and sought consolation
on the briny deep. Ke was too much in
love to wail another six montns, so the
tug Vigilant was pressed into service and
the ceremony took place aa described.
It was blowing pretty fresh outside, and
the entire party had great difficulty in
keeping on their feet during the ceremony.
Captain SiloYfoh steadied the bride and
the Rev. Mr. Rowell and the groom de
pended upon each other for a mutual
support. It was a very subdued party
that disembarked from the Vigilant when
she returned to her moorings.
Hathaway is a well-known man-abont
town and a member of several clubs. His
intimate friends knew that he had a love
affair on his hands, but the name of the
lady of bis choice never leaked out until
yesterday. Some of Mrs. Talmage's
friends knew that she was about to be
married, but whom the prospective groom
was to be was a close secret. However,
the news is now out, and congratulations
are in order.
JAMES PATERSON DEAD.
0;d Ace and General Complica
tions Caused His
End
Dfceased Was Prominent ia Business
Circles â H: Leaves but a Small
Estate.
James Paterpon, a man of the early days
of this City, did yesterday morning at
his residence, 502 Powell street. Oid age
and general complications caused his
death.
Paterson was a member of the San Fran
ci co Stock and Exchange Board and was
at one time private secretary of W. C.
Italston when the Bank of California was
in the public eye. Paterson was at the
Stock Exchange yesterday a few hours
before his death.
Mr. Paierson was a native of Ayr3hirÂ»Â»,
Scotland, and about 73 years old. He
came to this City in the early fifties and
entered the employment of Daniel Gibb,
a pioneer merchant, as bookkeeper. He
was afterward one of the executors of the
will of Daniel Gibb, which trust gave him
much trouble before a final settlement was
made with the heirs. Paterson left the
employment of Gibb to become the private
secretary of W.C.iialston when the Bank of
California was at Washington and Bat
tery streets. When the bank removed to
iis present premises he still kept Mr.
Ralston's books, and also acted as assist
ant receiving teller for the bans.
August 17, 1876, the deceased becane a
member of the Sun Francisco Stock and
Exchange Board and bought the seal pre
viously owned by E. G. de Crano. As a
broker in mining stocks Mr. Paterson had
the usual vicissitudes, and in late years
was very unsuccessful.
Tne Sun Francisco Stock ond Exchange
Board will take charge of the funeral.
On the day of the funeral a committee
representing the board will attend.
Paterson leaves but a femall estate, lie
was unmarried.
SIMON'S CONTEMPT.
Attorney Schell Says It Was Not Com
mitted, liecaune No Order of
Court Wan Disobeyed.
Judge "Wallace heard argument yester
day in the case of Isadora Simon, charged
with contempt of court. It is alleged that
Simon, while actinjr as a jutor in the trial
of J. F. Turner, talked with certain per
aona in regard to 'he caÂ«e at issue.
Attorney Schoil introduced testimony
tending to disprove the accusation, and in
h;s argument declared that even if Simon
had dune all that was charged, yet it
would not constitute contempt of court.
Mr. Schell contended that the statute em
power the court to punish a juror if he
ignored the instruction not to converse
with anybody about the case.
"Would it not be a disobedience of a
lawful order of the court?" asked Judge
Wallace.
"It would not," replied Mr. Schell.
"The law doen not call the court's instruo
tion in this regard an order of court. It
Is called an 'admonition. 1 That is the
word used."
This led to a colloquy between court and
counsel touching Ihe proper definition of
the term contempt of court, it was agreed
that the Penal Code n silent in regard to
the question, and thatthÂ» oniy law baar
ing on this point is in section 1209 of the
Code oi Civil Procedure, whci says:
The following nets or omissions in respect
to a court of justice or proceedings therein arÂ«
contempts of the authority ol the court:
Subdivision llâ When summoned as a Juror
in a court, neglecting to attend or serve as
such or improperly conversing with a party to
an action to be tried at such court, or with any
other person in relation to the merits gf such
action, or receiving a communication from a
party nr other person in respect to it without
immediately disclosing the same to the court.
Deputy District Attorney Black thought
the power of the court was sufficient to
punish any juror who disregarded the in
structions of a Judge not to talk about a
case on trial. He thought that in a case
of this kind the word "admonish" was
equivalent to "order," and that an infrac
tion of the court's command was punisha
ble for contempt.
Judge Wallace manifested considerable
interest on the question, remarking that
the point was never raised before so far as
he knew; that it ought 10 be settled, and
the case was taken under advisement for
a week.
GRAND JURY SESSION.

IN URGENT NEED.
Supervisor* Provide Money for Medi
cines at the City and County Hos
pital and Almnhousi*.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has decided to recommend
that the one-twelfth act, by which the ex
penditure of appropriations is regulated,
be suspended in the case of the City and
County Hospital and Almshouse. The
reasons are set forth in the following re
port that has been prepared for presenta
tion to tne board:
In the matter of the appropriation for the
City and County Hospital, the appropriation

Fainting Spells and Dizziness
Follow La Grippe.
Wr Hear L,esÂ» About This Dlsxaie Than
formerly, but It Is Still Very
Prevulent.
From the New Era, Greensburg, Ind.
A noteworthy instance 01 the fallibility of
even the most skillful physicians is furnished
in the case of Mrs. J. E. cmithof Ureeu&burg,
Ind
For four years Mrs. Smith was flfiiicted with
a nervous affection that finally left her i.lmost
completely helpless and which the physician
v.ho first attended nor said positively could
not be cured. Subsequently, a number of
physicians in this and other cities declared
her case to be hopeles*.
To-day, in suite of 'he verdict of the doctors,
â¢ and without their aid, Mrs. Smith is perfectly
well. To a New Era reporter she told the
story of her extraordinary recovery.
Five years ago Mrs. Smtib, who then re
sidei upon a farm near C ifiy, haa a neveie at
tack of la grippe, followed later by another.
During the four years following her health
continued to dec'ine, uutil finally she was
hardly able to move.
"After having the grippe," said Mrs. Smith,
"I was able to be about lor awhile and to d*>
some worK. But in a short time after the sec
ond attack I began to experience nervi usness
and often had tainting spells, my irouule being
similar to hysterics. I gradually crew worse
ana in a short while I became subject to such
spells of nervousness that I could do no wort,
being scarcely able to move about the house.
1 could not sleep and could not eat. I would
lie awake nights, mv muscles twitching con
tinuously. My physirian called it nervous
ness of the throat and breast, and after treat
ing me for (several months said that my cÂ»Â»e
or any case 1 ke mine positively could not be
cured. Different physicians in Greensburg
and other cities who attended me agreed that
my case was hopeless. For three years 1 lin
gered in my misery, trying different doctors
and remedies, but none did me Â«ny notice
able Rood. Finally my druggist advised me to
try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People,
which were so highly recommended by news
papers. As a lastresort I tried them, thinking
that if they did me no koo 1 death might soon
give me relief. Tho first dose helped me, and
With every dose I improved. I took about
three boxes and a ha.f and wns completely
cured, as you see me to-day, perfectly healthy
and able to do all my own work."
Dr. WiUiatr.s' Pink Pills contain, in a con
densed form, ail the elements necessary io
give new life *nd richness to the blood and
restore shattered nerves. They me also a spe
cific for troubles peculiar to female?, such as
suppression, irregularities and all iorms of
weakness. They build up the blood and re
store the glow of health to pale and saliow
cheeks. In men they effect a radical cure
in all cases arising from mental worry, over
work or excess of whatever nature. Pink

"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington

COALâ Harrison's circular says: -During the
week there have been five, arrivals from Washing
ton with 14,307 tons of Coal, two from Oregon
with 665 tons, one irora Kritish Columbia with
2332 tons and two from Australia with 6721 tons
âtotal 23,025 tons. as trade is now our arrivals
are ample. this week . for. curre 11 demand; com
plaints are general of the stagnancy or trade In
this line, as even the consumers of steum grades
are diminishing their orders, -claiming thfir fac
tories are not runninz on full time. For domestic
uses dealers do not expect In May a continuance
of April trade, as the Â«ea her does not warrant it.
Notwithstanding our importations of fnel np to
date thii year have been lighter than u-ual, still
some of our yards show quite an accumulation:
yet some characters are in demnnrt, nome con
tractors being In arrears In tbeir deliveries. Aus
tralian and Swansea are In demand for the mo
ment, later on there will be ample for all consum
ers. There are 15 vessels due -re from Australia
prior to July 1 carrying over 000 tons of New
castle and Sydney Coals, as all these careoes have
passed out of first bands the market price will not
be disturbed. When it is known that freight en
gagements for Coal from Australian p>rts alone
will aggregate a capacity of over 160. L0J tons, all
to arrive here tnis year. It will be readily seen
there will oe no fuel famine ia 1897. Latost ca

SEASICKNESS.
Women Are More subject to It Than
Men, but Stnnd It Better.
"Are women more subject to seasick
ness than men?"
An Atlantic captain replies: "Yes;
but, on the other band, they stand it bet
ter. A woman struggles up to the point
of despair against the â what I might call
tue impropriety of the thin?. She isn't
bo much tortured by ttie pangs as she is
worried by the prospect of becoming dis
heveled, haggard and draggled. She
flints against it to the last and Keepsuf)
appearances as long as she can hold up
her beau. Then she becomes maudlin
and pathetic. She takes to her
room?, and invariably asks three ques
tions. First, whether people die of sea
sickness; then how many miles we
are from shore, and lastly when we shall
get there. She also often asks how deep
the water is, and if I think it possible for
any onÂ« to ro seven days without any
food. The doctor is always talked over.
I am asked time and again if I think he
is capable and efficient, and if I have con
fidence in him. When the patient gets so
ill that she loses interest in the doctor she
usually lies on her side and cries br the
hour. But, luckily, tne more violent at
tackj oniy last a short time."
"How i- it with men?"
â¢'Oil, mon give in at once. They make
a great rumpus until thÂ«r are compelled
to take to their berths. Tnen they grum
ble and croan until they are well enough
to ;;o on deck again. A great many pas
sengers come aboard loaded witb medi
cines tor the prevention of seasickness. I
never knew a preventive yet, except care
ful dieting.
BUEMESE GIELS.
Gossiping; and Flirting a* They Fill
Their Jars at the Well.
In every houseboM the daughter has
her appointed work. In all but the richest
merchants' houses the daughter's duty is
to bring the water from the well evening
and morning, says Blackwood's Magazine.
It is the gossiping place of the village,
this well, and as the sun sets there come
running down all the girls of the village.
As they fill their jars they lean over the
curb and talk, and it is here that are told
the lates' news, the latest flirtation, the
latest marriage, the little scandal of the
place. Very few mnn come. Water
carrying is not their duiy, and there is a
proper um<' and place tor flirtation. So
the girla have the well almost to them
j selves.
Almost every girl will weave. In every
house there will be a loom, where tho girls
weave their dresses and those of their
parents. And very many girls will have
stalls in the bazaar. O'tier duties are the
husking of the ric* and the making of
cheroots. Of course, in the richer house
hold â < there will be servants to do all this,
but even in them the daughter will fre
quently weave, either for herself or for
her parents. Almost every girl will do
something, even if it bo only to pass tne
time.

A YOUNG WIFE
Disarmed Her Husband
After He Tried lo Kill
Her.
After Attempting Suicide He
Secreted Himself in a Corn
Field
Mrs. Ringstaff Hal Drcided to Earn
Her Owe Living and Would
Not Sign a Paper.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9*33 Broadway, May 2L t
Neither Fred Kingstaff nor his wife will
die as the result of the attempted murder
and suicide just over ibe northern county
line a couple cf days aeo. Ringstaff was
employed on the ranch of Joe McKean,
but a little time ago he was disc, arged
for drunkenness, wnilo bii wife remained
at wort on the ranch. Ringstaff went to
the Bauman ranch and secured employ
ment, but his intemperance was such that
his wife declined to join him.
Several times recently Riqgstaff has im
portuned his wifb to return to him, and
has made ail kinds of promises lor the
future, but Mrs. Ringstaff has heard so j
many of his promises that have been j
speedily broken that she remained ob- |
durate, and heeded not his pleadings.
Early in the morning Ringstaff went to j
McKean's ranch and waited outside for
his wife to get up. He knew the routine
of the ranch and what time she would
arrive and where she would go to com
mence her day's work. As she came out
ot the house he approached her with a
paper which he asked her to sign. She
refused to do so and be then made an im
passioned appeal to her to go back and j
live with him, but she refused this request j
alÂ«o.
Ring'taff then fired thr*e shots at his i
wife, one of them taking effect in the back :
of the nsck. He then turned the weapon i
upon himself and put a bullet in the right j
Bide of his head, just above tiie ear. The i
pisto! being empty he then drew a razor j
and severely cut his wrist, after which he
ran off and hid.
Mrs. Kinzstaff says that after he shot
at her she ran towprd the woodshed, and
breaking down the door protected herself
on the inside. She heard him fire again,
and looking out saw him shooting himself
in me head. He wan about to shoot at
himself a second time, but the revolver
was empty, so he drew a razor from his
pocket. Fearing that he intended to cut
his throat she rushed out of the wood
s-tied, took the razor from him and threw
it over a fence. He went after it and then
cut his wrist. Ha was found in a grain
field by Constable Weidermann, and be
fore being landed, in the County Jail he
fain led.
Ringstaff asserts that he was so disap
pointed at his wife's refusal to believe in
Ins prom ses that he intended to commit
suicide. He says that he was trying to
.-noot himself and that his wife attempted
to take the pistol from him and in the
struggle it went off and wounded her.
None of the wounds are dangerous in
the case of either husband or wife, as the
bullets ware amm.ll ones and tne Charge
was not sufficient. The bullet has been ex
tracted irom Mrs. Ringstaff's neck, but
the one in her husband's bead cannot be
found and it is thought that it simply
made a fle3h wound and glanced out.

WALL OF SALT
How the Mathias House
Was Protected During
a Fire.
John Dorety Looked in Vain
'or a Trace of His
Former HDme
The Losses Are Very H ay? and Are
Not More Than Half Covered
by the Insurance.
Oakland Office Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 21. J
An inspection of the ruins ot this morn
ing's fire at Third ami Washington streets
showed that the damages to surrounaing
property are greater than were antici
pated immediately after the disaster.
Many dwelling-houses surrounding the
binned mills were badly damaged, and the
lo?s will not be less than $50,000, with in
surance not amounting to one-half ot that
amount
At the southwest corner of the burned
district the dwelling-house occupied by
Charles Matthias was saved by a wall of
salt. The Coward Bait Works were lo
cated next to Mr. Matthias' house and
were totally destroyed. The wreck pre
sents a peculiar appearance, for thP ware
house and all the fixtures have been
burned to the ground, but th* great stacks
of salt piled twenty feet high remain in
tact, and il was owing to this firewall that
the flames did not go clear through to
(May street on the southern end of the
block.
The flames leaped over the top of the
salt wall and charred the roof, but the
structure was s-aved because of tho im
penetrability of tnousands of sacks of the
salt.
The fierceness of the fire, which did not
last with any great degree of fury for
more than forty minutes, is easily Â»een
to-day by looking over the ruins. The
safe that was in Ingler & Atkinson's car
house became red hut and the brass ban
dies were melted off the door, but the
contents were only partially destroyed.
while the safedoor was twisted almost off
the hinges. All the fine machinery is dis
torted and broken, and a large circular
saw looks as t ough it had been put
through a crimping machine.
John Dorety, who lived in a little house
between the two mills, waa hunting this
morning for some trinkets that were in
his home, but so comuletely was all trace
of the dwelling obliterated that he had to
take bearinps :rom across the street to be
certain where his !iou-e had been. The
fierceness of tho flames carried his little
house into the air and distributed it over
dozens of olocks.
The insurance carried by Mann <fe Mole
and by the Coward Salt Comjany was
only sufficient to jay the amount of their
mortgages, and they are consequently
neavy losers'.

in the trial of the suit of Constable against
the city of Alameda, for extras alleged to
have been furnished by him in the con
struction of the addition to the electric

$1970, the bid beini: a very low one, and
Foster was given the position of superin
tendent of construction. Three days after
the work was commenced Foster says Con
stable approacbei him with a proposition
to stan 1 in with him in charging a good
price for extras, saying that if he would do
so he would divide whatever he got from
the city on that account Foster refused,
but never told about tiio offor until he
went on the witness-stand, when bis story
created a decided sensation. â¢ â  - â

Probationer Brasefield Told
by God to, Oppose the
Presbytery.
An Active Yjnng Preacher De

Mincing Words.
His Congregation Wants Him Or

Who 0 j-ct
Oakland Office !?an Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 21. )
H. D. Brasefield, Dastor of the Union
street Presuytenan Church, has a thorny
path ahead of him. The story of his con
flict with Moierator Perry regard in? his
acceptance by the presbytery, published
in The Call, created great Interest and
will be tinally decided in the fall.
Mr. Braseneld took the church when it
was partially disorganized and split into
factions. He was allowed to preach there
by the presbytery, upon the understand
ing that he would complete his theologi
cal training. He nas given great satis
faction and his congregation is anxious to
have him become their permanent and
fully ordainei pastor.
At the meeting of the presbytery many
objections were madn to his ordination
because he had not complied with the
Presbyterian polity. Mr. Brasefield
caused the moderator much uneasiness
last night when in defending his position
he said: "According to the general opin
ion, one would suppose that instead ot be
ing a candidate for ordination I was one
for San Quentin." This evoked a vigorous
protest, but the young minister was per
mitted to proceed. He told of how he
had applied at a previous presbyterial
meeting for a license, and how he had
been permitted to preach at that time.
He rontinned: "I have found out that to
talk with man is a mistake, so I talked to
God. Against my conscience I had to
take into my headand heart while at the
seminary things lhat did not help me to
save souls but that caused me to doubt my
Bible. One day in February I spent in
prayer and received a baptism of the holy
spirit not to be hsd in any seminary. I
asked God then if I should remain longer
at the seminary and he clearly told
me no. 1 had to leave the seminary
owing to improperly cooked food secured
at tlie Co-operative Club at 12 cents a day.
I came over here and got food t:iat would
sustain life and yesterday I rode ten
miles on my wheel in forty-five minutes,
and with proper food I can work sixteen
uours a day with any man. I returned to
the seminary and told the faculty plainly
that I must hare certain food if I was to
keep up my strength. They placed me on
the sick list, but i was not sick but lacked
proper lood to nourish me. When I went
before this presbytery for examination I
did not make any arrangements, as some I
know of, to have some brother get up after
a few questions had been asked and move
that lbj passed; but I stood ready, and
do now. to answer your qestions for six
hours if you see fit.
"I have found that it 1Â« better to trust in
God than put my faith in men, even of
men in this presbyiery- I may have
violated ?oroe law of the church, but the
president of the seminary said that had 1
requested I should have been excused
from tba examination. Whatever this
presbytery may finally do I stand before
it and God and know that I have his com
mendation though I may have your con
demnation. I have never moved to break a
Is w and have done everything above board.
I have awaited before God and have been
led by his voice. lam nothing, as I have
given myself entire'y to God to oe used as
lie sees fit.
"I am ready to take the examination for
the full three-year course, or even the
four-year, if necessary, and ask nothing
except what the examination may show I
am entitled to. I am ready to stand by
the result. In law a student is never
questioned as to the time he has studied,
but is passed on an examination of what
he knows. The presbytery will surely con
sider the heart of the man. lam ready to
be examined."
The Union-street Church is heartily in
favor of having Mr. Brasefield fully or
dained for its pastor. They say he has
built it up financially and spiritually, has
labored faithfully and has accomplished
much work. They hrve informed the
presbytery that if Mh ordination is refused
the church will be ruined. It is under
stood that Rev. Dr. Coyle and Rev. S. S.
Palmer are heartily in accord with Air.
Brasefield, and so it i.r.s been considered
advisable to lay the matter over for a few
months.

Allegation of an Attempt to Influence

OAKLAND. Cal., May 21.â The strug

It was stated to-day that an attempt
was being made to influence the Council

cilman Fibush had been spoken to by
Thomas Molloy, an ex-Assessor, now of

Mr. Fibush said to-nieht that while it

K&rd to the matter, he had not made any
charges, nor hid he been asked to be a
party to any underhanded scheme. He
knew of no attempt at bribery.

of tbe Galvins, which lot was accepted
and taxes paid upon it up to 1880.
In the meantime this land was claimed
as being inside of the Black Point Reser
vation, made snch by tbe proclamation of
President Fillmore "in 1851. After this
dafe a survey was made of this section by
the United Stales Government, in which
this block was not claimed as being
within the reservation.
In 1870 Congress passed an act ceding
to the City and County of Ban Francisco
its rights in and to the reservo land limit.
Under this grant Palmer obtained n deed
from the City on lot 1343, situated in
the disputed block, substantiating this, it
is claimed by the Galvins, by ex-parte af
ndavits, without tne:r knowledge, which
went to show that at that time (1370) the
land was in the actual and bona-fide
possession of a man nnraed Herman.
Against this the Gaivins claim they
never lo3t possession, and as a conse
quence i'.il mer's deed lost its force and
vitality. Yet it is deenvd necessary to
ask tbe Supervisors to instruct the City
and County Attorney to bring suit to set
aside the deed given to Palmer. This
simply means another method of quietine
title in the interest of the Galyin claim

senting tbe gods of all heathen nations,
from ToKyo to TimDuctoo. The export
trade to heathen countries is a compara
tively large one. altboueh more gods are
sent out to foreign dealers in curios in the
bazaars of Cairo, Damascus, Colombo, etc.,
lor sale to unsuspecting travelers anxious
to take home some mementoes of their
stay abroad.
The price of gods varies greatly. You
may get a Eirminxham-made one in a
London curiosity th jp for halt a crown or
you may run up tbe pretty bill oi Â£20 for
an especial usly one, "stolen," according
to the dealer, "by a sailor during the Chi
nese war."
In the Cairo bazanr, however, the pric^
of a nrnt-class god of this kind may run
from Â£20 to anything. A traveler in
fottued me writer that there was little
difliculty in detecting a go<l of native
make from one of Birmingham manufac
ture. Tne first generally displayed some
slight irregularity or change of design,
aue tr> tbe native working by hand, While
the Birmingham god was as superlatively
correct in form as tbe most immaculate
dandy is in dress.
Tbe trade in idols is^kept such a close
secret that it is difficult to estimate the
output, for in the board of trade returns
the gods would doubtless be clashed under
tbe humiliating title of "worksof art or
curios." But there is no doubt the trade
is a fairly large one and that some cute
Birmingham men do very well in the busi
ness.
X Bay on a Terrier.
The fox terrier is now officially regis
tered as a transparency, the Xray shining
through him like a candle through a Chi
nese lantern. The experiment has just
been tried on nn animal of this species
w. ich had swallowed a diamond ring, the
trinket appearing in its midst, visible as a
goidtisb in a glass case or a fly in amber.
The utilities of this penetrating beam may
expand till it will show up other than the
paltry pilferings of a terrier, perhaps even
t c swag of the political boss, notwith
standing the opacity of its bulk and
origin. â New York Tribune.

NOW IT IS WAR
TO THE KNIFE
President Potter Scores the
Seceding California
Wheelmen.
The Associated Cyclists Will
Fight Back With a Ven
geance.
A New Ro d Book to Be Issued ia
the Near Futureâ Gaining
Members Daily.
The latest action of Isaac B. Potter,
president of the League of American
Wheelmen, has made a war to tne knife â
a war of extermination â inevitable be
tween the California Associated Cyclists
and the fast dissolving Jforth California
Division, L. A. W.
Waen the first threats of secession were
heard in this State it was not the object
of the prime movers in the new oreaniza
tion to disrupt the divison, but merely to
take hold of the racing interests of the
coast and place them on a sound footing,
something that the league was unable to
do because it would not sanction Sunday
racing.
As long as tnis privilege was not dis
puted by the league those who have with
drawn to form a new affiliation of cyclists
were willing to let matters remain as they
were, though they did not feel that they
were getting much benefit from the old
organization, inasmuch as large amounts
of money were sent East from which
there was absolutely no return.
When, however, the league decided not
to sanction Sunday meets the last bond
between the strong men in cycling and
the leaeue were severed, and secession and
the formation of the Associated Cyclists
followed as a matter of course. Up to the
present the Associated Cyclists have not
been overacgressive, merely getting what
members were willing to come in, but a
circular letter that has been sent out over
President Potter's signature has aroured
them to a pitch that means trouble on all
hands. The letter reads as follows:
To All Loyal Members ofXorlh California Itivi
eion: You nnve a new chiei cosisui, a tried,
loyal aud able officer, in tbe person of George
11. Strong, whose address is 2.0 Market s;ieet,
San Francisco. You have a loyal, zealous and
efficient vice-consul in the person oi Francis
T. Dwyer, whose address is Sacramento. The
gentlemen whom you elected a lew months
ago to hoid division oftit.-s.-s have resigned and
hare combined together in a conspiracy to j
destroy your division. You have received cir
culars from these conspirators suggesting that
you join in this effort to make "secession" a
popular word in a loyal State. They have
s.-ized the road books of tue division upon a
pretended cluitn of debt, made by men who
were league members a few weeks ago, and
have tried to wrest this property from the j
hands of the organization. They hay*
called in the ceivices of the Sheriff
in order that these road books plight j
be sold iuto their own possession and used as 1
weapons to further in jure the North California |
division. You have been cajoled aud misied. I
Facts have been misstated, ialsehoods invented j
and every effort made to encourage the false
impression that the wheelmen of the East are !
not your friend*. You have been toid that me
North California division is "dissolved." Let j
me sugeest to you this fact: When a man re- I
signs from the L. A. W. he lakes nobody out
but himself. No man can "secede" for an- i
other. Each secessionist is sole proprietor of
his own rascality. If these gentlemen who j
have claimed to represent your interests have j
confuted you follow the old and safe rule:
"When you are in doubt, fight." I am receiv
ing letters and postal cards from California by
every mail, pledging tne loyalty of our old
league members. Sena them hereafter to
Chiet Consul Strong, whose address 1 have
given you. North Calilornia should De wide
awake from tuis time on. Your interest! will
be protected and every L A. W. member of
North Calilornia in the 1807 will have reason
to remember his loyalty lor all time to come.
Isaac B. Potter, President.
The Associated Cyclists have taken off
their coata since this letter came to light,
and are prepared to do battle to the bitter
end. Tbey point to ihe fact that Presi
dent Potter has left tbe impression in hia
letter that the road books of the division
are still tied up and that the secessionists
wanted to keep the books from tho officers
of the league. -
"Why should we want those ' books,"
said a prominent member of tbe cyclists j
yesterday, "wnen we have in course of
preparation the road book of the California
Associated Cyclists, that eclipses the old
book in every way? We are working
night and day on this volume, and five of
us put in the time between 6 o'clock Fri
day night and 5 o'clock Saturday morning
revising and improving the matter tbat is
to go into it.
"It will contain a table of distances and
new maps that are far more accurate than
those containd in the old division book
and will also cive the locations and terms
of ihe official hotels as well as the names
of local representatives throughout the
State.
"We have no fear that the league will
ever get the upper hand in this State
again. When the fizht started the divi
sion had 1700 members, now it h&s but
1100 and this number is decreasing daily.
Tne difference represents the membership
of the Associated Cyclists, and the organ
ization is growing in popularity daily.
"President Potter can roar ana mis
represent facts as much as he pleases, but
it don't take a representative of the cyclists
long to convince a wheelman of tbe vastly
greater advantages of tne association
when compared with those of the league.
"This is war to the knife, and when the
fact is taken Into consideration tbat we
already have in the association tSe large
majority of the best men in cycling in
California to-day and Â«r<Â» gaming many
new recruus daily it will be seen that
there is no chance for the league to re
vive." '
Blind Watchmaker*.
There have been blind watchmakers. In
former years there was one living at Hol
beacb, in Lincolnshire. His name was
Kippin, and although completely blind,
he could take to pieces and put together
again watches of most delicate construc
tion with surpassing ea-e. lie was robbed
once of some of the tiny belongings of
his trade, such as wheels, hair-springs,
etc; the thief was traced, and kippin
identified and swore to ins property by
the touch.
At Barnstable, too, in the early part of
the present century, there was another
"ticb prodigy. His name was William
Huntiy; be was born blind, and was
brought up by his father}- who was a clock
and watch maker, to that business. The
inhabitants bad great faith in him, and
he bad plenty of employment; musical
clocks and watches even were repaired by
him without difficu'ty ; and it is said that
in some cases where other tradesmen had
failed to discover a ilofect, be detected the
fault and set it rieht." â Tit-Bits.

The Coat of Schooling.
The number of children in the public
day schools of Boston is now about 72,000.
For the past live years the increase has
averaged over 2000 a year; last year it was
considerably larger. This is double the
annual increase ten years ago, at which
time, according to Superintendent Sea ver's
report, the average annual expenditure
lor new schoolhouses was less than |200
for each new pupil. For the last two
years thi* expenditure has increased to
nearly $268 for each child, bringing the
coÂ«t of new schoolhouses from less than
#00,000 to more than $500,000 annually.

Attempt to Break Up the Meet
ii g, bat in Vain.
Abont fifty unfriendly persons packed
a meeting of the Richmond District Im
provement Association last night in
Simon's riali and caused a disturbance
tbat fora while threatened to breakup
tke meeting. Order was restored by the
vigorous action of Policeman Schafer,
who arrested M. Haverty of Laurel Hill
Cemetery for disturbing a public meeting.
The disorder at one time was so great
that about a dozen ladies, owners of real
estate in the district, were frightened out
of the room. The speakers voiced the in
dignation of the order-loving citizens of
the district that persons employed as
gravedip<;ers sni workmen in the ceme
teries, together with <ome of the repre
sentative push of the Western Addition,
should have injected themselves into the
meeting for the purpose of breaking it up.
Chairman C. H. Hubbs and Secretary J.
G. Maloney notified Olticer Dennis Hogan,
on duty at the meeting, thai a crowd was
present bent upon raising a row for tbe
purpose of preventing the passage of any
resolutions recommending ttie removal <.f
the cemeteries from tho district. The offi
cer Btttioned himself in front, next the
table at which sat the chairman.
Secretary Maloney read the following
resolution^ which hud been unanimously
adopted by tne executive committee:
Resolved, That we thank the daily press of
th;s Ciiy for their effort* to lay the lacts of
tiiis agnation before the public, nnd particu
larly The Daily Morning Call, which has uy
i is action in this matter endeared itself 10
and deserves the approval of every property
owner aud resident of the Richmond ais
tncL
The following were also unanimously
adopted :
Resolved, That the executive committee ask
for mail dÂ«livery for the outside district.
Resolved, We approve of the firm stand taken
by the street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors in the matter of the grading, etc., of
California street, between Ceutral and First
avenues, at their meetiug Thursday, and be
lieve that such firmness and determination is
what is needed to obtain for citizens and tax
payers their right?.
The following letter was read from
Mayor Pheian:
Gentlemen: I regret very much that a previ
ous engagement prevents me from being
preseni at your meeting to-night, called lor
the purpose of agitating tne removal oi the
t ity cemeteries. I a>sume that your meeting
wiil appoint a committee to present your
reasons for such removal to the Board
of Supervisors of tnis City and Coumy,
and as president of the board
and as Mayor of this City 1 will be pleased to
receive tntm and to give heed to their peti
tion. Personally lam in favor of forbidding
interments within the City and County of
S :i Francisco and the ultimate removal of
the large cemeteries. They are not only a
menace to life but they stand in the pathway
oi municipal growth and development.
Ricnmona, one of our most promising su
burbs, can never attain its natural growth if
stunted and dwarfed by the presence
of burying grounds. It is important to
ban Francisco, inasmuch as she is
cutoff by the waters of the bay and sea from
expansion in tnose directions, to sedulously
cu.tivate the growth oi such suburbs at she
possesses. Otherwise we cannot hold our
growing population, which will naturally go
across the bay or to other cities where the con
ditions of life are more agieeabie. So I rec
ommend to you to persevere in the efforts
wcich you have begun and ultimately you will
succeed because you are right.
The following was read from Mayor
Butro:
San Francisco, May 21, 1897.
To the Richmond Jjihtrict Improvement Asso
ciation: Please pardon me iÂ«>r not beiug pres
ent at your important meeting set for this
evening, but overwork and a slight indisposi
tion make it impracticable for roe to be there.
The object of your meeting is to take steps
for the removnl of the City cemetery, one
which deeply affects all the inhabitants of the
Ricbmoud district, and, in fact, all the people
iii 6:iu Francisco.
Modern science has demonstrated and
proven the existence oi bacteria in decaying
bodies, which are often the bearers of con
tagious diseases, .he germs wherof float in tne
air and are carried by tbe wind great dis
tances. Tuts is a danger and threat to all the
inhabitants, and should not be permitted to
remain for one single day longer than may be
necessary to make a removal.
Undor our laws the City minorities have
the nph; to exchange land used for a City
cemetery for other land more suitable for the
purpose, and as the land in present use is
more valuable than land iurtner out in the
â¢ ::y a surplus will be available in making the
exehÂ«nec sufficient to remove all the bodies
and improvements to a new cemetery without
any aauilional burden on the City.
Sooner or later tne cemeteries must be
moved, ns has been the case in all the large
cities, and the sooner a permanent cemetery
is secured the belter it will be for every one
concerned in the dead.
1 am, therefore, in favor of having the City
cemetery removed, and hope that your associ
ation will succeed in accomplishing this ob
ject.

Reasons Why the Cemetery Should Be Removed.
Whereas, The district lying between Golden Gate Park and the Presidio and west
of Central avenue has within the past few years made enormous strides in its rapid
growth and development, due mainly 10 its location and healthy surroundings,
barring the cemeteries, and particularly the bliglit on the district known
as the City Cemetery, which is the burying - place of paupers
and all Chinese who are buried in tins City, many of whom die
of loathsome diseases, and who after a time are disinterred, their bones scraped and
then the same are shipped to China. This blight is situated just west of the settled
up portion of the Richmond District, over which district the ocean winds blow direct
Jrom this potter's tieid and carry with them microbes and other invisible messengers
of death and disease, thereby imperiling the lives of many of our citizens, a dan
gerous and undisputed fact, which alone should be sufficient cause for its immediate
removal; and
Whkreap, The territory occupied by this pest-breeding cemetery, situatod jib it is
on the western slope of this peninsula, the most beautiful Bpot upon it, and in close
proximity to the world-famed Cliff House, Seal Rocks and Sutro Heights, those much
sought after resorts of our citizens, places visited by almost every stranger from
abroad, we deem it a shame and a disgrace that this much avoided spot and its
death-producing causes should be longer maintained oil a place where only health
should be sought, and
Whereas, The Board of Supervisors have power under the law to exchange Â»aid
property for other property elsewhere, and which exchange can be done without
cost, but, ou the contrary, to the pecuniary advantage and benefit of our tamayers;
and
Whereas, Boards of Health, both State and local, have declared that these
cemeteries are dangerous to public health; and
Whereas, We believe that the Board of Supervisors are earnest in their desire
to protect ar>ove all things the public health, and in that respect will have the aid
and assistance of the Board of Health, and the approval of all citizens who
favor the future of our City, as well as the support of the all-powerful press
of this City, and in fact all but a few who from mercenary motives
may oppose it that they may reap a few dear-bought aollars, purchased at the
price ol obstruction to progress, misery, and even death; but as they are in a small
minority they muit give way to progress and the advanced ideas of the citizens of
this City, who believe in progress and also that the health of our citizens is para
mount to all other things, and must and shall be protected; therefore be it
Besoived, That we, ihe citizens and property-owners of the Richmond District, in
mass-meeting assembled, do petition the honorable Board of Supervisors of this City
and County to take immediate stecs to exchange the City Cemetery
property for other properly outside the County and prepare the
acquir d lands for burial purposes and have all bodies removed
thereto from the present site, and that we also ask the co-operation of the honorable
Board of Health in this important matter.
Jiesolvrd, That a copy of above resolution, etc., be sent one to the Board of Super
visors and one to the Board of Health of this City and County, for their action in the
matter.
trict would join in this movement its success
will soon be secured. Respectfully submitted,
Adolph Sutro.
Then followed the reading of the partic
ular expression of opinion for which the
meeting had been called â the reasons why
the cemetery should be removed.
The "push" from tho graveyards, led
by M. Haverty of Laurei Hill Cemetery,
Thomas Kerr of the Odd Fellows' Cem
etery and Joseph Andrews of the Masonic
Cemetery, roared, "no, no, no."
Chairman Hubbs said that the disturb
ers were not property-owners in the dis-
trict.
"People would never know there was a
cemetery here at alt if it wasn't for you,"
shouted one of the grave-diggers.
E. P. E. Troy arose and remonstrated
with the disturbers. If they did not like
the meeting they should go away and
hold a meeting by themselves.
Haveny interrupted Troy several times,
and the chairman demanded that Police
man Hogan should :.rrest him, but Hogan
relumed to do so. He said that there was
no disturbance.
The confusion became so great and the
language used by the rough element who
packed the meeting became so foul that
neany all the women left the hail in ter
ror and disgust.
Ch drman Hubbs proceeded to make a
speech calling for order, but he was inter
rupted with cries of "Amen ! '
"l*es, it is amen," retorted the chair
man, "and so mote it be."
President Hazel of the Western Addi
tion Club attempted to speak, but he was
insulted.
The arrival of Officer Schafer and the ar
rest of Haverty restored order, most of
the mob leaving the hall to the orderly
people, and the meeting proceeded with
ou' further interruption.
Mr. Troy argued that the cemeteries
prevented the opening of the streets anÂ«i
south of the cemeteries to the park the
streets were blocked. He did not believe
that it was a fair proceeding to allow the
disturbers to participate in the deliber
ations because they had come ev;den:ly
with instructions to break up the meeting.
He was astonished that persons "who
sold their manhood for a drink" should
disturb a meeting and frighten away a
large number of lady owners of property
in the district.
AV hen the people of San Francisco saw
that men working in the cemeteries would
go to an orderly meeting and act like
rowdies mey would frown down such out
rageous conduct. Tiie people would be
aroused to indignation by the action of
these rowdies.
"Tnat'i right," cried a young lady
standing near the door. "Give it to
ih^m."
Mr. Troy did not believe that Dersons
interested in the cemeteries were entitled
to any justice whatever, and because of
their disgraceful conduct at the meeting
he would insist upon the removal of all
the cemeteries.
Chairman Hubbs announced that here
after meetings would be held every
Wednesday night and that no one would
be admitted without a card of invitation
from the cnairman, "and," added he, with
a significant emphasis, "we will send
cards only to gentlemen."
Then Mr. Hubbs gently cbided the few
disturbers who had remained, but who
were orderly in the stalwart presence of
Policeman Schafer.
Joun Henderson, the next speaker, re
marked that be thought be had dropped
into an old-time political ward meeting
when the disturbance was at its height.
T&en he turned to the subject of the
healthfnlness of Richmond.
He said that cemeteries were always
located upon healthy sites, with a tine
view. In the present case the cemeteries
were on ground from which a splendid
view of the bay and Mount Tamalpais
and Mount Diablo could be had, because
people wanted a magnificent prospect for
a grave, though what use a dend man
would have for a line view be was at a
loss to imagine.
The people who select a grave for a
friend, very often did not care a ran where
their friend lived when h** was alive, "but
when he is dead and can't enjoy it he is
given a sunny slope and a fine view.
That wÂ«s why the resident of Tar Flat
was buried out in the Western Addition,"
added Mr* Henderson.
Cemeteries brought no business to the
district. "You can't make money and be
successful alongside of a graveyard," ho
added.
Secretary Vlaloney read the names of
the following property-owners who ban
been appointed as a committee to bring
the matter before the Supervisors : Adolph
Sutro, J. C. Jordan, George T. Marsh, A.
Sbarboro, C. H. Hubbs, A. S. Simonds, J.
C. Buckell, Prentice Smith, M. V. Samuels
and J. G. Maloney.
Major B. McKinn* called attention to a
district from which cow ranches had been
removed, and on which site beautiful resi
dences had been erected and the value of
which had increased ten fold.
He argued that no one had a right to
sell lota in the City Cemetery, because the
cemetery belonged to the whole people of
the City and County. New communities
in the City were generally conservative
and good people, and that was the kind of
people who had settled in the Richmond
District.
The resolutions were adopted and the
meeting acijourne !.

Past Ten This MorningâManu
facturers Talk.
The manifest for the 105 barrels of adul
terated California brandy, about which so
much stir is being mado, was filed with
the Naval Officer yesterday morning.
Naval Officer Irish wired the facts of the
case to the Secretary ol the Treasury and
suggested that the brandy should be
stopped whsn it reached New York by
rail.
After the manifest had been filed the
105 barrels were taken out of the bonded
warehouse and placea on Southern Pa
cific freightcars at Fifth and Townsend
streets.
At 4 o'clock Food Injector Dockery
mnde bis appearance with two assistants
and bored holes in three of tte barrels for
the purpose of allowing the contents to
escape, their intention being to spill all
the liquor in the 105 packages.
While they were thus engaged C. F.
Gerald, foreman of the freight sheds, and
W. H. Hardy, his assistant, called in Po
licemen T. L. Ryan and John Moriarty
and demanded that they should place
Dockery under arrest. The officers re
fused lo do so, as they realized that Dock
ery was a public official, acting under
color of law, and that they had no au
thority to interfere.
Then Gerald and Hardy geized Dockery
and attempted to remove him forcibly
from the car, whereupon Dockery asserted
his authority, piaced the two men under
arrest and marched them to the Southern
station.
After a consultation with Captain Spil
lane Dockery agreed not to enter any
cbarge against Gerald and Hardy and all
returned 10 the freigiityards. While they
bad been gone other employes of the rail
road company had ihifted the cars con
taining the brandy, so that Dockery could
not find them for a little time.
Collector of th<Â» Port WisÂ«, United
States Marshal Barry Baldwin. United
States Attorney Foote and Mr. Sproul of
the Southern tactic Company appeared
on the scene while the railioad seals were
being placed on the cars. Wise wanted
to know "who this man was" that had at
tempted to interfere with the transit of
goods in cliarge of the Government.
Dockery announced that he whs the
man who had been inquired for, aud Wise
informed him that the goods were under
the seal of the United Stales. This state
ment was denied by the Food Inspector.
He said that the seals on the cars were
of the Southern Pacific Company and that
the barrels were not stamped.* Attorney
Foote warned Dockery that he was inter
fering with the authority of the United
States Government and that he might get
into trouble.
Collector Wise announced that he would
telephone to the Appraisers' building for a
lot of Deputy United States Marshals to
arre3t Dockery and his assistants, but
after a consultation with Mr. Sproul it
was agreed that an armistice should be
declared until half-past 10 o'clock this
morning, until which hour the railroad
oflicials agreed not to move the alleged
brandy.
Mr. Dockery said last night that while
he was boring a hole in the third barrel,
a man came In with some Government
stamps, and proposed to place them on
the barrels, but Dockery would not allow
him to do so.
INDIGNATION MEETING.
Manufacturers and Producers Are
Aroused to Action.
The board of directors of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association met
yesterday. A healed discussion of the re
cent exposure of the traffic in adulterated
brandy resulted In the adoption of the
following resolution:
Whkreas, It has been reported to the Manu

( orn spirits from Nebraska, glucose, water and

Resolved, That this association strongly con
demns such adulterations of California
brandies, and we urgently request the Board

cisco to take such action under the laws of the
feiate of California as may be necessary to con
demn this adulterated liquid and have the
guilty parties punished according to law,

tion to the officers of the Board of Health for
the vigorous prosecution of this Infamous at
tempt to ruin one of the most important iu
dustries of the State of California.
Resolved, That we heartily approve the ac
tion of our president m having promptly
commended the action of Colonel John P.
Irish, Naval Officer, who has made an effort to
stop the adulterated brandy from being
shipped in boud, with the stamp of the United
States Government thereon, ana thus prevent
the consummation oi this intended fraud.
A message of congratulation was ordered
sent 10 Colonel John P. Irish for his re
fusal to let the brandy leave the Slate.
It was decided to communicate with the
Boards of Kealih of the various counties

WARNED NOT TO
GO TO HAWAII
Labor Council Fears for
the Fate of American
Workmen.
The Executive Committee Will
Gather Information on the
Subject.
Municipal Ownership ofWater Works
Discnssec â Union Products at
Picnics.
The Labor Council discussed the ques
tion of Hawaiian immigration at length
last evening and arrived at the conclu
sion that in the present state of affairs it
would not be policy for American labor
er* to go the islands.
Commission E. L. Fitzgerald of the Bu
reau of Labor Statistics sent in a long
communication on the subject in response
to a request from the council that he give
his ideas of the labor situation in the isl
ands. The reply was a long resume of the
report that the Commissioner made on his
return from Hawaii.
Delegate Furuseth of the Coast Seamen's
Union and others differed from the Com
missioner in his estimate that there was
no slavery, practical or otherwise, in the
islands.
They contended that the evidence of
disinterested parties was that if the labor
ing classes there were not practically in
slavery they were very near it.
The matter was disposed of by i nstruct
ing the executive committee to draw up a
warning to American labor to refrain
from going to the islands for the present.
The committee was also instructed to
gather certain information regarding the
laws'of the Hawaiian Government relat
ing to the enforcement of the contract
laoor laws and report the result of its
investigations at the next meeting of the
council Friday evening.
Doiegate Scott wunted a resolution
adopted declaring that Mr. Fitzgerald's
report was the result of a political scheme
looking toward the annexation of the
island-, but the matter was referred to the
committee en resolutions for considera
tion.
Secretary Rosenberg moved that Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald be invited and
requested to be present at the next meet
ing of the council to answer questions re
garding the feasibility of the emigration
scheme to Hawaii.
The motion was carried.
The council considered the matter of
the employment of San Francisco musi
cians at Blair Park, which wascomplained
of by the Oakland Musicians' Union, and
resolutions were passed condemning it.
The executive committee was instructed
to look into the matter, and try to ar
range it in an amicable way.
A communication was read from the
San Francisco Association of Improve
ment Clubs, asking the council to use its
influence with the Board of Supervisors to
induce that body to accomplish municipal
ownership of water works.
It was decided to refer the matter to the
executive committee with instructions to
take whatever action may be deemed
necessary.
The chairman suggested that the organ
izations giving picnics be visited and re
quested to hire union musicians and other
labor, and to sell union goods. The sug
gestion was adopted and the visits will be
made by members of the executive com
mittee. .
LIKE FINDING MONEY.
Digging ' P Dollars Laid in the Floor
of a Saloon.
"Silver Dollar" Smith has reason to be
lieve that the times are hard. He said so
to-day.
Smith's tale is a pathetic one. He is a
self-made man and has sen much of the
world â that is, of New York. At one time
he served in tha Assembly. In 1877, hav
ing acquired a considerable fortune,
Smith opened a saloon on Essex street.
Something like $1000 of his bank notes
Mr. Smith changed for silver dollars at
the sub-treasury, and in the center of each
slab of marble in his floor he sank one,
having previously scooped out a hole of
sufheipnt sizn and furnished it with
enough cement to prevent trip coin from
wandering from its place. Back of the
j bar and at various other points in the two
' rooms making up the saloon Mr. Smith
placeJ about 500 more silver dollars, and
lrom tbat time un'il now he has been
known as "S'lver Dollar" Smith.
In those days Mr. Smith kÂ«pt two bar
tenders on all the time. Not only did
those men draw drinks for the thirsty
throngs, but they also kept a sharp eye on
the dollars. Years passtd. however, and,
although numerous attempts were made
at different times to lift some of the coins,
the cement held and the attempts always
failed.
But, recenfly, business slumped, and
"Silver Dollar had to let one of his bar
tenders ko. At the same time he dug up
some silver dollars from the floor of the
rear room and put them in bnnk. That
left a total of 650 coins in the floor of the
front room â a sufficient amount, the ex-
As emblyiiKin thought, to keep his title
alive.
The remaining bartender is William
Eiden, but the habitues of the piace call
him Billy. It is one of Billy's duties in
the morning, when he comes on, to count,
the silver dollars in the floor and see if
they are ail there. At night he does it
again. For weeks and weeks he has done
this every day, and until a month ago the
counts always tallied and Billy was
happy.
At that time, however, the night count
showed a loss of $2. The empty holes
were near the door, liilly could not get
the slightest clew to the identity of the
thief, and no one wo bad been in the
place during the day that he knew had
seen any one at work on the dollars. Dol
lars continued to disappear up to Monday,
when the count showed that since the be
ginning of the new year twenty-two of
the coins had been extracted.
Smith and Biily held a consultation and
the ex-Assemblyman ordered the latter to
"do up" the first man who touched one
of the dollars. Billy declared tbat he
would do it, and he meant it, too, but sub
sequent events showed that even an Essex
street bartender may be a soft mark under
certain circumstances.

vidual entered th* saloon end, stepping
up to the bar, whern a number of men
w*re drinking, asked Billy if he wanted
to buy some buttons. The man had been
there many times befuro and was an un
welcome visitor. Accordingly, Billy gave
him the "marble heart" and frightened
the fellow so that he dropped his buttons.
Just then there was a rush at the bar and
Billy lost sight of the vendor. Later, in
making the night count of silver dollars,
Billy discovered that a beautifully chased
coi" near the door was missing.
Then a light began to break in on him,
and after thinking tlie matter over he re
called that the visits of the button man
and tne disappearance of "Silver Dollar's"
wealth had been for some time simul
taneous. The police are looking for the
stranger, but no trace of him has vet beea
found.â Now York dispatch to St. Louia

The Oyster as a Mouse Trap.
A photograph is being exnibited by W.
Crandali in a fishmonger's shop in High
street, Tunbriiige Wella. It represents
three mice hold fast by an oyster, their
beads not being visible. The fishmonger
says that the murderous bivalve was one
of fifty taken home by a customer and
placed on the pantry floor to be eaten for
supper. It is supposed that the oyster,
gaping for water, axposed to Messieurs
Mice a tempting morsel, which they went
