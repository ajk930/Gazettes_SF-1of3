TO MAKE THE
FINAL STAND.

Reports That the Turkish Hosts Will Not
Pursue the Greeks Beyond Larissa.
England Urges the Powers to
Save the Hellenes.
ATHENS, GREECE, April 25.â The Government has decided to
persevere in the struggle and resist the further advance of the Turkish
army with increased energy. A new line of defense stronger than
that on the frontier will be established. The British and French Con
suls at Volo have telegraphed to the British and French Ministers here
asking that warships be sent to Volo. In view of the possible Turkish
advance the Ministers have in consequence asked instructions from
their Governments and notified British and French Admirals at Canea
of the request.
POWERS ARE READY TO INTERVENE.
LONDON, ENG., April 25.â 1t is reported to-night that the British
Foreign Office has been busily communicating with all the other
members of the European concert since yesterday afternoon, suggest
ing that the time for intervention is at hand. It is said the German,
French and Italian governments have already intimated a willingness
to intervene, Germany insisting, however, on a pledge from Greece
that she will hereafter obey the mandate of the powers. The British
officials are sanguine that Greece will comply, insuring a complete
understanding this week. Henry Norman telegraphs from Athens:
"King George means to go to the front and make a decided stand at
Pharsala."
OVERWHELMED BY FORCE.
Deeds of Valor Performed by the
Greeks as They Fell Back
From Mati.
LONDON", Emj.. Aprii 25.â The Athens
correspondent of the Daily Mail gives
further details of the battle of Mati. He
ears that after performing prodiaies of
valor the Greeks were slowly lorced back
by overwhelming numbers. Their spirit
was unbroken. They shouted as they
â were driven back: ; 'Hurrab! hurrah!
"War to the doath !" When the history of
the campaign shall be written nothing in
it will be more splendid than the deeds of
the rear guards. They sacrificed them
GENERAL SMOLENTZ, THE HERO OF REVENI.
General Smolentz was, at the beginning of hostilities, the Grecian Minister of
War, but resigned his portfolio for the more active duty of the field. He was placed
in command of a division of Prince Constantine's army, consisting of 14,000 men and
charged with the duty of defending Ileveni Pa j s, three miles due west of Turnavo
How that duty was performed is attested by the eallant conduct of the jreneral and
the men under him in the battle at Ibat place on the 21st inst., when they fought for
nine hours and finally beat back a Turkish column of 30,000 men, directed by Edhem
Pasha in person, and came very near capturing that commander.
General Smolentz is a native of Greece, ami is 45 years of ace. His youth was
spent in the schools of Athens, and he afterward continued his studies in the higher
institutions of Central Europe. He entered the Greek army on his return to Athens
and was made captain of artillery, was later promoted to a colonelcy and then called to
a seat in Premier Deiyannis' Cabinet. Though he learned the art of war in the mili
jary schools, his genius for fighting was drunk in with his mother's ruilK and In tne
air of his native hills.
The Call
selves like heroes as they siowly and
mournfully fell back. The correspondent
adds that alarm and consternation pre
vail in Athens. The people meet on the
j street and sob as they discuts the news.
' The whole city is in mourning.
ATHENS, Greece. April 25.â The Greek
army which on Friday nieht began the
retreat from Larissa has been reformed on
the second line of defense at Pharsaia,
i about twenty-five miles south of the oid
[ headquarters at Larissa.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April
25. â The Sultan is so pleased with the suc
i cess of Edhem Pasha that he has be?towed
j nnon him the Nicnan-I-Imtiaz (Order of
] Merit).
SAX FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, APRIL 26, 1897.
PHARSALA AND ITS CITADEL.
The town of Pharsala to whiÂ«-.h the Greek army has retreated from Larissa is situated about twents'-rive miles south of that city on the south side of the Pharalitis
or Aikli River op the high road to Athens. It lies at the eastern beginning of the Thessalian Plain, which follows the windings of the rivers to the west around by Kar
ditza and Trikkala, and thence east aeain to Larissa and just at the north foot of a spur of the Khassiaaiari Mountains, 3370 feet high.
In the foreground of the picture is a part of the Greek army coming in on the road from Larissa, which turns to the rkht around the slight rise of the plain to the
bridge over tlie Pharalitis, which stream, though nearly dry in summer, is at this season of the year nearly bank full. To the right is the Varousi-Machalis, or Greek
quarter of the city. \Vhen under the Turks this contains a Metropolitan Church and the residence of the archbishop. In the center and to the right i 3 the quarter
formerly occupied exclusively by the Turkish population. In the rear is the Acropolis, 860 feet high, with steep sides and frowning precipices. The citadel, which
crowns it, was first built in ancient times, and then rebuilt in the middle aces. From this point the eye can reach Motora on the extreme west of the plain, Olympus to
the northeast and the intermediate stretch of hilis, Ossa to the nor-.neast, and Pelion and Mavro-Vuni to the eait, while to the south ridges and spurs of Khassiadiari,
through which winds the roart to Athens, cuts off the views of the great Arthys range, lately tne northern frontier of Greece. Two miles north of the town is the station
of the railroad from Volo to Trikkala and Kalabafc, which from here follows the river along the level plain. Pharsala had in 1890 some 2500 people, half of whom were
Turks. Since the building of the road many of these latter have left, but their places have been filled by Greets and the town has grown. Many of its buildings are of
grea: ace, but tbe town is being practically rebuilt.
Pbarsala first comes into historical mentioi: at the time of tbe Persian invasion as a wealthy and populous city, and figures notably afterward, but is most famous
as being near the great field on which Cjesar ana Pompey fought for and won and lost tne empire of the known world 48 B. C.
WASHINGTON, I). Q, April 25.â The
Turkish Minister to-nigh received the
following cablegram from his Govern
ment:
"Larissa has been occupied to-day by
the cavalry of the Ottoman army. The
Hellenic troops fled in great disorder,
abandoning huge quantities of arms and
ammunition. Tne Turkish trcop3 took
Turnavo with great quantities of arms,
ammunition, cannon and provisions. The
Helien;c soldiers who were made prisoners
were sent to Eiassona. Turnavo has been
surrounded by a military ring. The Turk
ic patrol is moving around constantly,
and taking sufficient measures to prevent
all depredations."
SET FIRE TO LARISSA.
I Cmeks Destroyed the Turkish
Quarter Before Evacuating the
Army Headquarters.
LONDON, Eng., April 25.â A dispatch
to tbe Daily Telegraph from Eiassona
states that heavy smoke can be seen over
Larlisa, and it is reported tbe Greeks,
prior to their evacuation, set fire to the
Turkish quarter.
An Athens dispatch says that before the
Greeks retired from Lanssa i hey destroyed
the bridge spanning the Peneios JLiver and
cut the railway to Volo. Everything at
the battle of Mati was against the Greeks.
They were in an exposed position; their
numbers were far less than those of tho
Turks and they bad undergone terrible fa
tigues and hardships. It is also reported
tbev suffered trom a lack of ammunition.
According to trustworthy accounts by
foreiE" witnesses of the retreat from Lar
isÃi 4000 women and children were Jeft
behind, many vainly endeavoring to de
part by train. It is stated that five Italian
volunteers forcibly entered a train, where
upon the crowd fired upon them. The
Italians returned the fire.
The correspondent records interviews
with several members of the Chamber of
Deputies, from which he deduces the days
of the Cabinet are numbered. There is
also irritation aeainst tbe King, some per
sons declaring that war is a mere stalking
horse to cover the dynastic interests. The
position of the royal family, he adds, is
most unenviable.
A royal proclamation is hourly expected.
The ministers went to the palace to-day
and demanded that an immediate change
be made in the command of the army.
The excitement increases.
No estimates of the killed and wounded
has yet been published, but Rail), leader
of the opposition, who is with the army,
describes the losses as very considerable,
lie adds the majority of the officers In tbe
foremost line were killed or wounded.
There was a panic at Piraeus, the port
of Athens, Saturday. The public had a
misunderstanding that tb* Consuls at
Volo had telegraphed to their respective
Ministers here for steamers to transport
Europeans from the city. The tocsin was
sounded, and it was with mucti difficulty
the fears of the inhabitants were calmed.
They thought an attack was to be made
upon the port by foreign warships.
VALOR OF THE GREEKS.
One Thousand Repulsed S!x Thou-
sand Turks at Pentepigadia
Pass.
LONDON, E>o., April 25.â A dispatch
to the Daily News from Arta, giving de
tails of the fighting at Pentepigad'a,
northwest of Arta, says Major Comoun
dorous, the Greek commander, was sur
prised and attacked Friday almost as soon
as he occupied the Turkish fort at the out
let of Pentepigadia PasÂ«. The Turks
numbered 6000, while the Greek force was
only 1000. The latter w&s without artil
lery, and wearied from marching two
nights and a day. Nevertheless the fight
ing wsÂ« severe for eleven hours. The
Turks charged three times, but each time
were repulsed at the point of the bayonet.
The ammunition of the Greeks was finally
exhausted, and they were compelled to
retire, losing 150 killed.
Captain Bolomos, after a great fight, was
surrounded by the Turks, but refused to
surrender wben called upou to do so. He
killed many of the enemy, who pressed
COLONEL MANOS OF THE GREEK ARMY.
He is the commander of the Greek column which pushed across the frontier at
Syrafcu, on the Arta River, just below Mount Zygas, ana is advancing toward Janina
These troops were last heard from at Pentipighadia, on the highway from Aria to
Janina, and are probably now rÂ«ry near the latter city.
i upon him on all sides, and then blew out
his brains to avoid capture. The re
mainder of the battalion returned to
Filippiada. The Turks, after killing and
mutilating the Greek wounded, retired to
Janina.
Clement Harris, an English volunteer
serving with the Greek*, was killed. It is
believed he was a son of Admiral Harris,
commanding the British Cretan fleet.
Three Greek battalions, with a battery
of artiliery.reoccupied Pentepigadia Satur
day morninp. The Turks have aban
doned Kaletzia. There is a report that
a white flag has been hoisted at Preveza,
but this is doubtful, although the place is
still blockaded by the Greeks.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turk ey. April
25.â The Sultan's Albanian Guards
failed to raise the usual cheer as the
Sultan passed to the Mosque Friday. An
inquiry elicited the information that the
troops did not think it right to raise joy
ful cries while their brothers were tight
ing on the frontier. The incident made a
bad impression on the Sultan. Subse
quently 2000 Albanians were dispatched
to the frontier v.itU Oman Pasha.
CANE A, Crkte, April 25.â The French
cruiser Bugeaud, one of the international
fleet on duty here, has gone to Salonica to
protect French interests'.
WILL GREECE WEAKEN?
Can Save Further Bloodshed by
Invoking the Intervention Eu
rope Is Ready to Afford.
LONDON, Exg., April 25.â Kritire, the
last position occupied by the Greeks on
the heights of Milouna Pass, was captured
by the Turfcs by a dexterous Hank move
ment. Tim place was defended by strong
earthworks. A dispatch from Volo an
nounces the place fell into the hands of
Moslems Saturday morning.
The Athena correspondent of the Morn-
Ing Post says during the retreat from
Lariisa Friday night there was a terrible
panic among tlie fleeing populace. Tb.B
Turkish cavalry was close behind the flee
ing army, and us<ed rifles, sabers and re
volvers indiscriminately, killing many.
In an editorial to-morrow the Times
will ask: "Will the Greeks recognize an
unalterable truth and save further bloou
shed by invoking the intervention which
Europe is so anxious to afford whenever a
demand is made? They have indicated
in a most ample manner their honor in
arms by magnificent courage and endur
ance. What ODject do they hope to gain
by prolonging the contest, which seems
destined to go decisively apainst them?
Common sense ought to induce them to
seek the ofnees of those who are prepared
to nave them from the worst consequences
of their errors. If they are hanging back
hoping their feelings will bo saved by a
spontaneous proffer of mediation, they
are suffering uader a serious misappre
hension. It is not possible for a concert
of Europe to proffer service until asked to
or until the defeat of oue side is patent.
When the powers do intervene they will
endeavor, as Greece knows, to obtain for
her the best terms compatible with the
position in which she stands. Naturally
the conditions are not so favorable after
fresh defeats as before the invaders make
further progress."
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April
25.â At a Council at Yild>z Kiosk to-day
it was decided to grant three of the berats
demanded by Bulgaria for bishops in
Macedonia. This is a partial fulfillment
of promises made by the Porte, which
have been persistently evaded Tor months.
Coincidentally the Servian Minister has
obtained an irade recalling Ambrosius, the
Greek bishop at Uskub, in favor of the
Servian prelates. In view of the insepara
bility of these questions from Balkan poli
tics, the incidents are of material import
ance.
A large number of the Greek wounded
who were at Larissa upon the evacuation,
were taken from the city urjder a flag of
the Red Cross Society.
RUSSIA AND AUSTRIA.

NEW YORK, N. V., April 25.-The
Journal's London- Berlin dispatch says the
Ta<;eblatt wili to-morrow say Russia and
Austria have reached a definite agreement
concerning Tumey. By t' is agreement
the Sultan must renounce Crete. The Czar
will be given a coaling station at Suda

Spain In Such Sorm Straits for
Money That the War Must Soon
Be Abandoned.
HAVANA, Ccba. April 25.â The war is
waging fiercely in Santa Clara province.
Near Remedies an engagement is re
rorted between Gomez and the Spanish
column of General Ruiz, lasting several
hours. The Cuban commander used
guerrilla tactics, showing the admirable
training of his troops. The Cubans separ
ated into small bands at a given order
from Gomez, harrassine the Spanish on
all sides.
Then they came together in large bodies
for cavalry attacks upon the Spaniards at
soon as Ruiz's column began 10 march.
The Spanish were greatly fatigued by
these tactics and theirj artillery was ren
dered useless. They entered Remedioi
worn out, leaving 150 dead along the line
of march. The Cuban losses were almost
insignificant.
In the bills of La Siguanea another
hard fieht is reported between the Cubans
led by Generals Quintin Banderaa and
Roban, and the combined forces of Gen
erals Montaner and Aldave. Banderas
fonght bravely, ordering the men to
charge with machetes. A hand-to-hand
fight ensued, in which the Spaniards were
obliged to retire, both sides suffering
heavy looses. General Kobau, after the
engagement, pursued the column of Gen
eral Aldave to Sancti - Spiritus and
harassed it all day, killing more than a
hundred.
In all Santa Clara the revolution is as
strong as ever, ana Weyler's report that
he has pacified the province is unfounded.
In a few days Estrada Palma, Cuuan dele
gate at New York, will receive a letter
from Colonel Nestor Aranguren, saving
the Cuban army in Havana province, with
recent re-enforcements and supplies, can
keep 30,000 Spanish regulars busy.
The Spaniards here insist that Palma
has received formal warning from McKin
ley not to violate the neutrality laws of
the United States, and now the same
statement is made on no less authority
than Senor Canovas himself.
According to La Lncba, an important
political person in the United States had
a lone interview with Palma, in which the
latter protested against any unlawful
pressura upon him and Americans and
Cubans who are aiding revolution by legal
means, but he promised at the name time
to respect the neutrality laws.
Canovas is reported as saying he is Tery
mucn pleased by the evidence of sincere

Weyler has asserted the reports of

report comes from Spanish officials of

From the same source it is learned that
Josa Fernandez ana G. Aguirre, who have
been in Cabanas prison several months,
will be released in a few days through the

nalist, and Prince Alphonse de Chimay,
brother of Prince Joseph de Chimay,
whose wife, formerly Miss Clara Ward of
Detroit, recently eloped with Janus Ripo,
the Hungarian gypsy musician. Both
men were slightly wounded.
The duel arose from an article on the

SHERMAN MAY RETIRE.
C.rcumstances Pointing to the Mental
and Physical Collapse of the Sec

NEW YORK, N. V., April 25.â A Times
Washington disDatc > says: Judge Day's
selection os Assistant Secretary of State
is beijeved to mean Sherman's early re
tirement eni Day's uromotion to tae
premiership. Tue correspondent reiter
ates the old charg s that S-ieraian's fail
ing memory renders him unfit for the
poit and declares that this has been de
monstrated 3ince his induction into office.
The dispatch continues:
"Sherman's health is precarious. He
has several times been deiained at home
when he ought to have been in i is office
busily engaged. The symptoms of col
lapse have not been absent. So delicate
has been his condition that he has done
little more since he toot office than at
tend to personal and unimportant official
matters. It has been a subject of remark
about the department that business has
come to & slot, and the condition of the
Secretary has been referred to as causing
the apparent stagnation.
"Judge Day is surprised at the chance
of programme for him. He probably
knows now why the change is made, but
there has been great delicacy at the W.iite
House about explaining iiow suddenly it
became necessary to keep him at home
instea iof sending him to Cuba. He had
purchased sieeping-car tickets for Tampa
and was arranging to leave to-night when
informed for the first time that he was to
be made Assistant Secretary.
"Here in Washington there would be
no surprise at the resi nation of Sherman
at any time. Day would then be ready to
move into the higher place at a moment's
warning, and that warning the adminis
tration is prepared to give almost any
time. In the meantime he will take
charge of all the important business be
fore the department.
"Although there is some talk about the
Pres. dent's desire to conduct the depart
ment more in cccordance with his own
views than he believes Sherman would
conduct it, it is understood that the un
easiness of the President is not on account
of any departure from the policy he had
marked out, bui rather on account of his
concern lest the ill health and increasing
Infirmity of the Secretary would render
him incapable of carrying out any policy
at all."

AERIAL NAVIGATION
HAS BEEN SOLVED
At Least That Is What
Case Is Said to
Have Done.
Desires Space to Exhibit His
Invention at the Omaha
Exposition.
The Man Who Has Been Sailing an
Airship in That Vicinity
Heard From.
OMAHA, Nebr., April 25.â A month
ago the directors of the Trans-Mississippi
Kxposition received a note signed "A. C.
Clinton" requesting an option on grouna
sufficient to fly an airship uaily from the
exposition grounds. The writer admitted
that it was not his own name, but de
clared he was the man who had been Bail
ing an airship in this locality recently
and explaining that he desired to conceal
his identity temporarily.
It caused much comment and an inves
tigation was instituted. It has resulted
in the development that Clinton A. Case
is probably the inventor. Case is an in
ventor by nature and a violin-maker by
necessity. He went to Kansas City some
time since. Before going be exhibited his
invention under a pledge of secrecy to
Alva J. Grover, the well-known civil en
gineer of Omaha. Case had evidently
signed his name backward to tne commu
nication addressed to tne exposition di
rectors. The truth was made public
through Grover. Some time before leav
ing Oniaba Case exhibited to Grover the
plans of the vehicle designed for navigat
ing the air, together With the drawings of
a propelling engine, the lite of Thich the
engineer had never before seen.
After a caref ai study of the blue prints
of Case's machine Grover declared him
self of the opinion that an airship or
aeroplane bnilt upon those lines would be
able to navigate the air, providing resist
ance to air currents and steering gear were
in relative proportion to the lifting capa
city of the plane. A remarkable feature
of this air navigator was the propelling
engine, which, owing to the construction
of the plane, must of necessity combine
great power within small space. Case's
plans showed that after the first 300
pounds of weight every horsepower could
be secured by each additional three- pound
weicht of engine, the whoJe power for
carrying ISOO pounds could be secured
within the space of an ordinary office
desk. Naphtha was to be used instead of
coal, being easily carried in tanks at the
bottom of the plane.
Ihe plane itself, of an entirely original
design, was the result of many years, ex
perimenting. Its framework was to be of
bamboo, which the inventor had found
to be the strongest as well as lightest
material known. Th rty-foot wings of
bamboo covered with silk extended out
ward and downwaid on each side of the
body of the ship, the latter having some
what the appearance of a boat's keel,
tapering upward toward the front. The
propeller at the rear was like an ordinary
steamship's screw with the exception that
the biades were long and tapering and
made of aluminum. At the bottom of the
si)ip on each side wheels were placed,
which assisted in starting the plane, and
they were also to be utilized when alight
ing.
Case tried to interest Omaha capita! in
his invention, but at a time of financial
depression and when moneyed men were
very careful how they placed investments,
so the inventor left the city with the
avowed purpose of building his airship
himself in his native Missouri town. Iv
speaking of the invention of Case Engineer
G rover said:
"When Case first came to see me I had
an idea he was one of those visionary per
sons whose theories are based on the
amount of a busy man's time they can
consume, but as I looked into his plans I
became convinced that Case was a man of
no ordinary caliber. 1 advised him to
make duplicate drawings and send them,
with explanations, to Professor Roland of
Johns Hopkins University, Maxim, the
well-known experimenter in aerial naviga
tion, and the chief of the balloon corps of
the United State 3 army. He did bo and
received replies from all three. Maxim
claimed Case's invention to be nothing
new in principle, while the replies of the
others were of a most encouraging nature.
Especially so was / that of Professor
Roland, who is the highest authority on
aerial navigation on this side of the At

BRYAN ASSA/LS CLEVELAND.
Denounces the Ex- President's Aspersions
on McKmley in His Rsform
Club Speech.
NEW YORK, N. V.. April 25. -William
J. Bryan, in a signed telegram to the
Journal, severely criticizes Cleveland's
Reform Club speech. After denouncing
the ex-Pres dent's aspersions on|McKinley
as unfair, be continues:
McKinley won political fame as the
apostle of high tariff and during the late
campaign he reiterated his devotion to
this policy. Those Democrats who voted
for McKinley voted with their eyes open.
Neither have those Democrats reason
to complain of McKinley's attitude
on the money question. Unless the gold
Democrats were in possession of assurances
not given to the public generally, they
ought to li â  satisfied with bis finan
cial policy. He promised to maintain the
gold standard until relief comes from
abroad, and he is doing it, despite the
continued distress caused by such a
policy.
"The important part of Cleveland's ad
dress, however, is found in his declaration
of war against those who supported the
Chicago ticket. In this he has given more
aid to his opponents than to his support
ersâjust as he did by his official acts.
His surrender of the executive branch of
the Government into the hands ot Wall
street during the last administration aid
more than any other thing to arouse the
American people to a knowledge ot the
iniquity of the gold standard. His thinly
disguised support of the Republican
ticket in the last campaign did inucu to
drive silver Republicans out of the Repub
lican party, ana their loyalty to bimetal
lism Las not been shaken by defeat.
"In his address of Saturday he aided
the silver cause still further by removing
whatever danger there might have been
of concessions from the regular Democrats
to the bolters. The gold Democracy is
impotent to bring any relief to the coun
try; it is long on platitudes and short on
performance; it reaches its maximum at
a banquet and its minimum at the polls;
it is the toy of those financiers who prate
about National honor while they fatten on
the Nation's extremity, and it is power
less to protect the people lrom the extor
tion of trusts and the greed of unrestrained
corporations."

COPENHAGEN, Denmark, April 25.â
The Dannebrog prints an interview with
King George, in which bis Majesty as
scribes the defeat of the Greek army to
the overwhelming number of the Turks,
whose forces were constantly augmented
by fresh re-enforcements. According to
the Dannebrog the King declared toe en
tire Thessalian frontier had been aban
doned. Fortifications and cannon at
Larissa were abandoned. The army will
now concentrate at I'iiarsala, where it will
be re-enforced by all the volunteers in
Thessaly and will show a strong front to
the enemy. The King said in concussion
that all bridges and railways had been de
stroyed in order 10 cut off any hope of re

AID FOR THe GREEKS.
Julia Ward Howe Says the Women
of Massachusetts Will Make
Contributions.
BOSTON, Mass., April 25.â "1 quite
dread taking up the newspapers in the
morning now. I feel perfectly sure that
the Greeks ou^'ht to succeed," said Julia
Ward Howe to-day, "but it does seem that
the odds against them are almost per
fectly insurmountable. But then the
Turkish Government may not bo so
strong as imagined. I know that the
Greeks are desperate fighters. I think it
very extraordinary what the Greeks ha7e
been able to do so far, very extraordinary.
I don't think they could have helped
going to war. People who talk about
autonomy for Crete don't know how the
Turks do such things. If autonomy were
accepted affairs would soon be back again
a* they were before.
"it is a very wonderful fight that the
Greeks have so far been able to make, ana
1 believe that their situation will be ulti
mately improved by it. Our own civil
war was no easy victory. It was an awful
fight. For months and years no one Knew
how it was coming out. I feel thai way
about Greece. Greece is right and is
bound to stand as she does. The war is
interesting to us as members of Christen
dom. It seems incredible that the powers
should allow such a war as this to con
tinue. I: some one nad come to us before
this war and said that they would permit
it we would have said that it was impossi
ble. I remember that the late General
Walker, v, Wen talking with me rUht in
this room, -aid : 'The great Western
powers can't be low enough to try to im
pede the action of Greece in an effort to
secure freedom for Cretes.' I have great
faith that they may conquer. I know
thai they ought to.
"It is very curious that in their previous
war it was help from America which
caused its consummation. So I think
that if we could only help them ior a
time there may come something not now
anticipated whicu may give them suc
cess. Among ihe women here there is
surely something that will enable the
women ol Massachusetts to answer the
appeal of the women of Greece. I have
already got something for their aid and I
hope to get more. I think that the meet
ing will be held next week. Quite a sum
of money has already teen telegraphed
abroad by tlie committee here, and they
have more, which may be eeut or they
may decide to send a vessel."
Dr. Samuel G. Howe, late husband of
Mrs. Howe, was very conspicuous in aid
ing the Greeks and Cretans in the previ
ous war and she accompanied him.

SACRAMENTO WINS THE RELAY.
Stockton Ttamt Beaten by Capital City
Wheelmen in ihe Hundred-
M.le Race.
STOCKTON, Cal.. April 25.-The bi
cycle relay race between teams from Stock
ton and Sacramento was run to-day, and
tbo Capital City wheelmen carried off all
the honor?, Captain Robert Siniih of that
team reaching Stockton first on the last
relay, making the time of the Sacr imento
boys lor the 100 miles from Stockton to
the capitai city and return 5:08:20. Ed
Crump of the Stockton Road Club came
in next, the time for that team being
5:14:47. T c Terminal City wheelmen
wer* next, A. E. HeÂ»lj coming in tnird,
with 5:15:21 as the time for the club.
Fred McKain, of the Stockton Athletic
Association, was the Inst to give hiÃ
packet to the judges, tbe time for the
Athletic boys being 5:23:55.
The start was made in front of the
Courthouse in this city. The men went
off to a tine start and the pace on tbe first
relay, ten miles, was a hot one. The men
from Sacramento soon demonstrated that
they wer.t the better riders and were well
a cad when tbe first relay was ended. The
Stockton Koad Clnb set tbe Capital City
men a hot pace and were only 6 minutes
and 27 seconds behind on the race.
The great fi^ht was between the Stock
ton Road Ciuo and the Terminal City
Wheelmen, and the latter orsanization
has entered a protest at being put in third
place, claiming that A. Bonzi of the Road
Club deliberately fouled Barnes of the
Terminal Citvs. Barnes* wheel was
damaged, but be got up and rode a plucky
race.
The only serious accident occurred
when Sabe Gist of the Terminal City team
took a header and bis trader ran over him.
Gist ruptured a Dlood vessel in his chest,
but insisted on riding his return relay.
He worked so hard that it caused a
hemorrhage, and the plucky boy is now in
the doctor's care. W. Hansel and Oito
Salbach did the fastest work for tbe
Terminal City men, the former cutting
the lead of Leach of the Capita ICity
Wheelmen down two minutes, while Sai
bach did about the same with the lead
Lswis Payen of the same club had.
Hundreds turned out to witness the fin
ish in Stockton, and this city was tilled
with wheelmen all day. The race has
been the exciting topic with all the cyclers
here for months, and all the riders trained
faithfully for the contest, which was for
the Weinstock-Lubin cup. It must be
won three limes before it becomes the
property of any ciub, and the Sacramento
Wheelmen have won it twice.
KLAMATH TO BE CAMPAIGNED.
Despite Tficmas W. Raymond's Will, the
Horse Hay Start on Eastern
Tracks.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 25.âNot
withstanding the fact that the late
Thomas W. Raymond made it a part of
his last will and testament that Klamath
should never be raced again, it is probable
that the "little bay demon" may again
be seen in many a hot finish. It is stated
in Santa Ana that tbe horse has already
been entered in a number of races in Colo
rado and farther east, and that it is the
iateni'.on of Mr. Judd to campaign him
this season. Kiamath is in good condi
tion now, and almost any day can go out
on the track and pass the quarter post iv
30 or 31 seconds.
Mr. Judd could not be seen to-day, but
the fact that the horse has been entered
in the East is considered evidence that it
is the intention of his owner to race him.
It is claimed now that Judd has a bill of
sale for Klamath and that this instrument
was filed with the County Recorder of
Orange County many months before the
last will and testament of Raymond was
made.

STOCKTON, Cal., April 25.â Philip
Rohrbacher, a wei^known resident of
bun Francisco, dropped dead in the
Commercial Hotel in this city from heart
disease this afternoon.
For years K.'hrbacner lived in S'ockton,
having ee-.tled here in 1*55. He con
ducted a saloon on Main street and accu
mulated considerable wealth. Early in
the '80's he left Stockton to engage in the
brewery business, and was as successful
in this as he was in his othtr ventures.
He was one of the founders of the Wil
lows Brewery.
Mr. Rohroacher, who was president of
the Dumbarton l.an 1 and Improvement
Company and interested for the Pab.n
Brewing Company, had been to Lodi on

place and was in the large waitinc-room
of the Commercial Hotel, when he sud

His brother, Henry Kohrbacher of this
city, was out drivng at the time and could
not be found for sume lime, and the
friends of both were afraid to convey the
information to the home of Henry Rohr
bacher, as the latter* daughter is very ill.
He was finally found and took charge of

Philip Rohrbacner was well known in
this City and wa? connected with a num

to the United Slates from Germany, his
native country, when quite yoniig. and
after remaining in Stockton for a number
of years he came to this City and engaged
in business, in which for many years he
was very successful.
In addition to being interested in the
Dumbarton land company, hÂ«* was, up to
a year ago, president of the Bay Distil

He was a member of the Masonic

number of German benevolent and social

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, APRIL 26, 1897.
THE CITY OF YREKA.
Prepared for "The Call" by ItÂ« Mayor.
YREKA, Cal., April 23.â Nature did
much for Yreka before man and his works
were known iv the land. The site is the
most p;cr resquely beautiful to be found
In tne northern mountain land of Califor
nia. The ending mountains gather the
town in loving embrace and protect it
from all but gentle breezes, and the
numerous passes and low swells make in
gre-s easy in ail directions.
Standing on the hillside above the town
in summer it gleams restlul and clean
from Ita masses of leaves. There is not a
town in the State that c-n &how a grander
array of shade trees. Great wide-spread
inc locusts and cottonwood border the
residence streets, shading the walks, and
in the yards stand giant pear and app.e
trees, beautiful through the summer and
a treasure-house in the fall, for who does
not know the fame of Siskiyou fruit?
Long, long ago, as we measure time in
our young State, when the surface ground
wa- 1 lull of gold, there came miners to the
valleys of Siskiyou who saw a good site
for a camp in our little vale, then green
with oaks and pines, and here they
stayed. Tne gold panned out well, and
the camp grew into a thriving town named
Yreka; and what the odd name means
and how we came to get it is not kuuwn.
Whether it is of Indian origin or the re
sult of a man's baa handwriting makes
no difference â ;t is a good name.
After the stirring "early days" the
placer mines rather "played out," and
Yreka was a very quiet place, which if it
didn't go down hill in progress at least
made no advance. In twenty years
scarcely as many houses were built There
were no new industries, the mines were
fewer, the farmers had iittle to encourage
them, and there was the long, rough stage
ride to Redoing to appal the traveler, but
Yreka wouldn't die.
It wan the county seat and the center of
trade for a tract larger than tho State of
Massachusetis.
Then the railroad came and passed by
on the other side, seven miles away,
planting little towns all along to be the
rivals of Yr^ka. This was the last straw,
and tue people awoke to the knowledge
that the inhabitants make the town.
They built a branch road of their Very
own to connect witii the main iine and
then they began to boom their sturdy lit
tle town in the best possible wayâ by
spending money on and in it.
An old Yrekan built an electric plant on
the river below town and the dark streets
became light and the smell of kerosene
disappeared from the business h uses.
Then some of the richer people tore down
the bouses they had been living in since
the "Ma and put up modern and beautiful
homes.
The first two or three proved such a sac
cess that others and still others began to
look with disfavor upon their squatty lit
tle box houses, and behold soon there
came an architect and builder to locate
here. He has never gone away and two
more have come. House after house has
been built, some ot them mansions fit to
crown the hills of San Francmco's fash
ionable quarter*. Ail over the flats above
town li â  tie homes have sprune, and on the
southern suburbs in the fields where chil
dren used to gather wild violets are pretty
cottages and green yards. One improve
ment calls for another, and the new
houses demanded lawns instead of brown
earth. A new water company supple
raÂ«nted the supply of the o d, making
grass and fl -wers grow as by magic and
completing the beauty of the great trees
aiid pretty homes.
The wheheads began to question why
so much of our money and talent went
away to cities, and the result was the
large and beautiful high-school building
which looks down from its hill. With the
high school came ecores of amilie- from
outside to settle where thsir children
could have such advantages, and there
were no vacant houses in Yreka. There
are none now. Building lots command
hijih prices, and every shed and shack
that is habitable rents for a good price.
The wisebeads were next shaken in dis
approval at the dingy courthouse, all too
small for the business done in it, and now
in the locust-shaded part we see a fine
gray building, large and substantial
enough for the coming time when Yreka
ah li have doubled its population.
People discovered that Sislciyou apples
had no equal and they began to come for
them, with the inevitable result. New
orchards are springing up all over the land
and Yieka is the shipping point. Cream
eries and ice plants made their appear
ance, bringing more trade and increased
prosperity to the county seat. Mines in
every direction were reopened, capital
invested and more new people were
brought in.
Yreka has never during the pa^t season
of depression made any complaint of hard
times. There are no unemployed, except
those born with a prejudice against work,
Mid some of them in the chain pant, have
done eood street work for their board and
lodging.
Business hou es hays enlnTve:! and in
creased. M.uÂ«r street, Uic business
thoroughfare, has new walks, several new
buMdings and a general weil-to-do air.
And the outlook is excellent. During
'97 we saall see a greater number of new
dwe lings erected than any one year has
shown us. The builders smile as they
work on their plans and the merchants
smile as th -y see the builders pa*s. More
mine* are to be opened, and the grocer
looks pleasant aa in h.a mind's eye he
sees his delivery wagon making its trips
up an>i down the river three time? a week
aud Ids order-books grow full and he has
to hire another clerk.
The fame of the clean, quiet, prosperous
and beautiful town as a summer resort
has gone abroad and larger and lamer
numbers of tourists stay the balmy sum
mer month? with us.

debtedness. There are a number of line

LAWLESSNESS ON THE CLONDYKE.
Rough Characters Attempt to Drive Alas
kan Miners From Their
Claims.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 25.â Serious
trouble is believed to be brewing on the
Clondyte River, Alaska. A private letter
has just been received from a former Vic
toria merchant, now owner of one of the
richest Clondyke claims, who writes that
Canadian claim-owners will probably be
compelled to use guns to defend their
property against unscrupulous Americans,
who believe that in that far-off country
British law can be s*t at defiance.
The writer continues that Circle City
has long been infestea by tough charac
ters, surne of whom are fugitives from jus
tice. When the only discovered placer
grounds were in the vicinity of Circle City,
these men were very jeaious about their
rights, and protested against Canadians
talcing claims in American territory,
where twenty acres ara allowed for a
placer claim.
"When the discoveries were made on the
Clondyke Inspector Constantine of the
ruounteu police, who acts for tne Domin
ion Government, al.owed each ciaim
owner to stake off only six acres, for regis-
ferine which he charged $15, three times
tne ordinary fee.
Rich strikes were soon made, and when
the news readied Circle City many of the
rough element crossed over into Canadian
territory. A few began prospecting for
themselves, but most of the rough charac
ters claimed that the rich grouna had all
been staked off. They began clamoring
that too much land bad been allowed for
each claim, and boldly intimated that un
less the resident authorities decreased the
size of the claims they would use force.
Both roughs and miners are well armed
and when The letter was written a clash
in winch guns were certain to be used was
expected daily. Without regard to the
fabulous richness of their claims, the
miners believe they are justified in bold
ing six acres apiece. They are fully pre
pared to resist any encroachments and
will be backed by the police.
It is claimed there are plenty of other
streams yet vn prospected, if the roughs
are willing to work. Hope is general on
the Clon tyke that toe American Govern
ment will soon send police officers to the
Yukon to restrain the lawless characters.

Mexico buys aDout $8,000 000 worth of

Joe Jefferson is growing old. but he an

The Governments of Europe sympathize
with Turkey dimply because they do not
know how to divide her up. If they could
once agree on the division the ardor with
which they would enter upon a war for

After taking a second, third and fourth
thought on the subject, Chicago is set
tling down to the conclusion that the
reason why Carter Harrison was elected

father was a great Mayor.
There will be a strong fight made to se
cure in the new tariff apron ye duty on

Bhould assist the cattle States in making
it. It is said the value of American cattle
decreased $60,000,000 under the Wilson
tariff, and in the new bill something
Bhould be done to restore the loss.
In 1817 the Turks possessed 218,600
square miles of European territory, but
this has been reduced by successive wars
and treaties to 81,200 square miles, and
still there are statesmen in Europe who
talk of the preservation of the Turkish
empire as if it had never been despoiled
in the past and should not be in the
fnture.
Jerry Simpson's attempt to organize an

Young Bailey has not made a very effect

It would be difficult to say how large
might hare been the number of persons
taking part in the parade at the dedica

if an arbitrary limit had not been fixed by
the officials in charge. It is said that over

the procession before the committee de

time ago.
It is proposed in Vienna to hold this
year some sort of celebration of the cen
tennial anniversary of the meerschaum
pipe. It waa in 17^7 that the first pipe of
that kind was made, and since then there
has been no little artistic skill employed
in the manufacture. The work of some of
the meerÂ«chaum artists is worth many
times us weight :n gold, and this fact,
taken in connection with the delight
which men have found in such pipes,
seems to justify the proposed celebration!
Despite the fact that the vote on the
Vest resolution seemed to show that tne
majority of the Senate was favorable to
tt,e reiroactive clause of the Dingley
tar:ff, ;t is now said the clause may be
stricken out because of the threat of ob
structive tactics on the part of the Demo
crats if its adoption is insisted on. It ia to
be reeretted that there should be any un
certainty on this point, and in some way
the Senate should speedily make known
to the country just what is to be done
about it on the linal vote.

THE SENATE AND THE TARIFF.
Complaints are being made in many quarters concerning the slowness with which
the Finance Committee of the Senate is performing the work of revising the tariff
lull. These complaints are the outcome of a natural desire on the part of men en
gaged in commerce anil industry to put an end to the uncertainty of the situation and
have it clearly established under what terms our trade is to be carried on in the im
mediate future. It is inevitable that this impatience should be felt, but it is never
theless ill-founded, inasmuch as it results from an inconsiderate view of the situ
ation.
It is not an easy task to adjust a tariff that will be equally fair ftnd beneficial to
all the varied industries of a country so large and so diversified as the United States.
The task in the present instance is rendered more difficult by reason of the necessity
of arranging tariff rates so that they will sapply a revenue to tha Government suf
ficient for its needs and at the same time afford an adequate protection to all the in
dustries of the people.
The Dingley bill, ai reported from the House, is an excellent measure in the
main, but has some defects which should be removed before iti enactment into law.
The Senate is charged with the duty of making the necessary revision. That body is
much better fitted than the House to deal with matters of this kind. It represents
alt the States equally, most of its leaders have served for a long time and are familiar
with the interests of their States and the Nation generally; their discussions are less
stormy and excited than those of the House ; and It is altogether right that more time
for deliberation and tiebate should be taken by the Senate than would be advisable in
tho other branch of Congress.
The people of California and the greater West generally have good reason for be
ing gratified that the bill has not been rushed through in the Senate. We have large
interests that require a fuller degree of protection than the Dingley bill in its present
Bbape affords. There 13 ample evidence to justify a b;lief that this protection will be
given in the measure as it will be reported from the Finance Committee, and we there
fore will have profited much from that very deliberation and apparent slowness of
which so much complaint has been made.
It must not bo supposed that the Finance Committee is engaged in tearing the bill
all to pieces. All reports from Washington give assurance that the alterations will be
few and of a conservative character. There is, of course, a strong pressure from the
free-traders to bring about a great reduction in the rates of several schedules, but this
pressure Is more ttan counteracted by that of the earnest and vigilant protectionists
who are seeking to revise the measure in the direction of giving more instead of less
support to American industry.
"We can reasonably expect that the bill as revised by the Senate will give a fuller
protection to California fruits and raisins, to wool, and will add a duty on hides, which
will materially benefit the cattle-growers. We stand, therefore, a chance to gain much
and run comparatively little risk of losing anything. Much the same may be said of
all other sections of the Union. The Senate, therefore, is serving the public interests
in making haste slowly. The matter is not one that can be hurried. The country it
is true needs a rest irom tariff legislation, but it cannot have that rest until such
legislation has been permanently Â«ettled by being settled right.
EUROPEAN ALLIANCES.
The new alliances which are evidently
being shaped among the nations of Eu
rope will be better founded than those
which have prevailed in recent years, and
promise, therefore, to be more permanent
and more beneficial to the nations making
them. Europe has been fora long time in
a condition of instable equilibrium, and
now seems to be settling down upon a
basis broader and better tnan ever before.
The alliance between Germany. Austria
and Italy, which was formed to maintain
the peace ot Europe after the Franco-
Prussian war, was in its very nature unre
liable and temporary. That it was not
highly regarded even by Bismarck, who
made it, has been shown by the recent
revelations that at the very time when
tha alliance was first launched Bismarck
had reached a secret understanding
with Russia and was negotiating a sep
arate alliance Between Germany and that
country.
The attempt at an alliance between
France and Russia was even more futile
than the Dreibund. The French entered
ujion it more from a desire to have some
means ot counterbalancing the alliance of
the three other powers of Europe than
from any identity of interests between
France and Russia. About the only point
on which those two countries could have
ac.ed together would have been a de
mand for the evacution of E^ypt by Eng
land. This, however, was something
which, while ardently demanded in
France, was a matter of comparative in
difference In Russia, and even on that
point, therefore, the alliance was ne?er
strong enough to be a material factor in
the problem of the European balance of
power.
The new alliance between Germany, I
Russia and Austria will be of a different
nature. Tuere are many reasons why the
Gear and the Kaiser ehould join forces,
and not a few wuy the Austrian Emperor j
should join them. The (Governments of
all three of these powers are more or less
antagonistic to the growing liberalism of j
the people uf Western Europe, and it is i
natural that they should combine to- j
gether in order to more effectively with
stand the tendencies of the age. They ,
have no geographical cauÂ«es for dispute, j
and there seems no reason why the j
alliance they have formed may not be as
permanent as any international agree
ment can ever become.
On the other side an alliance of Eng
land, France and Italy Beams to offer as
many advantages to those countries as
will be gained by the opposing powers
from their alliances. England and
France Dave long been enemies, but at
the present time they have no cause for
antagonism except some disputes over
the boundaries of their African colonies.
These disputes are slight in comparison
with the much greater benefits they may
expect to gain from a firm alliance with
one another against the aggressive com
bination of Russia, Germany and Austria.
Events now in progress in Greece may
â¢oon force them to act together in war,
either ior the preservation of Greece or
else for securing to the people of the
Balkan States their rightful share of the
division of the falling Ottoman empire.
CONDITION OF TEADE.
From the commercial point of view the
State is evidently working into better
shape. This does not appear so much on
the surface as in the undercurrent. It is
too gradual to be observed by the general
ran of people. But that there is a real
improvement in the situation is apparent
to those whose business interests lead
them closest to the center of trade activ
ity. It may not be amiss to survey those
improved conditions in detail.
The bank clearings form the best ba
rometer of trade, as they show the volume
of business. When times are dull they
lose, when times are active they gain. For
several weeks these clearings have been
caining, and last week the increase was
over 9 per cent. This In itself is a pretty
good indication of the trend of the tide-
Then there is the rapid advance in wheat,
which rose from $1 30 to $1 42}^ during
the week, and carried up with it barley
and oats. The advance was due to toe
European war and poorer crop prospects
in several wheat-producing countries, ae
gravaled by a hot north wind all over the
Btate. Wheat, at say $1 40, is a profitable
crop as conditions are nowadays, and if
the price will stay there the great valleys
of California will do very well this year.
High wheat means Letter prices for hay,
which ia a great stspie in California, so
the hay farmers are takine a more hope
ful view of things. Wool, too, has been
remarkably active of late and enormous
purchases hare been made.
Fruit prospects ure flattering us far as
tbe volume of the output ia concerned,
and, with the exception of ono or two
varieties, the crop promises to be heavy.
The stock of dried fruit is running low,
and dealers expect to see it all cleaned up
by the time the new crop cornea forward,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 26, 1897.
which will help the dried-frnit interest
Thus it will be seen that the great staples
are on a highly fnvorable footing.
Money is plentiful for commercial bor
rowers at the usual rates of interest. City
collections are satisfactory, but country
collections are somewhat slow. Failures
are few and small as a rule. These de
tails show business in general to be on a
good sound footing. Only one thing is
needed to make times really lively, and
that is the tariff. Until we get it con
iiinons will not ba apt to show much im
provement. Everybody is waiting for it.
All through the Eastern States, from New
York to the Rocky Mountain*, business is
in a state of suspense pending the final
passage of the bill. While it hangs fire
anil its ultimate fate is more or less uncer
tain trnde drags. Manufacturers are cau
tious about opening their mills, and im
porters hardly know what to do. Mer
chants are all at sea whether to stock up
or not. Farm products languish because
nobody knows what they will be worth
when the bill is finally passed, and so it
eoes.
In spite of this great drawback, now
ever, there is, as has been said, a slow im
provement In trade all over the country.
Everybody is agreed that some sort ol a
tariff bill will eventually go into force,
and this in usell bsgets confidence in the
future. Meanwhile we are better off ttian
we have been under the low tariff, and
even this improvement is not to be de
spised.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.
Now that the question of the extension
of trade into South America is being dis
cussed by our business men it will be well
to give attention to information on the'
subject furnished by the National Asso
ciation of Manufacturers, with head
quarters at Philadelphia. A recent publi
cation by that body affords convincing
evidence that there is a great undeveloped
field for the enterprise of our merchants
in all sections of that country.
Among the points brought out in the
publication it will be well to note a piece
of advice given by one of the members of
the association, Mr. William Harper of
Philadelphia. Beware, he says of treat
ing small orders as if they were insigni
ficant They must be regarded for the
potency in them for future development.
They like the small sack of seed which
by repeated sowings through several
seasons may produce a great crop.
The foreign buyer, if he is a good busi
ness man, will be apt to order cautiously
at first. Treat the little order courteously,
carefully, not so much for what it is as for
the latent possibilities in it. The Ger
mans, who are rightly held up to us as
models in the art of great conquests In
commerce, treat the little orders as pre
cious acquisitions. They are not experi
menters. Their success has proved their
wisdom.
Mr. Charles A. Schieren of New York,
who has thoroughly studied foreign trade
methods and whose firm does a great deal
i of exporting, compares Germany's rapid
[ advance in tho markets of the world to
those marvelouMy well-planned military
1 movements of 1870, which astonished the
| world with the swift success in which her
; thoroughly disciplined armi*s executed
them. We must adopt similar methods if
we would achieve similar success. If our
! South American trade is to be developed
into a vast commerce we must be careful
i at the beginning not to despise the day of
: small things.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
There were deaths from accidents in the
British navy last month oa three ships at
tached to the Channel squadron. One, a
stoker, was killed by an explosion; two sea
men were suffocated by sleeping in an air
tight compartment and two boatmen and a
surgeon were drowned.
, France is bunding live triple-screw battle
ships, named in order of state of completeness
as follows: Massena. Bouvet, Charlemagne,
Su Louis and Gaulois. They are of about
12,000 tons displacement and are to have a
speed oi 17}_ knots. Three triple screw
cruisers, named the Jeanno d'Arc, Guicheu
and Chateau- Renault, are also in course of
construction. Their speed is to be about 22
knots.
The fatal bursting of a torpedo on the Brit
ish cruiser Theseus, at Multa, March 23, wns
caused by a tackle breaking and the torpedo
fell to the deck with such force that the com

two petty officers, inflicting injuries which
necessitated amputation ot a leg of each man.
One of the men dieJ the same night. The
court of inquiry found the acci'lent duo to
the defective tackle, winch hud decayed
through dry rot.
The British Admiralty is at last recognizing
the importance of etenm engineering in the

Commencing with the new fiscal year Mr.
Dur.it.in, the engineer-in-chief, will receive
$9000 per anuum. instead of $6500, as paid
hitherto. The chief engineer inspector will
receive an increase of $095, and two others
$350 and S.SO respectively Talent and
responsibility are much Higher paid in the
British navy than in ours, for whereas the
director of naval construction and the engi
neer-in-chief get a salary ol $12,500 and
$9000 respectively, our chief constructor and
the engineer-in-chlef receive only $5000.

The chickens did not touch the young plants; they did not scratch the ground; they only ate

HOW MODERN WARS I EGiN
New York Hnn.
The assertion of the Porte is that Greek
troops Invaded Turkish territory without
warning and that war existed without a
formal declaration of it from Athens.
Such a statement, be it observed, however
founded, does not at all settle the question as
to the relative decrees of merit in the Greek
and the Ottoman causes, but it furnishes a
striking illustration of how small a part the
mere form of a declaration of war may play in
modem times and how little reliance can be
placed on having time for planning either de
fense or agjtression after it comes.
A report from a committee of Congress has
compiled statistics on this Bubject, derived,
we believe, from European sources. Without
recording wars against barbarous or semi
barba.ous countries, it finds that nearly or
quite every leading power in Europe has at
times waged war without declaring it. Not to
ko into details, it found that '"from 1700 to
1871, inclusive, loss than ten instances have
occurred in which declarations of war have
preceded hostilities; on the other hand, 107
cases were recorded in which hostilities have
been begun by Europe or by the United States
of America, without previous declaration of
war." The most noteworthy case ar-cribed to
our own country Is tho resolution <^f May 13,
18-1(5, in which Congress, instead of declaring
war agÃinst Mexico, declared that war already
existed, as the result of Mexican aggressions,
which President I'olk's message had recited.
Indeed, when war seems to be almost inevi
table it ib easy to understand bow, apart from
chance collisions between armies of observa
tion, the advantage of the initiative may lead
to hostile acts. That the movements ot the
Greek irregulars several days ago were di
rected upon strategic points was perfectly
obvious.
bo far us we are concerned the lesson taught
by the rapidity with which events have fol
lowed in Thessaly and the actual beginning of
hodiililies between Greece and Turkey when
all the great powers of Europe apparently had
the desire to keep them apart is that prepara
tion lor defense must not be delayed until war
is threatened, and still lets in order to see
whether war will really be declared. The dis
covery that "war exists" Is very apt to take
the place â¢>> a formul declaration thereof.
REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Last Week Was a Fairly
Good One for Realty
Business.
Circumstances That Tend to
Foster Property Matters
Multiplying Daily.
The Southwest Corner of Powell and
Ellis Streets to Bs So d at

The week has been a fairly good one for
realty business. Inquiry is developing more
generally and trading is becomin? of a moro
positive character. There Is nothing in the
immediate situation to indicate the proba

give additional impetus to everything asso
ciated with land operations, whether in town
lots or in suburban acres.
Probably the most important auction sale

SPREADING THE LIGHT.
Lessons of Love, of Truth and of Piety
Preached From Many Pulpits*
AT THE First Baptist Church Rev.
M. r. Boynton's text was Luke
xxiii:42-43â "And he said, Jesus, re
member me when thou comeÂ«t into thy
kingdom. And he said unto him, Verily,
I say unto thee to-day sbalt thou f>e with
me in Paradise." Mr. Boynton said:
Life's laÂ«i hour is last in more senses
than in point of time. Last in thought
and in purpose.
The last hour of Jesus' life was full of
manifestation of divinity. No coronation
of a king was ever so grand. la the
world's sight it seemed an hour of defeat ;
the cross a sign of ignominy: the cry,
"\\ hy hast tbou forsaken me?" despair;
the shout, "It is finished," retreat. How
deceived was the world ! The lifting of the
cross was the raising of an emblem that
should shine in every clime, be seen in all
the earth and known as the mark of
highest divinity and of most loving
fatherhood.
The lament, "Has thou forsaken me?"
was the interpretation oi Gtd come down
to bury the 6ius of all mankind. The
shout, "It is finished," the cry that has
echoed around the world and lingers as a
halo about God's throne. After his resur
rection many said, "Rabboni," but in the
darkness of Calvary there was only one to
say "Lord," and he a poor, dying thief.
The world demanded that Christ should
come down from the cross to prove him
self the son of God. He would do no such
sign, but would work a greater thing and
prove more eternally his >fessiah*hh>. He
would save, not himsels, but another, and
one of the most eieaant trophies that
Christ took with him as an evidence of
his mission fulfilled was the glorified be
ing wi.o entered tne uplifted caies at his
s.de; who in the midst of the agony on
the cross had saii, "Lord, reraemoer me."
The Roman power could take away Jeans'
raiment, they could cast lots for his coat,
MANY BURGLARIES
ON THE FRONT
The Office of the Tiburon
Ferry Broken Into and
Robbed.
A Second Attempt to Loot the
Southern Pacific Office
Failed.
Corinthian Yachtsmen Held Their
First Cruise of the Season
Yesterday.
Water front burglars are still paying
tbeir attention to tÂ£>e various ticket offices
used by ilie ferry companies. Although
each agent is provided with a burglar
alarm, connected with toe Harbor Police
Station, still the bareiars do not scare
worth a cent. Last night or early this
morning the office of the ban Francisco
and >>"orth Pacific was entered and $'0
taken from the change drawer. It was
said that an attempt was made on the
office safe, but this is denied by Agent
Megrain. An investigation made yester
day morning showed that the tick"t win
dow had been broken and a boy passed
through. The lad then evidently opened
the door and let the thieves in.
A couple ol hours later the robbers made
a descent upon the office of the Southern
Pacitic at the ferries. 'While one man was
working at the ticket window another
tried to gain admit'.ance through the
door. The night bookkeeper heard the
men at work and gave the alarm. The
thieves heard him moving about and de
camped before the police showed up.
Haif a dozen vessels have been robbed
during the pa^t week and the thieves
beeni to be gaining confidence. Tney
must be experts, as on many occasions
they have entered tne cabins of the ves
te.3 and rilled the pockets of of liters who
were asleep in their bunks.
Tne travel over the bay was unusually
heavy yesterday, the bulk of it going to
the country via the Tiburon ferry. The
Kniphis of Tara, 1000 strong, went to
bchuetzen Park, the Dolphins. 2000strons;,
went to Guerneviile and spent the day in
Uohemian Grove, while at least 3000 peo
ple went to El Campo. T..e big crowd
was splendidly handled by the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railroad Com
pany, and there was not a hitch tlirough
out the day. Tne North Pacific Coast car
ried large numbers to Camp Taylor and
other resorts, wh.le the trains to the top
of Mount Tamalpais couid not carry all
the people anxious to get a view from tne
summit. The Oakland boais were all
crowded during the day, the people seem
ing to enjoy the ride on the bay rather
than a ride through the hot streets.
Never in the history of the grain indus
try has there been as much stagnation i:i
shipping as at present. Tnis morning the
British sn;p Dairymple completed load
ing barley al Balfour's for Iquiqui, and
that means that there is now nut a soli
tary ship on the berth for any part of the
world. True, the German bark C. H.
Watjen has been chartered and is coming
out of Oakland Creek to load for Cape
Town, but it will be a couple of days be
fore she is ready for stnfeninj,', so in that
time not an ounce of grain bound foreign
Will be handled. To show the state of ai
fairs the British ship Crown ot England
-.vas offered a charter at 21s 6d last Jun
uary. In February the offer was increased
to 22s tiu and in March to 2-is uJ. Last
week her owners were glad to accept 20*
6J, and two other shipo have since ac
cepted 17s 6d. At tne present time there
ire 82,678 tons ol disengaged shipping in
port, while at the same time last year
â  there were only 60,938 tons.
The wrecker Whiteiaw has of late been
at work on tho remains of tne steamer
Now York, and yesterciny succeeded in, re
covering a considerable portion of the
wreckage. T. P. A. Whitelaw is now con
fident that he will recover the greater por
tion oi the submerged vessel during the
next few weeks.
The Corinthian Yachfr Club practically
openeJ the beason yesterday. Every boat
in the fleet was out for a cruise and me
small flyers presented a very pretty sighi
as they scudded past tho wharves on their
way ud the bay. Along in the afternoon
the wind got too strong lor sumo of thÂ«
smaller craft and they had to run back to
Tiburon for shelter. The yachts are all in
splendid trim ana there &hould be some
good racing and cruising this season.

The Characters of
Esau and Jacob.
AT THE Oiivet Congregational Church
yesterday Rev. 11. T. Stiepard took
as his subject Jacob and Esau and
as his text Genesis xxv:2S: "And Isaac
loveil Esnn because he did eat of his vem
so:i, but Rebecca loved Jacob." He s;iid:
J..cob and Es-u lived in an age when
the moral standard was very low in many
ways. To deceive and to cheat one's ene
mies was considereJ righteous, and in
Isaiu-'s life it seems to have been cons.d
ered no very great wrong to lie to
one's father and to defraud one's
one's brother of his legal inheritance. The
trouble in Isaac's family a arted in favor
itism and partiality. Rebecca favored Ja
cob and taught him to deceive and oppress
Esau.
â¢â¢Isaac favored Esau, but his wife's
shrewdness was too much for him. E3au
was driven off to Edom as an outlaw and
a bandit, and Jacob was promoted to be
leader of his people and crowned with
success and honor. Esau was a hunter,
rough and wild in his tastes, but honest
and self-reliant. JacoD was sly and am
bitious, and very unscrupulous when
judged by modern standards.
"We see one leason for what seems to
have been God's preference lor Jacob in
that he loved civilization and represented
civilizing tendencies in Israel's national
life. He stood for the civilized home,
waile Esau represented the unsettled ex
istence of me hunter. Jacob's life was
pastoral, but fast tending toward agricul
tural and urban settlement and stability.
Between Jacob and Esau the meaner man
triumphed over the nobler one in matters
lish?" The Scotchman looked at the
skipper for a minute In astonishment and
th-.-n burst out: "Hoot awa, mon; how
could the quid God specr what they were
saying?"
To Sandy's mind the answer was con
clusive and ho reiused point blank to con
tinue discussing the matter.

God Immanent
in His Universe.
MIRACLES, and why they were doubt
ed, was the subject of Rev. William
Ruder's sermon la3t night at the
Third Congregational Church.
The speaker explained what a miracle
was by saying that four elements must
enter into it; it must be a wonder and a
wck; it must be the result of poTer and
it must be a sign.
The reason that rationalists doubt the
realuy of the scripture miracles, be said,
was because ot a lundamentai mistake
they make as to the relation of God to the
material world.
He illustrated this by a comparison of
the relations of a clockmaker to the clock.
An uninstructc'd biau misht imagine the
clock was self-ernst^nt and m iker and
mechanism one and inseparable â this was
pantheism. Another man might think of
the clock as having been made by one who
wound it up and then went away and left
it to run by itselfâ this was deism. An
other might conceive of the clock with a
maker who staid wiih it as its absolute
master, to suspend, hasten or alter its
movements and mechanism at will â this
was theism. The preacier regarded God
as residing in the material universe, as
the eoul of man dwelt* in his body.
The Lord's Second Coming
A Spiritual Truth
THE Rev. J. S. Davis said in his ser
mon on "The Lord's Secoud Coming"
yesterday:
'The second comirg of the Lord is a
vital reality, but bow is it effected? It is
not a physical corning oilt of the sky, bu>.
a spiritual coming to the hearts of men.
It is not external, but internal; not lcca!,
but universal. His kingdom is not of this
world; it is not such as flesh and blood
can inherit. The Lord is the Word, and
he is coming as the interior light of the

A Merry Pleasure Party
That Brought Sorrow
Home.
Charles Lehmann, a Clerk
in the German Bank,
Drowned.
The Capsizing of a Rowboat Launches
Four M.n Info the Waters of
the Bay.
An accident befell a pleasure party yes
terday afternoon, between 2 and 3 o'clock,
â¢ iff Quarry Cove, Aneel Island. Charles
Lohruann, a>jed 29 years, a clerk in the
German Bank, and residing with his
parents at 3573 Twentieth street, was
drowned.
Lenrnann, his brother Chria, with their
sisters and many others, numbering about
for.y.in all, boarded lao yacht Valoo at
Long Bridge yesterday morning, and after
sailing about the bay, put into Quarry
Cove, Angel Island. Here they ah went
asuore.
While the party wap ashore four youne
menâ Ctiarles Lehmann, F. H. Ecben
roth, Charles Haffschmidt and H. C.
Bach â got into a rowboat for the purpose
of visiting one of the yachts at anchor
near by. After making the visit they pro
ceeded to return in their boat to the Valoo.
Three of the party had been seated in the
boat when Lehruann jumped in â or, at
least, tried to, but missed his footing and
struck the hide of th.- boat, which lie
seized, and in aoing so turned it on the
side and she commenced to rill and then
capsized, throwing all hands iato the
water.
W. Yon and Ed Schnntenhaus, who
were on the yacht viaitea, jumped into
the water and caved Bach ana Huff
schmidt, while Eckenroth swam to the
yacht, where he was picked up. Leb
mann never rose to the surface after he
struck tne boar, the impression beinj; that
he was oazed by the fall.
A searching party labored for some
time in the hope of rinding the body, but
it was a vain search.

Better a Slave
Than Unemployed.
COLONIZATION for the unemployed
was the theme of Major VV. W.
Winchell of the Salvation Army last
ni-ht ai the Second Unitarian Church.
H* read as a scripture lesson the sixty
lirst cnaruer of Isaiah, which deals with
the subject of colonization.
In opening his address the speaker imÂ«
presbeJ upon his hearers how urgent was
the need for finding a solution of the
problem of the unemployed. He inti
mated that if the evil were' not remedied
hy some rational plan devised by society
the misery from it would continue to
increase till violence, bloodshed and at
tempted revolution resulted.
To remove the unemployed to the
country and set tnem to making their liv
ing from the soil he was satisfied would
prove an adequate remedy. Ho expected
the Salvation Army wouid soon have a
colony establistied near San Francisco.
By the time the Christian EnJeavorers
meet here the colony wili be an accom
plished fact. As soon as the sch me is
proved successlul in a small way in Cali
iornia the army will establish an immense
colony in New Mexico, where families by
the hundred thousand can find homes.
firmation on account of the stand taken
by the colonel during ihe great strike, but
the Military Committee, after considering
the matter, decided to sustain the position
taken by him during the trouble, and re
ported favorably. The 3d of May was
fixed as the time when the matter of con
nrmation will be called up.
Tiie military tournament at the Presidio
during the past week, despite the efforts
of some newspapers to belittle the affair
by ridiculing it, was a great success, and it
had the support of the citizens, lor if It had
not had they would not have gone day after
day by thousands to watch the many events
that were offered during the lour days.
It has beeti the means of establisuinua spirit
of commendable rivalry between the men of
theseveral posts in tiie department as to pro
ficiency In doing the work required in the
discharge of military duties. 'With the excep
tion of one or two of the m.litary events, they
were all of n practical nature and served a pur
poseâthat of accelerating the movements of
the men in the performance ol duties, 1n
which time, in case ol war, would prove of
the utmost value. The men entered iuto the
spirit of the affair with all the enthusiasm
that could be expected, and each sei-med
j anxious to excel. In their work they had the
stipporr, the assistance and encouragement of
i their superiors.
On Saturday the men from the Benicia bar
racks- were invited by the men of Alcatraz to
spend a (cw hours with them, and there pats
me time that they should remain on the
island, discussing the events of the previous
few days. Permission to vlyij was granted,
and thesoHier boys bad a very merry time.
They were taken back to the barracks by the
vcminent tug.
Tho San Diego contingent was granted an
I extension o; time for a week, and at the end
of tiir.t time they will return by rail to their
] barracks.
There has been considerable talk about pos
sible changes of stations ol regiments, but H is
asserted that there will not b-j any, for the
present at least, and that General Alger, sec
retary of War, is not in favor oi any chuuge.
So much of the general orders directing
! LieutenHnt-Colonel Young to proceed to Walla
Walla and accompany the two troops of his
regiment from that post to Fort Yellowstone
has been amended so as to direct him to pro
ceed to Fort Yellowstone from the Presidio in

Lively Competition Among
the Members of the
Germania.
The Columbia's Marksmen Do
Good Work With Their
Muskets.
San Francisco Schuetzen Club's Con
test for Society Medalsâ Mi i
tar? Shots.
There was a fairly large gathering of
riflemen on the Shell Mound rifle range
yesterday. The weather was so tine that
the wonder was that there were not
more. The German sharpshooters were
in the majority, for it was an off Sunday
witti the military marksmen. However,
those who did attei d the several events
had a thoroughly good time and some
iine shooting was done.
With the Germania Schuetzen Club
there were two events, the regular bull
eye shoot ana the bullseye contest for
cash prizes on the public tared-, the
prizes to be distributed at the end of the
year to those making the best centers. In
the club contest the prize-winners in their
order of winning and their scores as
shown by the measuring machine were as
follows:
1. L. N". Ritzau, 200 points; 2, Nick Ahrens,
225; 3, George H. Bahr;-, 430; 4. H. Huber,
486; 5, F. P. .-chusier. 515; 6, C. Xobmmn,
585; 7, John UtscuiK, o"94; 8, C. F. Rust, 841;
9, H. Hellberg, 107Â«.
Highest scores on public tareetâ C. Thier
baoh 502 points, L. Haake 517. H. Hellberg
679, D. B. Fnktor Â«!38. F. P. Schuster 842, a.
Jungblut 1181, J. Uuehig 1300.
The San Francisco Hchuetzen Verein
also held a bullseye shoot for twenty cash
prizes. The winners in their order with
their points were as follows:
1. H. Huber, 184 points; 2, A. Bertesen,
310; 3, D. B. Fakior, 317; 4, F. Koch, 349- 5

17, C. F. Rust. 1344; 18, Nick Ahrens 134M
-19, R. Stettin, 1430; 20, F. P. Schuster, 1532.
The regular bimonthly shoot of the
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club was not
as largely attended as u-ual, but what was
lacking in numbers was more ihan made
up in interest ana eood scores. All of the
events were re-entry matches, and one in
particular, the GUndeniann military
match, was the center of much attention.
Many excellent scores were made in this
race. Two comparatively new musket
â¢hooters, P. H. Bushnelf and J. E. Gor
man, are forging to tiie tront in the use
of the military arm. In two shoots Bush
nell has made two flags for inch centers,
F. 0. Young one and Â£d Hovey four. On
the fifty-yard pistol range Gorman almost
broke t,e ten-shot pistol record in the
diamond medal mutch. As it was he tied
Daiss' remarkable score of .33, Columbia
target count. There was an o<d familiar
face on the range yesterday. Peter Rob
inson, one of the first members oi the
Club and a fine all-round rifle shot, re
turned from Wasmngton witn hi> wife
after an absence of three years. Robin
son's hand has lost much of its skill, as
he Las been using the shotgun consider
ably on wild gam?, but he was neartily
welcomed. Yesterday's scores, Columbia
target, were as follows:
Rifle. 200 yards, F. H. Bushnell rifle medal
and cash prizes, three-shot scoresâ O.A. Breiner
11; G. Schuitz, 41.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 26, 1897.
WAS A BAD DAY
FOR THE TALENT
Wise Ones Were Losers
at the Ingleside Cours
ing Park.
The "Outsiders" Had a Chance
and Came H:me With
Bulging Pcckets.
It Was the Inaugural of th? Selling-
Stake S-hera? and Was a
Huge Success-
As an experiment a selling race, much
after the fashion of those given in the
horse-race traces, was tried at the lngle
side coursing park yesterday, and it
proved to be not only a success, but in
addition gave the dog-men a good line on
a brand new branch of sport.
selling stako was, naturally, the
event of the day, and a heavy betting
affair it wa*. too, for the reason that
some of tne very best dogs known on the
coast, together with a number of cele
brated Eastern cracks, were entered for
prizes.
It turned out to be rather a bad day for
the "talent." The races themselves, with
a few exceptions, were not above the or
dinary, but this did not interfere with the
speculative fraernity in the least. They
bet on everything, and invariably the
knowing ones lost, much to the joy of the
so-called "outsiders."
What was probably tho most important
race of the day, from a betting stand
point, was the comet between Hazel
Glen and Cleverness. In spite of the fact
that Hazel has been winning some good
races of late and in exceptionally clever
style, the talent stacked up its money on
the other doe yesterday and nave good
odds, so as to coax on the Hazel support
ers. Hazel won eaÂ«ily, and many n man
of gambling iustincts had to walk home.
This triumph wa.-s made all the more con
â picuous by reason of the fact that Clever
ness was a high-priced dog in the handi
capping.
Another heavy betting event was the
race between Swinnerton and Ben Hur,
both of which are considered excellent
dogs.
The "Jorm" players had Ben Hur
staked out aa a sure thing and Dlayed i
heavily on him. But Swinnerton caused
more than one case of heart failure by his
performance in leading to the hare arid by
his clever capture. But, then, that was
only another of the instances wherein the
wise ones guessed poorly.
Here are the results ot the day's racing:
Bartels &. Rohseter's Brandon R.-lls beat P.
A. McDonald's Deceiver; Bariels A Rosseter's
Ben ilur beat Doml:iiCK Snannon's Bwiuner

OAKLAND JUSTICE
Noisy Wagons Tolerated,
but a Quiet Individual
Arrested.
"The Edwin Booth of the Pulpit"
Has Not Jurtifi d Ad
vanes Noticrs
Judge Rawson's Reason for Having
Confij-ncj in the Future of
Lea^dro
Oakland Off:, San Francisco Call,!
DOS Broadway, Apiil 25. )
An arrest that was made yesterday of a
colored man is, v>erhapÂ«, the most flagrant
example of the unequal manner in which
the -kuauces ol this city mete out in
justice.
Aaron Moore, a tall individual of good
appearance, has lately been making a
liv.ng by a novel advertising scheme. Ho
was dr ssed in a very neat b.ua !Â»oit, and
bad a gentlemanly bearing, such at no
citizen could possibly nnd fault with.
Determined to do something for the
support o. his family, he has been for
nboat two weeks earning a few dollars
â¢walking around the streets supporting an
advertising apparatus on his shoulder*.
It \va< rather original, and consisted of a
nict'ly polished mahogany box, on the top
Â«f v.hieh pos>ed a rooster. By manipulat
ing strings which hunx down to his
shoulders, Moore couhl make ihe rooster
] ick up an advertising card in its teaS,
aii'j having done bj. would walk a block
and then make the rooster change the
card.
There was nothine at all offensive about
the man, nobody complained, and if any
ihing, it was ratner p easing to the eye <
\v:.e:i compared with ma:.y current Vile,
inartistic advertising schemes. Yester
day Moore was taken to jail for violating
an ordinance whica forbids any' one to
carry any banner, device or emblem used
fur advertising any trade cr occupation.
Daring the past month the citizens of
Oakland have been disgusted with a pro
cession ol band-wagons, bell-wagons and
drum-wagons, ver which huge trans
parencies atrociously colored have t>een
Duilt and which advertised all kinds of
fake Sneriff sales. To such an extent has
this abomination been practiced that ihe
Mercnan l^' Excuange, the Board of Trade
and correspondent in the newspapers
have aited thai something be done to
aba;e the nuisance. The noise made by
their rvpUisive instruments and the ol
fc:.-e to Lhe eye by the canvas atrocities
are a genuine nuisance, and yet, even
\\.,t-:i drawn by three mulesâ each mule
bearing an a ivertising ulankei â they are
not considered a legal nuisance.
>>!oore will be prosecuted to-morrow for
what i.c did, while the procession of
wagons still parades the streets with im
punity. To a disinterested outsider it
would certainly seem that ih- driver of
oue of ttiese wagons should certainiy be
os amenable to iue law as the poor colored
ma:-.
A few days ago ad Alameda man caused J
lue arrest of â¢ Fresno real estate man on !
a charge of fraudulently using the mails. !
The Alameda man complained that cir- j
cr. ars sent br the real estate dealer con- ,
tair.ed description* of land which were
not borne out by ttie facts, and conse- !
quentiy the dealer was alleged to be mis- ]
. Uncle Sam's pnvi.epes.
Judging by thi* sian :ard the parties i
who sent out the advance notices of Rev. |
I)r. Boyer of Chicago are equally guilty !
with the Fresno really man. The'Chica^o
evangelist who wears diamonds and luli
<:re-s suits when taking the part of the
lowly Nazarene has been in Oakland one
week at tbe Central Christian Church, but j
somehow or other his diamonds and cut- â 
nway have not drawn. As a matter of
fact he i- somewnat inferior to and suffers
by coni[ariÃon with ttie stationary pastor,
Rev. Kiward Davis. Mr. I).tv;* has cre
ated the school of pu'piteenng in which ;
he ;s a master, and ne has educated his
congregation to expect something very
orieinai each week. To his credit be it
sail, they nave rarely ben disappointed.
U hen Dr. Boyer was heralded it was
given ou: mat hÂ« would piace the erret:c
preacher st a disadvantage find completely

A generation ha? worked many changei
in the life of the lady who is now Mrs.
George L. .Morgan. On Thursday even
ing. May 13, she will be given a benefit
concert at the Unitarian church, and a
host of friends have guaranteed thai ii
shali be a great success.
Every Look reader in Oakland of moder
ate ace remembers the time when \V. B.
Hardy's bookstore was their rendezvous.
It was in the days when Henry Vrooman
was the great corporation lawyer ol Ouk
! land. Frank Jordan, now County derlc,
was his office clerk, and \V. K. D.tvis, au
ex-Mayor and senior counsel in the great
, water-front suit, was Yrooman's junior
partner. In those days Hamilton Hall
' was the leading church in the city, and
i \Va>hinnton street, now the center of
j easiness, was a district of dwelling
! houses.
Visitors to the old bookstore cannot
have forgotten the winsome and agree
[ able Kate Mould, and they alt remember
how George L. Morpan, then a promising
young lawyer, took MiÂ«s Mould from the
bookstore and made her his wife. For
: massy years they lived happily, but finally,
i at a time when her husband was City At
-1 torney of Oakland, death cut him off ana
the widow was Jeft with four little chil
dren.
Mrs. Morgan, however, did not grieve,
but went oravely to work and in a short
time built up a fine business of making
; paper boxes. Her babies grew, and the
I little fellows helped her, and the sweet lit*
| tie girl comforted her until life almost
â¢ seemed once more. Then came the
paper-box trust with its overwhelming
j competition. Mr.-. Morgan's thriving and
growing little Dusines-s was crushed out of
existence. She could not compete against
millionaires, and when business failed,
ill-health followed, and her busy hands
Could no longer earn the daily bread.
At this time the brave Mr?. Morgan is
in need of help, and all Oakland should
unite in rewarding the unflinching cour
age and cheerfulness of this true mother.
The tiroeramme will be carried out by
; Miss Alice Ame>, recently from Berlin,
Mi-s Caroline Little, Miss Boyer, Miss
Helen Hegar and the Temple Male Quar
tet. Other features may be added, a- of
fers <>f help from leaaine ta.ent around
the bay are very numerous and the benefit
will be worthy "of its origin.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 26, 1597.
A PRICE SET ON
A WOMAN'S HEAD
Five Thousand Dollars Is
Off 3red a Chinese to Kill
Mrs. Clune.
Well Known as the Active
Woman Who Built Her Own
Home Unaided.
Damaging Testimony in the Hands of
the Police, Who Are at Work
on the Plot.
Oakland Office Pax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 25. )
The police have JM*t nnearihed a por
tion of a plot which threatened the life of
a very interesting: Jady of this town. A
few days ago a Chinaman called at the
house, and gave the lady a letter to read.
It contained a promise to the Chinaman
MRS. J. M. CLUNE, the Female Hcuse-Euilder of Oakland. A
Chinaman Was Offered $5000 to Kill Her.
that if he should kill the woman who
would open the door when be presented
the letter he would receive $5000.
Mrs. J. N. Clune, residing at 814 Sixth
street, is one of the best known women
among the progressive element of her sex
in this city. Some time ago she came into
prominence by building her own huu-e in
which she now lives, without the aid of
architect or carpenters. It is a pretty lit
tle place, and has been viÂ«ited by hun
dreds anxious to see tbe house that a
woman built.
For a long time Mrs. Clune has been
assisting Mrs. Prescott in her work ns
secretary of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children, and in this
capacity it is probable that she has an
tagonized some party who now desire; to
wreak vengeance on her. There have been
several cases in which children are con
cerned and which have oeen very bitterly
contested, especially In West Oakland, in
regard to one or two Portuguese families,
and these (acts tend to support the theory
tnai M rs. Clune is in danger on account of
her official work.
Some lime last week Â«he answered a
Knock at the door and was surprised lo see
a Chinaman hand her a letter.
He told her that it bad been given to
him by some one with instructions to
take it to tbe house whose address it
bore, "314 Sixth street." He was instructed
to kill the woman who opened the door. to
him. and on his return h â¢ would beat
once given $5000. This information iraK
conveyed in the letter, and the plot would
probably have been carried out but for
the unexpected arrival of a third party at
the house.
Mrs. Clune had only read the letter
about half way through when the Cliina
n.Hii, hearing some one approach the
front gate, lore it from her hands and ran
off. fche had just read sufficient to learn
of her danger, and as soon as she could
she went and told her story to the Chief
of I'ohce.
Detective Nick Williams was detailed on
the case, and he soon discovered the Iden
tity of the Chinaman. He is a laundry
man living near Mrs. Clune, and from
him the incriminating letter was recov
ered. It has since been kept by the po
lice, and tbe whole affjir has been very
closely guarded, while several otlicers and
detectives are quietly working to find the
writer of the letter. Its exact contents
have not been made public, and it is
stated that there is more in it than the
facts relating to the assassination of Mrs.
Clune.
Experts are of the opinion that thÂ«
writing is tnat of a woman of but moder
ate education, and in this connection sev
eral names have been mentioned, but in
too indefinite a way to permit of their
use. Mrs. Clune's hu>band is a traveling
salesman, but so far he has been unable to
a'si-i liis wife in unraveling the mvstpry.
In the meantime the Chinaman is kept
ander surveillance, and by this means it
ia hopeii a clew to the originator of the
plot may be ob ained.
Mrs. Clune sue is quite at a loss to
account for the plot a^ain-t her life, ghe
declares she has no leason to suspect any
one and does not know of any enemy who
would attempt aay -uch thing. It has
caused her very great alarm and she is
very unxions to know who sent the letter
to trie Cn.naman. She came into promi
nence about two years ago, when she built
a house for herself on a lot owned by her
husband. It was the desire to help her
husband that caused _her to go into the
honse-building business. Although a
slight iittle woman, weighing only about
ninety ponnds, she laid the fonndation of
their home and was the architect, brick
layer, rarpenter, shingler, paper-hanger
and glazier, as well as plumber.
A local mining man wishing to encour
age her efforts paid her $1200 for tbe cot
tage, and before long^^^â¢Â». Clune had built
a i,ortion of another house. Her actions
have arouÂ«ed general admiration for her
and her friends are aoing all in tueir
power to run down her enemies.

NOTES OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
The Absence of General
Warfield Frcm the Col.
Smith Ceremonies.
An Unofficial Report of the
Condition of the First
Brigade.
The Filth Infantry Complimented on
Target Practiceâ The Naval Bat
talion May G) Oi a Cruise.
There has no- been anythin : of a
weighty nature in the National Guard dur
ing the past week outside of the trans
ferring; of the command of the First Regi
ment of Infantry to Colonel James F.
Smith.
Colonel J. C. Currer of the division
staff, an old officer of tne war of the reb -I
lion, was at Salinas last weeK with the
veterans and while there lie in his capa
city as division inspector, in company
with J. "W. F. Diss. major and iuspector of
the First Brigade, inspected troop C.
He found the troop in first-clais
condition and ascertained that of the
men fourteen owned their horses and
seventeen have been donated to the troop.
The men are well drilled and the Colonel
i says that they are a credit to the place in
which they are located and to the Na
tional Guard.
"Major Diss," said Colonel Currier, "speaking
of the first brigade, said that it is at this time
In much better condition than it hai teen
since the reorganization."
From remarks dropped last Thursday at the
informal reception given to Colonel Smith of
tho First Regiment, Second Brigade, it ii
likely that Colonel H. P. Bush (retired) will
accept the position of Judge Advocate on the
division staff which was made vacant ty the
promotion of Colonel Smith and in accepting
it he will have to accept the reduction in rank
from colonel to lieutenant-colonel. Now it
remains for time to determine if the leeling
that existed wnen Colonel Hush was in com
mand of the old First Regiment of Infautry,
wilt develop ana cause several members oi the
Major-General's staff to drop out, or whether
passing days have heeled all differences.
The Second Brigade.
The Informal reception to Colonel Smith last
Thursday night drew to the Regimental Ar
mory a larze number of the offict-Ts of the Sec
end Brigade. The call for assemblage at the
armory was 8:30 o'clock, and at that hour
Major-General James and his staff were on
hand with a military promptness that was a
subject of comment, favorable of course.
There was a delay, however, and inquirj led
to the discovery that it was occasioned by the
non-appearance of Brigadier-General Warfield
and siafl. An invitation was *ent to the brig
adier-general, delivered to him personally,
and the Invitation included himself and staff,
but Dp to teu minutes after 9 o'clock neither
the brigadier-general nor any memoer of his j
staff put i:i an appearance, and the neglect to I
appear or to send a leter of regret at Inability
to attend was construed by some as a slight to i
either the new colonel or to the sender of the
invitation. PosÂ«ubiy tne brigadier-general, ;
who received the invitation two day* before
the event, may have consiaeied the time too
short In which to uotify the ten members of
j his Man" to accompany nlm. In Â«n emergency
call the brigadier-general would consider two
hours about the right time in which to turn
out the entire guard. His absence from the
ceremonies was a subject of comment by
almost every < fficer present, and it is possible
that the brigadier-seneral will have to ex
plain why he was uoi present and why he did
not rend an explanatory letter.
The swearing in of the new colonel of the
First Infantry nas had the effect of dispelling
a slight war ciond that hung over tbe regi- i
ment lor some time past, and the manuerinj
which the Dew commander was received last '
Thursday night by the officers of the brigade
Is an indication that all differences have been
healed and that there will in the future be
unity of purpose and of action.
A pleasing feature of the presentation of a
diamond stndpin to Lieutenant-Colonel Victor
li. Duboce on his retirement from the active
command of the First Regiment, which he
had had Â«ince the resignation of Colonel Mac
donald In the early part of last January, was
the free heartedness ot the contributions to
the funds with which to purchase the hand
some testimonial. "The proposition to secure
something to show our appreciation of the
lieutenant-colonel's efforts on behalf of the
regiment," said one ot the officers on Sat
urday, "was started only two days before tho
presentation, ar.d there was not one of those
asked to contribute but did so most freely and
added that It wai with a feeling of satisfaction
that the money was given for the purpose of
showing In a befitting manner what was
thought of the interest the lieutenant-colonel
had taken in the advancement of tho First."
In an informal way this Information was con
veyed to Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce, and he
feels proud of the present he received, but
prouder of the unselfish motive that prompted
the officers who contributed to the purchase
of the present.
'ihe following are the orden that have been
issued for the inspection of the Second
Brigade.
Pursuant to law and orders from snperlor head

\vaÂ« a surprise from the fact that the captain
never before offered like assistance.

maudlng the Third Brigade, and oihers vis- ;
ited Santa Cruz for the purpose of inÂ«-pecting i

ant (junior grade) William E. El.iott, adjutant
ot the battalion, presided. There were two j

ant surgeon; Ensign Edward Fletcher of San
Diego, Third Division, and Carl E.Linsayof

shows the ciose attention that the men have
been p .ying to the duties expected of them.
On the eveningof the4th of May Lieutenant
(junior grade) Frederick W. Harris, surgeon of
the battalion, will deliver tne next lecture of
the lyceum course. It Will be on "First Duty .

which devolved upon them aa soldiers of
the church.

CONFIRMATION IN THE AFTER
NOON.
Two Hundred and F.ffv V >ung People
Formally Received Into the
Church.
The people of St. Rose's Parish had rea
son to be proud and happy yesterday.
Their beautiful new etiurcti on Braunan
street, between Fourth and Fifth, nÂ»Â«
solemnly dedicated by Archbishop Rior
dan, and the effor.s ol Father Nugent,
ably seconded by Fathers Gieason and
Ktnneally, as well a* the loyal parishion
ers, are now borne witness to by one of the
finen sacred edifice* in the City.
The dedicatory services commenced at
10:30 o clock yesterday morning, and it
was nearly '1 o'clock in the afternoon be
fore they were completed. The first part
of the service consisted of blessing 'he
outer walls. The precession, which formed
at the sanctuary, was led by Rev. Maurice
Kennealiy, sub-deacon, cross-bearer.
A force of twenty-four altar-boys fol
lowed. Six torch-bearers to the Archbishop,
Messrs. Conroy, Mu.ville, Maroney. Djly,
Horn and Walsh, preceded the vittuing
clergy, who were Fathers McGinty of Holy
Cross, Conoily of Si. Paul's, Gente of the
French Church, Gleason of St. James,
Maximilian ot St. Boniface and Father
Mulligan, secretary to the Archbishop.
Father Nugent, pastor of the new cnurch.
marc .Â«d wnu the viiu'ors. Archobiiop
Riordan was attended by Father Bohen of
Chicago and Father butler of Si. I;;na
tius, deacons ot honor; Rev. Joseph M.
Gleason of St. Rose's was master of cere
monies.
The procession proceeded from the sanc
tuary down tlie middle aisle through tne
main entrance. The altar boys here
formed in a line on the sidewalk with
Father Kenneally, cross-bearer, in the cen
ter. Here the Archbishop performea the
heautiiul ceremony of blessing the outÂ»r
walls while the clergy chanted the "Mis
erere."
The procession then returned down the
middle aisle to the aJtar, and there the
litany of saints was chanted by all in uni
son. The procession then made a circuit
of the inner walla, ending at the sanctu
ary, where the prayer of thanksgiving was
sung by the A rcn bishop.
At the conclusion of the prnyer j
the Archbishop proceeded to tue
throne, where Fathers .Mulligan and ;
Maximilian acted as deacons of honor.
Father Allen of St. Ignatius celebrated
solemn high mass, wiiu Fattier Bohen of
Chicaso as deacon, Father Dialer of St.
Ignatius subde&con :t:id Father J. BL
Gleason of St. Rose s master-of-cere- !
monies.
The music throughout the ceremonies
â was particularly beautiful and effective.
A double tr:o, ihe same waicn sang the
Easter service, composed the choir, nnu a
lull string orchestra assisted. The mans
was taken from Generali and LambiHote.
Daring the consecraion the orchestra
played the intermezzo from "Cavalleiia
Rusticana." A pleas. up feature of the
ceremonies was the work of the altnr-boys.
who moved with military precision and
w^re always in harmony.
The Archbishop delivered the dedica
tory sermon. He preached from the gos
nel of the day. "Peace be to you."
Though this may have been a conven
tional form of speech among the Orientals
and :he Occidentals also, he said, as used
toy our .Savior, it naa a meaning above
common parlance. Ii wa* one of the
precious words used Dy ttie Savior in the
lew days be remained on earth after the
resurrection.
"He left two kinds of peace," said the
Archbishop, "peace of mind and peace of
heart. Peace of mind because to the
apostles and their successors he had be
queatoed the solution of all difficult ques
tions of life, as Whence come we? or
Whither go we? The only definite an
ewer to theÂ«e things is in the Catholic
faith, as coming down from tho Sarior
himself.
"Ptace of heart, inasmuch as he has
left, is the moans of reconciling ourselves
to the God wnom we have offended by our
wrongdoing.
"These words of onr Baylor are roost
appropriate on a day like this, when form
ally and officially a n"w church is
opened to the service of God. It shows
us that we are part of that grand congre
gation apart from the world and entitled
to be cailed the church of Cnrisi."
In the afternoon the Archbishop con
firmed L'2s candidates TnÂ« children were
marshaled by Mrs. Margaret Sullivan,
Miss Nellie McCreagh, Mist Mary Cusick
end Miss Teresa Rue/. The boys were
led to the a'<ar rirst, followed by tho
young men. For these Thomas McÃride
mood sponsor. The girls, looking very
cbarmine in their while dresses, veils and
wreaths, came last. Miss Kate Gallagher
acted as sponsor for them.
The Archbishop on account of another
engagement addressed the young people
very briefly, but promised in the luture to
give them more extended instruction.
In the evening Father P. <J. Yorke
pmached at the new church.
Father Nugent, assisted by Father
Gleason as deacon, and Father Kenneally
as sub-deacon, pronounced the solemn
benediction.

Sje Tells a WHrd Story for the
California P?ych;cai Society to

The ghost of Windsor A. Keefer is said
to be nightly stalking through the halls
of the bu.ldiui,- at the southeast corner of
Geary street and Grant avenue.
Mile. Hastier, the artist and teacher of
WINDSOR A. KEEFER, the Missing Miner, Whose Ghost
Said to Stalk at Night About the Corridors of His Old Home.
the French language, who has been the
mining man's neighbor on the fourth
floor of that edifice, over the City of Paris,
is authority for this statement.
"I saw him," ohe said to a Call re
porter yesterday, "and I therefore know :
of what I am speaking."
Windsor A. Keefer is the well-known i
raining man who was one of the principal j
owners in the Jupiter mine in (Jaiaveras i
County. In March last he left this City |
for the mines, and the last that was seen I
of him was when he started oat hunting j
over the mountains with President i
Thompson, his friend and associate in ;
Calaveras mines. The two men separated !
during tne hunt, and only one has been
seen since thai time. What has become j
of Keefer is a mystery to every one but
Mile. Hassler, who is sure ne is dead.
Her story is so fraught with all that is
weird that it might well be taken up by
the California Psychical Society.
"I know nothing about the disappear

ance of Mr. Keefer," said the lady, "until
I descended the eievator one day. The
man in charge told me he fu missing,
and asked whether I would, like the other
ladie> on our floor, put In $2 toward a
fund to have his whereabouts looked tip.
"I toM the man that 1 would do noth
insr of the kind as I knew Mr. Keefer was
dead.
"This is bow I knew it," Mile. Hassler
explained in all earnestness. "1 had Rone
into the bathroom down the hallway the
night previous to water my Mowers, as I
do every night. The door was opeu and 1
had a gocd view of the hull.
"Strange as it miphi appear, a feeling of
chill and fear came over me. 1 heard no
noise, but something ind' finable caused
me to turn and look out into the hall. 1
was almost frightened to death when 1 did
so, for right there before me I saw Mr.
Keefer, or nhat was a white-sarued, deep-
Minken-eyed representation of him. The
vision, for it appeared almost transparent,
seemed to rioat down the hallway. There
way something so unreal Ã¼bout It that it
was ghostly. I did not know then that
there was anything wrong or suspicious
about Mr. Keeler, but I felt I was in the
presence of death.
"The ghost, as I regard that apparition
now, silently passed from my view as a
dissolving mist when it reached the room
door of Mr. Keefer's apartments."
Some years ago Mile. Hassler had an
odd experience, whicn was broucbt to
her mind yesterday while renewing her
meeting of Keefer's spirit.
"It was on August 3, 1883." she said.
"The Winter Garden, a great barn built
for concert and political purposes on the
site of where the Pacific Union Club 18
now, took fire. I believe an actor was
burned there. I was then boarding next
door witn a Mrs. Bessett. The flames shot
over to the very spot where 1 stood look-
I ing at the lire and I would have been
burned to death had it not beer, that a
few seconds before some unseen force
j pushed me along and out of the way. I
; cannot explain exactly what it was, but 1
j ?elt as if I was being kicked about the
heels and a voice i<eemed to tell me
'Move; move away." I no sooner had
I moved than the flames came over to the
| spot on which I stood, as if they had been
j wafted through a funnel. 1 '
So despondent are Keefer's relatives of
, his being found that yesterday relatives
! opened his room and practically took
j charge of the rftcctr.

held its yearly picnic in Bohemia Grove in

an<l the weather, while a little warm, was not
sufficiently tropical to prevent the pleasure

a success in every way.

PURSUED BY
A NEMESIS
The Hysterical Ashley-
Sisters on E J. Bald
win's Trail.
THEY LEAVE THE HOTEL
IN TEARS.
Their Intended Coup d'Etat
Proves a Dangerous
Boomerang.
WIGS AND FALSE NAMES LED
TO TROUBLE.
Tho Scheme Was to Force the Million
aire to Adopt Miss Lillian Ash
lev's B. b.'.
Miss Liliian Ashley, the unfortunate
young woman who made herself notori
ous by occasioning the shooting at E. J.
Baldwin In the Superior Court some
months ago during the progress of a
trial wherein she claimed that he was
the father of her babe, scored another
hnmiliatinc failure last night.
She and her sister, Eninia, who had
teen quartered at the Baldwin for several
days undÂ«ir the pleasing delusion that
their sojourn as 'Mrs. and Miss Lay"
would prova a coup d'etat that would
make Mr. Baldwin adopt the infant and
support its aunt and mother, were hustled
out of the hotel without ceremony.
Hysterical and weeping lite Niobe, the
heroine of the late revolver episode folded
her tent and hurriedly left the hotel in a
carriage, Mating that she was ill and
needed rest in some hospital, announcing
that her sister would remain for a
time with Irieuds. As they had no
money with which to settle the bill for the
eleeant s-uite of rooms they had occupied
Colonel Kowalsky chivalrously advised
Manager Stone to allow them to depart.
â¢'lf they surrender possession they virtu
ally give us nine points in the battle,"
said he, "and it is cheaper to let them go
than to feed tnem here and allow them to
occupy luxuriant quarters."
So the women called a hack at 9 o'clock
and were hastily uriven away, having
been notified that they would be dealt
with harshly if they remained and did
not settle their biil.
"1 told them the hotel was mine," said
Manager Stone, "and that Mr. .Baldwin
Lad nothing to do with it; that they had
come here under alia es, disguised in
strange and startling wigs, and that I
could not tolerate them. At first thoy
stormed and fumed, the mother of the
babe being a particularly fine bluffer, and
declaring that she would notify her hus
band in Chicago of the insulting way sue
was being treated. This took us aback
and we hesitited, but they finally threw
up the sponge and went out as Colonel
Kowalsky counted time."
Mr. Baldwin was in the lobby just be
fore the women came down in the ele
vator, but friends hurried him to the side
walk to avert the possibility of a shot or
other form of assault. The old gentleman
had barely been hustled into the open air
when his Nemesis, much excited and evi
o>ntly greatly unstrung, swept through
the lobby ana into the carriage that
awaited her. She was driven rapidly
over a circuitous route to St. Luke's Hos
pital, where she was registered under an
assumed name and booked as a vic:im of
"nervousne-s."
"In ibis strange and badly planned bat
tle," said Colonel Kowalsity last night,
â¢'these unfortunately advised young
women htid a strange notion that there
was some sort of law by which they could
compel Mr. Baldwin to support the chiJd,
but I informed them that there was no
such law and that a man could not adopt
a child, even if he wanted to do so, with
ont the consent of his wife.
"They were greatly disconcerted when
they found t rial the hotel was not under
Mr. Baldwin's control, ana when finally
and firmly ordered to go they wept ana
wrung their hands."
Miss Lilian male many futile attempts
to communicate with E.J.Baldwin yes
terday, but none of Her letters were
opened ana few reached him at all.
"She even went to tlie trouble yesterday
to send him a ielter by Wells Fargo, but
her time was wasted. Mr. Baldwin lirrnly
said : 'The child is not mine ana I have no
business with this woman,' and during the
entire siege he did not swerve from that
position. Ke was much annoyed by the
notoriety of the matter yesterday and
seemed greatly pleased when his Nemesis
had gone."
No actreis ever bowed to a more inter
ested or appreciative audience than the
one fair Lillian Ashley, her child and her
sister faced last evening as she stepped
out on to Powell street to start on the
journey from the hotel they had been re
quested to leave.
The crowd had been anxiously awaiting
the appearance of the party for several
hour*, anu when the heroines suddenly
appeared through the doorway of the
Baldwin every one rushea to catch a
glimpse of the departing sisters.
A carriage was in waiting and the
driver, as soon as the oarty was safely in
stalled, shouted at his team with the ve
hemence of a man overburdened with a
tangled mess of orders and instructions.
The carriage rolled away; turned into
Market street, in a few minutes into Va
lencia street, and hurried toward the out
skirts of the City. When Twenty-fourth
street was reached the horses were turned
from their course along Valencia and
headed toward the black foothills in the
west.
'1 lii?, however, was but a ruse to throw
any possible lollower into confusion. The
team sped round and round a few blocks,
s'raighien'-d in its course again and head
ed for S . Luke's Hospital.
Arriving at the hospital the party
alighted and entered the otlice of the phy
sician in charge, Dr. Armstead. Here Miss
Ashley told a nurse that she wisaed to be
admitted to the hospital, as she was suf
fering extremely from nervousness and
physical disability, and -visbeil an opera
tion performed witnin the next few uays.
I'he natient gave the attending nurse a
fictitious name, but later wuen questioned
by Dr. Armstead admitted that she wa*
Lillian Ashley. She requested the phy
sician to allow no one to see her, and her
wishes will be respected.
ShÂ« was placed in a neat little room,
given a quieting dose and she retired to
sleep. Her siiter nnd the baby returned
to the carriage and were taken to some
downtown lodging-house, where they will
rest secluded from the lt.quiaitive world.

LIKE THE SUN'S LIGHT.
Thus Will Knowledge Come
From the East to the
West.
Brahmacharin BodabhisKshu, the Brah
min student, who is promulgating theo- I
sopliical ideas throughout America, spoke
at Native JSona nail last evening. The
speaker was arrayed in the garb of a hi^h
class Brahmin, which consists of a pure
white robe, a white neckscarf and a white
turban. The headdress, which extends j
far down on each side of his head, forms a i
striki ng contrast with his dark face and j
makes the latter se<m much more swarthy
than when the turban is removed.
The subject of the Brahniacharin's art- |
dresÂ« was "Religion as a Science." He {
has a remarkably tine flow of language !
and a poetical conception which he
drew upon copiously for glowing and j
striking figures.

itual life," he %aid, "unless we lead a j
truly unselfish lile. This is not preached :
on any impulse. It is not mere senti- !
meat, for it is based upon philosophical, j
scientific knowledge. You know Christ ;
' said 'Blessed are the pure in heart.'
There can be no purity without tinsel fish
i ness.
"Man should have control over his own
I mind. He Bhould be able to say to it, j
1 'You are my slave. You must not think |
oi things I do not wish to think of. Come
here. I fix you on that thing. Think of
that.' "
T>.e speaker then explained the process
by whicn the soul leaves the body during
life. This, he said, was what was meant
in the Bible by lasting forty days anct
forty nichts. He said that many of his
friends could leave their bodies at will.
"Truth comes from the Orient," he
said, in conclusion, "as tue sun which
ri*es in the east and continues it" jour
ney, spreading light around the worid. It I
was predicted years ago by a European
thinker that eastern ideas would one duy 'â 
take possession of the west, ami that day |
is at hand. The wesiern people have j
built the form. The spirit will now How
in from the east. You may call it
Christianity, you may call it theosophy,
you may call it what you will. You can
not resist this current. The mold is ready
and the blending of the east and the west
is at Land."
