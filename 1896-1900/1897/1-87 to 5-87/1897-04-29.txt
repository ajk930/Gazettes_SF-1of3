Volo, the objective point of Lihem Pasha's movement to tbe â¢.â, Js a position of great importance to the Greek, ..
long as they remain on the Pbarsa'.a line of defense. To hold it and the railroad connecting it with Pharsaia is an object of
prime jmporiance, as they can thereby keep up quick communication with Athens by rail and sea. while, should they lose it
all supplies must be sent by land. â  * '
The city contain, about 11.000 people, and .s. in fact, two towns counted as one. The old town lies on the lower slope of
Uount *elion. about a m.le and a half away from the "Skala," or landing place, wnicb. since the opening of the railroad to

the pass of Tepe-Pi:av. through which come the railroad and highway from Larissa. and by which tbe Turkish advance must
be made.
There are no defenses In the port except what may hare been very lately contracted. The only fortifi cations about the
city consist of a fort of heavy masonry on a rocky led B e northwest of the town, which commands the city, the "Skala" and
the upper harbor, but has little bearing on the roads from the northwest.
Threemilestotae.we*t, near\elestino. is the junction of the railroad to Pharsaia and Trikkal*. which after Uavin*
Velestlno, runs through a series of deep catlings to tr,e summit of the pas, overlooking the plain of Velestino. Nearly parallel
to the railroad is the wason road to Pharsaia and intermediate points. A coaple of miles south is the plain and city of
Almyro. through which passes the mad to Lamia and beyond.
With tbe aid of war vessels in the harbor, the Greeks will probably be able to bold the port and the terminus of the rail
road, and by i;ood management keep the line intact and open to Pharsaia. Should they not aacceed in this and be flanked at
Velestino, they can withdraw by water through Trikui Channel to the and Athens, or by Oreaa Channel to Lamia
and road to Pharsaia.

Ao Change in the Attitude of the Chris-
(i<in Potrert.
LONDON, Ess., April 23.â Nothing of
importance had happened at Athens up
to the time the latest dispatches were sent
from there to-night. Tr.ese dispatches
show tLat although thtre i- c r.siderabie
excitement in the city the general situa
tion is not so threatening as It has been
and that there is no disorder of any conse
quence.
The Boule, which was summoned to
meet in extraordinary session this morn
ing, held no meeting, owing to the fact
that a quorym was not present.
The Legi-lative Assembly met again
this evening, with only uinety-rive mem
bers present. O.ie hundred and four are
necessary for a quorum, and the house
again adjourned. A great crowd was out
side the bui ding, out then* was no dis
order. The city generally is quiet.
A disvatchj:rum Athene to the Chronicle
reports: '.'l'Larsala is becoming discour
age!. A strong man could perhaps gal
vantze the nation into a supreme eflort;
otherwise I am afraid all is over."
The sipn -cauce of tLi* dispatch lies in
the intimacy of the correspondent with
high state officials. Hitherto he has been
in close touch with the highest sources of
information.
Meanwhile,despite the consultations be
tween Great Britain, France and Italy,
the beat-informed correspondents at Eu
ropean capitals concur that the attitude of
toe powers ia unchanged. They still
maintain !:â¢â¢:: r ,va not to offer to
meulatc between UVeeoe and Turkey, but
await submission of the former, and
especially to ivait for the withdrawal of
Greek troops from Crete.'
Importance is attached t- the fact that
Hanotanx, the French Foreipn Minister,
to-day had an interview lasting five hours
wan Manir Bey, the Turkish EmiaÂ«a
dor. The length of the interview is taken
to indicate that there is some divergence
in the views between them. There was a
constant exchange of telegrams with Eu
ropean capitals during the conference.
The Paris correspondent of the News
telegraphs that during the conference be
tween M. Hanotaux and Muntr Bey the
Foreign Minister urged tne latter to ad
vse the Sultan to hold out the ohye
branch to Greece. It was added that if
Ottoman troops advanced the conse
quences wcuid be ii'.ca.culable. France
would be comDelled to come forward a*
the defender of :he cau-e of Christianity
and civilization. Continuing Hanotaux
declared tnat if the powers intervened in
the Levant it would not be to prop up tne
Ottoman empire. In conclusion he said
the overthrow of the dynasty at Atcens
could not tail to have far-reaching conse
quences.
The correspondent adds that as soon at
Jlunir Bey departed from the foreign
office Hanotaux summoned the heads of
various departments to receive instruc
tions.
Lord Salisbury, who has been for some
time at R vera, left Nice to-day on his re
turn to London. It is expected that he
will see Hanotaux when he arrives at
Paris to-morrow.
The Chronicle has been ?ounding yari
ous prominent men for opinions on the
Graeco-Turkish situation. It finds tha;
the darkest yiews as to Greece's pros
pects that prevail in best informed qjar
lers are common elsewhere. Di.kÂ«, an
authojity on foreign questions and warmly
pro-Greek, takes a very pessimistic v:ew
of the situation, and thinks the powers
are determined to postpone intervention
- until the Greek dynasty has fallen. What
s will follow after he does not veniure to
propheÂ«y.

that Constantine was the last to leave

HAVANA. Ccba., ADril 28.â Horrible
details come to Sancti Spiritu* of the
total destruction of a small village ten
miles fjom there on April 15. The Tillage
contained 150 persons, who received per
mission from the commandant of sancti
Â£p;ritm to rernaiu there and yrow crop-.
Oa Weyier'a last visit to that section be
waÂ« informed of this an i it was intimated
to him that the Spanish Governor tnere
had received money to allow them to re
main. Weyier thereupon gave orders to
Captain Diaz, the noted guerrilla leader,
to remove them.
Diaz arrived there at nisht and sta
tioned his force of 300 men around tne
settlement, completely encompassing it.
Houses throughout the village were then
tired upon simultaneously, and as the
scream.ng and defenseless people emerged
from the buildings they were shot dowa
like dogs. The Spanish guerrillas spared
neither age nor -ex. and when morning
dawaed over 100 bodies were lying in the
ruins of the once flourishing village.
D.az made a report that ne had been at
tacked by Cuuans and that some pacificos
h d been killed during the tight. The
exact facts were brought to the Junta by

GARCIA* S GKEA.T riCIORT.
Graphic Account of tht Battle by a
-iiiiih Officer. .
HAVANA, Cum, April 25, Tia Key
West, Apr.l 23.â General Nicolas del Rey
. has been recalled to Havana from Santi
ago de Cuba. Tne cause is the great vic
tory obtained over him by Calixto Garcia
near Guamo.
Further details of the battle from Man
i zaniilo under date of April 19 show that
: the Spanish column of 2000 men was put
i to rout by the dynamite bombs that were
explbJed. Two hundred were blown up
by the bombs and 250 were slain by the
insurgents during the confusion of the
panic-striCKen Spanish column. The
bombs were planted in the road on which
the Spaniards were marching. S:x bombs
exploded simultaneously in the center of
General Rev's co umn. A Spanish officer
writes the following description of the
battle to bis family here regarding the ex
plosion:
"From the center of our column a sud-
den shock came, which threw ua to the
ground. We remained deaf and blind for
a few seconds. Then we tried to arrange
the column again, bat in tne panic and
disorder we toll one upon another in the
greatest disorder and confusion. When I
was able to stand I saw around me head
entirely cat off from bodies, pieces of hu
man limba scattered here and there, and
men without arms or lezrs crying in the
grasp of death. On the branches oi some
of the trees were the mutilated bodies of
many of our soldiers. Legs, arms ana
pieces of bloody garments were Hanging
from the tranche?. It waa perfectly easy
a few moments later for the enemy to rout
and disperse our column.
"Â±'earing another explosion each man
thought only of saving himself. Further
more we were surrounded in a few mo
ments by foes, who fired on us mercilessly
from all sdeo. As soon as the first shots
of the insurgents wsre henrd after the ex
plosion our general, followed by his stall
and other officers and soldier"!, fled to
Guamo. They were soon foiiowed by the
whole force. In our retreat we were
greatly harrnssed by. the Cuban cavalry."
The writer add 3 thai the Spaniards leit
on the field neaiiy all of their arms and
ammunition, besides a considerable con
voy of provisions they werj carrying to
Guamo. From other letters it is learned
that Garcia in person lei tne Cubans, and
JUSTICE STEPHEN J. FIELD.
tnat since the landing of General RolofTs
expedition in Cuba the use of dynamite
by tne Cubans is inces-ant. This has put
the bpanlsh soldier* into a state of terror
difficult to describe.

HAVANA, Cuba, Adhl 28.â Within the

exodus of Spanish generals from Cuba to
Spain, and advices from tne Philippine

part of the Spanish generals there to get

CLINGS TO

POSITION
//
Associate Justice Field
Determined Not to
Resign.
WILL YIELD TO DEATH
ALONE.
He Has Resolved to Remain
"Until Removed to a
Higher Court."
WOULD BREAK THE RECORD FOR
LONG SERVICE.
It Is Believed He Wishes to Occupy
the Bench Longer Than Any
of His Predecessors.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 23.â A
report has been circulated in the Caiifor*
nia colony here that Associate Justice
Field of the United States Supreme Court
had resolved that he would remain on the
uench "until removed to a higher court."
A representative of The Call visitet the
Supreme Court this morning, but the big
leather chair usually occupied by Justice
Field was vacant. The o:her ei^ht Jus
tices were present to hear Hon. Jere Wil
son, tte eminent lawyer, argue an im
portant National bank case.
The Call representative then visited
Justice Field's residence, near the Cap
itol. The aged jurist's wife said that Mr.
F.eld was indisposed. He had not been
feeling well for some time. He had a bad
cougn. She felt sure, however, that it
was nothing serious.
"Iv fact." said Mrs. Field, "the Justice
went out driving this morning. '
She begged that her husband be ex
cused, unless the matter was very urgent,
as he had denied a reception to all vis
itors !a:ely.
Mrs. Field was told of a report printed
some time ago to the effect that her hus
band would retire in July next. She
neither affirmed nor denied the truth of
this, saving merely that she felt sure ihe
Justice would not care to make any
avowal of tm intentions at this time.
Rumors and contradictory rumor? have
been printed about Mr. Field's contem
plated resignation. Four or tive years
ago reports of his early retirement were
sent ont from Washington, but Mr. Field
still hangs on tenaciously. At one time
it was said that he intended to remain on
the bench so that President Cleveland
would not have the pleasure of naming
his successor. It will be remembered that
he felt somewhat disgruntled because
President Cleveland during his first ad
ministration was not disposed to accept
bis advice with regarl to California ap
pointments. Therefore he was resolved
to hang on until Mr. Cleveland was suc
ceeded in office. LatterJy the Justice has
been greatly d.spiesaed because of the
anxiety of certain Californiaus to get rii
of him.
It has been the constant expectation,
which amounts to a certainty, that At
torney-General McKenna will succeed him
on the bench, and it is well known that
James A. Waymire has hopes of being At
torney-G neral when McKeona is elevated
to the Supreme Court. Tnis inspires a
grim determination on the part ol Justice
Field to defeat the ambuioa of those who
are so anxious to prctit by his retirement.
Justice Field is Known to be of a some
what retaliatory disposition. One day he
asked The Call correspondent about
George K. Fitch, then editor of the Bul
letin.
"When I was a mtmber of tiie California2
Legislature thirty years ago," said he, "I
had a differenca with Mr. Fitch, wno was
a candidate for State Printer, and al
though I have been in California many
times since I have not spoken to him."
This incident is told merely to illustrate
the tenacity of purpose which actuates
Jus ice Field, lie is an aggressive nÂ«:hter,
and it has been said ol him that he would
not hesitate to tilt with old de&ta himself.
It is feared, however, that the great
jurist must soon relinquish his bold unon
his office. His life hanjs by a slender
threat.!. lie totiers to and from the court
room; yet, strangey enough, he is con
sidered mentally qualified to sit on the
bench. A perusal of his written opinions
would not indicate any impairment of his
mind, bat then is a suspicion that his
associates render valuable assistance in
tlie preparation of his decisions.
When James A. Way mire was here, he
dined one day witii Justice Field. He
reported later that he thought the Justice
was only anxious to'coinplete a service
that would exceed that of John Marshall,
who was on the bench for a longer term
than any other Suureme Court member.
But later, Mr. Way mire revised his opinion
anJ felt that Mrs. Field's social ambition
would keeD her hu<band on the bench as
long as the aged jurist was able to perform
his duties.
Chief Justice Marshall, beginning his
term in ISOI, was thirty-foot years live
months and four days on the bench.
James M. Wayne served from 1825 to 1867.
Justice Field began his service in 1863,
four years before Wayne coased his ser
vice, and has continued to this day. If
Justice Field lives until August 16 he will
have served one day longer than Marshall.
There has been one older man on the
bench of the Supreme Court than Justice
Field. Chief Justice Koger B. Taney
went upon the Dench when he was 59
years of age, and remained upon it until
death removed im at tbe age of 87 years
and 6 month?.

AWFUL STORY OF THE SEA.
Feet and Hands Removed From the Sur-
y vcrs cf the Valiant, W;:o Also
Lose Their Reason.
ST. JOHNS. Newfoundland. April 28. â
Tbe foar survivors of the Vuiilant in the
hospital at St. Pierre are very low. The
removal of their feet and hands was suc
cess:u:ly performed last night, but there
is fear that two of them, Haubecho and
Honyoo, will not survive. The doctors
are also afraid that none of them will re
cover reason. Tiiree are mentally un
hinged ana the fourth has only occasional
lucid intervals, during which a few details
are got from him.
Captain Pierres 1 boat only parted com
pany with theirs on the morning of the
rescue. She hal ten men aboard, two of
whom had died and the remainder ware
)n about the same condition as these four.
This h:is created a feeling that the boat
may aiso have been j icked up, and friends
of the captain are anxiously awaiting
tidings of her.
Wh?n the castaways were rescued they
had broken off a pan of the dory's cun
wale and fastened it in the bow with a
shirt attacheJ as a signal. This at
tracted the attention of the rescuing
vessel, whose captain says that none of
the four could have survived that night,
for a gale arose which would have sunk
them.
The survivors had no boots when they
left the wreck, only wooden sabots with
out socks, and iheir feet were terribly
frozen. There was a regular battle for
the boats when the collision occurred.
All fought like demons, and four boats
were overturned through the frenzied
seamen jumping :nto them from the ship's
side. It is estimated that thirty or forty
perished in the ship, the remainder being
iv the boats.

FRaNKFORT, Ky., April 2S.â William
J. Deboe was to-day elected Senator to
succeed Senator J. C. Blackburn, after one
of the most famous political battles in the
history of Kentucky. Deboe supported
Hunter in 1896 for Senator. Last Fn lay
night the friends of Hunter nominated
Deboe in caucus. The tight has been one
in which 112 ballots have been taken,
sixty of wnich were taken during the pres

Hunter was forced off the track by the
exposure of his silver letter and by indict
ments for alle.ed attempts to bribe.
1 Seventeen sound-money Democrats bolted

It was a foregone conclusion that Deboe
would be elected to-day. The se-sion was
attended by a large crowd of politicians*.
Deboe received 71 votes â 69 Republicans
and 2 gold Democrats â one more than suf

member of the Senate, but did not vote.
Deboe ?aid to-night:
"I belong to the school of Republicans

am a protectionist, favor the passage of
the tariff bill and am for sound money. I
am in thorough accord with the Republi

Deboe is 47 years old and a native of
| Crittenden County, his present home. He
is a graduate of medicine and has prac
ticed law successfully for the past nine
years.
Blackburn spoke to his followers at the
opera-house to-nipht. In speaking of

LONDON, Exg , April 28.â The opening
! of Her Majaty's Theater to-night must
rank &3 a brilliant inauguration of what
will undoubtedly prove the most brilliant
â , season ever known in London. Everybody
of prominence in the diplomatic, social
i and uramatic world was included in what
: was perhaps the most distinguished
| audience ever assembled in a playhouse.
I This splendid theater, which Beerbohm
! Tree has erected, is the finest in England.
i The building is in style French renais
sance, and is one of the best architectural
ornaments of London. The interior is
I beautifully decorated in the style of the
period of ihe regency and of Louis XV.
Tree and bis company were received
j with immense enthusiasm. Mr*. Tree
; recited an ode written by Alfred Austin.
: poet laureate, which was no worse, per
j haps, than some of his other efforts.
! After this, the national anthem was sung,
in which almost everybody present joined.
Tnen Gilbert Parker's dramatized version
of ''Seats of the Mighty" was produced
for the first time in London. It was an
unfortunate selection and a failure. The
audience was most eenerous, and the
acting good, but the play was too slow ana
heavy.
FOUfi PERSONS KILLED.
Perilous Fira in Brooklyn, at Which Two
Children Were Dropped to Their
Death.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 28.â Four
persons were killed in a fire early this
morning in the fuur-storv fiat building at
1278 Third avenue, Brooklyn. The dead
are: Mrs. Celia Brunett, widow, 56; Mrs.
Carrie Newell, 37; John Newell, 7; Lewis
Newell, 18.
There is a strong suspicion that the fire
was of incendiary origin, and that it was
started in the lower hallway near the
main entrance, as well as at t::e foot of the
elevator shaft, to cut off the flight of the
occupants. Mrs. Urunett lived in the flat
over *.he store. All avenues of escape were
cut off, and she perished before the fire
men reached her.
The top floor was occupied by John
Newell, his wife and two children. He
occupied the bedroom in front and his
wife and the children slept in a rear
roo-m. Newell could make no attempt to
reach his wife and children. He escaped
by hanging to the coping till rescued.
His wife was at the front window on tne
other side of toe building with the
youngest child in her arms and the other
by her side. Sbe was about to throw the
children into the street when the firemen
implored her to wait until a blanket
could be procured. While the firemen
held the blanket under the window she
dropped ihe children. Bilh feil several
feet beyond the heads ol the firemen and,
striking the sidewalk, were killed almo>t
instantly. The mother, directly after
droppine the children, fell back into the
room. Her charred body was found after
the tire v. as extinguished.
THE HAWAIIAN TREATY.
Senator Perkins, Wht,e Making Up His
Mind, Seems Inclined to Vote
for Reciprocity.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 28â There
are indications that the tremendous pres
sure Drought to bear upon Senator Perkins
may cause him to revise his opinions of
a week ago concerning the Hawaiian
treaty. At that time he said mat
he was in favor of the abrogation
of the reciprocity treaty "because
it did not reciprocate." He pre
sented an anay of figures to show
that it wai jng-bandled in its benefits, but
to-day Senator PerKius said he bad not
made up bis mind whether to vote for the
continuance of the treaty orits abrogation.
"But was not your position correctly
outlined in The Call a weeK ago?"
"Yes," said Mr. Perkins, "the article
was correct. My own personal conviction
is that the treaty is of advantage to Ha
waii, without much benefit to the United
States; yet a majority of the people of
California, as expressed by a very large
number of memorials and" petitions from
Boards of Trade, Chambers of Commerce
and other commercial bodies in San Fran-
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 1897.
SENATOR-ELECT W. J. DEBOE OF KENTUCKY.
Cisco and other California cities and
towns, seem to De in favor of continuing
the treaty.
"I believe that a Senator in his repre
sentative capacity should represent, not
his own personal convictions, but the
views of nis constituents in matters ot
this kind. Oi course a United State- Sen
ator i expected to keep in line with the
party that elected him, or else resign, but
when there is a wide diverge/ice of opin
ion as to parly po icy, or when a majority
of the people express themselves in favor
of a certa n measure, 1 think it is his duty
to represent their views a* nearly as pos
sible."
DEADLY MEXICAN WATERSPOUT.
Three Towns Partially Destroyed and
Three Lives Lost by the Mad Rush
of Waters.
CITY OF MEXICO. Mcx , April 28 â
The towns of Santa Clara, Cuauiitlan and
Pedro Jalostoc, about one mile apart snd
situated five miles north of the suburban
town of Guadaloupe, were partly de
stroyed by a waterspout about 5 o'clock
on Monday evening. Th cc lives were
lost so far as known. An Immense vol
ume of water swept through the villages,
tearing up giant trees by tbe roots, lev
eling houses, forcing out huge bowlders
from the ground and leaving everything
devastated In its wake
At 5 o'clock a small black speck was
seen in the horizon. Its heavy shade
soon enveloped everything In darkness
and deaf-uing. thunderbolts soon began to
reverberate. Ifa.n and hail betran to fall
in torrents. Warer fully eight feet deep
rushed through the streets at a fearful ve
locity, tearing down houses and stanch
masonry walls,> opening the ground and
causing great destruction. Nearly all the
inhabitants escaped death by seeking ref
uge in the hills. Upwards oi twenty
houses were destroyed.

Laborers and Went to the
Theater.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 28.âPresi
dent McKinley suffered no ill effects from
the exposure to the weather at the great
monument dedication. After breakfast

politicians. They took a walk with Sec
retary Porter, followed by two detectives
as guards. On Filth avenue they passed
a gang of laborers at work in the trenches.
The laborers uncovered, md he doffed his

boys recognized the President and re
moved their bats.
Mrs. McKiniey held a reception 1n the

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 28.â The
indications are that the Roar Admiral re

Pacific naval station, will not go to
Honolulu in July to relieve Roar Admiral
Beard3lec, as provided in recent naval
orders, his assignment to represent the
United States at the Queen's Jubilee

Owing to the critical condition of things
in Hawaii through Japanese colonization,
and Japan'- reported ambition to get hold

in making the selection. It is understood
that the inclination of President Mc-
Kinley ana Secretary Lone points toward
Commodore Henry L. Howison, who is
well acquainted with the people of Hawaii
and is popular there. Commodore George

THE TARIFF BILL
TO BE BLOCKADED
A Three-Months' Siege
in the Senate Is
Probable.
Democratic Members of the
Finance Committee So
Declare.
First Skirmish Between the Oppos
ing Forces Is LooKed For
To- Day.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2S.â The
first skirmish in the Senate for the next
two or three months will probably take
place to-morrow. A meeting of the full
Finance Committee will be held, and the
tariff bill so far as it has been revised by
the four sub-commUteemen will be sub
mitted. The bill is practically completed,
but it is not likeiy that it can be reported
by the lull committee in completed form
before Monday. The Republicans have
been notified that the Democrats feel it
incumbent upon them as members of the
opposite political party to oppose report
ing racb an important measure to the Sen
ate until they r-hall have had full oppor
tunity to examine and study it. The five
present Democratic members of the Com
mittee on Finance are Senators Harris,
Vest, Jones, White and Walthall. Wdite
of California is the only one who orig
inally insisted upon subjecting the new
bill to a rigid inspection by the lull com
mittee before it was reported to the Sen
ate. Lately, however, Jones has been
urged to make a fight upon the Republi
can measure cs a feature of party policy,
and be has therefore joined with White in
serving notice that the bill must take the
usual course to the Senate through the
committee.
The four Republican Senators who have
revised the bill have maintained the ut
most secrecy as to changes and have done
this largely for the purpose of protecting
themselves againsi the pressure of outside
iniluence. It, is largely for this reason
that they desire to avoid Having the bill
subjected to the scrutiny and criticism of
Democratic members ot the committee,
and possibly to amendment and revision.
They are still hopeful of prevailing upon
the Democratic Senators to allow them to
bring the bill into the Senate as a party
measure for which the Republicans alone
are responsible, and it is possible that by
showing the members of the fall commit
tpe â  rough draft of the proposed bill to
morrow they may be induced to withhold
their opposition until the measure is re
ported to the Senate.
The election of a Republican Senator in
Kentucky would materially assist the Re
publicans in their efforts to pass the bill,
but the tight is not likely to be on strictly
Republican and anti-Republican lines.
Indeed, the Republican Senators of the
Finance Cummittee are apparently more
solicitous about Uie support of some radi
cal marchers of their party than me
probable course of the silver Republicans
and Populists. There is authority lor the
statement that the revised bill provides
for a material reduction of the ]> nciey
rate*. This leads the Republicans to hope
that the opposition will be less formida
ble than originally anticipated. As the
Democrats, however, have decided to op
pose it from start to finish, the bill is
lilc ly to be before the Senate for at least
three months.
AE\ATO It WBiTK'S POSITIOS.
BayÂ» Ho J)oea Sot Want to See the Last
Hob the. Heil.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Ap-il 28.âSena
tor White said io The Call correspondent
to-night that he considered it a gross
discourtesy on the part of the Finance
Committee to even propose to report the
tariff bill to the Senate without first sub
mitting it to the minority. Senator White
said that thus lar the members of the
minority had not been given even an
inkling of its features. He was in the
dark as to the tar ff on California fruits
and oiner products, but be had been as
sured by Senator Jones of Nevada that
that gentleman would not vote to report
the bill to the Senate unless it was sub
mitted to the minority for their consid
eration.
The committee stands five to five, and
as Senator Jones holds the balance of
power it is settled that the minority will
be allowed to consider the bill before it s
renorted.
In explaining his position Mr. White
said that while he did not consider the
tariff bill a revenue measure at ail, but a
radical protective bill, to which he was
opposed on general principles, yet lie did
not propose to see California left out in u.e
cold.
He did not want to see the East rob the
West of any benefits that any euch meas
ure might bestow.

A LETTER FROM SHELDON.
The Disappearance of the Banker Is Fol
lowed by a Wholesale Financial
Wreck at Lcda.
CHICAGO, 111., April 23.â "1t is dis
grace and the penitentiary or the lake,
and I have chosen the latter," wrote John
Sheldon, banker, of Lotla, 11., to his con
fidential friend and attorney, John Moffett
of Paxion. The receipt cf the letter wa9
followed by the ciosinp; of the bank in
Loda, the assignment of four ieadine busi
ness firms and the individual assignments
of a number of leading citizens of the town.
Sheldon's money troubles involve funds
belonging to the school trustees and to
trust estates valued ac a quarter of h mil
lion dollars. A systematic police search
failed to reveal whether Sheldon has
drowned himself or not. The general lw
lief is that his body is in the lake.
The wreck was precipitated by a demand
of the heirs of the Sheldon estate here for
$30,000 realized a year ago, and their re
quest for a final accounting for approxi
mately $130,000. Sheldon was unable to
meet the demand last Friday with a hand
bag fu.l of securities, which he tried un
successfully to dispose of here. He then
wrote a twnty-page letter to his confi
dential friend, telling him he would take
his life by jumping into Lake Micnigan.

THE GOLDEN RULE.
Frank J. Murasky Explains the Doc
trine of tlm Catholic Church to Phil
Sheridan Council, Y. >'.. I.
There was a large audience in Mission
Opera Hall last evening on the occasion
of tlie lecture and entertainment given by
the Central Lecture Bureau, under the
auspices of Phil Sheridan Council No. 72,
Y. M. I.
Henry Pinkbam, president of the coun
cil, delivered a snort address explanatory
Â£f the organization.
The Misses Celia and Annie Tighe gave
a piano duet, after which Miss Mary C.
Spiliane rendered a soprano solo with
tine effect.
Frank J. Murasky, the lecturer of the
evening, was then introduced and spoke
lor sotuti time on 'Catbo.icisra and So
ciety." He told of the early history of
the world and dwelt ui>on the founding of
the Catholic church, which was a new re
ligion, having lor its doctrine, "Do unto
others as you would have others do unto
you." rie spoke of the manner in which
the new religion was carried into every
quarter of the globe and tilled it with the
light of a new hope. lie then told of the
work of the church in abolishing slavery,
not, be said, at one tell blow, but by con
stant preaching and agitation and tcliin?
those who were in power that they had no
right to hold either the souls or bodies of
men.
He dwelt upon the missionary work of
the Catholic church in every direction,
and said that its missionaries are ready to
attend the call if there is need.
Benevolence as practiced by the Catho
lic church to-day, he said, was unknown
to the ancient Romans and Greeks. Then
it was victory over the conquered, with
benevolence or charity, or sympathy, for
the unfortunate; but now, thanks to the
teaching of the church, sympathy goes
out for the oppressed Armenians, for the
Gretks IB their misfortunes, for the Cu
bans in their threat struggle, and he added
that in its work of benevolence the
Catholic church :a moving onward and
that no power on earth can stop it in that
work.
He then spoke of the duty of society in
assisting to spread the doctrine of the
church and maku its influence for good
felt on all sides.
The lecturer was warmly applauded,
and after be retiredlthere wa.Â« a vocal trio
by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Valeria and

A. McAuliffe. The committee of arrange
ments were: P. J. Whalpn, E. D. Sullivan

Gallagher.

Peculiar Methods of the
Ex-Treasurer of
Nebraska.
Took the Funds of the State
to Satisfy the Claim of
a Bank.
Also Allowed an Illegal Rate of In
terestâHis Shortage About
Half a Million.
OMAHA, Nebr . April 28.â The retiring
State Treasurer, Joseph Hartley, was ar
rested to-Qay by tiie Sheriff of this county,
charged with embezzling $201,000, the
proceeds of a State warrant which he sold
to the Chemical National 13ank of New
York while he was Treasurer, it was ne
gotiated through the Omaha National
Bank:. The Attorney-General swore to
the complaint.
Bartley is at present out on bonds for a
shortage of $500,000 in State funda. The
proceeds were transferred to Bartley, upon
whose books, however, no account of the
reoeipt of the money has been found. In
time the Chemical National Bank re
turned the warrant to the Omaha Na
tional Bank of this city for collection. la
response to this call the State Treasurer
proceeded to deposit State funds in the
Omaha National Bank until the sum of
$201,000 was on deposit. This was the
amount of the warrant, together with
interest at the rate of 7 per cent. With
th;s money the warrant wÂ«s duly taken
up and the accruing interest was paid.
When the warrant was collected by the
New York bank through the local bans it
was paid by check, to which Bariley
signed his own name. The $201,000 was
therefore on deposit in his name, al
though it is alleged to have been State
money.
In connection with the case Hartley is
accused of having allowed an illegal rate
of interest on the warrant. According to
the State iaw warrants cannot draw more
thau 5 per cent interest, but the Chemical
National Bank collected 7 per cent for tbe
entire tirre it advanced tbe money on the
warrant. Bartley will be arraigned at
Omaba.

GUTHRIE. O. T., April 28.-A great
flood swept down Cottonwoo I River Val
ley this morning at daylight and toppled
over hundreds of dwellings like so many
cardboards. Two thousand homeless peo
ple are shivering on the blurts west of the
city to-night or housed in homes on the
high Rrouiid. A hundred or more persons
have been drowned and thousands have
lost all.
The flood swept through the residence
part of this city. From noon yesterday
till midnight last night there was an in
cessant downpour or ra:n, and it was
ieared that the Cottonwood River, al
ready very high, would do much damage.
But t: c watchers were surprised to see
the river go down, and by daylight it had
fallen ten feet. Just as they were about
to go off duty at 6 o'clock they were
startled by a terrific roar from the river
in the valley.
A fire alarm was given and policemen j
and others rode all over town rousing
people anJ warning them to flee. Some j
thousht the roar was that of a cyclone ,
and sought the caves, only to perish a j
few minutes later. Others stopped to i
save things until it was too late, while i
many climbed trees.
With a mighty roar the flood came
down the valley, a mile Wide and twenty
ieet deep in the channel.
Ey 0 o'clock the water was thirty feet j
above the normal level of the river, and
the once placid stream was a raging tor
rent across tha entire valley. It seemed I
that soon the people in trees and on the |
roofs would be Â»wepi away.
George Willis and H. A. Platt, botn
prominent younsr business men, stripped
and leaped into the torrent. ThÂ«y swam
the main channel and secured an old Hat
boat which they moored to a tree.
With this they rescued e-ix persons from
the tree?, but were nearly swept away
themseive9. With the boat they saved
over thirty people.
Eugene Gill and Walter Olds attempted
to save a family on a raft, but were car
ried away and barely escaped. George
Owen, a butcher, hoaded a rescue party in
a hastily constructed fiatboat. The boat
capsized and he died a hero's death.
Scores cf men were at work at the
lumber-yards constructing boats, and by
10 o'clock six scows had been launched.
Several capsized and were carried away,
and two of the men manning them per
ished.
At 10 o'clock the flood was at a stand
still, Haif an hour later it began to re
cede, and by dark it had gone down five
feet. Many nezroes perished.
In the valley running through the west
ern part of the city is much of the finest
residence part and a smail business section
where there were about twenty stores,
several mills, warehouses, etc Lesa than
tweniy minutes from the time the flood
struct the city this entire section was in
undated, and within an hour the water
was ten feet deep and hundreds of build
ings were floating away.
Not only the meaner structures, but
fine residences, store buiidincs, a lsrgo
cotton-gin and other structures collapsed
or float' d down the stream. On many of
the buildings were men, women and chil
dren. From hundreds of tree< came pite
ous calls for help, and the a.r was hide
ous wi:h the struggles and screams of
domestic animals.
With the first rush went every bridge in
the city. The few boats were crushed or
carried away and nothing couid be done
to helD the many who fell or were swept
from places of refuge and drowned before
the ejes of the powerless spectators.
This eveiiing & line was snot across with
a rocket and a cable put up across the
channel.
Boats are now being lerried back ar.d
forth and food being taken to hundreds
of fam>lied people on the west bluffs and
200 or 300 negroes in a large brick school
house.
It is impossible to correctly estimate the
number of drowned, and the real facts
will nut be known lor days. Many were
seen to i>erish by falling from the trees or
being swep; from trees or rafts.
Eight or ten went down with one bridge
and four with another, while some are
known to have been caught in their houtas
and drowned. It is generally conceded
that the death list will reach 100.
Mrs. Ella Dumas fell from a floating
house, and Frank Myers was crushed by a
loc. Daniel Ciemmons ana his family of
six were swept into tne channel.
Mrs. Wesley McGiil and her four chil
dren were drowned ii their home. Mrs.

bo.iy of Miss Kiser, a school teacher, was
recovered to-night. A daughter of Mrs.
George Wrisrht and tjyo children were
drowned while trying to reach the hills.
The property loss is fully $100,000 in the
city nnd will reach hundreds of thousands
in ihe country. Up and down the Cotton
wood Valley for many miles everything is
swept away, and it is believed that many
more people perished in the country. All
business was suspended, the stores and
banks closed, and everybody gave atten
tion to the wors of rescue.
The wagon bridges at Crescent City and
Perkins and or.c north of here have al
ready gone, hundreds of families are in
undated in its valley and much live stock
is drowned.
While t c rise was due to the general
rise at Cottonwood a cloudburst at 4
o'clock this morning near Seward, south
west of here, caused the great flood to
sweep down the valley.
A number of bodies have been seen
eoing down the Cimarron and to-night
calls are heard for help. Another rescue
boat capsized iaie this evening and one of
ihe rescuers was drowned.

FROM OAKDALE TO SONORA.
Bunders of ihe New Railroad Express
Themselves as Pleased With the
Finished Portion.
OAKDALE, Cal., April 28â Prince
Poniatowski. W. H. Crocker, T. S. Bul
lock of the Sierra Railroad, S. Sussman,
F. G. Perine and A. Rossi, a wealthy
banker of Paris, arrived in town to-day
on a special car of the Sierra Railroad,
which was sent out six miles to meet them
on their return from Sonora.
Prince PoniatowsKi, who is with W. H.
Crocker, is largely interested in mining i:i
Calaveras, Tuolumne and Manposa coun
ties, ana is also one of the iea<ling pro
moters In tt:e new Sierra Railroad which
is now being built from Oakdale to Sonora.
He inspected the finished portion of the
new railroad carefully and expressed him
self as being highly pleased.
In his opinion mining has resolved itself
into a question of handling low-grade
ores successfully, and this cannot be done
without better transportation facilities.
It is this proposition which has cau-ed
the Prince to become associated with
Messrs. Bullock and Freanman in the
movement to build a railroad from Oak
dale to the 8' uthern mines. The fact that
he is connected with the road, he says,
does not mean that it is in any way a part
of the Southern Pacific. The new road is
being built because the neects of the min
ing counties require it and it is to be inde
pendent of any other corporation.
The party left here this evening, by way
of Stockton, on a special train for San
Francisco.

IAN MACLAREN TRIUMPHS OVER HIS CRITICS.
LONDON, Ehg , April 28.â The annual synod of the Presbyterian Church of Eng
land opened here on Monday. More than usnal interest attached to the proceedings,
owing to the fact that it was proposed by certain members to have tne synod make
Inquiry into the alleged heterodoxy of Dr. John Watson (lan Maclaren). The opdo
nents of Dr. Watson bnd prepared a petition setting forth wherein he had departed
from the teneti ot the Presbyterian church and quoting his publications to prove their
contention. The petition declared:
'If such statements (those quoted) are allowed to pass without any disavowal or
explanation on the part of Watson, or any notice of thorn on the part of tae church,
the result will be most disastrous to the spiritual life of the church and also eventu
ally to its outward progress and prosperity."
The petition was nnsented to the synod, which turned it over to a business corc
mitlee. This c >mmittee considered the matter and to-day decided not to recommend
the acceptance of the petition by the syncd.

NEW YORK, N. V., April 28.âDema
gogu?. bought at August Belmont's sale
last fall, ran away after winning the
fourth race at Aqueduct racetrack to
day. Passing his ncla on striking the
homestretch he opened up a gap of six
lengths. At this point he swung over to
the extreme outside, and Jockey Henry
Martin, the clever young Cal ifornian, had
hard work preventing him from crashine
into the betting-ring inclosure and
finally the judges' box. The colt won by
four lengths.
Then Demagogue made for the outside
fence at the paddock turn, unseated his
jockey, smashed through the balustrade
and barbed wire and then galloped around
the track for a mile and a half.
Martin was very badly lacerated and
wan carried to the secretary's ottice and
later to His home. It is expected he will
not be in the saddle again for a fortnight.
itiley Grannan obtained an injunction
from Judge Madox in Brooklyn to-day

STRIKE OF GAS
IN SACRAMENTO
Residences Supplied by
Well on Front
Street.
Important Discovery Which
the Finders Failed to
Keep Secret.
A Seemingly Inexhaustible Flow
Within the Limits of the
Capital City.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. April 28.âNat
ural gas in large quunities and marvel
ously pure lias been struck in this city,
and for several weeks the fact has been
kepi so secret tliat not over a dozen per
sons throughout Sacramento are cogni
zant of it. The strike was made at front
and V streets, and already the gas is being
piped to surrounding residences, whose
owners are to have free use of it lor a cer
tain period, wltli the proviso that they say
nothing until the discoverers formulate
their plans ior its distribution throughout
the city.
So quietly is the work being done that
the boring machine is inclosed in a bouse,
which is carefully locked, and in addition
a high board fence surrounds the plant to
keep out inquisitive visitors.
Two years ago a local company was
formed to sink for gas, and after going
down several huudred feet without meet
ing with any success it broke a drill,
failed to extract it and abandoned the en
terprise. Last summer a Stockton com
pany was lormed and began boring on the
present site, and it has met with the
greatest success.
A man who was admitted to the enclos
ure one day this week says the gas was
turned on under the boiler of the engine
that operates the boring machine; then
it was ignited, and In twenty-eiyht min
utes the gauge showed sixty pounds of
steam.
It i-. claimed that gas in small quanti
ties was discovered several weeks ago, and
the man in cnarce ot lie work has been
heating his house with it ever since and
using it for cooking purposes.
It is impossible to leUrn the exact depth
at which the larger body of gas was struck,
but it is rumored that the well is down
some 000 feet.
COMMODORES CAUSTIC.
There's a Social and Naval Tempest at
Sausalito Over the Mooring of
a Ycht.
SAUSALITO, Cal., April 28.âCom
modore Billings of the San Francisco
Yacht Club has his trim little craft moored
off the railroad wharf at this place, and
the vessels of Uncle Sam's marine ser
vice, when they drop anchor off Sausalito,
are compelled to seek anchorage off old
Sausalito, which is not quite as convenient
as the location where Commodore Billings
has his yantil moored.
In consequence the oilicers complained*
When they visit the young ladies on the
bill tliry do not lilce 10 be compelled to
travel from the old town over dusty roads
to the mansion* near the sky, and when
they desire to go to the city for a night's
pleasure the journey from the vessel to
the ferry is quite a long one.
So trouble arose. Commodore C. H.
Harrison of Sausalito wrote a note to
Commodore Bllinps informing him of the
state of affairs and pointing out to him
that his yacht is sliiruily in the way.
Commodore Billings, according to the
story, wrote a reply, in which he stated
that he was quite pleased with the loca
tion of h-s craft. Commodore Harrison
wrote a sharp letter in reply.
The revenue cutters Rush and Bear, the
cruiser Petrel, the survey-boats McAr
thur, Gedney and Albaiross and other
vessels were compelled to steer clear of
the trim little craft owned by Commodore
Billings.
The Town Trustees last night showed
their hand in the matter. A resolution
was introduced by General John H. Dick
inson making it necessary for owners of
yachts to obtain permission from th*Â»
Board of Town Trustees as to the location
of moorings, and it will be passed at the
meeting to be held on next Monday nii'ht.
It is intended to compel Commodore Bil
lings to cliange the location of his
yacht-

Portland Street-Railway
Disaster Not Due to
Negligence.
Claim of Motorman Keiff Is
Eorne Out by an Inves
tigation.
Fourth Name Added to the List
of Those Who Lost Their
Lives.
PORTLAND, Ob.. April 28.â Another
death occurred to-day as a result of yester
day's frightful streetcar accident on the
east side. The victim was Michael Ben
ninger, an employe of the Oregon Furni
ture Company. Others of the injured are
not expected to survive.
With the raising of the wrecked car from
the bottom of the slouch last evening it
was indisputably shown that the derail
ment of the car, which led to the disaster
which has cost four lives, was caused by
the breaking of the axle of the left front
wheel on the forward track. With this
broken axle it was impossible to apply
the brakes with any force, and the stretch
of down crade still to be run before the
bridge was reached allowed the car to gain
great impetus. On reaching the planking
of the bridge the dragging of the lelt front
end of the car caused it to swerve in that
direction, with the result that it dashed
into the sidewalk, carried away the frail
railing and plunged into the slough below.
Motoraan Keiff insisted from the first
that it was a broken axle that caused the
derailment, and it is a source of sad con
gratulation to himself and to the City and
Suburban Railway officials to learn that
the moiorruan was corroborated by the
facts. '1 he motorman was arrested on a
charge of manslaughter this afternoon,
but was released on bonds.

ENDS HIS OWN CAEEER IN A
NEARBY BARN.
Failure of His Suit for the Girl's
Hand Had Driven Him to
Madness.
FRESNO, Cal., April lÃ.â Mad with an
unrequited love James Brooks sought in
a mos; tragic manner the life of pretty
Neoma Quails at her home, sixteen miles
east of this city last night. The young
lady's mother appearing upon the scene
the desperate man tried to murder her
also. After he had shot and wounded the
girl he adored Brooks' nerve gave way,
and in response to her appeals he spared
her, although he was holding a hatchet
over her head ready to to strike a fatal
blow. But, in accordance with the plan
he had probably mapped out, the wretch
ran to a barn about three-quarters of a
mile distant and ended bis own existence.
The bay took lire from the discharge of
the gun with which be shot himself, and
to-day his charred remains were found in
the ruins of the buiiding.
Brooks' purpose was to enact a tragedy
which would have been one of the most
awful ever perpetrated in the history of
the State. It was about 2 o'clock in the
morning when he stole into the home of
the Quails, where mother and daughter
were sleeping. He hacJ been at the house
the evening before and ascertained that
Mr. Quails and his two grown sons were
away in the mountains and that the
ladies were at home alone and without
protection. Going to their bedroom doois,
lie sbot at them with a shotgun as they
sprang, startled, from their beds. His aim
was poor and he hit them in the arm*.
Miss Quails' injury is not serious, but her
mother's condition is dangerous because
of loss of blood.
The cause of Brooks' desperate act was
an insane love be possessed for the young
Jady, who is a very handsome blonde of
19 years. He has worked as a laborer for
the cast six years in tbe vicinity, and
about two years ago he was employed at
the Qualis ranch. It was then that he
formed an ardent love for the girL
She rejected all his proffered attentions.
Only once did she ever accept an invita
tion to go riding with him. Learning
what the man's intentions were she re
fused after that to nave anything to do
with him. He remained at the ranch for
several months, but his persistent efforts
to gain the friendihip of the girl finally
became so unbearable that her father dis
charged him.
Brooks refused to leave, and for three or
four days he stayed around the rmncb
without food. He wou'd often come up
and sit on the rear porch of the house and
sulk for hours at a time.
Finally, after the man had refused to
heed the repeated orders to leave, David
Q-ialls, the girl's f : uher, attempted to
eject him forcibly. Brooks resisted and
made a threat that lie would kill the whole
family. The amhoritiej were then ap
pealed to and the laborer was sent to jail
to serve a sentence ior making the Hire
threat.
This had not the effect of dampsning
the mad Jove of the unfortunate man. As
soon as he was released from jail he re
turned to the community and went to
work on a ranch. Off and on he would
offer to pay attention to the young lady,
but she would have nothing to do with
him.
It was not until last evening that Brooks
made any further demonstration. About
6:30 o'clock he drove up to the home of
Miss Quails in a buggy. Tieing his horse
at tbe barn, he walked into the house,
â where the girl and her mother were ai
work in tbe kitchen. Being alone at
home they became somewhat alarmed at
his appearance. They invited him to
have supper, but he refused, saying that
he had already eatet;.
A Call representative to-day visited the
scene of Brooks' rash attempts, and Miss
Quails made the following statement, she
mill being up, although her wound pained
her considerably :
"While we were ali in the kitchen Mr.
jJrooks asked me to go riaing with him.
I told him I could not do so, but he in
sisted in a coaxing manner. I positively
refused, and after we had been talking
back and forth several minutes mother
â¢aid we had better go into the sitting
room. Tnen Mr. Brooks said he would go
home, and started out of the house. In
the yard he met my little brother, to
whom he remarked, "1 "guess Â«he'll talk to
me the next time I come.' While he wa
in the kitchen talking with us mother
said that she expected to take a trip East
this summer, and Mr. Brooks mad* the
peculiar remark that he did not think she
would be able to go.
"After the man left we were frightened.
There was no one here other than mother
and I and three children. Before retiring
wÂ« fastened all the doors except the rear
one, on which the lock was broken. 'We
placed a chair against tnia and weighted
it down.
"At about 2 o'clock this morning I heard
the rear door being pushed open, the
cbair making considerable noise in scrap
ing on the floor. Then I heard some one
enter. The door of my bedroom was open
to the sitting-room, into which the man
entered. We bad left a light burning in
the sitting-room, and when I arose in bed
I saw Mr. Brooks standing in the noor
way of my room. He had a lantern in
his left hand and a shotgun in bis right.
Pausing a minute he raised the gun and
pointed it at me, ami I began begcin* him
not to shoot. Ho announced that he had
come to kill me because I would not
settle with him. I implored him noc to
kill mf.
"Mother, who was in the adjoining bed
room, heard us talking and was awakened.
She recognized Mr. Brooks' voice, and
th<-n she knew that our fears of the even
ing before were realized. She jumped
from bed and I heard her screaming, 'Oh!
oh! 1
"She then tried to get out of the win
dow. It was fastened and she tried to
break it. She broke the panes out with
her hands, but the sash wouid not yield.
Mr. Brooks then stepped to the door of
her room, which was also open, and told
her to come back. There being no way to
get out. she obeyed his command and ad
vanced toward him. When she was about
three feet distant lroui him he fired. Tbe
charge tore away the under portion of her
left forearm and a few scattering shot
lodged in her breast. She then ran past
him ana out the rear door, which was
standing open a; he had 'ett it.
"The man hud set iii-s lantern on the
floor, and after firing at mother reloaded
thegun. Then he stepped to my bedroom
door I was still s.tting up in the bed,
screaming and not knowing what to do.
He advanced a fpw step 3 toward me.
'Say yor.r prayer.-!' he commanded. At
tho same time he raised the gun and dis
charged it :it me, tbe ?hot taking effect
just above my lett wrist. I fell over and
lost consciousness for a minute.
"When I revived, Air. Brooks was stand
ing over me. pointing the muzzle of the
gun at me. 1 sprang from the bed, intend
ing to make an attempt to run away. He
then changed the gun to his left hand,
and with Jus right whipped out a hatchet.
He stopped me and held the instrument
over my bead, with the stern injunction,
'Don't you run.'
"My memory is a blank after that until
Mr. Brooks "and I reached the yard
together. How we got there, 1 do not
know. The next thine I remember we
were standing out near the rear porch. 'I
have hurt you, and I will be hanped for it,'
I heard Mr. Brooks say. 'Yes,' I replied,
'let me go and get my arm oandaged.'
Then the man laid his head on my shoul
der and cried, sobbing that he was sorry
that he had shot me. He kissed me, and
said he could not bear to see me go with
Frank Hutchings. I said nothing, but
only begged him to let me go. He finally
released his bold of me and went to the
rear of the house. I saw nothing more of
him.
"I ran out to the gate and down the
driveway to the public road. About ISO
yards from the house I found mother
lying at the side of the road, sobbing and
crying. She had tried to get to some
neighbors, but fell exhausted on the way.
1 stopped with ber a moment and then
ran to the place of William T. Burnett, a
neighbor, screaming all the way. I called
for help, and Mr. Burnett, Frank Hutch
ings and Elmer Smith, who were there,
responded. I ran back 1o where mother
was. The men arrived a few minutes later
and on a sled conveyed us back here to
the house.
"This is an awful affair, and I am not
over ihe shock yet," continued the young
lady. "I could not accept any of the at
tentions Mr. Brooks tried to pay me, as he
was very repulsive to me. I tried always
to treat him kindly, but nothing further."
The young lady told her story very in
telligently. She is quite a belle in the
district in which she resides. She is
pretty, and very ladylike in her manners.
When Mrs. Quails ran past t'-e mur
derous fiend a:nl out of the house she
starred for Mr. Burnett's house to get as
sistance. Her wound bled profusely, and
she hail proceeded only about half the
distance to the place, when she fell ex
hausted. She managed to crawl to the
side of the road, and remained thereuntil
found by her daughter. She is an eideriy
iady, and the excitement and the run
ning also told severely upon her.
It is supposed that Broofcs took the trail
leadi.ig through a erain Geld to a barn
owned by Mr. Quails, about three-quarters
of a mile distant from the house.
When the neighbors had made Mrs.
Quails and Miss Quails as comfortable as
ttiey could ia the bedrooms where a few
moments bafore they had gone through
such an awiu! experience they began look
ing around for the would-be murderer.
About a half-hour later they saw the fire
at the barn, and immediately came to the
conclusion thai Brooks had starteu it.
Hutchinjis remained at the house, while
the other two proceeded to the barn.
They suspected that the desperate man's
remains might be in the ruins, but on ac
count of the heat could make no investi
gation.
They returned to the house, and with
Hutchings began to make investigations
with the aid of the lantern. Here they
fourd evidence of another insane attempt
of Brooks to destroy the girl and her
mother.
The fiend had tried to set the house on
fire directly under the window of Miss
Quails' bedroom. He bad poured kero
sene on the boards and applied a match.
The lire charred the wall over a space
about a foot in diameter and also burned
a hole through; but the blaze had died
out, and it is supposed that after faihng in
this way to effect his evil work he entered
the house for the more bold proceeding of
snooting the women.
This forenoon the chaned remains of
Brooks were discovered in the ruins of the
uarn. The shotgun was pointing upward
above the ashes, and what there was of
the man was found at its side.
His hatchet was also at his side, the
handle having been burned out. Coroner
Long held an inquest to-day, and the jury
arrived at the conclusion that Brooks hrst
shoe himself and that the discharge
ignited the hay where he had chosen to
end hi- life.
Dr. Jacobi of Centerville was called to
attend the two injured women. He found
Mrs. Quails' condition serious, she having
lost a great deal of blood. The shot had
carried away the fleshy part of her arm
on one side. The doctor hopes for her re
covery, but has given orders that she be
closely confined to her room. He dressed
Miss Quails' wound with bandage*, and it
will heal in a few weeks.
David Quails and his family are p'oneer
residents of Fresno County. Miss Quails
was born on a ranch about a mile distant
from their present home. The family is
Well to do and well connected. Little has
been learned as yet of James Brooks' his
tory. He was always considered a strange
individual, being of a very suspicious dis
position. He was a native of Indiana and
30 years of ape. It was not ascertained to
day where he procured the shotgun with
which he tried to commit the two terrible
murders and with which he ended hi3own
career.
Messengers have been sent after Mr.
Quails and his sons, who are o.ncaged in
planting corn at their foothill ranch.

Grand Parlor Delegates
Gaze Upon Fine
Horses.

by Students.
Impromptu Picnic at Mer.lo Park
Concludes a Pleasant
Outing.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 23.â The
Native Sons representing the order in
Grand Parlor had an enjoyable outing
this afternoon as a diversion from dry
discussion on grievances and points of or
der. In buses, surreys, four-in-hand?,
double rigs and tingle rig 3 the procession
started from the Aluambra shortly after 1
o'clock. The column was headed by Ron
covieri's baui in a band - wason. The
fine residences of Menlo were seen, the
grounds inspected and the occupants sa
luted with strains of music.
In the quadrangle of Stanford Univer
sity, where the column halted, the band
played, and the students cheered and
sought to "josh" Finley Cook of Berke
ley, who proved to bo equal to the occa
sion. Another halt was made at the mu
seum of the university, and then the
party proceeded to the Palo Alto stock
iarm, where Fiank Covey, the superin
tendent, exhibited many of the horses of
great renown. He prefaced the exhibi
tion with a few remarKs of tribute to the
memory of Governor Stanford, which
brought cheers from the Native Sons.
Flambean, Advertiser, Dexter Prince,
Pico, Beautiful Bells, Rosamond, Laura
C. Lulu Wilkes aud other horses of note
were trotted out. Advertiser was men
tioned as the horse that Governor Stan
ford had been offered $150,000 for. A
great send-off was given to DÂ«-xter Prince.
Covey said the horse was owned by Adolph
Spreckels, one of ti.e ureatest Native Sens
in the State, end the crowd cheered to the
echo.
When a vote of thanks was properly
extended to Superintendent Covey the
procession, guided by "Jack" Scbroeder
and George ue GoJta, made a dash for
Kuck's Grove, where the Menlo Park Par
lor had arranged to give its guests the
giad hand and some sandwiches and
liquid cheer.
Grand President H. C. Gosford was met
la the suburbs of the town by a commit
tee. He was then escorted to an old
fashioned rig drawn oy a muie of a nre
vious decade and a horse of uncertain age.
H. C. Hall gave to President Gesford the
keys of the town. Gesford accepted the
gift and became the possessor of the keys
without a lawsuit to question bis title
thereto.
The Menlo committee, consisting of M.
E. Doyle. Frank Roach, Bert Clute, F. \V.
Kugler and D. E. O'Keefe, gave the Native
Sons a great welcome, and cheer after
cheer was triven in the grove for Menlo
Parlor No. 185. The grove and the avenues
leading to the treea were tastefully deco
rated in honor of the Grand Parlor's visit.
The run home from Menlo Park to Red
wood was a free-for-all three-mile dash
and many fine bursts of speed were made
on the way, while the band played on.
It is lucky that no vehicles were wrecked.
The drivers of the four-in-hands were
highly complimented for their skill. The
only mishap during the day was the
smashing of a surrey wheel at the Stan
lord stockfarm.
At the session of the Grand Parlor this
nfiernoon a telegram from Grand Vice-
Pre?ident George D. Clark waÂ« read. He
announced sickness as the cause of non
attendance.
A, reso'ution calling for an appropria
tion of $2500. to be invested in I'SGO shares
in Mission Parlor bui:ding, met with an
adverse report and the report was adopted.
The Bajnry of the grand secretary was,
Dy resolution, fixed at $2.-JOO per annum.
The committee on >tate of the order
recognized the Sloat monument at Mon
terey in the following recommendation:
We recommend that the request of the Sloat
Monument Association for tiie Native Sons of
the Go. den West to furnish a stone with suit
able inscription thereon to bo placed In the
base of the Sloat monument, be complied
with, and we further recommend that the In
coming board of prand trustees be instructed
to furnish said stone.
Tha report was adopted.
The stirring State song, "Hail Califor
nia," composed by Josephine Gro, was by
resolution' referred to the ritual commit
tee, witn a reccommendation that it be in
corporated In the ritualistic work of the
order.
James L. Gallacher moved that the ac
tion taker, yesterday abolishing the office
of second grand vice-president b9 recon
sidered. On motion of James P. Dockery
the whole subject matter was made a
special order ior 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning.
The election of officers of the Grand
Parlor will take place to-morrow, and the
chief interest to-night centered in the con
t-st of Frank L. Coombs of Napa and
Judge Rust of Amador for grand orator.
The frltnds of Coombs claim tnat he is
steadily gaining. Judge Davis, who is
conducting the campaign for Judge Rust,
is as sanguine as ever that the Amador
orator will win the prize.
The event of the Native Sons' celebra
tion in the estimation of the youih and
beauty of this end of -San Mateo County
was the bill at the pavilion to-night. The
interior of the structure waÂ« profusely but
artistically <iecorated in pink, blue" and
soft tint-. Many representative society
people were in attendance. The grand
march at 9:30 o'clock was led by Grand
Presi'teiit llenrv C. Gesford of Napa and
Miss Turner of Redwood City.

FIRST REST IN YEARS.
Chief Engineer McClure of the
Peking Will Take
Vacation.
Mrs. and Miss McClure Will Accom
pany Him to England and
Thence to Paris.
Chief Engineer William McClure. one
of the most popular and efficient oilicors
in the employ of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, is, after thirty -three years
of continuous service, about to take a va
ontion. The corporation has granted him
live months' leave of absence and he leaves
next Sunday for England and the conti
nent, accompanied by his wife and daugh
ter.
Mr. McClure came here as water-tender
on the old line steamer Colorado. He had
served his time and had graduated as an
engineer, but never having been to sea he
had to start at the lowest rung in the en
gine-room. When he left New York it
was only with the intention of making the
trip to San Francisco and buck again, but
an offer of an "assistant's" job on the Sac
ramento kept him here. When the St.
Louis came out Air. McClure was trans
ferred to her and later he went to the
Montana. While on the latter steamer he
was granted a few days leave of absence
and while he was away the steamer turned
over and sank alongside the dock. It was
a co miii on saying on the beach at the time
that tne "Montana went down out of
grieving over the Joss of Bili McClure, If
even only for a few days."
The raising of the Montana occupied
three months, and wiien the job was com
pleted Mr. McClure made one trip in her
and then joined the Alaska. Then be was
transferred to the Dakota, taer.ce to the
Granada, ieaving toe latter one trip before
she was lost to join the City of Pekin?, with
which steamer he has been ever since.
During his thirty-three years of con-

has never hau but one accident to report,
and tlint was no fault of his. On January
22, 1893. wn en 1.540 miles off San Kran
ci;-co, the shaft of the City of Peking
broke off close to the sternpost and tha
big ocean-liner was disabled. Time and
again the engineer and his assistants at
tempted to dislodge the huge wheel
which was proving a terrible drag to tne
vessel, but tailed. All sail was set, and
after being given up as lost the Peking
finally reached- the Farallones and was
towed into port.
Mr. McClure wiil on his return resume
hii old duties on the City of Petine.
During his absence Chief Engineer J.
Stevenson will act for him. The boys on
the big steamer will sadly miss him, as be

SMALLPOX ON THE
EMPRESS OF CHINA
The Yellow Flag Floats
Over the Oriental
Steamship.
Arrives at Vancouver With
Two Sick Chinamen
on Board.
Passengers and Crew Ordered Into
Quarantine for Fourtoen
Days.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 28.â The
Canadian Pacific Railway Company's
steamer Empress of China arrived in port
yesterday floating an ominous yellow flag,
as a signal thai there was smallpox
aboard. In spite of this fact the steamer
Maude, having on board the usual crowd
of hotel runners, newspaper men and
Government officials, put off to meet her.
Dr. Watt, the Government Health Officer,
mounted the deck of the big white, liner
and motioned the crowd back. No one
but J. A. Fullerton, reprcsentine the Can
adian Pacific Railway, was allowed on
board. Watt is a new appointee of the
new Government, and he at once showed
that he meant business by telephoning to
Victoria that the crew, cabin passengers
and coolies must be kept at the quarantine
station for fourteen full days and comply
with the law as far as fumigation, baths
and change of clothing is concerned, and
any one coming in contact with the
steamer would also be detained.
This news caused great consternation on
board, as more than 1000 passengers â
some of them titled aristocrats, and
proudâ would have to be housed in small
qnarters, like stock in a pen, the accom
modations being inadequate at the sta
tion, while the big siiip was fumigated
from stem to stern. One dignitary, the
Marquis of Bredalbain, an English Privy
Councilor, is compelled to submit to the
common fate with the mo:ley crowd.
All are victims of an accident, for in in
specting 700 Cninese who boarded the
steamer in the Orient the doctors were
most rigid in their examinations, but
two succeeded in passing their prac
ticed eye â two in which the germs of dis
ease were lurking.
The China is loaded to her fullest ca
pacity, and has on board 110 cabin pas
sengers, a crew of 200 and some 7uo China
menâ2oo bound for Victoria and the rest
for various destinations on the mainland.
Dr. Watt states that the steamer can
not rroceed to her distributing point in
Vancouver until every man of the crew is
replaced by a fresh one, and even then
not until three days have elapsed. Tnis
is a serious problem for the Canadian Pa
cific Kailway to solve. The crew cannot
be replaced in that time, and those two
sick Chinamen are responsible lor more
inconvenience and financial loss, directly
and indirectly, than any railway would
care to have repeated a second time.
The detained passengers are complain
ing louilly of inadequate accommodation
and the authorities nave yielded to the ex
tent of chartering the staamer Islander
for a floating bedroom for at least the
women who are involuntary guests of the
Canadian Government.
JAKE RUDOLPH INSANE.
Acquitted of a Charge of Murderous
Assault and Sent to an Asylum.
Jake Rudolph, charged with attempt to
murder for shooting Harry Leslie several
months ago. was tried in Judge Wallace's
court yesterday, and a verdict of "not
guilty on account of the defendant's in
sanity" was promptly returned.
Following are tne names of the jury
men: E. O. Tuttle, Geore* Snyder J G
Hicker, George H. Hopne, George R 'Rich
mond, A. N. Grant, Victor Andler Wil
liam J. Smith. Louis A. Grade, Rudolph
11. Hahn, Fra:iÂ£ McAleer, Horace B An
ge!l.
After the verdict was recorded Judge
Wallace asked what was to be done about
the question or the prisoner's continue.;
ltv-anity. an' the delendant's attorneys
offered to submit the matter to the same
jury, which was accordingly done and a
verdict was given that Rudolph' is still
crazy and dan crous to be at large. He
was committed to the insane asylum at
Stockton.
Rudolph was very quiet in v is dr meaner.
and it is not believed that bis insanity
will be of great duration. He is expected
back to his usual haunts in this City within
a few months.

MME. BISHOP'S FAREWELL
The First Annual Music Festi
val Comes to an
End.
An Undertaking Tbat Loses Money,
but Has Good Artistic
Results
At the matinee of the California Music
Festival Association iti Metropolitan Hall
Mrue. Genevra Johnstone-Bishop proved
that she is as great a mistress of operatic
music as she is of oratorio, and that as a
lyric singer tne beauty and lightness of
her touch is marvelous*.
In the grand aria from "Dsr Freischutz"
Mme. Bishop beautifully expressed the
various emotions which succeed each
other in the heroine's mmd â the hope,
the prayer and the expectation. Her
other songs, being varied in character,
were equally well rendered. Bach's
"Evermore Lost to Me," a toucning
lament, was as sweet and sad as "La
Zingara" was bright and dashing.
Bernhard Mollenhauer evoked warm ap
plause for his playing of Leon D. Saint
Lubin's violin fantasia in "Lucia Di Lam
mermoor," which was extremely well ren
dered.
Miss Cook,- who accompanfod Mme.
Bisnop, played several pianoforte solos
charmingly.
The Elude by Rubinstein and Liszt's
Rossignol were especially brilliant. Ho
mer Henley sane a song composed by J.
H. Howe, "Tne Sea," a bright ami breezy
little composition, and "is Not His
Word" (from the "Elijah"). The latter
suits Henley's voice and he sang very well.
There was a much better attendance
last night than on the opening evening,
and no doubt if the festival could be pro
longed for several days it would attract
large audiences. Unfortunately, how
ever, last night's was tue closing per
formance, and there will be no chance of
hearing Mine. .Bishop again ti.is season,
as her bookings compel hereto continue
her tour at once. i
Mme. Bishop was in splendid voice
again last night and showed'herself very
complaisant in respondine to encores.
She sang Chaminade's "Sleep, Little RosÂ»
bud" and Kootnner's "If My Love Were
Like a Flower" with exquisite expression,
and she was equally at home in an aria
from Massenet's "Cid." By special re
quest one of Mme. Bishop's encores was
"I Know That My Redeemer Liveth."
Tne chorus repealed its former success
last nisht. It sang "Ail Men Praise,"
from Mendelssohn's "Hymn of Praise";
the "Intiarnmatus," "from Rossini's
"Stabat Mater," in which Mme. Bishop
gave the solo and "Remember Now Thy
Creator," a short cantata by J. Hamilton
Howe, who conducted.
Mr. Howe's cantata contained some
very attractive music, and it was crisply
and effectively sung by tne chorus.
Homer Henley rendered tun solos and the
quartet was aung by Miss Grace A. Sabin,
Mrs. Homer Henley and Messrs. Cran
dall and Henley. Mrs. T. Murdock, the
accompanist to the association, did ex
cellent work, and Henry Bretherick made
the best of the poor organ.
Miss Cook played Beveral piano solos
with a good deal of virtuosity, particu
larly "The King's Hunting Jig,"" by John
Bull, an English composer of the Eliza
bethan period.
Mrs. Homer Henley, whose rich con
tralto voice tilled the hall well, sane an
'Aye Maria" by J. H. Howe and a ' 'Macl
NEW TO-DAY.

| NIGHT VISIONS
Are disagreeable to the mind and body
of lhÂ« worn-out man. They come to
men who are mentally and physically
weak. They are sometimes accom-
panied by night sweats, falsa dreams
and extreme wearisoiuenjis.
NIGHT VISIONS
Have a cause, a root or a main reason.
Unless you go to the exact first causa
end root out the evil you will find it
difficult to cure. Now, one of the prin-
cipal causes for
NIGHT VISIONS
Is dissipation. It may bo overwork or
over-harassing the nerves, but nearly
every one of these cases has been
brought down to plain abuse. If you
abuse your brain, your nerves, your
muscles, your body, you may expect all
kinds of "curious things to happen to
you. .
NIGHT VISIONS
May be brought rri by overloading the
stomach, overstudy, worry or a secret
disease, op a secret trouble, that dis-
tutbs the nerve centers in the brain.
Excesses usunlly rob the blood of its
rich, red b'ooJ corpuscles. Then the
eniire system is weakened. When the
brain is disordered thÂ« poor victim of
his own folly Hilda himself all tied up
In a knot. He is irritable and irre-
sponsible.
Hi; finds pleasure in no earthly en-
deavor. He shuns society, is a victim
of morose thoughts and of bad habits;
he i< ses sleep at nieht, awakes unre-
freshel; feels like a baa man, but has
no courage to be bad ; feels vicious, but
lacks the vim and vitality of a vicious
man. In these cases the best thing lor
yon to do is to use the great remedy-
treatment
HUD VAN.
. This remedy-treatment has proved
itself to be a great blessing to human-
ity. It has B wed many a hollow-
crieekeJ victim from the horrors of
imbecility and from trie lowest walk of

men. It cures innn of his weakness.

I hereby promise to have my
thoughts, my habits and deeds iurh
that my State and Nation will be some
what repaid for my education. And I
will be a worthy citizen of the United
States.
Such is the pledge Mary Newberry
Adams would have each little toddler
take simultaneously with his enrollment
in the public schools of this City. Sand
wiched in between the alobabet and first
attempts at unit computation she would
have the little ones taught that the State
is simply advancing them an education;
that at the very outset of life they are
debtors to their City. That there may be
no possibility of the children forgetting
their debt Mrs. Adams would suggest
"taking vows at each epoch in their edu
cation with appropriate ceremonies."
This was one of the startling thsories
evolved at yesterday's â¢eÂ»sion of the
Woman's Congress â a session quite the
most eicitine of this convention of '97.
And to the women belongs all the credit
cf it, for during the morning and after
noon session there was not :v man speaker
on the floor. In lact, every one seemed
de:igbtfu:ly oblivious of the fact that there
was a male population. Dr. Beecher for a
moment deviated from the narrow path of
virtue and said "man," but she quickly
redeemed herself by explaining, "When I
E3\' man I mean woman."
Seven papers were read â some pood,
some bad and some indifferent. Hut even
the best address paled into insignificance
before this wondrous factâ the Woman's
Congress has developed a beauty, a
beauty of the Gibson type. Tall and fair,
with nair like spun gold and the broad,
low brow of a Grecian goddeiÂ«. And >he '
read a paper, an excellent paper, "The
Commonplace Woman." There were
some bitter truths in it about "cacklers
and ebriekers and the short irizzed-hair
spectacled suffragist." But so clear was ;
Miss Lyle's exposition, so neatiy turned
l.er iogx, that even the spec;acied dele
gation espoused Ler cause and explained,
"You owe it to us. shriekers and caCrders,
the fact that you may stand there in ail
your beauty and read your well-written
\a: ers before an audience of intelligent
thinkers such as this."
The congress tired another of its great
guns when it frowned aown the poster
craze, the colored edition and dialect
verse. The poster and the gaudy Sunday
magazine supplement were declared to
foster in children the love of vulear dis
play and destroy their love of a harmoni
ous and beau i:ul whole. Mis? Cooluritb,
the poetess, declared against the dialect
verse. "I: is a circus performance set to
music," she said, and the hearty applause
of the audience plainly indicateu their
sentiments on the latest literary fad.
Ihe feature of the morning session wa*
Misa A. M. Beecher, a cousin of me noted
divine. She ai once became a favorite by
reason of her native w;t and smart de
livery. Her compliment to California is
a worthy companion to Helen Gardener's
Tretty expression of praise. Saia Miss
Beecher:
'â¢1 was arfced how I liked California, and
I made answer, 'I Lave unpacked my
trunks and sent them to the baggage
room. 1 "
A strong plea was made by Miss Darrah
for the so-cal ed fads of the public school
system. Said the lady: "It is not educa
ton to stuff a iitiie one with reading,
v nting and arithmetic, but to fit the child
for the best that is in it. And ii i* by
means of these lads that we discover what
the best, is."
To-morrow evening Mrs. Gardiner will
deliver her famous address on "Heredity,"
and members of the association w:il*be
accorded tne advantage of gaining en
trance by th<? side door before the general
public is admitted. Â£ach member's life
ticket includes admission to a male es
cort. Anybody is eligible for membership

The third day of the Woman's Con
p-Â»sÂ« was given over to the discussion of
esthetics. ThiÂ« topic of the beautiful
served to introduce a new speaker to San
i-'rancisco, Dr. Beecher, a cout.n of the
noted divine.
Mr*. Jerome Churchill was the first to
read her paper, entitled "Poetry, the
Naiural Interpretation of the Spiritual
Verse." Her essay was made up largely
of quotations from the great poets of the
past and present.
Among other pretty thoughts tha lady
said :
"It has been said that poetry is the
natural lanzuajre of the soul. And we are
told in God's book that the soul must be
come as a litUe cnild before it can enter
into the kingdom or understanding of
holy things. Tlie real, true, immortal
poet, then, must be to some extent the in
spired prophet o: God.
"The word poetry does not signify
jingle and rhyme. There are prose poems
<1 ute as bpauuiul as any that art can
measure by its metric scale.
'â¢The poetic muse loves best to express
herself in the sweet mystical language of
nature, for nature's language is God's lau
tuage. It is the poet's sacred privilegs to
interpret the divine thought sup^esied
Nearly alt our great poets have communed
much with naiure in the abstract."
Although not down on the regular pro
gramme the Bramacharin was present
and consented to speak, to add his praise
10 Mrs. Churchill's beautiful paper. His
address was eloquent and tiowery. He
said in part:
The speaker has so finely and beautifully
expressed her ideas that I am enraptured
They have been those of the Orientals from
time immemorial. Nature, the whole uni
ânot only the spiritual universe, but the
universe of matter also â is muÂ«ic solidified.
Tiie subject is generally looked upon as mys
ticism, though it Is as clear to us a- anything
under the heavens can be. All the great re
lleionists have described music as a part of
their religious devotions, and everywhere you
will find music.
Why? Because the whole universe is built
on music, and it is this key-note which, when
thoroughly mastered, gives man the mastery
over nature. It Is but the manifestation of the
three forces of the universeâ vibration, accel
eration and retardation.
You Cf.n see mind through natur", mind
Â»hrou<h everything that manifests itself to the
senses. Though your piiysical science is yet
in its infancy the "sound is audible to the phys
ical ear, and this soun<lâ these three great key
notesâproceed only from primordial sounds
which have Leen translated in the Bible as
amen.
The beginning of music is amen. It is the
one great keynote of nature. If you will only
sive up sensu and stnnd upon the same
platform of Christ the music is there waiting
for you.
Miss A. M. Beecher followed the Hindoo
sage. Her address was in part as follows:
Somebodyâ l think it was Oiver Wendell
Holmesâ said : I can take the place, and It I
cannot fill it I tan at least rattle- around a
little while. This uives mean opportunity of
making my first address in Caiiioruia before
the Woman's Congress, for which I congratu
late mysell, though have deep sympathy ior
you.
I am also permitted to wander about in a
very promiscuous sort of way on the subject
Delore you. You need not be surprised if I
emulate to you the one of whom Sam Slick
spoke when he said he eimplv wandered
arcuud.
Wonts are the labels of certain things which
enable us to understand each other, so that
words do not always mean the sam.; thing to
every one. Yet iliey mean in general the
same thing.
The etymology of the word should give us
the keynote; it means the e<lucing, the draw
ing out, nna not the patching on. There is
nothing in ah nature that lias not Its line of
beeuty, but for the most part we study beauty
as if it were something of external and not of
internal nature.
The soul is simplr what we may call an ag
gregation, what our metaphysician* have
labeled faculties. It is the ego iv man. I sey
man, but I mean woman as well. When ! say
man be so kind in all rase* as to remember
tiiat I mean principally woman.
A uttie girl in Sunday-school was once asked
what the soul ;s. ana she taid: - 'li is me thin*
of us." I believe that is a good definition.
Another definition that has been in use from
time immemorial is the divine spark. Tnat
has never been caaUeugtd even by raaieri-
I will row speak of my visit to California.
It has been a dream so 6Â»eet that 1 alnio- 1 be
lieve lam dreaming still. I was asked a while
ago what I think ot California. My answer,
delivered rignt here, is: "I have unpacked
my trunks and sen; them to the baggage
rcom."
Mrs. Ouiton read Mary Kewberry
Adams' paper, which advanced a number
of startling theories. Among other
thing! in the paper Mrs Adams
Education in the public schools should be
fitting ior citizenship based on the founda
tion of ethicai conduct, which is: -So act
that the immediate motive of thy will can be
the motive of all intelligent beings." If this
is begun iv the kindergar'en and is the 'oasis
on which every erade cultivates the elements
of character t::ere is the education lilting
tnem in the public schools to be be:.eiactors
lor the public in return. Should the
public build houses, supply teachers and
be at this immense exponso to educate
the children, unless they and their parents
enter into a compact thin they will, or so far
as they are able, return the worth of this edu
cation to the Nation iv a character worthy o:
citizenship and a benefit to the public who
supplied the expense of the charity? lÂ»oes
nut the acceptance of charity enfeeb.e mora.l
worth ?
li the child is educated in the public schools
at the expense of the public, should they not
take an oath to repay for the expense by es
tablishing such a character as will be of worth
to the puolic and the Nation.
Morality is cultivated by a child's under
standing " that she is a responsible beingâ a
part of the community, and that if she fail in
her part the Nation suffers. To receive mem-
Dership to a. public fcnool ought to enjoin upon
pupils and rarents duties and responsibilities
to thereby be, so far as they are able, good
citizens. There should be some such binding
promises as the lollowing: "I hereby promise
to have my thoughts, my habits and deeds
such that my State and Nation will be some
what repaid lor my education, and I will be a
worthy citizen of the United States."
Dr. Walk discussed at some leneth Mrs.
Adams' paper, saying among other things:
While perhaps it might partake of good in
some measure, when we begin to mate rules
for children we have a tendency to make so
many o: them that they become hard and fast.
and the result would be, In my estimation,
not the best, not producing that sense 01 grati
tude and the highest form of character lor
which we are pleading in the child, but would
tend to make machine-like children, autom
ata. As the story goer, an old Scottish divine
once said to sometnembers of his church who
had been elected ! ruling elders: ".Rule well,
but ainna. let any one know that you are
doing it."
The Rev. Eliza Tupper "Wilkes closed
the morning session. In part she said :
I believe that beauty is elevating. Harmony
of sound, of color, has been the most periect
expression of the Divine. Beauty ana sim
plicitj go hand iv hand. In our own country
an earnest endeavor is being made to reach
the beaatiful in life. Our own Keith, in
opening his gallery to the public, has (tone hU
duty toward giving the poor man h;s nour of
inspiration and help. Klevate the taste of
children and qutet uisordcrly little ones by
the charm beauty exercises over tnem. Chil
dren should hsve about them copies of great
est pictures, piaster casts of Immoral sculp
tures, to form and elevate their taste. Art is
DO longer the vocation for the few favored
ones; it is no longer to be oniy in tne homes of
the fortunate.
Schoolrooms should be decorated and de
signed with care for the beautiful, and our
street! made less hideous for cur children's
eyes. We can shield lrorn our children the
immorÃl novel, but defenseless are we against
the great vulgar losters, shocking tiieir tastes
and outraging the taste of the beautiful. Then
I pray you begin now to surround your chi d
with the beautiful, and teach him reverence
for nature. "If I bad but two loaves of
brut. I," Mohammed neid, "I wcu'.d sell one that
I mignt buy beau:Lul hyacinths to satisfy my
hunger."
The first paper of the airernoon session
was by Miss E*te!la Darrahs.
It was a discussion based upon a study
of tho papers written by 1400 California
school children in reply to the questions,
"What is th<Â» most beautiful toing you
ever saw ? Wny did you like it ? '
Among other excellent things in Miss
Darrahs' paper was saiu :
The children show an inherent susceptibility
to the beautiful. On comparing the papers
with the reminiscences of the world's great
artists and poets we came to the conclusion
that the human mind is so orgauized as to
t.pontaneou.-iy respond to beauty along cer
tain deliuits lines.
Two papers were read, one by the great
Russian writer. Count Tolstoi, and one by
a California country child, snowing this
parallel.
Tolstoi recalled as one of his most beautiful
memorie "a small pond wiib overgrown banks.
A.n ancient birch drooped over the pond,
partly clinging to the damp banks, resting its
crown on a tail stately ash tree aud straying
it< cuny branches on the Â»mo >th sinfnce 01
the pond, that gave back the reflections."
Tho Cah:ornia country boy of 15 writes:
"The moit beautiful thing 1 ever saw was a
litt.e meadow in between the to^s of three
mountain peaks, which cast their dark shad
ows de<-p into the giassy lake, while upon tne
banks grew beautiful green trees, ami as they
diDptd tfceir .ong waving branches into the
crystal waters tl.ey eeemed to be refreshed
and made green and more beautiful again.
Ah! who can describe such a &cene? My pen
refuses to write it. One feels as though he
ha<i been wafted into a new world at such a
sight fis Uiis."
The vision of the great Russian was no
keenerâ his feeling no more exaltedâ than
that of this country boy.
The facts shown by this study are that three
fourths ol the children find the beautiful in
nature at first in isolated details. The younger
childreu find an object beautiful on account
of its color.
We are incorrectly tryiug to educate chtl
dr-n in art Dy giving them type forms, trust
ing that by the contemplation oi perfect
formsâ the sphere, the cabe, the cylinderâ
they will grow into a love for the beauiful.
With a true art education the next genera
tion of California children, surrounded by ai
in nature that suggests the beautiful, would
lurnish the art and poetry for the world.
Miss Anna G. Lyle was the sensation
of the afternoon. Her paper. "The Com
monplace Women," was us follows:
I met a man the other day who did not seem
to approve of my addressing the Woman's Con
gress. -Tel. them from me," he said, "tbat
if you womÂ«sn wi"i persist in clerking, type
writing, telegraphing, telephoning ana doc
toring, supp anting men in the fle^d of bread
winning, you will bring about a condition of
things that existed in savagery, where woman
was the beast of burden, 'the hewer oi wood
aiid the drawer of water Iâwhere1 â where man was idle
and expected to be supported. If you wish to
resume the load civilizution has lifted from
your snoulderj go ahead. I think we men
would rather like the change."
THE FOrXE OF NECESSITY.
But there are very few womeu who clerk
typewrite, telegraph, telephone or doctor for
the love of doing these things. l>eath, bad in
vestments, less of position, the perpe'ual state
of goneness of the iami.y purse, some bread
and butter necessity, together wiih the
changes brou*htabout by the wouderful mu
teriai progress cf the century, have made
women feel keenly the insecurity of lifeâ the
uncertainty of support. Necessity has made

have learned the value of a trained hand di

With ail that can te said j.ro and con of the

equations, and the fact remains the same. I
do not mean to say all women who are occu
pied are impelled by sheer necessity. Some
women there are who, having been trained,
find they art* happier In the employment of
their faculties.
TIP.ED OF THE TALKING WOMAN.
But there is too much said about women. I
think the woman question has been discussen
ad nauseam. As I have Â«aid beiore, tiie great
bulk of women will uot be bread-winners but
mothers, and any sysiem of education that
fails to emphasize this as an end of educa
tional means swells the number of women
freaks. Any system of education that does
not put a nalo about the nam â  of home and
mother defeats itself, takes away life's mean
ing, takes away the power of knowing the
truth ana of seeing things as they are.
We are tired of the women who talk for
talk's sake; we are weary oi the woman who
u*es the woman question as a means of rush
ing herEeif Into a pioniinerce that she ha* not
earned cud does not merit, < ne who has ao
| right to an opinion or tne expression oi it.
There are practically no restrictions on
woman in America except thu limitations
nature has imposed upon. her. Unquestion
ably she has the opportunity of getting all the
training she wants, all the education she can
curry. The few universities who are trying to
be unique in Carrying conservatism into the
twentieth century will open their doors
when superior trained women ask admit
tance, and coeducation will eventually be
come universal. It will take the women
who wear frizzes and false hair, who
consult mediums, who buy stocks and
lottery-tickets and clamor lor their rights,
longer to accomplish anything than for a
bloomer brigade to build ;he .Panama canal.
Nobody feels kindly toward the man who
whistles one tune incessantly. If this were a
common practice among men the great body
of lawmakers would have a seance or two and
there would appear a notice alongside the
anti-expectoration notice*â there would even
be posters on the fences agninst the man who
whistled continuously "Toe Huckleberry
Coon," "I Want V -r. Ma Honey," or any other
such specimen of musical literature.

I never could see the sense in havinc a
woman's building at t^e World's Fair. If a
woman be a painter let har nang her pictures

If a woman do any piece of work te t it be put
into competition with other work of the same
kind and stand or fall by reason of us own
merit, and not put a premium on it because It
has been done by the fair hand of a woman.
The fret :hat a woman made a certain broom
would not recommend it to anybody buying a
broom if it were not a weil-mtde broom; and
this tact holds good in the brain markets of
tne world.
I have not time to speak of higher education
to-day. I believe in it if the price be not too
hgb. A man pays too high a price for an
education when he sacrifices his mother'?, his
father's or his own health. The doctrine of
"something ,'or nothing" is a bad doctrine; so
is the doctrine of â¢â something for too much."
There will always be men and women, Â«â 
long as this movement for higher education
lasts, who will strain every nerve to go to col

parents have been improvident or unfortunate
or poor, and who have not earned for them a
privilege which, if they wish to enjoy, they
must earn for themselves. If an education

The great mass of men and women of
America doe* no; come in direct contact with
our universities. But there are very few
American men and women who cannot read
and write. This fact shows us that the great
muss does come in direct contact with our
public schools. I thins this one fact alone
should make it imperative that these people

Now, as the kindergarten is but the broad
ening out of the home, part-of-the-day homes
for active lilt c people, so the primary and
srrammar schools stand linked with the home.
fh< y are the nests from which our young peo
ple are taught to fly into a wor^d where the
litest alone survive. They need the warmth
s:id care and training that it is woman's in
stinct to give. And right here 1 would say
that this is entirely the woman's province and
t.al a ma:, has no buÂ»tne>s to teach school.
School-teaching is unsexing for a man. It is
effeminate, womanish. The chilli's training

through the gates of girll o>d or boyhood into
the open field of voting womanhood or young
manhood. Men claim a sort of "divine right"
to all the professions. They say they are
mannish, unsexiug for a woman. Perhaps.
but I never couM see anything in medicine
that a woman should not know. Since the ad
vent of woman as teacher the days of flogging
are at an end. Arithmetic and g eometry ore
not hammered into the heads with rulers, rat
tans or convenient books. A woman uses dif
ferent methods, for it is her nature to be more
patient with the young.
BOW TO DISCOURAGE VICIOUS LITERATURE.
The schools owe a great deal to the children.
They owe them a good start on the ri?ht road
in the rac? of life. Above all they owe the
commonplace girls and boys a training that
will make them intelligent enough 10 s-e- and
embrace opportunities until, guided by tne
gospel of work preached by the teachers, they
will work out tneir own salvations, aided by
the sweetness and light that has been given
them. There will be a cherk on tbe foolish
ness, the v.cc. the love of vulgar amusements
of ordinary commonplace men and women.
Like the wumnn who measures all men by the
man she loves, children who have been forced
'to commit to memory passages from t.'ie
masterpieces of English poetry, who hnve
been to.<i the stone? of tne great operas,
of Shakespeare's dramas, of mythol
ogy, O! the Niebelungeu Lied and oi
the celebrated characters In historr. will
judge what they don't know by wnai they do
know, lor they will understand the value of
simplicity and thoroughness. They will not
fear a hcal:ny "I don't k'iow" when they
v ider*tand Jv>w to go about to inform them
selves correctly on whatever subject they wish
to know. Wort: like this will do a great deal
to abolish a ;aste for such books as "Fourteen
Buckets of Blood, or the Butcher's Midnight
Onrie"'; "Confessions of a Homme de Slecle";
'â¢The Poisoned Gumdrop, or the Candy Girl's
Terrible Revenge," and some of our daily
newspaper*.
LET THE WOMEN RT*N THE SCHOOLS.
â¢ Let the women run oar common schools.
Let the mothers go hand in hand with the
ter.chers, wrench the schools from politics and
from every thins: that savors of politics and bid
farewell to the Boards of Education. In this
field women can do an everlasting good. Put

qualifications are above all question and let

ihere are plenty of capable women who

My paper reminds me very much of a story.
"What is the name of this village, my friend
asked a stranger. "Tarry town." "Tarry
town?" "Yes; named so, I guess, because no
one was ever known to stop here overnight if
he con help it."
1 have classified my paper under the head
of esthetics, which I have lelt untouched.
The beautuul must stand on a foundation of
goodness and truth. It is here the teHCher

tiful, first through nature and later through
art.
BIPEKED IN NOBLE SUNSHIJTE.
If the children have lived in the sunshine of
noble souls they will have received the bless
ing, the benediction of a progress that is real.
They will journey in the direction of a time
when we snail do right for rliiht's sake, when
tiny lips shall be taught to murmur and with
the unfoialug years gradually to understand
George Elliot's prayer:
May I reach
That purest heaven, be to other son!s
The cup of strength In some er at agony.
Knki-idle eeneroui ardor, feed pure love â
!Â»Â«-(?â¢". tbe smiles tuat have no cruelty.
Be the sweet presence of a good diffused,
And la diffusion even more intense-
So shall 1 ] >in the choir invisible.
Whose music is the gladness of the world.
Miss Ina I). Coolbrith brought the after
noon session to a close with her excellent
paper, "Poetry as a Factor in Education."
Among other things Miss Coolbrith said:
That which I have to say in this paper is
equally of protest and appeal â protest against,
as I consider them, certain intellectual evils
of the day, and an appeal for the expression
of the higher ideals of thought. Utility,
practicable y, taste â these are tne motive j
powers of the day, and in our selfishness for
speed and acquisition we are daily increasing
the difficulties and suffering of the mass of
humanity â the laboring classes are
pushing irom the face of the earth other forms
of life which have just as sacred a right to
their places on the globe as have we.
It is not our needs but our greeds that have |
increased, for the root of it as of all evil is
gold, money getting; not philosophy, but the
philosopher's stone, is the object of general
search and the achievements of mind are
crowned with honors and reward. Nowhere
is that felt so much so in our literature. No
where Is this felt so much as in our poetry â
and poetry is the supreme flower of literature.
The race to-day does not choose its reading
to Induce but rather to avoid thought, hence
to secure an audience and marke t the fads and
"fadnyenes" of the hour, the average dialect j
ruse. The story-teller or the new favorite
school of realism wnich has supplanted those
of romance, instead of the old love idyl, the
courts of kings, the lists of chivalry, intro
duces us to a kitchen interior 01 the modern
home and exclaims in rapt admiration, "Oh,
how beautiful!"
The poet has but small honor and less profit.
Where lies the remedy? In a return to the
simpler life, the larger scholarship, the higher
ideals of the past.
AFTER TWILIGHT.
An Essay on Sh'iloy, and Ad
dresses by Miss Conners and
Professor Ross.
The congress was esthetic when it broke
off for dinner, and it reassembled rami
nant'.y esthetic after the twilight, which
is so soulful in this balmy clime.
The first number on the programme was
a paper by Mrs. A. H. Washbu^n of San
Jose, "An Examination of Matthew Ar
nold's Criticism of Shelley's poetry." She
apoke of one as the greatest English poet
and of the other as the greatest English
critic, and took issue with the critic in
his estimate of the esthetic bard that the
poet was incoherent, and that he and
Byron, and Burns, and Ccler:dÂ«e, and
Rents and Southey were lacking in great
subjects. Arnold could not and would
nov understand tbe ideals that inflamed
the soul nf tbe more ethereal Shelley.
Mrs. Washburn's paper waÂ« marked by
great runty of diction and her reading
was graceful and like the subject â
womanly and esthetic.
Miss Moliie Conners of Oakland had
been set down for a paper on "The Es
thetic Element in Early Education."
She apologized for not having prerared
the paper, but made a brilliant offhand
speech on the subject that carried her
hearers with her and made them regret
that her talk was not twice as long. It
was snappy, every sentence striding fire.
Professor Edward A. Ross of the chair
of economics in Stanford University read
a paoer on "Education for Enjoyment or
Cultare. " It was a plea for education in
the appreciation of the beautiful in nature
and in art.
Rev. Eliza T. Wilkes, a winsome little
woman with a sweet voice, closed the ses
sion and bade her hearers farewell, she
having been called away to the scene of
her labors elsewhere.
There will be no morning session to
day. The congress will open at 2 o'clock
with the following programme for the
day :
2 p. M â Professor C B. Bradley, "The Study
of History as a Development of the Heart and
Imagination" ; Mrs. KmniÃ Payne Erskine,
"Tno Deadline oi Civilization" ; M;ss Adeline
KnaDP. "Just Mere Literature"; Miss Mar
garet Sweeney. "Engltsn in Secondary Schools."
Bp. M âProfessor J. M. Stiliman, "The Essen

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
McKinley is a good holiJay speaker.
He cuts it short.
A park in the Mission is one of the
things that come Inch but we must have.
Tbe European concert will never be
called upon to repeat its performance by
request.
Eastern investors in minine stock will
take notice that there has been no slump
in the California output.
Now that the New York demonstration
is over Philadelphia invites attention to
her monument to Washington.
The Greeks havn vet a lighting chance,
as well as a chance to iipht, provided they
seek :t al the front instead of at Athens.
The tariff topic is dull, but all the same
nearly every Califomian has somp inter
est in it and had better keep watching it.
King George will have to face the mob
as King Humbert faced the attempt of tbe
assassin. It is "an incident of the trade."
I'here will be more glory for our wheel
men in completing 'bÂ« fund necessary to
construct Buboa avenue than in making
forty centuries.
Our carnival is ahead of that of Los
Angeles, for hers is now behind the times,
â¢while ours is sill to the front and vanish
ing in the distance.
It in jnst as well to remember that Beat
rice Harraden's California story is avow
edly a work of fiction. She was not
writing a guidebook.
The Athenian mob is not the Greek
people by any mear.s, and Attic lieklene<s
may be more than counterbalanced at
thii juncture by S| artan resolution.
Let us cet Bit 1 boa avenue completed and
then we can go forward to other things,
and have a cood and pleasant road on
which to recreae ourselves as we go.
The reports of the California min*s for
1596 show an increase of gold and a de
crease of silver in the output, so we are
right in It with the demand of the age.
It Is now feared at Wa<hineton that the
Democrats may prove obstinate after all
when the tariff bill comes up in the Sen
ate. The only way to make sure that a
donkey won't kick is to kill him.
The Napa T>ni!y Journal gravely informs
its read-rs that the north wind raised
wheat 3 cents in San Francisco recemlv.
That's nothing â the north wind here
raises other things besides wheat.
The tloois in the Mississippi are becom
ing morÂ» and more seriou?, and the dan
gers hay- not vet passed. It won'd bo
better for those reonle tostrike out for the
arid districts and irrieate as they need it.
Accordine to reports from New York
the wind on Grant day was full of pneu
monia, and many a man who took pan in
the por.irie and marched bare headed past
the monument may yet prove to have lit
erally followed Grant to the tomb.
According 10 the Riveriide Press there
are now *n route from Mediterranean
ports for the Atlantic Coast cities 275,600
boxts of lemons. What a fine large baÂ«in
of lemonade those tired Greek soldiers
would have if the ship 3hou!d sink.
Adlai Stevenson and a party of capital
ists have started for Georgia to look at the
gold fields in the mountains ol that State,
and if they wish a jtinketins tour they are
goinp to tb9 right place; but when they
pet ready for business in gold-mining they
had better come to California.
.Politicians who take an interest in co
nundrums are trying 10 guess what the
Populists will do when they assemble in
the proposed convention at Nashville next
July. It is believed that none but the
middle-of-the-road men will be present
and this adds to the uncertainty of the
result. There is nobody quit* so likely to
bolt as a Populist who starts out to stick
to the road.
The Tnlare lteguter observes that the
pure food investigation made in San
Francisco disclosed the fact tbat there is
very little pure food to investigate. It is
the opinion of a large and roving part of
the community that there is very little
food anywhere or of any kind, but such as
we have in San Francisco is pretty eood.
what there is of it, and there is plenty of
it euch as it is.
According to reports from Washington
those people who thought that Justice Field
woula retire as soon as Cleveland was out
ot office are very ranch mistakon in the
man. Field did not hold on jimply to
spite Cleveland. He likes the place and
has an ambition to establish a record for
length of service which no one will break.
He will stay on the bench, it is believed,
until be dies, and candidates lor bis seat
will have to wait for a funeral.
The Oroville Mercury, in announcing the
opening of a local creamery this week, de
clares that in order for it to succeed a
preference must be given its product over
any imported article. We should any that
if the people of that section fail to show
this preference the only way that the
creamery can get even will be to send its
superior product abroad. It will be them
selves and not the creamery that the
Orovilleans will injure by their failure to
tase advantage of the borne production. |
THE MISSION PARK MOVEMENT.
The movement for the establishment of a large park in the Mission has now ad
vanced to a position where it may tie fairly considered a practical issue of municipal
politics. The promoters of the improvement have organized, have secured the co-oper
ation of large bodies of influential citizens, have suggested a scheme for the proposed
park, which merits popular favor, and, in short, have put their plans into such a
shape as to compel immediate consideration.
That there should be a park of laige extent in the Mission district of the City is a
proposition which is not likely to be disputed by any well-informed person. The
res dents of that nortion of the community ought to have within easy range a large
pleasure ground for health and recreation. The time has gone by when one park was
accounted Mitlicient fora large city. At the present stage of civilization park areas
are regarded less as municipal ornaments than as matters of public necessity, and
accordingly in all progressive cities new parks are being opened in all quarters so that
thÂ«> people oT every section can derive the benefits to health and bodily vigor from
them without being compelled to go great distances in order to reach them.
It is certain that if we are to have a park for the Mission we cannot begin too
early to prepare for it. Land can be obtained more cheaply now tban at any time in
the future. At present there is an abundance of vacant land well located in the Mis
sion and beautifully diversified for park purpose?, the price of which is certainly a3
low now as it will ever be, and this therefore iÂ« the best lime to arrange for its pur
chase and conversion to the proposed uses.
The organization which has undertaken to advance the enterprise has not yet, we
bel-.eve, devised a plan for the purchase. That important question ought to be settled as
speedily as possible. The Bum required will bs considerable, for the proposed park
ought not to contain less than 500 acres, and 1000 acres would be better. To obtain so
large a tract will require a large expenditure of purchase money, but the cost will not
be ereater than what sucii a park will be worth to the City, and any well-devised
scheme for raising the money may bo counted on to receive the cordial support of the
press and the public generally.
An important feature of the movement in its present form is the proposal to make
the park a great zoological garden, surpassing in extent the famed gardens of that
kind in London and Paris. This scheme is ambitious and yet seems to have in it
sufficient reasonableness to afford a foundation for the hopes of its promoters. It iscer
tainly sufficiently attractive to give an added interest to the schema for establishing
the park and will no doubt do much to gain public favor for the enterprise.
Whatever may be the details adopted the plan in itself is a good one and we trnst
that a moans may be found of accomplishing it within the near future. San Francisco
is large enough to need two parks and is rich enough to afford them. The park in the
Mis-ion would be in many respects pleasanter even than Golden Gate, since it would be
freer from winds and fogs, and even if it were not laid out on such a costly scale it
wou.d still add much to the attractions of the City and to the health and enjoyment
of its people.
THÂ£ OITRUS-GROWEES.
The citrus-growers of California have
set a gooa example to men engaged in
other industries in the State hy the man
ner in which they are conducting their
contest fora full and complete protection
to their industry in the new tariff. They
have formed a strong organization, out
lined an excellent plan of work and en
trusted it to competent and energetic men.
The chances of their success are therefore
good, and even if they should fail they
will have the satiÂ«faction of knowing they
have made a zood fight and have done
everything in their power to achieve as
well as to merit success.
The tariff committee of the association
has drawn up an elaborate argument in
support of the claim for a duty of 1 cent
per pound on all citrus frui s imjorted
into this country and forwarded it to our
representatives in Congress. They have
not rested, however, with that, out have
gone forward in an endeavor to bring the
full force of puuhc opinion to sustain
them in their contention. They have
niaely circulated a copy of their petition
to Congress, with a lull statement of all
the arguments to support it, and accom
panied it with a request that the citizens
of California generally shall urge upon
their representatives in Congress the im
portance of granting this protection to the
citrus industry.
It wouid be difficult to give too much
praise to tbe committee that drew up
the arcumentfl for the proposed in
crease of duties. It covers the sub
ject thoroughly, but does not conta.n a
single supeifluous word. Every position
is sustained by statistics of the most ex
act nature, and the snowing is one that
cannot be refuted in any particular. The
preÂ«s of California and all commercial and
i. dustrial bod.es can well afford to in
dorse Mich a petition, barked by argu
ments so cogently stated, and there can
be no question that the desired support
will be given.
It is to be regretted that all California
industries requiring protection from ttie |
new tariff have not been as well supported |
and advocat d as that of the citrus-grow
ers. If an equal capacity for organization
and an equal energy in the performance of
work we:e shown in all the departments ]
of our industry, California would have
comparatively little to fear from the re- j
vision of the tariff by tbe Senate. The
pxample of the citrus-growers is thereiore
one which can be well commended to the
people generally, and as it is not yet too
late to act, all indusiriesof California hav
ing claims to be presented during the tariff
legislation should take 'teps at once to
present them as effectively and as forcibly
as have been the claims of the growers of
citrus fruits.
SAN JOAQ.IN VALLEY.
"If there is a doubtiiK Thomas In the
cmmunity," *ays the Visalia Delta, "who
has taken a pessimistic view regarding
the building of the Valley road, that indi
vidual may now viÂ«it a point a short dis
tance beyond the outskirts of Visalia and
see a laree number of men and teams
busily employed in constructing the road
bed of said railway.'" Oie does not have
to be a doubling Thomas to see that. In
fact these of us who are not b.esjed with
a coincidental endowment of doubt and
the name of Tom may see it far more
rendily.
In the bustle and hurry of ordinary life
we are apt to forcet the ereat extensions
of transportation facilities whicn are
being ma le in southern parts of the State,
but with our attention once called to them
we immediately return to our original
appreciation of them. They are proposi
tions wnich any one may grasp without
argument, and the only thing that keeps
ail of us from being constantly jubilant
over the prospect whic 1 they hold out is
the circumstance that we Jotvet them.
There are always several remedies for
hard times and several conditions that arc
responsible for them, the common notion
that any one certain prominent remedy
that may be brought up can alleviate all
ihe evils at one fell swoop being nothing
more than a campsien delusion. Of the
several remedies now in sight for the
various ills which afflict California, each
remedy according to the ill which it is to
treat, the building of more railroads for
the transportation of product* is one of
the most effective. The need lor that
particular remedy is more noticeable in
the San Joaquin Valley for ihe reason that
that section's resources have been devel
oped recently, and subsequent to the
original arrangement and construction of
the State's system of railroad transporta
tion, and this subsequent devolopment
has left that section without adequate
facilities.
For a number of reasons past the prin
cipal complaint in the cry of hard times
in the San Joaqain Valley has been on
account of insufficient arrangements for
shipping products to market. Fruit has
rotted upon the ground, hay and grain
have been sold for less than the cost of
production, and many a farm in the most
fertile part of the valley has failed to pay
a sufficient per cent upon the investment

upon it. Growers of rich and abundant fruit
have groaned in spirit when seeine their
orchard littered with decaying fruit and
have realized that if they could have cent
the fruit to market they could have pros
pered. Nothing but a line of railroad
within reach of them can bring them re
lief. The people of California have only
to realize the vital part of the proposition,
leaving out merely tbe adv sable par:, to
know now absolutely necesssrv the new
railroads are and what a great benefit they
will be.
CALiPORNTA MINES.
The report of the statistician of the mint
on the gold and silver production of Cali
fornia for tbe calendar year 1806 is in the
higheÂ»t degree enc uraging. It shows
that while ther* hus been a depression in
the far-famed mining districts of South
Africa there has been an increase in the
gold output in California, and thiÂ« show
ing can hardly fail to have an eff ct in
attracting the capital of gold-miners to
our State.
A< cording to the report the mines of
California in the past year yielded $17,
--181962 in gold and $422, 463 in silver, or a
total of JI7.HJ4 026. Compared with the
output of 1895 there was an incrrased pro
duction of gold of $1,847,245 and adecreasp
in the value of silver produced of $177,326,
leaving a net gain of $1,669,918.
This showing, good in itself, would un
doubtedly hÂ«vÂ« been mtteh better if it
had been possible to obtain exact in
formation from ail the mines. It is an
nounced, however, by the statistician that
some of tbe miners seem to have a repug
nance to furnishing the mint with the de
sired information, and many cannot be
induced to do so nt all. The statements
given, therefore, can be confidently relied
upon as the minimum of State productive
ness, inasmuch as the output was in no
case estimated or calculated from insuffi
cient data, but waÂ» compiled from the
actual reports of such mines as gave
them.
Until we have a statute making it obli
gatory for all mining companies to make
sworn returns of the output of the gold
and si.ver of their mines we can never
make a full and complete showing of the
productiveness of the mioinc districts of
the State. What has been accomplished,
however, is sufficient to make clear the
fact that California still ranks am. ng the
most prolific golt-bearing regions of the
world and is steadily increasing in the
amount of its output of precious metals.
Considered in detail, the report biows
that tbe number of counties producing
gold and silver to the vaiue cf $1,000,000
or more has increased during the past
yar from five to sÂ»ven. the new counties
being Siskiyou and Tnolumne. The be l
showing of the year w;is ma :e br Ni vada
County, whose produc: of $2,389,340 not
only maintains that county in the first
rank bur shows an increase over laÂ»t year
of $599,124. Toe second place is held by
P;ater, with Calaveras third anil Ama
dor, Trinity. Siskiyou and Tuolumne fol
lowing in the order nume 1.
As it has been reported from Europe
that the disturbances in the Transvaal
have caused an immense slump in the
mining interests in that portion of the
globe, it is not unlikely that this excel
lent showing for California will have the
effect of calling to this State much money
wh:ch otherwise would have been used in
tbe development of South African prop
erties. The pood results of the past year,
therefore, furnish a basis for expecting
better results in the future, and the
mining interests of the State have in
every respect a bright outlook before
them.

"THE TELEPHONE .fl LAW."
A PRECKDQJT Made In Ferdinand Ward's
Trial in 1880.
Communication in New York Son.
In regard to the admission of telephone
messages as evidence, permit me to add to
your article printed on Sunday, beaded "The
Telephone in Law."
The first instance of such admission was in
no less larnous a case than that of Ferdinand
Ward, of Grant & Ward. This was in October,
1885. On October 26 James D. Fish, then
serving ten years in Sin* Sing for wrecking
the Marine Xstional Bank, of which he had
been president, took the stand against Ward,
and swore that he had talked to Ward over a
private telephone running from the bank to
Grant & Ward's private office, and tÂ«at Ward
had instructed him what to do with two
checksâ one for $71,800 on the Mariue Na
tional Bank, and one :or $75,000 on the First
National Bank. He swore positively that
Ward was the person with whom he had had
the conversation.
Benjamin F. Xracy and Bourkc Cochran.
lawyers for Ward, protested against this %*â¢*â¢ -
mony. declaring that it was incompet nt.
Justice Barrett, trial judge, necided acin..
them, however, and admitted the telephone
conversation a* evidence.
Ou the following day, October 27, Benjamin
rish, a brother of the precedine witness, swore
he had been standing with his head within
eighteen inches of the telephone at the lime
his brother and Ward had talked about the
checks, and that he heard Ward's voice dis
tinctly come over the teiepboue although his
brother had the receiver to his ear. The law
yers for the defence declared that such a state
ment was ridiculous, out the prosecution
showed n letter that Ward had written Fish,
complaining about the fnct that every one in
the room where mat telephone was could hear
wimt was being saia.
Ward vas fouDd guilty and was sentenced
to ten years a- Singling. On appeal Justice
Barrett's decision admitting the {elephoue
message was sustained. This was the first case
on record and is a precedent eight years older
than that of Judge Benedict, spoken of by you
on Sunday. Your*, etc.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
No American pnma donna is winning so
much raeeen In Europe just at present as
Miss Delia Ropers of Denver, Colorado. She
was takea to Paris by her parents when a
child and plactd in a convent, where she ob
tained a complete mnstery over the language.
Her vocal teacher wÂ«s Mrac. de It Grancp, and
neither money nor pains were spared by her
family to cive her every artistic opportunity.
Delia Rogers is one of the very few Americans
who have won applause at the Sccla in M lan.
Another Western prima donna has appeared
there in recent yearsâ Sarah Paiina of this
City â but she only sang a minor role, whereas
Miss Rfgsrs was singing prima <ionna roles
there several years ago. During the last few
months she has been touring In Turkey and
Roumania, and immediately on li.r return to
Miss Delia Rogers of Denver, Colo.
Italy was snapped up by So: zogno to sing the
prn::a donna roles in "Carmen" ana "Wer
ther"ln Turin. Massenet has coached her in
"Wcrther." One feature of her appearances is
the magnificence of her gown?. In the ac
companying picture she is repr-sented as
Da.ila iv Saint-Saens' "Samson el Dal. la."
In England dramatic or operatic works
founded on Biblical subjects cannot be put on
the stage. In order to overcome this custom
maunders have sometimes changed the t. ties
auil the names of the pvrsonages in works
that havo obtained a trreat success elsewhere.
For instance, Rossini'^ "Moses" was given in
London under the name of "Peter the
Hermit," at:d Verdi's "Nebuchadnezzar" was
called "Nmus." It seems that Grau wanted
to mount Saini-SaÂ»-ns' â¢â¢Samson et Dalila" at
Coven t Garden this season and tent to the
composer to know if ne might change the
names of the character* and vary the inci
dents in order to obliteraio their resemblance
to the Bib.c story. For instance, he wished to
make lightning strike tho Philistine temple
instt ad of letting Samson pull it down.
Saiut-^aens received the request at Las
Palnas, in the Canary Isles, where he is win
tering, and immediately telegraphed back,
"The changes demnnded for 'Samson' are im
po.-s.ble"; so "btmson et Da.i a" will con
tluue to be performed on the concert i>latforrn
as an oratorio in England, but it will not
figure on the bills of Covent Garden.
German papers are printing vory kindly
notices of M;ss Marion Bear of this City, who
is ab oad studying music. Of a concert she
gave in Berlin on March 10 last a Dresden
musical journal says:
Miss Marion Bear's concert, which was an
nounced in these columns some time ago,
took piece in Berlin March 10, 1897. with
most gratifying end successful results. Miss
Bear's appearance was a signal for an out
burst of applause which the Saal Bechstein has
not heard lorsome time. Her programme whs
well chosen and throughout she gave great
pleasure by her artistic and refined render
ings. Her rapid progress under Prolessor
jediiczka will be the means of assuring her a
frout rank among pianists. On the programme
was the trying and difficult B minor scherzo
of Chopin, whicn had a dash and brilliancy
about it that gave her lull opportunity of dis
playing her admirable hnic. The tour pre
ludes in C, W and B i.<Â»t major and <ne in r
sharp minor by Chop n were piayed with gracÂ»
and poetry. Beethoven's I flat sonate, op. '2.1,
wis remlerrd in amosi praiseworthy manner.
The remaining numbers on the programme,
Ifccbfcikowaky'a variations op. 10 ; iichuaann's
â¢'Knde yon Lie i" and Liszt's Ruapsodie 2 and
13, wore all given with dash and spirit. Miss
Bear's performance met with enthusiastic ap
plause, and after repeated recalls Bhe re
sponded with one of the dainty Chopin pre
ludes.
Castelmary's death on the stnce of the Metro
politan Opera-house is anoid story, but Emma
Calves account of the tragedy, written to a
friend in Paris, has now been published in the
French papers and her comments are worth
rending. Calve says: "Casteunary was labori
ously playing Tristan when he was overcome
with a choking sensation iind fell on his knees
The public thought it was a comic effect and
applauded the last moments of tne dyini? artist.
No sooner was the curtain lowered thnn he ex
pired. He was too old, too worn out to continue
playing, but he died on the field of honor like
a valiant so dier. Poor < astelmary 1 They

found 10,000 francs, all his savings, and a
will.
"GoJ wÂ«s gooi to take him thu3, without
pain, at ;he very moment when old age was

his nonesty were proverbial at the theater;

In Londona quaint complaint has been raised

Competitions to discover mute inglorious
opera composers do not always succeed as well

auspices of the l'rlnce Regent and scarcely
achieved a succors of esteem. The composer
was called before the curtain, and his friends
offered htm a few wreaths, but the demonstra
tion was interrupted by very persistent hUaing

complain that '-Theuerdank" has no Inspira

STREET ASSESSMENT WORK.
City Councils May 11 ject All Bids
Made by Irresponsible Contractor*.
Tbe Supreme Court yesterday reversed
the judgment and order of the lower court
in the case- of the contracting firm of
Gervin. Baldwin & Eyre against J. Simon,
all of Stockton. This was an action to
foreclose the lion of a street assessment
levied by virtue of o contract for grading
and raving a street in Stockton. The
contract was let to F. J. Owen, who as
signed it to the plaintilts, by whom the
work was performed. Ihe case was tried
and the lo\er court gave judgment in
favor of Simon.
Two questions were involved in the ap
peal. The first relates to the validity of
the City Council in swarding the contract
to Owens, and the second is whether, con
ceding that the work was not performed
in accordance with the specifications of
the contract, the defendant is in a condi
tion to take advantage thereof.
It seems that the contract was taken
away from one McCarthy, by the Council,
who declared him to be unfaithful and
dehnqueut. Upon tnis the Supremo
Court says:
Tne City Council may reject any and all pro
posals or bids should it deem this for the pub
lic good, and aiso the bid of nny party uho
hns been delinquent and unfnithlul in any
former contract with the municipality, and
shall reject aw proposals or bids other than
tiie lowest regular proposal or bid of uny re
sponsible bidder, end may award the contract
for .â¢â aid work or improvement to the lowest
responsible bidder.
The higher court also decided the lower
court was correct in decreeing tnat all the
steps in the contract work are regular and
the assessment legal. The defendant had
the right to object to the work within
thirty days, but ne failed to do so, hence
the decision stated.

Little Beatrice May Perform With H:r
Aunt â Letter From a Mysterious
Admirer.
As a last de?psrate resort to raise funds
for the hospital expenses of her sister, for
the maintenance of little Beatrice Anita,
her sister's turee-year-n!d daughter, and
for her own support, Emma A-hley lias
allowed herself to be persuaded to take to
tb? stage.
Her histrionic plansare still unmatured.
Indeed it was only yesterday that she de
cided to use the dramatic abilities with
which her friends tell her she is eudowed,
for the delectation of the public and the
pecuniary benefit that she may gain
thereby.
The idea, she stated yesterday, was sug
gested to her shortly after her release
from custody, when the jury failed to
convict her of the charge of attempting
'â¢Lucky ' Baldwin's life. At that timu,
however, she absolutely declined to listen
to the propositions that were made to her
to take to the tneatricil boards.
Recently a lady friend, herself an
actress, revived the matter, and off red
to undertake the task of preparing Miss
Ashley for her appearance Lefore the
footlights. Seeing a possible opportunity
to raise runcn-needed fund?, Miss Ashley
consented to becoma a dramatic attrac
tion.
Her preliminary work has apparently
been completed, for yesterday she toajcht
out the manager of the Columbia Thenter
and proffered her s-rvices to him. the
tells her experience as follows:
"I went to the theater this afternoon
and asked for the man:ic-r. II" was
pointed out to me, but was speaking to
another gentleman at trie time. I waited
till he was alone and then approached and
spoke to hirj. I told him I desired to
take par; ia any play that might be put
on the stap.o of his theater. I told him
who 1 was, and be seemed to be favorably
impressed with niy proposition.
"He was very k'nd, but told me he had
no power to engage people to take part
iv the performances given at tiis
theater. He explained th:it only entire
companies were engaged, and that the
manager of the company was the one who
I engaged the performers. He intimated
that ii the theater had its own stock com
pany he would have been glad to give nic
a chance.
"When I left there I went to the Alcazar
Theater, out failed to find the manager
in. I was not greatly disappointed, for I
would pr-fer to make my debut in sofne
place outside of this City. I may mate
up niy mind to appear firs; at San Jose.
"Of course, I do not expect to take any
leading par;, but I believe people will go
to see me because of the unfortunate part
I have Deen compelled to play In real life.
I nuiy also give them a chance to see little
Beatr cc. Shi* has a number of pretty lit
tle dimity, suisse and other light and
nuffy frock?, which wiu make her look
very attractive before the footlights, i
might have her walk across tne stage
once or twice. I wonder how Baldwin
would like to see her. You don't often
see a millionaire's child on the stage, do
you?"
Dropping this topic she told of the re
ceipt of an effusively affectionate letter
from a gentleman who signed himself an
ardent admirer, and who wished to cor
respond with her for the purpose of ulti
mately making her acqua.iuance.
"I shall :;ot answer him," she said,
"because I am very suspicious these days.
How do I know but this may be some pri
vate detective employed by Baldwin to
secure my affection, marry me and so put
me out of ihe way of annoying Baldwin
with any demands for providing for the
support of intle Beatrice? If he thinks
he can switch me off in 'hat way. he will
eet footed. I don't propose to lake any
chances of being entrapped in anything
of thfit kind."
Lillian Ashley is still at St. Luke's Hos
pitai, but may be removed to the Woman's
Hospital shortly. An operation is neces
sary to insure her complete recovery to
health, and it will be performed as soon
as the question of her removal is settled.
WANT MACADAM ONLY.
I: i<-)i in 'mil Not Vet Prepared. for
Modern Street Pavement.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club is
not in favor of bitumen or basalt block
pavement. The reason for this is that
should either material be put down on the
streets at the present time it will surely
be disfigured by the many new buildings
going up from time to time with which
water and pa" connections must be made.
The fo^ic of this po. icy was fully dem
onstrated by the report of the executive
committee at the meeting of the club
Tuesday night when the recommen
dation was made that the Superintend
ent of Streets be invited to make an
investigation of all streets and avenues
from First avenue to Sixth and between
Point i.obo* avenue and Lake btrurt and
to recommend to the Board of Supervisors
the necessity of macadamizing such streets
as are not already paved.
For the purpose of advocating the.
recommendations of the club, the follow
ing were appointed a committee to wait
on the Supervisors: E. Gengley. J. P.
Fia.-ger, Lewis llohrmaun and P. Puillip

The plot of the rlay, as explained by the
translator, is Itid in epaiu during the
Mohammedan war. Don Alonzo, son of
Don Vasco de Gomel, a Drince.y noble
man, is persuaded by ambition and the
evil counsel of his confident, Don Lopez,
to abandon his father, his cuuntrv ar.d
his God.
He begins a prince among the Moham
medans, and in the progress of the war
his father and all his soldii-rs fall into the
hands of Tarik, the MuhammeJan leader.
Tarik causes Don Alonzo to visit his
father for tne purpose ol winning him
over to tho faith of the prophet, assuring
him that if he fails his father mint die.
Alonzo obv-'ys. His father, however, re
pels him and launches at him a maledic
tion, beneath which he loses his reason.
Don Vasco and his vassals escape from
the Turis and return to the Christian
c:imp, where they fina Don Alonzo, who
under his father's care returns to reason,
and is afterward ki.lcd in a battle with
the Mo ammedans.
The play abounds in thrilling incidents
ami natural situations. The young men
of the sodaitv acquitted themselves well
10 the task of pleasinc their friends.

BRITISHERS VOTE
FOR AN AMERICAN
Selected as Orator for
Their Queen's Diamond
Jubilee.
Graceful Compliment at an En
thusiastic Meeting of Com
mittees.
All Reports Show That the Celebra
tion Will B a Successâ A Praise
Service Mooted.
Â©
The rneetinc in Scottish Hall last night
of the Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee
I celebration committee was largely at
i tended, and was marked throughout with
he greatest enthusiasm.
Chairman William Doxey, in opening
the meeting, spoke of the encouragement
received since the previous meeting and
i the enthusiasm displayed all over the
City. He felt assured that the celebration
would prove an immense success. He
suggested that the following additional
names be added to the committee: W. H.
Campbell, G. W. Butler, G. W. Moss, R. ,
P. Hichet, H. P. Taylor. Consul-General
Warburton, Baron Jacobs, James Hogg, '
Dr. H. J. Jones, Werner Stanf, Dr. F. W. j
Skarfe, Donald Ross, Rev. W. N. Ballon
and Mr. Medcroft.
A motion to that effect was made and
adopted.
The chairman then called for reports
from the different committee* appointed
at the previous meeting, and Greer Ham- j
son, on behalf of the literary committee,
submitted the following:
The committee recommends that the pro
gramme of literary exercises shall bs us fol
lows: I. Opening prayer, by Rev. John Hemp-
ill. 2. Music. 3. Oration by a distinguished
American. 4. Music. 5. Poem. G. Music. 7.
Benediction by Rev. Rabbi N'ieto. 8. Music.
The committee desires to express the opinion
mat the litorarjr exercises be of the simplest
kind, and limited i* the sketch as above.
Fifty dollars was asked to be awarded to the
peel whose poem is selected.
In speaÃing to the report he suggested
the name of General W. H. L. Barnes, than
whom he thought no one in San Francisco
was better fitted to do justice to the oc
casion. He paid a glowing tribute to the
General's oratorical abilities and said that
I every effort should bo made to prevail
upon him to deliver the oration.
â¢â¢Where tlie Britisn flag floats.'' said the
speaker, "it would be only right that a
distinguished Britisher should deliver tho
oration, but in this foreign country, it
would be a fitting compliment to the flag
of that country that a distinguished
American should be selected."
The report was adopte i and the literary
committee was instructed to wait upon
General Barnes and gel nis consent to de
liver th<Â« oration.
1 J. J. Morris of the committee on musi
cal exercises reported progress.
John M. Duncan of the games commit
tee also reported progress.
Rev. J. J. Fell, who labors among the
seafaring men, -aid that the Chutes were
not suited to footrace?, but the water
could be utilized for water spirt? â such as
a tubrace and water polo â in which the
British sailors in port could take part.
There could also be the greasy pole,
which would afford great amusement. He
suggested that two or three of the British
i captains in port should be placed on the
I general committee as a compliment to
them, and that a circular be sent to all the
captains asking them to hold a meeting
nnd select two or three of their number.
The suggestion was adopted.
Sidney Chidley of the tableaux com
mittee reported recommending the fol
lowing tableaux:
1. "Announcement of the Queen* Acces
sion." 2. "Coronation Ceremony." 3. "Mar
ri*ue of the Queen." 4 "Opening of the
Great Kxnibition." 5. "Decoration of the Vic
toria Cross to the Crimean Heroes." 0.
"Horr.Rjreof the Indian Princes at the Last
Jubilee." Finale. "Grand Allegorical Rally of
the Katlo.is Subject to British Jurisdiction."
Tne expenditure would be about $500.
The report was referred for reconsidera
tion.
George T. Marsh of the committee on
decoration and illumination of grounds,
and John Reid of the committee on print
ing, advertising and programme reported
progress.
A. J. Callingbam of the banquet com
mittee reported recomending that the
banquet be held in the Palace Hotel Mon
day evening, June 21; that Consul-
General Warburton be chairman; mat a
toastinaster be selected, and that the
tickets should be $5 each so as to have
"quantity" rather than "quality."
W. Balorades suggested that ladies
should be permitted to attend the ban
quet, as they would add grace and dig
nity to the occasion; but it was not favor
ably received, and the report was adopted.
It was decided that the chairman of
each committee should meet in the recep
tion-room vi iho Palace Hotel Saturday
afternoon at 4 o'clock to arrange a pro
gramme for the celebration.
Rev. W. W. Boiton suggested that a
public service of praise and thanksgiving
should be held in some public nail on
Sunday, June 20, when there could be a
grand chorus and appropriate ceremo
nies. He moved that a committee of
three be appointed by the chairman to
consider the matter, which was adopted.
Husrh Hamilton, president St. Andrews
Society, Oakland, and D. R. McNeil), chief
of the Caledonia Club, delivered brief ad
dresses, expressing their sympathy with
the movement, , the latter jokingly ex
pressifg the hope that they would eoslow
till after the Caledonian games on May 30.
It was deci'ieu to send a circular to all
British societies on the coast and the
press, asking their sympathy and co
operation in making the celrbr&tion a suc
cess.
The meeting adjourned till next "Wednes
day night. ' -_

ABE'S MONUMENT
IS SURE TO RISE
|The People Will Pay
Tribute to Lincoln's
Memory.
The Monument Is Growing in
Interest All Over the
Country.
A Greater D mmd for Membership
Certificates Than Was Ever
Anticipated.
The success of the local movement that
I has for its object the erection in San Fran-
I cisco of a monument to the memory and
1 glory of Abraham Lincoln and the ob
servance of "Lincoln day" is now
j assured. At the meeting of the gen
i eral committee of the Lincoln Monument
League Asaociatien last evenius: at 102
| O'Farrell street, the evidence of the gen-
I era! public interest was manifest in dozens
' of letters assuring the warmest support in
; the objects to be attained. Already the
I demand for certificates of membership,
J costinc only 2o cents each, is greater than
I the supply. The first edition of 20,000 has
| been turned out and are being issued at
j the rate of 2500 a day, at least a- fast as
the books in which they are being bound
can be dried. Such was the report of W.
P. Howe of tne priming committee.
Chairman Steele of the distributing
com mittee stated that the demand for
| certilicate-books in the public schools is
i indeed great. Tne pfitils are putting
| down t 1 eir names for certificates by the
'< bun dreds and anxiously awaiting the
! time when they will secure the evidence
iof membership in the association. Mr.
Bailey cited a oase where one little cir:
has collected $15 in two-bit pieces and
another of a toy 8 years of aj;e who has
i get bared $3 to the name end. It was de
! cided that the public schools shall be fur
| niched with certificates before any others.
That the movement is indorsed by the
head of the School Department is shown
I by the following letter read by the sec
j tary:
Your communication of the Â£'-M and 2Uth
I inst. received, together witb the programme
i fur ihe observance of Lincoln day, proposed
I by Elisha Brooks, chairman of the ooinniittbe
on schools and churches.
This programme meets with ray approval,
ana in due time it will be issued Irom this
office in fie form <>f a circular letter addressed
to the principals of the department. Very re
' spectfully yours, K. 11. Webstkr]
Superintendent oi Bcttools.
Cnairman Hanley of the literary com
! mit'ee stated that ne nad added the name
of Hugti M. Burke of The Call to the
committee. He hoped to eet the certifi
cates into the Oakland public schools. So
far they will be placed in the schools of
San Francsco, Oakland, Alameda. San
Jose, Santa Clara and several interior
cities. The Airo-Americans are also
keenly interested in the movement.
It was decided that the president, secre
tary, treasurer and quartermaster should
I constitute a committee to define the work
and scope of each committee, so that
there will be no confusion or conflict in
; the Â«â <â ;â â.
A very interesting letter was received
j by President W. W. Stone from the Na
i tional American Worn .in Suffrage Asso
ciation headquarters, New York, which
reads as follows:
Lear Fir: Your letter is before me. I am
sure that all loyal women must sympathize
with the effort to build in San Francisco a
, Line la monument. That Lincoln was a great
in.'iii there Is no question, but in addition to
his being great the circumstances of his life,
his 3re at personality, his good humor, his
kmrl ics< and of justice, hnve all united
to make him beloved by tne American people
' beyond any other hero, I believe.
I should 'thltik it would be easier to build a
! monument for Liucoln than ior any other
! American. A National committee of women
to aid in the work I should think could be
easily obtained and would result in good feel
in c as well us good results.
There is in the United States an association
called the Council of Women. This is made
up of National organizations. Individuals are
not mem hers of it. Its membership is some
thing like SOO.OOO.
I ihink it would be far more effective and
satisiactory to engage tne interests of the
otticf-rs of this association rather than of the
suffrage association, which is of necessity
much smaller. 1 think you might do well to
write to Mrs. Mary K. Dickinson, Woman's
Council, Presbyterian building. Filth avenue,
Now York Cltr. With best wishes for the suc
cess of tins enterprise, 1 tun yours truly,
Carrie Chapman Catt.
It was decided to act upon the sugges
tion of the lady, and the secretary was
directed to communicate with Mrs. Dick
inson. Many similar letters were read
from various parts of the country and
from private citizens. A letter was read
from the secretary of the Union Leaeue
staling that this body had taken hold of
the matter in earnest, and had appointed
ex-Judge Cooney, T, L. Ford ana Colonel
Castle to represent the lea us in the gen
eral comm.ttee. Judge Cooney stated
that a list is already started in the Union
League, and a large sale of certificates is
promised. He said that the proposition
had rriet witb the greatest enthusiasm,
and that at least 200 certificates will be
disposed of very shortly.
Chairman Bailey of the reception com
mittee called up tue matter of celebrating
Lincoln's any in the public schools on
May 2S. In many place* in the East it is
celebrated on February 12. This inquiry
brought out the reply from the president
ihat the former nate had already been
selected lor this State and in the after
noon of that day veterans of the Grand
Army would entertain the children by
war stories and that exercises will re held
by the children themselves. Mr. Br6oks,
he stated, is tnaMftiog this feature.
Air. Stone further said that the Martha
Washington Council will give an enter
tainment in Union-square Hall on May
12 for the benefit of the Lincoln fund.
It was decided that after a little while
the names of all who became members of
the association, by the purchase oi cer
tificates and by donations, shall be puo
iisued.
AMATEUR BOXING BOUTS.
The San Francisco Athletic Club Gave
a Very Interesting Entertainment.
The San Francisco Athletic Club gave
one of its interesting amateur entertain
ments last evening in its rooms, 431%
Sixth street. A large crowd was prasent
and the spectators were highly pleased
with tne evening's sport.
Alex G reggains, the club's boxing in.
structor, who is matched to fight Steve
O'Donnell in June, came up from his
training quarters at Sargents station yes
terday and assisted the officers of "the
cud in their efforts to mixHe the enter
tainment a succe-s.
The boxing afforded great amusement.
Corcoran ami Kirchner sparrea four very
spirited rounds, and Sullivan met Schui
ler in a four-round bout, which was also
very entertaining. The evening's sport
concluded with a rattling four-round con
test between Young Sliarkey and Frank
McConnell.
DEATH OF MR. HIRSCHBACH.
The Former Musical Director of the
Tivoli Passes Away.
Joseph Hirschbach, the well-known
musician of this City, died yesterday
morning at a local sanitarium, where he
had been under treatment lor an extended
period.
Mr. Hirschbach formerly was the leader
of the Tivoli orchestra, and was al o
prominent in other musical circles. He
was about 35 years of age, and leaves no
family other than relatives in New York.
The funeral will be held to-morrow,
probably at the Temple Emanu-EI. At
the services the jnusic will be rendered by
the prominent singers irom the Tivoli
Opera-house, while the orchestra, under
the direction of Carl Martens, will also
assist.
SPECIAL CONVENTION KATES.

ductions on Its Linos.
Special rates will be made by the South
ern Pacific Company from points on its

A SETBACK
FOR THE
TEACHERS
The New Annuity Law
Said to Be Uncon
stitutional.
AUDITOR BRODERICK TO
FIGHT IT,
Declares That the Act of the
Legislature Will Not Hold
Water.
IT IS DISCRIMINATING IN ITS
EFFECTS.
The Watchman of th* City Treasury
Will Not Tura Pub ie Funds
Into Private Hands.
The Teachers' Annuity and Retirement
Yu- 1 Commissioners, recently organized
under the law passed by the last Legisla
ture, will run against a snag when it at
tempts to carry out the law passed by the
tiate soions.
Auditor Broderick has been giving the
matter serious thought for several days
past, and has come to the conclusion tnat
the law is unconstitutional, and that he
cannot conscientiously carry out the
assigned to him, that of signing n certain
demand for the transfer of a portion of
the School Department fund: ; , as contem
plated by the law.
"I am sorry to put this bar in the way
of the commission,'' said the Auditor yes
terday, 'for it appears that the teachers
are very much in favor of the new law,
but 1 cannot see my way clear, and I can
not afford, as the Auditor of ttns City,
and responsible for the demands on the
treasury, to do anything that will lay my
bondsmen liable to an action for the re
covery of the iunds paid out under an ille
gal act.
"I have given this matter 9er:ous con
sideration, and I find It to be full of flaws.
In several of its sections it is discrimi
nating, and I do not think that it will
hold water. The main trouble is that
while the mnds to pay the teachers re
tired annuities come partly out of the
School Department appropriation, the
commission is placed outside the au
thority of the City government and is
therefore in the position o: a private body
paining a portion of its support from i Ã¼b
lie money. This is, of course, an absurdity.
"This matter appears in section 10 of
the act, which reacts as follows:
t-ec. 10. The public schoolteachers' annuity
and retirement iund herein provided lor
Khali consist of the following, with the in
come mid interest thereof: (1) Twelve dol
lars (sl-) per school year ot the salaries paid
to all those subject to the burdens of this act
in each couu.y or consolidated city and
county shall be deducted irojn the warrants
for salary and raid by the Treasurer of tne
county or consolidated ciiy or county to the
public Behooltc-acUers' retirement fund com
misjionersof said county or city and county;
and v shail be the duty of the setretarv of tue
Board of Education in every incorporated city
or town or consolidated city and county anil
the secretary of tae board of" trustees of every
school district outside of such city and towu
or consolidated city and county to note in
each warrant the amount to l>e deducted by
tne treasurer. (II) AH money* received
from gi!.-s bequests and devises, or from en y
other source. (Ill) All money, pay, compen
sation or salary lorfcited, deducted or with
hold from tne warrant or demand ior salary
ot any teacher or teachprs for and on account
of absence from duty fru:a any cause, wnich
the hoard of Education of every incorporated
city or town, or the Board of Tiustees of every
school district outside of sucn city or town,
may appropriate and set apart for the alore
hatd fund; and said Hoard of Education or
Boards of Trustees are nereby empowered to
apl>roprlftte .>:ucii moneys or any jiart thereof
for sucii fund; provided, that in consolidated
cities and counties alter the establishment of
on annuity fund therein.it is iiereby made the
duty of Boards of Education to appropriate,
monttily, at ieasi oue-halt of such moneys
for fcucii iund.
"This, you see, provides that half of the
money that is gained by the City and
County through the deductions from
teachers' salaries because of absence must
be turned into the annuity fund. These
are clearly public funds and must, if the
law holds, be turned over to the private
body. It cannot be done legally, and
when the warrant for the transfer of that
money comes down to me, as it must, I
will refuse to sign it and test the law in
that way.
"Section 8 of the act discriminates be
tween teachers now in ihe department
and those who may come in later, and I
believe that also renders it unconstitu
tional.
"Then there is section 6. that provides
for the appointment of a committee of rive
to pass on applications for retirement.
The commissioners must act as this com
mittee desires, and it gives a chance for a
combination by which the friends of a
majority oi the committee may help their
friends in a very substantial way. Of
courEe I do not cay that such a thing
would occur, but it might, and we cannot
take chances.
"There are other sections to which
serious objection might be made, and on
the whole I do not think the law will hold
water. It will have to be tested by the
courts and upheld before I will sign any
warrants transferring the funds."
The Tecci;ers : Annuity and Retirement
.fund Commissioners are Mayor Pnelan,
president; City Treasurer Widber, treas
urer, and Superintendent of Schools Web
ster, secretary.
At the meeting of the Board of Educa
tion last evening Chairman Waller of the
.Finance Committee, in his emimate of the
appropriation necessary for the coming
ii-cal year, placed the amount to be turned
into the teachers' retirement and annuity
fund at $14,400.
I* Not a Public Street.
The Supreme Court has ellirsned the decision
of the lower court in the case of San Joaquin
County against George B. Sperry and wile.
The plaintiff enaeavored to have declared as a
public highway a etrip of land running
-Jir.mgh tne Kperry aduitiou of the ciiy of
rtockton. The lÂ»nd is not within the corpor
ate limitsof the ciiy. .Sperry sold a number
of lots to home-seekers with the distinct under
standing that the streets, although laid out.
had not been and would not be dedicated to
the city or opened to public use. Judgment
â was given ior the defendants on the ground
that during all time the streets were never
opened Â»o the general travel of the public,

Death of Kdwin .). Grady.
Edwin J. Grsdy of 503 Golden Gate avenue
was found dead in bis bed yesterday morning.
The deceased had been under the care of a
physician for some time, and was being treat
ed for cancer In the stomach. He was room
ing nt the residence of his sister, Mrs. Kate
Fishbourne. His brother is John U. Grady,
ex-Tax Collector of this City.
There being no doubt that Grady died from
natural causes, the Coroner did not remove
the body to the Morgue.
THE NEW CHIEF JUSTICE OF SAMOA.
William L. Chambers, the newly appointed Chief Justice of Samoa, arrived here
yesterday from Washington, D. C, on the way to his post, and will sail on the
Monowai this evening. His family will probably follow him soon. All would have
gone together, as the Justice says, but his little daughter has an affection of the eyes
and is at present under the care of a New YorK specialist.
Justice Chambers was formerly United States Land Commiskioner in Samoa, and
is well informed in regard to the effairs of the islands. He succeeds Chief Justice Ide
of Vermont, who resigned January 1 last. The position is for life, like other judicial
places r.y appointment.
"The court is already organized there," said Justice Chambers to a Call repre
sentative, "so there isn't much to Â»ay about that. I had a great many applications
for position? as secretary and for marshalships and other places. However, I told
them all that the place? were filled, at least for the present, as the men there all
understand the work well.
"The Chief Justice occupies a rather unique position. He has the veto power, in
case of any disagreement between the municipal council and the three national
consuls, on ths Jaws that are passed. Unaer the tripartite treaty of Berlin, the three
powers, Germany, England and the United States, are all represented by consuls, and
all of the^e Governments appointed me to this office. They all joined.
"Mr. Cleveland first appointed me, and four days after that I got a letter from
Germany saying I had been appointed dv that country, and this letter was written
eight days before Cleveland appointed me. A little later England, which haÂ» always
been friendly to us in the island matters, notified me of appointment The position
of Chief Justice is for life, or at least as long as the present treaty stipulations exist."
Justice Chambers' home was, until he settled at Washington, D. C, three years
ago, at Sheffield, Ala. He says Judge Ida will not immediately return here. He will
go on around the world and meet his daughter, who is in Germany.
HONOR AWAITS
THEM TO-NIGHT
League of the Cross Cadets
Ready for the Competi
tive Drill.
Bishop Montgomery Has Come
From Los Angeles for the
Event.
General Jsmes Will Review the Boys
and Prominent Guardsmen Will
Be Present.
The competitive drill of the League of
the Cross Cadets that takes place at Me
chanics' Pavilion to-ni^ht will be a notable
event both from a military standpoint
and from the prominence of the people |
who will witness it.
Bishop Montgomery of Los Angeles,
who was the founder of the league and
who presented the magnificent diamond
trophy for which the youngsters will com
pete, has come up from his southern
home for the special purpose of being
present at the drill, and he will occupy a
prominent position in the exercises in
company with Archbishop Kiordan and
other eminent Catholic dignitaries.
Bishop Montgomery takes particular
pride in his beys and their work, and it is
quite likely that he will establish a simi
lar organization in Los Angeles.
A review previous to the drill has been
tendered to Major-General N. T. James,
division commander of the National
Guard of California, and other prominent
guardsmen in the persons of General
Warfield and his staff. Cal Smith and the
other officers of the First Regiment, Na
tional Guard, will be present in their full
uniforms.
Co'onel Commanding William P. Snlli
van Jr. of the cadets has worked long and
faithtully to bring the companies up to
their present state of efficiency, and those
who have seen them drill say that they
compare favorably with any of the com
panies of the National Guard.
The excitement among the lads them
selves is intense from the fact that only
four companies will compete, the fortu
nate ones having been chosen at a recent
tryout. The four companies will be noti
fied of their selection immediately after
the review, and up to that time will not
know of the honor that avails them.
The assemblage will be addressed by
B.shop Montgomery, wno will speak of
the history of the organization and of the
benefits that have accrued to its members
and to the community generally since it
was formed. â¢
One of the pleasing features of the en
tertainment will be a concert by the
league band, numbering forty pieces,
which will discou^e sweet music, begin
ning at 7:30 o'clock and lasting until tho
drill begins. This aggregation will also
furnish the marches for the drill. This is
the band's first appearance, but it has
been practicing steadily under competent
leaders.
No seats will be sold at the Pavilion to
day, hut all who desire to attend can pro
cure them at Sherman <fc days up to 5
p. M. The Pavilion has been handsomely
decorated lor the occasion.
Grand or I'etty Larceny.
An interesting: point was made by the Su
preme Court yesterday in the appealed case
cf Harry McElroy, convicted of grand larceny.
McElroy and James Shaw hnd their teds close
together in the open air. The latter used his
trousers, containing $17, ns his piliow. Dur
ing the night the garment was abstracted and
the money stolen. McKlroy was charged ana
convicted of grand larceny. The point in the
apppiil was that under the law tne crime
charged wes not Brand larceny. This was up
held Dy the Supreme Court," which decided
that the crime was at the most petty larceny
as the money was not taken from the person
ol Shaw. A new trial was ordered.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 1897.
WARRANTS FOR
HOG RANCHERS
Five of Them Must Answer
for Vioiating the Ordi
nances.
Returned to Old Locations After
Having Promised Not to
Do So.
The Board of Health Has Opened a
Crusade That Will Be Vigor
â¢ ously Prosecuted.
Tho Board of Health has reopened its
cru?sde against, the hog ranchers, who
have been treating the law as though it
had no existence, with renewed vigor, and
prosecutions will follow in rapid succes
sion until all have complied with the
ordinances or the board nas found itself
powerless to enforce the same. The
matter is of vast interest and importance
to the thousands of people who live in
ths outlying districts, and the action of
the health authorities will be hailed with
delight.
Several months ago the board attempted
to make a number of hog ranchers respect
the law and swore out warrants for their
arrest. The matter was not pressed be
cause the ranchers aereed io move out
side the limits specified and fixed by thÂ«
Board ot Supervisors, and they did so.
Since ttien, however, a number have re
turned to their old haunts and are carry
ing on tneir business as. of yore and as
though the ordinance banishing them
from residence districts did not exist.
This is particularly the case in the Bay
View district, where the country is rapidly
building up. A, number of complaints of
the insanitary condition of the pens in
S that section have recently been made.
The residents say the stench is unbeara
ble and threaten to move unless the nuis
ance be abated.
The Health Department took cogni
tance of the matter a lew cUys ago and
I directed Inspector Kinney, in whose dis
[ trict the ranches are located, to procure
evidence that could be used to convict the
hoe men in the Police courts.
Yesterday five warrants were sworn out
and placed in the hands of Special Health
OBicer Butterworth, with instructions to
serve them. The ranchers will make a
lesal fight and have arranged to give bail
through their attorneys without going to
jail.
Tnose for whom warrants were issued
| are: Joe Leach, Twenty-ninth avenue,
between H and I streets; George Stam
bausjl), II street, corner of Nineteenth ave
nue; Edward Svenaon, Thirty-third nve
nue, near I street; John Garabaldi, Thirty
third avenue, between I and J streets;
| John Karren, Thirty-lirst avenue, between'
J and X streets.
Leach, Garabaldi and Farren are the
men /or whom warrants were previously
sworn out, and all recently returned to
their old locations after having promised
not to do so.
When the Bay View district has been
attended to others will be taken up and
the law enforced to the letter.
Admitted to Practice.

following forty-five lawyers to practice before

CREATURE OR TOOL
IN ALLEGED LIBEL
Attorney S. M. Shortridge
Reads Some Defi
nitions.
Dan M Burns and Dan T. Cole
Were John F. Sheehan's
Bondsmen.
Three Times They Assumed That
Eurden, and Attorney Watt Also
Had a Three-Fold Obligation.
Whether Judge J. C. B. Hebbard was or
was not the "creature" or "tool" of de
signing men has turned out to be the most
important point in the libel case against
Editor Frederick Marriott of the News
Letter, now on trial in Judge Dainger
lield's court.
Samuel M. Shortridge in his opening
statement on behalf of Mi. Marriott an
nounced that he expected to justify the
use of the words to which objection was
made by showing that Judge HebDard,
either wittingly or unwittingly, had Deen
used by designing men to further their
own selfish ends.
At the morning session yesterday Mr.
Shortridge read from the records of Judge
Hebbard's court to show that General
John P. Sheehan had been appointed re
ceiver of the People's Home Savings Bank
three times by judge Hebbard, and that
in each case his bondsmen were Colonel
Dan M. Burns and Dan T. Cole, the
amount of the bond being $50,000.
Another document was introduced to
show that Judge Hebbard relieved the re
ceiver from all liability under I, is bond
upon bis being chosen as manager of the
same bank, and exonerated his bondsmen,
without requiring an accounting from
him, as the" law directs; also that his
friend James Alva Watt was attorney for '
Receiver Sneehan and for the bank at the
same time.
Then came readings of definitions of
the words "creature" and "tool," concern
ing which so much has been said. The
following was quoted from the Imperial
Dictionary:
Creature, v [0. Fr. creature, L L. creature.
See create]. 1. That which is created; a
thing.
Water, a creature so common and needful.â
fuller,
cod's first creature was light. â Bacon.
2. A created being; any living being.
Yet crime la her could never creature find.â
Spenser.
lor so work thÂ« honÂ«y bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The a. i of order to a peopled kingdom.
â -"hufcesppare.
Millions of spiritual creature* walk thÂ» earth
Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.
-Miliou.
3. A human being, in contempt or endear- i
cunt; as, an idle creature; what a creature!
a pretty creature; a sweet crecture.
Poor creature,â Johnson.
The world hath not a sweeter creature.âShakes
peare.
4. A person who owes his rise and fortune to
another; one who is subjjet to the will or in- !
fluence ol another; a . instrument; a tool.
Great princes thus, when favorites they praise,
To Justify their cruet their creatures r .isÂ«?.
â liryden.
Both Charles himself and his creature i.aud.
Macaulay.
Touching the word "tool" the sub
joined from the Century Dictionary was :
quoted:
Tool, n. 1. A mechanical implement; any I
implement used by a craftsman or laborer at ,
his work, etc.
2. Relates to use of tools by ether workers.
3. One who or that which is made a means
to some end; especii.l y a person so used; a
mere instrument to execute the purpose of an
other; a cats paw.
4. A useless or shiftless tellow. * â¢ * In
figurative use instrument is generally em
ployed n a good sense, but tool in a dishonor- I
able and contemptuous sense; we speak of a j
mttu as the instrument of providence, or as a
mere tool ol cunning men.
"In the sense of a dependent being," |
Mr. Shortridge added, " 'English common
law is the creature of Christianity.' 'Am
I not here whom you have made your ]
creature, that I owe my being to?' These \
lines, gentlemen, are from the pen of Ben '
Jonson."
The last definition of the term pro- '
pounded by Mr. Shortridge evoked sud
aued applause. He said: "The word is
used, gentlemen of the jury, quite com
monly in the light of an intoxicating
drink, especially whisky."
Mr. Shortridee further quoted: "'Every '
creature of God is good,' " which appeared I
to imply that while some brands oi whisky j
might bÂ« better than others, there was
probably no bad whisky.
" 'I find my master took too much of the
creature last night, and Is angling for a
quarrel,'" pursued Mr. Shortridge, quot- !
ing from Dryden's "Amphitryon," and
thus ended the lesson in the use of an im
portant word in the English language.
Counsel for the prosecution in the course
of the trial more than once virtually con
fessed that a charge of libel could not be
maintained on the use of the word "creat
ure." They were therefore confined to
the construction which could be put on
the word "tool."
It was noted that Deputy District At- I
torney Hinkle was unusually quiet during
the day's proceeding, but Julius Kahn,
special attorney for the prosecution, was
as bustling and full of objections as ever.
James Alva Watt was called to the wit
ness-stand by the defendant's attorney.
Mr. Watt said he had been an attorney
at-law for fourteen years, and confessed
to a wide acquaintance with prominent
eentlemen. including General John F.
Sheehan, General Samuel â W. Backus,
General W. 11. H. Hart, Colonel George
Stone. Judce Hebbard, Lawyer H. W.
Hutton and Attorney T. Carl Spelling.
Mr. Wati and Judge Hebbard had been
friends for sixteen years, but were not
schoolmates.
Mr. Watt had also met T. H. McCarthy.
a member of the depositors' committee of
the People's Home Savings Bank. When
an effort was made to draw out a conver
sation between Watt and McCarthy,
which would tend to show the intimate
relations existing between Watt and

Judge Hebbard, the attorney for the pros
ecution objected vociferously. The scene
was very lively.
Mr. Shortridgeâ Do you recall a conversa
tion with Mr. McCarthy in Mr. Huttou's office
in which
Mr. Khlm â Right here we object.
The courtâ What is the ground of the objec
tion?
Mr. Shortridgeâ Your Honor, I had not
finished my question and counsel doe? not
know whether he objects or not. I protest
against the irrepressible Mr. Kahn's methods.
The courtâ Counsel for the prosecution is
certainly not in order. Counsel for the de
fense has a right to state his question.
This surprised the lawyer for the prose
cution, as he had begun to think he could
have everything just to suit himself.
Mr. Shortridge (to witness)â Do you recall
that conversation in which you spoke of Judge
Helbnrd's willingness to modify the People's
Home Savings Bank Injunction under certain
circumstances?
Mr. Wattâ I do. I was talking with Mr. Hut
ton when Mr. McCarthy came in.
Mr. Shortridgeâ Did you insist that Receiver
Sheehan should be a member of the new
board as a condition of allowing a reorganiza-
Mr. Wattâ l may have suggested it, but I
don't remember that I insisted on it. I am
willing to state the entire conversation so far
as I remember it.
Mr. Shortridgeâ Did you say to Mr. McCarthy
that Judge Jlcbbard was your friend, and
that you would use your influence to prevent
a modification of the injunction by Judge
Heboard unless Mr. Sheehan were included in
the new list of directors?
Mr. Watt â Not in those words, and not as
imp. ied in your question. I will explain the
conversation if you will permit me to do so.
Mr. Shortridgeâ That is your right. Please
give your explanation.
Mr. Watâ 1 siid substantially that I was
satisfied Judge Hebburd would not modify the
li junction unless he was satisfied that a fair
board of directors would be chosen. Some
thing was said about my being a" lriend of
Judge Hebhnr-l, but I laid claim to no greater
or other influence than a lawyer with a just
CRUse would iiave before a court.
Mr. Shortridgeâ Did you say to Mr. Mc-
Carthy that tin; ess Mr. Sheehan would be put
in the new directorate his plan for reorganiza
tion couldn't go?
Mr. Wattâ Not in those words. I went to
Mr. Mutton's office to adjust the difficulties. I
suggested General Sheeuan as a good man for
the place. He had been appointed receiver by
Judge Hebbard, and would doubtless have
been acceptable to Judge Hebuard as a
director.
Mr. Shortridgeâ Were you Mr. Sheehan's
attorney at that time?
Mr. Wattâ Yes.
Mr. Shortridgeâ And subsequently attorney
for the bank?
Mr. Wattâ Well, yes. I was elected attorney
by the directors.
Mr. Shortridgeâ And acted as such attorney
for the bank while still attorney for the re
ceiver?
Mr. Wattâ Yes, part of the time. I appeared
as attorney ior the bank before the receiver
was discharged.
Mr. Shortridgeâ While attorney for both the
receiver and ior the bank did you appear as
attorney for certain stockholders?
Mr. wattâ l represented some stockholders
at that time. Ido not remember that I signed
any papers as attorney lor such stuckho.ders
duriug that time, but I may have done so.
There was a great deal of .itigation and 1 was
asked to help straighten out the tangle.
In the afternoon Mr. Watt went into an
explanation of the court proceedings
winch followed the failure of the bank.
Mr. Kahn said tue cross-examination
would be bief. He asked if t.e had con
sulted with Judge Hebbard in regard to
w at the Judge would do in regard to
modifying the injunction.
Mr. Shortridge said tne question was
objectionable ior the reason ihat calling a
man a tool is not 'a reflection on the char
acter of a Judte. It does nut imply moral
turpitude. Il designing men should con
federate to impose on a c. urt and succeed
in carrying out their plan it may be said
that they made v tool ol the court â un
wittingly, it may be, but the fact remains,
and tne court would not arraign the man
who said the court had been made a tool
of, but would Dunish those who took ad
vantage of the court. The dictionaries
read in the presence of the jury showed
that the word "tool" merely means a
catspaw. In the old story "it waa the
monkey that used the paw of the cat to
draw the chestnuts from the fire, and so
it is here. Th-re was no reflection on the
cat; but somebody had beea "monkey
ing" with the court.
The assumption that the court knew
nothing of the matter made it ali the
stronger, said Mr. (Shortridge, for it would
be unlikely that designing men who in
tended to make use of a Judge would tell
him of it; in any view the question is im
material.
Judge Dam ertield said there are two
meanings of the word tool. The ordinary
sense of the word is bad, but the word may
be used harmlessly. He thought the State
had r rigli: to show whether Judge Heb
bard was made aware of Mr. Watt's alleged
boasts.
The question was pllowed and Mr. Watt
said he did not tell Judge Hebbard any
thing about it,
Mr. Shortridge said that he regretted
that the attorneys for the State insisted
on trying Judge Heb^ard instead of the
defendant, and called General John F.
Fheetian, who said he had held several
offices, notably Registrar of the United
States Land Office, brigardier-general,
adjutant-general, Bank Commissioner,
and now is secretary and treasurer of the
Yosemite Park Com miss on, with a salary
of $75 a month and much responsibility.
He had got to the point of acknowledging
the existence of a warm friendship bo
twesn himself and Judge Hebbard when
T. H. McCarthy, one of the unhappy
People's Home Savings Bank depositors,
entered the courtroom, and Mr. Sheehcn
temporarily gave up his place on the
witness-stand.
Mr. McCarthy was asked by Mr. Short
ridge to tell theconversa;ion that occurred
between him and Mr. Wait in Mr. Hut
ton's office, bat Mr. Hinkle objected un
less the attorney for the defenaant could
show that Judge Hebbard knew of what
Mr. Watt had promised or boasted.
Mr. Stiortridae said he could prove only
one thing at a time. He proposed to prove
that Mr. Watt had boasted of his influence
and that afterward things came out just
as he had said.
Judze Daingerfieid remarked that the
rule of law as he understood it required
that tfce defense must, show the intent of
Judge Hebbard in order to establish justi
fication.
Not at all, Mr. Shortridge contended.
Judge Hebbard was not on trial. He was
not tryine to convict Judge Hebbard, but
to acquit Mr. Marriott. The existence of
Judge Hebbard is a mere incident in this
trial. He taicJ that he had drawn atten
tion time after time to the fact that Judge
Hebbard's knowledge of this conversa
tion is immaterial as a matter of law, yet
as a matter of fact he would be able to
show that Judge Hebbard had full knowl
edge of all the facts from beginning to
end.
At this point an adjournment was taken
until 10 o'clock this morning.

UPON THE
ISSUES
Counsel in the Fair Case
Again at Logger
heads.
JUDGE CURTIS' MAIDEN
SPEECH.
He Argues for Simplicity in the
Enlightenment of the
Jury.
LANDLORD CASSOU ON THE
GRIDDLE.
He Essays to Explain Why He Muti
lated the Register of the
Parisian Hotel.
One more effort was made yesterday
morning by tDe attorneys representing the
contending sides in the litigation over
Mrs. N'jttie Craven's deeds to property
claimed by the Fair estate, to agree upon
the exact issues involved and to be pre
sented to the jury. But failure again at
tended their efforts, and it will now be the
province of Judge Slack to determine this
momentous point.
The entire forenoon of yesterday's ses
sion was given over to the argument of
this proposition, and in consequence the
jury was given a half holiday. Mr. Del
mas did not do the talking for the de
fense on this occasion, tnat taslc being as
signed to his associate?, General DicLin
son and Judge Curtis, the celebrated New
York probate lawyer. This was the lat
ter's ileimt as an actual pleader in the
case, and he made a most favorable imÂ»
â¢ t>resÂ«ion as an able, logical and eloquent
Ei'eaker.
General Dickinson opened the argument
by presenting the issues tnai the defense
c<nsi.je:s would be proper to present to
the jury. These were short and simple.
Incidents and Actors of Another Day in the Fair Case.
They were four in number as follows:
First, whether the deed to the Pine and
SanÃome streets property was genuine;
second, as to the deed to the Eleventh and
Mission streets property; thinl and fourth,
the genuineness of the acknowledgments
to these respective deeds.
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler offered the
imbues proposed Dy the executors and the
intervenor, Miss Virginia Fair. They
were: Firstâ The claim of Mrs. Craven to
the property in question based upon two
deeds purporting to have been executed
by Senator Fair in her favor and to have
been acknowledged by Notary J. J. Cooney
on September 27, 1894. Second â Does she
claim to have Decorue possessed of the
property by meame of the deeds in ques
tion? Third â Are thf deeds in question
merely forgeries? Fourth â Were they
executed after the death of Senator Fair?
Fifth â "Were the deeds acknowledged
while Fair was alive and while Cooney
was a notary?
Judge Curtis then took the floor and ar
gued in support of the defense's sugges
tions. He said their rirst virtue was their
simplicity. They were well within the
pale of the pleadings. He thought that
the deeds and the acknowledgments were
separate and distinct â really four inde
pendent acts. The Issues could not be
blended. They were either legal acts or
felonious acts, nnd each was entitled to a
separate scrutiny.
Mr. Wheeler would not bow to Mr. Cur
tis' argument He claimed that no inde
pendent issues were involved. He argued
that it would not do to allow that one
deed might be genuine and the other spu
rious; or, for that matter, that the deeds
were genuine and the acknowledgments
false.
Neither pule would give in, so the court
took the whole matter under advisement.
There was not a treat deal that was i.i
tf-restins: in the afternoon proceedings.
The baiting of Cassou, the San Rafael
hotel-keeper, by Mr. Delmas was the chief
feature outside of frequent scares the
lawyers and spectators were given by the
cracking of the reiiing of ihe courtroom
and the showers of plastering occasioned
by the gang ot workmen who are attach
ing a new roof to the City Hall. The lat
ter disturbance grew to be so threatening
that Judge Slack was compelled to call
uron the Sheriff to put a stop to it.
Cassou took the stand immediately after
court reconvened and the crosE-ezamina
t:o:i was resumed.
Directly from the start Attorney Del
rj):j 3 began quizzing the witness as to
whether or not he had ever demanded
niont-y for bis evidence and records. This
' MSon ucnied vehemently.
'I nev r asked a cent for my testi
! niony," ne said, growing somewhat ex
c;;eu". "i told them 1 would tell all 1
x knew if called into court, and I didn't
want anything for it.' 1
"Are you sure about that?" persisted
Mr. D.-lmas.
'On, ye?, very sure."
"Now, isn't it a fact that you demanded
$10,000 for your evidence 1"
â¢ Never, sir. But they offered me $1000."
"Who did?"
"Why, Sberlfl Healey."
"Oh, that's a, eh?"' Mr. Delmas was
now standing erect and had his eyes fast
ened upon the .witness menacingly. "Now
listen, Mr. Cassou," he said. "When that
offer was made to you didn't you refuse it
as being insufficient and demand $10,090?"
"No, no, sir."
In response to another line of questions
Cassou retold his story of Senator Fair's
indisposition during bin stay at the Pa
risian Hotel. But he was- more elaborate
in the details he gave tills time, remem
bering now that instead of being a consist
j ent sufferer from asthma the millionaire
I was also taken down with a violent abdo
-1 minal complaint. Cassou was sure that it
j was on the night of the 20th of September,
i 1894, that the Senator was at his worst.
| The witness said that some time in Janu
ary or February last he told these facts to
i Attorney Dutticey of San Rafael and Wil
liam P. Lawlor, who baid they had been
sent to nini by the attorney for the ex
ecutors of the Fair estate.
While giving one of his answers at this
! lime Cassou was seen to wink at Attor
neys McEnerney and Pierson, and Mr.
: Delraas, noticing it, demanded an expla
nation.
'Oh, I always wink," said Casbou, some
what sheepishly.
"Always wink when?:' asked Mr. Del
mas.
"When I am talkingâ when lam telling
the truth."
"Do you only wink, then, when you are
| telling the truth?"
Cassou was not sure whether this was
what he meant or not, and squirmed
â  about in his chair uneasily during his ef
! forts to escape from his dilemma. This
he did not succeed in doing until Delmas
| finally grew charitable and ceased to ques
; tion him further on the subject.
Cassou, resuming, told Mr. Delmas how
careful he had been to preserve the hotel
1 register and his cash-book, and said that
| among other things he had taken the
i precaution to have these exhibits photo
; graphed. A Mr. Kytka did the work, and
1 the witness paid lor the negatives out of
j his own pocket. Cassou was prompted to
j do this by his brother.
"Why dirt you resort to these precau-
I tions?" asked Mr. Delmas.
"Oh, I don't know. I puess 1 was afraid
somebody might steal them," said Cassou.
"Why should anybody want to steal
them?"
"Well, I knew they were big evidence
! for the court, and I wanted to keep them
i so as to tell my story in court."
"In what respect were they such im
j portant evidence?"
"Why, Senator Fair's name was there."
"But that would only be important in
the event that it were shown that be put
his name there on a certain date, would it
not?"
"Yes, sir." 'V -^ .
"And that register does not show what
date Senator Fair signed his name, does
it?"
"No." ; â¢â¢:
Mr. Delmas desisted, then, with the
quiet remark that the importance of the
exhibits was not so overwhelming after
all. . . :
Cassou was excused from the stand fora
few minutes in order to permit Superin
tendent F. B. Latham of the North Pacific i
Coast Railroad to inform the cour: about
the time schedule of his line as it existed
in September, 1904. Then Cassou was re
turned to the griddle.
Mr. Delma3 reproduced the hotel reg
ister ana asked Cas9ou if any of the pages
had ever been torn out of it. The witness
admitted that he had removed t:;e blotter
page opposite the sheet upon which Sen
, ator Fair's signature appeared. He did j
this, he said, because some ink had been
spilled upon it. In reference to some
mucilage stains that showed on the im- j
j portant page in evidence he explained I
I that when it became generally known
j among his guests that Fair's signature
| vran there he feared that the page might
j be mutilated and to preserve it pasted the j
j corners down to the adjoining sheet,
i There were some odd creases' in the page,
j but Cassou could not account for them.
He also said he had torn a, number of I
other pages from the register, but could !
not remember when.
â¢ Cassou was excused from the stand and
Superior Judge J. V. Coffey succeeded j
him. The Judge said he and Jere Coffey '
i went to San Rafael on September 22, 1894, |
j and stopped at the Parisian Hotel. He I
| remembered having seen Senator Fair
there that day and again on Sunday
evening. The witness left for San Fran
cisco the following morningâ the 24th of
Septemberâ but did not see the Senator
that day.
\V. B. Schneider, who-e father and
brother bad been witnesses before him
was now called to the witness-stand. He
said he was a liveryman of San Rafael.
Schneider was called for the purpose of
stating when .Mutt Gillian, the hack
driver who drove Senator Fair around San
Rafael, arrived in tnat town witn bis rig.
By referring to his books be was able to
say that-GUligan got there from Virginia
City on the 22d of Serjtember, 1894, and re
mained there until the 25ih. While there
Uilligan kept his Horses at the stable of
th* witness.
â¢ Mr. Delmas tooK occasion on cross
examination to again call attention, by
means of witness' answers, to the fact
that the San Francisco Police Department
has been most active ii. hunting up evi
cenco for the plaintiffs in this case. De
tective Seymour, he said, had paid him
his fees and expenses , and looked after
him while liÂ« was on this side of the bay.
Court adjourned with Schneider still on
the wiloess-stand. Judge Slack will hold
court to-day in the Supervisors' chamber
instead ol in Department 10, where tie has
been located since toe tutu began. ' -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 1897.
COVET VALLEY
ROAD TRAFFIC
Important Hearing Before
the Railroad Com
mission.
Contracts Between Common Car
riers the Subj ct of Long
Argument.
Attorney Preston Showed That Such
Contracts Have Been Held to
Be L. : .;u â¢
In connection with the persistent efforts
of the Union Transportation Company of
Stockton to secure a share of the Valley road
traffic, the Railroad Commission was oc
cupied yesterday afternoon in listening to
arguments on the status of traffic agree
ments between connecting common car
riers. The nub of the contest is involved
in the validity or invalidity of such con
tracts.
The investigation that began formally
yesterday was inaugurated by the tiling of
a complaint against the Valley road by
James Gillis, president of the Union Trans
portation Company,
The complaint charges discrimination
and alleges that tbe Valley road "has se
cretly and unlawfully combined and con
tracted with me California Navigation
and Improvement Company for the carry
ing of freight and passengers uvcr its line
; of railroad at a lowÂ» r rate than it charges
; the public and the Union Transportation
Company for like services."
It cites as an illustration of alleged dis
crimination the following facts: The reg
ular pa^stnger rate of the Valley road
fr^m fctockfon to Fresno is $3 05. Tne
regular rate of the Calnornia Navigation
and Improvement Company ironi Â£an
Francisco to Stockton is 125 cents. The
regular joint rate of the two companies
from Ban Francisco to Fresno is $3 75.
Ttie answer of the Valley road denies
the charge of discrimination in favor of
tbe California Navigation and Improve-
ment Company, it explains the "Valley
road's position as follows:
In order to give the general public the
benefit of competitive through rates for
both passengers and freight less than the
sum of the two local rates between the
same points is charged. It adds that the
Valley road does not consider that it
would be fur the best interests of the pub
lic for it to make any traffic arrangement
I with the Union Transportation Company.
I In conclusion ti>e answer says: '"The only
( complaint of the Union Transportation
Company is that this corporation does not
deem it advisable to enter into business
relations with such company which would
enable it to bind this company by the
joint operation of both lines."
Â£. F. Preston, the attorney for the Val-
I ley road, represented that corporation,
and the Union Transportation Company's
case was in the hands ol S. M. Spurrier
and C. H. Fairall.
Alexander Mackey, secretary of the
j Valley road, was the rirst witness.
Fairall asked if the Valley road had
j made a contract concerning rates with the
I California Navigation and Improvement
Company. Tuis precipitated an argument
on the keynote to the whoic situation.
Preston objected fo the question, and
declared the existence ol such v contract
| was admitted in the pleadings, and as
serted that the question was put for the
purpose of Retting information concerning
I the private and secret business affairs of
| the two companies interested in such con-
I tract. He Claimed that traffic agreements
j between connec:ing common carriers had
j been repeatedly declared valid by the
courts ot the United States, notwithstand
ing the efforts of competing carriers to
break into the Dusiness of the contracting
common carriers by legal proceedings to
have traffic agreements declared illegal.
Faira.l contended that all the decisions
cited and quoted by Preston wore made in
ihe absence of State statutes or constitu
tional provisions, and were based on the
common law and the interstate commerce
law. In this State, he said, there were
both constitutional and stn;utory provi
sions which declared traffic agreements
such as that in question to ba illegal. In
supfortof his claim he quoted from Arti
cle XII, Section 17, of the California Con
stitution, as follows:
Every rullroÃd company * â¢ â¢ shall re
ceive and transport each the other's passen
gers, tonnage and cars without delay or dig
crimination.
ThÂ« point was apparently overlooked
that this applied to railroads only. He
also quoted from section 2170 of the Civil
Code, as follows:
A common carrier must not srive preference,
in time, price or otherwise, to one person over
another.
FairaJl claimed that the word person
included corporations and that the statute
therefore applied to the case under con
sideration. He declared that the contract
between the Valley road ana its water,
connection was illegal and that complain
ant had a rignt to have it produced befo-e
the commission and to know its contents.
T c attorneys for the complainant were
still arguing tor the admissibility of the
contract as evidence when adjournment
was taken until 10 a. m. to-day.
Clear-Maker Mass Insolvent.
A. W. Mass, a cigar manufacturer, has fifed
a petition to be adjudged insolvent. He owes
$1275 25. and his assets consist of a stock of
goods valued at 700.

CLOSE FINISHES
AT INGLESIDE
The Bachelor Beat Bernar
dillo in the Distance
Event.
Arun Jel a Lucky Winner of the '
California Hurdle
Stake.
Little T G Downed a Good-Sized Field
of Two-Year-Olisâ The Cheat
Very Aptly Named.
There was the usual large attendance at
Ingleside track yesterday on the occasion
of "ladies' clay" and an excellent day's
sport was enjoyed. The races were all
hotly contested and the crowd was kept
keyed up to a high pitch of excitement
throughout the afternoon. Favorites were
successful in three of the events decideJ.
The two-mile event excited considerable
enthusiasm. The Bachelor, backed from
5 to 2 down to 9 to 5, won in a hot drive j
from Bernardillo. after the latter had made
all the running. The winner covered the j
distance in 3:33}^. The wretchedly ridden ]
Ostler Joe was a fair third.
The California stake, two miles, over i
eight hurdles, witn a guarantee value to j
the winner, went to Arnndel, piloted by j
"Stew" Peters. Baby Bill was a 3to 2 !
favorite, but would not exert himself, j
Huntsman made most ot the pace for a
mile and a half, when J O C shot to the
front, and in taking the seventh jump
turned a somersault, taking Gov. IJiud
down with him. Arundel then took
the lead again and won easily from the
favorite. There were but five starters, and
of course Huntsman took the show.
The Cheat opened an 8 to 5 choice for
the two-year-ola scramble at four iur- j
lopcb, but there appeared to be "n> tuin>
doing," sad he went back to sto U, and !
took no part of the purse. Little T Ci, the j
SpreckeM entry, a 4 to 1 chance in the !
ring, made the running and led Barney [
Schreiber past the wire by four lengths.
Salabar beat the favorite a head for the
show.
Seven very cheap platers started in the t
six-fur. one sprint that followed, with Sea !
Spray rulins a slight favorite over Doubt- I
fill. Our Climate, which acted very badly i
at the DOSt, led the bunch for a quarter, '
when Sea Spray took up the running and
at the end won handily, a length in ad
vance of Jack Martin, against wnich 20 to
1 was laid. Doubtful took the show.
Yemen was a bot even-money choice for \
the fifth event at six furlongs, but sue
cum bed to' the prowess oi the 'Texas !
Hindoo," George Miller. The favorite
WM on his worst behavior at the post, and
was last away when the barrier was raised. ;
He once headed Miller, but was again :
passed by the Texas horse opposite the !
paddock and beaten out a lcn^ head in a !
hard drive. Pat Murphy was a poor third.
Pat Dunne's colt Good Times was (
chalked up a warm 6 to 5 favorite for the
linal race at a mile, but no disappointing
have his runs been of late that he went !
back to 11 to 5- Willie Martin rated him |
along iv the bunch until tlie stretch was
reached, when he let out his wraps and
in an exciting finish led Colonel Wheeler
out a abort head iv 1:42^. Show honors j
went to Ciaudiana.
NOTES.
The Bachelor pulled up very lame after
his race.
A Nevada blacksmith named Schwartz
has invented a staning-gate that is said
to be super or in every particular to the
one now in use.
The betting about Damien was extreme
ly nervous and frettul, stiil it caused no
commotion among the layers of odds, who
gradually moved the price up from 3to 2
to 8 and 10 to 1, and then caught a few
small lry. The horse ran without blink
ers, and a life-size painting of the son of
Strath more set In a ma opany frame
would not have brogbt fifteen cents at a
hand-me-down auction sale afier the race.
He started out "absolutely" and held his
own throughout. On bis run he should
| be a strong factor in the four-mile race, as |
Martin had ample opportunity of study
ing the dangerous spots in the track.
Forgetful that the poor as well as the
rich are necessary requisites around a
racetrack, an veiling paper recommends
I ignoring the petition recently presented
j lor a two weeks' continuation of racing
: that an opportunity may be offered &onie
! of the native owners possessed of more
atmosphere than coin a chance to win a
purse. The article states that "the in
stant form and class are exhausted racine
:is reduced to a swindle." Then, if this be
I the case, form has been at low ebb and
i class at a bic discount throughout the
I winter. ! Fcr in another item in the same
; issue nppears a note which says Ed
Gaine3 will soon leave for New York a big
loser, having had no success either on the
Mock or on the ground, and the
, Eastern man was ever a student of
i forrr., devoting hours daily to studying
i the dope. Either the "dope" used by Mr.
Games was not the right sort or the sport
here is already rotten to the core. It is
said that the Jockey Club across the bay
is favorable to an extension, but that the
Eastern element, which virtually rules
< Ingleside, objects to a prolongation, fear
| lul, perhaps, that no dollars will be left to
! harvest en the return of the pilgrims from
] East and Middle West next season. A
I perusal of the list of different wealthy
owners now racing horses in different
parts of the country would display the fact
that not a few of them began the business
with a halter and one old blanket, but the
temerity and nerve to borrow a hor.Â»e If
I the occasion offered. Indeed the pedi
grees of many of them would develop a
' "cold strain" if searched, and not
;so many generations bank cither.
Every now and then is brought
,up a plea for the trotting horse folks,
that they are kicking and all that
! sort of mush and rot. The downfall of
the trotter can be attributed to the trot
; ting-horso men selves, the puDlic
j having become disgusted at their meth
; ods, and not to the popularity of the gal
! loper. Around the California circuit last
i summer, in the very heart of the trotting
| horse country, a corporal's guard would
| not gather to see them scoie up, while the
runners drew the banner crowd. If these
j Eastern folks will permit of one or two
poor owners winning a parse and not ob
ject to an extra week or so of racing the
California Humane Society might be in
duced to strike off a few medals. The
races will not have to be framed to order,
but let there be equality to ail, and our
Eastern friends no doubt will be welcomed
with true California hospitality again in
the fall.

Interior Grades to Be Sent Back
Whence They Came or Be
Destroyed.
Tea-Tasters Will Rcj ct All Not Up
to Standard and Will Enforce
tbe Law.
Collector of the Port Wise received from
the Secretary of the Treasury yesterday
an important communication with refer
ence to the new act of Congress prohibit
ing the importation of impure teas. The
Treasury Department is determined to
enforce tbe act, and the tea trade of the
United States will be revolutionized for
the belter.
The c cap and trashy grades of tea will
no longer appear in the market, and while
the effect will be*r> raise the price of this
luxury, the public health will be the
gainer thereby.
The communication from the Secretary
of the Treasury notifies the Collector that
there will be shipped to him from New
York a line of samples of the standards
established by the Board of Tea Experts.
Tha information is also given that the
Collector of Customs at New York is pack
ing half-pound samples for sale to impor
ters and brokers. Collector Wise is in
structed to pack samples in convenient
half-pound packages representing the i'uil
line of the standards, which may be sold
to importers and brokers at cost; namely,
2J cents per pound.
After May 1 of tins year it shall be un
i lawful to import into the United States
any tea below th â¢ standard estaDiiSlied by
the Treasury Department.
The act " of Congress was approved
March 2,' 1897. It authorized the Secre
tary of the Treasury to appoint a board of
seven exptris in tea to submit to him
standard samples of pure teas. On their
report he has establishes the standards on
their recommendation, and is now depos
iting in the Custom-houses of New York
City, Chicago, San Francisco and such
other ports duplicate samples of such
standards, and a sufficient quantity of
other duplicate samples to supply at cost
the importers and dealers in tea at all
ports desiring the same.
The act provides further that importers
or consignees shall furnish samples of all
lines of tea imported by them, together
with a sworn statement that the samples
are genuiue, or such samples shall be ob
tained by ttie examining board.
Should the tea be found interior to the
established standard the importer or con
signee must sive a bond with sureties that
he t- h ail export the tea outside the limits
of the United Slates within six months.
In cm of failure to export the condemned
tea within six month-, the Collector shall
cause the tea to be destroyed.
An appeal from the decision of the tea
experts may be taken before a board of
three United States General Appraisars
to be designated by the Secretary of the
Treasury.
Teas on board shins for shipment to the
United States at the time of the passage of
this act shall not be subject toils pro

NEW YOKK MAKKKTS.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 28. -Further with
drawals of gold aggregating $1,500,000 were made
from the sub-Treasury to-day to be shipped abroad
to-morrow. Indications favor additional ship
ments on Saturday. The total for the week may '
aggregate $4,500,000. With the collapse of the j
banker.' agreement nothing stands in the way of !
a steady outflow of gold, which will probably con- â 
tinue until the Austrian demand Is satisfied. It is i
certain, however, that the country ana the Treas- !
ury are both in a better position to stand the out- :
flow of the metal at this time than they have been |
for five years. Granger- stocks were the active j
features 01 the market, and also the strongest, and '
optimistic rumors in regard to the March state- i
' ment of Burlington were again circulated. The
continued firmness in European Government se- I
curities was reflected by a steady decline and un
easiness In regard to the outcome of the situation
in Greece. The general stock market was without
any apparent definite Influ nee. The money mar
ket win unanecu-d by the gold movement. The
market closed iractionally lower.

They were talking of the cold weather
and one of them made the remark that he
dreaded the winter.
"Bo do 1," said a nervous-looking man
in the corner; "I ieel like crawling into a
loft and pulling the ladder in alter me
every time I inint of it."
"Are you sensitive to the cold?" in
quired a sympathetic listener.
"Oh, it isn't the cold I dread partic
ularly."
"Perhaps you suffer from chilblains?"
"Never had them in my life."
"Then it is just the exigencies of the
climaÂ»e you dread?"
"Exigencies nothing. I dn-ad the winter
because all clay and every day after the
cold weather sets in you are likely to meet
at the most unexpected moment â "
"A blizzard â yes; that's t-o," interrupted
one of the crow I.
"2So; a blizzard would be a merciful in
fliction compared to him. I mean the
man who meets you with an idiotic smile
on his face and who holds you by one
button while he asks. 'Is it cold enough
for you?' "âDetroit Free Pres3.

Sensational Accident to a
Large Freight
Train.
Electric Cross on Twenty-
Third Avenue Torn
' Up.
No Lives Lost and No Apparent Rea
son for the Wreck Cm B
Found
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
'JuS Broadway, April 23. \
A train- wreck occurred this afternoon at
Twenty-third avenue, and as no reason
can be advanced for it the trainmen are
beginning to look upon the engineer,
Georee Carroll, as a hoodoo.
Although one of the most careful en
gineers on the road, this is the fourth time
he has been unlucky, th â â¢ last occasion be
ing when he was running the Sunset Lim
ited and telescoped the rear of the Berke
ley local last September.
At 4:30 this afternoon the way freight
train, known as No. 78, was passing
Twenty avenue. The engine and
about half of the train had passed over
when one of t:;e boxcars' caught some
thing or was caught by something. It
was crushed into a mass of iron and
splinters afier it was derailed and two
other cars were also derailed and wrecked
before the couplings broke and the train
Was s;opped.
The train was going at a rood rat- 1 of
Â£te?d and. the accident occurred just to
lite westward of the Alameda electric
load crossing. There was apparently no
cause for the sma*hup. The train was
pass'ng alone all right, the flagman wa<
a! his post and had just signaled an ap
proaching electric car that was nearing
the curve about a Mock from the crossing
and the brakemen were at their stations
on top of the cars, when everybody was
surprised to hear a louu crash and to see
the middle of the train leave the track and
a minute later three cars were derailed
and wrecked.
The cars that were derailed were all
load d with hay, and as to ere happened
to be no brakeman on any of them no one
was hurt and no valuable freight was
wrecked.
It was a very ordinary accident, but the
interest lies in the fact that the officials
cannot agree as to how it occurred, and
cfter the smash-up it was impossible to
tell from the jumbled mass which theory
was correct or i: both were wrong.
Division Superintendent Wilder was
soon at the wreck and hit investigations
led him to believe that the crossing of
the electric road was not in good order
an i that in consequence one car was de
railed and the others followed. The fore
man of the electric road says that the
crossing wasa 1 right and that the accident
vÂ»as caused by a brakebeam falling from
the first wrecked car and catching the
rail at the crossing.
After the accident the crossing was so
badly torn up and the car so completely
wrecked that there wao absolutely noth
ing to establish or refute either ex
planation.
The cars were badly smashed and the
rails torn up for some distance, and the
wreckers were busy till after midnight re
storing affairs ana putting the cars on the
tracK.
The local travel was disturbed for a
couple of hours, and the report spread
that a serious accident had occurred; but
this was no; the case. So many thousands
of people on both -ides of the bay u-e the
lecal trains betwe n the hour^ol 4 and 6
in the evening that news of an accident
coon spreads over the four bay cities. A
little after 6 o'clock the local traffic was
in running order and the electric cars,
which run on a loop, simply transierred'
across thÂ« wreck and returned, so that
their traffic was not urbed.
George Carrol!, the engineer in charge of
the train, cannot offer any reason for the
accident, as the engine and halt the cars
ijad crossed before it occurred.
TO DESTROY THE THRIPP
Professor C W. Woodworth
Prescnb?s a Rem dy for the
Fresno Wine Pest.
He Sa7s Unless The? Are Exter
minated Socn Great D mige
W II Be Done.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 28.â Professor
C. W. Woodworth of the department of
entomology at the State University, who
was summonea to Fresno last week for
the purpose of investigating the thripp
pest, has returned. He has determined
on a remedy !or the extermination of the
pest, which be described to a Call cor
respondent to-day.
Professor Woodworth says the grape
vine hoj per which is causing so much
damage in the neighborhood of .Fresno is
a very small insect, not over a tenth of
an inch long. It has been present all
winter, flying about and feeding on all
kinds of piants. T.e reason of their pres
ent great numbers is the very favorable
winter that has just passed.
"These insec.s are now beginning to
lay their eggs in the leaves, and by mid
Bummer a new brood will be fiyine. Un
less something happens to check :hem we
will have them in immense numbers dur
ing the latter half of the season.
"Next to the phylloxera this is the
rnos; injurious insect attacking t c grape.
"The injury done by the present brood
is not so great a< many suppose, and will
only cause the dropping or ihe first crop
on the uont infested spots. They have al
ready done their worst injury, and it will
hardly pay to try to treat them now. but
when the midsummer broods be^in to
fly it will be very desirable to do some
thing.
"Tne most practical plan of treatment
seems to be the use ol nn inject net This
is made of a conical bag of cheesecloth,
fastened to a wire hoop about one and a
half feet in diameter, attached to a short
handle. One can go quite thoroughly
over five or six acres in a day, so the cost
will be some 15 or 20 cents per acre.
"A eang <>f men can thus do a vineyard
in a very short time. It will be profit
able to go over the vineyard in this way
whenever the hoppers get abundant.
"This insect is quite different from the
vine-hopper, which is sumeiimes injuri
ous about San Jose and in South m Cali
fornia, and nothing lite the .ra^shonpers
which sometimes devour the leaves in ihe
vineyards in this State."
Proiessor Woodworth is about to issue

wiiole subject, which will be ilistrinuted

A C ANDI DATE SWINDLED.
K. B. Tappan Paid for Distributing
Circular! That Were Mever
Sent Out.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 28.â The vari
oaa candidates have been turning in their
expense accounts as required by law.
Some of them have been facetious in their
remarks, but R. B. Tappan, late nominee
for City Attorney, U very plainspoken. It
appears he was maJe the victim of a
swindle, which he relates thus:
Paid $2 50 to one JoneÂ« to manage the dis
tribution of 1500 circulars by nix boys. Jones,
instead of watching the Doys, watched the
saloons and got drunk. Jones was supposed
to have paid six boys; Instead, be employed
and paid but four boys. In the evening he ap
peared weil ioa led, with a little boy whom he
instructed no doubt in his first crime. The
boy was instructed and d;d ask vry for six
boy* and received it. The circulars were not
distributed, and I therefore do not consider
tbii expense in my total of expenses.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 1597.
PREPARING FOR
TWO CELEBRATIONS
Active Men Placed at the
Head of the Various
Committees.
i Endeavor Day Has Already
Proved a Great Boon
to Oakland.
i
The 4 h of Jalv Will Ec Devoted
Mainly to Pageantry; the 13th
to Entertaining. >
Oakland Office San Fkancipco Call,)
908 Broadway, Apnl 28. j
If the two celebraMons to be held in July
are not pronounced iuccesses, it will not
be the fault of the men who have the affair
in charge. The chairman of each of the
committees is a man known for his activity
and executive ability, and in a great
measure the executive committee is com
posed of the same men who have made
such a signal success of the Oakland Ex
position the past two years.
, It has just about been decided that the
Fourth of July celebration shall be almost
entirely a military display, and that of
the 13th, which is to be "Oakland Day"
for the vast Christian Endeavor gathering
across tue bay, will be devoted to their
entertainment. The committee consists
now of seventeen, each of whom is respon
sible for a specihe section of the demon
strations.
Theodore Gier is at the head of the
finance committee; E. C. Gilbert, the ex
cursion committee; tl. E. Bunca is in
cha^e of the decoration-, Major J. F.
Ha.%3 will look alter the miliiary depart
ment, Lieutenant J. ri. Vaughn "is chair
man of the committee on speeches, John
T. Bell is responsible lor the press ar
rangements, E. C. Buswell hns the t.otel
committee. ex-Councilman Barnard is re
sponsible for the prov:sicn of carriages;
F. A. Webster, the well-known photog
rapher, whose admitted tact in grouping
| and arranging has extended far beyond
I this county, is chairman of the committee
i on water carnival and illumination; H. 0.
| Trowbridae is responsible for the enter
; tainrnents and Georpe W. Arper is chair
| man of the parade committee. P. M.
Fisher has also been assigned important
duties and A. R. Waters is at the head of
the rrception committee.
Many plans for entertaining the En
, deavorors and for celebrating ihe Fourth
are be ng discussed, but no definite plans
have yet been made. In former years no
difficulty has been exnerienced in raising
j sufficient funds for a Fourth of July cele
bration, but on these occasions, when the
benefit will be much greater than usual
the financial committee does not antici
pate an impossible task.
llThe value of having an "Oakland day"
for the Christian Endeavorera is becoming
more manifest every day. Many Eastern
papers, religious and secular, interested
in the Endeavor movement have written
to prominent clergymen in this city, ask
ing for lengthy descriptive articles of
Oakland, so that the delegates may know
what kind of a city :hey are invited to.
The latest of these so far is a very com
plete article in the Chicaeo Lutheran
Evangelist, written by Rev. Dr. Bushneli
Others have already appeared and several
are now in course of preperation. This
form of advertising Alameda County it
is hoped, will have a simulating effect'on
those interested in h*r we, fare and induce
them to come forward liberally and ener
getically to make, the 4th and 13th of July
days to be long remembered.

would feed it to chickens they would Jay
golden esrgs. Wester is a man of more
than ordinary intelligence and he told the
court that he was cursed by being giv d
too affectionate a nature. Many years ago
in France Wester lived with a wife and
two little children. He considered him
â elf a happy and prosperous man, and
nothing tr abed him until one day an al- i
iened priest induced li is wife to elope with
him and they took with them the two
children. Since that time Wester has
roamed the earth looking for his family
whicti he has never fonnd.
Wester'o mind was not affected until
about a year ago, when, having riven up
all hope of living again wit,, his wtte and
children, his mind became unba anced.
In this connection a very pathetic incident
was brought to light. The poor leilow
arrived at v knowledge of the truth that
so many years havine elapsed since his
life's happiness was broken into his chil
dren, even if found, would not be the
same >weet little creatures that he used
to play with, but would be crown up and
probably would not even care to meet
him. This thought was more than he
could stand.
Mrs. Marcaret Knhn of Berkeley has
been so troubled w i h him of late that she
swore to ttie complaint ehftfarlnp him with
insanity, and he wa committed to Napa.
NOT IN THE MILK.
N.i Poison in the I ondemed Milk Sup
posed to Have Â« anind a
Child's Death
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 28.â As stated
would be the case, the health authorities
moved promptly in the matter of the sup
posed poisoning of a child by condensed
milk. The can containing the material
was rescued from the ash-birrel where it
had been thrown and the contents were
turned over for c finical analysis. A por
tion was also prepared and ted to a rabbit,
and up to tne present time the animal has
not showed the least sign of. discomfort
or illness.
Dr. Stephens, the bacteriologist of the
Board of Health, made chemical tests and
could discover absolutely nothing of a
deleterious character in the milk. The
chances are, therefore, that the utensils
used in preparing the food for the infant
hail not baen properly cleanseo, and that
the disease perms were conveyed from
them to th? child. The physicians give it
as their opinion that it could not have
been the miik itself as originally in the
can that caused the trouble.
A COLLECTOR'S TRIALS.
Offer of a Big C mmission That
Temp ed Him to Bs
Amb tious.
Arthur BroJerick W s Confined Three
lays an! May Bring a Civil
Suit for D mages
Oakland Office San Francipco Call )
908 Broadway. April 28. \
Arthur Broderick, a well-known young
fellow about town, is not particularly
enamored of the duties of an amateur bill
collector. As a result of his first and last
attempt be spent three days in the City
Prison, and when be got home he met
with a chilly reception, all of which he
did not deserve.
H. Furst, a Broadway tailor, is a friend
of young Broderick. Some time ago
Furst made an elegant suit of clothes for
Dr. Capbault, and the doc or has not yet
got a receipt. In conyeraation recently
Furst ws" discussing his business with
Brolerick, and incidentally, mentioned
Capbauli's indebtedness. Broderick p.t
once announced that it would be the
easiest thing in the world to collect that
bill, and Furst agreed to give him exactly
half of whatever tie collected.
Armed with authority from Furst Brod
erick went to Dr. Capbauli's house; ho
presented the bill, and did a little talking
Id pianissimo tones, but all in vain. He
talked a little louderâ moderato, as it
were â but this had no effect. Nothing
seamed to move the doctor until a double
forte m odulation was reached, when Cap
bault said: "Just w.iit a little while and I
will settle with you."
The doctor went out and sent bis little
boy for a police officer. When the blue
couted gentleman appearea Dr. Capbault
greatly surprised the amateur collector
by touching him on the shoulder and
handing him over 10 the officer on a
charee of disturbing the peace.
This all happened last Saturday night,
and I'.roiiericK remained in jail without
any charge being against him till Tues
day, when, us no complaint had been
sworn to, be was released. The period
between Saturday and Tuesday is an un
fortunate length for people who stay
at the City Hail. It is just thrae days,
which i* the length ot ilme the police
Judges detain those who imbibe too freely,
and when young Brodericfc appeared on
the street amung hi- friends he was made
the victim of a good deal of curiosity and
suspicion. iHeevenhada little trouble to
persuade those of ha own hornet at he
had b en locked up illegally. He now
declares that he may bring a civil suit
aguinst Dr. Caj bault for false imprison
ment, but he aiso says that if he should
be awarded <lamax<"B he will not try to col
lect them nlmself.
Mr. Furst said this afternoon that he
felt sorry for Brodericfc's cxi erience, but
stated tbat it was the young man's own
suggestion that he go ana try and collect
from the doctor.

HAYWARDS WILD
MAN IS CAUGHT
Declares That He Is More
Wicked Than Sheriff
White.
Interesting Effct of a Mania
That Kesuted Frm
Re igion.
Edward Koop h Perfectly Sane, Ex
c pt When H R ds a C mmaod
From Above.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 2& f
Edward L. Koop sat for bal a:i hour to
day in Jud/e Hall's court, and ol that
time he discoursed ntionally for about
twenty-eight minutes. The remaininc
two minu es ne gave evidence that he was
ac ually crazy and not safe to be at larÂ«e.
According to hi- story this same propor
tion of sanity and insanity has prevailed
roughout his life for the past five years.
Koop has just suffered from one of his
wild .spells,. He is ilie mau who passed
Monday night, which w.is bitterly cold,
i:i a canyon near Haywards, robed in
nothing but a sheet, because the Lurd had
told him to do so. His case is a very in
teresting one. He appears to be an intel
ligent man, uses good language and has a
splendid memory. Five years ago whle
a' Newbure, Obio, he met with some re
ligious people and been me impressed with
their octrine. He was soon led to be
lipye ihat he was the wickedest man on
ear:h â more wicked, as be said, than
Judge Hall or Sheriff White. This sense
t'f sin comes back to him at intervals of
about a year, and while it lusts he cannot
tell what may happen. He does no: feel
inclined to kill, is not destructive nor
violent in any manner, wishes no one any
harm, but is continually looking on tank
houses an i trees for commands from
heaven which he says he would obey in
stantly.
Mouilay night ne was reading his Bible,
the marks in which clearly show the trend
of his mania, when an unbidden master
told him to go. He did not know where
to go, but just at tbat instant a sun spot
centered on the verse in the New Testa
ment which reads, "Go ye into all the
world." Koop at once dive-ted himself of
his clothes, was given a sheet at the Hay
wards Hotel, and ran into the mountains.
Early yesterday mornine a dairyman
when returning home saw the uncanny
figure In the middle of the road hailing to
him to stop, but instead of obeying he
whipped up his horses, and, according to
the stury of Constable Kamage, drove
posthaste to his ranch.
Koop told Judge Hall that he is well
nware that he is insane, and grieves over
the fact, but he beliÂ«"ve9 that in a short
time he will be able to get rid o! bis sins
and then be troubled m> more. His story
ana experience bear much resemblance to
tome of the old tales of witchcraft of ihree
centuries ago. He will be confined in
Napa, where he has been before, and at
the end of a few weeks his sanity will re
turn and he will be released.
THE PAEDEE WILL.
Agreement Filed and the Document
Will Be rrnbated.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 28.â Attorney
Moore commenced proceedings this morn
ing for probatirig the will of the late Dr.
E. H. Pardee. G. B. Daniels declared that
tie was present when the will was signed
and tuat Dr. Pardee was perfectly sane at
that time. Prior to the petition for pro
bate an acreernent was presented from
Mrs. Emily C. Pardee dismissing the con
test to the will and the case was dropped
from the docket.
Dr. George C. Pardee testified that his
father left an estate worth $280,000. Of
this amount realty valued at $230,000 is in
ibis county. Eight thousand dollars is in
liank. Property in San francisco it worth
$50,000 and household furniture $10,000.
INSULTED HIS WIPE.
A Man Guilty of Battery Who Will Not
Be Punished.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â Judge
Clift, by a judgment this morning, ac
knowledges the right of a man to protect
his wife from the attention of other mnn
anil also uphold the law. Alfred Wil
liams frequently stopped Mrs. Grinter on
the street and annoyed her by walking by
her side. Mrs. printer told him his atten
tion was offensive, but he did not desist,
and finally Mr. Grinter gave him a
thrashing. Grinter was arres ?d and the
evidence was plain that he had thrashed
Williams, so Judge Cliit found the de
fendant guilty and suspended judgment
indefinitely.

SAYS THE
CENSUS
IS VOID
Superintendent of Schools
Webster Springs a
â \ Sensation.
TOO MANY MARSHALS
APPOINTED.
Mr. Webster Consults the City
and County Attorney's
Office.
HINTS COMING OF AN INVES
TIGATION.
A Director Threatens to Resign.
Reports of Various Committees.
Changes and Transfers
â  A sensation of a startling nature came
to a bead at the meeting of the committee
of the whole previous to the regular gath
ering of the Board of Education last even
inn.
Superintendent of Schools R. H. Web
ster made an earnest and indignant pro
test against the manner in which the
school census is being conducted, and de
clared that he believed it to be illegal
and that the work already performed
would have to be done all over again.
Coming on top of the ezploded scandal
of a few weeks ago, wheu charges were
made that the census rolls had been
stuffed and $30,000 illegally collected from
the State it startled the members, and one
School Director declared that if any more
scandals developed he would resign his
office.
Explaining his bombshell, Mr. Webster
staled that under the law thirty-six census
marshals wpre allowed, andjhe had sworn
in that many, believing the number men
tioned was all that would be appointed.
He had learned, however, he said, that
hir;y-six additional men had bien ap
pomte i, and that they were engaged in
collecting names of school children.
"I have consulted the City and County
Attorney's oHice," continued Mr. Web-ter,
"and I have been informed that such an
act is illegal, and that it may invalidate
the work already penormed.
â¦'The board should investigate this mat
ter thoroughly before it goes any f under.
Ii will cost the City a great deal of money
if my information be correct, and the mat
ter -bould be stopped oeiore it entails any
more expense."
After the meeting one Director stated
that he had heard of undue influence be
ing brought to bear to get men positions
as census marshals, and that if he could
verify his information he would demand
an investigation.
He stateu in justice to those who are
conducting the census that what he had
heard was merely rumor so far, and he
would not make known the name of his
informant until he bail probed deeper into
the matter.
The board decided to investigate the
legal phase of the matter to-day and de
cide on a plan of action.
At the board meeting the Committee on
Classification made the following recom
mendations, which were adopted : Miss
N. E. Jacobs assigned to "Washington
Grammar School; Miss Margaret Fitzger
ald transferred from Hancock Grammar
School to the Fairmount Primary School ;
Miss Essie G. Phillips assigned as a pro
bationary teacher in the Hancock School;
Miss Esteile lloughton assigned :is a pro
bationary teacher to the Washington
Grammar School; the action taken on
April 14 causing W. D. KinÂ«sbury of the
Swett Grammar to exchange places with
L. M. Shuck of the Adams Cosmopolitan
cchool was suspenod; Miss Annie Wolf
transferred from Jefferson School to the
Le Conte Primary School; Miss Ernilv
Hartrick assigned as a probaiionarv
teacher in the Jefferson Primary School;
Miss F. McD. Shearer transferred trom the
Washington Grammar School to the un
assicned list of teacher*. Mis 3 Sliearer is
the teacher who became demented a few
days a 1,0.
The following recommendations of the
City Board of Examiners were adopted:
That Miss Lillian M. McKibben and N.
Kennedy be granied grammar grade certi
ficates; that Frank A. Reynolds be I
granted a special certificate in Latin and |
Greek; that L. A. Jordan be recom- j
mended to the State board for a life I
diploma of the high school grade.
MrÂ«. Katerrua Turney, wuo has served |
the usual term of probation, was elected
a regujar teacher on the recommendation
of the Committee on Qualifications.
Drs. J. G. Smith and Charles F. Mc-
Carthy reported that they had examined
the eyes of 1288 children in the schools,
with the following result: 742 normal
sighted, 91 near sightftl, 'I'll far sighted,
228 astigmatic, 14 cross-eyed. 2 wall-eyed,'
!1 color blind. Among the 546 pupils with
do;ective vision but forty-one are provided \
with proper correcting t,'!:i>ses.
The experts also reported that the
rooms in the basement of the Spring Val- j
ley Grammar School are so poorly lighted
as to tie positively ruinous to the eves of
the children occupying them. The Build
ings and Groun is Committee was in
structed to ascertain if some improvement
can be made in the roomi.
Tlie Committee on Evening Schools
recommended as follows:
That Miss Eliza L. West be transferred

Fort Point and Point Bonita are now
connected by telephone. A branch line
from Lime Point to Bonita has been Dut
up and when the target practice begins on
May 3 next the result of each shot will be
telephoned to the fort instead of being
signaled by flags as heretofore. The quar

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 1897.
DEATH IN
THE LEES OF
DEBAUCH
"No One to Blame," the
Strange Message of
Two Suicides.
DIED IN A BOOM ON THE
WEBER.
Dr. McCall and Carpenter Boley
Both Well Known in
Stockton.
MORPHINE FOUND IN BOLEY'S
STOMACH.
Both Suppose! to Have Been Despond.
ent From Hard Drinkingâ McCiil's
F.unily Connections.
A strange case, supposedly of double
suicide, was discovered on board the
Stockton steamer Captain Weber early
yesterday morning, as she was moored at
the Clay-street wharf. And the sequel is
that the body of Dr. James C. McCall of
the Slough City and v man believed to be
a carpenter named Frank Boley of the
same place lie cold and stark at the
Morcue.
At what precise time the two men met
their death it is hard to say. At 6:30 a. m.
the men were discovered in siateioom
1, secured by the physician, by Porter
George Miller, who had been ordered by
Captain 11. Potuin to awaken the pas
sengers and inform them that San Fran
cisco hail been reached.
Wiien Miller informed the captain that
j no answer was made to his repeated calls
and knocks and that on unlocking and
opening the door, which had been locked
from the inside, the expression on the
faces of the two men did not appear nat
ural, he dressed himself at once and went
down to see wliat was the trouble.
Dr. McCall was found on the oed, fully
dressed, and the man supposed to be
j Boley, the carpenter, was lying on the
floor with a piilow under his head. The
I latter's coat, vest and shoes had been
i carelessly tos-sed into a corner of the
j apartment and on the floor beside him lay
an empty pint flask, which still contained
about a teaspoonful of whisky.
Purser Gillis was immediately sum
moned as soon as the two men were found
dead, and identified the man in the berth
as Dr. James C. MoCali, at one time a
prominent physician of Stockton, who
had been dragged to bis lowly position by
the demon rum, and stili further, by tnor-
Dinne, a habit acquired later on. Ho re
membered to have seen the two men con
versine st Stockton before the steamer
left. Both had been drinking heavily, a*
was evidenced in their red ana swollen
countenances.
At midnight the steamer stopped at An
tioch. There McCall saluted Purser Gillis
and inquired where he could purchase a
drink. 'i be latter told the doctor he
would have time to go ashore and get one,
and lie at once left the steamer.
It is entirely probable that while off the
steamer he purchased the whisky.
Whether he also purchased morphine
at Antioch or had it already with him
cannot be known. But he is said to have
used the dangerous drug to excess.
The carpenter, Boley, must have drunk
last, for the flask was found 'by his side.
He had not engaged a berth, but had a
ticket which called only lor a general pas
sage.
The Morgue authorities were notified,
and at 7:30 o'clock the two men were re
moved there. During the morning the
autopsy physician to the Coroner, Dr.
Gallauber, removed Boley's stomach and
gave it to Dr. Morgan for chemical analy
sis. Indications of morphine were in that
organ, but the whisky remaining in the
flask will require several -days to be prop
erly, analyzed.
The pockets of Boley contained a 25
--cent piece, a pair of spectacles and a small
brass ball. The only other article discov
ered on him was a Chinese laundry ticket,
on the back of which was written: "There
is no one to blame."
In Dr. McCall's pockets nothing at all
was discovered but a small nocket-kniie.
Sergeant Mahoney and Officer James
Mackie, who were detailed on the case by
Captain Dunlevy of the Harbor police, as
a result of their investigations reported
that it was a case of double suicide.
The man believed on good authority to
be Boley was about 45 years old and 5 feet
Bor 9 inches in height. He had blue eyes,
brown hair and a light brown mustache.
He wore a gray fedora hat, a dark suit,
somewhat faded; white shirt, with turn
down collar, and a brown-figured four-in
hand cravat. His gaiters were tan.
Dr. McCall emigrated to Stockton from
the East about five years ago, accom
panied by his wife and child. He- was in
duced to do so by bis deceased brother,
who was Mayor McCall of Stockton
and well connected.
McCall did well for some time, as he
was a good physician, but when he began
to drink bis business was neglected and
rapidly went to the dog?. After he added
the habit of using morphine to his other
practices his wife obtained a divorce.
It seem? that the two men were imbued
with a drunken iaea to kill themselves in
a manner that would attract attention.
If analysis of the whisky shows no mor
phine this theory can be taken as almost
certain. If it does, it may never be known
whether Boley knew that the physician
had placed it there or not. But the writ
ing on the laundry ticket would indicate
that he chose death himself. His wife is
said to be divorced and now living in San
Francisco with her three children.
An examination ot Dr. McCali's
stomach, made late in the afternoon.
showed the presence of morphine in large
quantities.
BELIEVED TO BE BOLEY.
Dr. McCall's Companion Thought
to Have Been a Stockton
Carpenter.
STOCKTON, Cal.. April 23.-The de
scription of the unknown man which was
telegraphed from San Francisco to the
Mail answers to that of Frank Boley, a
carpenter, who had been working for
Joseph Hoerl at the latter'a planing-miii
in the western part of town. Recently
Boley was laid off temporarily, but he
was to have gone to work again to-day.
Yesterday he entered the mill and acted
in a peculiar manner. Without making
any explanation of what he intended todo
he snatched up his toolchest and walked
out. This forenoon Mr. Hoerl was hunt
ing for him to go to work, when he hcara
of the double suicide aboard the steamer
Weber.
Boley's father is a cook, who works for
William Harelson, a farmer of Roberts
Island, and a few days ago he sent word
to hi* father by George Mowry, a neighbor
of the elder Boley, saying that he wanted
to see him. The father arranged to be
here last Monday. The younger Boley
iold Mowry that he intended to go to San
Francisco in a a few days. Still another
circumstance which corroborates the sus
picion that it was be who was found dead
with McCall is the fact that he had been
drinking with him about town for several
days, and was seen with him in the neigh
borhood of Masonic Temple, opposite the
Union Company's boat landing, and also
in water-front saloons, less than an hour
before the steamer started for San Fran
cisco.
They must have boarded the boat and
purchased their tickets at the purser's
<ffic<>, for no ticket was sold to Dr. McCall
at the office on the wharf
About three years ago Boley was di
vorced from nis wife in this city. She
and their three children reside in San
Francisco, and it is supposed that one of
nis objects in going there was to see them.
He could not have started in search of
work, for Hoerl. his employer, had told
him that there would be work for him at
the Dlaning-tnilU

HELLMAN'S QUEER PLIGHT
He Thought Ho Was Divorced
and Married Another
Woman.
Fraud Was Us d &nd tho Grand Jury
Will Investigate Who Is
to Blame.
Charles Hellm.in came from St. Louis a
few iiay- ago and surrendered himself to
the police, as he wanted to secure a vindi
cation, which he got from Judge Low
yesterday afternoon.
Helimiin unfortunately is in an awkward
predicament, through no fault of his own.
He was divorced in January, 1595, married
another cirl a few months later, ana now
it seems he was not legally divorced and
his present wiie and her child have legally
no claim upon him.
Heilman and his first wife mutually
agreed to a divorce, and in November,
1894, they went to George \V. Howe, who
advertises that divorces are a specialty
with him. In due time Heilman secured
the divorce from Judge Troutt, and was
surprised to lenrn a few weeks ago that he
was wanted here on two charges of perjury,
for having sworn before a notary public,
when signing the divorce complaint, that
he and Ins wife had been living apart tor
one year, und f>r having sworn to the
same effect before F. W. Lawler. a com
missioner appointed by the Supreme
Court to take evidence in the case.
The complaining witness in the case
was John Pearson, Precita avenu-, who
lived next door to Heilman and his w:fe
before the divorce proceedings were com
menced.
The cases came up before Judge Low j
yesterday afternoon and Attorneys George
Ji. Reid and Lemon appeared in behalf of
Hell man.
Pearson and his wife were in court and
testified to the fact that Hellman und his
wife were living together liil within three
or four weeks of the divorce proceedings.
In his evidence Hellman related how he
went to Howe by seeing his advertisement
in the papers. They talked tne matter
over and Hellraan said Howe wanted nim
to get two or three friends who would tes
tify that he and his wife had been living
apart for a year, but Hellman told him he
knew no one who would do that, and, be
side?, it was not true.
He called upon Howe eeveral times and
finally, he said, Howe got him to sign a
paper. He denied ever going before Com
missioner Lawler and never saw that gen
tleman, who was la court, in his life. At
torney Lawler gave his evidence and
faiicd to identify Hellman as the husband
who gave evidence before him.
Hellman finally got his decree of di
vorce from Howe and thinking it was all
right he waited for a few months and got
married again.
A witness in the divorce case was Jo
Drake, who swore that Hellman and his
wife had been living apart for a year, but
Hellman swore he did not know such a
man and never heard of him before.
Attorney Rsid said that if what Hell
man testified to wore true the divorce was
null anil void, a3 it had been obtained by
fraud on some one's part, and Hellman's
second marriage was illegal.
Howe took tbe stand and made a gen
eral denial of the statements made by
Heilman. He said Hellman had sworn
before the notary public and before the
Commissioner that he had not been liv
ing with his wife for a year prior to the
commencement of the sui:, and when he
iouud he had sworn lalsely he wanted
him to suffer for perjuring himself.
Judee Low said he believed every word
that Hellman said and he would dismiss
the charges against him. "It Is infa
mous," continned the Judge, "that such
practices should be permitted, and some
drastic method should be adopted to stop
them. Hellmnn should swear out a com
plaint against Howe for obtaining money
by false pretenses."
"I am prepared to surrender myself if
he does," said Howe. "I have my certifi
cate as an attorney and can produce it at
any time."
li Can you practice in the Superior
Courts?'' asked Attorney Reid.
Howe declined to answer the question,
but reiterated that he had a certificate.
Attorney Reid said he would lay the
whoie matter before the Grand Jury for
action.
IN JAIL TOE A MISTAKE.
C. B. Ryer Arrested on the Complaint
of a Pawnbroker.
The absent-mindedness of Attorney J.
C. Campbell of the firm of Reddy, Camp
bell & Metson was the cause of Chris B.
Ryer spending several unpleasant hours
in the Southern police station last even
ing on a charge of obtaining goods by
Jalse pretenses, preferred against him by
William Schmaiz, a Fourth-street pawn
broker.
Up to Tuesday afternoon Mr. Campbell
was Ryer's debtor to the extent of $500,
and he drew a check on the California
Bank for the ouni of bia indebtedness, and
gave it lo Ryer in payment of his obliga
tion.
The bank was closed, and as Ryer
wished to redeem a diamond ring, a dia
mond stud and a gold watch and chain
he had pledged to Schrnalz, he asked him
to honor t:ie check received from Camp
bell. The pawnbroker accepted the check
and advanced the difference between the
amount ot the pledge and the check's
value.
Yesterday afternoon Schmaiz presented
the check at the California Bank, but the
cashier refused to pay it, saying that Mr.
Campbell had no personal account with
the bank, all his money being deposited
in the firm name of Reddy, Campbell &
Metson.
The pawnbroker returned to his office
and sent word to Ryer to call on him.
Ryer calle<i, and alter being informed of
ttie stnte of affairs he was turned over to
an officer, who took him to the Southern
police station.
Ryer was durufounded, and immedi
ately informed Mr. Campbell of his ar
rest, who dispatched one of his clerks io
explain to the police the mistake he had
made in putting his own signature on the
check in place of the tirm name, and to
raise bonds to secure Ryer's release. This
was done, and to-day the matter will be
adjusted.
