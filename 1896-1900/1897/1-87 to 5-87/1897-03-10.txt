This is a chapter in the history of a newspaper and its high priest in
hypocrisy. To-day THE CALL drags away the mask behind which the
F^j>r.iner and its proprietor have long played a game of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde. To-day the bars are let down and all who read may learn
that the journal that has been so long masquerading as tifefnenJ of hon
est labor and honest business has of itseif been a heavy and secret pur
Â« Vwndde goods. In this recital of double-dealing and
shuffling the facts have been gathered from official sources and official
v records. No attempt at garniture has been made. Suffice that the public
may know the truth.
The tale goes back to October, 1895, when there was begun at the
request of the business manager of W. R. Hearst's San Francisco Ex
amitur the manufacture of twine in the jutemill at the San Quentin
prison, and it may be interesting to the people of the City and State
generally to know that since that time this precocious example of the
"new journalism" has been the principal customer of this product of con
vict labor on the Pacific Coast : th3t the twine used in its wrapping and
mailing departments for the past eighteen months has been made behind
the brick walls of a California prison.
Possibly it might be surmised that Mr. Hearst was forced out of the
market because he was after a particular kind of goods. In other
uords, that he had to resort to the prison mills for the reason he was un
able to purchase the article desired elsewhere. Nothing could be further
from the facts.
The Examiner has a monopoly on one particular brand of twine made
in the San Quentin jutemills, but a similar twine, made by free labor, is
on sale by every dealer in this product in San Francisco. Mr. Hearst
enjoys this unique distinction not because there is no demand for these
goods in the common channels of trade, but simply for the prejudice that
exists among business men and manufacturers against purchasing or sell
ing an article made by prison labor. On the order-books of San Quentin
prison the Examiner article is known as an eight-ply jute wrapping-twine,
so called because there are eight strands of jute yarn used in making it.
In other words, this twine is the regulation baling article so much in use
among merchants, and particularly among dealers in paper of all kinds.
It is sold wholesale in the open market in this City at 8 cents a pound.
The Examitur pays 5 1-2 cents a pound for its prison-made article.
Here are the records of the Examitur purchases according to the

From these figures it will be seen that the total amount of convict
made twine used by the Examiner since Business Manager Williams made
his deal with the prison authorities is 6730 pounds, for which Mr. Hearst
has contributed to the San Quentin prison fund the sum of $369 38.
Had he bought free-labor goods his twine- outlay would have been
$538 10â a very small saving surely for a man reputed to be as rich
and affluent as the proprietor of the Examiner.
The jutemillsat San QuentirTare not in the manufacture of twine
as a general thing. The 700 unfortunate men in stripes who labor day
in and day out in the midst of a wilderness of whirling machinery expend
their energies in the manufacture of jute bags for the California farmer.
The agricultural interests of the State have found that the production of
these bags by the prison people has resulted in keeping the price at a
minimum. Now, twine is used in these bags, and it is made right in the
prison, in the ordinary course of business. There are two big "twisters"
and a force of men steadily spinning out the jute cord with which the
sacks are sewn together. Little twine is sold. There are but two
kinds of twine made at San Quentin and there are but two cus
tomers on the prison books. One is a certain bottler of mineral water
in this City, who uses a peculiar three-ply article in- his trade and one
which is not on sale in the open market. The other and heavier cus
tomer for the general article is the San Francisco Examiner.
Warden Hale of San Quentin prison does not remember the circum
stances leading up to the Examiner twine deal. As far as he is con
cerned there is no secret about the prison supplying Mr. Hearst's San
Francisco newspaper. .
'â¢ "Everybody, 1 thought, knew we made twine for the Examiner," was
the way he put it. "There is no secret about the doings of this prison.
We make a little money on twine, and if we made much of it, it would,
I think, be as profitable an industry as the prison could go into."
But the Examiner did not begin to purchase its twine from the jute
mill at any request of Warden Hale or any of the Prison Directors or offi
cials. T. T. Williams, the present business manager of the paper,
sought the prison people themselves in the beginning of October, 1895,
and got rates and prices. Williams explained in detail the kind of an
article the Examiner required, and after some correspondence on the sub
ject arrangements were perfected and, Mr. Hearst and his "Monarch"
havesince that time been steady customers of the prison jutemills.
The first shipment was made on October 21, 1895. It consisted of
894 pounds, divided into eight bales or parcels. The rate fixed at the
prison was 55$ cents per pound. The twine was a good article, as the
facilities in the prison jutemill to spin jute are the most extensive and
complete in America. Apparently the Examiner was pleased with the
transaction, for on October 28, just seven days later, the prison was
favored with a second order for 339 pounds. From that time on the
shipments from the prison to the newspaper have continued steadily and,
as far as the San Quentin authorities know, are likely to continue. The
newspaper pays its bills quarterly, and the checks are duly entered in a
special account on the jutemill books. The last shipment was made on
March 3 last. There were four bales in the lot, comprising 632 pounds,
and the account as rendered to Mr. Hearst called for $34 76.
The purchase of its twine supplies at San Quentin prison, of course,
entails no additional expense for freight to this City on the part of the
IN THE PILLORY.
Examiner. The State pays all freight on the output of the jutemill to this
City. Thus an intending purchaser of twine would have to take cogni
zance in the way of incidental expense only of transportation charges
from this City to the destination of the shipment. In the case of Mr.
Hearst's purchases the paper has only to figure the item of drayage from
the water front to the office of the Mission-street department of the
Examiner, where the greater portion of the twine is used.
It is the custom of the Examiner to notify the jutemill when it de
sires twine by telephone, although the last orderâ a fac-similie of which
is reproducedâ was a short and concise notice from the business depart
ment through the mail. The prison people are always prompt to fill the
order. Sometimes in the hurry and worry incidental to publishing a " new
journal " the matter of twine is overlooked until the supply on hand is
exhausted. Then the convicts are taken hurriedly away from the mak
ing of the sewing cord for jute bags to be put to twisting exclusive Ex
aminer twine. It is the custom for the prison authorities to ship all jute
goods, unless it is what is known as a "hurry-up order," by the little

the Examiner on Mission Street*

steamer Caroline, which makes a trip once a week between this City
and San Quentin.
The Caroline and its master, Captain W. S. Leale, charge up their
services to the State, and the bills are ordered paid monthly by the
Board of Prison Directors. The most of the Examiner jutemill freight
comes by the steamer route. The twine is bundled up in big sacks or
bales, and upon arrival here is carefully turned over to a teamster, who
is paid regularly for this work. These bundles or bales might pass even
the eyes of the curious, and there is little about them to show their con
vict origin. The prison people simply stamp on them a stencil imprint
bearing the letters S. Q. P., which, when translated, of course signify San
Quentin Prison."
There is another route by which the Examiner receives twine, and
that is the North Pacific Coast Railroad, commonly called the narrow
gauge, which has direct communication with the prison. If the order is
an urgent oneâ that is, what is facetiously called a "hurry-up" oneâ the
twine is dispatched by the railroad route. In this manner a consignment
may leave the prison in the afternoon and be available for use that same
night in the mailing-room of the paper. In such cases the rate is 7 cents
a hundred weight, or $1 40 a ton. But as it is customary for the State
to pay the bill, the paper, of course, is not put to any extra expense, and
may have its choice of routes of shipment.
The order for the four bales on March 2 last came to the City by
rail. It was possibly a fortunate matter that the jutemill happened to
have just this amount of stock on hand, made up between times, so to
speak, Ar just such an emergency. The requisition for the twine \va3
made out in the mailing- room in the morning and was inclosed at once
to Warden Hale. The shipment arrived in this City the following day,
and the mailing-room found it awaiting it as soon as the paper went to
press. In the equipment of the State jutemill at San Quentin there is no
winding-machine. The Examiner twine, as it comes from the twisting
machine, is consequently wound by hand in large balls and afterward
tied up in large sacks. The product being of the 8-ply variety, which is
almost as thick as a small clothesline, does nut'wlnd symmetrically or
else the fault lies with the convicts. The balls are bulky and irregular
in size and make rather unwieldy bundles. The shipment to the Exam'
iner on Wednesday last exhausted the supply of 8-ply twine in the prison.
The jutemill authorities expect to turn out some more the coming week.
There is a State law providing that any one purchasing goods from
the San Quentin jutemill must file an affidavit that the product is desired
for his own use. The object of this statute was to prevent dealers in
jutebags from effecting a corner in these articles and thus raise the price.
Moreover, in the matter of grain sacks a customer is limited to io.oco at
one purchase. The latter part of this law does not, of course, apply to
the matter of the Examiner twine, and in courtesy to Mr. Hearst no affi
davit was required from the business manager of his newspaper. The
prison authorities were satisfied in this instance that the proprietor of the
Examiner desired the twine for his own use and had no intention of going
into the twine business.
To the credit of the Examiner people it may be said that Warden
Hale's confidence was not violated. Of the 6600 pounds of 8-ply jute
twine made in the past eighteen months at San Quentin not one pound
has been resold by the newspaper that received it. The entire output was
used in the offices of Mr. Hearst's local newspaper.
So much for the facts in the case. They are peculiarly interesting,
coming, as they do, when Wanton Willie and his local journalistic pirate
have inaugurated a campaign of intimidation and blackmailing unheard
of in newspaper history. The strings that lead out of the back door of
the Mission-street office to the barred gates that shut in to hard labor
daily in the }uternill half of the striped inmates of the Mirin County
bastile may to a certain extent explain the low moral pressure that has
pervaded the Hearst journals lately. Possibly it is the bond of sympathy
that the young millionaire "â â â â â^â â
feels for his twine work
men in San Quentin that
has induced him to keep
Long Green Lawrence and
his ilk on his payroll.
Surely along these lines
lies the explanation of the
Janus-faced character of the
Examiner. There was no
particular reason at the time
the Examiner engaged to
take convict-made twine
that any such desperate
and questionable expedient
of economy should be re
sorted to, except that its
proprietor saw in those days
the inroads into his coffers
his newspaper venture in
New York was about to
make. But to a man of
his wealth the difference be
tween the price of free
labor twine and the convict
made article for wrapping
purposes was surely not a
matter of great import.

BOARD OF HEALTH'S
INVESTIGATION
OF
CONDENSED MILKS
AND CREAMS.
AN ITEM OF INTEREST
TO MOTHERS.
It has been disclosed by the in-
vestigation of Dr. Wenzell, the â¢
Chemist of the Board of Health,
that the so-called evaporated creams
are nothing but pure and simple
condensed milk, and in many in-
stances very poor condensed milk
at that, and while little or nothing
can be said in favor of .these
evaporated creams by Dr. Wenzell,
still less is said in favor . of most
brands of condensed milk, which
suffer equally under his searching
analysis. "i ; â 
Amid all this investiga-
tion and hue-and-cry one
prominent fact has been .
. . brought out with unusual
â¢ distinctness, and that is,
the Gail Borden EAGLE
Brand of Condensed Milk
has passed through the
fiery furnace of investiga-
tion of a most searching
character, with its usual ,
great success.
Every brand, except the Gaft
Borden Eagle Brand, that has come
under the attention of the chemist
has had more or less criticism be-
stowed upon it, but the Gail Bor-
den Eagle Brand has been found to
be without a single flaw, and has
been pronounced to be the r purest
and the richest in quality of any
brand on the market; superior to
evaporated creams in richness;
stronger than any milk now before
the public. .
The Pure Food Investi-
gation bids fair to be a
most searching, one, and
â  the public have 7 a great
interest at stake, and it . is
with pleasure 'that we re-
fer now to one brand that
seems to have met with
. the approval of ] all-
The accounts of the jute
mill show that since its
trade was transferred to the
prison a little over three and
a half tons of twine was
used in the circulation of
the Examiner. The product
cost 5 1-2 cents a pound.
Yet, had Mr. Hearst de-
sired to get rates in the
open market he would not
have had to pay over 8 cents
a pound for as good an arti
cle as he was furnished by
the striped jutemill work
men.
There is a serious side to
(he course Mr. Hearst is
pursuing. There is no de
sire on the part of any one
to make the lot of the felons
behind the walls of San
Quentin any harder or in
crease the odium in which
society in general holds its
inmates. The State of Cal
ifornia in its wisdom has
adjusted the problem of con
vict labor possibly to suit
a majority of the people at
present. But the felcn is
not the sufferer from such
tactics as those adopted by
Mr. Hearst.
The workingmen, the
labor unions and the busi
ness interests of the State
surely expect from the Ex
aminer that it at least be
honest in principle. The
people, to whom this dis
reputable journal appeals
for support, expect at least
PRICE FIVE CENTS.2
that in return for what favors they extend it the journal might recip
rocate. Many of the workingmen of this and other coast cities have been
subscribers to this newspaper. In return it- is but natural that they
should not look to it to garrote legitimate industry and honest labor !
What of the reckoning, Wanton Willie? What of the resolutions
against convict competition in labor which business and labor associa
tions have adopted during the past year, and which you professed to be
' in sympathy with in double-column type? What of the honeyed words
you used to the labor unions of this City when the tight was on against
the pedestal for the Grant monument in Golden Gate Park which was
hewn at the Folsom quarries ?
When the Examiner was falling over itself ' to ingratiate itself
among the workingmen at that time, surely it was due the laborers that
your newspaper was then the most important and one of the only two
consumers of convict twine made in San Quentin prison? What will
these workingmen, who have been so basely deceived and hoodwinked,
say in reply?
And lastly, tell us, Wanton Willie, if you have copyrighted this con
nection of yours with the prison jutemill, for as far as the records go no
one but yourself has mad? application for felon goods when a similar
article was on sale in a score of business houses in this City?
A little history at this particular juncture is appropriate. On
Friday, May 15, during the agitation by the labor unions against the
use of a pedestal for the Grant monument which had been hewn in the
Folsom quarries by convicts, the following editorial appeared in the
Ex. unit: 1 r :
The Grant Sfotufment in Golden Gate Park will be built
by free labor.
That much is settled already. The Examiner's offer to
help out the Monument Association if necessary by replac
ing the convict-hewn stones with others cut by honest men,
made it certain that the demands of the public would be
heeded. Mr. O'Connor, the chairman of the committee, has
has taken upon himself the responsibility of making the
desireJ change, any deficiency incurred thereby to fee made
good by the Examiner.
The labor unions took up this matter because their in
terests were involved, though it would have demanded at
tention just as much if not a workingmanhad protested. It
is, first of all, a question of sentiment. If we are to pay no
attention to sentimental considerations what do we want of
a monument? A monument represents sentiment and
nothing else.
It is not useful. Its only value is that it stands for
something. It tells the beholder that here a grateful people
has paid its tribute of gratitude to a great soldier who
offered his sword to his country in her time of need, and
who led an army of American volunteersâ tree men them
selves â to bring freedom to those who were in bondage and
preserve a Union that was the hope ot liberty throughout the
world.
What a ghastly mockery it would be to attempt to call
up such memories with an inscription cut by the sullen
fingers of burglars and murderers under the rifles of a
prison guard.
No, if we are to honor Grant, let us honor him. If we
could not have offered a great monument we could have
had a small one, bu h , great or small, let us have no stone
that stands for crime and its piin : shment.
Now let the curtain be pulled aside and a glimpse of the true
Examiner be shown. Let the prison records, the books of the jute
mill, tell the real truth. On May 1, just fourteen days before the flaunt
ing of the foregoing editorial, there was shipped to Mr. Hearst's paper a
consignment of four bales of twine From San Quentin. On May 9,
when the indignation over the felon-hewn pedestal was at its height, a
second shipment of 629 pounds of twine followed. What was a''ques
tion of sentiment" in its columns was not a question of sentiment as far
as the real, genuine policy of the paper was concerned.
What a "ghastly mockery" it was that the workingmen did not then
know that the "Monarch of the Fakers" was the exclusive newspaper
customer of th. 3 product of the "sulien fingers of burglars and murderers
vnder the rifles of a prison guard !"
Again hear the charlatan on this same question of convict labor:
"Shall the convict-cut pedestal to the monument to
General Grant be allowed to remain in place in Golden
Gate Park ?
" Shall the bust of the dead hero be set up on a monu
ment carved by prison labor?
"The Examiner feels that it voices the sentiments of the
people when it says * NO.'
" What is more, the Examiner is not merely willing to
act as the people's mouthpiece, but it proposes to take the
initiative in substituting for the great granite pedestal hewn
and figured by the Folsom felons stone that does not bear
the marks of prison tools, but those of free labor.
" The Examiner offers to place at the disposal of the
proper authorities a granite blcck, properly cut and in
scribed by free workmen, at the earliest possible oppor
tunity.
" This offer is the outgrowth of the feeling now gen
erally expressed by citizens, and particularly by the free
laboring element, that it would be discreditable to San
Francisco if the monument to General Grant, soon to be

unveiled in the park, should be shaped by convicts. * * **'
But behind the scenes the "question of sentiment" for free and
honest labor was forgotten. Here the Monarch was unmasked and over
the telephone went a "hurry-up" order for convict twine. The Mission
street journalistic Mr. Hyde said rightly when it declared the people
were opposed to ccnvict labor. on the Grant pedestal, but in its lair the
farce was dropped and the prison order-books continued to add to the
Examiner's twine account. The men of the stripes did not cease to
work on the big jute spinners and yarn twisters in order that Mr. Hearst
might save 2}Â£ cents a pound on Examiner twine.
The business organizations and the labor councils of this City
should see hereafter that Mr. Hearst and his journal be consistent. Of
course, it may not be possible to persuade him that in being a consumer
of convict-made goods he is penny wise and pound foolish, but now that
his sin has found him out he must no longer be allowed to play the role
of a truthful and good citizen. The wage-earners of the State may now
learn just how deep a place they have in the sympathies of the Examiner.
Hereafter when it pokes its hypocritical nose into their conventions and
doings they will know it for the journalistic polecat it is.
Various commercial and trade bodies and organizations mny learn as
they read. The Examiner has posed in the past as the friend and
advocate of home industry. From this time on all men should read be
tween the lines. When it howls loudest in its efforts to hoodwink its
way into the circle of respectability its convict trademark may be seen
by turning the leaf. By its actions it may be known for what it really
is. The Manufacturers' and Producers' Association is already on record
oti the matter of convict-made goods. The following resolution speaks
for itself:
WHEREAS, The Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation of California has had under consideration the matter
its high regard for and best wishes to his
predecessdr. "
The court then directed the commission
be entered on the records.
The brief ceremony was witnessed by a
large crowd of spectators and at its close

General MiKenp.a, retired.

; Senate to be taken to jail this after-
It was a day for congratulation to '

f the Senate is a matter for congratula
tion to every man, woman and child who
has the welfare and good repuie o! the
commonwealth at heart â a matter for con
pratulation to the people of the entire
I . ited States.
By its firm, consistent and self-respect
ing action to-day the Senate has officially
proclaimed to the world at large that no
foul emanation of "modern new journal
:-m" can ply its loathsome business of
blackmail, deceit, treachery, misrepre
sentation and its vocation of slanderer,
libeier and traducer with impunity in
this State. This branch of the Legisla
ture has set a precedent that will be
thankfully and gratefully taken advan
tage of wherever a viper born of the so
called "new journalism" dares to raise its

to siop these interruptions and breeches

of the Senate and were in danger of being
excluded from the chamber.
Amid all the comments not a word of
â¢ympathy was expressed for the faker-in
chief of the faking misconception of a
newspaper, and his disgraceful fate was
hailed senerally as it only too well mer
ited. The audience wad the largest that
had crowded its way into the Senate
chamber this session, ladies, Assembly
men, State officers and many of the most
prominent people of Sacramento being
present. This was the case during both
morning and afternoon sessions.
Three separate resolutions of sentence I
were introduced, one each for Long Green j
Lawrence, one for L. L. Lievines and one |
for Al Murphy, but at the last moment, i
just when a vote was about to be taken on
tne Murphy resolution, Senator More- j
house asked leave *.o withdraw it, and
there being no objection, permission was i
granted. This action was due to the gen- ;
eral belief that Murphy had no hand, j
either directly or indirectly in the prepara
tion or publication of the contemptible
fake, and that he was simply unfortunate
in having some slight knowledge, inad
vertently acquired, relative to it.
There was a full attendance of the Sena
tors, with the exception of Senator Toner,
who was excused yesterday, owing to a
death in his family, and Senator Hollo
way, who was given leave of absence last
Friday until Wednesday.
Again, during the entire proceedings
and the discussions incident to
them, there was the same unani
mous admission on the part of ail
who took the fake journal Bide of the
case that there was no foundation for its
article charging wholesale bribery and
corruption to the members of the Legisla
ture. There was not even the slightest
attempt to justify its course, even by
George A. Knight, its chief counsel. All
the efforts to prevent the sentence of im
prisonment from being pronounced were
on the line of technicality, such as ques
tions of jurisdiction and of the materiality
of the questions propounded.
Senator Morebouse was the chief figure
on the floor and acquitted himself with
the highest honor and credit to himself
and the honorable body which had, with
its full confidence and rare good judgment,
entrusted its canse to his management.
Before his eloquence and learning the
weak defense 01 the contumacious wit
nesses was splintered into such minute
fragments that nothing remained visible
oi it when the Senator from Santa Clara
got through his opening argument. He
was ably seconded by Senators Boyce and
Pedlar. Others sat ready to speak for vic
tory, for decency and morality â notably
Senators Simpson, Bnlfa and Gillette â
but they realized tiat their aid was un
called for.
Senator Dickinson opened the sensa
tional drama immediately the president
announced that the hour had arrived for
the consideration of the Examiner con
tempt proceedings. The chairman of the
Senate bribery investigation committee
asked that the witnesses be brought before
the bar of the Senate and that the ques
tions which they had refused to answer
be again propounded to them.
At once there was a cranifig of necks
and a straining of eyen to see the man
who had dared to besmirch the reputa
tions of honorable public men, and the
two unfortunates whom he had involved
in the shameful affair, and who were ap
parently marked to suffer punishment
with him.
But Long Green Lawrence did not pro
pose to niaka a Roman holiday spectacle
for the Sacramentans if he could help it.
When his nanao was sounded he slunk to
the right-hand side of the President's
dais, between that and the secretary's hign
desk, where he was out of view of the
assemblage. He was not permitted, how
ever, to hide his shame under a bushel,
for Senator Bulla asked that the wit*

nesses be made to appear in front of the
Secretary's desk, where they could be
heard and seen by the Senators, and the
request was promptly granted. With slow
and halting steps, with face diffused with
the coming red glow of shame and impu
dence, vainly trying to assume an appear
ance of defiant nonchalance, the fake man
aging news editor walked around to where
he was in full view.
Here was presented the edifying spec
tacle of an individual who was chosen to
preside over the destinies of a journal
claiming to be a monarch in its field
answering the questions propounded to
him in weak and faltering voice, witn the
awkwardness and shamefacedness of a
recruit at school, at the promptings of
his attorney.
As before the committee he declined to
answer the questions. But that there
may be no .mistaken impression in refer
ence to the actuating cause of this ob
duracy, it must be stated that there was
nothing of moral courage, of loyalty to
his employer, of protecting the interests
of those who he claimed had confided in
him. It was a course that was forced
upon him by the exigencies of the situa
tion to avoid publicly and frankly admit
ting that he had prepared, or caused to be
prepared, and published in his engine of
Hastiness what he knew was * fake.
Levings and Murphy in turn also re
mained obaurate.
All three were brought before the bar
together, and then George A. Knight made
his areument in their behalf, relying on
legal technicalities to carry his cause, but
his effort was a pitiable one to the spec
tators. He was in bad voice from a cold,
and his whole demeanor indicated that
his heart wns not in the cause he repre
sented, and made impressive Senator
Morehouse's characterization later that he
was a "hired Republican speaker making
politics for a Democratic journal."
Though Knight, according to the resolu
tion, was allowed but half an nour, he oc
cupied the attention of the Senate for a
full hour.
Morehouse opened for the Senate, by
presenting the resolutions prescribing the
punishment for the witnesses, and from
first to last poured such hot shot into the
scavenger newspaper that the audience
was unable to restrain its approbation,
and many a lady's glove had to be re
paired this evening. He rose to the oc
casion like one inspired, hurling at the
Long Green journal words of scorn, con
tempt and denunciation in sentences that
seemed to make tlie very atmosphere
seethe with their fire. When lie concluded
there was a hush that was the greatest
compliment that could have been paid
him.
Bert made a feeble pretext, tout the
questions asked were not pertinent, for
voting against the resolution.
Withing'.on, who had voled against the
resolution citing the witnesses for con
tempt, had a change of heart, and spoke
in favor of punishing them.
Prisk, a Democrat, assumed to feel no
wound to hi- honor by the assault of the
Examiner upon him.
Stratton attempted to argue the legal
phases of the matter to excuse his opposi
tion to the reaolution, but his effort was
as weak as it was futile.
Pedlar took strong and manful ground
with Morehouse and took the Senator
from Alameda, who had preceded him,
severely to task for his puerile argument.
Boyce spoke at length and eloauently,
delivering a speech much in line and
strength with that of Senator Morehouse.
With the simple sentence, "1 ask that
the roll be called," Senator Morehouse
closed the debate. The rollcall on the
first r-'solution sent Long Creen Lawrence
to jail by a vote of 25 ayes to 12 noes, and
a similar vote performed the same service
for Levings.
On motion of Senator Morehouse both
prisoners were ordered at once into the
custody of fcjergeant-at-Arms Leslie Dlack
burn, to be delivered to Sheriff Frank
Johnson, and imprisoned in the County
jail.

Proceedings in the Senate to

Lawrence.
SACRAMENTO, Cai... March 9.-Presi
dent Jeter had the Examiner contempt
matter well in mind apparently this
mornine, for when 11 o'clock came around
he promptly announced as the special
order the consideration 01 the case.
Senator Dickinson wns equally on the
alert and took the floor, saying: "I move
that the witnesses under subpena appear
at the bar of the Senate."
"The witnesses are here," responded the
chairman, nodding to his right.
"I call attention to the resolution which
calls for the questions being propounded
10 them by the President of the Senate,"
continued Dickinson.
Long Green Lawrence's name was called
by President Jeter, and be rose from
where he had placed himself bo as to be
almost completely free from observation.
"Propound to Mr. Lawrence the ques
tions in the order as submitted in the
report of the investigating committee,"
added the President. "And yon are in
structed, Mr. Lawrence, that you are as a
witness required to answer the questions
propounded."
Secretary Brandon asked the witness
the first question, which he declined to
answer, as before the committee, but not
until Garret McEnerney, acting as counsel
for the culprit, made an objection on the
ground that the information Lawrence
possessed was privileged and that whether
it had this character or not it was imma
terial, incompetent and Irrelevant.
Here Senator Bulla asked that the wit
ness be placed before the bar where he
could bj seen and heard by all the mem
bers. President Jeter so ordered.
Senator Boyce at this time gave a gentle
hint to the audience that it remain as
quiet as possible by suggesting that if it
was found impossible to preserve a proper
decorum the Senate as a court in this case
might go into executive session. The
Senator from Santa Barbara had been ab
sent from the Senate yesterday, owing to
indisposition, and was uninformed of
what had then transpired and of the plan
of the Senate in reference to procedure.
In the ardor of his desire for speedy jus
tice he rose to a point of order when the
second question was propounded to Law
rence and McEnerney remarked, "1 will
answer for him." Boyce said the witness
was under oath and answered on his con
science, and could not employ a conscience
to answer for him. His counsel might
adviae, he added, but could not answer
for him.
Lawrence, on the instructions of his at
torney, followed exactly the same course
as before the committee, except that he
gave as his reasons for declining to
answer the question the same as were em
bodied in the objections of McEnerney to
the first interrogatory.
Levings and Murphy followed the same
programme. The questions were asked
partly by Secretary Brandon and partly
by President J>ter.
Boyce created another diversion after
Lawrence had refused to answer the first
question by making a speech at length to
tiie effect ttiat the witn -.-(.a he stance pun
ished for his contumacy. He was called
to order by one of the Senators on the
ground that there was nothing pendinjr
before the House, and the proposed
course of the Senate was explained to him.
He then made a motion that the news
papers be excluded from the chamber dur
ing the examination of the witnesses, as
their appearance tended Ao divert the at
tention of the Senators, and he believed
that the matter under consideration was
of the highest and gravest importance to
the Senate. The motion was adoptfd.
The next formal step in the proceedings
was to ask the three witnesses to take their
places at the bar together, where they svere
given seats in a row, and in plain view ol
everybody.
"Mr. Lawrence," said President Jeter,
"have you any reason to present why you
should not be punished for contempt for
refusing to answer the questions asked?'
The same question was put to Murphy
and Livings.
Then George A. Knight, who had been
specially selected to make the argument
before the Senate on behalf of the culprits,
took the place of Secretary Brandon.
He began by asking the Senate to divest
itself of all partisan feeling and any pre
judice caused by the publication of the
fake article. The power of the Senate to
take ud slanderous publications directed
against that body was questioned. Ad
missions were made by tho eloquent ad
vocate of the faking newspaper that the
article was baseless and had been pub
lished on hearsay and rumor. Tho Senate
was advised to go to the courts, which
stood with open arms to receive them,
and secure justice, if its memoers had
been libeled. No one was charged by a
regularly drawn indictment, and for that
reason the faker's attorneys claimed there
was no legal cause before the Senate.
"What are you going to do with us?"
he had the hardihood to ask. "If we ad
mit it is a Us and libel â what jurisdiction
have you if wÂ« admit what you are trying
to prove?' Thi3 bold flaunting of tho
faker's shame was followed by an impu
dent implied threat. "Beware â beware!
Don't be tempted to be called out in the
ofliug by a great Democratic newspaper,"
he shouted. In conclusion he said: "I
aslc you that these witntsses b-i permitted
to go without day, and that the Senate say
these questions were not pertinent; that
they do not look to the expulsion of ony
member ol this Sjnate charged with
bribery."
Knight had not closed his argument
when the usual hour of recess arrived, and
his time was extended without limitation
to permit him to close at his pleasure.
His effort fell flat, many leaving the
chamber while he was delivering his
speech.
Morehonse attempted to introduce the
resolutions providing for the punishment
of the witness when Knight had finished,
but Seawell, by springing a point of order
that the Senate was at recess, prevented.
It was 1 o'clock when the morning pro
ceedings came to an end. At 2 o'clock the
Senate was again tilled to its utmost ca
pacity.
Senator Morehouie sent the Lawrence
resolution to tiie desk and asked that it be
read, which was done amid silence and
the deepest attention. The text is as fol
lows:
WnERKAS Heretofore, this Senate, by reso
lution duly pusaed, appointed Senntors John
11. Dickinson. Eugeno Aram and J. H. Seawell
an Investigating Committee to investigate ihe
charges of bribery preferred by tho San Fran
cisco Examiner against this Senate; an<?
whereas, said committeo had A. M. Lawrence,
managing editor of the San Frnnaisco Exam
iner, before said committee; and whereas,
upon the said A. M. Lawrence being duly
sworn to answer questions before said com
mlttee, and admitting that ho was the manag
ing editor of said paper; and -whereas, upon
said examination the Baid A. M. Lawrence, as
a witness, was allowed counsel at his re
quest, and being asked certain questions,
as will bo seen by the report of the said
committee made to this Senate, and which
said questions being material to the
inquiry and investigation being carried on
and conducted by the said committee, he, the
sa d A. M. Lawrence, then and there refused
and declined to answer the said questions;
and wnereas, the said committee reported the
said action of the said committee and the
questions propounded to the Baid witness, the
said A. M. Lawrence, and that he had contu
maciously refused to answer the said ques
tions to this Senate; and whereas, upon the
coming in of the said report of the said com
mittee this Senate resolved that the said A. M.
Lawrence be subpenaea before the bar of the
Senate to show cause why he should not
answer the said questions; and whereas, the
said witness, A. M. Lawrence, was duly sub
penaed before the Senate, and at 11 a. m.
of the 9th day of March, A. D.
1897, appeared before the bar of the Senate;
and whereas, the said questions reported by
the said committee were then and there pro
pounded to him, the said A. M. Lawrenc3, by
the president of the Senate, and he, the said
A. M. Lawrence, then and there again refused
and declined to answer the said questions,
having no lawful or legal excuse therefor, and
having been auly represented by counsel of
his own selection, and having the ability and
power to answer the said questions, but contu
maciously reiusing to answer the same; now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the said A. M. Lawrence be
and he is hereby declared to be guilty of con
tempt of this Senate, and be it further
Kesalved, That he, the said A. M. Lawrence,
be taken into custody by the Sergent-at-Arms
of the Senate and thÂ«t he be committed to the
county jail of ihe county of Sacramento, State
of California, until he shall have purged him
self of this contempt by answering the ques
tions which were propounded to him, under
the direction of the Senate and that a copy oi
this resolution, duly attested by the Secretary
of the Senate be the authority of the Sergeant
at-Arms of the Senate and the Sheriff of the
county of Sacramento.
After moving the adoption of the reso
lution Morehouse began the most notable
speech of the session by reciting the
events that led up to the present denoue
ment.
"There is here a charee,' 1 he continued,
referring to the subject-matter of the fake
article, "that every single Senator who
votea for Assembly bill 2^3â and I make
this charge boldly, and I do not pro
posn a single wcrd of it â was bribed
with from ?350 to $500. The committee
found out who were connected with the
San Francisco Examiner. It found that
A. M. Lawrence was managing editor. It
called in this managing editor, and it
sought from him to find out the source of
the information that was the basis that
would lead to the detection of the man
who had used his intluence in the way nt
coin to purchase votes on the floor of this
Senate, and. further, sought to ascertain
who the Senators were who had taken
$350 to $50J ior their vote. Is there any
thing wrong in that?
"When called upon to disclose his in
formation he nides himself, like every
other criminal hides himself â he refuses
to answer the question."
Morehouse took up the question of the
power and jurisdiction of the Legislature
in the matter and said:
â¢â The Supreme Court of the State of Cali
fornia is certainly more capable of telling
what the law is than a hired Republican
who comes bofore us to make Democratic
politics in behalf of the Examiner."
Morehou'e cited the case of D. O. Mc-
Carthy,which was decided by the Supreme
Court of this State in 1866, "in charity, in
kindness to these gentlemen of the Exam
iner, who had no charity, no kindness, no
decency, no self-respect." He showed
clearly that this was a parallel case in
nearly every particular.
According to the opinion of the court
the Legislature had all the power requi
site lor self-preservation. Tnen quot
ing from this decision ne showed that
the Legislature had the powers necessary
to preserve and protect the dignity of the
Senate as a body.
'"If there be a member in this Senate,"
he continued, "who has taken a bribe â I
repeat it, if there bs a member in this
Senate who has taken a bribe let this Ren
ate stop the investigation and punish
him. If I be that Senator 1 say to you
that you are lacking in manhood, you are
cowardly in the performance of your pub
lic duty, unless you brand me as a felon
and drive me out as the Roman Senate
drove Catiline."
Quoting further from the McCarthy de
cision he showed that the Senate had the
right "to protect itself and its members
from libelous and slanderous attacks."
"Why," he scornfully said, "the learned
counsel this morning said we had no
such power. Do you wish my friend
(designating Senator Buila), coming here
from Los Angeles by the voe of the peo
ple, to be lib led ana slandered without
trying to protect yourself. Here it is
charged that the members of this body,
that every member who voted for tn:s
measure, received $350 to $500. Is that
slanderous and lihrflous? And yet we are
to bow down ana submit to this charge
concerning our conduct."
"To protect itself and its members from
corruption," he quoted. "For shame," he
exclaimed, "that any man or any citizen
snouhi attempt to advocate any such doc
trine as that upon the floor of the Senate.
'Oh no,' says the Examiner, 'you have no
right. You must appeal to the judiciary;
you must file a libel suit against W. R.
Heart of New YorK.' Shall we? I think
not, possessing the power as we do. You
must not do that. You will be persecut
ing the3e delightful gentlemen who brand
ed you as bribe-takers.
"Day alter day you will read some lie
about us in that journal, because it is im
possible for the San Francisco Examiner
to tell the truth on any subject. [Laugh
ter.] It would injure the reputation of
the paper to establish it on an honest
bttsis. [Laughter,]
"In this case of McCarthy but seven
men were involved, while here it will be
held that the charge is against every man
who voted for Assembly bill 273. Mc-
Carthy was sent to tbe County Jail, got
out a writ of habeas corpus and the Su
preme Court sent him back to jail, when
he relented.
"Simply because I am the manager of
this proceeding and have the earnestness
a.id the character and the nerve to beard
the lion in his den and the Douglas in bis
hall I expect more of these infamous lies
to be printed about me. Let it come.
The time will come when my voice will
be heard from Siskiyou to San Diego and
be more powerful than any newspaper,
and don't you forget it. [Applause.]
"Do the members want the words
'scoundrel' and 'bribe-taker' written
across their foreheads? Why should j
these honest gentlemen, I appeal to you,
Mr. Chairman â why should these honest
gentlemenâ and I use the words bs Marc
Antony used themâ why should these
honest gentlemen who possess this knowl
edge that Senator Morehouse and Senator
Franck and Senator Chapman and other
Senators who saw fit to vote for this
measure took $300 to $500 for their votes,
be allowed to keep this knowledge?
"For myself I brand it as a lie and the
man who wrote it as a liar. But we ought
to let it go by. Shall we permit this man
to blackniail, to vilify and corrupt the
whole community; to corrupt personal
honor? This paper will do it all the time.
Do you tell me that this man is worthy of
respect from any human being? Yon may
respect him. If so, I feel sorry that you
have forgotten your manhood and woman
hood. It ought to be a matter of shame
to be an associate of such a vile thing.
"We have no right to investigate public
slanders. We should sit here and render
up our morning orisons and our prayers
to A. M. Lawrence. He is a god. He is
the one man endowed with all the virtues
a man can possess and bis chief virtue is
to write down any individual who votes for
a measure thai A. M. Lawrencs does not
like. "We should teach the State that there
is one Senate possessed of the manhood
and character to dare present honesty and
truth to the public."
He referred to the telegram he had re
ceived from W. F. Herrin requesting him
to cease opposing Assembly bill 273 and
declared that he had shown no reluctance
to producing the message, ar.d added:
"Wnat harm is there iv it? If that is
harmful then there is no man in the Sen
ate who should not be cent to the peniten
tiary.
"As for my being an attorney for the
Southern Facific, I never denied I was an
attorney for the railroad. I thanK God
that he gave me power enough and brains
enough to be the attorney for a railroad
company. [Applause.] And I want the
world to know my connection with the
railroad. It has always treated me right.
It has employed me year alter year, and
when I ;^et through with a case I make
out my bill and send it to the company
and they always pay it. That is my crime.
I don't think there is a lawyer with the
brains of a newly fledged dove that
wouldn't take it to-morrow il he could get
it. [Applause.]
"It nay be nossible that this great en
gine may lire on you Republicans and you
may be defeated in your political aspira
tions. But they can't hurt you. They
tried to kill off Stephen M. White, but
White was superior to the San Francisco
Examiner. I only give this to you that
you won't be afraid of this penny-a-liner.
"What are you going to do? 1 know
wnat I am going to do. This man has
been before the bar of justice. I shall vote
for this resolution. I want an example
which shall say to this newspaper writer,
'You shall not charge a Senator with
bribery unless you have the proof.' "
The Bruner case was cited as showing
how ready the Examiner was to submit
its proofs when it really had them. He
then continued :
"Now, if the private relations between
Mr. Hearst and these gentlemen are so
disreputable, I am willing to excuse
them. Why don't they answer if they
have any truth to tell? They want to be
put in a position to say that this oenate
fell down and that the Senate dared not
punish them for contempt. They will
not put me ; n this position. They can
hound me with their emissaries; they
can send men to peep through keyholes
and over transoms, but there is one
thing certain â they can't hurt a hair of
my head, for truth will beat them every
time.
"What will you do? laskyouto stand
up like men and teach tbeÂ«e men that
they have braved our power; teach them
that it is in our power to make them tell
ns what they know or say, 'We lied about
this thirty-second session of the Legisla
tuie.'"
Bert sai>l he could not vote for the reso
lution because the questions asked the
witnesses and which they refused to an
swer were not pertinent, and that no evi
dence had been submitted to show that
the charges were founded on any fact.
He added the Senators needed no further
vindication ot their honor and honesty.
Withington, to the surprise. of every
one, swung into the ranks of the majority
who voted for the resolution to cite for
contempt, although no testimony had
been adduced.
Prisk, doubting the Senate's power to
punish for contempt, but statins there
was no evidence whatever to substantiate
the Examiner's charges, opposed the reso
lution.
Str.itton offered some technical objec
tions as an excuse to permit him to vote
against the resolution.
Pedlar expressed surprise over the "pe
culiar speech of the Senator from Ala
nieda" and declared it was no time for
technicalities, and said that he for one
would be willine to stop ail proceedings if
the paper would retract all it had said
about the matter.
Senator Boyce delivered a scorching hot
address. "I know," he said, ":hat no
newspaper can ever rise above or distin
guish itself from the character of the man
who is at the iie^d of it, any more than a
fountain can rise above its source."
Referring to Long Green Lawrence, the
Senator continued: "If he can say that
bribery stalked in our midst, if he can say
that every one who voted for a certain
measure is guilty of bribery with im
punity, then we should fold our tents
and silently steal away after we have
stolen everything in sight, as some of the
Sacramentans say we do.
"These men have sought to charge cor
ruption in a public journal. It is proper
that this body should cleanse itself and
leave itself above suspicion. I believe
that these rsso utions simply indicate that
we are strong enough and firm enough to
resist the attack of any journal."
Hi* closing words were .is follows:
"That thing which has been excluded
from the mails by one house of our United
Government; that journal states Portland
condemned and threw out of its public
library as being too indecent to be on Its
tables, should be punished.
"I am not afraid to handle vermin. If
by any means within my power I can do
some good in the world I am willing to go
down into the gutter to crush out this
viper*
Storehouse saw the trend of matters and
with good sense closed his case by this
impressive and simple sentence:
"I ask that the roll be now called."
When the secretary had finished this
was the vote in favor of punishment:

Seawell changed his vote \ for the par
pose of securing a reconsideration, so the
official vote shows 26 ayes and 11 noes.
Dickinson refrained from voting, as -he
was chairman of. the committee of inves
tigation, and Holloway and Toner were
absent.
Senator Morehouse withdrew the reso
lution providing for the punishment of
Al Murphy, and ,the vote on the Levings
resolution was the same as on the first
one, except that Wolfe dodged the vote,
Dic&inson and Stratton voted for the reso
lution and Smith voted against It.
Seawell again changed his vote to aye
for the purpose of "reconsideration, and
the official record of this vote also shows
26 ayes and 11 noes.
The matter of reconsideration cuts no

: On motion of Senator Morehouse the
two prisoners were ordered into the cus

OUT ON BONDS.
Long Green Temporarily
Gets Out of the Sheriffs
Hands by Furnish
ing Bail*
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 9.â After
the Senate bad rendered its decision that
the managing editor of the Examiner ana
the reporter who wrote the bulk of the
libelous article were guilty of contempt,
the prisoners at the bar were taken by
Sergean!-at-Arms Blackburn to the office
of Adjutant-General Barrett, where the
Examiner's attorneys. Garret McEnerney,
A. J. Clunie, George A. Knight and
Charles F. Hanlon, held a consultation
with reference to the proceedings in
habeas corpus.
After the campaign of the defense had
been mapped out Lawrence and the rest
went to supper at a French restaurant,
and at 9 o'clock were turned over into the
custody of Sheriff Johnson. This was
merely technical, for they were brought
to the chambers of Judge Hughes, where
a petition for the writ of habeas corpus
was filed, and where Charles F. Hanlon
and Railroad Commissioner Hugh M.
Larue filed bonds for the appearance of
the prisoners to show cause on Thursday,
March 11, at half-past 1 in the alternoon,
why the sentence of the Senate should not
be carried out. The bonds were iixea at
$1000 each, and after the necessary formal
itie-t had been observed the prisoners, to
gether with their attorneys, left the
courthouse and, celebrated their respite by
opening champagne in the Golden Eagle
bar.
A peculiar incident occurred at half
past 11 o'clock tbis evening in the office
of the Golden Eaglej Hotel. Senator
Franck of Santa Clara was conversing
with Sergeant-at-Arms Blackburn of the
Senate when Andy Lawrence approached
him and angrily said : '-Father Riordan
of Santa Clara College has telegraphed
me that he 13 opposed to the bill allowing
the girls from the Wbittier School to be
removed to Santa Clara. You don't de
ceive me any more."
Senator Franck laughed at him, and
Lawrence retired to the headquarters of
the Examiner in the inner office.

portortbat the remark of Lawrence was
an attempt to bulldoze him. The Senator
favored tho bill to have the Whittier girls
transferred to Santa Ciara, and had pre
sented a petition to the Legislature on
which appeared the names of Father
Riordan and Capitalist Bond, and the Ex
aminer opposed the bill "for reasons,"
added the Senator. "No doubt the Ex
aminer got paid for it. I understood
from Andy Lawrence's words and manner
that he was trying to intimidate or defy
me. But he can't do it. I voted to-day to
havo him sent to prison, and I would vote
the same way to-morrow."
The release of Lawrence and his re
porter was on what is known as a Sheriff's
bond. Tne Sheriff, on the advice of Dis
trict Attorney Ryan, approved of the
bonds signed by Hanlon and Larue, and
discharged the prisoners, with the ap
proval of JudgÃ Hughes.
It is now claimed that this was an ille
gal action and that the Sheriff and Jndee
Hughes are liable to impeachment, be
cause the prisoners had not taken an ap
peal from the judgment, but had merely
applied for a writ of habeas corpus.
Opinion is divided on the matter. Some
Bay that the Sheriff has no right to turn
loose a convicted prisoner, bond or no
bond. That power lies with the court
after the hearing on habeas corpus. It is
different in case of an appeal, but in this
case no appeal was tiled. If this opinion
be correct it is likely that impeachment
proceedings will be instituted against
Sheriff Johnson and Judge Hughes.

COjaPTKOLLKU HCKLE& TO RETIRE
Charlet O. Davcei of Ernntton, 111., Hit
J'robab!e fiucrca.tor.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 9.â A Her
ald special from Washington says James
H. Eekles, Comptroller of the Currency,
will probably retire from that cilice in a
few days to accept ths office of Special
Commissioner, created by the monetary
conference act, wh.ch became a law in the
last hours of President Cleveland's ad
ministration.
It is s.tated on good authority that the
President has offered this place to Eekles
and that he will accept it.
Charles G. Dawes of Evan3ton, 111., will
probably be appointed Comptroller of the
Currency.
The monetary act authorizes the Presi
dent to appoint "one or more special
commissioners or envoys to such of the
nations of Europe as lie may designate, to
seek by diplomatic negotiations an inter
national asr^ement lor securing afixitv
of relative value between gold and stiver
as money by means of a common ratio
between these metals, with free mintage
at such ratio."
This ar.t appropriates $100,000 for the
expense of this undertaking While it is
not known what salary the President will
fix, it is said that Eekles will accept the
place with the understanding that it will
be $7500 a year. His salary as Comptroller
13 $10,000 and his term of rive years will
not expire until April, 1898.
It has been President MiKinley's inten
tion to permit Eekles to serve out his
term as Comptroller, and he would have
done so had not this conference act cre
ated a position which the Comptroller is
especially qualified to fill. It i 3 not known
whether more than one commissioner will
be named.

a portion of the war with the Pennsylvania
volunteers.

SENSATIONAL SUICIDE.
When Detectives Try ;o Break Into His
Room a Swed/sh Embezzler
Shoots H.mself.
NEW YORK, N. V.. March 9.â A man
registering as â¢' G. Anderson, Sweden,"
but who is believed to be Gustav Rimblad,
committed suicide in his room at the Astor
House this afternoon by shooting himself
through the head. He reached New York
yesterday ar.d immediately went to the
Astor House, *here he was assigned a
room on the top floor. This was the last
time he was seen alive. Shortly after
noon to-day two United States Marshals
and the hotel detective went to bii room
and knocked. Ritnblad asked what was
wanted. He was informed tnat a friend
wanted to see him. He replied that he
could not come in. The officers then de
manded that he open tha door in the name
of tne law, and Rimblad persisted in His
refusal, and they proceeded to force tho
door. Just then a shot was heard and
when the door was finally forced Rimblad
was found ly.ng on the bed with a gaping
wound in hi 3 head. On the floor lay the
revolver.
It was evident that the deed was pre
meditated. Upon a table in the room oc
cupied by 'he suicide there was found a
bundle of letters inclosed in a note signed
"Gustav Rimbiad," and requesting that
the letters be sent to his home in Halm
stead, Sweden. When the St. Loub was
coming up the bay yesterday two deputy
Marshals met her with a revenue cutter.
Tney boarded the big liner and searched
for some prisoner, presnmbly to-day's sui
cide. In some manner Rimblad escaped
detection. Rimblad, who is described as
â¢'intendante" of the Holland battalion
and manager of the provisional hospital
at Halmstead, was accused of having em-
Dezz!ed pubiic funds to the amount of
15,000 crowns. He is said to have ab
sconded February 22 last.
HAD BETTER I'AY THIS DUTY.
Dingley Vrepnre* n Club for the Trftt-
Wool Importer*.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 9.â A spe
cial to the Herald from Washington says:
Chairman Dingley of the Ways and
Means Committee has a lar^e-^ized club
ready for importers who are attempting
to bring in large stock? of goods unuer
the present tariff laws, so as to avoid the
paying of increased duties under the new
iaw.
Members of the committee will not say
in exactly what manner it is hoped to
reach these firni3, but they talk confi
dently of their ability to so frame the bill
as to make the efforts of the importers to
evade the higher taxes very unprofitable.
Speaking of the report that ninny cargoes
of wool are now in transit to this country,
and that the owners expected to bring
them in free of duty, one of the Republi
can members of the committee said yes
terday :
"These gentlemen don't know wtiat a
rul de sac they Â«re running into. They
will find that there is enough ability in
the Ways and Means Committee to cir
cumvent them In their attempt to defraud
the treasury. 1 can't tell you just how
we are gome to reacn them, but I can say
they had better Bell their wooi as soon as
it is landed and savn the money to hire
lawyers. The lawyers will get as much
out of them as they would pay under ttie
increased duties, or they will have law
suits on hand tnat will last the rest of
their lives."
OKLAHOMA'S I-V t A LID DIFORCBS.
Another Decree Canc-I'd hy a StU) York

NEW YORK, N. V., Marcli 9.â Justice
Lawrence in the Supremo Court to-day
declared another Oklahoma divorce in
valid. In 189t> John F. Driscoll told his
wife that he was going to lowa to get a
position, but instead he went to Oklahoma
and got a decree of divorce against his
wi:e on the charge of cruelty and aban
donment. When ne returned to this city
his wife had him arrested in a suit which
she iustitu ed for absolute divorce.
The court holds that the divorce decree
had no validity whatever, as the Driscolls
were not residents of Oklahoma and the
courts there had no jurisdiction in the
matter.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 9.âPresi
dent McKinley started work this morning
with a clean desk. He and his clerical as
sistants were up with the mail. While at
Canton Major McKinley took time by ibe
lorelock. Every letter relating to an offi
cial subject was answered there, witn the
result that when he entered the White
House he did not have a mountain of cor
respondence to clear away.
The first regular Cabinet^meeting of the
new administration was held this morn
ing at 11 o'clock. President McKinley in
tends to keep up the practice of holding
conferences with his official advisers twice
a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, at the
hour named. Whether rainy weather was
or was not the cause of it, there was a great
lalling off in the Jorces of office-seekers

ALBANY, N. V., March 9.â The report
of the Lexow investigating cominiuee

about 10,000 words.
The testimony taken before the com

The report dwells at .'ength upon the
great danger that is likely to arise from,
the continuance of the operations of ag

Secretary Long Already Gives the Subject
Cowiidrrntion.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 9.â A Her
ald special from Washington says: Secre
tary Long has already given consideration
to several changes in station of naval
officers in high rank. The Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Depart
ment Is Rear-Admiral F. M. Ramsay, but
as that officer must retire on account of
ace on April 6, his successor must be de
cided upon within the next few weeks.
Three officer* â Cnptain Albert Kautz,
Captain R. D. Evans and Captain H. C.
Taylorâ have beeu suggested Â»or the place.
As Commodore J. N. Miller and the
new Secretary are personaJ friends, the
belief prevails that Long may ask him to
be Admiral Ramsay's successor. Commo
dore Miller wilt be promoted upon Rear-
Admiral Walker's retirement on the 20th
inst. His special ambition, however, it is
said, is to become flag officer of the North
Atlantic squadron when Admiral Bunce s
term of duty ends in June, and it is gen
erally believed that if he asks Secretary
Long to give him this assignment he will
get it.
Admiral Wulfcer's retirement on the
20th inst. will create a vacancy in the
office of the chairman of the lighthouse
board. On account of the high rank of
army officers who are members of the
board, it has been customary to assisn a
naval officer of the highest rank to till the
position. The only re ir-admiral available
for the position iÂ« Admiral Beardslee,
commanding the Pacific station, whose
tour of sea duty has long since expired.
His detachment will leave a vacancy
which will probably be filled by Commo
dore George Dewey.
Secretary Long will also make chances
in several ship commands -hortly and
also make assignments of officers to com
mand the gunboats and torpedo-boats that
will soon be ready lor Government ac
ceptance.
IX QUEST OF FILIBUSTERS.
Federal War Veaaela Purposely Placed
on ihit â  Wrong Trail.
MOBILE, Ala., March 9.â A special to
the Register from Pensacola, Fla., says:
The filibuster excitement was revived
here this morning when the cruiser
Marblehead suddenly steamed into the
harbor and came to anchor near the Mont
gomery. One of the officers came nshore,
and it was learned that she had come from
the vicinity of Appalachicola to have her
bunkers filled with coal.
It was learned that she had left an
armed launch and crew at Applacbicola
to keep watch until her return. It is an
open secret that the cars of arms and
boats that left Jackronvilie on Thursday
arrived here. The cars were open and the
contents could be easily seen. The body
of Cubans went to Appalachicola and it is
known that a customs officer has gone
from here to that port.
The fact that the arms and surf-boats
were shipped here in open cars and that
the Cubans went in broad daylight to
Appalachicola leaas the public toconlude
that the whole movement was only a
"grandstand play" to avert the attention
of the officers from some part of the coast
where operations are being carried on. In
addition to the war vessels, several men
supposed to be Pinkerton detec:ives are
here and every person who is suspected of
bsing in any way connecied with the
movement is being constantly shadowed.
Nothing has been heard from the tug
Monarch since she left the harbor on Fri
day for Sabine .Pass. The cruiser Mont
gomery has had steam up nil day but has
not yet taken on cnal. No shore leaves
were granted to officers or men and it is
impossible to learn anything of her future
movements. It is rumored to-nieht that
the battle-snips Texas and Maine will
join the Marblehead in the Gulf and that
the cruiser Kaleigh is to come here to re
lieve the Montgomery.

After Waiting Four Years the Oppor
tunity Comes to an Eastern
Syndicate.
CHICAGO, 111., March After wait
in-; moie than four years a Chicago and
Indiana syndicate which claims the' own
ership of 1,500,000 acres of land in Texas,
rich in silver and said to be worth over
$5,000,000, obtained legal services to-day
on a high official of the Clboio Creek Mill
ing and Mining Company, William Noyes
of Oakland, Cal., a capitalist and general
manager of the defendant company.
; Frederic* P. Olcott, the New York repre
sentative, and the Houston and Texas
Central Railroad are also made defend
ants. They are in possession of the dis
puted land and silver mines. â ';'
Service was obtained on Mr. Noyea un
der peculiar circumstances. He and his
wife arrived here from California last Sat
urday and were guests of the Auditorium
Hotel.
Ernest 1). Holraan and Seth F. Crews,
Chicago lawyers, who are president and
secretary, respectively, of the syndicate,
and have represented it in the legal fight,
were anxious to obtain service in the
Northern Federal District of Illinois and
.bring suit away from Texas. A similar
suit is now pending in Presidio County,
Tex., where the greater part of the prop
erty is located.
Just he fore the late Judge Gresham was
appointed Secretary of State by ex-Presi
dent Cleveland a suit in ejectment was
brought by the syndicate in this Federal
district, but Judge Gresham refused to
allow the case to be tried, because service
was not had on any officer of the company
in Illinois.
The syndicate's opportunity came last
night. Lawyer Owen went to the opera
at the Auditorium. While surveying the
audience between acts his Heart almost
jumped in his mouth at sight of General
Manager Noyes and Mrs. Noyes. Owen
quickly chane -<1 seats for a more secluded
spot where Mr. Noyes could not see him,
and after the opera the lawyer shadowed
the California capitalist to the Annex, via
the tunnel route across the street. As
soon as possible th s morning a suit in
ejectment, claiming $500,000dameges, was
hied in the United States Circuit Court
and suppressed for service, and in the
State court two suits for trespass, claim
ing $2,000,000 damages, were Hied. After
waiting at the hotel for hours Deputy
United States Marshal A lien was rewarded
by seeing the papers on Mr. Noyes served.
The iand was granted in 1834 by the
Mexican Government 10 Jose lgnace Vig
necinquilloforseiv.ee in the army, but
he never settled on it. His heirs claimed
the land wiihout question, and after the
annexation of Texas by the United States
part of the land passed into the possession
of the Houston and Texas Central Rail
road. Another part was bought with
scrip and is now claimed by Mr. Olcoit,
who leaned it to the Cibolo Company. The
railroad's part was bought by the same
company. Five years ago the Vignecon
quillo erant was bought from his heirs by
ihfi syndicate comprising forty prominent
men. Atiorney Owen said they had been
offered millions of dollars for their claim
alone. Two silver mines, the Presidio and
Cibolo, which have yielded as hig*j as
$2,000,000 of silver a year, are located on
the property.

THE ARMY TELEGRAPH.
The Same Wire Can Be Used for Tele
phoning or Telegraphing.
The imperative need of the army of the
United States of electrical communication
bas been strikingly demonstrated in the
great value which the present system bas
proved itself to be within the last year,
says the New York Herald. There are
to-day 7SO miles of permanent military
telegraph lines in this country, all oper
ated by the Government Signal Corps.
There has been a notable advance in the
development of the combined telegraph
and telephone apparatus in use. In fact,
it is now possible for an operator to carry
in his hand a teiegraph and telephone
office combined. While one soldier is tele
graphing a message in Morse character,
another soldier may talk over the same
wire telephomcally with another station,
ana each of the receiving operators will
hear only his own message.
A curious fact in connection with tna
Government telegraph lines is that it has
been found necessary to make the testing
boxes, which are located about ten miles
apart, castiron and bullet-proof. This is
because of the fondness of the cowpuucher
for shooting off the insulators and various
portions of the testboxes. Although such
incidents occur at very frequent intervals,
so carefully are the Government systems
in the West watched that interruptions
<ire quickly repaired, so quickly that loss
of time practically amounts to nothing.
Here is a field also in which tue bicycle
plays an important part, for it is by aid of
the wheel that the breaks nre so quickly
located ana such good time made from
the stations to them, far less than would
be the result even if the hnemau rode a
horse. .
While the permanent telegraph lines
ui.der the control of the chief signal officer
ot the army were originally constructed
purely for military services they subserve
large commercial interests. The tariff
charge for messages averages about fifteen
cents for ten woids. The number of mes
sages transmitted over the Government
wires, con^sting of Government, state
and other business, aggregated 57,949, and
these figures only indicate the business
transacted on lines handling paid com
mercial messages.
The number of messages affords bnt a
slight idea of the amount of business
transacted, for tlie reason that a message
may contain only two words, or, on the
other hand, it may contain several han
dred. From a local and a military point
of view the importance of military lines
is very great. Not only do tuey increase
and subserve the economical interests of
the Government, but they are of inestima
ble value to commercial interests.
The most notable advance made during
the year in military telegraphy is the
combined telegraph and telephone appa
ratus referred to. The whale outfit weighs
sixteen pounds, including battery enough
to work over any field line which the corps
might be called on to operate. The im
portance of this means 01 communication
was practically demonstrated on the mili
tary cable between Angel Island and
Tiburon, Cal., when a complete interrup
tion of communication by the grounding
of each of the three conductors of the cable
was reported. This grounding was so
complete that a telegraph instrument
w ith a battery was worked between any

A firm resolve 13 manifested in Govern
ment quarters to adhere fixedly to the
policy of coercion toward Greece should
the Greek policy necessitate such a course.
It is stated here that the admirals com
manding the foreign fleets in Cretan

fire upon any Greek torpedo boat that ap
proaches the foreign warships.
LONDON, Eng., March 9.â The Chroni- j

from Athens saying that the kernel of trie |
situation is that Russia is pursuing Greece
with a terrible vindictiveness that it is im
possible to explain. It is stated, however,
-that Russia realizes that millions of Greek
Christians in the East yield allegiance
only to the Greek patriarch at Constanti- I
nople, which is a serious bar to Russia's j
plans. M. Muravieff. the Russian Foreign ;
Minister, is anxious to remove this bar by j
humiliating Greece and destroying her in- j
fluence with the patriarch.
The correspondent of the Standard tele

inefficiency is now admitted by the issu- |

the present in the Golden Horn.
As the House of Commons was on the
point of adjourning this evening Sir Wil
liam Vernon Harcourt, the leader of the i
Liberal party, aro-o and, while disavow- j
ing any desire to embarrass the Govern- \
men; in the negotiations nece?sarily aris
ing from Greece's reply, said he desired an
as urance that the British forces should
not be employed against Greece before
Parliament was given a chance to express
its judgment on the- matter. (Opposition
cheers). j
.Continuing, Sir William said that he 1
btheved that a situation had arisen in J
%Â£. ; .eh an amicable settlement of the ques- !
tion was possible. He was confident that
the Government would do its best to se- |
cure such a settlement. He did not base
his request on constitutional right, but
on a policy of the higher description, j
really involving the issues of peace or I
war.
Mr. Arthur Balfour, the Government!
leader, in reply to Sir William, said that !
the course demanded by the opposition j
was extremely inexpedient and absolutely j
contrary so precedent. The Government, j
he added, could not be guided by the |
practice of France, to which Sir William j
had leferred. He recalled the bombard- ;
ment of Alexandria in 1882, and the |
blockade of Greece in 1886 when Sir Wil- :
liam was a member 01 the Government, j
He could not believe that any stronger j
action and hoped that nothing as stroug
was now likely, but in neither case to
which he referred had any notice been
iiven to Parliament beforehand. The j
G .vernment was most anxiously desirous j
ot an amicable settlement. It was in j
every way conscious of its responsibility
and was acting in the firm belief that it
was pursuing a policy that would bring
liberty to Crete and preserve the peace of
Europe. It wa"B not prepared to imperil
either by a pledge which might hamper
its action at a critical moment.
In reply to a question asked by Sir
Charles Dilke, Mr. Baltour said that he |
did not think that the negotiations now
in progress would be terminated by

â day, as had been promised by M. Hano

The Westminster Gazette publishes a
dispatch from Canea, Crete, saying that
the Greeks have been ordered by the com

to force, which, the dispatch adds, will be
employed by the powers if necessary to
compel obedience to the order.
A dispatch from Candida, Crete, under
yesterday's date, says: A large number

almost hourly occurrence. Out of 165

person, a child, escaped slaughter.
PARIS, France, March 9.â ln the
Chamber of Deputies to-day M. Millerand,
Socialist, train interpellated thn Govern
ment regarding the Cretan question and
lie action to be taken by France in view
of the refusal of Greece to heed the ulti
matum of the powers. Prime Minister
Meline and M. Hanotaux, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, asked that the considera
tion of the subject be deferred until
, Thursday, and this was agreed to by the
Chamber by a vote of 342 to 203.
â  VIENNA,- Austria, March & â The
Greek reply to the identical note of the
six great powers has been received at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where it has
been most carefully considered. It is not
considered at all satisfactory, as it is
evasive, Greece apparently being desirous
of dodging the very points upon which
the identical note was based.
ROME. Italy, March 9.â The Italian
Cabinet mci this forenoon and discussed
thj reply of Greece. The result was a
communication wired to each of the great
powers saying that in Italy's opinion the
powers were still out of accord as to the
method of coercion which should be di
rected against Greece, and that nothing
should be done until the question be
settled.
It is stated that the Cabinet, although
hoping that a peaceful solution of the
question would be arrived at, decided not
10 abstain from taking part in the co
ercion of Greece if the other powers were
unanimous on ihis point.
CANEA, Cbbtk, March 9.â M. Baraklis,
the Greek Vic<;-Consul ; the staff of the
Consulate and a number of Greek news
paper reporter embarked upon a vessel
this afternoon to return to Greece, Ad
miral Canevaro insisting that his order
that thej' leave the island must be obeyed.
Major Bor, the British officer who was
recently appointed to the command of
the international gendarmerie, has refused
to disband the forces at the bidding ot the
international command. He declares that
lie will not abandon his post umii or
dered by the Sultan to do so.
The fight at Afcroti ceased to-day, the
insurgents abandoned carrying the posi
tion, owing to their fears that they would
again be bombarded by the foreign war
ships.
The stories of massacres of Mussulmans
at Siiia cannot be confirmed; though it
has been emphatically denied several
times, it was repeated again to-day, with
the addition that the Consuls at Herak
lion had been convinced by witnesses that
400 Moslems were Killed in the village in
the vicinity of Sitia. It was first stated
that. 2000 Mussulmans had been massacred
in Sitia.
Tne contemplated disbanding of the in
ternational gendarmerie causes-uneasiness
here, as it will leave the city at the mercy
of the unpaid Mussulman eendarmes. Ac
cording to a Turkish report six Moslems
were killed and eight wounded in the
fighting at Akrotiri.
Advices from Hararpitra says that Mus
sulmar.s in possession of that town were
summoned to surrender by the Christian
insurgents who were surrounding the
town and thai the Mussulmans refused to
do so. The insurgents then fired a volley
into the fort, which was held by the Mos
lems, when an Italian cruiser lying off the
town fired upon me insurgents, compel
ling them to ref.re. A Turkish transport
with Turkisli civil officers and soldiers on
board arrived here from Kastell to-day,
but was refused a pilot to bring her into
the harbor, owing to the fact of her hav
smallpox on boarJ.
Advices received from Retirno, on the
north coast some thirty miles southeast of
here, show that the pillaging of the bouses
and shops of the Christians there ii still
going on. The Vice-Consuls stationed at
Retimo have asked the Consuls here that
protection be afforded the Christians.
In Canea it is snid there has been rob
bery of houses owned by Christians who
are absent from the city. This pillaging
is not the work of the Moslem inhabitants,
but is done by the Turkish soldiers. Pro
tests have been made to the acting Gov
ernor, but no satisfaction was obtained, he
saying that the robberies cannot be helped
as the Turkish soldiers have to pillage to
live.
Tewfik Pasha, the Military Governor,
has sent to Heraklion for another battalion
of troops, which will make the condition
of affairs worse than ever.
CANEA, Crete, March 9.â The situa
tion at Akrotiri is similar to the condition
of affairs which prevailed there two weeks
ago, but the warships are very unwilling
to fire upon the Christians. Each side
accuses the other of beginning the com
bat. The truth seems to be that the in
surgents began to advance upon the town
an 1 thÂ«j Turks began to fire upon them.
The result of the mission of Sir Alfred
Biolitti, the British Consul here, in behalf
of the beseiged Moslems at Cnndamos, is
as yet unknown, although yesterday it
was stated that it had failed. When he
arrived at Selino he communicated with
the insurgent chiefs, who at first refused
to meet him, but upon learning that it
was proposed by the powers to grant
autonomy to the island, they eventually
invited him to a conference.
It is understood that 570 men from the
British warships Rodney and Scout, and
the ships of other nations are escorting
Sir Alfred, who started for Candamos yes
terday morning.
ATHENS, Greece, March 9. â Nea

MIDNIGHT TRAIN ROBBERY.
Masked Men Hold Up the Louisville and
Nashville Fast Mail and Secure
About $10,000.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 10.â
Louisville and Nashville northbound
fast mail 4 was held up by six masked
men three miles this side of Calera about
11:15 o'clock.
The train had just left the tank and
was on time. The engineer was ordered
to halt his train by two men on the plat
form of the mail coach.
Two ugly pistols added emphasis to the
order. Ha obeyed. He slopped the train
and was ordered down from the cab and
made to cut loose tho air, which ha did
promptly. He was then made to go with
the men to the express car. Tne only oc
cupant was H. W. Gordon, who was made
to open the doors. One of the men went
inside and secured a number of valuable
packages, the contents of which are not
known to-night.
The men then accompanied the en
gineer back to the engine, after he had
readjusted the air. He was then ordered
to pull out. which he did. The paisengers
were not disturbed. Sheriff O'Brien and
five deputies, with horses and dogs, left
on a special for the scene.
It is rumored that the robbers secured
about $10,000. The facts are so meager
and the railroad officials so reticent that
it is impossible to substantiate the report
at this hour.

Ihe Actor Sued' by a young Man Who
Claim* to Be lUtt Sont
CHICAGO, 111., March 9.â A mysterious
suit which was tiled against James O'Neill,
the actor, late Saturday, and suppressed
for service, was disclosed to-day.
Two suits were begun in the Circuit
Court by Alfred Hamilton O'Neill, who
claims to be the son of the defendant.
One of the bills is for the purpose of per
petuating testimony in regard to the
divorce suit, which was tried some years
njto, and in connection with this suit
O'Neill brings suit for $20,000 damages.
The complainant's lawyers admitted
to-day that the damage suit was baaed on
the allegations set forth in the suppressed
bill, which alleges that the actor and tha
mother of thra complainant, who v not
mentioned by name, were married in
187 L when she was 15 years old; that in
1873 James O'Neill deserted his wife, and
in 1877 she filed a bill for divorce o.i the
ground of desertion.
The defendant, it is alleged, by adroit
counsel and by false pretenses and prom
ises and by threats of various sorts,
worked most outrageous fraud on the
court, and that the defendant procured a
decree to be entered finding that no mar
riage ever existed and having her bill dis
missed.
Young O'Neill now asks that this decree
be set aside, that his parenta c be estab
lished, that the defendant be restrained
from leaving the jurisdiction of the court,
and also for the appointment of a re
ceiver. The actor was served with process
before leaving the city.

WANTS THE TREATY RATIFIED.*
President Favors Arbitration, Not Only
With England, but With O.her
European Powers.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 9.â A Herald
special from Washington says: President
McKinley is emphasizing his earnest de
sire for the prompt ratification of the gen
eral arbitration treaty by personal appeals
to his friends in the Senate.
It is understood that to Chairman Davis
of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen
ator Cullom and to others who have called
President McKinley has manifested the
greatest interest in the treaty and urged
them to use their best efforts to secure its
prompt ratification in practically the same
shape it was sent to the Senate.
President McKinley, it is said, thinks so
well of the good work accomplished by
Secretary Olney and Sir Julian Pauncefote
that he stands ready and willing to be
g'.n negotiations for similar treaties with
other European powers.
Since McKinley has declared himself so
strongly in favor of the treaty In its origi
nal form many Republican Senators who
before favored radical amendments now
incline, for the sake of harmony with the
administration, to stand by the original
instrument, with perhaps some slight
modifications.
Senator Davis, the new chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, is dis
posed to yield to the President's wishes
on nearly all points except the one nam
ing King Oscar as tne sovereign to select
the tinal umpire. It is understood that
he and other Republican members of the
committee will insist on striking out the
clause.
The chief opposition to the treaty as a
whole will come from Senators Morgan
and Daniel, both of whom stand ready to
resort to dilatory tactics to prevent its rat
ification iv the form in which" it was
drawn and as it is now indorsed by the
new administration.

PARTY DIVIDED
AGAINST ITSELF
Fruitless Caucus of Demo
cratic Members of the
Senate.
Plots to Capture the Organiza
tion of That Body C.me
to Naught.
Republicans, on the Other Hand, Are
United, but L?ck a Working
M JDrity.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 9.â For
more than two hours to-day the Demo
cratic members of the Senate endeavored
to reach some conclusion on the question
of the organization of the Senate. Like
the Republican conference of Friday it
was fruitless In results. The two factions
are arrayed against each other. On the
one hand the Republicans present a solid
phalanx of forty-two votes that will stand
by each other through thick and thin; on
the other there are the divided ranks of
the goid standard Democrats, silver Dem
ocrats, bolting silver Republicans and
Populists.
The problem before those seeking to
take the control of the Senate from the Re.
publicans is, How can these various fac
tions be solidified and made one in inter
est? No satisfactory answer to this ques
tion has been proposes, and the more the
discussion proceeds the less appears to be
the chance of definite action, by reason of
the inability of the seceding factions to
cohere into one determined party of oppo
sition.
Caucuses and conferences have been
numerous since the new Senate convened.
The Populists, whiJe holding no lormal
caucus, have agreed among themselves
that they will support any plan that may
be indorsed by the Democrats. So, too.
the silver Republicansâ those who bolted
the St. Louis platformâ have agreed to
stand by whatever policy may be inaug
urated by the stronger of the oodies in
opposition to the element now in control
of the Senate committees.
When the Democratic caucus was called
for to-day there was no distinction made
between the men who indorsed the Chi
cago ticket and those who stood upon the
Indianapolis platform. Nonces of the
caucus were sent to every Democrat. Of
the gold men only Lindsay of Kentucky
attended. Gray of Delaware and Caffery
of Louisiana weie absent. The absence of
Gray is not looked upon as significant, for
the reason that whenever the Senate ad
journs over he always runs up to his home
ior the few days at his disposal. Caffery,
the second absen lee, was the permanent
chairman of, the Indianapolis convention
and his absence may have some political
significance.
The situation was discussed in a rather
informal manner, and the only result
reached was the appointment of the old
iteerin : committee, witn Faulkner of
West Virginia anrt Smith of New Jersey
substituted for Brice and Blackburn,
whose terms expired last Tuursday.
The effort to take the committees from
the Republicans is antagonized by some
leading Democrats for various reasons.
Gorman thinks the scheme to consolidate
all the factions in the Senate by a com
bination with the silver Republicans and
the Populists would be dangerous and
would result in the establishment of a
precedent that might prove embarrassing
in the future.
Jones of Arkansas, chairman of the
National Committee, is said to be opposed
to it because the Democrats have not suffi
cient votes with those of their allies to do
what is proposed to be done. This con
clusion is based upon the assumption that
Lindsay of Kentucky, Gray of Delaware
and Caffery of Louisiana, each of whom
supported the Indianapolis tickets, are
not Democrats.
Jones is suppoited by several of the
more radical silver men, who thus hope
to emphasize their disapproval of the
course of thesn Senators. These same
men also appreciate the fact that if they
had possession of the committees they
would be handicapped by the Republican
House and the Republican President and
would be unable to consummate any of
their own plans of legislation.
Tne result of the two hours' talk, there
fore, was concentrated on the appoint
ment of the committee mentioned,
and this committee will confer with the
other factions and possibly with the Re
publican .steering committee announced
to-Uoy by Chairman Allison.
The Republicuns do not expect any
serious result from all the tslk of setting
aside the present organization of the
committee. They have so far failed to see
just how the opposing elements in the
HIS GOOD FORTUNE.
JOSEPH DE RICHMOND IS NO LONGER A GRIPMAN ON THE HAIGHT
" street line. He is now on his way to the south of France. His uncle has ju>t left
him a Â«nug fortune, so De Richmond goes to France. Before he left he told the writer
wftat he thought of the vegetable preparation grown in California called Joy's Vege-
table Snrsaparilla.
Said he: "A man on the cable-cars has to be out in all sorts of weather, and he
needs a fairly good constitution with which to battle life. If he is at all disposed to
kidney complaint he may as well get off the cars right away, for it is only a small
matter of time and he is off anyway. Well, sir, I had a pretty good scare myself. I
began to feel kind of queer, would get smothering sensations, and as soon as I put
food in my stomach it would bloat and then I would be uneasy all the rest of the day.
"I consulted a doctor and he told me I was suffering from dyspepsia. I used his
medicine about two months and I was constantly getting worse. I thought this thing
was surely going to be serious. A fellow-gripman told mo to get a bottle uf Joy's
Vegetable Sarsapanlla. Why, l laughed at him. Get a bottle of that advertised
stuffâ not on your life!> Well, sir, he told me that this Sarsaparilla was just the thing
for dyspepsia, so at last I gave in and went for a bottle. I went to a corner drugstore
and the fellow sized me up wrongâ he started in to string me; he wanted me to take
something in place of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilia. I got hot in the collar and left
his substituting store, and I went to a respectable drugstore and got a bottle of Joy's.
'â It was no good for a weetc. I didn't feel any relief, oniy my bowels were kind
of more regular. After the second week I began to feel like my old self again. Yes,
you may say, young fellow, that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is a fine medicine.
What! Did I get any pimples or sores on my face? No, sir. I never got a pimple on
i my lace or a sore, either."
Senate will be able to agree upon a plan of
action.
At the same time the Republicans
realize their impotence, not baring
more than forty-two votes, and with little
hope of havingthe two Senators appointed
from Kentucky and Oregon seated. They
also believe that vacancies in the various
Committees will be filled by agreement be
tween the Republicans and Democrats,
and until such agreement is readied it h
very certain the vacancies wiil not b. j
tilled.
It cannot be verified, but it is stated
to-night with much positiveness that

CUBA LOST TO SPAIN.
Sinews of War Wnl Soon Be Exhausted
and Two Home Revolut.ons Are
Threatened.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 10. -The
Sun's correspondent in Havana sends the
following:
In the month of May Spain's sinews of
war will be exhausted, and the Spanish
Government, confronted by the two
threatening revolutions at horne â one by
the Carlists and the other by the Repub
licans â will be obliged to give up the
struggle in Cuba, abandoning the island
to the insurgents.
Such, at least, is the substance of al! the
news and opinion received here from
Madrid in private letters to leading Span
iards who have important relations with
the' court. Senor Romero Robledo, who
wrote one of the letter?, says that the sit
uation, in his opinion, id extremely crit
ical.
General Martinez Campos says in an
other letter that the Cubans are now
stronger than ever, and thut to crush the
revolution Spain needs to make three
times as great an effort now as three
years ago, which means 600,000 men and
$300,000,000. Can such an effort be made?
Martinez Campos says that the answer
wili be given by tnose who know the real
situation in Spain. "For reforms cr home
rule," he adds, "it is too late."
All the officers in the Spanish army now
! in Cuba who belonged to the Cariist army
during the last war in the peninsula have
receive! secret advices Irom the agents of
Don Carlos that their military rank will
be recognized by "The King," and they
will receive promotion in case they return
to the service of "their rightful sover
eign."
From reliable sources the correspondent
is abl-e to say that the agents of Don Car
los are working with great energy in Cuba
among the old Cariist element. A scheme
for a general uprising in the peninsula
was planned a few months ago, and was
ready to be carried out when Don Carlos'
daughter ran away with a married man in
j Italy.
Thij incident from a royal point of
view worked much injury tor a time to tlie
Cariist cause and it was decided to wait
a few more months. Now the time is con
sidered ripe and Spain will probably be
come once more the scene of a civil war.
In consequence of this critical condition
of affairs liie Central Government has
notiiied General Weyler that he must ex
pect no more re-enforcements from Spain.
Moreover, no more money is to be ex
pected for Cuba after May 1, because the
Government has to attend also to ttie war
in the Philippines and to the course of
events at home,
NEW YORK, N. V., March 9.â A
World special from Washington says:
Secretary Sherman has cabled Consul-
General Lee that every reasonable de
mand or request he may moke of the
Spanish authorities in Cuba will ba sup-
Dorted by the power of the United States
Government.
The first dispatch received by the new
Secretary of State from General Lee, out
side of the ordinary routine, came yester
day. It was simple and brief, asking what
he could do in the way of being relieved
of further service at Havana, and calling
attention to a desire expressed that he
might be permitted to return home.
Senator Sherman took the dispatch to
the Executive mansion, afterward cabling
to General Lee requesting him to continue
at his post, stating that no one has been
selected as his successor and it would bs
inconvenient to consider that matter for
some time. He was assured of fair treat
ment by the new administration and told
that his remaining as Consul-General
would be regarded by the President as a
personal favor.
For Ansixtant Secretary of the Xary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 9.-Rear-
Admirai WalKer, who will reach the re
tiring age on ths 20;h of March, is spoken
of for the position of Assistant Secretary
of the Navy. Mr. McAdoo, it is stated,
has been requested to act until his suc
cessor qualities and has consented to do so.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
WEDNESDAY MARCH 10, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
46 XS3 inches
of advertisements, which is
224 inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
Read "The Hypocrite Unmasked. 1
â  The lying Examiner stands "convicted."
Well done, Morebouse. The people are
with you.
Â«
Whoever patronizes the Examiner pa
tronizes a convict sheet.
Their names hereafter are Long Green
Lawrence and Scab Hearst.
For about 3 cents a pound on twine,
Willie, the scab, betrays free labor.
â¦
It is logical that the Examiner should
patronize convicts, since it helps to make
them.
Senator Morehouje needs no defense,
but will have it. The Examiner needs,
hut won't get it.
Is Willie Hearst so near the end of his
father's fortune that he cannot buy twine
in the open market?
The Call is friendly to labor and re
joices in the proofs just given that labor
is friendly to The Call.
Our story of the great twine deal at San
Quentin is not copyrighted. The faker
may copy it if it pleases.
Any man who wishes to work for the
Examiner can do so by getting himself
sentenced to San Quentin.
When the hypocrite clamors for the
building up of home industries it means
an extension of the State prison system. â¢-â¢â¢
*
The hypocrite fawns on workinemen to
get their money, but when the hypocrite
has to buy anything he buys it at San
Quentin.
The Legislature will not permit the
snaky journal to squirm away, nor will
the peoDle. Everybody understands the
situation.
The Examiner gang prate of their devo
tion to free union labor,, but their hearts
and their purses twine round the State
prison convicts.
Absentee Hearst and Long Green
Lawrence have as much fellow feeling for
convicts as if they expected to join the
gang themselves some Cay.
Sending Long Green Lawrence to San
Quentin wouldn't hurt Willie Hearst.
The absentee faker is as willing to have
his work done there as in the Examiner
office.
Absentee Hearst spares a little money
for expenditure in California, but not
enough to maintain his fake paper by free
labor, so it goes to State prisons where
goods are cheap.
Free union labor goes unemployed' in
this City while the Examiner saves money
by buying twine made by the forced labor
of convicts in the State prison. It is in this
way the faker shows its friendliness for
workingmen.
The labor unions which were induced
by misleading statements to adopt resolu
tions against The Call have rescinded
them. Will the Examiner now get the
State prison authorities to rescind the
twine contract? â¢
No one can tell how sad Willie Hearst
is over the fact that he cannot get his
printing done by convicts instead of free
la-bor. He sighs for the , day when there
shall be type-setting machines in â  every
State prison and a system of paper
making by convicts. ? '
We publish this morning an uncopy
rig.ted editorial of the Examiner denounc
ing the use of convict labor, and adjoin
ing it we publish also an uncopyrighted
account of the. Examiner's bill with the
State prison for twine. Compare the two
and make your own comments.
By purchasing twine from State prisons
where it is made by convicts, instead of
buying it in the market of free labor,
Willie Hearst saves money just as he
saves it by publishing fakes instead of
legitimate news. As the money thus
saved is necessary to sustain a little longer
his rapidly vanishing fortune, and as no
further subsidies from the Southern Pa
cific are obtainable, he has some excuse
for such economies, but he should not lie
about them. There is no excuse for being
a hypocrite to free labor while patronizing
convicts. - â 
In promptly rescinding tbe resolutions
against The Call, which were adopted
under a misapprehension of the truth, the
members of the labor unions which
adopted them have acted with a manly
and honorable vigor which is in tbe high
est degree commendable. Every man and
every organizalion is liable to error, bat
there are not many that have the courage
and the honesty to acknowledge it and
correct the wrong. What has been done
by the unions in this instance is an evi
dence of a genuine manliness of character,
and cannpt fail to raise the members of
these unions in the esteem of ail citizens.
THE HYPOCRITE UNMASKED.
We have repeatedly of late had occasion in the interests of public Information to
expose tbe falseness of the fakes wbicb. the Examiner passes off upon its readers for
news; in the interests of decency and morality we have exposed its vile and vicious
illustrations of crime and obscenity; this morning in the interest of free labor we
expose its hypocrisy in posing as the friend of workingmen while at the same timo
purchasing supplies from the State prison at San Quentin.
The waste of money and the daily loss attendant upon the publication of the fake
journal may have reduced the wasteful Hearst to a condition where he can no longer
afford to purchase poods made by free labor and sold in the open market. The excuse
of poverty, loss, distress and threatened ruin may be pleaded therefore as some
extenuation of the act itself ; but what can be advanced for tbe hypocrisy, the fraud
and the persistent lying with, which the purchases from San Quentin have been
covered ?
The Examiner saves money by purchasing twine from San Quentin in exactly the
same way that it saves money by fakes instead of paying for legitimate news. It has
a right to do this if poverty and not an intentional meanness compels it. It has no
right, however, while purchasing tbe products of prison labor to denounce others for
following its example. We publish this morning an editorial of the Examiner declar
ing against the use of prison labor by contractors in this City, and in another column
we show that the Examiner is itself using the products of prison labor. The exposure
of the hypocrite is complete. The liar is confronted with the evidence of his lie, and
it will be impossible for him to squirm out of the corner to which he has been forced.
The attention of members of labor unions is called to this revelation of the hypo
crisy of their pretended friend. There has been some discussion of late in this City
as to who were the true friends of labor, and the Examiner has through its agents by
false statements and deliberate lies endeavored to arouse among tbe members of
organized labor an antagonism to The Call. We now publish the Examiner's record
on the subject In our statements there is nothing misrepresented. The evidence
was obtained from the State prison, and the representatives of labor onions can
verify it if they wish.
Whoever patronizes the Examiner is to some extent a patron of convict labor.
There are at this time numbers of men and women in this City seeking employment.
While they are in distress the absentee Hearst, reputed to be a millionaire, extends
his patronage to convicts rather than to free labor. Comment is unnecessary. "We
leave the subject to those who have to live by daily wages and who are therefore
vitally interested in the action of the Examiner in conducting a paper upon convict
labor instead of the labor of free mea.
SENATOR MOREHOUSE.
The people of the State of California owe to Senator Morehouse no slight obliga
tion for his courage and his public spirit in bringing the vicious, libelous and
malignant Examiner to the pillory of justice for its offense in slandering the State
Legislature, and charging that the passage of a bill, in the defeat of which the Exam
iner was interested, was due "to bribery in aid of thievery."
It is not a pleasant task, nor one agreeable to men of clean habits and honest
minds, to grapple with a journal so foul, bo unscrupulous, so vindictive, so malicious,
so false, so impudent, so shameless, so brazen and so disreputable as the San Francisco
Examiner. With no character of his own to lose. Long Green Lawrence, who directs
that paper for the absentee Hearst, balks at nothing which malice can prompt, cun
ning devise or Jying tongue utter to defame any one who opposes' measures in wnlcb
he has an interest. Senator Morehouse has had the courage to face all the slanders
and all the vileness of the vicious gang which the Examiner employs, and he has done
this not in his own behalf, but to render the Stato a service and to maintain and pro
tect the character and good repute of the Senate.
The duty which the Legislature and the people generally owe to Senator More
bouse is that of sustaining him in the course which he has taken. 'l ac E.iaminer
should not be permitted to squirm away from the position which it took of its own
will. It charced, in direct and unequivocal terms, 'hat money had been employed to
pass Assembly bill 273. It asserted the amounts paid to Senators and to Assembly
men. It declared that it had a knowledge of this bribery. It aspersed, in the first
place, every man who voted for the bill in either House. It denounced them as
boodlers and bribe-takers. It sent abroad to the world a report, specific and definite,
that the legislators of California were corrupt to the core.
Having been called upon to prove the charges made Long Green Lawrence,
who acts for the absentee Hearst, has endeavored by every trick his cowardly cun
ning could devise to avoid answering. After publishing the statement that Ssnators
and Assemblymen had taken bribes he now slinks away from the demand that he
give his reasons for making the charge by declaring that it wouid be a breach of con
fidence to do so. He claims to have received the information of bribery as "a privi
leged communication," and does not pretend to have investigated it or to have ob
tained any evidence whatever to sustain it.
Caught in a corner this man Lawrence, who stands charged and accused with all
sorts of offenses â from attempts to extort money to obtain the passage of a bill
through a former Legislature down to fixing a referee to give a foul judgment in a
prize-fight â seeks to shift popular attention from himself by defiling and defaming
others. It goes without saying that he will not be allowed to do so. The people un
derstana the situation. The Legislature will do its duty. Tne Examiner will be
branded as a lying journal. Long Green Lawrence will be branded as a notorious
slanderer, while Senator Morehouse, for his courage in defending the honor of the
Legislature and the reputation of the Btate, will receive from his constituents and
from the people at large the greeting of commendation and approval which he mtrits.
FRIENDLY TO "THE CALL."
It was in the highest degree gratifying to The Call to be able to publish yester
day the announcement that the Examiner's reported discontent of labor unions with
The Call was wholly unfounded. The Call holds organized labor in such high
esteem tnat it accepts every evidence of friendliness on the part of the unions as a
compliment of which it may be justly proud.
It will be remembered that Carpenters' and Joiners' Union No. 304, acting upon
certain statements which were made to it, passed resolutions adverse to The Call.
The union afterward investigated these statements ana, as was stated by William
Jilge, president of the union, in a letter to The Call, which we published yesterday,
the union learned "that the statements made were unwarranted and misleading."
The former resolutions were therefore rescinded.
It was further reported by the Examiner that the Paper-hangers' Union had passed
resolutions against The Call, but L. F. Danforth, president of the union, in a letter
to ThÂ« Call published yesterday, declared "there never has been a meeting of this
body at which such resolutions passed, nor any resolutions condemning The Call."
The president added, "No one is authorized by the Paper-hangers' and Decorators'
Union to use its name for the purpose of injuring persons or businesses to gratify
personal spite."
In addition to declaring the former resolutions rescinded, President Jilge of Car
penters' Union No. 304 declared "The Call has always been fair and impartial in its
dealings with labor unions and workingraen." President Danfortb, after denying
that the resolutions reported had ever been passed, declared The Call is a paper
'{which in the past has shown a manifest friendship for the working classes and or
ganized labor."
The statements made by these two representatives of organized labor in this City
are true. The Call has ever been the friend of all workingmen, and has been In an
especial sense the champion of organized unions. So it has Deen in the past, so it is
now, and so it will ever be. We are grateful for the recognition which has been given to
our consistent attitude toward the workingmen, as well as to ail other citizens of
California. The Call sueaks for allâ for the whole State, witbout regard to sections,
and for all the people who labor to build it up.
The malicious lying of the Examiner has had these good effectsâ it has made evi
dent the friendliness of The Call to organized labor and has brought forth these pub
lic testimonials of the recognition of it by tbe labor unions.
A NEEDED AMENDMENT.
The proposed constitutional amendment
which provides that the "county offices"
in a consolidated city and county shall be
brought within the scope of a freeholders'
charter in absolutely essential to any at
tempt at establishing a sytematicand well
ordered local^ government for San Fran
cisco. Ever since the Supreme Court de
cideJ that San Francisco Is not s truly
consolidated community, so far as its gov
ernment goes, but is partly a county and
partly a city, it has been impossible to
understand clearly under what terms the
so-called cDunty officers hold.
San Francisco requires a new charter,
and in tbe course of events will inevitably
have one. Provision should be made,
therefore, as speedily as possible, to en
able the people, when adopting such a
charter, to arrange for all the officials of
the incorporated community. In other
words, San Francisco should be one
thing, and not two things. The charter
under which its local government is to be
conducted siiould cover alt departments
of that government. The proposed
amendment should by ail means be adopt
ed. It is not only a proposed advantage
to the City, but an imperative necessity.
Even the subsidy obtained from the
Southern Pacific Company by the faking
boodler went to convicts instead of fret*
labor. The twine deal has been going on
a long time.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 1897.
THE FEDERAL BUILDING.
The California deiegition in Congress
owes to the people of this City some ex
planation or at least some statement of
what is bsing done at Washington to ad
vunce the beginning of the work on the
FeJeral building.
The people are asking for news about
the work. What has Senator White done,
the senior Senator of the State? What
has Senator Perkins done, who represents
the Republicanism of California, and is
therefore a representative of the adminis
tration? What has baen done by Con
pressman Maguire, who poses as the
fifend of workingmen in this City? What
has been done by Congressman Loud, who
as a Republican of long service in the
House cannot fail to have influence with
the new administration?
San Francisco needs the new builainjr.
Her workingmen need the employment
its construction would give and the wages
that would be paid for the work. At the
prtgent time it has become a serious
problem how we can bess provide wages
for willing workmen and profitable em
ployment for industry. It is natural,
therefore, that the people should recall
the fact that an appropriation has been
made for this building and persistently
ask why work is not begun.
Whatever could be done here to
further the work has been done. The
agitatioa of The Call on tbe subject has
betn respond*! 10 by all the industrial
and commercial bodies of the City. An
urgent petition has been forwarded to
Washington requesting the officials to
begin the work, and an earnest demand
has been made upon all members of the
California delegation to advance it by
every means in their power.
Tde people expect from Washington
some reply to this petition and request.
They wish to know what is being done.
They desire some evidence that our Sena
tors and Representatives are giving due
attention to the enterprise and are push
ing it forward as rapidly as possible.
THE EUBOFEAN CRISIS.
The reply of the Greek Government to
the ultimatum of tbe great powers gives
promise of a temporary arrangement by
peaceful means of the situation in
the Levant. Nevertheless tbe affairs
of Greece and Crete undoubtedly con
stitute a serious crisis in Europe.
Despite the desire of the statesmen of tbe
great nations for peace, despite tbe im
perative necessity of maintaining it in the
interests of industry and commerce, and
despite all the influence of conservative
men on the side of peace, there is danger
that war may be forced upon the people of
that continent before the close of spring.
It is an old and oft-repeated, saying that
unsettled issues have no respect for the
repose of nations. Between the Greeks
and the Turks there are unsettled issues,
and they have now produced In both coun
tries such Spirit of mutual antagonism
as can hardly be allayed by any diplomacy
however wise or coerced by any display of
force however great. Europe may talk of
peace, but between the Greeks and the
Turks war has already been betcuu and the
end of it cannot be foreseen.
The conditions are such that the states
men of Greece and of Turkey cannot hold
the people in restraint. Before the pres
ent family ascended the throne of Greece
the Greeks were ruled by a King chosen
from among the Princes of Bavaria. His
policy was not in accord with the popular
will and he was expelled from the throne.
The present X ng H wise enough to profit
by that exampb. He knowa that he must
act in accordance with the will of the
Greeks or abdicate. It was therefore no
idle saying on the part of King George
that he would rather die on thÂ« battle
field than to die an exile. That is the
exact choice belore him. IK- must either
tight or resign.
The circumstances which surround the
Sultan are not widely different irom those
which surround the King of Greece.
There ia a war party in Turkey not less
strong nor less patriotic than that among
the Greeks. It has been roused to mad
ness by the tumene3s with which the Sul
tan has submitted to outside dictation.
It is capable of breaking at any moment
into open revolt. It cannot be ignored by
the Sultan and his advisers, and there is
evidence that its fanaticism is so great
that it would be willing to risk a war
against all Europe combined in what it re
gards as the holy cause of Islam against
the cross.
It is this spirit of mutual bate, born of
racial and religious antagonism between
the Greeks and the Turks, which now dis
turbs the repose ol Europe and threatens
to involve all the nations in a cenernl war.
Three countriesâ Great Britain, F.ranca
and Russia â are charged by a solemn
treaty with the responsibility of main
taining peace in the Levant. It remains
to be seen whether tiiey can do so. Their
statesmen are cleariy averse to war at this
time, but there is a t>ower greater than
diplomacy, and that power may yet set
all the mighty armies of the nations mov
ing in spite o.'ail that statesmen may do
to prevent the catastrophe.

HOME OF THE GODS.
It Is in Crete That the Old Greek
Still Survives*
Chicago Times-Herald.
Were old Jupiter as powerful as he was in
the days before the new gods came and drove
him from his seat on high Olympus there
would be no doubt as to the result oi the war
in Crete. For it was in Crete the god of nods
was born und raised, and it was in Crete he
was entombed when the night cassed away and
the thunderbolts slipped from his dying
hands, red no longer, into the hands of other
and newer deities. What Mecca is to the Mo
hammedan, Benares to the Hindoo, and Jeru
salem to the Christian, that would be Crete to
the believer of the Greek religion ; and so It is
now, in a way, to tho modern scholar who
lives in the beauties of Greek mythos, fable
and story. There is not a spot on the face of
the broad eortn that is so crowded with
memories of Paganism Beautiful as is Crete.
We are all of us iamlliar with the stories of a
religion that has given to the poets of all ages
their best inspiration. But how many of vi
remember our humanities so well as to be xble
to give local habitation to the gods and god
desses, the Heroes and the half immortals
with which the poetry of tvÂ» ages is en
hanced?
Fancy that when Lycurjrus was modern,
when Homer wns a late-comer, when Julius
Caesar was the newest man upon earth, Crete
was ancient! The immortal gods were truly
immortal, it that word may be applied to any
thing, even by way of figure of speech. So
long hs letterslive, so long will ihe gods sur
vive. Aud Crete gave to me world its greatest
god, lor what god is greater than Jove? The
patriot Cretan, fighting lor liberty, scorning
the rule of the Turk, looking toward Greece
for aid and comfort, instinctively rebelling
a alnst the domination of such a man a< Ai.'iul
Humid, has the sympathy of every man who
iiks heard the legends oi the island and for
whom the Greek gods are more than a mere
reference. True, the Cretan of to-day docs not
reahzj Us splendid heritage. But that he has
the sDirit of his ancient fathers, tint the blood
which coursed in the veins of tho Cretans who
fought and conquered Troy still flows i\ his
own vein*, nre facts beyond* all controversy.
With small mental effort we can reconstruct
the ancient Crete and launch ourselves back
into the stream of time when It was flowing
past the gorgeous temples of Jupiter, then a
great and living god, with his millions of
worshipers : when Minerva and Venus and
Baccnus and Juno and Priapus ruled the
affairs of men aud A po.lo was not a sun myth.
Those were the days of the glory of Crete. In
Ovid's time Crete was decadentâ even dead,
and Djc lalus and Icarus, Thesis aud Ariadne,
the sirens of the Minotaur, were as much tra
dition us they are to-day. Let uÂ» glance at
Crete and its association with the my t hs. Many
places claimed the binhof Jupiter, but the
most ancient seems t"> credit Crete. Hesiod
countenances the story that the great Jupiter
was born iv Crete. Rhea, his mother, gave
birth to him in a cavern near the site of
Guossus, afterward the seat of the empire of
the strong King Minos. The Mcllan nymphs
received him in their arms. He was rocked in
a c radio of gold byAdrastea. He was fed on
ambrosia auu on nectar, bronchi by an eagle
that drew it from one of the rocks of old Ida.
And time was when the Cretans showed with
pride the cavern in which the infant Jove was
born and the very platform upou the side of
tho great mountain in which ne gamboled in
piay with the Corybantes, to say nothing of
the tomb in which the poor immortal's bones
were placed when he died.
To Crete we go for the story of Daedalus and
Icarus, told by Ovid in such sweet Latin. The
story was an ancient one even in Homer's
day, and the exiled Roman, sent in bis exile
to one of thejE<ean Isles, simply framed the
picture with a golden edge that has given to
it most of its value. It is not always wise to
undervalue the ancient poets just because
they were heathen. In the story of Daedalus
and his sen Icarus (who took the place of a
murdered nephew whose talents eclipsed those
of the sou) is concealed amoral as high valued
and deep as that of any of the proverbs of
Solomon.
The story of Icarus is so identified with
Crete that one can look to no other place for
associat ions -with the most inspired of an
tique sculptors, Sarpedonâ he who later
"towered Â«mid the field" in the Trojan war
had been driven by his brother Minos from
Crete, and Minos took the tnrone. Dsedalus
sought him, and Minos told him to build the
labyrinth, and Daedalus built it. Whereupon
hangs the story 01 Theseus and Ariadneâ the
theme oi art and poetry unlimited. Daedalus
built the labyrinth, and in its deadly passages
the Athenian youths and maidens were pent
up, to be devoured by the monster Minotaur,
until Theseus, the hero, guided- by the silken
thread of Ariadne, the King's daughter, secured
tne clew to the labyrinthine mysteries, and
Ariadne was carried off in triumph- by the aero
as a reward. - ;
To Crete we must go for the fabled river
Lethe, a draught from the sweet-tasting waters
of which drowned all sorrow and gave "sleep
eternal in an eternal night." .In Crete it was
that the sireps lived, or say rather it was 1 on
the shores of Crete they sang their seductivo
songs that. lured the manner to his destruc
tion. -Thus will Homer-tell you how Ulysses
stopped the ears of his sailors with wax and
ordered his men to bind him to the mast lest,
perforce of the -song,- he would order his
ships to steer toward the rocks ana lose all.
To-day you may see the very pool in which
the sirens bathedland the very rock* upon
which many a good snip, as good ships went
in those days, was dashed to pieces. It is
Suda Bay, as said in these "thin-laced times
of ours," and Cape Malaxa, with Akrotirlon
looking up in the distance. There is no coast
scenery, not even the sub-tropical latitudes of
our own Pacific, that can compare with the
wildness of Crete. It was from Sudaâ perhaps
before the bay and rocks had such a modern
nameâ that the Teutons drew their beautiful
fable of Loreli.
You have read Homer. Yon know . how
Agamemnon went with his great fleet to Troy
to "avenge a private wrong." You are fa
miliar with the story of that splendid epic
and the part the immortal gods played in it.
Greece seems to be predominant in that best
of poems. But when the truth is known, the
part of Greece is merely, secondary. It was
Crete that led the war on Troy. When Helen
plunged the Achaians into that memorable
struggle Idomeneus was the sovereign of the
island. He espoused the cause of the Greeksâ
for were not the Greeks and the Cretans of one
blood?â and led his navy to the front.
More than eighty good ships were sent from
Crjteâ from Guorsus, or Cnossus, the seat of
the kingdomâ to Troy, bearing the flower and
prime of the free manhood of the rugged
island. Idomeneus himself was present and
was no small part of that famous strife. Re
member that this is not fable, but history. For
these were comparatively recent times and
the successor of the immortal Minos was sim
ply helping bis first cousins, the Greeks. At
the close of the Trojan war Idomeneus re
turned to the kingdom only to find that it had
forgotten his greatness. Homer tells us that
at that time in Crete the people were com
posed of the Achaei, the Dorians and the Pe
lasgi. These people rose up and drove the
king from his domains.- But this is somewhat
modern for Crete.
To Crete we must go for all that is left of
the truly Greek. It is said that by philology
can be traced the history of man better than
by written accounts. For written history
traditional, historyâ may go awry now and
then, but language never. There is nothing
so plastic as language. Words, expressive of
things, change with all change. They are
modified by the lightest breatn of custom ; are
swerved by the merest suspicion of conquest ;
suffer in thoirrharacter by the contiguity of
trade and lose themselves in the meshes of
changing* civilization, as do the roots of re
ligion, dress and table manners.
If this be soâ and who can doubt it? â to
Crete we must go f >r all that is original, for all
that is left of the old Greeks. Modern Greek,
as It is spoken in Athens, is not Greek at all.
The perfect Greek scholar waits around him
in the waste and wilderness of words for a
sound that strikes his ear as familier. - The
dialects of Homer are dead. Tne Aeolic, the
Doric, the lonic are no wore in the mouths of
menâ if we except Crete. In that blessed
Island alone are to b; foifnd the remains of
the language of Pythagoras, Plato. Socrates
and Aristotle- In the nilla of Sphacia, or
Sf*kia (as tne English spell it) there remains
the last trace of the old language of the gods
and the Greeks. And it is here only, in all
the world, that this language can be heard.
FAVOREu BY FORTUNE.
Notwithstanding the lact tnat Senator-elect
George Turner of Washington State goes to
i ''ingress by the courtesy of the silverites, to
htm the "dawn of proEverity" is realization,
writes Will Vischer la the Chicago Times-
Herald. He was elected to the exalted office
of United States Senator one day and found
himself almost a millionaire the next day.
When "the next day" is said that docs not
mean literally all wiihin thirty-six hours, but
so close to it that it might have been a few
hours less or a few nours more. And in all
this there is a story.
In what is known as the Rossland district,
ou Trail Creek, a little more than a rifle-shot
across the line of Washington State, iv British
Columbia, one summer day about six years
Hgo a group of prospectors, at the end of their
provisions and powder, lounged about a camp
ing-place waiting for a member of their party
who had been sent to Nelson for supplies.
Time hanging hesvlly upon them it was pro
posed that they climb the adjacent mountain
and see what was mere. The, result was the
staking out of a nest of claims in an open spoi,
cleared of the forest growth br fire. None of
the prospectors had the few dollars necessary
to hnve the claims recorded. Some of the
rock was tnken to Nelson, and E. L. Topping,
who owned a little store, advanced the neces
sary amount on the agreement thut he was to
have the pick ot the claims in payment. He
chose one culled Le Roi.
A year or two aiterward some Spokane law
yers were attending court at Coiville and Top
pine told them o.' his claim. The lawyers fan
cied the specimens of ore and the prospect
was bonded. George Turner became the
owner, at a few cents per share, of 33,000
shares. During the winter just passed some
work was done on Le Roi, and about the same
time that Judge Turner was elected to the
Senate ho wrh informed that a British com
pany had offerea $4 000,000 cash lor Le Roi,
und on the same day lie was further informed
that ano'.her group of mines in which he is
largely interested had "pauned out big." lie
is the general manager of Le Roi, and from
being a long-standing candidate for Senator,
in which aspirations there have been more
demands for expense money than were con
venient and comfortable to the hard-working
lawyer that ne was, in a few hours he became
a member of the highest legislative body of
the Republic and nearly if not quite a mil
lionaire.

LOST A HUNTER
AND TWO SAILORS

Sailing of the Alaska Commercial
Company's Steamer Dora for
Alaska.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Dora sailed for Karluk yesterday.
She took awny quite a number of miners,
who are again going to try their lnck on
the i'ukon, and a host of their friends
were down to see them off. The United
States Inspectors of Huils aud Boilers
made a thorough investigation of the ves
sel and found everything in first-class con
dition.
Captain Caspar ("Patsy") Anderson,
who was for years in command of the
Bertha and later was on the run between
here and Panama as master of the ship
Progreso, took out the Dora. When
"Pat^y" gave up the Progreso he went
ranching at Ontario, Los Angeles County,
nnd made quite a name for himself as a
lemon-grower. Latterly he grew thin
from overwork and tinaily his friends per
suaded him that lie was pining for a
breath oi the sea. lie took their advice
and when Captain 2s iebaum offered him
the command of the Dora he at ones ac
cepted it. His hands show that he was no
idler while ranching and be vows by all
the saints in the calendar that he is not
tired of the job of raising lemons. When
the Alaskan excursion is over he will go
back to Ontario and expects to do better
than ever with hia ranch.
The new steamer Humboldt had an en
gineers' trial 011 the bay yesterday. She
made a splendid showing and her agents
expect her to btat all records en her trial
trip. She "was official measured last
Monday and her dimensions are as fol
lows: Length 213 feet, beam 36 feet, depth
of ho. a 15 ieei 7 inches, net tonnaee 688 138
tons and her signal letters are X M W P.
The coast ssamen will have their cele
bration next Saturday night, rain or
shine. Over 250 men will be in line ana
a splendid showing will be made. T. c
officers who will manage the parade and
the names of the speakers who will ad
dress the seamen afterward have already
been published in Ihe Call. The parade
will form on tl^e corner of Ea^t and Mis
sion stre.- is, and Grand Marshal Edward
Andersen will have the advance nuard in
line facing north. The line oi marcn will
then be along East street to Market, a:ong
Market to Montgomery, up Pine to j
K<?arny. thence to Market, alone Market j
' to Fifth, down Fifth to Howard, thence to i
I Steuart, and by that route to Foisorn
street wharf. Thirteen years a>:o, on a
lumber pile on the Folsom-street bulk
head, the Coast Seamen's Union was in- j
augurated, and there the men will rest \
and give three cheers for the historic spot. 1
The men will then march to the hall, |
where tne speeches will be made.
The American ship Santa Clara docked
at Harrison-street wharf yesterday, and
she will get quick dispatch. Tha Alaska
Packers' Association wants her 111 a hurry j
and the chances are that she will be on
her way to the canneries next week. Cap
tain Ander-on was the recipient of many
compliments on the condition of his vessel
yesterday. She is one of the cleanest and ]
best-appointeu vessels that have come into
port in months and looks more like a yacht
than a merchantman.
The hrst fatality from the sealing fleet
was recorded yesterday. Captain White
! of the Eppinger reports the loss of three
\ men in the Santa Ãaibara Channel. Antone
J. Anderson was the hunter in charge of
the boHt, and after leaving the sebconer in
the morning he and his companions were
never heard from again.
The Eppinger loft here on November 30
for a cruise along the coast. She did very
welJ, and lust reports show that she had
nearly GOO skins aboard. On the Ist inst.
Anderson and two men went out hunting.
It was a beautiful morning, but in the
afternoon the log came up and the three
men were never seen again. Captain White
thinks they made an attemot to land on
the coast ai:d were dashed to pieces 011 the
r^cks.
Anderson was one ofjthe be t-known and
best-l.ked hun;ers on the coast. He wa.s
formerly master of the sealing schooners
Alton and Ap.nie Mathilda, and did fairly
well in both of them. He was a single
man, 26 years of ace and leaves a father,
I brother and sister in Benicia.
The Harbor Commissioners held a liveiy
session yesterday. Harold Wheeler, at
torney fur the estate of A. I'age Brown,
made a strong plea for a 3 per cent com
mission on ihe moneys expended on the
new ferry depot. President Colnon was
opposed to tne claim. He pointed out that
many mistakes had been found in the late
architect's plans, and how many more
wou.d come to light he dii 2 not knosr. He
strenuously opjo-ied the payment of any
money in the shape oF commissions until
the building is completed. Commisjfon
ers ChadOourne and Cole were of the same
opinion, so the matter was shelved and no
payments will be made at present.
The question of supplying iumberto the
board was discussed. The D. K. Me-
Mullin Company nude an offer of $6 90 a
thousand, but afterward withdrew it.
The S. E. Slade Lumber Company < ffared
to take a contract for a year at the lowest
bid put in. The Pacific Pine and Lumber
Company offered to supply the Commis
sion from month to month at $7 40 a
thousand, but us the Slade Company was
willing to take a year's contract at that
fipure its offer was accep-.ed.
Darby Leydon & Co. wera awarded the
contract for supplying piles for work on
the water front for the next twelve
months.
The Union Transportation Company
want the runners removed from tne Stock
ton sieamti*,. The agent told the Com
missioners yesterday that the runner from
his concern would be removed at once if
the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company would remove its man.
The matter was referred to the chief
wharfinger with power to act
Collector George U. White and Collector
F. G. Beatty changed places yesterday.
They are both appointees ot I). T. Cole,
and he had triem confirmed for anothsr
four years. E. M. Buckley, the popular
I wharfinger at Folsom street, was also re-
I appointed for another four years.
State Mineralogist Cooper appeared be
fore the Commissioner and asked for
space on the mezzanine floor of the new
depot for the Mining Bureau. He pointed
out that the exhibit would be inspected
by all the visitors who came to Califor
nia, and would do the Stale jrreat good.
The Commissioners took the matter un
der advisement, but the sentiment seemed
to be that quarters should be established
for all the State institutions in the new
building.
"UoÂ«" Dougherty and Jerry Regan had
a difference of opinion as to the respective
abilities of Corbett and Fitzaimmons yes
terday. They fought It out on the corner
of East and Folsom streets, and while
Dougherty is much the heavier man
Kegan proved himself the better lighter
and laid hU man out before the police ap
peared on the scene.
The whaling steamer Norwhal and Bel
vedere sailed for the Arctic yesterday.
Both of them did fairly well last season,
and the crew is in hopes nf making a big
catch.

BUTLER PETITIONS
FOR HIS LIBERTY
Evidence and Argument in
Habsas Corpus Pro
ceedings.
Judge Morrow Gives His Deci
sion in the Circuii Court
To- Day.
In the Event of This Being Adverse
Prisoner's Couas 1 Wi 1 at Once
Appeal.
Judee Morrow listened with exemplary
patience yesterday to evidence and argu
ment in the hearing of the petition for tlie
release of tbe prisoner_with innumerable
aliases, recently known as Ashe, or But
ler, but, according: to latest advice?, John
Newman. At the close of the argument
on both sides his Honor deferred his de
cision until this morning at 11 o'clocK.
No real doubt exists as to the nature of
that decision, but if adverse to the claim
of the petitioners it will be followed by an
appeal to the Supreme Court, and an
additional delay, which will last until
that tribunal has passed on the questions
raised by the petitioner's counsel and de
cided against the latter by Judge Morrow.
It will be remembered that a writ of
habeas corpus was granted to Newman's
attorneys last Friday, and tbat it was
made returnable on Monday morning.
The hearing was then adjourned until
yesterday, in order to allow the petition
er's counsel time to reply to Marshal
Baldwin's return, which declared that the
prisoner was being held under two com
mitments issued by United States Com-
I mi*sioner Heacock.
When the case was called in the Circuit
I Court yesterday Attorney Biack found
j both the Queen and the people of the
I United States arrayed against him and
his client in the persons of Attorney Den
nis Donohoe and the United States Attor
ney, Henry S. Foote.
Mr. Black's first duty was to rile what is
technically known as a traverse in reply
to the Marshal's return, this document
setting forth certain specific objections to
the Commissioner's jurisdiction and to
the facts recited in both commitment?. It
further affirmed that the prisoner was a
British subject found on British terrilory ;
that he was forcibly seized, albeit he was
not a fugitive from justice, and that his
person could not be legally taken posses
sion of by force. On these grounds the
petitioner prayed for bn immediate re
lease.
Most of the witnesses in the preliminary
hearing before Commissioner Heacock
were recalled to testify on the particular
issues raised. Sergeant Banner, Marshal
Baldwin, Captain Fraser of the Swan
hilda, Commissioner Heacock and the
British Consul-General, J. W. Warburton,
were all subjected to examination by Mr.
BlacK in -upport of his objections to the
Commissioner's jurisdiction and to prove
his contention that the prisoner had
made verbal statements and had acted in
a manner which proved conclusively that
he did not intend to remain in the United
States, bui was desirous of returning to
Great Britain direct.
The prisoner himself testified to his
forcible seizure on bjard the Swanhilda
and his unwilling detention at the City
Prison. He had shipped, he said, for
three years, and had not the slightest in
tention of stayin* in the United States.
To his knowledge the Swanhilda was the
only vessel bound for England in the port
of Newcastle when he signed articles.
In the course of cross-examination he ad
mitted the correctness of Captain Fraser's
evidence regarding the dialogues which
took place between the latter and himself
in the shipping office at Newcastle and on
board the Swanhilda.
But the prisoner's evidence was some
what discounted when Captain Fraser
again took the stand and stated that there
actually had been a vessel in the port
of Newcastle, loading coal for London
direct, when he (Newman) applied to
the witness for a ber;h on the Swanhilda.
Commissioner Heacock lucidly and for
cibly explained certain points having ref
erence to his decision.
Detective Mcliattie recited a conversa
tion with the prisoner soon after the ar
rest, in which, in reply to the witness'
question as to his motive for carrying so
much jewelry about with him, the pris
oner said that he was taking it home to
his sister in England.
Detective Egan and Constable Conway
completed the list of witnesses, and Mr.
Back then rose to deliver his argument.
He repeated in substance his former con
tention respecting the jurisdiction of the
court and the international recognition of
any ves.Â«el as constituting the actual ter
ritory whose flag she flies.
He laid stiess upon the distinction be
tween a fugitive from justice and a person
seeking an asylum, urging that while the
facts might be construed to sujgest that
the prisoner was the former there was not
a particle of evidence to prove that he wa?
the latter.
Mr. Donohoe cited authority for au
thority in reply and sarcastically pointed
out that if Mr. Black's reasoning were ad
mitted then any criminal might pose as a
tourist on p. pleasure trip and assure the
officers who wished to arrest him that he
merely contemplated a temporary sojourn
in the country whither be was fleeing.
The United States attorney followed
Mr. Donohoe, his two principal argu
ments being that the commissioner en
joyed complete authority to pass on both
law and fact, and that even if this were
not so the facts themselves proved con
clusively that the prisoner sought to
make this country a place of refuge and
that he came here incumbered by the
material evidences of the crimes with
which he was charged.
The court then adjourned until 11
o'clock this morning.
"THfiÂ£Â£ FAIRY GIFTS."
Little Ones to IMay for Charity at the
Tivoli Opera- liouse.
For the past five weeks the Tivoli Opera
house has been the scene of merry dances,
songs and revels, as one hundred little ones
have been rehearsing in a pretty little play
entitled "Tbe Three .fairy Gifts," which
they will produce on Sunday afternoon,
March 14, at the Tivoli. The proceeds of
the entertainment will be donated to the
Bush-street Free Sabbath-school, a most
deserving institution. For the past few
years the school has been unable to stand
the extra expenses that have presented
themselves, and the lit lie children con
ceived the idea of relieving their present
embarrassment.
Miss Hatue Nathan, the dramatic reader,
has been coaching the little ones and is
personally conducting the entire perform
ance. The Centennul Minstrels will give
a minstrel "first part," and as the young
men are ail well known their presence will
add greatly to Che performance.
Amone the otner feat arts will be spe
cialties by the little Schlessinger children,
Ro!>ie d' Knnery and a host of others. The
management has no expense to
make tne affair successful, and the tickets
can be reserved, without exir.i charge, on
tha day of the performance.
THE SCHOOL TANGLE.
There Will Be a Suit Over the
Secretaryship of the
School Board.
Reginald H W.bster YasterJay As
sumed tbe O.fice of Su
perintrnder.t
Reginald H. Webster yesterday took
foirnal possession of the office of Superin
tendent of Schools. Maaison Babcock
left th â  office about 9 o'clock and Mr. Web
ster came in a little later, accompanied by
C. B. Stone, who was at once installed as
deputy superintendent, succeeding Miss
English. Mr. Webster tiled his bond and
oath of office last December after he had
received his certificate of election, conse
quently there was no formality yesterday.
Mr. Webster's advent caused a fluster
very naturally. He announced that, so
far as he was concerned, no move would
be made at the next meeting of the board,
which will be held to-night, toward effect
ing any change in the position of secre
tary. What would be done later he did
not care to predict, but said that his own
legal position had been uncertain and that
therefore he had not been able to bestow
his full attention upon other considera
tions. The present secretary, Charles W.
Welch, is reasonably sure to remain until
the end of this month at least.
Mr. Ueanston, the former secretary of
the board, who claims that he has been
entitled to the office ever since he was
dispossessed of it by force, said last nicht
that he uid not know what he would do.
His case was in the hands of his attorney.
He had always held, he said, that Air.
Babcock exceeded his legal power in ex
peiling vim, he being a statutory ollicer.
At the same time Mr. Beanston s-aia that
he was fully aware of the fact that Mr.
Babcock had been de facto Superintendent
and that this must be considered. The
question involved in the secretaryship
was different from that relating to the po
sition oi Superintendent.
While the defeat of vVebater in the
court, had it taken place, would have
meant Mr. Beanston's defeat, he said that
Wi-bster's success had left him a chnnce.
The matter would probably ba settled by
a suit in his case.

LOOKING BACKWARD
INTO OTHER LIVES
Dharmapala, the Buddhist
Priest, Talks of Re
incarnations.
The Continuity of Life the Foun
dat.on of Buddhistic
Philosophy.
It Is Not Only Necessary to Have
Faith in Order to 8a
Saved.
Dharmapnla, the eloquent Buddhist
priest, lectured before the Golden Gate
branch of tha Theosopbical Society at
Native Sons' Hall last evening. A large
audience was present. His subject was
"The Continuity of Life."
He said that the continuity of life was
believed in 3000 years ago. At the time
Bmidha appeared skepticism was rife con
cerning the philosophy of the time in all
its variety, the question of how the "1" â
the individualâ was to be perpetuated
through infinity.
Buddha stuJied the question for a
Ion;; time, and at lest declared that it
could not be. There is a consciousness
that lives forever, but it is subject to eter
nal and â  onstant change. He denied the
dofjma of the time, that was universally
ace nted, that the soul came into exist
ence at a certain period of time and would
terminate at some other period.
It liad no stated beginning and would
continue forever throuch infinite changes.
It was a new philosophy. The ascetics
who gave their live 3to a concentration of
thought upon the future state were
equally in error with those who gave
themselves up to the acquirement of
wealth and power in this life. Both were
equally selfish. 'lolive a noble and pure
life, full of activity for good, was the better
wav, for it builded character.
To control one's thoughts, refusing to
admit evil, that brought bliss to the soul
here and now. No dogma is true, he said.
A religion that forces one to believe can
not be true. The true religion can have
no extremes.
He referred to the suicides that have
flecked the news of ihe day sjnee his re
cent arrival, the death of Oakley at the
Palace from debauchery ana champagne,
the turning on of the iras by an unhappy
wife the day before. The act of both was
the result of selfishness.
Selfishness meant suffering; love and
enlightenment and compassion was to ex
pand and livo and know bliss.
So it comes to this, he said, that con
sc ousnesi lives for ever and the man who
would progress toward higher planes must
not oniy desire and aspire, but he must
act; he must live an upright pare life and
strive lor better things. ThÂ«Â» conscious
ness of Schopenhauer, of Washington.
What ha* become ot them? Where did
they go to?
"It was the message of Buddha to the
world and it is the message that I bring
to you, that eternal change is the order
and progress is the result of effort. There
is no death; it is merely change. Death,
so called, is the end of a generation of
thought. With the release ot conscious
ness in this life, it is born into an
other, and so on, and so on for
ever. Concentration of thought and
a pure life will enable you to look
backward from year to year to the earliest
year of your life, and beyond that to the
period 6f gestation in the womb, for we
hold that consciousness is even there, and
then beyond that into the preceding in
carnationâwhat thoughts controlled at
that time."
Dharraopala will lecture before the Starr
King Fraternity of the First Presbyterian
Church, Oakland, on Friday evening. His
subjret will be "The Religions of Asia."
Admission 25 cents.
Sunday morning he will occupy Dr.
Wendte's pulpit, Oakland, and will speak
on the "Reconciliation of Buddhism and
Christianity."
He will address the students of Stan
ford University in tne latter part of the
month. ____^______

GOOD WORK FOR
CALIFORNIA
Annual Meeting of Members
of the State Board
of Trade.
Interesting Reports Made by
General Chipman and J.
A. Filcher.
Officers Elected for the Ensuing Term
Some Suggestions for Fu
ture Work
i
At the annual meeting of the State
Board of Trade held yesterday a eood deal
of time was expended in the discussion of
the reports handed in by President N. P.
Cnipman and Secretary J. A. Filcher.
That of the president was read first.
The report showed that, despite the gen
eral impression that the first crop all over
the State was badly hurt by the frost of
1896, "the actual falling off of deciduous
fruits attributable to frost was less than
12 per cent." The important features of
the document were sMnimed up in the fol
lowing excerpt:
Another noticeable feature worthy of atten
tion is that we exported or sent out of the
State in 1893 nearly 7000 carloads of vege
tables, while in 189t> the exports had fallen to
1617 carloads.
The shipments have fallen off rtipidiy since
1893. lam unable to account for this decline
in an indu-iry that gave such promise of bene
fit to the Statcl unless it Be in part that our
products are now driven out of consumption
by increased Importation, the result of iuade
quate protection and in part from a general
lalling off in consumption in the line of econ
omy ofliving.
1 commend the subject to the board as
worthy of investigation in order to discover
the cause and find the remedy.
The wine and brandy industry holds its
place in importance witn great tenacity, and
it is believed is improving irom year to year.
I find no serious cause for discouragement
in the fruit industry, but muc i to encourage.
It has suffered in common with all othi.-r oc
cupations s-i;ice the hard times fell upon our
country, but with a revival of trade and busi
ness no industry will fe^l the impulse ot the
improvement mort quickly or more certainly
thht this.
We have boxed the compass ot all difficulties
as to the art of planting trees and growing
fruit. There are very few if any piifalls lor
the inteliifient orchardist in that direction.
The question of possibility of overproduction
continues to halt timid mind', and there is
much perplexity as to tho best method to
market our fruit.
Though it was admitted that some of
the fruits had necessarily suffered a little
through transportation from this City to
the Atlanta Exposition and back, Secre
tary Filcher maintained that the exhibit
at the Post-street rooms is quite up to the
standard. Some trouble, he stated, had
been found with peaches, which were
cracked in most cases so as to admit the
embalming fluid amd cause fermentation.
He emphasized earnestly the attention
the State should give the Guatemala and
Hamburg expositions and said several
tons of exhibits had already been placed
in the hands of the beard for transporta
tion to Hamburg.
The financial report shows that on
February 9 the balance on hand amounted
to $2030 75, and the receipts for that
month of f7IS 50 made the total on March
9 foot up the sum of $2749 '25. The dis
bursements left on deposit $191168.
For the ensuing ierm tne directors of the
State Board of Trade will be General N. P.
Chipman, W. H. Mills. B. N. Rowley, C.
F. ilontg mery, E. W. Maslin, j. S.
Emery, Senator Geor-re C. Perkin?, P. A.
Buell, Colonel John P. Irish, C. M. WooÂ«
--ttir and Mark L. McDonald.
General Chipman was re-elected presi
dent and J. A. Fisher secretary and gen
eral manager. J. S. Emery was elected
first vice-president and C. P. Montgomery
second vice-president. The Crocker-
Woolworth National .bank remains the
treasurer.
UNA'S TROUBLES OVER.
The Treasury Department Orders the
Final Keloane of the Fugitive
Schooner.
Collector Wise has received orders from
the Treasury Department at Washington
to release tne schooner Una from the pre
dicament she has been in for several
weeks past, on the payment of a Una of
$10.
The Una was about to be tied up at Pan
ama by the Government of Colombia on
trumped up charges preierred by the
owners of the cargo, when Captain Har
kins, believing that he was getting inio a
bad position, suddenly noisted his sails
and ran out of the harbor with a gunboat
in chase. He siiled witnout his clearance
papers or bill of health, and on his arrival
here was at first reiused entrance at the
Custom-house.
A telegraphic correspondence with the
Trea-ury Department settled up the mat
ter of the clearance papsrs, but the ab
sence of a clear bill of heaitti was not so
satisfactory and further communications
were necessary. The fine for sailing with
out a clean bill is $5000, but the depart
ment, apparently satisfied that Captain
Harkins was not altogether to blame for
it, imposed the nominal fine of $10.
WANTED FOR FRAUD.
Bin. I. aura de Force Gordon Accuses
Morris Cohen.
Mrs. Laura de Force Gordon, the attor
ney, swore to a complaint in Judge Low's
court yesterday cbareing Morris Cohen
with obtaining money by false pretenses.
She told Assistant Prosecuting Attorney
Gleason that Cohen called nt her office a
few days ago representing that he was a
poor man with a large family and he

CARSON, >'cv., March 9.â The mystery
Burrounding those secret interviews which
took place yes erday at the Arlington Ho
tel between representatives of tbo glove
contest management and some of the
United States otlicials located here was
cleared away to-day, and it appears that
the promoters bad a narrow escape from
getting some trouble on their hands that
mignt have prevented the holding of the
great battle on St. Patrick's day. But as
matters have been adjusted there will be
no danger now of any interference, so
those who have been contemplating the
journey to Carson may resume the pack-
Ing of their grips and come on with the
lull assurance that they will see the tight â
the tight of the century.
The threatened trouble was all due to a
misunderstanding between United States
Attorney Jones and those who are assist
ing Dan Stuart in handling the big pro
ject. There are two sides to the story, of
course. Mr. Jones' version is pirticularly
interesting. During a conversation I had
with him to-day he spoke very frankly and
related his grievance without apparent en
deavor to nide anything.
It appears that when Dan Stuart first
visited Carson last year end was given
cau3e to hope that a bill legalizing glove
contests could b.e passed through the Ne
vada Legislature he looked about him :or
a responsible and influential attorney
to look out for the lesal phases of tbÂ«
venture. Now, whiie Mr. Jones occupies
the cilice of United States Attorney for
Nevada, be also has the privilege under
the law to act as private counsel for per
sons or corporations in all courts other
than the Federal tribunals. In the latter
he mu>t serve Uncle Sam only. Some
body suggested to Stur.rt that Mr. Jones
would be a good man to retain, for vari
ous reasons.
Attorney Jones is now authority for the
â¢tatement that he was retained by the
genia) Texan and paid the usual advance
fee. Stuart then left the State, but some
time later W. K. Wbeelock, his trusted
lieutenant, arr.ved in Carson and had
with him a letter from Stuart directing
Mr. Jones to continue to act under Whee
l.ock's instructions. The United States
Attorney says that his Brat task as Stu
art's private counsel was to draw up the
bill which subsequently becarr.e the now
famous glove-coiuejt law of Nevada.
Ths bill, as will be remembered, wa3 in
troduced by Assemblyman Gnrrard, was
passed by both houses and was signed
by Governor Sadler. From that on
everything appeared to be smooth sailing.
Preparations were begun for holding the
contest, Wheelock came to Carson and
opened headquarters, the mammoth arena
was got under way and newspaper corre
spondents be, r an to Hock into Carson
from all parts of the continent to keep
vig;! over the training of the two famous
boxers who are to battle for the world's
championship.
Attorney Jones says that at about this
lime he came to the conclusion thai ha
could not be of much further service to
the promoters, as everything seemed to
be running smoothly, so he sent in his
final account, with a written request for a
settlement, in full for h:s services.
And rk'ht here is wheie the trouble be
gan. Althoush the exact amount of Mr.
Jones' bill is not known it is said that it
was nothing small. This should not
have caused so much surprise, though,
for Mr. Jones has always had the reputa
tion of being a high-priced lawyer.
A day or two after presenting his bill,
he says, he called for his check, but to his
astonishment was informed that he had
long sine* been paid for his services and
that there was nothing more coming to
him. According to Jones' version, he
thought he d. seemed on attempt to give
him what is known in sporting parlance
as the ''double cross." Somebody had been
figuring, lie thought, that he had com
promised himself by acting as counsel and
lobbvi t for Stuart while holding the officn
of United States Attorney, and would
hesitate before making aa effort â sncti a
one, at least, as would reach the public
ear â to co.lect his bill or make trouble for
tne management.
But if such an argument governed the
ncting of the promoters they were mis
taken in their man. Jones admits that he
n-verdid relish being worsted in any sort
of a transaction, and says frankly that in
this case he set about immediately to find
some way to obtain revenge. The ani
mated conferences of yesterday were proof
enough for those who wern familiar with
the trouble that something unusual was
brewing.
Al Livingston, who represents Stuart in
most of bis confidential affairs here, was
closeted \v:th United States Attorney
Jones for an hour or more at the Arling
ton, and also hart a long talk with United
States Marshal Humphreys. None of
these persons would divulge anything re
(.ardmc ihe nature of their conferences
last night, but to-day it leaked out tnai
Livingston had been delegated to effect a
compromise with Jones, it possible. I un
derstand that he was offered the full
amount of his Ull, but Jones seemed
rather inclined to have his revenge in
preference to the money. After a deal of
persuasion, accompanied by explanations
and aujlogies, he finally accepted, it is
said, and now all is plain sailing again for
the fight.
Just what method the United States At
torney in tended to adopt in order to make
trouble for the management has not been
definitely given out, but I have it on the
best authority that an information was to
issue to the fffect that a conspiracy was
On foot to commit an overt act against <he
peace and dignity of the United Stales,
and that by virtue of the information
warrants would be placed in the hands
uf the United (States Marshal for th* ar
rest of the persons supposed to be impli
cated in the alleged conspiracy. The most
important individuals so named would,
quite naturally, bo Corbett, Fitzdmmons
arid Dan Stuart. If these warrants were
not served until a day or two b?fore the
fight the result is quite obvious. Whether
the charges com I be proved or not would
make no difference. The cases would have
have to go through the usual dilatory
process of reaching a hearing in court,
and Dy that time the 17th of March would
have long since passed, with no fipht.
Tne managers of the big project are
not saying a great deal about this affair,
but they are doing some "tali thinking."
Hints about "leg pulling" have been
quietly dropped, but there is an evident
desire to be cautious, and not get Jones
on the warpath again. He is uouotless
looked upon as a bad man to fool with â a
Veritable buzz-saw.
But the dancer is all over and exclu
sively fight talk will be resumed in the
dining rooms, the saloons and on the
streets, as has been the case prior to this
recent interruption.
Mrs. Bob Fitzsimmons says sh<Â» is
going to attend the big contest. You
know Fitzsimmons, ia his recent dream
about the battle, saw his wife in one of
the front seats and clearly heard her
words of encouragement while he was
battering th- Cah ornian. Bub has great
faith in his dreams, for, he says, Ihey
always come true; *o, in order to make
this last one complete, Mrs. Bob should
have a seat in the arena.
The Cornishman's work to-day was, ac
cording to his new programme, lighter
than usual, so far as indoor exercise
entered into it, but he evened this off by
taking a loneer road tramp than usual
and indulging in more sprinting. The
entire forenoon was consumed Dy the
latter class of work.
After luncheon Bob put in over a half
hour thumping th- bag and then did some
light sparring with Hickey and fcjtelzner.
All of his indoor work is to be light from
now on, in order that he gain in elasticity
und agility rather than additional brute
strength.
Corbett was also easy in his work|to-day,
with the exception of his afternoon
sparring, wtiich was in spots fast and
furious and decidedly uncomfortable for
his boxing partners. During these bouts
he knocked Billy Woods down twice de
spite the protection afforded by Billy's
pneumatic mask and breastworks, and
one of these blows put Woods to sleep for
a few seconds, it was another ol those
vicious left-hand hooks that Corbett uses
nowadays with so much precision and
effect
Then, during his bout with Jeffries
Jim sent in a right-hand heart blow that
staggered the clever Los Angeles giant
and caused him to hold up his hands for a
cessation of hostilities, as he was in pain.
Jim said be did not mean to be so rough
and then called for another partner.
Trainer Chat ley While explained to me
while we were watching Corbett's bout
with Jeffries that both he and Billy De
laney had warned the big fellow not to
hit his hardest while sparring with his
men. Corbelt tried hard to remember
this, but now and then iorgot himself and
let fly a blow that causei hid partner to
see stars.
"Our object in holding him down in this
regard is to obviate the danger of his
hands bern" injured," said the genial
Charley. "You see the right is so near at
hand that an injury now would be next to
suicidal. Jim's lists are as hard as iron,
and I have not the ieast fear in the world
about their holding out through the con
tes\ but our argument is that if his hands
are going to break at all, let them be
broken in the ring and on J-Itz-immons
ratuer than on his trainers. It is the
most discouraging thing in the world for
a man to go into battle with a bad fist.
We caution him repeatedly to spar
lightly, and he tries to do it. The trouble
i* lie does not know how hard he hits.
Whenever he forgets himself and sends
oni a good blow, the man hejs sparring
with invariably drops, just as .billy Woods
did a moment ago."
An amusing little incident occurred
whiie the champion was at bis bag prac
tice. T;.ere was something the matter
with the pneumatic ball, ant the big fel
low could not make it rnitle against the
ceiling the way he usually does. It had
not been properly inflated and seemed
â 'dead." Jim thumped away a: it for live
or six minutes and then got mad.
"Hang the thing!" he exclaimed, end
he accompanied the words with a terrible
swine at the offending ball.
There was a snap and a bang, and the
sphere, which had been torn completely
out of its fastenings by the blow, went
bounding over tho heads of the crowd
which hai been gaping at the big boxer at
his work.
"That's only one of Fitzsimmons 1
tricks," said Curbett, when he heard the
subiiuei expressions of wonder and admi
ration of his prowess. "He does that
every day for the benefit of his visitor;,"
chuckled the champion, "and makes them
think that he is ihe greatest hitter that
over lived. But a schoolboy can do it.
All that you have to do is to give the ball
a good downward punch and it's dead
sure to break the fastenings."
The weather in Carson is still unsettled,
although the sun :4ione brightly and
warmiy all day. A heavy wind set in to
night, and the signal service man pre
dicts another snowfall for to-morrow. As
far as he can look inio the future he can
not see a very heavy storm. It will proba
bly be one of only a few hours and li?ht
:it that, according to his calculations.
Beyond this storm he thinks he sees good
wea'her. and that augurs well for the 17th
of March.
The sale of seats for the aDproachin?
fight is entirely satisfactory to the man
agement according to a statement made
to me to-night by Secretary Wheeloclc.
He said that over 5000 of the best loca
tions had already been bo'.ight and paid
for, and with eich succeeding mail came
larger stack? of letters containing checKs
and greenbacks along with reqnpst* for
the be^t seato left. J. G. Maxsfikld.

CARSON, Nev., March 9.â The snow
melted under the hot sun to-day as
swiftly as does a roll of bank notes before
a Carson, faro-dealer, and the roads are
once more dryin in patches.
Corbett and Fitzsimmons put in three
hours at hill-climbing this morning, pre
paratory to 'their regular training.
Neither of the heavy-weights shows any
disposition to let up in his work befort>
the end of the week, despite the warning
of the trainers.
The impression seems to obtain that the
battle will hi a long one, and the princi
pals are determined to fit themselves for
the full route.
Referee George Siler has been compar
ing notes for several days with Fitzsim
mons and Corbett with regard to the
QueensLury rules, and to-morrow he will
prepare a resume of his conclusions, for
publication.* In this digest the rules will
be taken up seriatim and explained clear
ly for the information of the public.
"I know that I am liable to criticism
(or doing this now," explained Mr. Siler
this evening, "and I wish to make my
position as clear as possible before the day
of the fizht.
"The referee's decision in this contest
will divert many hundreds of thousands
of dollars, and I feel that I cannot be too
careful I may say now that there

will be no bickering about the rules.
The men have agreed to leavo all
to me, and in order that everybody
may understand how the battle is to be
fouaht, I propose to make my instructions
to the fighters public to-morrow through
the press, instead of issuing them orally at
the ring. Half of the spectators would not
hear my voice from the ringside, and they
would not understand what constituted a
fair break-away or a foul blow.
"In tne fitst clinch some one would
shout 'foul.' and up would go a roar from
the partisans of the man supposed to have
been fouled. If the rules of the contest
are clearly explained beforehand the spec
tators will know what latitude the fighters
are allowed, and my rulings will not be so
liable to question.
"It is an easy matter to confuse the old
Queensbury rules, famous and popular as
tiiey are. Take, for instance, the clause
providing that a man shall retire to his
co r ner when his opponent is down. Sup
posing that Corbett should be floored in
Fitzsimmons' corner.
"Fitzsimmons would be obliged to stand
over him in violation of the rule. Again,
a man might squat on his feet with one
hand on the lioor and be considered as
down. If it is decided that he is down
while in this position he may ba counted
out.
"If he is not down his opponent is at
liberty to hit him and he cannot be
counted out. Rule 12, which touches
upon the London prize-ring regulations,
is also open to misconstruction, and will
be treated at length in my communication
to-n-orrow.
"After rending this letter the betting
public will know to a dot what to expect,
ana if sportsmen consider that either man
has an advantage under my directions
they may bet accord.

"Old Bill" l)tiriÂ» Rexrued from Pauper
dotn by Stuart's Frnj'ct.
"Old Biil" Davis is probably the oldest
professional pugilist who will witness the
prize-fight between Corbett and Fitz-im
mons at Carson. Some of the newspaper
correspondents have been interviewing
Bill, who, in the knowledge of present
residents of San Francisco, was |fighting
in the prize-ring in Nevada in ISH2 or
1563. But he fell into hard days. He is
now over 60 years of age. riis days of
fighting are over. Six months ago, or
about that lime, be was so reduced in
circumstances that he sought shelter in
the Almsbouseof ths City and County of
San Francisco, with the prospect of pass
inc many day-> ther*.
When the Corbett-Fitzsimmons mill
gave rise to the construction of the big
amphitheater at Carson good fortune
coyly peeped once more at "Old Bill" and
irave him a friendly deti.
A friend at Carson, who had known
Bill well in old times, interested himself
in the old pugilist and sent for him to
come to Carson to act permanently as a
watchman of the new coliseum. Bill did
not wait, but started as soon as he could
get the money to go. Among those con
cerned in the fight at Carson, indirectly,
is one who wi.i benefit materially, and
that is "Old Bill" Davis.

the ilonim Round.
BIRMINGHAM, Em, March 9.â The
fight between Billy Plimraer of England
and Sammy Kelly of .New York for Â£200
a side and a purse of Â£400 took place to
night before the Olympic Sporting Club of
this city, and was won by Kelly in twenty
rounds.
There was a large number of spectators
present to see the right, the hall being
crowded to its tullesi capacity. Both men
entered the ring weighing 114 J-^ pounds.
The betting at the start was in f.ivorof the
Englishman, the odds on him being 5 to 4.
In l c first three rounds Plimmer took
a strong lead, to the great satisfaction of
his supporters. Kelly appeared to be
quite slow and he was a target lor Piim
mer's lelt.
In the fourth round Plimmer punished
Kelly fearsuily, but the latter frequently
missed his rignthnnd swings.
At ihe end of the tenth round Plimmer
had become a strong favorite, and he was
backed at 3 to 1 to win.
To the end of the sixteenth round the
Englishman had the best of a pretty but
exceptionally hard encounter. Kelly
then fought with greater determination
and P.immer, in the eighteenth round,
showed that his previous exertions bad
tir^-d him.
Kelly had the best of this round, but
notwithstanding thiÂ« Plinimer was a
strong favorite in the nineteenth round.
Kelly now redoubled his efforts, realizing
that nothing but a knockout blow would
win the tight for him. Amid tremendous
excitement lie hustled the Englishman
around the ring, gaining the upper hand.
When the twentieth and last round was
half finished Kelly landed a crushing blow
on his opponent's jaw. Plimmer stas-
KÂ»red. and Kelly following up his advan
tage landed another sniasheron his throat,
knocking him down. The Englishman
ro-e after nine t>econds. Keily again
smashed him, knocking him out, ten ec
ends before the time of the fight would
have been up.
The victory of toe American was a sen
sational one.

VISIT SAN PEDRO
Deep Harbor Site Invaded
by Several Hundred
Excursionists.
Business Men Go as Guests o?
the Terminal Railway
Company.
On the Shores of the Favored Inlet
the People's Victory Is
Ratified.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 9.â The
second ratification of the late action of
the Board of Harbor Commissioners in
selecting San Pidro as the site foi the
deer-water harbor took the form of an ex
cursion over the Terminal Railway to that
port to-day. It was got up by t,e offi
cials of the road, and the three commer
cial bodies of this city were their guests
There were fourteen cars loaded to the
platforms. Everybody who went wore
Terminal and Chamber of Commerce
badges. The former decoration was a red
ribbon, on which was printed in gold:
"Terminal Railway excursion to Los An
geleB 1 deep-water harbor, March 9, 1897."
The Chamber of Commerce badge simply
announced "San Pedro day," giving the
date.
The commercial bodies of the city were
well represented. The Chamber of Com
merce sent many of its members; the
Board of Trade had a liberal delegation,
and the Me r chants' and Manufacturers'
Association was conspicuous at all stages
of the proceedings.
It was a great day for San Pedro and
those who had taken an active part in
promoting the deep-water harbor enter
prise. Refreshments were served at the
pavilion on Terminal Island, after which
the party bn>l; â  up and strolled along the
beach. Many went across the channel to
San Pedro and inspected the new tracts
recently opened for sile. The day was a
charming one and the clear atmosphere
afforded a magnificent view of the snow
capped mountains in the distance. Messrs.
Gibbon, Rule, Hynes and other officers of
the Terminal road were lavish in their at
tentions to excursionists.
General Bouton, Slotterbeck, the gun
smith, Joseph Mullally and three or four
other gentlemen had their diamond studs
stolen hy expert thieves in the crowd
wnile taking luncheon. No trace of the
thieves has been discovered.
While there are no announcements
made officially regarding the question the
belief is general tnat the Los Angeles and
Redondo Railway Company will at an
early date extend its lines to San Pedro.
The railway line now operated by th â¢
company runs nearly directly south from
the Los Angeles station to Gardena and
there makes a sharp turn to the westward,
which carries the line to Redondo. This
line is a little over seventeen miles in
length. San Pedro lies almost due south
o: Gardena and is less than ten miles from
that place. The addition of a branch irom
Gardens to San Pedro, connecting with
the line now operated by the company,
would make the road twenty-seven miles
in length.
PETTEGREW S UNIQUE WILL.
Inscr.bed His Bequests on the Back of a
Photograph of His
Heir.
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., March 9â An
original and unique document, in the
form of a will executed by James P. Pette
prew, was admitted to probate in Judge
Clark's department of the Superior Court
here this forenoon. The author of the
strange instrument died in this city a few
weeks abo at the age of 71. He possessed
an utter disrecard for the ordinar / forms
of legal procedure, but hai such shrewd
ness that the instrument by which he de
vised his estate met all requirements, in
the opinion of Judge Ciark.
The testator had an excellent photo
graph of his son, George W. Pettegrew, a
young man, who resides at Randsburg,
the new mining camp, lie took a she t
of notepaper just the size of the photo
graph and very carefully pasted it on the
back of the picture. Then he wrote his
will on the back of the photograph. It
was a short document, and the jhrnse
olopy is sufficiently out of the ordinary to
make it of unusual interest It was as
follows:
Los ANOELES, Cai., Jan. 21, 1897.
This is a photo of George W. Pettegrew, ivho,
in case of my denth, is the owner ot oil my
property of any kind whatsoever. George W.
rettegrew was born December, 1860. His ad
dress is Randsburg, Kern County, Cal. Tele
graph Him. He will come and pay nil honest
debts. J. W. Pette<-,rew,
Father of George W. Pettegrew.
Witness: Andrew J. Rideoct.
It was in the handwritinc of the old
man, except for the signature of Mr. Ride
or.t. Id whose hands Pottesrrew placed the
will and who kept it until the death of the
testator. There are other children of the
deceased, but ho left his estate to his son
George. The other children are: Mrs.
Manta J. Dangbure, aged 42; Andrew J.
Petteerew, aged 38; Ida N. Petteerew,
aged 34, and Jiuige Pettogrew, aged 28, alt
of Gardnerville, Douglass County, Nev.
The esta cis worth about $4000. It con
sists of |1000 in money in a safety-deposit
box at the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank

MURPHY STATION WRECKERS.
Boys Confess That They Placed Dynamite
on a Ranway to Destroy a
Tram.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Mar. 9.â The Cere
vegna boys, who were arrested yesterday
on a charge of attempting to wreck a
train at Murphy station, made a complete
confession to-day.
John Cerevegna, the elder brother,
claims he originated the idea of placing
dynamite on the railway track and that
his younger brother, Peter, was an un
willing partner in the escapade.
The confession was made to District At
torney Hernngton. John Cerevegna was
very penitent and seemed to realize the
enormity of his offense. He said he pro
posed to his brother last Saturday that
they place a stick of dynamite on the
track, just to see what it would do to the
the train.
Peter objected but allowed John to per
suade him to take part in the plan. A
stick of dynamite was placed on the track,
a cap being tied to it with a piece of
string. As soon as this was done Peter
went away, but John bid behind a nearby
tree.
When the front of the train struck the
cap John was disappointed, as he saw
only a slight puff of smoke. He did not
know that the concussion broke the glass
on the headlight.
When John went back to the house he
did not tell his lather, as be feared lie
would be punished. The next day John
put two more sticks of dynamite on the
track, providing each with B cap.
He did not wait for the train, but went
back to the house. He and hi* brother
were arrested the next day. Peter Cere
veÂ«na corroborated the story told by his
broiher in all the main facts.
The boys wi!l be arraigned to-morrow
morning. The crime they committed is
a capital offense, according to the laws of
California, and [I convi< ted the penalty is
either death or imprisonment for life.
TITLE TO GUADALUPE LAND.
Land Office Decides in Favor of the
Settlers Who Made Filings
in 1892.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 9â A decision
which is of great interest to sev#al well
known residents of this county has been
handed down by the registrar and re
ceiver of the United States Land Office at
San Francisco.
It is to the effect that Charles P. Owen,
Matt E. Arnerich, V. A. Schelier, John
D. Mackenzie, Charles Cole and Paul Ar
nerich are the lawful owners of the land
on which they settled at Guadalupe.
The litigation over the prope"ty has
lasted several years, the contest being
made by the heirs of the Coleman estate,
who claimed the Guadalupe mine under a
foreclosure decree. The Sheriff's deed in
cludfd a 1500-acre tract of land in which
the Government had never relinquished
its interest.
CharHs P. Owen and others made re
searches in 1890 and found that the Guada
lupe Mining Company had no title to this
land. Accordinely, in December, 1892, fil
ings on portions of the land were offered
by V. A. Scheller, C. Oweu, Si. E. Arnerich,
Charles Colo, Adolpb. Dunker, Paul
Arnerich, J. D. McKenzie and John
Withers, but all of the applications were
rejected by the Registrar of the Land
Office at San Francisco.
An appeal was tak n to the Interior De
partment at Washington, and on August
11, 1894 the Commissioner of the General
Lmd Office rev-rsed the decision and di
rected that the filing be accepted upon
the claimant-! complying with the law.
The Guadalupe Mining Company at
once tried to block proceedings by offer
intrfilings on the land as mineral lan<ts,
allying prior rights. The Interior De
par; ment on May 26, 1896, directed the
San Francisco officials to suspend the
application, as the company had made
no previous entry.
A contest was then started as against
Owen, Schelier. Mackenzie, Cole, Matt
Arnerich and Paul Arnerich, who were
endeavoring to prove up, and a new hear
ing was ordered from Washington.
At the trial, which lasted several
months, a large number of witnesses were
examined. Testimony was given by min
ing experts from all over the United
States.
The decision just rendered shows all the
land in dispute to be a?ricultural land; in
fact, at the tresent time over 100 acres of
it is in a nigh state of cultivation. The
decision applies to only the six claimants
against whom a contest was made.

SAN JOSE, Cal., March 9.â During the
past week Chief of Police Kidward has
waged a relentless war on tin-horn gam
blers, touts and dissolute characters of all
description, and over sixty of this class of

MA BIN'S CONTESTED ELECTION.
Judge Angelotti Decides That Supervisor-
Elect Ring Is Entitled to Hold
Office.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., March 9.â Superior
Judge Frank M. Angelotti has ren
dered a decision in the contested election
case of Aaolph Sylva against George E.
Ring in favor of the contestee, Ring.
The case has excited considerable in
terest throughout political ci r cles in tne
State of California and the decision of
Judge Angelotti, which was handed
down to-day, has been eagerly awaited.
At tne general election held last Novem
ber, Sylva was the Democratic nominee
for Supervisor in District 3 in Marin
County, comprising the townÂ«hipsof San
aalito and Bolinas. Ring (R.) defeated
Sylva by thirty-two vote 3 and Sylva riled
a contest in the Superior Court, claiming
that in lie booths at Mill Valley and
Bolmas the election officers had not com
plied with the law and that Kin : had
grossly violated the purity of election law.
A recount of the votes resulted in increas
ing Ring's plurality by two, making it
thirty-four.
Evidence was then introduced by both
contestant and contestee that the purity
law had been violated. After considera
ble sensational testimony had been given
a stipulation was agreed to between the
contending parties to withdraw this testi
mony and submit the matter to the court
upon evidence whicu had been introduced
in regard to violations of the election laws
oy the officers in the precincts of Bolinas.
"It is well settled," says Judge An
gelotti in his decision, "that a departure
from the directory provision will not ren
der an election void, in the absence of a
further snowing that the result of the
election has been changed on the rights of
the voters injuriously affected thereby.
If, however, tne departure from the strict
compliance with the directory provisions
is such that it may be easily ami satis
factorily snown that there was no fraud
and that the result could not have been
affected thereby, and tne showing is made,
the voie will not be rejected."
In conclusion Judge Angelotti says:
"It may not be improi er to remark ltiat
a literal conformance to the requirements
or the law governing elections, so far as
the same is practicable, is much 10 be de
sired, not only lor ihe purpose of securing
a correct expression of the desires of the
voters, but also to prevent the creation of
a suspiciou of fraud that might result in
the setting aside of the will of the ma
jority."
Mr. Sylva must also be taxed the costs
of the proceedings. He said to-day that
it was his intention to appeal to the Su
preme Court.

SAUSALITO, Cat,., March 9.â The pool
rooms are to be opened in Sausalilo, and
despite the fact that there is a town ordi
nance against such operations the repre
sentatives of the dens of thievery have
been in town making arrangements to
conduct their illegal business. The most
profound secrecy is bein^ maintained,
and persons possessing information are
reluctant to divulge the plans of the pool
sellers. Nevertheless, it has been learned
that two places situated in desirable loca
tions on Water street, near the North Pa
cific Coast Railroad's ferry landing, have
been selected, and here tne poolmen in
tend to carry on their "commission busi
ness" in opposition to the State and town
laws.
One of the places selected is in the rear
of the Buffalo Hotel, on Water street,
which is one of the resorts where the pool
sellers held forth during the months of
May and June of last year, wnen, through
the vigorous prosecution which the town
officials, backed by the Trustees and the
law-abiding citizens of Sausalito, pursued,
they were final iy forced to pack their De
longings and leave the vicinity.
It is said that Harrison & Co., who oc
cupied this place last year, leased the rear
room. A visit to the place to-day "revealed
the fact that all the paraphernalia in use
last year remain. The blackboards are
in place, and the wire cage in whic i the
ca'-hier and teiegrap h operators have their
places has not been removed, and is ready
for occupancy at any time.
The other place for which negotiations
are now pending is the Barrios building,
opposite the depot on Water street. Cor
bett & Co. occupied this place lest year,
before they were run out ot town. The
lease has not as yet been s'gned, but nego
tiations are pending, and a settlement
will be arrived at within a few days.
Joseph H. Pryor, Town Clerk and Re
corder of Sausalito, said to-day: "i under
stand it is the intention of the poolroom
proprietors to again undertake to estab
lish themselves in Sausalito. In fact, cer
tain poolmen have informed me that they
intend to return shortly. What action
will be taken on the part of the Trusiees
and the prosecuting officers of the town,
I am not at this tim* prepared to say."
REDDING MUnDER TRIAL.
Plea of Hereditary Insanity Advanced in
Behalf of John Sutherland's
Slayer.
REDDING, Cal., March 9.â The closing
chapter in the trial of Miles E. Peterson,
charged with raur.ler, is being enacted in
the Superior Court, and to-morrow the
celebrated case will go to the jury which
will decide Peterson's fate.
The plea of insanity was set up by the
defense. Experts from Napa and Stock
ton have testified that beyond a doubt
Peterson was insane at the time the crime
was committed ; while, on the other hand,
experts from Sacramento have testified
that he was not insane. It was shown
that both his father and his mother were
insane at the time of their death, and that
other members of his family had suffered
from mental disease. All through the
trial the defendant lias been in a dejected,
melancholy state, -carcely speaking or
moving his head. His two brotliers have
been constantly at his sid*>.
The crime for which Peterson is being
trie.i was the killing of John Sutherland
at Castella last August. Jealousy was
said to have been the immediate cauÂ«e of
the act. Peterson secreted himself in a
barn and shot Sutherland to death. After
Sutherland fell Pete-son shot four bullets
into his body. He afterward went to the
hotel, replaced his rifle and toot a parting
farewell of the young lady of whom he
was insanely jealous. He did not resist
arrest and from ail appearances was ut
terly ignorant as to the severity of his
crime.

Champion Watson Recommends
Paine' s Celery. V
Professional Alhletcs Finds This Rem-
edy Invalnlible in the Spring.
Brings Fresh Blood and Regulates the
Whole Xenons System.
It is useless to attempt to compare any
other remedy with Paine's celery com-
pound.
Paine's celery compound is another sort
of thins* entirely from any substitute that
was ever handed over a counter.
It puts fresh blood into the shrunken
veins, regulates the expenditure of nerv-
ous energy, and positively cures general
nervous debility and such specific nervous
disorders as neuralgia, sleeplessness, mel-
ancholia, hysteria, headaches, lassitude â
in a word, Paine's celery compound is
able to soundly build up the nervous sys-
tem and make it healthy and active.
Amon r the testimonials received last
month by the proprietors of Paine's celery
compound was the following:
Boston-. Feb. 8, 1897.
Gentlemen: The strongest of athletes
sometimes feels languid and drawn out.
I have often found myself feeling so, more
especially in the spring before the outdoor
season begins. I have tried "many things,
but have found nothing that (toes me so
much good as Paint's celery compound.
I say this with much pleasure. Respect-
fully yours, J- P- Watson.
Mr. Watson is the world's professional
champion jumper and pole vanlter. He

Not long ago Hj-*nberg, the champion

had been of great benefit to him, and said f
that he wished to recommend the remedy /
to other?. . ]

BRUTALLY SLAIN
Killed Because He Refused
Liquor to Intoxicated
Visitors.
Beaten and Tortured Before His
Life Is Cut Short by His
Tormentors.
Two Men Whose Guilt Is Almost
Certain Captured by Shasta's
Sheriff.
REDDING, Cal., March 9 âThe most
cold-blooded murder in the annals of
Shasta County crimes was committed last
night at a spot one mile from Newtown, a
small mining town located seven miles
north of Redding, in the Old Dijeins dis
trict. Seralino Genignani, an laiian, 52
years ol ase, was the victim.
Genignani was a miner and by hard
labor had succeeded in laying by a consid
erable store of worldly goods'. Besides his
mining he had planted a small vineyard
and carried on wine-mak;ng on a small
scale. The income he denvecl from the
sa!e of h'.s wine was sufficient to afford
him a good living, and his mining opera
tions enabled him to add to his hoard
each month. He was frugal, industrious
and peaceable, and was respected ai a good
citizen in his neighborhood.
Two of Genignani's neighbors who were
in the habit of wbiling away their even-
Ing hours at his home, called at his place
at 9 o'clock last night, and as they en
tered the door a horrible sight met their
gaze. The floor was besmirched with
blood. A knife lay in one corner and
there were other evidences of a desperate
struggle. These neighborsâ o. C. Alex
ander and John Rolandâ began to investi
gate. They could see by the aid of a
lantern the footprints of two men leading
from the house, and aeconipanyiug them
a broader trail, as though a body had
been drgaeed. Following this for about
seventy-five feet, they came to a panel
fence, and there, in a pool of his life
blood, lay poor Genignani, cold in death.
His whiskers had been roughly cut off, as
if with a knife, his throat was cut irom
ear to ear, there was a deep gash over his
right eye and another across the back of
his head ana a deep cut or stab just above
the center of the breastbone.
The searchers left the body at the fence
and proceeded back to the house, where
they picked up the knife with which the
murder had been committed. They then
sent word to officer? in this city. Their
message reached here about 1 o'clock this
morning. Shortly thereafter Sheriff Hous
lon and a deputy left fur the -cene and at
7 o'clock Coroner Earnest and Dr. Mitchell
went out.
A clew was obtained ar.d at 2 o'clock to
day the Sheriff returned with itro Drison
ers against Â«vhom the strongest kind of
evidence has been obtained. They are
Alexander Miller, an ex-convict, and
Lewis Kichards. They were io 'geri in the
County jail pending an examination.
Ttie details Â»>f me murder, as far as the
Sheriff was able to learn, are that Miller
ana Richards, in company with a 15-vear
old lad named Young, had been st Uenig
iiani's piace early in the evening, drink
ing wine and having a generally jjood
time. They left the Italian's house and
proceeded to Newtown, where they drank
more liquor. At about 8 o'clock they re
turned to Genijinani's and asked ior more
w:ne.
The Italian refuted their request. They
knocked him to the floor, beat him, cut
hi- whiskers off and finally killed him.
They then dragged his body from the
house and as iar as the fence, where it
was lound. There they left it and pro
ceeded to the house of Miller. At this
house the two were arrested. They of
fered no resistance. Their clothing and
shoes were blood-stained, and other facts
point directly to their guilt. The lad
Y->ung was also brought in as a witness.
For some months past Genignani had
been troubled by persons who persistently
tried to force an entrance to his house at
nit-'ht, at.a time and aga;n he has applied
to the courts for warran :a for t Me arrest of
the disturbers, bat not being able to iden
tify them con M o nothine.

able abs;ncÂ« of J. A. Herr.e, who was to
have been present to deliver an a .dress.
Among the speakers of the evening
were the president, L M. Manzer, Vice-
Presidant Pleace, Mr. Lynch, Dr. Brown,
Rev. Mr. David, J. Reynolds and Joseph
Leggett.
President Manzer tersely conveyed the
gospel of his party in the words: "We
know what we want and we know how to
get it. We don't want much; we only
want the earth. ''
Mr. Pieace explained the iniquities of
the mortgage system from a sin le-tax
standpoint, and commented on the atu
pidny of placing obstacles in the pathway
of those who seek to develop the resources
of nature.
Mr. Reynolds presented a verbal report
of the pr'Â»gresi of the campaign in Sacra
mento, ana afterward corrected a few mis
conceptions as to the meaning 01 single
tax.
"Single tax," he said, "is not a land
question, but a rent question, and what
we want is a mire equhable distribution
of the rents arising irom land values."
Incidentally he referred to the present
distress in San Francisco, and in th â¢ same
connection said: "The Soring Vailey
Water Workiand Mr. Stitro must derive
a good deal of amusement from the spec a
cle of our business men paying for the
piivilege of improving their property. In
tue n..me of sweet charity, we are going to
give the unemployed a doi:ar a day to
build a 'uoiilev.ird through Mr. Sutro's and
the company's tarren sandhills to en
hance their value. And this is charity."
Mr. Leggett spoke in favor of completer
freedom and denounced the protective
spir.t. "A little competition," said he,
"in the shtpe of the Valley road, did
more to reduce freiglic rates than all the
railway commissions could ever do."
"THE TUB."
A New Albany Corporation and Its
Or gin.
Among the organizations recently in
corporated at Albany was one which bears
the oad name, "The Tub," and to those
who do not live in that city, or who have
not passed a winter there, the name must
tjeem most strange. But to him who has
climbed the hills of Albany daring the
time when ice and snow make the occupa
tion more exhilarating than pleasant, in
the months when the meeting of the Leg
islature increases the population of Cap
.ltol Hill and addÃ new life to the board
ing-houses which manage to exist between
sessions, to him the name "Tub" suggeste
' the bathing establishment in State street
where residents of Albany take Turkish
and Russian baths, and where members
of the Legislature have been known to re
tire for rest and refreshment alter hard
work which was not of a strictly legis
lative character. In Albany everybody
knows tire proprietor of the establishment.
"Garry" Bensen has served nis time as
a swimming teacher, as a renter of boats
in the "basin"; he has won distinction as
a life-saver, and when the boy became a
man he developed into a politic'an with
aspirations toward office in the Lscislature
during the months when the staid and
sedate atmosphere became impregnated
with the wit and wisdom which go with
the average legislator. His ambition has
been rewarded, and 'Garry" Bensen, who
is known to his townspeople as the man
who taught Grover Cleveland and many
others how to swim, is known to the vis
itor as the Senatorial sergeant-at-armsand
the keeper of ihe "Tub. "
His "Tub," from which the new associ
ation takes its name, is not on the water's
edge, as its name might suggest, but on
the broad street which leads to thÂ« Capi
tol, and was once one of Â»he fashionable
residences of the city. Besides the vari
ous Einds of baths the place contains
bachelor apartments, in which scenes
have been enacted when they were occu
pied by newspaper men and clerks con
nected with the various departments
which would have given the writer of
roaring farces much good working ma
terial.
There men have gone to write their
"9tories" because it was a quiet place and
because ihey could write there undis
turbed, and there, after their worn was
done, they would go to bed, only to be
drapged out by a self-aurointed com
mittee on Indian affairs and forced to
take a plunge bath, deÂ«pite their assur
ances that they could worry along until
morning, at least, without immersion.
One of the characters of the institution
is a yellow dog. said to be from the ken
nels of Senator Edwnrd Murnhy. He
answers to the name "Tub." He stands
around knowingly when tiie regular
boarders take their morning plunge and
he follows the inmates to the Capitol,
where betakes it Upon himself to keep
the messenger boys raoviner. When he
sees one coming or going lie jumps at his
heels, ana until he get? out of the dog's
reach the messenser is likely to move
quickly.
A recent story about Bensen shows that
maturity has not robbed him of his spirit
of fun. Among other sources of income
irom the Tub is that which comes from
ba'hing dou-s. A woman came to the place
a short time asto with a pet poodle. "The
dog is young," she said, "but I want to
have you teach him how to swim. Do you
think he will learn?" Garry looked wise
and said that tie "supposed the dog could
be taught." Terms were agreed upon and
the doc came for his first lesson the next
day. He was thrown into a bathtub wiih
no'more ceremony than a committee would
show toward a too temperate or a too in
dustrious companion, and a report was
sent to the woman that her dog was doing
nicely, and with so and so many addi
tional lessons at a certain amount lor
each lesson he would certainly learn to
swim. And now the woman shows the
poodle to her friends as the successful puÂ»
pil of "Garry" Bensen.
One of (he organizers of the new club,
"The Tub," is prominently connected
with the historical department of the
State of New York, but the society was
not formed for the pursuit of historical re
search.âNew York Tribune.
THE OLDEST POSTMASTER.
Joseph Strode Has Handled Letters for
Fifty-Six Years.
The oldest postmaster in continuous
service in the United States lives in Cen
tral Pennsylvania. His name is Joseph
Strode, and he lives at Strodes Millf, a
pretty village in M.fflin Count}*.
This old pioneer postmaster, says the
Cresson Record, has held the. one position
since 1545, and still holds it at the present i
time, although lie is now in his eighty
first year. As a recognition of his long
and laithful service for the Government,
the Postoffice Department at Washington !
had his picture on exhibition at the
World's Jtair, and it was considered one of
the most interesting features of that great
department.
Sirodes Mills is a quaint, old-fashioned
village si;uated in the heart cf M*ffl:n
county. Th country surrounding it is
rich in farming lands and valuable ore
and sand mines. Although the place la
over a century old its inhabitants only
number 200. The people are mostly well- j
to-do, and ever since the establishment of
the village the lands have passed down
from one generation to another, and very
seldom has it been that these banded
down properties have gone out of the fam
ily possession. They are a happy race of
people, contented with their lot, and sel
dom if ever bothering the outside world.
They are in reality a world to themselves,
and as such but little is ever heard of
them outside of their village limits.
In 1839 Arthur Strode received the ap
poimment of postmasier, during Martin
Van Buren's administration and contin
ued in office until his ueath in Angtist,
1845. Joseph Strode, tne present post
master, was made his assistant in 1840,
and at his death received the appoint
ment, through Cave Johnson, Postmaster-
General under President Puik. For the
last ten years his aon, Amor A. Sirode,
has been his assistant.â Pittsburg Dis

The unemployed realized about $150
last niebt from their theatrical entertain

The house wos not very large, but a very
nice class of people was present and there
was nothing except the remarkable num
ber and diversity of acts presented to in
dicate that there was anything unusual
about the occasion or the purpose of the
show.
It was 8 variety performance made up
of as many variations as there were par
ticipants. There was everything, from a
clever acrobatic feat along through songs,
dances and recitations to things that were
simply interesting because they were sur
prisingly inane. There were some good
act?, some tolerable acts, and some that
would not have been endured elsewhere.
Bat everything went and everything was
applauded, from the efforts of the pretty
baby girl lancers to the men made up as
imrossible tramps or Indians.

Davies, vice-president of the unemployed
and one of the well-appearing men who
composed the corps of attendants and
ushers, appeared before the footlights and
made an address in which he told briefly
of the object and the inception of the
benefit for the unemployed and the relief
and the generosity they have met with.
In the forenoon'here was a parade of
the unemployed, 400 strong, through the
principal downtown streets and out r.a far
as Van Ness avenue, the object belnc by
means of appropriate banners to adver
tise the evening's entertainment.
The boulevard fund yesterday passed
the $5000 mark, the amount being now
$5233, but this is very much slower than
the committees hoped the coll ctions
would be made. In two or three days
some men may be put to work
on the job, ex-Mayor Sutro hav
ing yesterday given a right of way
under specified conditions through his
property, and the committee having
agreed to the condtions which Â»tate that
the boulevard must be completed in
eighteen months and no sew rs must be
laid in the street durine the first five
year?. The deeds are in escrow.

Adolph Sutro yesterday told theg ttre t
Committee of the Board of Supe rv i 80ra
that he would have a deed prepare^ with
out any conditions included for the strip
of land thmugh his possessions f or t ne
boulevard. He said that he did not wish
to make a gift which should entail upon
him any great expense. He would give
an unconditional deed, trusting to the
Board of Supervisors not to compel him
to construct a sewer.
RED MEN TO HELP.
Will Give a Lecture In Aid of the
Unemployed Men.
The committee of the Red Men of the
Improved Orderappointed to devise means
to assist the Citizens' Committee in raisin?
funds for the relief of the unemployed met
in ihe Alcazar building on Tuesday night,
and it was reported that 3000 tickets hud
been printed and that 2100 had tieen dis
tributed to the various tribes. These are
for admission to a lecture on the "Abor
ieines of America, 1 ' to be delivered on the
24: 1 i tost in Metropolitan riall by Profes
sor Frank J. Polley of Stanford Univer
sity.
It was also reported that the committee
on talent had been on the trail of several
well-known elee clubs and that there is
reason to believe that they wiJl volunteer
their services for the occasion.
The Boulevard Heads.
Mayor Phelan, Attorney Lloyd and the
Street Committee discussed the matter.
Mr. Lloyd said that Mr. Sutro would put
the deed in escrow ia the Nevada Bank
and that he was willing to extend the
time for the completion of the work to
five years. Whenever, In the judgment
of the Mayor, the boulÂ»vard shall be com
pleted the deed may be placed on record.
He also desired that red rock should be
used upon the part of the boulevard do
nated by him, and offered to give the rock
nee ssary for the macadamizing free of
cost. Tiie boulevard must be 100 feet
wide.
This proposition met with the approval
of the Street Commltt'e, of Mayor Pheian
and City and County Attorney Creswell.
The deed will be prepared at once and
will be submitted to Mr. Creswell. who
will report upon it ta the Street Commit
tee. Very likely the deed will be ap
proved this week, when the last obstacle
in the way of beginning work will hav6
been removed.

ALL THE WAY PROM KENTUCKY.
Wonderful Title Related by a Citizen of
the Blue-Grass Region.
Lexington has a citizen who must be
trying to beat the record of baron Mun
chausen as a prevaricator. His name is
Jerome B. Frazier, and here is a sample of
his soaring fancy taken from the Lexing
ton Argonaut:
"I am very fowl of domestic animals
and lowls, and the possesor of a fine intel
ligent fox-terrier, who answers to the
name of Fanny. I attended a sale some
months ago and bought a Poland duck. I
brought her home and put her among the
other poultry in the yard. In a few days
I noticed that Fanny and Miis Poland
were on good terms with each other, and
in a few week* they were inseparable. Fin
ally Miss Poland thought she had loafed
long enough and went to setting. Fanny
made regular visits to her and seemed to
take treat interest in the proceed
ing. The duck rarely left her nest.
After setting for about a week she
sickened and died. Fanny seemed
almost heartbroken over the untimely
death of her friend. The evening of hor
death I missed Fanny from ncr accus
tomed place in the yard and began a
search for her. I found her in the duck's
nest with the eg s underneath her. The
next morning I visited the poultry-house
end found Fanny still covering the egcs.
1 concluded not to disturb her, but await
results. This continued for some weeks,
and at the end of the usual time allowed
for incubation I found that six lively little
ducks had become citizens of the
poultry yard. Fanny seemed very proud
of her success as an incubator. "The lit
tle ducks followed her, and seemed to
know no difference between Fanny and
a barnyard fowl. The strangest part
of this story yet remains to be
told. Fanny is a remarkable ratter, and
these little ducks developed into the finest
rat-killers that I ever saw. lam willing
to match th-se six duck-* against six ter
riers for from $100 to $1000 a side in a rat
killing contest, and I will win the match. 1 '

which is to go to the informer and the
other half to the county in which the

HAS RETURNED
FROM ROSSLAND
S. F. Loughborough on the
Richness and Singular
Order of the Camp.
Nobody Is Allowed to Carry
Weapons and There Are
No Homicides.
Ha Predicts That in F.ve Years There
Will Bj Several Towns as
Large as Butte.
S. F. Loughborough of this City, who
was for years a member of the Texas
rangers and afterward Stienff of one of
the border counties in New Mexico, has
arriveil here, after three months' absence
at Rossland, B. C, where he has for some
time past been interested in mining. He
is part owner in six properties there, and
of these three are shipping ore and more
than paying expenses.
Mr. Loughborough believes that in five
years there will be a number of towns in
that part of British Columbia, any one of
which will surpass Butte, Montana, in
population. Of these, Rossland, New
Denver and Trail City are a few. He says
the mineral is widely distributed and is
so rich as to surprise him, thoneh for
years he has been familiar with mining.
Another thinjr that has won his greatest
admiration is the way the law is observed
in that part of the country. Although
Rossland has some SOOO inhabitants there
is but one man to preserve order. He is
the Chief of Police, Constable. Sheriff and
Town Marshal, all in one. Nobody ques
tions his power. I*, is absolute.
No revolver or other weapon is allowed
to be carried by any one. There are no
Homicides. Ladies may walk about at any
time unaccompanied by escorts and never
hear a word directly or indirectly that
might offend or even seem harsh. There
is no profanity among the miners or others
when on the streets. It is the most or
derly camp he ever saw.
"When I siwall this." said Mr. Lough
borough â "saw how ndmirably ihelaws
were executed and reflected that the ciiy
was but three years old and was in a great
stretch of new country filled by men from
all parts of the globe â it seemed to me
phenomenal. I could not help but have a
high opinion of British justice and Brit
ish law when I thought how different it
was in similar places in the United States
and in San Francisco. I felt like becom
ing a citizen of Great Britain much as I
had hitherto depreciated thatcuuntry.
"I don't know but I will do it yet. It
made my biood boil and made me feel
ashamed of my country when as 1 came
away from Rossland on the stage and had
i^acned North port (on the American side,
only seven miles away) the first thing I
saw was a man chasing another one with
a pun.
"The country is one of the richest I
ever saw. 1 was surprised at the number
of paying properties. There is no intem
perance. Everything is carried on in or
der and with entire safety to everybody."
Mr. Loughborough will probably be
here several weeks. He is at the Grand.
DEATH OP A GEEAT HUNTER.
A Slayer of Tigers and Elephants Suc
cumbs in Cochin-China.
A great hunter has just died in Cochin*
China, where he lived lor the past twenty
seven years. His name was Wetzel. He
was an Alsatian. During the war of 1870
he served in a French regiment of cuiras
siers, and at the close of the war he asked
to be sent to Cochiu-China. riis request
was granted, and he was employed in that
country as gamekeeper. Soon he became
famous by his exploits. His bunting
record, which he used to snow with pride,
loots up 89 elephants, 30 tigers, 21 panth
ers, 5 rhinoceroses, about 20 wild buffaloes
and an immense number of bear.-*, deers,
etc. The natives heid him in great ven
eration on account of the services which
he rendered to them.
At one time two tigers carried away
some persons in the neighborhood of Tay
ninh. On being notified ot the fact by
the authorities Weizel set out in the
night to hunt them. Concealing himself
in one of the haunts of the beasts he shot
them down one after the other. He
never used any stratagems; all his hunt
ing was done in a bold and daring fash
ion, and more than once lie came near
losing his lite. One day while hunting
buffaloes he was c.iarged by a bull. The
natives are more afraid of a bull buffa o
than they are of a tiger. Wetsel was
knocked down and pawed by the brute.
He pretended to be dead. His rifle
escaped from his hand as he fell. Slowly
he dragged himself up to it. To seize it,
shoulder it and lodge a bullet in trie head
of hi 3 adversary was the matter of an in
stant. He was confined to li is bed for a
long time after that adventure. On an
other occasion a wounded tiper bounded
upon him and struck him with her claws
in the face, inflicting a serious wound,
but he killed the beast. The traces of the
wound could be plainly seen on his face.
In a rough-and-tumble fight v.'ith a pan
ther his leit shoulder was bailiy lacerated,
but he managed to plunge his hunting
knife into the panther's heart.
His death was the result of sunstroke.
His numerous friends are about to erect a
monument to him, which will recall his
exploits as a soldier, an elephant-hunter,
a tiger-hunter and an all-round man with
a gun. â Courrier dcs Etats-Ums.
America's Bichegt Woman.
A woman past 50, who has had her
share of youthful good looks, may, if she
keeps her health, retain that essential
part of her attractiveness wnich consists
in character and expression. Such is the
caÂ»e witti Hetty Green. Time has touched
her gently, withal. Her hair is not
yet quite gray, nor her face wrinkled.
Sue has keen blue-^ray eyes, a clear com
plexion, and strongly marked leatures
that indicate truly the force and determi
nation behind them. In repose, her ex
pression becomes softened, and she looks
like the home-loving and domestic woman
that she is at heart. Mrs. Green has the
reputation, not altogether unde
served of being a bad dresser.
Tnis appears to be rather an
affectation, perhaps with a purpose on
her part rather than a deficiency of femi
nine taste. Her ordinary street attire
of rich but plain black, with a violet
trimmed bonnet, has nothing outre about
it. Her manner in talking about her
battles with courts and financiers is
fuil of aegres-ive animation, and gives
the impression that righting suits her
temperament. A peculiar picturesque
ness is imparted to her speech by the
traces of New England Quakerism that
c!ing to it. In moments ot forgetfulness
she says "yaas" almost as broadly as the
characters in a Yankee dialect story.â

MANY POOR BOYS
MAY BE EDUCATED
Sixty New Scholarships j
Created at the State
University.
Levi Strauss to Give $3500 a
Year and the State as
Much More.
College of Commerce May Be an Im
portant Branch of tbe University.
Olher Business.
Levi Strauss of this City will give the
University of California $3500 a year to be
used in scholarships for the maintenance
in college of poor students. He made the
offer yesterday to the board of regents and
it was accepted with applause.
It was submitted in conjunction with a
plan for a legislative bill creating an
annual fund of $3500 to maintain what
shall be known as the State of California
scholarships, providing aid to not more
than twenty-eight especially deserving
students each year.
These combined funds aside from all
privately endowed scholarships, such as
those recently created by Mrs. Phebe
Hearst, will maintain at Berkeley over
lifty stddents in the undergraduate
courses. The twenty-eight State of Cali
tornia scholarships are intended to be
apportioned among the seven Congres
sional districts of the State, to be filled by
the lour most worthy applicants from
each district.
In addition to these State of California
scholarships and the Levi Strauss scholar
ships, all for undergraduate students,
there are to be seven graduate scholar
ships, each yielding to the holder $250 a
year. They will after their creators be
named as follows, and will be filled by
one lrom each of the seven Congressional
districts:
Student's graduate scholarship, an al
umni graduate scholarship, a faculty
graduate scholarship and four regents'
graduate scholarships.
Of more future significance perhaps than
these liberal provisions for poor students
was a plan submitted by Regent Arthur
Ropers for the consideration of the board.
He would have created in the University
of California a college of commerce, and
he has given the subject to his fellow re
gents to think about. His idea, first sug
gested over a dozen years ago in a com
mencement address he delivered at Berke
ley, contemplates the establishment of a
school for the scientific !<tudy of trade, of
finance, of all manner of commercial re
lations between this country and others
to wnich it exports goods or from which it
gets supplies.
The idea would mean that nere at the
greatest Pacific seaport of America, and one
of the great commerce centers of the world,
would be trained the specialists in trade
relations that would be the business ad
visers and experts for great mercantile
houses. It would, Mr. Rogers thinks,
naturally lead up to the establismeni of a
college of diplomacy tor the instruction of
future consuls to foreign ports, where to
have a skillful observer and planner of
trade would result in a great advantage to
this country.
Therre is no such school at present ex
cepting, Mr. Rogers says, a small affair at
the University of Pennsylvania, but he
sees no reason why if there be colleges of
agriculture and colleges of mechanical
arts there should not also in this State,
with its manifold interests and resources
and commercial advantages, be a college
of commerce.
BLevi Strauss' offer of funds for annual
scholarships was made hi the following
letter:
Kegeai J. B. Reinnteinâ Dear Sib: I have
notaii in the newspapers that while the Legis
lature was considering the bill to increase the
income of the University of California a sug
gestion was made to set apart $3500 per an
num to aid worthy and poor students from
escli of the Congressional districts of the State
to obtain an education at that university.
I should be pleased to be permitted to du
plicate the generosity of the State in the mat
ter of said scholarships, and request you
kindly to communicate the terms of this letter
to the Honorable the Board of Regents of the
university.
The University of California hag already
risen to a plane that challenges the admira
tion of the entire country, and I deem it a
privilege to aid those connected therewith.
The proper officers are hereby authorized to
draw on me each year, until further notice,
for the sum of $3500. <I am, dear sir, yours
very truly, Levi Strauss.
A petition was submitted from the
members of the senior class at Berkeley
asking for the surplus that will remain
from their long deposited diploma fees
after their graduating certificates shall
have been paid for. It will amount to
about $300, and the class of '97 wants it as
a matter of principle, and especially be
cause the class is more heavily burdened
by debts thnn any other lot of seniors that
ever worried at Berkeley over the un
certainty of graduation and the expenses
of a last year in college. President Kel
locg was inclined to favor the plea on the
ground that public sentiment demands
absolutely fr'e tuition in the university.
Each student upon entering at Berkeley
deposits $10 to pay the cost of his diploma
four years hence. Latterly, with clnsses
of several hundred students, the amount
and interest o! the diploma fund has
amounted to a sura at graduation consid
erably greater than the cust of diplomas,
Judging from the fact that at Stanford
University each student at the time of his
graduation is charged only $1 50 as the
actual cost of his sheepskin. The whole
matter was referred to the finance com
mittee, as its settlement would establish
a precedent upon which succeeding classes
would rely.
Beginnin? with July monthly salaries
tvill be paid by tbe university not until
the 10th of the month succeeding the ser
vice rendered, instead of on the Ist of
the month, according to the present rule.
Provision was made for the publication
by the Lick Observatory of 1000 octavo
volumes of a history of the earthquakes of
the Pacific Coast.
Upon the recommendation of the archi
tects and others connected with the con
struction of the Affiliated Colleges build
ings a bill ot $5780 for construction was
passed upon favorably.
James Kennedy Moffitt, a er.idnate from
Berkeley in the clafs of JBS<>, has given
$100 for the purchase of books lor the uni-
Yersity library, and purposes to give a
like sum each year for a similar purpose.
Regent Dcnicke reported an abnormal
and unaccountable increaseiu theamount
of water usrd in and about tbe college
buildings at Berkeley, and janitors and
professors are to be cautioned not to per
mit water to run to waste.
A report lrom the attorney of the board,
John B. Mhoon, gave the opinion that it
would not be improper to pay a professor
a salary during his absence from the uni
versity, for by so doing valuable so-called
non-resident professors might be obtained
ior short courses of insiruction.
Regent Reinstein called the attention of
the board to the necessity of providing
some temporary buildings at Berkeley in
anticipation of a large freshman class next
fall that may be expected to overcrowd
the present meager accommodations. He
eujrgested at least one two-story frame
building with twelve recitation-rooms.
The subject was referred to the committee
on grounds and plans, which will report
at the next meeting of the board, a month
hence.
It was reported that the bill now before
the Legislature to give to university mili
tary cauets the same privileges and im
munities accorded members of the
National Guard has passed its second
reading in the Senate.
Regent John E. Budd, seconded by ReÂ»
gent Houghton, recommended the ap
pointment as military instructor at Berke
ley of Lieutenant Sydney Cloman, but it
was decided to make a special investiga
tion of the records of all the candidates
for the vacancy. Regent Budd also gave
notice that al the next meeting of the
Board of Regents he will move to re
scind the cboice of the board of San Fran
cisco as the site for the Wilmerding
School because no site has been offered
by tiiis City. To this suggestion Judge
Wallace took exception and declared that
he had voted for San .Krancisio because
the evidence of witnesses had proved that
here the donor intended the school should
be.
A letter was immediately read from the
Merchants' Association asking for a con
ference with a committee from the R?
fcents on the matter of having a site of
fered for the Wilmerding School.
It was decided to fix the salary of the
secretary of the Board of Regents at $225
a month, with the understanding that as
:n the case of the Jat<* Secretary Bonte,
who finally received $275 a month, it be
increased as a reward ior efficiency. The
office is now vacant.
POOLROOMS MUST GO.
The Supreme Court Sustains Judge Wai-
lace and KstublUho* the Validity
of the New Ordinance.
The proprietors of poolrooms seem to
have met their Waterloo.
Yesterday the Supreme Court refused to
grant the release of John Glynn, under
sentence of paying $100 fine or spending
as many days in jail for running a pool
room at Mission and Fiftn street?. The
case came up on the action of Judge Wal
lr.ee in overruling an appeal made from a
judgment of Police Judge Campbell.
In order to bring the matter belore the
Supreme Court Glynn's attorney applied
for a writ of habeas corpus.
It was denied. Exit the attorney, who
lost no time in hastening to the City Hall
and having his client's fine paid.
This action of the Supreme Court, being
final, settles the mooted question as to
the authority of the Board oi Supervisors
to pass police regulations.

Opinion seems to be about evenly di

in Jose. In this City Z egler is favored,
and his record on the National circuit, as
compared with McFarlaud's, is brought
forward to show that he outclasses his man.
It will be a hotly contested match and
victory will mean much to the winner.
Chief Consul Kerrigan has called a meet
ing of the board o! officers of the North

The diffeiences between the Velodrome
Company and the San Francisco Amuse

sanction from R. M. Welch of the racing
board yesterday to conduct a three weeks'
meet at the Pavilion, from March 20 to
April 10. Manager Shafer has wired
all tbe prominent racing men to come
here for these races, and there will so:>n
be a big influx of racing talent. Michael,
the Weish wonder, will arrive some day
this week. As he has a habit ol dropping
into places unawares, his exact coming is
uncertain.
A WAYWARD GIEL
I.eonl Davolles Sold Her Mother's Fur
niture to Get Montjr for Liquor.
Leoni Davolles, 16 years of age, was sent
to the Magdalen Asylum yestereay by
Judge Campbell. Leoni, although young,
has developed an insatiable thirst for
liquor, and to provide herself with funds
she used to steal things from her mother's
honse at 33 Chenery street and oell them.
. Monday afternoon her mother left home
for n few hour*, and during her absence
Leoni got an expressman to convey all tbe
furniture in the house to a second-band
store on Pacific street, where she sold it
for a few dollars.
She was arrested by Corporal Shanahan,
who turned her over to Secretary Kane of
the Pacific Coast Society for the Suppres
sion of Vice. The motner was in court
yesterday and oflered to take care of the
girl, but the Judjte thought that the Mag

her.
A Young Girl Drunkard,
Some time ego the lather of Leonie Dorolles,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 1897.
MARTY BERGEN
ON TOP AGAIN
He Gets Pecksniff Home
Before a Big Field
of Platers.
The Win of the Horse Was the
Feature of the After
neon's Racing.
Four Favorites F.nished First at
Emeryvilleâ Mainstay Downed
Sallie Clicquot
When Jockey Marty Borgen finished
first on his unlucky horse Pecksniff, the
lukewarm choice for the opening event at
Emeryville track yesterday, he must have
thought that afier all a forgetful public
still retains in its heart a soft place for a
or.cc great rider whose luster has become
dimmed by age.
Marty was some years ago the idol of
Guttenbere racegoers, and hisjgrand work
in the saddle made him the desired of all
riders. With success also came wealth,
and Marty could live in a sandstone front
and amoke "Africanas" without ever
throwing a leg over a horse, but his lovo
for the saddle clings to him as fly paper to
a corner grocery store lounger's trousers.
To him a ride with the colors on is worth
more than a French dinner to a tramp.
Time after time Bergen has landed
Pecksniff inside the coin, but never, that
Is of late, first. Yesterday the son of imp.
Mr. Pickwick was a 3 to 1 choice over a
field of grouse and when Marty cot his
horse in front below the furlong pole from
home and finally landed him winner by
fully five lengths, the ovation he received
was second only to the one tendered Pres
dent McKinley at his inauguration. For
once the Isapoleonic frown forsook his
features and in his spasm of ecstatic joy
Marty tbe grave tossed his cap in the air
in acknowledgment of the compliment.
Tae day was pleasant and the attend
ance larger than on the opening day.
The track, though, was very heavy and
the veteran mudlarks were in demand.
Four favorites managed to win at that
and the books were a^aln mulcted of a
small portion of their bank rolls.
The second race on the card was a four
furlong scramble lor members of the two
year-old division. Colonel Dan at first
opened an 8 to 5 choice, but later receded
\o iour, and Morano, r shapely daughter
of Morello, was backed down from 2 to 1
to even money. Colonel Dan made the
running into the stretch, where he ured
perceptibly as the wire was neared, and
the first cAoice downed him easily by
over three lengths in 53 seconds. The
Colonel should about win next time out.
The next event was a "dog" affair, ove*r
six furlongs, with Colonel Wneeler ruling
a 9 to 20 choice around post time. The
Colonel took the lead soon after the start,
and looked to have the race up his sleeve,
when Mrs. Shade came fas! and Jones was
compelled to ride the favorite hard to win
by a head. Koselle finished third.
A mile purse affair, with the weights
lowered 10 pounds below the scale, just
fitted Aquinas with 85 pounds up. Barney
Sctireiber's gelding opened in the betting
at Ito 3 and closed Ito 4. He waited on
Dun boy and Logan until well into the
stretch, where Clawson gave him his
hsad and he won hands down. Dunboy
looked to have the place secure at tbe
paddock, when he tired badly and was led
cut by the heavily played Logan.
About the hottest one tossed up the
board during the afternoon was St. Dis
taff, from Sam Hildreth's stable, a three
year-old colt by St. George. He was one
of six starters in the fifth event at seven
furlongs along with five other cheap
platers. Opening up at 7 to 5, he was
quickly hammered down to 4 to 5 and
evens. Adam Andrew, which opened up
at 7to 5, went back until the ring was
yelling out 4to 1. If it was surmised the
colt was a dead one, he proved very much
alive. Tafcine the lead after three fur

cleverly by a couple of lengths in 1:35%.
The "good thing" was beaten out hali a
length for the piace by Tulare, ridden by
Jones.
As on the preceding day Green Morris
furnished another warm favorite for the
final race on the card, a six-furlong sprint,
in Bailie Clicquot, which was extensively
supported at the snort price of 6 to 5.
The wise ones fancied Mainstay with 101
pounds up, and he carried a deal of coin
on his chances, the layers of odds giving
as eood as 5 to 1 against the big chestnut.
To Peixotto can perhaps be attributed the
downfall of the favorite. The pair raced
at a merry clip to the stretch, where Pig
gottsent Mainstay along and, soon taking
the lead, passed the judges a couple of
leneths clear of the Morris entry. Thorpe
got up with Senator Grady nearing tne
wire, and secured the short end of the

FISK'S DEAD HAND
ON THE DOLLARS
Even From His Grave
Ha Controls His Big
Fortune.
Children by ihs First Marriage
Cut Off With Very Small
Legacies.
As the Estate Is Worth About Half
a Million, a Will Contest Is
Probable.
The will of the late Asa Fisk has been
filed for probate and it is something of a
curiosity, as was to be expected. The
original will comprises twenty-five pages
of ciosely written matter, and there are
two codicils of four pages each.
Throughout the document is manifested
the natural solicitude of the testator for
the ultimate conservation of his dollars, to
the accumulation of which he devoted so
many anxious years.
In the first draft of the will Fisk de
manded th:it the executors should give
bonds iii the sum of $10,000 for the faithful
discharge of their duties, but a subsequent
codicil provides for the abrogation of this
condition, and asks that they be allowed
to 3erve without bonds.
That part pf the property belonging to
the deceased which is situated in the State
of Massachusetts is estimated to Da worth
about $50,000, and $15,000 of this is to be
distributed among the three children by
his first wife. Tho residuary legatees are
Mrs. Lydia FisK, widow of the decedent,
and their children, Arthur G. FisJt and
Mr?. Flora E. Wertheimer (nee Fisk),
share and share alike. Mrs. Fisk and Ar
tnur G. Fisk are named as executors,
without bonds, but they are compelled to
deposit the tunds of the estate in bank
whenever they hare more than $20 on
hand.
Minute instructions are given for the
management of the different properties,
irom the painting of houses and fences in
Boston to the paying of premiums on life
insurance policies in San Francisco. A
touch ol comedy is here inserted, when
the testator provides that said premiums
shall be paid from rents received from real
estate in Massachusetts; ar.d if that is not
sufficient, then the executors may borrow
money to pay the same "at a reasonable
rate of interest," which he suggests ought
not to exceed sor 6 per cent a year. The
laugh will come in when those who used
io pay him 5 per cent a month read this
interpretation of his opinion in regard to
a reasonable rate of interest.
Fisk saw so much sorrow caused by by
pothecating claims and expectancies in
the way of monetary transactions that he
gave strict orders against his children do
ing anything of the kind.
A great many siories were in circulation
yesterday about people bjing disappointed
because they were not remembered in ihe
will. It was reported that one old lady in
particular was promised pay for frequent
kindnesses in this way, but her name was
not in the list of beneficiaries. In fact
there is no mention of any person outside
of Fisk's immediate family.
A characteristic provision is inserted
when the depd man requires that his son
shall pay back to his estate, orgive a bond
for the payment of $1500, before he gets
any part of his legacy. This amount of
$1500, it is explained, "was advanced to the
son In days of his adversity, which must
be paid to the executors ot the estate ''to
gether with a small rate of interest
ttiereon."
It is evident that Fbk was not willing
to trust the usual provisions of the law
for the safeguarding of nis precious coin,
for he inserted the lollowing:
I hereby direct that all money collected by
my executors or either ot tnem shall be held
In deposit, and when the sum collected shall
exceed $20 It shall be immediately deposited
in the C'roeker-Woolworth Bank, and that all
claims against my estate before being paid
shall be approved in writing by both of my
executors and allowed by the Probate Court,
and that all money drawn out of the bank for
any purpose must be on the joint signatures
of my executors; and I further direct that a
correct account in writing of all receipts and
disbursements, showing to whom all moneys
wcro paid, the date oi payment and for what
paid, shall be kept by my executorsjuntil the
final settlement and distribution of my estate.
Lyraan B. Fisk, who, with pardonable
pride, is mentioned as "my nephew, now
or formerly connected with Harvard Uni
versity in Cambridge," is constituted ex
ecutor of tne wilt in regard to the prop
erty in Massachusetts.
The beneficiaries under the will are as
follows: Asa W. Fisk, Denver; Thomas H.
Fisk, Alnmeda; Mrs. Pamela M. Hollis
(nee Fisk). Newion, Mass., $5000 each.
The residuary legatees are Mrs. Lydia B.
Fisk, Arthur G. Fisk and Mrs. Flora
E. Wertheimer, all of San Francisco.
The will was executed on tne 14th of
November, 1895, and the codicils were
made on the 23d and 25th of last January.
The petition for the probate is signed by
Attorneys M. M. Estee and A. G. Fisk.
the latter being the son of ttie testator and
executor of the will. The petition states
that the estate is of the probable value of
$250,000, but those competent to judge be
iieve that it will come nearer $500,000.
There is a provision in the wiil that any
one named as a legatee who shall offer to
â¢ ontest the will shall be cutoff with only
$5, and that the money otherwise devised
us a legacy to such person shall be divided
among the other heirs. Notwithstanding
this interdiction it is believed that there
will be a contest on the Dart of the chil
dren of the first marriage who are allowed
so s!im a portion of the estate. Even be
fore the presentation of the will legal
notices of app?arance on behalf of the
children of the first marriage were in the
hands of lawyers in this City and were
filed by Attorney Joseph McKinley with
County Clerk Curry immediately alter the
will had been recorded.
The first steps in the matter of probat
ing the instrument will oe taken in Judge
Coffey's court on the 23d inst.

DURRANT SHUDDERED NOT
A Pleasant Visit From the Two
Sea Captains Who Know
Butler B)st
Captain Fras?r of the Swanhilda and
Captain Petrie of the Olivebank
Cordially Received.
Durrant had a delightful and romantic
little chat at his cell wicket yesterday aft
ernoon with Captain Fraser, who brought
Butler hither on the Swanhilda, and with
Captain Petrie, who had an experience
with Butler when he was Richard Ashe
on the shiD Olivebank.
The two curious sea captains seemed
thus to establish an appropriate though
distant connection between two of the
most famous shedders of human blood
thai the age lias produced.
Durrant did not do the proper thing
when he was suddenly and unexpectedly
introduced to Captain Fraser of the Swan
hilda. He should at least nave paled
visibly or grown sullen at thus fronting
the wild story of Butler's crime, but he
didn't. He was pleasant as you please
and seemed to enjoy the visit tnat was
prompted by the antipodean crimes of
anoiher arch-murderer.
Captain Fraser and Captain Petrie knew
wel 1 , of course, the story of Durrant,
though they rained it thousands of miles
away, and the deep interest they had
acquired in Butler through their personal
relations with him aroused a correspond
ing interest in seeing Durrani. Their
friend John McCartny, the wholesale cof
fee merchant, arranged to satisfy their
curiosity and piloted them to the jail,
where they were courteously shown to
Durrant's cell.
"I would have known you by your
picture in tne papers," said Durrant, with
a ready and self-possessed smile, and tho
gentlemanly Captain Fraser told Durrant
that he looked just as he did in the
papers.
T :is brought up the fruitful topic of the
press and its liberties, and this was the
mam topic of conversation with Captain
Fraser that ensued, though there was
nothing further that was complimentary
said. Durrant naturally has strong con
victions about newspapers, and he ex
pressed them.
The visitors did not introduce the sub
ject of Butler except in a very incidental
way and Durrant. did not intrude it. The
sea captains who had studied Butler well
studied Durrant's lineaments and didn't
find anything fiendish there. The brief
commonplace conversation was followed
by a cordial "good-day."
Captain Fraser will sail in about three
weeks, and when he and Capiain Petrie
strike Australia again they "will tell of
their visit to Durrant and thereby become
much more interesting than mariners
who never knew but one great murderer.
But Butler is notning to Theodore
Durrant, lor a man who would kill
for a few br.nk notes is perhaps as strange
a creature to him as to others, and Butler
is not curious about Theodore, as far as
anybody knows.
Crusade for Pure Fuod.
A conference took place at the rooms of the
Board of Health yesterday afternoon, which
was attended by Dr. Morse. Dr. Washington
Dodge and Chief Inspector Dockery in refer
ence to the inspection of food for public insti
tutions. It is proposed to provide tags to be
attached to all food for the institutions after
it has been Inspected. Chalk and water have
been discovered in milk furnished to the
County Hospital.
N. P. Olson was arrested yesterday by Officer
Buttcrworth, charged with selling impure
honey at the Emporium.
Hit With a Beerelass.
William Murphy, a laborer, got mixed up In
a fight in a saloon near the Inglesido Race
track last night. Some one threw a beerzlass
at him, which struck him on the forehead
cutting it open. He was taken to the City and
County Hospital, where the wound was stitched
and dressed.

Reasons Why They Should Not Be

But There Is No Otj ction to |

. Confidence.
MAYOR PHELAN ON MUNICIPAL
OWNERSHIP.
Mr. Schussler Relates the Story ol
â¢ the Consolidation Effected in
Sixty-Fivs.
I
The Board of Supervisors again went
into Committee of the whole last night,
with Dr. Clinton in the chair, for the pur
nose of continuing the water rates inves
tigation.
A communication v.as received from At
torney Kellogg, accompanying a detailed
statement of the taxes paid by the com
-1 any in different counties, and of the as
i^ed v.tfue of the property belonging to
Ade company, the writer asking the board
to treat the information us confidential.
The committee decided not to deal with
he foregoing at the moment but to pro
coed with the consideration of the com
pany's advertising expenses. 'v ~
Mr.. Kellogg at this point said that the
company felt some liitJe hesitancy in this
matter. It was really a question of busi
ness" competition between the various
newspapers in the City, and the company
did not wish to arouse ill-feeling among
those newspapers. The company had
vouchers to show for every dollar of the
$51,000 spent' in advertising and he felt
sure that the committee would agree on
examination that the money was well
spent. Â
It could not be expected that the news
papers would publish everything the
company desired as an item of news.
Daring the past year a vicious and savage
assault was made upon the company on
the score of the water supplies to the
City, the author of this attack being a
man who had a reputation in that direc
tion. This man succeeded in frightening
the people into believing thr.t they were
drinking disease germs. Consequently the
company was forced to have an analysis
made of the water by reputable chemists.
This expense really benefited the tax
payer, because it i roved to him that he
was not incurring the risk oi contracting
disease, as these reports had led him to
suppose. The company therefore printed
these analyses in the papers and were
obliged to pay the ordinary rates for ad
vertisements treated as reading matter.
Similarly with the sales of stock. la order
to attract public attention the company
caused descriptions and illustrations of
the works to be published in the news
papers. .
If the stock had been sold at auction it
would not have realized the amount the
company managed to sell it tor in the j
V above-named mamier. The newspapers
I themselves knew very well that the com
-1 .any did not pay extravagant rate's for ad
| vertising and had, therefore, refrained
from- hostile comment on this point. Mr.
Kellogg assured the committee that the
company woulo" willingly furnish the in- 1
formation required if the members would
treat it conn entially.
Dr.' Dodge briefly expressed bis unwill
ingness to press the subject, but regretted
that the company should find itself iv
these embarrassing positions so frequently.
It was finally decided to consider these
expenditures in a general way without
entering into details.
Mr. Schussler referred to the recent at
tacks upon the water drawn from a lake,
which*," be said, v had not been used fora
year. Remonstrances proved unavailing,
I end the board were finally constrained to
call in skilled chemists to analyze the
water in question. This analysis was pub
lished in detail. Besides this, the board,
<i urine: May of last year, wished to sell
$500,000 worth of stock.
It was always profitable to allow pros
pective buyers to know the condition of
i:;e .stock, and for this purpose they bad
several articles published, but none the
less only a few shares were disposed of
and the sale fell through. -Vex; summer
the company had photographs and de
scriptions published. In all 4280 lines of
description were published in ten papers
at a cost of $4231, or close upon $1 a line.
When the next lot of stock was put on
the market, to the extent of about
15500,000,I $500,000, it was nearly all taken up.
Secretary Ames took the stand again to
explain several accounts in the detailed
statement of the company's operating ex
penses. Under the head of "city engine,
$20697 48," he stated that $9300 waÂ« de
voted to coal, $10,000 to wages and $1250 to
supplies."
Mr. Scnusslor explained that from 44 to
4") per cent of the total cost of pumping
was incurred for fuel, 5 per cent for sup
plies and 50 per cent tor wages.
The sum of $263,193 24 was expended
â under the head of new main construction
last year, after allowing certain credits for
\ hyufants, or in all a round sum of $298,000.
%.e main repairs included all the pipes
tiisn up together with those raised and
l<f*ered. During 1896 44,160 feet of all
kl.dsof pipe were taken up for the pur
pose of 'putting in larger mains.
This was done at the desire of the Fire
Department, in order that new hydrants
might be sit. A/ter.the pipe was laid the
ditch was - filled up and the pavement re
placed. BBÂ£Â£2P9KÂ§MO . , â 
The witness entered into a detailed ex
planation of the various items under
main construction, and was again suc
ceeded by Mr. Atue<, who ms asked how
he distinguished real estate, personal
property and improvements.
Mr. Ames said that personal property
covered pipes and machinery not in use,
while improvements were part of both the
realty and machinery. ' â :
The chairman at this juncture called
upon the committee to decide whether or
not it would acquiesce in the company s
request to refrain from making public tho
assessed value of its property, which had
already been furnished to the committee
with that stipulation attached.
The consensus of opinion being in favor
meeting the company half way .in this
particular Dr. Dodge moved Hat the
company's-report be referred for consider
ation to the Water Committee, which will
subsequently present a schedule of rates
* for acceptance by the board. The motion
was carried. Â
The next question on the list was with
reference to the real property owned by
m the company, used in the supply of water,
i its original cost and present valuation.
The first part of the question having
been previously replied to, Mr. Ames was
aÂ»ke<i if he could furnish an estimate of
i.'QBU original cost. .'â -â :,-
V^lHe said that this was not obtainable.
Mgreat de;>l of property was taken over
Irom the old company, and the criminal
price was not known. The consolidation
of the two companies was made by the
exchange of shares and not by placing
any known valuation upon properties.
Supervisor Smith contended that the
property must be held at some figure, and
that the company should possess a record
of the property acquired from the old j
San Francisco Water Company. No pru
dent business man would consolidate
without some basis upon which to do so
ami to issue stock.
Air. Ames said tnat the basis of the old
company's valuation was capital stock.
Mr. Scu ussier here volunteered to state
the facts of the consolidation as he under
stood them.
There were formerly two water com
panies in existenceâ the one, the old San
Francisco (or Bensley) Water Company,
and the other the Spring Valley Water
Works Company. The former had thirty
or forty miles of pipe in the City; an
aqueduct from Lobos Creek to North
Beach; a large pumping station and a
reservoir on Ocean Hill. The Spring
Valley Waterworks had several thousand
acres of land in San Mateo Count}' and
some valuable springs.
They had also constructed a pipe line
into the City two miles in length and a
reservoir near the Almsbmise for a little
over $400,000. Many miles of pipe were
also laid in the stre'eis of the City. The
1 Bensiev Company, finding that the Spring
Valley" WaMur Works enjoyed a br ghter
future owing to the Jact that they owned
better springs and watersheds, a consol
idation was effected in 1860-
The two companies wnen consolidated
were incorporate-l for $6,000,000, b'o,ooo
i shares at $100 each. Business was very
i slacfc at the time this was effected. The
company encountered a great deal of op
position iroin legislative action and sev
i eral newspapers. A depression in the
i stock lesulted which lell as low ai $50 and
This depression led many people to te
-1 lieve that the sharesat this time were only
worth $3,000,000. but they were actually
I wortii more, because the company pos
sessed the basis of future development.
The City had employed experts to dis
cover the original cost, and ne believed
that these report? were on tile. With re
i gard to the value of the land the company
! had already given the committee some of
j the most important purchases made
! within the last ten years; as for example
j the Calaveras and Alameda Creek water
; rights, the Lake Merced watershed, etc.
Supervisor Smith wanted to know
whether the company placed any valua
tion on the real estate they had pur- !
| chased.
Mr. Behasslei said that the water was
I the most valuable portion of the real
I estate. Real estate, improvements and
i the water were placed at a certain figure,
I and tiiese three were included in the con
| jolidation. Supervisor Smith could easily
| find out the valuation by referring to the
| Assessor's accounts.
â¢We are nere to find out," observed
] Supervisor Smith, dryly.
"That's right., quite right," responded
! Mr. Schussl.er, ciieuihili.v.
Dr. llottunzi t>ut a number of questions
' having for tneir object the determination
| of the company's method of computing its
capital to-day. "Suppose," as'se I he,
i "upon au investment of $10,000,000 you
' paid 4 per cent instead of Â»> per oent, would
, you add the diffe.ence of $200,000 to the
capital invested?'
Mr. Ames said that interest was not
! adued. It 5000 shares were sold ihe capital
i stock would be increased to $.500,000.
' Xuen." rejoined Rottanxi, "your method
1 of computing to-day is difteieut ;rom what
it was formerly ?"'
"That." said Mr. Ames, "I cannot tell
you." The dividend?, he added, were de
clared by the trustees f com time to time
ana hud nothing to do with the capital
siock. Mr. Ames, replying to the Muv-or,
; said that the stock had' recently declined
;as low as 92 and 93 and possibly lower. It
\ was selling now ai bS.
'â¢The stock, then,' remarked the Mayor.
I "soon recovered. It is very elastic. If it
; were permanently guaranteed 5 per cent
{ do you tnniK it would sell at the same
price as to-day?"
"I suppose that if the stock was guaran
i teed for teu or fifteen years it should be
par stcck."
Mr. t-chussler interposed to say that this
i could be depended on if the Supreme
j Court would speeily a reasonable rate of
i interest instead of leaving the matter in
! the hands of the Board of Supervisors.
"You could appeal from the board,"
| said the Mayor, ''and get your reasonable
| rate."
Mr. Scaussler insisted that the contin
ual necessity of appealing to the Supreme
Court would worK great hardship.
The Mayor asked Mr, Ames if, in the
event of ihe City desiring to purchase the
| works, the company would expect to re
j cent- not only tne present vaue as cora
! puted by competent experts but the ac
: cumulated interest as well.
Mr. Ames said the interest was deducted
I every year. Everybody sought to realize
i some profit on investments. Supposing
| tnrouga some accident the interest fell
temporarily from 6 to 2 per cent, then it
womd only be fail to make an addition oi
4 per cent.
ihe cnairnian reverted to the original
'< question as to whether the company could
i g ye the committee an idea of the present
I value of tne company's property.
Mr. Schussler regarded the present stock
and bond valuation of $23,000,000 as en tireiy
j insufficient, for the reason that it would
I cost more than that to construct similarly
I equipped works of the same capacity and
possessing the same facilities for iuture
increase. All property had increased in
value since the company's early purchases,
as was shown by the fact that tuey had
often had to pay $1000 for- land which they
could have formerly purchased for $100.
"If the City constructed works and
brought water from other sources," asked
the Mayor, "what could you sell water
for?"
Mr. Schussler replied that the company
could sell water more cheaply than the
City.
"But, :> the Mayor pointea out, "the
City would not be in it to make a profit."
Mr. Schussler rejoined that all cities
were in for profit.
â¢Suppose we cut rates one-half. You
I could not afford lo follow?"
"We would have to dispense with ex
pensive items, such as pumps, etc. 1 don't
think the City wouid agreu to force water
400 leet high as we do now. That is the
luxury we throw iti besides the water."
"If you gave up your business wiiat is
ihe value of your land, meters, pipes,
buildings, etc?"
"That's such a wonderful question lam
not prepared to answer it. We are not
going otu of business. ' New YorK, said
the witness, made the householder pay
water tax, which when taken into con
sideration raised the real rate consider
ably.
Tne Mayor suggested the possibility of
the City introducing water from ihe
S.errcs. " Wouldn't that reduce your
rates?" he asked.
"No," replied Mr. Scbuasler, "for the
simple reason that you can no c do any
thing oi the kind. What's the good "of
putting a hypothetical case?" The Castro
Lake water, he said, wasn't fit to drink,
and if the City tried to get water from
LaKe Tahoe the Nevaua people would say
something. ,
The Mayor continued in his vein of
playiul badinage, conjuring up a vision of
shareholders smitten by paresis and com
pelled to go cut of business. In such a
case they might refuse to sell water; the
property would then be sold by the Public
Administrator. Uow mucii wouid it
brinu?
"Well," replied Mr. Schussler, "suppose
you were in the middle of the Sahara
desert and had no water to drink, what
would you do? 1 hold that the proper
way to get at the value of our property is

THE MURDER OF SULLI VAN
Trouble Over Pools on Coursing
Events Led to the
Killing.
Policeman G orge Dougherty Coatinu s
to Impnv; at the R?c.-iving
Ho p tal.
The murder of Henry E. Sullivan by
Policeman George Dougherty Sunday
nicht continues the all-absorbing topic of
conversation in police circles.
The statement in The Call yesterday
that Dougherty and Sullivan wer? inter
ested in coursing events and had quar
reled because Dougherty thought Sullivan
had "jobbed" him was confirmed from in
quiries among Potrero sports.
It was learned that a pool had been
made in tlie Buffalo saioon on Twentieth
street, between Illinois and Michigan,
which is the headquarters of the Potrero
sports. It was a small affair in its way,
but both Dougherty and Sullivan patron
ized it and deposited their coin with Mike
Cusack, 614 Tennessee street, who gener
ally took the deposits to Ingleside and
placed them according to instructions.
Dougherty believed that he had been
"jobbed" and attributed the blame to
Sullivan and aroused an unfriendly feel
ing oetween them. This was the oniy
trouble alleged to exist between them so
far as their intimate acquaintances know.
Lieutenant Bennett arid Policeman
George McConnell, "who is on auty at ihe
Potrero station, speak well of Dougherty
and say he was an excellent ofiicer, gentle
manly and obedient.
Detective Cody and Policemen Hartei
and Hayden obtained written statements
yesterday from Ed Lunstedt, proprietor of
the saloon where the murder occurred,
and C. J. Ta!o, his bartender. They do
not differ much from what has already
beeri published. According to Lunstedt.
D ugherty got the worst of the sparring
bout, Sullivan giving him a black eye.
After the bout Lunstedt say^:
Sullivan then said to Dougnerty, "I guess
you're mad, but there is no need, as it was
only friendly." Dougherty said he was not
mad. Then .Sullivan got up close to Dough
herty aud said. "What the are you kicking
about?" Sullivan looked angry and X tlioiiÃht
he was coing to strike Dougherty. 1 felt
anxious and Boyle grabbel ho!d of Sullivan
to jmll him away. Sullivan told Bov.e to let
him alone aud stood close up to Dounheriy
and Dougherty said to Sullivun, "I'll let you
nlone," and a second after he pulled his sun.
They were standing at the end of tho bar and
it seemed to tno as '.hough Suiliviiu would not
let D)Uglicrty I'ass out of ilio saluon. Then
Dougherty pulled i) is gun, fired two uliois at
.Sullivan and one at htmaeif. They hurl all
been drinking, but seemed to knoiv what they
were doing. Sullivan seemed to be In an ugty
mood.
Dougherty continues to improve at the
Receiving Hospital.

WELCH AGAIN SECRETARY
Socloty for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children Cats luto Hit
Salary.
The regular meeting of the directors of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children was held yesterday. Present
were: Charles Sonntag, G. Palacbe, J. A.
Newhall, A. Ronnan. I. T. Miiliken, B. P.
Flint, Clinton E. Worden, C. S. Capp.
Secretary Charles P. Welch's report
showed 101 cases received during Febru
ary, 89 investigated, 14 prosecuted, 11 con
victions, 28 children placed in institutions,
3 in families and 7 cases referred to the
Associated Charities.
By unanimous vote Welcn was re-elected
secretary, out on the ground of strict
economy his salary was reduced $10 per
month." Fortliesamo reason the services
of Special Officer Hoihrook will be dis
pensed with after April 1. â¢
Considerable discussion was evoked by
some comparisons made with regard to
the attention and importance given to the
society here and similar institutions in
the EaÂ«t. They were he!d to be much .bet
ter treatad there and their power ior good
was thereby ereatly enhanced. Colonel
E. Fellows Jenkins-, superintendent of the
New York hociety, has been in this City
lately visiting, and during his stay Messrs.
Sonntag and Welch have been showing
him around to give him a chauca for com
parative study.
Frank Hoibrook has served the society
faithfully for a period of years, and dur
ing five years has had practically the
placing of all the children brought in
nee. ting care. His kindness and faithful
ness have been often acknowledged.
Hence therÂ« will be the more surprise
that he has been dismissed.
Mr. Holbrook does not believe thnt
economy had anything to do with his De
ing dismissed. He said last night that
President Sonntag told h>m not long r.go
that "all the Welches in the world could
not cause his dismissal." From this he
says that it appears to be easy to bim to
draw a safe inference concerning the in
fluence which has iemoved him. His re
moval will cause penernl surprise, lor lie
was well known ail over the Slate for
good work.
WOMEN'S CONGRESS.
It Will He Held at the First Congrega-
tional Church in the Week
.Beginning April 26

plete. L?tters of acceptance from cele
brated women of the East, whose names

Owing to a previous engagement of the
First Congreguiional Church a change of
date for the congress was found necessary.
The time was lixed for the week begin
ning April 26.
Dunne'* Salary in Question.
Auditor Broderick doubts whether Joseph J.
Jiunne. who was uppointed by the Board of
Supervisors Monday to assist District At
torney Barnes, can draw fl salary. Part of his
doubts rest on the question whether the Board
of Supervisors can Croats a county oftici.
Mayor Phelan also contends that the salary
cannot be pud out of the urgent necesstty
iund, notwithstanding the resolution ol the
Board of Supervisors.

When People Have Tired of Drugging They Find a
Cure in This Wonderful Appliance.
Every device known to 1 . To make this Belt stronger,
science that will make more durable and with
Electricity do better work sÂ§Â§6|%|Â§ better curative qualities
in curing disease is em- iS|%dtf> than any other remedy is
bodied in this appliance. Dr. Sanden's aim.
THE GRANDEST INVENTION OF THE AGE FOR WEAK MEN: THE SUREST AND
easiest cure for all nervous and chronic diseases. Its wonderful power is directed to tho
seat of the nervous system, through which its vitalizing strength penetrates into all parts of
the body, carrying new life to every iunction which has been weakened by excesses or dissi- '
pation, restoring energy to the brain and power to the muscles.- ; .
'â¢When I bought my Sanden Belt I had spent 8250 doctoring. â¢ I -was run down with weakness,
losses and pains in my bacic, and was unable to work. The Belt has cured me cn t -lrely/'""'sa\rs John
X ua:i, 12 !-a<'iMiu(tir.o street, San Francisco. â  . . I
- Dr. Sanden is a physician of tho highest standing amone-tlie medical profession, having
devoted thirty years of his life to the practice of medicine, find has piven it up now lor several
years, so that he may devote his' knowledge exclusively to this better, more effective menus of
rescuing the sick and weury from despni-. He has given to the world this remarkable crea-
tion of his brain, the Dr. Sanden Electric Belt, and personally supervises its use in all discs
so that in not one single instance may it fail to do all that he claims for it. He is an expert
In medicine and an expert in electricity, and every one of his patients receives his personal
attention until the final happy result is reachedâ a permanent restoration to health and
strength.
"A few months ago I bought a strong- power Sanden Belt for vital weakness, disease of the kid-
neys and pain In the bark. I nai suffering so much that I could not work. .The Banderi Belt h:u
complet ly cur.-d the pain and the kidney trouole, and restored mv manly strength entirely. I would not
be without ll under any circumstances," says Ciiarles Forrest, 310 Twelfth street, San Francis :o.
THIS GREAT BOON 15 YOURS.
In using Dr. Sandeu's Electric Belt the patient is assured if two very necessary pointsâ
that he has the very best, most scientific, strongest and most durable electric belt that can be
made, and with it the personal intention of a rezutar physician until cured. It is impossible
to imagine a more effective means of fighting disease. , All medical men sanction the use of
electricity, anu Dr. Sanden by his personal attention to his patients makes his belt do the
work which has baffled the skill ot medical experts of all countries.
"When 1 commenced to wear your Belt 1 was all broken down. My nerves were completely shat-
tered and I had .earful pains in my bacK, My digestion was so poor that I could eat nothing wi.hout
great distress afterward. I wis weak for years from lossei resulting from ear.y indiscretion. Now,
after wearing your Belt, my pains are all none, appetite Rood, and my s.reneith Is restored. My loss 's
are stopped and I feel strong mi I hearty t^ain. 1 nave gained eleven pounds and a Ha'.f in the last
month- 1 wish that every sufferer from weakness had one of your bi'lts. Words cannot express the
gratitude I feel," nays Joseph ileurich, 153 Tehama street.Sau Francisco.
DR. SANDEN INVITES YOU TO CALL.
It is a pleasure to Dr. Sanden to talk with a non-believer in the power of his belt, for in
this way many are convinced by scientific oroofs who would go 0:1 from year to year suffering
from a curab'.e disease. He will examine every, patient free of charge, and state honestly
whether a cure is possible. He can gain nothing by misleading a sufferer, as his best adver-
tisement is tho good he has done, and he will take no case where his belt is powerless to cure. -
He therefore invites a call ora letter from all who are sick or weak, so that by personal study
of the cÂ»se he may lend his patient to renewed health and happiness. It you cannot call per-
sonally send for his famous book, "Three Classes of Men," which is full of clean, wholesome
: facts, and lias the letters of hundreds of prominent men in ail sections of the State who have
| been cured by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt, Call or address

there is very good reason to believe that a good
deal of quiet trading in wool is now going on, the
aim of all concerned neiug to keep the facts from
the public to the greatest extent possible. While
the volume of bosun for the last six days seems
HHiftll In comparison with the figures which were
give. 1 for previous wee.es. 1; nevertheless shines
by comp.mon with the corresponding week o.
list year, and may be said 10 b.- fully up to whit
has usually been considered a normal argregate.
Holders of wool are not showing the slightest dis
position to shade pru <â *. At slight concessions
very laree sales could be made. Territories and
Australian have received liberal attention, par
ticuiarly the former. There Is very fair demand
for pulied and scourea wools, domestic scoured
moving generally above 30c. Mocks of capes in
the Boston market are at present very light.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. March âQuietness was the
chief characteristic of the wheat market this
morning. The tone was visibly weak and prices
were lower. Tb.j failure of war to materialize
from the late unpleasantness abroad was a blow 10
the anlicipKtions of many holders an. I liquidating
sales were therefore common LiverpoolÂ£sel the
tone by declining Â»iÂ®ld. English consols, were
scpiulv to a fraction gluT than yesterday. After
a week of pretty good prices recovered a lttle and
then he d nearly with the volurue of business
light. Northwestern receipts were 327 cars,
against 359 last Tuesday and 40 a year ago.
Chlraeo received 32 cars and inspected out 33,416
I bushels.
The Daily Trade Bulletin estimated the total
visible supply on July 1 at between 75,000 000
ana b0.1i00.000 bushels. Cosing continental

luht at 162,598 bushels. Toward the close, on re
ports of frcili outbreaks in Crete, prices bulged
about half a cent. May wheat opened from 748/g@

for 10-morrow, 3 8 cars. No. 2 red, spot, wheat
ranged from 83S/ S c to t>6?gc, closing at, 8414Â©
853ic.
CORNâ A slightly weaker feeling prevailed in
corn. The less bellicose nature of th â¢ early press
dispatches and the apparent restoration of confi
dence o.i European exchanges were mainly the
weakening considerations . Large receipts, 401
cars, and . the prospect of cooler weather were
likewise of importance as price-determining fac
tors I Liverpool cables quoted 1 id to Vad decline.
Withdrawals from &tor-? were 1 eht at 3035 bush- j
els. Export clearances were liberal at 617,702
bushels. Near the cloie prices declined, in sym
pa hy with those of wheat. Slav corn opened at

ing at 24S'8@243ic, a shave over vest. rJay. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 175 cars.
OATSâ LiDeral receipts, 435 cars, the peaceful
European news and ihÂ» action of wh-at Â»nd corn
ail tended todiscourage baying of oats. Business
was model ately active, and prices were *Â»R*y,
Withdrawals irom store were 3353 bujhels. ' Ex

PROVISIONSâ The sen:lment in product this
morning was not toward nigber prices. War news
was recently a bull factor, and that being parti illy
removed caused some selling. ThÂ« bo,; market
was lower, an I that fact with the early easier feel
ing in train was adverse to provision values. The
improv mem In the surrounding prices had a bene
fic al effect on provisions. May pork and ribs
each closed 2 1 ~sC higher, and May lard unchanged.

MIKRORS OP AIR.
What it Is That Causes the Marvels of
the Mirage.
The cause of the mirage is now well un
derstood â so well understood that there
are ways of making small mirages for ex
periment.
The simplest explanation that I can
give is to say that the rays of light com
ing from the thing that is seen are bent in
going through layers of air that are differ
ently heated. When these rays are so
bent as to be almost level with a layer 01
air ihey do not enter it at all, but (so to
speak) glance off and are reflected as a
glass mirror or a body of water would, if
it lay between the eye aud the trees or
ship 3.
This explanation will give you a eeneral
idea of the cause of the mirage. In the
case of the desert the reflecting air-mirror
is believed by the observer to be water, and
the image changes its place as you go for
ward, just as a reflection would move as
you advance on a glass mirror. In the
case of the ship the air-mirror seems to be
above you, and reflects the ship which is
really out of sight over the horizon. But
I do not pretend to explain about the dit
ferent images that may possibly be formed
un'ler different conditions of the atmos
phere â that is a schoolroom task, and a
hard one.
Tne "fata Morgana" is a form of modi
fication of the mirage often seen in the
straits that separa-te the toe of the "boot"
of Italy and the island of Sicily, just op
posite. Wnen the sun ia just at the right
position and the sea :ind air arc also ready
to help, strange views of objects upon the
opposite coast are seen from Calabria â
sometimes magnified and seen against a
background of colored mist. "F.ita Mor
gana" means the Fairy of ihe Sea.
It is said that sometimes during a hot
and still summer day, by placing the eye
close to the surface of a dry road a mirage
can be seen, but I have never tried it.
Before thÂ«se and other strange sights
were understood and explained, we need
not wonder that sailors and travelers held
many strange beliefs in regard to them. â
St. Nicholas.

MAYOR-ELECT THOMAS BFEAXS.
: ving been elected Mayor of Oakland by a
f, ralifr of about 100 votes I fee! that I
ban .0! sufficiently express my gratitude to
who have helped to bring about tbis
result.
I desire to sincerely thank all my Repub
lican irk-nds, citizens and all who con tributed
i i-i my success and to assure them that I will
uo ail in mv power to prove that their confi
dence has not been misplaced, and that two
years nence they will not regret their choice
of yesterday.
I have been compelled by illness to keep out
oi tne active work, of the campaign. Tiiis
made it necessary ihat the part I should have
taken In helping the Republican ticket should
l>e borne by others. They bore it nobly and
veil and I cannot adequatily thank them.
I shall .go into office absolu.ely free from
pledge. 1 have not promised to support or
oppose a sing;e measure that may come before
in*. I have made no promises regarding any
position the appointment to which may be
tattled by my vote.
I realize tne great responsibility that has
bte i placed upon me, and I shall endeavor to
f how.the people of Oakland that I am worthy
in some degree of their support and confi
dence.
I have already outlined in The Call what I
â would d<> ii elected Mayor. My entire efforts
will now be directed to carrying out those
pledges.
I will strive to give the city an honest,
economical and business-like administration,
and keep the texes as low as is consistent with
the public good.
I shall strive to beautify the city, make good
roads and keep public buildings in good re
pair, and wi.l employ none but citizens of
Ojkland, so that the money spent by the
municipality may be kept at home,
I snail encourage competing railroads to
make their terminals in Oakland, and shall
â¢work assiduously toward the prosecution of i
the water-front suit?, and, after that vast prop- j
ertj shall be awarded the city, I shall do ah J j
can to encourage the establishment of manu- j
facturing enterprises alone the water front.
' 1 realize that for the next two years lam to
be the servant of the people, and my sole de
l EiwwlH be to be faithful to my trust.

The complete returns of the election
were Known early this morning and they
snow that the Republicans can throw the
ioard of Public Works. That body will
â  cons.ituted of Mayor Thomas, City
Jiltorney Dow, Republicans, and R. M.
Clement, Democrat.
Yesterday's work produced many sur
prises. Captain Thomas only won out in
his fight for Mayor by about 100 votes over
Mayor Davle. W. A. Dow ran very close
to T. F. Garnty for Ciiy Attorney until
the las: precincts were received and only
had 249 vote* more than was necessary to
Insure his election.
The defeat of Arthur "VV. Wilson, the
Republican candidate for City Engineer,
was not a surprise. Mr. Wilson antago
nized many of the elements that
caused his election two years ago and
seemed so certain of h s re-election that
he did not take reasonable precautions to
insure their friendship. Although his
vote is nearly twice as large as that of two
years ago it was still more than 300 too
jittle to reach that given to K. M. de
merit.
Mr. Wil*on was whispered to death.
for several member* of the police and tire
department have been doing their ut
most to defeat his re-election, because of
the many manifestations of favoritism
that have been shown in those depart
ments and credited rightly or wrongly to
Mr. Wilson.
The campaign against the saloons ended
very differently fioni what was expected.
The saloon men themselves were the most
surprised people' in the city when they
learned that the effort to close them out
had be^n lost by over 13C0 votes. In
speaking of the matter to-day, Rev. Dr
Kumnier said that the result was very
4 atifving, as it was only a preliminary
\ ir.-nish. He said that they were dis
couraged but tboucht that the fact of be
inz able to gain nearly 4000 votes out of
OOOOin favor of absolute dosing after a
campaign of but one wees was splendid
Work.
There will certainly be nimy political
sensations durine the next month. City
Attorney Peirsol and Mayor Davie, who
will go out of office, have always been
bitter political antagonists. Peirsol has
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
always voted with City Engine*! Wilson,
but during the past month Wilson has
used all his energy to try and elect Mr.
Dow, and this has caused n rupture be
tween the twins of the boarj. Now Peir
sol and Davie are in that mood when any
thing if likely to happen, and as they pro
fess to believe that Chief hair of the Fire
Dapartment and Chief L'oyd of the I'olice
Department and some other employes
have been doinc politics, contrary to the
rules, it is not impissible that before
the end of the week some of these gentle
men under suspicion will be accorded the
privilege of taking a Holiday.
The new Board of Works will be a com
plelechanee, noueof tlieold members hav
ing been re-elected. It is practically cerriiin
that ttiey will maketheusu.il changes in
the heads of departments, and thi3 will
cause considerable discussion for the next
few weeks.
Councilman Bnssett, knovn as "Old
Pard,' : is just now quietly doing a lot of
thinking. He ran for Council man-ai
iarge as an independent candidate, out
found himself in fifth place. As there are
only four of these offices to nil Mr. Bas^c-tt
is in !he same car with Mr. Pe.rsol and
Mr. Wilson.
One of the jokes of the campaien was
the cnndidacy oi A. C. Henry, a banker.
Mr. Henry ran his campaign from his
lod ing-house on Ninth street, and it does
not seem to have gone beyond the limits
of the block in which it was born. Out of
10,000 votes t. e received 412. As lie give
a free banquet to those who would c >nsnnt
to listen to speeches on his behalf, patron
ized the newspapers liberally, had n small
army of men guarding i is headquarters,
and was generally considered a very ac
ceptable man to t'e up to, his sworn state
mentor election expenses is being eagerly
awaited.
Another freak of politics was the result
of Rev. S. Goodenough's campaign. Two
OAKLAND'S BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS - ELECT.
weeks ago he was looked upon as being
distinctly in the race, but when the votes
were counted his share was exactly Â£04.
With the exception of H. D. Talcott, tie
Republican nominees for Councilmen-at-
Large were elected, a* were also the party
nominees f>Â»r School Directors and Library
Trustees. In the Fift Ward two en thusi
astic Republicans, Frank M. Parcells and
Dr. \V. O. Buckland, divided the Republi
can vote of 646 between them, and, conse
quently, A. Fitrasb, a Democrat, captured
the plum with 892 TO tea. The Sixth Ward
proved to be a conundrum.
E. G. Buswe'.l, who is known to fame as
the man who brought several suits lo test
the lecality of the railroad charging fare
on Seventh street, received 120 votes,
while sailing Biily Wattinson, the
Southern Pacific yardmaster who went
oat in the figh' of three years ago and has
never bÂ°on taken back, received the sup
port of 64'J voters, and will reclaim his
seat in the Council, which he has held for
four years.
The smallest vote accorded to any one
candidate was 16. which was given to
Charles Chester, an independent candi
date in the Seventh Ward, while the high
est vote was accordei to City Treasurer
Gilpin, who received 6013 votes.

BE PROTECTED
Rights of Street Orators to
Be Tested in the Su
preme Court.
Salvationist Sherwod Returns
and Surrenders Himself
Into Custody.
Can Citil ns in Oak and Use the
Public Bonn n for a
Rostrum?
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Cam,,)
â¢JUS 15 road way, March 9. j
The right of cifzens to speak on the
street corners of tuis city will soon be
tested in the Supreme Court.
During the recent campaign John Lon
don Jr., who was a candidate for the
Board of Educftion at large, was arrested
for holding a street meeting without hav
ing obtained the necessary permit from
the Mayor and the Chief of Police, as re
quired by the ordinance.
Over a year a^o the same question was
brought up by the arrest of W. Sherwood,
a, ruerabt-r of the Salvation Array, who
was arrested for violating the same ordi
nance. Sherwood was released on habeas
corpus, which was allow-d to slumber in
the Superior Court. A few days ago, when
London was arrested, Sherwood's case was
called up, the writ denied and he was re
manded into custody.
Sherwood was out of the jurisdiction of
the court at the time, and the genera! im
pression was that Sherwood would not re
turn. To the surprise of everybody he
surrendered himself into custouy to-day
for the purpose of laying the foundation
to have t!:e matter heard by the Supreme
Court on a writ of l.abeas corpus, which
will determine tlie validity of the ordi
nance.
Several months aÂ«o near the City Hall
there was a pretty park, and during the
exciting times when everybody was talk
ing about gold and silver dollars, more
because they couid not get hold of any
than for any principle that was involved
in their eclor, sections of the park were
ruined by the frequent gatherings of those
who felt the burden laid upon tiiPtn to ad
just National finances. The officials at
the City Hall careu a great deal more for
the littie pr-en park than for the nightly
an;i daily heated arguments that took
place around the band stand ana which
bad the effect of wearing off the grass.
The ordinance was revived and street
meetings were forbidden except from the
City Hall steps. Thega:dener sowed some
grivs seed, and it was hoped tnat the con
stitutional right ol free speech had oeen
settled.
This was not the case, for the City Hall
recently became too small to accom
modate all those whose mission is to con
vert the sinner from his evil way or to en
lighten citizens on the political situation,
and so Mr. London again eot on the ernsd
and was arrested. He defended himself
so ably in the Police Court that the jury
disagreed, and he will have another trial.
In tlio meantime the case ol Sherwood
may be decided, and Oakland orators will
know whether they may or may not use
the public domain lor a rostrum.

OAKLAND, Cat.., March 9.â The an

The Death of a Lorin Boy Forces the
Teachers to Take Precautionary
Measures.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 9.â No more
"pec-wee" in the Berkeley public schools.
Such is the proclamation which has been
sent forth, as a result of the fatal accident
to lii tie Claude Marx of the Lorin school
a few days ago.
In buch of the schools as there was not
a prohibitory rule before the death of
young Marx a law now exists tabooing the
youthful sport.
At the Wbittier school an nccident oc
curred soon after the death of the Lorin
doy, which came very near being a dupli
cate of the first mishap.
Some of the boys were indulging in a
con:cst with their long sticks and pointed
blocks of wood. The "pep-wee" struct a
boy who was watching, infl oting a pain
ful wound under the eye. It was a nar
row escape for the lad, for hud ihe block
struck bis temple it is believed that a
fatal accidont might have startled Nonh
Berkeley.
As a safeguard against further possible
fatalities the game has been barred out of
all the Berkeley schools.

NOBLE ACTS OF CHILDREN
Interesting Report of the Doing* of the
Band of Mercy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 9. j
Not the less interesting because coached
in childish language is the report issued
by the Oakland Band of Mercy, which met
in the Oakland office of the S. P. C. A.
The band is growing so large that more
room will soon be necessary to accommo
date it. The report says :
Roy Farrish reported finding a span of
horses standing in the rain. He requested a
man to blanket them, which was done. Alfred
Wilkle stopped some boys from pulling the
wings off flies, then burning them; ho also
8 cured the release of a aog tied to a wagon
and being pulled along.
Willie Nelle fed a stray hungry dog on the
corner of Telegraph avenue and Twentieth
street. Me also stopped some boys from ston
ing an old horse which whs feeding on tho
roadside at Elm hurst. Willie Evans inducsd
a junk man to take off ill-fitting blinders
which irritated the eyes of bis horse. He pre
vented some boys irom stoning a goose; iound
a black-and-tan dog which hHd been left in
his neighborhood by the owner moving Â« way;
he cared lor it a few days and then - took it to
Mrs. Sanford to care for, hoping to find a home
for the little waif. Edward Eherlich has re
ported a number of cases of cruelty to the
society. *' v â  â-
BThe boys are often pained by witnessing the
cruel treatment administer to balky horses,
and they dos.re to have the to in (I method
of handling such' a horse widely read : "An
officer: of . the police detail .Â«aid recently:
'When 1 was a mounted policeman I learned
of a most humane and kiud ] method of curing
a balky horse. It not only never fails, but it
docs not give (ho slightest pain to the animal.
When the horse reiuses to go, take the front
foot at tho . leilock r.nl bend the i le^ at the
knee joint. Hold it thus: for three minutes
and let it down and the hors; will go. The
only way in which I cai account for this is
that lie can think of omy ono thing at a time,
and having made up ; ms mind not m go my
theory is that ih.<i bending of tue leg takes his
mind from the original thought.'.,.".-:
Tne secretary, Eiuard Eheil eh, read the
charminK â¢lory written by Mrs. E. E. Green

recently. â  â¢ â¢ â  â â¢ ' â  .
The next business was of great Interest to
the boys. They hope in the near future to
hoid a immune contest, speaking pieces bear
ing upon the subject of Kindness, contesting
lor a prize. The speaking will be interspersed
with good niu*ic, under the supervision of
Professor Wilkie. A special meeting ol the
board will be held Thursday at 3:30 o'clock
p. M. to appoint committees to arrange for tne
contest. All members are requested to be
present. -.; . ' '.
After repeating the pledge, "I will try to be

cruel usage." the board adjourned to meet

The Ebell Society is still chafing under
the unpleasantness because some of its
members will not preserve secrecy, but
will taik for publication, and because of
recent criticisms. The meeting to be held
in a few days, in which the subject of the
duties of members will be dscussed, is
more than ever necessary.
A member who signs herself " H. F. C"
has published a long letter in reply to the
criticisms of Rev. Dr. Wendte and Rev.
Mars ail Law.
â¢'lt is difficult to understand," says the
writer, "why some of the men of Oakland
should be so alive to the difference in
religious faith among thÂ« women of ti.e
Ebell Society.
"I have been a member of the Ebell
for years, attending nearly all of their
most important meetings, and, while they
have had talks, lectures and discussions
upon every subject under the sun, from
astronomy to mining, we have never gone
beyond the stars of the realms of peace, or
underneath the earth to the region of
darkness. We have had talented men
and women to speaK to us and lead us
into thoughts beyond and out of the daily
home lite and routine, but we have not
had a religious faith discussed or one's
sacred creed unfolded for inspection. It
has not been the subject ot even one
bour'a work among tbe women coming to
their clubroonia for study from week to
week.
"These women are actively engaged in
tbe church work of Oakland, each de
nomination having its share of members
from agnostics to Episcopalians, and the
former are women of singular parity and
elevation of character, strongly alive to
the moral and educational advancement
ot women, true and laithful, having vir
tue?, I doubt not, many of us long for and
miss. Tbat they have cone away from
the 'patns iheir fathers trod' may or
may uoi be ours to criticise and persuade
as we may be near or distant frifDds and
we are on a true character basis and not
from an outward profession of faith or
adoption of creed.
"The Episcopalians lead largely in num
bers among our members, earnest workers
in the four churcnes of Oakland. The
Presbyterians au i Congregationalists are
larceiy represented also, many of them at
tending lectures at our rooms and then
leaving to hear Mr. Munhall, and quietly
on the way per.-uading some one to co.
The Baptists-. Methodists, Lutheran, Ro
man Catholics, Swedetiborgian, Unitar
ians, Universalists, Christian Scientists
are all with us honored and honoring
alike, and, as Emerson says, we are near
to each and each one is near to us.
"These same men who are troubled
and anxious, of course, have wives and
mo; hers and sisters in the society, or how
could they write so intelligently about us ?
We ask them to come to our restful rooms
any morning or alternoon and meet the
classes which we call 'sections.' From
ten to thirty women are in each one study
ing the ways and thoughts anil wisdom
and experiences of men and women from
tne days before time wÂ«*s down to the last
bold stroke in Greece or the way the new
Presidpnt will enter Washington and what
colors are most harmonious for Mrs. Presi
dent's new towns.
"We will open our doors to you and will
bold sacred your religious faith, undis
turbed shall be your politics, unques
tioned shall be the cut of your coat, and
we care not at all provided truth, honesty
and intelligence go hand in hand wuli a
- utticiently broad unde r standmg of what
we as a club are thinking and talking. 1
uive you a list cf some of the Mibjects this
last year: 'Myths in Modern Literatuie,'
'The Public Schools,' 'Discussions in Sil
ver and Gold,' "Political Equali;y,' 'The
Making of Busts and Bab-reliefs, with
Practical Illustration,' 'Tne Mining In
dustry.' 'Ihe Work Among tho Child
W dows of India.'
"We have two German sections, one
Italian, one Browning, one botany, tÂ»vo
French, two Spanish, one eh na painting,
three art, two architecture, book review,
current literature, history, living writers,
Shakespeare (this laÂ«t Mr. McCbesney of
the High School kindly has in charge)
This was not because there were not.
available women, but because tliis same
gentleman has always beers kind and
helpful and appreciates what it may mean
to a woman tb have only the limitations
of the home circe and no more. Now and
then a woman does long for some teach
ing outside of wnat maybe gained from
her home and tne mere surroundings
there, strange as it doubtless seems to
many." _______^____
WILL VOTE ON LOCAL OPTION.
The City Clerk Must Put the Ques
tion on the ltuiiota.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 9.â There has
been quite a discusion over the attitude
of tlie Board of Trustees toward the Anti-
Saloon League's local-option movement.
Two of the fivo Trustees are known to
favor the movement, two are known to be
oppose,!, wuile the attitude of the filth,
who will have the deciding vote, is not
known. This gentleman, Trustee Fletter,
has just left for a trip to the East, and it
was announced that this would bo fatal to
the chance of having the anti-saloon ques
tion put. on the ballots at '.he coming
election, as the board would be a tie and
nothing could be done.
Quite a sensation was sought to be made
from ibis fact, but some one read the
ordinance over cart-fully and it was dis
covered that the Trustees had no power in
the premises. The law makes it man
datory on the City Clerk to put the Ques
tion, "Snail the sale of intoxicating li
quors in this city be forbidden?" on the
ballots whenever petitioned so to do by
the requisite number of voters. He hail
no option in the premises, but moat huve
the tickets printed with that question on
them.
So at the coming election the people of
Alanieila will vote on the local option
question, and the Anti-tSaloon League feels
certain that it will carry the day.

TREBELLI SINGS AGAIN.
A Crowded House Greeted the
Brilliant Songstress
Last Night
__________
P.cy.d H?r Own Accompaniment
While She Sang Bz?t's "L'Adi?u
<h I'Hobrn Arab."
Golden Gate Hall was crowded last
night by a fashionable and enthusiastic
audience, who came to hear Trebelli sing
her farewell to San Francisco's music
lovers. They were agreeably disappointed,
however, for it was announced during the
course of the evening that owing to nu
merous requests Mile. Trebelli would give
another series of concerts.
Mile. Trebelli has certainly made her
self a great favorite her*, and the more
sbe sings the more they seem to want to
hear her. Last evening by request she
sane "Lo, Hark! the Gentle Lark," with
the flute obiicaso by Herr Rodemann, and
was compelled to repeat it by the persist
ent applause of the delighted audience.
The prirua donna proved herself an ex
cellent accompanist as well as a brilliant
songstress. The seventh number was a
chanson Arabe, "L' Adieu de i'Hotesse
Arabe." by Bizet, and Trebelli, seating
Herself at the piano, played her own ac
companiment in a manner that won for '
hÂ«n double amount of applause. Her
"Last Rose of Summer" was beautifully
rendered, and when for an encore Auber's
"Laughing Sonp' 1 was repeated many
ladies ruined gloves iv a vain effort to
have "]ust one more. 1 ' â¢
Professor G. Sauvlet's pianoforte solos
were generously applauded. He is a bril
liant perform r, and a composer as well.
He played one of his own compositions,
and Mile. Trebelli sann one of nis songs
for an encore. Miss Van der N'aillen and
Mr. Sauylet played I. de Kontski's ar
rangement of Meyerbeer's "Les Hugue
nots" in a most acceptable manner. The
Mi-ses Hush's violin and p ano duets
were most enjoyable features of the con
cert.
The next series of concerts is looked for
ward to with unalloyed pleasure by the
many admirers of Mile. Trebelli.
Captain Goodell's Trial.
The inquiry into the charges against Captain
Goodell of the sieamer Dauntless was resumed

matter under advisement.

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
FOR WEAKUNS OF Ml
WHICH CURKD HIM AFTER EVKKY-
... THING KLSK FAILED.
Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the mo>t severe pain. There
Is no let up to the mental suffering day or
| night. - Sleep is almost Impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
whit they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison . and thus end all
I his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
ho now declares that any man who will taku
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method or this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. .
1 am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
1 an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
1 Buffering the mental tortures of weakened
' manhood who would be cured at enca could
they but get such a remedy - as the one that
! cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
I afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
I to mall the information, but send for it and
[ learn that there are a few things on earth
| that, although they cost nothing to get, are
â¢ worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
! time of happiness to most of us. Write to
: Thomas Slater, box 2283, Kalamaioo, Mich.,
! and the inlorrcMion will be mailed in a plain

TO EUROPE FOR
LITTLE MONEY
William B. Gross on the
Fun He Had for
$350
It Beat a Thirty-Five Hundred
Dollar Trip All to
Pieces.
Traveled First Class on the Steamers
and Stopped a? Hotels Every.
where Exc.pt in London.
Among the arrivals at the Baldwin Ho
tel is William B. Gross, manager for
James A. Herne and author of the book,
'Europe lor $350," which has attracted a
pood deal of attention. Mr. Gross was
formerly manager for Eleanor Duse.
He came hero h'rst with the elder Sal- j
vini, aiul at one time and another has had
many interesting experiences. He is en
thusiastic in his praise of the genius of
Eleanor Duse, and thinks she is the great- j
est woman living.
Talking about the book with the novel
title and the story it narrates of travel in
foreign lands for so small a sum of money,
he said the account was literally true.
'â¢I made the trip for $350," he said,
"and took i:i the most interesting of the
countries beyond the ocean, doing it all
in three months. I afterward made the
some trip for $3300, and didn't have half
so much fun, eit.ier, but the last time I
did not pay the expenses. I was private
secretary for a man who had lots of
money, and he footed the bill. .
"But on this first trip, soberly and se
riously I had everything I wanted. I visited j
Belgium, Germany, France, England and i
{Scotland. I traveled first class on the
steamers and first, second and third class
on ti^e railroad?. 1 lived in hotels every
where except in London, where I lived in
a boarding-house. I w:>s three weeks in
Paris and two weeks in London and spent
a day or two at a time, or even a few days,
at other interesting places.
'â¢My route was this: From New York to
Antwerp, thence to Brussels and men to
Cologne. From there I went up the Rhine
to Rudesheim, thence to Weisbaden and
from there to Frankfort, Heidelberg,
Sirassburg and Constance. Thence I pro
ceeded to Kohr-aci), in Switzerland;
thence to St. Gall and thence to Zunco.
"Then 1 ascended Mount Rigi to its top,
and go^ng down on the other side crossed
Lake Lucerne to Lucerne. From there ray
course led to Milan, to Verona, Venice,
Padua, Florence, Rome, Naples ana Pom
peii. From Pompeii I returned to Rome
and went from there to Pisa, Genoa and
Turin. Going tbrough the Mont Cenis
tunnel, 1 proceeded to Aix-les-Bains, to
Paris and then to London.
â¢'The traveler should make op his mind
that he is gointr to be inconvenienced
daily," he said, "and he will be surprised
how comfortably he can live abroad. The
bes ! tiling to do is to follow the customs
of the country he is visiting. I iounJ I
need not hesitate to ask question!, for I
invariably received polite answers. If an
American can let it be understood he is a
German he will travel a preat deal cheaper,
ior the Germans are known as the most
economical travelers in Europe. Further
more, they are thought fully os much of
as any otner nation.
"Six to eight weeks' study of German
and French before gjin? abroad is advis
able, and in that time one can learn
enough of both to enable him to get along
pretty fairly."
FRATERNAL FELLOWSHIP.
An Interesting Meeting of Sequoia Par
lor of tlie Native Sons â The
Koyal Arcauum.
Sequoia Parlor, one of the most active of the
Native Sons of the Golden West and I
the ore among the local parlors which has j
the reputation of having the largest average
attendance at escb meeting, haa an eventful!
time in Ycsemite Hal:, Native Sons' building, i
last Monday night. In the presence of a large .
membership it initiated six candidates in due !
form, and after the c;osÂ° of the parlor the de- |
gree team of the Exalted Order of Nincom- j
poops took charge of the hall and guarded the j
outer portals while they went through their
â wonderful, txhilnra'ing and highly instruc- j
tive ceremony of initiating a candidate into
the mysteries of the orJer.
Six members, attired in long flowing robes
of crimson silk ornamented with jewels and \
lace of great value and wearing strange shaped i
hoods and having their faces partly concealed j
by heif masks and beards, entered the hall in !
which the g^ure of the brilliant lighthad been
Bubdued, led by High Potential Nincompoop
John Griff, to the sound ot brÂ«h6 lnsrumoms
that were recovered from some of the buried
cities oi the Orient. In a silent manner the
sc-xtet pro"cc ltd to build an altar and to lay
upon tne floor a carpet of Mississippi siik of
extraordinary design, constructed with a view
to instant removal irom its position by strong
nnd willing hands at some time duriuc the
ceremonies.
The altar, hastily erected, was a wonderful
one, nnd :or fear that some one who mtm not h
member 01 the ordt r might be tempted to steal I
it there was a string a. it. All being in readi- j
ness, the high potential nincompoop called
the ro'.l, ench member answering to his title
In phrases c.as-ic, but strange, that none but
the initiated understood. Then the candidate
who had dared to express the opinion that he
would iike to solve (He secrets of the jrreht
order was marched into the hall, lea by two
attendantsâ for DC was olind to the world, his
Lyes having been bandaged by a kerchiei of
silk that hua once been worn by one of the j
Oriental nionarehs when taUing the degrees
in the days just after the flood. Having nn
swered a number of questions in a iatistacti.ry
manner, he was led to the .station of the high
po;ential sub-nincompoop and initiated into
the first degree in a most impressive manner.
Bo impressive was this that it will be a long
time before he will forget the effect it pro
duced upon him.
Tuon he was led to the cloth at silk for the
second degree, which whs a solemn lesson of
the manner in which a young man by the aid
of those ready to lend a heipmg hand ca-i rise
in the world, and then the candidate who had
Blood both tesis with remarkable fortitude
and showed that he would not flinch in the
hour oi need was led to ihe high executioner
and by him conducted to the eltar and there
riven a lesion to show how a young mÂ«n can
fall when there is a combination against him.
After that he was given the secret work, the
language of wlr.ch is full of meaning ihat me
raudidate cannot forget, and the;i he was noti
fied t.jat it bt-cunie his life duty to find addi
tional candidates for members. iip and he
promised that he would per.oria it.
Tnese ceremonies over, tne parlor was
thrown oven and a programme presented.
This was under the direction of President S.
A. White, and had been prepared by Loul-. M,
IJannai:, chairman of the good of the orier

LOOTED THE CASH
OF HIS BROTHER
Michael W Kinney Is on
Captain Lees' "Little
Book."
By Forgery He Stole the As
sets and Then Ab
sconded.
Deceived His Attorney, the Bank
Officers and th Probate Court
Judge.
A startling state of affairs has been dis
covered in the estate of Andrew J. Kinney,
deceased, snowing that a new way of loot
ing the estate of a dead man has been
developed in San Francisco.
The records of the Probate Court show
that Alichael W. Kinney liied a petition
tor appointment as administrator on the
18th oflast November. He told Attorney
EL G. Davis that the only assets of the
estate consisted of outstanding claims for
$100 and he thought the court fees ought
to be remitted. This suggestion was not
heeded, but it had the effect of impress
ing the lawyer's mind with the insignifi
cance of the estate.
As the resources of the estate were repre
sented to be shadowy in the extreme, and
as the administrator, who assumed to be
a brother of the deceased, was not in a
hurry to settle the business affairs of his
dead relative very little was done in the
matter beyond publishing a notice to
creditors to present their bills. None of
these did so for the reason that they had
Jill been paid .without order of court or
other formality, though in fact tney
amounted to only a very small mm as
the dead man was of frugal and thriity
nabits.
Upon the showing that the estate did
not aggregate over $100 in doubtful debts
the bond of the administrator was made
merely nominal, and in this regard both
the court and Attorney Davis were de
ceived.
A short time ago Mr. Davis was called
into consultation in a forgery case, and
through this means he learned for the
first time tnat Michael W. Kinney is a
former, an that one of his bondsmen is
also a forger.
This information led to an investiga
tion, and it was soon learned that the ad
ministrator had robbed the estate of his
dead brother and bad absconded. â 
T. c m thod of the former was simple
enough. He learned that the officers of
the bank had received information ol the
death of Andrew J. Kinney, and there
upon caused an advenisement tp be in
serted in an obscure weekly paper and
by Andrew J. Kinney, ostensibly
the man who had a deposit in the bank.
This notice was cleverly called to the at
tention of the bank officials, and therefore
when checks were from time to time pre
sented with the siinurated signature of
Andrew J. Kinney they were duly hon
ored. They were so cleverly executed
that the bank omcial3 had no idea that
they were spurious.
Tne forger was careful to give the ac
count a semblance of lively naturalness
by interspersing the drafts with a lew un
important deposits. Finally he got $2200
belonging to his dead brother, and then
he leit for parts unknown. Chief Crowley
18 looking for him, ana Captain Lees has
nis name on his ".Htle book," but up to
the present date they have no tidings of
his whereabouts. There is a general im
pression abroad that he is too smooth to
be caught.
KILLED BY CHAMPAGNE.
Verdict of the Coroner's Jury in the
Case of Millionaire John
M. Oakley.
"Came to his death from the excessive
use of liquor."
Such was the verdict of the Coroner's
jury in tne case of John M. Oakley, the
erratic Pittsburg millionaire banker and
broker who expired at the Palac? Hotel a
Jew days ago ns the result of a protracted
debauch, participated in by Beatrice
Booth, an Eastern adventuress.
Nothing beyond what has already been
related was brought out by the investiga
tion.
Dr. Martin testified that he had treated
Oakley lor alcoholism and had signed a
death certificate to the effect that he died
from that cause.
Dr. Morgan, the chemist of the Morgue,
stated that he had found carbolic ucid in
the stomach of the deceased, but was
unab c to say whether it came there from
the use of embalming fluids. He had
never known of embalming materials that
contained this ingredient.
Undertaker Wright, who took charge of
the embalming, stated that he did not
know the character of the ingredients
composing the embalming fluids, except
that they were poisonous.
Manager Kirknatrick of the Palace tes
tified regarding Oakley's inordinate thirst
for champagne and of the circumstances
of his arriving at the hotel.
The jury deliberated but a few moments
before returning the verdict mentioned.

CORNERED IN ANOTHER FALSEHOOD.
The President of the Amalgamated Woodworker Union Gives the
"Examiner" the Lie*
(U\[ot copyrighted. The Examiner is at liberty to republish.)
A large body of union workingmen last evening in open meeting denounced
the Monarch of Fakers for printing a false report of their proceedings and directed the
president to publish the following contradiction:
San Francisco, March 9, 1897.
To the Editor of The Call: In the Examiner of March 3 there appeared what pur
ported to be a report of Amalgamated Woodworkers' Union's meeting on the evening of
the 2& In it was the statement that this union decided to draft resolutions to be presented
to the Building Trades Council denouncing The Call and indorsing the resolutions of Car
penters' Union No. 22.
These statements are false and untrue, as no resolutions were passed concerning
The Call or authorizing the delegates to the B. T. C. to do so. No action whatever was
taken in this matter. J. Jorgensen,

ROBBED A GUNSTORE.
E. Me Aul Iff and C- P. Jamei Clev
erly Captured by Policemen
Clark and Snowball.
A clever capture of two burglars was
made early yesterday morning by Police
men L. C. Clark and A. L. Snowball on
California street.
E. McAuliff and C. P. James broke into
the cunsmith-store of L. Moller, 703 Cali
fornia street, about 4 o'clock, and Clark
observed McAuiiff coming out of the door.
Clark ordered him to throw up his hands
and he dropped on his knees begging for
m erey.
Just then Snowball appeared and draw
ing his revolver he dashed into the store.
He found James in the hallway and
promptly arrested him.
The burglars had forced open the front
door with a jimmy, breaking off the lock
and a portion of the panel. Then they
forced open a door ieadinsr from the hall
way into the store. Four Winchester rifles
and 1000 rounds of cartridges were found
in the hallway ready to be carried away
and a dozen revolvers were missiiii.', which
it is supposed they had stowed away
somewhere.
When searched some skeleton keys were
found in the pockets of tne two men and
on James were found a number of pawn
tickets for clothing and jewelry, supposed
to be the plunder from other burglaries.
They were booked on the charge of
burglary. Both are known as crooks and
Janus is a "dope liend."
Clark yesterday recovered from the
pawnshops two overqoats, a diamond
ring, diamond scarfpin and several
watches, which are now in the possession
of the property clerk tor identification.

ihe factory and got a reply that no such
order had been received, and notbine was

CLOSED BECAUSE
OF BAD PLUMBING
Doors of the Clement
School Locked and
Barred.
Dangerous Sanitary Conditions
Make the Move Im
perative.
Eight Hundred Pupils Who Will Be
Withcut a Scoool Until
Monday.
Yesterday at noon the Clement Gram
mar School closed its doors and 800 pupils
were left without a schoolhousc.
The school was closed with the sanction
of the president of the Board of Educa
tion, Barrington; Samuel L Waller, chair
man of the Health Committee; Dr. A. S.
Ltveiace, Health Officer, and Miss Mary
K. Callaghan, the principal of the school.
Th* closing of the doors of the Clement
School is the first move of importance of
the recently organized Health Committee
of the Board ol Education.
Samuel L. Waller, chairman of the
Health Committee, was the rirst to call
attention to the unsanitary condition of
the Geary-street sclioolhouse. He recom
mended that the entire sewerage system
of the school be altered, with the result
that the board instructed T. A. Burns,
chairman of the Buildings and Grounds
Committee, to attend to the matter ut
once.
Work was immediately begun, but the
seepage from the old and broken sewer
pipes was so intense that both Miss Bige
low ami Miss J. Lewis, two teachers who
bad classes in the basement of the build
ing, were obheed to complain to the prin
cipal. At Miss Callaguan's suggestion
Chairman Waller was sent for and he re
commended that President Barrington be
apprise I and thai the two basement
classes be ordered closed.
President Barrington brought the mat
ter to the attention ol Dr. J. P. Morse, the
chairman of the Committee of Public
Buildings of the Board of Health and of
Health Officer A. S. Lovelace. The result
of this conference was that it was decided
to close the school until the entire sewer
ace system can be renovated.
The impoverished condition of the edu
oatiooal treasury will make it impossible
for a complete renovation of the sewerage
to be made. However, new pipes will be
put in from the vaults to the street, and
after July the modern plumber will be
given carte blanche to place the whole
school in perfect order. As it is. a double
shift of men are busy up at the school.
Work is being pushed nieht and day, and
it is expected tnat the school will be ready
for the reception of the pupils on Monday
next.
The report of J. J. Sullivan, plumbing
inspector, is enough to make the heart of
even the stoutest quail.
Broken i-ewers, pipes, cesspools, rotten
foundations and drinking fountains with
out traps are but a few of the many
menaces tv health he found.
Strangely cnongh, the average attend
ance at the school was good and the sick
list comparatively small. This Director
Waller attributes to the fact that the
children at the Clement School are, for
the most part, well fed and warmly
clothed, and in a physical condition to
withstand disease.
The closing of the Clement School is
but one of the many surprises that the
Health Committee has up its sleeve.
SECURED BIG DAMAGES.
John XV. Dennlng's Succeaiful Suit for
Injuries Keceived iv the Service
of the State.
The suit of John W. Denning against
the State for $20,00:) damages for injuries
received on the State tug Governor Irwin
concluded yesterdny in a verdict for the
plaintiff for $10,000.
Denning was a deckhand on the Gov
ernor Irwin and was engaged in his duties
as such when he was hurt. When it was
necessary for one of the men to ascend
from the main deck to the top of the deck
bouse he was compelled to go up a ladder
fastened in its place with what i? known
as a '"cabin-door hook."
Denning w^s the victim of this ladder.
In March, 1895, he was working on board
the tug, and found it necessary to a*cend
to the top of the deckhouse to fix one of
the lights. He went part way up the lad
der and then the fastenings gave way ana
he was thrown violently to the deck. A
severe and permanent injury to bis spine
was the result.
Through his attorneys, Henley, Bigelow
& Costeilo and D. J. Bannington, Den
ning brought suit, and the big sum al
lowed yesterday was the result.

WILL NOT FLY THE
ASSOCIATION FLAG
Disaffection Over the Pacific
Inter -Club Yacht
Regatta.
One Member of the Organization
Withdraws in Dissat
isfaction.
San Franciscos Claim They Were Not
Fairly Treated by the Com
mittee in Charge.
A squabble that has caused the with
drawal of one club from the Pacific Inter
club Yachting Association has arisen, and
it is said that the end is not yet. The
trouble began over the regatta of Septem
ber 9 iast, when the McDonoush cup was
the main object sailed for and all the
yaclits were put in their finest racing trim
in he hope of winning the much-coveted
trophy.
The association was originally composed
of the Pacific, San Francisco, Corinthian,
Encinal and California yacht clubs and its
formation was the result of much hard
study on the part of thos 1 who have
given the sport the most attention. The
recatta was a great event of the year in
yachting circles and each club sent its
fleetest boats, manned by their most ex
perienced sailors, to compete. '
One of the main conditions governing
the race, which was for sloops not over
thirty feet racing length, was that ail
those participating must be amateur
yachtsmen in the fullest sense of the word,
and that is where the hitch came.
Among the boats belonging to the San
Francisco Yacht Club the Catherine is
considered a crack, and she was sent into
the fray with full confidence that she
would carry off the honors.
She was protested by o>her owners on
the ground that she curried among her
crew a professional yachtsman, and the
regatta committee, after hearing testi
mony and considering the matter, dis
qualified the fleet sloop.
Then there was anger among the mem
bers of the SÂ«n Franoisco Yacht Club and
the majority declared that they would
never again sail their boats in the associa
tion's regattas.
The matter simmered fora while, the
feeling between the club and the associa
tion growing stronger the while, until the
annual meeting of the San Francisco
club, which took place last month.
I. Gutte was commodore at that time,
and previous ;o the election of officers,
which took place at the gatherine, he
offered a resolution to the effect that tue
club withdraw from the association and
refuse to longer participate in the reeattas.
In support of his measure lie recited the
circumstances umler which the Catherine
had been disqualified and denied that her
owners had in any way v oiated the rules
governing the contest. He characterized
that action of the n-cat a committee as
unsportsmanlike and petty, and asked the
club to show its spirit by withdrawing
without delay.
The majority of the members were in
accord with tne commodore and the reso
lution was adopted without a dissenting
voice. The Inter-club Association was
notified in a short and curt communica
tion that the San Francisco Club had de
cided to withdraw from the organization.
No reason for this action was assigned,
but it is perfectly well understood by the
other members of the association and has
intensified the feeling that existed prior
to the withdrawal.
There are some members of the San
Francisco Club who thought the action
hasty, but they are in the minority and
have said little or nothing regarding the
matter.
The San Francisco Yacht Club is the
oldest organization of the kind on the
Pacific Slope and numbers among its
members some of the most enthusiastic
yachtsmen in this City.
Secretary R. R. I'Hommedieu of the
Inter-club Association, through whose
efforts tiie organization was formed, stated
yesterday that the action of the regatta
committee had not been taken hastily
and that the owner of the Catherine had
plainly violated the rules governing the
race by having a man on board who toad
fallen under the suspicion of being a pro
fessional.
The committee regretted exceedingly
that it had been compelled to di-qualify
the sloop, but under the regulations there
was no alternative, and to have disre
garded the protest of those who claimed
that the Catherine had an outsider on
board wouid have been to invite still
greater dissatisfaction.
CHANGE Of OPERA.
The French Company to Open in
"JL'Africaine. "
Tl;e French Grand Opera Company ar
rived here early yesterday morning and
will positively open its engagement ut the
California Theater this evening. There
has, however, been found a necessity to
change the bill for the opening perform
ance, and instead of giving '"Trovatore"
this evening the company will present
"L'Africaine" and will give "Trovatore"
on Friday evening instead. Otherwise the
repertoire remains the same as first an
nounced, which is as follows: Saturday
matinee, "Faust"; Saturday evening,
"Misa Helyett"; Tuesday evening, the
16tb. "Sigurd."
Thursday evening, the 18th, the double
bill of "Noces de Jeannette" and "Cavai
leria Kusticana"; Saturday matinee, "La
Juive"; Saturday night, "Voyaee of
Suzette," to be followed by "Les Hugue
nots," "Dragons de Viliars," "Aida,"
"Mignon," "Carmen," etc. Word was re
ceived from trie company last night giv
ing information that everything was in
order and that the singers will give a
splendid performance of the opera. The
audience this evening will be a very bril
liant one, the sale of seats being very
large.
LIGHT TO INGLESIDE.
The Improvement Club la Hopeful of
the Action of the Supervisor*.
The Lakeview and Ingleside Improve
ment Club held a meeting last night. AN
tention was called to the fact that from
San Jose avenue to the ocean not a glim
mer of ligbt can be seen along the main
road, except that which is used within the
houses of those who reside in the neigh
borhood.
Secretary Thomas Douglas reported for
the light committee to the effect that the
petition which had been signed by the
members of the club had been presented
to the Supervisors, and by that body re
ferred to the Committee on Street Lights
with an apparent fr:endliness which gave
an assurance of tavorable consideration.
The petition was for the lights on the
road.
William Fierson's motion that street
signs be printed and placed on the street
corners at the expense of the club was
unanimously carried, and J. A- pastman
was authorized to perform the work.
On the suggestion of Chairman Corbin
William Pierson offered a lesolution
