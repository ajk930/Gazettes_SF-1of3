LONDON, Eng., March 17.â The Times
has au Athens dispatch saying that a
strict blockade of Cretan ports began to
day. The blockading of the Greek ports,
the dispatch says, will, judging from
present appearances, not bej;in for some
time.
The writer of the dispatch gives details
of the state of anarchy that prevails at
Candia and Retirco, whsre, it is stated,
the Mussulmans are looting the property
of the Christians. The writer further says
that the refugees who have arrived at
Caniia from the Papyao are being seri
ously ill-treated.
According to this dispatch, only a de

ordered to Sphakia. The departure of the

This is a pen picture of the downfall of one of America's greatest "Copyrighted" Pugilists, wrecked by Hearst's "New Journalism." Corbett's Waterloo in the Carson arena yesterday was viewed by about five thousand
spectators. During the first half of the fight Corbctt seemed to be gaining the victory, but later his vitality waned and Fitzsimmons had him at his mercy. During the fourteenth and last round the once great "Our Jim"
protruded his stomach, making an "opening" that Fitz did not overlook. Quickly the Cornishman struck the "wind" and followed it with a blow over the heart that sent Jim to his knees, where he remained for fifteen seconds
and was couated out. Ou thj Second Pa;e of "Tue Call" i* a diagram showing every blow received by the contestants.

Despite the prevailing impression that
war is imminent the writer says there is
reason to believe that an earnest desire
exists that a peaceful solutiou of the diffi

Who View the Battle Say the Contest
Was Fought Squarely, but There
Is a Suspicion in the Minds of
Those Who Bet on "Ex

All Is Not Right.
The Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight is over,
and a mighty sigh of relief ascends to
high heaven from the universal throat.
Even Nevada may have cause to rejoice
and be exceeding glad that the thing is
over and done.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The correspondents believe it was a fair
fight, and there are many who think like
wise. But there are those who have
viewed the mill from its inception to the
knock-out blow with deep suspicion. The
part played in the game by the Examiner2
and its New York particeps-criminis, the
Journal, no doubt caused thousands to
keep away from Carson. It was remem
bered that the Examiner took a part in
the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight, and that
the referee supplied by it for that contest
gave a decision that was denounced far
and near as unfair and false. Yet that de
cision meant a large sum of money in
the pockets of men on the Examiner and
a heavy loss to honest sportsmen.
With the odium of this disgraceful
affair fresh upon it, the Examiner began
to boom the fight at Carson. Corbett
was its protege. He and Fitzsimmons
were contracted with to keep their infor
mation for the Examiner exclusively.
Other newspapers were given the cold
shoulder, and the public was taught to
look upon the Examiner as the only au
thority on the condition of the men.
Whatever came from the pens of writers
was in Corbett's favor. On the morning
of the fight its business manager and
sporting editor, over their own signatures,
declared that Corbett was the better man,
and if Fitzsimmons won something little
short of a miracle would have to be re
corded. Naturally the betting was in
Corbett's favor, and the men who have
lost, like those who lost in the Sharkey-
Fitzsimmons fight, may thank the Ex
aminer for their misfortune.
The question that must be answered is
this : Did the Examiner, with its ex
clusive information, willfully lie about the
men's condition, causing the majority of
bettors to place their money on Corbett
while it and those who enjoyed its confi
dence placed their wagers on Fitzsim
mons, or was its corps of much-advertised
special writers mistaken, grievously mis
taken, in their estimates? Perhaps this
new rival of the Police Gazette prefers
the former horn of the dilemma. It is
used to being called a liar, but it is not
used to having its stars pilloried as in
competent.
No matter what the answer may be.
No matter what the answer may be,
one thing is certain, thousands have lost
money through the Examiner's misrepre
sentations and pugilism has been dealt
-another body blow.

Another evidence of the Examiner's in

the fact that he was the guest of the
paper in the special train that came down
from Carson last night. It is whispered,
however, that the copyright on his work
has expired and that several volumes of

It was a frosty St. Patrick's day for
Jim Corbett and many more.
CARSON, New, March 17.â Robert Fitz
simmons is now the champion heavy
weight pugilist of the world, and there is
mourning to-night in the Corbett camp.
It was a great fight, and there is no ques
tion that from a fighter's point of view
the best man won. Corbett, as las been
already stated in The Call, lived a speedy
life since the time he defeated John L.
Sullivan in New Orleans, and as a result
his vitality cannot stand a heavy strain,
which was proven to several thousand
people who witnessed the great battle of
the century. From a scientific point of
view Corbett is superior to Fitzsimmous,
but he was not in the race when it came
to bard punching.
Fitzsimmons' wonderful endurance,
combined with his ability todeliver heavy
punishment, won him the great struggle
for pugilistic supremacy. Corbett, so to
speak, wa* a.ll over Mm. bo; far a* jabbing
is concerned, and he bit Fitz at least ten

times to the once that the Cornishman hit
him, but Fitzsimmons' blows were hard
and te'.ling. Time and again Corbett put
bis left oa his opponent's face and alter
nated by planting his right on Fitzsim
mons' ribs. Time and again Corbett
| beautifully ducked away from wild swing
ing blows, which had they landed would
have quickly brought the battle to an end.
As a clever tighter and a great ring general
Corbett stands to-day at the heart of
the pugilistic army, but physically he has
seen his best days and cannot possibly go
a hard race when forced to cut out a lively
pace.
After the sixth round, when Corbett had
Fitzsimmons almost out, he seemed to go
to pieces, his blows lacked steam and he J
was puffing after each sharp rally. As the
battle wore on Corbett toed the scratch at
the commencement of each round looking
like & man in distress. He Knew that his
j vitality was waning, and he nursed what
ever little strength he possessed in tapping
his opponent on the nose, from which the
blood was flowing fast. Occasionally he
grew courageous, and on receiving a blow
from his antagonist he would rally and
smash Fiizsimmom several times in
return on face and body, but the Cornish
man, although frequently retiring to his
corner in a weak condition, would invar
iably come to time at the sound of the
gong as fresh as if he had just commenced
the game.
Fitzsimmons' recuperative powers are
extraordinary, and it is his wonderful
vitality and ability to take punishment
that wins him his battles. He cannot hit
a straight blowâ at least, he did not land
a straight lead during the fightâ but his
swings and crooks are terrific. Some of
the swinging rights that Corbett warded
off with his aims left marks on those
members, and, no doubt. Corbett much ]
preferred that they were ducked than
stopped. Another thing about Fitzsim
mons that puzzles many of the best
judges of pugilism is his awkward and
shuffling style. In fact, he looked like a
raw reoruit before the scientific and pol
ished Corbett; but be is a fighter and the
other man is the cleverest exponent of
the game.
I informed Professor Walter Watson of
the Olympic Club, who sat next to me
during the contest, that Corbett (that was
after the second round) was not anything
lite the man who faced Peter Jackson
about seven years ago In the old Califor
nia Club. He did not seem to have that
ability to send torth a swift blow from the
shoulder which he was possessed of then.
The fact of the matter is that Corbett has
lost vitality, and although he may look
perfectly sound and trained to the hour
he is wanting in something, and that
something is a constitution, which once
lost can never be recovered. He retains
his remarkable cleverness, however, but
in prize-fighting cleverness and speed
must be supported by a physique which is
sound, or at least not so far impaired.
It was a sad sight to see Corbett when
he was knocked down in the fourteenth
round struggling to regain his pins. With
his left hand placed over the spot on
which Fitzsimmons bad planted his big
right-hand glove the defeated champion
made a desperate struggle to rise, but the
effect of the blow wai too much. The
damage was done and Corbett reeled back
against the ropes, where he was counted
out. M. J. Geary.

than they were this morning. After years

of disappointment the two greatest fight
ers of the century were ready to meet to
decide the heavy-weight championship of
the world, the ownership of a purse of
$15,000 with a side stake of $5000 and a
prospective fortune for the winner. It
was no wonder, therefore, ttiat Dan Stuart
in Carson and the men at Cook's Ranch
and Shaws Springs watshed eagerly for
the appearance of Old Sol above the hills,
for on the weather alone the battle de
pended for success and the avoidance of
the oft -time obnoxious postponement.
The absence of rain or snow and a moder
ately clear morning would have satisfied
the sports, and their thanks to the
weather deities were fervent indeed when
they saw the sun rise in all his majesty to
shine benignly through one of the most
glorious days ever experienced in this
locality. Every one was astir by 7 o'clock.
Both the training quarters were visited by
a constant stream of vehicles, and those
who were satiÂ«fie 1 with the condition of
the men from previons visits stood around
the street corners discussing the probable
outcome.
By 8:30 o'clock the outer prates of the
huge wooden arena were thrown open
anJ those who wore not fortunate enough
to possess tickets for the reserved seats
got through their break/ast hurriedly and
hastened to obtain the most advantageous
seats on the bleachers. The iolders of
numbered seats took thing 3 more easily
and did not start for the scene of action
until about 9:30. The battle was adver
tised for 10 o'clock, but the special train
from the East did not arrive until long
after this hour, and it was evident that
Corbett and Fitzsimmons know that
there was no hurry, for they took their
time about reaching the ringside. By 11
o'clock the arena was comfortably filled
and nearly all the ticket- holders had
taken their seats. The seating capacity of
the arena is estimated at 18,000, and when
the crowd were all seated it was computed
that about 5000 people had paid for ad
mission. While the epectators were await
ing the arrival of the principals and their
aids they put in the time listening to a
series of challenges to the winner, which
were quito plentiful. Billy Jordan chal
lenged on behalf of John L. (Sullivan, and
the old-time champion was greeted with
a round of applause when he doffed his
silk hat and clambered through the ropes

to make the customary speech. On be
half of Joe Goddard and Tom Sharkey,
Billy Madden hurled "dens" at the head
of the prospective champion. â¢
Fitzsimmons was the first to reach the
dressing-room which had been selected for
him on the north side of the arena. Mar
tin Julian ana Roe her led the way for Bob,
who was driven by his wife in a neat
single buggy. They were followed by
Hickey and Stelzner. The little proces
sion passed through the crowd without
receiving much applause and got into
their quarters at 10:41. Corbett left
Shaw Springs in a ciosed carriage and
was accompanied by White, Delaney and
Judge Lalor. His brother Joe, with
Woods, Jeffries and McVev, followed in s
stage and had Jim's two mascots, the
collies. They arrived at 11:10 and wen tat
once to the dressing-room. At 11:50 Mrs.
Fitzsimmons left the dressing-room and
took a seat in a box directly behind her
husband's corner. There were about a
dozen women sitting in different boxes.
At 11:55 a scattered round of applause an
nounced Fitzsimmons' appearance. He
wore a Turkish toweling bathrobe of blue
and white and was followed by his sec
onds. He had scarcely got half way to
the ring when Corbett appeared in his
aisle at the opposite side of the ring. He
wore a dark-gray, brown-striped dress
ing-gown. Both men reached the plat
form almost together, but Fitzsimmons
was first up the steps inside the ring. The
lanky Australian stood in his corner for a
moment and sized up his rival with a pe
culiarly cool and critical searching glance.
Then he paced np and down his own side
of the ropes, rubbing his hands together
with a nervous motion.
Corbett appeared very cool, and chatted
confidently with his friends at the ring
side and with his seconds. The gloves
were then handed in by Wheelock and tbe
men donned them. Charley White looked
after Fiizsimmons' fitting and Martin Ju
lian periormed a like office for Corbett.
Master of Ceremonies Biliy Madden intro
duced the men and Referee George Siler
announced the officials and seconds. In
Corbett's corner were Charley White, Billy
Delaney, Jack McVey and Biliy Woods.
Fitzsimmons' aids were Martin Julian,
Ernest Koeber, Dan Hickey and Jack
Stelzner. Refere6 George Siler called tbe
men together and said, "I don't suppose
it is necessary for me to instruct you?"
Both quickly shook thtir heads. "You
both know the rules as well as I do," Siler
continued.
"Yes, yes," Corbett answered. Fitz
nodded his head emphatically and Siler
stepped aside. Corbett walked toward Fitz
simmons with his right ha.:<i outstretched,
but Fitzsimmons shook: his nead slowly,
but emphatically, and half-turned back to
his own corner. Corbett smiled and stopped
short. Fiizsimmons' action was received
with hisses and cheers. Official timekeeper
Muldoon motioned to Lou Houseman of
Chicago, who held the watch for Fitzsiiu
mons, and to Jimmy Colville of Boston,
who acted as timekeeper for Corbett. and
then Muldoon clanged the gong and the
battle was under way. During the con
test the crowd seemed impressed with the
greatness of the struggle and the fair and
manly way in which it was waged. Good
order was maintained until the last mo
ment, and after the first couple of rounds
the telling po<nts made by either man
were cneered impartially.
After Corbett came to bis senses the two
pugilists shook hands, Jim baying indi
rectly apologized for his outbreak after
the contest was decided. After Mrs. Fitz
simmons bad embraced her husband, ut
terly regardless of his sanguinary appear
ance, the victorious procession beaded for
the dressing-room.
A wash and a rnbdown improved the
champion's appearance a hundredfold,
and 13 >b doffed his golf cap in response to
cheers as he drove from the arena. His
better half's rosy cheeks were a great de
gree rosier at the applause. She shifted
the reins to her left band and waved a
tiny cambric and lace handkerchief in
quitting. Tbe pair bowled along at a
merry pace to Cook's ranch, where Bob's
appetite showed no diminution after his
exertions. When Corbett had been rubbed
down he dressed quietly and got into a
carriage, whicn was waiting. He drove to
the depot and got on board the fast special
for San Francisco.
Tbe betting underwent very little change
before the battle, and the men entered
the ring at 100 to 70 on Corbett. Few big
individual bets were laid, but during the
progress of the fight Mose GunsL of San
Francisco bet $500 even on Corbett with
jf ittsburg Phil. The latter won $4000, and
would have wagered much more money at
the ringside if he could have obtained re
liable stakeholders. Paris mutuals paid
$13 50 for 1 on combination Fitzsimmons,
Green and Hawkins.
FAIR AND SQUARE.
United Associated Presses'
Reporters Tell How
Corbett Lost by
One Unwary
Move.
CARSON, Nev, March 17.â After two
years of doubt and vexatious postoone
ments, the heavy-weight championship of
the world was decided b?yond cavii when
Robert Fitzsimmons sent James J. Cor
bet t helpless to his knee with a left-hand
blow under the heart, after one minute
and forty-fire seconds of the fourteenth
round of their battle in the arena here
this afternoon.
The great contest was won in the sim
plest manner, and the knockout was tbe
result of one unwary move on tbe part of
Corbett. After tbe first minute of the
fourteenth round had been ep&nt in a few
harmless clinches and counters, Fitzslir
mons made a fake lead with bis right for
tbe jaw. It was a simnle ruse, but it
caught the Californian napping. Instead
of keeping his body "inclined forward
and throwing back bis bead just a trifle
to allow the blow, which was very
light, to pass, Corbett contemptuously
bent his bead and cbest backward ana
thus protruded his abdomen. Fitzsim
mons' small eyes flashed and, like light
ning, he saw and availed himself of his
advantage. Drawing back his left, he
brought it up with terrible force, the fore
arm rigid and at right angles to the upper
arm. With the full power ol his -wonder
ful driving musclos brought into play, the
Australian fairly ripped the blow up to
the pit of Corbett's stomach at a point just
under the heart. Corbett was lifted clean
off his feet, and as he pitched forward
Fitzsimmons shot his right np and
around, catching Jim on the jaw and
accelerating his downfall. Corbett sank
on his left knee, and with his outstretched
right grasped the ropes for support. His
left arm worked convulsively up and
down, while bis face twitched In agony.
Referee Siler threw np bis bands on the
call of ten and left tbe ring.
There were some cries of "foul" when
the refereo declared Corbett out, but they
were unheeded by anybody, as tbe battle
was won fairly and squarely.
The defeat nearly drove Corbett wild.
When be was able to feel his feet after bis
seconds bad helped him to bis corner be
broke away from them and rushed at Fits
simmons, who bad not left the ring. A
ecene of dreadful confusion ensued. The
ring was crowded with an excited mob,
but Corbett burst through them and
struck at Fitzsimmons. The Australian
kept his arms by his sides and with a great
deal of generosity made allowance for
Corbett's half-demented condition. Bob
merely duck -d under the blow and wben
Corbett clinched with him and struck him
j a feeble blow on the ear the champion only
smiled. It was with great difficulty that
Billy Brady and the seconds succeeded in
quieting Corbett down and getting him
back to the dressing-room.
The neht was clean and speedy. It
demonstrated two fact;â that Corbett is
the cleverest boxer of his weight in the
world and that Fitzsimmons is able to bit
him. The California boy smothered the
Cornisbman with left jabs n the face and
right and left body blows. Fitzsimmons'
most effective attack was a semi-fake left
swing followed with a quick half arm
hook. The first time he triad it in the
third round. Jim threw back bis bead
from the fake, coming forward for a coun
ter when he though! Fitzsimmons' glove
was comfortably past bis jaw. Quick as
a flash Bob doubled back and barely
missed Jim's jaw with the hook. Cor
bett's smile died away for an instant, and
he took no more chances on countering
on that particular form of lead afterward.
The battle, as predicted, was fought on
purely scientific and almost new princi
ples. Neither of the men took any advan
tage of the privileges allowed them under
the London prize-ring rules, and mere was
very little hitting in clinches. Corbett
made no attempt to bring around bis right
in breaking away, probably because Fi:z
simmons held up his elbows too high.
Jim's only effort in the way of a parting
shot was a full right uppercnt, which be
brought around very clumsily and failed
to land by at ieast a foot every time be
tried. He did get in one good upoercut
in the fourth round, splitting Bob's under
lip and starting the blcod in a thick j
stream. Several times the men clinched V
and parted with both hands up. Fre- ;
quently Bob worked Jim into a corner
and reacned for him right and left with
blows that would win any championship j
battle if they landed. Fitzsimmons him
self admits that Corbett shuffled and side
stepped his way to safety in a manner
which simply dazed the Australian.

That Make Fitz
Champion.
CARSON, Nev., March 17.â Here is tha
story of the great battle told in detail by
rounds:
Round Iâ Time-keeper Mnldoon pulled on
the gong string at 12:08 o'clock. The men
laced each other, Corbel t with his back to the
sun and Fitzsimmons bl'nking slightl. as the
bright rays struct him full in the face. Cor
bett danced around lightly on his toes, Flu- .
'Simmons covering his ground more slowly.
Both were cautious and smiling. They feinted â 
for an opening, bnd Fitzilmmons seemed in
clined to force matters. Corbett broke ground .
and danced about hisopponent. Fitzsimmons ,
forced his man into a corner, and was the â¢
first to Had with a Jeft swing, which missed
Jim's bend by about ten feet. The C*lifor
nian did no better in his first nttempt.
More feinting at long range followed.
Fitzsimmons forced Corbett into a rally and
uppercut him lightly in the clinch. In a mix
up which followed no damage was done. Cor
bett shot a light left on the body and broka
away clean. Fitzsimmons swung his leit, but
missed. A hard exchange of lefts followed, in
which the Australian had a little bit the worst
of it. F;;zsimmoiis then adopted aggressive
tactics and rushed Corbett to iiis own cnrnor
but Jim got out of danger and sent, in a heavy
rightonthe body as hÂ«; slipped away. Fitz
simmons put a hard left ovÂ«r the heart and
Jim swung wildly with his leit, but landed
hiÃ right on Fitz's wind. Coibett ran into a
clinch, but they quickly broke clean. Fitz
was still forcing mailers, but a hard left swing .
put him on the defensive for a moment. Jim
swung his leit on the heart and they came to
gether. On the breakaway Bob sent a vicious
left uppercut to the jaw. A Clinch followed,
but the meu broke without a blow as the gong
sounded.
Round 2â Fitzsimmons opened with a left
swing, but missed' his mark. They came to a
clinch and were rather slow in breaking away.
A vicious left from Fitzsimmons just grazed
Corbett's breast, and again they w^re inclined
to hug In the Clinch. After the Dreakaway
Fitzsimmons put on steam and Jim broke
ground before the Australian, although the
latter contented himself with feinting and did
not lead. Finally Jim stood his ground and
sent in a neat left on the face and a right on
the body, dancing away without a return.
Fitzsimmons seemed determined to keep on
the aggressive and again forced Jim into his
corner, swingine iight and left for the body,
but Jim's fast footwork took him out of reach.
Fitzsimmons came into a clinch, and in the
breakaway got a stiff left uopereut. Bob
swung wildly right and left Some very pretty
defensive fighting followed, neither man be
ing: able to eel inside the other's guard. Long
range sparring, in which Cv<rbett did most of
the leading, followed. Jim soaked a hard left
on tue ribi and repeated the blow a moment
later. Fitzsimmons smiled and tried to corner ,
Jim, who dodged quickly out of reach and
came buck with a left on the wind. Another
left on the stomach brought the round to a
close, with the men in a clinch. It was clear
ly Corbett's on points.
Round 3â Jim opened with a rush and sent
a left jab hard on the wind. FitzÂ«irumons did
not like it and tried to rush in return, but
was wild with right and left. Jim stopped
another left lead lor the heart and countered
smartly on the stomach. Corbett put another
left on the wind and a rieht on the side of the
head. Bob's stomach showed a red blotch
where the Californian's left struck. Bob took
a hand in the forcing and lasheil out wildly ,
missing with both hands. After a little long
rantre work Jim shot right aud left on the
body aud Bob came into v clinch and hooked
hin right on the enr before ihey separated, i
Corbett shot a terrific right on Bob's side and
followed with a fast left on the wind. Both.
men were breaking carefully aud cleanly out
of clinches. Bob's left iouiut the wind, but
Corbett Kwung risrht oil the jaw in the clinch
that followed. Then Jim put his left on the i
body, and as Bob came in to clinch Jim piled k
two stiff rights on the wind and followed up I
with another on tha body. Fltzsimuiont m
landed a nice left on the jaw after missing the W
right lead for the stomacn. A clinch followed T
anl Bob got in a straiten t drive on the wind.
A little hugning followed and lor the first time
the referee came between the men and broke
them. Before the tÂ»e 1 sounded a cessation
Fitzsimmons put a neat right on the b. dv and
swung his left to the jaw and the honors were
fairly even.
Round 4â Jim again led off with a left,
which failed to land, and they clinched
and broke clean. Bob tried with a
right lead for the head but missed,
and Corbett put a hard right punch i
on the body and in the clinch swung his right
to the jaw. Bob wrs determined but slow.
Corbett commenced to make things pretty
lively, bui they clinched three times without â 
a blow being struck. A light left swing on the
jaw from Corbett was returned with interest
dv Fitzsimmons as far as inteution went, but
Bob's right and lett missed the mark by
inches. Corbett lauded two heavy rights on
the wind and put a straight left flush in the
face. Then Jim planted his right under Bob's
ear and easily escaped a right and left. Jim
sent his right to the wind Â«nd Bob clinched,
taking an uppercut on the chin before they
broke. Corbeit seemed to cling to Fitzsim
mons in ihe clinches as if to save his strength.
Fi zftimmons shot out his left with terrific
force on the wind and swung a vicious ricbt
for the jaw, which was short. Corbeit's left
landed on the stomach and he repeated the
dose a moment later. He swung, missing
right and left, but on his third trial he sent his
right to the stomach and followed up with
two swift lefts on the jiw. CorDett was <in the
aggressive now, and after mi-sing a leit for

stomach. Time was called with the men

CauHous Sparring Winds Up in Swift
Fighting end Jim Corbstt's
y Deft at.
â¢ CARSON, Nev., March 17.â At exactly
two minutes before 12 o'clock, both men
â¢ came from their dressing-rooms, almost
simultaneously, and walked to the ring,
followed by their seconds. Julian was the
first man to jump into the ring, followed
by Fitzsimmons, Roeber, Hickey and
Stelzner. Corbett was the first man to
enter bis Â«^>rner, followed by Brady, De
laney* John Donaldson, McVey and
Woods. Fitzsiramons and Corbeti were
both attired in lons dressing gowns. Cor
belt took the southeast corner of the ring
with his back to the sun. He leaned on
the ropes facing the audience and bowed
to his many friends about him. Fitzsim
- moiis paced up and down in the opposite
corner, apparently quite nervous.. Billy
Madden, the master of ceremonies, and
George Slier, the referee, then entered trie
rim-, and Madden walKed over to the
ropes on the west side to address the
audience.
Fitz said aloud to Siler: "Why didn't
you get Billy Jordan to be master of cere
monies?" but Siler did not reply. "How
are you, Jim," called Harry Veuve from
one of -the boxes. "First rate," replied
Corbett, smiling. He appeared very cool
and chatted with his seconds and bowed
and smiled all over the., house to his
friend?. Brady tied Corbett's colors to
the post in his corner of the ring. They
were an American flag and a green flag.
Fitzsimmons appeared very nervous. He
. was rubbing his hands and tapping his
feet on the floor; then he arose and paced
up and down, occasionally glancing over
into Corbett's corner. Corbett went to j
the center of the ring and danced around,
trying the resined floor to see if he would
slip on it. Apparently he was satisfied,
for he walked back to his corner and sat
down. There was a great uproar in -the
auiience, but finally Billy Madden gained
sufficient attention to speak and he said:
. "Gentlemen, you will please keep order
while this fight is going on for the world's
championship. If you make noise or ex
citement you interfere with the men while
they are fighting, and another thing, there
are ladies present. The officials of this
cjntest are: Referee, George Siler; offi
cial timekeeper, William Muldoon; time
keeper ior Corbett, Jimmy . Coiviile of
Boston; timekeeper for Fitzsimmons, Lou
Houseman of Chicago; seconds for Fitz
simmons, Roeber, Julian, Stelzner and
- HicKey; seconds for Corbett, Delaney,
Charley White, McVey, Woods and Pro
fessor John Donaldson."
' He then walked over toward Fitziirn
raons and said: "I now take pleasure in
introducing to you Bob Fitzsimmons,"
then walking to Corbett's corner, he an
nounced "James J. Corbett." The crowd
Â« cheered heartily at the mention of each
man's name, ugh probably the loudest
for Corbett. The referee, George Siler of
Chicaeo, was also introduced. When Fitz
airuxnons threw off his dressing-gown he
was seen to bo clad in dark blue trunks
with a red stripe running around the edge.
For a belt he wore a number of small
American flags stitched together. Corbett
was clad in red trunks with the stars and
' stripes draped around him for a belt.
-. The gloves were then fastened on the
men's hands by their seconds. Fitzsim
mons' were colored a light shade of green,
.while Corbett' = were of tan. It was plain
to be seen that Corbett bad the best of
" corners. The sun was directly in his
1 back, while it shone square in FiizsHm
mons' face as he sat: down. One of his
seconds, however, kept his head protected
i from the rays by shading his face with a
' large fan. At last the men were ready
and Corbett arose and walked " toward
Fitzsimmons' corner, proffering his hand.
* Fitz, who was standing at the time,
turned and advanced toward him with
. outstretched hand when Julian quickly
stepped forward and stopped him, at
the same time raising his hand and wav
â  ing Corbett back, saying: "Nope, no,
Pete; nope, no shake hands. We re
-4 fuse." The crowd hissed a little at this
display of bad breeding and lack of prize
fightincr etiquette, while Fitz and Corbett
turned to their corners. At precisely 7
minutes, past 12 o'clock the seconds and
all but the principals and referee with
drew from the ring and the gong sounded

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 1897.
"HE WHIPPED ME FAIRLY AND SQUARELY."
Corbett Admits Like a Man That His Own Neglect Caused Him
to Lose the Championship to Fitzsimmons*
CARSON, NEV., March 17. â "I never saw such a clever man in my life," said Fitzsimmons this
evening. "He got away from me time and again when 1 thought I had him dead to rights. I knew I could
wear him out, so 1 kept coming right along until my opportunity appeared. He was weak in the last round,
and all his cleverness could not keep him out of that left punch under the heart. The only blow that
really worried me was the one which split my lip. The others I never felt. He fought fair, and hereafter
he may have my respect if he continues to treat me right."
Corbett's version of his own Waterloo did not vary greatly from Fitzsimmons': " I made a mistake in
not keeping away. Fitz 1 knew to be a terrific puncher, but 1 never calculated on his being able to reach
me. If the sixth round had lasted ten seconds longer 1 would have landed him to a certainty. His nose
was clogged with blood and his legs were wobbling. The gong sounded just as I was about to plug him
with my right and end the battle. He recuperated wonderfully and I stayed away from him until I thought
he was about ripe for another drubbing at short range. My neglect in not standing off when he tapped me
on the cheek in the fourteenth lost me the championship. That heart punch simply choked me. 1 could
not breathe or move for fifteen seconds, and it was several minutes before I realized that I had committed a
breach of etiquette in trying to follow up my opponent after he put me out. I meant it when I said I would
be his friend hereafter. He whipped me fairly and squarely, but I don't think he is the best man yet, and
we will have another go if money can bring him into the ring."

"MANLIEST OF ALL MODERN SPORTS."
Senator Stewart and Representative Newlands of |
Nevada Say That Pugilism Is Preferable to
Football and Other Athletic Exercises.
â WASHINGTON, D. C, March 17.â Senator Stewart said to The Call correspon
dent this afternoon liter the result of tbe CorbetfFitzsimmons tight became known
In Washington: "The severe censure by a lame portion of the press of the Legisla
ture ana peoDle of Nevada for authorizing prize-fighting in that State is unreasonable.
It assumes that the other States tolerate nothing equally repre
hensible, if prize-fighting be reprehensible. Our limited knowl
edge of the physical sports encouraged and patronized through
out the country leads us to the belief that there is more that is
beneficial and less that is harmful in prize-fighting than in the
football game, boat racing, or any of the popular exhibitions of
physical force in which the youth of the country are engaged.
The football game especially is destructive of the life and health
nf a vaat number of young men every year who would make
useful and honorable citizens in the various callings in life
where education and ability are required. We seldom read of
& boatrace wherein ihe health of one or more of the participants
is not permanently impaired. Besides, the art of boxing, or, as
it is frequently called, the manly art of self-defense, is. taught
In the gymnasiums attached to almost every college or univer
senator mewan. sity in the land. If it is proper and desirable for young men to
understand the manly art of self-defense why should it De more objectionable for peo
ple to witness that game played by the Inchest expsrts than it is to witness the
various other games which are less usoful and more dangerous to the life and health
of the contestant. There is comparatively little danger of any injury to the spectators
who witness prize-fightine, ana whatever injury the combatants inflict v; on each
other is accepted by them as a resultof the proiession whicli they have chosen. There
is a wide difference between the moral and physical effects which may result from
Corbett and Fnziimmons beating each other and the permanent injury to fifteen or
twenty promising young students from the effects of one severely contested football
game.
The power of resistance to wrong and the ability to defend against dastardly as
sanlts is justly regarded by the learned institutions of the land as valuable education for
the youth, otherwise they would avo.d tbe expenditures of time and money which are
required 10 secure that kind of education- It increase? the physical vigor without tax
ing the physical powers of the young in a manner to produce permanent injury. The
accidents that happen in these contests are less in number ana less deplorable in
character than in any other physical sport which is practiced among civilized men.
There is another consideration which undoubtedly has its influence with the learned
professors to encourage education in boxing. It develops one of the mo*t useful in
stincts which nature has implanted in man. Howeyer much we may deplore war or
physical conflict of any kind we are forced to admit that people never acquired their
rights and no great civilization was ever maintained without the most vigorous use
of physical force. Physical force has been the great instrumentality in all aces to
break the chains of slavery and secure equal richts and justice for the masses. When
ever any nation has lost its power, offensive and defensive, it has relapsed into a con
dition of imbecility and tbe degradation which has excited the pity ani contempt of
man Kind. Why are the Japanese more robust and more highly appreciated than the
Chinese! Simply because the Japanese will fight and the Chinese will not. I would
not complain tof the unjust criticism of Nevada for authorizing an exhibition of tne
manly art of self-detense between the two great champions who are to contest for the
world's supremacy if they would treat the subject fairly and philosophically. They
should lay aside prejudice and discuss impartially the benefits and the objections to
exhibitions of physical strength and prowess in all tne popular games in'which the
people indulge, and not single out one game and one State upon which to pour out
their vials of hypocritical wrath. When the art of lighting becomes a lost art all
other arts of civilization will become extinct."
Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada said: "While I must not be under
stood as approving any foim of brutality, I will say that Ido not sympathize with
all of this hypocrisy that has beÂ«Â»n indulged in by a good manÂ» nÂ«nniÂ« Â«n,i _ . _Â«
tbe newspaper press, in criiicismi directed against the Legisla
ture and the Governor of Nevada for legalizing these glova con
tests. They ure nothing more than glove contests. Time wai
whea prize-lighters fought with bare knuckles, but now the*
use padded gloves. Ido not think that prize-fighting is murÂ«
brutal than some other forms of sport, as for instance, basebal
and football. Football - players are very often rough and
brutal on the field, and the participants in these games arc
often maimed and crippled for life, and sometimes deaths hare
resulted. I deny that on the whole more injury than good
results from these physical contests. They stimulate thÂ«
youth of the land to improve their physical condition. WÂ«
Americans pay more attention to tbe physical training and
development of our horses than we do to our men. I believe in
encouraging any form of sport that tends to improve the
physical condition of our men and women. There are prize
tights taking place between pugilists of lesser note every day in
the larger cities, and there is no great cry against the practice. 1 do not think the
State of Nevada can be justly condemned for her tolerance of these contests. Ihe
intense interest manifested in the sport, by not only men, but women as well, in all
grades of society, attests iis popularity. It is not nearly so dangerous as tbe football
of this country, the fox-chasing and cross-country riding in England, the fencing and
sword contest) in Germany, France and other countries, or the buil-ti-hting in Spain
and Mexico. I think that it is the manliest of all the sports."

to get to his feet in a few seconds, as the
crowd of trainers began pouring into the
ring. Fitz grabbed an American flag from
his belt and waved it high wheu Referee
Siler awarded him the fight. When Corbett
straightened up he seemed to at last realize that
he had lost the fight. Then he made a rush at
Fitzsimmons and grappled with him and
crowded him to the ropes. They vrestled for a
lew seconds, while a dozen tried to separate
them. The deputy marshals poured Into the
ring, and for a moment it looked as if there
was pi iÂ»;, r to be serious trouble; but Corbett
was finally dragged away and hurried to his
dressing-rooms, and Fitzsimmons was also
borne out, at the same time showered with
the congratulations of his admirers, while
Corbett had many followers and sympathizers.
The crowd soon dispersed af ter that.

EXPERTS TALK.
They All Agree That in
the Championship Bat
tle the "Best Man"
Won.
CARSON, Nev., idarch 17.â A number
of the sports left to-night by t."e specials
which pulled out as quickly as possible.
Those who remained were not unwilling
to discuss the battle and a few of the
expert opinions given to the special cor
respondents of the United Associated
Presses follows:
One of the most solemn looking men
about the ringside after the battle was
Walter Walson, boxing instructor of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco. Corbett
was Watson's star pupil and it cat the
veteran sorely when Jim dropped to the
flour a beaten man.
"It hardly seems possible," he sighed.
"Jim should have kept away from that
man until he did not have a punch left in
him. I am satisfied that Fitz can hit as
hard as Sullivan could in his palmy days.
Corbett evaded him beautifully up 10
the finish and had him pretty well dis
tressed with those aggravating jabs in the
face. One careless move lost him the
rL>ht. We saw the greatest contest in the
history of the game, though, and Bob
Fitz'immons deserves full credit for his
victory."
Al Smith was even more reticent than
usual wlmn ths battle was over. "Fitz
simmons is as game as a Debbie," he de
clared. "No man with a weak heart could
stand the punishment Jim dealt out in
those opening rounds. It was a great bat
tle and the winner is the greatest man in
his line we have ever looked at."
John L. Sullivan seemed disgusted with
what h<Â» called Corbett's "iove taps." He
deplored the absence of old-time slogging
and appeared to think that the fighters
wasted many good opportunities to get in
their execution.
Jack McAuliffe was more generous in
his opinion: "We will never see two
heavy- weigh ts of like caliber in the ring
together again, unless the principals ot
to-day arrange another meeting. I think
Corbett would be foolish to go against
Fitz a second time, fie lacks the stamina,
and Bob would make short work of h:m if
they ever got together again. Jim put up
a marvelous tight though, and Fitz hadn't
any too much margin to throw away."
Billy Madden bad a few pools on Fitz in
bis pocket. He picked the winner before
the fight and stock to him all through the
gory rounds when Fitz seemed to be on
tlie toboggan.
Louis Houseman danced a hornpipe
when the fatal ten seconds expired. He
backed Fitz straight and in combinations,
and won a respectable sum on the result.
George Siler earned bis fee without any
exertion. "They gave me very little to
do," he remarked. "I only parted them
once, and then it was hardly necessary.
They broke as prettily as any two men I
ever saw, and there was not even a sem
blance of foul fighting on either side. The
winning blow was a fair nnder-arm punch
just below and slightly to the right of the
heart. It was delivered at short range
with * stiff forearm and great strength.
The tap which Fitz caught Jim on the
jaw as Corbett toppled over did no dam
age. Bob could not have restrained him
self had he tried. It was a game contest
and I enjoyed it as much as anybody."
Arthur Moore, the well-known New
York Athletlo Club man who always acts
as referee of his club's contest?, said:
"Fitz is a marvel. Corbett had him
smothered, but hÂ«d no steam to linish the
work. Fitz's recuperative powers and
gameness are simply wonderful. It was a
great fight."
Tom Sharkey appreciated Corbett's pie
dicament thoroughly, having had a taste
of it himself. "That was the blow Fiiz
simmous tried to land on me," declared
Tom. "I came in too far and it caught
me just below the bslt. It was a corker,
and no man could light after receiving it.
Corbett can't hit a lick on earth, and it is
only a question of using him up before
putting him out. I want another crack at
Fitz. He can't wear me down as easy as
he did Corbett."
William Muldoon didn't say much. He
left the impression, however, that it was
his belief that the "best man" won.
Charley White, Jack McVey, Billy
Woods and Jim Jeffries were all despon
dent. They could see nobody but Corbett
in the fight, snd all of them felt the defeat
keenly. White seemed to think that Cor
bett erred in not keeping away until Fitz
was incapable of landing a hard blow.
The others did not know what to say.
Ernest Roeber's face was as broad as a
Carson pancake as ho trotted ahead of the
winner into the dressina-roem. "What
did I tell you?" he asked. "Corbett ran
against a puncher tnis time and a man
who could take punishment, too. He
fought well, though, and Fitz had to let
out a few links to get there."
Hickey and Stelzner modestly kept out
of sight. They were naturally delighted
at the victory, but had no theories to ex
ploit.
Dan Stuart wore a contented look as he
sunned himself behind the kinetoscope
shed. "Don't ask me how many people
were here," he pleaded. "I couldn't even
give you a respectable guess. I'm going
to take a long rest now. I've spent a
good many dollars to bring these men to
gether and I'm glad they settled their lit
tle dispute without a rumpus. The
kinetoscope pictures are perfect, I under
stand. We took three different sets with
as many machines.
"The negatives were boxed up after the
last round in three separate rolls. We
will express them to New York by differ
ent routes and insure tnem for their full
value. I will leave Carson in a few days
for Los Angeles. After a short stay there
I intend visiting Coronado Bench. From
there I will head for Texas, winding up
my journey at St. Augustine before the
end of the winter season there. A load of
worry has been lifted from my shoulders,
and you can bet that I am satisfied now
that it is all over."
Governor Sadler took in the big fight,
and cut his dinner short in order to get
back in time for the little fellows. "It's
the greatest sport on earth," vouchsafed
his Excellency. ''We made no mistake
in giving those fellows a license. I have
seen all the fighters to-night, and none
of them are hurt. Thac little fellow,
Flaherty, who got such a hard knock,
hasn't a bruise on him. Corbett don't
look as though he had been in a tight, and
the other men are all rient. They can
poke all the fun they like at Nevada. We
made no mistake, I tell you, and I have
yet to meet the man who thinks we did."
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 17.â Torn Allen,
ex-champion, said to-night: "I was a
strong Corbott man ana bet on him. The
fi.--lit was a great surprise to me, It is
evident that vitality won over science.
Fitzsimmons is a lucky fighter. His con
test with Hall was a nuke, and I think
that should Corbett enter the ring again
with I 1 itzsimmons, the ex-champion would
win,"
Great Interest in Chicago.
CHICAGO. 111., March 17 â Every man,
woman and child who knew that a cham
pionship tight was in progress in Carson
City, among the thousands who crowded
the downtown streets of Chicago, seemed
to be as eager to know the result and the
details as if the event was a Presidential
election. The people of Irish birth and
parentage who always make a holiday of
St. Patrick's day were out in full force
and augmented the crowds at various
points. Battery T> armory and the Cyclo
rama building, opposite, were rilled with
sports and business men, who received
the news by rounds, athletic programmes
being provided to fill in the time and
make an entertainment. Several thou
sand more men and women were at Tat
tersall's to hear the exciting telegrams
read while female cyclists contested for
professional prizes in a six-day race.
"Pompadour Jim" was the favorite at
all these places and among the thousands
who blocked the streets opposite news
paper offices and saloon resons The
peoDle who stood in the mud at the
Tribune-Inter Ocean corner had only been
informed by bulletins of the eleventh
round and were waitincrfor something de
cisive when a party of men who had tieon
at the offices of the United Associated
Presses for the news from Carson wedged
through and told of Fitzsimmons' vic
tory. The crowd would not believe it,
but were reassured a few minutes after by
the posting of tne result. In spite of Jim
having a host of friends the remark was
generally passed that they were glad that
Fitzsimmons had won fame and fortune.
There was a mad rush of business men
everywhere to get the extra newspapers
telling how it was don c.
Gets Many Challenges.
CARSON, Nev.. March 17.â Robert Fitz
simmons, champion heavy-weight and
middle-weight of the world, is already
flooded with challenges. Although the
long-leeged man has held the first-named
title but a few hours he has many of the
invitations to battle before him, but Is not
considering them to-night. Already John
L. Suliivan. Peter Maher, Tom Sharkey
and Joe Goddard have in their bids and
by to-morrow Fitzsimmona expects to
hear from Peter Jackson and maybe one
or two others. It is not believed any
middle- weight will challenge Fitzsimmons
for some time, his wore to-day demon
strating what he can do with heavy
weights, and of course middle-weights
will be of a secondary consideration if
indeed he meets any of them. Jfl z?im
mons said to-ni_-ht that he had no plans
for the immediate future, and remarked
that it was too early to talk about it.
Dempsey's Widow Wins.
PORTLAND, Or.. March 17. â The
heaviest winner in Portland on the Fiiz
simmons-Corbett fight is Jack Demsey's
widow. Shortly before the Nonpariel died
ho told his wife that Fitz could whip nny
fighter on earth if given the opportunity,
and acting on this Mrs. Dempsey wagered
her all on the ti;rht, and this amounted to
several thousand dollars. She also tried
to wager her piano with another woman
on the result, but it iell through.

False Swings Cause the Ex-Champion
to Grow Over-Confident and
Careless.
CARSON, Kbv., March 17.â With one
punch â and a punch it was in every sense
of the word â Bob Fitz>inimons won the
championship of world to-day just as
the time dial pointed to 1 o'clock.
The greatest fistic battle of the age has
been fought. Never before in modern
times was such a contest ever witnessed,
and I doubt seriously if we see another
like it. It was essentially a strife between
skill and brute strength and courage.
It was a trial in which the tighter, as
he is known pure and simple, triumphed
over the finished and shadowy boxer, who
knew every trick and turn in the game.
It was a fight that could not last.
During round after round the man with
the animal instincts led the assault only
to find that he was striking at empty air,
and in return for his efforts was being
treated to tantalizing jabs on the nose,
poked In the ribs and made to bleed and
groan.
For a dozen rounds the gladiator who
hails from Hayes Valley made his red
haired and shiny-pated opponent look
like a plaything, so easy was it for him to
rap him when he felt so inclined, and it
was money to marbles until the climax was
reached that he would win in a canter.
Corbett, alter a few rounds' experience
with the cunning Cornishman, reached
the conclusion that he was not going to
have much trouble in punching out a vic
tory. He found that he could reach his
adversary almost when he chose to and
was scarcely idle a second.
He fought a faster battle than he should.
Jim has always made bis best showing*
when he took matters coolly in the rinc,
retorted to extreme care and graduail/
cut his opponent to ribbons.
But in Fitzsimmons the Californian
found a man who winced not under the
tattoo that was being beaten on his coun
tenance and ribs â a man who kept com
ing back for more and grinning distortedly
over it through a mask of gore.
Fitz went into this fight with bnt one
object in view, and that was to be patient
until the proper time arrived for him to
send home such a blow as has dropped
many another good man to the resined
floor.
He was patient all through the beating
he received and then took his reward. It
is my honest belief that Fitz deliberately
caused nis swings and drives to miss his
adversary in order to cauÂ«e him to get
over-confident and careless. This is just
what happened.
But there is another end to the story.
Fitz was materially weakened at times
during those rounds in which he receive. l
the worst pummeling, but after tha
minute of rest allowed between rounds,
would come back as strong as ever.
This was not so with Corbett. H* ex
hibited no recuperative powsrs at all, such
as one would have a right to expect in a
man holding the world's championship.
His was a slow but gradual decline. He
really woro himself out thumping a man
he codld not hurt, but without knowing
it or believing it, he did not expect tha
end when it came.
Fitz, however, saw what was coming
and braced himself for the last grand ef
fort. Corbett did not have enough steam
left in him t j stay the tide and having his
guard beaten down left the opening his
wily adversary wanted and was dropped
like an ox. It is not a long story, but it
will never be forgotten by those who saw
it enacted.

day could not hare been thought of for
an affair of this kind. A clear blue sky
and a bright and warm sun, with not a
breath of air floating in irom the snow
clad mountains overlooking the scene of
the battle, rendered the arena as com
fortable a spot as could be found on earth.
It was a veritable summer day, and it
made glad the hearts of the kinetoscope
concessionaires, for it means thousands
upon thousands of dollars to them. The
announcement that the fight would take
place between 10 o'clock and noon had
Carson early astir, and long before the
first-named hour hundreds were trooping
toward the arena.
The arrival of another big special train
this morning swelled the throng of vis
itors to quite a material degree. The
scene in the vast amphitheater, dur.ng
the gathering of the ring-goers was a
treat. It was a good-natured crowd and
j atient.
Although they were compelled to sit on
those hard seats for over two hours before
the great event came off, they were abid-

ing and indulgent in no evidence of im
patience.
A good deal of this time was taken up
:n looking about and pointing out the
noted sports in attendance, and in this
regard it goes witbout saying that John
L. Sullivan was the most -gazed -upon
notable there.
Bat Masterson was one of the characters
at the ringside. He came there in solemn
clothing and with all kinds of money to
bet on Corbett. Bat, like others who are
now here, is a stranger in these hills, but
â¢when he entered the arena to-day there
arose a sheer from the people who were
Bitting on the benches which could have
been heard in quaint old Chinatown.
Twenty mmutes later Billy Madden,
who stood at the shoulder of John L. Sul
livan for many months, passed through
the gate. He twisted his black mm
tacde, saluted to many men whom ne
knew and squared nimself on hia seat.
The world-famous "has been," John L.
Bullivan. puffing and grunting, was the
next arrival.
He bellowed at the doorkeeper, stretched
the great collar around his neck and
tipped his silk hat to somebody wr:om he
thought he knew. The great ex-warrior
of the ring was a majestic fellow, gray and
hsppy ns he wa?.
His big shoulders covered the boari
behind him for three feet or more and
every time he spoke his voice sounded
like the chieftain of a good old-time
menagerie and this means the lion.
'"Parson" Davies, clean shaved and. as
usual, with his thumb at his nose at every
suggestion of a stranger, was another
man who watched the fighters from the
benches. He sat on a piece of timber near
Fitzsimmons' corner, and vis face, drawn
and white as a gravestone, was quite as
expressionless.
Beside lsim was "Cow Horn" Harry
Sampson of Bodie, who is a man with
whiskers streaked with gray. Sixteen
years ago men from Bodie were looked
upon as fellows who fought at the drop of
the hat.
But old "Cow Horn" was passive to
day, and he desired to have it understood
that the men from Bodie, who were sit
ting on either side of him, were "on the
level" and that their guns had been left
at home.
PeÂ«ping between the shoulders of two
San Francisco men who wore white
swea'ers and had flowers in the lappels of
their coats, was the time-honored Al
Bmith, the man who has seen every great
prizefight *ince the days of Figg.
Smitu yawned and stretched his wiry
shoulders as he sat on the white board
and declared to a man behind him that
he bad been to many fights but that in
the future hÂ« preferred to have them at
home.
Away off in one corner, but still near
ths ropes, was Jimmy Wakeley. His
necktie was wrapped like a pancake about
the bosom of his shirt, and he glared
rather than stared at what was eoing on
In the ring. He had nothing to say.
Sitting behind him, with an eye as blue
as the sky, was ''Sensitive" Bill Williams
of Bishop Creek. Bill wore a flannel
shirt and a cap made of the skin of the
erizzly bear.
When a boy who was peddling souvenirs
of the battle rubbed against the "sensi
tive" man, Bill aroused everybody by de
claring that the world was his. Seven
men from all parts of the country in
stantly arose from their seats and grasped
the hand of Bill and congratulated him.
Assemblyman Garrard, toe only Damo
crat of the Nevada Legislature, and the
man who introduced the bill which made
piize fighting possible in this State, poked
his gray whiskers over the shoulder of
"Sensitive" William and said he was glad
that he had got the world.
Only a few feet away sat Wyatt iSarp,
steely eyed ana calm. Like Bat Master
eon, Wyatt nas some things to tell after
be is dead.
Bill Langdon of San Francisco, but for
merly of Cnicago, was resting on a bench
bessind Earp and stared meekly at tlis
ring; then he remove 1 hiÂ« necktie, which
is something unusual lor the man of
White-maple Bar.
""What do yon think about
Bill, poking Mayor Yerington
ji a the r.bs. "Whttdol think?" replied
j the Mayor. "Why, it is a whole fight.
|It is a run for anybody's money." Bill
was satisried and dropped back stiffly into
his seat,
rie thrust his face between the shoulders
of two men from Montana and watched
the ring where the "battle of the century"
was about to be fought.
Over on the southern side of the ring
and close to Corbetfs corner sat a notable
gathering of San Franciscans.
Police Commissioner Mose Gunst had a
i front seat on the side and had a wad of
J greenbacks, which he offered to bet with
anybody that Uorbett would win in a
cnnter.
He managed to pick up a couple of
wagers during the mill, his best chance,
as he took it, being when Barney Coleman
jumped up during tie fifth round and
said that he would bet $500 even on the
Cornishman's chances.
Mose snapped at the money. He and
Barney know each and consequently* it
was not necessary that either or boili
should p;oduce reiidy cash then and there. ]
They simply nodded to each other and
said "It's a go."
A Jittle later Fitzsimmona' prospects
seemed to bÂ» on the wane, and Mose,
turning to his old friend Barney, asked
with a triumphant grin if he had any
more money in his clothes.
â¢'l've got $300," replied Coieman. '-What
are your figures?" "I'll put $500
against it." replied Gunst. "You're
on again," said Coleruan. "If Jim
loses this fight," said Gunst, turning
to Ed Purser, who sat beside him in the
front box, "I stand to Jose a cool nine
thousand.' 1 "Oh, your money is safe,"
9aid Purser, "Jim will win in a jog."
About twenty feet away was another
box, which was occupied by State Senator
Percy Henderson and Assemblyman Sig
Bettman of California, Jesse Marks and
the original old "Blinker" Murphy.
These three notables wore black fur
caps, sweaters and arctic overcoats, and
had little blue glasses in their pockets in
anticipation of a snowstorm.
Assemblyman Leon Dennery, who sat
close to them, said he missed the snow,
but after the fight was over he remarked
thai he cjuld distinguish a pronounced
frost in the neighborhood of the Hender
son box.
"Pop" Sullivan, who would rather lose
a leg than miss a prize-fight, beamed
through his windows over the right shoul
der ol the astute SigEettman.

right swing which caught Corbett jmt above
the left ear and the Californian clinched.
They steppel back on the word from the ref
eree and then Jim put a heavy left on the jaw,
to which Bob made no return. A right ou the
body, a stifl lelt jab flush on the face made the
claret flow freely from Fliziimmons' nose and
mouth and he appeared a little rattled. Jim

point of attack, and as the bell rang he upper

with a right and left swing lor the jaw, which
were both chort. The Australian seemed to
crow vicious at his failure, and he rusned at
Jim and hugged him hard, attempting to
wrestle him against the ropes. Referee Siler
quickly noticed the roughing and cautioned
Fitzsimmons. The caution seemed to have
the desired effect in the clinches which fol
lowed. Bob was much more careful. Corbett
landed a right ou the face and Bob came back
with his right on the body lightly but missed

right on the side of ihe head. On tne breaka

Jim rushed at once and planted right and ieft

Round â Fitzsfmmons came up looking
fresh and stood his ground. Corbett, how
ever, was the first to lead with a left on the
jaw and a right on the body. Fitzsimmons
stopped a hard right lead for the body, but
was wild with his right an.l left and Â« or!>ett

also light. Bob swung his right hard for the

with his r.ght swings and a couple of clinches
followed. ':' Corbett cleverly evaded a left for
the head and then sent his own left for the
body twice. Fitzsimmons drove his left hard
above the heart, but Corbett drew back In
time to avoid the full force of the blow. Jim
lauded a hard left punch on the side of the
jaw and Fitz-ummons commenced to bleed
again. Fitzummons ran into another left on
the jaw immediately afterward. They sparred
at long range for a time and both were very
cautious A light left on the face from Cor
bett was followed Dy two left jabs which
lauded on Bob's nose. The latter swung right
and left wildly and caught Jim's. left on the
nose. Again Fitzsimmons swung, but Corbett
ducked and shot his lelt past Bob's guard full
in the face. Jest as the gong sounded Corbett
jabbed a stiff left on the damaged nose and
Fitzsimmons was quickly covered with blood.
However, the Australian seemed â  to be getting

lot of leading but jailed to land. ; Jim put left
on ihe face, and stepped back from two vicious
leads. Fitzsimmous .would not .be denied,
however, and he I came again with a pile-driv
ing right on the body. As the round ended
Corbott caught a slight lett on the mouth.
Fitzsimmons was very strong, but was breath
ing bard as he sat in his chair. Corbett whs
not showing the cleverness his ardent admir
ers expected of him. : : .. ' â¢ ; .1, Â â .:. '
Round 10â Bob led off with a left swing,
which Corbett avoided, but the 'Australian
came back at him and in the clinch put a bard
â¢ left jolt on the jaw. Both swung wildly and
came together in a clinch. Corbett blocked
Bob's left, but could not stop a stiff right that
landed over the kidneys or a V hard left that
found jaw. -Bob's left landed' on the body
and he pushed his right contemptuously â  in
Corbett'S face. Jim faked . a left . lead, but
could not draw the wily: Cornishman out.
Jim saw this quickly and he adopted different
tactics. " He sent his right , with lightning
speed on the wind, his left on the body and
face and came buck again with a right on the
body and a light left ou the face. Fitzsim
mons did not like this treatment and he took
a hand in the attack himself. He put three
hard lefts in succession on Jim's head and
swung, a, right over the par that Jim
tried to avoid, but failed. - Jim's leit reached
the face and with his right s.-nt a vicious up
percut â ! to the Cornishman's chin. Jim poked
his left in the luce again, but took a. <â  tiff left
hander on the jaw in return, and this was fol
lowed by two strong letts on tho short ribs.
Jim put his left on the body and came into a
clinch. As they broke' away Filzsimmons
hooked him with aright under the ear, but
Jim -retaliated with a right and left on the
jaw. Fitzsimmons appeared:. very,: confident
and strong as he went to bis corner. Corbett
did not seem to be weak, but nis face had a
grayish pallor and his eyes shitted nervously
as he eat in his chair. He had lost the confi
dent smile with which he opened the battle.
Round 11â Bob rushed, but his left lead for
the jaw was stopped. , Jim shot two listh.t lefts
on tne jaw. ;Corb2U's right 1 iheu found the
wind, and he ducked a ' hard leit Jrom'Fftz
simmens. The Australian's left caught Jim 1
hunt on the jaw twica- before, they clinched.
Jim's right went: to the body and then he shot
his left twice under the cur. F.tzsimjnons put
alight left on the fide of the head, and Jim's
counter on the nose was very. weak. Fitzsim
mons forced matters with anardright swing
on the body Â»nd a.right* on the side of the
, head, and - got ? away without ; a return, -f. Cor-*
bett's light left landed high up oat the iorc- ;
head and they clinched. Fitzsimmons tried
har.i for a Kuo'ckout on 'he breakaway, but
Corbett clever. y avoided the danger. Clinches
were frequent and Corbett bagan to appear
tired. His blows seemed to lack steam, while
Fitzsimmons, though not landing quite so
ofteu, had a sood deal more foreÂ« behind his
Klove. Alight lelt on the jaw from Jim was
heavily countered by Fnzsiinmons, and hid
right was landed on Corbett's chin. Twice In
succession Fitzsimmons swung his right on
Jim's jaw and rushed him all over the ring.
Corbett clinched and Fitzsimmons uppercut
him hard. The Cornishman kept up the at
tack and landed Uvo left jolts on Jim's chin.
Fitzsimmon-*' adherents were wild witn, ex
citement as their man rushed in with a bard
left on the jaw, a right on the body and an
other left on the side of the jaw. Corbatt
clinched desperately, and time was called be
fore Fitzsiramons could do any further dam
age. The bell was a welcome relief to the
lalfornian.
Ruuud 12â Fitzsimmons came fast from his
chair and swung right and lef:, but missed.
He ducked Corbett's return. Both were cau
tious and spurred at long range until Fitz
simmons came in with a hard right on the
side of Jim's head, pushing it back. Fitzslm
mons missed two lelt leads and tnen shoved
his glove in Corbett's face, but a dangerous
right was well blocked by the forearm. Jim
put a light lelt on the face mid they clinched.
After the brenkawny Jim's left found the body
and they came together again. On the bresk-
Bwny Jim shot his left on the iaw, Fitzsim
nions countering with the right on the neck.
Jim's right and left landed on the jaw, but
appeared to lack force. Fitzsimmons was
wild witn right and left and Jim fought him
to his own corner, sending in two h^ayy body
blows and a left on the face. Fitzsiramons
c. inched and they broke clean. Coruettshot
four lefts in quick succession without return,
but Fitziimmuiis piled iuio the attack with a
heavy right on tne head and uppercut Jim as
he clinched. After the breskuwHy Fitzum
inons nut a heavy left on the body that came
near doubling Jim up. Corbett put a hfton
the face and received a right countering jolt
on the jaw. Jim put nis left on the bony aud
then snot it into Fitz's face. Both missed
vicious swings. Fitz was bleeding freely when
tbe bell sounded.
Round 13â Fiiziimmons got to work with a
right ou tne wind, and shot his left for the
face, catching Corbetr flush on the mouth and
loosening one of his gold-filled teeth. Vicious
infighting followed, both men exchanging
hard leits ou ihe body. Fitzsimmons punched
nis mail stiffly with his right twice on the
body, but Jim nearly evened up with three
lefts on head aud body. FitzMmmonÃ rushed,
but missed, and a clinch followed, in which
Corbett uppercut the Australian with a right.
Iv the sparring that followed Corbett took
occasion to spit out the loosened tooth. Jim
tried his right for the jaw In a clinch, but
Fitzsimmons kept his snoulder well in the
way. Fitzsimmuns led wildly and Corbett
aucked, sending a stiff punch to Bob's nose.
Jim iv turu missed and took a hard right ou
the short ribs, which drove him back a foot.
Corbett sent his man back with a lef t jolt on
the chin, a:id followed up with a heavy left
punch on the body, Fitzsimmons countering
with a right uppercut. Jim poked his left on
iho nose, which bled again ireely, but the flow
seemed to do the Australian no harm, i or
bett was standing the battle fairly well, but
his color was not as fresh as the Cornlshman's.
It was easy to see that Jim was tired.
Round 14â Jim missed the opening lead
with his right, but on the next attempt put a
light left on the jaw, Fitzsimmons countering
stiffly with a right on the side of 'the head.
The Australian sent iv a right and left on the
jnw, which jarred Jim, and then piled in a
left uppercut, and as Jim turned around to
skip out of reach Fitzsimmons pasted him on
the back ot the heao. Fitz seemed to have
more power than ever behind his blows. Jim
hooked his left on the jaw, but Fitzsimmons
retaliated with a heavy right on the same spot
and they clinched. They broke clean. Fitz
j-iiniuon.s inude it fake lead with his right aud
the bow was oi the dinkiest order. Instead
of keeping his body rigid and throwing his
head back, as was hiÂ« usual custom in allow
ing blows of this kind to slip by his face, Cor
bett, underestimating his opponent's cun
uing, contemptuously threw back his head aud
Chest, thus throwing his stomach forward.
'Ihe Australian's small eyes twinkled and with
panther-like speed he drew back his left with
the forearm rigid and ripped it ud Into the
pitot Jim's stomach a little under the heart.
Corbett was lilted Ã¼bout a foot off me ground,
and as he pitched forward Fiizsimmons put
his right on the jaw aud Corbett came down
heavily on his knees. He remained down for
fifteen seconds and Fitzsimmous retired to his
corner.
CORBETT DAZED.
Poor Jim Tries to Fight
On After Fitz's Fists
Cause His Star
to Descend.
CARSON, Nev., March 17.â When Siler
counted out the fatal seconds and reached
tne last count he threw up boih his hands
smd left tue ring. A scene of indescriba
ble confusion followsd. Cries of "foul"
were repeated throujthout the arena and
the crowd clamberad through the ropes.
Of course, there was no foul, as Corbett
was knocuea out fairly, and no notice was
taken of the clamor. When Jim rose to
his fe?t with difficulty he seemed about
to fail prone on his lace again. But he ;
steadied himself with a desperate effort,
and Charley White and McVey came on
either side of him, threw his dressing
gown over his shoulders and supported
him until he recovered somewhat.
When he got his senses b:\ck partially,
he worked himself into a state of hysteri
cal mania. He broke away from his sec
onds and rushed at Fiizsimmons, who
was standing at the side of the ring op
posite his own corner. When Fitzsim
mons saw the half-demented pugi
list coining at him be dropped
both his hands by his side &:\a
stood upright. Corbett swung at him
wildly and Fitzsimmons, without raising
his hands, ducked the blows and Corbett
clinched him, striking with his right hand
back of the ear as he did so. The blow
was not hard, as the unfortunate Cali
fornian was very weak. Fitzsimmons
took no notice of it and Billy Brady and
others of Corbett's second* dragged him
away from Fitzsimmons. He was pacified
and taken to his dresaing-rooni shortly af
terward.
Fitzsimmons started a dance of victory
when he saw his opponent down. He
waved a little flag above his head and
stepped lightly down the ladder and into
the arms of his wife, who sat awaiting
him in a box right behind bis chair.
Mrs. Fitzsimmons kissed her husband's
face, not noticing the blood which was
trickling from his noae and mouth. Mar
tin Julian headed the procession to the
dressing-room, followed br Fitzsimmons
with Mrs. Fitzsimmons at his side, and
the crowd cheexed the victor heartily.
LITTLE MEN
FIGHT WELL
Dal Hawkins Easily
Whips Martin Fla
herty and George
Green Bests Billy
Smith.
CARSON, Nkv., March 17.â Most of the
spectators who witnessed the fight found
their way back to the arena in time to Bee
the little fellows in action.
Martin Flaherty of Lowell Mass., and
Dal Hawkins of San Francisco were the
first pair to face Referee Maiachy Hogan
ol Chicago. "Spider" Kelly and Jim Neal
were behind Hawkins, and Bob Kane and
Harry Baker took care of Flaherty.
Hawkins went for the New Engiander
from the tap of the ball. He made two
ineffectual swings at Flaherty's jaw be
fore he gauged the distance. On His third
attempt he landed tlusii on the point of
Martin's chin, and the man from Lowell
dropped like a Nevada steer bit with
an ax. He lay on his back while Hogan
counted him out, and bad to be helped to
his corner. The actual time consumed in
fighting was forty seconds, and the knock
out was one of the prettiest and most com
plete on record.
"Mysterious" Billy Smith of Boston
and George Green (Young Corbett) of San
Francisco wound up tbe carnival. Smith's
seconds were Harry Baker and Jack Fay.
Bob McArtlnir and Eddie Greany attended
to Green. The San Franciscan outpointed
and outpunched Smith and bad him done
to a turn at the end of the twelfth round,
when the Bostonian gave it up. Smith
claimed that his left arm, which was
Iractured recently, bad gone back on him,
but most people think be was prostrated
with heart failure. Green hammeied
away on his opponent's body until Smith
carried a scarlet circle around tbe heart.
The first two rounds wertf fast and furi
ous. Smith rashei Green and thumped
him over the kidneys as they came to
gether. He repeatedly tried to hook
Green with his right in tbe breakaway,
but invariably over-reached and did no
damage. Green made an even break of
tbe second, third and fourth rounds, and
he had Smith toned down considerably in
the fifth. From that on tbe fight was
Green's. He never let up a minute,
varying his left drives for the heart with
an occasional swing on the jaw. At the
conclusion of tbe twelfth round the
sponge went up from Smith's corner. His
seconds claimed that he could no longer
use his left and stood no chance to win
with one hand.
The betting was 100 to 90 on the Fiah
ertv-Hawkins bout, with the Eastern man
favorite, and 100 to 80 on Green and Smith,
with the talifornian at the big end.
Fitz Is All Right.
CARSON, Nev, March 17.â Af er Filz-
simmons had dined and celebrated his
victory with his family he drove into
town with Martin Julian and visited the
headquarter* of thÂ« United A-sociated
Presses. The champiou was as smy as a
kitten in his movements. His demeanor
was as quiet as usual, but he had little to
say. He illustrated the knockout blow as
described by the special correspondent of
the United Associated Prtstes. Bob was
highly incensed wuen he heard that the
Chicago Associated Press had sent out a
story to the effect that he had a hemorrh
age after the battle and was dangerously
ill.
"I'm here, am I not?" he asked. "Do I
look a3 if 1 was dangeously ill? O:
course," he concluded, "you will contra
dict this rot."
VERY PHILOSOPHICAL.
The Feminine Part of the Corbett
Family Soon Recover From
the Shock.
The feminine part of the Corbett family
has taken Jim's defeat philosophically,
but cot without a first pang of keen disap
pointment.
On their own account, they early became
reconciled to tne result and cherished
thoughts only of what a humiliating
experience it would be considered by the
one principally concerned.
The mother and the sisters of the van
quished gladiator had remained at the
paternal home on Hayes street; the wife
had lingered in her apartments at the
Hotel St. Nicholas, several blocks away.
Such was their relative positions yester
day evening after they had learned and
together discussed the fail of their nero.
"It was a great shock to us," said the
sister Corbett as, with becoming bonnet
and street attire still on, she stood with
the mother Corbett in the upstairs hall
way of their home. She had just come in
from the hotel, whicii sne nad left after
assuring Herself that Jim's wife was no
ionger distressing herself over the un
avoidable defeat of her husband.
The mother Corbett, matronly and
portly, but withal comparatively youthful
considering the age of her sons, gave tDe
impression of one who had not worried
much during a lifetime, of one not keenly
sensitive to annoyances and care.
"Poor Jim!' continued the sister.
"This will be hard for him to bear; he is
so proud."
"Yes," interposed the mother; "he
never thought that he could be beaten,
and we didn't, either. He was doing all
the fighting right along, and had the best
of it, according to the reports, But every
one, I guess, has to lose some lime. Na
poleon had his Waterloo and Jim had his
Fitz. It was one of those tricky punches
that did it. You know lie struck the boy
rit;ht on the heart, and they say that he
hitÃ a terrible blow and makes believe a
good many thincs while he is waiting
round to get in one of those punches."
"But Jim needn't be ashamed," spoke
up the sister. "He put up a good fight
and did clever work. He must have
thought that he had things his way, and
perhaps gave hia man too mucn of a
chance. Any way, Jim has made a whole
lot of money out of prizefighting, more
than any onoelse, I guess."
"How do you know that he has made a
lot of money?" objected the mother.
"We are not talking about that."
"I know that he has fought for some of
the biggest purses ever offered," answered
the sister. "I just received a telegram
from Carson," said Miss Corbett, chang
ing the subject and filling about into the
mysteries of a woman's pocket. "I guess
they forget about U3 at first during the ex
citement and then sent ths. It says:
'Don't worry. L^ave here to-night.'
"I'm pretty sure Jim's wife wilt not see
any one to-night. No; she is not prcs
trated. She said that Jim is still her hus
band end is just as much to her victorious
or defeated. 6he supposed that defeat
must come sometime, and she is not go
ing to take on about it."
And Mrs. Juinea J. Corbett would not
be soen b?cause by the conventional and
expected answer she was "indisposed."

STAY-AT-HOMES
What They Thought of
the Fight at Car
son.
Some Lost Eets and Some
Won and Are Very
Jubilant.
Corbett'.* Ccniiiion Seemed to Be
Thought Responsible lor His
D.f:at.
Opinions on the result of the tight were
numerous and varied. Some of the most
I characteristic arc appended:
Judge Campbellâ l am not sun rised et
the result, for since I saw Fitzs:niinon3
and Sharkey tight and Corbett and fc-har
key, my judgment has b<*en that Corbett
was lacking in vitality. I hardly thought
it possible ti at Corbett could recuperate
and pain both strength and vitality in the
limited time since he fou..ht Sharkey. I
was satisfied from t lie way Fiizsimmons
handled Sharkev that he was a very pow
erful man, and I always believed that Pits
had Sharkey under control after the sec
ond jound of the fight. On the other
hand, 1 did not believe that Corbett could
have lasted another round with Sharkey.
George T. Maxwell, secretary of ttie Fire
Department â My opinion is that the bet
ter man (yon the fight from what I haVJ
been able to judge from tne papers. Cor
bet: is evidently on the decline ana has
never recovered his recuperative powers.
Scientifically, he is the cleverer znan of
the two.
Fire Marshal Toweâ l thought Corbett
would win and personally I wish he had,
as I have known him ana bis parents for
a long time, and besides it would have been
to the honor of his native city. He ap
parently trained well for the fi^ht, and I
can't understand why Fitzsinimona
knocked him out so quickly.
Police Surgeon "Weil â It seems to have
been a square fight and in my opinion the
better man won.
Police Lieutenant Bird-all- I always
thought Fitziimmons would win. He has
wonderful driving power, and I knew that
if tie could get a c ha. ice he would finish
Corbett.
Detective Bainbridge â Fitzsimmons is a
remarkable man and no one knows him
thoroughly till he gets into the ring. He
has wonderful reserve lorces, which ho
uses to advantage. He will playing at
being almost Knocked out so that he C3n
get the chance he is waiting for and he
can stand any amount of punishment
waiting for that chance.
Police Serjeant C. P. Wright â I thought
all the time Fitzsimmons wcuid win.
Fitzsimmons is a fighter and Corbett is a
boxer, that's the distinction I draw be
tween the two men.
Charles E. Corryâ l saw Corbett go
against Sharkey and made up my mind
that Jim couldn't get Into condition to go
the route with Fi.z. I had no idea that it
would be easy, but after considering the
whole matter gave my preference to Bob.
Thomas C. Maher â I expected to see it
come the other way. I believe that tieht
ers going on the stage knocks them out of
their regular business and disqualifies
them. It is the old question of keeping
in condition. Sullivan only trained for
one big fight. After that ho relied on his
former qualifications. Coibett made a

This is the official brand of "liar," ex
pressed in the diplomatic language ol
statesmen, that will be burned in the hide
of the monarch of a thousand and one
lakes to-morrow; this will be the gist ol
- the report made to the Senate by its com
mittee appointed to investigate the vile
and slanderous article headed, "Bribery
" in Aid of Thievery," which appeared in
the Examiner on February 27, in connec
tion with Assembly bil! 273. amending the
law relating to change of venue. The
main features of the committee's report
are as follows:
Your committee, appointed by resolution of
the Senate, passed on the Ist day of March,
1897, to make a full and complete investiga
tion a^s to the truth of tne charges and state
ments contained in that certain article pub
lished in the Examiner on the 27th day ol
February, 1897, and which article n headed
"Bribery in Aid oi Thievery," beg leave to re
port as follows:
Tnat your committee has held eleven meet
ings; that at its first meeting A. M. Lawrence,
mauagiug editor ot the Examiner; L. L. Lev
inps, a reporter lor said paper, on duty at tne
State Capitol; and also Al Murphy, Franklin
Hichborn, <'.. H. Jes,Â«en and I. Alexander, also
reporters of said paper, on duty at the State
i'apitol, were suopenaed and called as wit
nesses, your committee deeming it a proper
method 01 procedure to begin with those
whom they believed to be responsible for
the statements and charges published as afore
said.
.That from the examination of these wit
nesses no information was elicited that tnrew
any light upon the statements and charges
mentiouea except to the effect that they had
been made on hearsay. Three of the wit
nesses â A. M. Lawrence, L. L. Leviags and Al
Murphyâ declining to answer certain ques
tions propounded to them by the committee,
were brought before the bar of the Senate and
committed for contemi-t, and have not yet
purged themselves of contempt nor endeav
ored to do so. The proceedings regarding the
contempt proceedings already fuliy appear
upon the journals of the Senate.
Tne managers of the Western Union Tele
graph Company and of the Pacific Postal Tele
graph Company appeared before your com
mittee in obedience to subpenas requiring
them to produce all telegrams passing be
tween certain memb?rs witnin certain dates,
two subpenas being issued at the request of
the representatives of the Examiner, by which
subpenas they desired to have produced all
telegrams, without reference to the subject of
them, which had passed during the sixty days
immediately preceding the investigation, by
and between all the members of the Senate
and all l.'ie members of the Assembly who
were recorded as having votel for Assembly
bill 273, that being the bill mentioned and re
ferred to in the aforesuid article.
The managers of said telegraph companies
Appeared before your committee ana objected
t â  b*;ing required to enduce the telegrams es
aforesaid, because they had no authority to
do so, and that it is contrary to law for them
to do so. They stated they would produce any
particular telegram trom any particular per
son to or from any particular person that
might be specified with Â»ueh -particularity as
to date and subject matter as would enable
them to rind the telegram or telegrams, should
any exist.
After consideration by your commitiee your
committee sustained the objection, and Rt
various times during the examination also
rrrjjestea of the representatives of the Ex
aminer, who frequently appeared betore your
commitiee, that if they would specify the
name or unmes of any person or person?, to
getner with the date or approximate date of
the sending or receipt of any telegram, and if
ruc*h telegram had reference in any manner
to Assembly bill 27;>, the committee would
Tequire the production of such telegram or
telegrams; but no further information was
given.
Your committee as a consequence had no in- ;
formation upon which to proceed in the mat
-1 ter of the investigation, as the parties who bad |
mad* the charges and statements, us in 3aid j
article set forth, declined to give the source or j
sources ol their information, and we, there- I
fore, concluded to, and did, examine each and '
everyone of the forty Senators constituting
this body, and the most searching questions j
were put to each and every one of them re- j
gerdins; the reasons why he had vo'ed for, or
voted against, Assembly bill 273, when Ii was |
under consideration in the Senate ;. also, as to ,
whether he had been influenced by any cor- <
nipt or improper motives in voting for or j
against the sa d bill ; also, as to
whether ho haU received any tele
gram or telegrams., letters or communications
of any kind regarding tho matter, and as the
result we find that but one telegram was re
ceived regarding Assembly bill 273, and that
was the one received by the Senator from
Santa Clara, which telegram Is in the posses
sion of the committee of the Assembly Inves
tigating like charges. The Senator appeared
before the committee and fully explained the
circumstances and the reasons why he voted
kk he'did concerning Assembly bill 273, and j
also the receipt of the said telegram, and his I
explanations were and are entirely satisfac
tory to your committee, and there is no reaton
for bis actions or motives concerning As
sembly bill 273 being impugned or questioned
as to their honesty and sincerity.
The evidence also discloses that Benator
Shippee, from Tehama and Butte, received a
letter from Mr. Crosi, and that is the only con
necting link there is between Mr. Hayward
and the Hale &. Norcross business aad As
sembly bill 273, for Mr. Cross has long been
the agent of Mr. Hayward, and Das long been
acquainted with the Senator to whom he i
wrote; but the Senator fully explains the mat
ter, and his honesty and integrity in the
premises are not in the least impugned, or the
subject even of adverse comment.
Your committee find from the testimony
! that one of the chief reasons for the activity
i displayed in support of the billâ which was
i not an unusual activity either â arose from the
! fact that the united bar of Madera County re
| quested the passage of such bill, and hud the
same introduced by the Senator representing
tne:r district, which bill was allowed to lnpse
; because Assembly bill 273 came into the Sen
| ate about the time the Madera bill was under
I consideration, and took its place.
Other Senators voted for it because their per
sonal experience appealed to them to do so
and the remainder because they believed it to
be a good bill, and many who voted agains t it
stated that they considered it too broad in its
provisions and that, had the amendments
which were proposed been adopted, they
would have supported the bill.
And your committee is of the opinion that
the entire Senate was in favor of the principle
sought to be put in practice b7 the bill, and
that there was.no bribery or corruption or any
undue influence or attempt at bribery or cor
ruption of any kind or description in con
nection with the saiJ bill and the action by
any Senator thereon, and that the charges and
statements made in said article in the Exam
iner were and are groundless and devoid of
truth in so tar as bribery, attempt at bribery,
corruption, attempt at corruption or the use
of undue influence in tiny manner connected
with the said bill is concerned.
All of the witnesses who appeared before the
i committee were duly sworn and testified, their

ASSEMBLY REPORT.
Faking Journalists Denounced for
Attempting to Besmirch
Legislators.
SACRAMENTO, Cax., March 17.â The
Assembly committee which investigated
the slander of tbe Examiner, charging
members of that branch of the Legisla
ture with having been bribed on Carn:
netti's bill No. 273, made its report to tiie
House this afternoon. It was unanimous,
and condemned the Examiner as a men
dacious and scurrilous publication. The
report was adopted.
The following is the report of the com
mittee in full:
Mr. Speaker: Your committee appointed to
investigate tho charges ol bribery made by the
Examiner of San Francisco against members
of the Assembly, beg leave to submit the fol
lowing report:
The committee met Tuesday, March 2*
at 2:15 p. m., and organized by electing
Mr. Beishaw chairman. Mr. Garret Mc-
Enerney appeared as counsel for the Ex
aminer, and at bis request tne committee
adjourned to Thursday, March 4, at 2 p. m.
Since that time the labors of the commi I
tee have been incessant up to the present
time- We have examined under oath over
100 witnesses, including every member of the
Assembly. The investigation has been most
thorough, but the committee has been unable
to find the slightest evidence to substantiate
the cbares made by the Examiner.
â¢Your committee invited the Examiner peo
ple to assist in the investigation, but they,
acting under the advice of their attorneys,
positively refused to divulge the infor
mation, if any they bad, upon which
the churges were made; and the commit
tee was lorced to proceed with the investi
gation as best it could without the informa
tion which the Examiner claimed to have,
but refased to disclose. With the exception of
three or four witnesses, we have been unable
to brine out rumors relative to the matter,
and we are absolutely unable to trace these
rumors to any autborative source.
There-ore, your committee is uniformly of
the opinion tbftt the article printed in Itie
Examiner of February 27, 1897, headed
"Bribery in aid of Thievery," was based en
tirely upon rumor, and not upon facts, and
we believe that every member of the Assem
bly is innocent of the offense charged.
Wnile we believe that It is the province of
ever}* newspaper to make public all manner ol
corrupt actions by public men we further be
lieve that it should ascertain for a certainty
the facts of the cÂ«se and not blacken the repu
tation of any men or body of men upou idle
rumors.
NO PROOF TO OFFER.
The Examiner's Coyote-Scalp Sen-
sation Not Based on
Fact.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 17.â The
combine of the Examiner and Chronicle
to cast suspicion and discredit upon the
present session of the Legislature met
with the Assembly Committee on Re
trenchment this afternoon and evening
for the purpose of airing the old rumors
that somebody bad been bribed by some
body with something to vote in favor of
Guy's Assembly bill 410, which hnd
been recommended by the Governor, the
Secretary of State and the Attorney-Gen
eral. Through the kindness of Chairman
Melick, the Examiner correspondent was
allowtd to cond-uct the examination, and
to dictate what witnesses should or should
not be called first. Assemblyman Power,
the popular salesman for Nolan Bros.,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 1897.
who bad been libeled by the Examiner,
was not represented by counsel, and was
tnereby at a disadvantage.
The "investigation" had not been in
progress more than half an hour before it
became apparent that the Examiner had
gone on another fishing excursion en
route to the County Jail of Sacramento.
Neither the Examiner correspondent nor
any of the witnesses had any evidence
whatever that there had been any bribery
whatever in connection with the coyote
scalp bill.
It appeared from the evidence that
North of Alameda nas a tine large ear for
rumors affecting the honor of the Assem
bly. He heard some of the usual old
woman gossip about bribery and poured
his tale into that receptive sewei for scan
dal known as the Examiner. When Mr.
.Norm was placed on the stand this after
noon he said that he had no knowledge
whatever of any bribing having been done,
but he admitted that he had dictated an
interview to an Examiner reporter in
which he had slurred his fellow-members
by insinuations.
Price of Sonoma had also mentioned
the rumor to the Examiner, but he testi
fied that he knew of nothing that would
warrant the publication of the libel.
The Examiner coi respondent told his
story to the committee, and it read as
though the Examiner had hired George
McCalvey as a stool-pigeon to entrap
Power, while in a convivial mood and be
fuddled with liquor, into milking some
statements or using some expressions
which could be twisted by the fake paper
iruo something derogatory. The corre
spondent said that he knew nothing ab&ut
the fake dispatch published in the Ex
aminer â it had not passed through his
hands.
Unlike the manager of his paper, "Long
Green," the correspondent had something
to tell, little though it was. He was sent
at 1 o'clock in the morning by "Long
Green" to ask "Jack" Power whether he
had been bribed, and whether ho would
tell the Examiner the names of other
members whom he might suspect of hav
ing been bribed. He found Power in the
billiard- room of the Golden Eagle Hotel,
and while they were talking tbe mysteri
ous McCalvey hove upon- the scene and
was introduced by Power to tho Examiner
inquisitor. He asked Power whether he
had been bribed and received an indig
nant response. Then he asked whether
Power knew of any of his fellow-members
having been corrupted.
It was here, according to the testimony,
that McCalvey proceeded with his role
and said to Power: 'Jack, why don't
yon make a confession of this matter?
Tell this man all you know about it. He
is a good friend of yours."
Mr. Power denied point blank that he
had talked behind the screen with Bert
Packard. During the call of the House
he had stepped into the lobby, and Pack
ard was leaning against one of the pillars
supporting the gallery. Packard said to
him :
"You boys will be locked up here for a
couple of hours. Why don't you give Em
mons a vote and help him out with his
bill?"
That was al! he said. Power then walked
in upon the floor of the House to Mal
colm's seat, where Emmons was begging
Arnerich and others there to help him
out and vote for nis bill. The witness
voted for the bill partly because Emmons
showed him that it bad been introduced
by Guy of San Diego at the request of the
Board of Examinees, and partly because
Emmons bad voted for him in his elec
tion contest. He denied that he had used
the language attributed to him by the Ex
aminer.
Shanahan, Emmons, Kelly, Hudson,
Strain, Pohlman, Wright, Prince, North
of Alameda nnd others testified that they
knew of no bribery or corruption with ref
erence to tbe bill. North said that he was
satisfied that a large number of fraudu
lent coyote claims had been mixed up
with good claims.
"I have no facts," he said, "which in
duce me to believe that there was any
bribery. I had heard only rumors float
ing around. During the call of the House
Packard came up to Emmons and said
that there were enough votes and that it
would not be necessary to proceed with
the call of the House. J know nothing
which in any court of Jaw would incrimi
nate any one."
Wright of Alameda testified that Sen
ator Voorheis told him in the Golden
Eagle Hotel that he understood that there
were suspicious circumstances connected
with the coyote bill, and he hinted about
corruption, and hoped that there was not
going to be another scandal.
The witness confessed in answer to
questions that ho had informed a Chroni
cle correspondent that North of Alameda
had told him that he (Nortii) had heard
somebody say that some one had heard
that somebody bad received $25 for his
vole. But that was merely rumor. He
knew nothing of any bribery.
North of Yolo said that on entering the
room of the Sergeant-at-arrns of the
Assembly, he had heard the clinking of
coin, and that some members passing him,
asked: "Can you change a twenty for me?
Won't you?"
North didn't know who they were,
although he went into the cloakroom to
get his coat.
"There might have been nothing in it
all," admitted North, "but I thought it
strange, because of tbe suspicions which I
had. I know it wasn't Power, because 1
know his voice. It is a common thing,
however, for members to 'josh' one
another on the subject of money for
votes."
All the members who bad changed their
vo:es after the call of the House â Breiling,
Pohlmann and the rest â were called to the
witness stand and swore that they cbanged
thÂ°ir votes at the solicitation of Emmons,
who a<-kecl them as a personal favor to
vote for his bill. They knew of no bribery
or attempt at bribery.
The investigation will bo resumed at 1
o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
WILL GO TO JAIL.
Examiner Culprits Decide to Sur
render to the Sacramento
Sheriff.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 17.
--"Long Green" Lawrence evidently came
to the conclusion to-night that discretion
was the better part of sneaking cowardice.
He deemed it best to come out from the
hole into which he had crawled and take
bis medicine in the shape of rock-
Dreaking at the County Jail in this city.
Ever since Lawrence and Levings dis
appeared from the Supreme Court room
Tuesday afternoon, when the court ren
dered its decision remanding them to jail,
Deputy Sheriff J. J. H inters of Sacra
n;ento County has been diligently search
ing for them to bring them back to the
Sacramento County cage provided for
birds of his feather, but without success.
Hinieis reported to headquarters here
that every train out of San Francisco was
being carefully guarded, and it was un
doubtedly this condition of blockade that
induced the chief faker to send the follow
ing telezram this evening, and which was
received here at 8 o'clock :
San Francisco, March 17.
Leslie Blackburn, Scrgeant-at-arms, Sacramento:
To whom are we to surrender ourselves? We
are unable 10 find Sher.ff's representative
or any repreeentative from your office this af
ternoon. Address reply to Examiner editorial
room. Signed A. M. Lawrence,
L. L. Levings.
To this a prompt reply was returned as
follows:
Sacramento, Cai., March 17.
A. if. Lawrence, L. L. Levings. Examiner Edi
torial Rooms, San Francisco : The Supreme
Court remanded you to the custody of the
Sheriff of Sacramento. His representative is
in the city, has looked for you and is now, as
lam informed. You may save bail by sur
renderiujr to him. L. F. Blackburn,
Sergeam-at-Arms.
As the result of this sunender both
men will be lodged in the jail some time
to-morrow. This action on their part
would also seem to indicate that they
have abandoned the idea of applying to
the Federal court for a writ of Habeas
corpus, as it was at one time reported
they would do.
While the bail of Lawrence and Levings
has b?en technically forfeited by their
failure to surrender themselves to the
Sheriff or his representatives immediately
after the order remanding them was is
sued by the Supreme Court, it is not
likely that any action will be taken to re
cover the amount of their bail bonds by
District Attorney Frank D. Ryan of Sacra
mento.
A prominent criminal attorney of this
city expressed the opinion to-day that no
action for the recovery of bail in a case of
tuis kind would lie, for the reason that
there is no statutory provision for such a
bail bond. In any event it would first re
quire an order from the Supreme Court
declaring the bonds forfeited before any
action for their recovery could be com
menced.
It is not unlikely that as a result of
these developments there will be a change
in the rule adopted in the Supreme Court
admitting prisoners to bail pending the
hearing in habeas corpus cases. Another
way out ot this predicament would be for
the Legislature to pass a law specifically
providing for bail in snch cases.
The same authority here quoted
thought it not unliKely that the responsi
bility for the escape of the prisoners in
this case fell uoon the Sheriff.
He should not have permitted tbe
prisoners to go out of bis sight after they
had once presented themselves in court,
as their presence, in tbe opinion of this
gentleman, avoided the bond.
Had Faker Lawrence not surrendered
at this time he and his unfortunate sud
ordinate would have been published as
fugitives from justice throughout the
State within the next twenty- four hours.
When Senator Morehouse made bis ap
pearance in the Senate this morning he
was given an ovation by his colleagues
and the officers and attaches of the Senate.
Deputy Sheriff Hinters returned to-night,
having left San Francisco at 6 p. sr, after
making final inquiry at the Examiner
editorial rooms for the elusive jailbirds.
He declares that the men purposely and
persistently avoided him. He will leave
on the tirst train in the morning and will
arrive in San Francisco at about 11 a. m.
He will leave there with his prisoners if
they do not again disappear on the 4
o'clock train. They are now said to be
in the custody of Sheriff Whelan.
LEGAL PAPER CHASE.
Lawrence and Levlngrs "Lose"
Deputy Sheriff Hlnters for
a Time.
Shortly after the Justices of tbe
Supreme Court decided that Long Green
Lawrence, managing editor of tbe Ex
aminer, and L. L. Levings, tbe legisla
tive correspondent, would have to go back
to jail the attorneys for the newspaper
men set to work to devise other means to
keep their clients out of the Sacramento
"cooler."
For hours McEnerney, Hegeerty and
Andy Clunie were in close consultation.
Late yesterday afternoon the first two,
armed with a formidable document, went
to the United States Circuit Court. It
was soon learned that the bie document
was a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
In it was set forth the statement that
Lawrence and Levings were unlawfully
restrained of their liberty by Sheriff
Johnson of Sacramento County on an
order from the State Senate. To prove
the latter proposition the constitution of
the United States was cited.
This was all right so far as it went, but
there was a hitch. It seems that Law
rence and Levings were not really re
strained of their liberty, for they were not
in the custody of the Sheriff or hisdeputy.
In fact they were very desirous of being
in custody so that the application for a
writ of habeas corpus could be made to
Judge Morrow. The attorneys explained
that their clients were hunting ior Deputy
Hinters, who was not to be found.
From another source it was learned
that Deputy Hinter3 had "lost" his two
charges in some way and had returned to
Sicramento. At any rate no writ was is
sued by Judgo Morrow. Mr. McEnerney
stated later in tne day that Long Green
and Levings would return to Sacramento
this morning to face the music.
About half-past 9 last night Lawrence
and Levins;* sought out Sheriff Wfcelan
and gave themselves up. They realized
the ridiculous figure they cut praying the
United Statea courts to relieve them of
chains which did not bind them, and de
cided that they would hunt around for
some one to take charge of them.
The Sheriff consented to become their
guardian for a night, but he did not insist
on lock and key and bolt and bar. He
merely telephoned to Sacramento to the
Sheriff there that he had them both, and
to-day the Sacramento Sheriff will get
themâ unless that writ be granted.

PLANNING FOR
TAX REDUCTIONS
Governor Budd Intends to
Strike Out Numerous
Appropriations.
Working for a Bill Which Will
Provide for a Forty* Cent
State Levy.
Should He Succeed, His Successor
Would Inherit a Deficiency
of $4,000,000.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 17.âGov
ernor Budd is planning to bring about the
passage of a tax-levy bill which shall pro
vide for a State tax of 40 cents on the $100,
exclusive of the 2 cents tax for the State
University. In order to do this he will
probably be compelled to leave to his suc
cessor in office and the next Legislature J
the legacy of a deficiency of between $3,
--000,000 and $4,000,000.
The tax levy was the subject of a long
and important discussion in the Gover
nor's office to-duy. There were present at
the conference: Governor Budd, Control
ler Colgan, Chairman Voorheis of the Sen
ate Finance Committee, Chairman Guy of
the Ways and Means Committee, William
Johnson, Robert T. Devlin, Tirey L. Ford,
E. S. Leake, Assemblyman Cutter, Chief
Clerk Burk of the Finance Committee and
Chief Clerk Giilis of the Ways and Means
Committee.
Governor Budd informed his confreres
that he desired to keep the State tax levy
for the next two years down to 40 cents on
the $100, and invited them to make sug
gestions as to how this could be done with
out seriously interfering with the proper
maintenance of the State government and
State institutions.
Among the measures which carry the
largest appropriations are what are known
as the dredger bill, the State highway bill
and the coyote-scalp claims bill. After
due cousideralion of these measures, the
Governor decided that instead of providing
for $300,000 in the tax levy for me dredger
bill he would allow for but $90,000 to be
expended in the next two iJscai years. Of
this amount he estimates that $30,000 wilt
be used the tirst year and $60,000 the sec
ond year in connection with the work of
deepening tbe channel of the Sacramento
River. This determination of the Gov
ernor effectually puts a stop to all the tails
of those who have opposed the dredger
bill, and who were gleefully and widely
proclaiming that it was the intention of
the Governor to veto the bill.
From the present outlook and the re
marks made by the Governor it is almost
certain that he will veto tbe State high
way bill, which ingeniously calls for a
tax levy of a quarter of a mill on the dol
lar, which, in the ordinary way of ex
pressing tax levies, would be 2J^ cents on
$100. This measure would, therefore,
carry an appropriation of $600,000 for the
two years, and would take from the tax
payers of San Francisco $82,C00 a year
without returning one dollar to that City
and County in the shape of road improve-
ments.
So far as the coyote claims bill is con
cerned it will ba signed by the Governor,
should it reach him, but he will provide
in the tax levy for the payment of but a
small portion of the claim, as he antici
pates that the Board of Examiners will
pass favorably on a very small portion of
them.
The amount of the general appropria
tion bill as it passed the Senate is $5,307,
--647. From this the Governor has decided
to strike out many items- so as to bring
the total amount of these appropriations
nearer to the 40 per cent tax levy. But
even with the knife applied deeply in this
direction there will be a further need of
heroic chopping on the numerous claim
bills.
As decided upon by the Governor the
40 cent tax levy will provide lor the fol
lowing amounts for each of the lorty
nintb and iiltieth fiscal years: :
For the general fund ...... $2,343,602
For the school fund. ....: 2,314,963
For Interest, and sinking fund 141.435
T0ta1i........ ....... .......... ....... $4,800,000
, This will call for $9,600,000 for the two
years.' There will be, it is estimated, a sur
plus of about $1,000,000 in the treasury at
the end of the present fiscal year, and the j
2 cent tax of the State University will raise
$480, C00 for : the ; two years. . From these
figures it will be seen that $11,080,000 will
be available : for running the State gov
ernment and the State institutions for two
years, for the deficiency created during
the past two years and for the payment
of claims against the State. .-. yj
' On the : other hnnd 'â  appropriation, de
ficiency and claim bills will in all proba
bility be passed aggregating about $15,
--000,000. How to adjust . this discrepancy
of Â» nearly $4,000,000 between the amount
that will be raised by a 40 cent tax and
the amount that will be appropriated by
the Legislature is the difficult problem
that the Governor will have to solve. â

ACCUSES DUCKWORTH.
Melick Alleges Irregularity In the
Handling of Hie Bill,
No. 654.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 17.âAs
semblyman Melick rose to a question of
privilege this evening and complained
that Clerk Duckworth had neglected to
send to the Senate yesterday Melick's
bill 654, regulating publications by State
officers and commissioners, Common
Councils, Boards of Supervisors in
counties, cities, cities and coun
ties or towns. Mr. Melick added that
Duckworth had threatened that he would
get even on the newspapers which had
roasted him on tbe temporary roll scandal
if he ever had a chance, and he (Duck
worth) had purposely withheld the bill
from the Senate in accordance with his
threat.
Duckworth explained to the speaker in
a voice loud enough to be heard by the
members that he had had a stenographic
report taken of the proceedings yesterday
in connection with the bill, and the re
ports showed that it bad not been passed.
He had consulted his attorney in relation
to the matter and had withheld tne bill
pending the receipt of an answer from his
attorney. He had, however, sent the bill
to the Senate this evening.
Meiick said t. at the journal showed that
the bill had passed by a vote of 44 to 22,
and that the journal was higher authority
tnan Mr. Duckworth's report.
Duckworth made the following state
ment to a Call reporter: "Assembly
bill 654 was refused passage some days
ago. Melick gave notice of intention "to
move for reconsideration. The motion to
reconsider was carried and the bill was
amended under 'special instructions.
When it was again placed on final passage
as amended it was again voted down.
MelicK again tfave notice of reconsidera
tion. The motion to reconsider was again
carried and the bill placed on final passage
yesterday. The roll was called and the
vote stood ayes 39, noes 22. Wright of
Alameda was in the chair.
"When all the members present had
voted I handed the rollcallto the Speaker,
who said, 'Ayes 39, noes 22, and the bill
is lost' I immediately handed the roll
call to the minute clerks, who paged it
and placed it with the other documents
which go to make up the daily journal.
"Just then Melick asked that absentees
be called. Several clerics at the desk, in
cluding myself, suggested to Wright that
this could not be done, as the demand
came too late. He stated to Melick, say
ing that the result had been announced
and that the request for a call of absentees
should have been made before that action
had been made. Melick and others
claimed that he was entitled to a call of
the absentees, though the proper time
therefor bad passed, and Wrigiit ordered
the absentees called. Five new votes were
added for the bill and the result was then
announced, 'Ayes 44, noes 22, and the bill
is passed.'
"interested parties served notice upon
me of their intention to enjoin me from
transmitting the bill to the Senate. Know
ing that a great deal of interest was taken
in the measure and that I was liable to
become involved in litigation over this
case, in which I had no earthly interest,
and would in all likelihood be subjected
to the expense and annoyance of defend
ing my action in the courts, I held the bill
at my desk until I could consult counsel
to-day and satisfy myself *tbat I would not
be in any way liable if I sent the bill to
the Senate, thus certifying to the legal
passage of it by the Assembly, when as a
matter of fact it was fairly and squarely
defeated. When I was convinced that I
would incur no personal liability I imme
diately transmitted the bill to the Senate.

THE CALL PEAKS FOR ALL.
THURSDAY MARCH 18. 1897
There will be plenty of time given for a
fair and full discussion of the tariff bill,
â¢Lut no time for obstruction.
Champion Corbett, like President Cleve
land, now takes an "ex" before his title.
We are having a new deal all round.
While Congress is in s=es=ion it might as
well pass the immigration bill which
Cleveland vetoed. The country neecis
that as well as the tariff.
It would have paid Carson better to
have held a mineral exposition. She
would have made nearly as much cash
and got a great deal more credit-
Crown Prince Constantine of Greece has
gone to the front with an army headed
for Constantinople, and if there is any
thing in a name the town will be his.
The readiness of Greece to defy the
preat powers as well as Turkey confirms
the belief that she has strong friends to
take her part as soon as the war becomes
tierce.
Judging by the results at Carson the
predictions of the sports are no better
than those of the weather prophets, and
yet the weather-men never bet on their
forecasts.
This is dpcidedly an unlncky year for
Spain, and the best thing her people can
do is to avoid war, diplomacy and specu
lations and confine themselves strictly to
legitimate business.
Now that the work on the boulevard
has begun it should be prosecuted vigor
ously to the end. The workingmen of
the City need the employment and the
City itself needs the road.
Protection to American c.tizens abroad
is one of the demands to lie formulated at
ttie Cuban mass-meeting on Sa;urday
evening, and every patriotic citizen suould
be present to approve and indorse it.
As about 400 bills held ov^r from the
last session are before the Senate it is
evident tnat body will not lack flÂ»r work
â while the House is considering the tariff.
In fact the Senate is in great need of a
new *el of machinery for the transaction
of bu-inesh, and this would be a good
time to adopt it.
A proposal has been made in Massa
chusetts to employ all trie male convict
labor in the State ; .n cutting a canal
across Cape Cod. It seems there is no
other employment which can b; given
them without injury to free labor, and as
the canal has long been desired the pro
posal has been very favorably received.
The bill protecting litigants from the
danger of having their cases tried by
prejudiced Judges hes been passed by the
Senate and the men who charged that it
was supported by bribery have been re
manded to jail, and so that episode passes
from the domain of current news to the
satisfaction of everybody of right judg
ment.
The ordinanoe making it a misde
meanor for any one to spit on the public
sidewalks, in the corridors of public
buildings or in the streetcars has been
signed by the Mayor and has gone
into effect. Remember, there'ore, that if
you expectorate in any of these places
Hereafter you cannot expect to rate as a
good citizen.
When asked in the House of Lords to
state the policy of his fiovernment with
regard to Crete Lord Salisbury declared it
would support tin policy outlined in the
recent speech of Premier Meline of
France. The exrellencs of the evasion of
the question was increased by the fact
that the speech of the French Premier
was itself an evasion.
Contract? have been let for beginning
the wcrk of construction of a railroad be
tween Oakdale and Sonora, and the enter
prise is to be pushed vigorously ahead.
This is one of the many evidences that
progress has started again in California.
It will not be many years before we have
the State cridironed with small roads as
feeders for the main thoroughfares.
Secretary Sherman has already been in
consultation with the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate on the subject of
the Nicaragua canal, and as be is known
to be favoraole to the conduct of the en
terprise under the direct control of the
United States the outlook is encouraging.
This administration may yet be noted for
starting that great worlr. and carrying it
well along to completion.
Santa Clara County nas begun ship
ping pickled olives by the barre ful as a
starter on a new industry, and there is a
chance for it to grow into a great oue.
The Eastern people have not yet been
fully educated 10 the use of olives, but
That will come in time, and tnen the
olivp-crower of Santa Clara will be as big
as the prune-grower and have just as
much money to do his talking for him.
An illustration of the difference in the
way newspaper enterprise works in differ
ent sections of the Union was recently
given iff the Boston Journal, which pub
lished on Wednesday a report of an im
portant iecture and announced in the
closing paragraph that it would publish a
picture of the lecturer on the following
Sunday. This was not speedy, but shows
that the Journal evidently knew what the
public expected and intended to satisfy it
witliin the week.
PEOMPT WOSK.
At the meeting of the Ways and Means
Commi'tee on Wednesday the Republican
members proposed that the new tariff bili
should ba reporied to the House to-day.
To this proposition the Democratic mem
bers objected. Their claim was that they
desired tirue'to study the various sched
ules of the bill, but it seems clear that
tin ir real motive was to cause delay and
to obsirnct the passage of the act as long
as possible.
After a full discussion between the mem
bers of the two parties on the committee,
the Republicans decided to hold to their
proposed course, and if nothing unforeseen
occurs the bill will be submitted to Con
gress this morning. This will be prompt
work, indeed, and will Rive encourage
ment to the popular hope that Hie desire
ot the Republicans of the committee may
be carried out to the end and the new
tariff put into operation by May 1.
The claim of the Democrats that they
desire time 10 study tbe Dill before dis
cussing it, or voting upon it, has a spe
cious sound but no good basis to rest on.
The various schedules of the bill were
announced publicly as rapidly as they
were adopted, and have been published in
all the leading newspapers of the country.
The Democrats in Congress have had
ample time, therefore, to study every
clause of the proposed act, and it would
simply be a waste of time to now delay
consideration of tie bill until they bad an
additional week or more given them in
which to read a measure that has already
been read throughout the Union.
It is clear that if the Ways and Means
Committee and the Republicans of the
House should wait upon the pleasure of
the Democrats in this matter the extra
session wouJd be prolonged until it
merged into the regular session in Decem
ber and still the new tariff would not be
enacted. Of this fact the Republican lead
ers are well aware, and they are not likely
to be deceived by the pretense of a desire
for time to study the bill.
Under the programme as arranged
ample opportunity will be given for the
discussion of the new measure after it has
been submitted to the House. Between
now and the Ist of April there will be
plenty oi time for debate on every sched
ule and on every feature of the bill. More
time would be merely a concession to ob
structive tactics, and this the Republican
leaders are not likely to grant.
Up to this time tne work or. the new
bill has been prompt. The people have
been gratified by the rapidity witn which
the Republican party has set about the
task of accomplishing a remedy for exist
ing evils. They have confidence that the
same resolution will continue to the end.
This is no time for delay or for concession
to obstructive minorities. The people
need the new tariff. Prompt worn is im
perative.
OUR COAST DEFENSES.
The, appearance of the recent War De
partment order prohibiting civilians from
visiting our fortifications has been tne sig
nal for a number of sensational dispatches
to the effect that the order has come too
late and that plans of our new coast de
fenses are already in the hands of possible
enemies.
These accounts are very misleading, in
that they inevitably tend to create in the
mind of the public the idea that the value
of our new works has been discounted in
advance and that hostile ships, by a
knowledge of the numbers and location of
suns, will have an easy task in attacking
them.
When we consider that our coast de
fenses are only about one-tenth completed
it is apparent that the present condition
of the works, even if accurately known
abroad, would prove of little value. The
great difficulty of preventing the details
of permanent works from becoming known
has been amply proved abroad, even wnere
the severest penalties are attached to a
breach of trust. Spies in the diszuiss of
workmen, balloon and lone-distance pho
tography are some of the weli-known
methods of securing such information.
After all, the location and number of
guns is only one element of harbor de
fense. Torpedoes form another and very
important element, and as these are
planted only at the outbreak of hostilities,
it will be an easy matter to Keep tueir ex
act location a secret.
The real secrets of harbor defense are
the general "plan of defense" âknown
only to a few high officials â the location
of mining galleries, cables, the arrange
ment of all the complicated system of
distribution of power and light, of tele
phones, range-tinders and the various
auxiliaries so necessary to the effectual
use of the guns themselves. All these de
tails are not apparent to an observer and
may be effectually guarded. These ar
rangements form the nerves, so to speak,
of the entire system and enable the com
mander of a harbor to direct the tire of all
the guns so as to secure the best effect.
By these means the target can be selected
at will and the fire roncentrated, scattered
or withheld, as best suits the varying
stages of the conflict. In this way the
whole forms a mobile instrument under
the control of one mind. AH this is a
matter of organization ar.d of continual
practice and drill. The secret, if any. lies
in the harmonious co-ordination of all the
elements and their smooth working in
times of danger and excitement.
We may rest assured that the War De
partment authorities, after spending mil
lions on coast defence, have not omitted
She ordinary and necessary precautions
needed to make them thoroughly effective
in time of need.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
Secretary Sherman had a consultation
with the Senate Co mmittee on Foreign
Relations on Tuesda y, and discussed with
the members of that committee the two
important subjects of the arbitration
treaty with England and a new treaty
with Nicaragua for the construction of an
interoceanic canal. It is evident, there
fore, the new Secretary is not wasting his
time in office, nor giving the whole ot his
attention to office-seekers, but Has begun
at once to arrange for carrying out great
policies of state.
The consultation was, of course, a secret
one, as beh'ts matter of diplomacy, but it
is made known that Secretary Sherman
is desirous of arranging a treaty for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal ana
will take immediate steps to that end.
While in the Senate Mr. Sherman took
the ground that the canal'should bÂ« con
structed directly by the Government of
tbe United States instead of through the
agency of a private corporation, aided and
assisted by the Government indorsement
of its bonds. From what was learned of
bis conference with the Senate committee,
it appears that he still holds to that view,
and if the Senate accords with him will
endeavor to arrange a treaty with the
Nicaraguan Government for the construc
tion of the canal on that basis.
While some of the Senators who favored
the Nicaragua canal bill of the last ses
sion may bave been induced to do so by
reason of the advantages it gave to the
canal company, thera can be no question
thai tiio great majority of tiieai supported
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 1897.
the bill simply because they desired the
construction of the canal. These Senators
can be counted on to support a treaty
which would give us the r ght to construct
the wort as a Government enterpri c. It
is reasonable to infer, therefore, that the
policy of the new Secretary of State will be
supported by the Senate, and that he can go
forward in arranging the treaty with tlie
assurance of the approval of the body to
I which the treaty will have to be referred
when made.
Under these circumstances the outlook
for the canal is distinctly encouraging.
The one danger to be guarded against is
the possibility of dissensions between
those who favor the Sherman policy of
construction by the Government directly
and those who prefer to hare the work
done by a private corporation. It should
be borne in mind that the main object is
to secure the canal. When the bill advo
cated by tne canal company was before
the Senate it was supported by thosa who
would nave preferred direct Government
control, because they were willing to lay
aside differences in matters of detail in
order to advance the construction of the
great work. It is now the turn of those
who prefer corporate ownership to lay
aside their preferences and support the
plan which it seems the new Secretary of
State will favor.
EFFECTS OF THE TARIFF.
The effects of tiie new tariff, whose en
actment is now assured, are already felt in
industrial circles. This was made evident
by the dispatches of yesterday announc
ing that the great Wiiliamsburg Sugar
Refinery, after a shutdown of over five
montns, has opened with a force of nearly
500 men. The dispatch added that the
introduction of the tariff bill with its in
creased duty on sugar is the cause of the
resumption of work at the mills.
California has more than ordinary in
terest in the sugar industry. The subject
has been so thoroughly studied in this
State that we are able to assert it would
be easily possible for California alone to
produce all the beet sugar which we now
import from foreign lands. Our soil and
our climate are so adapted to the growing
of the best varieties of beets that no other
country could compete with us except in
the element of cheap labor. With a cus
toms duiy sufficient to protect the wages
of our workingmen we can look forward to
the time when the people of the United
States will obtain their beet sugar from
California instead of from Germany.
It is gratifying, therefore, to note this
speedy revival of industry at a great fac
tory which has long been shut down. If
this much is accomplished by the mere
promise of a new tariff we may be sure
that its realization will result in great
benefits to American industry. In these
days, when every city in the Union is
thronged with unemployed men, it is no
slight thins: to hare a factory resume
work and give employment to 500 persons.
It will be a great thing for America when
all the mills now closed shall be reopened
and their machinery started again. We
have waited long for the accomplishment
of this much-desired result, and every item
of news which records the revival of in
dustry will bo received with more than
ordinary gratification.
CIVIL SERVICE HUMBUG.
In a debate in ths Senate on Tuesday
Senator Frye exposed one of the humbugs
of civil service reform as imposed upon
the country by President Cleveland.
Speaking to a re?olntion calling for copies
of all instructions given to engineer
officers in charge of public works relative
to the application of civil service rules to
the engineer department, the Senator said :
The civil service rules have been extended
by the President over the employment of all
mauner of servants through the engineer de
partment of the Government, so that if an
officer way up the Columbia River wants to
hire a laborer for a piece of work the laborer
must have a certificate from the Civil Service
Commission, aud so on in the case of a sur
veyor who may be wanted for two or three
days. It is interfering with all tbe improve
ments of river and harbors, and is absolutely
absurd aud stupid.
It is scarcely necessary to say that the
resolution was agreed to by the Senate.
The absurdity of the rules imposed by Mr.
Cleveland is well understood by all who
have any dealings with their operation.
Senator Frye has simply made known to
the country a condition of affairs with
which the engineering department of the
Government is familiar.
Mr. Cleveland was a bnngler in every
thir.g. He could not even do the right
things in the right way. It is time that
there should be a thorough overhauling of
all his executive orders. This is particu
larly so in the case to which Senator Frye
called attention, but there are many
others of hardly less importance. We
have got rid of Cleveland, and we must
now get rid of the redtape which his stu
pidity and dogmatism Has imposed upon
the public service of the country.

The Parisian critics are clamoring for an

death the late 81r Augustus Harris heard her,
and was so Impressed with her talent that he

paiuter. It is true that even his subjects will
not visit the royal exhibitions of art, and that
a declaration of war follows the ignominious
refusal by a neighboring monarch of the pres
ent of a battle piece, which is the royal chef
d'eeuvre. King Ferdinand, however, comforts
himself with the reflection: "I can set a host
in motion, senrt a floet across the ocean; I'm
a lexicon of learning with omniscience im
bued."
The new Mayor of Marseilles is a socialist
and on the ground of "the greatest amount
of comfort for the greatest number" he has
been the means of passing an ordinance to
suppress the theater hat. Apropos of this de
cree Sarah Bernhardt has- been expressing her
opinion of big hats at theaters and opera
houses. "First of all they are hideous," said
Mme. Bernhardt. "1 cannot imagine how any
woman of taste can wear one. I have tried to
suppress theater hats at the Renaissance, but
without success, for the women would not give
them uti. Hats annoy the spectators and make
the theater look ugly. Whenever Igo to Eng
land I am charmed with the appearance of the
theater; all the women are bareheaded, with
flowers in their hair and the house looks like
a basket of flowers, a beautiful garden par
terre. The women look pretty whether they
arc so or not. Ah! if our Parisiennes only
realized how much handsomer they would
look witnout hats they would never wear those
hideous constructions."
Chicago has supported the Metropolitan
Opera Troupe so little that it was believed
the season would be cut short to prevent
further financial loss. Grau Indignantly de
nied this report the other day and declared
that he would continue to the bitter end, and to
silence the people who complained of the old
hackneyed, operas he has given "The Cid" and
promises "Siegfried" for to-night. The regu
lar season closes on Saturday, and the finan
cial loss will no doubt maVe a heavy draiaon
the surplus made in New York.
According to the annual report of the V7ag
ner Society the number of members is gradu
ally decreasing. This does not mean at all
that the fame of the master is dying out, but
fimi'ly thai tne society has fulfilled its
mission, and there is no longer an? need for
speaking in trumpet tongues concerning Wag
ner. Donizetti, Rossini and Bellini are more
in need of societies now to keep their operas
from being forgotten by the present geuera
tion.
It is a singular fact that Hebrew composers
seem to find as much inspiration for music in
the New Testament as in the Old. Men
delssohn's "St. Paul" is a case in point. F. H.
Cowen has lately come to the front as the
composer of sacred cantatas, and he too has
gone to the New Testament for themes. Cov
en* latest work, "The Transfiguration,"
which was recently performed for the first
time i n Manchester, is spoken cf as a pic
turesque and earnestly written work.
Colonel Henry Mapleson has settled down in
Paris for the time being, where hs hns just
been elected president of the International
Society of Music. The society was only started
recently, but it has already established
agencies at London, Vienna, Berlin, Milan and
New York.
Wagner opera is being given so persistently
in Italy that popular opposition to the music
of the Beyreuth master's more advanced
works is beginning to subside somewhat.
"Tristan and Isolde" has just been performed
at the Royal Theater ol Turin, and has proved
quite a drawing: attraction.
"La Greve dcs Forgerona," a comic opera in
one act, by Max Joseph Beer, has just been
performed for ;he first time at Augsbourg and
has made quite a furor. Max Joseph Beer is
a Viennese and the libretto of his opera ii
founded on a poem by Francois Coppee.
Mme. Falcon, the once illustrious ginger,
has died in Paris, aged 88 years. She was a
dramatic soprano of such renown in her day
that a prima donna po<ses3Â©d of her quality
â  of voice is always aliudea to in French opera
parlance as the "FaLcon" of the trout>e.
The committee which is busy organizing the
fetes at Bergamo in honor of Donizetti's cen

"Sham he O'Brien," Stanford's Irish romantic
opera, has repeated its London and New York
success in Chicago.

THE END IS APPROACHING
New York Sud.
The course of many libraries, reading-rooms
and clubs In rigorously excluding the World
and Journal newspapers is sure to be pursued
by decent institutions of the same kind gen
erally. It is a movement whose natural im-
pulse is the disgust and indignation which
have been increasing in all 'quarters against
the licentionsness, the vulgarity and the crim-
inal spirit exhibited by those shameless papers
with an effrontery almost without example in
the History of journalism.
The public are not unreasonably distrustful
of the motives often influencing the assaults
of newspapers upon each other, looking upon
them as obviously provoked Dy rivalry; bul in
the ca*es ot these two notorious journals there
is no suspicion of any such animus in the de
nunciations which proceed from the newspaper
world generally. Â»nid there is no ground for
any. These publications occupy a field by
themselves, into which no competition except
the competition between themselves enters or
can enter. They have gone down so low, their
wallowing in filth is so complete, that it is
impossible to get down any lower. The in
genuity of man can devise no baser methods
than th?irs.
Accordingly these two papers stand apart
and* are recognized by the public as peculiar
in tneir depravity. It is not merely their in
decency which is offensive, but even more
their vulgarity. They proceed on the theory
that the literary and artistic taste of the peo
ple is low and vile, and can be even further
debused until tne great popular demand shall
be satisfied by the coarseness and rottenness
of which they are the exclusive purveyors.
Their assumption is that as it is easier lor hu
man nature to fall than to rise they will have
no difllcuitr in overcoming the moral und re
ligions influences exerted for its elevation. If
the low tastes of people are gratitied, they
think, their higher impulses will be stifled, so
that only the base will suit the public appe
tite which they are trying to create.
The iudecencv and vulgarity of these papers
are not so pernicious as their rivalry in at
tempts to get a sale for their sheets by stimu
lating and appealing to tae spirit of envy, dis
content, sedition and all the meanest passions
possibly engendered in the breast of man.
They are both run by men boasting of the pos
session of very great private fortunes, who in
their greed for more money are striving to
corrupt the puolic mind and in tin me public
anger against property, law and order, consti
tuted authority and all that gives strength,
security and moral stability to society.
Their theory of the corruptibility of the
public, however.will not work. The unanimity
with wlurii decent associations are excluding
them is only the first step toward their down
fall. The revulsion of the members cf these
institutions against their vlleness and devil
is hue as is a symptom of the public sentiment
which always sooner or later lays such jour
nals low.

A BOY STRUCK BY A CAR
Emil Bazzini Seriously Injured
at Powell and Greenwich
Streets.
He Was Playing on the Track and
While Running Off Sipped
and Fe 1.
_,F J mil Bazzini, a boy 314 years old, living
with his parents at 1828 Powell street,
was seriously injured by an electric car at
Powell and Greenwich streets yesterday
morning.
The boy was playing on the track be
tween 9 and 10 o'clock, when car 1108
came down the grade. The molorman
rang the bell and the little fellow started
to run off the track. In doing so be
slippe'l and fell across the rail. The car
struck him and threw him off the rail,
and then went on some yards before it
was stopped.
When picked up the boy was uncon
scious. He was placed in a hack and
driven to the Receiving Hospital, where
Drs. Weil and Rinne found that he had
sustained serious injuries. His riijht
collarbone was broken, there was a con
tusion over his left eye and an abrasion
on his herd. It was also thcght that his
skull was fractured and he had sustained
internal injuries.
Dr. Weil said that the boy was also sn'
fering greatly from the shoe* to his sys
tem and there was a possibility that he
might not recover.
,At the point where the accident oc
curred the electric cars run down a hill
on tiieir way to the wharf. The car was
running at its usual speed, and if the boy
had not slipped and fallen he would have
got cl-ar of the track before the car could
reach him.

TO SEEK THEIR
NATIVE ELEMENT
The Gunboats Wheeling and
Marietta to Be Launched
This Morning.
To Be Sent Into the Water at
the Tame Moment From
N D fferent Slips.
Indies From the Respective Cities
for Which the Fighters Are Warned
Will Christen Th m.
The gunboats Wheeling and Marietta
are to be slipped into the water this
morning at the Union Iron Works, at
6 minutes to 1L
The occasion will no doubt attract a
large crowd. The christening will be
done by ladies representing the respec
tive cities alter which the iiguting-boat3
are named.
Hon. J. K. Butts, Mayor of Wheeling,
has delegated Miss Lucie 8. Brown to
christen the Wheeling. Miss Brown is a
native of Wheeling and is now visiting in
California.
Mrs. H. Clifford More of Naples, Cal.,
formerly of Marietta, Onio, will chr.steti
the Marietta. She is the daughter of
Brigadier-General T. C. H. Smith.
The gunboats, which are to be launched
together, celong to a group ot six author
ized by the act making appropriation for
the naval service for ihe fiscal year ending
June 30, 1896.
These sjx gunboats are designated as
licht-draugbt composite gunboats of about
I 1000 tons displacement.
Provision was made that not more than
two would be built in one yard or by one
contracting party.
Four of these gunboats were fitted with
single screws and rigged so as to carry a
considerable spread of canvas. The Whee
ing and Marietta were to be fitted witu
twin screws and have a very small amount
of canvas.
The trials of these two vessel?, each
having boilers representing a distinct
type, on the merit? of wlr.ch many heated
discussions have been going on lately in
engineering circles, will give a splendid
opportunity to establish the efficiency of
the two types of boilers and the two
different methods of applying forced
draught. The result of the trials of these
two vessels will be looked forward to with
great interest by leading engineers en
gaged in marine engineering.
They are required to develop a sr>eed of
12 knots on their trials, and it is antici
pated that they will very materially ex
ceed the speed required by the contract.
These vessels, considering their small
displacement, are being fitted up in the
most elaborate manner. Nothing that
finds place in a first-class war vessel will
be omitted.
Their composite character â that is, the
steei framing and plating, being covered
to above the water line with Jour-nich
planking, partly of pine and partly ot
teak, with an outside sheathing of cop
perâwill enabie these vessels to remain
at sea or occupy a foreien station for a
long perioa of time without the necessity
ut docking.
The complement will consist of ten
wardroom officers, 125 men and a manna
guard o: ten men.
They are fitted with electric light plants
in duplicate. They w.ii nave a coal ca
pacity of 200 tons and will carry on their
trials weights in add.tiou to the weight of
the completed hull and machinery and
spare parts which will represent a dis
placement of 1000 tons.
The engines for these vessels are boil t
from designs by the Union Iron Works
and approved by the Navy Department,
and are of the triple expansion, vertica',
direct-acting type. High- pressure cylin
der, 12 inches; intermediate-pressurecylin
aer, 1834 incne3; low-pressure cylinder,
2 inches ; the stroke of all pistons being 16
inches. At full power tÂ«Â»Â« engines are in
tended to make about 200 revolutions p*r
minute, with a steam pressure of 180
pounds in the boilers.
Tte engine frames are entirely of bronie,
including the condensers, and are very
compact.
It is expected that these vessels v ill bÂ«
ready in about sixty days alter launching,
as a large portion of the machinery is al
ready in place, and the boilers being on
board and Jilted in each of the vessels.
The fact of both of these vessels being
launched from different slips at exactly
the same time will be a mat;er of consid
erable interest to technical men who are
interested in these matters, as there is no
record of two vessels being launched I'rom
the same yaid at the same instant of time
from different ways, and it will be a mat
ter of considerable speculation among
those present as to which of the two, re
leased at the tame time, will reach their
element first. Their behavior on reaching
the water will no doubt be taken as an in
dication of how they are to behave them
selves after they net thÂ«re.
The entertainment committee has re
ceived an invitation from the officers
of the Union Iron Works to have
the visiting delegates of the Rail
way Mail Service Mutual Benefit As
sociation and their ladies witness tha
launch. They will take the Third-street
electric-car (green car) at the corner of
Market street, not later than 10 a. m., and
transfer at Third and Townaend streets to
the Potrero cars for the Union Iron
Works. Their badges will admit them to
the works.
Through the courtesy of Captain H. L.
Howlson of the United States steamship
Oreeon an opportunity to visit and in
spect trie battle-ship tli is afternoon has
been afforded. Tney will assemble at 2
P. M. at Hownrd-street wharf No. 3, where

for the purpose by the firm of John D.

ST. PATRICK`S DAY
Su Patrick's day, rightly termed the
holiday of the Irish race, was celebrated
in tliis City yesterday in a manner appro
priate to its combined religious and na
tional significance.
The fact that the devotional exercises of
the day took precedence of the secular
and were, if anything, more largely at
tended, served to substantiate the claim
to spirituality which is advanced by the
Catholic church on behali of her Irish
sons.
The silver jubilee of St. Patrick's
Church, which lias been signalized by an
impressive triduura of special services,
closed yesterday with a superb solemniza
tion ot pontifical high mass, more fully
noticed elsewhere.
The services at St. Mary's Cathedral,
St, Francis Church and other Catholic
places of worship were also well attended.
In the afternoon a large portion of the
Irish population was attracted to Metro
politan Hall, and in the evening to the
Mechanics' Pavilion, where excellent pro
grammes, mainly composed of national
music and national oratory, svero agree
ably rendered.
Probably the very latest event of the
day's celebration was the banquet given
by the Knights of St. Patrick at Delmoni
co's, which proved a notable, success.
Celebration of the
Solemn Triduum.
The solemn triduum held in commem
oration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the dedication of St. Patrick's Church
was brought to a close yesterday morning
by the ceiebration of pontifical high mass.
The attendance was enormous, ga.lerie*,
nave and side aisles being packed with
people. Many hundreds more were un
able to gain admittance. The mass began
at 9 o'clock, but long before that hour
every seat in the vast building was taken
and those who delayed their arrival had
to content themselves with standing room
and were fortunate if they succeeded in
getting beyond the outer doorway. It
would be difficult to estimate the number
of this remarkable congregation, but a
very conservative estimate makes the
figures at least 5000. The heat was so ex
cessive that many ladies were almost
prostrated, but happily for the even tenor
of this auspicious silver jubilee, no really
serious casualties occurred.
The intrinsic magnificence of the mass
was greatly assisted by the superb decora
tions oi the sanctuary, which was almost
bidden by a profusion of white blossoms,
tree palms, ferns, roses and lilies. Art vied
with nature in producing an effect of the
utmost brilliance.
The celebrant yesterday was Most Rev.
P. W. Iliordan, Archbishop of the diocese,
assisted by tne following priests, who
without exception have at some time or
other been connected with the parish of
St. Patrick: Rev. William B. O'Connor,
assistant priest; Rev. P. J. Grey and Rev.
Michael King, deacons of honor; Rev. J.
P. Nugent, deacon at mass; Rev. J. P.
Coyle, subdeacon at mass; Rev. P. E. Mul
ligan, master of ceremonies; Rev. P. J.
Quinn, assistant m tster of ceremonies.
Of the foregoing Father O'Connor, now
of St< ckton, acted in the same capacity at
this church twenty-five years ago. Father
Grey was pastor thirty-five years asro, ten
years before the dedication of the present
edifice. Father King was assistant priest
thirty-eight years ago; Fathers Nugent
and Coyle were incumbents eighteen and
fifteen years ago respectively, and Fatlier
Mulligan was iormerly an altar-boy of the
church. Father Quinn is the present as
sistant. AmÂ»ng other priests in attend
ance were: Father J. Brannan, Revs. J.
F. McGinty and Joseph McQuade cf Holy
Cross Church, Rev. P. R. Lynch of St.
Thomas', Rev. P. ,S. CaÂ«ey of St. Peter's,
Rev. J. Gannon of St. Brendan's, Rev. P.
J. Cnmniingsof St. Charles', Revs. J. E.

Rev. W. P. Kirbv of St. Agne?'. Rev. P.
Scanlan of St. Joseph's. Rev. H. Wynian
of &t. Mary's, Revs. J. Dempsey and J. F.

respect worthy of the occasion. The or
dinary resources of the choir and organ
were augmented by a picked orchestra of
twenty pieces and a treble quartet under

Key. Father Yorke delivered the sermon
of (be day, in which be dealt at length
with Ihe life and work of St. Patrick, the
patron of the church and Ireland's <?reat
apostle. He presented a retrospect of the
successi'ul development of the church
irince its dedication twenty-five years ugo,
referring pathetically to the vicissitudes
which have removed many members of
the Hoi k during that period. Speaking of
the saint he said: "He is more than the

Christianity. This is a festival not of one
ci:y, or country, but of the people whose
feet are on every strand. Together we
gether to clebrate the memory of Him
who first brought the tidings o; great joy.
This is a day sacred to faith; it is the sym
bol of the cross, which has always bound
Irish piety to Irish patriotism. It tells of
the man whoso national triumphs have
I lent him lame; it is the fulfillment ol that
wondrous mission which made the chil
dren of Erin a chosen generation. Earh
nation has its own conception of what
constitutes glory.
"Some celebrate those men whose actions
are considered great, or those events whicn
are supposed to cast luster upon its his
tory. So the Irish race celebrates its fes
tival, but our hearts are elevated above
the petty cares of the world, end are
placed upon a hign mountain of faith.
To the eyes of the spirit is shown the eter
nal battle between right and wrong, the
ti_'lit between light and darkness. It the
soul be higher than the body and if heaven
be nobler than the earth, then this day of
faith tells of heaven, and is glorious with
the glory that makes it inferior to none
of the festivals celebrated by the sons of
men."
The speaker closed his exordium with
an eloquent review of the missionary Ja-
bors of St. Patrick and the history of
Catholicism subsequent to his death, con
tending that Irish priests and Irish mon
asteries Kept alive trie flame of faith and
learning throuehout the long period of
darkness which followed the incursions of
the northern barbarians.

The programme opened with an organ
preludo of popular airs by Professor M.
Mer.gan, nfter which tho chairman de
livered a brief introductory juidress.
"To th- Irish people," lie said, "St. Pat
rick's day has a double significance. This
morning in our churche< the triumphs
and glories of Patrick eloquently set
set forth by talented pulpit orators, but
this. afternoon nnd evening we assemble
in our thousands to pledge anew our love
and devotion to the old land, and again
enter our protest against the brutality of
her rulers. England ha* forced the Irish
people out of their native laud to become
wanderers over the face'of tha earth, think
ing they would trouble 'ertio more. Cut
bus she eot rid of thim ? No; she meets
them everywhere, and wherevi-rtney have
influence thai influence is used against
her, and nowhere is it more potent than
in this great republic of the West.
"St. Patrick's day," he continued, "has
been accepted by common consent as Ire
limd's national holiday, and it will re
main such until some other day takes its
place â some other day on which a gifted
son of the Irish race at the heart of a
united people shall win nor freedom, and
either with his pen or with his sword
write the epitaph ot Robert Emmet."
An original poem, prepared by M.
E. O'Connor for the occasion, was feel
ingly read by Miss Gertrude Cahalin. Of
the fourteen stanzas the following seloc
tions will serve to show its patriotic char
acter:
Saint Patrick, ihon who waitest
'1 he Kternal Throne beside.
Of patron saints tne irreittstâ
Thy children scattered wide
This day f om myriad meetings
i.y forest, lane and sea,
A Hundred ih-'usand greetings
Waf I heavenward to thee !
O brethren of the widelysundered Gael,
Whose longing eves are Jlxci.l on innisfall.
Two watcnwo <ls thrill tout ancient fervid bloodâ
bt I'atrick's Faith ana hriu's Nationhood !
For one or both your sires have fought and died;
In cause of bom meir hearts have been alliedâ
Twin sha era <>f a people's smiles and tears
Across ttie spau of twite five hundred years 1
c.i I'air ck, prince of saints! what words may tell
Thy star-bright story or expound the spell
That graved in hrin a inmost heart thy name
And hied her pulse wiin faith's undying flame.
Ti.i streamed . h<- 1k > of learni ig and of grace
To many â  far-off land aud pagan race.
.Nor ceased to snlne with r.t>-auf si glow
Adowu the tear-fraught centuries of woe,
Till now we stand within the noontide blaze
Of that same faith that in those oldeu days
on Tara's hill was lit.
It concludes:
Jerna, jewel fair upon the ocean's heaving breast,
What means to-day this Kulf stream of affection
for the west?
What singi the message-laden breeze from o'er
the southern sea?
What i iilitus flasn the vibrant wires from many
;ands to thee?
Ah! they answer back the foeman's taunt, the
riba'd jlbo and sneer;
Thy childien's fealty cheers thy heart, they bid
thee liave no fnar.
Thy right to nationhood is safe; the birthright,
never sold,
Cannot b* snatcbed by robber hands or bought by
traitor gold.
Then swing aloft that banner old, it tells a twofold
;ale
Of sainthood and of nationhood to the widely sun
dered Gael !
Rhys Thomas and J. J. Rafael of
of the Tivoli contributed tenor barytone
solos respectively, which were enthusi
astically encored. A humorous dramatic
sketch entitled, "The Silent System,"
presented in a masterly manner by Miss
Freda Gallick and Louis Butler of the Co
lumbia Theater, was one of the most
successful features of ai excellent pro
gramme, and Miss Georgia Stone, also of
the Columbia, was loudly apnlauded for
hrr clever recitation. "The Jealous
Wife."
Miss N. C. Kirby and Miss Kitty BlacK,
both pleasing soprano vocalists, gave a na
tion nl flavor to the entertainment, the for
mer singing Moore's "Belipve Me" and the
latter "The Star-spangled Banner." A trio
composed of Miss Pearl Noble, Miss Maud
NÂ»ble and Miss Mildred Clarke sang
'Kathleen Mavourneen" and "Shule
Aarau" very effectively, and Mrs. (Kim
ball) Fitzsimons' harp selections, "Gems
of Enn," were also greatly enjoyed.
David Manlioya's fine rendering of "The
Minstrel Boy" completed the musical por
tion of the grogratnme.
Just before the delivery of J. J. Bar
rett's oration a diversion was created by
the unexpected entry of J. J. Donovan,
the State president of the Ancient Order
of Hibernians, who on behalf of that body
â presented t: c chairman, Mr. Mulhern,
with a tasteful badge representing the
American Has: and the rising sun of Ire
land in conjunction. This presentation
was in the nature of n tribute to Mr. Mul
hern's patriotic activity.
Mr. Barrett then spoke in part as fol
lows:
A patriotic people taking to the battlefield
of their native land to preserve the liberty
achieved for them by their fathers, or to
secure the freedom which the sovereignty of
nations meant them to enjoy, is a magnificent
spectacle rarely surpassed in the sphere of
human action. It, challenges the sympathy
and admiration of the world. Whether they
succeed or fail, the verdict is that it Is a proud
deed, and those who made the endeavor earn
long life in the memory 01 the race.
But there is another spectacle which sur
passes even this in grandeur, and that is the
sight of a people, although banished from
fatherland by its relentless misruler, though
separated forever from kindred and loved
ones, scattered over every quarter of the globe
and driven to seek subsistence in foreign
lands, the sight of a peoDle who, despite atl
thiÂ», have carried with them in their wander
ings, irom youth to manhood and from man
bond to the grave, an undlnnnished love for
their native land, an unfaltering determina
tion that their country shall yet be free, that
its wrongs shall vet be righted, and day after
day and hour after hour gather together in
exile to encournge and cheer each other, and
with united voice to make petition to the all
merciful God 10 let fall the avenging arm
which has cast its shadow for years upon it*
inhuman oppressor. The Roman was proud
of his country when it v. ns first in wealth,
power and achievements.
Hut when one's native land has neitherpower
nor place among the empires of the world and
her only glory 1s a willingness to earn and en
joy her freedom, then to love one's country
ana to be proud of it, to be proud to live lor it
nnd to be willing to die for it, is patriotism
heaven-born. That is the character of the
love of their native land that stamps the I: ish
race.
Ami this love of native land, this undying

other affection that should bind a citizen to

The choir having sung St. Patrick's
hymn, Mozart's "Twelfth Mass" was
splendidly rendered. Father Caraher
preached an appropriate sermon from St.

sense of the term.
The handsome dining-room of the hotel

Survivors cf the Ocean Disaster Tell
of Horritl Sufferings and
Priv tions.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 17.â The
Fren<u line steamer Ville de S:. Nazaire,
which sailed from this port on March 0.
boui.dforthe West Indies, foundered at
sea. 0! her eighty-two passengers and
crew, only four are known to have been
saved.
TLese arrived here yesterday on the
schooner Hilda, after a week's drifting
about he Atlantic in an open boat, during
which thirty-four out of the thirty-eight
occupants went mad or died of starvation.
The saved are:
Berry, , Inspector of the Compagnia
Generale fransailantique.
Maire , the ship's doctor.
Stauts , third engineer.
Tagado , a San Domingan.
Among the lost are:
D' Andrews , first lieutenant.
Herbert , seco.id lieuteaaat.
Lepune , purser.
Nicolay , second captain.
Mariani , chief engineer.
Taearto Mrs. and four children, starved
to death.
The steamship V:lle de Saint Nazaire
left this port on March 6, bound for West
Indian ports. She was one of the smaller
vessels of the French line and had been
engaged in the West India trade for years.
She was the first to come to New York
when the line between New York and the
West Indies was established here.
The steamship encountered severe
weatner on March 7, while off Hatteras.
Tremendous seas broke over her; she
rolled and pitched; floods of water found
thsir way throueh the gratings to the
engine-room and extinguished the fires.
The vesse was unable to make any head
way, being waterlogged. Captain Jac
qneneau gave the order to man the four
boats.
There were eighty-two persons in all.
In the haste to leave the vessel it was im
possible to get provisions or water to last
more than a day. Of '.he four boats only
one has been heard from. It is believed
the other three have been lost. The
largest boat contained thirty-eight per
sens. It had practically no provisions.
It was tossed about upon the rough seas
for seven days and seven nights and for
six of these days and nights the passen
gers were without food or drink. Their
sufferings were the most intense. The sea
calmed and they drifted about.
The survivors of this ocean tragedy are
hardly yet able to give a correct story of
the last twelve days.
Cartain Berry, the Inspector-General of
the French line, is confined, to his room
in the HofÂ»l Martin. His story is a nar
rative of privation and hardship, such as
is seldom heard in the annals of the sea.
The other survivors are on board the Nor
mandie and the Yille do Brest, a sister
ship of the ill-fated vessel.
In telling of how the wreck occurred,
the survivors say that the steamship sailed
from this port bound for Port-au-Prince,
Hayti, at noon on March 4. That was on
Saturday. Sunday came with the wind
blowing storimly from ttie southwest.
The ship began to plunge heavily in the
sea?, waves burst over the deck in torrents
and early on Sunday night the flood in
vaded the hreroom and clouds of biasing
Bteam arose from the hatches, telling that
the tires had been drowned.
An attempt was made to heave the ship
to, but water was bursting over the derk
in such torrents and poured down the
hatchways so fast that Captain Jacque
neau, seeing that his vessel was on the
point of foundering, thought then only of
saving ihe crew by means of the boats.
The steamship was almost wholly un
provided with bulkheads, having only one
of the safeguards against such disasters,
whereas a modern vessel of her type and
size would have at least half a dozen.
But she did not have them, and, as a
result, soon was unable to lift her decks
to the rushing masses r.f water.

by at least SCO spectators who were

injured.
In the sixth attack, however, M.

CANTUA CREEK MYSTERY.
Half Finished Meal on the T>b/e of an
Isolated and Deserted Dwelling Sug

FRESNO, Cal., March 17.â A vary mys
terious case from the Cantua Creek region
in the western portion of this county was
brought to the attention of the officers to
day. A deserted hou-e has been found,
there, and in *ome strange manner its
tenants have disappeared. The dwelling
stands on the plain, eight miles distant
from any human habitation. It is com
fortably furnished throughout, and a half
finished meal is prepared on the table.
It looks an if the person whose home it was
had been suddenly called away. Every
thing in the dwelling was covered with
dust, and appearances indicate that no
one has been there for two or three
months past. It could not be ascertained
to-day who had been living in the house
or who owned the land on which it stands.
The parties who discovered the deserted
dwelling looked through a number of
papers they found. Judging from these
the name of the missing tenant was John
Hanaley.

FAVORS TREATY
WITH ENGLAND
Senate Committee Declares
for Friendly Relations
With Britain.
It Is D cided That King Oscar ot
Norway and Sweden Shall
Not Be the Umpire. .
Acting Chairman Davis Will Urg'
; Speedy Action on the Important
.V* Measure.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 17.â
Senate Committee ,on Foreign Relations
spent two hours this morning in the con
sideration of the treaty of general arbitra
tion with Great Britain, and then ordered
a favorable report to be made to the
Senate to-morrow with amendments in
line with those" mentioned previously in
these dispatches. The amendments are
administrative only in charac er. The
scope of the treaty has not been touched.
; Much of the public criticism against
the action of the committee during the
last session was due to the alleged fact
that the committee had emasculated the
convention and made it practically a
meie sham. The amendment to the first
article, that no question relative to tlie
foreign or domestic po'icv of either party
should be included, which was previously
given sucii prominence, had disappeared
entirely. The same result is reached,
however, in a very different way. _'
: The designaiion or Kiug Oscar of
Sweden and Norway as umpire has been
stricken out, as has been all reference to
the Supreme Court of the United States as
members of the tribunal established un
der the treaty. In place of this designa
tion it is stipulated that "jurists of re
pute" shall be claimed by the President
to act as* such arbitrators.
The chiei amendment, however, is found
in the clause which reserves to the United
States the sanction of the wnole treaty
making power in deciding what questions
shall hi submitted to arbitration. This
provision will make it necessary for the
President to submit to the Senate for its
approval all question* intended to be sub
mitted to the arbitrators. :;.;â¢â 
The committee has acted in the belief
that it has only reserved to this Govern
ment the identical power reserved by
Great Britain, which, under the treaty,
decides through its Premier what ques
tions shall be arbitrated. ~
Under the British form of government
one man alone, the Premier, acting for
the crown, determines all matters of this
sort and is the sole treaty-making power
of that nation. There i->, under this
general treaty, no deviation from the
universal rule of the British Government
and reasoning thus the Senate committee
sees no reason why there should by any
change in the practice", based upon these
stipulations of the written constitution,
that have governed such questions siive
the foundation of this Government. In
other words both powers are made equal
and the subsequent proceedings under
the treaty alter it shall be ratified will
proceed according to the laws of the
respective governments of the contracting
parties. â¢
Under the treaty as thus amended no
argument can consistently be advanced
that the Senate is relinquishing any of the
prerogative given it by the constitution.
It will, by ratifying this treaty, indorse
and subscribe to t c doctrine <y" universal
arbitration, to which the United States
stands pledged, and then leave all ques
tions as to details connected with the sub
mission of pacific subjects to the consti
tuted authorities of both countries. Act
ing Chairman Davis will urge as speedy
action in the Senate as possible. It is
quite likely that much of the time during
the next two weeks will be spent in execu
tive session. ;:
Pending the arrival of the tariff bill in
the Senate the treaty will be discussed,
together with tbe consideration of Presi
dential nominations, and it is the confi
dent expectation of tbe committee that it
will be able to have this convention out
of tbe way by the first of April.
INCENDIARISM AT FRESNO.
Thieves Set Fire to a Clothing- Store and
a Conflagration Is Narrowly
Averted.
FRESNO, Cal., March 17.â At a late
hour last nignt fire was discovered in the
Poor Man's Friend clothing-store on
Marivosa street, adjoining the Farmers'
Bank.
Some passerby happened to notice the
smoke issuing from the cracks of the
door and gave the alarm. The blaze was
quickly extinguished by the chemical
engine.
Had it not been for the timely discov
ery of the fire and the call of the engines
before it had gained any serious headway
a disastrous conflagration might have re
sulted.
The store is located in the business cen
ter of the city, and had toe fire communi
cated to the wooden sheds In the rear, the
department would have had a hard time
in checking the fiames.
There are some very peculiar circum
stances connected with the origin of the
rirf.
The rear door of the store had been
forced open, a hole having been cut
through the brick wall and the iron cross
bar lifted from its place. Whether this
was done for the purposes of burglary or
incendiarism is not known. It is thought,
that the burglar might havt dropped a
match or accidentally ignited the clothing.
As far aÂ« can be ascertained there is
nothing missing from the store, and this
wenis to lend c >lor to the contention that
burglary was not the purpose. The au
thorities are making a thorough investi
gation. The store is ownea by RaJin &
Kaiup.
CROOKED DEAL AT SPOKANE.
Tray of Diamonds Taken by a Stranger
While a Pawnbroker's Clerk
Goes Blind.
SFCKANE, Wash., March 17.â A well
dressed man walked into D. Dornberg's
jewelry ttore and pawnshop, on one of the
most traveled thorouchfares in the city,
shortly before 7 o'clock this evening and
successfully made away with a tray con
taining $3000 worth of diamond rings.
The trny had been taken from the safe
by the cierk, Max Goldstein, in order to
show the rings, and as he set it down on
the showcase t lie stranger threw a hand
lul of white powder in bis eye?, blinding
him. The robt er hastily grabbed the tray
and was out of the store before Goldstein
could give an alarm.
Pedestrians going by 'he store pave
chase to ihe fleeing robber, who finally
eluded pursuit by dodging under a mov
ing train. B-fore the pursuers could lol
low, the robber bad vanished in the
darkness of toe railway tracks. From the
description given, the police recognize trie
robbery as the work of a well-known
crooK.

117 Years.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 17.-Fran
cisco Garcia, the oldest man in the United
States, died here this afternoon, aged 117
years. He lived ftt 615 Bucna Vista street
and passed away at 12 o'clock. Th â  old
man was a native of Sinaloa, Mexico, but
came here when he was 25 years old and
has resided in this pueblo ever since.
Senor Garcia was a familiar object on
the streets of that region of the city in
which ne lived. He wore partly the Mex
can costume, always appearing with a
silver-braided high felt Mexican hat Of
late yeais he has been very poor and has
been aided by the Lafranco family.
There is a story extant to the effect that
years ago he was induced to appear in a
dime museum as a living skeleton, but
there is some doubi about this, as he was a
man of great dignity. -
His funeral will be made an event of
great magnitude by the Mexican popula
tion, as he was regarded with great rever
ence by his compatriots. His age has
been questioned, but he had documents
which sustained his c aim, though the
papers themselves were never verified.

Many Bucii have applied at the Institute and have been given immediate relief and ;

The Government Not Inclined to A>

Island
HONOLULU. Hawaii, March 10.â This
city was wiid wiih excitement for a short
time last night, owing to ruruo.s of an
alarming nature concerning an outbreak
among the Japanese at the quarantine
station.
The rumors had their source in a report
that the Japanese at th* quarantine sta
tion, were in an ugly and excited mood.
Tea heavily armed police were at once
sent to the station and so far there has
been no outbreak.
The Japanese who are the cause of this
trouble are those who arrived on the
Japanese steamer Shinshin Maru, manned
entirely by a Japanese crew.
This vessel was reported to have 663
paajengers in the steerage and one in tha
cabin. They were landed at the quaran
tine station and on the following mur
ing a case of German measels broke out on
board.
Five days additional quarantine was or
dered, not from any alarm about the
meases, but because the Government
wanted time to investigate the circum
stances surrounding the landing of so
many Japanese. The vessel was con
signed to the Kobe Immigration Com
pany, but the Government having been
notitied of her coming gave str<ct orders
that no communication whatever should
be allowed between the officers of the ves
sel and the agents.
This was done to checkmate a plan that
has been in successful operation here to
land Japanese.
The captain and agents of the Shin
shin Maru have been notified that clear
ance papers will not be given the vessel
until the reiected immigrants have been
taken on board for return. So far thecap-r
tain has refused to taice t em.
At noon today the Government inves
tigation came to an end. Seventy-six only
of the Jaoanesa will be allow d to land.
The remainder have been notified they
must return whence they came.

Advices received from Sancti Spiritus
detail the attack made by rebels on the

On the night of the sth about 1 o'clock
in the morning the rebels, after taking
passessiou of the town, attacked the rail
road station, which had been converted
into a fort and protected by a detachment
commanded by Captain Puertas, two ser
geants, a corporal, 100 soldiers and about
fifty volunteers. The insurgents fired on
the fort from all aides, thrusting their
guns into the very loopholes of the fort
The firing then became intense, and the
defenders, in spite of their stout resist
ance, were forced to abandon the fort,
leaving their dead and wounded, with
their arms and ammunition. Only a fa w
volunteers managed to escape. A sergeant
and five soldiers were killed. The captain
and fifteen soldiers were seriously

as indicating the policy of the powers in
the question.
"France's policy," Lord Rimberly said,
"is, therefore, according to Lord Salis
bury, that of Great Britain and is based
upon the maintenance of the integrity of
the Ottoman empire."
Sir William Harconrr, Chancellor of the
Exchequer in the late Rosebery Cabinet,
said of Lord Salisbury's statement that
such a disgraceful, abject answer had
never b-fore been given by a British Min
ister to a British Parliament. The nation,
be said, had never been exposed to a
greater humiliation than it is now, when
it is chained and coerced by the menace
of wars in which it has no concern to ab
stain from doini: what it is under the
highest obligations of honor to do and
compelled to do what its conscience con
demns.
Sir William denounced the integrity of
the Ottoman Empire as a sham, every
break in which, he declared, was a benefit
to mankind, and paid a tribute to Greece
for the step* she had taken while the con
cert of the poweis held aloof from rescu
ing the Cretans from the heel of the Turk.
It was this brave champion that the Brit
ish nation was bidden in the name of
Ottoman integrity to nourish.
â¢â¢Is it not time," asked Sir William,
"that. the British people take a rtand and
demand to know what are the limits of
British submission and co-operation in
this ahti-crusaue?"
He defended the "fair offers" made by
the GreeK Government in its reply to the
ultimatum of the powers, to which, he
said, the only answer was that the block
ade of the ports of Greece would be en
forced.
None knew, Bir William declared, what
a day might bring forth, but he prayed
that tue shame of a great free nation
being made an unwilling partner in an
odious policy might yet be averted.
Tl;e speech, which was throughout re
ceived with enthusiastic cheers, is consid
ered by far the most telling utterance on
the subject yet made.

OPINIONS OF THE
STAY-AT-HOMES
Continued from Iburth Page.
similar mistake. The bitter thing about
a tighter in the theatrical business is that
if he loses his reputation to the ring be
is ruined in bu siness as an actor.
Joseph Riordan â I was with the loser in
sympathy and in betting. I'm Forry he
couldn't win. The pitcher that goes off
to the well mint get cracked at last, and
this was Jirnmv's day of fate. Fits is a
good man, but it is just possible that he
hasn't whipped Corbett for keen. They
will meet again, and then we shall see
what will come of it. I am still for Jim
Cc-bett.
Joseph Windrow â The trouble with
Cor Dett is that he hasn't steam enough
bphind his blows. He hit Fiiz-itnnicns
enoueh <imes to knock him out half a
dozen t'mes if his ritaH.lT hadn't been
gone. B'>b couldn't hit him at all in tho
early stages of the came, but he just wore
Jim out, and then had it ::11 his own way.
Corbett wai not in any such condition as
he was when lie met Sullivan, and ho
must have known it. HÂ» might get into
good condition aeain, but it will take a
longtime. He is thÂ« cleverest man who
ever Tpnt into a ring; and when he gets
his strength back, nobody has any busi
ness tiring to beat him.
WÂ« J. Heaney â My pool tickets are not
worth keet'ing. I tbocebt Corbett wns
all right for a winning, but he got left.
Well.'tnat is the way of the world. You
can't always guess how far a frog can
jump from the way he looks.
E. J. Jackson â The b^st man won.
That's all I have to any. I thought Cor
bptt could "do" him, but t c result con
vinced me that I was wrong. Good living
is a good thine for some folks, but it
will not do for a pugi ; ist if he expects to
hold his place in the ring.
O. C. Lewis â My opionion from the day
the mpn were matched was that Fiizsim
mons h*d an easy garhe, and I expected
him to win in seven or eight rounds â not
fourteen. I baÂ°Â«Â»d my opinion on the
showing that Fitz mule a"ainst Sniior
Sharkey as compared with drbett's show
ing against the same man. My b?t was
down on the winner nil right.
O^car Tolleâ The result shows that a
man must take care o' himself. Corbett
has indulged in too much dissipation. He
was my choice before the battle and
-howed his superiority up to the eighth
round, according to the reports I have
ueen. If his stamina had not been im
paired hp would have won as he did be
fore yn I iv in, who was a heavier hliter
'han Fitzsimmons ever pretended to be.
Fitz'inimnn? is known to be a man of
steady habits and that told in his favor,
if they have a re'urn fighi and Corhett
takes care of himself Corbett can win. He
wiH be mv choice.
"William A. D?ane â Fitz was my man
ri<rht alonsr. but I didn't pet as much down
on him as I ought to have done. After I
saw him punch Sharbev it was clear t'> my
mind that he could defeat Corbett. You
sea it is pretty hard for anybody to knock
out Sharkey with anything lÂ»ss than a
meat-ax, bnt Fitz^immons hndled him
with the grea'ejtense. CorbÂ°tt announced
himself in prime condition. He wrote that
over his own signature, and so I suppose
we must accent that as the truth, though
his bad temper for the last three ' f ays of
his training con'radicted that assumption
to a certain desree. In the light of the
result it seems that he was somewhat ap
prehensiv*. He must bay felt some weak
ness in himself that lie did not acknowl
edge, and so naturaliy dreaded the meet
ing. His miseivings proved "rophetic. A
little t legram in the mornincr "npers from
Dallas, Texas, intimated that Dan Stuart'o
friÂ»nds were betting on Fi'z. That brief
hint was enouch for quie a nnraher of the
knowing one?, and they gathered in several
be(s between breakfast-time and the hour
for the men to enter the ring. I'm â¢â¢orry
for Jim. I'd rather havp seen him win, so
far as my personal feelings were con
cerned, but I conjdn't rfford to let senti
ment get away with my judgment when it
came to buying dools.
V. F. Northrup â I expected Fitz to win
because he is a harder man than Jim.
The expierence of Corbett has been more
in the hne of boxing, whi'e Bob has been
doing hard fighting all the timÂ°. If they
were sparring for points Corbett wou'd be
Di 7 choice, but he is not in the same cas*
with Fitz*immons as a fighter. One thing
you may put down a-> troe, and that is
that this fight was on the square. It was
for blood and the better man won. I con
sider Bob Fiiz immons the best ring
fighterin the world to-day.
Judge Carroll Cookâ The result did not
surprise me. I considered Corbett the
better boxer for a short contest, but be
lieved that he would lose if it lasted more
than rive round' 1 . From the reports I
judge that Fitziimmon3 fell short ao long
as they stood off, but when they got to
gether at close range Corbett was no
match for him. I think Filzsmmons is
too strong for Corbett. The pace he has
been going was too much for him. In re
ply to your suggestion concerning the
granting of a new trial, I can see no reason
why there should be a reversal of the
verdict in that event.
Captain Wittman â I am not a bit sur
prised at the result after having seen both
men fitrht with Bharkey. If I had been a
bettinir man, which I am not, I would
have laid all the money I was posses-ed of
on Fi'zsimmons. I have been asked by
several people during the past few weeks
as to what I thought of the fighters, and I
invariably told them that in my opinion
Fitzsiromons wou d win.
Detective Crockett â I have always been
a great admirer of Corbett, but now I
think that Fitzsimmons is the greatest
fighter in the world. Hp defeated all the
nmldle-weighis and then he gets into the
heavy-weL'ht class and defeats them all.
I believe he couid beat Sharkey In one
round. The blow that settled Corbett was
the same blow he gave Sharkey, when he
knocked him out, and there was no foul
about it.
Colonel W. P. Sullivan, Mayor Thelan's
secretaryâ l am not surprised nt the re
sult. Corbett his led a fast life, and it
has told on him, a-j it does on all
fighters.
George McCourt, prominent member of
the Olympic Clubâ l don't think that Jim
coul'l have been in the condition he wns
reported to be. I thought he would win.
justice of the Pvace G. C. Gro^zinger â I
thought Fiiz would Â«in ail aiong. I
am not sorry for Corbettâ he called San
Francisco a jay town.
Charles Welch, secretary of the Board of
Education â I thought it would be Fitz.
Tlie stories of the Jife Corbett has lea are
ei'.ou h to show that he could not stand a
hard light.
Sheriff R. I. Whelan â I was surprised at
the result. I thought that Fiizsimmons
was the best stayer, but I figured that he
â would not be abl â  to hit Corbett.
John A. Russell, clerk of the Board of
Supervisorsâ l am somewhat surpr sed at
tbe result. D >n't know much about fight
ers, but from the newspaper accounts it
looked like a sure thing for Corbett.
Dr. Frank T. Fnz-ibbonâ l think the
decision was right and that Fiizsimmons
is a stronger man physically than Coroett,
therefore the one counterbalances the
belter science of the other. He has
wonderful endurance and reserve force*.
Corbett appeared to be nervous from
mental worry, which was against htm, ana
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MARCH 18, 1897.
his hysterical condition after the fight
corroborates ibis idea.
OAKLAND, ( al., March 17.âEvery
body in town has an opinion on the fight.
Most of them, however, are satisfied and
declare that the result is just what they
expected. Herd are a few of the opinions
of people who took some interest in the
result:
Judge J. J. Allenâ l am not surprised.
Both men are cood fighters and one is
i'ound to get an opportunity for a good
blow sooner or later.
Judge A. L. Frick â I am disappointed.
There is no doubt it was a great content,
but 1 thought Corbett would win. I guess
he met more tl:an Lis matcti.
City Expert Alexanderâ l wagered on
twenty-one rounds and Fitzsimmons a
winner. He wound up too quickly.
Herman Tubbsâ l am surprised, as I ex
pected Corbett would win. Fiizsimmons
is evidently the better man, judging by the
force of his blows.
Supervisor Church â Just as I expected.
Corbett has been a back number, and
nothing but his tactics and quickness en
abled him to stand up as long as he did.
Fitzsimmons strikes like a sledge-
hammer.
County Clerk Jordan â Yesterday I pre
dicted that Fit* wou d win in fourteen
rounds. I was not mistaken. I believe
that Corbett cannot stand Fitzsimmons'
blows, although he is quicKer. Fitz has
boasted all along thai if he could get one
good hit he would want no more. The
opportunity came and the affair ended.
Oliver Moroseo â I still believ Cor bett
is t lie better man. I made him my choice.
The fignt has demonstrated that there
are some good gues*ers in Oakland.
Last night the Tribune canvassed the
opinion of officials and sporting men and
now that the result is known the predic
t.ons are of double interest. Some of
them are as follows:
Editor E. L. Marshall â Fitzsimmons,
fifteen rounds.
City Attorney J. K. Peirsolâ Corbett in
fifteen rounds.
Fred Tuompson â Fitzsimmons, fifteen

CORBETT SLIPS HOME.
Hastens by Special Train to the
Condoling Quietude of His
Family Circle.
The defeated champion reached this
City last nigbt at 10 o'clock and his home
coming was lonely, unheralded and in
glorious.
lie hastened from Carson by special
train arriving here with his father, P. J.
Corbett, who was the only one of his
close friends who came with him. There
were no crowds to meet him on his ar
rival, no hailing of the chief, no festivities
of a triumphal hour.
Father and son wheeled away from the
ferry in a lonely hack to the St. Nicholas
HÂ»tel, and unostentatiously hastened up.
stairs to the rooms where Mrs. Corbett
awaited her husband. Not a dozen knew
of his arrival by that time, though the
news quickly spread withont exciting
creat interest. After a little delay the
fattier drove to the family home, a few
blocks away on Hayes street, and brought
down to the hotel Corbett's mother and
sstor, who joined the It t tie family gath
ing in Jim's rooms.
Callers were not many, and most of the
few cards sent up brought back the word
that Corbett had gjne to Ded and begged
to be excused until the next day.
When he greeted a Call reporter he did
so smilingly, and bis face displayed not a
scratch. There was a redness on one of
his cheeks as the only visible evidence of
his battle, and his spirits seemed bravely
forced to buoyancy.
'I don't look as though I was seriously
injured, do I?" he said in denying a
rumor that a b.oo J vessel in his face had
been ruptured, and he added the informa
tion that since hit return the only treat
ment he had given his injuries was an
application of a simple lotion to his cheek.
"It was something that would hap; en
but once in a thousand times," he said in
addition to a declination to discuss the
battle at length. "As everybody at the'
ring knows, 1 had FUzsimraons all but
defeated at the last round, and the knock
out blow came just as 1 was preparing for
a finishing blow myself.
"I was just drawing in my breath for a
wind-up drive when Fitz's blow landed on
the pit of my stomach. It came at the
in-taut in my breathing w. en it was
most telling and the one over my neart
that followed added to the effect and did
the work."
"It was a fluke," was the explanation of
Mr. Corbett Sr., "Jim was too confident,
I guess, and Fitzsimmons happened to
lind a lucky ODening just in time to save
himself. It wouldn't happen again in a
thousand years."
So quietly did the Corbetts retire to pri
vate gloom and co brief and brave were
the explanations afforded on the evening
of defeat. Jim's future is not yet outlined.
Fitz Will Take a Rest.
CARSON, Nev., March 17.â Fitz im
mons was seen after the battle, and when
spoken to a broad "didn't- I-tell-you-so"
smile illuminated bis face. "Well, boys,"
said the champion, "I got there in good
shape. I did not look lik â  a man who
was afraid to meet Corbett in a ring, and
if I remember right. I don't think that
any person had a rope around my neck to
drag me in either. Oh, well, what's the
use of talking about it. It's about time I
did get a square deal, and I had to come
to Carson for it. Corbett is a clever iel
low."
A friend asked him if be was hurt
any, and Fitz replied tbat the only pain
he felt was fiom the broken ringer of bis
rij?ht band. He said that Corbeti's Diowa
were noi effective enough to do much
damage, and that he had only a cut lip to
show for it. "I will take a rest now,"
said Fitz, "and let those other fellows pet
in and scrap among themselves., for
awhile."

FITZSIMMONS' KING RECORD.
Robert Fitzsimmons was born in Corn
wall,' England, June 14, 1862. He stands
5 feet 11-jÂ£ inches in his blocking feet. He
established a reputation for himself by
knocking out Herbert Slade, the "Maori."
He knocked out many clever fighters in
Australia, and came to this country.
Since the day Fitzsimmons landed here
the American public has been interested
in his doings in the ring. His record, as
told by himself, is as follows:
"My first appearance in the ring was at
Jem Mace's amateur boxing tournament
at Tiraarn, New Zealand, twelve years ago.
M.-.co was making a tour ol the colonies
then. I sue ceded in knocking out lour
men that night, winning the amateur
championship of New Zealand and a gold
watch. Tne next year Mace visited U3
and gave another tournament. I then
knocked out five men in one night. After
defeating the five men I put on the gloves
with Herbert Slade, and to the surprise of
everybody, I bested him.
"1 next fought Arthur Cooper under
London prize-ring rujes at Ximamo, de
feating him in three rounds. Thsn came
my fights with 'Jack' Murphy and 'Jim'
Crawford, both of which were fought
under the London prize-ring rules. I de
feated the former in four and the latter in
three rounds, knocking them both out.
After this I left New Z aland and went to
Sydney, sparrine for tne first time there
at Larry Foley's Athletic Hall, where I
defeated Brawsmead, a heavy-weight, in
two munds. He weighed 170 pounds to
my 148. I next defeated 'Jack' Greentree.
a middle-weight, at Foley's in three
rounds. 'Dick' Sandal, who, after I left
New Zealand, got to be an amateur cham
pion, was the next one who wanted to
meet me. I defeated him in four rounds.
Then I defeated 'BIT Slaviu. I then
fought Enger, who fought a draw with
Starlight, the colored miadle-weightcbaru
pion of Australia. I then defeated Con
way, the champion of Ballarat, in three
rounds. My next battle of importance
was with 'Dick' Ellis. 1 beat him in three
rounds.
"I next fought 'Jim' Hall, the middle
weight cnaiupionof Australia and Queens
land. I beat him in five rounds, and he
afterward beat me, as I did not try to win.
Then I fought Starlight, kn< ckuig him
out in nine rounds. My last fipht. in Aus
iralia was with Professor West, a heavy
weight. 1 Knocked him out in two min
utes. Coming 10 San Francisco I cot on a
match wltn 'Bill' McCarthy. I knocked
him out in nine rounds. I then met Ar
thur Upham. We fought before the An
tridon Club of New Orleans, and I de
feated him in ny rounds."
Fitzsimmons was then matched to i'mht
"Jack" Dempsey for the middle-weicht
championship of the world. Tne fight
took place before the O ympic Club of
New Orleans on January 14, 1891, and
"Fiiz" knocked out the "Nmparoil" in
thirteen rounds. On March- 2, 1892,
"Fitz" defeated Peter Maher in twelve
rounds before tne Olympic Club of New
Orleans. A year later, in the arena of
ihe Crescent City Athletic Club, Fitzsim
mons knocked out "Jim" Hall in four
rounds. His next battle was wuh "Joe"
Choynski; it took place in Boston on
June 18, 1894. Fitzsimmona won. but the
referee rei used to credit him with a vic
tory and declared the bout a draw. Fitz
simmons then met "Dan" Creedon of
Australia. The scene ot the mill was the
arena of the Olympic Clnb of New Orleans
and the date September 26, 1894. "Fitz"
won after one minute and forty seconds
of tightine, in tho second round. Then
he met Peter Maher in Texas and knocked
the Irishman out in four and a quarter
rounds. He then went to England and
gave exhibitions in the cities.' His last
mutch of note was against Turn Sharkey,
and he lost the fight on a foul, according
to Referee Earp. Greatest of all is his vic
tory over Corbett at Carson yesterday.

June 28, 1890, i. c knocked Upham out in

In view of *he great battle whica will
take place at Carson n >xt Wednesday for
the heavyweight championship of the
world, be.weon Corbett and Fuzsimmons,
the following culling from a Philadeiph a
paper, published on the day after ijie
Dempsey and Fitzsinimons fiijht, will be
found interesting reading at this time. It
says:
Bob Fitzsimmons, the tall New Z^a
lander, in a single fi^ht has leaped in U> the
front rank, gaming tue title of middle
weight champion and winning $12,000.
He whipped D^mpsey in thirteen rounds,
before 4500 men from ail parts ot the
country, in the rooms of the Olympic
Athleuc Club.
Dempsey was outclassed from the start.
The city is ringing with Fitzsimmons'
praises to-day, such good judges as Frank
Stevenson, Jim Corbett, Billy Meyer,
Parsou Davies and Others of like note de
claring him nothing short of a ''phenome
non," atrd vo.cing the opinion that a
creat many of the heavy we. ghts have no
business with him. He demonstrated h^s
wonderful tistic ability to the satisfaction
of everybody when he tieleated the
acknowledged king of his class for so
many years with such astounding ease.
Dempsey never had the faintest glimmer
of a hope of defeating the big blacksmith
from the moment time was called lor the
third round, or the hrst round either lor
that matter, as Fitzsimmons forced the
pace and drove his inr.n before him with
irresistible force. Dempsey landed often
enough to win a dozen fights, but the An
tipodean walked rieht over the Nonpareil
ana struck him two blows for the one re
ceived in return. His reach was some
thing wonderful and uij blows were full of
steam.
Dempsey's seconds are censured to-day
for sending their man up lilce a beef to the
slaughter when he had no chance of wih
ninsf, but this criticism is tiarsn, as they
were in favor of throwing up the sponge.
It was Demps-\v himself who insisted on
fighting on, his exhibition of gameness be
ing such that H will never be forgotten by
those prtsint. When he could scarcely
raise hi* t,ands to a level with his chest
Fitzsimmons beggei him to stop and said
repeatedly:
"I don't want to strike you, Jack."
"Weil, I would punch you if I could,"
was Dempsey's only reply.
The Southern and Western contingent
have won very heavily over the mill, but
the Northern and Eastern sports will have
to walk home.
He was attended by a physician in his
dressing-room after the tight. He was a
sorry spectacle as be lay back with closed
eyes. His uose is broken. His eyes are
very black to-day.
The Nonpareil is heartbroken and will
say nothing. Fitzsimmons will return to
Bay St. Louis to-day to his wife and child.
The purse of $12,000 was the largest ever
before offered in a glove contest, and the
receipts also were the largest on record,
exceeding $35,000. These facts alone
stamped the occasion as a must notable
one.
The match between the two men was
suggested to the management of the
o.yiui'le Club immediately after the fight
between James Can oil and Andy Bowen
in October. T.at affair was so success
fully managed that it gave the Olympic
Club a wide reputation, ar.d oilers pottred
in upon it from pugilist! who were
anxious to measure strength and skill in
its arena.
Robert Fitzsimmons had shown himself
such a shifty tighter in his battle with
Upbam in tnis city last summer that the
O ympic members were anxious to give
him an opportunity to meet a man in his
class. Upon looking over the field it was
decided ihat Jack Dempsey was the only
man who could be matches against the
New Z-alander upon equal terms. Ac
cordingly negotiations were opened with
Dempsey.
fcThe Puritan Club of Long Island also
entered the field and active competi
tion between the organizations resulted in
a hnal offer of a purse of $12,0<)0 by the
Olympic. It is prooable tuat the Puritan
Club would have offered still larger in
ducements htd it not been for the stand
taken by Fitzsimmons. He â¢ relused to
fight Dempsey in the arena of the Puritan
Club on any terms, assigning au a reason
that he did not think that he could get
fair play there. So the Olympic Club
secured the match.
ThÂ« agreement signed by Dempsey for
himself and Carroll for Fitzsimmutid set
forth that they should weigh not more
than 154 pounds at the rings! le five
minutes before the call of time and that
the $12,000 pur^e snould bÂ«Â» dividedâsll,
--000 to tue winner and $1000 to the loser.
As a guarantee of the good faith ot the
pugilists they were required to deposit a
forfeit of $1000 each. Tne gloves used were
the five-ounce s ze and the Queensberry

THE LEAHI BREAKING UP.
She Is Falling Off the Reef
Where She Was
Wrecked.
Much of Her Gear and Ma
chinery Has Been
Saved.
i
The Australia, which arrived yesterday,
brought up from Honolulu Frai:k San
ders, the mate of the Hawaiian bark Leahi
that was wrecked on February 17 at the
entrance to Kahului harbor. Sanders
says that the vessel has gone on her beam
ends and is a total loss, but that before
she eot into that position about $2000
worth of cargo, rigging and machinery
were taken out of her.
Gus Spreckels bought the hull for $650,
and FU-ceeded in savins? a donkey engine
worth $1000, 200 tons of coal, anchors,
chains, npging and spars. There are still
650 tons of coal in the hulk.
Spreckels hired Sanders to superintend
the wrecking of the vessel and he re
mained with her until she heeled over
toward deep water in such a position as
to b- <tangerous.
The Leahi, drawing 18 feet, struck on a
ledge covered by 25 feet of water while a
heavy sea was running.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia got in on t<me yesterday, while tne
Pacific Mail Company's Peru, wnieh
sailed from the same port, Honolulu, was
twenty-seven hours late.
The Mail Company's City of Sydney
alfo got in from Central American ports.
AH three steamers report unusually
heavy northwest weather, but the
Oceanic*! boat was the only one of the
trio that managed to get here on time.
Tne City of Sydney had iwo days of un
usually heavy weather: her decks were
washed aeain and again, and Captain
Johnston was almost carr.eu out oi his
room.
No one aboard knew anything about
the death of Ezeta, but said ihat when the
Sydney left Panama he was living on
the fat of the land.
Besides the three steamer?, the bark
Olympic got in from Philadelphia, the
Keniiworth from New York, the Sierrn
Cadena ,rom Car 'iff, and the Alden Besse
from Hawaii. The Olympic came in
short-handed, as many of tho crew de
ser ed at the last moment.
The vessel made a quick ran neverthe
less, and with the exception of the u-ual
heavy weather rounding the Horn
toe passage was a pleasant one up
to the time she ran down the Sunol. The
Keniiworth had a pleasant passage
throughout.
The Sierra Cadena after leaving Cardiff
ran into a *torm. One sea broke nboard
which severely injured several of
the vessel's crew and broke the mate's
h ph. Tne captain had to put into Fal
mouth for repairs and to shjp men to re
plnre the injured. After leaving Fal
mouih ail went well nntil the northwester
mm* struck on this coast and the vessel
was blown out to sea. No damage was
done, and the skipper says "all's well that
ends well.'*
T. C. Smith, the popular purser of the
steamer Mariposa, leaves to-day for
Ireland on a well-earned vacation. His
mother is getting alon in years and he
wants to see her once more before she
dies. HiÂ« place will be taken by N. C.
Walton Jr., the efficient freight clerk for
the Oceanic Company at Pacific-street
wharf, ami William Daley, who was time
keeper, will take Mr. Walton's place.
The railway mail clerks went around
the bay on the big ferry steamer Ukiah
yesterday. All the points of interest were
visited and the visitors returned to their
hoteN at 3p m., thoroughly satisfied that
San Francisco has the finest port in the
United States.

BLAZE ON EDDY STREET
Property Valued at Over $10,000
Consumed in a Short
Time.
The Flames Originated in a Peculiar
Wayâ Tenants Suffer Loss by
Smoke and Water.
Shortly before noon yesterday a fire
broke oat in the dressmaking and reno
vating establishment of W. N. Swasey,
142 Eddy street, and damaged the build
ing in which the store is located to the
extent of $10,000. An alarm was Bounded
through box 96, but by the time the
engines arrived the fire was under such
headway that a second alarm had to be
turned in.
The tire had its origin in a peculiar way.
J. Monahan, one of the tailors in the era
ploy oi Swasey, was cleaning a vest with
benzine, when a match secreted in one of
the pockets of the garment ignited. In
stantly the garment was in a blaze, and a
moment later the inflammable material
in the vicinity was in flames. The worK
men had barely time to escape with their
lives, for in two minutes more the in
terior of the workshop was a seething fur
nace.
Jhe fire was confined to the rear portion
of the block. The firemen worked expe
ditiously and succeeded in keeping the
blaze within narrow limits. Meanwhile
the flats over the stores were deluged with
water, the damage being largely confined
to this source.
Miss Sophie Hill, occupying the flat at
No. 138, suffered a loss of $500 to furniture
and carpets, covered by insurance.
Mrs. Augusta Cash, a dressmaker at
No. 140, lost several sewing-machines and
a quantity of dresses which were ready
for delivery. In addition to this her
household goods were greatly damaged.
Her loss will reach $750. No insurance.
W. N. Swasey, the tailor at No. 142,
states that his loss will amount to $1000,
partly insured. He was not present when
the lire broke out, and he could give n
explanation as to its origin.
Sam Hop & Co., dealers in ladies' and
children's underwear, suffered consider
able damage by ssnoke and water. They
estimate their loss at $750. covered by in
surance.
The fiats numbered 146 and 148 were
slightly damaged, the loss footing up
about $300. Mrs. Tate, who keeps a deli
cacy-store at 150, was damaged to the ex
tent of $1000. Her kitchen, filled with
utensils and a variety of goods, was totally
destroyed. She carries insurance to the
amount of $1500.
N. Nev, dealer in tailors' trimmings,
dressmaking supplies, etc, at 152, states
that his stock, worth $7000, is almost
ruined. The place was baaly torn up and
the rear part totally destroyed. His in
surance is $3500.
Mrs. Samuel S. Sample, at 154, and
Harry Lask at 156. suffered heavy losses.
Both flats were flooded with water and
the rear portions were burned away. It
is estimated that their loss will be $700
each.
A. C. Drewitz, a druggist at No. 158, suf
fered slight damage. He was sick abed at
the time the a. arm was turned in, and was
awa&ened just in time to escape the fi.-tmes.
His room on the upper floor was almost
gutted. His loss will not exced $500.
Captain Coni6tock estimates the total
los- at about $10,000. Tbe fire was an ob
stinate one, and had it not been for the
good worit of tbe laddies the whole block
might have been destroyed.

Fitzilmmon* Was Not Challenged.
Judge Cofley startled Attorneys Mhoon and
Goodfellow yesterday afternoon by demand
ing. "Well, gentlemen, does either of you
wish to challenge Mr. Fitzsimmons ?"
The name of Patriot Fitzslmmons had just
been called as a juror in the case of A. W. Reay
against George Heazleton, administrator of
the Xreadwell estate.
Mr. F'.tzsimmons stood in the jury-box await

that they did not care to challenge him, and
he was sworn to try the cause amid the ap

A Plan to Build a Home and to Care

Work.
The organized unemployed have de
rided to incorporate. The capital stock
of their ambitious prospective "Home
and Help Supply Association" has been
modestly placed at $1,000,000. The idea is
to build a home for those out of work.
Taylor Rogers drew up the articles that
were finally adopted last night with but
two dissenting votes among over 200 dol
larless men.
The articles provide for a home in this
City and permit the exercise of about
every corporate function imaginable in
connection with the very suggestive move
adopted for the organization.
Stiares have been modestly placed at $1
each, with no takers yet. But the organi
zation has on hand now $17Â£ vlt had $60
more two days ago, but had to buy pro
visions.
The directors are: Leffingwell, Merrill,
Wright, Munn, Colioby, Miller and Ryan.
The articles will be filed at once and at
a cost of $15.
Yesterday only eighty-five men pre
sented themselves for work on the boule
vard. They straggled out, many of them
arriving over an hour late. At noon hot
soup in plentiful quantities was supplied
to the workers by the superintendent of
the Almshouse. It will be furnished
every day, as Messrs. Ellert and Devany
have so arranged.
The fund has reached the sum of
$7868 50, almost nothing being contributed
yesterday.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 1897.
MRS. HINCKLEY HAS
ANOTHER BIG SUIT
She Agreed to Buy Mrs.
Hall McAllister's
Miramonte.
For That Beautiful Property She
Promised to Pay
$95.000
Now the Heir to Thomas H. Blythe's
Millions Wishes to Repudiate
Her Bargain.
i
Florence Blythe Hlnckley inherited a
goodly snare of litigation with the estate
that was accorded to her as the heir of the
late Thomas Blythe, and now she seems
to have acquired a new lot of legal trouble
on her own account, as a suit has been
filed to compel her to buy the "Mira
monte" property in Marin County, for
merly owned by the eemmet lawyer, Hall
McAllister, now dead, and to pay $95,000
for the same.
The plaintiffs nnmed in the complaint
are Marion Wagner and Elliott McAl
lister an trustee for Marion Wagner, indi
vidually, Edith McAllister Newlands,
Hall McAllister Jr. and Eva McAllister.
The story as told in the complaint is to
the effect that on the 18th of January,
1892, and at the time of the execution and
delivery of the written agreement of sale,
Louise MÂ«Allister, widow of Hall McAl
lister, both now dead, was the owner of
the property described as Miramonte;
that an agreement was entered into by
Mrs. McAllister and the defendant, Flor
ence Hinctley Blythe (the^n Florence
Blythe), whereby Mrs. McAllister agreed
to sell to Mr?. Hinckley the entire Mira
ruon c property for $95,0U0.
Mrs. Hinclcley in the agreement prom
ised to pay within six months from t tie
date of the final judgment of the court
confirming Mrs. iiinckiey in her right to
the possession of Thomas H. Blythe's
estate. Before her death in 1896 Mrs. Mc-
Allister deeded the Miramonte property
in trust to her children, with the under
standing and instruction that the condi
tions of the agreement with Mrs. Hinck
ley should be carried out.
Prior to March 2, 1897, more than six
months had elapsed alter the final decision
rendered in the Blythe estate, and the
second day of March the heirs of Mrs.
McAllister made a formal tender in writ
ing to Mr*. Hinckley offering to carry out
the provisions of the original contract, and
demanded she should keep her promise,
but she refused to pay the $95,000 or to
carry out her agreement In any way, noti
fying the puiiiiiiffs in writing that she did
not intend then or at any time to carry
out her agreement in that regard.
For this reason the plaintiffs demand
judgment against Mrs. Hinckley to com
pel ncr to specific performance of her con
tract, and they offer to give her a deed to
the property on payment of the $95,000.
ST, PATRICK'S DAY,
Continued from Seventh Page.
to attend the St. Patrick's banquet In London,
you will not be surprised to hear thai I cannot
accept ihecourteouÃ and kindly invitation of
the Knights of St. Patrick in San Francisco.
But I am none the less pleasedâ none the less
proudâ to have received that invitation. I
have many genial personal memories of San
Francisco, ana am always living in the hope
of seeing it again.
Do not be too much discouraged about the
dissensions in the Irish National party. I de
plore them, and my memory goes back to the
days when we were nil siauding together, side
by side, in front of ihe euemy as comraaeÃ and
as brothers. But the dissensions are personal
rather than political, and tnere is not a single
question vital to the interests of Ireland on
which all Nationalist members would not b:
compelled to vote in the same division lobby.
1 am sorry I cannot attend your banquet,
but as our national poet, Thomas Moore, says:
"My soul, happy friends, shall be with you
that night." With best wishes, very truly
yours. Justin McCarthy,
To John Mulhern, Esq.
Other letters were received from Arch
bishop Riordan, Senators Septien M.
White and GeoriÂ»e M. Per-kim, Congress
man Maguire; D. R. McNeil 1, chief of the
Caledonian Society ; Thomas Price of the
Cambrian Society and W. 8 Burnett.
Archbishop Riordan's letter was to the
following effect:
Corresponding Secretary, Knights of St. Pat
rickâ Dear Sir: 1 beg leave to acknowledge
with thanks your invitation to banquet
ou St. Patrick's day. While unable to
be present, I am deeply interested in all
such gatherings since they tend to
strengthen the attachment of our people to
the traditions of the land irom which so many
of them came, and at the same time be the oc
casion of expressing their heartfelt loyalty to
the institutions under which they live.
Wishing the Knights of St. Patrick a * cry
pleasant reunion, 1 remain, sincerely yours,
P. W. Riordan,
Archbishop of San Francisco.
Colonel Thomas F. Barry responded to
the toast of "The Day We Celebrate."
Joseph Hawortb, the well-known actor,
recently the leading member of Modjes
ka's company, recited "bhamus O'Brien"
in superb style and received an ovation.
James R. Kelly acknowledged the toast
of "The United states of America* in a
scholarly and thoughtful speech, in which
he ascribed the liberty ot the American
people to their reverence for law.
The remaining toasts were as follows:
"The Heroes and Martyrs of Ireland,"
eloquently acknowledged by R. 0. O'Con
nor; "The City of San Francisco," ac
knowledged by Mayor Phelan, and "Our
Kindred Societies," acknowledged by D.
R. McNeill.
Knights of the
Red Branch BalL
Many hundred couples ushered out St.
Patrick's day at the twenty>eignth anni
versary ball of the Irish Nationalists of
San Francisco, which was given under the
auspices of the Knights of the Red Branch
at Odd Fellows' Hall last evening.
The dance commenced shortly after 9
o'clock and it was not until lonjc after
midnight before the last weary couple,
tired of the mazes of the waltz, left the
hall.
The Irish Nationalists were determined,
notwithstanding the fact that they were
forced to accept a hall smaller than was
wished for, to make the ball a success,
and a success it was, both socially and
financially.
An Enthusiastic Throng
at the Pavilion.
There was a vast concourse of enthusi
astic devotees of St. Patrick's day at the
Mechanics' Pavilion in the evening. Esti
mates placed the number present at
14,000, and the number was composed of a
jolly, good-humored crowd withal.
Certainly the entertainment provided
was calculated to put the audience in the
nigbest spirits. Rarely, if ever, has there
been presented in this City such a choice
collection of Hibernian and American
scenes as that shown on the large screen
at the west end of the hall, varied by ap
propriate music.
The stereopticon exhibition, the full
programme of which baa been published
in The Call, passed off trith great suc
cess, and Roncovieri's American Concert
band (Alfred Roncovieri, director) and
the grand chorns under the direction of
Professor John W. McKenzie, carried the
immense house by storm. "God Save
Ireland" by the chorus was specially ad
mired.
The successful celebration was held
under the auspices of the following
officers of the convention : John Mulbern,
president; George E. Gallagher, vice
president; J. J. Moran, recording secre
tary; P. D. Multaney, financial secretary;
P. H. Flynn, chairman of finance com
mittee; Jeremiah Deasy, treasurer.
PUTTING HOENS ON A VIPEB.
Cerastes Viper With False "Horns"
I'indg Its Way Into a Collection.
The "painted sparrow" trick, by which
simple peop'e are inveigled into buying a
worthless bird in the belief that they are
purchasing a rare foreign songster, is well
known. It is, perhaps, the most flagrant
example practiced in this country of the
art of preparing animals for sale so that
they may appear other than they are.
Strange stories are also told of the misdi
rected ingenuityâ sometimes accompanied
by cruelty â employed in "faking" animals
for exhibition in order to deceive the
jud es and secure for the birds or beasts
exhibited priz-s to which, on their merits,
they would not be entitled.
But all the stories of "faked" birds,
dogs and cats fade into insignificance
when compared with the sublime audac
ity of tie genius who fitted one of tne
cerastes vipers, now in the reptile-house
of the Zooioeical Gardens, Regents Park,
with a pair of artificial "horns."
It is well known that in the males â and
also in some female: â of this deadly Afri
can snake there is, a little above the eye,
a horn-like process covered with sc-ales,
which accounts lor their popular name of
" horned vipers." Presumably, native
collectors obtain a high price for these
reptiles when the "horns" are present
than is paid by the dealers for specimens
without these adornment!-, for the story
is current that art has ofcen covered the
deficiencies of nature, and supplied horns
to reptiles which would otherwise have
been hornless.
One of the horned vinors now in the
Zoological Gardens shows that there is
some foundation for the tale. Two smalt
spines, perhaps those of a hedgehog or the
tips of porcupine quills, have been deftly
inserted in the skin ot the venomous rep
tile in the place where the true "horns"
ought to be. The fraud must have been
attended with considerable danser to the
perpetrator. It could have been no easy
matter to hold a venomous snake, to
make two incisions in the skin and to in
sert the spines therein. It was done prob
ably while the peck of the vipor was held
between ths index finger and tne thumb
of the left hand, thus leaving the _ right
band free for the insertion of the spines.
Directly the attention of the visitor is
drawn to the fact by the keeper of the
reptile-house, the difference between the
true and lal?e "horns" is so startling that
one is surprised that the fraud escaped
detection for a moment. As may be seen
from other specimens in the same case,
the true horns harmonize with the color
ing of the scales of the neati, and bend
backward in a â¢_ entle curve; while the
false ones show dark ami light bands,
stand up almost vertically from the head
and slope slightly outward from base to
tip. It is said that such frauds are by no
means rare. This-, .however, is probably
the first instance of a cerastes viper fitted
with false "horns" having found its way
into the zoological collection of a learned
society. â London Standard.
WELLINGTON'S PAMOUS GHAEGEB
The English General â â ode Copenhagen
at the Battle of Waterloo.
At 4 o'clock on the morning of the day
that Wellington defeated Napoleon he
mounted his celebrated charger, Copen
hagen, and remained in the saddle for
eight hours. Copenhagen was a powerful
chestnut, a grandson of Eclipse, the
famous English racehorse, and cost the
Duke in 1813 400 guineas. When the
battle of Waterloo was won, June 18, 1815,
and Wellington had held his historic in
terview with Blucher the Duke dis
mounted about 10 o'clock. As Copen
hagen was led nway by the groom he
playfully threw out his heels as s good
night salutation to his victorious master.
The lie! d marshal's last act before leaving
Sirathfaeld Saye on a brief absence^ a few
days before Copenhagen's death, was to
walk out to the paddock to pat his Water
loo charger and give him some chololate
creams or other similar dainties, of which
no was inordinately fond.
For a dozen or more years before he
died Copenhagen was only twice surrepti
tiously saddled by the Duke's eldest son,
but led the easy, comfortable career of a
wÂ«*ll-pensioned veteran who had retired
from the activities of life. The second
Duke of Wellington, who died in 1884,
erected two monuments on the grounds
of Strathneld Raye, that line estate pre
sented to the "Iron Duke" by the British
Government for a day's work at Watorloo.
One of these, a superb irutrDle column, is
to tbe memory of his illustrious father,
the other to that of Copenhagen.
The former stands just outside the
park at the point where, immedi
ately in front of one of the lodges,
the London road meets at right ancles
upon that which connects Reading with
Basingstroke. A simple marble tomb
stone standing under the shadow of a
spreading Turkish oak marks the spot
where the brave horse was buried with
military honors, and bears the following
inscription, from the pen of the second
Duke: "Here lies Copenhagen, the
charger ridden by the Duke of Wellington
the entire day of the battle-, of Waterloo.
Born 1808, died 1836."
God's humbler Instrument, though meaner clay.
.Should share the glory of that glorious day.
The first Duchess of Wellington, with
whom Copenhagen was a great favorite,
wore a bracelet of his hair, as did several
of her lriends, and on the occasion of the
writer's last visit to Stratbtield Saye, In
September. 1883, he received from the sec
ond Dukn a little sheaf of the charger's
mane and tail, as well as a precious lock of
the Waterloo hero's hair. It may be men
tioned in passing that Sir William
Gomm's redoubtable Waterloo charger,
"Old George," who died at the ace of 33,
is buried under a stone seat at Stoke
Pogis, the scene of Gray's familiar and
beautiful elegy.â Our Animal Friends..
Bird Stories.
It is no.t lair for cats and dogs to carry
off all the glory. Allow me to tell two
stories from my own personal experience
of gratitude in a gooae, of humor In a ra
ven. 1 was walking one day with a friend
through his poultry-yard, when a jiooso
hurried up to him, fondly rubbed its neck
against his trousers and followed him
about everywhere. He told me that he
had once rescued it from being done to
death by its feathered companions because
it bad a broken wing. Could any un
ieathered biped have shown e; eater affec
tion? May we not say with Wordsworth:
A'a-! ihe gratitude of men
Bath ofteuer left me mouraing.
And now for the raven. I had been
taking duty lately in the tower for my
friend, the chaplain, when my slumbers
were disturbed by the raucous croaking of
a venerable raven of unknown antiquity,
but, by all accounts, the oldest inhabitant
there. By his jaunty hopping about
under cannons and shady trees, he clearly
shows that he considers the entire pre
cincts to have been provided for his com
fort by a grateful nation. On returning
one day from lunching with Ihe Governor,
to whom I complained of his sleep
destroying noises, I found my gentleman
perched on the back of a garden-chair. I
solemnly admonished him of his offenses
against the church. He listened calmly,
without sound or movement. When 1
concluded my homily, he turned up bis
right eye to me and deliberately winked.

WELLER SENT TO
THE COUNTY JAIL
A Large Sharp Glass Found
in His Box of To
bacco.
Hs Could Have Easily Ended
His Life With the Keen
Implement
A Fear fhat He Wou'd Do So Was
What C. us. d Marshal Baldwin to
Make tha Change.
Lee Weller, alias Newman, alias many
other names, who is wanted in Australia
for many murders, was sadly surprised in
the City prison yesterday noon. United
States Marshal Barry Baldwin and Dep
uty Gallagher toot the sailor in a hack to
the County Jail on Broadway and placed
him in the custody of Chief Jailer Sat
teriy for safe-fceeping.
For several days past Marshal Baldwin,
who has had charge of tne notorious pris
oner, has been very uneasy at reports
published to the effect that Weller had
Actual Size of the Sharp Glass
Found in Lee Welter's Tobacco-
Box.
declared that he would never be returned
to Australia alive; that he would commit
suicide first. So Mr. Baldwin decided that
the City prison is not sufficiently safe.
At that place Welier has been permitted
to receive his sailor friends and females
whose admiration for murderers over
comes all modesty. He saw that with
hundreds of persons coming and going
through the City prison, many of whom
have made Welier presents of cigars,
fruit, candy and bouquets, there was
plenty of opportunity tor some one to
pass to the prisoner a vial of poison or
even a sharp knife with which tbe sailor
might fulfill his threat and end his life.
Tne fact that morphine had already
been found on the prisoner of itself was
sufficiently alarming to warrant making a
change.
So yesterday Marshal Baldwin called
British Consul J. W. Warburton, to whom
he stated the case and asked if the British
Government would stand the expense of
hiring special watchers to guard the pris
oner in the County Jail until the Presi
dent's order of extradition and tbe trans
fer of Welier to the Australian authorities
arrives. Consul Warburton appreciated
the situation and stated that alter going
to so much expense the Government
would not hesitate to expend a few dollars
more to insure the safety of the prisoner.
Accordingly the latter was removed in a
hack to the County Jail, much to his dis
gust. To him the change meant no more
cigars, candy, flowers or Jruit; no more
gossiping with friends and misguided
and sentimental females.
Weiler was assigned to cell 40, but be
fore being placed in his new quarters Chief
Jailer Satterly searched the prisoner thor
oughly. Among his effects Weiler carried
a cigar-box in which were a number of
cheap cigars and a quantity of cut-plug
smoking-tobacco. In the bottom, care
fully concealed by the tobacco and cigar*,
was found a large piece of sharp glass
with which the prisoner couid easily nave
ended his life.
Ht smiled grimly as tbe glass fell to the
floor, but made no answer when asked
what h-- intenied to do with it.
The glass was apparently broken from
the side of a small whisky-flask, and one
edge curled up close to where the neck tits
to the shoulder of the bottle. The lower
part of the glass had beet) broken so as to
form a gradual bevel terminating with an
( edjre like a knife. It was sharp enough to
have cut wood. On the upper part also
was a sharp beveled edge that cou'd have
been used to deadly effect by a desperate
man with the prospect of the gallows star
ing him in the face.
Of course, the prisoner would not tell
bow he became possessed of the glass, but
it is suspected that he enjoyed the con
tents of the bottle before he broKe out the
large piece lcr future use, if he decided
that drastic measures were nece?sary.
Every other portion of the man's cloth
ing and effects were cirefully examined,
but nothing else of an alarming nature
was found. He was placed in cell 42. but
to-day he will bo placed in cell 40. From
now on two of the Sheriff's men, depu
tized as United States Marshals, and a
man from the Marshal's office will take
eight-hour watches with the prisoner until
the neces-<ary papers arrive from Wash
in ton. The Marshal will feel greatly re
leived when he is finally free of nis bur
densome charge.
Butler was constantly revolving schemes
in nis mind for the purpose of delaying
his inevitable departure for Australia to
stand trial for his crimes.
At the time he was anxious to procure
morphine from a newspaper man, Victor
S. Wolf, a prisoner who is waiting 'is pre

lmiinary examination for obtaining money
by false pretenses, was put in the cell
with him, so that be could give warning
of any attempt Butler might make to end
his life. _ a
Butler was constantly talkinp to wolf
about the chances of making his escape
from tde City Prison. One chance he
thought the mos.t favorable was to take
advantage of the occasion when the cells
and corridors are wÂ«Â«hed oat every morn
ing. On these occasions Butler was al
lowed to go to a sink at tbeÂ«Â«ndof the
corridor to wash his face and hands.
He told Wolf tnat it would be a simple
thing to knock down the doorkeeper, take
the keys from him and his revolver and
escape before an alarm could be given.
Butler was ignorant of the lact that on
these occasions tne doorkeeper leaves his
keys and his revolver with tbe desk ser
geant to avoid just such a contingency,
which Murderer Fredericks unsuccess
fully demonstrated.
Butler also hinted to Wolf that it would
be better for him to murder some one here
so that he would have to be tried here and
it would be a long time before he would
be taken back to Australia in that event.
He looked so meaningly at Wolf when
hinting at this step, that Wolf became
afraid that he would choke him to death.
Wolf complained to Captain Robinson
that he was afraid of his life and could
not sleep at night, but pretended to do so,
keeping his eyes furtively watching But
ler.
If Butler had not been taken to the
County Jail yesterday the probability is
that he would have murdered Wolf or at
tempted to escape by attacking the door
keeper as suggested by himself.
How be got possession of the piece of
glass is a mystery unless some "trusty"
gave it to him for a consideration.
The City Prison officials are satisfied
that Butler will not be taken bacK to Aus
tralia if he can possibly avoid it.
NOTES OF THE THEATERS.
Trebelli Gives a Song Recital
in Golden Gate
Hall.
Cissy and Her Wink Drawing at
the Co umbiaâ French Opera
To-Night
Mile. Trebelli was in exceptionally fine
voice at her vocal recital in Golden
Gate Hall last nuht, and as she sang well
known and favorite songs every number
was heartily applauded, the enthusiasm
waxing warmer and warmer with each
succeeding number. Mile. Trebelli gave
several encores, occasionally accompany
ing herself on the mano. The star was
assisted by Miss Carrie Bowes, who opened
the concert by playing Rafl's "Prelude
and Fugue in E Minor" in her usual grace
ful manner.
Haydn's pathetic Bong, "My Mother
Bids Me Bind My Hair," was the first on
the programme and was exquisitely sung
by Mile. Trebeili, who followed it with
Gounod's bereuse, "Qnand tv Chantes."
The "Shadow Song" from "Dinorah" was
a marveluus feat of finished realization.
In response to the inevitable encore Tre
belli obliged with the old ditty, "Love
Was Once a Little Boy."
Grieg's "Snepherdess," which is a strik
ingly original composition, was sung very
aramaiically by the cantatrice, who also
gave songs by Mattei and Gomez, and
probably in honor of the day concluded
her recital with B*lf?'s 'â¢Killarney."
On Saturday afternoon Mile. Tubelli
will give another song recital.
Davenport' 3 gorgeous production of
"Gismonda" is arousing so much interest
at the Baldwin that it.will probably form
the bill for the whole of next week. Sat
urday evening will be the silver souvenir
night, when all iadies having seats on the
lower floor will be presented with elegant
little trays bearing the likeness of Miss
Davenport. The bill on Saturuay will be
"La Tosca."
Otis Skinner will follow Miss' Davenport
at the Baldwin.
Although Cissy Fiizgerald and her
wink are not received with any particular
enthusiasm at the Columbia they are
drawinc good house?. "The Foundling"
will run till the end of next week. Tne
next attraction at t c Columbia will be
Mr. and Mrs. Russ Whytal in f heir ro
mantic drama, "For Fair Virginia."
"Jim, the Penman" is nearing the end
of a successful run at the Alcazar.
"Eagle's Nest" at the Grand is a pic
turesque melodrama which is very effect
ively staged. Miss Anna Daley, the lead
ing lady pro tern., is proving very accept
able to the audiences, and Nat Wills'
tramp specialty is a champion mirth
provoker.
The series of Gilbert and Sullivan reviv
als is drawing to a close at the Tivoli.
Next week a brilliant production of Nio
lai's "Merry Wives of Windsor'" is prom
ised, with Laura Millard in the role of
Mrs. Ford.
The four Cohens ana Keating and
Walker are the new people at the Orph
eum this week.
The capital musical programme at the
Oberon is drawing large audiences.

M. Carre and Victor Marse, and "La Cav
aiieria Rusticana," Mascagni's well
known work. The cast will be as fol
lows:
"Lei Noces de Jeannette"â Jean, M. Treiehe;
Thomas, If. Grevin; Jeannette, Mme. Berihet;
Petit Pierre, M. Lelong.

EARNED PURSES
The St. Patrick's Day
Crowd Left Emeryville
With Money.
The Burns & Waterhouse Entry
Candelaria Given a
Stake.
Rey del Tierra Scored at OJds of 50
to Iâ A Number of Tumbles
ia the Hurdle Event.
St. Patrick's day attracted only a trifle
iftrger crowd than usual at the Emeryville
â¢.rack yesierday. Green ones in the bet
ing did not cut a very wide swath, as five
of the six favorites tapped the wire first.
Rey dti Tierra furnished the surprise,
capturing the tilth race at odds of 50 to 1.
The Golden Gate handicap over seven
and a ha!! furlongs was a languid affair,
though it did prove profitable for Burns
& Waterhouse, which firm has experi
enced more ttian ordinary luck at the
u-*cic across the bay. They scratched
Casper, "thrown in with a catch, 1 ' and
started Candelaria.
The colt was backed down from twos to
6 td 5. ana after being cut off a couple of
times defeated Scarf Pin with ease, stiil
further illustrating the saying, "To him
who bath snail be given," but to the poor
owner who possesses not he snail go broke.
Lincoln II peeked in for the short end.
Ed Purser, away up at the scene of Cor
batt's downfall, womd probably weep bit
ter tears of anguish as he learned of the
victory of his Rey del Tirra. The colt
started at odds 01 40 and 50 to 1 in the
mile run that was fifth on ihe card, and
always having the Sooting over the second
choice. Stentor, which Kept him company
well into the stretch, won easily from the
favorite, Colonel Wheeler. Tne recent
performances of the horse had been very
poor, and be was almost entirely over
looked in the betting.
McNaughton & Muir shot out the favor
ite for the first event at six furlongs in
Cavailo, which receded in the betting from
7t05t09 to 5. He killed off the gray filly
Reel and won ridden out at the end two
lengths before the fast-coming Widow
Jones.
Jockey Felix Carr captured another
parse with, his good sprinter Montgomery
in the second event decided, also over six
furlongs, under selling conditions. The
Hanover gelding was a 3 to 5 favorite in
t. c ring, and having Mainstay beaten at
the head of the stretch, won with little to
spare, less than two lengths in front of
Hazard, a 7 to 1 chance.
Another favorite went through in the
iix-furiong dash that followed. Dun boy,
with R laom up, went to the post an
even-money favorite, and after cutting
out the pace almost from the jump won
easily from Hohenzollern. the second
cnoice, in 1:16. Roselle, alsto 1 shot, se
cured the show.
Mishaps were numerous in the handicap
hurdle event,. over one mile and a quarter,
Thlee Forks, J O C, Rob Roy, Silverado
and Tortoni all giving their riders bad
spills. Flashlight, carryine all the wise
coin aÂ£ oads of 8 to 5, eventually won
easily from Tuxedo, against whom the
ring laid 9 to 1.
NOTES.
Eddie Jones, who had the mount on
Rosalbra, was fined $100 by the judges for
not persevering with the chestnut colt.

had turned on "Our Dave," as the Secre
tary is known in St. Louis, with his short
paragraphs with telling effect, and Francis'
friends got together and concocted a
scheme to offset the editorial work of the
paper. They wrote out a display adver
tisement and at a late hour of the Satur
day morning immediately preceding the
election of 1888 took it to the counting
room of the Globe-Democrat. The clerk
on duty gave the copy a casual looking
over and wiihout a word accepted it. It
occupied a full pace and at length and in
glowing terms set ,'orth the "great busi
ness capacity and eminent, qualifications
of Mr. Francis to occupy the guberna
torial chair of Missouri."
That advertisement caused the bigeest
row ever witnessed in a newspaper office
in St. Louis. When Editor MÂ«Cuiiagh
found what bad been done he raâ¢ed and
stormed for a week. The last mail had
distributed the paper all over Missouri be
fore McCullagh bad his attention called
to it. He left his quarters at the Southern
Hotel on a trot. Reaching the corner of
Fourth and Pine street-", he found the
streets and the office of the Globe-Demo
crat jam me. i with people, who were
clamoring to stop their subscriptions.
â MrCulla-'h had riilod a column on the
editorial page with "squibs" stronply op
posing Francis, and advocating the Re
publican nominee, but the big display of
Francis 1 friends was the first thing seen
on opening the paper.
Mr. McCullagh at once issued an extra,
in which be deprecated the oversight by
which the advertisement hud found its
way into the paper, but it wns some time
before the Globe- Democrat office recovered
its equilibrium.â Cmcago Record.

TO THE EAST.

ENFORCED.

.
Joaquin Miller, the poet of the Sierras,
with his touseied mane all allare by the
Â£md of Market street, walked Into the
Palace Hotel yesterday after a long
absence in the East.
He had come to call on hia old friend,
JOAQUIN MILLER, Who Says He Will Soon Abandon Writing.
! Mrs. Howard Coit, of whose illness he had
just heard at his home, "The Heights,"
where ho arrived quietly a few days ago.
Mr. Miller had the manuscript and
proofs of his new book in his pocket. He
talked of the book and other thines in bis
! usual characteristic and interesting way.
Before he got through he delivered him
self of a few opinions regarding literary
work on the Pacific Coast, and said some
snappy things about the attitude in which
Nevada has put herself. He also alluded
briefly to his pleasant visit East.
"I have the proofs of my new work with
me here," said the poet. "I have just been
around to see my publisher. Tha book
will be out in thirty days. It is to be a
compilation of all my poems that 1 con
sider worth publishing, and will have
some simple title like 'Joaquin Miller's
Poems. 1 When I get out this book 1 shall
quit writing forever and go to work. 1
will go back to 'Tne Heights' and dig in
the ground. I am through writing for
good. 1 have piped to the people here
and they hare not danced. Tney have
laughed while I have cried. I am not com
plaining; lam satisfied.
"Bat 1 am thankful that I bare been
the Kit Carson if not the Fremont of the
remote border literature. 1 came back
from the East with a great deal of strength
and con ful once. The East was magnifi
cent, from the new President down to the
Governor of my native State, Indiana,
and while they were good to me they
were greater to the greater West.
"I think we may as well get our prize
fights ar..l newspaper chin-chins done
with. It ought to be enough for us to
know they will not hare the prize- lights in
the States, and they will not have these
low assaults on our justices of the courts
and our legislators, to know what we
oughtto do here.
"We ought to first civilize ourselves
before asking great civilization to emigrate
this way, for we are truly the most civil
ized people and the strongest in the world.
But we let ourselves be sidetracked by a
Nevada prize-flgnt. or an Oakland strike,
or a ban Francisco newspaper row.
"Alt I have to say is go ahead â that's
all California has to do â and don't be side
tracked. The Eastern States are willing
to come to us when we are willing to be
quiet and be great, and do what is in us to
do. And that is mighty great, my son.
We were born vastly bigger than the East.
"I have been many months away. I
was born an observer, and my trade as a
scribe fcr a quarter of a century hiÂ»s com
pelled me. to observe. I have this for
California to say:
"Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Don't be sidetracked. Be ashamed of
this prize-%ht show and prize-fight
people and prize-light newspapers.
The dirty thing haa cost California
five years of her life. I am talking
now from the heart of this Republicâ from
the good big men in the heart of the
Union.
"lam ashamed of Nevada and 1 think
the best Oalifornians and the best Oregon
ians are ashamed of Nevada.
"It is much to know, however, that
California has not made a rope-ring of
herself or a bull.tigbt arena and she would
do well enough to say this much at least
for herself.
"As lor ex-Senator John J. IngalU I
was goins to say I never heard of him,
but I remember I have. He's from Kan
sas and is a big grasshopper. He's the
biggest grasshopper there. That's
enough. You might say, my son, there
have been three big ones there â John
Brown, Senator Dorsey and In trails, but
the last is the biggast grasshopper. TDitt's
all, my son, good-by."

TO AID THE CARNIVAL.
The Associated Improvement
Clvb 3 Grapple With Num
erous Questions.
Tbe High* Hit Ordinance and the
Pound L raits Discussed at
Length.
The usual bi-monthly .neeting of the
Associated Improvement Clubs was held
last night at B'nai B'rith Hall.
Little if anything was done by the club
in the line of advocating City improve
ments, other than a 1 engthy discussion on
the pound limits and the suppressing of
the bie-hat nuisance in theaters as pro
posed by Supervisor Rottanzi's ordinance.
The delegates from the Fairmount Club
requested the aid of the club in getting
Chencry street improved. The mutter
was turned over to the street committee,
with instructions to aid the members
from Fairmount.
The extension of the pound limits along
the following boundary evoked consider
able discussion:
Commencing at the intersection of D nnd
Sin n > an streets, along Stanyan street to Fred
erick', ttlong ivrederlck to First aveuoe, along
First avenue to H street, along H street to
Sixteenth avenue, along Sixteenth svouue to
the Ocean House road, along Ocean House
road to Mission road, lo Amazon avenue, to
Munich street, to Frances avenue, to La Grande
avenue, to Visitacion, to Mononganela street,
to San Bruno avenue, lo CorUaud avenue.
This was amended on the motion of
Delegate Morris from the Sunset Club that
all that portion south of the park be
omitted from the proposed limits. This
was adopted, much to the satisfaction of
the Sunset Club.
Tbe by-laws were amended, by which
the club will in the future hold monthly
instead of bi-montnly meetings, on tbe
first Wednesday evoning of each month.
Henry S. Martin, Oscar Boldemann and
Charles de Garao Gray, from the carnival
committee, were admitted for the purpose
of asking the 00-operation of the club in
the coming May carnival.
Mr. Gray acted as spokesman for tbe
committee and in a lucid speech informed
the members of what the committee has
deeded to have done in council next
week, and in conclusion asked for finan
cial aid.
The request was referred to the carnival
committee: L. H. Kobn, Leon Samuels,
A. J. Fritz, C. W. Marks, I. hchwartz ana
Charles Alpers.

MANY JELLIES
ARE ADULTERATED
Report of Chemist Wenzell
of the Board of
Health.
The Department Alarmed Over
the Spread of Contagious
Diseases.
A Conference on Pur-F ol Subjects
Is to Be Held To morrow
Evening-
Buying jelly is like buying lottery tick
ets tbeao days. You "pays your money
and takes your choice," but it is about a
3 to 1 shot that you don't get what you
pay for, no matter what your choice may
be. If currant jelly is what you want you
may get a mixture of apple and currant
jelly, or it may be apple jelly and starch
colored with aniline dye, or again it may
have coal-tar color* and acetic acid mixed
in. Chemist Wenzell of the Board of
Health has been delving into the mys
teries of currant jellies for a month past
and the result of his labors was made
known at the meeting of the board yes
terday.
He analyzed thirty-three samples pur
chased at* groceries in various parts of
town, and of these only nine were found
to be pure. Ten were found to be adul
terated so ac to be dangerous as food,
fourteen were not currant jelly but mix
tures of the product of the currant and
apple jelly, and one too much decom
posed to tell wnat it was.
Tbe result, of bis investigations will
probably be the arrest of the men who
sold the goods for violating the pure* food
laws.
The board is again very much alarmed
over the spread of contagious diseases,
and will redouble its efforts to check them.
Dr. Williamson, chairman of the commit
tee on epidemics ana contagious diseases,
rendered a report in which he stated that
measles was epidemic in all parts of the
City except on Telegraph and Russian
hills, and that 781 cases had been reported
during February, with six deaths.
There were thirteen cases of diphtheria,
with three deaths, nine of typhoid fever,
with two deaths, and nine of scarlatina,
with no deaths.
The committee further stated that diph
theria was spreading* twenty cases with
eight deaths having occurred since the
lsi inst., with half the month yet to hear
from.
The committee urged that the board
take some measures to compel physicians
to report cases of tuberculosis, stating that
the doctors were neglecting to comply
with the law.
On the recommendation of the Health
Officer the following buildings were or
dered vacated until they can be placed in
Mtnuary condition: 17 and 19 Washington
alley ; 1000, 1002, 1004 ana 1006 Dapont
street; buildings on the southerly line of
Bartlett, between Pacific street and Bart
leu alley; Â«out east corner of Bartlett
alley and Pacific street ; 910, 912, 914, 916
and 918 Kcarny street. The report was
adopted. The same course was taken
with a corral situated between N and P
streets and Twelfth and Thirteenth
avenues. A nuisance was declared to ex
ist in a vacant lot on the northeast corner
of P street south and Thirteenth avenue
bOUth.
The board appointed Patrick Lydon an
assistant launury inspector and J. Kelly
an ambulance driver, each at a salary of
$75 per month.
Drs. Morse, Hart and Fitzgibbon were
appointed a committee to see the Auditor
to try to induce that official to audit bills
amountinc to $299 30 contracted by the
Health Officer, secretary and Attorney
Reinstein, who is not connected with the
board in an official capacity, while lobby
ing Board of Health bills through the
Legislature.
A resolution was passed calling! a con
ference for to-morrow evening at 8:30 of
the Pure Food Committee of the Council
of Aasociaied Industries and representa
tives oi the Merchants' Association,
Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association, San Francisco
Fruit Exchange, State Board of Trade,
San Francisco Prodnce Exchange, Me
chanics' Institute, State Development
Committee and San Francisco Board of
Trade.
PURE FOOD CONVENTION.
It Will Be Held on the Last Friday
In April, In the Morning.
An important conference of the board of
directors of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association with the pure food
committed of the Council of Associated
Inaustnes, was held last evening in the
Mills building. The purpose was to fix
the time and place for holding the pure
food convention which has been called by
the association named. It was decided
to hold the convention on the last Friday
in April, at 10 o'clock, in the Chamber of
Commeice Hull, it the hall can be ob
tained.
The following committees were selected :
Subjects and speakers, B. W. Rowley, M.
J. Keller and L. K. Mead; publications,
J. A. Filcher, J. W. Kerrand A. Sbarboro;
invitation and correspondence, Isador
Jacobs, Cnerles R. Allen and W. F. Bow
ers; transporter:, Julian Sonntag, the
chairman, who will act with the foregoing
committees, which were given full power
to act.
â¢An invitation from the Board of Health
was read in which it stated that all the
leading associations of the City will meet
in the board rooms in the City Hall on
next Friday even in ir and requesting the
association to send representatives. The
subject of enforcing the pure-food or
dinance will then be discussed.
President Sonntag stated that there
is one of the associations that is endeavor
ing to have the prosecution of such cases
postponed thirty or forty days, so that
those who are now violating the law may
have a chance to dispose of their stock of
adulterated good-. That body asserts
that a speedy prosecution of those cases
wonld work a bardsnip on the dealers.
1-ador Jacobs said that the purpose of the
proposed delay is to let the dealers relabel
their goods, so that the public may not
know the contents of packages. It was de
cided that the entire board of directors
should be at the Board of Health's meet-
ins.
Mr. Sonntag brought up the matter of
the petition presented, or to he presented,
to the Supervisors, asking that the rail
road ticket- scalpers' ordinance, granting
n license to curry on that business, be re
vokud. lie said that the railroad com
puny will reiuse to grant special rates to
excursionists to the carnival of the .Go. den
Gate and Christian Endeavor convention
it' the scalpers are permitted to operate in
the railroad's concession. It was decided
to authorize Mr. Soniitug to sign the peti
tion for the two bodies asking the Super
visors to at least temporarily revoke the
scalpers' license ordinance. These licenses
will expire on April 1, and they shoulu
not be renewed, was the expression of
those present.

EASY TO ACQUIBE GBACE.
Practice Before a Mirror Did Wonders
for an Awkward Girl.
Every woman of society desires to be
graceful on all occasions, but many find it
extremely difficult to master tbe art,
while many are compelled to acknowledge
the impossibility of accomplishing the
task. One woman who was far from
graceful by natural gift, but who over
came all obstacles to the attainment of tbe
coveted faculty, tells how she did it.
"All through my girlhood," she says, "my
mother lectured me on ray manifold awk
wardness. My wait, my carriage, my sit
ting down and standing up were a series
of angular movements simply intolerable
to her artistic nature. But it never ap
peared to me that I could help it. I was
'made that way,' and bowcould I change?
"Well, one day I chanced to read of an
actress who always studied her pans before
a full-length mirror, in order to be sure
that her gestures were graceful. It caugbt
my attention in some way, and 1 thought
of it many times in the next few days. At
last I came to a deliberate resolution that
I would adopt her plan and see what
would come of it. Thereafter all my spare
boura were passed in tbe drawing-room,
where there was a large pier glass. I took
my books there to read, and chose an old
fashioned armchair to sit in. At first I
merely looked at my reflection alter 1 was
seated, and actually blushed at its un
gainly angles. Then I observed the figure,
approaching the mirror in short, jerky
steps, and blushed again, until I was as
dissatisfied with myself as my poor
mamma, and became absorbed in my en
deavor to improve. I studied pictures and
copied their attitudes as closely as I could.
When I went to the theater 1 gave earnest
attention to tbe movements of the
actresses, and when I went home tried to
imitate them.
"I am afraid that all this sounds as if I
had developed into a most self-conscious
prig and poseuse, but I can acquit myself
of any such feeling. I was studying grace
of motion as one might study drawing,
and with no more egotism, but, indeed,
most humble self-depreciation. I prac
ticed standing until I Jearned to correct
tbe faults so clearly visible in that inspir
ing glass, until my limp spinal-column
acquired t-eli-reliaiu c and firmness ana the
protruded chin drew back into line. I
practiced walking on the line suggested
by a mere chance sentence in a novel,
'She walked with rather long, raythnric
steps as it to music,' and studied the dif
ferent rhythms until I found one that
seemed to me most graceful." â Chicago
Chronicle.
NAVAL DISuIPLINE.
Some of the Hardships Kndured by Sail
ors in the Times I,ong Ago.
Keelhauling was a method of naval dis
cipline particularly in vogue with the
Dutch navy, for as Van Tromp swept the
Channel with a broom at the masthead,
his countrymen sometimes used human
sweepers unaer their keels. In large
square-rigged vessels the victim was lashed
to a spar and had iron weights secured to
his feet; spans were secured to this spar
and lines were led from it to the main
yard. When all was ready the culprit was
swayed up to the mainyard, dropped into
the sea and hauled under the ship to the
other side.
Here is the way Marryat describes its
oneration in that small cutter where
Smallboaes suffered, and Snarleyow was
thought to be a dogfiend : "This ingenious
process," he write?, "iÂ» nothing more nor
less than scudding a poor navigator on a
voyage of discovery under the bottom of
the vessel, lowering him down over the
bows and with the ropes retaining him
ex. ctly in his position under the keelson,
white he is drawn aft by a hauling line
until he makes his appearance at the
rudder-chains, generally speaking quite
out of breath, not at the rapidity oi his
motion, because when so long under the
water he had expended all the breath in
his body ;md induced to take salt water in
lieu. â¢ â¢ *
"In the days of keelhauling, the bot
toms of vessels were not coppered, and in
consequence were all studded with & spe
cies of shellfish called barnacles, which
attached themselves, and as these shells
were all open-monthed and with sharp,
cutting points, those who underwent this
punishment (for they were made to hug
the keelson of the vessel by the ropes at
each side fastened to their arms) w-re cut
and scored all over the body, as if with so
many lancets, generally coming up bleed
ing in every part. But this was consid
ered rather advantageous than otherwise,
as the loss of blood restored the patient if
he was not quite drowned, and the con
sequence was that one out of three, it is
said, have been known to recover after
their submarine excursion."
No words can add to this weird descrip
tion of a very old and hearty sea way of
murdering. All the officers of juniorand
raiddta rank, and all the men, whether
volunteered, shanghaied or pressed, were
systematically underpaid and robbed. â
Harper's Weekly.
General Porter's Story of Grant.
General Horace Porter, in the January
Century, tells this anecdote of General
Grant: "A drum corps in passing caught
sight of the general, and at once struck up
a then popular negro camp-meeting air.
Everyone began to laugh and Rawlins
cried: 'Good for the drummers!' "What's
the fun?' inquired the general. 'Wny,'
was the reply, 'they are playing, "Ain't I
glad to get out of de wilderness!" The
general smiled at the ready wit of the
musicians and said: 'Well, with me a
musical joke always requires explanation.
I know only two tune-. One is "Yankea
Doodle" and the other isn't.' " The late
George W. Childs in his autobiography
tells the climax of this story in a some
what different form. He heard it from
Grant some years after he had become
celebrated, and by that time the general
was acctistomed to shy that the only tunes
he knew were two: "One is 'Hail to the
Chiel' and the other isn't.' General
Porter's reminiscence shows that Grant
probably originated this pleasantry at an
early age, and carried it through life,
adapting It to circumstances as he moved
from obscurity to fame.
The late Sir Isaac Pitman once said that
only one person in eight who professes to
write shorthand can transcribe 'iis notes.

QUEER NOTICES TO QUIT.
Some of the Reaanna for Moving Given
by Dissatisfied Tenants.
Draughty room*, smoky chimneys, high
rents and ghosts are classical reasons for
giving up occupancies, but the same can
hardly be said of the excuses made by
many people who develop a desire to get
out of their holdings.
A man who has bad thelettingof houses
for twenty years recently recounted a few
of his experiences in connection with this
phase of his occupation, and a selection
of them may prove interesiing reading to
many.
"I can't stand it any longer," was the
remark of a man who came with his no
tice in his hand. "The people in the next
house live on bloaters 1 It's herrings for
breakfust, herrines for dinner and her
rings for tea, and we find it impossible to
open a door or a window for the odor that
emanates from them. It permeates every
room in the house, and all our belongings
smell of it. I'll have no more of the
wretched thing; so you can look out for
another tenant 1"
I. was qu>te a different reason that a
lady had lor quitting a tenement that she
had occupied for three years and a half.
At the back of the house she rented was a
lawn, adorned %vith flower-bed and an
arbor, which formed a delightful retreat
on a summer's afternoon. Here the lady
spent many a pleasant half hour, and
would have done so again, but that her
peace of mind had been rudely disturbed
by a neighbor, who, developing a sudden
hobby, erec:eU an apiary in his garden,
and devoted himself enthusiastically to
the manufacture of honey. An occasional
swarm of bees round the lady's ears, just
as was in the middle of a siesta, was
more than she cared for, hence her deter
mination to j.o.
It is not an unusual thing for a person
to give up a dwelling in consequence of
its contiguity to a public house, but to
leave one for the exactly opposite reason
is a much rarer occurrence. Such, how
ever, was the motive assigned by an arti
san for getting out ol his cottage. "It's
like this," he said, in explanation. "I
never keep beer in the bouse; it gets flat
and unprofitable under the parlor stairs.
I like my ale fresh drawn and served up
in something like condition, and a find
the public's the place to get this. Now,
there isn't a licensed house within a quar
ter of a mile where I live, and 440 yards
(except for a sprinter) is too far to fetch a
pint o' dinner Deer before the potatoes
get cold. You can put my shanty on the
'To Let 1 lifct."
Superstitious tenants are people that the
house agent has to reckon with. A newly
developed district on the borders of a
provincial town was lately taken in band
by the local autnority and the houses
numbered. A tenant whose house got the
number "13" went in hot haste to the
agent with a notice to quit, being sure, he
said, that ill luck would be his portion if
he .stayed. In similar manner another
nervous one gave up a hou-e because for
three nights in succession he heard the
"whoo-whoo" of a luckless owl in some
trees near by.
A facetious tenant wound up his quit
notice with the following laconic sen
tence: "The doors won't shut and the
windows won'topen; the fires won't draw
up and the blinds won't draw down ; the
water won't turn on and the gas won s

Kxplanation.
T"ne arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted suow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hich" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
rt-fers to low pressure, and is usualh- preceded
and accompanied by cloud v weather and rains.
"Lows"' usually first appear on the Washington
roast. Whf-n the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south aloiia the coast, rain is probable:
but when the -low- is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V.. March 17.â Speculation at
the opening of the Stock Exchange was weaker,
owing to the lower quotations from London and
the unfavorable statement of St. Paul for the sec
ond week cf March. Notwithstanding these in
fluences and the fact that the foreigners sold be
tween 10,000 and 12,000 shares of the Interna
tionals listed stocks the bean made comparatively
little headway. Prices after a decline of X/ to %
per cent quickly rallied, witn the Vamierbilts
again tee great leaders of ihe market. Thep-r
--sistf-nt buying of these stocks imparted fresh
courage to 1 he bulls and they marked prices up all
along the line.'
Around midday there . was another setback
owing to a sudden break In tobacco from 78 1 /i to
76 on heavy- sales. At about thÂ» same time coal
stocks developed weaknesi and Jersey Central

stocks were also heavy Â«nd lost the early Improve
ment. Even these declines failed to disc ncrrt
tbe bulls, who bad the advantage of excellent sup
port by the Vanderbllt group. Omaha was up to
65. an advance of 3Vi pol.its from tbe lowest, of
the morning. Lake Shore rose %. Nickel Plate
first, preferred 2, and hock Island 11/4 per cent. :
Tobacco rallied to 77 . and fugar rose from
1125/ to 114. Fluctuations in the rangers' and
Gould stocks were comparatively slight. Specu
lation closed firm for th* â  anderbllts and-bugtr
ana rather weak for Jersey Central, Heading,
bt. Paul, Louisville and Nashville and General
Electric. A mouj the specialties standard Hope
and Twine broie 3 points to 614 on liquidation.

10S Broadway, March 17. f
The Macdonough Tnoater was packed
to-night with an audience that assembled
to do honor to the saint whose festival is
placed on the calendar for to-day. The
affair was made the occasion of a grand
benefit for the Church of the Immaculate
Conception.
The beneficiary is the church of the
venerable Father King, the oldest priest in
.Alameda County. Father King laid the
foundation of his parish in pioneer times,
REV. FATHER KING.
when oak treesjjcovered the present busi
ness portion of the city. His was the first
church of the Cachoic faith erected in
Oakland.
The proceedings opened with an oration
by J. J. McDonald, the orator of the even
ing. He reverted briefly to the example
of St. Patrick and his piace in the history
of the church, and in forceful language
regretted that tneday so dear to the hearts
of many should be chosen as the day for
a brutal exhibition among men claiming
to be civilized. Mr. McDonald's speech,

Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 17. f
Superintendent McClymonds of the
School Department iÂ« just now the most
interesting man at the City Hall. All the
other officials know their fate, while sur
rounding McClymonds there is just enough
uncertainty to make him of interest.
Mr. McClymonds' term will expire with
the old Board of Education, and ihere is
just a chance that he may not be his own
successor. The chance, however, is very
slim, and so far there is only one oppo
nent. This is Professor burrill of the
High School.
The new board will meet the first Mon
day in April, ana they will then proced
to elect a secretary. McClymonds' frien is
claim to have eight votes ;or him, white
Burrill calmly expresses the opinion that
he can count on about half a dozen. As
there are but eleven votes in the board
some one is evidently making a miscalcu
lation. McClymonds has been in his pres
ent position lor eight year?, and has seen
the School Department take immense
strides in that time. He - undoubtedly had
a good deal to say regarding the men
nominated by the Republicans for School
D;rectors last October, and as a straight
Republican ticket was elected feels proba
bly safe.
Professor Burrill, on the other hand,
has good cause to feel uneasy. H.s pub
lished statement a few weeKs ago was re
garded by McClymonds as an unwar
ranted cr.ticism on his superior officer.
Bumll said many hatd things about the
Superintendent, and criticized nar-hly the
whoie system pursued in the grammar
schools." It is not lik-ly that MiCiymonds
will let the incident pass. Knowiu how
near was the end of his own term oi office,
McClymonds paid no attention to tha
matter, but therfe is no doubt that when
safely re-e ected for four years he will de
man lan explanation from the heaa of
the language department of the High
School.
This opportunity to explain will very
probably caus a sensation in school board
circles. Burr.il asserts that nearly all his
brother professors are of the same opin
ion as himself, and are thoroughly dis
satisfied with the training of the pupils
prior to their reaching the High School.
This is a very serious objection for a pro
lessor to make, and it is very doubtful if
many of his fellow-members of tut faculty
will stand by hiiu at the critical time.
In the new board are several members
who In previous years have bsen Iriendly
to McCiyraonus, and it is Out reasonable
to infer tha they will vote to re-elect him.
Some of ttiem are under personal obliga
tions to McClymonds, and the outlook at
present is ihai McClymonds will superin
tend the schools for the ncx four years,
while somebody else than Professor Bur
rill will be teaching languages in the High
School.

WAS RUINED BY
ONE NIGHT'S ACTING
Helen Dahl's Experience
While Trying to Be a
Davenport.
Instead of Wiijning the Applause
of Thousands She Goes
to Whittier.
A Story, the Moral of Which Was
Very Clearly Pointed Out by
the Judge.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
DOS l*>r jauway, March 17. \
Helen M. Dabl has been for over a year
a belle oi Hay wards. A few months ago a
traveling company of what are pro
fessionally calle I "barn stormers" stayed
two nights at Haywards. On the second
evening one of their leading ladies sud
denly became ill, and it was necessary to
fill her place in a hurry.
The manager of the company bad his
attenti n called to Miss Dahl, who had
never before done anything more deserv
ing of applause than sing at private
theatricals. Helen, however, was at
tractive, did not show any evidence of
stage fright, and could sing tolerably
well, so she was put on the platform the
second night. There was a large audience
in the theater and Helen made a hit.
From i bat night all her desire was to
become a star. She gave her friends and
parents notice that she was anxious to
shine as a planet in a firmament in which
Fanny Davenport and Modjeska and a
few others would be but satellites, and
when once this idea entered Helen's head
it was of no use for her parents to demand
or friends to advise.
She watched the daily papers for adver
tisements of pretty young girls wanted to
perform in minor parts at San Francisco
theaters, and one day she saw something
tdat she thougnt would suit here. With
out giving ter parents warning she left
her country home to find fame in the me
tropolis. For several days there was a
hue and cry by her parents, but Helen
conld not be found.
A few weeks later some of her towns
folk were "taking in" San Francisco, and
in a little amu-ement-house known as the
'"Empire" they found Miss Helen tloing a
SDecialty. They conveyed the news to her
father, and as she was under 18 years of
ace, with the aid of a little official help
she was soon back at the old homestead.
But the desire for a public life before
the footlights had taken possession of the
wayward Helen, and she threatened as
soon as possible to resume the career of
an actress.
Now coine3 the rery prosaic and most
unromantic finale. This morning at the
instance of tier father she appeared be
fore Judge Hall in the Superior Court.
The story was told, while Helen giggled
and seemed to mink it was a good joke.
Finally the Judge decided that the nest
thing for the youmr lady would be a term
at the VV'hittier Reform School and he
made the necessary order. Helen jaunt
ily declared that sue had no objection to
poing there and whispered asiue to one of
her companions that she wouldn't he
there many w*eks, it evidently being her
belief that it is an easy matter to escape
from thut place.
In making tiie commitment Judge Hall
referred very strongly to the lesson ex
emplified of the fate of a foolish ycung
girl who persisted in rejecting the good
advice of her parents.
AN UNGRATEFUL VANDAL.
Wrecks OnÂ© of Car- Repairer Lad low's
Pretty Gardens.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 17.â William
B. liudlow, foreman of the car-repairing
shops at West Oakland, is an enthusiastic
lover of flowers. There is not in this city
a finer amateur collection than he has at
his home on.Eig!ith street. When McKin
ley was nominated. Mr. Ludlow sowed
different colored plants in his garden
making the word "McKinley" appear in
red on a large green field.
He said he had done this previously in
his life and that if the seeds grew the
nominee was sure of success. In the case
of McKinley he did not make a mi-take.
A few days ago he let ont in front of his
house, where all pedestrians could see, a
hundred varieties of beconias, for he is
mora anxious for other people to enjoy his
dowers man he is to keep ihem in his hot
houses. This morning when he awoKe he
found that some vandals had entered the
garden, stolen every one of the begonias,
trampled down many other rare plants
and flowers and did all the damage they
could. He declares that he wifl never
again make an attempt to do anything
for the good of the public.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 17.âCandi
dates ai the lecent election are now filing
the expenses of their campaign, and it ap
pears that some of them obtained very
good positions in the city government at
a very small outlay. W. A. Dow, who
was elected City Attorney, spent oniy
$269. of which $1.50 wan paid to the Re
publican committee for hall rent. R. M.
Clement, who was elected City Engineer,
only Â«pent $118.
Auditor Snow spent up to his limit, and
this is peculiar, inasmuch :i it was abso
lutely certain that he would succeed him
self, there being really n j other candidate
in 'he riei i.
B. C. Cuvllier was elected Councilman

Ely Matthews paid $7 for the honor of
being on the ticket.
Glover's Mind Is Disordered. -
OAKLAND. Cal., March 17.â Robert
Glover, tormerly a well - known livery

a charge of lunacy. Dr. Myra Knox acted
with Dr. Wilson in conducting the exami
nation, and this is the second instance of
a lady physician officiating as a commis
sioner in an insanity case in this county.
The testimony show<-d that Glover was
feeble-minded and frequently wandered
about in an aimless manner. Nothing
can keep him at home, and although his
family rented a room in Oakland and pro- j
vided him well with clothes, he would '
give them away, and at night seek shelter
at ihe City Hall. The physicians decided
that he was mentally disordered but not
dangerous to be at lnrjre. and his wife
will try to secure his admittance to gome
institution for feeble-minded.

203 Broadway, March 17. \
In the Police Court this morning two
Judges sat on the bench, and it was proba
bly the first case on record where two
Judges sat in Dank to hear charges against
a few old drunks.
Judge Wood went to his chambers as
usual this morning, and was met by Judge
Allen, who was yesterday appointed to
succeed him. Allen quietly remarked
that he supposed Judge Wood knew of
what had taken place, and Wood replied
that he did and had not made up his
mind whether to accept Mayor Davie's
appoi itment without a contest or not.
The Judges had a little conversation and
finally bgth went onto the bench, where
Judge Wood transacted the business while
Ju lee Allen took thÂ» part of a spectator.
After the adjournment of court Wood
stated that he would accept the ruling of
Mayor Davie and give way to Allen to
morrow morning. He 3aid after looking
at the law that the Mayor had authority to
remove a Police Judge'at pleasure, and he
would bow to that authority.
Judge Allen was asked why the ap
pointment hud been made so ion- after
the date â January 1, when Wood's term
expired â and he said he supposed that
Davie was carrying out an understanding
that he bad made with his (Allen's)
friends before election.
The .hi l go denied that there had been
any arrangements between himself per
sonally and the Mayor.
Judge Alien has appointed as his cler*
W. J. Hennessy of W*st Oakland, and
Phil If. Walsh as his s enographer.
Mayor Davie says that he has appointed
Allen In place of W-.od because Allen "i s
a good Republican." It is supposed that
Davie means by this that Wood is not a
good one, having run independently last
election and declined to seek the Republi
can nomination.
While Allen sits on the police bench,
Juil-e Wood will preside at the Justices'
Court. The salary in both cases is the
same, and Doth men are elected under the
title of City Justices, and the law places
the option of designating their respective
positions with the Mnyor.
It was stated to-day that the new
Mnyor, W. R. Thomas, who will take
office the first week in April, will reap
point Judue Wood. Captain Thomas not

which box it was believed would di dose
the treasure and titie deeds to gold mines.
The son paid $43 back rent on the box,
compromised an o'd claim of attorneys
for $1500 or $1700 for $iOCO, to come out of

A Gan Fired Under Water.
At Portsmouth a short time ago a stage
was erected in the harbor within the tide
mark. On this an Armsirong gun was
mounted. The gun was then loaded and
carefully aimed at a target, behind which,
was the hull of an old vessel, the Griper,
which lay in range of the ball â all this, of
course, being done during the time of low
tide. A few hours later, when toth the
cun and the target were covered with
water to the depth o: six feet, the gun was
rired by means of electricity. The target
itself was placed twenty-live feet from the
muzzle of the gun. It was composed of
oak beams and planks and was twenty
one inches thick. To make the old Griper
invulnerable a sheet of boiler-plate three
inches thick was riveted to its hull. On
all of these â the oaken target, the boiler
plate and the Gr, perâ ihe effect of the
shot from the submerged gun was start
ling. The wooden target was pierced
through and through, the boiler-plate
was broken into pieces and driven into the
backing, the shots goinz through both
sides of the vessel, making a huge hole. â

THAT UNHAPPY
MINING COMPANY
Turbulent Meeting of Hale
& Norcross Stock
holders.
The President Declares an Ad
journment Without Day
Despite Protest.
Stockholders Then Gather in Another
Room, Organiz; ani Adjmrn
Until To-Day.
The stockholders of the Hale & Nor
cross Silver Mining Company made an
other of those attempts to hold a meeting
Buch as have characterized the company
of late.
Two meetings were held, the first being
adjourned without day by the president,
M. W. Fox, before any action was taken
on the ground that there was no legal
quorum present. Then the stockholders,
protesting against this action, convened
in room 11 of the same building, R. R.
Grayson presiding. The ro:l being called
a majority of stock was found to be pres
ent, and the meeting adjourned until to
day at 1 o'clock.
The earlier meeting broke up with some
characteristics of a row about it. A row
â was anticipated, for two well-developed
policemen took positions well up toward
the president's de-k before the meeting
was called to order.
M. W. Fox, as presiding officer, under
took to question the holders of stock and
proxies as to the authority under which
they held them. His right to do so was
questioned, and R. R. Grayson moved to
adjourn. Fox declared he haa no ricHt to
move to adjourn until it was determined j
whether or not a quorum was present, j
Grayson persisted, when Fox angrily told
him and others who seemed to sympa
thize with him that they mu*t keep quiet
or he "would make tdem.'" At this tnere
were groans and hisses of disapproval
from the stockholders.
The meeting yesterday was held in pur
suance of the direction of Judge Slack
when he on Tuesday dissolved the injunc
tion that had been secured by Fox.
On the 9;h of March Fox filed a com
plaint against R. R. Grayson and others
in the Superior Court, uuon which, on the j
f )l,ow:ng day, he secured an injunction
forbidding their holding a meeting and \
electing officers. The injunction was :
Berved in the ruidst of the iioidinp; of the |
meeting, which thereupon adjourned.
Upon this injunction being dissolved on
Tuesday the meeting was called to be held
yeslerday, convened in room 11. where it '
had been held Lefore, and adjourned to j
convene in room 3 ol the same building, j
the Stock Exchange. There it reconvened, j
with President of the Board of Directors â¢
Fox in the chair. The roll being called!
the sec-etnrv announced that there were !
present 85,278 shares. Trie stock of the ;
Hale & Norcress Silver Mining Company j
consists of 112,000 shares, so that 56,001 |
com i r <eJ a majority and a quorum. All
of the stock, it is alleged, save 2700 shares, [
stands on the books of the company in i
the names of trustees. By trustees it was â 
to be voted and on this rocc the two fac
tions ,-plit.
The president claims the right to deter- I
mine whether those who offer the stock .
are the bona-tide holders or owners, and j
to refuse to accept the vote of said stock
unless the holder can make a showing
such as wili entitle him to vote it under
.the law of 1880.
On the other hand, R. R. Grayson and
other holders of large blocks of the slock
declare that ;he president has no right to
adjourn the meeting at all except by a
majority of the stockholders, and then
only from day to day, and not then unless
no election is held. They deny his right
to question the holders of stock as to
where they got it, and tnat it is for the
stockholders themselvas to say whether
stock shall be voted or not
Oi the stock ret resented yesterday it was
claimed that 23,000 were in certificates of
stccs presented by the holders themselves
and 42,890 were present oy persons in
whose names the stock was registered in
the bookt of the company, tne proxies
being in the hands of the secretary.
This being announced R. R. Grayson,
who represented over 80,000 shares, moved
to adjourn until to-day. The .motion
was s.conded, but the president refused to
put it, on the ground that he must first
determine whether or not there was a
quorum present. He asked Mr. Grayson:
"Is thli your stock? "
Mr. Grayson declined to answer.
"Did you borrow this stock!"
Mr. Grayson still declined to answer.
"Have you got the consent of the parties !
in whose names this stock stands to vute
it?"
Mr. Grayson still declined to answer
and those insisting upon the motion being
put or an appeal from the chair taken
creaied considerable confusion and the
president, in aloud voice, declared, "Here,
you people will have to keep quiet or I'll
make you."
This expression was hooted. The presi
dent then, holding that no legal quorum
was present, declared the meeting ad
journed.
Mr. Deal and Grayson and others called
upon all present to adjourn to room 11,
Grayson's office, and thÂ«-re hold a meet
ing. Ihis was done. Mr. Grayson took
the chair and the roll was called and 86,207
shares were found to be represented. The
meeting then adjourned to meet to-day at
1 o'clock. Frank Mahan, a stockholder
and trustee, api eared and protested
czainst the meeting as being irreguiar in
many respects, "to be determined by the
courts."
No attempt wiJl be made by the presi
dent, or those who sympathize with him,
to hold a meetinc. "When a majority of
the bona-tide stockholders come and wish
totooid a meeting we will bold it," he
said yesterday. "As it is these 'trustees'
are merely brokers, into whose hands the
stock has fallen for sale or otherwise, and
who wish to control the election for their
own- interests in manipulating the stock â
depreciating it by levying assessments
and the like. ThÂ« law direct y provides
.against such contingencies, and whey
they have their way in this matter then
can take the office and the property for
all of me."
W. I. Bageett quotes this as the law
governing Fox's action â section 2 of the
act of April 23, 1880:
All stock in each and every mining corpora
tion in tnis State snail stand in the books of
said company in all cases in the names of the
real owners of such- stock or in the names of
the tru-iiees of buch real owners, but in every
case where such stock shall stand in the name
of a trustee ths party for whom he holds such
stock in trust snail be designated upon said
books an<l also in the body oi the certificate oi
surh stock.
Section 3. At such election the stock of said
corporation shall be voted by the bona-tide
owners thereof as shown by the books of said
corporation and the certificate of stock duly
indorsed b3 produced at such election, in
which case said certificates shall be deemed
the highest evidence of ownership and the
hoider thereof shall be entitled to vote the
same.
The stockholders, however, as stated,
deny the right of the president to ques
tion the Holders of stock. And in any
event they say he had no right to ad
journ the meeting without day, and
nold that section 312 of the Civil Code is
clear on that point. It reads as follows:
Any regular or called meeting of the stock
holders Sr members may adjourn from day
to day or from time to time it for any reason
there is not present the majority of the
subscribed stock or members or no election
hud.
At the meetfng to-day officers will prob
ably be elected.
ANIMALS KILLED BT TEAINS.
foxes and Owls Often the Victimsâ Dogs
Lured by Foxes to Death.
The retort printed a few days ago that
a buck deer had been killed by a train
near Sayville, L. 1., reminded sportsmen
of many similar tragedies of the animal
world. When the buffaloe3 roamed across
the plains they not infrequently com
pelled trains to stop until the herds had
passed. Anteiopes were killed quite of
ten by the locomotives.
The glare of the .headlights at ni-.-ht
seems to stupefy the beasts UÂ»t cross the
tracks. Owls are killed frequently, as
well as many other birds, during the mi
pratory season. An engineer on a New
Jersey railroad, while pass.ng through
the. pineries one night, heard a faint crash
of glass above the roar of the train. In
stantly the headlight went out, and the
lireman went forward to .earn the cause.
A short-eared owl had flown into â¢be
glass, broken it, broken the chimney of
the lamp and lodged acainst the reflector,
a dead bird.
The fox, in spite of his craft, is one of
the animals most frequently killed by
trains. The chances are that most of the
foxes killed are youne and inexperienced.
In England foxes closely followed by a
pack of hounds have been known to run
in front of a train along the track, then
jump off again before the train cimÂ« up.
The docs would follow after in full cry.
and a dozen or more would be killed. One
pack ran under the wheels of an express
in their eagerness to get the fox.
Rabbits, wild turkeys, skunks, part
ridges, quail, squirrel*, wild ducts and
geese and many other kinds of animals
that abide by railroads have been killed
by the trains. â New York Sun.

SUNK THE
STEAMER
The Sunol Run Down in
the Bay by the Bark
Olympic.
TURNED TURTLE AND
WENT TO THE BOTTOM.
No Lives Sacrificed, but the
Loss Estimated at
$100,030.
SEVERAL VERY NARROW ES
CAPES.
Scenes of Excit mÂ»nt During the Col
lisionâs2s,ooo on Board for
tke Navy-Yard.
One of the worst disasters that has
taken place on the bay since the collision
between the Oceanic and City of Chester
occurred yesterday. Tlie liver steamer
Sunol was run down by the American
four-masted bark Olympic, and while the
loss amounts to nearly $100,000, still there
was no loss of life. In the case of the
Cay of Chester the monetary loss was not
so great, but a number of people went
down with the ship.
The Sunol, owned by the Piper, Aden,
Goodall Company, left for Vailejo at 4
p. m. She had forty-rive passengers
nboard and a crew of fifteen all told.
Captain Dye was in command and the
mate was Charles Ostrosky. Conflicting
stories are told, but it appears that the
captain was below having his dinner and
the mate was in charge of the pilot-house
when the accident happened.
"When first seen the mate thought the
Olympic was at anchor and attempted to
cross her bow. When he discovered his
mistake he at once ordered the engines
rever.-ed and Captain Dye rushed on deck.
The Sunol gathered way slowly and
before anything could be done the big At
lantic clipperjcrushed into and almost cut
her in two. For fifteen minutes they re
mained wedged together and the tug Re
liance had to pull them apart. Then the
Snnol turned turtle and ail her deckload
went into the bay.
In the saie there was $25,000 in specie for
the Mare Island Nayy -yard. In the big
iron tank on the forward deck in which
the bullion and crude ore for the Selby
Smelting Company was carried, there was
about $40,000 worth of the raw material
and the merchandise would prob
ably amount to $5000 worth more. The
steamer was valued ai $25,000. So some
body will be "out and injured."
The crew lost eveiything tuey had ex
cept the clothes they stood in, and as all
the pass"ngers had been on a shopping
expedition they lost ail their purchases,
and consider they were lucky to escape
with their lives.
There was a wild scramble when the big
bark sirucK the steamer. Joseph Bush
ford was asleep on the upper deck and
thinking the vessel was going down he
jumped overboard. He had an overcoat
on and could not swin.. Lucky Jack
Healy and Dick Hugbes, two of Henry
Peterson's boatmen, werÂ« alongside the
Olyipi'ic towing in, and they at once went
to his assistance and picked him up as he
was going down for the last time and put
him aboard the United States quarantine
steamer George M. Sternberg. The pas
sengers and crew clambered over the bow
of the Olympic.
As eacn male passenger was Helped
aboard he was given a swift kick by the
crew of the bark, because they bad snoved
women and children aside in their hurry
to reach safety. The weaker sex stood
meekly by and only gathered their chil
dren closer to them and awaited their
turn. The last man to leave the Sunol
was Captain Dye. A few minutes later
the tug Reliance took hold of the Olym
pic, and when she was pulled free of the
Sunol the latter turned turtle. Two horses
on the forward deck went over with the
steamer. One of them was rescued and
the other is still hanging to his hitching
post in five fathoms of water.
In less than ten minutes after the dis
aster the bay was alive with craft of all
description. The first on the scene was
the tu_- Reliance. She was towing in the
bark Alden Bessie, and Captain Brokaw
at once signalled to cut adrift. The bark
was in !-afe anchorage and he wanted to
save life. The Reliance was alongside the
wreck five minutes after the collision and
HEW TO-DAY.

A TERRIBLE ECZEMA
Her Face Covered with Scales.
Could Not ; Leave Home.
Had to Sacrifice Hair.
Tried CUTICURA REMEDIES.
Improvement In Three Weeks.
Six Weeks Complete Cure.
Four years ago Eczema made its appearance
on my head in its worst form. I was attended
by t*'o physicians, but notwithstanding their
treatment it continued spreading, until my
face was covered with scales and became a
horrid, loathsome sight. For three months I
did not leave the house. I had a fine head of
hair, seven years' growth, and had to sacrifice
it. I was in despair. The physicians had failed
even to relieve me, when one of them recom- â¢
mended Cuticitra Soap. . I used three boxes
of Cuticdra (ointment), one half dozen cakes
of Coticdra Soap, and one bottle of Ctrri-
cuea Resolvent, and in three weeks from
the time I began, the scales had left my face â¢
'â â  and the skin lost its florid hue. In six weeks
i I was entirely aired. My face was smooth and
. my complexion clearer than it had ever been

The American Four-Masted Bark Olympx and the River Steamer Sunol Were in Collision Yesterday. The Latter Was Heading for
Red Rock and the Eark Was Making; an Anchorage Under Sail and Without a Pilot* She Was Out of the Usual
Course, and Captain Dye of the Sunol Thinking She Was at Anchor Attempted to Cross Her Bow, With the Result
That the Sunol Was Sunk.
rendered valuable assistance. The cap
tain of the Alden Bessie instead of drop
pint: anchor, however, kept on and pot
foul of the British tramp steamer A'uara
poora. No damage was done, and the
tide and wind carried the two vessels
apart in a few minutes.
The Active was the next on the scene,
and she was followed by the quarantine
boats Georse M. bternberg and liovernor
Perkins, tuÂ«s Sea Queen, Sea King and
Millie and the launch Amy. The sieamer
Monticello, also bound for Vailejo, stood
by, and Cantain Hatch had his boats
manned and was ready to send assistance
at a moment's notice.
The steamer Hope, which also belongs
to the Piper, Aden, Goodall Company, was
on her way to Berkeley, and she also went
to the rescue. While there were no lives
to be saved, nevertheless a considerable
quantity of wreckage was picked up. The
Sunol's piano was found and hauled
aboard thÂ« Hope, while one of the horses
was found in the custody of Jack Healy
and Dick Hughes; the boatmen, and was
hoisted aboard the steamer.
When the Sunol was struck and before
the passengers got aboard ihe Olympic,
some one let go the anchor and thirty
fathoms of chain was run out. In that
event no one can claim treasure trove.
Joe Bulchart, a railroad man who was a
passenger on the Sunol, was taken to the
Receiving Hospital last night, suffering
from submersion and a sprained back.
"I was on the lower deck," he said,
"when the collision occurred. It seemed
to me as if our captain thought be could
get clear of the other vessel and did not
imagine she was coming so fast.
"The men on the lower deck, when they
saw a collision was inevitable, ran up the
steps, but I thought there was a better
way to escape. I was thinking about it
when there was a sudden crash and a ter
rific noise of escaping steam, in which I
was enveloped, so I ran lo the side of the
steamer and jumped overboard.
"I saw that the oth r vessel had cut
through the Sunol, and as I looked ap
from striking the waer I saw the men
climbing from the steamer to the other
vessel.
"As I went <down I was struck on the
back by the other vessel, which almost
knocked the breath out of me. I had a
desperate strugele to get clear of her, and
when I rose to the surface I was nearly
exhausted.
"I am a fair swimmer, so I struck out
and managed to keep myself afloat till two
men in a boat picked me up. I saw them
first and shouted to them. They rowed me
to a tug and put me on board, and the tug
took me to Washington-street wharf.
"1 don't know whether any one was
lost, but I consider I bad a narrow escape."
H. F. Stahl, managing editor of th*
Vallejo News, was also a pasnenrer. "It
looked to me like an unavoidable acci
dent," said he. "While the Olympic had
some sail set she did not appear to be
moving through the water and it looked
as though we would easily clear her. We
â  iiscovered our mistake too late, however,
and the bark rushed into us. Including
the crew there were about sixty people
aboard and everything was in a turmoil
in a moment. The steam pipes were broken
and the escaping steam ndd>d to the
turmoil. One man had his hand scalded
and a number of others were sligntly in
jured. We all lost our baggage and the
cr?w lost everything they had aooard."
When the Sunol sailed for Vallejo Mrs.
11. Johnson and her children were abroad.
The husband and father had seen them on
their way and was watching the steamer
out of sight when the accident occurred.
He was almost frantic tor a few seconds
and then fell in a swoon. When the
Sternberg brought the passengers ashore
he was there tc meet her, only to find that
nis wife and children were missing. Then
he fainted again, and on being brought to
was tola that some other passengers bad
been landed by the tug Millie. He went
to where thai vessel had docked and there
found bis leved ones.
"It was a sad accident." said Captain G.
Brokaw. "My tug, the Reliance, was tow
ing the Alden Besse from sea and we
were almost abreast of the Olympic when
I remarked to my mate, 'Watch that
steamer. She is going to have a
close call.' Then I taw the Sunol back
ing and noticed that she couldn't gather
sternway, and I again remarked to the
mate, 'li's all up; there's going to baa
collision and a bad one.' Then I began
signaling the Alden Besse to let go the
hawser and anchor, because I thought it
was my tirst duty to save life. When the
Reliance got alongside I found that all
the passengers bad been saved, and Cap
tain Gibbs of the Olympic asked me to
takÂ» him in tow, as his vessel was leaking.
"Her martingales were gone and the
bowsprit twisted, and sho looked as
16
though she might have got a severe blow.
The captain put his chronometers aboard
my tag, and asked me to run him on the
mud flats. Directly I pulled the Olympic
away from the Sunol the latter turned
turtle and apparently went down. When
off the sugar refinery I had the well of the
Olympic sounted, and ft uuJ that there
was not enough water in the hold to
cause any apprehension, so I advised the
captain to anchor, which Ip did. From
what I can gather Captain Dye thougiu
tne Olympic was at anchor, and when he
discovered his mistake gave the signal for
full speed astern. The tide was against
him, however, and carried him right in
the way of the advancing ship."
Chief Officer Charles Moore of the
Olympic says that all the blame lies with
the Sunoi. It was her place to get out of
the way of a sailing ship, and as she failed
to do so lipr owners will have to pay ex
penses. His description of ths accident it
practically the same as that given by Cap
tain Brokaw.
Late last evening the wrecker Whitelaw
nnil the schooners Shasta, Alpine and
Pinole wore sent to the scene, and it is ex
pected that by to-morrow noon the Sunol
will be on the Berkeley mud flats. In the
meantime the company's new steamer
Grace Barton will take up the run between
here and Vallejo.
ANXIETY AT VALLEJO.
Relatives Clamoring: for Informa
tion Regarding Those on
Board.
VALLEJO, Cal., March 17.â At twenty
minutes to 5 o'clock this afternoon the
startling intelligence was received that the
steamer Sunol had been run into by a
sailing vessel of some kind abreast of Fort
Alcatraz while on her way from San Fran
cisco to Vallejo, and that she was in a
sinking condition.
It was known that the steamer carried a
large number of passencers, many of them
bein,; wives and children, husbands, sis
ters and brothers of residents of Vallejo.
The report stated that tbc Dassengers had
been saved, but this did not deter from a
thousand and one anxious inquiries being
made for the safety of those on board.
Tne office of R. J. R. Aden, one of the
owners of the steamer, was besieged with
people with t ear-dimmed eyes anxious to
gain the least particle of information. It
was nearly 6 o'clock before Mr. Aden
could communicate with the head office
in the City, where it was learned that the
passengers had all been taken off the
steamer and placed'on board the Uniied
States auarantine vessel and taken to the
City, and that they would come up to
Vallejo some time during the night, and
thai tne Sunol was lvinc in 5 or 6 fathoms
of water near the Berkeley shore, with
her bow sticking up out of water at an
ancle of 45 deg., and that they were in
te ml ing to put a watchman on board to
remain during the night.
It was barn to gain much information
from the City office, as thera was much
confusion, the mate and crew of the Sunol
being In there at the time.
Mr. Aden estimates the loss of the firm,
if the steamer is a total wreck, at $25,000.
A large quantity of freight was on b'>nrd,
0 ne of our mercnanta here had over $400
in one bill of goods, and many other* oi
lesser sums.
Mr. Gaspar, who is building the electric
light plant, at 2 o'clock this afternoon
telephoned to the City to have one of his
dynamos shipped by the Sunol this after
noon, and it it is on board it will be a
total wreck, as after once coming in con
tact with salt water it is of no account.
Should the dynamo be there it will retard
tiie starting of the plant at least three
weeks.
The Sunol was commanded by Captain
Dye, who is a tale and competent pilot,
and all here are. at a loss to understand
how the accident occurred. A large num
ber of peopln will be at Aden's wbarf to
night, when the r-dstack tug Sea Queen
arrives, to learn of the accident aud tne
safe lauding of the passengers.
Tne Mtnlo or Gracie Barton, a new
steamer owned by the Piper-Aden-Good
all Company, will be DUt on the route to
morrow night.
Latest Information.
The Sunol was towed to the Mail dock
by the Redmond last night and will be
righted some time to-day by the White
law. Messrs. George L. Underbill, as
sistant secretary of tne Selby Smelting
Company, and A. E. Pryor. general man
aeer of the Piper, Aden, Goodall Com
pany, returned on the Redmond with the
wreck. Both gentlemen assert that the
loÂ«s is greatly exaggerated and say that
$50,000 will cover the loss. Mr. Underbill
says that in so far as the Selby Smelting
Company is concerned the loss is so
slight that it will not be appreciable.
MRS. DIMOND IS BACK.
Her Husband Gave Her S2OOO and She
Will Now Go on the
Stage.
Mrs. W. H. Dimond, who recently left
here on her return to Honolulu to fight
her husband's application for a divorce,
arrived here on the Peru yesterday. Mr.
Dimond got his divorce readily, but ap
pears to have been very generous in his
treatment of his former wife, for he placed
$2000 in the hands of Captain Friele of the
Pern to be given her after the vessel got
outside of the three-mile limit, where no
hard-hearted creditors could pounce
down on the lady.
It is said her husband will also pay all
her attorneys fees and probably her local
debt-. There appears to be litti* sym
pathy for Mrs. Dimond in Hawaii. She
will go on the stage. Her manager was
with her in the islands.
When Mrs. Dimond left here after the
escapade with the man who deserted her
here, and went to Seattle, the declared
that shÂ« would put up a big fight against
Mr. Dimond, but ii seems she did not
do so.
THE SOUTH WILL COME.
A Large Delegation of Christian En
deavorers Will Attend the Con
vention.
Rolla V. Watt, chairman of the general
executive committee, baa just returned
from a short southern trip, on which he
went for pleasure and business in con
nection with his insurance company, yet
he found time to consult with the leaders
of the various branches of the Christian
Endeavorers in the various southern
counties, mm from them had assurance
that a large delegation will come to San
Francisco to attend the convention.
"Endeavor work down south is boom
ing so to sp ak," be said, "and from those
whom I met I had' every assurance of a
very large attendance lrom that part of
the State. I did not go down especially
on Endeavor business. I went more for
pleasure, but yet I paid some little atten
tion to the question when coming in con
tact with the leaders on my travels, and I
have reason 10 believe that we will have a
very large attendance in this City when
the convention meets."
LOVE-STRIOKEN CRIPPLE.
Daniel Kllerr's Attempt to Take His
Life Successful.
Daniel Ellery, the cripple, who in a fit
of despondency turned on the gas in his
room, 154 Fourth street, Monday, died at
the Receiving Hospital yesterday morn
ing and his body was removed to the
Morgue. Eliery had been employed as a
watchman for the Market-street Gable
Company on Valencia street, but wa< re
cently discharged. An unfortunate love
affair was primarily responsible for his
rash act.
In a letter to his mother Ellerv told her
not to worry over his death. He wrote:
"When you pet this note I expect to be in
another world. You must excuse me for
causing you so much pain, but believe
me I can't help it. Don't think I got
despondent on account of my being out of
work. It is not that at all and you
would be better off not to know. Win
nie's address is Los Angeles. I hope this
will not cause you pain, but if you knew
ail you would not blame me."

that bilked progress.
Wheeler spent almost the entire day en
deavoring to convince Judge Slack thÂ«t
the case of the deeds was not one for a
jury to decide. He quoted authorities to
bolster up his declaration that the issues
were equitable instead of legal. With his
hand on his heart he expressed his fear
that a court of law might make errors, and
immediately be loresaw the dire calamity
of an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Therefore, argued Miss Fair's legal ad
viser, it was better that Judge Slack
should first pass upon the equitable issues
involved.
Attorney Delmas could not see what
possible objection there was to taking the
I case before a jury and allowing the Judge
to make any suggestions of equity that
might com* ur> at the trial for the benefit
of the jury. It would save time.
Attorney R. 15. Mitchell, on behalf of
the executors of the bonanza estate, said
he was ready and willing to proceed to
trial at one, in accordance with the
agreement entered into by the lawyers
interested in the case.
But again Wheeler objected. He was
after delay, and if be could not get it any
other way he proposed to intervene on be
half of the heirs.
Judge Denson opposed such a course.
So did Delraas. The Graven attorneys
were for trial at once, and to bring about
such a consummation they magnanim
ously offered the other side the right to
open and close the arguments before the
jury.
"We are worn out with delay. We have
no fortune to tight this case any longer.
If there be any way to try this case we
want it. We are willing to yield any con
cession to the other side if they will agree
to try this case now."
But Wheeler was obdurate. Intervene
he would, and to-day the lawyers will
wrangle again over this latest subterfuge
of the Fair people to gain time.
Old Cases Dismissed.
I The first official communication from the
new Attorney-General, Joseph Mckeuna, was
received by United States District Attorney
Foote yesteruay. By it Mr. Foote was directed
to dismiss two old suits. one against John Cox
and two against Â£. and A. M. Waterfoid. The
cases related to the cancellation ot land
patents in Maripo3a County, where there was
said to have been irregular en trie*.
