The Government has denied the request
of Consul-General Lee that Sylvester
Scovel, the American newspaper corre

transferred to Havana for trial. The
Government holds that as Scovel will be
tried by a civil court the proceedings

EI Pas, the organ of the Autonomist
party, pays a high tribute to Prime Minister
Del Castillo in connection with the^Cuban

FRESH SPANISH BUTCHERIES.
Neither Women Nnr Children Spared by
Fiendish Oppressors.
* NEW YORK. S. V., Feb. 9.â Herald
special from Key West, Fla., says: Ha
vana advices received here state that a
Spanish column has raided a large insur
gent hospital in the Cienaga de Zapata
swamps in Matanza..
There were twenty-two ill and wounded
soldiers in the hospital, and these, it is
said, were killed by the 'Spaniards. The
two physicians in charge succeeded in es
caping, but four nurses (women) were
made prisoners. The Spaniards were
guided to the hospital by a Cuban.
While returning from this raid the
Sp.niards discovered a camp of Pacificos
just inside the swamp. This camp was
raided, and all male Cubans, thirty-two
SCENE OF BUNCE'S TERRIBLE ORDEAL.
The scene of the terrible experiences of Admiral Bunco's fleet on Friday nnd Saturday last was not far from where the
famous Monitor was lost on December 30. 1862. That the vessels all came through the storm safely, though more or less bat
tered or injured, is a matter for general thankfulness. There is no more dangerous locality alone the Atlantic coast than off
Cape Hatteras, as is attested by the number cf life-saving stations maintained by the Government in the vicinity of the hun
dreds of wrecks that strew the shores. During the time of the war especially, when there was no light service maintained, the
number of disasters was appalling. The loss of the Monitor was fortunately not accompanied by any great loss of life, nearly
all of her crew bring taken off in boats before she went down by tbe men i from the steamer Rhode Island, which had been
towing her. Tbe yes ci was on her way to join Admiral DuPont's fleet off Charleston harbor when she met the disaster that
terminated her short but eventful life. This was the second time she had ever been on the high seas, the first being her
voyage from New York, where she was constructed, to Hampton Roads. On the morning after her arrival, March 9, 1862, she
engaged in the battle with the Merrimac.
The San Francisco Call
in number, put to the sword. In the
camp were about twenty women and chil
dren. The Spaniards seized the women,
but told them the children must be aban
doned. Three of the women resisted and
were shot.
The other women, at the point of the
bayonet, were forced to abandon their lit
tle ones and march in front of the Span
ish soldier*. The women were sent to
Havana on Friday, accused of being ene
mies of Spain, and were placed in the
prison set apart for women of the town.
In Pinar del Rio province four Cuban
girls .were arrested by the Spaniards,
charged with aiding in the recent dyna
miting, of trains. The girls were found in
an old but near the railway and close to
the scene of the recent wreck. They re
fused to give their names, but said that
their parents had been murdered and
I their homes burned by guerrillas, and
! that they fled to the woods for safety.
I The girls claim to have been in the woods
j three months, and say they have subsisted
on game. '
When captured, each of the girls was
armed with a repeating rifle and a hunt
ing-knife. They also had plenty of cart
ridges. The Spaniards claim dynamite
was also found in the hut occupied by the
girls. They were taken to Artemisa and
imprisoned. The Spaniards believe that
they are daughters of the Cuban Chief,
Zarraga, who is operating in Pinar del
Rio.
The girls, it is alleged, have been sub
jected to indignities in an attempt to
force a confession, and are confined in a
cell, held for arson and other crimes.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 9â The Press
says England made a strong bid for the
Cuban Junta, but the fact is not generally
known. More than eighteen months ago
a representative of makers of war muni
tions and another representative of cer
tain moneyed men of London came here
and had several meetings with Cubans
known to have influence with the pro
moters of the present revolution.
These representatives made their report
to their principals and in due course secret
negotiations were opened, which had for
their basis the agreement by the Cuban
Junta to purchase all supplies, guns, am
| munition, medicine and, in the event of
1 recognition by this country, vessels to be
i sailed under letters of marque from cer
' tain syndicates whose headquarters were
| in London.
When this scheme was broached by the
j English agents, the Cubans were so
j strongly of the opinion that Cleveland
| would acknowledge them as belligerents
at the expiration of one year of war that
! the.v refused to listen to any proposition
which contemplated the removal ofthe
Junta â¢ from this country. Then the
Englishman named a sum of money to be
invested in Cuban bonds whenever tbe
j orders for war materials should aggregate
I a certain amount.
This was a great temptation, and at
I one time there was a strong sentiment fa
vorable to making the change of base.
Thenâ in the summer of 1695â there was
so general an interest in tne war by the
people of the United Mates and the out
look lor recognlttiri.i./. Le_-_^Â«;eut,.rlghtÃ
seemed' so â """"bear that the negotiations
were ended by a refusal to move to Lon
don. Since that time the ..effort by tho
English syndicates has been renewed,
and in order to clinch the deal the sum of
; $500,000 was offered to the Junta, through
Fidel G. Pierra, if the Junta would close
j the New York office and thereafter make
I its purchases ot the English syndicates
i which offered to subscribe to the Cuban
; bonds in the amount named.
Notwithstanding the pressing need for
I funds and tbe implied contract that goods
; purchased in England would be permitted
: to leave that country for Cuba, the Cubans
i decided to remain here, this being the
natural point from which the Junta's
] work should be carried on.
In speaking of this matter Pierra said;
I "Several millions of dollars have been ex
pended by friends of Cuba in this country
j and several million more would have been
i expended but for Cleveland's attitude.
It may bs that we may have to go to
England for future supplies, but I hope
; and believe that McKinley will not go so
| far out of his way to hamper us as Cleve
{ land has done."

The cruiser Columbia, which is farthest

Early this morning some signaling was

The battleship Maine anchored a little to

just six miles out from Fort Sumter. The
Fern lies behind the Maine, the New York

across tbe main channel is the monitor

It is supposed here tbat the ships have

believed she has sailed south, possibly to

The Vesuvius . has been ordered â  away
from League Island, and as she is to be
the blockade runner it is thought she will
come down the coast under her own or

them. This is the supposition, but it is
hardly possible.
Efforts to make some detailed state
ment of the injuries done the ships during
the storm have been of no avail. The
Marblehead, when up to the city, gave
little evidence of injury. Her superstruct

ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 9. â Advices

From the accounts received here it is

BATTLE WITH
DOCK-WORKERS
Hamburg Laborers Have
No Patience With the
Police. â¢
Trouble ' Brewing Since the
Strike Culminates in a Very
Lively Fight.
Cubs, Stones, Pistols and Sabrrs
Usedâ Two Men Killed and Nine
teen S;riously Wounded.
HAMBURG, Germany, Feb. 9. â Ever
since the decision of a majority of the men
who took part in the great strike here
of dock laborers employed in the ship
ping trade to return to work . there
has been much discontent among the
men, and those who watched tbe situation
closely could see that trouble was brew
ing. The defeat of the kers was due
mainly to the lack of funds, and they felt
very bitter that they were compelled to
return to work witbout having in the
least benefited their condition.
To-night the bad feeling among the men
culminated in a bitter fight between a
large number of ' men who had been on a
strike and the police, who for several days
had been anticipating the trouble. Be
fore the disturbance was quelled two
men were killed and nineteen seriously
wounded. Among the latter are five po
licemen.
It is not known exactly how the fight
ing started, but one report has it that it
originated in a dispute between some
men who were arguing as to the correct
ness of ibe decision to return to work and
who finally came' to blows. When the
police attempted to intervene the men
abandoned their own quarrel and com
bined to thrash the policemen, the fight
ing soon assuming wide proportions.
Another story is that the police were
the aggressors. However this may be,
the fighting became very serious, re
volvers nnd saber* being freely used. The
police were rapidly getting the worst of
the contest, they being greatly outnum
bered by the raging mob of rioters, whose
members were quickly 'swelled, not only
by genuine workingmen- but by the horde
of vicious idlers about the harbor, who
were only too anxious under the circum
stances to engage with their natural
enemies, the police.
The latter at first attempted to get the
mob to disperse by the use of mild means,
but these proving unavailing sabers were
drawn r and orders given to charge the
mob. The rioters, some of whom were
armed witb revolvers, while otbers had
bludgeons and stones as weapons, held
their ground tenaciously and made ' a
desperate resistance, which the police
were unable to overcome.
Eventually re-enforcements were hur
r.ed to the scene in response to the urgent
call of the officer in command of the
police, and finally the rioters were dis
persed with great difficulty.
Later crowds of workingmen gathered
in Sanct Pauli, Wilhelmsburg and Al
toona, all of which places are, practically,
parts of Hamburg, and threatened venge
ance upon the police. The latter, fearing
there would he another ou break, went In
rong force to the places mentioned and I
compelled obedience to their orders that
the streets be cleared.
They also cleared the streets, in the re
gion of the harbor. It is generally be
lieved that if the rioters had : been better
armed the police would not have been
able to handle them and tbat it would
probably have been necessary to call on
the military for assistance. .'
Most of the injured were removed to the
hospitals. Ninety of the rioters were ar
rested.
The quarter occupied by workingmen
was simmering with angry feeling and
the men were loud in their denunciation
of the police. Further disturbances dur
ing the night were anticipated, and to
guard against further outbreaks the police
patrols were doubled. A heavy rain is
falling and this tended to keep indoors
many discontented workingmen who
might otherwise have taken part in the

PLANS FOR THE INAUGURAL.
They Are 'Fully Explained â to President-
Elect McKinley by General Porter
.....*.*, and J. C. .Bell. ' .
CANTON. Ohio, Feb. The statement
that Governor John D. Long had been
definitely fixed upon for Secretary of the
Navy was confirmed by Major McKinley
himself tbis afternoon. There will be no
departure from this assignment of the
Navy portfolio unless the present Cabinet
slate should be remodeled at the last mo
ment. â 'â¢VK ..*>-V..
Ex-Governor Saxton of New York called
on Major McKinley this afternoon. He
said: "I have come to Canton in the in
terest of a friend and do not care to state
the precise purpose of my errand. I will
say this mucn, however, that it has noth
ing to do with the .election of a New York
member of the Cabinet, lam not an
aspirant lor appointment to tbe Cabinet,
and I think the most acceptable New York
Republican for that position and honor
is General S. L. Woodford of Brooklyn,
but I fear New York may be left alto
gether."
Major McKinley listened to an ample
and detailed discussion ot the plans for
the inaugural ball and ceremonies to-day.
C. J. Bell of Washington, chairman of the
inaugural committee told him all about
the arrangements for the ball. This
evening General Horace Porter came down
from Cleveland and explained the plans
for the big. paraoe.
General Porter is to be grand marshal.
He spent the night in Canton. It is un
derstood that his visit bas no relation
whatever the New York political situa
tion, and that he is no longer under con
sideration for the Cabinet. Mr. Bell ex
pressed the fear that the. failure of the
railroad companies to furnish low rates
lor the inaugural might reduce the crowd
somewhat, but from the accommodations
engaged it is thought that Washington
will be thronged.
Among Major McKinley's visitors to
day were ex-Fourth Assistant Postmaster-
General E. G. Rathborn 01 Hamilton, 0.,
Lieutenant Durb.n of Denver, ex-Mayor
Eustis of Minneapolis, S. H. Nash of
Manchester, Ky., and Edward Marston, a
full-blooded Indian from Alaska.
RUN INTO AN OPEN SWITCH.
Wrick of the East-Bound Union Pacific
Fast Mail Train With Fatal
Results.
OMAHA, Nebe, Feb. The East
bound fast mail on the Union Pacific
Railroad due here at 4:45 p. m., ran into
an onen switch in the yards and jumped
the track and the engine turned com
pletely over. The fireman was killed out
right and the engineer cannot live.
The dead man is Tom Krause of Council
Bluffs, who was scalded to death. W. H.
Vanney of Omaha, the engineer, was
fatally scalded and cannot live through
the night. J. Hughes, Pullman porter, of
Oakland, Cal., received serious internal
injuries. . . '
Several passengers were badly shaken
up and three ladies fainted. These were
attended by Dr. ton of San Francisco,
who was on ihe train.
William Henn, a switchman in the
yards, says that he had opened the switch
in anticipation of the approach of a Rock
Island freight, which usually precedes the
fast mail. To-day the freight was late, and
be. ore Henn realized it the passenger
train, running thirty-live miles an hoar,
came into view.
He signaled the engineer and attempted
to turn the switch, but was too late.
Mail distributors in the car to the rear
of the engine had a narrow escape. The
coach was badly battered nnd the brake
beams forced through the floor and rear
end. '

KINGMAN, Ariz., Feb. 9.â The posse
which left here last night in pursuit of the
robbers who boarded the Santa Fe train
near Nelson returned to this city this
morning to procure fresh horses. The
posse was re-enforced here and left again
for the scene of the "hold-up" at 11
o'clock.
At Nelson Indian scouts have taken up
the trail of one of the bandits and are
hopeful of soon capturing him. The trail
is clear and easily followed, as the man ia
riding one horse and leading another. He
has started northward from the railroad
toward Grand Canyon, a point situated
about thiity miles north of Kingman.
The body of the robber who win killed
is still at Peach Springs and as yet un
identified. The deceased was a young
man of slender build, about six feet in
height and of light complexion. From
his dress he was evidently a cowboy.
Nothing was found on his person that
would lead to his identification. It is be
lieved that he was one of the gang of cat
tle-thieves which had been operating in
the northern part of this Territory. The
inquest will probably be held Thursday.
GRIT OF THE MESSENGER.
Saved the Express- Car Treasure by Kill-
V ing the Leader.
, LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 9.â The
Santa Fe overland train which was boarded
by outlaws near Nelson, Ariz., last night,
when one of the robbers was killed by Ex
press Messenger Alexander Summers, ar
rived in this city only thirty minutes lato
this afternoon. It was well crowded with
passengers, each of whom had his own
tale of experience to relate. Some ludi
crous scenes were described, but the spec
tators were not in a frame of mind to en
joy ttem. Many of these stories exag
gerated the attempted "hold-up" to a
wonderful degree, one woman claiming
that fifty shots were fired.
The passengers one and all praise the
courage and coolness of Express Messen
ger Summers. There is nothing too good
for that modest and unassuming gentle
man here to-night.
He has been overwhelmed with con
gratulations. Crowds gathered at nearly
all the stations on the route to Los
Angeles to yell for "Good boy Alex."
Messenger Summers, who has been in the
employ of the company for ten years,
described his exciting experience to a Calt_
correspondent this afternoon.
"As we slowed up," he said, "one of the
robbers proceeded to uncouple the mail
and baggage car from the balance of the
train. Just then Randal, my assistant,
said that one of them could be seen from
my car side door and remarked, 'I can
bring bim down.' I said, 'Hold on, don't
shoot; it may be a railroad man.' There
are two doors on each side of the car.
Randal went to the forward side-door to
the left to get out, while I took the one on
the right, nearest the rear end of the car.
I opened it cautiously, and not seeing any
one, dropped down carefully to the ground
aud was going to crawl under the car and
get on the brakebeam.
"The two cars had been uncoupled and
were moving along at this time. I am
quite up to jumping brakebeams, and as
the end of the car moved up to me I
grasped hold of the side rods, at the
same lime observing one of the robbers
standing on the lower step of the same
platform on the opposite side. When I
had drawn myself up I took good aim
with my revolver and fired. He tumbled
headlong off the step. He had in his hand
a small cut-off double-barrelled gun and
was looking forward at the time, endeavor
ing to get a bead on my helper, who was
trying to get down on the opposite side.
"As soon as I fired I dropped to the
ground, and the engine and mail and ex
press cars moved away. I could see my
man lying on the ground, but not knowing
whether he was dead or alive, 1 fired two
more shots at his body. I then went up
to him and found that he was dead. The
first bullet had entered the back of the
head, just above the left ear. I lifted his
mask and came to the conclusion that be
was a cowboy. I also found under his
coat a bag which was fastened around his
waist. It contained several sticks of
dynamite.''

the following statement, which he declares
is absolutely correct:
'"The robbers corralled the watchman
at Nelson, a station six miles east of the
springs, for four hours, waiting for No. 1
to come along. When the train showed
np they made the watchman flag the en
gineer with a white light. Stopping the
train the robbers compelled the fireman to
get out and cut the mail and express cars
off. The train conductor. Rice, was in
the sleeping-car with Conductor H. Bell
man of the sleeper. Both went forward
to see what the trouble was.' They were
ordered back. Conductor Rice had
reached the ground and was compelled to
return, the brakeman running to tie rear
to flag No. 5 following.
"After the expross and baggage cars had

jumped from the express-car. Agent
Summers crawling under the car, hid on
the trucks. As the car passed the air
brakes held so the cars stopped.
''bummers, getting out and stepping on
the rear steps of the express-car, saw the
robbers, who had commanded the fireman
to cut the train loose, step up on the op
posite step. Taking his revolver and
steadying it on the chest on the rear plat
form, he fired, killing the leader of the
gang. The cars commenced to move and
Summers jumped off.
"The roboers (there were two left) took
the engine and two cars, with the engineer
and mail clerk still on, and ran ten miles
west, one guarding the engineer and the
other the mail agent. The engine was
backed up twice to ccc if the leader would
not show up, during the time the robbers
ransacked the mail. They were at the
work for two hours, taking all the regis
tered letters.
"The conductor got the shotgun, a re
volver, eight sticks of dynamite and a
belt with eighty cartridges off the dead
robber. Taen, with Express Messenger
Summers, the fireman and one other
man, armed with what weapons they
could borrow from the passengers, they
went forward to find the engine ana cars,
coming upon them two miles away. The
robbers, seeing them coming, left the
train and fled to the mountains.
"Too much praise cannot be given Mes
senger Summers, who is a brave man. By
the killing oi -the leader the train was
saved, as the remaining two robbers had
no dynamite to blow open the safe or
cars. The passengers of the coach and
sleepers were terribly frightened. The
engine and cars were backed to the train.
The dead robber was placed upon the rear
platform of the express-car and brought
to Peach Springs, where the body was left.
The train proceeded on to Los Angeles,
arriving here about on time."

and Sterling Elliott, candidates for Na
tional president of the L. A. W., are both
in the city. The assembly will be opened
Wednesday at 10 o'clock. Governor Black

tenant - Governor Woodruff, Speaker
O'Grady and other workers in the cause
will also make speeches.
The real session of the league will begin
Thursday and will last until Friday noon.
The banquet wiil be held at the Sianwix
Hotel Friday night. Governor Black.
Lieutenant-Governor Woodruff and Speak
er O'Grady will be among the guests.
Mr. Potter gives out the following state
meut in regard to bis campaign:
The work so far has been done by mv friends
and I cannot say definitely what my prospects
are. I have had assurances irom them to-day
that the situation is all right. We have had a
large number of letters trom Western dele
gates expressing a strong sentiment that a
western man should be elected Vice-Presi
dent, and there is a disposition among them
to get together ana name a man as candidate I
lor that office.
E. S. Hartwell of Denver will probably re
ceive the support of New York delegates lor
the office of treasurer, unless he decides oth
erwise. Connolly of Illinois and Morrison of
Wisconsin are highly esteemed by the New
York delegation, and'it would be presumptu
ous on the part of New York to select a West
ern man for an important position ln the ex
ecutive office until the sentiment of the West
is determined. 1 have made pledges and
promises, but in the ei.se of the success of my
tick. 1 1 have a clearly defined policy, and will
pursue It with as much zeal and vigor as have
been shown in building up the New York di
vision. ll is generally conceded that Mr. Gid
eon will succeed himself as chairman of the
Racing Board, and that the proposition should
be a salaried one. lam informed by Gideon
that the income ot his department last year
exceeded the disbursement by about $3000.
This sum may be well devoted to the chair
man, and I have no doubt that it will be.
The ereat work ior the league is the good
roads question. The work can be put on an
effective basis without cost. There are many
manufacturers and dealers in the United
States who have pecuniary interests in the
improvements to public highways, and from
my recent conversation with the most promi
nent of them I know that they stand ieady to
contribute a substantial sum to be expended

Correspondence of The United Associated Presses.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Feb. 3. â The
president of the American corporation con
trolling the Jamaica Railroad arrived here
on Thursday from New York. Whether
this had anything to do with what hap
pened on Saturday is not known. It is,
however, a fact that on Friday afternoon
several local newspapers received an an
nouncement, written in red ink and ap
parently with some such blunt instru
ment as a whittled stick, that it was the
writer's intention to destroy the railway.
This was regarded as a joke and passed
unnoticed; but on Saturday morning such
an attempt was actually made.
As the passenger train from Kingston
arrived at a point a couble of miles from
this station it came to a sudden halt and a
slight jar was felt. On inquiries being
made the engineer declared ihat someone
had fired off a gun under the engine as it
passed, but no persons or gun could be
found and so the train proceeded, although
the engine crew concurred that there had
been some sort of an explosion under the
engine and every one on the train felt the
jar.
Later on were discovered some odd
looking things along the track in the
same place and the matter was reported
to the station. An inspector of police and
a railway engineer went out on a trolley
to investigate and found what they in part
expected they would find â the remnants
of an infernal machine. But they also
found something else â a similar machine
intact. Appearances indicated that two
explosive bombs, diabolically conceived
but very poorly contrived, had been
placed on the track for the morning
passenger-train. One had exploded, but
with little or no result, while the other
bad been hurled off the track by the
force of the explosion and its fuse ex
tinguished. They were contrived to go
off on contact, but bad been lighted and
placed on the track as the train was ap
proaching. One acted on time and the
other, possibly lighted a moment after its
mate, was blown away.
What was found of the exploded bomb
consisted of three burst and rent milk tins
bearing the traces of gunpowder. The
intact one was a package containing simi
lar tins tilled with giant powder and iron
filings, to which was attached a connect
ing fuse a couple of feet long, the end of
which bad been ignited. The whole was
well packed in a box of earth the size of a
large ciirar-box. The police are investi
gating the matter.
Details of the fresh trouble between tho
French colonist, at Cayenne and the Bra
zilians in the trans-Amazonian provinces
of Brazil, which may lead to further dip
lomatic trouble before tho arbitration
agreement is reached, have been received
here.
The advices received are from Cayenne
and state that the acute tension between
the French and Brazilians at Para, wbich
reached Its height in the Mapa incident
last year, has latterly been revived by the
proclamation of St. Marie Belem as a free
port.
Up to that time matters had gone
smoothly enough, or at any rate there
was no direct friction, although the rela
tions between the local representatives of
the Brazilians and the colonists bad been
anything but pleasant. Trouble was
averted only by the announcement that
the diplomatic negotiations for tho'settle
ment of the boundary dispute were pro
gressing favorably.
Now the tension has been rendered
acute once more by a report that a Freuch
mining expedition into the Cachipour
district, in the disputed territory fiom
which it wis agreed that all troops be
withdrawn pending the settlement, had
been met by a force of Brazilian soldiers
and been made prisoners, after which one
or two of the French prisoners had beeu
shot.
The circumstances as told in the ad
vices to hand are that a party of mining
prospectors, under the leadership of a
Frenchman named Tilbert, bad entered
the Cachipour district. The party con
sisted of a number of Cayennese Creoles
and colored mine laborers from Mar
tinique and the English islands ot St. Lu
cia and Dominica.
There were twenty of them all told, in
cluding a woman. They ascended the
Cachipour River without any interference
until arriving at the Degrad lifeline land
ing, where they commenced erecting car
bets, or what are known in the West as
"wickiups." But before the party had
got through with this preliminary work,
and, of course, beiore they had begun
prospecting, they were suddenly sur
rounded by upward of 150 armed Brazil
ians, who came down on them out of the
bush and fired upon them without chal
lenge.
Tilbert naturally supposed that he was
being attacked by brigands, and as thu
was to be looked for the fire was returned,
but it at once became apparent that they
had to deal with a large body of soldiers
and not a few wandering brigands. Til
bert then ordered his men to stop firing,
but the soldiers continued to fire, and
many of the party plunged into the river
and attempted to net away in their boats.
These were fired upon and one or two
killed, while the others escaped and made
their way down the river. Tilbert and
the rest of his men were made prisoners.
The leader of tho Brazilians was an offi
cer named Perez. He sent the woman
under escort to Carsevene, but detained
Tilbert and five of his miners. These,
later advices state, Perez compelled to go
forward to the place whither the party
had been bound, and which appears to be
a promising gold field, and made t: em
work getting out the gold and teaching
the Brazilians how to do it So far the
prisoners had not been ill-treated, but at
the same time they were being kept hard
at work securing gold for their captors and
without any prospect of reward.
Fearing some reprisal from the French
Perez had sent to Para to ask for rein
forcements, but according to the advices
the Governor of Cayenne has decided to
take no action in the way of reprisal, but
has sent a protest against the disturbance
of the status quo to Para and laid the
matter before the Government at Paris.
Meanwhile all private mining operations
in the disputed, territory have been sus
pended, as they were only being carried
on with the understanding that the
political status quo would be respected on
both sides.
Public feeling runs high at Cayenne,
where the Governor is blamed for not

LEAKY EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
Despite the junction of Secrecy Imposed
Upon Senators Their Proceedings
Appear in Print.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 9.â For at
least half of the four and a hall hours the
Senate was in secret session to-day the
press reports of yesterday's session were
the subject of discussion. Senators were
indignant that, after they had voted so
overwhelmingly that the doors should be
closed, the facts as they occurred in the
chamber should be permitted to reach the
public.
The discussion was precipitated imme
diately after the consideration of a few
nominations by Vest asking if the treaty
was to be considered in executive session,
stating that if it was it would be well for
the Senate to ascertain if it really was in
secret session.
V^st continued to comment rather sar
castically upon the light that had been
thrown upon -.he proceedings, but admit
ted the accuracy of the press icports.
The discussion waxed warm and was
participated in by Senators Hill, i'ugh,
Hoar, Gallinger, Hale, Teller, Stewart and
others.
There was an intimation that officers of
the Senate had been guilty of violation of
the rules by giving away executive se
crets, but this was combated by Mr. Hill,
who said that everybody knew executive
matters were told by Senators and nc one
else. The discussion disclose 1 the fact
that Senators recognized the accuracy of
the newspaper reports and had made up
their minds to stop the leak if possible.
There was some talk of appointing a
committee of investigation on the subject,
alter the fashion of the committee ap
pointed several years ago, which resulted
in the dismissal of an executive clerk
charged with having told newspaper men
executive secrets, but against whom no
evidence had been secured.
Some Senators took the ground that
such a proceeding would have no bene
ficial result, and the debate finally calmed
down aft- some of the older Senators had
scored their junior brethren for the sup
posed offense of talking about things
which were forbidden.
The men who had made the fight yester
day for an open session found in the sub
ject under discussion additional reasons
why their motion should prevail, and
urged the Senate to reconsider the sub
ject, but this was not done.
Teller declared his opposition to the
secret performance in which the Senate
was engaging. The country, he said, was
interested in the arbitration treaty. Tho
text of that treaty and the amendments
had been made public and the people
were talking about it. They had been
petitioning Congress to ratify the treaty.
It there were good reasons why the treaty
should be ratified they were entitled to
know them, and if Senators had reasons
for voting against the treaty the public
ought to be permitted to know why Sen
ators took such action. The attempt at
secri-cy was a mockery, and Teller -a.d he
did not believe the Senate could main
tain H_
After this discussion had ceased several
amendments wore offered, and without
being read went over to be printed. Sen
ator Morgan had several and Senator
Stewart of Nevada sent a handful to the
cleric's desk. There will be innumerable
amendments before the discussion is over. ,
Conservative Senators to-day said it was
apparent this debate was to be kept up for
some time and the chances were that no
action could be had until after the 4th of
March. From the4;h of March until the
extra session is convened the Senate will
be in session considering nominations and
if the treaty haa not been disposed of by
that time it will probably be discussed
every day. It will not be withdrawn by
McKinley and Sherman, as Secretary of
State, will be as zealous in securing its
ratification as he now is a3 a Senator in
charge ol the convention.
lt was late in the afternoon when the
discussion was turned to lhe treaty
proper. Stewart made a short speech
against the instrument and repeated some
some of the arguments he advanced yes
terday when discussing the motion to
open the doors. In brief Stewart believes
it would be a good thing to reject the
treaty because Great Britain wants it. He
is suspicious of tbat country and believes
that her intentions are not what they
purport to be.
Morgan consumed the remainder of the
afternoon in a continuation of bis speech
begun yesterday. The indications are that
be will not conclude for several days. He
read freely this afternoon from the re
ports of the State Department and of the
Senate Committee on the Nicaraguan
Canal and the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and
quoted copiously from the State Depart
ment correspondence with our Ministers
abroad on the same subject. Ho said it
would be necessary for this Government,
before binding itself in a general treaty of
arbitration, to settle the question of the
vitality of the Clayton-Bui treaty and
ascertain in what light Great Britain views
that ancient and much discussed conven
tion, which, he contended, ought never to
have been negotiated, but once negotiated
ought never to have been ratified by the
Senate.
He then offered an amendment provid
ing for the abrogation of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty and advocated it at some
length. Morgan has always been opposed
to that treaty, and to-day he said that the
conditions that appeared to make it neces
sary when negotiated no longer existed.
The treaty was obselete, and so far as we
are concerned unnecessary.' althouch
Great Britain would seize every opportun
ity to make it answer her purposes.
He called attention to .the fact that
whenever Congress had discussed the pro
posed construction of the Nicaragnan
_anal this treaty hart been used as a club
to stop the United States. T ere could be
no doubt, Morgan said, that Great Britain
would make this general treaty of arbitra
tion serve her ends, a. she' had the Clay-
Lon-Bulwor treaty.
In the further course of his speech
Morgan called attention to the aggres
siveness of Great Britain in the Mosquito
jountry to show that she bad time and
Â»cain violated the provisions of that com
pact and by her violations practically nul
lified the treaty. The United States had
never taken official action and no time
was so opportune as the present. The oc
casion had now presented itself when the
United States could properly declare its
position and announce to Great Britain
that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty was no
longer considered by us to be in exis
tence.
Morgan also contended that the Nica
raguan canal should be excepted from the
treaty by name, and gave notice that he
should offer an amendment to tbat effect.
He also elaborated his proposition, gener
ally stated, yesterday, that the pending
treaty was improper because it virtually
look from the Senate its prerogative under
the constitution as a branch of the treaty:
making power of the Government and
lodged that power in : the hands of the
President alone.
IMMIGRANTS AND
BIRDS OF PASSAGE
Second Agreement of Con
ferees Agreed To by
the House.
Changes in the Measure Which
Make lis Enac ment a
Certainty.
Bills Allowing Pensions to WiJows
of Soldiers Are Passed Over
the Presidential Veto.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 9.â or
der that it might prepare the bill making
appropriations for carrying on the postal
service in the year ending June 80, 1898,
the Committee on Postoflices and Post
roads, on motion of Loud (II.) of Califor
nia, was permitted to sit during the ses
sions of the House.
Danford (R.) of Ohio called up the sec
ond agreement of the conferees upon the
migration tii!, presented to the
Hou-e yesterday, and after treating of the
statement by the conferees he demanded
the previous question. This was seconded;
95 to 12.
The bill as agreed upon provides for the
admission of illiterate wives and children
of immigrants who themselves are eligi
ble to admission. The educational test
was changed so as to admit any male im
! migrant otherwise qualified who can read
| and write the English or some other lan
i guage. The first agreement compelled
the immigrants to read and write tbe lan
! guage of their native or resident nation.
The sections relating to the coming of
"birds of passage," especially over the
Canadian border, have been changed to
read as follows:
Sec. 4. That it shall hereafter be unlawful
for any male alien who ha*, no; in good faith
made ids declaration before the proper court
of his intention to become a citizen of the
United Slates to be employed on any public
works of tne United States or to come regu-
I larly or habitually into the United States by
| land or water lor the purpose of engaging in i
i any mercantile trade or manual labor for
1 wages or salary, returning from time to time
! to a foreign country.
j Sec. 5. That It shall be unlawful for any
| person, partnership, company or corporation
I knowingly to employ any one coming into tlie
I United States if ln violation of the preceding
I section of this act; provided, that the provis
'. ions of this act shall not apply to the employ
! ment of sailors, deckhands or other empoyos
of vessels or railroad train hands, such as con
i ductors, porters, brakemen, firemen or bag
gagemen, whose duties equire them to pass
over the frontier to reach tne termini of their
runs, or to guides or pilots on lhe lakes and
rivers on the northern border of the United
States.
Sec. 6. That any violation of sections 4 and
5 of this act by any citizen shall be deemed a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceed
ing $500 or by imprisonment for the term not
exceeding oae year, or by both such tine and
Imprisonment in the d seretion of the court, \
provided that all persons convicted of a viola
tion of .cnion 4 of this act shall be deported
to the country whence they came. ; .
Sec. 7. That, notwithstanding the provision
of this or any other existing law. the Secretary
of the Treasury may permit aliens to enter
: this country for the purpose of teaching new
arts or industries under such rules and regu
lations as he may provide. . . - \---i
A new section was added as follows:
Sec. B.T hat lhiÂ« act shall not apply to persons
arriving in the United States from any port or
place in the island of Cuba during the con
tinuance of the present disorders there, who*
have heretofore been inhabitants of that
island. â¢
The conference report on the immigra
tion bill was agreed to â 162 to 14. A de
mand for the ayes and no. a was seconded
and this vote resulted: Ayes 217, noes 37.
Mahany (R.) of New York antagonized
the adoption of the conference report.'
The bill, he said, would admit freely an
archists, socialists and communists and at
the same time keep out God-tearing men
who, with their descendants, would make
good citizens of the Republic.
Barthold (R.) of Michigan, one of the
conferees who did not sign either report,
; expressed his gratification at the form
things had taken. Every objectionable
feature he bad to oppose last week had
been eliminated and the amen ments he
proposed in conference had been incor
porated into the bill. It met bis approval
now altogether, save as to the educational
requirement for immigrants who come in
as domestic servants, and be believed Con
gress would be compelled to make an ex
ception a. to them within a year.
Pending the discussion of the bill a
message was received from the Senate
conveying a concurrent resolution re
questing the President to return to Con
gress the Senate bill recently passed to
amend the act to repeal the timber-culture
law. On motion of Hyde (K.) of Wash
ington the House concurred in the resolu
tion.
Tne immigration bill was further dis
cussed, by Keifer (R.) of Minnesota, Ma
guire (D. ) of California and McCall (R.)of
Massachusetts, and the report was agreed
t0â 162 to 14.
A demand for the ayes and noes was
seconded. The vote resulted: Ayes 217,
noes 37.
Hooker (R.) of New York called up and
the House passed the Senate bill to amend
the river and harbor bill of last year so as
to give Admiral Walker, the naval mem
ber of the board to examine and report
upon the site for a deep-water harbor on
the Pacific Coast, the same mileage and
per diem as the civilian members of the
board.
The President's veto of the bill to grant
a pension to Rachael Patton, a soldier's
widow who afterward married and Is now
the divorced widow of her recent husband,
was called up by Wood (R.) of Illinois.
Advocating tbe passage of the bill Cum
mings (D.) of New York made a forcible
speech of a couple of minutes.
The bill was passed â the objections of
the President to the contrary notwith
standingâl 37 to 60.
Sulloway (R.) of New Hampshire called
up the bill to pension Caroline Mo watt,
which had been vetoed by President
Cleveland upon the same ground as in the
Patton case. 3jS_esi
Grow (R. of Pennsylvania submitted a
few remarks on the general subject of
pensions. Referring to these particular
cases he said it would be true that repub
lics were ungrateful if the executive
branch of the Government permitted the
present conditions to continue, which he
characterized a\ "an injustice to the liv
ing and a wrong to the dead."
The bill was parsed over the vetoâ l 43
to 55. PwBVPBEHHAAI

SENATE PROCEEDINGS.
The Arbitration Treat'j Again Discussed
Behind Closed Doors.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 9.â ln the
Senate to-day a resolution was reported
from the Committee on Contingent Ex
penses, and agreed to instructing the
Judiciary Committee to proceed with the
investigation in the matter of Charles M.
AmiUon, nominated to be District Judge
for the district of North Dakota.
On motion of Hoar (R.) of Massachu
setts, it was ordered that at 10 minutes be
fore 1 o'clock to-morrow the Senate shall
proceed to the hall of the House of Repre
sentatives to'take part in the count of the
electoral vote for President and Vice-Pres
ident of the United Mates.
The resolution offered yesterday by Pet
tigrew (Sil.) of South Dakota, withdraw
ing from the President a bill as to timber
culture land, was presented and agreed
to, Hill (I) ) of New York stating that the
question as to tht* constitutionality of
such withdrawal could be raised and de
cided when the bill came again before the
Senate, if the President should return it.
Senate bill appropriating $250,000 to aid
in the improvement of South Pas., by
closing the existing crevasse in Passe a
I' Outre in the Mississippi River was, on
motion of Cattery (D.) of Louisiana, taken
from the calendar and passed.
At 12:40 o'clocK, on motion of Sherman
(R.) ol Otiio, chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, the Senate pro
ceeded to the consideration of executive
! businessâ the Anglo-American treaty of
1 arbitration.
Morgan, who had the floor when the
Senate adjourned last evening, took up
his speech against the convention at the
point where he was broken off. There
was some discussion soon after the doors
were closed this afternoon about the un
usual publicity and accuracy relative to
the secret debate of yesterday, Vest call
in the attention of the Senate to the re
ports in the morning papers. The Mis
souri Senator said it was something: of a
farce for the Senate to refuse to open the
doors and then to find the debate re
ported as fully as if the reporters were in
the galleries.
He accused no one, but intimated that
he should like very much to know where
the leak was. Vest, however, did not as
certain the source whence the information
comes.
Several Senators coincided with Vest
and a general criticism was indulged in
for a few minutes in the hope that the
talkative Senators might, take the hint
and cease giving away executive secrets.
The Senate remained in executive ses
sion until 5:33 when adjournment was
taken until to-morrow.
HUGS IN A HrtRROR BILL.
Withington Acts JC luting to tiie ________
pi ovement of San Diego.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 9.â Senator
! Withington, who poses as a reformer of
! the most puritanical character on the
â  score of having been a member of the
! Legislature of the State of Massachusetts,
j lias broken the record for the number of
i "bugs".that can be concealed in a bill,
and a small bill at that. In a short docu
ment of eleven lines, providing, according
to its title for the improvement of San
Diego harbor, three "bugs" were neatly
entombed. While their covering was not
crystalline in clearness, it was yet suf
ficiently translucent to make visible on a
close scrutiny the real objects of the bill.
Originally the bill provided for the ap
propriation of $50,000 for, among other
things, a State wharf at San Dieao, the
legal expenses incurred in securing the
possession of tbe tide land*. in San Diego
Bay, and- otber indebtedness oi the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners for the
bay of San Diego. The State Committee
on Commerce reduced the appropriation
to $45,000.
Senator Withington's public spirit and
disinterestedness is shown by the fact that
he is the attorney whose "legal expenses"
are provided for ia this bill. It is pro
posed to construct, a State wharf to cost
$-5,000 out of the appropriation, though
reports say that a structure such as it is
intended to build will not last three years.
The only reason for its construction is
said to be to create a source of revenue out
of which the Harbor Commissioners of
San D.ego can secure their salaries of
$25 a month. While these salaries are
fixed by law no provision has ever been
made for their payment, it being intended
that, they shall come out of the revenues
of the office whenever there shall be any
duties to perform in connection with it.
By Witiiington's bill duties and revenue
will both he created, but the advantage to
San Diego, in view of the excellent wharf
facilities that already exist there, will be
difficult to discover.
As amended, however, by the Commit
tee on Commerce the bill was made to ap
propriate $-5,000 lor the wharf alone,
which is to be built under the direction of
the Harbor Commissioners. While Sena
tor Withington says be does not now hope
to be paid out of this appropriation, he
yet expects the State to compensate him
self lor his services. Although tie bill
was introduced by Witbington, and there
is a strong, suspicion that he can read
English, he stated to-dny that he was un
aware of the fact tbat the payment of his
services was provided for in the original
bill.
TO AID GAS COMPANIES.
Senator Linder Anxious to .Make Con-
sumer. Rut Up Deposits.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 9â Every
intending consumer. of gas in the State,
who is not a real estate owner, will be
compelled to pay a deposit of $2 50 or $5
before be is supplied with a meter, if the
bill introduced by Senator Under to-day
becomes a law. It provides that: "No
individual, firm or corporation furnishing
gas shall require any deposit from the
owner of any building in which and for
whom a meter is furnished, but upon the
request of a tenant or lessee of a building
or room, such individual, firm or corpora
tion may demand and collect a deposit
not to exceed $2 50 in cases where such
building or room contains ten or 1 ss
burners, and a deposit of $5 in cases where
the number of burners exceed ten."
Under the present law the gas companies
must put in a meter on demand within ten
days after a written request for the same
is made, or make tuemselves liable to
civil suit for pecuniary damages.
Deafness is more common in cold coun
tries than in warm climates, the ear being

VETOES THE BILL
Refuses to Approve the
Appropriation for State
Printing.
Declares That His Attempt to
. Secure Economy in the
O.fice Failed.
republican Assemblymen Do Not
Listen Patiently and Refuse to
Hear All of It Read.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. 9. â The
House was in committee of the whole dis
cussing the labor bill to-day when a mes
sage was received from the Governor.
Several amendments had been made to
the bill, the most important being that
the term of office of the Labor Commis
sioner was shortened to two years instead
of four years. North of Alameda oaid
the amendment should prevail if for no
other reason than it was a Republican
amendment.
"This experiment may be a failure," he
added, "and we may want to discontinue
it two years hence. I admit that the gen
tleman now in the office is a competent
man, but he is a Democrat, and that is
enough for us. We are willing that the
Governor may appoint him for two years,
but we wain to have the privilege of abol
ishing the office and appointing some one
else two years hence."
Just after this amendment had been
adopted Private Secretary McCabe and
Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms William
Lamphrey appeared in the middle aisle,
and after McCabe's presence had been
announced, he informed the House that
the Governor had returned without his
approval Leavitt's Assembly bill 263, ap
propriating $75,000 to rteet the deficiency
in the State Printing Office. The Gov
ernor also submitted a message on the
subject, which was handed up to the desk,
but was not read, such a proceeding not
being allowable in committee of the
whole.
No further notice was taken of the veto
and the message until the committee of
the whole rose and reported that it had
decided to recommit the labor bill to the
committee, thus blocking the progress of
what is understood to be the Governor's
pet bill.
This action was taken by the House in
a jiffy, and Clerk Duckworth proceeded to
read the message. When he had got half
way through further reading was dis
pensed with, and Leavitt of Alameda
moved to make the message the special
order for next Thursday afternoon at 2
o clock. In the meantime he said that
the members would have ample oppor
tunity to read the report, which would ap
p ar in to-morrow's journal.
Dennery raised a laugh by asking
whether there was sufficient money in the
S.aie printing fund to print the message
of the Governor. He thought that ii
might be well to adopt the Governor's
suggestion and have the message let out
â¢ by private contract to the lowest respon
sible bidder.
Caminetti then took up the fight of the
"minority and asked for the appointment
of a committee or to instruct the proper
committee to brine bark a report upon the
discrepancies in the State Printer's office
as aiieced in the Governor's message.
The speaker was about to explain some
thing in connection with the Governor's
attitude, when he was called to order by
Leavitt.
Dennery of San Francisco took the floor
on a question of personal privilege. "The
gentleman from Amador has made the
statement that he in not afraid to meet
the issue, he said. I will say to him that
he will have ample opportunity to meet
the issue next Thursday afternoon at 2
o'clock."
Mei.ck seconded the motion to lay over
the matter until Thursday. By that time
the committee would be able to tell
whether or not there was any money in
the State printing fund and also would be
able to make an estimate as to how much
money would be needed. Several wit
nesses, including the Governor, had been
subpenaed before the committee, but did
come. .
Caminetti returned to the charge and
moved that the Committee on Ways and
Means be instructed to make an investi
gation i ,to the apparent discrepancies
mentioned in the Governor's veto mes
sage and to have its report on the same
ready by next Thursday morning.
Emmons (Fusionist) seconded the nomi
nation. __*___*â¢Â§?â 
At this juncture Guy ot San Diego
thought that it would be more appro
priate to refer that matter to the Com
mittee on Public Printing. The Com
mittee on Ways and Means had already
reported favorably on the appropriation
and iiad given their reasons in full.
Dibble ended the matter by moving to
lay Cammetti's motion on the table, and
it was so ordered by _ vote of 39 to 24.
The matter was thereupon made the spe
cial order for Thursday afternoon.
Appended is Governor Budd's message
complete:
To the Honorable Assembly of the Stale of Cali
f Gentlemen: I return herewith Assem
bly bill No. 203 without my appro, aland with
my objections thereto. The title of the pro
posed act is "An act making an appropriation
ior the support of the State Printing Office for
the forty-eighth fiscal year," while it is in
tended that it shall serve the purpose oi a defi
ciency appropriation. Under th. provisions
of the act of March 23, 1893 (Statutes of 1893,
pnge2Ss), "No officer or employe in the serv
ice ol the State shall nave power to create any
deficiency in excess of any appropriation made
br law, except In case of actual necessiy, and
only then uuon the written authority first ob
tained of the Governor. Secretary of State and
Attorney-General, and any indebtedness at
tempted to ue created against the State in
violation cf the provisions of this act shall be
aosolulely null and void and shall not be al
lowed by the State Board of Examiners."
, Section 5 of the eeneral appropriation act of
1895 (Statutes 1895, page '289) is more com
prehensive, and provides that no such at
tempted indebtedness shall be paid out of any
State appropriations, and that the officer who
creates any such indebtedness without procur
ing the proper written consent shall be liable
therefor upon his official bond.
â¢ The superintendent of State printing has
not complied with the provisions of either of
the above acts; has not made to the State
Hoard of Examiners the required showing of
"actual necessity." nor has he obtained a cer
tificate "in writing, duly signed, by every
member of said board, of the unavoidable ne
cessity of such expenditure." By letter to
this office ol date February 3, 1897, Mr. John
ston, the superintendent, intimates tnat after
January 18, 1897, a deficiency existed in the
appropriation for the support of his office, his
language being : "I desire to say that up to
the 18th day of January there was no defi
ciency to the appropriation for the printing
office, and therefore there could be no appli
cation made to the Board of Examiners except
fra contemplated deficiency, which might or
might not occur, although in all probability
the amount of work tbat would devolve upou
this office by reason of the Legislature being
in session would require the expenditure of
more money than would be available."
Notwithstanding this statement, long prior
to the date of this letter, Mr. Johnston had
made a written application to tne State Board
of Examiners for a written recommendation
to the Legislature for the appropriation of
$75,000 asked for in the bill under discussion.
"Whan l sent for Mr. Johnston, requesting that
he should come before the board and be ques
tioned as to the necessity for the appropria
tion, on January 11, he withdrew his applica
tion and has not since appeared before the
HUNTINGTON WANTS TO COMPROMISE.
FR AXKFORT, Ky., Feb. 9.â The Southern Pacific Railroad has been awakened
by the contemplated suit of Attorney-General Taylor and has requested a conference
with the Attorney-General, who has prepared a suit which it was his intention to file.
H untington has engaged Messr*. Humphrey ond Davie, two of the most able lawyers
in Kentucky. They want a conference with General Taylor, and to-day held a com
munication with him by wire. They arranged for conference to-morrow, and it is
safe to say will offer compromise payment of taxes to the State. This will be refused
unless the road agrees to come up to the letter and spirit of the law, and it now looks
as if suit will be brought; and unless the road conforms to ths law a recommendation
for the repeal of the charter of the big company will be asked and contemplated by an
extra session of the Legislature.
board, asked for nor obtained the authority |
or consent of the board required by the acts of
1893 and 1895. above cited.
Assembly bill No. 203, if it received my ap- |
proval, would not amend or repeal these acts, I
nor does it attemtx, in words to do so, and j
claims or indebtednesses attempted to be con- i
tracted in violation of them would not be pay- j
able out of the proposed appropriation, nor
would future indebtedness attempted to be
incurred be so payab c until the requirements
o: the acts of 1893 and 1895 had been met. If
it Is proposed to exempt the Superintendent
of State Printing from the urovis ons of these
sets, to relieve him from his present legal ob
ligation to obtain the written consent of tho
entire Board of Examiners before he shall in
cur a deficiency, to relieve him from the per
sonal liability provided for in the act of 1895,
and to attempt to validate the indebtedness
incurred in violation of these acts, then the
proposed act is subject to the fatal constitu
tional objection Jthat it embraces more than
"one subject, which subject shall be ex
pressed in its title.'
If it is to meet a deficiency in an appropria
tion, if it is to serve as a relief bill for the
Superintendent of State Printing, and if it
attempts to validate indebieduos which the
law states shall be invalid, it unquestionably
relates to more than one subject to which
proper expression is not given and which is
not wise legislation. If my contention is true,
and the proposed act is intended to effect a
deficiency appropriation will fail to accom
p.lsh its purpose of paying deficiencies already
incurred, or which will be incurred, until the
provisions of existing laws relating to de
ficiencies are complied with by the officer at
whose instance it was passed. If it is not in
tended as a deficiency within the meaning of
the acts of 1593 and 1895, or if it is intended
to exempt ibÂ» Superintendent of 8 ate Print
ing and the indebtedness contracted Dy him
from the provisions of these acts, his can only
be accomplished by their amendment or re
peal, which is not effected or attempted. In ]
either case the funds attempted to be appro- |
priated by this bill would not be available for
the purpose intended.
This is not a merely technical objection, but
goes to the very integrity of our financial safe
guards. If the Superintendent of State Print
ing shall be exempted from the operation of
laws which experience has evolved and which
have proven wise and economic, who shall be
bound by them. Why discriminate between
the different departments of the State Govern
ment?
But I object to this bill on other than legal
grounds. Two years ago an effort was made to j
pay off all existing indebtedness and to place I
our institutions and affairs upon a cash basis.
I thought at that time that the annual appro
priation of $200,000, or less, would b_ suffi
cient for the support of the State Printing
Office for tbe next two fiscal years. I was
aware of the practice of superintendents to ap
ply for deficiencies during legislative years, i
when it was almost impossible to refuse them ;
when they have exhausted their appropria- â 
tion, and I sent for the Superintendent of State J
Printing, and upon his ler-onal assurance I
that he wou'd operate his office within the j
proposed appropriation, that he would i either i
allow nor create a deficiency, and with the !
understanding that 1 would not approve one, I
I made no objection to the allow*. of $250,
--000 for the support of his office and gave I
it my reluctant approval, it te.ng only the
second time when such a sum had been al.owed
for ihe support of that institution.
Early in the forty-seventh fiscal year I be- j
came impressed '.rith the idea that extrav- :
agance existed in the management and con
duct of the State Print'ng Office, which it was '
my duty to endeavor to reduce or prevent. !
The law explicitly requires the Superintendent 'â¢
t of State Printing to purchase only paper by j
: contract, leaving a large number of articles j
I and supplies to be purchased by him as be j
j may see fit. A comparison of the prices he !
was paying for such articles and supplies with i
the prices paid by other departments of the j
| State which were purchased under contract, i
j and also with his different prices to different
dealers, showed that he was paying in many
instances a considerably higher price than was
paid by the persons purchasing by contract,
February 20, 1895, the State Board of Exam
iners unanimously authorized m" to appoint i
a printing expert under_s_ction 079 of the Po
litical Code, the Attorney-General. Secretary J
oi State and the Governor being present, and
in the July following, learning that the force I
of the printing office had been largely ii -
creased, I appointed Fred A. Severy as Mich !
i expert. The salary of this < ffice was but $50 I
] per month, its duties then doubtful, and .Mr.
Severy resigned as expert and accepted a posi- j
sion under Mr. Johnston. The increase con- j
tinued until the payroll for the last two weeks j
of October amounted to about $9000 as .
against less than $4000 for the highest payroll i
of the June preceding; Immediately after the I
city election of 1895 it decreased rapidly, in..
number oi employes being reduced irom 150
on the last payroll In October to 71 on the i
first payroll in December. After this date the j
roll increased gradually until just prior to the l
end of the forty-seventh fiscal year. â 
In July, 1890. the State Board of Examiners,
Ml the usual affidavit, allowed a payroll, cov
ering July 1 to July 18, and learning later j
that during a portion of that time the State j
| Printing Office had been closed, and that the
employes had performed no service, at the j
j meeting of the board held July 23, 1890, Mr.
! Markeloy and the Governor being pre.-ent, I
I we considered the matter, and following the ,
resolution of February 20. 1895, C. M. Harri- ;
j son was elected as a printing expert. At
j tached to the claim which the Superintendent i
of State Printing presented for the dates from i
July 1 to July 18. was a statement that "the I
items constituting the claims herein were in- â 
curred in the manner and on the dates as
above shown, and that the services herein!
mentinned were actually rendered." This
i statement was signed and sworn to.
At the next meeting of the board the Super
; intendent of State Printing, on Invitation, ap
; peared before the board and admitted the
closing of the State Printing Office for about
twelve days during the time between July 1, !
and 18, and gave as his reason for the presen- :
tation of a claim lor services which had not
been rendered, that an equal amount of s.*r- j
1 ice had been performed by the persons on the
roll duriug the legislative session oi 1895, in |
working overtime, for which they had not \
been paid. The payrolls of 1895, being pro- \
duced, showed that some of tne persons whose i
names appeared upon this roil had already I
been paid for overtime in 1895, and that one j
of them was not on the payroll* during the
said legislative session. In explanation of this i
latter circums ance, the Superintendent said, j
iv effect, that those persons would have to !
work it out in overtime during the coining I
Legislature. At the same meeting, but at a
later hour, Mr. Johnston offered a further ex- !
planation, saying that the claim was put in to
cover the time ot a vacation which it was the i
practice to allow his regular employes, al
though all of the persons whose name ap- j
peared upon the objected-to roll were em
ployed by the day.
Before the selection of Mr. Harrison as print- i
ing expert, the Attorney-Genera- had given
his written opinion to the Controller in i
Seavery's case, that such appointment was I
legal. Immediately upon his appointment the j
question was raised as to his powers and duties,
and I communicated with the Attorney-
General, saying, among other things, the j
following:
"I am unwilling in the future to pass on the !
claims of the State Printer until they have i
been referred to some person for a thorough j
investigation as to their correctness, or
evidence be taken independent of the ordinary
affidavit. Oui Secretary, not being a printer,
cannot examine these matters properly. It
was for this reason that 1 wrote asking your â¢
views as to the expert's duties, but have re
ceived no answer thereto. If, in your judg
ment, his duties hce been abolished, 1 will
accept the situatiou; but, unless we have the
right to appoint an expert, boih should urge
the next Legislature lv provide for one."
On August 19, at a meeting of the State Board
of Examiners, Mr. Harrison appeared beiore it i
! and requested permission to examine the pay
roll of tne State Printing Office; the permission I
Â«aÂ« denied, nnd he made no further effort to j
perform th duties of priming expert
Since that time the members of the Board of I
Examiners other than myself have approved I
the claims or payrolls of the Superintendent of
State Printing. Not having a technical knowl- I
edge of the details of such an Institution, and
being convinced that unnecessary extrava
gance existed ln the management of certain
departments of the office, I have been unwill
ing to assume the. responsibility of sanction
ing the same.
The Attorney-General and the Secretary of
State have always en willing to join in a
personal examination of the State Printing
Office, and to thi*Â« arrangement Mr. Johnston
has readily agreed. As no member ot the
j board nor the Secretary possesses any special
or technical knowledge sufficient togive other
than a mperficial or ln_per__ct examination of
this office I have deferred action until the
meeting of your honorable body, hoping for a
chance in the laws regulating the State's
printing.
I have no personal. feeling in the matter,
and in my recent message to the Assembly and
Senate recommended that changes be made in
our system of public printing, to lake effect at
the expiration of the term of the In
cumbent. In view of the occurrences since
the assembling of the Legislature, I urge that
some change take place at once. While the
Legislature was considering my message I
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1897.
deemed it for the best interests of all parties
and the State that but sufficient money to pay
for State printing during the present session
of the Legislature should be appropriated. I
am now more strongly of that opinion.
Prior to January 11 last'tbe Superintendent
of State Printing filed with the Board ot Ex
aminers his application for a recommendation
to the Legislature for an appropriation of
$75,000. At the meeting of January 11. 1897,
he was sent for that he might make the show
ing required by the acts above mentioned,
and be examined as to the necessity for such
deficiency, whereupon he appeared, offered
no proof, but withdrew his application, and
the next any the bill under consideration was
introduced.
My information is that Mr. Johnston claims
that the work entailed upon him by tne new
ly created Bureau of Highways, the State
Dairy Bureau, the Code Commission and the
litigation of the Kailroad Commissioners, was
responsible for the exhaustion of his funds,
and necessitated the deficiency from which he
seeks relief. His recent official report me,
dated September 15, 1890, shows that for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, he had ex
pended of the appropriation for the support of
his office $140,000 59, or much more than
one-half of his total appropriation. Jn ad
dition he bad us.d of stock on hand
$12,085 79, making a total expenditure for
that year of $158, 050 35.
When it is remembered that the legislative
printing require.l fur that year for the thirty
lirst session amounted to over $7890 75,' and
tnatit was not the year upon which the bien
nial reports of the "state officers and institu
tions were printed, the fact is sufficient to put
the most indifferent upon inquiry. Mr. John
ston's explanation that it was the printing for
the new bodies which causes the deficiency
loses all its force when we find that the charge
for printing during that time for the Code
Commission, the Bureau of Highways find the
Dairy Bureau aggregated less than $550. The
heavy expenditure for the lorty-sev*. nth fiscal
year made the deficiency in tho forty-eighth
almost unavoidable. *
Section 531 of the Political Code requires
the Superintendent of suite Printing to make
a yearly report to the Governor, in writing,
"embracing a record of the complete transac
tion! of his office for the preceding fiscal year,
which report shall show in detail ail ihe items
of expense of the office, including repairs and
the purchase of materia s of ail kinds." Un
der section 0 of article Vof the constitution
the Governor is authorized "to require infor
mation in writing from the officers of the ex
ecutive department, upon any subject relat
ing to the duties of their respective offices."
When application was made to the Board of
Examiners for a recommendation to the Leg
islature for an appropriation. Mid . later, alter
such application had been withdrawn, and the
bill under discussion had bee.i introduced ln
the Assembly, I endeavored by every means to
secure a statement from the Superintendent
of State Printing, or a proper showing of the
: nece^Bity for the deficiency, or of the reasons
why this bill should become a law.
His report is incomplete and .in atisfactory
i At two meetings of the board succeeding the
Introduction of Assembly bill 203 Johnston
' was notified of such meetings and requested
i to appear and he failed to do so. I caused let
i ters to be written to Johnston soliciting infor-
I mation bearing upon this matter and nut con
tained in bis report and I failed to secure what
1 was required, the excuse being lack of time.
j On February 2, 1897, I personally communi
j cated with him, asking for his reasons for not
; complying with the requirements of the act of
1893 and why the pending bill should become
1 a law. 1 have exhausted my legal and consti-
I tutional rights in an endeavor tost cure the
i (sets necessary to enable me to act upon this
j matter with the proper degree of knowledge
i and, not being met by the explanation, 1 re
j turn the bill to you, with my objections there
; to, for further action, and 1 append the cor
i re-Â«pondence between Mr. Johnston and this
i office.
1 ask your attention to the reports of the
Superintendent of state Printing, where we
would expect to find a proper and thorough
account of the expenditures of tho funds for
the support of his office. For the forty-sixth
fiscal year Mr. Johnston expended and j
charges himself with $102,370 13, made up
of pay of employes, the purchase of material,
permanent improvements and like items, and
again-t this sum he credits himself with
printing to a like amount, his accounts for
that year balancing. (Pages 5, 10, 11 and 14,
report 1895.)
The report for the forty-seventh year shows
a very different state of facts. This was a non
legislative year, and Mr. Johnston expended
for employes, materia'***. Improvements and
like purposes $14*5,000 59, and credits himself
with oni,- $82,257 82 of printing done for all
] the departments of the State government.
i If to this we add the $4558 20 charged for
1 lithographing, which may not be included in
: the charges for printing" against the depart
* ments, and the $7890 75 for legislative print*
' ing, which both reports say is chargeable to
: the preceding year, the total credit amounts
! to $94,700 45. This leaves a balance ot $51.-
I 293 84 unaccounted for. If we crtdit Mr.
Johnston â¢ with repairs, imptovemeuts and
i permanent material, which would not be ac
cording to his system (pages 5. 10 to 14 of the
report of 1895), a balance of $39,295 20 yet re
mains to be accounted for.
Even if he claims a credit for sums ex
pended in permanent improvements and ma
terials, which he has not done in previous re
[ ports, and the cost of which he has charged
up to the printing done, he used during this
year $12,000 worth of stock with which he
should be charged.
We therefore have, according to his own re
port, a balance of $51,293 84 unaccounted for
from his appropriation, which, with the
$12,085 .76 oi stock used, makes a total of
$63,379 00. for which no account is made by
the Superintendent's report. I have no doubt .
that Mr. Johnson will be able to satisfactorily I
explain this matter, but as yet he has not
done so.
In this connection I wonld point out !
that the Legislature printing for the
forty-Â«eventh fiscal year amounted to
$90,148 55, while against this work was
charged $100,898 15 paid for pay of employes
alone, or $10,749 50 more charged for wages
than the entire work done, not counting the
material or supplies used. Even at these fig
ures, in which the amount charged for print
ing does not, nearly equal the cost of it, 1 am
1 convinced that such charges are excessive and
tnat if the work done was charged at the rate
at which it could be procured from private
concerns, the disproportion would be much
greater. The increased business and larger
number of documents required for difterent.
offices nave caused ln some instances an in
crease in their printing expenses. Having no
positive information ill other cases, I have
taken my own office as an example, and if the
i charges in other departments are as excessive
as tney have been in this instance, the charges
| made for workâ not to speak of the cost of the
| workâ is out of all proportion to what the same
class of work could be done for by private con-
I tract or individual enterprise.
The work I have had done includes the
; binding of a complete set of the reports of all
â  of tne officers and institutions oi the State
! from tne beginning of its history. This is an
invaluable collection and remains for the
permanent use of the Governor's office. The
remaining work done for this office has v been
in my judgment necessary. I submitted a
statemeut oi the work done for my office, not
1 including the binding of the books above
i mentioned, for which 1 was charged $4025 85
by the Slate Printing Office, to an expert
printer connected with one of ihe leading San
Francisco printing establishments. The ex
; pert was employed by Mr. James H. Barry of
l he Star, and he was furnished with the neces
sary description and samples for making an
estimate of the cost of the work. He was fur
nished no information as to the prices charged
by the Superintendent of State I'rlnting. and
wnere no sample of the work was supplied I
have allowed Mr. Johnston's prices. For the
work upon which I asked lor estimates Mr
i Johnston had charged me $4025 85; the
| amount at which the San Francisco printer
| estimated it could be done was $2013 30â
I considerable less than one-half ol the State
office charge. I will not attempt to locate the
reason for such excessive cost. That abuse
exists, there can be no question. *
On June 10, 1895, the State Board of Educa
tion passed a resolution directing the Super
intendent of State Printing to print no more
copies of a certain grammar until the further
order of the board. The State Board of Educa
tion is a separate constitutional body, with'
lull power and authority to adopt such reso- j
lution, and the Superintendent was in law
j bound by it. The reason of the resolution con
j cerned only the board, and the responsibility
rested exclusively with it. But notwithstand
; ing this resolution, by which he should have
I been legally bound, and In violation of lt, !
10,000 copies of the grammer were printed
] alter September, 1895. A new grammar has
| since been issued; but few of the old gram
â  mars are being called for, and there was on
hand February 1, 1897, 7019 copies of this
book, according to the official report of the
Superintendent of state Printing for the
month of January, 1897.
During the time from November, 1894, to
December, 1890, coal of the character and
grade used at the State Printing Office was be
ing purchased under contract for the use of
the engineer's department at the Capitol
building, at prices ranging from $9 25 to
$9 35 per ton. During this time the superin
tendent of State Printing was purchasing coal
of no greater value in open market at prices
ranging from $10 t.i $11 per ton. In May.
1890, the Board of Examiners insisted* that
the Superintendent should advertise for coal,
in addition to other supplies. Bids were re
ceived and opened in his office June 12. 1890.
he being present and acting with tbe board, to
award the contract, he being a member of it
for that purpose. The contract was awarded
the next day. to take effect July 1. The per
son from whom the coal had previously been
purchased did not get the contract, it'being
awarded to another party at $9 04 per ton.
The day the bids were opened Mr. Jonnston
ordered seventy-five tons of coal from the
party with whom he had been dealing. The
coal was delivered, but before it could be con
sumed the Superintendent had placed in his
office an electrical-power plant. This power
was contracted for in a most unsatisfactory
manner. The electrical company first com
municated with the Board of Examiners, re
questing that they be given a contract to fur
nish power for the State Printing Ofhee. The
board transmitted this communication to the
Superintendent of State Priming and re
quested that he should inform tnem what sav
ing, If any, would be effected by utilizing elec
trical power.
No answer was made to this communication,
and our next information upon the subject
was when claims were presented to the board
for the purchase of dynamos and electrical
apparatus, aggregating over $1500. There
alter a monthly claim of $230 was presented
to the board for allowance. This ciaim was
held for investigation, and later an oflicer of
the electrical company appeared before tho
board and stated that he had made a contract
with the State Printer to furnish fifty horse
power, or as much thereof as the Superin
tendent should require, at a monthly charge
of $230. He made such statements before the
board as showed that tne power was not being
used to economic advantage and read a long
statement showing how li could be more satis
factorily utilized. He declined to file this
statement with the board until he had sub
mitted it to the State Printer, with whom he
had been dealing. The statement was never
filed. The purchase of this electrical ap
paratus and plant has not reduced, as I under
stand it, the monthly expenses of that depart
ment for power, and has not resulted in a
saving to the State. It has reduced the
amount of coal purchased under the new ar
rangement and has prevented a comparison of
costs with the.previous arrangement.
As an evidence that the printing charged to
the departments in this State has not in
creased during the past year to any great ex
tent, although the cost of tbe printing offic;
has, I give the following amounts charged to
the various departments lor the last six years,
as follows:
Forty-second fiscal year. $93,499 63
Forty-third lisc-1 year 83.225 40
Fonv-fourth tisca year 82,834 ...Â»
Forty-fl Hi tiitcalyear .1,482 'Ah
Foriy-six ti cai year 92,759 25
Forty-seventh liicalyear 86,816 00
It is impossible for an inexperienced person
to estimate what. If any, extravagance exists
in the State Printing Office , and the testimony
of inexpert persons possesses little value.
The Superintendent oi Slate Printing lv his
report and his letters to mc states that a record
is preserved in his office of all work done by
him. These books should show the capacity
of the presses, the number of impressions pos
sible in a day, and number and capacity of
the compositors and the quantity and charac
ter ot binding done in any stated time. From
this record the exact cost of any particular
piece of work could be readily ascertained
by an experienced person. As I have not re
ceived the Information requested from the
State Printer I am consirained to rely upon a
statement from Mr. W. M. Taylor, at present
of San Francisco, and formerly employed as
foreman of the State Printing Department,
whose ability and capability Mr. Johnston has
certified to without qualification in his report
(Report 1893-94, page 20). Speaking of the
fiscal year, ending June 30, 1890, Mr. Taylor
sa'-s:
'It is true that the rates paid in the State
Printing Oflice are rather hh.h. and in some
cases extravagantly so, but if the difference
between these rates and these paid in Sun
Fraucisco were calculated the figures would
be an insignific mt factor in the total of waste.
On the labor side of the question of economy
in tho conduct of this department the exces
sive expenditures are caused uot so mucn by
the rate paid to each workman, but almost
wholly by the unwarranted number of hand
employed to do the limited amount of work.
Tnis is illustrated by a late experience in th
office, and may be recounted as follows:
"This is the 'off' fiscal year in printing for
the Stateâ no reports, no legislative work, etc
Pending the recent canvass of the election of
Mayor, etc., in Sacramento it was thought
necessery to give employment to about 100
i 'iris in the bindery. These girls were paid
$10 to $12 per week. These figures may be
verified by the Controller's and Treasurer's
books. The office contained seven presses,
which do the printing to keep these girls m
ployed. The remaining four presses are for
.-mull jobwork. The capacity of these presses
is about 0500 impressions per day of eight
hours; total, 45,000 per day. Messrs. Phillips
& Whelan, bookbinders here, stato that their
girls fold * 3000 in nine hours each; lor eight
hours this is about 2050. From the 100 girls
deduct ten for miscellaneous work, leaving
ninety folders, wh eh multiplied by 2050
makes a total of 238,500 sheets, which they
should fold per day, against 45,000 printed
per day.
â¢â¢Pressesâ Capacity. 4500 sheets per; day;
number of presses, 7; total capacity, 43,000
sheets per day.
Capacity, 2050 sheets per day; num
ber of gir.s, 90; total capacity, 233,500 sheets
per day.
"Forty-five thousand sheets divided among
90 gir.s equals 500 sheets per day each; 45.
--000 .sheet.-* divided by 2050 (a fair day.- work
lor one giri) equals 17, the actual number ot
girls requited, showing the employment of
live and a third times too many.
"Seventeen girls from 90 girls, 73, at an
average wage ot $11 per week, equals a waste
of $803 per week.
"As a matter of fact, the presses do not aver
age 4500 per day. I make no pretense that
these figures are absolutely exact."
There is no reason why the printing of this
State should cost so much more than it does in
other States, nor why the price of ink and
material in the State Printing Office should be
so much greater than at the public printing
office nt Washington, D. <_. in Indiana the
public printing i 3 let by contract and ccsts
about $50,000 annually. in Illinois the last
biennial expenditure for th-. t purpose was
printing $52,000, binding $28,000, book and
cover paper $10,000. In Wisconsin and Michi
gan the public printing Is let by contract. In
the latter Stat.* the cost for 1894-95 for print
ing and binding was $119,000, stationery
$50,000 additional, including stock, In Wis
consin the cast for two years' printing. includ
ing stock and printing of Blue Book nnd
census, was $117,241. The three States, Wis
consin, Michigan and Illinois, with a census
population of over 7,500,000 people, pay but
little more for their biennial printing than
does the State of California, wltn a census
population of less than 1,250,000.
In the table of expenditures issued by the
University of NtW York for the years 1890-91
the cost of the public printing of every Slate
in the Union is given, and it shows that in
California the cost for thai purpose is many
times greater than in other States. I append
that int. le.
I believe that a bill should be passed appro
priating sufficient money for the printing re
quired by the Legislature; that in the mean
time we may consider what, if any, changes
should be made In the system of the State
Printing Office or in the lobulation of Its ex
penditures. I believe that piovision should
oe mode ior thecmploymentof an experienced
end capab'.o person as a printing expert, with
such power and authority as would enable him
to examine or investigato all work done or ex
penditures made on account of our public
printiug, and to report to the Board of Exam
iners upon all claims for printing presented to
them for allowance.
1 would suggest that for the next two years
specific appropriations be made to each de
partment or office of the State requiring print
ing of an amount equal to half of the yearly
average amount enarged against them for
work done during the preceding four years
and that they be permitted to procure such
printing as tney may require at establish
ments owned by private parties by contract or
otherwise as you may requiic, their claims to
be subject to the allowance of the Board of
Examiners. â¢â¢ * '"
I would recommend no Interference with
the authority of the Superintendent of State
Printing other than as above stated, but at
tho expiration of his term, I believe, as I
stated in my recent message, thai great econ
omy would result irom the letting of our pub
lic printing by contract to the lowest binder.
A striking instance of the lax methods pur
sued in the State Printing Office came to mv
attention while considering tho bill under
discussion. In response to a request to the
Superintendent of State Printing to furnish
me with a statement of the items of charge
against my predecessor and myself for print
ing I received a statement of date January 27.
1897. Every article which I have ever ordered
from this office is carefully charged.
As to the account of my predecessor i have
little data from which to verify it, but few ex
penses for lithographing are charged against
him. . We commenced our orders on No. 21 oi
the -orders of his order-book, there being
eighteen preceding orders for printing given
during the last few months of his administra
tion, of which out one order is charred to his
account in the statement made me. When the
meager data at my command show such extra
ordinary irregularities I cannot when coupling
the same with other tacts herein set forth
approve a bill that exempts the printing office
from the explanations required by the laws in
applying for a deficiency.
I regret the necessity which requires this
attitude of apparent antagonism toward you,
and ln returning this bill without my ap
proval disclaim any purpose other than to
subserve the public welfare.
I cannot sanction the incurring of an in
debtedness by an officer, of our State govern
ment without necessity and in conflict with the
provisions of the act from which he derived bis
official support.
TAXPAYERS TIRED
OF BEING BLED
Too Many Bills to Create
New Commissioners for
the State.
Great Opposition Shown to the
Scheme to Build a Series of
New Highways.
Treacy Says the Whole Bill Is "a
Rob en the City aad County of
San Francisco."
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 9.â There
are a large number of bills now before the
House . creating new commissions and
perpetuating the old, all the commission-,
ers to be appointed by Governor Budd
and the majority of them to be Demo
crats. The? commissioners to be created
by the bills before the House .or whose
existence is [to be perpetuated by them
are Warehouse Commissioners, Highway
Commissioners, Labor Commissioners,
Code Commissioners, Commissioner on
Public Works, Sociological Commissioner,
Exposition Commissioners and many
more too numerous to be remembered
among the 800 odd bills now before the
Assembly.
Many of the most thoughtful Republi
cans in tne House have determined to
make a material reduction in taxes beiore
the close of the session, and they will to
that end lop off all or nearly all of those
commissions which have the faculty of
absorbing large quantities of public
money with nothing to show for it except
a very small quantity of biennial reports.
To-night the joint Committee on Roads
and Highways met in the Assembly cham
ber for the purpose of considering tbe
State highway bill. It provides for the
appointment by the Governor of three
Commissioners to lay out a system of
State highways. The sub-committee pre
sented a substitute reducing, the commis
sion to one member, and placing in his
bands simply the power to work in con
junction with the Surveyor of each county,
in the State. Highway Commissioner
Maud made a speech to .the committee
upon the merits of the original bill.
' Caminetti of Amador opposed the sys
tem of State highways. They would not
do in Amador County. What his people
wanted was good roads to Sacramento and
Stockton, so that they could haul, their
products to those towns in competition
with the Southern Pacific Company,
whose rates on the branch lines and spurs
were so high that the farmers to-day were
successfully competing with wagons
against the railway company, notwith
standing the muddines3 and otherwise
bad condition of the roads in that county.
Price of Sonoma opposed the bill and
favored the substitute. The bill took the
control of the roads out of the hands
of the county authorities. He was a
farmer and had an interest in good roads,
and his constituents had expressed their
opinions to him. It would ; not be politic
or wiso to take the roads out ol the bands
of the counties to remove them farther
the people. Added to that there was the
great expense of $3000 each to three Com
missioners, $-800 to a secretary and $1500
to a stenographer, besides other items.
The substitute required county surveyors
and Supervisors to furnish data to one
Highway Commissioner, who should act
in each county jointly with the Surveyor
and Supervisors.
"My people in Sonoma County," added
Mr. Price, "are sick . and tired of the
creating of these commissions to dip their
hands into the public purse.
Ennis of Sacramento was opposed to
the Supervisors building roads. Super
visors in Sacrament d had spent $50,000 on
roads and had not a decent highway in
the county. Thay had been conspicuous
failures, as the Supervisors of most of the
other counties had been failures as road
builders.
Treacy of San Francisco could not see
how San Francisco could be benefited by
being taxed for the benefit of the farmers.
Caminetti remarked that whenever
three men are in office for three or four
years they work to perpetuate themselves
in office. That was the reason why the
ll way Commissioners were opposed to
the substitute cutting down the number
to one.
"Those three commissioners evidently
expe.t to succeed themselves." He said
also tha.t the original bill proposed the
building up of an army of employes Dy
the Highway- Commissioners. It would
be cheaper to have three commissioners
and oblige them to do all the surveying
and engineer work themselves than to
have one commissioner and allow bim to
hire an army ot men to do the work lor
him. According to the admission of the
Bureau of Highways twenty years would
De quired to build all the toads outlined
in the bill. His people and the people of
other counties were opposed to being
taxed for nineteen years before they
would receive a mile of road. Under lhe
substitute the system of State highways
would lie begun in each county in the
State simultaneously. Another objection
to the ill was that the system of proposed
State highways ran parallel nortn and
south, and that there were no crossroads
â none running east and west. â¢ Under the
substitute bill a State highway must run
from the county seat to the county seats
of all the counties adjoining.
Commissioner; Maud said that he and
another commissioner had observed a
coolness toward the commission on the
part of Mr. Caminetti, and that was prob
ably the reason why the bureau did not
call on the gentleman from Amador.
Melick lamented the coolness existing
between the commissioners and certain
members of the Legislature. He had
come to the Assembly witn a feeling that
the bureau should be wiped out, but he
thought it should have a fair hearing and
a thorough investigation. Mr. Caminetti,
be added, had overlooked the fact that
the mountains and valleys of California
ran north and south instead of east and
west, and that that was the reason why
the great lines of the proposed State high
ways ran northerly and southerly.
Commissioner Mauson said the bureau
would lay before the sub-committee all
tbe data in tbeir possession and would
gladly co-operate with them.
The committee adjourned until Thurs
day evening.
Afier the adjournment of the meeting
Treacy of San Francisco said to a Call
reporter: "The whole bill isa rob on the
City and County of San Francisco. We
have to pay for our own streets and out of
our own funds. I shall oppose both the
bill and the substitute on the floor of the
House wben it comes up."

and the bill passed. '*_/â â 
Speaker Coombs announced that the
record showed only fifty-three members
instead of fifty-four, as he supposed last
night, voted to suspend the constitution.
The clerks were investigating and if the
facts were as now appeared the bills passed
last night would have to be voted on
again.
Dennis Jordan's claim bill was taken up
and Caminetti spoke in favor of and Cutter
in opposition to the bill.
After speeches in favor of the bill by
Leavitt, Shanahan and Melick, the previ
ous question was ordered and the Jordan
claim was passed by 51 ayes to 8 noes.
A message from Governor Budd was
received, announcing his approval of the
Guatemala exposition and bicycle bills,
also the bills relating to railroads 5000 feet
above sea level.
Speaker Coombs here announced that
the error had been discovered in the roll
call last night. The error was corrected,
malting the necessary fifty-four votes and
obviating the necessity of passing the
claims bills again.
The Governor's message accompanying
his veto of the printing bill was taken up
in the Assembly at 3 o'clock this after
noon. The message was only partly read,
the further reading being dispensed witn
on motion, as it will be printed in the
journal. After the motion was carried
Dennery raised a laugh by moving to let
the printing of the message out by con
tract, stating it was apparent that the
printer had not sullicient funds to print
such a lengthy document.
Caminetti replied that the lack of funds
was not created by the Governor. Upon
motion, the consideration of the bill and
message was made a special order for
Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
. The second reading file was taken up
and partly read.
The morning session of the Senate was
entirely devoted to argument on the
various articles in the new county govern
ment act. Morgan continued his speech
against the measure.
The Senate consumed the afternoon con
sidering the county government act, that
portion of the act relating to specific
salaries occupying most of the time.
When time came for adjournment
Mahoney introduced a resolution provid
ing for the printing in pamphlet form of
the testimony taken by the San Francisco
delegation in considering the carfare bill.
The resolution was voted on and lost.
Several bills were introduced out of
order, among which was one by Dwyer
providing for the use of convict-worked

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. Ferry
commuters will be interested in the bill
introduced to-day by Senator Toner. Its
principal provision is as follows:
Any transportation company selling oris
suing commutation tickets of any kind or
character shall be compelled, to recognize
them at any time when presented for passage
by the person entitled to use the same, if pre
sented during the limitation or lite of the
ticket.
At the present time a commuter who
fails to use his ticket on any day during
the month loses the unpunched portion
of his ticket. Thus, if the holder of a
commutation ticket fails to use bis ticket
on Sunday he cannot travel back and
forth twice on any other day during the
mentb. Under the proposed law it will
be possible for a commuter to make as
many return trips during the month as
there are days in it, and such trips can be
made on any day or days as suit, his con
venience.

half-breed is fleeing from two posses of
man-hunters. The miming man are Munn
Davis, a well-known mining man and
machinist of tbis city, and James L.
Steams, a locomotive engineer ia the
Southern California Railway's employ,
who bad been on a vacation for some
months.
These men, in company with Major |
Greenwait and Frank F. Barnes of this j
city, left San Diego on Novemter 23 to j
pro.pect, locate and develop certain prop- j
er. <:- along the Colorado River. Arriving
at Rioville they left Barnes and proceeded
on to Spanish Bar. To-day a letter was
received from Barnes, dated the 4th inst.
at Rioville. It stated that an Indian run
ner id just arrived from the camp, bring
ing a letter irom Major Greenwait giving
the information tbat six days before an
indian half-breed named Mouse had ap
peared at the tent and shared the hos
pitality of the miners. The next morn
ing he volunteered to show the men a
. copper ore prospect but a short distance
away.
Davis buckled on his revolver and both
men started out, not stopping to even put
on their coats. Greenwait watched his
partners disappear over a neighboring
hillock and neither he nor any other
Thite man, so far as known, has seen
them since. Sixteen hours later Mouse
was discovered in the act of stealing a
valuable horse from Postmaster Bowrell
at Rioville, but beforeashot could be fired
be galloped out of range. It has since
been learned that a day prior to his visit
to the three miners be stole a horse and
nfle from a stage-driver near Vegas
WÂ«Â«.b, but in crossing the river his horse
became red and was left to die.
Teiegran.3 received to-night state that
Mouse is wanted for rut: rder in Modoc i
County, and that there are four killings I
charged against him.
George W. Beermaker left to-night for
San Bernardino, wbere he will join ex-
Ehenff Bowman and the She of San
Bernardino County. Together they will
hunt on the desert for Mouse, whom they
believe to be the slayer of their friends,
and who is probably hiding somewhere on
-the desert. Barnes has already started
on the trail with a party of man-hunters,
Davis' wife was prostrated by the new-,
and Steams' mother, who lives with her
two sons, J. Roy and W. F. Steams, has
thus far been kept in ignorance of the af
fair.
Mouse is a half-breed Mexican and In
dian, 5 feet 2 inches in height, with black
eyes and a heavy black moustache.
SHORT SESSION AT SALEM.
MitchelTs Managers Force an Adjourn
ment to Prevent a Slump From
His Following.
SALEM, Oe., Feb. 9.â The Legislature
met in joint session and was called to
order by Senator Brownell at noon. Just
as calling of the roil began, , senator
â¢ Patterson ran in and moved that the roll
call be dispensed with and tbat the joint
session adjourn until noon to-morrow.
It appears that two Democrats who re
cently went to Mitchell were not in at
tendance, and the report that three
Mitcbeliites intended to make speeches
and withdraw irom his force became
current. For these reasons a sudden ad
journment took place. This report is evi
dently well founded, as the anti-Mitcheli
ites are all smiling, while the Mitcbeliites
are correspondingly dejected. It is plain
that no reconciliation can be effected.
It has just developed that ex-Governor
Pennoyer has written a letter calling upon
the Populists to support Mitchell. Hi
advice will not be heeded, as the Populists
bave lost all faith in Pennoyer.

ROMANCE OF ASTORIA.
Not Knowing That Her Husband Had In
herited a Fortune Mrs. Zaroni
Elopes With a Gambler.
PORTLAND, Ob-, Feb. 9. â Miguel
Zaroni. an erstwhile Astoria fisherman,
who has just returned from a six months'
visit to Italy, is in sole distress.
When he departed from Astoria for his
native land, three months ago, he left be
hind a wife ana two children, and in the
woman's keeping was $2300 hard-earned
cash.
Zaroni says that bis domestic life had
never been clouded by any discord, and
he always befiered himself possessed of
the undivided affections of his wife, who
wa3 very exclusive and a-s.c_.ted very lit
tle with her countrywomen.
So wben he returned to Astoria last
I always be.iered himself possessed of
_Â»ns of his wife, who
very exclusive and a-_.ciated rei
rith her country women.
> wben ba *_> turned to Astoria laÂ§:
irday Jrom Eutone and fo*ind bia
borne locked and barred, and his wife _:.
babies absent, be was greatly surprised.
His â  irpriaa was soon changed into
despair when an Italian friend handed
him a letter from his wife, dated a fort
night ago, in which she avowed her pur
pose to elope with Michael Ivancovicb, a
Slavonian gambler, whoie acquaintance
she had formed during her husband's ab
sence.
In the letter the woman added that she
would split in two what remained of the
little fortune the huÂ«band left in her
care â then amounting to â depositing
flC__* in the hands of the friend with
whom she left her farewell letter.
In conclusion tbe faithless wife wrote
tbat sbe waa going to live in San Fran
cisco with left her l__zewt_.il letter. while
a conclusion the faithless wife wrote 'â¢
t she wan going to iive in San
:o with Ivancovicb. and that, while
Zaroni had always been a kind husband
to her, nothing would induce her to re- ]
turn to him. .She was tired of him.
Zaroni said that when be read these
| lines he felt as if the blood in bis veins
had turned to ice. He came to Portland I
on the Sunday morning steamer for a con- j
snltation with his friends.
Zaroni claimed that on the eve of his j
departure from Italy a wealtny uncle of j
â  his died in Florence, bequeathing to him j
[a sum equal to $15,000 in American I
money.
Zaroni added that now all he had to j
live for ware his two children. He felt
certain tbat his wife had written |
the truth about going to Ban Fran- j
ci-_co, whither he would follow tbis
evening or to-morrow to gain po.s.ssion i
of tbe litile ones. If his present mood
has not changed wben his reaches the
has not changed when be reaci.es the bay
| he is more than likely to attempt to kili
Ivancovich.
TACOMA PREACHER CENSURED.
Pastor Hamman's Resignation Accepted
by the Members of His
Flock.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 9.â Tbe congre
gation of the First Baptist Churcb, by a
vote of fifty to seven, to-night accepted
the resignation of Pastor N. H. Harriman.
The acceptance took the form of resolu
tions, which recited that during the Jan
uary period of religious excitement Mr.
Harriman preached certain doctrines not
in accordance with those held by the
church, and permitted and encouraged
scenes in the church which brought the
cburch and religion into ridicule and dis
repute.
TDe resolutions said that January 22
Pastor Harriman publicly declared he
would not again hold services in the
church, "Until the demons were cast out
of the members of bis congregation."
They continue: "He on that and other
occasions has accused some of our most
spiritual member.-, of demoniacal posses
sion."
It is alleged further that since January
25 he has held daily meetings only three
blocks from the church, thus gathering to
himself another body of believers in op
position to the church.
Mr. Clark, a prominent churchman, re
counted the scenes enacted at the meet
ings held by Mr. Harriman and Rev. Peter
Robinson of San Francisco, and alleged
tbat Mr. Robinson delivered a prayer jn
which he said: "Oh Lord, if they will
not accept this aanctification, let them be
lost, let them be lost." Mr. Clark thought
such a prayer widely -at variance with
Christ's teachings.

BACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. 9.â Matters
are becoming very lively around the halF
of legislation, and the breaking of the
monotony, even though it may involve
the breaking of a head or two, is received
with satisfaction. Joe Brook*., one of the
Assembly attaches, and Long John Wil
kins had a war of words last night, and
Brooks was arrested early this morning
on complaint of W.lkins on a charge of
disturbing the peace.
Long John has a friend in the person of
John Wyilie. the Governor's colored mes
senger. Wyliie is as tall, as black and as
sinewy as PeW Jocksou. This afternoon
during the reading of the Governor's mes
sage in the Assembly Wyilie and Brooks
met in the hallway near the entrance to the
Assembly chamber and came to blow..
Tney were separated by Assistant Ser
geant-at-Arms L%mphrey before any dam
age was done. Brooks is a small man be
low the average height, but he held up his
end of tbe fight very well.
The origin of the trouble was praciic.l
joking on the part of several attaches. It
appears that Long John Wilkins look pos
session of one of the gentlemen's rooms
about the beginning of the session, and
from that time to the present has kept it
clean, with the expectation of being placed
on the permanent roll before the end of
the session, his pay to begin from the date
of his taking charge of the room in the
capacity of rear porter. The trouble re
garding the alleged excess of attaches pre
vented Wilkins being placed on the roil,
but he has hope. Several waggish at
taches have been twitting Wilkinslabout
his position, and Wilkins accused Brooks
of being the ringleader. The whole of tho
San Francisco Assembly delegation have
been subpenaed by Brooks to appear in
the police court to-morrow to testily to
bis good reputation.

POUT TOWNSEND, Wash.. Feb. 9-
A:.ot_.er instance of tbe cruelty and pri
vations to which American sealers wno
chance to fall into the bands of
Russian officers on the Siberian coast
are subjected has come to light in
a communication which was re
ceived here to-day by a well-Aown sealer
of this cur from a former companion,
who is now incarcerated in a Russian
prison at YiadlTostock, on the coast of
Siberia. Tne writer is one of the party of
seventeen Americans wbo were taken into
custody by Russians on Robin Island.
These men were members of the crew of
the schooner pans. Oa tbe 30th of Oc
tober, 1886, the schooner pot into Robin
Island to repienish its water supply. Sev
enteen men went ashore with the casks.
tut -fere they were filled a storm came
on, forcing the ._aipac3 to put to sea,
leaving the men ashore. Tbey remained
on tbe island for a week in idleness until
one day. before the schooner could re
turn, the Russian gunboat Yakntsb
steamed into the harbor and dropped an
chor. Its advent, wbic;. the Americans
hailed with joy, booing to be taken back
to civilization, proved the beginning of a
series of misfortunes for them that have
not ended yet. Tbe officer who came
ashore refused to believe the men's story
that tbey bad been marooned, but accused
them of killing seals in Russian posses
sions. The entire party was taken aboard
the Yakutsh and landed at Vla-i.vostocK,
where they were sentenced on January
24 of last year to five months' impris
onment.
During their term of servitude tbe
United States steamer Olympia visited
Yladivostock, bat failed to procure t^e
American prisoners' release. The day
when sentence would expire was looked
forward to with pleasant anticipation, but
its coming was only the opening for fur- |
ther trouble. In the morning the men
were taken to Irkutsk, where, after atrial
before the bigh court on some charge of
which they are yet ignorant, they were
again sentenced to eighteen month's servi
tude. This time they were required to
labor.
The men are at present employed ss la
borers on fortifications now in course of
construction around the Siberian capitaL
The letter bringing this information was
smuggled into the possession of a Rus
sian prisoner, whose term had expired,
and by whom it was mailed at Kobe, to
gether with one to San Francisco, to the
mother of the writer, Frank C. Hill.
The names of the unfortunate Americans
are : Frank C. Hill, James Mahoney, JJanies
McCarthy, James Riley, Henry Ross,
Charie3 Nelson, Harry Carlson, Charles
Evans. Alex Learche, Samuel Bush, Ar

ALPINE DISTRICT THUGS.
George Green, One of the Destroyers of
Bodies Home, Will Escape With a
Light Sentence.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. 9.â George
Green, one of the trio which one night in
December last looted and burned the
bouse of Baptista Bodie in the Alpine dis
trict, was permitted in the Superior
court to withdraw bis plea of guilty to the
burglary charge against him and substi
tute a plea of guilty to the lesser
offense of petty larceny. This disposes
of a cate which in some respects is
unparalleled in the history of thh county,
and in wbich were combined the offenses
of burglary, arson and, but for the inter
vention and interference of Green, what
micht bave proved murder.
Tne trio, Boyce, Tann ana Green by
name, went to the Bodie House, which
at the time was occupied by an old French
man named Frank Shuraet. Tann called
Shumet to the door.
He was taken and bound and blind
folded, Tann threatening to kill him and
throw bun into an old well. He was led
to a spot 200 yards distant and tied to a
tree. After ransacking the bouse, it was
set on fire.
Shumet's blind was removed and he was
permitted to view the destruction of the
building, an eight-room cottage.
Before leaving the old man some one
suggested that they gag him and let him
strangle by slow decrees.
Here Green interfered, saving Shumet's
life.
All three were arrested for the crime.
Green made a full confession to the officers
and pleaded guilty to the charge of burg
lary.
Tann also pleaded guilty to the same
offense. Boyce pleaded not guilty, was
tried by a jury and convicted of burglar y
in the first degree after a trial lasting two
days, l'ann was sentenced to *ye years
in San Quentin; Boy cÂ« was given fifteen
years.

certain specific bequests are paid.
The sum that would remain for distri

something like $1,000,000. but the estate

emanating from quarters close to the

DRANK CARBOLIC ACID.
Emma McQuod Suddenly and
Unaccountably Ends H?r
Life.
The Suicide Was in Apparent Gaol
Spiritsâ She Assigned No Caus
lor H-r Act
Emma McQuoid, a young woman of 28,
drank carbolic acid with suicidal intent
late last evening and died within half an
hour.
' The young woman had no apparent
reason to take her life, and the only cause
for the deed which any one is willing to
assign is that she was tired ot the life she
was leading and saw in suicide her only
means of escaping it.
Her father, aged 80. is a paralytic. Her
mother, aged 70, is an invald to whom age
has given added ills, and the care of the
household rested on the daughter.
A Mrs. Martin, who lives opposite the
McQuoids, was the first to discover the
suicide. She intended to call at the
house, nnd as she entered without tbe
formality of knocking she saw the young
.woman drink something.
' She a?k__. what it was, and she was told
it was poison. Doctors were summoned
at once, but when they arrived it was too
late. fiRR
The McQuoids seem to be fairly well-to
do people. They live at -208 Shotwell
street in a comfortable bouse. There was,
besides the parents and the daughter, a
son about 23 years of age.
. Theories as to the cause of suicide are
not wanting, but the only one given any
credence so far is that , the young woman
became despondent over so much care
and sickness in the house and sought the
suicide's refuge. :'â '

One Party Reaches the Coast Aft r
an Adventurous Trip From
Circle City.
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. aâ The steam
ship Topeka arrived from Southern
Alaska ports early this morning, bringing
the latest Yukon advices. Among its pas
sengers were P. C. Richardson, A. E. Carr,
J. McComber and N. Giliis, who bave just
completed a long winter journey from the
interior, having left Circle City on tbe
ISth of November. They traveled with
the mercury at 40 degrees below zero â 70
degrees below the freezing pointâ and
reached Dyea oc the southeast Alaska
coast on January 23.
The YuKon country is prospering. Some
new strikes am reported, but owing to
failure in getting sufficient supplies last
fait before tbe river froze up seme kinds
of provisions are scarce at several of the
camps.
Forty-mile is short on flour and not
over 100 p-bunds is sold to any one person,
while some miners procured none at all.
Professor Richardson, in speaking of the
trip, said:
"The second day out, at noon, on Jan
uary I, we met H. Day and a Mr. Howe :
on their way down the river, carrying tbe I
United Stales mail. They were entirely
out of provisions, and having turned their
dogs loose, were drawing their sleds them
selves. They had thrown away the greater
part of their outfit. We gave them enough
provisions to last until they reached
Peliy, twenty-five miles distant, and they
left everything but the food where we met
tbem, going on to Peiiy empty-handed,
intending to recuperate themselves and
their dogs and return for tbe sled and
outfit.
"We continued on our journey without
event until January 12. wben we overtook
at the mouth of the Hootalinqua, 210 miles
from Dyea, the Nash party, consisting of
Nash of Portland, William McCowley of
Seattle and two Indians, who had left
Cloudyke on December 4, seventeen days
before our party. They* were in an ex
hausted condition, having abandoned
aleds, tent, stoveâ ln fact, everything ex
cent what they could pack on their backs.
They had been on short rations for two
weeks and had but two days' provisions
left. Their situation was critical, for, ex
hausted as they were, tliey were making

"Henry Hyde of Juneau and "Shorty'

"At the foot of Mud Lake we found a
party of eight Oaklanders in winter quar

Hootalinqua. They liberally supplied us
with needed provisions from their well
stocked larder.
"The latest excitement in the Yukon is
the discovery of gold In Cioudyke district.
It was made on Bonanza Creek, a tribu
tary of the Cioudyke River, on August 17,
cy G..W. Carmack and two Indiansâ
Skookum Jim and Takish Charley. A
second discovery of importance was
made on El Dorado Creek. a
large branch of Bonanza Creek,
on August 25, by J. Whipple and
Messrs. Clements and Keller. A third
discovery was made on Adams Creek, an
other large tributary of Bonanza Creek,
on August -6, by Mr. Adams, and a fourth
di co very was made on Hunker Creek, a
tributary of the Cioudyke, on September
7. by Andrew Hunker and C. M. Johnson.
At the time our party left, the principal
development had been on Bonanza and
El Dorado creeks, and all claims opened
up showed pay dirt. Some of them are
rich beyond anything discovered in the
Yukon country. In the new discoveries
the majority of claims are held by men
who went in last year.
"Provisions are exceedingly scarce.

The Pomp'adoured Heavy - Weight

CARSON, Nev., Feb. 9. âAnxiety is
rapidly reaching white heat in this city
.because of the persistent refusal of Dan
Stuart, manager and promoter of tbe
â¢ promised greatest of all fistic battles, to
arrive here on schedule time. Stuart was
due this morning and when the train
jumbled into Carson depot a great and
eager crowd was there to greet him. An
-enterprising photographer had even taken
.ip a position on a wobbly awning oppo
site the station in order to get, a snap shot
at the central figure of America -.-sporting
world.
As the passengers filed out of the I
coaches one by one, and the face and
figure that has been studied from news
paper cuts diligently since the passage of
the prize-fight bill did not appear, there
was a chorus of expressions carrying with j
-them more than ordinary disappointment. i
There was to be another train ere the j
sun set, and Stuart still had a chance to |
get in on time and assure tbe anxious ones ;
â¢that the great fight was really to re pulled j
oft in Nevada. This train, which tur- !
bles in on the afternoon schedule at 3:30 \
o'clock, found waiting fcr it even a greater !
throng than that which comprised the
morning watch. But there was no Stuart.
. This suspense is a veritable itch to the
good people of Carson. They are begin
ning to imagine that all sorts of obstacles
are arising which might prevent the
world's championship battle. Although
it. seems to be generally understood that
the contest will take place in Carson, still
there is no element of certainty about it,
and that is why Car_oni.es are given to
worrying tome what; that is why they
: want to see Stuart on the ground. They
know he will have to decide quickly, as
there is not much time to lose, particu
larly in view of Stuart's announcement
.that he intends to erect a mammoth pa
vilion for tho affair.
â¢ A story was circulated to-day that for a
time had anything but a tendency to ease
the* minds of the anxious ones in Carson.
It was to the effect that Stuart had ar
rived in Reno and that before he could
board a train forCarsbn he was captured by
A committee of Reno's citizens, which
spirited him away and was engaged in an
effort to persude him to bring off the
fight in that town in preference to the
capital of the Sagebrush State. This story
proved to be a false alarm. It was traced
to a wag who works at the depot, and now
that wag Ib judiciously keeping himself
. in seclusion.
' It was learned here to-night that Stuart
is coming this way over the southern
route instead of the Central Pacific He
"was in Yuma this afternoon, and cannot
arrive here now until Thursday.
Harry Corbett, brother of the ponipa
doured lad who lowered the colors "of the
great John L., arrived this morning, and
that had a tendency to appease the multi
tude in its disappointment over Stuart's
failure to appear. Harry came direct
from San Francisco, and made no denial
that his chief object was to have a con
sultation with Mr. Cooke, the handsome
- young theatrical agent, who came several
days ago to select training quarters for
Corbett. If,
While Harry said he had no thought of
' attempting to relieve Cooke of his task,
. still he considered himself interested in
so important a matter as choosing train
ing-grounds, and on approaching Cooke
.he headed off a possible clash by ad
' van'cing the old "Two heads are better
than one" theory. They got along
nicely.
Cooke has visited every suitable site
'.-hereabouts, and has a book full of figures
about altitudes and thermoraetrical idio
syncrasies which he intends to submit to
James J. to-morrow. Cooke at first fa
. vored Steamboat Springs, but he was
afraid the hot baths there would have a
weakening effect, and also that the slight
taint of mercury in the water might be in
jurious.
.Besides this, the accommodations were
scarcely what he fancied the man who
wants Fitz's scalp might desire. So he
turned to Shaws Springs, located but a
mile from Carson. The proprietor practi
cally promised to bujld a handball court
and such other paraphernalia as Corbett
might Tiffd, but it is still no certainty
that Cooke or Corbett can get this location.
y This is the place that was chosen by
. Fitzsimmons for his preparatory work,
It is true that Bob only wired for terms
for himself and party and has not since
sent .word that he would accept, but
nevertheless the proprietor of the springs
seems to believe that he is in duty bound
to at least give Fitzsimmons a little time.
"If be does not hear from the Australian
soon he will surrender the place to the
' Corbett party.
A rather improbable story bounded over
this way from Truckee to-day, and inter
ested Sheriff William Kinney of Carson.
It was to the effect that 100 or more lum
ber-workers of that place were organizing
-secretly for the purposo of coming to Car
son on the 17th of March, and with their
superior numb.r brush doorkeepers and
peace officers aside and see the fight for
nothing.
Now, be it known that Kinney is not
only the County Sheriff here, but is a
veritable Pooh-Bah in the police line. In
addition to the shrievalty he holds the
' tlioes of Chief of Police, City Marshal,
Constable and Chief of the Fire Depart
ment. .â¢.-.'..
la at least four of these capacities he
â will find himself responsible for the peace
and dignity of the occasion when "Jim"
and "F.tz" meet with their mittens on,
and be may even have to press into service
(the fifth, should the affair become too
'wry. Mr. Kinney says he bas authority
ro appoint, in the first place, deputy
sheriffs, i policemen, deputy constables,
deputy marshals and finally to establish
a reserve force of firemen, all of whom
will attend tbo fight clothed with author
ity as peace officers. It is needless to say
tbat applications for these responsible po
sitions are pouring in upon him .from all
sides, and, what may be considered even
more remarkable, none of the volunteers*
seem to care whether or not they get any
pay for their services.
"No, I will not name my squad until
after I have had a talk with Stuart," said
Kinney to-day. "He may not deem a
heavy force necessary. I do not for my
part. I expect an immense but orderly
gntbering. All this talk about the lumber
men or miners invading the scene is
nonsense. We don't have those kind of
people in Nevada. If it were summer we
might look for a delegation of hoboes and
cheap gamblers, but at this time of the
year you know the walking is bad and
conducive of chilblains, and I do not
count upon entertaining many members
of the Industrial Army."
Mr. Cooke and Harry Corbett received
I telegraphic information to-night to the
effect that Jim Corbett would reach Reno
tomorrow evening and that he desired to
meet them there for a brief chat. He will
net visit Carson on this trip. He is ac
companied by his wife and is anxious loses
her safely in San Francisco before going
into training, and to visit his parents as
well. Mrs. Corbett will remain in San
Francisco during her.husband's training
and until after the ficht. Apartments
have been engaged for her at the St. Nich
olas Hotel.
Nothing definite has been heard at all
during tho past three days regarding Fitz
simmons or as to the time toexpect his ar
rival. Neither is there any one represent
ing him or his interests..
CORBETT AT SALT LAKE.
Complexion ofthe Champion Still lias a '
brillotc Tinge.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 9.â Champion
J. J. Corbett, accompanied by h.s wife,
his trainer, John McVey, Billy Woods and
Joe Egan, arrived in the city to-day. Cor
bett gave a sparring exhibition with Mc-
Vey at the theater t<->-ni__ht. The house
was crowded and the champion was en
thusiastically received.
Corbett is looking well, but a little sal
low of complexion. This is due, he says,
to training down. He now weighs iso
pounds, the weight at which he is to meet
Fuzsimmonat
He bad little to say about the coming
fight except that Fitzs,iramons and his
friends would receive a rude awakening.
They considered Fi'.zsimmons his supe
rior, but the champion is confident that
he will demonstrate otherwise in a very
few rounds when they g6t into the ring.
Until then he is not inclined to do much
talking.
The party left for San Francisco to
night, where Corbett will remain for a few
days, leaving for Nevada on Sunday
night. He will give sparring exhibitions
in Virginia City, Reno and Carson on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights
of next week and then go into regular
training for the fight.
XITZSIBMOXS' COXDITIOX.
Could Enter the Prise-Ring With Ten
Days' Preparation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 9.â While Cor
bett is slowiy making bis way toward
Nevada, Fitzsimmons has as yet made no
definite plans for beginning his long jour
ney west. He may start to-morrow and
again he may not leave this city until the
latter part of the week. Fitzsimmons,
like Corbett, will try to make a few
shekels on the way.
Martin Julian will arrange for the
auburn-haired boxer to stop at several of
the large cities to give exhibitions. Julian ,
will then leave for Carson City to engage \
training quarters. Three towns have of- j
fered good inducements.
While Fitzsimmons Is taking exercise
every day he has done no real training as
yet. He claims ten days will be all that
is necessary to put him into good shape.
He seems nearly fit to enter a ring now.
He intended to do heavy worK yesterday
but Earnest Roeber, with whom the New
Zealander wrestles, did not show up and
so Fitzsimmons had to content himself
with his usual ten-mile run, a rub down
and a bout with his pet dog. Just what
Fitzsimmons weighs he and his trainers
alone know. They are very careful not to
make it public nor to discuss the subject.
He doubtless is heavier than usual.
Fitzsimmons is hot upon the trail of
"Billy" Brady. He says the latter is sim
ply bluffing when he offers to bet $1000
that Fitzsimmons will never get into the
ring with Corbett.
"I'll cover his $1000 whenever he wants
to put it up," said the Australian. "Brady
need not think he will have to pay ms to
get into the rin_ with Corbett, like he did
Mitchell. Corbett's fight with Mitchell
was a fake pure and simple. The latter
said he would not fight Corbett unless he
was paid, so Brady put up the thousand.
I'm willing to go on record as saying
that."
A TUG-OF-WAR SCHEME.
How Some of the Sailor T.ads Wer..
Trapped by Trained Athletes
on the Water Front.
An exciting affair occurred at the new
ferry building yesterday morning. A
number of brawny longshoremen and
sailors were discussing tho tug-of-war
tournament in which several of their
number are to participate, at the corner
of Market and East streets. As the dis
cussion became quite heated regarding
the muscular merits of each team a by
stander, who had not entered the discus
sion, said he could produce four men
within half an hour who could "outpuli
anything on the water front."
At first he was thought to be some
meddlesome idler parading a large-sized
bluff, but when he offered a couple of
shining twenties to back his assertion the
crowd was convinced of his sincerity and
immediately commenced canvassing for
"men and money" to captnie the alleged
good thin p. After nearly an hour's dili
gent search a quartet of hercuiean can
didates for muscular honors were re
cruited, and the requisite $40 being posted
the unknown plunger covered it and
hastened away to rally his contingent of
rope-pullers.
He returned punctually at the hour
agreed for (11 ___ m.) and it was hastily de
cided that the contestants try conclusions
o.i the steel cubic used on one of the der
ricks to hoist material at the new ferry
depot. Permission being granted, the
men took up about 100 feet of the slack
cable to the third floor, and bavins impro
vised cleats on some wide two-inch planks
they grasped their respective ends. The
tug was even for about two and a half
minutes, then the rope began io travel
toward the unknowns' side slowly and
with aggravating precision till with one
mighty effort the opposing team was
pulled over the. cleats like bowlders de
scending a mountain side..
The referee handed the winners their
money and it was then for the first time
learned that they had gone np against four
of the best men of the Irish team under
Captain James Hardned, who are en
tered for the big tug-of-war tournament
nt the Mechanics' .Pavilion.
Exposition Funds Not Certain.
Tho appropriations for the Guatemala and
Hamburg expositions have not been audited
by Mr. Broderick and they may not be ap
proved. The principal trouble is that they
are made payable upon the urgent necessity
fund, which was not created for such pur
poses.
Every Atlantic trip of the larger of
the ocean liners costs from $15,000 to
$20,000. '^':^ ;:, :-';^v*^:
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1897.
MLLE. TREBELLI
MAKES A HIT
A Little- Known Singer
Takes Her Audience
by Storm.
She Is a Coloratura Vocalist
Who Shines in Many Styles
of Song.
Gustav Hinrichs' Orchestra Enhances
the Concertâ Beel's Farewell
Appearance.
Antoinette Trebelli came and sang and.
conquered at the California Theater last
night.
Probably not over one person in a hun
dred among the audience had ever heard
the young woman, before. Most music
lovers knew her name, of course; every
one who takes an interest in tbe history
of opera has heard of Zelie Trebelli, tb*
great contralto. But Antoinette â who was
she? Before she arrived in this City on
her tour around the world, few people
were aware tbat Trebelli had left a
daughter to continue the family reputation
for vocal art. Judging from last night's
enthusiasm, however, Antoinette Trebelli
has already found a number of warm ad
mirers in San Francisco.
Mile. Trebelli has always used to sine
In opera, which accounts for her not being
so widely known as many other lyric
artists of less ability. It also accounts for
the fact that her voice in its maturity is
as fresh and unworn as that of a young
girl just making her debut.
Treoelli showed her versatility last
night by singing a variety of different
styles of music, from a florid "bravura"
work to a little simple "lied."
It is bard to find anything but lavish
praise for every note she sang. She is a
soprano with a rich, full, even voice, but
possessing the coloratura, the ease and
agility of the most apile soprano leggero.
In short, Trebelli is an exponent of that
rapidly disappearing art, bei canto, and
her tri. roulades and runs ere things of
"â¢beauty.
The concert opened with the prelude to
"Hansel and Gretel." which was excel
lently piay d by Gustav Hinrichs' Sym
phony Orchestra.
Trebelli, a buxom young woman in a
green and .ink Dresden silk gown, with
a corsage gleaming with diamonds, was
given a very kindly reception, which
changed to enthusiasm after she had sung
"Bel Raggio," from "Semirainide." The
vocal embroideries of this old show aria
were tossed off as easily by the singer as
. quaffing a glass of wine. Of course an
encore was demanded, and Mie. Trebelli
gave Taubert's "In a Distant Land" with
charming expression.
It is always considered either a sign of
finished bei canto, or of utter rashness
when a soprano challenges comparison
with a flute obligato. In Bishop's "Lo,
I hear the gentle lark," Trebelii's execution
| was as easy and smooth as that of the
i flute which played the obligato, and so
much applause was given her exquisite
display of vocal fireworks that she oblig
ingly repeated the song.
A very different style of music was the
grand aria from Massenet's "Heriodade,"
"II est doux, il est bon," but this more
modern and dramatic work seemed to
display the singer's rich, fall notes and
her good cantabile style. As an encore
Miss Trebelli sang a vocal setting of a
Chopin mazurka.
The plaintive, beautiful music of
' _.olvej_.'a Song," from Grieg's incidental
j music to Ibsen's "Peer Gym," was the
Jast vocal number on the programme.
Trebelli sang it with a simple charm which
I again showed her versatility.
When the audience insisted on hearing
| her again she completed the subjugation
| of her hearers with the "Langhine Song"
I from Auber's "Manon Leseaud," which
! she gave with a spontaneous mirth which
I arousod responsive echoes of laughter
j from many parts of the house.
An especial interest attached to the
work of the Hinrichs Symphony Orches
j tra, as la*t night was announced as the
j final appearance of Sigmund Seel as con
! cert master, prior to his departure for
Europe.
Bizet's "Suite Arlesienne" and the
well-known entr'acte from Schubert's
\ "Rosamunde" were played with expres
sion and . finish by the orchestra, and
Saint-Saens' "Danse Macabre" was given
a thoroughly realistic rendering.
The concert would have been more en
joyable had the utmost, ere of the theater
teen less glacial. The California has
been closed for some weeks, and during
the first part of the evening ti.e fact was
uncomfortably evident in the chilly air.
It is announced thut in consequence of
last night's success Trebelli concerts will
be given Saturday afternoon and Sunday
and Tuesday evenings.
THE FLAGLESS NICARAGUA
Her Commission and License
Revoked by a Central Amer
ican Government
The Merging of Nicaragua Into the
. Greater R public Causes A'l
tin Trouble.
Captain Mclntyre, the genial captain of
the big steam collier Costa Rica, is in the
peculiar position of a shipmaster without
a flaz to fly at his masthead almost "a
man without a countiy."
For a long time past the Costa Rica has
plied between this port and Nanaimo,
bringing in her heavy burdens of coal
and riving the flag of Nicaragua, the little
Central American public, principally
noted for revolutions and an extremely
torrid climate.
' Why tie steamer should carry the name
of one revolutionary State and tbe flag of
another, nas n^ver been explained satis
factorily, but the vessel prospered never
theless. .;..â ;â¢' ..;
Some time ago the beads of three of the
little Central American. States Honduras,
Salvador and Nicaragua â joined issues lor
mutual advancement and prosperity, and
the Greater Republic of Central America
was the result.
One of the first acts of the new Govern
ment was to revoke all of the commissions
tbat had existed under tbe regimes of the
minor republics.
Consul Captain William L. Merry of
Nicaragua lost bis position, as did Consul
John T. Wright of Honduras and Consul
Dr. Eustorgio Caldcron of Salvador. Then
the latter was appointed Consul for the
Greater Republic, with full power to look
after its interests in this City.
In addition to deposing the Consuls the
new Government revok d the licenses and
commissions of all vessels sailing under
the separate flags of the three States, and
moreover decided that for the present at
least tbe flag of the new Government
should fly over no ships except the war
vessels/ belonging to the allied Govern
ments.
Thus it was that Captain Mclntyre
found himself without a flag, and is even
now looking for one under which he can
sail bis ship. â¢
He has good reasons, he says, for not
adopting the American flag, and intends
to take bis time before he selects one that
shall replace the emblem of the republic
that is no more.
PIKES AND FALSE ALARMS.
They Kept the Department Busy for
Several Hours.
Four false alarms and two small fires
kept the department busy for a few hours
last evening. The first alarm was from
box 147 at 7:25 o'clock, and an investiga
tion proved it to be false. The secoud,
from box 79, at 8:05 o'clock, was also a
bogus alarm. Box 62, nt 9 o'clock, and
box 63, at 9:06 o'clock, also proved to be
false alarms.
After Chief Sullivan had raced to the
four boxes, he placed two men in biding
in the vicinity of each of the boxes south
of Market street in the hope of delecting
those who were causing the department
so much trouble. The attempt, however,
proved unsuccessful.
An alarm was sounded from box 78 at
9:10 o'clock for a fire in the rear of a
dwelling occupied by Dr. T. Leonard,
1310 Howard sireet. The cause of the fire,
which damaged the building to the ex
tent of $100, was unknown.
The alarm from 53 at 11:05 was a small
hay fire on wharf X at the foot of Third
street. The damage was slight.

along the center of the street and a gor

that it would cause a revival of business.
The merchants still complain, however,
and say that business has decreased
almost 50 per cent during the past yeai.
A meeting of the Sixth-street Improve
ment Club was called lastevenine and the
situation was discussed at. length. Mr.
Dohrmann, president or the Merchants'
Association, suggested that if good streets
and better car service were desired, all
members of the club should keep the

Iff. Israel then moved that a committee
of five be appointed to affiliate with a like

regard was fatten.

VALET CLARK
UNDER FIRE
His Memory Very Poor
About Senator Fair's
Movements.
Attorney Hosmer Objrcts to Mr.
Reddy's Examination of His
Chief Witness.
Evidence That Senator Fair Was at
a Back Meeting on a Day
in Question.
The evidence for the prosecution was
concluded in the preliminary examination
of Notary J. J. Cooney for perjury before
Judge Cook yesterday. It was announced
that the defense would go on to-day, be
ginning this morning.
George J. Storey, cashier and secretary
of the National Savings Bank, was the
first witness called. He was put on partly
to corroborate the evidence of Herbert
, Clark, valet, as to the movements of the
Senator on September 27, 1894, the day
when he is alleged to have been in Notary
Cooney's office.
The witness said that on September 27.
1594, Senator Fair attended a meeting ot
the board of directors of the bank, this
being in the afternoon. The witness bad
his minute-book with him, and from this
he read that the following were present at
the meeting:
James D. Phelan, first vice-president, in
the chair; James G. Fair, S. G. Murphy,
John A. Hooper, C. G. Hooper, Frank J.
Sullivan, James Moffitt. The meeting
was called for 3 p. m. and occupied about
an hour.
"Was there any exit from the rear of
the directors' room?" asked Mr. Barnes.
"None whatever."
"So no person attendiug that meeting
could possibly have left by another way
than by the front door?"
"No."
"How long were you acquainted with
Senator Fair?"
"Ever since I was employed by the
bank. About four years."
"Do you of your own memory and
knowledge recall Senator Fair's physical
condition on that day?"
"1 remember that for some time pre
vious to that meeting Senator Fair was a
sick man. He was very weak and irrita
ble, and at times almost palsied. It was
his custom to preside at directors' meet
ings, but some time before he died be was
obliged to call upon Mr. Phelan to pre
side."
- Mayor Phelan was tbe next witness. He
corroborated what Cashier Storey said
concerning the meeting of September 27,
1891, and there was no cross-examination. ,
Herbert , Clark was recalled by Attor-
I ney Reddy and be reasserted that be ac

membered the bank meeting on Septem
ber 27.
When court was reconvened at 2 p. m.
Valet Clark was called to the stand, but
his testimony was unimportant.
Edward Mai ley of the contracting firm
of Warren & â¢ Mailey, succeeded Clark
upon the stand. Mr. Malley, whose face
was wreathed with smiles, testified that
on September 27, 1894. be was acquainted
with Senator Fair and Valet Clark. On
the afternoon of that day be saw the two
men on Post street.
Mr. Fair entered the Mutual Savings
Bank, which confronts Post street, and
the tractile Clark waited on the sidewalk
for his master.
At the conclusion of an hour's weary
vigil Clark was still in evidence, and, so
the witness presumed, Senator Fair was
still inside.
When cross-examined by Mr. Reddy, of
cunt-el for the defense, Mr. Malley, who
till retained bis placating smile, admitted
hat he was not positive as to the date he
had seen Senator Fair and Clark on Post
street. I -"- â Â'â ' '?'\T-si:2'J<.
Continuing, Mr. Malley testified that
during September, 1894, he was "after
, Fair on every occasion" in the hope of
securing a desirable contract.
When asktd by Mr. Keddy why he had
not gone into the Mutual Savings Bank to
speatc to Senator Fair the witness stated
that the Senator had for some time
studiously avoided him and that he
wished to take him unawares. For the
same potential reason he had refrained
from approaching Clark.
The witness admitted that he bad not
until last Saturday informed any one as
to bis possession of information regarding
the visit of Senator Fair in September,
1594, to the Mutual Savings Bank. On
the day in question he had gratuitously
volunteered the, information to Charley
air.
When Mr. Malley had been excused
Valet Clark was recalled. With a studied
air of ennui the retainer of the dead Sen
ator took the chair, and in response to
questions admitted that he had within a
few days conferred with Charles Fair's
attorneys regarding the cause at issue,
and that be had with the same persons
discussed the matter of Senator Fair's
movements on September 27. 1894.
To a Jong series of questions propounded
by Mr. Reddy Valet ClarK almost invari
aby responded that be did not remember.
Finally Assistant District Attorney
Hoamer came to Clark's rescue by inter
posing an objection to the line of ques
tioning pursued by the defense.
Springing to bis feet Mr. Reddy de
clared tbat when he encountered a wit
ness whose memory was "like an old
shoe, calculated to fit only desired points
and angles," be felt he was justified in
being extreme in cross-examination.
Judge.Cook assumed the role of "great
pacificator," and then the inquisition pro
ceeded. ; >\, >.
In reply to queries propounded by Mr.
Reddy, the body servant of the deceased
millionaire testified that for eleven years
antecedent to the day of his demise Sena
tor Fair had been afflicted with diabetes
and Brighl's disease of the kidneys. Dur
ing the time specified the witness had con
stantly attended bis patron.
By a series of ingenious interrogatories
Attorney Reddy sought to demonstrate
that owing to physical disability Senator
Fair could not have remained in the
Mutual Savings Bank for so long a period
as that alleged (by implication at least) by
Mr. Malley. But Clark's plea of ataxic
memory continued in force.
Tbe case goes on to-day, commencing at
10 A. m. -'-:.-: ';
SOUTH OP THE PAEK.
Sunset Improvement Club Opposed to
the Carfare deduction.
Several subjects of local importance
were discussed at last night's meeting of
the Sunset Improvement Club and resolu
tions bearing upon the same adopted.
The bill now before the Legislature ,
providing a 2J^-cent car rata was opposed
by the meeting on motion of Frank Conk
lin, the financial secretary, for the reason
that such a measure would prove detri
mental to all outside sections of the City.
James Cavanagh. chairman of the elec

A communication was received from ex-

Daniel Foley reported that it was the In
i tention or the Supervisors to stop all street
' improvements on the south side of the

could be installed.
The question of having electric lights
I placed in Golden Gate Park was discussed
lat length, but no definite action was

I sidering a scheme for supplying a plant
i for that- purpose.
Acommi tee consisting of J. J. Walsh
Sr., James Cavanagh and Frank Conkliu
was appointed to look after the illumina
tion of tbe district and the park. â¢ ,
Julius Franklin stated that steps would
j be taken to place a fire engine and hose
cart on the lot on Tenth avenue, between
I and J streets, as the necessity for a coxa*

East Portland, Or., boasts of one of tha
prettiest Margarettes in the land. This
sweet little girl is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. H. Schnider of 282 Crosby street. East
Portland. Or. As you see her in this pic-
ture you see her in the flesh. Her cheeks
are plump, her eyes bright, and there is
color in her cheeks. There is not a mark,
a blot or blemish to spoil the beautiful
contour of the lace. The reason is given j
that she has been using Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. Margarette sends her love
to California, and tells of her delight with
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Margarette is winsome, bright, and is
easily the prettiest Margarette in the coun-
try. I spoke to her father. His place of
business is at 33 Fourth street, Portland.
He came out of his office especially to tell
me of the great good Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla had done for ibefamily. "It is,"
said he, "the family medicine now, and
we propose always to keep this remedy in
the house." He advised me to visit many â¢
other houses in Portland and I would
learn of wonderful things that- had been
done by Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. He
said he knew of a case of scrofula that was
completely cured by this great blood med-
icine. â._.:
By the way, a remarkable thing in Port- â¢
land is tbat there are no substitutes here.
People are not putting up something '-just
as cood." and of course when you ask for
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla you get it
without a murmur. The truth is they are
not cutting the price, and druggists make
a rational profit, therefore do not feel in-
clined to cheat people. It is a good idea '
to publish this letter as written.

The Examiner published for several days at the
top of its title page th- following fate:
THE EXAMINER PUELISHED
249,757 Inches

5964 More

In the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount in inches of its
advertising and that in consequence it could be
confronted with the following fact.
TELE FACT
THE EXAMINER FUELISHED
236,528 Inches

That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches

THE CALL than in the
Examiner during J 896.
It Is ;o be remembered that during 1895 the I
Examinrr published apiroximare'y 800 inches of i
illegal lottery advertisements, of w.iich The Call j
did not and would not pubitsi one.

In describing the work of getting up its
fake petition the Examiner said yesterday,
"more are signing by the hundreds." Are
we to understand then that many people
ere induced to sign a hundred signatures
at a time?
. The Board of Supervisors will meet this morning as a committee of the whole to
consider the problem of fixing water rases for the fiscal year. The president and
secretary of the Spring Valley "Water Company have been invited to be present to
furnish the Supervisors with information they may need in order to enable them
more accurately to perform the duty required of them. The meeting will be one of
more than ordinary interest as well as importance, and it is to be reasonably expected
that the proceedings will lay a foundation for the establishment of a fair rate which
| will be just both to the company and to the people.
A report of the Water Committee submitted to the Board of Supervisors on Mon
j day gives promise that the popular expectation of having water rates fixed fairly and
j justly will not be disappointed. In the course of its report the committee said:
The City and County is called upon to allow fair and reasonable water rates to be paid by
the City and County and Its inhabitants, and certainly it should be informed, clearly and
convincingly, of the details of the expenditures of the company in order to act as fair
and just arbitrators between the company and its customers. The company owes it to itself
and to its customers to make such a statement in detail of all its operations, and especially of
lis expenditures, in order to demonstrate its business-policy and justify the board in the
establishment of water rates as the board may deem just, that are warranted by the condi
tions and requirements of their water supply. Your committee feel that unjust criticism of
the action of the board should be avoided. in the matter of fixing rates, as until informa
tion Is obtained more definite than presented nothing can be done to accomplish the ob
jects of the inquiry.
There can be no question as to the justice of the position taken by the water com
mittee in this statement. It is the duty of the water company to furnish the Super
visors with all the information necessary to enable the board to appraise the rates
justly, and if the company fails to do so the stockholders will have none but the
directors to blame if the Supervisors, being compelled to act in the dark, should give
the public the benefit of every doubt which may be raised by reason of any failure on
the part of the company to give the information which under the law they are
required to do. Â«
The-people will heartily approve that section of the report which declares "that
unjust criticism of the action of the board should be avoided in the matter of fixing
rates, as until information is obtained more definite than presented, nothing can be
done to accomplish the object of the inquiry." The great majority of the people of
San francisco are honest, and desire to see no injustice done either to the Supervisors
or to the water company. They desire only what is right and fair, and will uphold
both the company and the board against any attempt of blackmailers to extort sub
sidies by means of slander or any other methods known to that class of boodlers.
A ful.', fair, thorough, comprehensive investigation of the whole subject is the first
step to be taken. It is the duty of the Supervisors to demand explicit information
concerning the business of the water company, and it is the duty of the officers of
the company to give that information without evasion or concealment When the
facts of the business have been made known it will then be possible for the Supervis
ors to act with discernment in fixing the rat*s, and it will also be possible for the
people to judge accurately whether the rates so fixed are equitable or not.
The desire of the people of San Francisco to obtain cheaper water and gas than
j they have had in the past is both natural and praiseworthy. It is nothing more than
honest economy on the part of individuals and on the part of the municipality to
obtain the best and most abundant water supply possible for a given expenditure.
There is a w despread belief that the water supply of the City might be furnished
much more cheaply both to the City and to private parties, and there is a general
desire to obtain the cheaper rates if they can be given without any injustice being
done to those who have invested their capital and employed their energies in the
work of furnishing the City its water supply.
There is a suspicion that one of the reasons why the water company has
been unable to supply water more cheaply in the past is because 'it has paid out to
i dishonest men large subsidies extorted from it by a species of blackmail. If such
j subsidies have been paid they should be suppressed in the future. There is no reason
I why the water company should not take the people of San Francisco into its con
, fidence. If it exposes the boodlers who have been preying upon it as the Examiner
was exposed by the Southern Pacific Company, it will be safe from all attacKs by
i such blackmailers in the future, and will be able to save money for itself and for
the public. It is certainly time that the evil of extorting subsidies from rich corpora
tions was crushed out in San Francisco, and this is the best time to take resolute steps
in that direction.
WORDS OF CHEER.
The general review of business condi
tions given by President Watkins at the |
annual meeting of the Board of Trade on !
Monday is full of encouragement for those
who look forward to the coming of better
times be.'ore the present year closet. His
address confirms the general expectation
ot the public and is in hnrmony with
statements from men representing com
mercial bodies in other portions of the
country. It was, thereiore, an address of
good cheer which will have an influence
in bringing about the prosperity it pre- ',
diets.
President Watkins quoted with approval
the recent statement of Andrew Carnegie:
"Unless some surprise is sprung upon the ,
country nothing can hold it back from a j
period of genuine prosperity." Tnis state- :
ment expresses briefly the prevailing Benti- ,
ment in business and industrial circles. i
The sentiment moreover is well founded. ;
As President Watkins himself said: "Or
every band are evidences of improving j
times. The conditions are all favorable
for a prosperous year. There is no infla- j
tion in anything. Prices are all low and
business as a whoie is upon a sound foun
dation."
These words of encouragement must not '
be misunderstood,, nor their import exag
gerated. It is not expected by anybody
well versed in commerce or industry thai 1
we are to have a suaden revival of pros- j
perity blossoming throughout the country \
with the rapidity of the flowers of spring.
After the long depression through which 'â¢â 
we have gone it will require some time be- i
fore the confidence of investors and pur- j
chasers is restored and the stream of busi
ness flows again with its old-time freedom
and force. Moreover, we need a change
in the tariff of the country before our in
dustries will have the protection essential
to their welfare, and it is hardly safe to ex
pect any great improvement in industries
until alter the new tariff bill has been
enacted and protection is once more ac
corded to tbe industries and enterprises of
the people.
According to the latest reports from
Washington, men who are in a position tc
know assert that we shall probably have
protection by July 1. The Republican
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee are rapidly putting the finishing
touches on the new tariff bill, and will
have it ready to report as soon as an extra
session of Congress can be assembled. The
extra session will not be called for pur
poses of idle debate or the discussion of
theories, but for business. Ample time
will be given for legitimate consideration
of all the schedules of the new measure,
but nothing will be allowed to obstructive
tactics. Tnis being so, the measure will
speedily pass the House and be sent to
the Senate. That body, so long consid
ered doubtful, is now regarded as being
sure to give the bill a prompt passage.
The Senators have beard the voice of the
country demanding a restoration of busi
ness, and are at last willing to yield to it.
Senator Lodge gave a good reason for
insisting that consideration of the arbi
tration treaty should be held in secret
session when he said that if the debate
were public all the long-winded orators of
the Senate would make buncombe
speeches and it would be impossible to
reach a vote before tbe adjournment of
Congress. __________________

ton gave the seamen an opportunity to j

of danger, but their individual heroism,
and most nobly did they exhibit all the

heroes and defenders.

are supposed to have. â _

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1897.
WATER RATES.
EEEOIO SEAMEN.
The hurricane through which the j
squadron of Admiral Bunce had to fight
its way from below Hatteras to Charles
ton afforded a test of the sea-going worth
of our warship*, the skill of our naval
officers and the discipline of our seamen.
All of them bore the test well and tri
umphantly. Every ship in the squadron
reached Charleston in safety and so far
as they are concerned there will be no
longer any doubt in the public mind of
their ability to meet and overcome the
battle and tbe gale.
Great, however, as is the popular grati
fication in the proof thus given of the
strength and seaworthiness of our war
snips and the skill displayed by their
officers, it was not the shipbuilders n. r
the naval commanders who won the high
est honors in the contest with the siorm.
Those who distinguished themselves most
and highest were the brave seamen whose
heroic actions in attempting to rescue
tbeir comrades from the fury of winds
and waves attests once more that there is
no height of human couiago to which the
American sailor does not attain in the
hour of danger and trial.
Even in the bare record of the deeds
as told in the telegraphic dispatches of
yesterday there was enough to stir the
blood of landsmen. On board the Maine,
Prentice Kozel was struck by a terrible
wave and swept out to 8 a. As lie was be
ing carried away two of nis messmates,
John Brown and Alexander Nelson,
sprang forward to save him and they also
were caught in the rush of waters and
borne overboard. Then William J. Creel
man standing on the poop deck saw the
body of Kozel floating by and dived from
the stern to give him help.
In the meantime another man, Charles
Hassel], had been washed from the deck
by the sea and was struggling in the
waves. Life-buoys were thrown over and
Hassell got one of them. Being thus par
tially secure be at once set out to help
Creelman and succeeded in doing so. A
lileboat sent out under command of Naval
Cadet Walter R. Gherardi, son of Rear-
Admiral Gherardi, to pick up the strug
glers, was overturned and seven more of
the gallant crew were in the midst of the
black waters. By the use of life lines
these men were saved, as were Hassell
and Creelman, but the others were 10-t
by a death as heroic as any that man ever
died.
On board the other ships of the squad
ron dangers as great were faced and deeds
almost as heroic were performed. At
every moment on every ship the seamen
confronted the storm with a discipline
and a valor superior to its power and its
terrors. Not once during the whole long
conflict did these gallant bluejackets show
any of that spirit which makes man ap
pear as a pygmy in contest with over
powering elements. On the contrary they
asserted and demonstrated the superiority
of the human soul over all the forces of
wind and wave raging at their fiercest in
the darkness -of night, and once more
gave the Republic reason to be proud of
the men who wear her uniforms and de
fend her banner on the stormy seas.
HILL ON DEMOCRACY
In the February number of the Forum
there is a paper from David B. Hill called
"Tbe Future of the Democratic Organiza
tion," which would have been more ap-
propriately placed under the caption "The
Past of the Democratic Organization." It
deals throughout almost its entire length
with fatal mistakes of that party in the
last campaign, and there is a conspicuous
lack of any statement of a well-defined
policy for Democracy to fight for in the
future. \
Senator Hill's recapitulation of the
recent mad blunders of his party may be
paid to be a masterly statement of the
case, but tbat is an old story. The ques
tion now is what is Democracy going to
do, and to answer merely that past errors
are to be avoided is scarcely adequate. If
the party is to keep itself before the public
eye as a live thing some issues should te
made clear cut enough to challenge atten
tive study and justify the costly appeal to
the decision of the wisdom of the majority
of the Nation.
The intense conservatism of Hill's
article is somewhat as if a general were
planning a war in wh'ch he expected to
stay entirely within his fortress walls and
no field movements needed to be con
templated. This would be more reason
able if the Democrats were in power, but,
being out, an aggressive campaign in the
open field would seem a necessity, unless
they intend to be content to stay out.
The nearest thing to an energetic move
proposed by Hill is for "a more vigorous
advocacy of the growing issue of personal
liberty." This sounds well enough, but in
order to make it constitute an issue he
will have to show that the party in power
is opposed to any lecitimate amount of
personal liberty. He also says tho Demo
crats must strenuously oppose agrarian
ism and other forms of socialism, but
here again he raises no clear-cut issue
with the Republican hosts, with whom
his main contention must be.
On financial matters he is practically at
one with the Republicans- He suggests a
revival of the perennial dispute over the
tariff, but he admits that the country was
dissatisfied with the Wilson tariff because
it did not yield adequate revenue, and
therefore as the Republican leaders have
not proposed protection beyond the point
necessary to American industry and Na
tional revenue Hill may be said to base
his proposed issue upon the improbable
'supposition that the American people
will be again willing to trust tariff legis
lation to the party of debt and deficit.
Taken altogether the Senator has made
but a weak and futile plea for his party
or his leadership. If this paper is the
best that conservative Democracy can do
Bryan need have no fear of any rival to
contest his supremacy.

A CONGSESSMANS BIG WORD.
Washington Tost.
Mr. De Armond's recent speech in the House
of Representatives, in which he paid his re
spects to Secretary Morton, was a remarkable
effort in many ways. One of these exhibited
the author in his capacity as word builder,
with the result thut he has added to our vocab
ulary a word longer than any other which
meets common acceptance. The longest words
to be found in Worcester, Webster, or the
Century dictionaries are believed to be
"palatopharlngeolaryngeal" and "trans
subs tantiatlonalists," mere fragments of
twenty-four and twenty-five letters. Mr. De
Armond's fancy and constructive ability were
satisfied, however, with nothing less than
"trlangularificationableness," , a veritable
Titan of words comprising twenty-seVen let
ters, and complete in every regard. Of course,
there are to be found purely technical terms
such as "methylbenzometboxyethyltetraly
dropyridlnecarboxylate," but they don't count
in a purely literary contest.

BIERCE TO HUNTINGTON.
The Writer Offers to Retire and Take the Hand of the
Magnate if He Tells the Truth.
Washington, March 20.
The Washington Star to-night printed the following statement:
AMBROSE BIERCE TO C. P. HUNTINGTON.
To the Editor of the Evening Star: On Friday of last week immediately after the
House Committee on Pacific Railroads had concluded its session C.P.Huntington
was asked by Representative Johnson of California to confirm the statement made to
him (Mr. Johnson) viz. ; tbat on becoming president of tbo Southern Pacific Company
he had cut off the company's annual payment of $12,000 to the Examiner. In the pres
ence and hearing of three members of the committee Huntington said that it was true.
The statement appears to have teen made in explanation of the Examiner's hostility to
him and his scheme for funding the debts of tue Pacific railroads.
I have reason to think that Huntington will be given an opportunity to prove in
court his accusation that the Examiner was once on the payroll of his company. In
the meantime if he wiil prove it to the satisfaction of three gentlemen, one to be
named by him. one by me and one by the two others, I hereby pledge myself to retire
permanently from the service of the Examiner. As he has frequently si nified his
earnest disapproval of my work on that paper he should think my retirement desir
able and advantageous. \" V
I promise, moreover, that if he makes his accusation good I will take him by the
hand, which recently I have twice refused when he offered it, once in the presence of
three members of the press in the corridor of the Capitol, and again in the room of
the Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads in the presence of the committee and
many gentlemen attending one of its meetings. As to this latter promise I exact but
one condition. Mr. Huntington is not to object to my gloves. I am, Mr. Editor, very
respectfully yours, Ambrose Bierce.

"OUR STATE MUST
BE VINDICATED"
Victoria's Message Pains
the State Board of
Trade.
The Legislature to Ec Asked to
Puncture \ Colonization
Schemes.
Committee Appointed to Wait on the
Governorâ Filcher
Indignant.
The California State Board of Trade is
on its mettle, and Queen Victoria of the
British Isles is the disturbing factor that
entered into its deliberations and caused
the whole trouble.
Not that the Queen was regarded in an
unworthy light, but some of her words
put the great Golden State in an unenvi
able position and strictly on the defen
sive. Gentlemen with colonizing schemes
to fleece tho unwary aro the direct causes
of the whole affair.
The board met in regular session yester
day afternoon. President J. A. Filcher
was there with a mind sadly troubled.
The words of England's potentate bore
heavily on him, and he intended to relieve
the mental tension before tbat meeting
adjourned.
The first question of importance to come
up was the consideration of a California
exhibit at the Hamburg Exposition. It
was decided that the board do all in its
power to secure for this State a creditable
exhibit.
Then President Filcher rose to the occa
sion and made a speech. He was indig
nant and his words showed it.
"Gentlemen," he said, "you will re
member that some time ago an English
writer wrote a letter home warning" bis
countrymen against the wildcat land
grabbing and colonization schemes by
which so many foreigners were duped in
this State.
"Well, the matter was regarded so seri
ously in England that the Queen took it
up and referred to it in her last message
to Parliament. This is something unpre
cedented in International affairs. It can
not fail to injure the reputation of our
State and prevent the investment of capi
tal with us. -.â¢;*:
"We might as well handle the thing
without gloves. It is a burning disgrace
that such a condition of affairs exists.
"Take the Holland colonization scheme
near Merced for example. After those
men came here they had to blast the
ground in order to plant anything.
"The colonists were ruined. Their capi
tal went for naught, while twenty miles
from them was the fairest agricultural
country on earth.
"Some even committed suicide In their
despair, and on that patch of desolate ter
ritory stand beautiful houses going to
rack and ruin which will be sold for kind
ling woodâ melancholy monuments to the
perfidy of the unworthy schemers who
sold alkali land to a class of desirable
immigrants at high rate?.
"We must do something to clear the
Stale of the taint attached to her garments.
Millions of dollars in advertising would
not induce anymore Hollanders to come
here and invest their capital. If things
are permitted lo run on none but the less
desirable class of immigrants will come
here at all."
The matter was discussed with spirit by
all the directors and ended in a committee
of five being appointed to wait upon the
Governor. The committee is compose;! of
W. H. Mills, J. S. Emery, J. A. Icher,
Colonel Craigie Sharpe and Mrs. E.
Shields. The committee will endeavor to
persuade the Governor to make the matter
the subject of a special message to the
Legislature, to lead to the appointment of
an inspector to pass on ail colonizing
schemes in California before any capital
can be invested.

to see the fishing fleet in the bay, but
they are not in love with a band of gypsies
that descended upon the town from Mill
Valley a few days ago. They were or
dered across the bay. but Sergeant "Tom"
Mahoney of the harbor police promptly
ordered them back again. He told them
in plain language that San Francisco had
no place in which they could pitch their
tents and told them they had better go
back whence they came. The little
company went back to Sausalito and
finally obtained permission to camp on
the beach until such time as the next
steamer should sail for Honolulu. Ser
geant Mahoney has a very opinion
of the gang and says they shall not land
in San Francisco except to ship for Hono
lulu if he can help it.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday. Mr. Cole, who was for
several days at the point of death, is now
recovering, and his son says that ne will
probably be out again in a few days and
ahle to attend the next meeting of the
board. The San Francisco Tim Pre
serving Company asked for the use of a
small strip of land on section B of the
seawall. The manager of the company
pointed out that it was a new industry
aud the State should foster it. A fair ren
tal was offered, but the Commissioners
decided to take the matter under advise
ment
The Southern Pacific Company wrote
asking that cleats be nailed on the upper
gangway of tho broad-gauge depot. Com
missioner Chadbourne pointed out that it
had taken the railway people a year and a
half to find out that cleats were necessary,
and said that all that was required was a
few extra lamps. "Let the company light
tne gangway," said he, "and then . there
will be no necessity lor cleats on the gang
way." Tbe matter was referred to Com
missioner Chadbourue, and he will write
the board's answer to the Southern Pacific's
communication.
The bark Wiina ana ship Oriental are
to be matched for a round trip to
Nanaimo, B. C, from San Francisco. The
Oriental made the run un in four days and
twelve hours, and the Wiina reached Flat
tery in four days, but owing to a heavy
storm was a day in getting up the sound
to her destination. Sne left here Decem
ber 31 and was loaded yesterday, so should
she make as quick a run back as she made
going up a new record will be established.
The Oriental has no chance of beating tbe
Wilna's time, as she was delayed nine
days at the mines. Just the same, her
captain expects to beat tbe Wilna's actual
sailing time, and then the two vessels will
have it out on the next voyage.
The troubles of the ship Sea King,
which had to put into Auckland, N. Z-,
in distress while on her way here from
Newcastle, N. S. W., have only ju*t
begun. An understanding between the
insurance agents and the owners cannot
be reached and until something has been
done the vessel will remain in New Zea
land. The chances are that her cargo will
be sold and the vessel docked for repairs.
After that she will go back to Australia
and make another attempt at bringing a
cargo of black diamonds to San Fran
cis' o.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company

time interval between steamers will be in
force and everything will jog along as

REVIVALS FOR CHINESE.
The Mongolian Quarter Is En
joying a Religious Fes
tival.
Ten Heathens Were Converted in
Methodist Mission Chapel Monday
Evening.
Chinatown is at present enjoying its
own season of religious revival. Monday
evening Rev. F.J. Masters and Rev. Chan
Hon Fan, followed by a number of Chinese
converts, marched to the corner of Wash
ington street and Waverly place and
preached the Gospel to the passing pagans.
Rev. Mr. Masters, who for ten years was a
missionary in China, and who speaks the
Chinese language fluently, first addressed
the Mongolians. He explained to them
the religion of Christ, and endeavored to
show them the fallacy of the doctrines
they considered true and sacred.
The minister's remarks were not with
out effect. He had always believed the
Chinese to be a stolid phlegmatic race, but
when the revivalists returned to the Meth
odist mission a goodly number of the
queued listtners followed and entered the
chapel.
Rev. Chan Hon Fan addressed -the con
gregation Inside tbe chapel, concluding
his sermon by asking all those who
wished to accept the religion of Christ to
.step forward. Without hesitation eight
young Chinamen and two Chinese girls
arose from their seats and went to the
front. Here a prayer was offered and
then bits of paper, on wnicb were priuted
a number of Chinese characters, were
banded the converts lor their signatures.
Translated the paper reads:
I desire to flee from the wrath to come. I de
sire also to give up my evil life and obtain
salvation through Jesus . the Christ, and I vol
untarily set my name to this paper to indicate
my firm determination to turn from sin to
righteousness and to study diligently the true
doctrine and to accept Jesus Christ as my
Savior.
The converts read the papers, hurriedly
signed them and then knelt in prayer.
It took courage on their part to do it.
This the ministers knew and so they en
couraged tbem as best they could.
The revival will continue during the
week and undoubtedly many heathens
will accept the true doctrine before it is
over. lilili IlitfliiWl i M fflÃl!?fffT M!jlwA jt{
Justices Would Name Their Clerks.
The bill for clerks for the Justices' court
means that the Justices want to name their
own clerk.'. This would take so much
patronage from the Board of Supervisors, but
it is urged that the plan would enable the
Justices to have : their respective dockets
made up regularly; also that the clerk* would
be absent from the main office only while the
Justices were â¢ holding court and would there
alter do work in the main office. One more
than the present number of clerks only it
needed to carry out this plan.

Second Analysis of the
Powder in Butler's
Hat.
The Alleged Murderer Could
Have Committed Suicide if
So Inclined.
Another English Sbip Captain R cog
nizes the Prisoner Among a Lot
of His Swanhilda Shipmates-
Butler, the accused murderer of Lee
Weller, was not permitted to receive many
visitors yesterday at the City Prison. His
callers were principally people . with suf
ficient personal influence to eet by the
turnkey, or men brought there to see if
they recognized the prisoner.
There was an exception made in But
ler's list of visitors when a half dozen of
his shipmates from the Swanhilda re
quested to talk to bim.
Tbey greeted him in a warmhearted
manner and declared their honest belief
in his innocence.
One of the sailors produced a handker
chief in good need of washing, which he
said be had found in Butler's bunk.
"I've been offered a pound for this wipe
of yours," he declared, "but I'll not
sell it."
Butler laughed and said tbere were lots
of cranks in this country.
The other sailors showed a tobacco
pouch and a pipe as well as some other
trinkets, each man taking pride in saying
how he had discovered the relics in But
ler's bunk after the detectives had made a
search of it.
The powder found in Butler's hatband
when he was captured on the Swanhilda
has again been analyzed by means of the
sulphuric acid process, a final test. The
result is the same as puDilabed a few days
ago. The powder proved to be strychnine
in sufficient quantity to surely kill five
men.
Butler has been identified again as
Richard Pascoe, a West of England sailor
who arrived in this port on the British
ship Dalbardern Castle in 1890. Captain
Jones of the British ship Flintshire has
recognized the prisoner.
"Butler was a sailor on the Castle,"
said Jones, "and I was the vessel's first
officer. We came to this port from Swan
yea with coal. Pascoe, as we knew him
on board, had been mailing in coasting
vessels, so he said, and came originally
from the west of England. I had an ex
perience "with him that caused me tore
member him well.
"Soon after the ship sailed from Swan
sea the fellow began to m*ke trouble. He
was quiet the first few days out, but soon
showed his ugly spirit. He quarreled
with the sailors and fought.
"Butler became so unruly he had to be
placed in irons."
Butler spent an uneventful day in the
City Prison yesterday. Few visitors were
permitted to see him and a large number
had to go away disappointed.
He was anxious to make as presentable
an appearance as possible in the Federal
court to-day, and at his request the ser
vices of E. P. Roche, the barber, on Lar
kin street, opposite the hall, were called
into requisition. Captain Robinson was
care to handcuff .Butler's bands behind
his back, so that be could not get a chance
to obtain possession of tbe razor, if he felt
that way inclined.
There is a growing feeling that Butler
has no desire to return to Australia to be
hanged for his fiendish crimes and that he
will avail himself of the first opportunity
to end his life. Every possible precaution
is consequently being taken by Captain
Robinson and the City Prison officials to
prevent such a contingency so long as he
remains in their charge. ; A trusted
"trusty" is in the cell with Butler all
night, and during the day he is con
stantly under surveillance. Â
Captain Lees, is patiently waiting for
developments in regard to Butler's life in'
Canada, and feels satisfied that he will be
successful before Butler leaves for Aus
tralia. ___-_â _Â»Â«__^_
Delinquent Taxes und Jury Fees.
City and County Attorney Creswcll has
rendered to Auditor Broderick the following
opinion: "
"I am of the opinion that the claim of a
juror against the City lor jury fees cannot be
allowed by the Auditor without first deduct
ing therefrom the amount due the treasury
from the juror for delinquency in the pay
meat of his taxes. The tax is a debt due the
treasury within the meaning of section 82 of
the consolidation ac, which provides, among
other things, that 'no demand upon the treas
ury shall be allowed Dy the Auditor in favor
of any person or officer in any manner in
debted thereto without first deducting the
amount of such indebtedness.'
"In the concurring opinion in the case of
the San Francisco Gas Company vs. Brick
wedel (62 Cai., 643). the following language
occurs: 'A taxpayer should not be allowed to
have a claim against a municipal corporation
satisfied when he owes to such corporation the
money which goes to furnish the means of
discharging his claim.'
EMOTIONAL BANKRUPTCY.
James McLean Telia the Story of How
Ills Insolvency Was Caused by
Mrs. Snsin E. Currie.
James McLean is a picturesque bank
rupt. He owes $815 43, according to his
own statement, yet bas assets that in his
estimation ought to yield $48,288. This is
almost equal to the New Orleans man that
General Grant used to tell about who was
reckoned by his neighbors to be worth
$50,000 because he had two bull pups
valued (by him) at $25,000 each.
Mr. McLean has a formula for insect
powder, which he thinks is really worth
$15,000, and he has a contract for the right
to make and sell this commodity m, Aus
tralia, whereby he is to receive $14,278 and
profits on all sent from the Antipodes to
the United States. Nor is this all. Mr.
McLean says he has a right of action
against Mrs. Susan E. Currie for $20,000
damages for slander, and he might just
as well have made it $100,000 or $1,000,000,
for he admits that he knows nothing of
the lady's financial ability to respond in
case of successful litigation.
This fame lady, Mrs. Currie, holds his
note for $400, but he avers that it is tainted
by the fact that it was secured by durass,
namely, threats to prosecute for alleged
wrongdoing. He alleges that his insol
vency grows out of the persecution of Mrs.
Currie, who drove all his customers from
him.
Judge Slack will hear this comic-opera
bankrupt at an early date and decide his
fate according to the law and the facta.

' Having ascertained by a careful exam
ination of the streets of the City tbat at
least 170 gas lamps are burning in such

A resolution was adopted and ordered
transmitted to the Legislature requesting
the San Francisco delegation and petition
ing all other members to vote against any
bill to increase the salaries of officials or
employes of this City and County, on the
ground that tbe people have unequivocally
declared in the State constitution their
opposition to any tendency on the part of
the Legislature to interfere in the regula
tion of "municipal affairs." The present
system of city government was declared
defective, and the fact mentioned that
strong efforts are now being made to secure
a new charter to obviate all existing evils.
The board stated its intention to render
all the assistance possible to the Sixth
street Improvement Club in its endeavors
to secure a new pavement and a modern
electric railway for that thoroughfare.
The attention of the board having been
called to the fact that there is now in the
hands of the executors of the Donahue
estate $25,000 for the purpose of erecting a
fountain at the junction of Bush, Battery
and Market streets, a committee was ap
pointed to confer with the executors of

final number on the card. It is safe to
predict that if Charley had the leg up on
a Government mule in a stake race to-day
his mount would go to tbe post favorite.
The track was slow and the favorites
seemed to have a touch of the same dis
ease, as a review of the afternoon's sport
develops tho fact that but one passed the
finishing line in front. If the talent got
the coin tbeir hilarity was ol the subdued
kind on the way bacK to this side.
In the linal race Jockeys Dojjgett and
McHugh had a narrow call from serious
injury. Doggett bad the mount on the j
favorite, imp. Fulierton Lass, while Mc- I
Hugh piloted Franco. As tho bunch was !
nearing the bend to the homestretch there I
was some crowding, and both animals I
mentioned fell. Fortunately, beyond a i
severe jolting, neither rider suffered in- j
jury.
The erratic mare Heartsease opened an j
even. money chance for the opening j
six-furlong sprint, and if she ran
as fast as she could is deserving !
of a high place in the harm ot â 
some breeding establishment, far, far j
away from any place where men gamble. '.
Roadrunner, a 6 to 1 chance, ridden by 1
Patsy Freeman, won easily from Soola- ,
ciain, with Monitor running into tbird
place.
Next was a two-year-old lottery drawing
at three and a balf furlongs. Ezell's pair,
On Gua Nita and Siva, coupled, were sec
ond choice in the betting, with Duke of \
York, at odds of 3 to 2, occupying the
place of honor. Thorpe lifted Count of !
Flanders in winner by nearly a length |
from Don Luis, while On Gua Nita secured
the show.
Chapter three of this awful carnage |
among the first choices shows Woodland j
Belie galloping to the post an 11 to 10 favor- i
ite over a field of eleven platers in a five '
and a half furlong scramble. The bets
looked good until Thorpe came hustling \
along on Roltair. a 7 to 1 outsider, which
.shed a shadow of gloom by finishing two |
lengths in advance of the Belle.
Morte Fonse looked strange as he came j
out for the fourth event, over a mile,
carrying a jockey sporting green colore, j
' but he was perfectly at home when it :
came to racing. Cabrillo ruled a 3 to 1 I
favorite in the ring, with Morte Fonse a
well- backed second choice.
Silverado, a 200 to 1 shot, made the '
running for half the distance, where the '
favorite took it up. He looked a winner !
to witbin a few strides of the wire, when I
. Thorpe on Morte Fonse, coming with a !
ereat rush, snatched victory by a head, j
Ransom was a close third.
About the best betting race of the day
was the five and a half furlong sprint that
followed, with Scotch Rose, Etta H, The
Sinner, Lou Lou R and Lost Girl as I
starters. Scotch Rose closed a Blight 1
favorite over Etta H, and in the hardest I
kind of a drive got the decision from that j
gocd filly by a bead. Tne Sinner was
third, but a neck further away.
The final six-furlong run, decided under

NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL.
What Some of the Visiting Turf
men Think of the Racing
Game Here.
Statements cf Some (f the Eastern
Press Not Borne Out by
Plain Facts.
Never in the history of racing in the
j State haa such high-class sport been wit
i nessed as that furnished at the local track
; controlled by the Pacific Coast Jockey â 
j Club and at the new course of the Cali
j fornia Jockey Club across the bay. Kin
| dred racing associations in other States
, where winter racing is conducted have j
j sought through the press in different
â¢ parts of the country to throw soot by in- â .
i timating that the game here is on tne
| ragged edge and that the local and East
ern spor.s "are all broke." How true
these reports are may be gleaned from. the
following interviews with the most promi
nent of the visiting Eastern owners, book
makers, jockeys and betting men:
Tha racing is first-class in every respect and
! equal to any I have seen in years; is a grand
| place to winter, and I like it very much.â Da- i
vid Gideon.
j I was never more surprised. Two beautiful i
I tracks and as good raeins aa any one would
I care to see.â C. H. Pettingill.
j Contrary to the reports East, lam surprised \
i to see good betting and first-class racing here. j
! Twenty-four books on and no trouble for me
to place sl! the money I want to bet.â George
E. Smith (-Pittsburg Phil").
It is surely the best winter racing event ever
: held in this country. It is certainly very hon
i est, and will compare favorably "with any
i racing in the East. â George A. Wheelock.
Xo place adapted for winter racing like this.
Both tracks elegant; first-class racing and the
management splendid.â Charles F. Dwyer.
I find that the racing at the two tracks here
j is up to tho highest standard. For a racing
I point during the off season in the East lt can
! not be excelled. â C. R. Grannan.
Racing is as clean and as good as I have seen
on any track at any time of the yetr.â Ed Cor-
I rigan.
, San Francisco is certainly fortunate in having
two such racetracks as lngleside and Oaklanu,
each complete ln every appointment. The
! racing is clean and clear of all scandal.â Frank
I Ireland.
The racing in California this winter is equal
to any given at any racetrack in the country.
The class of horses competing is above the
average for winter sport, and the money they
I run for larger than ever at this season of the
year. The tracks in this vicinity are equal to
any on the continent, being superb ones to
race over and equipped. with all that is needed
to make a first-class establishment in every
respect. Eastern horsemen will soon realize
this aud in the future make California their
winter port.â 11. Daniels.
This is the best racing I have seen in ten

years. First-class sport and first-class betting.
âBarney Schreiber.
Unquestionably the Citj\of San Francisco is
the desired spot for racing during the winter
months. The racing compares favorably with
the sport on the Eastern tracks in the height
of the summer season. â Harry Harris.
Both tracks elegant. Better racing than I
thought would be had in the winter.â
Dunne. ' ' ,'-
Two grend tracks. Racing as good as I have
seen anywhere in summer.â W. P. Magrane.
Racing first-class. Have seen no better any.
where. Pick the winners and you can get all
the money you want.â H. Eugene Leigh.
ft is grand racing. Notning like it any
where.âDun Honig.
Have been here four seasons and I see
nothing but . Improvement every year. I
would not stay away. I consider it the best
racing in the Dnited States.â E. W. Purser.
Two exceptionally fine tracks. I never saw
any better racing. First-class and clean as a
whistle. Good betting as any track.â M.
Games.
I think it is the best place to race I ever
visited; plenty money and plenty good horses.
Racing first-class acid as nonest as it could
be.â William Wallace.
I never saw any better or cleaner racing at
any track in the summer. Two good tracks. â
William Beverly.
It is far better than anything I could have
hoped lor. No grander place or better racing
anywhere. W. H. cheppu.
Couldn't expect any better sport ; as good as
seen anywhere and the betting wonderful for
winter racing.â Martin Hughes and Peter
Reiley.
The tracks and racing are the best I ever
saw. Good-class horses and the racing clear
of anything but what it should be.â
Wooaford.
It cou la not be better. lam highly pleased
and would not stay away.â Doggett.
It is by far the best winter racing I've ever
seen, and I have been riding at all the winter
tracks. No better horses or jockeys anywhere.
1 like It very much.â Tod Sloan.
ltis the best winter racing I ever saw. I
enjoy it and would not remain away for any
thing.âCharley Thorpe.
lam greatly surprised. I did not expect to
see two such grand tracks and as good racing
as Is seen anywhere.â William Sims.
Since my arrival in San - Francisco, I have
attended the races every day. and am agree
ably surprised at the uniformly good attend
ance ana the splendid racing I have witnessed.
â.Max Blumenthal.
The racing in San Francisco this season is
the healthiest we have seen anywhere in the
past year. The better class of people attend,
and everything has a holiday air. The form
of the horses has been exiremely goodâ O'Neill
and Kckert.
Taking into consideration how far we really
are from the racing center I think I can safely
say that 1 have never attended better racing,
nor with as much satisfaction and pleasure as
I have derived from tho racing around San
Francisco. â John B. Coleman.
The best winter racing I ever saw. A grand
country. 1 like it very much and can't speak
too highly of it.â Henry Griffin.
Perhaps after a careful perusal of these
opinions expressed our Eastern friends
may conclude that California may subsist
through the season and that there are still
a few dollars in circulation.
WAS HE THE GRAFTER?
Charles B. Harkins Charged With Hav
ing Tricked T. E. Blomross
Out of ,O.
T. E. Blomross, the ship's carpenter,
who was tricked out of $20 by a grafter in
the City Hall Monday morning, swore to
a warrant in Judge Low's court yesterday
for ths arrest of "John Doe" on the charge
of misdemeanor embezzlement.
Suspicion had fallen upon Charles B.
Harkics, a man 32 years of age, who at
onetime held the position of a deputy
county clerk. Monday night a descrip
tion of Harkins was read to the police in
each district with instructions to arrest
him.
Policeman John Cronin saw Harkins on
Fourth and Mission streets yesterday
afternoon and took him to the City
Prison. T. J. Farrell, clerk of Judge
Low's court, who was asked for a blank
form cl bail by the grafter, had a look at
Harkinir, but although he resembled the
man he could not positively identify him
as he was busy at tne time he banded out
the form and merely glanced at the ap
plicant. SR@
Harkins was confined in the "tanks"
till Blomross could see him. Last night
Blomross called at the prison and imme
diately recognized Harkins. who was at
once booked on the charge. Harkins
claims that he can prove an alibi, but the
police say they have other evidence
against him besides the identification by
Blomross. Harkins was arrested Monday
afternoon along with two others on a
charge of disturbing the peace and was re
leased on bail.
A PARK FOR SACRAMENTO
Several Contracts Closed and
Capital Enlisted in This
City.
A Four-Lap Bicycle Track, Football
and Baseball Grounds to Be
Among tho Features.
If a project contemplated by members
of a league established in this City, Stock
ton- OaKland and Sacramento should
be eventually realized the last-named
city will receive an additional qualifica- |
tion for its metropolitan status. The ob
ject of the league is to establish what may
be fitly called an athletic park at the capi
tal, designed to be the largest and most
complete of its kind in Western America.
It is understood that either Oak or East
Park will be selected as its site, and with
this end in view, the promoters have se
cured an option of purchase on both
places. They will be guided in their final
choice by the wishes of the majority, and
as yet no definite arrangement has been
concluded.
The scheme includes the construction
of a four-lap bicycle track, composed of
Ii inch boards placed edgewise, similar
to the Velodrome track, but two laps
larger and eight feet wider, a clubhouse of
twenty rooms, baseball and football
grounds to be laid in the ample space af
forded inside the track and a scenic rail
way to cover the entire park.
The cost of these attractive features
without the scenic railway will probably
be something like $8000. In addition to
the foregoing the athletic grounds will be
provided with a handsome grand stand
capable of accommodating comfortably
3000 persons. The clubrooms will also be
fitted up for tbe reception of local and vis
iting club*, and every modern convenience
is to be afforded in this connection.
Another innovation almost superfluous
in . California will be an arrangement
whereby both the clubhouse and grand
stand can be inclosed during the winter,
so that the cool breezes of the nortb may
not visit the faces of the fair spectators
too roughly. '
The city of Los Angeles was at one time
considered as the probable location of the
park, but the league finally decided to
give Sacramento the preference, no doubt
on account of its proximity to the largest
centers of population.
W. N. Winans of Sacramento, who is
interesting capital in the project, was in
the City a few days ago closing various
contracts. : He returned to Sacramento on
the 7th inst. The most prominent business
men of that city are said to be connected
with this important undertaking, which
they are determined to bring to a success
ful issue.
The Southern Pacific Railway Company
was notified by its traveling representative
a few days ago that such a project was
being seriously discussed 'at the capital,'
and should subsequent conditions warrant
it, the road will run excursions to Sac
ramento from all adjacent points during
the holidays.

Work of the Fire Committee.
The Fire Committee of the Supervisors
opened bids yesterday for painting engine
house 6. The lowest bidder was William May,
$205. The committee will recommend the
placing of a fire-alarm box at Seventeenth and
Uranus streets, aud a hydrant at Piedmont
and Epstein streets. -
CUBA'S CAUSE
FINDS AID
Mascherini and Jones Are
Mustering Their
Forces.
A Mass-Meeting and Monster
( Petition Are Already
Planned.
The New York League Is Greatly
Pleased Over the Work Al
reaiy Done Here.
There was a great deal of joy at the
headquarters of the Cuban sympathizers,
2016 Mason street, yesterday because oi
the good prospects of obtaining the aid of
good citizens in the movement to extend
substantial aid to the struggling Cubans.
"We are receiving encouragement from
all over the coast," said Faust Mascherini
yesterday, "and I believe there are thou
sands of the people ready to fall in line to
aid us as soon as the movement assumes
tangible form. I have been visited by or
received letters from men located at
various points of the State, and nearly all
report considerable feeling and a good fol
lowing for the cause of Cuba. It needs
nothing but an organized movement here
to unify ana crystallize sentiment on the
coast.* '
The following letter is a sample of the
interest manifested at points outside of
San Francisco :
Sacramento, Cal., Feb. 9, 1897.
Dear Mr. Maecherini, Secretin Cuban League,
SOO6 Mason strict. San Francisco, Cal.â The in
closed newspaper clipping shows that you are
pushing ahead. I have been waiting for some
thing like this to happen before writing you.
I have been here working at the Legislature,
but will return to the city about March 1,
when I will call upon your league. X wish 1
could take a more active part In the move
ment, but 1 will wait and follow the leaders
in whatever movement they decide is right.
We must not falter, but show the world that
California is never the last In any movement
for the good of mankind in general. Jf you
can do any good by writing me do so, but do
not consume any of your valuable time, other

Messrs. Jones and Mascherini are going
among prominent citizens to-day and the
balance of the banks to present the claims
of the National Cuban League to them for
consideration. They propose to get a
monster petition and forward it to New
York ior the use of the head council of
the league, which body will bring the sub
ject to the consideration of Congress at as
early a date as possible.
"It is our purpose to have a few public j
meetings at an early day," said President
Jones yesterday. "We want to get such i
j speakers as ox-Judge Eugene Garber and |
j his uncle, the old Virginia waruorse, to |
I speak for Cuba. 1 think Colonel Charles ;
j L. Taylor and a number of the leading '
I pioneers will be in the movement with !
j some spirit and energy. I think we shall j
have one of the petitions at the Pioneer !
Society's rooms.
"It is such names as those that honor \
the roll of the pioneers that we want â !
! names of men of standing and influence. I
We expect to be able to induce the Hon. j
; Henry E. Highton to render us some sub- t
j stantial aid. He is a I great friend -of |
liberty, and he coulo portray the cause of
freedom in a manner tiiat would win
many friends to the cause. Another [
pioneer who has agreed to aid us is Oscar i
T. Shuck, the well-known author and !
attorney. He rejoices that Mayor Phelan j
I has shown his colors and he will help us. j
In the same category is Judge Van |
| Reynbgom, who believes it an outrage I
that the brave patriots down in Cuba |
j hove not received more recognition I
I abroad."
Secretary Mascherin ; yesterday received I
the following telegram from league head
quarters in New York:
Faust Mascherini, San Francisco: Thank
Mayor Phelan and all who have aided us in
your city. It is encouraging to feci that the
cause of human liberty finds such quick re
sponse in San Francisco.
D. Johnson, Secretary.

guished persons who have agreed to act as
vice-presidents of the Cuban League of the

The plan of organization which the local
league proposes to follow is that adopted
in New York, and outlined as follows in a
letter received from the New York head
quarters yesterday. In it Colonel Ethan
Allen says:
We would suggest that ypu secure a hall for
a public meeting. Notify each member of
your committee and have them sign the call,
naving the signature of your Mayor at the
head; then secure the added signatures of as
many more prominent, in linen â¢.ial citizens as
you can. For your meeting invito your strong
est, ablest and mosl patriotic speakers, and at
the meeting elect a board of officer* and adopt
resolutions (see suggestions in our resolutions
inclosed). After the meeting send copies of
the resolutions you adopt to your members of
Congress, also of your Legislature, and to this
office.
The petition to be circulated contains
the following, among otber declarations
for liberty:
Let ns so speak that the executive of this
Nation and our representatives In Congress
shall recognize Cuban independence, and all
will be well. We are not required to raise
battalions of men or to furnish ships of war;
but we are called upon to declare that the
heart of this Nation is with the oppressed
Cubans, and then, with her independence ac
knowledged, her unarmed heroes may obtain
from us as required the equipments of war,
as Spain has done heretofore, and thus we
blaze the way for a final victory, as surely to
follow as, in the end, right triumphs over
wrong.
Mayor Phelan will appoint the commit
tee of fifty to take steps to unify Cuban
sentiment here just as soon as he receives
a list of sympathizers from which to se
lect them. All persons who will partici
pate in the proceedings to free Cuba, or
who will add their names to the lists of
sympathizers are requested to send their
addresses to Secretary Faust Mascherini,
718 Greenwich street.
PLAYED THE RACES.
W. A. Speak Alias Spencer, a Book
keeper* Arrested for Felony
Embezzlement.
W. A. Speak alias Spencer was arrested
Monday on Eddy street between Powell
and Mason by Detectives Anthony and
Cody and taken to the City Prison where
he was booked on tbe charge of felony
embezzlement.
Speak was up to two weeks aso book
keeper at the Atlas Iron Works, Potrero.
His conduct did not meet with the ap
proval of Frank. Lester, the superintend
ent of the works ani two weeks ago bo
was discharged. â¢ ' * ; ;.' ', ; :
Lester's suspicions were aroused that
Speak'a accounts were not straight and an
expert was called in and has been work
ing on the books since then. A deficiency
of $3CO was first discovered and finally, as
the examination continued, it was de
veloped that there was a shortage of
$1055.
Lester notified police headquarters Mon
day and Anthony and Cody were de
tailed on the case, resulting in Speaks
arrest that night. |
Speak is 31 years of ago, and the detec
tives say that ho has been plunging at the
racetrack, which accounts for his defalca
tions.
Speak treats his arrest lightly. He
would not say more than there might be
something in it, but it would be all right
He had an appointment with Lester Mon
day afternoon and was surprised when
the detectives arrested him.

Sir. Colt to Go Km! and Listen to Vari
ous Preachers.

gregation will be in no particular hurry to
do so. The pulpit will be supplied by
different pastors until a final decision is
reached.
Mr. Colt, a prominent member of the
congregation, will go East shortly to listen
to various preachers of note, so that possi
bly Plymouth's new pastor may come
from the East. .::-.-:
Rev. Dr. Williams has not yet decided
upon any definite pians, but it is rumored
that he, too, will go East.

JURORS ABUSED
Old Man Reynolds Calls
Them All Perjured
Villains.
_
-Waiter Hinkiey, a Member of
the Pane', Violently
Assaulted.
Official Investigation of the Matter
:'.: Is to Be Mdc in Open Court
ToMorrow.
â¢ "Here, you perjured villain, don't you
cry to get away!" shouted old Mr. Bey
. noids, father of Thomas Reynold*, in the
main corridor of the New City Hall, near
Judge Carroll Cook.
Walter Hinkiey felt the desperate grip
Of the venerable man on his arm and tried
.to shake it off.
â¢ "Don't you dare to run away till I have
told you that I think you and all your as
. sociates are murderers and perjured vil
lains," shouted Reynolds.
, " Still Hinkiey struggled and at last got
.Jree.
'â¢.-â¢ "How dare you find my son guilty on
/ the testimony of a man liKe Charles Her
.old?" shouted Reynolds, and then for the
I â : rst time Hinkiey knew why he was be
â Fis;.- assaulted, for in the melee he had
.'not recognized his assai.ant as the father
of the unfortunate young man who had
"been convicted of burglary in the second
degree by a jury, of which Hinkiey was a
member, in Judge Cook's court litst Fri
i day.
â¢â¢: The old father of the young culprit was
1 overcome by sorrow aud grief, and had
o'versteppert the bounds of right and pro
. prjety in offering resentment. If lie had
s'topDed there it is probable that nothing
. further would have been heard of the
â  affair, for practical men mafce allowances
â¢'for the excesses of old age and youth.
Reynolds' lirst outburst, as recounted
here, occurred on Monday, but no report
"of his conduct was given to the court,
though the gentleman insulted was at
â¢. that moment on his way to the jury-room,
having been impaneled in a different case,
and being an oflicer of the court was under
. the special protection of the law.
Yesterday Reynolds repeated this of
: fense in a different manner. He stood in
the corridor and railed at the members of
Judire Cook's jury panel whenever he saw
Ihem. â¢ The citizens who acted in the trial
\of young Reynolds are os follows: J.
Bremer, Moritz Dnbner, T. Frahen, W. E.
Lovpjov, Walter HinKlev, W. H. Tiegier,
11. Bend it, C. Silk, Jacob Lohman, G.
Behind ler, J. H. Becker, Joseph Orr.
â¢= Several oi these gentlemen were on duty
in trials yesterday, ami they haa to run
the gauntlet of the wrath of Reynolds
â¢ pere for their verdict against the son.
'There they go, the murdering vil
. lams!'' he would shout. "Loot at 'em,
.the perjured scoundrels!" he would add,
'as the attention of the bystanders would
be directed toward the hastening jurors,
ea^er to get beyond the range of Reynold*'
-.raucous voice.
Then it was thought that patience had
ceased to be a virtue and a statement of
tae matter was made to Judge Cook,
, whereupon his Honor askea that the
proper ; tri l.ivit be presented, in order
: mat an official investigation might be
I trade to-morrow morning.
\ ; Judge Co remarked that he was dis
â  posed to deal leniently with a parent in
Tribulation, but he deemed it hi* duty to
protect the jurors and other officers of his
court from outside interference or insult
of any character.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Opening of the Big State Circuit at
Petaiuma on Washington's
Birthday.
â  ' Th.c meet scheduled for next Saturday
afternoon at the Velodrome will not take
place. In fact under the present strained
. relations between the racing men and
Manager Fawcett it seems hardly likely
that any meet will be held there for some
time to com*. Dave Shafer has quartered
his big team of professionals at San Jose
. .find declares he will not let them ride at
1 tbe Velodrome, and as he has in his
' string Ziegler, Loughead, McFarland,
â¢ Wells, "Bob" TerrilJ, Stevens, Becker and
all the best professionals now here, his
I withdrawal makes the prospects look slim
' for. good meet at the Velodrome just at
'â¢present.'
The proposed Stale circuit is to be
.opened at Petaiuma on Washington's birth
day, the 22d inst., and everything points
to the circuit being a big success from the
start. .' The Petaiuma wheelmen will have
charge of the meet there, and have ap
pointed the following well-known gentle
men to handle it: F. A. Wi'kerVham,
"U. C. Byce, H. B. Higbee, F. K. Lippitt,
H. J. Hopkins and George Murphy.
The programme for the opening day will
be a one-mile professional, open, prizes
$50, $25 and $15; one-half mileprofes
. sionai, open, prizes $40, $20 and $10; two-
J mile record race, professional, Hying start,
".paced, prizes $(50, $30 and $10; live-mile
â  invitation, amateur, paced, prizes valued
at $35, $25 and $10, the following to be in

SCIENTIFIC AID
FOR AGRICULTURE
First Session of Farmer's
Institute Opens
To-Day.
- ,
Lectures on Pastoral Subjects
by Learned Professors
in Order.
lateresting Programmes Prepared for
Both Occasionsâ Mean of
the Innovation
A Farmers' Institute, under the aus
pices of the University of California, will
be held at Academy of Sciences Hall, be
ginning to-day. There will be two ses
sions, to-day and to-morrow composing
one and February 24 and 25 tbe other.
The committee having the institute in
charge is composed of H. H. Taylor, S. F.
Thorn and Victor L. O'Brien. It has de
voted a great deal of time and earnest
work to the preparation necessary for
such an undertaking, and in great pari
its beneficial results will be due to their
efforts.
In order to obtain a clear comprehen
sion of the purposes of the institute it is
necessary to mention the fact that the
law of the State imposes upon the uni
versity of California a duty to disseminate
that scientific knowledge essential to
the success and prosperity of agriculture.
The university has determined to give
the department of agriculture the atten
tion its importance demands, and in
order to accomplish such object the board
of regents- of t: c university has arranged
to hold fifty meetings, known as larmers'
institutes, in various parts of the State.
It is believed that the subjects discussed
at these institutes and the exchange of
opinion that will take place will not only
be the means of extending the influence
of the university, but will result in iormn
lating and teaching. the most approved
and economical meiho.ls for developing
the resources of the State. Admittance
in all cases will he free.
The following is the programme for the
two sessions to be held iv San Francisco:
Wednesday evening. February 10. 8 o'clockâ
1. "The Work ol me College of Agriculture,"
Professor E. W. Hilgard. Professor Hilgard,
who is the head of the College' of Agriculture
and dlrcc'or of the United States experiment
stations, will describe tlio work of the college,
including the Farmers' Institute, showing
what it has done, what it is now doing and
what it proposes to do.
'A. Highways: (a) "Highway Conditions in
California" (Illustrated with stereopticou
views), (6) "The Interest of Municipalities in
Good Koads for Farming Districts/ Marsdeu
Manson, Ph.D., 5.11.C. There are those who
think that the greatest unnecessary burden
which the farmer now boars is the excessive
cost of hauling farm produce and supplies
oyer bad roads, and that the city as well as the
country suffers greatly thereby. Mr. Manson,
State Highway Commissioner, will discuss
these phases of the subject and explain the
measures proposed by the Highway Commis
sioners to remedy this evil.
Thursday evening, February 11, 8 o'clockâ
1. "The l Profitable \ Uses of Small Pieces 1 of
Land," Mrs. Harriet X. Conness. This paper
is designed for the benefit of city residents of
small means who. wish they could live on a
farm. Mrs. Conness has been. asked to de
scribe, not so much what other people might
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1897.
do as what she herself has done with small
pieces of land.
2. "City Farmers' Clubs," Alfred Holman.
Mr. Holman will describe how the farm
owners of other American cities have organ
ized themselves for useful work In the promo
tion of agricultural prosperity, and make some
suggestions looking to similar organizations
in San Francisco.
Wednesday evening, February 24, 8
o'clockâ l. "Dairy Bacteria," Professor C. W.
Wood worth. A popular discourse upon the
minute organisms ' which multiply in mils
and milk products; some of them of great
value, others highly injurious and danger
ousâiniormation of direct importance both
to tee housekeeper and the dairyman.
2. "Grasses and Forage Plants for California
Dairymen," Professor E. J. Wickson. The
forage interest is one of the largest in the
world. In a climate of rainless summers
there are some uniavorable conditions which
it is sought to overcome. Professor Wirkson
will describe what progress has bÂ»en made in
this State as a result of the work of the ex
periment stations. While dairymen hare thus
far shown the most active interest in this sub
ject, it Is reaiy as interesting and important
to other farmers as to dairymen.
Thursday evening, February 25, 8 o'clockâ l.
"Arid and Humid Lands and the Alkali Prob
lem," Professor E. W. Hilgard. Professor Hil
gard will deal in a broad way with one of the
greatest agricultural problems of Western
America. He will explain the progress thus
far made by the Anglo-Saxon race in dealing
with conditions now faced by it for the first
time, aud which other races have been pow
erless to overcome.
2. "California as a Competitor in the Sugar
Market,", Dr. Julius Koebig. Dr. Koebig, who,
as a consulting chemist and engineer, has been
concerned in the manufacture of beet sugar
both in this country and Europe, will descrite
our exact condition as a competitor for the
sugar trade and give his views of the value of
the sugar industry to the land-owners and
business men of California.
WILL BE CREMATED TO-DAY

The funeral of the late Captain L, C.
yon Buncker will be held this afternoon

Veterans. The remains will be cremated j
at Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
Mr. yon Buncker died on Monday last,
after a long illness. He was a native of
New Orleans, where before the war he
was encaged in the commission business
and was quite wealthy. Upon the break
ing out of hostilities he organized a com
pany of the Twentieth Louisiana Cavalry,
which he commanded with distinction for
two years. Tue regiment became so deci
mated in that time through fighting and
exposure that it became necessary to re
organize it. ) .- '"â ::
Captain yon Buncker was promoted at
this time anu sent as major to the Second
Brigade of Ruggles' division, serving in
tbc trans-Mississippi department until
the close of the war. The war left him
; poor. He went >.% Mexico and recouped
hts fortune in the silver mines. Later he
: lost heavily through speculation. He
came to Ran Francisco in the employ of
the Commercial Union Assurance Com
pany, with John Roe Hamilton, in 1873.
Later he became the assistant manager
here under C. F. Mullens as manager.
He had a great many friends in this City.
He was unmarried.

Orders of dismissal have been filed in the
suits of William Doolan in his own proper
person and as executor of the estate ol Mar
garetta Doolan against Kyland B. Wallace and
William Giselman, executors of the will of the
late P. Clinton Hustings. These cases have
been in court lor several years. An argument
for dismissal on account of settlement of the
dispute has been signed by Attorner* Piatt <Â£
Boyue, Crittenden a. Van Wyck and J. D. Sul
livan.
Dipsomaniac Hospital Not Needed.
Mayor Phelan has advised Senator J. H.
Mahoney that San Francisco does not need a
dipsomaniac hospital ata cost of $300,000. A
pÂ«rt of the Mayor's letter is as follows:
"Members of the Board of Health say they can
easily provide a ward for dipsomaniacs in said
hospital, which will obviate the necessity
and expense of a 'Municipal Hospiftit for
Diseases of the Nervous System.' "

FORTY DOLLARS
TO SHOUT HELLO
That Is the Daily Cost to
This City and
County.
Supervisor Rottanzi and the
Mayor Will Talk About
This Fact.
In tbe Meantime the January Bill of
the Telephone Company Is
Held Over Unpaid.
The mere saying of "hello" costs the
City ana County of San Francisco an
nually between $13,000 and $14,000. Last
year, to be exact, San Francisco's official
"hellos" cost $13,937 06. These figures are
dug out of the report of Auditor Broderick,
which no one will deny. That is at the j
rate of $3 80 per hour for every day in the
year, counting a day as ten hours. With j
the Sunday and holiday out it is over $40
per day, which may be considered a little
high, in view of the tact that so few of the
public officials have musical voices and
that times are hard.
"Why should not the City and County
bave telephones free?" This suggestion
has come from ' Supervisor Rottanzi,
chairman of tne Finance Committee.
"The new telephone company," says
Supervisor Rottanzi, "voluntarily offers
free telephones to the City and County as
a condition attendant upon the granting
of its franchise. They will furnish a large
number at first and more as they are
needed.
"At any rate," said the Supervisor, "I
have disapproved of the bill of the tele-,
phone company for January, and have
he dit out. I understand that the com
pany charges different rates to different
persons. The City ought to have a better i
arrangement than It now has. There is
no contract. lam going to have a con
ference with Mayor Phelan about tbis
matter." :â¢ .V*' 'â¢'-â  ','â¢:â  : -->

M. LIVINGSTON'S OATH.
lie Swears That It Was Not Adminis
tered in the Insolvency Pro
ceedings.
The case of Meyer Livingston, charged
with perjury, is occupying the attention'
of an intelligent jury in Judge Wallace's
court. Livingston and his brother. Max,
filed a petition in insolvency, wherein it
appeared that he had been robbed of $3300.
This statement, was discredited, and the
Livingstons were arrested for perjury and
granted separate trials.
In defense of himself Meyer testified,
under oath, that he never swore to the
affidavit in insolvency. He admitted that
he signed it, but declared that Notary
Public Wheat neglected to administer thÂ«%
usual oath. In this Meyer is corroborated
by his brother. Max.
Mr. Wheat iB dead, and therefore it is
not probable that any contradictory evi
dence will be produced. The case wiil be
decided by the jury to-day. If an acquit
tal is rendered the case against Max Liv
ingston will bo dismissed.
LEGISLATION CONSIDERED
Directors of the C amber of
Commerce Discuss Several
Measures.
President Craig Thanked for His
Efforts Against the Half-
Pilotage Liw
The directors of the Chamber of Com
merce at a meeting yesterday afternoon
adopted a memorial to the State Legisla
ture, for the abolition of the compulsory
half-pilotage law, in so far as it affects
American vessel-'. President Hugh Craig
was unanimously tendered a vote of
thanks for his efforts against the ob
noxious provision while in Sacramento.
The directors also discussed the pro
posed indorsement of the bill at present
before the Legislature, providing for an
appropriation of $70,000 to support a Cali
fornia exhibit at the Omaha Trans-Mts
sissippi Exposition, the sense of the ma
jority favoring a request for a sum suffi
cient to cuarautee the State suitable
representation, but no more. . A J. .--.
The board supported the bill for the
improvement of the waterways of the
State; as also another measure empower
ing tnree-fourths of a jury to return a
verdict in criminal cases.
: A new map now in course of prepara
tion by the executive of the State Devel
opment Committee was submitted by Wil
liam M. Bunker, tbe chairman of that
body. A communication accompanied
the above, in which the committee stated
that it is proposed to issue an edition of
100,000- expressly devoted to this City.
These maps will also include carefully
executed naif-tone cuts, together with a
description of San Francisco, and will be
published, if possible, prior to the carnival
and the Christian Endeavor Convention.

Victor Voce Fader, 1951 Howard street, was

FIREBUGS IN THE
BOSTON DAIRY
Deliberate Attempt to Burn
Down the Build
ings.
A Large Roil of Paper Satur
ated With Coal Oil Used
as a Firebrand.
The Police and Fire Marshal Tiwe
Are Investigating tbe Case
ani Have a Clew.
A deliberate attempt to destroy by fire
the Boston Farm Dairy, 217 Seventh
street, is being investigated by the police
and Fire Marshal Towe.
The dairy is a large establishment and
extends from Seventh street through to
Moss street. In the front is the office
and storeroom and in the rear the stables
and hayloft. In the stables are fifteen
valuable horses. The buildings are en
tirely of wood and would burn like tinder.
I Thonde Regli, the can-washer, sleeps
upon the premises in a room leading off
the hayloft to the front. Monday morn
ing about 6:30 o'clock Regli had returned
from having his breakfast in a restaurant,
and he assisted the stableman in hitching
up some horses. Tbe stableman and
I Regli were the only persons on the prem
ises, as by that time all the drivers had
left on their routes. 'â >.?*>
After the stableman drove off Regli
went upstairs to his room to change his
clothes. He noticed the glimmer of a
light ln the rear of the loft, but thinking
it came from the window of a house on
Moss street be paid no attention to it.
Regli changed his clothes, and when ne
came out of his room the light had spread
and he knew that something was wrong.
he ran to the rear of IV e loft and discov
ered a big roll of paper burning on one of
the rafters close to the wall. He grabbed
hold of it and tried to blow it out. but
failed. Rushing to a tank he seized a
bucket and soon had the flame extin
guished.
The roll of paper had been steeped in
cor.l oil and had burned about half
through. The rafter had just caught lire,
and if Keek had been a few moments
later in making his discovery tbe proba
bility is that the tire would have got be
yond control.
Regli in that event would have been in
a serious predicament. j His only mode of
retreat would have been cut oft, except by
jumping from a second-story window to
the ground.
The police were notified of the incen
diary attcmDt and yesterday morning
Fire Marshal Towe was communicated
with.
lt is believed that the incendiary was
thoroughly familiar with the premises

and Resli's habits. When Regli went
to bis breakfast in the mornings he always
left the stable door, which open Â» on M 033
street, unlocked until he returned.
Daring the time that Regli was at
breakfast the incendiary had slipped into
the building through the stable door and
had gone into the loft with the saturated
roll of papers. Regli had apparently re
turned sooner than the incendiary ex
pected and it is supposed he had become
alarmed and had thrown the burning
paper on the rafter instead of among the
hay as was presumed to be bis intention.
Then he watched his opportunity and
slipped out while Regli was assisting the
stableman to hitch the horses.
''Of course," said Sanders yesterday,
"I can't say who the incendiary i?, but I
have my suspicions. It could "only have
been done by some one out of revenue,
and I think I have a good idea of the
man. It wonld not do for me to say
wnom I suspect, as I might be wrong, and
if I was right it might defeat the ends of
justice. I will do everything I can to
help the police in finding the calprit."
To guard against a repetition of the at
tempt Sanders will employ a special
watchman, and has ordered Regli in
future not to leave the stable door un
locked when at his breakfast. % ~JA. ",

Explanation.
1 lie arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it, If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiah" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but wheu the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars. of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NFW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 0.-Spesulatlon was
extremely dull to-day, with the sole exception of
tbe industrial group in which there was free sell
ing. Sugar had less liquidation. The sharp rise
in Sugar just previous to the close yesterday
roved to have been nothing more than an effort
on the part of certain operators to get short at a
higher line. Tobacco made an equally sharp de
cline, opening at 71' i and later selling at 09%-
Leather preferred yielded about a point. In the
total transactions of 152.053 for the entire list
sugar figured for 46,600 acd Tobacco for 14,600
share
Despite the tes imony of Messrs Havemayer
and Searles of the sugar trust, showing the enor
mous earnings of the property, holders of the
Shares display uneasiness for the fear that the
Lexow investigation will lead to unfavorable legis
lation. The rumor that Cbarles Flint of the rub
ber trust would be called n xt by the committee
caused that stock to decline 2%ft4.V8 The c
were only 977 shares of the preferred stock chang
ing hands. Consolidated gas stock was bold down
on the introduction of a bid authorizing the Board
of Aldermen of New York as to the feasibility of
municipal ownership of gas plants.
Despite the dullness railway stocks held re
markably firm. Reeling was the only stock that
could be called weak and tbe decline In this In
stance was less than a point. As a rule, after
merely fractional concessions at the opening the
prices improved Va@Vs per cent. Lake Shore on
purchases of 500 shares advanced IVa, The
trading 'w sis almost entirely proUssiona'. Specu
lation closed quiet, the tone being steady for the
railway list and weak for Industrials. Net
changes In industrials and coalers show losses of
V4Â«*Â» 7 /8. ""gar leading. The railway list scored

CHICAGO MARKETS.
- CHICAGO. 111., Feb. 9âThe market for wheat
was slow this morning. Local trading was the
only business, outsiders apparently dUplayiuz no
interest. While prices during the first half hour
were lower than those of yesterday the tone of
the market was firm. Lower Liverpool justified
the weakness in the start, but Northwestern re- j
ceipts, 352 cars, were also in a degree responsible.
Advices to the effect that spring wheat would
show an Increase from now on were received.
Receipts here were 47 cars, and 45,150 bushels
were taken from store.
Later reports of damage In the Southwest caused
prices to str-ugthen and advance. In this they
were assisted by Liverpool and by good clearances
at the seaboardâ 396,o79 bushels Tne closing
continental cables were all lower. Bradstreet's
reported a decrease In the world's stocks of 579.
--000 bushels. May wheat opened from 76' to

2 red spot wheat, 85%@87%c, closing at 86%Â©

CORNâ Displayed firmness, but little activity.
Receipts were 488. A proportion of yesterday's
weakness was undoubtedly due the 'larg- rati
mates; the trices to-day exhibited firmness in pro
portion to the shortage of receipts. Liverpool was
reported %d lower. Exports wen lloeral at
481.733 busuels, withdrawals from store 19.000.

WHEAT AND OTUJKIi GRAINS.
WHEAT FREIOHTS-Spot charters are now
only occasionally drawn and rates are nominal,
lhe chartered wheat fltet in port has a registered
tonnage of 18,200. against 45,b00 tons on the BamÂ»
date last year; disengaged 99,600 ions, against
50,100; on tne way to this port, 194,300 tons
against 109.. 00.
WHEAT- Northwestern Miller of February
5 says: -In India, according to the latest cabled
accoinls, the prospects are bad, owing to the lack
of winter rains, though it is probable that there
will not be so serious a failure as a onetime
seemed likely. Latest official accounts, dated De
cember 24, give 11,560,000 against 15,744,000
acres in lb9b-96 as the acreage sown in the four
principal divisions of India. The probability I?,
therefore, after all. that there will be 17,000,' 00
acres under Wheat In all India this year, which, a
an ordinary yield Â« acre, would mean a total crop
of 17.000,000 to 13,000.000 quar eis. This is a
serious falling off, compared witn the aye age In
dian cro .. which in years pievlous to 1*96 was
about 30,000.000 quarters l.at year's crop It
may be men. oned, was or.lv 22,000,000 quarters.
Under these circumstances it would not surprise
me to find India again entering the field as un im
porter ot Wheat before very long. The Australian
crop news is still to the effect that a certain quan
tity of foreign Whi at will have to he imported. "
The market rules dull, botn on and off call.

Weak Men and Women
Strength to the Sexual Organs. Â«Â«" n â¢ aaCENTENARY OF
MISSION SAN JOSE
Everything Will Be as I
Was a Hundred Years
Ago.
The Grand Procession Already
Occupies the Attention of
the Residents.
Although Four Months Ahead, Much
Work Has Already Been Ac
complished.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. f
Mission San Jose is already making
preparations for the centenary of its
founding on June 13.
The prominent resid-nts, business men
and others have all signified their willing
ness 'o combine forces, without reference
to creed or party, and to make the day
one of interest and pleasure to the visitors
who will go to see the mission as it was in
the historic past.
Ou the morning of June 13 mass will be
Â celebrated, and other ceremonies peculiar
to the time of the foundation of the Mis
sion will be held in the latter part of the
day. A procession of floats and other
features representing customs and man
ners of a century will be the leading num
ber on the programme. There will be
vaqueros, with their gaudily caparisoned
steeds; exhibitions of skill in riding fiery
mustanss, lassoing and taming wild and
unbroken colts, and many other features
unfamiliar to the modern Missionite will
be followed by a barbecue of good things
sufficient to feed at least 5000 people.
A large number of people is looked for
from all parts of tbe State. A delegation
from Mexico, another from Central Amer
ica, have signified their intention of visit
ing -the Mission at that time, and many
strangers who have heard of the Mission
. San Jose without a spark of interest, out
side the general one given to California
missions as a whole, will be present to
Witness the festivities.
The programme will so^n be issued, giv
ing full information regarding the details,
and all interested are doing everything in
" their power to make it a day long remem
bered in Alameda County.
The interest in the celebration is already
, quite general, and Â»t is certain that the
* affair will partake of the nature of a State
celebration.
Wanted the Coin.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 9.â Deputy
Coroner Henry Quellen was surprised
when a fisherman of this city called at the
morgue to-day and asked for information
as to how he could get the $10 allowed by

of a body from the bay. He said he found
one floating out on this side of Goat Island
and towed it to the other side, as this
county only paid $5. He was given the
necessary information.

' OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 9.â Senator F. S.

$1900 a year for firemen's relief, and the i
other a special tax for a relief and pension
fund. This latter provides that after
fifteen years' service one should be retired
on half pay if disabled. It will bo sug
gested that the members contribute to the
fund monthly, as do the police.

cil after six months' delay, even though it
be a majority protest.

City Central Comm ttee and did excellent
work during the campaign for tbe county
and National tickets. His opponent is a
City Trustee, and is said to have the. back
ing of Congressman Hilborn for the posi

Question of Ownership.
ALAMEDA, Cal, Feb. 9.â F. K. Krauth
| has been sued by J. J. Fleming for $750.
j claimed to be due him for the route ol the
I Encinal, recently sold to George F.
Weeks with the paper. Mr. Weeks sold
the route to W. P. Dillon, and now Flem
ing seeks a settlement. Mr. F'eming has
a bill of sale, given him by Herman G.
Mehrteins, proprietor of the Alameda
News Company, who assumed the route
and delivered the Encinal five or six
years ago. He bases his claim on this bill
of sale, and says it is worth $750.
Mr. Krauth agreed to deliver thÂ» paper,
route ana good will to Mr. Weeks and
hence he will have no recourse upon the
latter if he is beaten in the suit.

IN A DILEMMA
Statements Regarding Sal
aries Tak .mi at Their
Face Value.
Successful Candidates in 1898
Will Not Coin Fortunes
During Their Term.
By the New Schedule a Large Saving

Oakland Office Sax Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. . f
There never was a time when Alameda
County officials were so truly at sea as
they are just now. Some weeks ago the
legislative delegation sent to the princi
pals of the various departments of the
county government, a.-kmg for a detailed
sta ement of the expenses and receipts of
each lor the purpose of readjusting their
salaries.
The schedules were furnished, and to
say they were a surprise, to the public as
well as the legislators is putting it very
ml. diy. It was learned that instead of
making from $6000 to $15,000 some of the
officials were, according to their state
ments, which it must be borne in mind
were not sworn to, only making a bare
subsistence and carfare.
Accepting these statements in good
faith, the legislators went to work and re
arranged the whole system, so tnat instead
of receiving a lump sum, which they stated
was yearly paid out to deputies, a schedule
has been agreed upon which fixes a salary
for each of the principals and the number
and pay of the deputies.
Senator Stratton, who seems to have
taken the leading hand in readjusting the
salaries, stated that be has made up the
i schedule by allowing the officers what
they maKe now, as appears by their state
ments. These changes have been made
ostensibly on the ground of economy and
because of the pledges contained in the
county and State platforms. But it is
claimed that there are many other agen
cies at worx to bring about a reduction of
salary.
Ex-Mayor George C. Pardee telegraphed
to Senator Stratton to-day saying that the
gross allowance system in compensation
of county officers was better ior Alameda
County than net salaries and referred to
the expenses of the Assessor's office in
Alameda Connty as compared with that
o: Los Angeles. . Assessor Dalton's ex
penses last year were $26,000, while in Los
; Angeles, which is the same size as Ala
| meda County, the Assessor spent $41,000.
The county officials, while viewins the
pit which they have dug ior themselves,
are all trying to look pleasant, and are
congratulating themselves on the fact
that their salaries are not affected unless
they succeed- themselves in 1898. They
assert that the net salary plan is without
j doubt the best, provided sufficient allow-
I ance is made for deputies, but the present
schedule as completed by the Alameda
delegation does not provide for as liberal
salaries to deputies as are .now being paid
under the gross plan.
They say that if the salaries are cut
down to the proposed figure the Legis
lature should provide an entertainment
fund with each'otfice, to permit the in
cumbents to donate to church fairs, polit
ical and patriotic parades, soup kitchens
and all kinds of things to which they are
now expected to give liberally. To sum
up, some of them are now convinced that
their statements contained too much
rather than too little. /

CLERK'S ANNUAL REPORT
Each Vote Cast at the Genera'
E ection Cost Nearly a Dol
lar and a Halt
The New Fee Bi 1 R suited in Saving
a Few Thousand Dollars for
the County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway Feb. 9 f
County Clerk Jordan has just completed
his annual statement for 1896, and it is the
most elaborate and complete official re
port yet given to the public It shows in
detail the business of the county, involv
ing the receipt and expenditure of about
a million and a half of dollars.
Each of the departments can be in
spected at a glance and the various ex
penses of the different officials are plainly
set forth in such a manner that any one
interested in the government of the
county can easily inspect it. A notable
decrease appears in the matter of jurors'
fees in the Superior Court. Only $1700
was expended last year, as against $10,500
the preceding year, while the change in
the lee bill resulted in a saving of $4000 on
constable fees.
It is also seen that while tbe connty
conducts a farm near San Leandro there
were purchased last year hay and grain
worth $1420. and nearly $1000 worth of
vegetables.
The expenses connected with the regis
tration, advertising the Governor's procla
mation, pay of officers, rent of polling
places and stationery and supplies of all
kinds for ti.e general election amounted
to $31,150. This is a cost of about $1 50
lor each vote cast.
From a general statistical table it ap
pears that the assessed value oT property
in Alameda County is $93,854,072, and
there is no bonded indebtedness on the
county. Last year there were 77 persons
committed to insane asylums, 26 to State
prisons, 22 to reform schools, 11 to the
County Jail, 97 divorces granted and 1195
marriage licenses issued.

Th 9 Cub Will Probably Indorse a
Municipal Ticket Favor
able to Labor.
. Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. j
Representatives of all the recognized
trade and labor organizations have de
cided to take a practical part in the com
ing municipal election.
Last night a meeting was held and an
organization known as the Municipal Un
ion Labor Club was organized. The pur
pose of this club is clearly set forth in the
following preamble, which was adopted:
"The object of this club is for the ad
vancement and betterment of the condi
tion of wage-workers, the discussion â¢of
economic questions, and taking part in
municipal aftairs.
'â Its membership shall be composed of
active members of trades organizations,
provided, however, that no person who is
an active member of any political party
or a candidate of any political party for
any public office can be a participant in
the proceedings of this club."
The club elected C. D. Rogers, presi
dent; Thomas Feeny, vice-president, and
M. A. R .berts, secretary and treasurer.
An ex cutive committee from the various
unions was also elected.
Some days ago a body/railing itself the
"Labor League" placed before the voters
a ticket which it called a labor ticket.
The various unions comprising the Fed
eration of Trades know nothing regard
ing the "Labor League" and are anxious
to discover with whom it originated and
of whom it is composed. A committee of
three was appointed by the Labor Muni
cipal Club to inquire into the status of the
Labor League and to report next Monday
evening. It is very probable that the club
may indorse a complete municipal ticket
favorable to organized labor.
The Labor League whose ticket has
caused such interest is an offshoot of the
old Federal Labor Union, which was re
organized two weeks ago. Of th body
the well-known orator, Eugene H< ugh,
was the controlling spirit until he went to
a wider sphere of work' in the East some
months ago. J. T. Latimer is the secre
tary of the ieagu- and he declares that it
has a large and active membership.

Painful diseases arc bad enough, hut when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and . under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
whit they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubies. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the ; general health, but enlarged hls weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will taka
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of â¢ this â  wonderful treatment
free., Now, when 1 say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
â¢ I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at enca could
they but get such a remedy as the one thai
cured me. Do not try to study out how I ' can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mall the information, but send for it ana
learn that there are â¢ a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time of -happiness to most or us. Writer to

VALUE OF A GOOD TEMPER.
Peter Henderson's Wife Had a
Cheerlul Disposition Worth
A cheerful wife is worth $5000 in San
Francisco. At least that is the way in
which Peter Henderson assesses damages
against John W. Ferris and Thomas Da
vidson, who by their carelessness caused
Peter's wile, Margaret, to be injured by
an explosion. -. : â¢
The complaint sets forth that Mr. Hen
derson and his wife lived at 5 Rivoli
avenne, between Sixteenth and Seven
teenth streets, in this City, on February
12, 1895, when the defendants excavated a
lot near the Henderson residence and de
posited 9000 pounds of powder, which the
defendants did then and there "carelessly,
negligently, unlawfully and wrongfully
cause the said powder to expio le with
such force and violence that large quanti
ties of dirt and rock were thrown out and
through the air with great force, and a
violent concussion was caused; tnat said
Margaret Henderson was struck about the
head, hands, body and limbs by the rocks
and'dirt so thrown out, and was jarred and
shaken by the concussion, so that her
spine was injured and she has become an
invalid and her memory has been im
paired."
In estimating his damages Mr. Hender
son proceeds on the common law doctrine
that his wife is a Dart of his property and
ei-tat^; that he is entitled to his wife's
services and companionship, and that
whoever deprives him of those benefits
must respond in damages. Accordinsly
Mr. Henderson alleges that prior to the
accident here mentioned his wife Margaret
was a strong and healthy woman and had a
kind and amiable temper and disposition,:
and was of great assistance and a great
comfort and support to him. But since
the injuries then received her tempera
ment has changed and she has become ex
ceedingly nervous and fretful and has be
come an invalid and is unable to comfort
and assist him and to attend to his wants
and to che r him as she could and did
prior to her injuries
Mr. Henderson alleges that by reason of
his wile's great change of disposition and
temperament, and her being made an in
valid, and her memory being impaired,
allot which were caused by her injuries
received at the time of the explosion, he
has been caused great and irreparable in
jury and has been caused constant mental
pain and anguish and has been deprived
of the pleasure and comfort and benefit of
the society of his wife and has been de
prived of her services, by reason of all
which he has been damaged in the sum of
$5000. He also asks for $445 paid out for
medicine, physicians' services, nurses'
attendance and other matters of that char
acter. â¢ '"V':-v:"": â¢ "

MR. MARTY FAILS
TO FULLY EXPLAIN
He Was Granted a Hearing
by the Grand
Jury.
He Frankly Admits That the
Milk Contract Was Worth
$1000 to Him.
Morgan & Co. Have Not Signed lhe
Plans for Their Mission High
School Contract.
Frank ilarty, the milkman, was before
the Grand Jury nearly all of yesterday
afternoon, and when he came out of the
inquisitorial chamber he plodded down
the dismal hallways of the City Hall, his
hands in his pockets, his eyes on the stone
flooring, and refused to notice the repeated
salutations of an acquaintance. All the
outward indications of a bad humor were
present Mr. Marty had evidently been
having a bad two or three hours. He had
been asked all about that alleged offer of
$1000 to Supervisor Dodge for the securing
to him of the contract tor supplying milk
to the City and County Hospital and the
Almshouse.
Mr. Marty saw no particular harm in
the transaction. He told the jury flatly j
that the contract was worth $1000 to him. j
lie was asked a great many questions as
to the methods by which contracts nave |
been secured heretofore, but as to nearly (
all of these questions his memory failed
him.
When asked if the late Superintendent i
Stable of the City and County Hospital :
kept him waiting for his pay for the milk i
delivered Marty was quick to deny the :
seeming impeachment. He declared that j
Dr. Stable was promptness itself in this |
matter â no sooner was the month around i
tnan tbe superintendent paid the bill.
He was asked why it was that the late su
perintendent was so punctilious in the [
matter of the milk bill when it was quite
notorious that other creditors waited and j
watched in vain for what was duo them.
Mr. Marty did not know about this. No j
action was taken, but it need be no matter [
of surprise to Mr. Marty's friends if he is i
Indicted for attempted bribery, for that is I
on the cards.
A report will probably be made at the !
next session, on Friday, in the matter of I
the fake improvements at the City and j
County Hospital.
C. J. Besove resumed his testimony in j
the matter of the Mission High School j
contracts. Morgan & Co.'s plans and â 
specifications, which were not to be found I
when wanted last week, were beiore the !
jury, and it was discovered that they were ;
not oniy not signed by the Board of Edu- '
cation, but lacKed the signatures of the
contractors themselves. This is said to
be most unusual, as, unsigned, they do j
not bind. A report will be made in the
matter of this inquiry at the next session
also.
The following communication from Mor
gan & Co. was read:
To the Honorable the Grand Jury â Gen- ;
tlemen: Having noticed in Saturday morn- 'â¢
ings papers an article commenting on I
the award of the heating and ventilat- ',
in* contract for the new Mission High |
School to the undersigned, we would respect- [
fully call the attention of your honorable body
to the faus therein contained, whicn, out of
justice to all parties concerned, should, it
seems to us, be forthcoming at this time. The I
article as we saw it stated, first, '-that a num- i
ber of bids were presented for this work, but |
the School Directors selected the highest";
second, "thai a large number of experts were
called before you to give their views" (men- i
tioning five or six names).
With reierence to the first comment, the fol
lowing, which is a list of the different bids re- j
ceived, shows conclusively whether the under
signed was the highest bidder:
Heating and ventilatingâ P. \V, Co.: Bid 1 '
$9300 and $8335; bid 2, Â£8015 and $7385; bid I
3. (6335. Morgan Company: Bid 1, Â£7542:
bid -A, $7542; bid 3, (6220.
Watercioset bidsâ P. \V. Co., $1735; Morgan I
& Co.. $1954 and $1580.
Comparing the ab re bids or our first and I
best proposition of Â£7542 with P. W. Co.'s first !
and best proposition of $.1300, we were the 1
lowest by Â£1758 (bidding on the same specifi
cations oi the architects lor the work) and
comparing our work cheapest bids we were'
the lowest by Â£105. so that the board's ac- j
ceptance of our bid Ko. 1 not only sued the
City almost the entire cost of the closet work |
over our competitors' figures, but adopted a
system of heating and ventilating thiÂ«t has
been thoroughly tried and tested '.tithe Dudley
Stone school building on Haight street, and
found not only to work entirely satisfactorily,
butmoreleconomical in the matter of fuel than
any system in use in any of the City school*.
The price named in the paper of Â£9496
therefore not only saves the City money, but
included In addition tne heating and ventilat
ing apparatus, our best closet system as well.
As to the second comment, we notice that
the experts mentioned were in all cases people
engaged in the same lineof business as our
selves. While we should be very glad to have
finch member of the Grand Jury inspect tbis
system in the Stone building above referred to
and compare the practical results obtained
with any other system, we hardly expect that
you will hear any flattering comments or
hearty Indorsements of our apparatus from
those engaged in the same line of
work, aud mure particularly from those
who have failed to secure this contract.
The more the investigation from disinterested
parties the better we shall be pleased, and
our hope is not only that a thorough compari
son of our system and apparatus will be made
with any other, but that we may be one of the
parties to appear before your honorable body
to still further substantiate our position, as
not only ins the lowest bidder, but as hav
ing the best apparatus. Respectfully yours,
w. JI ORGAN & Co.

D. Leubrie on the Growing
Interest Among the

Elderly People Who Want to Escape
the Cold â Leubrio Here to Look
Up Various Details.
David Leubrie. a representative of the
Christian Endeavorer.a Chicago paper with
something over 100,000 circulation, is here
accompanied by his son, and is at the
Russ. â¢ . .
He has come to California to loot up
details in reference to the climate, the
cost of living and to delve into the various
subjects of interest to the Christian En
deavor people and their friends. He esti
mates that from 40,000 to 55,000 people
will come hero to attend ' the convention,
which meets on July 7 and lasts for six
days. ....
He says the interest in the convention is
growing greatly. Everybody seems to
want to come to California. The recent
intensely cold weather has intensified the
desire. Not only do many of the people
want to come and see the State, but some
of them are thinking of staying it" they can
find suitable locations within their means.
Especially do the people who have grown
old feel the need of spending their declin
ind days under softer and more genial
ties.
The Endeavorer newspaper has a plan
of its own to send from 3000 to 4COO vis
itors here. The round-trip rale fur
nished by the raiiroad from Chicago, St.
Louis and contiguous places is $51. From >
points east of that the rate is one fare for
the round trip.
Mr. Leubrie says this will put it within
the means of a vast number of people to
come here. They have been wanting to
come for a long time and now is their op
portunity.
Not only will the Endeavorers come, but
their friends and a great many others will
take advantage of the rates. He says that
as several months are given for the trip
they can start a month or two before the
convention and will have full opportunity
to investigate the various interests of the
State and see its various beauties. Mr.
Leubrie lived in California for some time
about thirty years ago, so he ii better in
formed than the casual visitor. He has
already been in the State about seven
weeks and has been at Los Angeles and
other places. He believes that the num

Illinois, lowa, Missouri and surrounding
DAVID LEUBRIE of the Chicago Christian Endeavorer, Who
Here in Connection With the Forthcoming Great Convention.
[Sketched from life by a "CaM" artitt.\
commonwealths will be three times as I
many as from the East, though the repre
sentation from there will in his judgment
be good.
"One of my objects in coming thus
early," said Mr. Leubrie, "is to try to in
duce as many of the Endeavorers as possi
ble to visit San Francisco, neighboring
cities and the charming health resorts at
least sixty days earlier than now antici
pated.
"The cheap rate of $51 for the round
trip from Chicago and similar Eastern
points will induce thousands of Christian
Endeavorers to attend this convention, in '
addition to the army of zealous citizens,
who have to a large extent signified their
intention of making this notable and
pleasurable journey.
"The fund of $25,000 subscribed by the
public-spirited citizens of San Francisco
and the further assurance that everything
will be dene to prov.de for the comfort
and pleasure of visiting members nas
aroused a spirit of commendable pride in
determining which State shall bring to
Baa Francisco the largest number of En
deavorers.
"It is not beyond the bounds of a con
servative estimate to figure up from 40,000
to 55,000 members as the sum total of
visitors, including, of course, the friends
and ardent supporters of those who are
identified with this praiseworthy move
ment. The Christian Endeavorer, reach

PRINTERS SPEAK FOR THE CALL.
The resolutions adopted by the Typographical Union at Its meeting January 22
have been published in tne Pacific Union Printer, the official journal of the union. The
resolutions In no uncertain terms condemn the resolutions passed by a so-called mass
meeting as being vituperative and an attempt to serve a master hand, and the union
protests against and condemns any such attempt to injure tbe San Francisco Call. In
conclusion a high compliment is paid to the proprietor of The Call. The resolutions
are as follows:
WHEREAS, At a meeting of the working men and women re
cently held in the Turk-street Temple to consider certain measures
pertaining to the interests of labor now pending before the Legisla
ture, resolutions were presented and adopted condemning the San
Francisco "Call" that savored more of temper and spite than deliber
ation; and whereas, said resolutions were so printed in conjunction
with a report ofthe State Labor Convention as to mislead the public
into believing that that body was a party thereto; and whereas, this
union deprecates any covert effort on the part of any body of work
ing men and women to injure the business of the employers of our
members for no other reason than because they are generous enough
to give space to those having wrongs to right or arguments pro and
con to present on measures of public importance; and whereas, said
mass-meeting of working men and women, led by one evidently hav
ing an object of his own or a mission to perform, has had the hardi
hood and effrontery to propose resolutions condemnatory to the San
Francisco "Call" as an enemy of labor; therefore be it
RESOLVED, That San Francisco Typographical Union No. 21
only sees vituperation and an attempt to serve a master hand in the
resolutions passed by said mass-meeting of working men and women,
and with which neither the State Labor Convention nor Labor Coun
cil had any connection; and
RESOLVED, That we earnestly and publicly protest against the
i spirit of said mass-meeting that suggested the placarding of San
Francisco with an appeal to injure the said San Francisco
"Call"; and
RESOLVED, That this union condemns any and all attempts to
boycott or otherwise injure any newspaper under the jurisdiction of
San Francisco Typographical Union for personal interests or political
advancement; and
RESOLVED, That we publicly proclaim, from the standpoint of
close business, relations, that the proprietor of the San Francisco
"Call" is not only just, and a large employer of our members, but is
all that could be desired as an employer.

"Aside from its vast moral and religious
influences the Christian Endeavorers will
exert a potent power in the uplifting of

I while they are tenacious of their noble or

their duties as citizens in promoting tbe
public welfare and their own business in

WILL FOUND A COLONY.
About 135 Families of Kussian Jews to
Locate on Lands in the Salinas
Valley.
M. Ephriam Deinard, editor of the Jew
ish paper, Nationalist Patriot and Zion, of
Kearny, N. J., i 8 in the City. He has
come West in the interest of a Jewish col
ony, and negotiations are in progress for
large tracts of land in the Salinas Valley.
About 125 families are expected from
New York and vicinity of Pnilaael
phia, most of them being from the latter
place. Several years ago Baron Hirsch in
terested himself in locating a large num
ber of families of Russian Jews in this
country, and the expense of bringing the
families to California will, it is stated, be
borne out of a fund yet reserved by the
Hirsch estate. The iamilies have been
about ten years in the United States.
It was the original desire to secure 160
acres of land for. each family and locate
the families on the same tract, but it is
now conceded that so much . desirable
land in a body will probably be hard to
obtain.
It is expected that many of the settlers
can homestead their lands, but where they
cannot do so they will be assisted in mak
ing purchases at as low a cost as possible.
Plans are also on loot looking to the assist
ance of the colonists in the way of farm
stock una implements. . Some of the col
onists are already in California.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1897.
NORTH HALL WAS
NEARLY AFLAME
A Streetcar Current Flashed
Over Telephone
Wires.
Spiro Sareentich, a. Student,
Saved One of the College
Buildings.
He Was Badly Burned in lhe Face
by the Pent-Up Elec
tricity.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Feb. 9. â What
! might have proved to be a serious disaster,
! resulting in the electrocuting of a Berke
ley student and the destruction of one of
the university buildings, took place at
about 1 o'clock to-day. But for tne pres
ence of mind and timely action of Spiro
Sargentich, a member of the junior class,
old North Hall might have been in ashes
to-night. As matters resulted, the hero
of the hour escaped, considerably fright
ened, with a deep burn on the cheek; a
quantity of books belonging to the stu
dents' co-operative store were scorched
and nearly all the telephones in the neigh
borhood were burned out.
A runaway team in the course of their
plunge through tbe streets ran against a
telephone pole on Allster way with their
heavy rock wagon and broke off the cross
bar which holds the insulators, letting
the telephone wire fall on the wires of
the electric street car line. Instantly
there occurred a flash and a hissing in the
main office and in the bouse of every
telephone owner on the line. In most
cases the utility of the phones was com
pletely destroyed, the current having
been so strong that the mechanical de
vices in them for preventing just such
accidents were of little use. Both the
telephones at the office of the regents and
the one at the co-operative store were
ruined.
It was during the wild excitement
which followed that Sargentich imperiled
himself. He was the only one in the
store at the time of the accident, and
hearing the hissing and crackling noise
made by the wires rushed to see what was
the trouble. Knowing that if something
was not done at once the building wouid
catch on fire, and that by 'loosing the
hook the circuit would be completed and
thus avert further dangerous troubie, be
reached for it. In so doing he was bit in
the face by a stream of electricity, besi les
receiving a heavy stroke of the bottled
lightning. For a time he was dazed, but,
! regaining his senses, he saw what a nar
row escape be bad had, and how he had
i saved the building from ruin.
Ralph Marshall, manager of the co-op
! erative store, stated to-night that if some
1 one had not been present when the acci
j dent to the telephone occurred, the build
i ing would have surely caught on fire.
! North Hall is a wooden structure, and is
jas dry as a tinder-box, so that if fire
I once gained bead vay there is no knowing
how it would result. At the time of the
trouble there were about 300 students in
I the building, who bad just entered to at
j tend their first recitation of the afternoon.

A GIFT FROM
THE HOMEOPATHS
Hahnemann College Ten
dered to University
Regents. -
Established Many Years and
Free From Debt It Wou'd
Be Annexed.
Regents Favorable and Will Arrange
Termsâ Other University Busi
ness Transacted.
The Hahnemann Hospital College of
San Francisco was yesterday, by its di
rectors and stockholders, offered to the
University of California for an affiliated
branch of the great State institution of
learning.
lt is tne chief exponent on this coast of
the homeopathic school; it has been in
continuous and regular operation as a
medical college for the last thirteen years;
it has graduated over a hundred physi
cians, ana it is entirely free from debt.
Had a vote been taken at once yester
day afternoon, when the proposition was
made to the Board of Regents then in
session in the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art, the Homeopathic Medical College
would have undoubtedly bten accepted
then and there as a valuable acquisition
o the university, for all the regents ap
peared pleased at the offer and favorable
to the prayer lor the affiliation. Pursu
ant, however, to the custom in such mat
ters a committee, consisting of Regents
Crocker, Hallidie and Wallace, was ap
pointed to examine Into the status of the
college, to decide upon the terms of affilia
tion and to report back to the board at its
next meeting.
Tbe proposition of affiliating a home
opathic college is in itself considered a
most significant move, as heretofore the
allopathic school has held full sway in
the State University and bas in conse
quence enjoyed an official recognition
that the homeopathic school has not bad.
Three of the largest Slate universities â
the University of Michigan, the Univer
sity of lowa and the University of Minne
sota â have already officially recognized
tbe importance of homeopathy and bave
a homeopathic department and an allo
paAiic department in their college of
medicine. At Boston University only
homeopathy is taught in the college of
medicine.
The offer was made to the Regents by
Dr. George H. Martin on behalf of the
college and of a number of very promi
nent wealthy citizens who are patrons of
homeopathy.
Aside Irom the usual routine forms
there was not a great deal of other busi
ness before the meeting.
The finance committee's recommenda
tion for the payment to Architects Krafft, i
Martens and Coffey of 2% per cent of the !
amount of the appropriation for the
affiliated colleges buildings was adopted
by a unanimous vote.
A. B. Saph was appointed assistant in
mechanical drawing at Berkeley for six
months at a salary of $75 a month.
A lithographic stone was ordered made,
from winch will be printed the new Latin
form of certificate to be issued to persons
j upon wbom the university shall confer
the degree of doctor of philosophy.
The committee on legislation reported
that all bills relative to and calculated to
benefit the university, now before the
Legislature, are likely to become laws.
Ex-Sheriff Robert McKillican of Ala
meda Ccunty was appointed superinten
dent of construction ior the affiliated col
leges buildings at a monthly salary of
$150.
The formal offer of the Hahnemann
Hospital College was made in the follow
ing manner:
. To the Honorable Board of Urgent?; of the, Uni
versity of Californiaâ Gkxtlemex: We, the
undersigned directors and stockholders of the
Hahnemann Hospital College of San Fran
cisco, having been appointed a special com
mittee by the board of directors of the said
institution to present to yopr honorable body
a petition praying for the affiliation of the
Hahnemann Hospital College of San Francisco
with the University of California, thereby
forming a homeopathic department of the
university, do hereby ask that such prayer
may be granted.
The Hahnemann Hospital College of San
Francisco was incorporated in 1881 and threw
open its doors to students in June, 1884, since
which time it has given a regular course of
lectures each year In all branches of medicine
and surgery. There have been graduated from
said Institution 125 students and there are at
present twenty-seven students in the various
classes.
The college has always demanded a high
standard ot education from its graduates. It
required three lull years ol study in the col
lege from its beginning, ond was, with the
medical department of the University of Cali
fornia, the first to demand a full four years'
course of study in the college as a compulsory
requirement for graduation. The college,
though not endowed, is wholly free from debt.
There are in the State of CaUfornia. in actual
practice to-day, about 2300 licensed physi
cians of all schools, of which number, by act
ual count, 40") are of the homeopathic school,
about one-tiitn of the whole number.
As the patrons of homeopathy are among
the well-to-do class of citizens and not so
much among the masses as the patrons of
other schools of practice it is undoubtedly a
fact that such patrons pay at least one-third of
the taxes of the State. -r 'â â -
Because we believe it to be for the best in
terests of the Hahnemann Hospital College of
San Francisco, for homeopathy on the Pacific
Coast, for the large number of citizens and
taxpayers of this State who do now or who
may in the future employ homeopathic phy
sicians that the said college should be under
the protection of the Stale University, and
also because w<- believe it to be for the best in
terests of the University of California, as a
great university, that there bo a homeopathic
department connected with it, we do therefore
pray that the Hahnemann Hospital College
of San Francisco miv become affiliated with
the University ot California.
Hoping that our prayer may be granted by
your hpnorable body we are, very respectfully,
J. A. Albertson, M.D., president of trie
board ot directors; A. C. Peterson, dean of
the faculty; C. B. Currier, M.D. ; George H.

James W. Ward. M.D.; C. L. Tisdale, M.D.;
George 11. Martin, M.D.
We take pleasure to append by permission

and taxpayers, who ere also patrons of home
opathy, and who are in full sympathy with
this petition : Louis Sloss. Horace Davis, Isaac

riage. In this regard he is disputed by
many witnesses, but he falls back on the
statement that he never intended to sign
any such document, and leaves the infer
ence that if he did so he was deceived as
to the character of the paper to which he
was appending his signature.
In the interesting testimony offered by
the old man, who is worth $750,000 and
objects to paying $500 a month alimony
to tbe lady who claims to be his wife by
contract, appears the following:
Mr. Pringle â During your illness in the
Washington-street house did you ever over
hear any conversation about yourself and
Mrs. Abbott and one of her sons?
Mr. Quackenbushâ Yes, sir.
â¢â¢State what it was aud how you came to
hear it."
"Well. I was lying on the lounge and they
thought I was asleep."
But the latter part of this statement
was ordered stricken out, because the wit
ness had no right to say what the lady and
her son thought, because quite naturally
he could not tell exactly what they
thought, so the lawyer took another tack:
Mr. Pringleâ Well, what did they say?
The witness â Well, the son said to the
mother, "What do you expect to mpke out of
this?" she replied, ""I expect to make enough
to keep me all my life."
"What son was that?"
"Willie."
Then followed a long discussion by the
attorneys as to admissibility of a conver
sation at which it -was alleged that Mrs.
Abbott-Quackenbush confessed that she
was not married to the defendant. At
length it was allowed and Attorney Foote
asked:
Will you please state what was said on or
about the 17th of May, 1893, by Mr. Pringle
or yourself or Mrs. Abbott in reference to a
marriage or a marriage contract?
1 was sitting in the room and these parties
were there and Mr. Pringle came in and
said to me: "Mr. Quackenbush, are you a
mtrried man?" and I says, "No, sir." He
turned arouud to Mrs. Abbott and he says:
"Mrs. Abbott, are you married to Mr. Quack
enbush?" She said. "No, sir." He repeated
it to her and she said: "No, sir"; that we were
not married.
George Jones and Eli Pullin testified
tbat they knew the plaintiff in this case as
Mrs. Abbott and never as Mrs. Quacken
bush. :-.;â¢
Further testimony will be taken at 10
o'clock this morning, and as usual there
will be a big attendance ot old men and
women who seem to feel a personal in
terest in this marital litigation wherein
the lady admits that she i* 55 years of age
and the alleged bridegroom is said to be
"rising 76."
VALLEY ROAD CONTRACTS
Grading for Thirty Miles South
of Fresno Will Begin
Immediately.
â¢ _
Track Will Be at Hanford in June
and Bakersfield Some Time
in the Fa 1.
The first jump in the long extension of
the Valley railroad from Fresno to Bakers
field was taken yesterday afternoon by
the directors of the progressive competi
tor of the Southern Pacific, the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad
Company. A large gang of men will be
put to work in three or four days making
grade to the well-established and enter
prising town of Hanford, and as rapidly
as the leveled earth will permit crotsties
and rails will follow it up. This is what
the board of directors autboriz-d at a
meeting yesterday and as was outlined in
yesterday's Call. The total expenditure
will be about $200,000.
The contract for thirty miles of grade
was ordered let by the board to Grant
Bros, of Alameda County, who have an
office in this City. The price was so much
per cubic yard, and will amount to between
$30.000. and $40,000. in Jetting the con
tract to Grant Bros, the directors have a
precedent for tbe kind 01 grading they
may expect. The firm did most of the
grading for the road from StocKton to
Fresno. The distance Irom Fresno to
Hanford is about thirty miles. For a
number of reasons the line will not be
completed as soon as bas been expected
down the valley into either Hantord or
Bakersfield. Chief Engineer Storey will
make a trip down to Fresno soon. He
said yesterday that they hoped to have
trains running into Hanford early in June,
and into Bakersfield when, as James Whit
comb Riley says, "the frost Is on the pump
kin and the fodder 'a in the suock Oc
tober or November.
The rails will be the latest steel pattern,
62Â»Â£ pounds to the yard, which is consid
ered a heavy rail. Considerable mileage
of the Southern Pacitie is said to be laid
with a GO- pound rail.
No time limit will be put into the con
tract. Chief Engineer Storey said they
have an understanding with the contrac
tors that the work will be proceeded with
as rapidly as the railroad company desires.
There will be no grade on the extension
heavier than fifteen feet to the mile. Be
tween Hanford and Fresno are a number
of streams. The largest bridge will be
across Kings River.
This bridge will consist of two spans of
100 feet each, with several feet of ap
proaches of trestle and embankment. The
bridge will be of wood and iron and the
spans will be what is known as the Howe
truss. The bridge will cost about $15,000.
The contract for it will be let soon.
The removal from Stockton to Fresno of
Division Superintendent A. D. McFarland
next Monday to superintend the exten
sion work creates a vacancy in the Stock
ton division. . The directors yesterday
approved the appointment of Assistant
Engineer A. D. Scbindler as division su
perintendent and engineer. Mr. Schindler
was promoted from the chief engineer's
office. He has gone to Stockton.
. President Clans Spreckels is in the East.

SCHOOL BOARD
HAS MANY PLANS
! Radical Change in the
Control of Evening
Schools.
Some Teachers to Go and Some
New Positions to Be
Provided.
If the Plan Carries There Will Be
Four Teachers of Physical
Cv ture Very Soon.
The Board of Education will have a
lively time to-night. The programme is
much larger than usual. It embraces the
dropping of several teachers, the plan of
turning over the control of the evening
schools from the Committee on Classifica
tion to the Committee on Evening Schools,
the reception and consideration of Aud
itor Broderick's "kick" concerning the
architect's fees, premiums and soon for
the Mission High School, the revision of
former action concerning the school jani
tors, with, perhaps, a few other bits of
work thrown in. The board will come to
gether at 8 o'clock and will probably sit
late. s [j~A^
The â¢ teachers of cooking, if a secret
agreement among the members is carried
out, will he dropped from their present
positions. These are Miss Wbittaker,
Miss Toomy and Miss Paxton. Their
places will be declared vacant. Miss Patton
will resume ncr place on the unaligned
I list. The other teachers will be out. Mr.
Stockman and Mr. Eldridge, both of whom
are connected with the manual training
of the children, are slated to go. There
was some talk of removing Professor
Barth, teacher of physical .culture, but
the athletic associations of the City ral
lied so to his support that he will stay.
The original proposition was to lav him
off until July, until more money comes
in. But this will not be carried out. In
July three more teachers of physical cul
ture will be added to the department,
making four in all, if the programme is
not changed.
Miss Treadwell, who was given permis
sion oy the old board to teach the voice
and physical culture during school hours
is also on the list to go. The Committee
on ttules has resolved upon this. Miss
bouie, who asked for one month leave of
absence, will probably be denied. She is
on the unassiened list. So also will Dr
Bonnell, assistant police surgeon, be re
fused leave of absence. He was a night
school teacher. His move was to hold
open a door by which be could step back
into the department. At the meeting of
tne board as a committee of the whole it
was resolved not to permit this.
Among the minor propositions which
the members are talking over is a pro
posed assessment upon the pupil* of the
Dudley Stone school of 10 cents per capita
to buy a piano. This does not meet with
the sanction of the majority, - the idea
being that no assessments should be per
mitted for any purnose.
â  The idea in transferring the control of
the evening schools from the Classification
Committee to the Committee on Even ne
Schools is to give the last named comSH j
tee as much jurisdiction over the evening
schools as the Classification Committee
has over the day schools, which will be
controlled as heretofore.
Since the board changed the janitors,
around there has been a eeneral rallying*
to the support of the janitors who were to
be displaced. As a consequence janitors
wno were to be moved out still hold on.
The programme may be modified some
what. The seerecatlon ofj funds sug
gested by the Finance Committee is likely
to carry with the exception of an addi
tional $1000 to the Buildings and Grounds
Committee.
Auditor Broderick went home early yes
terday to prepare his communication to the
board, with which he will return without
approval the bill ol Architect Havens be
cause the contracts f|>r the Mission High
School exceed the estimates. The discus
sion on all these matters and others inci
dentally arising will fill np the evening.

lence of plague aDd consequent destitu
