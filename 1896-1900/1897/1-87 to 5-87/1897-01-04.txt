SUNDAY SCENE IN THE LOBBY OF THE GOLDEN EAGLE HOTEL, SACRAMENTO.
Groups of Well-Known Legislators and Their Friends Rallied in Full Force in the Lobbies of the Popular Caravansary at the State Capital
Yesterday Afternoon, and Discussed Matters of Importance to Be Considered by the Legislature of California, Particularly the Election of a
United States Senator to Succeed Hon. George C Perkins. To-Day the Session Begins, but Little Will Be Done Beyond Temporary
Organization. Many Off ce-Seekers Are in a Fair Way to Be Disappointed.
but little doubt that the Senate will take
into its own hands the appointment of
committees; not that there is any
thought of disrespect toward the Lieu
tenant-Govern or, but because tha Re
publican Senators do not think he would
give them as cood committees as they
could pick out for themselves.
Tho question of organization will also
come before the caucus, and it will be de
termined whether theorganization will be
completed to-morrow or whether it will
be deferred until the next day, in which
event the election of n United States Sen
ator would be put off for another week.
In a conversation with Senator Lan?
ford to-night, he informed a Call corre
spondent that be had in preparation a bill
making a claim against the State for
UO.OOO or $12,000 on behalf of Agricultural
D strict No. 2, which is in San Joaquin
County. The Senator snid that the forty
eight agricultural districts in the Stale
had been taken at a serious disadvantage
when Governor Buad vetoed the bill ap
pronriating about $190,000 for the agricul
tural districts. The directors had gone on
before the veto was put on the bill and
had contracted certain obligations for the
payment of premiums and other things
necessary for the operation of district
fairs. This left them in debt when the
appropriation bill was vetoed and they
had no means of raising tne necessary
funds to wipe out the obligations. Agri
cultural Association No. 2, which the Sen

â  ator represents, borrowed from and
j through its members money with which
I to pay the most pressing of these obliga-
I tions, about $3000. There are yet many
I premiums to be paid, not to speak of other
legitimate claims of the value of about
$10 000 or $12,000. The Senator said also,
that other districts would come in with
similar claims, but tnat the total, includ
ing that of No. 2, would not exceed
$06,000.
Representatives here from the reining
districts are preparing a bill, in accord
ance with the recommendation of the
State Miners' Convention held in San
Francisco recently, asking Congrass to
give the mining industry a representation
in the Cabinet. They claim that if the
miners are properly protected the output
of metals of all kinds from California
would amount to $100,000,000 per annum.
On behalf of the newspapers of Califor
nia there will be presented to the Legisla
ture a bill making a very radical chance in
the law of libel. Under the present law a
newspaper cannot publish the arrest of a
person without being guilty of a criminal
libel and amenable to damages in a civil
action. Scipio Craig of the Redlands C.t
rograph is here in the interest of the pro
posed amendment.

Man's View
Of Marriage.
"IS MARRIAGE A
FAILURE?"
It is not uncommon for men to bewail the
fact that marriage so seldom means a. real
companionship â that man and wife are
separated by difference of taste, of mental
outlook, of general interest in life. It i 3
perhaps even more common to hear women
blamed for what is called breach of contract
in the marriage relation. If the wife be
delicate, run-down, nervous and irritable,
if her smile and her spirits have taken
flight, it worries her husband as well as
herself. Even worse symptoms may fol-
low â the woman suffers from sleeplessness
and fainting spells, fcer head is in a whirl,
her back aches, and she has that awful
crowding-down feeling in the abdomen. It
depends on the woman whether she will
permit these troubles to continue day by
day leading to a life of misery.
Thousands have been cured by taking Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription, and why not
you? A healthy woman is always interest-
ing ; she passes for a beauty because she is
happy, and her good spirits are contagious.
Good nature goes with health ; irritability
and peevishness with sickness.
Those who suffer from the derangements,
disorders and diseases of the sex should re-
member that Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief consult-
ing physician to the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N. V., has, for
over a quarter of a century, made the dis-
eases of women a specialty. Send 10 cents
(in stamps) to him, at above address, for
'his medical book on "Women and Her
Diseases," (168 pages profusely illustrated
with wood cuts and colored plates). It will
be mailed to you seat rely sealed in a plain
envelope. It contains photographs, names
and addresses of a vast number who have
been cured. You can correspond with
them and learn how they cured themselves
without having to consult a doctor.2

newspaper publisher was quoted by Ed
itor Craig, and was also the text at the
recent meeting of the California Editorial
Association. The story in brief is that a
servant woman employed by a prominent
merchant of Sacramento called at the office
of the Chief of Police and complained of
her employer, accusing him of a serious
crime against her. Upon the woman's
statement and affidavit the man was ar
rested. A reporter of the Sacramento Bee
wrote the woman's story as she had given
it to the Chief of Police, and in the same
issue of the paper published a denial of
the accused. On a preliminary examina
tion the man was held to answer, but on
the trial in the Superior Court he was
acquitted on tne grouiui of insufficiency of
evidence.
The merchant began a libel suit for $50.
--000 damages, and the case being tried
before a Judge and without a jury, the
McClatcheys were adjudged to have vio
lated the law against libel and were
ordered to pay the merchant $500. The
prosecution conceded that the publication
had been without malice, but the court
held substantially that as the merchant
had not been found guilty of the charge
brought sigainst him by the woman, the
publication of the item had injured him
and that he shoul-i be entitled to receive
damages. The point of the case was the
fact that the statement of the woman to
the Chief of Police was Dot a priv.leged
communication or such matter as would
be allowed by law, not being made un^er
oath and in a court proceedine. The Su
preme Court sustained the decision of the
Sacramento Judge and h U that it was
the law. Under the decision a woman
who had been wronged would be debarred
from exposing the wrongdoer if the police
magistrate should refuse to is-ue n war- i
rant for him, for it would be unlawful for
a newspaper to publish her statement and
the whim of a Judge could prevent her
making one that could be published.
Mr. Craig lamented fhe fact that the
conduct of such papers as the Examiner
had made it necessary that a Judge
should interpret the law so strictly as
against the defendants, but, he added, :io
matter how strict the laws might be made
ana no matter how severe the punishment
might be such unscrupulous journals as
the one he named would manage to evade
it and escape punishment.
Thomas V. Cator was among the arri
vals to-night. He says that he will re
man for two or three days. Dan T. Coie
came also.
HOLD-OVER REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
NOT TIED BY PLEDGES.
Members of the Legislature Will
Act for the Best Interests In
Selecting: a Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 3.â The
Democratic Examiner, the Sacramento
Record-Union, tail-cud organ of the rail
road kite, tosether with all the place
hunters and chronic loafers around the
i Legislature are telling respectable Repub
j licans that it is treason to mention for the
senatorship any aspirant other than
j George C. Perkins. It goes without say
ing that every place-seeker has a promise
of a place from Perkins.
The vaporines of the Examiner in
Perkins' support has disgusted many
decent Republicans who entertain ideas of
their own in regard to the fitness of canrti
j dates for United States Senator. Now the
! spectacle of the out-and-out orean of the
i railroad c rporation proclaiming in col
j umns of double-leaded type that Per Kins
j can only be defeated by treason, corrup
tion and party dishonor, deepens the
disgust of sensible hizb-minded repre
sentatives of the Republican party.
There are some things in politics, even
California politics, that are altogether too
raw for Republicans. \Vhen it is ob
served that ihe San Francisco Democratic
organ and the Sacramento rosette of jour
nali-m are pulling together inPerkins' tight
honest Republicans who do not set their
political instructions from the Democratic
party or the railroad camp are inclined to
resent the advice as indolent and intrusive.
It is already the talk of the sanguine
supporters of Perkins that if sixty-one
votes cannot be secured in the Republican
rar;y to elect him to the Senate the
Democrais following the advice of the
Examiner will get into the tight and give
him enough votes to pull through.
The Republican members of the pre ent
Legislature are not Jied up and fast bound I
by Senatorial pledges. Instructions given 1
to them by their constituents contemplate
that they shall use ther judgment and
select the best Republican lor the Senate.
They have not been toid to consult the
Examiner and Record-Union and get in
structions from those quarters. They are
free to act as their intellieencÂ« and con
science dctate. In view of developments
at Washington recently and the subse
quent attitude of subsidized railroad or
gans in Calitornia many Republicans who j
do their own thinking are gravely consid
ering whether ihe interests of the party
would not be conserved by holding aloof |
from the caucus. It is sure that they will Â»

A PRETTY CONTEST.
Candidates for the Office of Ser

Lined Up for Battle.
SACRAMENTO, Cal, Jan. 3.â There is
a pretty contest on for sergeant-at-arms of
the Assembly. By common consent the
position was conceded to San Francisco,
but the delegation from the City could
not agree as between Banks, Wilkinson
and Parkinson. Now J. H. Tibbetts of
Amador, an ex-Assemblyman who recent
ly returned from South Africa, is in the

DESiRVLS THE HONOR.
Colonel Kuwrtisky Tells Why He
Supports Samuel M. Short
ridge for Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 3.â ln an in
terview this evening Colonel H. I. Kowal
sky thus defined bis position :
"The reason I am for Samuel M. Short
ridee lor United States Senator is because
I see an opportunity of uniting the Re
publican party. Everybody knows the
bitter contest waged in San Francisco be
tween the factions and the position I took.
Mr. Shortridge, while on the other side,
occupied an honorable and dignified posi
tion, working at all times to produce har
mony, and if that result was not obtained
it was not because his efforts were not
earnest and untiring.
"For fifteen years I have labored side by
side with Mr. Shortridge, in season and
out of season, for the success of the Re
publican party, and I know of no man
more worthy of being honored by his
party at vhis time. My friends with
whom I have co-operated in the past join
me in the opinion that Mr. Shortridge
possesses all the elements that can bring
us together and solidify the party, so that
hereafter we can present a solid front,
and it is to the interest of the party
throughout the State to have the Repub
licans of San Francisco united.
"Mr. Shortridge is in the very prime of
life, gifted and learned, and would return
to California the honor conferred by his
election to the place of United Suites Sen
ator. It is time that the Republican party
honored one of its young men, and par
ticularly one who has labored so unself
ishly as Mr. Shortridge has, and I feel sat
isfied tnat his selection at this time will be
the means of brineing proper Federal re
cognition to California and to the earnest
workers of the party who are honestly
entitled to consideration.
"I may say in conclusion that as a law
yer Mr. Shortridge stands in the ad
vance line of his profession, and as an
orator he has few if any equals on this
coast. Born and reared a Republican, he
has given his time, energies and great
talent> to advance the cause of his party.
Every man in California knows of his long
and faithful service. Although I have
fougnt him politically 1 have been and
am now His personal friend. For this
reason and for the others stated I have
gone into this tight wishing to do honor
where honor is deserved."
SEEKERS OF POSITIONS.
Many Will, No Doubt, Be Dlsap-
pointed, for There Is a Promise
of Economy.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 3â The ap
plicants for clerical and other positions â
and their number is legion â are very much
alarmed because of the action of the
Assembly caucus yesterday at which it
was decided to make an effort to conserve
the interests of economy by reducing the
number of attaches from 150 to 100. The
country members were particularly in
sistent on this point, their constituents
bav.ng had two or three bad years, and
they have demanded that th 9 strictest
economy shall be exercised in the manage
ment of the State's affairs.
The gentlemen who will endeavor to
inaugurate this refoim are just beginning
to realize what a difficult task they have
befere them. Places are few, and place
hunters are many, and most of the appli
cants have so large a number of influen
tial friends that the new member will be
staggered when he is confronted with the
average pull of the average office-seeker.
He will realize the fact that the appli
cants have been very busy for the last few
weeks, day ana night, in massing their
forces and concentrating their strength.
The new member who intends to keep his
pledges and to save to the State every
dollar ot expense that he can, will find it
very hard to resist the pleadings of inti
mate friends and persons who favored him
in a business way, and he is lost in won
der at the strong hold that the applicant
has gained on those friends. Then when
he finds that bis neighbor in the Senate
or Assembly is disposed to be a little lib
eral with the funds of the State in order
to maintain his popularity among the
workers as a good fellow the temptation
in many cases becomes too strong to be re
sisted.
He will find what more experienced
men than he have found beforeâ that a
political pull, when it is genuine, is the
strongest kind ot a pull. The tug-of-war
is nothing but the play of an iniant in
comparison with it. So the friends of the
applicants are bidding them to be of good
cheer and to wait patiently the turn ol
events.
Many of the old familiar faces are soen
in the old familiar places. There is Mrs.
Harris of Sacramento, whom everybody
knows, again at her post, the entrance :o
the Golden Eagls Hotel, for an hour or
two, and the ladies' parlor, lying in wait
for Senators and Assemblymen, asking
them to help her to get lhe appointment
as custodian of the ladies' cloakroom in
the halls of legislation. She had the job
before and was enabled to better care for
her invalid husband. She is a persistent
worker and knows neither rest nor re
fusal.
Long John Wilkins makes the sidewalk
in front of the hotel look like old times,
bis tall form rising above the crowd like
an ebony monument. He is after any
thing that may come bandy to keep the
wolf from the door while the Legislature
is in session.
T. H. McCarthy is here in the interest
of the teacbers' pension bill, and although
it is almost too early to talk about bills
until after the election of a United States
Senator he is on deck day and night, doing
like the rest of themâ talking, talking.
Wherever a body of politicians are gath
ered together there you will find one of
Mose Gunst's biggest 4">-caliber cigars
with Jake Steppacher behind it. Jake is
and has been the secretary of the Repub
lican State Central Committee for many
years, and no man in the State is better
acquainted with the routine of Republi
can politics than he. Of him Major Mc-
Laugblin, who knows something himself,
said that he was a valuable mine of politi
cal information. Jake is noted for his
reticence. Nobody except the person offi
cially entitled thereto can get any infor
mation out of him. He is a mystery of
the lobbies, and even his c.^ar does not
know how strong a pull he has on it. Jake
is in evidence day and night, but he is not
saying anything. W. B. Hamilton, Sena
tor Perkins' political manager, is on the
ground looking out lor the interests of his
friend. Â«
There is the usual number of ladies lob
bying for clerkships and other positions
in both houses. The feeling against the
employment of women in politics is grad
ually wearing away. They make good
clerks, don't get drunk and run cut all
night with the rest of the boys, and every
year they are making serious inroads in
the ranks of the "push," who regard the
pretty women as interlopers into an
ancient and honorable order. The fact
that women hwe no vote has always been
the greatest snac in their way to political
employment, but they are holding their
own very well indeed against the men in
securing positions by persistent lobbying
for the same. Some of these have invalid
mothers to support, and it is after all a
very good sign that politics does not
always stifle the finer feelings of human
nature.
A wagon-load of boys are seeking ap
pointment as pages, and it is believed that
most of them are the brightest and most
gentlemanly lads that the State can pro
duce. In a modest and altogether unob
trusive wsy they approach the members
and present their cards with the request
respectfully made that their claims should
not be forgotten in the distribution of the
patronage. Some day those little fel
lows, or at all events the greater number
of them, will be occupying seats in the
State Capitol and growling at the slow
ness and inattention of "those confound
edly lazy boys." They will be Senators
and Assemblymen, and will, no doubt,
improve on the methods of their t>rede
cessors.
ECONOMY THE ORDER.
Speaker Coombs Talks About the
Probable Organization of the
Assembly.
BACRASaENTO, Cal., Jan. 3.âOrgani
zation of the Assembly may be effected
to-morrow, yet obstacles unforeseen may
delay the completion of this work until
Tuesday. Speaker Coombs, as he is al
ready designated, because no one has en
tered the list to deprive him of the honors
and prerogatives of the Speakership, has
been a busy man to-day.. In an interview
this evening he remarked:
''I have not taken "up the subject of
standing committees ana will pr >bably
not settle down to that task until the
Assembly is organized. My time to-day
has been devoted to a long conference
with the committee appointed to con
sider the matter of patronage. It i 3 our
purpose to retrench all along the line and
make a reduction in the number of at
taches of one-third as compared with the
number engaged by the Assembly at the
session two years aj;o. One hundred and
fifty-two attaches were on the payroll two
years ago. The force was exce sive and
added largely to the contingent expenses
of the Legislature. We .recognize that
there is a public demand for retrench
ment and we propose to respond to it, or
at least make an honest effort to get into
line with the taxpayers of the Sta.e. I
have talked with very many Assembly
men to-day, and I find a positive and
almost unanimous sentiment in favor of
Keeping the numb.-r of attaches within a
limit oi 100.
"When the matter of jatronage is set
tled I will take up the subject of appoint
ing the standing committees of the As
sembly. I shall get a room somewhere In
tbe Capitol and receive suggestions from
all the members. I see no reason why the
A seiubly should not organize to-morrow.
The appointment of the standing commit
tees is not at all necessary for the organi
zation of the House."
The fight is raging all around tbe hotel
for clerkships and minor positions of every
grade from page to rear porter. The As
sembly caucus to-morrow morning may
deprive many of the applicants of hope.
The Governor is ready to tire in his bi
ennial message as soon as he is notified
that the two hou-es are ready to hear
from him. The message is said to be a
great retrenchment papar, in which at
tention is culled to the extravagance of
public institutions in this State.
One of the rirst acts oi the Legislature
will be tbe adoption ot a joint resolution
or memorial to Congress asking that a
duty of 80 cents a box be placed on oranges
in the tariff measure now being lrarned at
Washington. Senator Androus of Los
Angeles will introduce the subject in the
Senate and the Los Angeles delegation in
the Assembly will act simultaneously. It
ia proposed to wire the resolution to
Washington.
FRENCH RADICALS DEFEATED.
Fail in Their Attempts to Oust the Mod
erate Republicans Wherever a Con
test /s Made.
PARIS, France, Jan. 3.â The elections
which were held to-day in various parts of
France to fill the seats of one-third of the
members of the osnate resulted in the de
feat of the Radicals, who failed in their
attempts to oust the Moderate Republican
candidates wherever the latter contested
the di-tricts. Even Seine-e:-Marne, the
boureeoisie's own department, and the
Department dv Nord re-elected the retir
ing Moderate Ra publican candidates.
Up to midnight returns had been re
ceived from ninety-seven districts, show
ing the election of 53 Moderate Republi
cans, 18 Radicals and 11 Conservatives.
The Republicans gain 13 seats.
In the department of the Haute Gar
onne M. Victor CaniDaran, Republican,
was the only Senator re-elected. This de
partment returns four members of the
upper house. MM. Ournac and Valentine
Abeille, the latter a Radical Republican,
viio represents a district of Haute
Garonne in ibe Chamber of Deputies, were
elected, leaving the fourth seat to be con
tested on a reballot by Count Paul de
Remusat, M. Adrian Hebrard and ex-
Minister Constant, the retiring Senators.
Iv the department of Gironde. which
returns five Senators, ex-Minister Tra
rieux, Republican, retains his seat. E.t-
Minister David Raynal, Republican, who
represents Bordeaux in the Chamber of
Deputies, was elected Senator in one of
the Gironde districts.
M. Antonin Duboise was returned as a
Senator for the department of Isere, for a
district of which he now sits in the Cham
ber of D puties.
General Paul Grevy, Republican, who
has filled for many years one of the three
seats for the department of Jura, is likely
to lose his seat.
Dr. Victor Lourties, Republican, who
has represented a district of. the depart
ment of Landes since 1838, was Minister
of Commerce in the Dupuy Cabinet of 1894
and Secretary of the Senate for several
years, has been re-elected.
Among the more prominent Spnators
who have been re-elected are: M. Wal
deck-Rousseau, who was 'Minister of the
Interior in the cabinets of Gambetta and
Ferry; M. Louis Cochery, who has held
several ministerial positions, including
that of Minister of Posts and Telegraphs
in the Cabinet of M. Waddington; M.
Fallier^s, Minister of the Interior In 1882
in the Cabinet of M. Duclerc; M. Ernest
Boulanger, a Minister of the Colonies in
the Cabinet of M. Casimir-Perier, and M.
Louis de Velle, also an ex-Minister.
They represent districts in the depart
ments of the Loire, Loirette, Haute
Garonne and Manse.
The Senate is composed of 300 mem bers,
of whom one-fourth were originally elected
by the National Assembly for Jiie, VBcan
c.es in this rank being filled by tbe Senate
itself. Since 1884, however, no new life
Senators have been elected, the distinc
tion being abolished for ult except the sur
vivors of the previous election.
Subject to the gradual absorption of the
remaining life Senatorships, the entire
body of the second chamber is renewed
by thirds every three years, so that the
Senatorial mandate extends for nine years
in each case. The qualification for Sena
tors is that they shail be of French nation
ality, net under 40 years of age an d in full
enjoyment of their civil >\nd political
rights; but members of families who have
furnished occupants of the throne and
generals or admirals on active service are
disquali fied. The salary of a Senator is
15.000 francs a year.
Senatorial electors, in the several con
stituent departments are of three cate
gories: First, communal and municipal
delegates, elected by a majority of each
commune or municipality, one or more
delegates for every local representative
body, according to population; second,
all the members of each council generul
and district council; third, the deputies
in each department.
Two months after the election of dele
gates the whole electoral college proceeds
to nominate one-third of the total number
of Senators voted to the department.
A later dispatch states thatCounide
Remusat. Moderate Repoblicim, deleated
M. Consta; a in Haute Garonne on the
third ballot. The vote stood 514 to 437,
eiving Count de Remusat a majority of 77.
The Moderate Republicans claim that the
defeat of M. Constans, who is a Repub
lican, is a great victory for them.

Peculiar Charge of the
Judge Causes Some
Complications.
Jurors Misunderstood the Mean

the Court.
Thinkin? They Were Compiled to

BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 3.â H. J. Booth, a
member of the jury which on Saturday
found Thoaias B. Bram guilty of the Her
bert Fuller murders, to-nignt told The
Call correspondent that at least four
members of the jury did not believe that
the man's guilt was proved, but voted for
the verdict because they believed they
had to.
The jury went out at 1:05 o'clock Fnaay
afternoon, and Saturday morning aske I
the court for instruction?, on just what
point the lawyers in tbe case do not know,
but evidently as to the proper course to
iollow to avoid deadlocking. To this
Judge Colt said in part:
*'In order to firing twelve minds to s
unanimous result you must examine the
questions with regard and deference to
the opinions of each other. It is your
duty to decide the case. In conferring to
gether yoa ought to be convinced by each
other's argument, and if the larger num
ber of your panel are for a conviction, a
dissenting juror should consider whether
a doubt in his mind is a reasonable one,
which makes no impression upon the
minds of so many men equally honest,
equally intelligent with himself."
Mr. Cotter, Brain's counsel, excepted to
this ruling.
"This ruling," Mr. Booth says, "made
the jury bring in a verdict. At least four
members oi the jury will make affidavit
that they do not think Bram guilty, that
they did not believe him guilty, but we
interpreted Judge Coil's ruling as an or
der to bring in a verdict agreeable to the
majority; taking that aa such we agreed
on a verdict that our conscience said was
wrong; I did not know my rights in the
case and if Bram is hung I shaii ever con
sider myself responsible in part lor his
murder, for murder it will be."
This statement possibly insures Bram â¢
new trial. His counsel is jubilant. At
the jail to-night Bram said: "I am inno
cent and shall be free; when I die it will
be as God intends."
NASHVILLE'S DESTRUCTIVE FIRE.
It Was Far More Disastrous Than the
First Dispatches to the Press
Indicated.
NASHVILLE, Tj-.wv., Jan. 3.â The de
structive fire w: ich visited this city iast
night at 11:15 was not well under control
before 3\. M. The fire was by Tar more
disastrous in its results than indicated in
last night's dispatches. A series of unfor
tunate conditions handicapped the de
partment in its work, and a very strong
wind playing from the south made mat
ters much worse.
The falling of a rear wall of the Burns
building caused damage to tbe extent of
$50,000 by crushing through adjacent
buildings. A feature of the fire was the
fighting from roofs, as few alleys traversed
the district. When sufficient pressure of
water was finally secured the department
rendered very effective service, though at
first they seemed almost helpless.
Total estimate of damages is $600,000, of
which slightly more than 50 per cent is
covered by insurance.
Several accidents of trifling consequence
were reported. The origin of the fire is
still a mystery. The principal losses are
now estimated as follows: LÂ« Beck Bros.,
stock, $150,000, insurance $60,000; Aber
nathy, Laimham & Shook, loss $23,000, lnÂ»
snrance $15,000; Burns & Co., loss $50,000,
insurance $30,000; Lickhardt & Co., loss
$25,000, fully covered by insurance; Tracey
& Co. , $15,000, insurance $8000; Brandon
Shoe Company $8000, insurance $5500.

THE COMMODORE
Every Indication That the
Vessel Was Scuttled
and Sunk.
It Is N w Known That Ten
Americans and Six
Cubans Perished.
Peri's of the Survivors, Who Fought
lor M^ny Hours Against
a Terrible Sea.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. S.â All of
the crew of the Commodore were not
saved, as reported last night. Twelve are
in Jacksonville, three alive and one dead
at Daytona Four are reported to have
arrived near Armond, but the reDort is
not confirmed, and eight are at sea on a
life-raft.
Captain Murphy ; Stephen Crane, the
novelist; C. B. Montgomery, the cook,
and William Higgins, a stoker, landed at
Daytona this morning. Tiieir boat was
turned over in the surf, and Higgins re
reived a wound which caused his death
soon after getting sshore.
The party on the raft are all Cubans.
They left the boat before Captain Murphy's
party and nothing more lias been heard
of them. J. H. Barrs requested the Col
lector of Customs to secure permission for
tue Three Friends to go to the rescue of
the Commodore immediately upon the
receipt of the news of the wreck Saturday
afternoon. The Collector telegraphed to
Secretary Carlisle at once, but no reply
was received until this afternoon, when
Permission was granted, and the Three
Friends left to-night. The beaca is being
patrolled from St. Augustine to New
Smyrna.
It is reported there was treachery abcard
the Commodore, but no details can be
learned.
The party landed at Daytona cannot get
to this city to-morrow, as there are no
Sunday trains on the East Coast Railroad.
The party that landed last night and
reached here are : Major Ricardo A. Del
gado, Paquite Rencamo. Franco Blanco,
MiÃuel Coldisburry, Ramon Hernandez.
Gabriel Martinez, Santiago Diaz, Emilio
Maiqaez, Jose Hernandez and Buene
ventuo Tivovus.
The following was received fram Day
tona at 11 o'clock to-night:
About 10 o'clock Friday night a suspicious
leak ufis discovered in the rireroom ana Cap
tain Murphy immediately started the pumps,
\\ huh undoubtedly had been tampered with,
as they were in working order when Captain
Murphy and Chief Engineer ReJigan left
watch at 8 o'clock. The tirea were extin
guished and the boat came to a standstill
about thirteen miles from Mosquito light.
Captain Murphy took full charge of the hand
ling of the ship, while the first mate superin
tended tne launching of tlie boats. Trie Cu
bans took possession of the big boat and loaded
it with baggage, so that only twelve men leit
the tug in it. Tney reached the shore at i
o'clock Saturday and left for Jacksonville.
The second boat was occupied by six Cu
bans, and the empty boat washed ashore at
Port Orange last night. The third boat to
leave the craft's side was rilled with Ameri
cans, leaving a ten-foot dingey lor the^use ot
Captain Murphy, who refused to quit the ship
until al! were saved. C. B. Montgomery, the
steward, Stephen Crane and William Higgins
remained witn the captain, and with him
launched the dingey and stood by the tug until
7 o'clock, when she sanK. Trie mate's boat,
containing nine Americans, was smashed, und
the mate, two engineers, six firemen and sail
ors were lashed to a raft, which Captaiu Mur
phy aUempted to tow ashore two miles away,
but the terrible sea and the northeast eale
swept them away.
The dingey occupied by the captain and com
panions was twenty-Beven hours at sea, Mont
gomery and Crane holding Captain Murphy'i
overcoat as a sail until the beach was sighted.
High seas were breaking a Half miie from
shore. Montgomery, Crane and Murphy were
washed to the beach, where citizens provided
them with medical attendance. Higgius was
killed at the overturning of the boat, which
made ten Americans and six Cubans lost.
There is no doubt that a traitor did the work
of scuttling and then tampered with the
pumps, as they were working perfectly at 8
o'clock. The suspected man was saved and
a thorough investigation will be made to
morrow.

REBELS FOUGHT WITH FIRE.
Sanguinary Conflct in the Philippines in
Which Thirteen Hundred Insur-
gents Are Killed.
MADRID, Spain, Jan. 3.â Queen Regent
Christina ami the Government have sent
messages to General Poiievieja, Captain-
General of the Philippine Islands, con
gratulating him upon his great victory
over the insurgents on the heights of
Cacarron, province of Bulacan.
In the first engagement the loss of the
rebels was 6CO killed. The troops cap
tured a large quantity of munitions of
war and a factory in which the rebels had
been making cartridges.
While the Spaniards were pursuing the
fleeing rebels it was suspected that the
latter, pursuing the method of warfare
followed by the Cuban insurgents, would
attempt to lead the troops into an am
buscade in the dense thickets through
which the pursuit led. The troops were,
therefore, ordered to set lire to the bushes
in many places in order to drive out any
rebels who mieht be lurking in them.
The flames spread with great rapidity and
it was soon learned that the suspicion of
an ambuscade was well founded. A large
number of the insurgents were in hiding
in the bushes, evidently waiting for tne
troops to pass, when they would have at
tacked them at the rear. Many of the
rebels succeeded in making their escape
for the time being, but 200 of them per
ished in the tire.
In the meantime other Spanish columns
had been hurriedly dispatched to out
flank the fleeing insurgents, anU in this
they were successful. The rebels were
utterly routed, losing 500 killed. The
total insurgent loss was 130), 200 in ex
cess of the number giver, in yesterday's
dispatches. These 200 were without
doubt those who were burned to death.
The Spanish loss was one officer and
twenty-three privates killed.
The victory, which it is believed will be
proved a crushing blow to the insurgents,
is hailed everywhere with delight, and
General I'olieviejo's promptness in bring
ing about results favorable to the Spanish
arms is compared with ex-Captain-Gen
eral Blanco'a dilatory tactics, much to the
disparagement of the latter.
General Polieviejo has confirmed the
sentence of dtath imposed by a court
martial on eleven rebel chiefs, including
three priets. They will be shot to-morrow
at Manila.
A court-martial sittine at Manila has
commenced the trial of eighteen alleeed
rebels. The evidence thus far adduced
shows tu at the accused were in corre
spondence with patrons in Japan who
were interested in fomenting and aiding
the insurrection. The prosecutor asks
that sentenc â  of death be passed on all
the eighteen prisoner?.
The trial of eighty other men accused of
complicity in the revolt is impending and
sentence of death will be asked in tbe case
of each of them.
The dispatches from Manila state that a
great sensation has been caused thera by
the revelations that have been made by
conspirators now under arrest. One of
the prisoners has stated that he knew that
Japan intended to send a squadron of
warships 'to the Philippine Inlands and
that she would recognize the belligerency
of the rebels in all the provinces revolted.
This confirms the belief that has been en
tertained ever since the outbreak of the
insurrection that Japan is vcrv anxious' to
secure possession of the islands and is re
spousible for much, if not all of the
trouble.

MONEY ON A SPECIAL TRAIN.
Novel Measures Taken to Prepare for a
Run oh the first National Bank
of Cripple Creek.
COLORADO SPRINGS, C0i.0.. Jan 3.â
The attempt to make a run on the Fir3t
National Bank of Cripple Creek yesterday
was checked by quick action nnd in a
novel way. A rumor had been started De
cember 3. or perhaps some days previous,
that the bank could not stand the with
drawal of a pood deal of money, and in
consequence the bank would not open the
day after the new year.
This report came to President Parker of
the bank and on New Year's day he came
to this cily and arranged to get money to
take to Cripple Creek. He made these ar
rangements with the Frst National Bank
of this cily and they had their time locks
bo arranged that they could be opened at
7 o'clock in the morning. Cashier Sutton
was on hand at that hour and got the
money out for them, but how much money
was taken he refused to stale. In half an
hour a special train consisting of an engine
and one coach was waiting in the Tejuan
station of the Colorado Central Railroad
and President Parker and Vice-President
Devercaux were taken on board.
Tbty left here a; 7:30 o'clock promptly
and rnaae the fastest run ever made by
getting into Cripple Cieek in two hours
and three minutes. The run from D.vide
to Cripple Creek over the Terminal, thirty
miles of 3 per cent grade, was made in 54
minutes, and the delivery of the currency
occurred in the mid*t of "the run.
The First National| BanK of Cripple
Creek in its last sta'ement showed over 54
per cent of it* deposits on hand, and there
was no occasion whatever for any attempt
to make a run on the bank.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.
WILD WEATHER IN
WESTERN STATES
Nebraska, Minnesota, Kan-
sas and Missouri Buried
in Snow.
Railroads Blcckaded and Wires
Prostrated in Every
Direction.
B inding Blizzards end the Mercury
Out of Sightâ Great Loss of
Cattle Is Feared.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 3.â Nebraska is
just now enjoying an old-fashioned bliz
zard, the most serious one of the winter.
New Year's day was springlike and mild,
but Friday night the temperature began
to fall and the mercury has (ontinued its
descent since. Last evening a snowstorm
set in, which is general throughout the
State, and which is still falling to-night.
High winds are drifting the snow, and if
they continue through the night may
mate the situation on the plains alarm-
In'r.
Omaha seems, so far, to have escaped
the worst of the storm, but the trains
entering the city during the day were all
somewhat late. The streetcar lines are
badly crippled and it is necessitating the
use of extra forces of employes with snow-*
plows and sweepers to keep the lines open
so that occasional cars may be run.
At 10 o'clock to-night the thermometer
at tie local weather bureau registered
three degrees above zero, and the chances
are that the temperature will fail several
points below the zero mark before day
light. On the level tracts in the western
and central portions of the State, where
the wind has full sweep, it is much colder
and serious suffering is sure to result.
While the farmers have everything in
fair shape for severe weather, the storm
will beyond doubt find much of the stock
on the ranges and losses will be heavy.
From every section of the State come
reports of heavy winds driving the snow
in blinding clouds before it, so that it is
dangerous for any one to venture out.
At Meadow Grove the storm began about
midnight Saturdny night and a blizzard
has been raging ever since, with no siens
of abatemen'. Drifts are over ten feet
high and traffic i* becoming b'ocked.
LINCOLN, Nf.br., Jan. 3. â Lincoln is
almost snowbound to-night, a light fall
which began early this morning increas
ing during tbe day and developiug into a
regular northwester by night, with the
wind blowing a gale. Streetcar traffic on
suburban lines was abandoned during the
day and at 9 o'clock nearly every line was
blocked. Trains on nearly every road en
terir.e the city are delayed. Specials from
over the State indicate that the storm is
general and that cattle on the range may
suffer.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 3.â Tbe heaviest
rainstorm of recent years has prevailed
throughout Missouri, Northern Arkansas
and Indian Territory during the past
thirty-six hours. In many places in Mis
souri the streams are overflowed and in
some places railroads have suffered from
washouts. Last night the rain turned to
sleet and to-day a furious snowstorm is
raging. The temperature has fallen 40
degrees in Missouri and Eastern Kansas
in the last twenty-four nours and in the
latter section a genuine blizzard is sweep
ing over the country.
At Bagnell, Mo., the Osage River has
risen tifteen leet and Warsaw reports a
rise of twenty-two feet and a repetition of
last winter's flood is feared. At Osceola
the river is out of its banks and the bot
tom lands are submerged.
At Fayette the electric light power
house is flooded and the city is in dark
ness to-night. A number of washouts
have occurred on the railroads and traffic
is badly delayed.
In the vicinity of Sedalia every stream
is reported out of its banks and the rain
fall continued until this morning, when
it turned to sleet and later in the day a
heavy snowstorm set in.
At Lamonie and Knob a small cyclone
prevailed last night, many trees being
uprooted, but no large damage to prop
erty has been reported so far.
Webb Cty reports heavy damage to
property by rain and wind. Clinton,
Warrensburg and Shelbina suffered seri
ous damage from the downpour, the rain
fall being the greatest since the floods of
1895.
In many places in Western Missouri tl;e
mercury has fallen almost to zero, and
thi< drop in the temperature will probably
result in checking the flood.
In St. Louis a heavy rain has fallen
during the past twenty-fou-- hours, but at
7 o'clock 10-meht it was checked by a de
cided fall in the temperature, and at 9
o'clock the mercury had fallen 35 degrees,
and was accompanied by a nigh north
westerly wind.
The indications are that the first snow
fall or the neason will begin before
morning.
TOPEKA, Kans., Jan. 3.â ln Kansas the
rain whicli began Thursday lasted until
last evening, when a heavy snowstorn sec
in, which is still in progress. Traffic on
the Larnet-Jetmore extension of the Santa
Fe road is completely blocked. Travel
overland in any direction is almost impos
sible.
Abilene reports heavy snow, accompa
nied Dy wind reaching the proportions of
a blizzard. It is feared that loss of cattle
will result from the storm, particularly in
the western and northern sections of the
State.
In Northern Arkansas and as far west as
Fort Smith rain' fell during the twenty-
Jour hours up to noon to-day, when it
turned to snow, accompanied by a drop of
3G degrees in temperature.
Guthrie, Okla., reports a drop of 60 de
grees since last evening, and a severe snow
storm prevails in the western portion of
Indian Territory.
ST. PAUL, Minn.. Jan. 3.â A blizzard is
blowing to-night in this section over an
area of 400 miles north and south and 600
miles east and west. Over most of Minne
sota it has been snowing from fourteen to
twenty hours, and there is from seven to
sixteen inches of snow on the ground.
The wind is blowing a gale from the north.
The &now is damp and packs go solidly
on the railway tracks that it is difficult for
the snowplows to work through it. The
snow has also made a wreck of the tele
graph wires to the north and west of St.
Paul. All trains are moving, though
some of them are late.
South Dakota dispatches say the storm
extends as far west as the Black Bills. Id
the region along the Missouri River, from
Chamberlain to the North Dakota line,
railroad trains are having great difficulty
in moving, some of them having been
abandoned for :he night. The tempera
ture is from 15 to 18 degrees above zero,
though at 9 o'clock it was rapidly growing
colder. There will be suffering among
Â«tock if the mercury drops to zero.
CHICAGO FLOODED.
Sewera Choked and Much Damage Re-
Kultt in the Suburbs.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 3.â The rain
storm which has prevailed over Chicago
and Northern Illinois uninterruptedly for
three days has been the severest expe
rienced in this locality for two years. The
observations taken at the Weather Bureau
in this city to-night showed that the rain
fall was two and one-half inches since the
beginning of the storm early New Year's
morning. The temperature fell 20 de
grees in this city during the last eight
hours and at 11 o'clock to-night the rain
turned to snow. It is not expected by the
Weather Bureau that the thermometer
will reach the zero mark, although they
predict a temperature considerably below
freezing before to-morrow evening.
In Chicago great damage was done by
the downpour of rain, especially in the
suburbs, where the sewers were insuffi
cient to carry awny the volume of water.
Reports of flooded basements from the
southern and western portions of the city
were numerous, while at Grand Crossing
and near-by suburbs the streets were in
undated and the damage heavy. In low
places it is impossible for pedestrians to
move without wading in deep water and
boats were brought Into use.
At Austin and Oak Part, on the west
side, t lie conditions are annoying. Base
ments are flooded with several feet of
water and furnace fires in many localities
are extinguished. The pumping works
at Bridgeport are being operated with
great difficulty. It was thought at one
time this evening that the pumps would
have to be shut down on account of the
rapidly accumulating water, but the flood
gates were resorted to and the water shot
on its journey down the canal. The rain
continued steadily all day and at times
the precipitation was in the nature of a
cloudburst. The downtown streets were
deserted and the continuous shows and
other resorts lacked many patrons.
The concrete sidewalk surrounding the
Lincoln Bank at Michigan and Clark
streets collapsed during the afternoon as
the result of the rain. C B. Roser, a bar
ber of Ravenswood, was the only person
inirontof the building at the time. He
was precipitated to the basement, a dis
tance of several feet, but rescued from his
impromptu bath uninjured. A fence was
hastily erected about the opening. A
number of cedar block pavements in va
rious parts of the city were also more or
less damaged by the water. In many in
stances the blocks have been floated out
of position by tue water and the street
left in an impassable condition. Nearly
all the large caicii basins along West
Madison street, Michigan avenue, Wells
street and North avenue were stopped up
and as a result large ponds of water filled
the sides of the streets. Many basements
were flooded along West Madison street
and much damage was done to the occu
pants.
Cyclone Suw'pi <iÂ» Arltantna TotPn.
BENTOX, Ark., Jan. 3.â At 6:40 o'clock
last night a cyclone struck this town,
wrecking nearly every building in South
Benton, and passed on in a northeasterly
direction, damaging every building in its
p:>th. In an outhou-e near the depot a
tramp was killed. Many families are
homeless. The property loss will reach
into the thousands. Freiehtcars on the
siding at tne depot were overturned and a
wrecking crew has been at work all day.
BLACK HILLS MINING DEAL
Eastern Capitalists Buy Many Rich Claims
and Will Operate Them on an
Extensive Scale.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 3.â Sixteen
hundred acres of gold mines, embracing
159 claims in the richest part of the Black
Hills have been transferred to a new
mining and smelting company in whicii
prominent New Yorkers and Philadel
phians are interested.
The corporation, under the title of the
Edgemont and Union Hill Smelting Com
pany, came into legal existence early last
nijrht at its general office in the Corpora
t.on Trust Company building, in Jersey
City, by executing its articles of incor
poration and electing a board of directors,
whch immediately selected the officers of
the corporation. When this had been
done the deeds to the property, which
were previously executed, were formally
delivered and conveyed the mining claims
to the corporation.
R. E. Pattison, former Governor ol
Pennsylvania, was elected president ol
the company; J. T. Searles of New York,
vice-president; J. Wesley Suppler, presi
dent of the Corn Exchange Nntional Bank
of Philadelphia, treasurer; Thomas Brad
ley of Philadelphia, secretary. These
men are in the directory, together with
J. T. Andrus, John Dawson, J. Edward

CONGRESS` WORK
FOR THE WEEK
In the House the Loud
Postal Bill Comes Up
First.
Three Days to Be Devoted to a
Discussion of the Refunding
Scheme.
But There Is a Premise of Stubborn
Opposition to the Report of
the Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 3.â Just be
fore the hcliday recess the Hou.^e of Rep
resentatives, upon the recommendation of
the Committee on Rules, arranged the
business of the House for the first week
of the new year. On Tuesday and
Wednesday the Loud bill to amend the
postal laws so as to prohibit the transmis
sion in the mail of ferial-novel publica
tions and "sample" copies of newspapers
at the second-class rate will be the special
order. Discussion under the general rule
will continue from immediately after the
reading of the journal of Tuesday, the sth
inst., until 2 p. M. on Wednesday, and un
der the five-minute rule upon proposed
amendments until 4 o'clock, when voting
will bec;in upon pendinp amendments and
the final passage of the bill.
When the bill was called up, rather un
expectedly, several weeks ago, it devel
oped surprising strength, but since then
opposition has been active and the chances
of its passage are now considered rather
doubttul.
After this bill has been disposed of the
rest of tne week â Thursday, Friday and
Saturday â will be devoted to the consid
eration of the Pacific railroad funding bill,
reported by Judge Powers, chairman of
the Committee on Pacific Railroads. Two
days will be given to general discussion
nnd one day to debate and action in com
mittee of the whole upon proposed amend
ments. The bill will be reported to the
House at 5 o'clock Saturday and the vote
on its passage taken on Monday, the 11th
inst, immediately after the reading of
the journal.
The debate on this measure will doubt
less be interesting, owing to the opposi
tion which exists among members of the
House to the action of the majority of the
committee. The bill proposes to extend
the Government lien over all the physical
properties of tlie companies, which it is
claimed the present lien does not cover,
and substituting for all of the standing
obligations the new 4 per cent mortgage,
the Government debts to be carried at 2
per cent per annum. In addition to this
the Southern Pacific Company is required
to pay the amount charged against the
Central Pacific Company so long as it re
mains lessee thereof. The amount of the
Union Pacific mortgage will be $54,731,000,
and of the Central Pacific (net) $52,801,000.
Hubtian] of Missouri and bell of Texas
have made minority reports opposing the
report of the committee, the former rec
ommending the bill drawn by Attor
ney-General Harmon and introduced by
Senators Brice and Morgan to enforce the
Government liens upon the property by
proceedings in the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia, and the latter that
the debts of the companies be extended at
3 per cent instead of 2, secuied by a first
mortgage upon all their properties. They
will probaoiy lead the debate against the
committee's bill.
By the terms of the orders making these
measures the special business, considera
tion of any other matters is shut out, and
it will take unanimous consent to act on
anything else until the orders have been
exhausted. The only exception is that on
Friday night private pensions will be dis
cussed for two hours and a half, as usual
without a quorum.
BUS IS ESS OF IHE sky ATE.
Ihere JÂ» Said to He Opposition to the
Camrron Jtoiolutlon.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 3.â When
the Senate meets Tuesday morning it is
quite likely that the debate on matters per
taining to our foreign relations, and tne
position assumed by Secretary Olney for
the Executive, will at once beein to take
shape. Whether Cameron will call up toe
Cuban resolution on the opening day of
the session is not yet known, for that Sen
ator has not yet returned to the city and
the subject is entirely in his hands. It is
hardly thought that he will seek to force
the issue on the opening day, owing to the
fact that there is not likely to be a quorum
of the Senate present.
During the morning hour, however,
under any guise that may be put forward,
the debate on the subject can be com
menced, but it must give way to the un
finished business at 2 o'clocK, unless there
are sufficient votes to displace the Okla
homa free homestead bill with the more
pressing question of Cuba. The home
stead hill, which is championed by Petti
grew, is not to have smooth sailing. A
strong minority report by Platt is to be
presented, and that Senator will lead the
opposition to the measure on the floor of
the Senate.
Hale, who Is looked upon as the leader
of the anti-Cuban recognition in the Sen
ate, said yesterday that several Senators
who had been heretofore silent on the sub
ject had come out against the Cameron
resolution, and there was not a possible
chance for its passage.
On the ot: er hand Cameron, LoJge,
Chandler, Morgan and Mills assert that
the sentiment favoring action by Congress
is becoming more vigorous and that the
fighting will be forced from the Ptart.
tiaie, who in the absence of Allison is act
iim as chairman of the Committee on Ap
propriation?, expects to have the army
bill reported to the Senate Wednesday,
and this will be put forward to antagonize
the Cuban proposition.
Two speeches are booked for the coming
week â one by Peffer, probably Wednes
day, on bis resolution for the appoint
ment of delegates to a National mone
tary conference and another by Proctor on
the joint resolutions providing for the
election of the President and Vice-Presi
dent and Senators by popular vote.
A RESV LI OF HULL TIMES.
H u/jes of Chicago Steal Jinil Worker* to
lie Jirducd.
CHICAGO, lll., 'Jan. 3.â The employes
of the Illinois Steel Company were noti
fied yesterday that their wages would be
cut February 1. The notice was brought
to the 3,500 men at the South Chicago
mills early in the day. They were told
that the amount of reduction had not yet
been decided, but it is generally believed
that it will be about i'O per cent."
President Gates said last nicht that
every official and employe would be cut.
The salary of every head of department
which is now more than $100 per month
will be reduced from 15 to 50 per cent.
"This is simply the result of a poor busi
ness, " said President Gates. "During the
past year the price of steel rails has been
reduced $3 per ton. and this of itself
means a loss ol over $1,000,000 to the Illi
nois Steel Company."
STRANGE CELESTIAL PHENOMENON.
Peculiar P.nkness in the Sky Gives the
Earth the Appearance of Being
on Fire.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Jan. 3. -An ex
traordinary celestial phenomenon was
visible here about 7 o'clock this mornine.
Thiok, heavy clouds were rolling and sud
denly the sky was overcast with a peculiar
pinkness and the ray 3 rt-flecied gave the
earth the appearance of being on fire. The
remarkable display lasted perhaps ten
minutes, but it was startling during its
brief existence.
The Weatner Bureau explains that it
was tbe sun's rays reflected through a
certain cioud. It was followed by a heavy
gale along the la&e front. Persons resid
ing at West E::d declare that in eleven
years they have not witnessed such a
storm. The people there werÂ« much
frightened. The waters of Lake Ponchar
train were driven and overflowed Spanish
Fort, and all the roads leading from the
city to the lake, in some places reaching a
depth of three feet. Nothing has been
heard from Mandeville ana places on tbe
other side of the lake.
PUOLIXQ THEIR ISSUES.
Effort* of the I'.ia : Steel . Manufacturer*
hUJjUJ^; to Continue the Combine.
â  NEW YORK. ,N. V., Jan. 3.-There is
reason to believe . that a report will be
submitted early next week by the special
committee appointed at the recent meet
ing of the American Bessemer Steel Asso
ciation, held in this city, to see what could
be done toward smoothing over the seri
ous differences of opinion amonsr some of
the big steel manufacturers. Dispatches
from the West intimate that arrangements
hÂ»ve practically been made for a continu
ation of the combination, the dissolution
of which was threatened by the with
drawal of the Bellaire Steel Company of
Ohio.
The Carnegie, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and Illinois Steel Companies were con
spicuously interested in the recent meet
ing, and it is believed that through their
efforts a harmonious arrangement has
been made with tbe Bellaire Steel Com
pany. Some important developments are
expected at the meeting which has been
called for next week by Secretary Griscom.
Whether tbe meeting will be held in this
city or in Pittsburg, has not been made
public.
Even though the breach in the ranks of
the American Bessemer Steel Association
be closed up, it is not considered likely
that any attempt to advance the price of
steel billets will be made. The present
condition of the steel market is not favor
able to high prices, and the existing price
of $17 per ton for steel billets is about all
that the market will statid. The makers
of steel rails are putting down their prices
in order to get orders.
GEHEItAL SWAIb'S APPEAL..
Setks to Itrccirer Pity Withh-'ld as a lCe-
milt of =t Court- Martial.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 3.â The
claim of Brigadier-General D. G. Swain,
retired, formerly Judge- Advocate General
of the Army, for the amount of his pay
withheld under the execution of the find
ing of a court-martial will come before
the Supreme Court of the United States
this week for argument, he having aiÂ«
pealed from the decree of the court of
claims, which rejected his suit. General
Swain was tried by a court-martial on
charges preferred by Major R. N. Scott,
acting under orders from the Secretary of
War, and found guilty of conduct unbe
coming a gentleman and an officer, and
sentenced to be suspended from rank and
duty for twelve years, and to forfeit half
bis "pay for eac:i month of that period.
He sued to iecover the suma so withheld
on the ground that t c court-martial
which tried him was illegally constituted;
that the charges against him were not
properly preferred, and that the facts
proved constituted no offense.
General Swain has filed a lengthy brief
in support of his appeal, but the Govern
ment law officers have not yet advised the
court of their intentions in the matter.
WUECK OF A FREIGHT TllAiy.
The Locomotive Goes Ortr an Etnbank-

HOLDEN, MO., Jan. 3.â To-day a freight
train on the Missouri Pacific Railway ran
into a landslide near this place. The lo
comotive toppled over an embankment
and three of the crew were almost in
stantly killed.
The dead are: Gomer Evans, engineer,
married; Harry Hukop, fireman, married;
J. E. McQueen, brakeman, unmarried.
The men lived in St. Louis. Two other
members of the crew were sliehtlv injured.
The recent heavy rains caused a large
mass of earth to slide down upon the
track, and the train crashed into the ob
struction while running at a hish rate of
speed, derailing the engine and a dozen
cars. Wreckine trains were sent from
Sedalia and Jefferson City, and the tracks
were cleared.

NEW COMBINATIONS
AS TO THE CABINE
All Selections Not to Be
Mads Until the First
Week in March.
If Sherman Accepts the Sta'e
Portfolio Hanna Wants to
Be a Senator.
Major McKinl.-y Will Treat the Coun
try to a Surprise if Allison
and Dingley Decline.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 3.â Major
McKinley expects to set to work on his
inaugural address to-morrow mornine
and to finish it by the end of ihe week, if
tbe office-seekers give him an opportunity.
He fee.s that the time between the present
and inauguration is very short and said
this evening there would be so much to do
that the few weeks remaining to him
would slip by very swiftly. Major Mc-
Kinley v.ants to get the principal poVt
fol'Od in his Cabinet assigned within a
fortnight or three weeks, but the Cabinet
as a whole will not be c unpleted till the
first of March. During Major McKinley's
present visit to Cleveland it is probable
that Mr. Hanna will come to some de
cision about his relation to the next ad
ministration, though his movements will
to a considerable degree be regulated by
Senator Sherman's final determination in
respect to the Cabinet. The impression
prows that Senator Sherman's friends in
many parts of the country are urging him
to accept the portfolio of State if it is
offered him.
Mr. Hanna apparently wants to go to
the Senate, but if Senator Sherman does
not go into the Cabinet the way is firmly
closed against him.
Senator S. M. Cullom of Illinois was
here .to-day and spent two hours with
Major McKinley this morning. He said
the opinion prevailed among Senators
that Mr. Sherman, while perhaps notquite
willing to go into the Cabinet, seemed to
regard the proposition with less disfavor
than formerly. Senator Cnllom said he
had no desire at this lime to leave the
Senate and that he was not to be con
sidered a Cabinet possibility. It is his
belief that Illinois may not be represented
in the Cabinet at all. He discussed the
Senatorial contest with Major McKinley
and said to the President-elect that so
much confusion existed it was impossible
to forecast the result Senator Cullom
expressed the opinion that in the event of
a prolonged and bitter contest the prize
might fall to the lot of Governor Tanner
himself. Senator Cullom said the im
pression existed among his colleagues In
the United States Senate that Mr. Allison
would not be inclined to give up his pre
sent career to accept a Cabinet portfolio,
but remarked that he hoped the lowa
Senator could be prevailed upon to be
come Secretary of the Treasury.
If neither Mr. Allison nor Mr. Dineley
should be in Major McKinley's Cabinet a
new quantity for Secretary of the Treas
ury will have to be found and the chances
are that tbe President-elect will treat the
country to something of a surprise.
A good deal of speculation about the
New England member of tue Cabinet has
been heard in the last day or two, botli
here and in- Canton. If Mr. Dingley re
mains at the head of the Committee on
Ways and Means another man from his
section of the country will be invited to
accept a Cabinet position. The names of
Senators Proctor of Vermont and Lodge
of Massachusetts are discussed not a
little anti the selection of either of them
by Major McKinley should occasion no
surprise. If a Secretary of State is not
chosen from New York it may be set
down as certain that Cornelius N. Bliss
will be in Major McKinley's Cabinet.
There has been no change in the situation
so far as Mr. Bliss is concerned, nor is
there likely to be, save in the contingency
just mentioned.

FUNDS FOR THE
KAISER`S ARMY
The Reichstag Expected to
Increase the Budget
Estimate.
Big Guns Being Turned Out Day
and Night at the Krupp
Works.
RusEia Seeks to Negotiate an Enormous
Loan â Signs of Better Times in
the Czar's Dominion.
(Copyright, 1897, by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germant, Jan. 3.â The new
artillery bill, which will be laid before the
Reichstag soon after the Chamber re
sumes its sittings, will propose an addi
tion to the military budget of 177,000,000
marks. Certain semi-official papers, com
menting on the reports current last week
t hat 200,000,000 marks should be demanded,
nave denied tlie accuracy of the statement
and inferentially suggested that the coun
try had at present no reason to fear an ad
ditional burden through the army esti
mates. In point of fact the new bill has
for some time been drafted and forms part
of a general scheme involving the creation
of new regiments of infantry and a new
grouping of battalions and brigades.
Military authorities who are permitted
to speak on the subject, and whose opinion
is worth having, deny the current reports
that the impending reorganization of the
artillery is due to the Canet quick-firing
gun beine adopted for the French army.
The new German field-gun, which was
tested at Krupp's in the presence of the
Kaiser and a special staff of officers more
than a year ago, was approved as the most
potent iield piece yet invented, and bas
since been under constant construction.
The Kaiser keeps in close touch with
Krupp'n, at whose works guns on the new
model, but of different caliber, are being
rapidly manufactured and tested.
Leading Berlin banking firms concur in
crediting the report that the Russian
Government l:as been negotiating a new
loan in Paris, amounting to no less than
600,000,000 marks. Private advices from
St. Petersburg, supported by letters from
Paris, at first mentioned an even ereater
sumâ Boo,ooo,oooâ and added that the
French bankers had refused to consider
terms on the ground that France was
overloaded with Rossini loans; that part
of the last loan had not yet been absorbed
by the public, ai:d further, that under the
conditions of that loan Russia wis de
barred irom raising another before April,
1897.
Some tentative action toward negotiat
ing with Berlin and Frankfort houses has
been going on since the reluctance of the
French bankers to loan became known at
St. Petersburg, but these overtures were
not received favorably, so the Russian
Finance Minister has resumed communi
cation with Paris firms. The loan, if ob
tained soon after April, will be the pre
lude to the resumption of specie payments
by Russia, provided nothing happens in
Europe to endanger the Czar's present
peace policy.
Apropos of the now Known tendency of
Nicholas II toward a liberal and pacific
regime, advices from Warsaw and other
centers in Poland concur lit speaking o!
a marked change in the restrictive meas
ures enforced against the people by the
authorities, greater freedom being allowed
to the press and the public. A notable
instance of the change of spirit in the
Russian authorities is seen in the corre
spondence of tne St. Petersburg Novoe
Vremya, which has opened its columns to
advocacy of the conciliation of Poland, a
larger degree tif toleration for the Catho
lic Poles and the" cessation of restrictive
measures throughout those now wide
regions where the Russian Government
has the adhesion of the people.
The Novoe Vremya has long been the
fierce enemy of the Catholic Poles, and
this change of front is therefore signifi
cant. The Czar's recent action in resist
ing the pressure of the Moscow authorities
to punish the riotous university students
by deporting them to Siberia is another
favorable sign of better times in Russia.
The first recepti6n at court of the new
French Embassador, the Marquis de No
ailles, is fixed for the third week in Janu
ary. It is understood that the Kaiser in
tends to mark the occasion as an especially
brilliant court function. The substitution
â¢f a French aristocrat of polished man
ners for a bourgeois, M. Herbette, whom
court and Kaiser alike detested, may do
much to smooth diplomatic relations be
tween Paris and Berlin.
The non-committal tactics of Count
Badeni, the Austrian Prime Minister, on
the eve of the dissolution of the Austrian
Reichsrath and the consequent holding of
a new general election, an described in
these dispatches last Sunday, remain lit
erally true, but there are now signs that
the Premier will favor the clerical party
whenever he can. Hitherto he has been
virtually sitting on the fence and observ
ing the indications of increasing strength
of the various parties with a view of as
certaining which group is worth while
cultivating as suppo rters of the Ministry,
but within a few days ne has shown his
preference by filling a number of vacan
cies in several provinces by the appoint
ment of men of clerical, or at any rate,
anti-semitic tendencies.
Berlin as well as Vienna court circles
have recently been eagerly watching the
development of a scandal connected with
tne career of the Austrian Crown Prince
Rudolph, who with his mistress, the
Baroness Marie Vetsera, committed
suicide at Meyerling in January, 1889. It
is known that the Emperor Francis Joseph
had paid enormous sums to meet the re
sponsibilities which his son left behind
him and to conceal some of the lament
able results of his disorderly life.
Some correspondence which the Arch
duke left fell Into the hands of a man who
did not scruple to have part of it photo
graphed and sent to the Emperor, with an
offer to restore the.-originals for a laree
sum, the alternative being publication.
As the letters contained some frank criti
cisms of the Emperor's secret policy and
of the personages around the throne the
affair became a matter of reference to the
Cabinet. Arrests and legal prosecution in
camera were talked of in Austrian court
circles for a time, but now it is understood
that there will Le no public scandal, the
matter having been arranged privately.
The members of the Berlin Produce Ex
change began business yesterday mder
the Bourse law, which went into effect
on January 1, as a free institution instead
of a close organization, as formerly, but
very little business was done. The Berlin
Association exchanged communications
with the free associations (formerly the
bourses) of Halle, Stettin, Brunswick and
other centers and some future transactions
were recorded. Tlie day was a partial
holiday, however, and consequently less
business was done than otherwise could
have been transacted. Public opinion, as
well as the opinion of the entire press,
with the exception of the conservative and
agrarian journals, are in complete sympa
thy with the bourslers in defiance of the
laws.
The National Zeitung applauds the ac
tion of the German bourses, and declares
that it was necessary for them to act as
they have done as a matter of self-defense
against the Junkers.
The Tageblatt, in an article under the
caption, "The Fight Commenced," sees
no end to the warfare unless the agrari
ans, frightened at the result of their own
folly, assist the Government to clamber
down from the position they have as
sumed.
The Vossische Zeitung predicts that the
fight will ultimately eid in the viotory of
the mercantile community.
In Government circles the hope is ex
pressed that the coming election of the
executive committee and chairman of the
Bourse may influence the boursiers in the
direction of some form of compromise, the
nature of which, however, the official
mind is not yet able to foreshadow.
In the meantime the only possible com
promise that the Bourse operators will
accept will be the suppression of the
clunses which interfere with their busi
ness. The stock bourses of Berlin and
Frankfort were stagnant yesterday, in
view of the uncertainty of the effect of the
prohibitory clauses of the new law. Yes
terday's buying was consequently confined
to Government siocks. Upward of COO
members of the Produce Exchange have
joined the newly formed iree association.

ing favorably. His wound is healing and

The extremely slight chances of the sup
pression of dueling in Germany may be
judged by the fact that the duel be

that Dr. xon Hollebsn, the Prussian

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.
BOLD MURIETTA'S
HOARD IS THEIRS
Proof That the Outlaw's
Gold Was Found Near
Fresno.
Trunk in Which It Was Buried
Exhibited in a Firebaugh
Hotel.
Lucky Discoverers of the Loot Guard
ing Their Fortune by Strictest
Secrecy.
FRESNO, Cak, Jan. 3.â The men who
unearthed a truckful of gold near this
city a few days ago, as reported in The
Call at the time, are maintaining the
greatest secrecy in regard to their lind.
They fear that if the facts find their way
to the authorities the State will put in a
claim for its share. For thi3 reason the
lucky discovery is being kept as quiet aa
possible.
One of the finders of the fortune was
J. G. Woffoid, but the name of his com
panion cannot be learned. Wofford, ac
cording to his own statement, merely
accompanied the man to whom the for
tune belongs as a friend, and he will not
say whether or not he received or is to re
ceive a portion of the treasure.
It was near the Firebaugh graveyard
and not the Mountain View Cemetery
near this city, as first reported, that the
trunk containing the large amount of
gold was unearthed. The spot was about
a quarter of a mile from tbe burial
ground.
The treasure is supposed to have been
buried by Joaquiu Murietta, the notorious
bandit of the early days of California. It
is said that a wealthy cattle-dealer had
come to Firebaugh to buy stock and had
the money in his trunK. The outlaw
murdered the man and stole his trunk, but
was unable to carry the money away
with him. He therefore buriad the trunk
and treasure where it was found.
For some reason Murietta was unable to
make use of his ill-gotten wealth. He
never returned lor it. It appears that he
gave the description of the location of the
trunk to some friend, who recently died.
Before this person passed away he gave
Murietta's description of the spot where
the fortune mignt be found to Wofford's
friend and this man and Wofford were
not. long in making a search for it.
The two drove from this city over to
Firebaugh at night in order that no one
would know where they went. They spent,
the day in hunting for the spot wl.ere
the trunk was hidden, and so accurate
a description had .Marietta given of
its location that they found it with com
paratively little difficulty.
The trunk was buried two feet below
the surface. It was pulled out of its rest
ing place, but the woodwork had all de
cayed and it fell to pieces. Neatly packed
in bottom lay tbe bags of gold. There
were twenty-four of themânineteen of
coin and five of slugs of bullion. The
finders appraise the treasure at about
$147,000, the exact value of the slugs hav
ing not yet been ascertained.
Wofford and his friend transferred the
gold from the smaller bags in which they
found it, and which had rotted so that
they would hardly hold together, into a
sack they had and left the trunk on the
ground. They then returned to Fire
baugh and that night drove back to
Fresno. Wofford refuses positively to re
veal the identity of his friend, to whose
interest he is, of course, very much de
voted.
It is reported that a hotel-keeper at
Firebaugh is in possession of â¦he trunk in
which the treasure was found. He saw
the account of the discovery published in
The Call and then came to the conclu
sion thai the two men who had made a
strange visit to the town were the-fortune
seekers.
The fact that the treasure was supposed
fo haVe been buried by Munetta strength
ened his belief that it bad been found in
the vicinity of Firebaugb, that having
been a favorite stopping place of the ban
dit. He went toward the graveyard, in
the direction he had seen the two strangers
take, and soon ran across the trunk. He
found twelve of the bags in which the
money had been buried, the finders hav
ing taken the others with them as curio?.
The hotel man took the trunk, or tli#
pieces of it, back to Firebaugh and is said
to ue exhibiting it.
The story of the discovery of the treas
ure is of course doubted by many, but
there are circumstances that justify the
opinion that the doubters may be pushing
their incredulity to extremes.
RATE WAR AT EUREKA.
Rival Steamship Companies Contending
for the Control of Northern
California Trade.
EUREKA, Cal., Jan. 3.â With the com
pletion of the new steamer Humboldt the
people of this county are looking forward
to a rale war, which cannot but benefit
them. This benefit will be manifested in
reducad rates of tare and freight and
quicker and better service between Eureka
and San Francisco.
The opposing powers in this war for
traffic will be the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company of San Francisco and the Hum
boldt SteamÃhip Company of Eureka, and
the weapons will be the first-named com
pany's steamer Pomona, one of the finest
ana fastest boats on the coast, and the
new Humboldt of the latter company,
which is expected to be the Pomona's
equal if not its superior in appointments
and speed.
The new steamship will probably not be
ready to take its place on the route beiore
FeDruary, but the San Francisco com
pany has already taKen the initiative and
in a manner forced the fight. It is gen
erally understood here that the combina
tion which existed between the two com
panies while the old Humbold t was on the
route will obtain no longer, and that it
will be each company for itself, although
they may unite against their common
enemy, the steam schooners, that have
made such inroads on the trade.
The first move by the San Francisco
company was to announce a change of
agents here, which went into effect on
New "Year's day. John R. Baird suc
ceeded H. P. Riddle, an old employe of
the company, who has had the agency
here for the past eipht years. Mr. Bard
was formerly agent fdr tne old Humbold t,
is a native of Eureka, is thoroughly famil
iar with the steamship business here and
is popular with ths shippers and traveling
public. The next move was the making
of improvements about the warehouse and
wharf here to facilitate ' the handling of
freight, and then cams the announcement
of a cut in fare on the first of the year,
round-trip tickets good for thirty days
being sold for three-quarters and two-
Ahirds of regular price, according to berth.
PORTLAND CROOK RISKS LIFE.
Plunges Into the Water After an Out-
going Steamship and Is Hauled
Aboard.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 3.â A daring and
successful attempt to swing himself aboard
the outgoing Caiifornia-bound steamahip
State ot California by means of a rope was
made last night by H. J. Lusk, an ex-con
vict who bad become too well known to
the authorities to permit him to further
operate here. Shortly before the steamer
cast its lines Lusk was seen on the dock
by Detectives Welsh and Simons, whom
he toid that he was going to San Francisco
to locate permanently. The officer in
charge ot the slip Knew Lusk, and as he
failed to exhibit a ticket he refused to
allow him on the gang-plank.
Lusk bore a look of dismay, but he
tightened the straps of his small valise
securely about his left arm and as the
steamer swung from its berth he rushed
to the edge of the dock, shouting "Throw
me a line!"
In the fraction of a second about fifteen
feet of rope was flung from the lower deck
of the steamer and was nimbly caught by
Lusk. He had no time to fasten it about
his waist, but being a powerlui man tie
clutched it in both hands and swung off.
The next instant Lusk dropped into the
water and his body bumped up against
the sides of the huge steamer with a thud
that could be distinctly heard on the doct.
He lost his hat, which floated away with
the current.
A. cry of horror went up from hundreds
who had witnessed this scene, everybody
believing the intrepid man to have been
crushed to ceatu by his violent collision
with the steamer. But a dozen hearty
deckhands pulled Lusk aboard. That he
was not much hurt was evident, as from
the dock he could be seen hurrying to a
plare of concealment the moment he was
aboard. It was the unanimous sentiment
ashore that such an exhibition of courage
deserved a gratuitous cabin passage.
RAN AWAY FROM SAN JOSE.
Two Adventurous Girls Captured in San
Francisco and Returned to
Their Homes.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 3.â Lizzie Foster
and Mamie Spellman, girls who ran away
from their homes in this city about ten
days ago, were brought back from Sun
Francisco by Detective E. H. Frost to
day. They were stopping at the Globe
lodging-house, on Howard street, and do
ing the City. The girls had $7 in money
and a watch when they left here, and
when arrested they were penniless and
ready to return home.
Just before leaving home the girls were
arrested for disturbing the peace of T.
Hansene, a waiter, whom they contin
ually annoyed by calling him a '"cheap
euy." As soon as they were released on
their own recognizance they left the city.
The Foster girl is 16 years old and Mies
Spellman one year her junior. An effort
will be made to send tuein to the Whittier
Reform School.
Detective Frost also brought back
Ignacio Palunco, who is wanted on a
charge of embezzling $19 belonging to the
Bryan Fifty, a campaign club.
WHAT HO KOItIXS EAI?
Santa Clara Stiperrtiors Jit quest Infor
mation on the Subject.
SAN JOSE, CAr,., Jan. 3.â Horticultural
Commissioner Ebrhorn will make an in
vestigation as to what lobins and other
birds feed on and as to whether they are
beneficial ia orchards and vineyards, and
report to the Board of Supervisors during
Ihe month. This will be done on ac
count of the recent agitation against the
killing of robins by hunters in the belief
that they destroy insects and pests In
jurious to trees and vines. At present
the weight of opinion is in favor of the
robins, but there is some foundation for
the belief that robins destroy the Aus
tralian lady- bird s and other consumers of
scale pests.
In order to determine what the birds
feed on Commissioner Ehrhorn will kill
and dissect specimens at certain times of
the day, just after they have been feed
ing and before the food has had a chance
to digest. If it is found that they destroy
only insects injurious to fruit trees the
Supervisors will be asked to pass an or
dinance protecting them.

AFTER A SUIT
CAME A FIGHT
Stockholders of the Gold
Ridge Mine Had Been
Quarreling.
Contest in Court Followed by
the Fatal Combat of
Thursday.
Ex â¢ Superintendent Phelaa Claims
That the Killing of Muller Was
in Salf-Eefcnse.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., Jan. 3.â Further
details of last Thursday's gun tight at the
Gold Ridge mine were received here to
day. It is learned that two of the partici
pants in the combat in which Paul Muller
of San Francisco lost his life and James
O'Connor was seriously wounded were the
stockholders of the mine company. They
had quarreled and soon pistols were
brought into play to settle their differ
ences.
There had been some trouble in the
company, resulting in a lawsuit, and
Richard Phelan, superintendent of the
mine, was put in as keeper. Phelan and
two others visited Hilda Camp ana the
Milton dam on Thursday, and upon their
return to tne mine were met by Muller
and O'Connor. The former, who was one
of the stockholders, informed Phelan that
a sufficient bond had been put up to re
lease the mine from his care. Phelan ex
pressed his satisfaction that such was the
case.
Here O'Connor began to abuse Mr.
Phelan, and finally attacked him. Phelan
drew his revolver and fired. He claims
that he shot over O'Connor's head to in
timidate him, but when be did so Muller
hred at him with a rifle. The bullet
missed Phelan and hit O'Connor instead.
Before Muller could tire a second shot,
Phelan and Owen White returned the fire
with their revolvers. Both shots took
effect and Muller received wounds from
which he died in a couple of hours.
O'Connor, who was seriously wounded,
was taken to S:erra City the nert day.
Coroner Hocking of this county met the
party there to-night. The Coroner is
authorized to arrest all concerned and
bring them to Nevada City for trial. Phe
lan makes no denials, and claims it was
clearly a case of self-defense with him.
\V. F. McLaughlin, secretary and treas
urer of tha Gold Ridge Mining Company,
when seen at his residence last nightjaid
that Muller, who was a stockholder and
superintendent of the mine, had been sent
up from this City about three months ago
to do the assessment work on the loca
tion. James O'Connor, who is also a resi
dent of this City, went with him as an
assistant. Pheian.whojhad been formerly
superintendent of the mine, had inter
fered with the work of relocation, and
about a aonth ago was put under bonds
to keep the peace.
Muller is not known to have any rela
tives here, and as most of his time was
spent away from the City his circle of ac
quaintances is not large.
ROMANCE OF TACOMA.
Divorce Granted to an Heiress Who
Eloped With a Poor Man Two
Years Ago.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan 3.â The sequel to
an interesting elopement of two years ago
last June came yesterday, when a divorce
was granted to Mrs. James H. Dege,
daughter of J. J. Westbrook, capitalist.
It is understood tl*at ever since her mar
riage, when several years under her ma
jority, Mrs. Dege's parents hay* been en
deavoiing to persuade her to leave her
husband and return to the parental house.
The divorce was secured very quietly,
and it was greatly desired by those most
interested that it be kept secret. Its an-
nouncement to-day caused no less surprise
than did the elopement. The action was
based on alleged incompatibility.
Miss Westbrook was surrounded by
every comfort which wealth could procure
when Mr. Dege commenced calling at her
home. He was then clerk at Gross Bros.,
but soon afterward became teller in the
newly organized Commercial Bank.
In "the" spring of 1893 he accompanied
Miss Westbrook to Trinity Church one
Sunday, and afterward they were married
by Rev. Dean Richmond Babbitt. They
took a wedding trip and seemingly paid
no attention to the anger of the stern
parents, whose shock on first hearing of
the marriage led them to express their
dislike for Mr. Dege in very strong terms.
They hoped their daughter would repent
ana return to her home, but expressed no
desire to receive their son-in-law.
Later Mr-. Dege and her parents became
reconciled and were frequently seen to
gether in public. It was generally sup
posed that Mr. Dege also had been taken
into the Jamily, though at the time of the
elopement Mr. and Mrs. Westbrook de
clared he should never receive a cent of
their money or property. In adherence
to this declaration it seems quite certain
now that they have gradually induced
their daughter to seek a divorce. It is
generally believed that she would have
been disinherited had she done otherwise.
Mr. Dege is employed at the People's
store, and will this month secure a place
at the courthouse under the incoming
Democratic Assessor.
JiOUY Jf'OUSD XBA& TAZLtJO.
Xear It Wa* a Hotile Containing the
Xaine of a Steamship.
VALLEJO, Cat., Jan. 3.â William Col
vin and Robert Craig, while hunting on
the marshes near Dutchmans Slough yes
terday afternoon, discovered the headless
body of a man partly buried in the sand
on the seashore. The clothing was badly
torn and around the waist there was a
small leather belt which cad evidently
done service in lieu of suspenders.
About twenty feet from the corpse the
young hunters found a mustard bottle
containing a. piece of wrapping paper. On
this paper was written, "J. D. Peters, Sept.
8, 1896." The bottle had evidently b/en
thrown overboard from the Stockton
steamship bearing that name. It is likely
that it had been cast from the vessel by
some one returning from the Native Sons'
festivities at Siockton on September 9.
Whether this bottle and the note it con
tained had any connection with the
drowning of the person whoise body was
found to-day can only be conjectured.
Evidently the body had been in tue water
for several months.

FITTING WARSHIPS
FOR LONG CRUISES
Unusual Activity at the
Mare Island Naval
Station.
Quantities of Supplies Received
Within the Past Few
Days
Vessels Now- Idle Are Being Maa*
Ready to Sail at an Hour's
Notice.
VALLEJO, Cal., Jan. 3.â There a â¢
evidences of unusual activity at the Mare
Island Navy-yard. One of the best indi
cations that "something is doing" with
the powers at Washington Â«s the appro
priation of large sums of money to man
the ships and increase the fighting forces.
Many awards ot contracts have been made
at Washington in the past few days for
supplies for repairs on the warships and
buildings at Mare Island. Evidently it is
the desire of the Washington department
to follow the old adage, "In time of peace
prepare for war."
Thirty thousand gallons of sperm and
lubricating o'.ls have recently been re
ceived at the navy-yard for use on the
ships of war. Such an immense quantity
has never been received at one time since
the station ,was located at Mare Island.
At the time of the Chilean episode, out
siders had no knowledge of what was
going on until barges began to arrive with
thousands of tons of coal on board. It
soon became apparent that these large
supplies were being stored for a purpose,
and those who remember the activity in
naval circles at that time believe that the
supplies now being received at the yard
are evidence of a sudden determination to
give some of the now idle cruisers and
men-of-war something to do. What their
destination will be is, of course, not
known.
The Baltimore and Charleston can be
made ready for sea within a few week.*.
The Petrel is taking on ccal and provi
sions and is expected to go to sea the lat
ter part of the week. The Adams is at the
yard, to be docked at once. In a short
time it will return to San Francisco as a
temporary training-ship.
The carrier pigeons at the Mare Island
yard are being practiced daily in flights
from various points back to their cote?.
This innovation will be found very effi
cient should the services of the swift birds
be reauired in the transmission of mes
sages from sea to land in time of war.
Chaplain McAllister and wife left for
the East a Jew days ago, bearing witli
them the best wishes of every one at the
yard.

OF CALIFORNIA
The members of the >ationai liuara oi
the Slate are now turning their eyes.
toward Sacramento to see what the legis
lators will do for them. There are many
things they need in order to bring them
to the standard of an efficient militia, but
whether they will receive them is a matter
that cannot be foretold.
Adjutant-General Barrett, in the bien
nial report, issued a few days since, asks
for the statutory appropriations. He
wants $40,000 for new uniforms, $31,500
for new overcoats and $10,500 lor blankets,
making a total of $82,000. These demands
are based on uniforms at $S each, over
coats at $9 each and blankets at $o 50 a
pair. The men who wiU have to use and
wear these are pleased that the demand
has been made, but express the hope that
the next lot will be of that class of
material that will be comfortable and ser
viceable and not merely for show or sum-
mer wear.
The Adjutant-General asks for an appro
priation sufficient to permit of the holding
of camps of instruction to be held in each
of the two years for which the appropria
tion shall be made. Then he wants $5000
To pay for coaling and cruising expenses
of the Cornanche, the vessel used by the
Naval Reserve, and a like amount for a
special emergency fund to prevent ths
putting in at the close of the term of two
years' deficiency bills.
Further, he asks for $1500 for the pre
sersation oi the records of the California
Volunteers and recommends that tne
btate shall build armories in all places in
California where there are more than two
companies.
â  The Adjutant-General has been in cor
respondence with Adjutant-Generals of
other States, and a result of tbis corre
spondence will be the formulation of a
bill to be presented to Congress asking for
an increased appropriation for the
National Guard of tne several States. The
amount at present appropriated i 3 $400,-
CUU, and the amount that will be named
in the bill to be presented will be $3,500,
--000. The argument that will be offered in
support oi thii demand is that the Guard
is liable to be railed upon at any moment
to supj>ort the Union in case of war, and
that being iho case the general Govern
ment should meke the proper provision
for the GuarJ.
One thing that is necessary for the
efficiency of the Guard and for the sake of
uniiormity is a revision of the mles and
resulations. Our citizen soldiers are will
ing to conform to the rules that are made
to govern them, but they would like to
have those rules so clear that they may be
a uniform adoption of them. Those
now governing are so unsatisfactory that
every individual who reads can place al
most any interpretation on them desired.
For instance, a few days since lor want of
clearly d fined rules there appeared at a
funeral the Governor's staff, the division
st:tff and a brigadier-general's staff, each
attired differently ana each under the im
pression that the uniform or dre=-s worn
was the proper thing. The staff that was
atiired in civilian's dress was the proper
one, as the one whoie memory they had
a--emDled to respect was not entitled to
military honors.
Ths new firing regulations, an abstract
of which appeared in The Call Jast Fri
day. ..ave been the subject of much talk
g the guardsmen and the comments
are not as favorable as those who promul
gated them expected they would be.
Lieut. -Col. Ciuff. division inspector of
r tie practice, speaking of tlie new regula
tions, said tfi^l he \va.- under the impres
s.on that they are too severe and that
tlisy have a tendency to discourage men
who under other circumstances would be
come good, if not first-class, marksmen.
"What ought to be done, 11 said the inspec
tor, "is to encourage men tv become com
petent in the use of the rifles. Yon cer
t*in!y cannot encourage them if you tell
them that if they do not, at the State shoot
at I^oo yards score fifteen, they will be
barred from trying their skill at 30J yards
and, of course, that bars them from shoot
ing at the 500-yard range. When the rule
wi.s that a man mv t m.ake 60 to â  mitle
him to a bar. if he only made 29 the first
time and made 3l the next time tie got
hiÂ« bar and that encouraged him to try
and do better the next time, but under
the new rules if a man does not make the
requisite fifteen there is no use for him to
try again. That I believe will prove very
discouraging."
"Then ttiere is a regulation for skirmish
firing, but no provision is made for a
range, and at present," continued the in
spector, "1 know of no place where the
companies of San Francis-cu can indulge
in such practiceexcept at San Bruno. The
fctate has m.-ide no appropriation for such
a contingency and does not provide for
transportation. Now, the men do rot go
on such practice for their own pleasure,
bu for the benefit of the service, and it is
rathtr hard that they should be called
.upon for 80 cent-" each lor fare out of their
own pockets. It seems to me that the
State should prov.de transportation on
such occasions."
There are others in the guard who are
of the opinion that the new rules will be
v ry oppressive and will not accomplish
the desired results. They hold that bUch
â rules would uo in the regular army, but
they will not work satisfactorily in the
National guard for the reason that the
ii!Â»-n have not the same opportunities for
â rifle practice tiiot the men in the regular
service have.
For a lime there was quite an opposi
tion in the several companies of the guard
against any proposition to house all ihe
companies under one roof, but recently
a change ha* come over the guardsmen,
.and now there is a movement in almost
every company to agitate a movement for
a general armory in which the troop, trie
signal corp and the infantry could have
spacious and comfortable quarters.
On New Year's eve the members of
Companies C and G, Fimt Infantry, held
trx.-ir annual reunion at the St. Germain,
where they partook of a hue dinner, bid
the old year adieu and welcomed the new.
There were present a large membership
and a lew of the ex-members of the Na
tional-. Among these were Colonel Jerry
Moore, Lieutenant McMinn, Major Til
den, Captain Le Breton, Captain "Wood
ruff and Lieutenant Ruddock. Captain
Drum bell ot Company 0 was master of
ceremonies and during the evening offered
a number of toasts which were responded
to in a happy vein, and when the tin
horns were blowing and the bells ringing
in the glad new year, the soldier boys
parted, tilled with tfood resolutions for the
new year that had come.
The members of Company F, Captain
Wilier, held open house in the armory on
Ellis street on New Year's eve, and there
was a jolly lot of callers. As time grew the
reception resolved itself into a high jinks
and smoker, rfhd there was a merry time
for ali.under the siresbip of Captain Miller.
A good programme of mu^ic, song and elo
cution was presented and the various num-
Ders were warmly applauded.
During the second meeting this month,
of Companies C and G of the First Regi
ment the bars won at the state shoot, and
the prizes that were won at other shoots,
will be distributed 10 those entitled to
them.
Colonel Mac Donald, commanding the
First Infantry, will leave shortly for the
East, to be absent for a few weeks, and
duri-ng his absence the command will de
volve upon Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce.
A FIERCE URSA MINOR.
It Gets Liose and Terrorizes
the Trocadero Vegetable
Colony.
Noted Bear Hunters With Assorted-
S z*d Dfgs Beat the Jungles
in Vain.
Last night the vegetable garden colony
around Trocadero barricaded their doors
and lay in their bouses with bated
breath. Not a turnip was turned-up out
of the ground and not a cabbage-head
stirred from its natal bed, and all because
a fierce four-month-old bearâ aa U rsus
furioso â was adrift on the hills.
Even the policemen, who, of course,
would not forsake their lamp-post where
the electric flam^ broke up the gloom for
a few feet around, showed a tendency to
take to the trees at the movement of every
shadow. It was a night of terror in large
type.
Last Saturday M. Schneider, a saloon
keeper near the Ingleside racetrack, ac
companied by several friends, went down
to the Trocadero for a visit, and took his
cub bear along. The juvenile cinnamon
is as jovial as a kitten, and lie highly
amused bis companions with his ar.tics
till the beer which they gave him made
him dull.
Then he was tied out in the backyard,
where the "steam" he had quaffed could
evaporate.
He evidently evaporated with if. lor
when Ernest Dolter, proprietor of the Troc
adero,went out to attend to his four-footed
guest the chewed end ot a rope was all that
indicated a bear had ever been there.
Then there was mounting in hot haste
and a chase through the gum-groves was
begun. All Saturday night they hunted
bear without success. Yesterday morning
the search was recommenced. All of the
ex-srizzly trappers, Indian fighters and
path-finders generally assembled at the
Trocadero and gave personal histories of
their adventures among the fierce carni
vera of the wilds.
They brought dogs of assorted sizes,
from the rat-terrier to the Great Dane,
more or less loaded for bear.
A policeman in citizen's dress â he left
his official gear at home, he said, fearing
that the cub would shy into the woods at
the sight of nis star â was bitten by a bull
terrier which somehow associated him witn
thÂ° bear.
General James and Colonel Chad bourne
arrived, with the crowd and it looked as
though the days of liberty of that ursus
were numbered. General James had a
combination dog â a sort of composite ca- |
nine â that boasted of an ancestry of bear- I
killers running back to Noah's floating
menagerie. â¢
While the hunters were modestly di
lating on the prowess ot their respective
dogs the general's descendant of the bear
killers went out to snuff up a passing ac
quaintance with Dolter s pet coon, and
got his nose chewed off.
The agonizing yelps of the dog brought
out the whole company to his rescue, and
when the coon was persuaded to retire to
his corner the ceneral's pet took a bee
line for town, fiving off a howl at every
jump.
Colonel Chadbourne had a huge mastiff
that was not a tighter, he said, but could
track a gull through a fogbank. All that
was needed was to show the sa acious ani
mal something the bear had worn and that
dog would be off on the scent as unerring
as a bloodhound.
The only thine they could find was the
hole the cub had worn through the ruÂ«tic
fence while wiggling Uirough to freedom,
but that was enough and the dog was
shown the place. He smelt of the locality
and then slunk under the house and no
persuasive calling could induce him to
leave his retreat.
All day the hunters beat up the jungle,
but no bear was found, and whpn their
flasks were dry they returned to Dolter'?,
satisfied that the bear had made his way
south and was well toward the Mexican
line.

Fhot hard and carefully for the honors
that go with a place in the First Regi
ment team of 100 men *bo are to compete
with the Hawaiian national Guard for a
trophy.
This match will take place next Sunday.
The National Guard of California is to
suoot at Shell Mound and the islanders at
their range near Honolu'u. Each team
will have a representative at the other's
range, and the official scores will be ex
cnanged by the next steamers. Every
marksman is to shoot ten shots on the
200-yard range, off-hand, with the regula
tion musket.
Tbe First Regiment team was selected
Beveral weeks ago and since then the
majority have been practicing faithfully
to keep up their average. This was what
called so many across the bay yesterday.
TLe light and the absence ot' wind were
favorable for good shooting, but the cold
air numbed the fingers so sadly that tbe
mark-men were baaiy handicapped and
this may account for many of the poor
scores that were made.
Rifle Inspector L. Barrere had his bands
full looking after the men to see that the
best did all in their power to keep up the
average, as yesterday was the last day for
competition practice. To-day the selec
tion of tlie team will be made. At the
first selection the 115 highest were chosen,
100 for the team and fifteen for alternates. ,
Aside from tbe practice yesterday's com
petition was to select the regular team.

One of the largest hails in Pythian
Castle, 909>Â£ Market street, was filled to
the doors last evening, ihe occasion being
a meeting of the American brancti of the
Socialist Labor party, at which Professor
Edward W. Ross of Leland Stanford Uni
versity v.as the principal speaker. Wil
liam Costley presided, and Oiiva Everett
and George Aspden gave recitations and
readings.
Professor Ross, who is the instructor in
economics at the university, took for his
subject, "Evolution of Enjoyment." He
held up the idea that the people of to-day
have the means of enjoying themselves
more than the ancients, and that the
present situation has, indeed, a more
cheerful outlook than in the past.
The tall professor said that the present
trend of pleasure is more esthetic and
beautiful tnan in the past and is looking
more to the spiritual than to the sensual.
To illustrate his point he called attention
to the bioody amusements of Rome and to
the pleasures of the barbarous tribes
whose greatest enjoyment is eating and
drinking to excess and idling away their
time.
The tendency of modern civilization, he
continued, is to the better. Instead of
brutal sports we have a greater appre
ciation for music, literature, scenery,
picture galleries. Gladiatorial battles
have given way to football, lawn tennis
and tug-of-war matches. People are more
social and enjoy music recitals, lecture?,
etc., while formerly their enjoyment was
selfish, the greatest pleasure being possess
ion of wealth and a display of tine raiment
and houses.
Professor Ross contended that pleasure
is b coming cheaper than formerly. Once
it was rated as a great thing tQ have and
rÂ»de in a carriage. Now hundreds own
buggies and this shows that the caste
lines are not so severely drawn. The less
wealthy can enjoy some of the pleasures
of tneir wealthier brothers. In fact democ
racy permits a closer approach of the
yarous classes to each other.
The very demand for things out of the
reach of the poorer classes brings to them
cheaper articles of the desired kind,
and the distribution is much larger and
I the means of enjoyment are thus in-
I creased.
According to the custom at these meet
ings, tbose in the audience are permitted
to ask questions and make brief addresses
on the subject under consideration.
The questions asked and remarks made
by a number of socialists showed a wide
difference between the Stanford profess
or's theories and the work-a-day laborer's
exneriences. One of the latter began by
asking now the thousands of over-worked
laborers can enjoy the cstnetic pleasures
of music, picture gallerie3, carriages and
literature spoken of by Professor Ross.
When a man labors like a slave from
e.ght to sixteen hours a day for just
enough to keep bo<!y and soul together he
is well satisfied 10 sleep, in order to be
prepared for the next day's toil.
"Out on the hill* near here," he re
sumed, "are hundreds of men in a grad
ing camp, wording from sunrise to sunset.
In their boarding-house the tin plates are
nailed to the 1 1 hie, and the knives and
forks are fastened witn chains. The dish
washer washes the dishes by turning a
stream from a hose on the table instead of
applying hot water and soap.
"How can men working under such cir
cumstances be expected to appreciate en
joyment, evolutea or otherwise? Car
riages, book?, literature, music or art gal
leries are closed to them. Moreover t.e
cheap editions mentioned are the result of
cheap labor, the cheap garments arc the
product of the sweat-shops, and cheap car
riages represent underpaid iabor."
Professor Ross suggested that if these
would keep out of saloons and buy less
beer their condition might not be so bad,
to which another socialist answered that
the mote a man saved even Â©n beer the
more he would have to contribute to the
capitalist, who is ever ready, upon seeing
evidence of thrift upon the part of the
laboring classe?, to cut wages.
It is no wonder that the workingman
seek* to stupe ly his brain with drink and
to drown his cares and fears. It is to alter
this condition of affairs and so place the
laboring man socially and otherwise that
he will have confidence in himself and in
the future that socialism is striving.
A Great Shot.
The Duke of Ma akhoff was at a battue
at Sirathtieldsay and shut nothing, much
to his disgust, and when the day was over
it appealed that he would be extremely
put out unless be was allowed or enabled
to kill something. So, in spite of all the
gamekeeper could think, feel op say, a
pheasant was procured, tied by its leg to
tLie top of a post, and Malakhoff was put
some thirty yards off with a double-bar
reled Kun. It was ju prosed that he would
thereupon and thence take two shots
at the bird. Not a bit of it; he loaded
both barrels, walked close up to the pheas
ant, put the muzz c close to him and dis
charged both barrels into him, with "He!
coquin." The next day the Duke of Wel
lington told the keeper that Malaklu ff
was a great man, who had smoked to death
50 Arab men, women and children in a
cave; to which the gamekeeper replied:
"Like enough, your Grace; he'd be capa
ble of anything."â Letters of Lord Black
ford.
JOSEPH MURPHY
HAS LA GRIPPE
The Irish Comedian Con
fined to Bed at the
Occidental.
All His Company Coughing and
Sneezing â Result of a
Northern Tour.
The Star Hcpes to Bj Able to Ga On
With the Performance To-Night.
Disappointed Portland.
Joseph Murphy, the Irigh character
actor, arrived with his company from the
North yesterday morning and Mr. Mur
phy himself went directly to bed at the
Occidental and remains there. He is suf
fering from a severe attack of grip, con
tracted at Spokane, Wash., and it is very
doubtful if he will be able to go on the
stage to-night. He is attended by Dr.
Luke Robinson, who thinks' it possible
tljat he may be in condition to meet bis
engagement at the Columbia, but is by no
means certain about it. The company
had to cut Portland out of tneir itinerary
on account of the star's illness when they
readied that city.
They were Dilied for two nights and a
matinee tbere after their date at Tacoma,
but, "although the manager kicked," said
Mr. Sheehan, a member of the company,
"they had only to look at Joe, and they
threw up their hands."
The whole company is coughing and
wheezing as the result of their run through
the Northwest, but Mr. Murphy has it
bad, and for a little time was supposed to
be in a rather critical condition. How
ever, that is passed, and it is deemed a
matter of a few days only when he will be
himself again.
"We came out over the Northern
Pacific," said Mr. Murphy last evening
between wheeziag and coughing. "All
through Dakota and Montana the ther
mometer was away down, cold as blazes,
but everybody feeling fine, we playing the
big houses. When we crossed the Rockies,
however, and got down to Spokane, we
found the people suffering from a phe
nomenon in the maiter of weatherâ a
dark, thick fog, through which you
couldn't see across the street. In the
midst of it there was a sort of drizzling
rain. It hung over the ciiy all the while
we were there and they said it had
occurred nightly fur a week previous to
our arrivalâ a thing never seen there
before. Well, I began roughing and grew
worse right along until I had lo give up at
Portland.
"I regretted that exceedingly. " he con
tinued. "I had been anticipating with
pleasure appearine in that city, for it was
in Portland that I made my hrst appear
ance as a star thirtv-tbree years a.ao. I
have nevjr been there since. It is not
hard to under-taud, therefore, what in
terest I felt in appearing there at this
time. MyÂ»appearance there was in a play
called 'Born to Good Luck.' and I may
say that from that time to date â this date
excepted, uerhaps â I have never had
anything but good luck. In all these
years of uninterrupted touring the coun
try I have never missed an engagement
until that at I'ortland, the return to ivy
starting point."
"Yes, sir," remarked W. T. Sheehan, as
his chiet paused to cough a while, "I have
been % ith Joe for eleven years, and in that
time notwithstanding all the storms and
floods and accidents by water and rail that
people constantly on the road must meet,
we have never until now failed to keep
our dates. It is rather remarkable, come
to think of it."
"Yes, I am essentially a San Fran
ciscan," said Murphy in answer to the
question. "I came here in 1852. No, I
wasn't on the stage then; I was a mere
roustabout. I went to the stage in variety
and burnt cork business at Gilbert's Melo
deon and the Bella Union. I was with
Burbank & Backus' Minstrels at Maguire's
Opera- bouse, then on Washington street,
near Montgomery.
"I rttny say that it was The Call that
led me into Irish character lines. A bene
fit was given to old Billy Chapman at the
New Idea, and in a play called 'Irish As
surance and Yankee Modesty' I took the
Irish character and Caroline Chapman
the opposite part. The next morning,
entirely unsolicited and unexpected. The
Call gave me a column, advising me to
give over the burnt-cork business and go
in for Irish character parts. I took the
advice to heart, began to look about for a
play and determined to try my luck a* a
star in 'Born to Good Luck.' My success
was such that I went right along from
that lime.
"The play in which I have succeeded
beat is 'Kerry Go Â«â¢.' I have played it con
stantly for iwenty-three years. No other
play has such a record. And the wonder
of it is that it is as popular to-day in all
the large cities as it ever was. We have
just come from Chicago, where the
orchestra had to be put under the stage.
Packed to the doors nieht after night. It
is so in all the lanre cities, from Boston to'
Cincinnati ana Philadelphia and Pitts
burg to St. Paul. 'Shaun Rhne' is not so
oil by but two years, and remains equally
long-livei and popular."
Mrs. Murphy did not take the northern
route, butcaruo here direct a month a o,
and tins been at the Occidental awaiting
her husband's arrival, and since then has
been his attentive iinrse.
A CURIOUS CASE.
Forgnry Committed for the Saka of
Practicing; Joke*.
Lacaussade. the amiable septuagenarian
in charge of the library of the Senate, ssys
a Paris correspondent, whose alleged mar
riage was lately announced by a hoaxer,
has a long list ot grievances against the
mysterious person who continues to trou
ble h;s tranquility. The tormentor, who
can copy the style and the handwriting of
M. Lacnussade, recently made the latter a
candidate for academical Honors. The
librarian hap, in fact, written a volume of
verse, and haÃ translated the works of
the Italian poet nn.l pessimist, Leopardi.
On another occasion the hoaxer wrote to a
Milan publisher, asking him to send to
M. Laraus-ade all the books in Italian
about Leopardi's life and works. *
The volumes duly arrived at the Senate,,
and were followed some days afterward by
1000 kilos of anthracite coal from the gas
company, a grand piano from a boulevard
music-shon, a dinner for Bevrral guests
Irom a noted cook's, two dozen of type
writers for the Senate and heaps of miscel
laneous articles from business firms. The
librarian had a L-oott deal of trouble in per
suading the tradesmen who forwarded
him the goods that he had never ordered
them. The hoaxer also sent some verses
in M. Lacaiissaile's name to a leading re
view, in which they were inserted. The
tormentor will now probably remain
quiet for a time, as strict investigations
are being made for the purpose of dis
covering hi-i personality. M. Lsicaussade
Das made a collection of ali the letters
sent to people i.. his name by the joke
monger, who, he believes, is attached in
some capacity to the Senate.

IHL CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. ~~
Now for politics.
Kverybody has an eye on Sacramento.
A seat in the Cabinet for California is
in sight and almost in reach.
The Senate has now its last opportunity
to lock horns with Cleveland and do
him ud.
There are abundant signs that we are to
have a new era in politics as well as in
business.
It is said that over 18,000 deer have
been killed in the woods of Maine Â»thiÂ«
year, but it took more than 50,000 hunters
to do it.
At last we get the welcome news that
Tom Watson has decided to retire from
politics. The new era is evidently dawn
ing everywhere.
Some of the Senators may have been
recreating themselves during the holidays,
but most of them were undoubtedly writ

Jhe coercion of the Sultan will con
tinue to be the biggest drama on the Eu

will be a farce or a tragedy remains to be
seen.
If the Cubans and Spaniards are left
alone much longer there wqu'i bn a man

husbands.
If California gains a representative in
the Cabinet and sends to the Senate a
stanch, stalwart, brainy Republican she
will have a prestige at Washington sec
ond to none of her sister States.
There is a great deal of work awaiting
the law-maker 3 at Sacramento, and for
tunately among the legislators Ihere are
many men who can be counted on to at
tend to it faithfully and do it rightly.
In Cambridge, Mass., there are no sa
loons licensed and yet the police during
ttie past year arrested over 1500 persons
for drunkenness. It will take a Harvard
graduate to explain the logic of the situ
ation.
The call for a mothers' congress, to be
held at Washington, has been met by a
counter call for a fathers' congress. The
next step in this development will De a

From the work achieved last year the
Merchants' Association can draw abund
ant confidence for the prosecution of the
work which ia to come. It has now
proven its usefulness and will have plenty
of people to help it.
A St. Louis Judge recently declared
from the bench that there has not been
in that city in ten years a policeman who

A wild goose recenty joined the flock
kept by the city on a lake in Garfield Park

According to the New Yortf Sun Con

The Supreme Court of Missouri has
just decided that a clause in the charter of
Kansas City imposing a penalty upon
every qualified voter who fails to vote at

another reform scheme goes a-glimmering.

Henry Watterson says that after retir
. ing from the Presidency Cleveland should
sit quietly '"liKe a statue of liaddha with
folded hands contemplating the pit of his

clearly overlooked the fact that Grover
has a much bigger pit than that to con
template.
It is said that the basis of all our rela
tion-with Spain is an oid treaty ratified
in 1795. It has beer. addeJ to from time
to time by protocols, conventions, etc.,
but the origftiai remains as the main
treaty, and it is said to be so antiquated
that tbe State Department of neither
country understands it.
The fact that thi3- country, after an
existence of more than a century, has not
yet cecided whether the President or
Congress has the decisive voice in recog
nizing the independence of a foreign
State shows hew easy it is for millions of
intelligent people to live under a written
constitution without knowing what it
means.
THE STATE LEGISLATOR
The State Legislature will be called to
order to-day for ths work of its thirty
second session by the selection of its offi
cers, the appointment o*f its committees
and the introduction of its first batch of
bills.
That the present session of the Legisla
ture will be one of the most important in
the recent history of California no one
who has examined a list of its members
or considered its already outlined duties
can possess a doubt. From every section
of the State have been gathered its best
qualified and most popular ,'citizens to
form the present Legislature. They have
been elected as the result of a campaign
in the close contests cf which only men of
merit could win.
The present Legislature, therefore, not
only represents in a peculiar sense the
peode of California, but is also to an un
usual degree the possessor of their confi
dence. The quality of its constituent
membership is an assurance that this con
fidence will be neither disappointed nor
abused and that the present Legislature
will, during the next sixty days, distin
guish itself by faithful, honest work well
and intelligently performed.
The first and one of the most important
functions of this Legislature will be the
election of a United States Senator who
shall serve the people of California and
of the Nation at Washington during the
next six years. The political complexion
of the Legislature is an assurance that
the selected Senator will be a Republican.
The quality of the Republican memters
of the Legislature is a furtfcer assurance
that the choice of a Senator will be made
with care and tnat the gentleman upon
whom that high honor may fall will, in
the eminence of his character and abilities,
in his unselfish devotion to the cause of
Republicanism, in his high aspirations
to serve California and all her people, be a
Senator of whom our Co.mmon wealth, with
out regard to party, shall have increasing
reason to be proud.
While the work of choosing a Senator is
progressing the other important duties of
the Legislature will get under way. The
reference of the work of the Code Commis
sion to the proper committees, the intro
duction of bills aimed at such an amend
ment of the irrigation laws as shall
cause them to give general satisfac
tion, the consideration of measures affect
ing the Railroad Commission and made
necessary in view of the recent decision
of the Federal court, the passage of laws
in the interests of the mining industry,
the formulation of a statute placing the
insane asylums of the State under the
control of a commission, and the probable
reorganization of the judicial system of
California, in order that the wheels of
justice may be accelerated, are among
the many matters which will occupy the
attentio" of the Legislature. With all
of these measures and with the many
others which will arise during the session,
the Senate and Assembly has each men
of ample power and character to honestly
and ably deal. The people of California
may therefore rest assured tnat the pres
ent legislative session will bs a credit to
the State in the extent of its service and
in the honesty and ability with which its
important and grave duties will be dis
charged.
We feel confident that each and all of
the members of both Houses will be at
tached to the sublime truth, expressed by
the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln,
that this is "a government of the people,
by the people and for the people."
THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
The Merchants' Association Review for
January gives an altogether too brief re
view of the important work accomplished
by the association during the past year.
We can well understand that the members
of the organization prefer to let others ex
alt the good deeds it has achieved, but at
the same time the Review would have ren
dered a service to the City if it had set
forth an elaborate statement of the work
of the year as an illustration of what can
be done for the general good by the united
efforts of public-spirited men.
The counsel embodied in the words "Let
your light shine before men" has its va.ue
in civic affairs as well as in those of the
church. The Call and other papers of
the City nave given daily an account of the
progressive improvements made by the as
sociation and lostered by its influence, but
that does not fulfill ail that could be done
to make the work known by a complete
summary of it. Such a summary it would
not be brageing too much for the Review
to make, and certainly the record would
be one of winch all citizens could be proud.
A bare intimation of the more import
ant work accomplished by the association
can be gained from the brief paragraph in
which it is summed up. The lieview says:'
Three years ago the Merchants' Association
inaugurated a plan of keeping the streets
clean; now, that system has come to stay.
Eighteen months ago the association decioed
upon better lighting for our thoroughfares;
now, each artery vies with the other in
tha number of brilliant arc lights. A year
ego the Merchants' Association secured
bitumiuous pavement on Kearny street and
started the agitation for repaying many cob
bled blocks; now, both the City and property
owners have determined upon smooth modern
pavements and the cobble will soon be a muse
um curiosity. â¢ * * Since the birth of the
Merchants' Association in 1894, twenty-five
district improvement clubs and fifteen street
improvement associations have been createa.
It is gratifying to learn that an im
proved sewer system is regarded by the
association as the next problem to solve.
We thoroughly agree with the Review that
"with its solution will come untold bless
ings to this metropolis." The worn is in
deed one of pressing nrzency and no time
should be Jost in setting about the task of
accomplishing it. From the past successes
of the association we can draw good augu
ries of success in this enterprise also and
will look for its beginning with hope and
confidence.
With such proofs before them of the
usefulness of the association, no progress
ive citizen should require urging to join
the organization and assist in its further
labors. It should be regarded as a privi
lege to be a member of so important a
civic body. Let all who have the Interests
of the City at heart co-operate wiih the
association and it will havo sufficient
strength to achieve so much in the way of
municipal improvement that all hitherto
done will be accounted as but a begin
ning.
THE BRUSSELS EXPOSITION.
Among the more important enterprises
which will engage the attention of ourjpro
gressive men during the present year will
be that of providing lor an adequate rep
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 189 T.
resentation of the industries of California
ai the Brussels Exposition, which opens
this spring. Preparations for making the
display are of course already Well ad
vanced by the State Board of Trade, and
hearty co-operation should be given by all
who have the means to do so.
The trade of Belgium is well worth bid
ding for, even if the entrance of our good 3
into her markets ended there and did not
lead to an acquaintance with them and a
demand for them elsewhere. A statement
recently made by the United State 3 Com
missioners for the exposition makes that
much plain. Accoming to that statement
the exports and imports of Belgium for
1595 are shown by statistics to have been
of a value exceeding $1,0(54,000,000. This
includes merchandise in triinsitanil proves
the important place held by Belgium as a
commercial entrance to Europe.
The value of foreign goods consumed by
Belgium during the year amounted to
$324,317,200. Of the total trade of the
country the United States has less than 8
per cent, and this notwithstanding; the
fact that Belgium's leading imports â
grams, raw textiles, building woods, etc. â
sre products that the United States is es
pecially well able to supply.
The importance of maKing a good ex
hibit is strengthened by the fact that our
trade with Belgium has actually dimin
ished of late. There has been a heavy
falling off in Belgium purchases from this
country of Hour, cotton and living ani
mals. The exposition offers us an oppor
tunity to recover the trade which has
been lost, and also to extend that of
canned goods of aJI kinds, dried fruits and
wines.
The Commissioners point out that the
conservativism of European p oples is such
that we can obtain their trade only by
carrying our goods to their country and
showing them under favorable conditions.
International expositions offer the best of
opportunities for doing that, and the one
which is to be held at Brussels is there
fore a cbance which no part of the United
States, and particulary California, can
afford to lose.
THE VICTOEIAN EEA.
Among the features of ti<e celebrations
to be held in Great Britain this year in
honor of the longest reign in British
annals, that which will have most interest
to the world at large is the proposed "Vic
torian age exhibition," which is designed
to make v display of the world's pro ress
during the period of the reign of the
present Queen.
To make the exhibition more impress
ive, it is the intention to establish in every
industry a series of contrasts between the
products of that industry at the time of
Victoria's accession and the products of
the present day. In every portion of the
exposition, therefore, there will be shown
the old wny and the new. The visitor will
see how the world lived in 1837, as well as
how it lives In 1897. Such an exhibition
will be instructive as well as interesting,
and will unquestionably be the most im
portant feature of the celebrations for the
year.
The exhibition 13 to be divided into
ek'ht sectionsâ line arts, historical and
commemorative, dramn, music, economic,
5c entilif, commercial and industrial, and
woman's work. The last department of
the exhibit will be in itself an evidence of
how much the world has changed since
Victoria came to the throne. It would
burdly have entered the bemads of the
directors of any kind of an exhibition in
1837 to give recognition to women to any
thing like the extent of providing a
special department for the display of
their accomplishments.
It will be intfresiing to see in which of
these various sections the contract exhib
i;ed between the old and the new will be
most striking. It is not likely that in art,
drama and music much advance will be
shown, but in the depar'ments of science,
industry, econom a and commerce there
will be displayed an advance which will
amount to a veritable revolution. Unless
the connecting links between the old and
the new are displayed in the exposition, it
will seem to the observer as if a new race
of men instead of a new generation had
come into the world within the last sixty
years.
The developments of recent progress
are such that it is time for our historians
to make a new division of the world's his
tory. The old distinctions into ancient
times, the middle ages and modern times
no longer Buifices. The change between
the condition of the world to-day and that
of sixty years ago is greater than the
change which occurred in the sixteenth
century and separated what is called
modern from medieval times. The world
has been completely revolutionized men
tally, morally, politically and industrially.
The Napoleonic era marks a red dividing
line between our time and those which
preceded it and the accomplishments of
the Victorian era have carried us into an
environment so widely different that we
live in what is almost altogether a new
world.
COAST EXCHANGES.
C. W. Hainan has disposed of his interest in
the Santa Clara Journal to his partner, N. H.
Downing. The Journal is a well-managed,
conservative newspaper and ia an index to the
prosperous condition of one of the most beau
tiful towns ot the State.
A year ago Editor Montgomery of the An
tioch Ledger reduced the price of his paper
from $2 50 to $1 50 per annum. He has now
shoved the price batik to the former figure,
and this leads the Martinez Kews to remark
that "any well-conducted country newspaper
is well worth $2 50 and cannot be published
for less."
Editor Falrweather of the Reedley Exponent
is an example of the desirable kiud of a citi

three hours' trial on December 1.
The armor for the three new battle-ships of
the Canopseo class, to be begun e*ny this

begun at the Portsmouth yard January 27,
1896, was launched December" B, und will be
ready for sea in liiteen months hence.
Holland is about to reorganize and greatly
increase its navy. The sum ol $33,750,000 is
to be expended for the construction of the fol
lowing classes of vessels: Twelve protected
cruisers of 23-knot speed, six armored vessels
of 3400 toi.s, fifteen gunboats, six monitors,
fifteen torpedo-boat destroyers and sixteen tor
pedo-boats.
A floating dock for Havana is being built In
England. It will be 450 leet iv length, 82
feet wide and allow a draught of 27 feet 6
inches and will be capable of lifting 10,000
tons dead weight in two and a half hours.
The structure isof steel and is to be completed
iv eleven months at a cost of $575,000, when it
will be towed to its destination.
Lord BeresforO's proposition to rearm some
of the older armored ship 6 in the navy, which
still carry muzzle-loading guns, is meeting
with favor from the British Admiralty. There
are six turret ships and ten central battery
ships carrying batteries of muzzle-loading
guns, ranging from 16 inches down to 8 inches,
which, with modern ordnance, can be made
very effective ships.
The naval expenditures of France, Russia
and England, In proportion to their tonnage
of shipping, are $45 per ton for r ranee, $60
for Russia and only $7 50 for England. This
comparatively insignificant outlay on the
British navy forms the basis of demand for
greater outlay on the navy by her statesmen,
who believe that in a struggle England will
be saved by her navy rather than by coalition
with foreign powers.
The estimated cost of the several classes of
ships for the navy of Holland is as follows:
Cruisers of 3900 tons and 23 knots speed,
$1,288,500; ar:ftored coast defense vesaei,
3400 ions and 20-knot speed, $1,528,800 ; gun

RESTORING, iHE MERCHANT MA

Washington Times.
Every statesman in the country agrees with
every other statesman that ihe shipping trade
of the Urtited States ought to he built up again.
They all concur that it ii a shame that iho
American flag has practically disappeared
from the seas. Unless seen floating from the
masiheÂ«d of some American man-of-war it is
a rare spectacle in foreign ports. It was differ
ent once. Tne time was when the American
merchant marine outnumbered even Great
Britain's, when our clipper ships wore seen
everywhere, nnd when American exports and
imports were carried in American bottom*.
It is the saddest kind of commentary upon our
shipping Ihws to think thut the marvelous
progress the world haÂ« made in ship-building,
and with the constantly Increasing evidence
that the United States can beat the world in
construction of thÂ» fastest of vessels of mod
ern kind, this country should stand at the foot
of the list in respect of the size of its mer
chant marine.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
E. Bengas, a well-known business man of
Eureka, Cal., where he is stationed and repre
sents several large wholesale houses of this
City, ig on a business trip here. He predicts
marked improvements in the near future ior
his town.
"The large lumber manufacturers feel jubi
lant over an increased demand for redwood
from foreign markets," he said, "and with a
similar improvement in the domestic markets
all the mills will be in operation in the spring.
The winter so far has been remarkably favor
able to dairymen. All the creamer.es in the
county are turning out tons of golden butter,
which brings the top prices in the San Fran
cisco market. Notwithstanding the great de
pression of business which has existed and is
existing, we have had no failures, and I must
say the merchants are never dilatory on col
lection days. Our business men are conserva
tive and cautious and the population is not
a Homing one as in other sections of the State.
'â¢The recent storm in our harbor, where two
break-waters are in course of construction,
was very disastrous. However the contractors
feel sure of success in the great undertaking
and will renew their work with more activity
in the spring. Take it all in all our county is
in as healthy a condition as any in the State,
with brieht prospects in the near future. We
have homes for a million oi people and our
population is only 30,000."

GERMAN CITIES.
â  , "â -'. '
American: Ignorance of 'llwir Growth
and Progress.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
"Municipal Housekeeping," as a science and
an art, evolved out of the conditions of life
prevailing in the last half of the nineteenth
century, can for various reasons be observed
to better advantage In Germany than in any
other country. German cities, having fairly
entered upon the task' of providing themselves
with modern conveniences and improvements,
are accomplishing it in a more systematic,
thorough and business-like manner than any
other cities, whether in Europe, America or
Australia. To this work of modern improve
ments the Germans seem to have brought
more of the scientific spirit and method than
any other people. Their habits of thorough
ness in research and of patient, exhaustive
treatment of any subject in hand have fully
characterized their new progress in tpe arts of
civilized life.
The words of the foregoing paragraph are
taken as they stand from the opening chapter,
page 289, of Albert Shaw's masterly survey of
municipal government in Germany, occupy
ing the second half of his invaluable book on
"Municipal Government in Europe," and I
most earnestly commend this book to our
public-spirited citizens who are studying the
subject oi municipal government with a view
to the adoption of a new and progressive char
ter for San Francisco. In the limited space
alloted me here it is my present purpose to try
to open the eyes of American ignorance to the
fact that we are In our most advanced cities
lagging far behind the progress made in
German municipal government, for I still
hope that we shall lay aside our conceit and
try to learn the lessons taught by the work
dove in European cities.
Mr. Shaw assigns a plausible reason for our
singular ignorance of the progress made in
European municipal government: "Tne
guide-bonks are al. made on the supposition
that American tourists are painfully eager to
see evÂ«ry tning of antiquarian or historical in
terest ana thai they care nothing whatever for
Europe as the present-day home of progressive
peoples, and we fail to appreciate the force
and significance of the immense modern im
petus that is transforming the European
cities. Most of them have an ancient or me
dieval nucleus, but otheru he they are as new
a-, our American cities, and in many respects
they are more modern and enterprising. In
deed, there seems to be an almost unconquer
able delusion in ihe popular mind thai our
American cities are the only ones which show
the phenomenon of rapid growth, and that
their newness excuses their failure to provide
well for the common necessities ot urban life."
Inorder to try to disjiÂ«l this almost univer
sal delusion Mr. Shaw devotes nearly four
pages to an exceedingly interesting compari
son between ;orty-two German and Americau
cities of nearly cquai population, from which
I select a few. In 1870 New York had a popu
lation of nearly 950,000, while Berlin had
bare;y 800,000. In 1880 Berlin had outgrown
New York and was still ahead in 1890, having
1,578,794 to New York's 1.&15.301: and Berlin
in the past twenty-five years has added us
many actual new residents as hns Chicago,
phenomenal as the growth of Chicago has
been. Mr. Shaw next compares Hamburg and
Bos toil. In 1875 Hamburg hud 348.000 popu
lation and Boston had 342,000. In 1890 Ham
burg hart 509,260 and Boston 448.000. a gain
in fifteen years of 200,000 for Hamburg and
100,000 for Boston. Baltimore is sometimes
likened for wealth and prosperity to Hamburg.
In the early seventies they were of equal size,
In 1890 Hamburg had 509,200 and Baltimore
434 439. Leinsic had 127,000 population In
1875 and in 1890 it had 355,000. "It has now
well distanced San Francisco, which was con
siderably the larger in the seventies," Mr.
Shaw remarks. At the close of his forty-two
comparisons he says: "If the ligures were re
vised to extend tho comparison to the year
1895 the exhibition of swift trrowth in the
German cities would appear still more remark
able."
i feel constrained to give the concluding
paragraph entire on this subject, (or Mr. Shaw
shows so much candor and clearness in It that
he is entitled to bo heard: "When one ven
tures to suggest that the American cities are
meagerly provided with the best modern fa
cilites and make but a sorry snow in com
parison with Kuftfpeau cities thero comes the
unfailing reply that onrs are in their infancy,
while those of Europe are venerable with age
and rich in the accumulations of a long
realized maturity. The existence of old
churches and castles and of vaiiouj monu
ments and collections illustrating the history
of art has given the impression rtiat European
cities ars old. But for the purposes of our
discussion they are younger than their Ameri
can counterparts. Their cit zens are not
nearly as rich as those in our cities. They
suffer under the disadvantages of loss ii. the
productive energy and wealth through emi
gration of hundreds of thousands of their best
young men after they have reared aud edu
cated them.
"They stagcer under such heavy burdens of
taxation and compulsory service to maintain
the military mm of the general government
that the tax increment which can be spared
for municipal purposes comes with pain and
is small compared with the revenues we can
raise for local outlay in America, where taxes
for National and State purposes are compar
atively light. And yet, in the lace of disad
vantages far greater "than we can present as
excuses, the German cities have grappled with
the new municipal problems of the last quar
ter of a century and have solved them far
more promptly and completely than the Amer
ican cities have done."
At another time I propose to give some in
formation as to the way in which these Ger
man cities have solved the municipal prob
lems which most concern our own people, as
presented in this sterling work on "Municipal
Government in Europe," by Albert Shaw.

LADYS APRON
This useful garment speaks for itself. An
apron large enough to be of use and trimmed
as this is, need not have its "raison d'etre"
pointed out. For every rough work enameled
cloth or rubber are used.
Denim or blue jeans make a heavy apron that
will last indefinitely.
Ginghams, heavy cambric or cotton duck are
serviceable materials.
Made of lawn, cambric or batiste it
forms a garment much appreciated by ladies
whose only household cares consist of light

A NEW YEAS BERMOIT.
The Advice Given by Rev. Dr. Spalding
t â¢ liis Congregation.
Yesterday morning the Rev. Dr. Spald
;ng of St. John's Episcopal Cburch
preached a sermon on "The Beginning of
the New Year." He said that at such a
time there always conies the thought of
responsibility, of giving an account of
ourselves to God. Any good business
man would not think of letting the new
year come without finding how he stood
financially, and just so we should find
bow we stand with God.
The speaker likened us to weaver? and
said that as a weaver stands behind the
loom and cannot see the pattern he is
making so we in our lives cannot see
what kind of a pattern wo are weaving,
but God sees, and we, too, shall see by
and by. The selfish man is weaving a
pattern he will not wish to see, but he
who is living his life for God and for
others is weaving a beautiful pattern,
though he may be utterly unconscious of
it himself.
"Think if a diary were kept of our sins,"
said he, "how the pages would be filled
with accounts of passion and wrath, of
fickleness, of unkind things said of others,
of impure thoughts and acts. Then think
of the good acts of onr lives. Would there
be a balance? LÂ«t us in the coming yenr
live our lives to God, doing our daily duty,
and 'forgetting those tilings which are be
hind, reach forth unto those things which
are before.' "

THE STORY OF THE FLOOD
Not a Myth Producd by the
Imagination, Says Rev.
;'â¢ Dr. Rader.
Investigation 'into the Origin and
Nature of the Deluge Is, Asserted
the Speaker, Higher Criticism.
Rev. William Rader spoke last nigbt on
i "The Deluge" . iir the Third Congrega
tional Church. ,He said:
"The deluge wus not a rnylh produced
by the iaagination, but a tradition wmch,
sprang out of an event. There is evi
dence of a local flood occurring in that
part of the world peopled by our ancestors
â before they separated into races.
"The tradition of a flood is held by all
i branches of the human family except the
blacks. The Hebrews did not, according
to the best authority, hola this tradition
hrst. Neither did they, according to the
Rabbinical theory of verbal inspiration,
receive it by direct revelation from God,
but by oral tradition and from existing
documents. Genesis is a composite book,
made up of more than one document.
"The deluge. was usea to teach the unity
and vengeance of God, ihe Jaw of retrib
utive justice and the fact oi sin."
Speaking of "the higher criticism ana
the Bible," the speaker said: .â  Â .
This investigation into the origin and nature
of the deluge, is higher criticism. -\on will
obsorve that it Is perfectly harmless. Honest
thought has never destroyed anything', it is
the wrong thinking that injures the Bible, not
the right thinking. Some are afraid of tnW
term "higher criticism," which means simply
an intelligent study of tlie Bible, its
sixty-six books, the literary nature of its con- 1
tents, the evolution of Its thought, the condi
tion of the text, and the contemporaneous
hlstorv surrounding the men who prepared
the biblical narration. It is destructive of
falsehood and fear, of superstition and Igno
rance. When Copernicus proved the old
theory of the universe to be wrong, the stars
did not drop, they shone with greater luster.
Shakespeare's plays have never been Harmed
by study. It is a pitiable reflection upon
Protestantism to hear religious teachers up
braid the men who search ihe Scriptures and
ask the Bible to tell the secret of its power.
They dream of a time when some German
critic will tumble ddwn the Bible structure
and all the orthodox will be crushed. But it
is only a harmless nightmare. The real test
of the Bible is not found in thought, but life.
It is the sinner, not the saint, who brings the
real test to the Word of God. Does it accom
plish for him what he is told it will? That is
the real issue in the controversy about the
Scripture*. Men take pride in finding fault
with Bible students. It sounds pretty well in
a ministers' meeting or in the pulpit to arro
gate to oneself the infallibility of knowledge,
as against the ripest thought of the world, buc
it is a very unwise treatment of some very good
and wise men. â  â â â â â â¢â  -â¢ â â â >â¢â 
â¢ ; When it was announced a few years ago that
no one man, not even Moses, wrote the first
five books of the Oid Testament, men who had
never given the matter an hour's critical study
made crosses of orthodoxy on which to bung
these bold critics. To-day there is but oue
scholar in the United States who believes in
the Mosaic authorship or the Pentateuch.
Who are these dangerous men? I will name
a few and you may judge for yourselves whether
or not th^-y are to be trusied. Look first at the
British pulpit. Tnere is Canon Farrar, whose
golden tongue has thrilled Westminster Abbey
for so many years, rivaled only by Cnnon Lid
don of St. Paul's. In Scotland is Professor
Drumnioi'd, and Bruce, and Dods, and that
group of devout men who nave challenged the
admiration of the world. I would add to these
the name of lan McLaren, whose words are
read by the English-speaking world. On this
side of the Atlantic it is difficult to select a iew
names from the long list 01 preachers who rep
resent the school of ihe higher leiirninu'. Henry
Ward Beecher and Phillips Brooks, whose elo
quence still molds the characters oi tne Har
vard students fttid illustrates the Immortality
of an honest man; Dr. Lyinan Abbott, whose
gentle life is as pure hs his faith in the Christ
of the eospels, Â»nd Dr. George Gordon, who
stands like a pillar of light in the old South
Church in Boston; Professor llarper of the
University of Chicago and Professor Brigga of
New York, and scores of others whom I might

ALMOST BURIED
IN TONS OF FLOUR
Eight Men on the T. C
Walker Experience a
Very Dusty Time.
The Vessel Struck a Sandbank
and the Sacks Were Thrown
to Port.
A Horse Caught in the G9neral Mix-
Up Escaped Without Any
I'- jury.
Eight men had a narrow escape for
their lives on the river steamer T. C.
Walker last Saturday night. The vessel
was on her way from Stockton to San
Francisco and in the darkness the captain
mistook a beacon and ran into a mud
bank. Two hundred tons of flour in 100
--pound sacks was thrown to port and two
ol the men were buried and a horse that
was en route to lugleside was so tangled
up that be could not get his feot free from
the mass of clingins flour. For a time
pandemonium reigned, and between the
neighing of the unfortunate horse and the
screams of the men who were under the
flour the deckhands lost their head-s and
there was almost a panic aboard.
The T. C. Walker teft StocKton with a
very heavy cargo last.Saturday afternoon.
She was loaded down with flour for the
Pacific Mail Company's steamer Peru,
which leaves for China next Thursday,
and Captain Benson was anxious to get
here on time in cder to get his cargo
aboard.
The Walker had an extra crew aboard
and consequently there were no berths for
the men who came aboard at the last
minute. "Billy" Farrell, "Pat" Dunnine,
"Mike" Dooley, "Dan' O'Connor, L. H.
Bevis, William Layton and "Pele" Cour
.neen made their beds among the flour.
When the Walker struck the bank the
flour fell on the sleeping men and almost
mined the horse. All that could be seen
of Dooley was his head and the only
thing that let the remainder of the ship's
crew know that Farrell was alive was a
wiggling foot that stuck out between two
sacks of flour.
The other men could not be seen, but in
a few minutes the sacks of flour were re
moved and all and sundry were rescued.
The only man injured was Farrell, and he
was sent to the hospital. His face was
badly scraped and his right side bruised
to such an extent that it will be months
before he can work again. The Walker
has still a big list to port, and it will be
late this afternoon before she is on an
even keel again. During his struggles to
get free the horse ruined quite a number
of sacks of the flour that somebody will
have to pay for.
It was reception day on the Oregon yes
terday, and the men had more than usual
liberty. Ensign Durell was officer of the
day, and he saw to it that while the men
enjoyed "just so much liberty" there was
"no license. " Every member of the crew
was allowed to have Ins "sweetheart or
wife' aboard, and as they brought their
friends with them the decks of the big
battle ship were thronged.
M:inv of the visitors brought musical
instruments with them, and the strains
of the "Star Spangled Banner" and
"Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot"
could be beard from forecastle and cabin.
On the main deck the men and their
sweethearts had a quiet little dance, but
of course it was sub rosa, and the sailors
think all the more of their officers because
they "looked the other way " when the
dance was going on. A cleaner or more
orderly set of men Uncle Sam has never
sent out than the crew that mans the
Oregon.
There i 3 a big gap between the Oregon
and Comanche. The former is an up-to
date battle-ship and the latter is an obso
lete monitor. She is now being used as a
training-ship for the Naval Battalion and
incidentally as a dovecote for the Mare
Island carrier pigeons. For use in war
time the carriers are now being trained,
and as a preliminary they are to be flown
daily between Mare Island and the
Comanche.
The dovecote on the latter is Slabeled
Constellation, and the one on the island
is marked Hartford. The care takers on
the Comancne assert that the pigeons
aboard their vessel can beat telegraph
time easily.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Zea
landia and the Pacific Mail Company's
Peru botn sail for Honolulu next Thurs
day. The former will continue on tier
way to Australasia, and the latter will go
to the Orient. The Peru is in splendid
running order, and the Zealandia has not
been overhauled for many months. Nev
ertheless .he betting is that the Zealandia
will beat the Peru to Honolulu. Both
vessels have very popular officers in all
the departments, so it remains to bo seen
which will carry the bulk of the Honolulu
passengers.

HASKELL BLEW UP
THE POPULISTS
His Petard Hoisted Some
Bright Engineers of
the Party.
The Victims Consider That Their
Disaster Means the Disrup
tion of the Cause.
Some of the Growlings in Detail That
Issue From the Camp of the
Discomfited.
Burnette G. HaskeH'9 bomb exploded
Saturday night at the meeting of the
Populist County Committee, and the
fragments of those who were hoisted by
the petard were tumbling to earth yester
day, emitting angry howls and snarlings
in their fali.
Haskell has succeeded in retiring such
old-timers in the party as E. S. Barney,
Dr. George W. Day wait, Taylor Rogers,
George D. Gillespie, T. V. Cator, Joseph
Asbury Johnson and John C. Gore, as
well as a few others, and they do not pro
pose to submit to the ordeal without ex
pressing their ideas upon the involuntary
and rather unceremonious shake-up to
which they were subjected.
"No, we were not read out of the party.
They would not dare do that!" is the
general and individual expression. "But
there is no gainsaying that Burnette G.
Haskeli has captured the works. "
"He is a gifted fellow," stated J. A.
Johnson yesterday. "He is plausible and
I doubt if there is a more competent man
for organization or manipulation of par
ties, conventions or committee- in these
United States. But he is the last man on
earth to stand up and preach righteous
ness and utmost rectitude of thought as
one wno has never committed a blunder."
Mr. J< hnsonand J. C. Gore, the deposed
treasurer, appear to be of the opinion
that the Haske.l coup d'etat will have a
nefarious and widespread effect on the
party in the State â maybe giving it its
deathblow.
"Although I do not see how the vote
could be segregated, it was given out as
21,000 in this State at tne recentelections,"
said Mr. Johnson. "As a matter of fact, I
have learned trom people of our par;y
from all over California, that some 60,000
votes were cast by Populists, a third of
which went to the Republicans."
In summing up their judgmcut in the
matter, both .Johnson and Gore agreed
that the 2,000,000 votes claimed by the
Populist* in the United States were greatly
niade up of Republican suffrage-men, who
for one cause or another quit their party
for the new one, but who returned to the
Republican banner when the Populists de
cided to fuse with the hated Democracy.
Tho i e who were onsted from the local
organization claim that the animus of the
scheme that left them stranded was not so
much that they were fusionists, because
they had fought against fusion to the last,
and only agreed to it when it was warmly
indorsed by B. G. Haskeli, but that Has
kell wanted complete control of the com
mittee.
Umler the party machinery the consti
tution and organization i.i this City is the
Assembly district delegate system. Has
kell's activity and suave manner, as well
as his assumed unctuousness, have prac
tically enabled him to control all the
clubs. He sees leaders and sends in the
names of only those who are "right" so far
as he is concerned as delegates to the
County Committee.
No delegates can be admitted to the
County Committee excepting by vote of
the commute ; hence, any gentleman of
character and standing, whose influence
would be detrimental to the Haskell
schemes and those of his confederates,
would not be admitted to a seat in tha
committee.
A year hence, when the campaign opens
for 1898, the Haskell element will be in
control of the party organization, and of
course will control" the nominating con
vention. For this reason it may properly
be assumed thai Haskell has ostracized
the conservative element of the party.
The vote at Saturday night's meeting
was simply astounding. Those who are
now on the outside of the fence call it
"raw," in the political vernacular. The
word "slate" was used also, and for verifi
cation they point to the tally sheet.
There were forty-two votes cast. Just
prior to polling Uie votes, riaskell and his
henchmen were active passing around
lists on which were printed the names of
the members of the executive committee
that were elected by an overwhelming
vote.
In the case of Treasurer Gore, the man
who pulled the committee out of a $700
indebtedness, he was the only nomination
presented for re-election at the last con
vention. Suddenly, at the e'eventh hour
on Saturday night, the name of J. H. Ting
rnan was circulated on the slated list. He
received 33 votes against only 9 votes for
Gore.
Tingman has been the treasurer of the
Purity of Election Committee, and he
should have turned over his accounts Sat
urday night to the committee showing the
disposition of funds be had received and
disbursed. This was omitted according to
slated instructions, and will have to ba
done next Saturday night, when a general
howl is expected to go up. The howl,
hjwever, will come in the nature of a post
mortem, Tingm>-n having already been
elected to the office of treasurer.
Tingman, his friends say, can show a
perfect balance when required.
All these things will be gone into next
Saturday, wnen ex-Treasurer Gore will
al*o present his report, accompanied by
individual remarks upon the duties ot a
treasurer that are calculated to burn the
ears of some of his listeners.
OAENIVAL. WILL SUCCEED.
Many Soelal Organisations Will Par
ticipate in the Festivities.
Each day brings new evidences that the
Carnival of the Golden Gate, which be
gins on April 19, will be a great success.
Corresponding Secretary Fisher has been
busy for several weeks sending letters to
various organizations thought to be
eligible to partake in the week of festivi
ties.
Replies have been received from many
societies, and the secretary says he now
has assurance that there will be a success.
The following is a copy of the letter sent
to every social organization in the City
Saturday:
The executive committee of the Carnival of
the Gulden Gate lias prepared an elaborate
(.rosranimo for a week of festivities, com
mencing Easter Monday, April li>, 1Â«597.
In order to make it an unqualified success.
we need the co-operation of all citizens and
organized bodies. The features of the various
days which have already been outlined, we
have every confidence will be fully carried
out. To do this properly, we request the'
assistance of your organization.
On special days, monster processions will be
the features. In these processions we desire to
incorporate the mtinuiacturing, commercial
and fraternal interests of the City and State.
Your organization has an object. A float
representing this ic"ea would undoubtedly
attract marked attention. We desire that each
organization should appoint one or more
representatives with wliotn the oxecuiive com
mittee couid confer, and through whom all
dealings with the organization might be
carried on without loss of time. If you wi;l
kindly designate such' representatives and
send their names to headquarters at as early a
date as possible, you would greatly expedite

Eddie Gray Arrested for Board
ing a Car to Sell
Pap3rs.
Captain Spillane and Hh Officers Add
Charity to the Law's
Dmiuds.
Eddie Gray, a newsboy aged 15 year?,
with a sick father and no mother and a
cripple at that, boarded an electric-car on
Third street, at the depot, yesterday
morning, to serve a prospective customer.
Unfortunately for the crippled newsboy,
Special Officer H. Smith, who is in the de
tective service of the Southern Pacific,
observed him get on the cnr and in a
moment the special officer had the news
boy by the collar. Without further cere
mony be took the boy off to the Southern
police station, where he asked Prison
keepor T. R. Judsou to book him and lock
In in up..
Judson looked at the boy and then cast
his eye on the big burly special before he
booked a charge of violating a Gtjy ordi
nance against ttie little offender. Then
instead of locking him up Judson seated
him before the office stove, sent out for
some coffee and bread and made the news
boy as comfortable as he could until the
arrival of Captain Spillane and Lieutenant
Dan Uanna at 12 o'clock.
The nature of the arrest was explained
to those officials, when Captain Spillane
released the boy on his own recognizance,
and told him to report at t c Central sta
tion this morning, when his appearance
will be necessary before one of the Police
Judues. But before leaving the Southern
station both Spillane and Uanna, with
the cheerful assistance of the officers on
station duty, presented the newsboy with
sufficient silver to buy himself and his
father their breakfast.
THE S.P LOOKING
AT RANDSBURG
H. E. Huntington Visits
the Big Mining Camp
in the Desert.
Has an Engineer With Him
to Figure on Grade
and Cost.
There May Be a Race Between the
A. and P and S. P. to First
Reach the Ground.
There may be a race between the Atlan
tic ma Pacific and the Southern Pacific
to get into Jlandsburg.
H. E. Huntington with a party of rail
road men, among whom was Assistant
Engineer P. Gelette, has been looking
over the ground during the past week.
The party drove over from Mojave a few
days ago in a rig, a distance of sixty
miles, and remained there to study the
situation. Mr. Huntington gave his at
tention to the mines. It was his desire to
get at the stability ol the proposition;
whether or not the mines are likely to
last, and, so, whether it is wortji wiiile to
build the road or not. It was the business
of Mr. Gelette to look to grades and the
best route in, in case it was found to be
worth while.
The miners undertook to prove to Mr.
Huntington that Randsburg is the big
gest and most substantial mining propo
sition in the countryâ that it will prove a
second Cripple Creelr.
The speculations', therefore, of Mr. Oe
lette and tne railroad builders become in
teresting. Randsburg stands at an eleva
tion of 3750 ieet; a ranse of mountains
with sharp ascents lie to the west of it,
toward Mojave. The line, according to
Mr. Gelette, would have to be run north
ward- to Garlock to avoid grades, and
thence southwest through a pass to
Randsburg, a distance, ahogetiier, of sixty
miles. Garlock is located ai a height of
2360, or 1400 lower than Randaburir, and
fifteen niiies away. The engineer says the
road can be built with no extraordinary
expense.
F. S. Min not, a lawyer of Coos Bay, has
ju?t returned from Rundsburg on his way
home and is stopping at the Lick House.
He saw the Huntington party in Rands
burg. He says their visit was a matter of
interest to the miners.
The Atlantic and Pacific, he says, has
decided to build from Cramer, a station
twenty-eight miles south of Randsburg.
The intention is, on their part, to stop at
Johannesburg, a small town recently
started about a mile south of Randsburg.
"Randsburg," said Mr. Minnot yes
terday, "has now about 3000 people, and
new comers are going in at the rate of
about fifty a day. There is no doubt that
the country is to be a cood and lasting
one. To be sure, the full test lias not been
put to it yet, but every indication points
that w:iy. The group of mines known as
the Rand mines have made bitryieids and
the further they go the better tney pan
out â I mean all the mines in the district.
The Olympus, the principal of the Rand
mines, has been sunk 15G feet and $00,000
has been taken out, more than enough to
pay all the expense of opening and work
ing the shaft.
"The Butt-, mine has yielded up $28,000.
The Wedge mine, sunk 120 feet, has
yielded $20,000. One man has employed
boys to scour the hills and gather what
they call float, a quartz iound on the sur
face. He Fends this to the mills at Gar
lock and it yields a goo<i profit. There
are several stamp mills at Garlock. There
is no doubt that the region is very rich
and I look for it to develop into one of the
great if not the greatest mining camp in
the country." '
Mr. Minnot was token with the cold
tever and went to Randsburg in the early
rush. He staked out a claim which he
thinks will yield good money, but is con
tent to leave it alone for a while. He says
there are more man and mines in the
region than there is capital. What is
needed is capital to develop.

ENVELOPED IN A
GLEAM OF LIGHT
While the Organ Pealed
Forth "Nearer, My God,
to Thee."
The Passing of J. Ross Jackson,
Journalist, Bohemian and
Every One's Friend.
Roses From Mrs. Jackson and Their
Daufhtar Reposed on the Breast
of the Dead Journalist
The remains of J. Ross Jackson, the
widely known journalist and club man,
were cremated at 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon at the Odd Fellows' Cemetery amid
a gathering of a few of his particular
friends. The incineration was impressive
and was carried forward with tbe greatest
reverence. At a few minutes after 2
o'clock Mr. Fletcher, the superintendent
of the cemetery, called Judge W. P. Law
lor, C. M. Coe, the president of the Press
Club, and Superior Judge J. C. B. Heb
bard to identify the body. Then it was
prepared for the end.
iv the winding-sheet which enfolded
the body was a bunch of white roses,
placed there by Mrs. Jackson, and also a
bunch of white flowers which had been
sent by his only daughter, Mrs. Carrie
Raftael.
TJae veteran newspaper roan appeared
as though sleeping as be lay in his white
shroud. His face was peaceful and tran
quil, and he seemed to rest well after the
long struggle, during which he liad
bravely fought to conceal his suffering.
Every one who had seen him before, as
be lay in tbe bier, was struck with the
look of calm repose upon bis face.
The witnesses retired into the little
chapel-like place near at hand, where the
other friends vvere gathered, and whereon
one side is the entrance to the super
heated retort. A few seats fill one side of
this room, and there the ladies and gen
tlemen were waiting. Then there was a
gleam of light as the door of the retort
swung open, and the body of the journal
ist, enveloped in white, disÂ»ppeared like a
flash in the grave of fire.
At the same instant there came pealing
from the organ in the sanctuary above
tne solemn and impressive chords of
"Nearer, My God, to Thee." It was, as
one who heard it said, almost heavenly.
The effect was as beautiful as the Hash of
the disappearing body had been dra
matic. No one there will ever forget the
scene.
Among those who had come out to wit
ness the cremation were the following:
Superior Judge J. C. B. Hebbard, Mrs.
Hebbard, Superior Judge Hunt, W. P.
Lawior, C. M. Coe, John J. Raffael. John
Walrten, John W. Willis, Mr?. A. T. Dob
son, P. 8. Myrter, Heary M. Whitely,
Ernest Hacquette.
Several ladies, some of whom were
friends and acquaintances of the family,
who had come on their Own accord, were
readily admitted by Judge Lawior.
As is customary in such case*, the casket

WHEELMEN WANT
SUNDAY RACING
They Will Ask tha League
to Permit Such
Meets.
Delegates Will Plead at the
Annual Meeting at
Albany.
A Blue Ribbon Meet to Defray the
Expenses of Those Who Will
Go East.
Racing men, club officials and promi
nent members of the North California Di
vision of the League of American Wheel
men are convinced that there is but one
thing which can put cycline on this coast
in the place among sports which they feel
it should occupy. They are practically
unanimous in tbo opinion that to save tlie
sport the ban which the league lias placed
on Sunday racing should bt*. so far as this
coast is concerned, removed, and local
wheelmen are exerting every energy to
this end.
On February 10 the League of American
â Wheelmen will hold its annual meeting
at Albany, N. Y. This is the great event
of the year in the cycling world, and as
this organization controls practically all
track racing in the United States it is to
this meeting that Western riders look for
relief from the clause w-hich they consider
one rous.
California will*have seven delegates in
the meeting. Numerically, the strength
of the coast is of no consequence what
ever. New York alone, with its 20,000
league members, having fifty-two repre
sentatives.
It is the intention of the officials of this
division, however, to send its strongest
men to Albany to see what argument,
persuasion and entreaty can do. The per
sonnel of the delegation is not completely
determined upon yet, but those who it is
so far certain will go are: F. H. Kerri
gan, chief consul of the North California
division; Robert M. Welch, chairman of
the State racing board; John E. Alexander
of San Jose, and B. A. Smyttie, official
handicapper of this division.
In the fight before the convention Cali
fornia will have the support of all the ex
treme Western States, including Colorado,
ana also ot Louisiana and .Missouri. It is
not the desire of the California members
to have the leatrue lift thÂ« ban fromfcnn
day racing absolutely. W"hat they desire
is divisional option â that is, that each di
vision be permitted to vote for itself upon
the proposition and take action accord
ingly. Sterling Elliott, president of the
league, has expressed himself in favor of
this concession, though he opposes Sun
<iav racing in his own division. Isaac B.
Potter, chief consul of the powerful New
Yo r k division, is also said to favor di
visional option. He is said to exert a
great inflii"nce in his jurisdiction and the
friends of the measure hope for his
friendly offices with New York's rifty-two
delegates.
The sentiment of the race nromoters in
the ranticr was voiced by W. B. Fawcett
of the Velodr me yesterday.
"The situation is simplythis," he said.
"In the East Saturday!* generally ob
served as a half holiday. The yonng men
â who have labored in stores and offices all
week take their recreation at that time,
and there Saturday racing is a great suc
cess. On this coas: conditions are differ
ent. Saturday is not a half holiday, and
Sunday is generally looked upon as h day
of rest and recreation. At present there
is no other sport so popular as wheeling,
and the young men who on Sunday* do
not know what to do with themselves
would gladly avail themselves of the op
portunity to patronize their favorite sport.
"Now the few holidays they have are
about tho only opportunities to witness
racing. Saturday racing is not sufficiently
profitable to pay for the maintenance of a
good track, and the prizes offered must
necessarily be small to allow any profit on
the meets."
The racing men themselves look at this
matter from a somewhat different stand
point, but are equally emphatic in their
desires for more racing. Roma Dow, the
sneedy professional pacemaker, expressed
The views of the speed merchants when he
Mi d : '"Sunday racing will certainly be a
great thing for this coast. The way things
are now it hardly pays a man to keep in
training, even if he wins right along.
With Sunday racintr there would be meets
at a number of tracks each week.
"The prospect of more races would bring
good men here from the East and many of
. the best amateurs would enter the pro
j fessional class. There would be competi
[ tion tracks, and this fact, together with
increased profits, would allow the race
promoters to hane up better prizes.
Then? i* no reason why Sunday racing
could not be conducted as well as the con
: tests which are being held on week days.
â Every professional and, I think, almost
, every other racing man on the coast is in
. favor of the change in the league by
: laTTS."
Other racing men expressed themselye3
in a similar strain.
In order to aid in defraying the ex
rens-es of the delegates to the Albapy
, meeting a bine ribbon meet will be held
;at tbe Velodrome on January 16. The
desisjnation uf the meet signifies that no
: prizes will be offered other than blue rib
bon?, the riders, by consenting to ride for
ptnese trophies, showing their interest in
I the cause. Among thÂ« speedy men, who
I â will appear are Ziegler, Poster, McFarlund,
| Stevens. Well?, Terrill brothers. Becker of
; Minnpnr-oiis, Dow of Seattle, Jones, Boy
! den, Whitman, Eovee and Norris of Texas
1 and all the speedy amateurs.
The programme is said to be the best
vet arranged for the Velodrome. Itcon
: sists of one-tliird of mile scratch, profes
sional; two-thirds of|mile hanc'icap.profes
sional; one-third of mile scratch, amateur;
half-n>ile handicap, amateur. There will
brÂ» a number of interesting record trials.
ThÂ» Cycle Board of Trade will hold a
meeting next Wednesday evening, at
which it will consider means by which it
can lend its support to the Sunday racing
proposition and the blue ribbon meet in
particular.
L. H. Smith of the Olympic Club Wheel
men and Harry Fowler of the San Fran
cisco Road Club started the new year with
one of the pluckiest rides on record. Just
as the clock ushered in the new year they
lef i the Oakland mole for a century around
the bay. It was raining and had "been for
two or three days, the roads beinu in a
miserable condition. In spite of this fact
they reached San Jose, a distance of forty
two miles, in seven hours. They stopped at
San Jose one liour for re<t and breakfast,
and then resumed their journey, reaching
this City at 6 o'clock. En routa they made
sufficient detours to make up the six
miles which the trip lacks of being a com
plete century. Their time of eighteen
hours is considered remarkable under the
circumstances.

Hajrmarket.
Another splendid card is ofTered race
goers to Ingleside this atternoon. A num
ber of new norses start for the first time
during the meeting, amonj them Senator
Irby. The Senator has fallen in with
some very ordinary company in the open
ing race, and although he Das been
"shelved" for over a year, he shoulit be
able 10 wit without much effort. Start
ing in t lie different events are such rare
good performers as Zamar 11, Caspar,
Preston. Three Forks, Tonsina, Libertine,
Kamsin ana Salvable. making up a very
strong card for the opening day of the
week.
D. M. Boyd, who controls the horse
Haymarker, objects to statements in sev
eral newspapets yesterday concerning him
and the hurdle race at Ingleside last Sat
urday. Mr. Boyd said yesterday: "I
never tola anybody to lay my horse up. 1
was out for the purse and wanted to win
it. i was anxious to win that race ana
would not lay a horse up under any con
sideration. I made no overtures to tne
iockev or anybody else. I was jobbed out
or that race. The jockey says he fell off,
but he jumred off. and my horse finished
third without a rider. 1 have heard noth
ing about an investigation."

THE SWEDES VICTORIOUS
The Canadians, Though Beaten,
Gave Their Opponents All
They Could Do.
A Team Runs Away in the Park,
and a Man Drops From a Balloon
Near tne 0 ympic Club House.
One of the most interesting of the series
of tue-of-war contests at the Sutro Baths
toon place yesterday afternoon between
the champion teams of Canadians and
Swedes. The programme announced was
varied somewhat by Ireland versus Den
mark being the hrst event, instead of
Germany versus Norway, and Italy and
Portugal did not measure stiengtb at all.
In the first contest the Irish had an easy
conquest over the Dsiies. It only occu
pied a few minutes to prove that Denmark
was considerably overmatched. In the
second struggle Norway and Germany
gave the spectators much more excite
ment by their evenly matched prowess.
The event seemed very doubtful lor some
time, but the Germans had the greatest
endurance and pulled their competitors
across the line of defeat in about seven
minutes. The Norwegians had an anchor
man who looked heavy enough to have
required an immense effort to pull just
his dead weight. The Germans seemed to
have so great a majority of friends in the
building that no doubt' their encouraging
shouts stimulated the team from the
fatherland to the efforts of the final strain
that gave them victory.
As soon as the Canadians and Swedes
came upon the platform, the prophecy ol
an exceedingly well-contested tug-01-war
could be heard on all sides. They had
both been victors in many battles and are
all powerful looking fellows, with deter
mination on their faces as well as big
muscles on their limbs.
After the pistol t-hot Canada had about
half a cleat to the good. Then for a long
time both teams lay as still as dead men,
apparently exactly matched. Canada
made the first vigorous tup and gained
five cleats in all before the tables turned
against tliem, and then Sweden pulled
back exactly what they had lost..
Then began a long test of endurance.
The tense strain lasted without result till
the watch showed halt of the thiriy
minute limit was used up. Then Sweden
nearly gained a cleat, but at sixteen
minutes the Canadians drew the staff back
to the center. The tie lasted till twenty
two minutes, when Canada gained a cleat
and held it two minutes. Tlie Swedes put
forth their reserve power and gained rive
cleats, which they held four minutes, and
just at the next to the last minute of the
limit, they tugged again and won amid en
thusiastic cheers.
The day at the Cliff House was a very
quiet one. The Dark had quite an excite
ment between 2 and 3 o'clock, caused by a
runaway team, which was gallantly cap
tured by Captain Thomson.
E. Gossm an of 404 Stockton street was
driving a spirited team through the p.irk,
when one of the horses began to kick and
got over the pole, breaking it. Both
horses then became terrified and dashed
off, upsetting the buggy on a bank. Goss
man was thrown out with great violence,
but was not much hurt. A stableman
took tne horses home. They were not in
jured.
The most interesting event at the
Chutes yesierday afternoon was the bal
loon ascension of Professor Mnrkeburg.
It was one of the best they have had. Â±le
made a parachute- descent and landed in
the park, just this side of the Olympic
Club house.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.
WEARY WALKER

Railroad Ties.

to Appear on Well-Lighted
Bituminous Pavements.
"Bicycle Jim" has struck San Fran
cisco. He is a tramp on wheels and arxre
character. He bowled up Market street
from the Oakland ferry yesterday, finally
finding a resting-place at the fountain.
His strange outfit and his own peculiar
appearance attracted a crowd of boisler-
UPm no professional bike-rider, but Pm tired of hittin* the bumpers.
See?" said "Bicycle Jim/ the fin de siecle tramp who
has taken to the wheel.
ous at once, and he was soon surrounded
by a curious throng.
He was a iin de siecle tramp of the first
water. He wore knickerbockers, long
stockings, bicycle shoes, a peaKed cap and
a sweater. These were all the worse for
wear, it is true, and parched in many
places with cloths of many colors, but in
pattern they were thorouehly up to date.
Out from a pocket in his "knickers"
"Bicycle Jim 1 ' drew the stub of a cigar
ette and nonchalantly asked a bystander,
who was smokinsr, for a light. He seemed
to enjoy being stared at by the crowd and
to appreciate the fact that at that par
ticular moment he was a center of attrac
tion.
"I'm no professional bike rider," said
the unique tramp to a questioner; "I'm
not out fer enny record, either; I got
tired of hittin 1 the bumpers, see? An 1 1
tumbles on to this hero way of gettin'

Well, solong, I wants to got d' lay of d'

an' maybe I will see you again."
Mounting his dilapidated wheel "Bicy

went s-kimming up that thoroughfare at a
lively clip.
ROLLED THE PUSH BULL
Imperials and Howards Try Out
the New Game at the
Velodrome.
Not Ku:h Science Exhibited, bat Con
siderable Excitement and Some
Absurdities.
The huge rubber sphere known as the
â¢'push ball" was rolled out into the field
at the Velodrome yesterday and a small
crowd of curious spectators watched two
"sevens" from the Howard and the Im
perial football teams demonstrate what
they didn't know about the new game,
which is said to be very popular in the
East.
Push ball is an interesting game. When
it is not exciting it is ludicrous, and at all
times it is apparently harmless. Neither
team was in a particularly good condi
tion, and both were equally ignorant of
the idiosyncrasies of the great rubber ball.
The gam#, which consists, an the name
implies, in pushing the ball, each team
endeavoring, as in football, to cross the
other's L'oal line, requires a great deal
more exertion than is apparent to the
spectators. In order to keep the niayers
in any kind of vim it was necessary
yesterday to allow them to rest two min
utes after one minute's play. Ojdinanly
the periods of tbe play are two minutes
each. Ten minutes' play constitutes a
half, after which a fifteen-minuie inter
mission is had.
The Howaros, who a couple of season's
ago formed a football team, had the best
of the argument from tbe rirst.
Tbe Imperials, who had been in a rather
lively mixup over the pigskin at San Ra
fael Saturday, were somewhat addicted to
that justly celebrated tired feeling, and
time alter time the big windbag went
rolling over the whitewashed line which
they were supposed to be looking after.
Only once did the ball roll to suit them,
and they had to be satisfied with a score
of 24 to 1 in favor of the Howards.
The players were:
Howardsâ C. Bernhard, W. Wilson, R.
Ready, H. Diedrich, E. Stantenbnrg, J.
Hughes, 1). Mahoney, H. McNevin, D.
Atkinson.
Imperialsâ R. Weber, J. Moore, N. Mnl
lin, R. Reno, H. Watkins, R. Cornell, W.
Leawy. F. Johnston.
The teams intend to practice during the
week, and a more scientific contest is ex
pected next Sunday.
AROUND THE DIAMOND.
The Alaineda AlÂ«?ts Defeated by the
San Francisco Athletic Club.
The Alaineda Alerts met defeat a second
time yesterday at the hands of the San'
Francisco Athletic Club aggregation. At
the end of the ninth inning the score
stood 6 to 4 in favor of the Athletic Club.
There have been a great many fine
games played at Central Park this season,
but yesterday's game surpassed them all.
Both teams played fast from start to
hnisb, and the brilliant plays kept the
large crowd constantly cheering.
In the first inning the Alerts scored two
runs. Bird reached first on a single, ana
Brockoft lollowed with a home-run hit
over the right field fence, bringing in Bird.
The Alerts were hitting Raymond
freely, but the splendid fielding of their
opponents prevented them from scoring.
In the seventh inning the San Francisco
boys began making connections with Mc-
Kee's curves, ana this seemed to rattle the
Alerts. Murphy tipped the ball in front
of the plate and beat it to first. Dreus fol
lowed with a home run, hit over the right
field fence, bringing in Murphy' and ty
ing the score. Raymond hit safely be
tween short and second and Sheeban was
given bis base on bails, advancing Ray
mond to second. With two men on bases
Spellroan bit a long fly to Croll, who iet it
slip through his hands, allowing Raymond
and fcheehan to score, and allowing Spell
man to reach third base. Pheiffer hit to
Brockoff, who fumbled, but got the ball
over in time to put Pbeiffer out, and Shee
nan scored.
Van Norden was given his base on
balls, and in trying to st ral second pot
into a clinch, hut through Goldsworthy's
error gained his base. Reisso followed
-with a bounding hit to Croll, and Van
Norden scored. In trying to steal sec
ond Keis-o was thrown out. Ford was
given his base on balls, and Murphy then
hit to second, forcing Ford out and end
ing the inning. In the eighth Krug made
a home run, but the Alerts were unable to
overcome the lead.
Some of the features of the game were
the lightning throws to bases by Raymond
and Dreus.
The latter prevonted the Alerts from
scoring in the fifth inning by catching
: Bird napping on third, putting him out
j and retiring the Alerts when they had
| three men on bases and Krujr at the bat.
The playing of Brockoff and Krug was of
high order. Ford's playing on tirst yes
terday stamped him aa being one of the
best on the Coast.

A PLEA TOR THE HOMELESS CAT
A Hospital for Diseased and Wounded
Members of the Feline Family.
Mrs. E. C. William writes from 80 Park
road, Hampstead : "Last January I built
and opened a home, calling it the 'Lon
don Home for Lost Cats.' Since that date
I have received the enormous number of
over 1856 miserable, homeless animals,
some in the most dreadful state of disease
or broken limbs, rescued oni of empty
houses and areas, from cruel boys or
starring in the squares of our great
London. Case after case I have had
brought to me in such a wounded condi
tion as to soften the heart of the most
hardened person. My staff consists of
two young men in uniform, a girl and two
secretaries.
"The lails are all day rescuing Â»nd fetch
ing cats upon receipt of postal card. I re
ceive letters by the dozen daily, pointing
out cases to rescue. The home consists of
the healthy cats' department â i. c., wait
ing for homes â the infirmary for good cats
that are sick, the kittens' department and
three compartments for strays, which are
sent three times a week to the Battersea
lethai chamber, where, for tid a head (con
tract), they are at once mercilully" and
painlessly destroyed. I average the enor
mous number of eighty to one hun
dred cats weekly, 80 per cent of
which are sent to their long sleep.
I opened this home against every
difficulty thrown in my way, not the
least being the jeers and sneers of the pub
lic, crowds of boys, pelting my servants,
etc I am now, I think, fairly established,
anU the public at least appreciate my
bumble efforts on behalf of the most ill
used, uncareci-for, and neglected of God's
creaturesâ the cat. Every day I receive
letters of praise and thanks ior my work,
but few of them inclosing even the small
est help for the material part of my work.
The ext>enses are between Â£7 and Â£8 a
week; but few send me more than the
merest trifle, and many refuse even my
servant's fares, though requesting him to
call long distances. Let me earnestly en
treat lor help to carry on my mission of
mercy, now that the winter is nigh!"â

MINING BRINGS
MONEY WEST
The State Mineralogist's
Report Shows En
couragement
All Sections of the State Feel
the General Pros
perity.
Capitalists Begin to See That Their
Money Has Rare Chances in
California.
In view of the widespread interest
abroad in mining matters in California the
last report of J. J. Crawford, State Miner
alogist, is fraught with more than the
usual interest.
Though the report is for the two years
ending September 15, 1896, it has just
been issued.
It appears from the report that nearly
55,000 persons interested in mining mat
ters have visited the museum in two
years, showing an average of more than
2000 persons each month, and nearly 700
new samples have been labeled and added
to the list of curiosities.
That foreign capital is seeking invest
ment in Caliiornia mines as it has not
done for years has lately been shown by a
series of articles in The Call. The State
Mineralogist shows that this is true. Un
der the heading of "Quartz Mining" he
says:
I am pleased to say that continued activity
has prevailed, and still continues, in nearly
all lines of the mining industry, with every
encouragement for still greater future devel
opment. A great deal of capital is seeking in
vestment in legitimate mining enterprise,
and it is a matter for congratulation that the
citizens of California show confidence in the
mines of their own State by investing as liber
ally as non-residents.
While nearly all other industrial pursuits
are stagnant and unprofitable, that of mining
seems to have proved profitable and remuner
ative during the past few years. Statistics
show that of all the industrial occupations
minine is the most profitable. The average
annual product or earning ppr capita, in Cali
fornia, of thuse engaged in farming is about
$300; in manufacturing, including its boun
ties, about $1000; in miniim, with all its bur
dens and penalties, nearly $1500. And yet
many people denounce the business of mining
as comparatively precarious and unprofitable.
The censuses of 1894 aud 1896 of those en
gaged in mining, milling, quarrying, well
boring, etc, prepared from the reports of our
field assistants, show an increaie of over 40
per cent during the past two years. It is t>os
sible that some hundreds of white men and
Chinese were not enumerated, inasmuch as
many work alone, ground-sluicing or rocking
in 'ravines remote from the mines and the
roads.
The report shows that 13.765 men were
engaged in mining in 1893-94 arnji that thÂ«
number was increased to 19,508 in 1895-90.
Re;, arding the localities mat have reaped
benefits from the influx of capital, Mr.
Crawford says:
While gold still continues to be by far our
largest mineral product, the annual value of
our non-metallic substances has now reached
$ 1.348,280; hydrocarbons and pnses, fgl 404,
--3:21, and structural materials $2,713,755. It
is worthy of note thai in addition to the pre
cious me taiH there were thirty-six other min
eral substances produced. From the above
table it ia evident that the great increase waa
due to tlie mining of preciou? metals.
The attention of investors has not been aW
tracted to any one particular section, but
every gold-producing county shÂ»red in the
general prosperity. Trinity and Shasta coun
ties on the north have been particularly
favortd by large investment of foreign capital,
and the operations of the Mountain Miner
Company (Limited) have directed the atten
tion of prospectors and others to copper, and
its exploitation is a?ain becoming quite gen
eral. The mother-lrde belt, which extends
through a number of counties in the State, has
become a favorite field for investors in gold
bearing properties, and some eigantic opera
tions are in progress and contemplation. The
demand for the Bureau's geological map of
the mother lode exhausted the supply, and a
new and corrected edition was issued last
spring. All mineral patents granted to January
1 of this year, and so much of the "Mariposa
grant" as could be delineated upon ihe map
without changing' its form, have been added.
There have been numerous "mother-iode
maps" issued within the past year by private
parties, but the demand for our map Con
tinues.
So great an interest has been taken in the
subject of the mother lode tuat the lectures of
our curator. Henry S. Durden, and H. \V. Fair
banks, Ph.D., drew respectively large audi
ences: Mr. Fairbanks has kindiy revised his
notes, and his very interesting and useml pa
per, "Ore Deposits, With Esp-cial Reierence
to the Mother Lode," is printed In the latter
part of this volume. The close study Mr. Fair
banks has given to this subject while in the
employ of the bureau makes him an authority
and his paper valuable. South of Tehachapi
the same general interest prevails. In Kern
County, forty-five miles east of Mojave, a new
district was formed during the winter of 1895
--9b and some very promising ledges located
If the ledges hold with depth, Randsburg will
become an important mining center, although
it experiences serious drawbaCKs In scariitv of
both water and fuel. The outlook ior River
side, San Bernardino and San Diego counties
is promising, and the last of the three boasts of
having a mill (Golden Cross) containing the
greatest number of stamps (100) under one
roof in the Slate, although the total plant (140
stamps) is equaled by the Utica-Stickle.
Particular attention is called to the list Ot
ml^is inserted at the end of each county un
der the head ot "Gold," which has been pre
pared fromthe notes of our field assistants.
The report shows the results of ru.ning
by counties, and covers alt classes of pro
duction, from bituminous rock to gold. It
will be forwarded to any citizen of Cali
fornia for 17 cents and to those outside of
the State for $1. The data submitted will
probably attract considerable capital to
the Golden "West.
Some of the orders for books sent to
.London publishers by country correspond
ents are highly amusing. One boookseller
wrote for a work by "Harry Stockles "
when he wanted something of Aristotle's*
another who wanted "Gnudeamus " by
Farmer, asked for "God aim us.' by a
larmer," and a third sent a request for
"Pharaoh's Life of Christ," when ho
wanted Dean Farrar's celebrated work.TO PURIFY THE
MILK SUPPLY
The Dairymen's Union
. Drafts a Tubercu
losis Bill.
â It Provides for the Inspection
.. " . of Dairies and Dairy
Cattle.
â¢ A Measure Rendered Necessary by
the Spread cf Disease Garms
j . in Impure Milk.
- : . â 
. . The Dairymen's Union has drafted an
. . â â¢important bill on tuberculosis, which will
â be introduced into the Legislature during
â¢â ' the forthcoming session.
This is a step the necessity for which
-. ..can, no longer be disputed. Medical men
v.re almost unanimous in declaring that
â¢ : - impure miik has in the past been directly
... 'responsible for the spread of disease
. germs, and particularly those of tubercu
..â â¢â â¢ losis, or, as it is more frequently termed,
'- consumption, among children and adults,
.". and nave repeatedly urged that the health
.of the community imperatively demanded
"*â¬ t be scientific inspection of the milk
': supply.
'" A step in this direction was taken in
.this City by appointing a milk inspector.
The duties of that functionary, however,
do not extend beyond the boundaries of
the municipality and it is now considered
obvious that a measure must be framed
. which will strike at the root of the evil, to
. the extent of rendering municipal super
vision practically unnecessary.
The bill which has been drafted by the
' Dairymen's Union has this laudable ob
ject iv view. It empowers and requires
the general agent of the State Dairy
. Bureau to inspect all dairies and cream
: cries in the State together with all dairy
cows at least once a year, and makes pro
â¢. vision lor the .destruction or segregation
. of diseased animals, as may be deemed
necessary.
It also deals with the supply of. dairy
products by retail, and imposes penalties
lor any violation of its provisions. Fol
lowing is the text of the bill in full:
An act to provide for the inspection of dai
ries as to tbe health of the stock, aud of cream
eries as to their snnitary condition; to prevent
the sale of milk, butter or cheese lor drink or
food to tl>e people of this State, made from

DEACON BLUNT`S RECORD
Missed Church Only Twelve
Times in TwentyÂ« Five
Years.
A Pillar of the First Baptist Church
Said to Be Failing-A Week
of Prayer.
During the services at the First Baptist
Church, on Eddy street, yesterday morn
ing, the pastor, Rev. M. P. Boynton, an
nounced to the congregation that it was
feared that Deacon Phineas Underwood
Blunt, an old police officer of this City, {
ana a long-time pillar of the church, is in
extremis from advanced age. Deacon j
Blunt is a pioneer. His record as a ,
:hurob-goer, even while a policeman, is
probably not equaled by any man alive.
tie is certainly the patriarch of church
:oers in California. He has been ill for!
wo years, but, it is said, was no time so |
eeble as he is now .
Mr. Blunt was born July 27. 1809, in
New England. He lived in Boston for a ;
lumber of years, was converted and ;
joined what is now the Clarendon-street I
Baptist Church, on June 3, 1827. In 1849 j
he came to California over the plains and
went to the mines. Coming to this City
;n 1864, he identified himself with the I
First Bapiist Church, and has been ai
nember ever since, except an intermission j

TO AND FROM JERICHO
Bible Pictures the Text for an
Address by Rev. Haskett-
Smith.
A Historic Tr p Used as an Illustra
tion cf th? Path Trodden by the
Sinner ard tbe Good.
The Rev. Haskett-Smith gave another
address at the Young Men's Christian As
sociation yesterday afternoon. In intro
ducing his subject he remarked that it
was a favorite device of some great artists
to paint sets of companion pictures, where
by the moral lesion intended to be con
veyed is enforced by the means of con
trast.
The Bible Is, as it were, he said, a vast
picture-gallery of sacred scenes and sub
jects; and, if we examine it carefully, we
often come across such companion pic
tures. Two of these he held np to view.
The first was painted by Christ himself,
and a sad and melancholy picture it was.
It represented a man on a lonely and deso
late road, surrounded by a band of blood
thirsty robbers, who were illtreating and
despoiling him. "A certain man went
down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell
among thieves."
Any modern traveler who takes this
journey has a partial illustration of the
force of this picture. For, in the first
place, the road is still considered to be so
dangerous that no Europeau or American j
travelers are allowed to venture upon it
except under a duly qualified escort, for
fear of the Bedouin Arabs who iniest those
districts, in the second place, so literally
is it a going down that in pas ing from
Jerusalem to Jericho, though the distance
as the crow fiies is barely nineteen miles,
the road descends no less than 4000
feet. Jericho is absolutely the lowest in
habited place on the earth's surface, being
1300 feet below tbe level of the sea, and it
is therefore intensely hot during the
greater part of the year.
In f;ict, as Mr. Haskett-Smith humor
ously remarked, he never fully realized the
force of the saying, 'Go to Jericho,' 1 until
he actually went there. Jerusalem is
alwt.ys taken in the Bible as the type of
heaven, so that tbe man in the first pic
ture is intended to represent the sinner
on the downward path, with his back to
heaven and his face toward Tophet.
In the companion picture he intro
duced a group of people on the same
identical road, but the contrast was re
markable and complete. A man, as be
fore, is in the center of the group; but
those surrounding him are not foes, but
friends, and at the head of the band
walked one, the best friend of all, Jesus of
Nazareth himself. They are journeying
upward, not downward; their backs are
toward Jericho, their faces toward Jeru
sa em.
The central figure is Bartimaeus, until
lately blind and beggared in the city of
Jericho, and who, havine received his
sight, is following Jesus in the way. He
is, therefore, the type of the converted
sinner on the uphill' path toward heaven.
From these two pictures tbe preacher
drew many instructive and forcible les
sons, illustratinK his remarks in such an
interesting and eloquent manner as to
enchain the attention of every member of
the large congregation, which seemed
deeply impresjed by the earnestness and
power of tbe aatiress.
This evening Mr. Haskett-Smith com*
mences his course of oriental entertain
ments, illustrated by nnique stereopticon
views, prepared principally from photo
graphs taken by himself and colored by
an eminent artist. The subject for thi*
evening has the fascinating title, "From
Joppa to Jericho, With JSight Old Maids
and a Nervous Bachelor."

MANY MEN FOR
MANY PLACES
Oistrict Committees Are
Wrestling With Politi
cal Problems.
Recommendations That Will Be
Made to Supervisors â Fifty
Men for Each Place.
Eeginning of the Interesting Lesson
of Struegling for Easy
Positions.
The patronage committees of the sev
eral Assembly districts have held several
meetings, during which they wrestled
with the problem of appointments. There
are from forty to fifty applicants for each
place under the new City government.
The last meeting was held last Saturday
night, continuing tiil a late hour.
Street Superintendent-elect Ambrose
has decided to give ten places to the
Twenty-ninth District, ana if the sug
gestions of the committee prevail the
places wiil be rilled as follows: Paver, P.
Lydon ; sewerman, J. Lally; rammer, E.
Coakley; inspector, John Mannix; orick
layer, James Colbert; laborers â Richard
Carlin, John F. O'Rourke, John Lovelie,
Henry Hays and Daniel Qainn. James
Brannan was recommended for appoint
ment as gardener; Henry Sheetian,
painter in. the School Department; Joseph
liuinn, janitor of the License Collector's
office, and Joseph P. Mogan, sten
ographer in the office of the Board of Edu
cation.
For the Thirty-sixth District recom
mendations arc: Peter Quinn, deputy in
Street Department: sewerman, Frank
Tuite;Jpaver,Tbomas McGrath; laborers-
John Lawler, N, Molloy, P. Nolan, J.
Manning, J. Dealhy an<i J. Muller; jan
itors, new City Hall â John Kelly, John
Kenny, Thomns Casserly and Thomas F.
Barry; driver police patrol wagon, James
McCormick.
The committee in the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict recommended Edward Duff for en
gineer of the new City Hal); Michael
Whaien, janitor; Henry Eli, janitor; Louis
RattiÃen, driver of patrol wÂ«Â«on ; Edward
Buike, gardener of Alta pJaza; Samuel
Holiowell and John Cavanagh, laborers in
the trchool Department; John Glavina
vich, foreman; Joseph Currington, James
Madden ami John Roberts, laborers, and
Michael Hendy, inspector, in Street De

B ard of P^Uucaiion; Thomas H. Conboy,
foreman in Street Department; E. J.
Forsier, janitor in Tax Collector's office,
and A. M. Gault, janitor in School De
partment.
These are only recommendations to the
Board of Supervisors for appointment,
but, of course, they go a long way. Other
caucuses, and in all probability many of
them, are yet to be held before the ques
tion of patronage will ba settled.
The following committees of the board
have been 'iecided upon :

KOREA'S KING.
His Throne the Kivy of the Powers of
the 1 us!.
The King of Korea is not a happy man.
Despite the fact that his country bears the
poetic and soothing name of "The Land of
the Morning Calm, !l his existence for the
past tifteen or twenty years has been ex
exciting. It has been a continued round
of sanguinary palace revolutions, of assas
sinations of relatives and dignitaries on
the staff of this Oriental monarch, of plots
and conspirac.es without number, and,
above all, of more or less successful at
tempts to kidnap his own sacred person.
The different and conflicting political
factions of his countrymen have each kid.
naped him in turn, ho, too, have the
Chinese, the Japanese and the Russians
The latter have had him for some time
past in their possession, a privileged pris
oner at the Muscovite Legation. Accord
ing to dispatches some of his own sub
jects have been endeavoring to recover
possession of him and restore him to his
royal palace.
He is a weak ami vacillating man, influ
enced entirely by the persona who happen
to De with him for the t:me being. Dur
ing his long minority lie was dominated
by his father, a wicked old prince who
tortured and killed missionaries, and who
by his savage and reactionary policy
forced upon the foreign powers the first
opening of the country. He has put to
death thousands of persons, has himself
been twice kidnaped and deported, and
on one occasion almost succumbed
to determined at temps to blow him
up with gunpowder. It is he who is sup
posed to be at the iiead of the present con
spiracy 10 kidnap the King, his son, from
the Russian -Legation. As long as the
monarch remains under the eye of the
Czar's Envoy the latter's influence is pre
dominant, whereas that of the Prince is,
of course, nil.
The circumstances under which the
King was conveyed to his present quar
ters were sufficiently dramatic even to
satisfy those inured to the sudden upsand
downs of Oriental government. The King
was at the time entirely under the in
fluence of his wife, a woman of extrordi
nary strength of character, and who had
distinguished herself by her pronounced
opposition to the control the Japan
ese at one time exercised over her
husband and his kingdom. See
ing their power on the wane, and
rightly attributing the cause thereof
to the QueeD, a palace was
organized by the Mikado's Jinvoy. The
royal abode was invaded in the middle of
the night by a band of assassins, among
whom were recoznized Japanese officials,
soldiers and colonists. The King was
seized, while the Queen was literally
hacked to pieces in the court yard, two of
her nieces anil favorite companions being
burned alive on the same spot. In the
midst of al! the turmoil a party of Rus
sian sailor 3 appear d upon the scene, and,
kidnaping the King, carried him off to
the Russian Legation, where he has since
remained n prisoner.
Corea's independence would long since
have been destroyed had it not been for
the jealousies that prevail among the
various powers of the Orient and Occident
with regard to its possession. The Jap
anese are anxious to have it, not only on
account of its enormous but as yet no un
developed mineral wealth, but also be
cause it practically commands the Jap
anese Arcnipeiago, and, in the hands of
any powerful nation, such as Russia, En
gland or even China, would constitute a
perpetual menace to the laud of the
Mikado. The Chinese are desirous to
have it, because its occupation by ator
eign power is a peril to the northern por
tion of their empire.
The Russians need it as a tei minus for
their trans-Siberian railroad and as an all
the-year-round headquarters for their
navy and army on thÂ« snores of the Pa
cific. England, Germany and even the
United States are anxious to prevent any
foreign power from getting hold of the
kingdom ani closing it to their trade. It
may be added that the only foreigners for
whom the Kins has ever shown any re
gard and confidence have been Americans,
and up to within four years previous to
the outbreak of the war between China
and Japan the influence of the United
States predominated at Seoul. â New York

CHILDREN MADE HAPPY.
Father McGinty of the Church
of the Holy Cross Plays
Santa Claus.
The 325 Scho'ars of His Large Sunday-
School Each Gat a Handsome
Christmas Present
There were 326 happy children at the old
Church of the Holy Cross in calvary Cem
etery yesterday morning. Father Mc-
Ginty was their Santa Claus, and each one
of the scholars who attend the Sunday
school of the Church of the Holy Cross re
ceived either a beautiful book or a holy
picture, together with a box of delicious
candy.
At the same time and place the most de
serving of the boys of the Sanctuary Society
were awarded premiums for proficiency
and punctuality. The highest honor was
won by Master John Boyle, and he re
ceived a gold medal in token of his pastor's
appreciation.
Their were fcur silver medals, and these
prizes were carried off by: Masters Wil
liam Golden, Daniel Burns. William Boyle
and James Ennght. These altar-boys are
highly commended by their pastor for
painstaking uttemion to their duties-.
Father McGinty promised twenty-seven
silver medals for prizes to be competed for
this year. Each scholar who stands at the
head* of a class will receive a silver medal
and there are '27 classes.
The meeting at the old church was
simply a Santa Claus affair and nothing
was done except the distribution of tlie
Christmas gifts. Jt was probably the last
time the children will gather in the old
church in the cemetery, for the building
is soon to be torn down to allow the con
templated improvements along the front
of the cemetery to be built. The Sunday
school will be held in the Church of the
Holy Cross on Eddy street hereafter, but
the time of d:iy has not yet been arranged.
Father McGioty states that the number
he gives for tbis large Sunday-school, 325
scholars, means that this many regularly
attend.
HOMESICK HIPPOPOTAMUS.
It Longed for the Language of Its
Childhood Home.
During Bayard Taylor's visit to the zoo
logical gardens in London be noticed a
hippopotamus which lay in its tank ap
parently oblivious of its surroundings.
Entering into conversation with the
keeper one morning, he was told that the
creature refused to eat, and was gradually
starving itself to death, says the Watch
man. "I fancy it's homesick," added tha
keeper. "He's a flue specimen, and it
seems a pity we should lose him, but he's
moped ever since the keeper who had
charge of him on board, the steamer left.
He pays no attention to anything I say."
Learning that the creature came from a
part of Afric3 he had once visited, Mr.
Taylor, on an impulse, leaned forward and
addressed it in the dialect used by me
hunters and keepers of that region. ' The
animal lifted its head, and the small eyes
opened. Mr. Taylor repeated his remark,
when what does Mr. Hippo do but paddle
slowly over to whÂ«re he stood. Crossing
to the other side of the tank, the experi
ment was repeated with the same result,
the poor thing showing unmistakable
signs of joy, even consenting to receive
food from the hand of his new friend.
Mr. Tayior paid several visits to the
gardens, being always noticed by his
African friend. Finally, before leaving
the city, he taught the keeper a few
sentences he had been in the haDit of ad
dressing to the hippopotamus, and went
his way.
Two years later he was in London, and
curious to know the result, again paid his
respects to his amphibious friend. To his
surprise, the creature recognized his voice
at once, and expressed his joy by paddling
from side to side of his tank after his
visitor.
Bayard Taylor says that it convinced
Lim that even a hippopotamus may have
affections, and tenacious ones at that, as
well as a good memory.
AN OLD 'MOSAIC.
Three Human lignres Unearthed by a
Party of Soldier* in Tunis.
After Italy and Provence there is no
| country where Rome has lef : more monn-
I merits in every state of preservation or
I decay than In Tuni3, says tho London
i Daily News. The largest Roman circus
after Colisseum is El-Djem, Aries ranking
next and Niraes comins? forth. At a recent
Bitting of the Academy of Inscriptions in
Paris M. Boissier, our correspondent says,
gave an account of a remarkable Roman
discovery at Suaa, in Tunis. The French,
who, unlike the English in Ejrypt, have
settled down in Tunis for good, have got a
camp at that seaport which is "a mine of
mosaics," where fresh discoveries are
made every year.
The other day a party of soldiers dig
ging foundations unearthed a mosaic with
three human figures in a perfect state of
preservation, covered with only a few
inches of soil. It is only three and one
half feet square, but the subject, "Virgil
Writing the JEneid." will interest aiL
There 13 a frout v;ew of the poet loosely

With his right hand on his breast, the
forefinger pointing upward, his head erect
in an inspired attitude, he listens to Clio
and Melpomene, who, standing behind,

The Supreme Council, which whs In special
session two days and one ntxht in Philadelphia re
ceutly, transacted a great deal of business and
made impor ant changes in tbe laws affecting tbe
membership of the order.
Two classesâ a and Bâ have been created. Each
class will be assessed separately and each will
haw to pay its own obliga ions in the matter of
death losses. Tbe rates for class B are the same
as those of what is now Known os the "Table of
]f-95." All whft were members of the order on |
Urn Ist ins:, have been placed iv Cluss B, and the I
assessment for the current month is the same on i
all members, the ram being ihe same us during
tbe past year.
Up to the Ist of ie\t July all who desire can
transfer to clufvs A on application, but af.er thai
date none who h is reached the age of bO will be
c iglbie. Those under that age will after that date
in- .MwibU' If they pass a satisfactory medical
examination.
For ilÂ»ss A a table based on the natural pre
mium plan has been adopted. It in one th.v has
been aaopted bÂ»- many of ibe fraternal und asjess
in- tit orgÃUiz:it ons and consider -d oue of tbe
safest plans extant. Under this plan the rate
increases each yeur until tbe age of t>o is reached,
when it remains fixed at tbe amount of that year.
Another cbHiige is in regard to reinstatements.
In the past a susp ii'le.l member could be re-
Instated at any time wl.hin sixty days after sus
pension, but now there can be no reinstatement
without a medical examination. If a suspended
ruemlier U over 60 yeais of age his reinstatement

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the â¢mount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Jsobars, or solid
lines, connect po.'n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. lne
word "hieh" means hls?h barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low
rt-fers to low pressure, and is uoually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In thÂ« interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low- Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lmprob
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected In summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

judgment may dictate when silting as a
SUPERVISOR MITCHELL, the Only New Member of the Board
Who Refused to Relinquish His Right of Judgment in the
Matter of Assessments.
member of the County Board of Equaliza
tion.
Whatever may be done by tbe Board of
Equalization ior the next two years will
either have to Oe agreeable to the corpora
tions whose property ie affected or it will
k have to co to the cou.ts. In fact, accord
' ing to Mr. Mitchell's statement, the new
Supervisors have already decided that
tbev will stand by Assessor Daiton's ac
tions, whatever they may be.
Assessor Dalton has certainly carried
out his anti-railroad and anti-corporation
policy that he formulated prior to his
c ection two years ago, but bis promise to
reduce taxes of smaller property-holders
. twenty-five per cent has not been carried
out, and if not performed during the
coming two years will materially affect
tne campaign of '98. In view of this. Mr.
Mitchell says an attempt was made by
interested parties to tio up the incoming
Supervisors in Daiton's interest.
"lam tbe only unpledged member of
the Doard," said Mr. Mitchell this morn
ing. "A friend of Assessor Dalton at
tempted to compel me to sign a pledge to
support the Dalton assessments regard
less pf what they were, in order to get the
matter before the courts. I do not be
lieve the courts have any business with
the assessments. The Board of Super
visors, sitting as a board of equalization,
is supreme. I will be lair. I'll not abuse
â¢ tbe Southern pac fie because it is not pop
ular, nor will I allow them any special
privileges.
"I did not sign the pledge and then Dai
ton's friend went to Frank Leach and
even to my friend T. M. Romnson, and
tried to gain me, but ttiey found the job
would not work. This ardent friend of
Dal.'on's is a member of the committee of
twenty-one who will appoint the dele
gates to the n-xt Republican municipal
convention. If I don't know the value of
Jana in Alameda County as well as any
Sui.erior Judge or ordinary jury lam
badly mistaken. The people had confi
dence enough in my business ability to
elect me, and I propose to use the same
judgment in the board that I have in my
own business
"I think Mr. Dalton has made a good
r rticial, but 1 do not feel like subordinat
ing my judgment and the confidence of
/ the people to any one "
4 "This statement of Mr. Mitchell," said
" a. county official to-day, "is one that de
mands investigation. If it can be sub
stantiated it is certainly a violation of the
spirit of the purity of elections law. ana
should be investigated by the Grand Jurj.
To attempt to tie up men who are en
trusted w;th such responsibilities 83 Su
pervisory in the interests ol individuals or
of corporations is a very serious affair. It
ienks as though the railroad people had a
hand in it."

BERKELEY'S TRACK TRAINER.
BERKELEY, C al., Jan. 3.â Al Lean, one of the best known athletic trainers
on the coasi, who was formerly with the Acme Club of Oakland, but who is
now employed as trainer for the Reliance Club, has been secured by Captain
Everett J. Brown to coach the University of California track athletic team in
preparation for the spring intercollegiate meet and the coast championship.
He will commence work with the Berkeley men on March 1.
Lean is i he first professional trainer who has ever been secured to coach
the U. C. track athletes, and much interest centers in the result of his work
with them. The wonderful score which the Stanford sprinters and weight
men ran up against the Berkeley team in the last intercollegiate meet has
caused the latter to become apprehensive lest the Paio Alto athletes should
wrest from them the track and field championship. From a score of 45 by the
Palo Alto learn in 1895 as against 67 by the Berkeley team in the same contest
the former brought up their record to 56 points in 1896, thus tying the U. C.
team. The boast made by some of the Stanford men since the intercollegiate
football game, which proved so disastrous to the U. C. eleven, that Berkeley
will never win another contest of any sort from them, has been rankhnt; in
the breasts of the blue and gold adherents, and there seems to be danger of
something more than mere friendly rivalry when the two universities meet
again. During the spring term four important contests will take placeâ the
debate for the Carnot medal, the annual intercollegiate debate, the track
championship games and the series of baseball contests. The Stanford men
touch a very lender point in the hearts of the Berkeley students when they
speak of the Thanksgiving game, and but little seems necessary to kindle
the spark of jealousy into a flame of hatred and scorn
In view of the defeat administered by Stanford and the vaunts which have
emanated from them the coming contests are looked forward to with extraor
dinary interest.

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 3.â Brigadier
Emma Bown, who is at the head of the

country, addressed a large audience this
afternoon at the First Presbyterian
Church.
'.'Like- flowers . stained with mud" was
the' simile she used when speaking of
those among whom she has labored and
by whom she has been beloved for twelve
years.
A large audience, larger in fact than the
hall could accommodate, was gathered to
bear the little brigadier's talk. In plain,
earnest language (-he told the same old
story ol waywardness, , wickedness and
ultimate disgrace, with the necessity
i thereby occasioned of accepting the help
ing hand of her many lieutenants.
"Do not think that all of those who
come to us for help are naturally bad.
Many of them appear in my sight liko
flowers stained with mud. They are chil
dren who in many cases have been the
victims of other people's sins rather than
!of their own. Young girls often of good
families confide to us tales that society
wuuld doubt, but to all our doors are open
as well as our hearts. I doubt not that
even in this city, where I see so many
church spires, there is ample ueea for
such work as ours."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.
THE MAYOR MAY
MAKE NO CHANGE
He Laughs at the Teapot
Tempest Over Police
Judge.
Major Whitney's Superstition
and Business Interests Are
Allied.
Judge Frick R tires From the Bench
After M king an Honorable
R:cord.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 3. j
The time is past when Mayor Davie, ac
cording to precedent, should have an
nounced his choice in the matter of Police
Judge. He has made no chance and there
does not appear to be any desire on his
part to do so. A pre&t deal hes been said
and published about Mayor Davie's inten
tions in regard to the appointee to succeed
Judge Wood, but it appears that the
Mayor himself, who is naturally the per
son who should know most about it, has
been entirely silent and has derived con
siderable amusement from the numerous
plans gratuitously formulated for aim by
others.
When spoken to on the subject recently
Mayor Davie said he was entirely dis
gusted with tbe amount of trouble that
seme people seem to be taking iv a mat
ter which did not concern them. Although
the patronage of the office is small, it is
not so small but that there are scores of
people who would like to have it. A great
deal has nl-o been said about the political
traae by which Car) Wood went into the
District Attorney's office and Tom Craw
ford was appointed Police Court Clerk.
Carl Wood leaves his office to-morrow
and nothing has been said about a suc
cessor to Police Judge Wood and Clerk
Crawford, but there is more than an infer
ence that they will succeed themselves
The whole affair has been oneol Oakland's
characteristic political teapot tempests.
Major Whitney firmly believes that
Judge Greene, who will succeed himself
on the Superior Bench to-morrow, owes
his last two elections to the influence of
one of the major's horseshoes. Yet, al
though the ex-court commissioner has
studied the doctrine of Daibhuisu in
Japan, he declares he is not (superstitious.
His veracity must be judged by his own
story.
"Those two horseshoes, with nails stick
ing up out of them," said the major,
"have played an important part in Ala
meda County politics for six years.
About hall a dozen years ago I was
wanting the worst way the office of
court commissioner. Mv Buccess de
pended on the election of Judze Greene
and Fred Hensbaw. On the day of the
election, as I was coming down to my
office, I saw two large horseshoes on
Broadway; they had evidently just fallen
from some horse s feet, because ail the
nails were sticking up.
â¢â¢Tnat particular morning I read a slory
of a man who attributed his life's fortune
to the influence of horseshoes, and as soon
as 1 saw those two big shoes in the middle
of the road I said to myself, 'Now, Fred,
there's your luck. One of those shoes is
Greene and the other rienshaw.' I picked
up the shoes, carried them down to my
office, laid them down carefully with the
points up, and sure enough Greene and
Henshaw were elected and I was appointed
Court Commissioner. A year or so later
the janitor in dusting my room had
turned the horseshoes with their nails
down. At that time I was conducting a
suit for heavy damages and I could not
quite understand why things were not
coming my way. I thought of my horse
shoes, rushed to my office and sure enough
they were upside down. I immediately
reversed them, rushed back to court and
the next day the jury brought in a verdict
for $14,000.
"LaÂ«t November I did not care to be
Court Commissioner, but for personal rea
sons I wished to see Judge Greene and
Sam Hall ejected, both being good Kepnb-
Means. Their fight did not look as strong
as I wanted to see it. 1 tried to tind the
cruise for it and sure enough my mind re
verted to thoss horseshoes. I ruahed into
my office and discovered that the janitor
bad again, with "remarkable perseverance,
turned the points down. lat once turned
them over and started for home. Every
body I met lad the same gr> etinp, that
everything was going Greene and Hall's
way, and their ultimate election did not
surprise me."
And the major says he is not super
stitious.
Judge Frick, the youngest wearer of the
ermine in the State, will vacate the Su
perior bench to-morrow, io favor of Judge
Hall. Mr. Frick has left behind him, es
pecially when his years are considered,
one of the cleanest records that is to be
found in the history of Alameda County's
bar.
Daring his career several cases in which
well known politicians were concerned
have come under bis judicial cognizance,
and he has handled them all in sncb a
manner as to leave not the slightest taint
of partiality. Judge Frick retires with
Kood grace. He did not run for office and
faii to receive the support of his party.
He did what several other politicians in
this county might imitate witn credit to
themselves: he made a political promise
a few months a :o and be kept it.
When he entered into the fight for the
nomination of Congressman against Mr.
Hilborn he said that if he were not suc
cessful he would not attempt to retain
himself in office by attempting to succeed
himself as Superior Judge. Oat of 14,000
Republican votes cast at that primary
Mr. Hilborn's majority was less than 1000,
showing thai the younger candidate has a
strong political support in this county.
He took his defeat gracefully and in
such a nianuer as to add to his many
friendships, and although he has an
nounced his intention for the present of
devoting himself to ihe practice of law it
will not be long before he is again heard
from in the political field.
For the past few weeks little has been
heard about the scheme taken in hand by
the Board of Trade to acquire for the city
of Oakland some public parks worthy of
the name. The board has in its posses
sion information relating to many of the
most desirable localities available for such
a purpose, and will soon be in a position to
place, before the City Council ior the pur
pose of ultimate submission to the people
a report which will embody many practi
cal iaeas. It will also contain the sug
gestions of a system by which such
parks can be acquired. There is no
tioubt that the slowness which marks the
development of certain outlying districts
is due in a large measure to the failure ot
tlie municipality to provide healthful at
tractions that would draw around them
new communities.
Only in two directions, northward and
westward, can this be done. Much has
been said about the improvement and set
tlement of the property along the loothills
north of this city, and also of the devel
opment of the Moragii Valley and the ter
ritory on either side of the little Caliiornia
and Nevada Railroad. Now t.attue own
ers are making efforts to open up this
territory is the proper time for the people
to acquire a public demesne of which tliey
will be as proud in future years as San
j Francisco is of its Golden Gate Park.

THE JOHNSON CASE.
Sharpe and Howard in Jail, Awaiting
the Gill's i>.-iiili.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 3.â Some strange
developments were brought to light to
day in the case of Anna L. Johnson. At
the City Prison her sister, Hukta, Dr.
Sharpe and John Howard await in ceils
her death, which is expected hourly.
It is now known that Howard is the
husband of Hulda Johnson, though the
affair has beeu kept a profound secret and
probably would not be known even now
but lor the course events have taken.
It is generally believed that John How
nrd is not the guilty party, but that he is
keeping quiet on the promise tha. nothing
shall be leit undone to save him. It was
stated to-day that tbe cause of Anna's
trouble was her betrayal by a married
man who is providing the necessary funds
to protect the other party and, incidental
ly, himself. It is not probable, however,
that the trial of tne parties now under
arrest can be conducted without the real
tacts coming to lijrht. This is notthe first
case of its kind with which the name of
Dr. Sharpe has been mentioned. There
are many other incidents connected with
the unhappy affair which are in the pos
session ot the detectives.
EOBBED THE ALTAS.
Father Serda's Church Broken Into
Saturday Might.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 3.â Father Ser
da's curch at Temescal was broken into
last night. The burglars entered the
church by a window in the rear and
opened the tabernacle with a skeleton
key. They took therefrom the commu
nion plate, consisting of a chalice and pat
tens and also a little sale in which was a
small sum of money. After leaving the
church the thieves took the little safe,
rolled up in a mat, to Forty-sixth and
Lusk streets and there blew it open. They
left the safe on the corner and made off
with the contents.
The church whs recently presented with
a valuable gold communion service, but
Father Serda look the precaution to have
it kept in the clergy house. It was evi
dently this service that the robbers were
after. About six years ago the church
was entered and robbed in much the same
manner as to-aay.
A Librarian in Trouble.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Jan. aâ The police
were called in early this morning to sup
press a row in the Wilson House. The
trouble originated with Henry Peterson
and his wife, and Officer (Jarson reported
to Captain Wilson that liquor was the
cause of the trouble. Peterson is the libra
rian of the free Library.
A Nicotine Story.
In a book of travels written by a Mr.
Barrow we find this interesting bit ot in
formation: A Hottentot was seen to ap
ply the short end of his wooden tobacco
pipe to the mouth of snake when the rep
tile was darting out its tongue. Death
was instantaneons, the effect almost like
an electric shock ; with a convulsive mo
tion that lasted only for a moment the
snake half untwisted itself and then be
came still. And upon examination the
niuscies were found to be so contracted
that the snake felt an hard as if it had
been dried in the sun. â Harper's Round
Table.
NIKOLAOS THEODORIANITIS.
BERKELEY. Cal., Jan. 3.â Tbeodorianitis, the a?ed GreeK whose won
drous exploits as a sprinter were told in a recent issue of The Call, is a
budding candidate for honors before the footlights. He is soon to go on the
stage in the role of a ballet dancer and high Kicker. His varied experiences
as a long-distance walker, his success as a pacer aeainst time, and his desire
to win further fame for himself before he "shuffles off this mortal coil," as he
says in his own tongue, have convinced him that the stage is his forte. He de
clares that he can dance for an hour and a haif without an intermission. A
well-known merchant in BerKeley has interested himself in Theodorianitis
and will defray the expense of giving him a thorough course in all the latest
dances in which men ordinarily engage.
Theodorianitis, who is now nearly 77 years of age, frequently takes re
markably long walks, and declares be can outdo William Greer Harrison in a
sprint to S.tn Jose. One day last week the old man started out from Vallejo
for Sacramento on foot, expecting to reach there by the next morning. In bis
preparation for the jaunt be left all his spare coin behind him, fearing that he
rniiht be held up on the way. Never baring been to the capital, he knew
nothing of the arm of the bay which must be crossed at Port Costa, nor of the
fare charged on the ferry. When be reached the pier he was confronted by
the ticket agent, who demanded his fare. A lively scene followed. Theo
dorianitis was determined to go aboard. Not being able to speak English, he
was at a loss to know why he was prevented from going 011 hi 3 way. Finally
he came to a knowledge of the facts, and at once started back for Vallejo. A
rainstorm arose and drenched the old man from head 10 foot, but he trudged
on and finally reached Mb starting point, mud- begrimed, cold and shivering.
A VARSITY TEAM
TO BE SENT EAST
Funds to Be Raised by
the Pacific Amateur
Association.
The Winning University to Get
Proceeds of a Great Meet
in April.
Multnomafc, Olympic, Reliance, Stock*
ton and Otber Athletes Also
to Compete
Track and field athletics are to be
boomed this spring, and tbe winning uni
versity team is to be sent East, partly at
the expense of tbs Pacific Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union.
A great, coast championship field day,
to be held in this City some time in April,
will be tbe means of arousing unusual in
terest in true amateur outdoor sports and
at the same time of raising funds for the
Eastern tour.
The Multnomah Athletic Club of Port
land, which is practically an aggregation
of all the best talent of the Northwest As
sociation, will be invited to participate in
tbe contests. The northern men never have
competed down Here, but their perform
ances are well enough known to entitle
them to particular consideration by the
Dest local cracks.*
It is not likely that they will neglect the
opportunity to demonstrate their ability.
Berkeley, Stanford, Olympic, Reliance,
the Stockton Athletic Cub, the Academic
League and other organizations that have
sprinters, runners, junipers, weight
throwers and vaulteis, will be encouraged
to enter their best men and as many of
them as possible, for points will count for
first, second and third places in every
contest.
The idea of this field day with its ulti
mate purpose is thÂ© conception of several
members of the board of managers of the
Pacific Association and W. F. Humphrey,
president of the association. They wish
to give greater encouragement to amateur
games and at tbe same time arouse the
interest that shall result in the develop
ment of y.Mine California athletes to their
best possibilities.
They believe that the material is here
and has only to be found out and devel
oped for this State to assume and maintain
a high and recognized rank for her fine
young athletes, a rank that shall be es
tablished not here alone oy records which
tbe doubting East has long persisted in
questioning, but by performances in the
East in cdrupptition with the crack
athletes of big Western colleges and ama
teur clubs.
One of the new features of the coming
held day will be the introduction of discus
throwing as a regular event now recog
nized in amateur track and field sports in
Ameiica since the revival at Athens last
year of the old Olympic games.
The latest reports of the Amateur Ath
letic Union describe accurately the weight,
size and composition of the discus, so that
clubs of the union and individuals wish
ing to train privately for the event may
have a di-cus made. It is likely, how
ever, that sporting-goods stores will sup
ply the demand, as the dinner- r> ate like
metal disk is being made in the East pur
posely for the new event.
For the last few years California weight
throwers have practically outclassed the
great majority of the weight-throwers in
the Eastern colleges.
It is believed that when discus-throw
ing shall have been practiced by the
young athletes of this coast the records
In this particular event of the athletes of
ancient Greece will not appear beyond the
abilities of the youth of California.
Princeton University, with an athletic
team inferior Ik> that of several other ani
versities of America, competed in the in
ternational games at Athens last year and
not only took first rank among the teams
entered, but in many cases the American
boys beat the best Grecian athletes in
events that were strictly Gr cian.
Definite preparations for the athletic
season will be determined upon by the
board of managers of the Pacific Associa
tion at its meeting next Friday evening.

thoqe of this City, in the enterprise to the
end that the public may belter undr>r>tand
the ability of tlie athletes of California,
and take a deeper interest in seeme the
State hold its own against the combined
East.
The field day will be neld either at Cen
tral Park or at the Presidio athletic
grounds', probably one weeK preceding
the annual intercollegiate games. The
Stanford manager, like the Berkeley man
ager, is heartily in accord with the propo
sition of the field day. for both universi
ties wish to send a team East, and neither
has more than about half the $3000
thought to be necessary for the expenses
of the lour.
Stanford's manager, the well - known
mile runner, Dave Brown, while himself
debarred from further competition against
Berkeley becausb of the four-year inter
collegiate agreement, seems confident
that his team, with iis lonj? list of lresh
men athletes added to the material
among the old men, will have a walkover
in a contest for the honor of representing
California in the East. But there are
others at Berkeley who are saying noth
ing but are sawing wood.
HOW HE RAISED THE $150
Bishop Newman Does a Good
Stroke lor the Epworth
Church.
The Eloquent Divine Preaches on His
Wanderings Around the Holy
City of Jerusalem.
Bishop Newman conducted services yes
terday morning at the Epworth Methodist
Episcopal Church, corner of Twenty-sixth
and Church streets.
At tbe close of bis address, which was
"Memories of Jerusalem," the Bishop got
down to what he designated the real busi
ness of tbe occasion, and informed the
congregation that the Epworth church
was starling in the new year with an in
debtedness of $150. It was only a small
sum and many reputable commercial
firms were less clear than that, but a
church should lead in business as well as
in righteousness, and the debt had to be
paid. They would sing "Dismiss us with
thy blessing" when the collections reached
t:Â»e necessary high-water mark.
On the first round of the collectors over
$100 was donated, though the congrega
tion was not large. A second trial gath
ered in $7 50, and the Bishop sent the
gleaners forth again, with the in iunction
that it would be deplorable if any money
escaped them, and, also, that any person
should leave the church without an oppor
tunity to give.
"We'll sing the doxology when that $150
is raised," said the Bishop. "Give the
people time to think; it takes more time
to think about giving than about receiv
ing."
These humorous exhortations had the
desired effect, and the members of the
church responded till the debt was cleared
away.
Bishop Newman's account of his wan
derings around the Holy City were most
interesting, and he brought vividly home
to his audience tbe scenes pertaining to
the li c of Jesus.
"1 was in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday,
and went out of the city by way of
Stephen's Gate treading in the footsteps of
the Savior. We crossed the brook Kedron
by a stone bridge that was tiiere lSOOye^rs
ago and will remain forever doubtless. We
passed over the brow of the Mount of
Olives and made our way down in to lowly
Bethany. The Arabs call it 'Lazarie.'
Christ never slept in Jerusalem, but re
paired to Bethany to find rest with bis
three friends, Lazarus and the sisters.
When we returned we fancied we could
hear the 'hosannahs' of the people as the
Son of Man passed into the City of David.
"The last place I visited during my
stay in Palestine was the Garden of Getli
sernane. I was reluctant to intrude upon
the place where the Savior suffered that
night of anguish. We rapped at the
small iron eate that gives admittance
into the garden, which was opened by a
Franciscan monk, one of the custodians
of the place. He left us to our medita
tions, and there under thosa historical
palms we threw ourselves down, Mrs.
Newman and I, on our faces and prayed
for the church of him who prayed for his
peopln there so long ago.
"Even in her ruins lives Jerusalem, not
as she was when in the highway of
nations, but in the sacred associations
that are hers forever. The stranger's
mind while there is constantly reverting
to the past. The city has passed through
twenty-seven sieges and its walls have
been rebuilt eleven times. Down under
the pavements of the present svreets are
the old buried cities of Jerusalem, and
the archaeologist digging below the city of
to-day finds tb^e of the yesterdays."
GAMBLING IN EUEOPE.
Baccarat at the Clubs and Petits Che-
vaux in Public.
In Europe, except at Monte Carlo, tab c
Rambling, such as roulette and rouge et
noir, has long ago disappeared. Of
course, baccarat, which is to the European
gambler what draw poker is to the Ameri
can, is played in the clubs and other se
cluded places, often for very high stakes.
But the laws are everywhere rigid against
public gambling, and so the Casino people
have to resort to other agencies for amus
ing the stranger and lightening his purse,

racecourse arranged to run by electricity.
Nine horses are placed. Nine folded

numbered from one to nine. The price

track at breakneck speed, but separating
as they go. When tht momentum is ex
hausted one horse is found to be in t:.e
lead. He who holds the number corre
sponding to this horse gets the pool, less
two portions held back for ths bank. To
vary this scheme of open and flagrant
robbery, boats are sometimes substituted
for horses, and a yacht race takes tbe
place of a horse race. Thus a man is
given the option of losing his money on
water equally with thac of losing it on
land. Such a game could never have ex
isted in America. It is too simply, ob
viously and absurdly aeainst the player.
But at last ttÂ»e fat-witted European,
along with trie gullibie stranger, has got
onto it, as the saying is, and les petita
chevaux and autour dv lac no longer suf
fice to lure the unwary. But even in Eu
rope there is a certain progress. So the
Casino people have added to their old
racecourse "layout" an appendage or an
nex which locks very much like gambling.
This is on either side of the machine or
table, on which in bright gold figures ap
pear the numerals to correspond with the
horses. You bet on one of these num
bers. There are nine of them. If
you win you get 5 to 1. If you bet
on three in a buncli you pet even
money. In order to show, however,
that this is not gambling, there is a
liiui â from 1 to 5 francs, according to the
wealth and size of the casino or kursaal.
I am told that at the more ambitious of
these and late at night, when the hetero
geneous crowd has gone, there is a good
deal of very steep rolling. But as I never
sit up late at night I can give no direct
testimony on this point.
It will be seen at once that the sole
merit of this method of pretending not to
gamble lies in the bold, transparent rob
bery which it embodies. It 13 worse than
a mock auction or a church raffle. If I
wanted to teach a child to be a sport and
to plant In its youneand tender bosom ths
thoroughbred's love of gambling, 1 would
bring him here and stake him. â Letter

Courier-Journal.

MARKET REVIEW
Prospects Much Brighter
Than They Were Twelve
Months Ago.
Confidence Is Better Restored and
There Is a General Desire
to Do Something.
The Present Year Will Probably Bring
Forth a Steady Market on a R cog
nized Value Basis.
The first week of a new year always partakes
of a holiday character in business circles and
the present one Is no exceptron to the rule.
At the same time prospects all round are much
brighier than they were twelve months ago.
Confidence is better restored and there is
general desire to do something in almost all
directions and avenues oi trade.
Iv the real estate line the opinion is nearly
unanimous that much greater movement may
be expected. There has been some overhaul
ing of values, but no serious decline has oc
curred anywhere, while in some spots values
have not only well held their own but
actually scored a trifling advance over the
rifeures obtainable during the financial flurry
period of 1890.
Still, the idea seems, to be to go slow and
sure. Money is plentiful, it is true, but in-

vestors want full equivalent, so that it is
hardly possible for anything in the shape of
irflated quotations to develop in real estate
transactions. A steady market on a recog
nized value basis is best ior all concerned,
and it looks very much as if tbii would be the
bituation during the year just entered.

SETTLEMENTS OF COUNTRY LANDS.
Statistics show that nearly seven-twelfths of
the increase of population to the United States
during the past ten years have congregated in
the cities, and this tendency to flock to the
city has been increasing for many decades.
The ratio of inequality is increasing with
! such a degree of rapidity as to be alarming.
i It is estimated that while the population of
this country has increasedjtwelve-told since
the year 1800. the inhabitants of the cities in
creased ninety-fold. This problem is perhaps
more perplexing in California than elsewhere,
as more than 50 per cent of this State reside in
the cities.
It is claimed that this extensive proportion
of the population of the city indicates an ex
cess of non-producers. The fact that the in
equality Is becoming cfenter all the time
i shows the necessity of usiug every lpgitimnte
means of settling up the available tanning
lands of the State.
For this reason, if for no other, the effortsof
those land companies which are inducing ini
umraiion from" among the farming classes of
other States to come among us and help us de-
velop the manifold resources of our country
lands by maintaining Eastern office.- ami dis
tributing literature wi:h regard to this State
are deserving of consideration at this time.
Spencer C. Buckbee of Shainwalct, Buckbee
& Co., which firm i< about to open up some
extensive tracts in California for colonization
purposes, has the following to say in a recent
interview on the subject of colonization:
"Under proper management the successful
colonization of the large holdings of desirable
Caiiioruia lands can be carried out. But it
must be done through a different medium
than that generally engaged in at 'he present
time. In tne first place we must offer to those
who really want a nome in California that is
. attractive, self-sustaining and profitable, lands
I on which such a home can btj made. This
means that we must offer them our hest lands.
"If we do this there wil! be few disappoint
ments, for thera are but few places in the
world where the hotnemaker can cet such a
reward of fruit, flowers aid vegetables for his
labor as in California. Then again, if we suc
ceed in this great movement we must take a
friendly interest in those who come among us
to make their homes, and see that they have
the benefit of our experience, at least. This
will c: able them to get the best results of their
efforts by having all their development work
done in the proper time and proper manner.
In short, we should be just as anxious to see
! our colonists succeed as to sell them our
i lands."
AURORA AND 70 BELOW ZERO
During Winter in the Yukon the Day
Is Only Four Hours Long.
Daring the winter months the aurora on
the Yukon is very brilliant and intensely
beautiful. It commences early in the fall,
and lasts, with more or le,ss brilliancy,
throughout the long arctic winter. It
generally begins upon the setting of the
sun, although in midwinter it has some-
I times been so bright that it was v s.ble at
noon while the sun was shining brightly.
The rays of the light first shoot forth with
a quick, quivering motion, are then gath
ered, and form a great arch of fire spanning
the heavens, it glows for an instant like
! a girdle of burnished gold, then, unfold
; ing, great curtains of light drop forth,
i says the Alaska News.
These royal mantles of bright orange,
green, pink, rose, yellow and crimson are
' suspended ana waved between heaven
and earth as with an invisible hand. The
rapid gyrations and scintillations of light
and blending colors are intensely bewil
dering and superbly beautiful. The wbole
phenomenon of waving wreaths, flickering
dames, rays, curtains, fringes, bands and
flashing colors, the strange confusion of
light and motion, now hign in tne heav
ens, t! en dropping like curtains of gold
and silver lace, sparkling with a wealth of
rubies, sapphires, emeralds and dia
monds, penetrating dark gulchesand dart
ing through somber green forests, lighting
the wnolft landscape as with a thousand
electric lamps, forms a picture of which
words can convey but a very poor idea.
This un warming ligh, as'i! flashes along
the frozen river, the great banks of snow,
and reveals the huge mountains of glist
ening ice and black lines of fir, indeed is
of the purest arctic cast, and causes one
to button his coat closer over his chest,
and with a shiver he isglad to seek a light
of less brilliancy, but one of life-giving
warmth.
At the breaking up of winter the hours
of mnshine are rapidly increasing, and
continue so until midsummer, when the
sun beams forth twenty-two hours out of
the twenty-four, while on the high
mountain peaks it is lor a period of several
days in June not entirely out of sight
during the twenty-four honrp. During the
months of July and August tne weather
becomes very warm and even hot, and
miners are, glad to seek a shady retreat in
which to do their labor.
After this period the hours of sunshine
gradually decrease, until, during the
shortest days, the sun shines but four
hours out of the twenty-four; but at this
period the aurora is very intense, and
helps very material!}' in driving darkness
from that dreary land. The thermometer
registers 70 degrees belov zero in winter,
but the atmosphere is very dry, and con
sequently tne cold is not so arrceptible as
one would imagine. â¢

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.
A NEW PROPHET
ON RELIGION
A Cult Here Predicts the
Early Downfall of the
Ottoman Empire.
J. T. Simcoe P^ses as a Prophet
and Quotes Scripture as
Authority.
The Devotees Meet Every Week and
Revel in Biblical Interpre
tations.
A strange pamphlet has just been issued
by J. T. Simcoe bearing the title
"Shekinah," or "The Story of the God of
Israel," which has the additional assur
ance in the title that "facts are mathe
matically foretold."
From a study of Scripture and a series of
rules and reasons tbe author predicts the
overthrowing of the Ottoman empire on
March 20, 1597. Friends of this society
meet every Tuesday night and discuss the
various evidences of the dissolution.
The pamphlet contains many quota
tion from Scripture and begins with the
following startling sentence:
By measure hath he measured the times and
byjnumber hath he numbered the times, and
he doth not move nor stir them until the said
measure be fulfilled. II Esdras iv:37.
The following is one of the striking par
agraphs of the odd prociuc:iÂ«n and it con
veys a fair idea of the entire context:
The Sultan of Constantinople and the Pope j
of Rome Â«re in an equally lamentable condi
tion and their circumstances ere parallel.
While the Pope has been compelled to accept
the position of a subject's stool, after having
had the chair of royalty snatched from under
him by the King of Italy, and thus left to be
wail a lost kingdom and departed glory, he
can now comfort himself on me principle that
misery loves companyâ with the reflection
that the Sultan of Turkey occupies a throne
which he must soon vacate. These two repre
sentatives of powers, the l<;gs of Daniel's im
age, and the beast ana false prophet of the
Revelation must soon crumble and full to rise
no more forever. In scanning the newspapers,
we find the times are pregnant with events of
dire significance. Many of the leaders in the
nations of the Old World are 6n the verge of
the grave. Queen Victoria is not young, the
Czar of RusÂ«ia sleeps ou dynamite, France is
fevermh and awaits a crisis, Spain and Italy
are in war, Turkey is still committing out
rages on the poor Armenians and Is the Bick
men of Kuroj.e. The whole world is in a con
dition which is favorab'e at any moment to an
entire change and a universal war. A single
night might alter the destiny of the nations.
The author, after discoursing at some
length on probabilities and possibilities,
says:
Statesmen, politicians, scientists, socialists
and all classes of pien are anxious 10 know
the future, and are using all their rowers to
peneirate it. From tneir human standpoint
they take observations, form their conclu
sions, and produce their arguments concern
ing the events of the future, and attempt to
show what will be. But they do not all ar
rive at the same conclusions, some takine into
consideration ths nations of the Oid World,
find their conditions, and seeing the war
cloud which is gathering over them, tell us
that sooner or later they will become in
volved in a general conflict. Some one, per
haps England or Russia, will triumph over
all other nations, and establish an empire
that wM control tne world.
Now, concerning these theories, we say. one
man's opinion is as good as another's, pro
vided both have the same degree of Intelli
gence. But with all man's ability and powers
of reasoning no one is able ol himself '.o fore
cast the future and tell what will occur.
Now, while men are unable to penetrate the
! dartness of the future, Gud has lighted it up
beiore by his prophetic word. Prophecy is
i the only light which sends its rays into the
darkness, and that light shines for us, as Peter
declares: "We have a more sure word of
prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a light that shineth In "a dark
Dlace, until the diiy dawn, and the daystar
arise in your hearts."
The peculiar interpretations of Scripture
put forth by Professor Simcoe aro be
lieved in by many enthusiastic followers,
who discuss the problems at their weekly
meetings. The book which they follow i'sÂ«
fille I with many problems, classified as
semi-religious and mathematical. The
fol owing is an example:
Sixth problemâ 2ss9 : 3763.3 :: 4074 : 6000
2549. The capture of Jerusalem and Pales
tine irom the seventh Canaan nations, and
dividing the land by lot to tne twelve tribes of
the Children of Irruel by Joshua, is to 3768 3
the capture of Jerusalem and Palestine h* Al
exander the Gre't, the first King of Greece
representing the belly and thighs of brass of
Daniel's image, and dividing Jerusalem and
Pak'stne among his people-
As 4074, the legs of iron and feet part of iron
and tart of clay, that part of Daniel's image
which should be the fourth kingdom that
thou-rt rule the whole tarth, which all know
was Rome pan an Â»nd Rome Papal, so at this
I date the Roman Government captured Jerusa-
I lem from the Grecian Government, is to 6000
[ that part of the vision which represents a
stone cut out without handq and smote the
I image on his legs and ieet that were of iron
and clay and Lrako them to pieces.
Therefore the capture of Jerusalem by Joshua
is to ihe Ciipture of Jerusalem by Alexander
as the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans is
to the capture of Jerusalem by Joshua's people
Israel, or the Stone Government thnt fills the
whole earth, the kingdom over which our
blessed Christ will be King when we, the
Christians, are all immortalized.
The work is full of queer problems of the
character indicated by the excerpts given,
and the devotees of the cult have implicit
faith in the accuracy of what their leader
says.
The Location of Eden.
The ancients were as much at variance
as the moderns as to the location of the
Garden of Eden. St. Jerome records v
Hebrew tradition that the garden was
created before tne world came into ex
istence; therefore, it lay beyond its
present limits. Moses Bar Cepha places
it midway between the earth and the
firmament. Another idea prevailing in
the old days located Elen on top of a
mountain which reached nearly to the
moon; another that it was situated in the
third recion of the air, and was higher
(lmn all the mountains of the earth
by twenty cubits, and that was the reason
the deluge failed to reach it. Morinus
held the theory that the whole earth was
paradiseâ was, in fact, jet in Eden, in the
midst of all kinds of iestivities and
felicities.
In Bridgeport, Conn., a bachelor^' club
is attempting to force unfaithful members
to abstain from Sunday pvening courting.
Last Sunday night the club visited houses
where their weaker brethren were making
calls, and abducted the tender-hearted
youths.

Rev. W. D. P. Bliss, the well-known
Christian socialist, who reached San Fran
cisco on Saturday evening, delivered two
important addresses yesterday, in the
course of which he explained tlie objects
of the Church Social Union, and in the
same connection the industrial and eco
nomic evils which serve as the justifica
tion for its existence. St. Luke's Church,
at the corner of Van Ness avenue and
Clay street, was the =cene of both ad
dresses, the meeting announced to take
place at Washington Hall at 8 o'clock
havine t>een canceled. Mr. Biiss is visit
ing San Francisco as a guest of the United
Brotherhood of St. Andrew, to whose
members his afternoon address was spe
cially directed, lie also preached at the
morning service.
Ke preached at St. Luke's Church in
the evening to an unusually large congre
gation. His sermon, which was more
properly speaking a lecture of absorbing
interest to those who have directed any
attention whatever to social and economic
que:?tions, dealt with the subjscis of muni
cipal ownership, the purification o. muni
cipal government and the problem of the
unemployed. The attentive attitude of
his auditor)' throughout clearly signified
that his remarks had created a deep im
pression. , !
He chosefhis text from Revelations xxi,
beginning at the first verse, which reads: j
"And I saw a new heaven and a new |
earth, for the first heaven and the first
earth were passed away; and there was no
more sea."
Mr. 3lis? said: "I spoke this morning
concerning the social teachings of the gos
pel of the incarnation. This evening I
will take some of those principles and see
how definitely and practically we may
work them out in our day, our life and
generation. The problem which to-day is
pressing most heavily upon us is twofold
â the problem of those who are out of
work and the problem of our municipal
life. We shall see in a moment that these
two problems are intimately connected.
"We are told by many that municipal
life is the weak point in our American
civilization. We are told by those who
have most carefully studied our constitu
tional history that our municipal affairs
are scandalously corrupt. Ypur newer
cities by the side of the fair Pacific may
not be so old in corruption or
so bad as some of the cities on the
Atlantic seaboard, bnt San Francisco has
practically the same problem to face as
New York City.
"The problem of the municipality is De
fore us. How are we to make these great
centers of civilization ouey the law of
brotherhood and love? I think you will
realize that the problem is not so much
one of the individual as of the social
system.
"Why are American cities worse than
European? Not becau>e we as individ
uals are worse. In many respects our life
is purer, truer and cleaner than the life of
European cities. Wages are higher, and
in America the life of the family is truer.
Why are our civic functions worse?
"I think the answer may be expressed
in a phrase. In American cities the private
corporation is the dominant factor; in
Europe it is the municipality. In Europe
the municipality accomplishes the large
things.
"It owns, or rigidly controls, the oper
ation of natural monopolies âof local
transit, of heating and lighting. While
here we turn those functions over to pri
vate corporations, and the natural result
is that our abler men, our honest men,
are in the service of those corporations.
We have minimized the function of the
City, with the result that our municipal
councilors are chosen from among our
weaker citizens.
"You cannot, therefore, expect any
thing but corrupt government. But the
problem lies even deeper. Our forefathers
came here from the old world ana this
new country presented abundant scope !
for the individual. The idea of govern
ment became in this way subordinate. It
was at one time seriously proposed in
Massachusetts to do away with the Gov
ernor altogether, Jeffersonian Democrat
and Republican aiike. \Ve nave mini
mized the functions of government and
exalted that of the private individual and
the privat.e corporation. Our hest men
have not attended to their political du
ties, they have not voted and have very
seldom gone to the caucus. This neglect
cives tne profei-sional politician and the
party heelers their opportunity.
"But still, according to our present sys
tem, the private corporation, while ex- I
alted to do great things for the city, is
dependent upon the municipality, which
we have despised, for its franchise or its '
charter. The rich corporation goes to the j
corrupt council and the inevitable result
is that the latter, composed of members
with small salaries, or none atall, finds in
the corporation a chance to sell the fran
chise, and in our larger American eititi
the average franchise is purchased and
the corporation which seeks to purchase it
is too often a debauched institution. This
is not particularly the fault of individuals,
since the average corpoiation. under this
syÃie;n, is compelled to buy its franchise;
the corporation that would be honest
find* itself handicapped.
"It is not enough to denounce the in
dividual: we must denounce the system
and those individuals who have indorsed
it. Those who are to blame are not the
creatures, but the creators, and those are
mjrsell and yourself and everybody who is
giving practical support to the present
system."
Mr. Bliss then proceeded to discuss the
I problem of the unemployed, in which con
. nection, he pictured in eloquent and
! pathetic laneuage the modern struggle to
I procure work.
The laborer who is out of a job finds the
i churches shut but the saloon open, and to
! the noor man, said the speaKer, there
j Romeiiiues seems more brotherhood in
j the saloon than in the church. It was re
j cently stated by a good authority that
; the trades unions and saloons of Chicago
I gave more work than the churches.
He spoke of tho attraction of the saloon
I and its free-lunch system, which leads in
directly to the increase of intemperance.
i The workman out of a job keeps alive on
| free lunches, and then when he does ob
tain work he feels that he is under an ob
ligation to "treat" bick again. "And
| yet," exclaimed Mr. Bliss, "tie temperâ 
â  ance people say that in-emperance is the
j true explanation of the unemployed prob-
I lem."
"The man thus reduced to the point of
starvation grows reckless and sneers at
the church." Mr. B!i*s quoted the statis
tics of Professor Warner as to the causes
of poverty, which go to prove that only 11
per cent of poverty is directly caused by
intemperance; that 75 per cent is there
suit of environment, over which the indi
vidual has little or no control; and that
for 25 per cent the individual is responsi
ble. It is also unfortunate that the char
j ity bureau usually has to deal with the
worst class of tho unemployed, because
| the most self-respecting portion vil! never
b-g until compelled by the slavery of
I actual starvation.
He strongly emphasized the effect of en
' vironment. and declared that a large pro
i portion of the children reared in the
' slums have no chance to develop into real
: manhood and womanhood. They are
J born tired. A Police Court Judge has
! affirmed that almost every child born in
I the New York slums is damned from in
fancy and t>y society io.be an outcast if a
girl, and a thief if a boy.
"Do we wonder then," asked Mr. Bliss,
"that we have some in our land who are
professional deadbeats? It is not by
' charity, but by changing the system, that
Iwe shall bring in God's light of love. The
j remedy in this case is the same as before.
j Exalt the function of the municipality,
which by operating an I controlling these
public enterprises will earn sufficient
i money with which to give work to the un
j employed. At present our civic life leads
in three d'sâ dirt, debts and death rates.
It is true that the debts of some European
j cities are apparently larter than our own,
but they have bama incurred by establish
ing enterprises which now bring in an in
come."
The speaker cited the familiar cases of
| Berlin and Glasgow.
"In America," he resumed, "our debts
| have not been incurred for municipal
| activities, but for municipal inactivities,
! to support ward heelers, for jobs and to
equanuer in the cutter." The money con
tributed by the public to pay for watered
j stock and exaggerated dividends, if
| eiven to the municipality, would
procure worn for idle men from
Maine to California. Mr. B.iss added
that he was strongly of opinion that such
municipal employment should be confined
to residents in the municipality. "More
over," said he, "it should be given out at
1 trades union wages and trades union hours
in order that it may not undercut other
legitimate l.ibor in similar lines. Undrr
our present system the contract jobber
brings in the cheap labor of the foreigner
and our native workmen walk the public
streets in poverty."
With tho adoption of the principle of
corporate ownership San Francisco may
ultimately be made as beautiful as ancient
Athens and possess its free baths, its gar
dens and temples as fair as the Acropolis
of old.
Mr. Bliss finally ndvocated the taxing
of land values, where land is held for
merely speculative purposes. "I cannot
beiieve," he said, "that God gave London
to the Duke of Westminster, New York to
the Astors and California to the Southern
Pacific Railroad."
The fact of inequality among men, be
contended, made brotherhood ami co
operation all the more necessary. If all
men were equal competition might be
just. Theology was the true sociology,
and he came not in the name of Marx or
Bellamy, but in the name of Jesus Christ.
But we cannot even be saved b\' Christ
unless we go out and make our cities the
cities of Christ.
IN THE AFTERNOON.
Rev. Mr. Bliss Addresses the
United Brotherhood of
S . Andrew.
Mr. Bliss devoted his introductory re
marks in the afternoon to a brief
account of the founding of the
Church Social Union in England six
years ago and its subsequent introduc
tion into this country, where it is now
firmly established under the highest au
spices, numbering among its officers
bishops, priests aud prominent laymen of
all classes. Its primary object is to study
bow to apply the moral truths and prin
ciples of Christianity to the social and
economic difficulties of the present day,
and to present Christ in practical life.
Mr. Biiss then spoke at considerable
length of the problems, economic and
social, which confront nineteenth century
society. The amelioration of these, he
declared, must be found in the right appli
cation of Christian and Biblical teaching.
Political economy mid religion must not
clash, but co-operate. The average em
ployer is as helple-s as the average em
ploye, and in order to Jive cannot do
otherwise than pay the lowest price possi
ble for v. specified quantity of labor.
Co-operation among employers has been
the result of these conditions, and the
speaker contended that this co-operation,
if rightly directed among employers as
also among those employed, would help
to relieve the severity of competition, and
in this way prove productive of good.
He spoke of the Old Testament us typi
fying a socialistic state of society. "It is
a book of social righteousness," be said,
"and has too Ion? been misunderstood.
It shows that laud was not owned as pri
vate property, but that every individual
was protected in the use of land and could
only be deprived of it temporarily. I be
lieve that Jesus Christ came to fulfill that
lawâ the land law of the Hebrews.
"In your Cahlornian towns, where you
have had a boom in land, yon have had a
corresponding reaction as God's punish
ment upon those who gambled in that
whic i they had not produced, thus dis
obeying His fundamental law that every
man -hall have access to land."
The speaker further paid that the Old
Testament likewise defended the individ
ual in the use of tools and capital, and
that where such a law was generally ap
plied present day problems could nt)t
exist.
To the misery and the squalor which
prevail in working families, as the out
come of the competitive struggle ior ex
istence, he attributed the first growth of
immorality amoni; young women who, in
the majority of cases, are not actuated by
a desire to make money, but rather to
escape from their sordid surroundings.
Similarly, the typical cry to-day is not
so much lor more money, but for more
work.
The remedy he preached was co-opera
tion â the transformation of the rule of
gold into the golden rnle. The only other
alternative was anarchy. He spoke of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.
good work already accomplished by trades
unions and the acceptance of the orinci
ple of corporate ownership exemplified in
Glasgow.
"We must exalt the municipality," he
said, "until it brings in enough money to
help every idle man."
To the objection often raised that this
will destroy individuality he replied that
it will bring about a higher type of indi
viduality as far removed from the purely
business acumen of the modern Napoleon
of finance as the latter from the physical
individuality of early daysâ the age of
Agamemnon and AchilleÂ°. He earnestly
implored his nearer-* to study these social
questions and to seek to elucidate them.
"God grant," he concluded, "that the
church may find itÂ« young men true to
God and therefore true to man."
FIRE FOR LONG SEE.
The Sullivan Building Damaged to the
Extent of 85000.
Chinatown's most unlucky building,
corner of Sullivan and Baker alleys, which
is owned by the Sullivan estate, was
gutted by fire yesterday morning.
The blaze was etarted, it is believed, by
a falling lamp in the rear of Long Kee's
merctmndise store on the Sullivan alley
side of the building.
The flames soon spread to Quong Chun's
furnishing goods establishment and from
there ate into a cigar-factory owned by
Loo Bon.
Two alarms were sent in from box 25,
the first being rung in at 5:35 a. m., and
the second lilteen minutes later. The de
partment arrived promptly, and after half
an hour's hard labor succeeded in extin
guishing tho flamen.
The damage to the building and various
stocks of goods, which are covered by in
surance, will amount to about $5000.
STOOD UP AND BOBBED.
Joseph Law's Kxperience With Foot
pads on O'Farrell and Mason Streets.
Joseph Law, on his way home yesterday
morning at 4 o'clock, was accosted by two
daring highway robbers on the corner of
O'Farrell and Mason streets and ordered
in a gruff and surly manner to throw up
his hands and permit himself to be
searched.
This command he obeyed, seeing that
resistance would be useless.
While one of the 6treet highwaymen
went through his pockets and relieved
him of ?3 50, all the money he had at the
time, the other stood by, ready to brine
him to time should he attempt any re
sistance.
After robbing him they told him to co
along and make no noise about, the affair.
This advice he need d not, for on meeting
Officers Ring and Baxter he told them of
his experience and at the same time gave
a description of his two new acquaint
ances.
The officers started off in pursuit and,
alter a snort search, found Joseph Corr,
alias "Dutch, " in a house on O'Farrell
street, close to where the robbery occurred.
From the description Riven them they
took him to the Central police station,
where he was fully identified by Law as
being one of the men who stood him up.
H i i companion has so far escaped, but the
officers tliink they will soon have him to
keep Corr's company in the County Jail.
DEATH OP GEORGE HAAS SR.
The Fasning Amy of Another of San
Francisco's Merchants.
George Haas Sr., for many years a well
known merchant of this City, died at his
home, 012 Ellis street, yesterday. He was
a native of Baden, Germany, 56 years of
age.
He came to the United States when
quite a young man and located in Quincy,
111., where he remained for a number of
years, and left there to come to this City
more than a quarter of a century ago.
Some time after his arrival he encaged
in the bakery business, then entered in
the confectionery line in a small way, and
of late years had one of the largest estab
lishments of the kind in the City.
He leaves besides his widow five chil
dren of whom two are dauehters. In his
business relations he was very well liked
by all and in a social way he had many
friends who held him in high esteem.
CAPTAIN TRASFS FUNERAL.
Many Devoted Friends Honor the
Memory of the Deceased Pilot.
The funeral services of the late Captain
Freeman Trask were held at his residence
yesterday afternoon and a large number
of the old friends and associates of the
dead pilot were in attendance.
The floral tributes were numerous and
beautiful, among them being a broken
wheel by the Pilots' Association and a
model of pilot boat 7 by his son.
Captain Trask had a wide circle of
friends among whom he will be sadly
missed, and from whom there goes forth
the tenderest sympathy to the bereaved
widow.
SoroslH Will Xot Receive.

They Fight a Splendid Battle For
Honors on the Lists at Bur
ling.m?.
Now it is "Tally-ho!" and "A-hunting
we will go." The newest and most popu
lar of outdoor sports is following the bay
ing hounds. It may have come to, stay in
California and to be the country sport, for
everybody who owns a horse or can bor
row one may feel the exhilaration of the
hunt. The barn are down, so to speak, as
Walter Hobart, who imported a pack of
foxhounds to introduce fox-hunting here,
has extended a general invitation to the
A Oitical Moment in the Polo Game at Burlingame With the
Ball Flying to Goal.
hunt, and the Burlingame Club has iriven
assurance of a welcome to all should the
"scent" lie across club grounds.
The result of these invitations was seen
Saturday afternoon, when tlie second
drag hnnt was held. All San Alateo was
out. The livery-stable man had one of
the best horses, and merchants and farm
ers turned out after the hounds, side by
side with millionaires and clubmen. And
when the horn blew and trie pac"Â£ rushed
off after an imaginary fox, there were
forty-eight mounted men ready for a
bracing run across the country. So the
hunt was pronounced a grand success, an
event to be remembered.
Every hunter there caught the magni
tude of the chase. The t>By of the fox
hound, like which there is nothing else in
the wide world to a man on horseback,
electrified even those who were complete
strangers to its thrill. Something of a
new and unknown sport was revealed to
them, and the people of San Mateo to-day
swear by the hounds and the hunt.
The course was laid over rolling land,
beginning in the Burlingame part and
running by devious ways, with delightful
lack of direction, to a point west of San
Mateo. Nobody in the hint had the
faintest idea of where the lamb had been
dragged, and consequently the uncertainty
gave zest to the chiise.
One of the best pleased participants
was Joseph D. Grant, president of the Bur
iingame Cluli. He takes a keen interest
in manly country sports, which he desires
to make as popular as possible, knowing
that their popularity must redound to the
benefit of bis club.
"This is a great idea," he said yesterday.
"Everybody is welcome to follow the
hunt and we would like to see more people
from the City fa it. For young fellows
from town what can compare with such
manly sport?
''The club is doing its share to develop
those pastimes that have everything to
commend them â hunting, polo, riding,
driving. They take you into the country
and away from city liie. The ladies are
invariably your companions, and a man
gets splendid exerche. Then again, it is
good for the community; it puts money in
circulation, makes fellows spend a little
in wages and in legitimate channels; it
builds up a nice home life in the country.
"The hunt Saturday was an extraor
dinary success. Mr. Hobari invited every
body who cared to follow the hounds, and
Â«uch a crowd turned out it was surprising.
It was part of the New Year's holiday
I timeâ the best we're had down here. I
believe now that the hunt is going to be
the great sport of California."
Burlingaine Club did not finish with the
New Year celebration Saturday afternoon,
for it entertained many guests yesterday
with a rattling polo game. Apropos of
tne occasion, it would seem, the teams
were arrayed as benedicts aeainst bache
lors. Here it is barely necessary to sug
gest that just as much rivalry existed
upon the coaches as in the field. Among
the ladies there were no especial favorites,
rather a deep, wide chasm, that severe
lineâ matrimony. And, as the married
men were victorious, maidenly prido was
humbledâ hubbies are so much better men
than mere bachelors.
Ti e matrimonial team was composed of
Charles Baldwin, W. S. Hobart, Joseph
Tobin and Perry Eyre; the single men
were Richard Tobin, Captain J. P. Waine
wrighi, Jonn Lawaon and Lawrence Me-
Creery.
From the first tossdown of the ball Me-
Creery made a good hit, knocking the ball
far toward goal, but Joe Tobin tooK it off
four times, only to be met by Hobart with
a rally back to center, where Richard
Tobin dashed into the melee and knocked
the ball outside while trying to make a
goal. Lawson sent it back to Joe Tobin,
who sent the disk flying to Eyre.
A dashing bit of play was made here, as
Eyre led the way down the field amid ap
plause, the teams tearing madly at his
heels. Baldwin came to the rescue and
Hobart followed, taking up the ball twice
and through goal. He was in at the next
>cr;imble, knocking the bail down the
field, which Richard Tobin caught after a
miss, followed by Baldwin taK'njj it to
center. Lawson's pretty hit backward on
a fast gallop changed the play, and after
much hot struggling Captain \Vainewrlghl
knocked the ball away from the players to
goal.
In the second naif of the first period
Wainwright started t <c ball going his
way, though handicapped by an injured
hand. The crooks flew lively and the
white wooden globe had no rest. Baldwin
made a brilliant dash across the field, Ho
bart knocked it outside, Lawson picked it
up and was running away with the ball
safe for a score when it split before his
stick.
After a series of dashes to and fro Rich
ard Tobin encountered his married brother
galloping toward victory, when Lawson
dashed in and made a goal. The players
found themselves fairly matched in the
last battle of this period until Richard
Tobin knocked the ball to center and
Lawson continued the lead for bachelor
dom, when Baldwin interposed with aÂ«
mncn firmness for his side, lie knocked
hard out and past the players from
the middle of the field toward goal, and
dashing around made a point.
A completely new set of ponies was
brought out in the second period and the
irame was lresher than before. Time was
called unon a splendid battle, in which
considerable spirit was shown. After tne
rest Baldwin took the ball from the toss
down and was uoing home with it at a
mad gallop, when Richard Tobin struck it
backward to his feilow-bnchelor, Mc-
Creery, who took it up till Tobin caught
him and made a goal. This happened in
a minute or two. Hobart was the fi. at to
knock the ball where it was tossed out.
He made a clever hit, and his fast pony
pnssed away like a Hash after the ball.
fiii* was the brilliant play of the game,
as Hobart actually ran away with the ball
and got another coal for the married men
in less than a minute.
Lawson led the play next to the cheers
of spectators, as he' dashed across tne
ground, but Baldwin tool; the ball from
tjim, and after some lighting, hit toward
goal. The usual excitement on account of
the dangerous position lollowed and
Hobart knocked to goal.
The last part of the second period was
disturbed by the antics of Jumping Jack
with Eyre ur>, though the play went on
merrily all over the field. McCreery made
a goal whicli didn't count, beine off side
play. Baldwin scored on a fast rush. In
the next part of the second time was up,
and as Eyre knocked the ball outside
there was no score.
In the third period the single men put
on a .cenuine spurt and Lawson won a
goal. Time was called in the neit part of
the period, doting the same with a score
of 5 for the married men and 4 for the
single.
