seized by the officers and charged with
the crime of murder.' He seemed stolidly
indifferent and insisted that he was Lee
Weller. Among his effects were found
many of the private papers of the late
Captain Lee Weller, also song books and
other personal pioperty of one Frank
I Harwood and of Captain Weller. The
I significance of the possession of Har
j wood's property lies in the fact that Har
' wood is a mining expert in Australia,
! whose goods are supposed to have been
; stolen by the prisoner. Harwood made
[ 'hat charge months ago.
One of the most important incidents of
the search of the prisoner's clothing was
the discovery of ten grains of sulphate of
strychnine secreted in his hatband. He
tried to induce Detective Egan to let him
see it, expressed surprise that it hail been
found and professed that he knew not
whence it came nor what it was. Later in
the day he said he haa never intended to
end Lis own life.
It transpired that Captain Eraser knew

to Surrender.
that Butler was the man suspected of
murdering many men in the Australian
bush, but as Butler was a go* d worker
and an obedient man he was allowed to
work without molestation. The captain
thought he had no authority to place the
man in irons. He learned of the identity
of his man about ten days after the Swan
hilda lefl Newcastle, the information be
ing contained in newspapers obtained
from the steamer Taupo.
After his arrest tne prisoner was hur
riedly driven to the new City Hall, and
his effects were scheduled, a copy being
kept by Captain Lees and one by the Aus
tralian detectives. The navigation papers
of Captain Lee Weller were conspicuous
among the more valuable pieces of evi
dence. It should be remembered that the
bodies of Captain Lee Weller and other
victims of the murderer were not discov
ered until after the Swanhilda sailed, so
Butler's ignorance of what the world
knows did much to encourage him in his
bold claim that he is Lee Weller.
Butler was turned over to the United
Sates Marshal about 11 a. m., and thou
sands of people were allowed to see him.
At 2 p. m. he was examined for identifica
tion before Commissioner Heacock and
the nearing of evidence of probable cause
on the petition for extradition will come
before the same tribunal at 10:30 a. M.
Monday next.
The British Consul appeared by attor
ney and made the formal demand for ex
tradition, resisting the application of two
young men, who appeared for Butler, for
a delay of ten days.
In response to the only question asked
by the court, "What is your true name?''
the prisoner replied, in a clear tone, "Lee
Weller is my name." He seemed cool and
berate. '-'â -â¢'. â¢

He speaks with a burr like some of the j
dialects of the north and is at times face- |
tious in his manner.
Since the Swanhilda left Newcastle the I
Australian officers have unearthed a
great deal of damaging evidence against
the su-pect arrested here yesterday. â¢ They
believe they can establish the fact that
Butler was for some time engaged in the
business of murdering men. for tneir
money, shooting them while they were
practically digging their own graves un
der the belief, however, that they were
prospecting for gold.

great criminal story is . subjoined, em

CAUGHT AT LAST.
Handcuffs, After Weeks of Waiting,
Sharply Snapped on Butler's
, .Wrists. .
About 4:30 o'clock yesterday morning
the man on watch at the lookout station
on Point Lobos heard six. sharp whistles
in rapid succession.
That was the prearranged signal by
which the towboat that should bring in
the Swanhilda was to herald her coming.
It was very, dark, but the lookout did not
wait for a closer inspection of the distant
ship in tow. .He immediately telephoned
in to the Merchants' Exchange station on
Miiiggs wharf. * " ''*"*' ' .-*
Little Jimmie Black was there to re
ceive the message. He in turn telephoned
it at once to the residence of United States
Marsha) Barry Baldwin and then hastened
out to arouse the officers and Australian
detectives in the little harbor police sta
tion next door and to awaken the repre
sentatives of the press sleeping in neigh
boring small buildings.
Their long vigil was at an end. Like
men scrambling out of a house aflame
came sleuths, policemen and reporters.
But there was ample time yet. Nothing
could be seen showinâ¢ the faintest light
between the regular beacons on Fort Point
to the south and on the more distant Point
Bonita to the north of the Goldan Gate
passage through which ttie ship must
come.
The little revenue cutter Hartley, lying
close un to and almost hidden by the
height of the wharf, fired up and got
ready to leave at a moment's notice with
the small party of officials and writers
gathered in an expectant, eager group
and watching fora- towboat's lights to
show from behind the sharp profile of the
old abandoned fort that stands as a south
ern gatepost to the entrance to the bay.
As they were still scanning the murky
width of waters Marshal Baldwin arrived
in a coupe.- He had made arrangements
to have one near his house ready for use
on short notice. A few '.moments later
two newspaper men arrived^ from down
town press agencies, where they had just
finished sending the last of the night's
news East. â¢'.'-â¢'-.
The crowd was complete, all the neces
sary functionaries : were on ' hand, ' yet
nothing showed around the point.' â  "
Perhaps it was half-past 6 o'c.'ock'when
very near on a line with the edge of the
fort a bright 'flash of light, â  followed
quickly by another flash, brightened for a
moment the dark horizon.' It was the
towboat' s signal. The long-expected
Swanhilda wasbehind that flash. *: * -'*
No time was lost in scrambling off the
wharf and down to the deck of â¢ the
Hartley. Every one seemed 'eager to be
in at the death. - There was. a sudden
slushing sound' of 'violently disturbed
water. A man had, in his hurry, nAssed
his footing and gone overboard ' between
the boat and the piles. His head* popped
up alongside. Some one pulled him in
over the low gunwale and as the shivering
victim of the unexpected' early morning
prunge was helped, to his. feet the others
recognized him as one of the late arrivals.
1 1 "was" Agent Jones," who had come post
.haste from .the Associated Press, office
downtown.'; . _
[ The cutter got under way: immediately
and steamed down the bay to meet the
floating home of the arch murderer. *.' '
: Directions were given by the . chief
officials to the men crowded in the cabin.
The United States quarantine* officer was
aboard. No oue but the doctor and the
American officers were to show themselves
when the incoming ship should be near at
band. The Australian 'detectives and the
press representatives must remain, in the
cabin until the proper moment or the
murderer Â might cause . unnecessary
trouble, or, perhaps, despairing, attempt
suicide should he suspect anything other
than the ordinary health and customs in
spection .familiar to sailors entering a for-
eign port. 7 "" /J/ ;â 'â â 
â¢ Just opposite Presidio the Hartley
passed alongside the Alert and a moment
later bumped gently against the starboard
side of the big Swanhilda. It was 100 dark
to distinguish faces on deck.
-. Up the pendent rope-ladder that' was
thrown over the side climbed Boarding
Officer Sprague, captain of the customs
watch, and behind him Sealing- Officer
Ferguson, also of the customs service. Fol
lowing in succession up oyer the side of
the ship went Dr. Rosener.ithe Quarantine
surgeon, United States Marshal Baldwin,
Harbor Police Sergeant Bunner, Detec
tive Egan, Detective Silvey and Officer
Ferguson.
None of the police officers were in uni
form, and there was nothing to give "But
ler" a hint of their real business. Sergeant
Buuner went aft at once in search of the
captain to ascertain from him if "Butler"
was already in irons. '
"Butler" was not in irons. But the cap
tain declared that he had a suspected mur
derer aboard and had known it for six
weeks. But his name was not Butler but
Weller. He had thought it better not to
arrest him as the man was a good worker
and was not aware that, his secret was
known.
Coming quickly forward, the sergeant
ordered the mate to muster the crew for
inspection by the Health Officer. Up the
men came from the forecastle in twos and
threes and fours, and formed a line along
one side of the deck. Some were bare
foot. Many were but half clad. There
must have been thirty men, including the
Chinese cook, in that irregular, close
formed line that was not a dress parade.
Cautioning th** officers in a low voice to
make no sign, the mat** with Egan and
Ferguson very near to him, and the gray
haired but erect and active old sergeant
close behind, passed slowly along in front
of the men, peering into their faces.
They' moved slowly along, scanning
each face. They had got half way down
the line. They were directly abreast of
the main hatch. In a low Undertone the

nary size, murmured, "That's your man,''
and a slight gesture left no doubt as to
which one he meant. *;' ; '
Already close up, the sturdy-built Egan
and the tall, wiry Ferguson together made
a sudden thrust for the man's wrists and
gripped them as in a vise, while Sergeant
Bunner, flashing a --learning pistol toward
the man's head, commanded hint to throw
up hi*- hands. But ha could rot throw up
hands. The officers had seized him in
stantly and had him held securely before -
he could make the slightest move.
It was a proud moment for Detective
Egan as lie drew out his own brieht steel
handcuffs and snapped them on the wrists
of his prisoner. . "
Detective Silvey had in the meantime
gone round behind the line to cut off a
possible attempt of the murderer to jump â 
overboard, but the precaution proved un
necessary. â¢ '77
Then for the first time the Australian
â¢ detectives were permitted to show them- *
selves. Conroy came firs*', and after nim
was McHattie, the faces of both well dis
guised by false beards.
Conroy was to identify the man. He
alone of all the officers know and was
known to the murderer. He stepped up
to him as he sat on the edge.of the main
hatch.
"He's the man," said Conroy, after only
a moment's look at his face. â¢ "Did you
ever see me before?" asked the Australian
sleuth, addressing the captive. "No," an
swered the man the crew knew as
"Weller.' : ffls_W
Drawing himself up and still engaging
Butler's attention, Conroy, standing very2
close to and facing him, suddenly, with a
quick movement of his right hand,
snatched the false beard from his own
face and in quick, dramatic tones de
manded : "Now do you know who I am? '
"No," muttered "Butler," in a very low
tone, "and I don't give a â -."
They took the prisoner aft and into the
captain's cabin, aa the men dispersed at
the mate's order.
"The i bloody must have robbed
somebody," remarked one of the sailors
as he moved away, wholly unconscious
that he and bis companions had during
seventy long days at sea been closely asso
ciated with a man supposed to b** one of
the most heartless and cold-blooded
murder fiends of this century.
Silvey. Mcllattie and Conroy went for
ward to gather together this "Lee tel
ler's" effects. Upon his person they had
found no weapons. To be sure he was on
watch forward when the customs and
Quarantine officers Innocently came
aboard. He was dressed in an old dark
sack coat, the sleeves of which were rolled
up several inches in* order to be short
.enough for him. On hi-* head was a pecu
liar little black felt hat. His old, patched
and faded blue overalls wer** short enough
to reveal sockless ankles' above bare feet
incased in old low shoes.
On Butler's bunk was a coat and vest.
In a vest pocket were found six loose
cartridges, 44 caliber. In the bunk also
was found one of those short, stubby, u__Jy
looking revolvers very appropriately
called "English bulldog."
A large leather valise contained most of
the man's things. The others they bun
dled into a large blanket that had served
as a comfoner.
Meanwhile the officers were with their
man in the cabin aft. Detective Egan j
taking the prisoner's hat began to ex- |
amine it on the inside. Turning out the !
leather sweatband he came across a little i
paper package that had been lodged in
side the band. He .unfolded the bit of
paper. There was some sort of white j
powder. It might be strychnine. Later ;
developments showed that it was. '
The baggage was brought off and they !
were ready to move. Curiously enough i
the prisoner had suggested that they had i
better shackle his ankles, 100, while they j
were about it. The hint was enough for
the detectives. They would not shackle !
him, but they would tie a rope carefully
around, him and guard against any slip
by which he might hope to fall overboard.
All this â¢ happened before the Swan
hilda had been lowed in as far as Black
Point. There the little Hartley with her
extra passenger left the ship and steamed
ahead for Meiggs wharf.
WAS CALM AND COMPOSED
Butler Showed No Emotion and
Talked Guardedly to Cap
tain Lees.
On the way in to the wharf, while the
detectives and other officers were smil
ingly trying to pat themselves and their
companions on the back, Conroy again
asked "Butler" if he did not recall him as
CAPTAIN DONALD FRASER.
Captain Donald Fraser is master of the Swanhilda, the vessel for which three
countries have been watching and waiting.
Captain Fraser is a nativ- ol Nova Scotia and the trio he is now making is his
third to this port. He is a genial, warm-hearted roan, and has made numerous
friends in this city. He is a young man who enjoys himself on shore but when
on board snip he is alert and attentive to every detail of his vessel, and he is well
liked by his crew.
the man to whom he had, last September,
given a map of the Aubrey gold region at
tbe time Butler, then passing as Harwood,
mining expert, tried to induce Conroy to
join him in a mining exploration. Yes,
he said he did remember giving some one
that map, and he guessed Conroy was the
man. * .
.By chance the Hartley reached the
wharf just as a dozen or more marines
from the cutter Perry arrived from their
farewell all-night shore leave, spent down
town. Besides these men in sailor cos
tume there were perhaps a dozen other
persons on the wharf at that early hour.
It was then almost 7 o'clock. Â»
"Butler" was at once hustled upstairs
in the Harbor Police station, there to
await the police wagon that would carry
the whole official party to tho main police
station at the City Hall.
While Marshal Baldwin was telephoning
the good news uptown, Detective John
Roche, as chief Australian representative,
was preparing a terse message to be sent
by cable to Inspector-General Fosberry,
Sydney, New South ; Wales. ' Sergeant
Bunner, for the first time in three weeks,
exchanged Lis red flannel duty shirt for a
white shirt, in which to go uptown with
the party.
"Butler" sat on the lounge, with Fergu
son holding one of his hands. He looked
furtively and from overhanging, shaggy
brows, taking in his surroundings and the
men about him. He was smoking a
cigarette, which was almost exhausted.
His hands were unnaturally pale and
iooked thin. Tbat may have been caused
by his watch on deck in the cold air of
the early morning. He gave the impres
sion of having lost weight. Conroy de
clared that he was fully "a stone lighter"
than when he last saw him in Sydney
four months ago.
He puffed bard at the cigarette stump.
It had gone out. Some one asked him if
he would not like another cigarette.
"I'll take a cigar if you have one,"
coolly replied the prisoner; and the cigar
was forthcoming. "Ye?," he remarked,
indifferently, between puffs, "this makes
a very fair smoke."
He was collected, unflurried, matter-of
fact, almost indifferent from the very first.
No bush mounted bis cheek, -t did it
pale. As with the cigarette firs gi cn â so
with the cigar â be puffed regu.'-riy on,
a miserable, uncomely, poorly clad wretch
or* whom you might easily have felt pity
had it not been for those rat-like, cruel,
small gray eyes with their stealthy glances,
and had it not been for that stolid indiffer
ence to sentiment that make: it easy to
believe him capable of murder as a com
mercial enterprise or as a profession.
Across the right side of his lower lip
there is a scar perhaps an inch lone from
his mouth downward. His nose is not
flat on the bridge as described. His left
thumb nail is misformed, a ridge cleaving
jit lengthwise. The ring finger of his left
] hand is tattooed with two parallel India
j inK rings. He is not a big man, but he is
! compactly and strongly built. His meas
urements, taken later at the main police
station, show him to be only 5 feet 8%
inches in height. He weighs at present
but 154 pounds.
While seated there smoking he was
! asked where he originally came from, but
he declined to furnis i any information.
Then turning to one of his questioners he
remarked, "A man's innocent till bo's
proved guilty." * But when reminded that
an innocent man should have nothing to
I fear from the truth concerning such
j matters as nationality particularly he
| made no reply. >
The patrol-wagon was taxed to its full
capacity when the prisoner and his
numerous guards took seats. The officers
drove as rapidly as possibly to the City
Hall. Arrived there they conducted the
prisoner into an inner room on the first
floor. The news of his capture bad pre
ceded the wagon and curious persons stood
about hoping to get a glimpse of the
murderer.
An examination of the prisoner's effects
was speedily begun and a careful invoice
was kept of each article by Officer Fergu
son for this Government and by Detective
Roche for the Colonial Government of
Australia. Sergeant Bunner acted as in
spector, calling out the items one by one
as the things were taken from the large
valise and then from the bundle.
The prisoner, still silent, smoking, fur
tively watchful, was seated close to Fer
guson, and on the other side McHattie
took up his station. Behind stood a police
man in uniform and one or two more were
in the room, together with the other offi
cers.
As the investigation proceeded the most
damaging testimony pots. ble was found
among the man's effects. *
There were all the murdered Captain
Lee Weller's mariner's certificates and
some things that were inscribed to Wel
ler' .Â«â  dead wife. There were several mining
expert's certificates in the name of Frame
Harwood and there were many pieces of
clothing marked F. H. or H., tbe supposi
tion having been raised in Australia that
Butler had robbed Harwood, who is still
alive, and had used the name and papers
to make his raining investment schemes
the more plausible.
Detective Conroy privately identified
the mining certificates as tbe very ones
that the prisoner had shown him in Syd
ney last September. There were many
pieces of woman's jewelry. Some of them,
Conroy remarked, had been shown to him
at the time the certificate of mining was
produced, and "Harwood" had explained
that he had had them made from time to
time from nuggets he had picked up in
the mines. There were other things
marked with other names and other ini
tials, ail going to show that the prisoner
had borrowed from several place?.
Detective Roche asserted privately that
he could identify the blue serge coat and
vest found among Butler's things as the
one last worn by the murdered Preston.
The evidence was abundant, and the
favored spectators looked on in wonder
ment at the composure of the prisoner
and marveled now he could have been so
foolish as to preserve such documents.
There were found but two gold sovereigns
not another cent of money.
One of the greatest surprises of the ex
amination was that to Detective Conroy
himself when Captain Lees, who even
tually arrived and assumed control, read
in a checkbook the name "Airs. Colin
O'Connor."
"The dickens! That's i my sister,"
impulsively blurted out Conroy as he
hurried round to examine the exhibit.
He explained later that while he was

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1897.
BUTLER'S TELL-TALE , PROPERTY.
The effects captured with Butler aboard the Swanhilda, revealing property such as private papers, books, photo
graphs and jewelry belonging to Captain Weller; also the hat and a package of strychnine hidden beneath the band:
No. Iâ The bulldog nistol with the initials "J. R." and "J.K." found in Butler's possession.
No. â Some of the jewels and trinkets. ,
No.-3â Butler's blankets covering the remainder of his apparel.
No. 4â Tho soft Fedora hat taken off Butler's head when he was arrested by Detective Egan, and in the band of
which ten grains of strychnine was found.
No. sâThe5 â The package of strychnine.
No. 6â Butler's valise, enclosing the Weller jewels, photographs and papers. â¢ â¢
first talking with "Harwood" he told him
that he had a brother-in-law and a sister
living at Aubrey at the Race Club Hotel,
Wagga road. "Harwood" had said then
tbat as his mines were near there he
would call on Conroy's relatives on the
occasion of his next visit. It now appears
be did call and that be has the checkbook,
which in addition to having Conroy's
married sister's name on the inside cover
has also the name of bis unmarried sister.
"He told me after that," said Conrov,
"that he had been down to Aubrey and
had said that mine of, his for Â£4000, and
that I made a mistake in not going with
him, as I should have had half. I saw
him several times, but always knew him
as Harwood."
"Butler," when asked during the exam
ination a question about his antecedents,
acknowledged that he had been here four
years ago, but said he would not talk be
fore the reporters. "I've got a very hard
charge to stand." he said. "I suppose I
can answer it; I'll try, anyway."
When called upon to certify by his
signature to the correctness ot the items
recorded by Roche the prisoner, his hand
being liberated for the purpose, wrote
without hesitancy the name Lee Weller
and signed that name whenever it was
necessary on some half a dozen sheets of
paper.
He was breakfasted in the police station
kitchen, permitted 'to put on a flannel
shirt and better overalls preparatory to
beina taken down to the Appraisers'
building to be examined by the United
States Commissioner.
Just before going, however, Chief of
Detectives Lees was closeted with the
prisoner. What happened is best ex
explained in Captain Lees' own words.
"When I first saw the man," he said,
"his face struck me as being familiar.
1 told him I knew him or had seen
him before. He said that he had never
been mixed up with the police, although
he had been in this State before â about
four years ago, when he shipped on an
outgoing vessel. He had remained here
only a few months.
"I find that the prisoner is a particularly
shrewd man," added Captain Lees, "not
that he attempts to be cunning and evasive,
but that he is careful, and talks rationally,
plausibly and with restrictionsâ he im
poses upon me in regard to his statements
before he makes them.
"For instance, he absolutely refused to
speak on any subject while he was sur
rounded by newspaper men. He quietly
told me that he did not believe he
could do himself good by talking to the
public, but that he was willing to give me
all the information be possessed.
"Later on I had him .alone. He began
by telling me he would not talk of his
case.
"He said: 'I deny that I am guilty of
the charges against me as read in the
warrant for my arrest. I will be fully
able to prove my innocence when the
time comes, but it would unnecessarily in
volve the names of many people at tnis
time to make good my assertion, hence I
prefer to remain silent.
" '1 was here as a sailor during several
months about four years ago, and 1
shipped from this port.'
Captain Lees' promise was (hen ob
tained that he would not divulge the
name of the vessel on whicn Butler went
away. The same promise was also given
that Butler's real name would not be
revealed.
"Butler then told me," continued Cap
tain Lees, "that none of the names by
which he was called were bis.
" 'My name has not yet been published,
and I don't propose it shall be. I was
born in London and my family reside
there. Ido not care to have them mixed
in this affair.
" 'If I had felt guilty of the crimes at
tributed to me I could have made an
attempt to escape, but I did not. I knew
three weeks and a half ago that I was
wanted here and would be arrested upon
my arrival on a charge cf killing two
people. I knew I could clear myself,
however, so I submitted to arrest.'
" 'The news was conveyed to our ship by
a passing vessel and it reached me through
one of the officers.'
"I promised Butler not to tell the offi
cer's name," said Captain Lees.
"He told me that he knew Conroy, the
Australian official here to arrest him, but
did not.have any dealings with him in re
gard to mines. All the dealings he had
with him were when he called at Con
roy's house to court one of the latter's girl
relatives."
THE CAPTAIN'S STORY.
How He Learned the Outlaw Was
Among His Men.
To a Call reporter yesterday afternoon .
Captain Fraser told the story of "Butler's"
Connection with the Swanhilda, from the
day on which he first signed articles in
the Sydney shipping office until the ar
rival of the vessel in San Francisco Bay
yesterday and his arrest by the officers of
the law. â¢ J ..-
Captain Fraser discussed the subject
I with proverbial British sang froid, and if
outward appearances may be said- to fur
nish any criterion the sensational denoue
ment of this remarkable chapter in crimi
nal history left him absolutely unmoved.
The latter fact is all the more noteworthy
when it is remembered that Captain
Fraser was aware of the identity of the
supposed Lee Weller ten days out from
Sydney, after speaking the steamship
Taupo and reading the particulars of the
Blue Mountain murders published in the
Australian papers brought on board the
Swanhilda by one of the Taupo's officers.
"Why, then," was asked," didn't you
clap Butler in irons?"
"I had absolutely no legal authority to
do so," replied the captain, "and, more
over, I bad no wish to deprive myself of
the services of a good man as he proved
himself to be throughout the passage. He
was always well conducted and orderly.
I gave 'Butler' no intimation that I knew
who he was and confided my knowledge
to no one on board except the first offi
cer."
Captain Fraser then related the circum
stances under which he first saw Butler
in the shipping otlice and shipped him as
an able seaman.
"Men were very scarce at the tims,"
said the captain," and our crew was not
made up. My first orders were to call at
Honolulu and then come on to San Fran
cisco. Later, however, a change was made
and I was told to come here direct. It
was at this time that 'Butler.' or Lee Wel
ler, asked me if I was going to San Fran
cisco direct, I told him yes. 'Then,' said
he, 'I'll go with you.' I looked at him
and found him a well-dressed man. His
face was somewhat flushed as though he
had been drinking.
*- 'Are you an able seaman?' I asked.
.' 'Oh, yes," he replied.
" 'Have you any discharges?' was my
next question. 'If so let me see one of
them.'
"He pulled a large envelope half-way
out of his pocket in such a manner as to
conceal it from the gaze of the others in
the office and I then saw that the con
tents of the envelope were either a mas
ter's or a mate's certificate. Of course
one or the other was good enough for me,
so I told the shipping-master to sign him
on. After ho had signed, he came to me
where I was standing at the end of the
counter and pulled out his certificate,
when I found that it was a master's cer
tificate passed some ten* or eleven years
ago. My supposition naturally was that
he had fallen in the world through drink
aud so forth.
"He came aboard almost at the last
minute on the Monday morning we sailed
and I said to the mate, 'We have a man
in the forecastle with a master's certifi- .
cate.' The mate asked me who he was
and I said, 'Welder, or something like
that.' After we had been out a couple of
days the mate said, 'You must be mis
taken about that master's certificate, be
cause the man is no sailor.'
" 'There is no doubt about his having a
master's certificate,' I replied, 'because 1
saw it.'
"This incident passed over and I re
marked to the mate that if Weller couldn't
do one thing he could do another. 'Use
him,' said I, 'the same as the other men.'
"Nothing further of interest happened
until the Taupo came along, bound for
Raratpnga. -When first sighted she was a* 7
long way off. "When abeam of us I
thought 'She will be able to read our sig
nals,' so we hoisted the numbers, but they
were not answered for over half an hour.
At last she got so close that I could plainly
distinguish her signal halyards, when I
ordered the second mate to report us all
well. j
"She answered that signal, but still
â  came closer to us. Said I, 'What the devil
does the fellow mean?' She ran in still
closer and signaled us, 'Have you any
passengers aboard?' I ran up, 'No.'
"This time she was close under our quar
ter. Then she signaled, 'Heave to; 1
have something important to communi
cate.*
"We complied. A boat was lowered
and her second officer came aboard us.
He joined me on the poop, carrying a
bundle of papers, witn one opened. 'Cap
tain sends his compliments,' he re
marked, 'and thought you would be anx
ious to know about this â and he whis
pered about the murders. I took him
into the chartroom and there read the ac
count in the paper, which, however,
didn't mention Weller's name at all, but
Butler's. â¢ 7-7.
'Well,' said I. 'I fancy the authorities
must be wrong, because I have no man of
that name on my articles, and I have an
exceptionally good crew, as it happens.'
" 'Well, : he said, 'this fellow may have
shipped under another name.'
"'That's quite possible,' l replied, 'but
I know nothing about it, and so far as I
do know, I have no man of the kind
among my crew.'
"Finally the officer gave me a bundle of
papers sent from the newspaper offices
immediately before sailing and which had
never been opened. After he had gone I
started In to reau them for the news, and
the first thing I ran across was this mys
tery, and the first or second paper I read
mentioned Weller's name. Then I looked
up all the articles and went carefully
through them.
"I saw at once that Weller was the man
right enough. However, I didn't say a
word to anybody just then, but the follow
ing day I called the mate and showed him
the newspaper articles which I had cut
" 'Read these over carefully,' said I.
"He did so and then said, 'This is the
man sure enough.'
" 'Now,' said I, 'I don't want this to go
any further. Don't say anything to a
living creature on board. Watch the man
closely, and if he misbehaves we will soon
take care of him. But so long as he be
haves himself we will let him alone.'
"Nothing more _ happened until we
reached this port and 'Butler' was ar
rested.
"Throughout the voyage the man,
though no seaman, showed himself a good
workman and knock-about man. He was
also a good helmsman, and took his turn
with the rest."
This was all Captain Fra had to say,
and it is a commonplace story enough,
i viewed in the light of recent speculations
| as to the possible fate of the Swanhilda, in

self on Board the bwanhllda

The captain of the Swanhilda was not
, making long rep- rts yesterday. All that
I the Merchants' Exchange reporter could
j get out of him was "November 30 off
j north end of New Zealand, was in com
j pany with the British ship Olivebankand
American ship sterling from Newcastle,
X. S. W., for San Francisco."
From New Zealand, all three vessels
I steered a direct course for the Fiji Islands
I and all three arrived off the coast of Cali
| fornia about the same time. There are
i two square-riggers outside according .to
| last reports, and one of them, so the tow
i boat captains say, is either the Olivebank
jor Sterling. The latter has the choice in
the betting.
lt will be noticed that after leaving the
north end of New Zealand the log of the
Swanhilda is a sealed book. Captain
Fraser met the Union Steamship Com
pany's Taupo in the vicinity ot the Fiji,
Islands and th 9 steamer signaled the ship'
to heave to for papers. Among the papers
was a letter from the captain of the
steamer telling Captain Fraser that he
had the murderer on board. From that
date the log of the Swauhilda, as far as
the public is concerned, is burled in ob
livion.
The members of the crew are not as reti
cent, however. . They say that Weller waa
one of the best sailors on the ship. He
was anxious to reach San Francisco in
order to see his old mother, who lives in
Toronto, before she-died, and frequently
remarked that "the old. man wou.d have
J made better time had he taken the north-
I crn course, (the same course taken by the
I Snow and Burgess, which arrived ahead
|of the fleet). As it was the vessel was
j delayed by light winds and calms, and
| Captain Fraser, after he received the letter
j from the Taupo, had to possess his soul in
patience and trust in providence and his
; chief officer. Tue latter was at once taken
into Captain Fraser's confidence, and after
I due deliberation they decided to let mat
| ters move along as they were going. They '
[ reasoned thus: "Nineteen days out and a
I probable run of fifty days before us. It
I we put Weller in irons we can't kesp the
i rest of the crew away from htm, and the
chances are. that he wili plead persecu
tion; that he is not the man wanted;
that the officers were" acting without war
rant," and then there would have been
trouble, maybe mutiny.

there was a man accused of cold-blooded |
murders aboard were the captain and j
chief officer.
According to Captain Fraser Weller was
"one of the best sailors aboard the ship,"
but according to the crew he was too much
of a psalm-singer to suit them. He- used
to exhort the men to refrain from swear- |
ing and every Sunday there was a prayer I
meeting in the fo'cas'le. Said one of.the
men yesterday : "Weller was one of the
best hands at a prayer-meeting I ever
came across. When it came to furling a
sail and the clew lines were striking us
like the old-fashioned canes we got on our
hands at school many of the lads would
curse and swear lik3 troopers. Wben
everything had been made snug and the |
watch was crouching under the break of ]
the poop Weller would call the men to ac
count He would recount. to each one of
us the oaths' we had uttered under, the
spur of the moment and exhort us to
mend our way. "Boys,' he* would say,
'there is a hereafter and you all believe
in it. Now what excuse will you have to
make on the; judgment day when you
come to making an accounting for all the
blasphemy you have uttered to-night?'
Some of the "answers are not fit to put in
print and Weller got many a josb.
"On Sunday he use to hold a prayer
meeting, and he could talk, too, I cau tell
you. Why, he could talk about right
eousness and kingdom-come like a
preacher, and once in a while he made
some of us fellows feel pretty bad. Only |
a few days before we reached port he said
he was going to leave 'the ship, and he cot
down on his knees and prayed that we
might all be saved â 'brands plucked from
the burning,' he called it.
"Or. one or two occasions the old nan
and another of the officers dropped in a 1
the prayer-meetings, but they did not
seem to take much stock in the proceed
ings, and Weller noticed it. He said
nothing, however, but only prayed the
harder that the captain and all on board
might be brought to know righteousness.
When the police came aboard and Weller
was arrested, we were the most surprised |
crew that ever came into San Francisco.', j
Captain Eraser says that neither he nor
any of his officers were present at any of
the praver-meetines, but he does say that '
he and his chief officer kept a close watch
on Weller after he received the news from |
the Taupo. After a lengthy consultation it j
wa3 decided to allow the supposed mur- j
derer his liberty and treat him just as
usual. Captain Fraser says he was one of
the most willing men in the forecastle.
When the Swanhilda arrived off the
Farallou.es Captain Harry Marshall of the
tug Active was to the lee of the island and
at once went out to her. Captain Eraser
asked for a pilot and the tug signaled lor
the America. Captain Miller was soon
aboard, and from 12 m. to. 2:30 a. M. the
master of the Swanhilda was keening his
vessel standing on and off, trying to rocke
up his mind as to taking a tow. Finally
he accepted Captain Marshall's offer, and
directly thi* lines were aboard the Active
blevs six whistles, and John Hyslop. the

When the extradition proceedings were
called before Commissioner Heacock in thÂ«
afternoon the Circuit Court room was
crowded to its full capacity, : nd thousands
stood in line on Sansome street to view t'i Â«i
prisoner as he was rushed into the van wl
be carried to the new City Hall prison. ",1
At 2 o'clock j'estorday afternoon the'
prisoner appeared before Commission*!
Heacock in the United States Circuit
Court room for the purpose of legal identi- â¢
fication. Constable Conroy was the only
witness called by Cormac & Donohoe,
the legal advisers of her Britaurric Jlajes- ;_
ty's Consul, J. W. Warburton, who will
represent the imperial Government during
the extradition proceed a continuance
until next Monday morning at 10:30 o'clock
being afterward granted by the court at .
the request of Leonard. Stone <fc Bidwell/
who appeared as counsel for the defend
ant. .â¢â â¢ i- -
Prior to the commencement of the iden
tification proceedings, the prisoner
remained under guard of Marshal Bald
win, Sergeant Bunner, Detective Egan and
Officer Ferguson, in the prisoners' room
adjoining the Marshal's office' in the
Appraisers' building. Butler occupied the
interval posing for newspaper 'artists,
smoking cigar* and stolidly enduring the
scrutiny of the curious. Among the many
visitors who paid their respects to the
prisoner at' this lime of the day were
several members of the crew of the Swan
hilda,. who, truth to tell, regarded their
late comrade with a wonder that was
almost admiring.
The outer corridors were soon crowded
with the customary miscellaneous assort
ment of humanity, who are Habitual
witnesses of all legal processes promising
sensation. So great was the crush that
the officers experienced considerable
difficulty in conveying the prisoner from
the Marshal's room to the Circuit Court
opposite, and the latter was. filled the
moment the doors were opened. *
At 5 minutes past 2 Commissioner liea
cock announced that be was read,- for the
prisoner to be brought Into court. The
enthusiasm of the spectators was intense,
every eye being turned toward the door.
Suddenly the prisoner stepped in, walk
ing briskly between the deputies in
charge. His lip did not quiver and his eye
did not flinch. He paid no attention' to
the intense gaze of the crowd and when
he was asked his true name, he answered
in a clear tone, "Lee Weller.'*
Butler sat closely guarded by the rffl
cers, but in proximity to his youthful
counsel, Messrs. Stone & Bidwell.
The English Government was repre
sented by T. E. K. Cormac and Denis
Donohoe, and tne British Consul-General,
J. W. Warburton, was present to apply
lor the extradition of the notorious crim
inal. â /-.../'
When Commissioner Heacock asked the'
prisoner to stand and answer certain ques
tions he did so promptly, whereupon- a
long list of aliases were read to him, ter
minating with the question, "What is
your true name?" â¢ 7 _ '
The prisoner caimly replied, "My name
is L**e Weller." â  _
â  Attorney Stone objected to further ques
tions, stating that he wanted a continu
ance; but the Commissioner explained
that the questions were only for the iden
tification of the prisoner.
The aDplication for the prisoner's ex
tradition, which is sworn to by Consul-
Genural Warburton and presented by his
attorneys, refers to the prisoner as "Frank
Harwood, , otherwise called 'S. Burses.*,
otherwise called Butler, otherwise called
Sampson, otherwise called Lee Weller,*'
but until the .identification proceedings
are completed, this application will not
be considered.
Attorney Stone addressed the Commis
sioner at the close of these formalities.
He pointed ont that the prisoner-had only

Counsel for the British Government then
C*Â»l led Constable McHattie, whereupon the
court asked if the prosecution wished to
go further merely for purposes of identifi
cation, and before it reply could be given
Mr. Stone asked for ten days to prepare
matters in this case. Commissioner Hea
cock sr.id :
On the point of identification I need no
further evidence. A- counsel for the prisoner
don't you deÂ«ire to have the charge formulated
againsi him? -"<-'-
Mr. Stoneâ l understand that the charge is
substantially familiar to him and it is not
therefore necessary to read it. Then be asked
Butler, who replied: "No; I know the charge
already."
Mr. Donohoeâ will certainly oppose a
continuance for any such time us ten days. It
seems utter y out of reason mask for such a
continuance in a case of this nature.
' Tt_e courtâ l will hear Mr. Stone on this
point.
Mr. Stone repeated that the prisoner had
been taken entirely by surprise; that he
had only just arrived after a sea voyage
and had bad no opportunity whatever to
re. ute the charges against him. This be
ing the case it was no more than reason
able to ask ten days .or preparation. The
prosecution, on the other hand, had had
ample time to present their case. They
had been working on it for weeks and
were prepared to proceed at once.

that any unusual delay would involve greater

smoked and chatted, but there was a
troubled look on his lace. As soon as the

then some one asked: "Which would you

STRYCHNINE IN HIS HAT.
Tan Grains of Poison Found by
Detective Egan.
One of the most extraordinary incidents
of the day was Detective Egan's discovery
of ten grains of strychnine secreted in the
prisoner's hatband.
Butler was evidently surprised when he
saw that his package had been discovered
and he made a desperate attempt to get it,
saying he did not know what it was.
Speaking of the discovery Detective
Egan said:
"It is my custom to always look into a
man's hat. It is generally considered
that the hatband may hide small objects
calculated to be of future use to the pris
oner. I didn't tell Butler I wanted to look
at his bat, but took it off his head at once.
In the band I found a closely wrapped
paper inclosing ten grains of a white
powder, which afterward proved to be
strychnine.
" 'Hello, what's this?' I asked. Butler
said he didn't know, and reached out for
tbe package, saying, 'Let me see.'. 'Oh,
no,' I exclaimed, and I pocketed the stuff.'-
I'he powder was turned over to A. Mc-
Boyle, chemist and druggist, 504 Wash
ington street. He made an analysis and
found it to be from ten to twelve grains oi
sulphate of strychnine. ,'.!â¢-â¢' â ;:;:.
"Where did you get the strychnine and
what were you going to do with it?" was
asked of Butler by a Call leporter yester
day afternoon in the presence of Detective
Egan. "I aon't know anything about the

stuff." he said, continuing, "I am net go
ing to kill myself, you may depend upon
it, or else I should have done it before.''
Further than this he would not discuss
the subject.
"Since Butler has been in custody we
have talked together several times," said
Detective Euan, "but he tried always to
keep away from the main subject. He
acknowledged, however, that he felt sute
of defeating the charges against him.
" 'They can't convict me,' he said,
'on these two charges, but, of course, they
may nail me on the charge of forgery or
something else, but not on these murder
cases.' "
In another conversation he said: "1 did
not shoot Weller," thus showing that* he
was familiar with the method of Captain
Weller'b death.

GRIM PREPARATIONS.
A Cage Being* Provided on the
Monowai to Take Butler Back
to Australia.
Should Butler or "Weller, the so-called
murderer, be extradited before next Fri
day at noon he will leave on the Oceanic
Steamship Company's Monowai for Sya
ney, N. S. W., and in that event the same
steamer will probably bring back next
April the account of his trial, and, in the
event of his conviction, of his execution. .
Yesterday the detectives visited the
steamer, and the foreward 'tween decks
were measured. It was found possible to
build a room large and comfortable
enough to accommodate Butler, and
should he be extradited the quarters,
wallet by heavy six-inch planking, will
be put un iv less than six hours. The
space reserved for the cage is the space
usually given up to blooded stock sent
from America to Australia, and vice
versa. _K_P9
Butler will be provided with a comfort
able bed, and will live on tne best the ship
provides during his voyage to the An
tipodes. Should he not get away on the
Monowai, he will remain in the City and
County Jail until the Alameda sails, one
month from now.
A CHECKERED CAREER.
What the Supposed Wife of the
Prisoner Knows of Her Hus
band's Life.
VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. Mrs. Etta
First Mate Thomas Meikle.
Butler, a resident of this city for a year
or more, will go to San Francisco in the
morning in company with her uncle, E.
D. Hill, and Sheriff McKenzie of Napa to
see ii she can identify the man Butler
srrested on the Swanhilda as the husband
who mysteriously left her in San Fran
cisco early one morning some four years
ago. From the various descriptions she
has read and the pictures seen in ihe
papers she is of the opinion they are one
and the same person.
At the time of meeting with Butler she
was a young and prepossessing widow with
her parents at Napa. Butler, who was
quite a lover of horses, was employed at
the racetrack at Nana. Her brother, a
Mr. Hill, introduced Butler to bis sister.
After the marriage the couple remained
in Napa a few days, from which place
they moved to San Francisco, where But
ler obtained employment in a livery sta
ble. He was always kind and indulgent,
and so far as able gave bis wife all the
money he could.
After working some three months in the
stable early one morning he told bis wife
that he had quit the job and asked for
what money was in the house. Mrs. But
ler handed I im aboat $65, all she had.
From this amount he tossed her a $10
gold piece, kissed her gooo-by and told
her he would not be home for lunch, but
to look for him at dinner time. The din
ner time never came.
Chief Crowley was given a description
of the missing man, but failed to locate
nim. The Call gave an extended notice
of this at tuo time. Time passed on; a
baby boy was born, which is now a healthy
tnree-vear-old child in the Good Tem
plars' Home for Orphans.
Mrs. Butler came to Vallejo over a year
ago and obtained employment as a cook
in the Wilson House, where she rem lined
for nine months.
Finally Mrs. Butler learned, through
Butler's relatives in Massachusetts, of his
roamings about the world; how he had
sailed across the Atlantic to London, then
to Australia and back to America, and
how, when the great railroad strike was
on, be had started to bring a band of
horses across the continent and bad been
detained.
That Butler had had some trouble be
fore their marriage his wife felt positive.
He told her he had been all over the world
before he met her. Said he had been a
cowboy in Texas and Colorado, ha<; once
enlisted for tive years in the United
States Army, but when or where he did
not say. Tins is the one remaining inci
dent that she has been unable to verify
through her correspondence. He de
serted after serving a few years and she
has since heard that he had killed the
captain of the company.
He had been in Washington and Ore
gon. In the former State he was a cornet*
ist in a theater. This she knew to be
true, as his trunks were always full of
music.
The lady beard he was engaged in
stealing valuable jewelry in Washington,
wh:ch he sold in San Francisco. It came
to her ears that he was driven out of
Texas for stealing thousands of head of
cattle. He was also engaged in herding
cattle in North and South Dakota.
After Butler had been gone several
weeks Airs. Butler received a letter at
Napa addressed to him. It was written
at \Villiamsette, Mass., and ran as fol
lows:
. I write these lines to notify you that the
police are after you here and at Holyoke.
Leave the placs where- you are at once. I
write you as an old friend and correspondent.
.She recalled several incidents of his life
just previous to his departure that go to
show he had accomplices elsewhere than
in Massachusetts.
STORY OF THE CRIME.
Graphic. Account by an Australian
Correspondent of the Revolting:
Murders Attributed to Butler,
and Their Discovery.
The following special correspondence of
The Call tells a fascinating story in chro
nological order of the heinous murders
charged against Butler, the accused Aus
-1 tralian murderer taken from tbe Swan
hilda, and it is the first authentic and de
tailed account published in America:
SYDNEY, * Australia.â The first in
timation the public had of the crimes was
an announcement in the Sydney papers on
November 26 that a sea captain named
! Lee Weller who, with another man, had
been on an expedition to the Blue Moun
tains for the purpose of prospecting lor
gold, was missing.
The other man had been seen returning
to Sydney. Suspicion was aroused,
although -the returning prospector, in re
ply to inquiries, said that "he had left his
mate at tne creek, as he was not well." *
A search in the vicinity was mode and
the charred remains of a pocketbook,
known to have been in the possession of
Captain Weller, were found. This dis
covery led to further investigation, and
the history of the crime, so far as it has
at present been ascertained, can now be
told in chronological order.
From the information now obtained by
the police, with the assistance of the
newspapersâ for in this case the press re
porters have performed a great public
duty â it has been gathered that curing
the early part of October advertisements
appeared in the Sydney papers to the fol
lowing effect: "Wanted, a mate to go
prospecting ;equal shares; experience not
necessary. Apply 822 George street."
These premises are occupied by a Mr. C.
J. Thompson, who- conducts a retresh
ment-room there. The . advertisement
brought about a dozen answers, the appli
cants appearing in person. ... .
Anions them was a young man named
Arthur Thomas O. Preston, aged 20, the
son of a well-known draper in Brisbane,
Queensland. Young Preston, who was a
studious youth, was staying at Synney,
where for the past, few months ne had
been stu lying geology and mineralogy,
first at the Technical College and after
ward at the Sydney University. He was i
most quiet and respectahle, an active
worker in connection with the Newtown
(Sydney) Baptist Sunday-school, a mem- I
ber of the local Christian Endeavor Soci
ety, and he was a well-built young Aus-'
tralian. In Sydney he boarded with a |
Mrs. Williams at Redfern. When he |
called at Mr. Thompson's on Saturday, ]
October 17, he had with him a young- ;
iriend ana fellow-lodger named Robert I
Fielding. Preston went in by himself,
but soon came out for his chum, who then i
went in with him.
Fielding saw two men there, and was
introduced to ohe of them. He could not
recollect the man's name, but subse
quently he identified a photo as that of
the man. The picture was that of a man
staying at Mr. Thompson's, who went by
the name of Harwood. This man told Pres
ton that he was a qualified mining expert j
and had sold a share in a mine at Nvrua
gee. N. S. W., for Â£2000. After a conversa- I
tion with the man Preston agreed to go I
prospecting with him, and on the follow- i
ing Monday evening the two set out by
train for Emu Plains, a small station at
the foot of ihe Blue Mountains, about
forty miles from Sydney, on the Western
Railway. Preston" apparently had little
money with him when he went away, not
more than Â£30, but the clothing he took
has afforded means of certain identifica
tion. By a coincidence, Mr. Thompson,'
the refreshment-room keeper, traveled by
the same train, but in a different car
riage. He saw Preston and the man
known as Harwood get out at Emu Plains,
and Harwood then told him they would
camp lor one night outside the township
and go on in the morning:. Harwood. who
had a regular arsenal of weapons, three re
volvers, a knife and a Winchester rifle, at
his lodgings, had the rifle with him at
Emu Plains. ".
Six days afterward Thompson saw Ha
wood in Sydney and said, "Hello, are you
buck again? What's the matter wit
you?" Harwood replied, "Oh, that young
fellow was too soft, he petered out and I
came back to look ior another mate.''
A few days after this the advertisement
for a prospecting mate 'appeared again
with a different address, "401 Pitt street,"
which is the Metropolitan Hotel. In re
ply tothe advertisement tnis time came
Captain Lee Weller, a retired master mar
iner who arrived in Newcastle a few
I months ago as a passenger in the ship
j South E~ik from South Africa. He was ac
companied by his wife and eir intention
was to proceed in the South Esk to Amer
ica, but the miners' strike at Newcastle de
layed the vessel, which was bound with
coal for the west coast of America. While
the vessel was thus delayed Captain Wel
j ler came to Sydney to see a friend, R. A.
j Lackhani of the Sydney Bulletin office.
! While he was here his wife died suddenly
from heart disease on board the ship at
Newcastle. This sad occurrence altered
the captain's intentions and he decided to
remain for a time in this colony.
Soon after Mrs. Wcller's death he came
j to Sydney, and, alter an interview with
! the advertiser at the Metropolitan Hotel,
; Welier and Harwood, the advertiser, who
j then went under the name of Butler, left
| Sydney by train for Glenbrook, the sta
i tion beyond Emu Plains, on the Blue
i Mountain?. Weller tao with him a large
! brown sea chest wnen he. left his lodgings,
I but this was placed in the luggage-room at
the Sydney railway station, and it was
subsequently called for and taken away
by a man who was not Weller.
A few days later Harwood or Butler (we
will call him Butler henceforth) was seen
by some railway men returning to Sydney
I alone. He said his mate was ill.
About a fortnight, a ter a search was
j commenced for the missing men. On
! November 25, one iocal constable and some
j residents at Glenbrook found the burnt
I remains of some clothing and the rem
nant of a pocketbook bearing . the letters
I "R. A. Lackh" â which was identified as a
| portion of a book given by McLackhim to
J Captain Weller. The ashes of an old
cainpfire were Jound and not far away
were discovered a pair of trousers marked
"F. H," a black leather legging with "Jar
man, maker, Brisbane," on ihe inside,
and a serge coat, under one sleeve of
which Was an aperture as if made by a
knile thrust. The suspicions'of foul ploy
[ were thus confirmed.
A strong body of police, including sev
i eral young natives who are expert bush
! men, and several detectives, were at once
j sent up from Sydney and two aboriginals,
j blackirackers attached tothe police, were
! brought from up-country stations. All
j the most suitable rfien of the Sydney
police were dispatched to take part in the
search, and soon clews to the mysterious
disappearances were obtained. Piece by
piece and - skein by skein the twisted
threads of the mystery were slowly but
surely unraveled. Residents in the neigh
borhood of Glenbrook and Linden, a
small station a few miles further on,
j brought forward information of having
! seen Butler first with Preston and after
ward with Weller. .
The country all around there two places
is of the wildest and most ruesred char
acter. On the rise oi the Blue Mountains,
Glenbrook is the commencement of heavy
mountainous country, rank, wild Austra
j lian bush, here and there a thick belt of
i gum. trees, here and there steep and rocky
j precipices with great gullies or ravines in
between, thickly covered with scrub and
tangled undergrowth. Half a mile from
Glenbrook station, where the camp-fire
iva' and where the burnt pocket-book was
found, was the scene of Weller's murder.
The search parties divided into two sec
tions, one to seek Weller or his corpse,
the other to look for Preston or his re
mains. ,
The search for young Preston was sadly
successful. Following up the clews given
by residents who had seen Butler and
Preston together the searchers, who had
i been much struck with Butler's evident
knowledge of the locality, came across
their tracks on Tuesday, December l.
Near a gully not far from Linden a flannel
undershirt marked "A. T. O. P." was
found, the garment being slit down the
center with a knife. This was late on the
Tuesday. On the Wednesday their tracks
were found going ip the direction of Faul
conbridge, where Hit Henry Parkes, late
Premier* of the colony, lies " buried. On
the Thursday their camp was found at the
head of Numantia gully, a deep and tor
tuous ravine covered wiih a labyrinth of
thick timber and scrub. The gully runs
j for two miles, where a steep declivity ends
i in a little creek.
Three of the searchers, separated from
j the others, were Constables. Delaney,
j Hardiman and Shelley, ail young natives
with bush experience! They only re
cently joined the mounted "police and
are not yet out of their probation.
After a difficult march of a mile or so
they rounded a big boulder and saw a
small sandy patch. Delaney's bush
knowledge told him the ground had been
recently disturbed. Prodding a stick in he
found the soil yielded, an at the third
thrust withdrew the slick with a portion
of black human hair on it. Calling his
mates the three set to work digging with
tneir hands, and a foot below the surface
a human head was uncovered. It was
Preston's.
The rest of this portion of the story is
soon told. When the discovery was made
the sun was setting, and the officers in

PENNSYLVANIA'S
CAPITOL BURNED
An Ancient but Costly
Structure Reduced to
Ruins.
Both Branches of the Legislature
In Session When the Flames
Appear.
Lawmakers and Newspaper Men Com
pelled to Jump From Windows
to Sav-* Their Lives.
_
HARRISBURG, Pa.,* Feb. 2.â A fire
which started in the rooms of Lieutenant-
Governor Lyon some time this morning
swept through the ancient Capitol of
Pennsylvania and within an hour and a
half after the breaking out of the flames
the structure was in ruins. The Senate
and House were about to reconvene for
their afternoon session when the lire burst
through the walls and the lawmakers
were driven for their lives to the open air.
As far as known no one was killed, but
a number of people were in the building
trying to save furniture and other effects
when the dome fell in, and it is possible
that some one may be buried under the
ruins.
.r.te a number of people were cut and
bruised by falling debris or smothered by
smoke, but up one was seriously hurt.
The most vuluable of the State and
legislative records ' which were in the
building were saved, but the records and
statistics of the Department of Public In
struction were destroyed.
The Legislature will find a temporary
home to-morrow the Senate in the rooms
of ths Supreme Court and the House in
the United States District Court. The
Legislature will at once take steps to have
the Capitol rebuilt. The total loss is esti
mated at nearly $1,000,000, on which there
is an insurance of but $200,000. The origin
of the fire is unknown.
Shortly before I o'clock, as the Presi
dent of the Senate was rapping that body
to ord r, a puff of smoke made its way
into the chamber. A hastily improvised
bucket brigade traced the fire to the
apartments of Lieutenant-Governor Lyon
on the floor above the Senate chamber,
but their efforts were useless.
When it seemed that the buildinc was
in serious danger, the Senate attaches
turned their attention to saving the Sen
ate and State records, and the handsome
furniture, and before this work was com
pleted many of the men were laboring at
the risk of their lives.
In the opposite wing of the building the
House was about to reconvene. By the
time the people in the House had realized
the seriousness of the situation, they were
in peril of their lives.
â¢ The flames and smoke made their way
into the chamber and drove the throng
headlong before them. So rapid was their
advance* that some people had no time to
even make their escape by the doors, but
were compelled to jump from the win
dows to the ground.
This was the case with the legislative
reporters of the United Associated Presses
who had remained in the rotunda tiling
bulletins. While at this wort the scaf
folding which had been used by painters
who were decorating the dome fell with a ;
crash. To save their lives both men
jumped from a window and escaped with
slight injury.
AUSTJM CUKHI.s'S XSTATE.
Sensational Hill lil.d in a United States
District Court.
MACON, Ga., Feb. 2.â A sensational bill
has been hied before United States Dis
trict Judge Spear by L. F. Felder, formerly
of New York and one of the late Austin
Corbin.'s closest confidants, against the
Corbin estate and the various English and
American loan companies connected with
it. A receiver was immediately appointed
and an injunction granted against the Cor
bin Banking Company and the loan com
panies.
Tht! receiver, E. P. Williams of Macon,
Ga., was directed to take charge of all the
assets of the Corbin Banking Company
and the loan companies in this State, in
volving property, mortgages and money
exceeding $1,000,000. The injunction pro
hibits realizing by the mortgage compa
nies of any. of their properties or
money ia this State pending final
adjudication, and it is held that
upon the appearance and answer
to the bill by the defendant the jurisdic- i
tion of the order and decree of injunction
will pertain to the entire United States
and this event will tie up the large Corbin
banking-house in New York and invest
ments in rue United States aggregating
many millions of dollars.
The complainant is Thomas J. Felder.
From 1876 to 1893 he represented the Cor
bin Banking Company in Georgia, South
Carolina and Alabama, with headquarters
in Atlanta. He loaned thousands of dol
lars on farm mortgages and was well
known in business and social circles.
In 1893 Felder went to New York to take
entire charge of the Southern business of
the Corbin Banking Company and the
loan companies for which it acted, or
claimed to act, as agent. He had no fined
arrangement as to salary, but as much as
$20,000 was passed up to his credit on the
books of the Corbin Banking Company.
He now claims large commissions due
him.
KEELEY CURE DECISION.
. Counties Xot Responsible for Treatment
. . of Indigent Inebriates.
MADISON. Wis., Feb. The Supreme
Court to-day handed down a decision
which declares unconstitutional the law
under which county courts have com
mitted -to Keeley institutes throughout
the State indigent inebriates for treat
ment at the expense of the county from
which they were committed. The test
case was on an appeal from the decision
of the Circuit Court of Milwaukee, which
held that Milwaukee County was liable
for the cost of treatine a patient com
mute! tothe Wisconsin Keeley Institute.
The Supreme Court reversed the decision.
. Milwaukee County alone will be relieved
of paying nearly $30,000 for treatment
under such commitments, and settlement
of claims in many other counties has been
held in abeyance. pending a decision as to
the constitutionality of the law.
. COMPLICATED WILL CASE.
Easy Manner in Which a Bank Presi
dent Gained a Fortune.
VIENNA, Ga., Feb. 2.â The will of Dr.
Marvin, disposing of $200,000 worth of
property, was admitted to probate yester
day. Dr. Marvin came here from Ne
braska â  many years ago and married a
woman of some wealth in Atlanta. Upon
his death, in Crodelle, four years ago, the
laoy was so disconsolate that she refused
to allow his body to be buried, but had it
fixed up with electrical appliances,' and
kept it in her parlor for over a year, when,
upon her marriage to Joseph E. Bivens,
the president of the Crodelle Bank, she
removed the body and had it interred in
Macon. Shortly afterward she dropped
dead in her home.
After the death of Dr. Marvin, a young
man appeared upon the scene from Ne
braska, claiming to be the son of Dr.
Marvin, and setup a claim to his entire
estate. This contest was filed yesterday
at tbe same time as the delayed will
leaving all the property to the wife.
Under the Georgia laws the husband is
heir to property of bis wife as well as her
children. In case of no children,, he is
the sole heir. Thus it happens that Presi
dent Livens was the beneficiary of the
entire amount of Dr. Marvin's estate.
WHO SHOT VOLIAXDER'!
Guilt of C Malli-y and. Santry JV'otl* a
Matter of Doubt.
CHICAGO. 111., Feb. 2.â ln the trial of
Alderman Thomas J. O'Malley and John
Santry, charged with the murder of Gus
Coliander at the polling-booth on Oak
street in November, 1891, Officer Michaels
swore positively that O'Malley was pres
ent and took a hand in the riot which
ended in the death oi Coliander.
Michaels, who survived the riot after
receiving a painful bullet wound in the
Knee, swore that he saw a crowd of rioters
enter the booth, headed by O'Malley. He
beard the command civen by one of the
rioters to hold un their hands. He looked
up and saw O'Malley with a revolver
pointed at his (Michaels') head. He tnrew
up O'Malley's arm and the bullet went
into the ceiling. Michaels identified San
try as being, one of the foremost in the
riot.
Cioss-examination, vigorously conduct
ed by the prisoners' attorn- failed to
shake his evidence. After Dr. Henrotin
had given a technical description of the
wound which resulted in Coliander's
death, the defendants' counsel called Of
ficer Michaels for the purpose of further
cross-examination, and this â  time suc
ceeded in securing several important ad
missions and confusing the officer.
The court then took a recess.
After recess the cross-examination of
Officer Michaels was resumed. He said
that he drew his own revolver and holding
his arm close to his side fired two shots.
He could not extend bis arm because of
the struggling crowd in the darkness.
Attorney Donahue for tne prisoners said
that upon this admission he would at
tempt to prove that Michaels shot Colian
der.
O'Malley's defense is an alibi.

Strike in a JiLa Tin Factory.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. 2.-A strike of
large proportions is on at the big tin
manufacturing establishment of Norton
Brothers, in Maywood, as the result of a
10 per cent reduction in wages made
yesterday. The strikers claim that 100 of
the 900 employes were at work to-day and
that in a day or two the factory will be
compelled to shut down entirely. Man
ager jNorton, however, asserts that the
strike has not assumed serious propor- I
tions, that the company employs only j
650 men now and that not more than half !
are on strike, embracing the unskilled !
laborers. The strikers behaved threat- !
eningly toward all men who applied for I
work in their places, and serious trouble is
feared. The new-comers were assailed
with insulting epithets and pelted with
snowballs on their way to the factory.

BUDD AS MUCH TO
BLAME AS ANY ONE
Leavitt Speaks About the
State Printing
Expanses.
Feeling Created by the Refusal
to Sign the Bill for an
Appropriation.
The Chief Ex cutive S.ys He Awaits
a Report From the State Printer
Before Acting.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 2.âConsid
erable feeling has been created among the
Republican majority by the declination of
the Governor to sign the bill appropriat
ing $75, C00 to pay the expenses of the
State Printing Office.
The appropriation was recommended
by the Ways, and Means Committee and
was considered in caucus by the Republi
can party, which caucus suggested that it
would be politic to cut down the appro
priation to $30,000 in order that a nght
with the Democratic and Populist mi
nority might be avoided. The bill then
went to tne Senate, which body after care
ful inquiry raised the appropriation to
$75,000.
Assemblyman Leavitt moved that the
House concur in the Senate amendment
and the motion was carried. The bill was
then sent to the Governor for his signa
ture and still remains there.
The Governor hag called upon the State
Printer for a statement that will at least
require sixty days to get out. The State
Printer has set men at work on this state
ment, and will give the best and most
complete that car. be made. In the mean
time the minority have introduced a bill
appropriating $30,030 for the State Printer
for tho running expenses of his office
during the present session.
Assemblyman .Leavitt of Alameda has
the matter in hand for the Republicans.
He said to a Call reporter to-day:
"The Governor desires very much- to
veto the $75,000 appropriation, and the
$30,000 bill has been put in by the minor
ity for the purpose of giving the Governor
some grounds or reasons for vetoing the
original bill. It is safe to say that the
minority will not carry their point. The
Governor is chairman of the State Board
of Examiners, and every cent of money
that bas been expended by the State
Printer within the last two years and that
will be expended as long as the Governor
continues in office has been and must be
audited by him before it is paid, so that
if there has been any extravagance on the
part of th<s State Printer Budd is just as
guilty as any one, because he has signed
and O K'd the bills passed by the Board
of Examiners.
"There is no valid reason," continued
Mr. Leavitt, "why Budd should refuse to
set apart $75,000, as he will have the
checking and auditing power' over every
ten cent* that will be expended by the
State Printer. The State printing office
is simply a machine. Every State officer,
commission or State institution has a
right to draw upon the State Printer a
requisition for printing. He has no dis
cretion in the matter, but must do the
printing whenever requested. The work
may cost five cents or a million dollars.
He is compelled to do it, no matter what
the cost may be.
"The expenses of the State printing
office have been materially increased by
reason of the extravagance of State offi
cials, the Governor included," added Mr.
Leavitt with emphasis. '"If they would
draw up their messages and reports prop
erly in the first place, so that so much
matter would not have to be cut out and
reset, and so much time would not have
to be taken up lor the correction of proofs,
there would be a great decrease in the
amount of money expended for State
printing.
By the time the city fire department
had arrived on the scene the flames were
pouring through the roof of the building.
There was a driving snowstorm, and a
strong northwest wind doomed the build
ing to destruction. Within an hour and
a half after the fire broke out the building
was in ruins.
The State Capitol was a handsome brick
structure situated on a knoll in a park of
ten acres. It was 180 feet long, 80 feet
wide, with a circular lonic portico in front
and was surmounted by a fine dome. It
was begun in 1819 and first occupied on
January 28, 1822. The original cost of the
structure, including grounds, was $295,688,
but since its erection it had been fre
quently embellished at large cost. With
in the last two years it had been remod
eled at a cost of $150,000, and the hand
some frescoing in the legislative chambars
was even yet uncompleted.
"This Legislature has been extravagant
in many matters of printing which should
be cut down, but whatever has been done
is not chargeable to the Printer but to the
Legislature and the State officials who or
dered printing in the manner in which
they did.
"The Governor must sign the $75,000
appropriation or be must put himself in
the position of delaying the work of the
Legislature. If there has been any ex
travagance Governor Budd is as guilty as
any man on the face of the earth."
Governor Eudd was asked by a Call re
porter to-night for a reply to the remarks
of Assemblyman Leavitt. The Governor
replied that be had simply met Mr.
Leavitt and had nothing to do. with him
directly or indirectly. He did not pro
pose to get into a newspaper discussion
with the gentleman; it would be equiva
lent to a Justice of the Supreme Court
quarreling with an attorney. As the bill
appropriatinc $75,000 for the State Print
ing Office had passed both houses and
was then before him for consideration, he
deemed it improper to say anythine about
its merits.
"Mr. Johnst on is a State officer," con
tinued the Governor, "and he has re
ceived the same written notification from
me that I have given to every other per
son interested in any bill before me for
my signature. I shall be pleased to have
him call upon me and state bis case and
reasons why I should sign the bill. Until
Mr. Johnston has made his statement to
me with regard to the bill, or until be
fails to do so, it would be improper and un
fair for me to enter into a newspaper dis- ;
cussion of the matter. What I have to
say will be said in my message to the Leg
islature when I either sign or veto the
bill."
An examination of the minute-book of
the State Board of Examiners by The
Call reporter revealed the fact that on
July 31, 1896, Governor Budd declined to
pass upon any further bills for the Siate
Printing Office. He so notified the Attor
ney-General in writine. His reasons were
stated at the lime, but were not, transmit
ted to the people through the medium of
the press, because the relations between
State Printer Johnston and the Governor,
so say the friends of the Governor, had
always been of the most friendly char
acter. Attaches of the Governor's office
say that he has been grossly misrepre
sented in the press as to the quantity of
printing done by his order. It was stated
in one of the newspapers (not Thb Call,
which does not misrepresent facts) that
the Governor had a large quantity of East
ern reports bound at the State bindery at
an expense of $2000 to the State.
The grain of truth in this mountain of
misrepresentation is that the Governor
had the reports of all. public institutions
in the State of California from the be
ginning of its history as a State bound
at a cost of $500 all told, and this valuable
library of reference is now in the Gover
nor's ofiice for the use of the Governor
and his successors and the legislators of
this and future sessions. The Governor
will gladly purchase the set for $500 cash
and will consider that he has made a
winning at the bargain counter.
It is said by the Governor's friends, for
he himself will not talk on the subject,
that his attention was first directed
toward the affairs of the State Printing
Office when Mr. Johnston, on July _*o,swore
to a claim for wages of people employed in
his office for worm done between Jul}' 1,
1806, and July 18, 1896, sixteen days. The
affidavit is in the following form:
State of California,}
County of Sacramento, i ' 8 '
A. J. Johnston, being duly sworn, deposes
and says that he is the Superintendent of
State Printing of the State of California and
that the items constituting the claims herein
were incurred in the manner and on the dates
as above shown, and that the services herein
mentioned were actually rendered and the
money is to be paid as herein mentioned, for
the benefit of the State.
In accordance with the foregoing affi
davit the bill was allowed by the Board of
Examiners on July 20. A short time after
this affair it came to the Governor's
knowledge that the printing office between
the dates mentioned had been shut down
for two Sundays, the 4th of July, the 9th
of July and a week of vacation, so that it
was evident that the State Printer had
sworn to a claim for sixteen days' work
when in fact the office had been closed for
ten days of that time.
The Governor inquired of Mr. Johnston
why be had sworn to such a claim. Mr.
Johnston said that it was time that the
office bad been closed, but that the bill
was really put in for overtime, etc., in
1895, the year before. He afterward made
another statement to the effect that bis
employes were entitled to two weeks' va
cation each year on full pay.
Governor Budd thereupon appointed an
expert to go into the matter, but he was
not allowed to look at the books of the
Printer, on the ground that he had no au
thority in the matter. The expert went
before tie Board of Examiners and asked
to be allowed to examine the payroll, but
he was refused.
The Governor's friends contend, for he
himself will not talk, that the expenses of
the State Printing Office have increased
much faster in proportion to the popula
tion than they should. The legislative
printing alone for four years ending June,
1895, during Johnston's administration
cost $120,000 in round numbers, while for
any four years prior thereto . the cost has
not exceeded $81,000.
Another objection to Johnston's ac
counts is that he does not furnish item
ized bills. All that the Board of Examin
ers have to go on is after this model:
Name, John Smith; occupation, foreman;
regular time six days, rate $5; total $30.
The same way in the bindery and in the
school-textbook department
It is expected that the will
turn himself loose in his message on the
matter. On the other hand, the friends
of the State Printer allege that Jim Budd
is simply doing Democratic politics.

Typographical Union No. 46 the following
set of resolutions wers drafted and adopt
ed and wero afterward unanimously
indorsed by the Bookbinders' Union and
by the Pressmen's Union:
Whereas, Through the agency of a sensa
tional press, evidently inspired from inter
ested sources, an attack has been made upon
the State Printing Office and its management ;
and whereas, in an overzealous attempt to
make cheap political capital on the one hand
and to accomplish selfish Interests on the
other, those ... making such attack have
found ft necessary to direct their assaults
at the labor employed in said printing
office and in the smallncss of their souls have
chosen for their target the women employed;
and whereas, many of the women so em
ployed are the widows of brave soldiers who
sacrificed their lives in defense of the flag
when the life of the Nation was in peril,
while many others are the sole dependence of
aged parents or of fatherless families; there
fore be it
Resolved, By Sacramento Typographical
Union No. 46, that while the women em
ployed in said State Printing Office are not
member, of any labor union (and a**e there
fore doubtless considered a safe branch of
labor for small politicians to attack), this
union nevertheless takes it upon itself to de
fend these workingwomen and to repel and
denounce as untrue the statement that their
employment has either been unnecessary,
that they have not rendered faithful and ef
ficient Service to the State or that their selec
tion for employment has been dictated either
by political considerations, religious creed or
by nationality.
Resolved, That the published criticisms of
the management of the State Printing Office
in reference to the number of women employed
therein are misleading and untrue, and dis
play a woeful lack of information on the
subject, and an utter Ignorance of the several
branches ol bindery work performed by the
women employed in salt office.
Resolved, That this union spurns and repels
attains made against faithful wage-earners
(whether they be male or female) by either
religious bigots or political shysters.
Resolved, That in the opinion of this union
these continual attacks on the State Printing
Office and those employed therein have their
origin with the notorious "scnoolbook ring"
and its agents, and it is our firm belief that
all this is being done in a covert endeavor to
again fasten upon the parents of the school
children of this State the exacting burdens of
the old schnolbooks of this combine.
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be
furnished to the press, to Governor James H.
Budd and to the honorable members of the
California Legislature under the seal of this
union. William Miner, President.
"When the public press can be suborned
to further the selfish political aims of one
man by making a sensational attack upon
the employes of the State Printing Office,
as was done by the Examiner this morn
ing," said an influential member of the
union to-night, "it is time that we take
such steps as lay in our power to protect
ourselves, for while nominally this attack
is directed against A. J. Johnson, State
Primer, in reality it is being made directly
against and will only affect the wa-e
--earner, as Mr. Johnson's office being a
statutory one, hits salary will go on
whether the State Printing Office is run
ning or not."

Republicans of California- Unite in
Congratulating Chairman McLaugh
'/-'.{ lin for His Enterprise.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. 2.â For the
first time in the history of California head
quarters of a State Central Committee
have been established in the Capitol and
will be maintained during the continuance
of the session of the Legislature. They
are under the supervision of Major Frank
McLaughlin, chairman of the Republican
- State Central Committee, and are in charge
of Jake Steppacher, secretary of the com
mittee, who is on duty here every day of
, the week.
While this departure is a new one for
MAJOR FRANK McLAUGHLIN, Chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, Who Has Established Headquarters
at the State Capital in the Interests of Beneficial Legislation
and Party Harmony.
this State it is in line with the intelligent,
patriotic and vigorous policy being our
sued by the Republican, party in the East, ;
Its object is to cement party affiliations
by providing a common ground where
jepresentaiiyes from all parts of the State
may meet and become better acquainted
with each other and with the interests of
every part of the commonwealth while in
formally discussing legislative matters.
By thus bringing into continuous and
Close touch the representatives of the vari
ous sections, industries and interests of
the State it is hoped 10 evolve legislation
that will redound to the benefit of the
Slate and the credit of the party.
These headquarters are located in rooms
65* and 66 of the Golden Eagle Hotel. The
principal subject being considered there
at this time is that relating to primaiy
elections. It is desired to procure the
passage of a bill that will secure uniform
and inexpensive primary elections
throughout the State on the same day.
Already there has been held an important
meeting of the Senate Committee on
Elections, at which the Strattou primary
election law was considered and amended.
To-morrow there will be a joint meeting
of the committees on elections of both
houses to consider the same measure and
all other bills pertaining to the same sub
ject for the purpose of incorporating all
their good features into one bill.
'. Active interest is being taken by the Re- '
publican State Central Committee in all po- |
litical questions pertaining to good legisla- !
tion. It has used its efforts and influence j
' with the Legislature in connection with
. joint resolutions favoring the Nicaragua
bill, in the interest of desirable tariff leg
islation by Congress for California prod
ucts." and other matters of National
concern.
By thus making' the State organization
of.the Republican party a factor in behalf
,of desirable and wholesome legislation it
is hoped to lay the foundation for the
most compact, complete and thorough
organization of the party, even to the re
motest corner of the State, for the next
campaign. It is expected to bring all the
county organizations into harmony with
one another, and so weld their interests
and ambition*- that all will co-onerate With
energy and enthusiasm to bring about
party success.
â¢ In this connection it may be stated that
hereafter the Republican State Central
Committee will . maintain permanent
.headquarters between campaigns as well
as. during the neat of battle. These are
now located at the Palace Hotel, San
Francisco. Heretofore it has been the
. practice to close tho headquarters imme
diately the campaign is over. Major Mc-
Laughlin, who has kept in continuous
â correspondence with the National Com
mittee, has inaugurated the new policy
on the suggestion of Mark Hanna^chair
man of the National organization. The
same policy has been recommended for
.every State in the Union.
Close communication is being main
tained between the headquarters here and
'in San Francisco. Copies of all bills, reso
lutions and constitutional amendments
are sent to the San Francisco headquar
ters, where tney can be studied by all who
take any interest in legislative matters.
Major McLaughlin oscillates between the
; two headquarters and the San Francisco
â  oflice is as well equipped for imparting in
formation relative to pending and pro
posed legislation as Secretary Steppacher
at headquarters here.
Another good purpose that it is pro
posed to carry out at the San Francisco
headquarters is the encouragement of gen
eral legislation. Any pel son who has any
suggestions tb make for new legislation or
objections or commendations to offer for
pending matters will be cordially wel- '
corned there and his views will receive all
due consideration.

EVANGELIST MOODY REPLIES TO JORDAN.
BOSTON, Maps., Feb. 2.â D wight L. Moody, who is conducting revival services here, paid his respects to Professor Jor
dan of Leland Stanford Jr. University in characteristic fashion to-day. * He quoted Professor Jordan as saving last Sunday
in a public address that "Whisky, cocaine and alcohol brought temporary insanity, and so did a revival of religion. Of
these religious revivals, in which men lost all their reason and self-control, this was simply a form of drunkenness no
more worthy of respect than the drunkenness which lay in the gutters."
Evangelist Moody said : "The president of Stanford University has set up a man of straw, and I see no necessity for
the knocking of it down. If there is a spot on earth where a revival is needed it is in California, and no one knows it
better than Professor Jordan. It is a big job; all I want to tackle. I suppose Mr. Jordan would say that Paul was beside
himself, but the letters of Paul are read long after the works of college presidents are forgotten. If men and women are
losing their reason and self-control during the revival season in the city of Boston I rather guess the newspapers would
have made it known to the general public long before this. I can criticize my work better than Mr. Jordan can. I know
the faults and shortcomings better than he. But Ido not think that any sucu statement as comes from 'he Pacific Coastâ
if it be correctly reported â is worthy of serious comment.''
impressed with the outlined plans of
Major McLaughlin and the latter gentle
man is in receipt of congratulatory letters
from all over the State on his new and en
terprising departure.
BULLA AAD iliÃ LOBBYIST.
Promise of a Sensational Exposure in
the Senate.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. 2.â There
promises to be a sensational exposure on
the floor of the Senate to-morrow as tne
result of the defeat to-day of Senator
Bulla's measure for the certification of
land titles and the simplification of the
transfer of real estate, an act based on the
celebrated Torrens act, in successful ope
ration in Australia and other English col
onies for many years.
This measure occupied more time to
day when put on its third reading than
any measure heretofore considered by the
Senate.
Senator Bulla made a strong appeal for
its passage, and admitted it would proba
bly lessen the business of attorneys and
title-searchers, but declared that with him
nublic interests came before private bene
fits.
Senator Gillette spoke against the bill
and it was defeated by a margin of one
vote, tne rollcall showing 18 in its favor
and 19 aeainst it- Bulla changed his vote
and nave notice of reconsideration, which
will be asked to-morrow.
Alter the adjournment. Senator Bulla
said he felt confident he would secure the
| passage of the bill when it was reconsid
ered. He has been working arduously
I and lone on the measure which is .1 vol
| uminous document of 16,000 words, and
j he is out lor its passage heart and soul.
In explaining his expression of confi
; dence in its Ultimate success, he said that
he had been approached by a certain gen
; tleman who frequented the lobbies. This
! individual, he said, had offered his ser
! vices in b -half of the bill, of course, for a
! consideration. Bulla declined his proffer,
j and the Senator from L,os Angele* now
j declares that this same individual has
I been lobbying against the bill. He de- 1

As to Killing Ducks.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 2.â Senator
Dickinson to-day Introduced a bill that is
looked upon as a trump card played in the
interest of the lease-holders of the game
preserves of the Suisun mantle*. It makes
the killing of wild ducks between the
hours of .5. p. M. and 7 A. m. illegal, and
makes the discharge of a firearm between
those hours prima facie evidence of the
offense described in the bill.

1 friend of Dr. W. P. Matthews, the incum
j bent of the offico of State Librarian, ru
mors were afloat that he would not con
; sent to vote for Matthews' removal unless
it was agreed to retain Matthews as assist-
I ant librarian. This created much sur
prise and talk, as it had been given out
j that all the candidates for Library Trus-
I tees had been pledged to institute a purely
j Republican regime in the Slate Library,
It was further rumored that Neff's
pledge left him an opening for supporting
Matthews for assistant librarian. All
doubts of Neff's position, however, were
, set at rest by the production of his pledge,
j sent by telecraph. It is as follows: "If

TRAXSFER OF THE GIRLS.
Favorable Report on the Plan to Send
hem to Santa Clara.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 2.-No op
position from a single source or individual
has manifested itself to the proposition to
transfer the girls now in the State school
at Whittier to the former Home for Feeble,
minded in Santa Clara County, and there
is a prospect that, so far as the Senate is
concerned, the bill on the subject now be
ing prepared by Senator Morehouse will
be passed without a dissenting vote.
Ti;e special committee appointed by the
Senate to visit and inspect the buildings
near Santa Clara City, which are to be
used for the girls, made their report to
day. It follows: 7â . .
- Your committee appointed to visit the build
ings and site formerly occupied as a Home for
the Feeble-minded at Santa Clara, with a view of
locating there the gins now confined in the
lemale department oi the State School at Whit
tier, beg leave to report that they have per
formed that duty and, in connection with the
Governor, have visited the said buildings and
grounds and thoroughly inspected the same,
and beg leave to report as follows: â¢ â¢ â¢
There are four distinct buildings.two of which
can be used for resident purposes, and one of
which * can be used us an assembly hall and
playroom and the fourth as a laundry or work
room and power-house.
One of the buildings is bo constructed that
it can easily be divided into two separate and
distinct apartments, thus making, with one of
the separated buildings, three distinct cot
tages for the use oi the inmates.
ft is hardly necessary to point out the ad
vantages of being thus able to keep entirely
distinct from each otner the several classes of
inmates, as the reform work is very much en
couraged and facilitated by such segregation.
The buildings are now iii a good state of re
pair, but will need flooring, pa* ering and
painting, which will cost about $3000. The
plumbing is in good shape, and, although
some of the rooms had been closed for a long
time, there was no dampness or odor percepti
ble.
There are fifty-one acres of grouud surround
ing the buildings with a fine grove of trees.
The dings are connected by a covered
walk, so that even in the most inclement
weather tnere will be no inconvenience in
patting from one to the other. They are large
and commodious and when occupied' by the
Home for the Feebie-minded. the buildings
afforded accommodation for 150 children with
their necessary attendants. They could prob
ably accommodate nearly -JOO girls at the pres
ent time.
The institution has an ample supply of
water, but the city authorities have offered to
furnish free of cost fifty gallons of water per
capita per diem if the present water supply
should prove inadequate. This certainly
would be ample for any possible demand of
the institution.
The city of Santa Clara also offers to extend
its sewerage system so as to connect with that
of the institution, and to furnish free of cast
electric lighting for the grounds and. if it can
be so arranged, for the building*, the latter
also free or at a very small cost.
The institution is iocs ted on elevated ground,
some little distance from the city of Santa
Clara. It commands a tine view of the valley,
and is a beautiful and healthful spot. It has
the advantage of lying some distance from the
put-lie road and being a long wav from any
large city. The proximity of Los Angeles is
one of the principal objections to the present
location of the girls* school at Whittier.
At small cost the girls could raise poultry,
do their own dairying and butter-making and
be largeiy self-sustaining. There is a further
advantage that the institution would have no
connection even in name with any other
reformatory. .Experience has shown that
where boys and girls are both Inmates of the
same Institution, even when entirely sepa
rated from each other, yet the common name
acts as a connecting link between them and
has the effect ot demoralizing tbem and re
tarding iheir progress toward the right when
they leave the institution.
After having carefully examined this insti
tution and tne advantages which it presents
for the purposes proposed, your committee
would urgently recommend that at the earli
est possible moment the girls at present com
muted to the State school at Whittier be
transferred to the former Home for the Feeble
minded at Santa Clara, and they feel confident
that the result will be to the best interests of
the children of the Slate and to all concerned.
DUCKWORTH O.V THE STAAD.
Offers the Committee . Miss Bertola's
Salary, as She Refuses to Ace -pt It.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 2.â S. J.
Duckworth, chief clerk of the Assembly
and Clerk and Assessor of Monterey, is
one of ihe smoothest, slickest witnesses
that ever appeared before a legislative in
vestigating committee.
He gives his testimony in a suave, plau
sible manner, and has an answer ready on
the tip of his tongue for any question, no
matter how disquieting its nature may be.
When be appeared before the commit
tee at 4 o'clock this afternoon he looked
remarkably bright for _a. man who had
been laid up for two weeks with nervous
prostration. But he carried a stout cane
and leaned on it as though "groggy on his
pins," to use a prize-fighting phrase.
He occupied the stand for two hours,
and in response to questions by his coun
sel, Judson C. Brusie. told the story of his
having been importuned by Assembly
men to place people on the temporary
roll, and how he had done so to oblige
them ; he had no hand either in fixing or
paying their salaries. He had determined
ihat his first appointee should be Miss
I Bertola, grand president of the Native
Daughters of the Golden West.
He placed her on the roll and she sent
up a power of attorney to collect her .sal
ary. Billy, Lanphrey collected the $35
voted to her by the Assembly and banded
it to Duckworth. Duckworth gave it to
H. Friedman and Grant Towle with in
structions to forward it to Miss Bertola at
! Mills Colleee. The money was sent by
express and she acknowledged the receipt
of it. ,â  â 
Then Mr. Duckworth presented a money
order signed by Miss Bertola in his favor
for $35. She wished to refund the money
to the State as long as there had been any
dispute about It.
The committee declined to receive the
money, and Mr. Duckworth said t hat he
would pay it into the State Treasury.
Mr. Duckworth testified further that
when he learned that Gunzendorfer and
Rodriguez had not come to the Capitol as
they had promised, to take part in the
temporary organization, he immediately
ordered that the warrants for their pay
should not be drawn. The committee
then adjourned subject to the call of the
chair.
HILL WITHDRAW THE BILLS.
Senator Wolfe Did Aot Realize What a
Storm Be Was Creating.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 2.â Owing
to the opposition manifested and views
advanced by the San Francisco Butchors'
Board of Trade relative to the bills giv
ing additional power to the boards of
h-alth of counties and cities, Senator
Wolfe, who introduced these measures,
will withdraw them to-morrow. He said
to-night:
"I introduced the Board of Health bills
at the request of Mr. McEnerney, the at
torney for the Board of Health of San
Francisco. I did not examine closely into
the bills and never realized how far
reaching they were at the time. I was
surprised on my returning from the trip
to Southern California with the commit
tees of the Senate to find that the Butch
ers' Board of Trade of San Francisco op
posed the measures. I read their pamph
let and quite agree with their views. I
shall to-morrow ask leave of the Senate to
withdraw the bills."
CORN AND CHEMICALS.
Said to Have Supplunted Barley and
Malt in Beer-Making.
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 2.â A dispatch from Mil
waukee says: The tremenaous drop in the
barley malt product has stirred up the malt
sters, aud they evince a disposition uapiake
some interesting disclosures. They freely de
clare that in many breweries a barrel of beer
is being made with the use of btit a half-bushel
of barley malt, while the German standard for
pure beer is three bushels. The claim is as
freely made -that' corn and chemicals have
practically supplanted barley in the produc-
I tion of the beverage of the world.
When the attention of Mr. Aue. A.
Busch, vice-president of the Anheuser-
Busch Brewing Association, was called to
the above article he expressed no surprise
in seeing the dispatch from Milwaukee,
calling attention to the tremendous drop
in the barley malt product, but wondered
why more had not been said in public
print with reference to the matter. Con
tinuing, he -said: "We do not now, nor
have we ever, used corn in the production
of any of our beers, and we have always
contended that first-class beer cannot be
made by using corn as a substitute for
barley malt." .

TELLING ORATORY
CARRIES THE DAY
Boyce Wins a Victory for
' Labor in the State
Senate.
Withington's Opposition to the
Measure Melts Away Before
the Arguments.
Passage of the Bill to Prevent Colin*
sion Between Employers an!
Employment Agents.
SACRAMENTO, Cai,., Feb. 2â Oratory
of considerable merit was displayed on the
floor of the Senate to-day for the first time
since the present session. It was evoked
by the consideration of two measures in
the interest of labor.
Senator Boyce led the fight for labor
and won a decisive victory. He was ably
supported by Senator Gillette. The
measure which started the flow of elo
quence was Boyce's bill to prevent collu
sion between employers of labor and em
ployment agents, and which makes it a
misdemeanor for any employer to be di
rectly or indirectly interested in any fee
received by an employment agent for se
curing employment for an applicant.
I Opposition to tbe measure was inaugu
rated by Senator Withington, who ob
jected to the section which makes it the
duty of the Comissioner of Labor to en
lorce the act. lie took occasion to say
that so far as his part of the State was
concerned it nad no knowledge of any
work having ever been done by the Labor
Commissioner except what was done in
the newspapers. He claimed that the act
could be enforced by the regular prose
cuting official. *.';*."'.
Boyce made an eloquent plea for the
preservation of the section. He stated
that the law was made not for the strong
man, but for the weak man, frequently
ignorant of his rights. He declared
it was often an impossibility to get any
one to sign a complaint against a rich and
influential employer, and that prosecuting
officers were often remiss in their duties.
For these reasons ne thought it desirable
to place it in the power of an official
whose special duty it is to look after
labor's interest to enforce this particular
act.
The bill was passed by a vote of 24 to 13.
The champions of labor also carried off
the honors in the controversy over the
bill providing that only citizens of the
United States should be employed on pub
lic works. Senator Morehouse desired to
have it amended so as to permit employ
ment on public wort being given to those
who had declared their intention to be
come citizens. He argued that every per
son now in the United States had been in
vited to come to this country, and should
not now be discriminated against. He
added that the remedy for imported alien
labor lay in the proper restriction of im
migration.
Senator Bulla pointed out that the
amendment proposed by the Senator from
Santa Clara virtually nullified the act, as
it was a notorious fact that many persons,
for interested motives, declare their in
tention to become citizens, but never take
out their final papers. The amendment
was lost and the bill was passed.
The eight-hour bill also passed the Sen
ate to-day, not, however, until it was
amended by excepting municipal cor
porations from its opsration. Senator
Morehouse secured the amendment. He
represented that . San Jose â and, he be
lieved, other municipalities â was in the
habit of making contracts for city work
by the month, and that the measure as
originally submitted would compel such
municipalities to make such contracts by
the day.
F'IXDS BAD MAXAGEMEST.
After a Junket Treacy Objects to Giving
More Money to State Institutions.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. The leg
islative junketers who visited State insti
tutions with Governor Budd last week
have returned, and their report will be
made public in a day or two. Assembly
man Treacy, who accompanied the party
as the representative of the minority, says
bard things about the management of
public institutions, and declares that
many of them are conducted ln a wasteful,
extravagant and shiftless manner. He
told a Call reporter to-day how the visit
had impressed him with reference to cer
tain appropriations asked for by those in
stitutions. He found that the Los Angeles
Normal School wanted $5000 for lighting a
room 52 by 30 feet, when the construc
tion of an additional window would serve
the purpose. The Stockton Asylum for
the Insane asks. s7ooo for a mansion for
the Superintendent and $3000 ior furnish
ing the same. The Superintendent and
his family are boarded free at the asylum,
and he is allowed- $100 for rent. Mr.
Treacy is therefore opposed to the appro
priation. . , .".',**
San Diego wants $25,000 for a wharf on
property the title to which is in litiga
tion. She also wants, a normal school,
while there is a normal school in Los
Angeles, 126 miles away, and to which
San Diego sends only seven pupils. She'
asks $30,000 for eh aning out the harbor,
yet ti. United States Government is now '
wording on a. breakwater, which will ren
der cleaning out the harbor unnecessary. j
The institution, at - Highlands asks
$60,000 for an administration building.
$30,000 for a drainage system and $10,000
for a new barn. In Mr. Treacy's opinion
an administration building is not needed,
"the institution not being an international
exposition." The barn is needed, but
$2uoo should build it, and the drains could
be arranged for $10,000. >
Whittier and Highlands ask for 100
additional acres oi land, lt is the im
pression that both institutions have more
land now than they can take care of. : â  ,
The committee found a peculiar con
dition of affairs at Whittier. The estab
lishment has about 300 boys, the daily
maintenance of which per head amounts
to 75 cents, while the care and mainten
ance of the patients in the Stockton In
sane Asylum amounts to only 35 cents per
day per head. The institution has an en
gineer, a tailor, a shoemaker, a laundry
man, a baker, a carpenter, a painter, a
blacksmith; a bricklayer and a brick- i
maker. !
The .attention of the committee was
called to a big crack in the brick wall of
one of the buildings' and to a big pile of
bricks made by the boys under the direc
tion of the bricklayer, and they wondered
why the institution could not bui.d its
own buildings and maintain and clothe
its inmates. The land is * some of the
finest in the State, sixty acres, and worth
$300 per acre, but the only crop is hay and
oranges.
The trustees are asking the State for an
appropriation with which to build a work
shop, and Mr. Treacy cannot see why the
carpenter, the bricklayer, the painter, the

LAAGFORD'S AMESDMEAT.
Opposition of the Minority to Abolishing
the Railroad Commission.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 2.â Fresh
interest was aroused to-day in the con
stitutional amendment introduced by
Senator Langford early in the session,
providing for the repeal of those sections
of the constitution which provide for the
creation and maintenance of the State
Board of Railroad Commissioners.
At the time the Committee on Consti
tutional Amendments had the measure
under consideration and decided to recom-
mend its passage Senator Braunhart was
"absent. It was known that he was op
posed to the abolition of the commission,
and the report of the majority of the com
mittee was withheld until he had time to
prepare a minority report. This he did
to-day, and the majority and minority re
ports will be submitted to-morrow. The
minority report takes a strong stand
against the wiping out of/the Railroad
Commission, and incidentally pays some
powerful left-handed compliments to the
Legislatures of the past. Its most striking
portions follow: //â .'â '
It will be well to recollect that when the
section establishing the Railroad Commission
was proposed for insertion in our present
State constitution the expediency as well as
the necessity of such a provision had been
fully demonstrated at nearly every session of
the Legislature, where all efforts to regulate
the scale of prices for freight and passengers
had either proven wholly or partially abortive.
Putting aside all imputations upon the in
tegrity of the law-makers, every Legislature
has failed to regulate fares and freights by the
establishment of maximum and minimum
rates. The debates that took place in the Con
stitutional Convention proclaimed that all
question of railroad should be placed far
irom the maddening hurly-burly of a sixty-day
Legislature and placed where there would be
a wise, calm and just exercise of the power of
control by the people of the State over the
transportation companies. '.
I. do not assume to.be a prophet of evil
like Cassandra, who saw nothing but evil flit
ting like a pestilential shadow over the ruins
of a desolate land. hut I warn you that if
you promote by your actions the scheme to
abolish this Uailroad Commission you. will
witness a biennial renewal of the " many
scenes of infamous memory â the blasting of
the reputations of hundreds of public men
and the unholy breaking of the most solemn
pledges. Should this Legislature in its wis
dom see fit to recommend that the provision
creating a Railroad Commission be stricken
from the constitution, not only would the
recent advantages so stubbornly fought ior
and won after- so many apparently insuper
able didiculties be entirely lost, but the result
would be that the railroad corporations would
have unrestricted license to establish such
rates as the managers of these corporations
would deem proper.
The people are aroused to a pitch that will
not brook paltering with the questions that so
vitally concern their very existence. The de
feat of men on 'account of their support of
measures intended to benefit corporate inter
ests utters a loud note of warning which those
ambitions for public preferment cannot in the
future afford to disregard.
Let me add, in conclusion, that any action
at this time, such as that contemplated by the â¢
majority report of this committee, might and
no doubt would serious iv affect the future of
the litigation now pending in the Unit d
States Circuit Court. For the fir.t time in ih_Â»
history of the State a foundation has been
laid by the Railroad Commission and its at
torneys for a thorough investigation in the
courts of the business and affairs of the South
ern Pacific Company and its leased lines That
investigation will undoubtedly throw a whole
some light upon tlfe methods of the great rail
road system which monopolizes the. trans
portation of almost the entire State.
the company, which by its affidavit-makers
swore itself to the verge of insolvency, will 1
feel confident, when culled to an actual ac
, counting of lis legitimate earnings and ex
penditures, be >und in a sufficiently healthy
financial condition to fully warrant the re
j duction of rates made by the commission.
Hasty action at this time by the Legislature *
j may circumvent all this; it may rob the peo
ple of their right to inquire, for the first time,
into the facts of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's dealings with them. It would certainly
cripple the efficiency of the commission until
its fate was decided, and it would necessarily
dampen the ardor of those who have fought
for the commission's very extstence and sus
tained it, and who are now fighting for the
commission's rights and for a just and true
showing of the railroad's business.
Railroad Commissioner' La Rue, who
resides here, is anxiously watching the
amendment and using every effort to pre
serve the existence of the body of which
he is now a member.
MISS EFFIK PEKKIXI OF SALINAS.
SALINAS, Monterey County, Cal.
I have never met a more enthusiastia
class of people than I did m Salinas, and
In fact all through Monterey County.
One of the most pleasing gentlemen with
whom I talked is Mr. George Perrinl. He
I told me that he had heard of many re-
markable cures that had been effected by
the use of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla,
and that he had occasion to prove; ihis to
his own advantage.
Some lime ago his little daughter, Effie
Perrini, was covered witti small sorps. A
bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla waa
bought and very moderate closes wero
given to the little girl. Before the entire
bottle was exhausted all the sores, liad dis-
appeared and Eflie got better. She con-
tinued to improve unti.l she is now a per-
fectly healthy child. He told me that he
had recommended Joy's Vegetable Sarsn-
parilia to many people and. that every one
was now praising the native remedy.
HENRY TILLMAN.
No druggist owns stock in Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla. Any druggist claiming
to pay its advertising bills is a fraud.
Don't let the drug clerk talk you into
buying something elso for Joy's Veg-etablo
Sarsaparilla. Ha laughs at you wtien
you leave the corner store with a substi-
tute. Watch him.

'Has from the railroad taken a single note

And every Sunday writes himself a liar.

: have rendered the public a service by com

character of tbat upright and honorable
' man, George K. Fitch.
*. . After having worked for years to blacken
the reputation of Mr. Fitch and break
down his business, after bavin*; hired
Bierce to lampoon him and sneaks to be
- tray him, after having pursued him witb
all the malice which mean minds feel for
worthy men, the managers of the Exami
ner now come forth and acknowledge tbat
Mr. Fitch is an honorable man. This
'may be hypocrisy, but. even if it is it
shows that once more vice has been forced <
to pay a tribute to virtue.
GEORGE K. FITCH VINDICATED.
''WmWe***^mmW*mW m a\m*
If The Call had done nothing else to merit public favor, it would at least deserve
credit for having compelled the managers of the Examiner, to do justice to the char
acter of George K. "Fitch. The malignant managers of that journal, who for years
pursued Mr. Fitch both in public and in private life with all the malice which mean
minds feel for genuine worth, have been forced to acknowledge his merit, and on
Monday in a double leaded and double column editorial they spoke of him as an
"honorable man."
It is possible that this tribute to Mr. Fitch from his vicious enemies was only
hypocrisy. Even if so, however, it is none the less worthy of note. It has been
written that '^hypocrisy is the tribute which vice pays to viitue," and even under the
supposition that the words written of Mr. Fitch were of insincere meaning and
hypocritical pretense tbeir publication is none the less an evidence that vice has had
to bow down to the vigor with which The Cam. has attacked it and render this tribute
to the character of an honest man.
The significance of the confession on the part of the Examiner can be fully under
stood only, by recalling the extent and degree to which it reviled, maligned, calum
niated, vilified, slandered, lampooned and belied Mr. Fitch through all the years of
its hatred of him as the honest manager and proprietor of an honest newspaper.
In the days when George K. Fitch stood in the forefront of honorable journalism
in California enjoyin*-* high repute among the people, based upon long services in the
cause of truth and of the State, the managers of the Examiner turned loose upon him
all the multitude of pups in their litter. Their attacks were incessant and were con
ducted both publicly and Â«*ecretly. They aimed to rain Mr. Fitch in reputation and
business. They spared no expense. They hesitated at no fraud. They balked at no
villainy in their efforts to accomplish their purposes against him.
( They hired Ambrose Bierce to lampoon him, and that rascal of the sorrel hair and
chestnut brain made his talents a burr unto Mr. Fitch, sharp and thorny, for weeks
and for months and for years. Bierce found the task of reviling and defaming this
honorable man a most congenial one. He dubbed Mr. Fitch "Deacon," thus giving
him a title which denotes dignity, rectitude and good. repute, and thereby provided
himself a target at which he could shoot every shaft of malice and satire which he
could invent or find by reading the books in which the masters of such invectives
have recorded their wit. He mocked at the dignity of Mr. Fitch, denied his rectitude
and reviled his repute, and by the ardor of his service in this mean work earned
double the stipend he was paid.
The managers of the Examiner did not stop at lampooning. They hired aids
for Bierce. They set rascals to work to undermine the business of Mr. Fitch. They
bribed his newsboys. They employed spies to track him. They engaged sneaks to
win his confidence and betray him. They pursued him in private and in public. By
every trick they could devise tney injured his reputation. They assailed his purse
as eagerly as his character. Their desire was to force him to pay blackmail to them
selves or else to destroy the journal which was everywhere recognized as the repre
sentative of the honesty and integrity of the people of California and therefore the
natural enemy of the Examiner. 77*
When the assaults of this foul gang began Mr. Fitch was already an old man. He
had been one of the pioneer editors of the State and the force and vigor of his youth
were gone. He was, moreover, by nature, training and principle unfitted to deal with
the malignant rascals who attacked him. He could not hire lampooners, black
mailers, spies and sneaks to fight his battles for him. As a consequence the Examiner
achieved a partial victory. The business of The Call was largely ruined and -Mr.
Fitch in his old age was forced to retire from the profession which he had adorned
and surrender the control of a paper which he had'built up by industry based upon
honor, integrity and fair dealing with all men. '
When Mr. Fitch retired from The Call the managers of the Examiner were jubi
lant. They thought they had ruined him, both in business and in ; reputation, and
that he would sink into obscurity while they lived in the sunshine of public favor.
The Call, however, did not die. It passed into the hands of younger, more vigorous
and more aggressive men. The new management took up the fight against cinch
bills and blackmail exactly where Mr. Fitch had left it. It has prosecuted that fight
and exposed the Examiner as a taker of subsidies from the railroad while posing as
th e pretended triend of the people. It has now forced the Examiner to come forth
and publicly acknowledge that Mr. Fitch ranks among honorable men, and that its
lampooning Bierces, its blackmailing Lawrences, its spies, sneaks and betrayers were
but liars and thieves when they assailed him. â â¢ " â  "
The present management of The Call has no little satisfaction in the accom
plishment of this vindication of Mi. Fitch. It confidently looks forward to the
time when other men who have been as bitterly assailed by the gang of blackmailers
whom Mr. Hearst retains will be as completely exonerated. Justice done to one
honest man will lead to doing justice to other?. The lampooners and the black- '
mailers will soon find themselves exposed thoroughly. What has been done thus far
by The Call is but the beginning. Every good citizen therefore can find cause foi'
gratification in the fact that we have forced the Examiner to recant its words and pay
a tribute even if tardy and hypocritical to the character of so honorable a man as
George K. Fitch.. 7* â¢*?"-.* 7 ; --..77 ..!,.. V
CINCH BILLS
There are abundant evidences that
among the measures introduced Into the
present Legislature there are a number
of the character which the popular voice'
has long since named "cinch bills." These
are designed not to promote the welfare
of the people, but to enable the authors
and their friends among disreputable
journalists to extort money from the
wealthy corporations of the State. Such
bills have become too common in Cali
fornia. It is time to put an end to them,
and this The Call intends to do so far as
it can by exposing them and denouncing
them. .
Our exposure of the Examiner Las noth
iny in it of personal antagonism. We at
tack it simply because it is the champion
of the twin offenses of blackmail jour
nalism and cinch-bill legislation. Our
war extends far beyond the Examiner of
fice. It reaches to all who are engaged in
the nefarious practice of extorting money
from men who are too timid to light pow
erful rascals, or else in their corruption
feel it necessary to feed an equal corrup
tion in others. 7..",.; .
It is clear to every intelligent mind that
we can never have good government in
California either for the State or for
municipalities- until these horse-leeches
which feed upo;. corruption are exter
minated. So long as corporations are
compelled to pay large sums of money to
blackmailing journalists and cinch-bill
legislators,* so long will they feel them
selves at liberty to recover what they have
paid to rascals by increased charges upon
the public. It cannot .be doubted that
many a rich corporation would retire
from politics and devote itself to legiti
mate business if it dared to do so. The
fear of blackmail and cinch bills prevents
it. The first step, therefore, toward a bet
ter condition of things is to send these
vicious agents to . the penitentiary, or at
least to so expose them as to render
them as impotent as they are impudent
To the work of exposing the schemes
of these rascals The Call is now devoting
its most earnest efforts. We have struck
the greatest and strongest among the black
mailers first. We will follow by attacking
the lesser rascals as soon as their ras
cality is made evident- We propose to
carry on the good fight begun by The*
Call in the old days of the management
of George K. Fitch, and to add to it all
the force, vigor and aggressiveness 'of
youth... We confidently appeal to all
honest men to' support us in the contest.
What we are doing can injure no legiti
mate business, and the man who is hurt
is only the rascal who is either engaged
in direct knavery himself or is seeking to
grow rich on the knavery of others.
M ! Â£INLEIÂ»S CABINET.
The selections thus far made for the
Cabinet of the incoming administration
give assurance that it will be one of the
most notable and vigorous in our history.
President-elect McKinley had an abun
dance of good men from whom to select his
advisers, and ha has chosen from the best
among tbem. The country can read the
list with more than ordinary satisfaction
and find therein a prom that ' the next
administration will conduct the affairs of
the Republic with efficiency and success."
To inspire confidence in the coming ad
ministration nothing -more is necessary
than to read over the names of the men
selected for Cabinet positions. They in
clude Sherman of Ohio, Qage of Illinois,
Alger of Michigan, Long of Massachu
setts, McKenna of California and Wilson
of lowa. If the remaining members of
he Cabinet be as well selected, it Is clear
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1897.
that the incoming administration will ba
J strong in every department and that no
] portion of the affairs of the Government
will be in weak or incompetent hands.
People of California in particular have
I good reason to be pleased with the make
up of the Cabinet. Our State will obtain
j in it at last the recognition which it' has
I long deserved. if, as now seems certain,
j Judge McKenna is the man chosen to rep
j resent California in the administration,
| his selection will be cordially approved
j even by those to whom the successful
! aspirant was not first choice. There is no
j question in this Stale as to the : fitness of
i Judge McKenna for the office of Secretary
of the Interior or of Attorney-General, nor
is there any question of his ab'lity to ably
; and worthily represent California. He is
j a strong man in every respect and we can
| well be proud of him as our first represen
tative in the Cabinet of the Nation.
The Cleveland Cabinet lias been so com-
I pletely a "deficiency administration' 1 that
i the incoming Cabinet will shine with
i added luster by contrast. It will not,
I however, need this contrast to add to its
j prestige. It will have such merit of its
J own that it will compare worthily and
j creditably with the best of its' predecessors.
j The President-elect has chosen each man
j for the particular office which he is best
( fitted to fill, and the result cannot fail to
I be beneficial both to his administration
j and to the welfare of the Republic.
EUEAL MAILS.
The first experimental free mail-delivery
route in the rural districts of California
has begun under favorable conditions.
The district in which the test is to be
made is that surrounding the postoffice at
Campbell, in Santa Clara County, and
none more propitious for the success of
the - experiment' can be found in the
United States.
It seems well assured the experiment
there wiil be successful if the people of
the district take the least interest in it
and endeavor to promote it. For' miles
around Campbell the land is divided into
small orchards, averaging hardly more
than twenty acres, so that a considerable
population is closely clustered around the
central office. The residents of the dis
trict, moreover, are highly cultured peo
ple. They are the class of men and
women wbo make large use of the mails.
They receive many newspapers and maga
zines and carry on an extensive corre
spondence. They have it in their power,
therefore, to make such use of the home
delivery of letters and papers as to justify
the National Government in making the
delivery a permanent after the experi
ment is over. "; *"â¢-". â¢'â '_'
It goes without saying that the people
around Campbell should do all in their
power to make the experiment successfuL
Something more than their own interest
is at stake. The welfare of other rural
districts in this respect will ,be largely
affected by the result which is obtained
tbere. If the first test shows the value of
a rural mail delivery the system will be
extended to other localities. All of Santa
Clara County and largo districts in other
sections of .California may reasonably ex
pect to obtain the same advantage if only
good results are shown in this first experi
ment. The test, therefore, will be watched
with interest in many section** of the
State, and the people of Campbell should
consider themselves subject to trial as
well as the system.
It is reported that two iron-masters in
Ohio bave devised an improved method
of making steel which is not only cheaper
than the Bessemer process, but has the
further advantage of producing a steel
which will take as fine a polish as nickel
and will bend before breaking.. The re
ported invention has naturally caused a
great deal of interest in the 'steel industry,
for if it is ail that is claimed for it many of
the big plants for making steel by the
present process will be rendered almost
valueless.
The people around Campbell, in Santa
Clara County, should do all in their power
to make successful the experiment -with
free rural mail delivery. -If* the system
works well there other sections of the
State will have a chance to get the same
advantage. â  -.. .. _.._.... 7^7;-^. v

PROFIiS OF .-ANDLOTISM.
S. F. Evening Post,
That the profits of sandlotism are not insig
nificant is amply proved by a recent trial
which took place at Paris, France. The action
was a suit for an accounting brought by a
journalist named Vaughan against . Henri
; Rochefort, editor of the lutranstgeant, the
leading sana lot organ of the republic. It ap
pears that when Itochefort went to Belgium
in 1880 with Boulanger he left Vaughan in
charge of his paper, agreeing to pay him for
his services a proportion of the profits. The
arrangement continued- during a period of
seven years, or until 1890. Then Vaughan and
Rochefort quarreled and the former sued -for
the value of his services, which involved a
complete exposure of the business of the pa
per. It appeared from the report of the ac
counting officers that during the seven year*
Rochefort received a salary of $20,000 a year,
besides dividends amounting in ail to $200,
--000 additional â or, as one correspondent puts
it, an income of $50,000 a year. The figures
are Interesting as showing how luxuriously
a man may live who makes a business of roast
ing corporations and abusing capitalists. A
professional reformer on a salary of $50,000 a
year is certainly a sight fit for the gods.
But France it not the only country in which
the business of fighting a "corrupt" and â¢â¢de
graded" condition of society is made ex
tremely profitable. A man could hardly throw
a stone anywhere in any American city with
out striking a newspaper engaged in the same
occupation, or an individual 'who hopes to
(tain a fat office by fulminating against cor
porations with soap-chewing vehemence. ,-The
remarkable feature ot all tht se, cases is that
the public seems to be continually taken in
by the "reformers." The rapidity with which
some of the sandiotters acquire wealth never
seems to strike it as curious or worthv^"!
reflection. -_â.
DEATH PKNALIY for TRAIN rob

Indianapolis Journal. ' J't'l â -
, The bill which is before Congress providing
that the penalty of train, robbery shall be
death has merit, in view of the fact that dur

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
g â¢â¢Cupid" Danforth is one of the best known
men in San Francisco. In everyday life he
signs himself as Fred R. Danforth. but nobody
about the new City Hall knows him by that
name. You might, wander about the corridors
of that labyrinthine temple of municipal juris
prudence for a week and not meet *a single
person who could tell you where to find Fred
R. Danforth, but just ask for "Cupid". Dan
forth and instantly the reply would be, "Oh,
yes; I know. him. You'll find him in the
marriage license department of the County
Clerk's oflice.' '
Mr. Danforth has had many years of
experience in this branch of the clerk's
business under successive County Clerks, and
has seated the fates of thousands who desired
to enter the holy state of matrimony.
He has the right under the law to exercise
his discretion' in regard to the issuance ot
marriage licenses, and with gentle firmness
be construes the law touching this important
matter. â¢ _ '.''':'â '
Naturally a man is somewhat flurried and
FREDCR. DANFORTH, Deputy County Clerk. Nicknamed "Cupid."
generally he is in a hurry when he applies
for a marriage license, but before he gets
througb with his interview with "Cupid"
Danforth all the ardor of haste has evaporated
and he realizes that even the preliminaries of
marriage are solemn observances, not to be
lightly or inconsiderately treated by the can
didate for marital happiness.
Sometimes Mr. Danforth is compelled to re
fuse to issue a license because of - the tender
age of the would-be bride. In such a rase all
his generous ahd chivairic nature is aroused,
and he couches his denial of the coveted docu
ment in language so courteous that even the
disappointed applicants are loth to complain.
In such cases, however, he has need of ail his
strongth of character, for bright eyes, enchant
ing smiles and pouting lips plead mightily for
the young suitors. But he is adamant, never
theless, and nothing less than the sworn con
sent oi the little lady's parents will gain her
the document that will set the marriage bells
a-ringing.
Divorced people have to answer all . the
questions provided for by the statute. If they
say they were divorced in- San Francisco Mr.
Danforth will go with them to the court rec
ord and look up the facts lor them. If all is
satisfactory and the decree has been granted
they get the paper. If not, they must wait
until all legal defects are mended, or go to
some other county where the officers of the
law are less rigid in the performance of a duty
of tne highest importance to the people of the
commonwealth..
Sometimes the divorced applicants are an
gry and sometimes they are ( grateful. One of
the latter came from Portland to marry the
lady of his matured nit, ctions.
"Ever married before?" asked "Cupid" Dan
forth, as by the code required.
â¢â¢Yes," was' the reply.
"Wife dead?"
Â»No.''
"Divorced?"
; "Yea." *> -"7_-.**"
"When?"
"In San Francisco. The summons was served
on me in Portland, and I let the case go by de
fault. I heard from my wife that the divorce
was granted."
"Well, let's look up the recoÂ»i."
A friend of the applicant who was present
here interposed, and insisted that it was only
taking time, and hinted that only a crank
would doubt the word of the gentleman from
Oregon, who happened to be firm looking and
wealthy.
"If you are all right on the record it won't
do you any harm to look," insisted .Mr. Dan
forth.

It was Christmas week and a young man on
a bike was confidently riding up F street. A
heavy carriage drawn by two prancing bays
came spinning up the sireet at the same time.
The young man was fairly run into the gutter
by the turnout, and to save himself from being
crushed he jumped off his wheel. The bays
were drawn up to the curb in great style and
the lady occupant of the carriage stepped out
to go into a store. She instantly took in the
catastrophe, j The whe-1 was almost a wreck
and the rider was looking around for his hat-
She stepped right up to him and inquired if
he was hurt. - Being assured that he was not
she took out a card and wrote a few lines on
it and gave it to him, saying:
"Have your wheel repaired and send the bill
to Mr. Thurber with this card. lam very glad
you were not hurt." t. .*â¢

SENATOR FRYE
GETS A ROAST
A Mass - Meeting That
Spcke Out Loud for
"Poor Jack."
MAYOR PHELAN ENTERS
HIS PROTEST.
The Arago Decision Charac
terized as on a Line With
the Dred Scot
TREATMENT OF THE SAILOR A
BLOT ON THE FLAG.
Telegrams From Senators Perkins
and White and Congressman
Maguire.
At a mass-meeting held last evening at
Metropolitan Temple, strong resolutions
were passed condemning the substitutes
of Senator Frye to the bills recently
passed by the House of Representatives
for the relief of eailors, and incidentally
the Snreme Court decision in trie matter
of the barkentine Arago was severely
criticized.
Tne House bill is intended, to abolish
imprisonment of sailors and flogging at
sea, and Frye's amendment inserts "with
out justifiable cause," which practically
destroys the purposes of the bill. The
Arago decision makes it a punishable of
fense for sailors to leave the service of a
ship with which they have engaged, even
though the ship be in a harbor.
Metropolitan Temple was crowded. A
band played inspiriting airs between the
speeches. E. Rosenberg, secretary of tne
San Francisco Labor Council, presided.
On the stage were Mayor Phelan, H. E.
Highton, J. H. Barry, Alfred Furhman
and others.
Mr. Highton was the first speaker. He
made an eloquent appeal in behalf of the
sailor "to whom," he said, "we owe our
own country in the hrst instance and have
ever owed its preservation. I have never
been able to understand why the men wbo
follow the sea should not compose our
sturdiest and most manly citizens.
"They face nature in her wildest moods,
daring dangers continually that lands
men are seldom called upon to meet,
traveling in all lands. Why should they
not be the most intelligent, self-reliant
and trustworthy of our citizens?''
"That they, of alt others, should be
discriminated against and put on the
level of slaves w_ts infamous." he said.
"The thought that an American sailor
should ever be called upon to carry in his
mind the thought tbat at. some time or
some place ins lack was laid open by the
lash of some petty tyrant rouses my ulood
almost to the point of revolution," he said.
Speaking of the question under consid
eration he said:
"As I understand it, Robert Roberts and
three others shipped on the barkentine
Arago for Valparaiso and other points to
which the master might dispose. They
had had no allotment, as they call â no
advanced pay.
"When tney arrived at Astoria they un
dertook to leave the vessel, the conditions
on board the vessel not being satisfactory.
They took a small boat and went ashore
and were promptly arrested under the
laws of this great country and through a
Justice of the Peace, whose 'name will
probably glitter in the annals of American
jurisprudence forever, they were kept in
jail sixteen days during the stop of the
vessel in that American port.
'They were then taken on board the
vessel and expected to help sail it. I
honor those men for, under thoÃe condi
tions, refusing to work. [Applause.] Re
member, these men had received not a
dollar up to this time. The barkentine
was compelled to come into this port.
These sailors were taken ashore and
placed in the Alameda County Jail. They
have been there nine months, until re
leased under a writ of habeas corpus. The
lower court decided against them, and
within the past few days the Supreme
Court has affirmed the decision of that
court.
"Justice Harlan, in a very able opinion,
dissented. Now, we are iiyine under a
system of law, and I am not here to dis
cuss the judgment of the court. It is the
law and that is enough. - But I am here
to discuss the conditions that would make
such a judgment possible. This judg
ment is a sanction by the law of a species
of kidnaping. We are here to express our
desire that a bill which has already passed
the House at Washington, and which is
directed at the correction of this evil,
shall become a !*.w. . :7 *. ' â¢:7* â¢>
"It is now undergoing a process of
emasculation at the bands of Senator
Frye of Maine in the upper house. Sen
ator Frye represents the wishes of the
ship-owners of Maine. I think he Will
learn before long that he is getting him
self into trouble." The sneaker said that
this country had fought out the question
of slavery of the black man and had set
him free. That white men should held
in bondage in this same fair land was a
circumstance not to be longer tolerated.
The chairman read the following tele
grams from our Senators and Representa
tive Maguire at Washington:
Washington, D. c, Feb. 2, 1897.
E. Rosenberg, Secretary ,. San Francisco: A
sailor's vocation is honorable and calls" for
brave and true men. â  Justice demands for
them equal opportunities, therefore I oppose
any law which permits their imprisonment
for violation of civil agreement, as ihat allows
landsharks to obtain their advanced wages
' George <â *â¢ Pee kins. â¢
Washington, February 2. I
E. Rosenberg, etc.: Abolition of imprisonment
for violation of civil contracts and enactment
of legislation relieving seamen from unjust
discrimination constitute reforms demanded
by our civilization.' Will exert myself to pro
cure these results. Stephen. M. White.
*.;?' ' Washington*. February 2.
Edward Rosenberg, Secretary Labor Council,
San Francisco: The voice of your meeting to
night will help us abolish slavery of American
sailors. James G. Magi ike.
- The reading was roundly applauded.
Mayor Phelan was introduced and
warmly greeted. He said he was a lands
man and coula not speak as one familiar
with the ways of Iho-e who sail the sea,
but he came at the invitation of the secre
tary of the Labor Council as Mayor of the
City to give ' his official ppproval to the

meeting protesting against the amend
ments offered to House bills by Senator
Frye. -* i ' "** 'it:*.
He spoke at some length, characterizing
the treatment accorded to sailors by sanc
tion of law as infamous: that the idea
that a master of a ship . should be judge
and executioner over bis men was repug
nant to every American.
The Mayor was warmly applauded at
the close of his address. '__, â *_***'.
James H. Barry was introduced.
"If ever a man deserved a roast,", he
said, ''it is that man Frye of Maine. I
tell you chattel slavery does exist in this
land of the free and brave. It does exist,
but, by the great Jehovah, it shall be abol
ished. These four men of the Arago, for
no crime, except that they desired to
leave tbe employment where they W2re
cruelly treated, were imprisoned nine
months and until released under habeas
corpus. Tney remained at liberty until
the United States Supreme Court sent
them back to prison again.
"I know that it is treading on dangerous
--â¢round to criticize the members of that
high tribunal, but we must still remember
tbat that court is still composed of only
men [applause], and some of them pretty
bad men too. [Renewed applause.] Some
of them we know bought the high posi
tion they bold. Some of tbem were cor
poration attorneys before acquiring their
place on the bench, and it is in the interest
of those corporations tbat the Su, reme
Court has given such judgments as this."
L. Hoey, acting secretary of the Sailors'
union, in a short address soil tbe Arago
decision was on a line with the Dred Scot
decision. He described the treatment ac
corded sailors as inhuman.
Alfred Fuhrman was the last speaker.
He was a sailor and studied law at sea.
He knew the wrongs of the sailor. He
did not hesitate to speak his mind freely
about the Supreme Court that had made
what he termed one of the most out
raeeous decisions in the history of courts.
Two following resolutions were passed
with a cheer:
Whereas, The seamen of our country have
for years been engaged in a worthy effort to
improve their condition and those of the en
tire maritime trade; and whereas, the evils
sought to be remedied by the seamen are:
First, involuntary servitude; (econd, the ad
vance system; th.rd, brutality on the
part of ships* officers; fourth, for food;
fifth, small and unhealthy forecas
tles; and whereas, these evils nave been
largely relieved iv the coastwise trade by the
Maguire act of February. 1895. which the
seamen propose to have extended so as to In
clude the foreizn-going seamen in its benefits
under the provisions of House bills 2663 and
6399, which were passed by the House of
Representatives at the last session of Congress;
and whereas, the United States Senate Com
mittee on Commerce, through its chair
ma:), Senator Frye. instead of reporting
the bills as acted upon by the House of Repre
sentatives, has reported substitute-; which not
only deny the desired reforms to the foreigc
going seamen, but also repeal the most bene
ficent provisions of the Maguire act as ap
plied to the coastwise seamen; and, whereas,
Senator Frye has intimated ln the Senate that
if that body does not accept his substitute he
will bury the entire matter in the committee;
therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the citizens of San Fran
cisco, in mass-meeting â¢ assembled, declare
that the imprisonment of seamen for deser
tion (quitting work) is "involuntary servi
tude" and a violation of the thirteenth
amendment to the constitution of the United
States, and as such it is repellant to our sense
of American liberties, degrading to the sea
man and dangerous to the safety of our insti
tutions; and further
Resolved. That we condemn the .action of
Senator Frye and the Committee on Commerce
of the United States Senate, and demand that
House bills 2603 and 6399 be reported by that
committee as passed by the House of Repre
sentatives; r.nd further HHS-S * tvÂ»Â« '.jij
Resolved, Thai we commend the action of
our representatives in Congress, particularly
Senators White and Perkins and the Hon.
James U. Magnire, in their efforts to have
justice done the seamen, and that we urge
upon the Senate that it call for the House bills
in aid of the seamen and pass upon them at
the earliest possible moment; and further
Risolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
forwarded to Senator Frye, the representatives
of California in Congress, and that the press
of San Francisco be requested to publish them
ln lull.
W.T. PATTERSON MISSING
Despondent Over a Loss of Posi
tion and Physical Suf
fering.
Ha Was Until Lately an Assistant
Clerk of the Board of Super
visors
The Morgue officials were notified yester
day by Attorney George F. Gordon that
William T. Patterson, ex-assistant clerk of
the Board of Supervisors, has been missing
since Thursday last.
It is believed that he has committed
suicide through despondency.
His position as assistant clerk to the
board was lost some months ago and as a
consequence the missing man has been in
a very melancholy state of mind, owing
to straitened circumstance--.
. Coupled with this he bus suffered much
lately from sciatic rheumatism. This
affliction has been a fruitful source of an
noyance to Patterson for a long time, and
induced a lameness that made locomotion
difficult. .
- Patterson is about 60 years of age. The
only relative known is a Mrs. Barclay, a
niece, who nursed him througb a long
spell of sickness when he was lodging
with Justin Gates, a notary public living
at 207 Larkin street. Patterson has of late
been residing on Polk street.
He is well known in local official circles
as well as being a member of several fra
ternal organizations.
Friends are now eagerly inquiring as to
his whereabouts. The police have been
notified of his disappearance.
HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
Various Reports Submitted Whirl* Re
veal Interesting Facts of Various
Kinds.
Health Inspector Dockery has reoorted
to the Board of Health that twenty-four
arrests were made last month in his de
partment/and that there were five con*
victions. Market Inspector Ben Davis re
ports five arrests and four convictions,
and fines amounting to $220. A great
amount of work was done' which was
statistically enumerated. Other reports
showed that last month th-re were 202
cases of measles in the City and four
dsaths from that cauie. There were 112
interments in the City Cemetery. The
County HoÂ«pital has 944 inmate's. The
Receiving Hospital treated 469 cases.
Suit by a Conductor.
A. W. Nixon has- brought suit In the Jus
tices' court to recover $299 99 from the
Guatemala Central Railroad Company. ' Mr.
Nixon sets up that he was employed by the
corporation to go to Guatemala-as a railway
conductor at a salary of $200 per month and
with an agreement that should be desire to
return nt the end of twelve months his passage
back to fan Francisco would be furnished free.
At the end of six months or so be was dis
missed. Therefore he sues.

Rev. Dr. Ford thoroughly approves oi a

be one of the first here to introduce knick

long-faced, back-number type. He is
about to introduce the Louis XIV cos
tume into tbe churchâthat i*Â«, of coats**,
in a moderate form â the conventional
swallow-tailed coat, with black taiin or
velvet knickerbockers, black silk hose
with low pumps and silver buckles. It
will be an innovation here, but for some
time past it has been the correct thing in
tbe Fast.
In speaking of the matter yesterday.
Mr. Ford said: ''Yes, I hope to be able i
soon to siy that the young gentlemen of
our congregation have adopted the idea.
1 believe that to be thoroughly successful
one should be original. The young ladies
in our church always dress in evening ;
dress ai our socials, and the bright, pretty j
colors do make the rooms so cheery. \
You know that there i 3 a prevalent idea !
that Christians cannot dress as well as !
other people, and most geneatlly they do :
not, but in our churches we have a most
liberal congregation, which believes that j
anything mo.dorn and up-to-date is sure
to be well patronized.
'â¢Personally, I should prefer to wear
bright colors red, I think. In preaching i
the Gospel one should be bright-appearing
in dress, for it is there that one should 03
cheerful if any place, and plain black
and white is so funereal. In the East and
Europe they have been trying very bard :
to use color in gentleman's dress, and I
sincerely hope they, will succeed."
Th 3 Christian church changes its Sun- I
day evening services very often. Tue i
first Sunday last month the congregation
had a "white" servic*. Everything was
white, even the pulpit. On next Sunday \
evening the "ten vireins, five foolish and
five wise, will figure in the services.
SOMETHING QUITE NEW.
School-Children Invited :to Write tet
ters to Missouri Children.
The, school-children of San Francisco
may have a chance 10 display their ability
in a new direction. Certain pupils in the
fifth grade, to the number of four at one
time, may be invited to write letters to be
read aloud before tbe principals and chil
dren of the public schools of Springfield,
Mo. Reciprocally, four children of the
fifth grade of the public schools of the
Missouri c: ty may write letters to be read
for the edification and instruction of the
pupils of the San Fraucisco public schools.
' This is the substance of a novel proposi
tion made by tbe superintendent of the
public schools at Springfield to Superin
tendent Babcock of the public schools cf
this City.
The lettÂ»r which contained the proposi
tion was brief, but it abounded in sug
cesuveness. The idea as set forth was to
have both girls and boys write, so the
peculiarities of Missouri and of San Fran
cisco might be fully developed. An inter-
State competitive letter-writing era may
be developed, the general tendency being
to improve the epistolary style of bot.i
localities among. the children.
No subjects were suggested and no limit
of any sort placed on the length of cor
respondence by the projector of thisnew
and interesting educational enterprise.
Yesterday Superintendent Babcock said
that lie had not yet done any -hing in the
matter. He seemed to think that tbe idea
was a good one. Tbere are bright chil
dren in San Francisco who are undoubt
edly able to hold th**ir own with any part
of the country in such a matching of wits
and wisdom.
SAVING ON GAS LIGHTS.
Resolution Adopted by the Supervisors
Will Save 94500 Per Annum.
The Board of Supervisors by adopting a
resolution incorporating the recommenda
tion- made by Colonel G. L. Taylor, Gas
sad Water Inspector, expect to save about
?4!XX) â er annum. Colonel Taylor bas for
some time been studying into tbe possi
bility ot dispensing with some gas lights
which lave burned close to e'<-**tric li"hts.
He figured out that 113 gas iights could be
< dispensed with and estiroa ed that $1600
could be saved tbat way during the re
mainder of the fiscal year.
Mayor Pbelan, who" favored this move,
thinks that with the increased number of
nights each montn near the time of the
new moon, when the lamps will not be
lighted, will reach per annum a saving of
$4500. The lizhts will be dropped at once.'

FREIGHT FILLS
ALL THE FLOORS
One Hundred New Box
Cars for the Valley
Railroad.
Directors Vote to Doub'e the
Rolling Slock of the Com
peting Line.
Extension to Mcj.ve Consiiered to
Connect With the Atlantic
and Pacific.
That business is getting brisker on the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad is indicated by the action of the
board of directors, which met yesterday
afternoon. So much traffic has been taken
from the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany that a considerable audition to the
rolling stock of the company was found
necessary to handle it. The directors
yesterday decided to double the rolling
stock of the road for the handling of
freight. Â»
T.e board was in session about four
hour**, during which the entire situation
with reference to the extension from
Fresno to BakersfieK and the building of
the line from Bakerstield to Mojave, to
connect with the Santa Fe line, was under
consideration.
Vice-President Robert Watt had nothing
to say concerning the action of the board
in relation to the Santa Fe connection,
but that the board did discuss tbe matter
to considerable extent was admitted.
Tbe sale o' the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad has been postponed until about
the middle of February. In the event of
tbe absorption of the Atlantic and Pacific
by the Atchison, Tope a and Santa Fe
system, which, it is considered, will take
piace beyond the possibility of a doubt,
the toard at its next meeting will con
sider tbe matter of the construction of the
line from Bakerstield t**> Mojave. This ex
tension constructed â either by the Valley
road or the Santa Fe, or jointly â will be
the connecting link that will give Califor
nia its first competing transcontinental
railroad. ....;-. Â
At the meeting yesterday the directors
decid d to build 100 new boxcars to meet
the demands of the freight-snippers. The
company's rolling stock has, since regular
transportation was accepted, been kept
with its journals warm, and tbe directors
yesterday provided for the construction
of 100 new boxcars and ordered fifty of
tbem built at once. They will be built in
San Francisco. This means an imme
diate expenditure of aboui $50,000.
The rolling-stock capacity of the Valley
road now comprises 100 boxcars and 250
fiatcars. The fifty new cars ordered are
of the combination pattern, suitaole for
the transportation of fruit, wheat or live
stock. Including the new order, the roll
ing stock of tbe road for the 125 miles
from Stockton to Fresno comprises 200
boxcars and 250 fiatcars.
The running ot Sunday trains to Fresno
and tbe gradual increase of passenger
traffic it is considered may soon necessi
tate the ordering of additional Dassenger
coaches.

declared his motion carried.
Mr. Patton drew attention to the by

done, and they supported the uosition
taken by Mr. Patton. That put an end to

tee on proxies, after which some one
asked that these do not act, but that two

JUDGMENT FOR A
MILLION DOLLARS
Pennsylvania Lead Com
pany Unable to Meet
Its Obligations.
Critical Illness of Is President
Has a Tendency to Compli
cate Matters.
But With the Appointment' of a
Receiver Business Will Be
Resumed.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 2.â Yesterday a
judgment lor nearly $1,000,000 was con
fessed by the Pennsylvania Lead Com
.pany in favor of ex-Judge Griscom, trus
tee of the creditors. The action was fol
lowed by a bill in equity, tiled by Griscom,
askiiic for the appointment of a receiver
for the company, the directors being in
the petition. The plea in the petition
assigns Griscom and H. E. Anderson as
receivers for the company, directing them
to operate the works until further orders
of the court. They are to make a report
every month and give a bond for $100,000.
The officers of the board of directors are
J. E. Schwartz, president; George Faunca,
Vice-president; F. _d. Schwartz, secretary,
and H. E. Anderson, treasurer.
The office of the company is in Pitts
burg and the works are in Robinson Town
ship. The land and plant erected by the
company are worth $^67,000. Other assets
include the advancement of $775,000 to the
Pennsylvania Smelting Company of Utah
and a considerable sum in book accounts
and cash. The liabilities are abou $.1,000,
--000.
The answer of the defendants admitted
that its paper in the bank had gone to
.protest, and that about $450,000 would
become due for each of the next three
months, and that under existing circum
stances they would be unable to meet the '
â  obligations.
J. E. Schwartz, who Is practically the
owner of all the capital stock, and who
. has indorsed and guaranteed a large
amount of the indebtedness, is now I
stricken with paralysis and unable to
tjansact business or renew his indorse
. ments or authorize any one to do so. The
obligations are held in Utah, New York,
London and this city.
If suits are brought, it is claimed ttat
the property of the company will be sacri
ficed, and that it will be for the best in
taresls and necessary for the walfare of
the creditors that receivers be appointed,
as its assets can thus be administered so
that all-its creditors will be paid in full]
and a surplus left for stockholders.
The affidavit of H. E. Anderson, the j
treasurer of the company, says that the j
company's assets consist of sixty-eight j
acres of land in Robinson Township, on i
which is erected a fully equipped plant I
' for refining and smelting ores and bullion j
containing precious metals; that it has in j
its works and in transit ores worth
$800,000, and has contracts for purchasing
ores for which advancements have been
made. It has book accounts, cash on
hand and miscellaneous assets to the
amount of $125,000. It has advanced to
the Pennsylvania Sme'ting Company of j
Salt Lake City, Utah. $750,000. i
The liabilities amount to $1,400,000, all |
of which is commercial paper, and most of j
which will mature in sixty days. Over !
$50,003 of this paper went to protest yes- j
terday.
Willis McCook of the company stated
to day: "The movement is merely a pre- j
cautionary one. J. E. Schwartz, the head
of the company, was stricken with a
paralytic stroke on Friday evening, and
ever since that time has been in a critical I
conditionâ so critical, that the physicians !
inform us that one word of business im- j
parted to him might end bis enrthly '
career. You see, it requires about $500,000 I
a month to purchase ore and bullion for i
the smelting works, and, as these are j
bought only for spot cash, notes have to 1
be given and realized upon to keep enough i
money on hand to make these purchases. |
Several of the notes have recently fallen
due and will bave to be renewed: hence!
the application for a receiver."
Mr. McCook said the operations would |
continue and the mills not be shut dpwn. !
The bill for the receiver sets forth that !
Griscom is holder of a judgment against \
.them for $9^8.253. in favor of the creditors, j
. and that H. E. Anderson is a stockholder. i
The corporation was incorporated in 1800 j
and has a capital stock of $10,000,000, of |
which J. E. Schwartz is the owner of
â¢-. $950,000.
COMPLETING THE CABINET.
. Delegations Visit Canton in the Interest
of Friends Who Are After
Pert 'olios.
CANTON, Ohio. Feb. 2.â The Maryland
booms for Cabinet aopointments met here
to-day and Senator Wellington of that
State, who did not come nearer Canton
than Cleveland, is credited with assisting
one of them to drop quickly from view.
The withdrawal of Jud_.e Goff from the
list of Cabinet possibilities caused tbe
friends of Jame- M. Gray of Baltimore to
think that there was an opportunity for a
Maryland representative in the Cabinet,
and as he is indorsed by influential poli
. ticians in all but two of the Southern
States a strong showing was and has
again been made in his behalf.
Judge Lewis McComas, a former mem
ber of Congress from Hagerstown, now a
Judge in the District of Columbia, has
been suggested by many of his friends as
.an available man for appointment to the
Cabinet. It is understood that the Repub
lican organization in tha* State, which is
controlled by Senator Wellington, is not
friendly to him.
. The Missouri delegation which came to
Canton this afternoon to ask President
McKinley to appoint William Warner of
Kansas City to the Cabinet made a strong
argument in bis behalf.
The Missouri visitors presented indorse
ments of Major Warner from the Legisla
tures, of Indiana, Texas, Kansas and of
their own State. It wiil occasion no sur
prise if the President-elect should not
choose a New York Republican for his
official family, though it is not probable
that he will leave both New York and the
South out of it.
The final cast for tbe Cabinet has not
been made, and no one knows the precise
position that will be occupied by some of
the men who have been offered and ac
cepted Cabinet positions.
It cannot.be positively affirmed that ex-
Governor Long will he Secretary of the
Navy until the two remaining places are
filled, though it is certain that he has
been tendered and accepted a position.
ECKELS WIL I. AOT RESIGN.
Bis Term as Comptroller Does Xot Ex
pire Until April, 1808.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 2.- World
special from Washington says: James S.
Eckels, Comptroller of the Currency, has
decided to retain his office until the ex
piration in April, 1898, of the term of five
years for which he was appointed. He
denies the statement that the manage
ment of the Chicago General Trust Com
pany at a largely increased salary was
offered to him. He does net regard his
office as political, and consequently sees
no impropriety in his continued service
under a Republican regime.
The Comptoller of the Currency and the
Director of the Mint are the only officials
appointed for a specific term of rive years
each and who cannot be removed except
for stated reasons, which must be fur
nished by the President to the Senate.

Will Return to Cincinnati and Resume
' the Practice of Late.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 2.âAttor
ney-General Harmon was questioned
yesterday as to the truth of the report
that it was his intention to leave Cincin
nati and open a Jaw office in New York.
Judge Harmon said there was absolutely
no truth in tbese reports. . â¢
As soon as relieved by the incoming ad
ministration be will return to Cincinnati
and resume practice with his old asso
ciates. He said tbat he thought the rumor
had its origin in the fact, that his brother,
Eugene 11. Harmon, at present an exami
ner in the Patent Office, would open an
office in New York for the practice ol law
and would have for bis associate Mr.
Seymour, the present Commissioner of
Patents, who has already asked McKinley
to relieve him as soon as possible after
March 4.
CADET" WILL BE II ERE.
West Pointers to <nt a Figure at the
Inauguration.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 2.â A Times
special Irom West Point says: The cadets
are going to Washington to help inau
gurate McKinley. That fact is settled
beyond all question. The Senate refused
to allow expenses lor the trip in the an
nual appropriation for the military acad
emy, but as the amount asked was only
for transportation and subsistence the
Senate's refusal in no way interferes with
the Secretary of War's order.
The presence of tbe cadets will be a
most attractive feature of the inaugural
parade and their attendance at the ball
will add brilliancy to tbe occasion. All
preparations for the trip are nearly com
pleted and Uncle Sam's future generals
will dip their colors to the outgoing and
incoming Presidents on March 4.

BIG EIRE AT SALT LAKE.
Business Illock Destroyed and One Man
D<snnerâ'.*sl ii Injured.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Feb. âThe Scott-
Auerbach building, one of the largest
business blocks in the heart of the city,
burned down to-night. The damage will
aggregate at least $300,000 which is covered
by insurance.
The lower floor was occupied by J. M.
Scott & Co., wholesale hardware dealers;
Joslin & Park, jewelers, and Calloway,
Hoock & Co., glassware. The fire was
caused by the explosion of a lamp on the
top floor, used for sleeping apartments,
and made its way down the elevator shaft.
The second and third stories were occu
pied by offices, and nothing was saved.
Electrician Vail of the fire department
reset a shock from nn electric wire
and was so badly injured that he is not
expected to live. A number of people
very narrowly escaped being burned up,
and now it is feared that several failed to
get out and are dead in the ruins.

Friends of that measure find little com

its passage in either House after an ex

sel of Venezuela before the commission
and the arbitral tribunal.
Senor Andrade brought with him a
magn.ficent pen, with which the im

Government, and to whom it will be re
turned as a souvenir, lt consisted of a
gold pen. fastened in a holder made from
an eagle's quill, bearing midway to the
top a gold heart encrdsted with diamonds.
While the two plenipotentiaries were
formally exchanging their credentials the
: copies of the treaty, which were printed,
were carefully compared by Mr. Bax-
Ironside and Mr. Cradler, chief of the
diplomatic bureau of the State Depart
ment, wbo made all the drafts of the docu
ment and printed the copies.
These were in the. English language,
Spanish not being used, although the

being that in the Venezuelan copy that
country is mentioned always first and the
British vice versa.
The British Embassador signed "Julian
Pauncefote" to both copies; Senor An
drade. following, affixed his nature,
and Mr. Criddler affixed their respective
seals.
The formalities having been quickly

ces.

Eckels Thinks the Government Should
Xot 'Issue Demand Ohligtitlont.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. I.âComp
troller Eckels to-day further discussed
banking and currency matters with the
House Committee on Banking and Cur
rency. Replying to a question, Eckels
said that a banking bill which did not get
rid of demand obligations would not re
lieve the existing condition of the
treasury. . In his opinion gold could not
go to a' premium as long as banks re
deemed in gold.
Walker (chairman) here took the floor
and began explanations relative to his
bill. Eckels agreed with Walker in the
statement that under the present law the
United States had the most expensive
! currency system of any first-class nation.
"Our Government," he said, "has the
i worst financial system of any first-class
i nation la the world."
It was the result in almost every in
stance of immediate necessities. He also
agreed with the suggestion of Walker,
which makes it to the interest of banks to
furnish the Secretary of the Treasury as
advisers any information relating to
banking matters.
The bill of Walker, he said, embodied a
good many correct banking systems. Its
principal objection, as with the other
bills, was that it understood to engraft an
entirely new note system upon the pres
ent system. Further, he did not believe
in having the Government issue any more
demand obligations.

hour or so later the proprietor found that
the man had died. The Coroner was noti
fied and the body removed to the Morgue.
Dr. Morgan, the antop-y physician, made
a hasty examination and found that the
lips and mouth of tbe dead man were
seared as by a corrosive poison. A search
of the clothing brought to light evidence
that the man had committed suicide. In
his pocket were two scraps of paper, on
which was written the following:
I, William Smithers, do this deliberately. I
cannot stand to be tormented every day on
account of things 1 am not guilty of. I have
no enmity to any one on earth, To my wife,
God bless her; also my sister. May God Mesa
everybody. I wish to be buried In a pauper's
grave. William Smithers. <

Lodge Inveighs Against "Birds of
Passage " and Vilas Opposes
the Canal Bill.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 2.â ln the
Senate to-day Chandler (R.) of New
Hampshire offered a resolution declar
ing that "it is the sense of the Senate
that the United States should not
permanently acquiesce in the single
gold standard and that the efforts of
the Government in all its branches
should be steadily directed to secure
and maintain the use of silver as well as
gold as standard money, with the free
coinage of both, under a system of bimetal
lism, to be established through Interna
tional arrangement or such safeguards of
legislation as will secure the' parity in
value of the two metals at a fixed ratio,
furnish a sufficient volume of metallic
money and give immunity to the world of
trade from violent fluctuations in ex
change."
He asked that the resolution should go
over and said that he would call it up at
an early day.
The House bill to allow the bottling of
distilled spirits in bond was reported and
placed on the calendar.
A bill granting a pension of $100 a
month to Cassius ______ Clay Sr. of Ken- j
tucky, a major-general of volunteers, was
introduced by Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky
and leferred.
A resolution calling on the Secretary of
State for information as to the alleged
killing at Sagua La Grange, Cuba, of the
son of M. F. Lopez, an American citizen,
was offered by Lodge (R.) of Masfachu
sets and was agreed to.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont asked unani
mous consent to have taken from the cal
endar and passed the House bill to pro
hibit the sale of intoxicating liquors in
the Capitol building. Objection was made
by Hill (D.) of New York.
The House bill granting pensions to
Grace Battalion of Arkansas Volunteers
was passed.
The conference report on the immigra
tion bill was laid before the Senate and
Gibson (D.) of Maryland made a point of
order against it â that the Conference Com
mittee had exceeded its power by the in
jection of new matter. He argued that
the conference bill was entirely different
from the bill that had passed the House
and Senate.
Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts, in charge
oftbe conference report, replied briefly to
Gibson's speech. He asserted that there
was nothing in the conference report in
the way of subject matter which -had not
been absolutely belore the two houses.
Re erring to the Corliss amendment,
which applies to the general employment
of aliens in the United States, he said that
few people realized now great tho evil
was.
It did not come alone from the influx of
Canadian working people every summer.
He spoke of them as "birds of passage."
Compared with the "birds of "passage"
from Italy, Poland and other European
countries, the influx of the people over
the Canadian boundary is as nothing.
The number of Italians who went back to
their country after working here during
tbe spring, summer and autumn was 111,
--000. Every dollar that they had earned
they carried away with them.
Lodge spoke with great indignation of
the telegrams sent by Claussenius & Co.,
as agents of the North German Lloyds,
in opposition to the bill. "There," said
he, "is a great company, a foreign corpor
ation subsidized by a foreign Government,
calling on their agents to send threaten
ing dispatches to members of Congress
calling upon them to vote against tbis
bill.
"And now they have circulated the re
port that the President is to veto the bill.
That report comes from the same source.
This is a great and useful measure. It in
volves matters that lie at the very root of
American civilization. If this bill meets
defeat that will be taken by the country
as the victory of a corporation. I wish to
denounce it from my place in the Senate
as improper, unbecoming and dangerous.
I want to see this open, flagrant corpora
tion influence rebuked when it enters the
Capitol of the United States."
At the close of Lodge's speech the con
ference report went over without action,
Hill (D.) of New York giving notice tbat
he would discuss it to-morrow.
The consideration of the Nicaraguan
canal bill was then proceeded witb, Vilas
(D.) of Wisconsin resuming the floor to
continue bis argument against it.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts asked Vilas
whether he could give any assurance that
the opposition to the bill would. leave any
time during the present session for any
other legislation.
Vilas declined to express any opinion
on chat point.
Teller (R.) of Colorado gave notice of an
amendment requiring the survey by a
commission .of Government engineers
before issuing any bonds, and . pro
viding that ii the report of the board
choc-it show the cost to be more than
$150,000,000 no bonds should be guaran
teed and no liability assumed by the Gov
ernment.
Vilas gave notice of a substitute for the
bill. It provides for a commission of five
persons â one from the engineer corps of
the army, one, from the engineers of tbe
navy, and three others to be appointed by
the President, to be known as tne Inter
oceanic Canal Commission, to visit and
inspect the several canal routes proposed
and to have all needed surveys and in
quiries made/flo as to determine the most
feasible route.
He then continued his argument against
the bill. Without concluding it, he yielded
for a motion' to adjourn, and the" Senate
at 5:30 adjourned un il to-morrow.

HERBERT DEEEXDS HIS REPORT.
Sticks to Conclusions Regarding Prices
of Armor Plate.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. The
most interesting meeting the Senate Com
mittee on Naval Affairs bas had since it
began the investigation of armor plate
was held to-day. Secretary Herbert and
Commodore Sampson and Mr. Schwab of
the Carnegie company; Lieutenant C. A.
Stone and Richard Lineman, president of
the Bethlehem company were present.
The armor plate men insisted that the
Secretary in his report had not been ac
curate in his conclusions or in his facts.
He bad not been liberal enough by 40 per
cent in his estimate of the cost of labor
in producing armor plate. Plate could
not be made, both firms stated, for less
than the sum for which they had agreed
to make. $450 a ton.
Secretary Herbert defended his report
and insisted that his conclusions were not
only accurate but just, both to the com
panies and the Government.
A special meeting of the committee will
be held Thursday, when it is expected
that the committee will take some final
action on the subject that bas now been
under investigation for the past six
months. '
DEATH OF T. P. MADDEN
Heart Disease Carries Away
an Old Guest of the
Occidental.
The Academy ot Science and the
Pacific Union Club Will Mourn
His Loss. ..
At 10:30 o'clock yesterday death claimed
Thomas P. Madden, one of the oldest
guests of the Occidental Hotel. His face
had become so familiar to all the attaches
of that place that he was looked upon as
a permanent fixture, having been a con
tinuous resident for the past thirty-five
years of the house. Quiet, unassuming
and gentlemanly in his relations with ail
who came in contact with him he was a
general favorite with the many proprie
tors and the help of the big house.
His death was due to fatty degeneration
of the heart, his serious illness dating
back only a few days. Two weeks ago,
however, he had a slight stroke of par
alysis, which partially disabled his left
arm, but this trouble speedily disappeared.
After this slight attack he resumed his
general visits to the Pacific-Union Club
and the rooms of the Academy of Sciences,
to which latter institution he was fondly
attached.
He was a warm friend of the late Judge
Hastings, and the two at one time had
certain land inter sts in common. After
the Judge death Mr. Madden was, for a
time, trustee of the estate. He was him
self possessed of sufficient iroperty to
make him comfortably well to do, though
just what he was worth even his intimate
mends, of whom h6 had many, are un
able to state. He had no relatives in this
btale i but a host of acquaintances, byall
Â° s_\__ om he was most warmly esteemed.
__._ deceased was a bachelor and was
68 years of age last November. He was
born in Fairfax County, Va., educated
at Georgetown College and came to
California when a very young man. At
the time he held a position in the Inte
rior Department, and on first taking up
his residence in this State he made his
headquarters at Benicia. Later ,he was
transierred to this City, but after a time
his health gave way and he resigned vis
position and went to Arizona. There ho
traveled about with the United States
troops and soon fully recovered, immedi
ately thereafter returning to this State
"here be resided up to the time of his
death.
He was a life member and enthusiastic
supporter of both tne Academy of Sci
ences and Art Association ana belonged
also to tbe Pacific-Union Club.
In his last hours he expressed an urgent i
wish that his body might be cremated,
and his request will.no doubt be complied
with by his friends having charge of his
remains.
Dr. Thrasher's Version.
Dr. Marion Thrasher of 1236 Market street,
whose name was mentioned in connection ' .
with the trouble over little Effie Holstrom,
states that the true mother did not sell the
child for $10, but that when Mrs. Holstrom
took the baby four years ago she gave the '
money for the doctor's care of the mother. He _
says that he never asked Mrs. Holstrom for 6
the return of the little one to the true mother, J
but asserts that Mrs. Holstrom went to him'
and said that she had been divorced from -
Holstrom and was to marry a man who did
Dot want the child, and that she intended to
put it in an orphan asylum. The real mother
upon. learning this tried to recover her baby,
but failing to secure it by negotiations called â¢

â¢ Question of States' Rights to Be
Brought Up in a New
Phase.
Carson Continues Preparations for the
Accommodation of Visiting
Sports.
. CARSON, Nev., Feb. 2.â Rumor has it
that the United States authorities will be
asked to stop the Corbett-Fltzsimmons
glove contest. If they are it will raise the
interesting question of States' rights
- again. Nevada is the only State in the
Union where a piece of ground twenty
â¢ four feet square could be had for a fight
to a finish, and the right to that distinc
tion may, it seems, be questioned by the
â -.United Slates authorities.
: United States District Attorney Charles
A. LIVINGSTON of Carton, the Author of the Nevada Prize-
Fight Bill.
A. Jones said to-day tbat as yet he hrd |
â¢heard nothing of Federal interference, but !
'if. the United States law was to be vio- i
lated, or if a violation was in contempla- j
tion, he would do ail in bis power to ud- j
â¢ hold to law. While he admitted that be |
.'was fond of such sport and would like to |
â¢see the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight pulled '.
off in this State, he said he would be ;
found on the Government side if any con- j
flict should arise between the Federal j
'authorities 'and the commonwealth of
Nevada;
'- A bill has been introduced in the Senate !
â  providing that the admission to tbe big
'fight be limited to $10. If passed it wili
â¢probably be vetoed, as such an act would
bring an undesirable class to the ringside,
and the moneyed sports, who are wanted
.'most as visitors to the State, might stay j
7, a way.
. The Ormsby House, the largest hotel in
Carson, received an order to-day from
London for ten rooms. There's no longer
. -any doubt that Carbon will be selected as
â  the place for the fight, but the exact loca
: tion of the pavilion will not be announced
; until Stuart reaches here this week. All
' the vacant buildings in the city have been
leased and every enerey will be bent to
ward providing accommodations for the
crowd. Telegraphic orders for accommo
. dations continue to come in, and one en
terprising citizen has leased the Carson
â¢'Opera-house and will fill it with cots
whereon tbe sports can sleep. -Several
'large barns near the city have also been
,' leased, and will catch the overflow o!
.guests after the hotels and lodging
houses are filled. If necessary new struc
tures will be erected, as the people of Car
".. son do not propose to have it said that
they could not house the big crowd next
* month.

.graphed to Shaw's Hot Springs for accom

JUST TO BOOM XEVADA.
''Author of the' Fight Bill Tells Why It
Was Introduced, . > ; v ;
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 2.â The man who
first conceived the idea of having pugilism
regulated by law in Nevada is A. Liv
*_"ih*:ston fc president of the Agricultural
Society and a leading promoter of the
Alpine Land and Water Company. He
. was interviewed by a Call correspondent
to-day and gave his reasons for his action.
"I have lived for twenty-six years in
Nevada and have made and lost several
â¢ fortunes here, mostly in mining. I have
spent a great deal .in the last few years
getting mines into shape to sell, but no
one comes to even look at them.
. ''These same properties in California
â¢ â fronld not be long on the market, but, be
ing in Nerada, no one will care to look: at
them if they are anywhere off the Com
â¢*itock- We have spent thousands adver
tising Nevada, but still investors do not
come. â --â  â¢..:'â¢;â  "â¢ .'-:-â¢''
"I concluded to study up some scheme
to bring moneyed men here and so I fixed
on this. It will bring many thousands of
people to Nevada, and alter they once see
what sort of natural resources we have
they will begin to invest.
"After a few investments turn out well
we need have no fear for the future. Once
the tide of investment, comes lhis wav
Nevada will be the greatest State in the
West.
"We exhibited thirty - seven natural
products at the World's Fair at Chicago
and cot thirty - seven first premiums.
What does this show? It shows that we
have the greatest soil and climate on earth.
"I don't know what town will get this
come t, but if it is in Nevada I will be satis
fied. The men who arrive will be moneyed

STUART LEAVES POR AD A.
Expects to Bave Peter Maher, Dixon and
Erne in the Ring.
DALLAS, Tex., Feb. 2.â Dan A. Stuart
departed for Nevada at 10 o'clock to-night.
He said : "Everything seems to be going
on all right for the Corbett-Fiizsimmons
match. I expect the principals to be on
tbeir training-grounds within the next
ten days. The seat of information for the
public will in a few days be transferred to
Nevada.
"There are minor details to arrange of
which I cannot speak definitely until I
reach the scene of acti.in. I received
a telegram to-night from Mr. Whee
lock at San Francisco, saying the Southern
Pacific had agreed to join connecting lines
in pnttine on a low rate, good for thirty
days. The exact figures . will be an
nounced in a few days. The rate will
probably go into effect about March L
"I have a man in the East and another
in the West working on a match in which
I expect Peter Maher to appear as one of
the principals. I believe the match will
be made.
. "If it should not be, however, I shall
probably make an offer for a finish contest
between Dixon and Erne. These men
would make an interesting battle for the
public, and are both in prime condition."
XO CAUSE FOR IXTERFEREXCE.
United States Judge McKenna Says Xe
rada Can Do as It Pleases.
The sporting -fraternity of this City was
| startled and alarmed yesterday by the
i publication of a dispatch from Reno, Nev.,
| that the Federal authorities might inter
fere to stop the proposed battle between
j Bob Fitzsimmons and Jim Corbett, but
j their fears of losing a championship and
international battle were allayed after
several well-known attorneys had been
; consulted on the subject.
â¢ All declared that they knew of no
United States law under which the Na
j tional authorities could interfere, and tbat
| if tbe battle was to be stopped it must be
I through the interference of the State
i authorities. Assistant United States Dis
trict Attorney Samuel Knight said last
j evening that he couid not conceive of any
j reason why the Federal authorities should
| have any concern with the matter.
"I know of no United States statute
| that refers to prize-fighting," he said,
"and I have studied them pretty care
fully since I went into the United States
District Attorney's office.
"It appears to me to be the concern of
the State entirely whether or not such
events are permitted to occur. If the
State sees fit to put the stamp of its ap
proval on prize-fighting I see no excuse
for the National authorities interfering:
"The only possible chance would be in
case of a riot, which troops would have to
be called out to suppress."
United States Circuit Judge McKenna
was of a like opinion when seen last
evening.
"As far as 1 know, he said, "there is no
United States statute against glove fight
ing, though, of course, I am les* familiar
with the criminal statutes than those re
lating to civil matters. My opinion is
that the State of Nevada if it wills to
allow a prize fight can do so legally and
that the Federal authorities can find no
legal reason for interfering.
"States have certain vested right with
which the Government cannot interfere.
In case of a Territory the matter might be
different, but as that matter stands I see
no occasion for Federal interference."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1897.
TAKES TWO LIVES
IN DRUNKEN FURY
Charles Dodge and Alex
ander Borland Slain at
New Hope.
Tried to Eject an Intoxicated
Man From the. Barroom
of a Hotel.
The Murderer, Barricaded in His
Room, Defis Polio and En*
rrge- C.tiz n*>.
STOCKTON, Cai , Feb. 2. â Because
they assisted in an attempt to eject a
drunken man from a hotel at New Hope
this evening, Charles Dodge and Alexan
der Borland, two prominent citizens of
tbe northern part of this connty, lie cold
in death.
Their murderer, Charles F. Kleupfer,
barricaded in his room, is defying the offi
cers of the law and the angry crowd that
is clamoring for his life. He is well
armed, and in his drunken fury warns
those who would arrest him to keep
away.
Sheriff Cunningham is hastening from
this city to aid in capturing the murderer,
whose escape is prevented by â  a
strong guard around his quarters.
Should he make a dash for liberty
and be captured, it is feared that the rage
of the murdered men's neighbors will
overcome all restraint, and that Kleupfer
will be given short shrift before paying
the penalty for his crime.
Dodge and Borland were in the hotel
kept by Arthur Thornton, one of the di
rectors of the Stockton Insane Asylum,
when Kleupfer entered, shorty after 7
o'clock.
He had evidently been drinking, and
immediately began to raise a disturoance.
His conduct became so objectionable that
those present remonstrated, but this only
made the man worse and be became very
boisterous. Jjjj-f-Hj
Dodge and Borland endeavored to in
duce him to leave the place, but he would
not go. They then assisted in an attempt
to eject him, but Keupfer showed fight
and drawing his pistol fired two shots,
both of which took effect.
One bullet struck Dodge in the head and
the other pierced Borland's skull, both
penetrating the brains of Kleupfer's vic
tims. Neither man spoke after the bul
lets struck them, expiring within a few
moments.
The murderer then ran across the street
and locked himself in his room. Consta
ble McCulloch followed and endeavored to
force an entrance, but Kleupfer told him
to keep away.
"You are under arrest," said the Con
-1 stable. â 
'â¢You will never take me alive," was the
reply from the barricaded door, > "Some
of you will go with me first."
McCulloch telephoned the news to Sher
iff Cunningham, who at once started for
, the scene of the shooting with Deputy
Wall. The drive is at least thirty miles
over a muddy road, so they will not reach
tbere until a late hour. --''7
In the meantime the room in which the
murderer is barricaded is being guarded
by the constable and citizens, and Kleup
fer cannot well escape with his life.
The town of New Hope and the country
about is wild with excitement. Dodge
and Borland have lived in this county ior
many years. Tbe former was 62 years of
age and the latter 66.
The one was a member of the last Grand
Jury and the other of the last trial jury
here. Borland was a prominent rancher.
Neither leaves a family.
The man who killed them was also
well along in years, being 56 ac
cording to tbe last great register.
He has conducted a store and saloon
at New Hope lor several years, and this is
the first time he has ever been in trouble
in this county. There were few men more
respected in this locality than his vic
tims, and tbeir deaths will be mourned by
man}'.

BETTIXG AT ST. LOUIS.
Corbett Ia the Favorite, but Fitz Has a
Feus Backers.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 2.â Betting on the
Corbett-Fitzsimmons light has com
menced in fit. Louis, and as is the case in
nearly every other city in the country,
Corbett rules as favorite. The champion
is not so pronounced a favorite on this oc
casion, however, as he was prior to the
Texas and Arkansas fiasco.
Dora Silver of 969 Pine street is the first
bookmaker to place an order on the fight.
Silver to-day opened up Corbett at 6 to 5
and Fitzsimmons at 6 to 5. Tbis is a
round book, there being no percentage in
favor of the bookmaker either way.
The prices are practically the same as
were posted against the fighters in New
York and Boston. The money taken in
yesterday was principally on Corbett,
although a few small wagers were made
on Fitzsimmons. â¢:-.....

CLUTCHED BY THE UW
ROUND HALF THE GLOBE
I Continued from First Page.\
charge, who bad been informed, decided
to wait till morning before disturbing the
remains. Two policemen were set to
watch the grave all night, and they had
great difficulty in keeping off a pack of
bowling does "that gathered round.
On Friday morning the body was taken
from the grave, and as this was done it
was soon seen how the murder was com
mitted. The young man had evidently
been digging to search for gold under his
mate's direction. Then a shot was sent
through the back of the bead, having been
fired from a slight elevation and down
ward. Death must have been instan
taneous. Having silenced his victim for
ever the murderer passed a towel round
the body and cast it into the too short and
narrow grave the youth had dug for him
self. The effluvium from tbe corpse was
unbearable, and fires had to belightei
round the spot to keep away the myriads
of clustering flies. .. *>>:
The body, greatly decomposed, was
drawn up and misshapen. It was evident
that the murderer had jumped upon the
body to get it into the grave.
Having been placed in a coffin the re
mains were conveyed to Penrith and the
inquest opened.
The identification was complete despite
tbe decomposition, and the clothes,
papers and even false teeth proved con
clusively that the body was Preston's.
The search for Weller was a longer one.
Near the original camping-ground is a
lagoon. This was dragged as far as the
sunken Ings in it would permit by water
police from Sydney. Shafts sunk for
ventilation purpose* along a channel
wbich carries water from the lagoon to
Glenbrook railway station for railway use
were searched and the whole country for
miles round was prospected for the ghastly
find the searchers were confident of
making. /:.-
The idea of prospecting for gold in this
locality is, by â¢ tbe way, absurd, for the
veriest novice in the knowledge of geo
logical formation would not entertain an
idea of an auriferous find in such "coun-
try." -
. â  The search for Weller was continued
unceasingly each day for twelve days, but
not until last Sunday, December 6, was
the awful discovery made. Then a resi
dent named Woods, who bad perhaps
been fired by the Government reward, was
going through his own paddock when
he came upon a trail leading to a spot on
Glenbrook Creek known 'as the "sand
hole." There were signs of the earth hav
ing been recently disturbed. Probing
with a stick he noticed a terrible smell.
The police were called and digging com
menced, and at a depth of a foot and
a half was found Welter's body. It had
been buried in exactly the same fashion
as Preston's, and it was apparent that
death was caned by similar means in
both cases. At both inquests verdicts of
willful murder against Harwood or Butler
were returned. (
Weller was an Englishman, and his son
and daughter are: at school or college in
England. A small gold locket with
a photo of a girl in cap and town were
found.: He received remittances from
England. He was about 40 years of age,
short, stout build, dark curly hair and
beard and of a prepossessing appearance.
The Government offered a reward of Â£100
for the recovery of his body, and an addi
tional Â£75 for the conviction of the mur
derer.' â¢'.'.'
Now, as to Butler, whose* disappearance
was . most sensational. He is about
40 years of age. 5 feat 9 or 10 inches high,
stout build, muscular appearance, dark
hair, slightly tinged with gray, and small
side whiskers./ His nose is peculiar, fiat
on the bridge, large on the point and
turned to the left side as if it had been
broken. He is an Englishman, and speaks

with a burr somewhat like the Shropshire
style.
It has been ascertained that in August
he arrived in Sydney from West Aus
tralia, and this explains bis adoption of
the name of Frank Harwood. At Cool
gardie .there is now a mining expert of
tbat name. Some time ago a bag of Har
wood's was stolen. It, contained some
clothes and papers, among the latter being
a certificate from Baliarat (Victoria)
School of Mines, a miner's right and a
letter from Mr. Schlapp, manager of the
Broken Hill Proprietary Silver Mine. All
of these Butler showed as his own.
Weller, in addition to a good deal of jew
elry and some money, how much is not
known, had a master mariner's certificate
and a license to s ip, isssued by the Syd
ney Shipping Office on September 24 last.
Even after Weller's disappearance the ad
vertisements for prospecting mates con
tinued to appear.
Butler's next known movement was to
Newcastle. He appeared thereon Novem
ber 15 and went' to the Sailors' Home,
where he was known as Lee Wilier. For
eight days be remained tnere, and said be
had been engaged in Sydney toco to New
castle to join the bark Hawaiian Isles,
bound for Sin Francisco, as mate.- In the
meantime tbe captain of the bark got an
old chief officer of his to go as mate.
Butler spoke more of mining experiences
than of seafaring and he appeared to shun
the latter subject, but he said he bad been
marine superintendent for the Adelaide
Steamship Company. He produced a
master's certificate issued in England and
a license to ship, both in the name of Lee
Weller, and under that name he signed
articles and sailed as a seaman on the
sailing ship Swanhilda, bound for San
Francisco with coal. 7 ."'"'*
The vessel left Newcastle November 23,
two days before the real Weller's pocket
book was found at Glenbrook. That he
sailed is certain, as the pilot and a reporter
saw him on board when the ship was some
miles out. Butler had also said that be
was as a lad on the English training-ship
Worcester. He showed at the Newcastle
Sailors' Home a quantity of jewelry, in
cluding two watches, bracelets, rings and
brooches, and it is significant that the
genuine Captain Waller had similar jew
elry. Butler was very solicitous concern
ing a Gladstone bag, bearing the name of
Lee Weller, which he had with him, and
when, as he was going aboard the ship, the
bag was dropped in the water he was very
anxious until it was recovered. At the
Sailors' Home be showed two revolvers
and some cartridges, and a servant-girl in
making his bed one morning found a
loaded revolver under his pillow. â¢
Butler appears to have journeyed
with mates on "prospecting tours" to
many parts of this colony. He has been
traced to Grafton, in the far north; to
Maniidra, near Orange, in the west, and
to Braidwood, Albury, and into Victoria,
in the south. â  "* â 'â 'â *' .-*'
A well-to-do resident of Germantown
named Lesah, who is known to have gone
"prospecting" with Butler, and who pur
chased a wagon and two horses for the
trip, is also missing. This occurred in the
middle of September.
Further information gathered concern
ing the man, whatever his real name may
be he has been known at different times
as Butler, Harwood, Ashe, Burgess, Clare,
Simpson and Weller â appears â to stamp
him as a criminal of the most atrocious
order, and as is usual in such cases many
crimes are alleged against him which can
not at present be proved. A considerable
number of people have come forward to
testify that they were at various times in
negotiation with Butler to go "prospect
ing" and these negotiations date back in
one instance to- 1887, when all arrange
ments for a trip were made with a retired
business man at Buili. a colliery town on
the south coast, but the negotiations were
not carri d through. Lesah, who has al
ready been mentioned, hau, it is said,
Â£400.' ' '
A well-to-do young man named Camp
bell, who went with Butler to Mudgee, in
the west, is missing also, and Butler was
also traced to Parke**, likewise in the west,
where another young man disappeared
after being in Butler's company. Butler
at that time sold a wagon and two horses'
to a selector for Â£15.' â¢ â¢ '" T

I been in New Zealand, where he went pros-
I pecting with companions, but only with
| one at, a time. About the time corre
sponding with Butler's stay in New Zea-
I land several brutal and mysterious mur
j ders of young prospectors were reported
to the police, but were never cleared up.
Some months ago the decomposed and
! -mutilated remains Of a young Sydney
| man, the son of a prominent civil servant,
were found near an old shepherd's hut, in
one of the gold districts in New Zealand.
After the affair in 1887 Butler seems to
have been away from this colony until
1893, but he was here in that year accord
ing to the statement of a sailor at New
castle. This man, in 1803, left Glasgow,
Scotland, on the bark Olive ban on a
round trip. At Rio de Janeiro Butler,
then known as Richard Ashe, joined the
ship as a seaman. He was of a surly and
bad-tempered disposition, and was "dead
nuts" on the officers. The man who gave
this information seems to bave been the
only one on board Butler chummed up
! with. Butler told htm be bad been for
i some time in the back country in Brazil,
i with which he appeared to bave a very
intimate acquaintance. '.."â¢.;â¢-.
No serious trouble occurred on board
the Olivebank until she. arrived at New
castle, when Butler (Ashe) threatened to
take the captain's life. The police were
| sent for and afterward, in default of find
: ing sureties to be of good behavior for
. twelvemonths, Butler went to jail for a
month. -.* **; :* *
The informant of these particulars met
Butler in Newcastle in November last, be
fore he sailed in the Swanhilda. The
Olivebank happened to be in Newcastle at
the same time and Captain Petrie of that
vessel warned Captain Fraser of the Swan
hilda to have nothing to do with Butler,
"as be was a dangerous man." Butler
remarked to his chum that it was funny be
should meet "old Petrie'' again, adding:

low with me in West Australia we
would both have done well and come
back loaded." When pressed for informa
tion as to how he became possessed of so
much money Butler produced two car
tridges from his top waistcoat pocket and
said with a smile. "This is how I got my
living,'' and significantly added that if
thoy bad any stuff on them it was only a
matter of "pinking" them. The informant
then laughingly replied : "Ah, Dick, you're
as bad as ever. That sort of thing wouldn't
suit my book."
The plot has been further complicated
by a statement by a Sydney registry-office
keeper that early last August he intro
duced Butler to a man named Frank P.
Harwood and the two men went prospect
ing to Cobar, N. S. W. Butler's mate on
this occasion was never seen again. In
his negotiations concerning the prospect
ing tours Butler always objected to more
than one man accompanying him, saying
that the "good things" he knew in con
nection with gold mines were "too good
to let other people into them." He was
also averse to taking married men with
him on the trips, presumably because men
with wives would be more likely to be
speedily missed than young, single men.

Narrow Escapes From

Near Wenatchee.
Crowded Emigrant Coaches Roll

Embankment.

Women and Children Emerge UnÂ«
- scathed, and Bat One Man Ii
â¢-*.'* Badly Injured.
':Â§-'"
. "SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 2.â Though no
â loss of life attended the wrecking of the
Great Northern overland train near We
natchee Sunday night, several scores of
-passengers are wondering how they sue
- ceeded in coming off unscathed and are
congratulating themselves and one an
other because it was so. This was one of
.the most rem art-able in the history of rail
way disasters.
7 Several coaches rolled down a high em
bankment, and one in which were a num
ber of women and little children caught
.'fire, yet but one man was injured. The
passengers suffered much hardship, being
'compelled to travel barefooted and half
.clothed through the snow in leaving the
derailed ears, but they are quite satisfied
.'because it was no worse.
The overland was wrecked just this side
of Wenatchee by the spreading of the
rails. The entire train was wrecked, some
of the coaches rolling over an embank
ment ten twelve feet high and landing
on their side. All of the coaches were well
filled with passengers.
. The train after leaving the track
.plunged ahead fifty or sixty feet before it
went over the embankment. There was
oh the ground at the time from eight to
.ten inches of snow, and to this is ascribed
the absence of any serious results.
The tourist coach, which is provided
with a range at one end and a heater at
the other, caught fire almost immediately,
but the prompt work of the porter of tbe
car and others in cutting away the wood
work and pouring water upon the flames
saved the car from destruction. Thirty
two people, ten of them little babies and
â  tots from' two to five and six years of age,
were confined .in the tourist coach with
the grown people.
This coach contained a special crowd of
people composed of five families from
Duquesne, Pa., bound for Port Angeles,
where they will probably work in the new
steel works to be built there, as all the
men are steel workers from Pennsylvania
plants. -
_ When the accident occurred all had re
â¢ tired. As soon as the train went over all
lights in the coach were extinguished by
the jar.
The coach was found to be lying on one
side. The porter knocked out part of the
roof and next assailed the windows on the
side lying In the snow. There was great
confusion and none of the passengers
. thought of dressing. When the opening
was made they crawled out as rapidly as
possibleâ coatless, hatless, dressless and
shoeless into the snow.
The engine, tender and baggage car
were derailed, but stood upright, and j
when the wrecking train arrived it did
not take a great while to get them out of
the way. The smoker and day coach,
tourist car and dining car received the
full effect of the spreading of the rails and
toppled off the grade.
Some of the rear coaches, being only
partially turned over, were utilized by
passengers rescued from the overland
â¢coaches for protection fiom the weather,
but the women and children had to undei
gd the hardship of walking back bare
footed in the snow, a distance nearly the
. length of the train, to reach cover. .
. Tbe wreck occurred at a place removed
-from settlement, and some of the pas
sengers say that no one came to tbem
after the accident save a couple of In
dians, who stood about stupidly staring at
the wreck. Word was sent by the train
men for assistance, and yesterday morn
ing; about 6 o'clock the company physician
arrived at the scene from Leavenworth.
. The wrecking train also arrived early
from Leavenworth and began opening the
road so the trains could pass. After the
derailed engine and baggage-car were put
into shape to draw away they were re
moved and a false track built around the
portion of main track torn up.
No relief train was sent out, and it was
hot until L- p. v. yesterday that the passen
gers got away, being taken by the east
bound train from Seattle and returned to
Leavenworth. They reached this city late
this evening. â¢
Passengers arriving in Seattle to-day at
noon on the next overland say that their
train came to a halt at the scene of the
wreck. While the company is fast clear
ing ft aw.ay some of the coaches were still
In the position in which they fell and pre
sented a remarkable sight, lying with
trucks in the air.
But one man on the entire train was in
jured so badly as to need medical atten
tion. He wa* th** fireman, who bad a rib
or two fractured and probably a fracture
of one of his arms. The coaches other
than tbe tourist-car were not so crowded
with passengers, and suffered much less
in the shake-up.
ROSEBVRO'S TWO SUSPECTS.
Numerous Crimes Charged Against John
Case and James Pool.
'. ROSEBURG, Or., Feb. 2.â The recent
"hold-up" of a Southern Pacific train near
here brings to light the fact that John
Case and James Pool, convicted a year
ago of a Cow Creek Canyon train robbery
on July 1, 1395, end subsequently granted
a new trial and released on their own re
cognizance by the State Circuit Court at
Portland, have again been indicted for
some offense, this time by a Grand Jury
of Douglas County. The indictment in
no way conflicts with the former, as that
was for robbing the mails. These two
men are suspected oi complicity in Tours
day's "hold-up." They have not yet been
arrested on recent indictment. " 'â â ''-â

DICK, THB FIRE CAT.
Death of an Animal Thai Was Present
at Many Conflagrations.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. Dick, a large
cat that has been the pet of .the firemen
of Torrent Engine Company for the past
eleven years, is dead. . He possessed more
intelligence than most animals and at
tended all the fires. It was Dick's custom
to sleep upon the driver's seat on the en
gine, and when an alarm was sounded he
would nestle beside the driver and ride to
the fire. In the past eight years he had
missed but few alarms. ' -.', '*Â "7 .

having resulted from poison. The firemen
interred Dick in the rear of the engine
house and erected a tombstone to his
memory.

The objections urged are that the present
Judges cun transact all the judicial hnsi

ment of an additional Judge would create
an additional expense of several thousand
dollars per year to the taxpayers of the
county. A systematic canvass was in
augurated throughout the county to-day.
A good many signatures are being ob

who made the arrest, and a picture of the
suspect is now on the way and should ar
rive here Thursday.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 2. â Ex-
Queen Liliuokalani has succumbed to the
prevalent malady, and is now confined to
her rooms at the Shoreham with a severe
cold. Accordingly her projected visit to
the law-makers at the Capitol to-day was
postponed until some more propitious oc

the ex-Queen's secretary, in this proposed
visit.
For a native of a semi-tropical climate,
sbe has withstood the extremes of tne
northern temperature remarkably well
until yesterday afternoon when the sy lu

peared. Her attendants were very much
alaimed, and b*sought their mistress to
consult a physician, but she insists that
she will recover without medical aid in a
day or two. ana refused to allow the doc
tor to be called. There is uothlng what
ever alarming in Liltuokalani's condition,
but. she will keep strictly to her room
until she entirely recovers.* If the weather
is favorable, this will probably be in the
course of a lew days, but until then all
engagements are canceled or postponed.'

THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1897.
TRIPLE TRAGEDY
NEAR TACOMA
John Lindstrom and Two
Sons Found Dead
in Bed.
The Father Believed to Have
Slain His Boys and Then
Himself.
Friends of the Old Man Suspect That
His Enemies Committed the
Crime.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 2.â A horrible
tragedy was enacted on Sunday night on
Anderson Island, twelve miles west of
this city.
John L'ndstrora, the postmaster at
Vega, killed his two boys, Conrad and
Philip, aged 8 and 10 years respectively,
and then fired a bullet into bis own brain,
dying instantly. '^ss^
These are the facts as nearly as they can
he learned until Coroner Hoska completes
his investigation. As Lindstrom had
lately been .involved in lawsuits with
neighbors, some of his friends believe be
might have been murdered, and they
have asked the Coroner to examine into
the case very carefully.
Lindstrom and his wife owned 200 acres
of land at Vega and IGO acres several
miles back on the island. On Sunday he
went to this latter farm to see if his stock
was all right. He was accompanied by his
boys.
As usual they spent the night in tbe
house there. On Monday noon tbey had
not returned, and Mrs. Lind:. trom, becom
ing anxious, sent her daughters over to in
vestigate.
They were horrified at finding their
brothers dead in bed, bullets having been
fired into their heads while they slept.
Across the other bed was tbe body of
their stepfather weltering in his blood.
On the floor lay a revolver.
Whether Lindstrom was the author or
victim of an awful crime remains to be
determined.
If the former, his friends say he must
have been insane. Ten years aeo Lind
strom was worth $15,000 in cash and real
estate, but by bad loans and his going an
surety on others' notes he lost much
money.
In 1888 he married a widow owning the
ranch on which he died. She had five
daughters, two of whom have since mar
tied. The boys were his only children.
BRIBERY CHARGE

The Senator Accused of
Having Offered Pay
for Votes.
Assemblyman Warfler's Start
ling Statement to a Salem
Assemblyman.
Spurned the Incumbent's Advances,
but They Were Made a
' â  ' S?cond Time.
OLYMPIA. Wash., Feb. 2.â Before tbe
House Investigating Committee to-day
Warner testified that he was approached
by Senator Squire, who offered $13,000â
$ICOO for entertainment, $5000 for con
tingencies and $7000 to buy Populist votes.
A club of twenty members several days
ago agreed to break the deadlock. War- i
ncr testified that Squire, hearing of this,
sent for bim and made this offer for votes.
Warner refused to consider it. Squire sent
for him again and repeated the offer.
Again he spurned it.
The evidence so far tends to show that
Squire was the person who attempted the
bribery, while Turner's campaign was
clean. Other witnesses will be examined
to-morrow. Many subpenaes have been
Bent out, and a big sensation is promised.
TEST VOTE AT SALEM.
Senator Mitchell Must Win at Least Six
More Adherents to Be Re
. turned.
SALEM, Ob., Feb. 2.â The Davis House
met tbia morning and adjourned, as usual,
| without attempting to transact business.
Half an hour later the Benson House was
called to order, thirty members being
present. The roll was called and the min
utes read, after -which a motion to ballot
for United States Senator was carried.
Tbe vote resulted as follows: Mitchell 29,
G. H. Williams 1. The House then ad
journed.
In tbe Senate tbis morning President
Simon declared a motion .to proceed with
a ballot for United States. Senator out of
order, and was sustained by a vote of 1.6 to
12. This is regarded as a test vote and a
victory for the anti-Mitchell faction. Con
ceding these twelve votes to Mitchell in
the joint session which his followers bave
called for to-morrow, he will still lack five
votes of the number necessary to elect.
Unless Mitchell succeeds in. winning at
least six new adherents, his case is hope
less. To-morrow will probably see tbe
termination of the deadlock.
SALT LAKE, Utah., Feb. To-day's
three ballots in the State Legislature for
United States Senator developed no
material change. They were substan
tially alike, each giving Thatcher, Demo
crat. 26; Rawiin-*, Democrat, 20; Hender
son, Democrat, 14; Crttcblow, Republican,
3. The Rawlins people were anxious
to goon balloting, but a motion to dissolve
tbo joint session was carried by the united
votes of the Thatcher and Henderson
people. Fifty-two ballots have now been
taken, and there is nothing to indicate
that the deadlock is any nearer a termina
tion than it was after tho first ballot was
taken. Ââ '.
Anderson Robbers Arrested.
ANDERSON. Cal., Feb. 2. âJ. B.
Stevenson and a boy tramp were to-day
arrested by Constable Pleisch, lor rob
bing Mm Look, a Chinese doctor of this
place, out of a rifle and several dollars
last night. They were permitted to enter
â¢his piace on the plea that they : wanted
medicine. The doctor toon guessed their
object and seizing a rifle tried to drive
them away. One grabbed him by the
throat and choked him while tbe other
went through his pockets. The crime
was witnessed through a window by two
boys who had called to solicit some china
candy from the doctor.
WRECK NEAR FRESNO.
Passenger Train Runs Into a Washout
und Is Ditched Miraculous Es
cape cf the Passengers.
FRESNO. Cal., Feb. 2.â Passenger train
No. 40. which leaves Fresno daily at 5:40
A. m., ran into a washout two miles this
side of Borden, about 6 o'clock this morn
in:'. and was ditched.
The train consisted of an engine, bag
gage and mail car, smoker and two
coaches. The engine passed in safety,
but the baggage car and the smoker were
overturned, falling to the right side of the
track, while both the coaches were par
tially derailed.
There were about twenty-five passen
gers on the train, but not one was seri
ously injured. Six or seven received
bruises or sprains, while the remainder
escaped with a severe jolting.
The railroad men in this city, when
they heard of the particulars of the acci
dent, looked upon the escape of the pas
sengers as little short of a miracle. Such
luck, they said, might be expected in one
out of a thousand wrecks.
The speed of the train, which was going
at the rate of forty-five miles an hour, un
doubtedly prevented an awful catastrophe.
Had it been running more slowly, in
which case the engine might have" been
disabled, the cars would have telescoped
ana several lives have been lost.
The train was ditched near a culvert.
Engineer John Taylor says that when he
arrived at the culvert he felt the engine
give, as if the track were bending beneath
its weight.
Then the cars gave a lurch and jumped,
breaking loose. The engine kept the
tracK and Engineer Taylor hurried on to
Madera to get assistance. The coal in the
tender was stacked by the shock.
Tbe track gave way on the east side and
all the cars passed over it before being
ditched. The baggage- car and the smoker
fell flat on their sides in about three feet
of water after the engine broke loose and
were quite badly damaged.
When Express Messenger Simpson felt
the car going over he seized the hand-hold
oyer the door. The door flew open and
Simpson was providentially thrown out
some distance in the water, escaping with
a good shaking up and a few bruises.
Had he remained in the car he might
have been seriously injured. The smoker
was the worst damaged of the cars, ex
cepting the baggage.
It turned over on its side in about three
feet of water. There were five passengers
in this carâ three Chinese and two whites.
All escaped with a few bruises.
The rear of the passenger-coach next to
the smoker was twisted from the track
and the steps were broken off all round,
the end of the car lying flat on the
ground.
The last coach was badly wrecked, the
forewheels coming off and moving back
about six feet, letting the front of the car
fall almost to tbe ground on the track.
The damaged cars were put Dack on their
trucks in a few hours and the train then
proceeded.

Varicocele
Twisted, swollen, painful, weakening in its effects upon the
vital powers, the direct cause of thousands of cases of general
nervous exhaustion, debility and decay. This is Varicocele in
the veins of the vital parts. It is perhaps the most dangerous of
the many results. of early indiscretions. It drains the vital pow.
ers in that slow, treacherous manner which leaves no sign of its
terrible effect until the awful work is done until the whole
nerve force, the foundation of mental, physical and vital strength,
is undermined and manhood destroyed. Doctors have tried
every known means in their attempts to cure it, and have usually
given it up with the advice that it will not be a serious matter.
But this is only their way of excusing themselves for their help,
lessness. It is a serious matter, as is proven by the thousands of
physical wrecks it has caused. But it can be cured by
DR. SANDEWS ELECTRIC BELT.

* The Philadelphia left Callao on Jannary
17, Und the first day out passed the British
cruiser Comus, bound from Callao for
Acapulco.- The Comus is expected to be
here in time to take part in the carnival.
On Sunday morning, the 24tb,' the Phila
delphia arrived at Acapulco, where it
found the United States steamsnip Ma
rion, which - had arrived the evening
before.
Two hours - after tbe flagship had
dropped anchor the battle-ship Oregon
steamed slowly into port with flags and
pennants flying and its brilliantly bur
nished armament glistening in the morn
ing sun. The sudden appearance of so
many American warships caused consid
erable alarm among the inhabitants of
the sleepy Mexican city until it was ex
plained to them that Uncle Sam was still
friendly and that the vessels had simply
arrived within a few hours of each other
by chance. Three days later tha Phila
delphia sailed for this port and the Oregon
and Marion were expected to leave on the
29th. and 30th, which would make them
due here about Saturday. Then there
will be a fleet of eight war vessels in port,
carrying 2410 sailors and officers â far
the largest fleet ever gathered in a Pacific
American harbor outside of San Francisco.
The Petrel and Adams are also expected,
with one or two more British cruisers.
The presence of the admiral and tbe
large fleet in San Diego harbor insures the
success of the coming carnival, and it
promises to be one of tbe greatest naval
and military demonstrations ever seen on
the Pacific. The military programme for
tbe week includes daily drills on the
streets by sailors and marines and an ex
tended order drill and sham battle on
North Island, to be participated in by 800
sailors and marines under Lieutenant
Ingersoll of the Philadelphia. Admiral
Beardslee is greatly pleased at the prepa
rations being made for the demonstration
in bis honor and expressed himself as be
ing anxious to do everything in his power
to make the carnival a success.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 2.â
Sixty-four days have elapsed since the
schooner Aida of San Francisco sailed
from Shanghai for Puget Sound, and it is
almost certain the Aida was overtaken by
disaster. It is surmised that the schooner
encountered the typhon of December 14,
which almost foundered the bark Fresno
in the China seas. The Aida is owned by
G. S. Hensdale of San Francisco. It is
seven years old and cost $50,000. A. An

Property in Alameda Goes Back
to the . Source of lis
Purchase.
Senator Stewart ot Nevada Effects 8
Comprcm se With the Widow of
H s Former Colleague.
Judge Coffey has signed an order au
thorizing Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, executrix
of the will of the late Senator Leland Stan
ford, to compromise tha $169,083 89 claim
of the said estate against Senator William
M. Stewart of Nevada, and in considera
tion of the claim to receive all the real
estate in the city and county of Alameda
now held by Senator Stewart. ,
In her petition to tbe court Mrs. Stan
ford sets forth that at the time of Senator
Stanford's death Senator Stewart owed
him $128,930 49 or thereabouts, and that
the aggregate of tbe indebtedness up to
the 21st* of January, 1897. amounted to
$169,053 89 or thereabouts ; that it has been
agreed between her and Senator Stewart
to compromise the indebtedness on this
basis: That the Stanford estate is to re
lea?o Senator Stewart from all indebted
ness ami to deliver up to him all evidences
of the same in consideration of the fact
that Senator Stewart and his wife, Annie
Â£. Stewart, shall forthwith transfer by
deed to the Stanford estate free from in
cumbrance ail their interest in and to the
extensive real-estate holdings in Alameda
County, hitherto standing in Senaior
Stewart's name. '
The properly thus transferred to the
Stanford estate may be described as. fol
lows:
A parcel of land on Wiliow street, near
Chestnut, in Alameda, containing about *-â¢)_.
acres.
Also the following lots in I-lewelling
Division Tract, filed October 18, 1887: Lots 1
to 12, iv block A; lots 1 to 18, in bu.ck B; lots
110 14, in block C; lots 1 to 14, in block D;

F; lots 1 to 14, in block G; lot 2 to 8, in
block J.

tending southerly, containing 8 3 i acres.
Also a portion of lot 32, in section 13, town
hip 2 south, range 4 west, of tide lands,
containing three acres.
Also a portion of lot 25 in section 18, town
ship 2 south, range 4 west, of tide lands lying
westol the Bishop &â  Hunt Tract, containing
3.90 acres.
Also a piece of land beginning at the inter
section oi the western line of Stanford street
with the north line of Clement avenue, and
forming a parallelogram by running north,
east, west and south, being lots 9,10,11 and
nart of lot 8, in block 1 oi land adjacent to the

4 and 5 in block 46 and a strip on the south
erly side of lot 1 in block 37, the same being
33 feet wide, the length of said lot on Web
ster street.
In support of her petition Mrs. Stanford
represents that the compromise and set
tlement are just and for the best interests
of the Stanford estate and all persons in
terested therein. .
Judge Coffey's order authorizes Mrs.
Stanford to take immediate possession of
the property described and to perform nil
acts necessary to carry into effect her
compromise and settlement with Senator
Stewart.
This marks the close of a deal in real
estate that was begun by Senator Stewart
ten years ago, the cash for the venture be
ing supplied by the late Senator Stanford.
Considerable profit was realized by Sena
tor Stewart on account of holdings sold
by him during the early part of his enter
prise. .
MEALS FOR JURORS.
Judge Cook Will Insist on Having
Them Supplied by the Sheriff.
Judge Carroll Cook says he has no dis
cussion with other public officers in re
gard to the proper treatment of jurors
who are serving in his department of the
Superior Court. He says that under fhe
law* it is his duty to see that the. jurors
shall not suffer from' hunger while per
forming public duties.
Section 1136 of the Penal Code touching
the matter reads as follows:
While the jury are kept together, either
during the progress of the trial or after thtir
retirement for deliberation, they must be
provided by the Sheriff*, at the expense of
the County, with sufficient food and lodging.
"I regret that any of the Supervisors do
not r.gree in regard to tiie force of the
statute in regard to the meals of jurors "
said Judge Cook. "While I have given
due consideration to the condition of the
public finances and have no desire to
burden he treasury, yet I cannot author
ize any interference with the administra
tion of justice so far as the affairs of this
department of the Superior Court are
concerned. "

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT

WHICH CURED HIM AFTER EVERY-
THING ELSE FAILED.
Painful disease*, ore bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
ia no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almou impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled ana
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
petter take a dose of polaon and thus end all
his throublts. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
tbe general health, but enlarged his weak
emaciated Darts to natural size and vigor, and*
he now declares that any man who will 'take
the trouble to send his name and aildress may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men

manhood who would be cured at one* could

cured me.- Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but scad for it and'

that, although they cost nothing to get are

NEW YORK MARKETS.
- Fin uncial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb 2.â Profit-taking was
the order of the day at the Stock Exchange to
day. The selling movement was not general.
Transactions footed only 115,772 shares. In this
total Northern Pacific figured for 30,500, Burling
ton nnd Quincy for 20,000 and sugar for 7000.
At tbe start the Northern Pacific were the center
of attraction, which was to be expected in view of
the Joint sale of holders to German capitalists and
friends of the Great Northern. Blocks of stock
were offered right at the opening, under which
press the common receded % to lsi/ 8 and the pre
ferred 1% to 37 Vs.
Other disturbing influences were lack of London
orders, a stock and grain failure at Boston and
rumors that the statements of the granger roads,
now due, will lie very unfavorable.
Western Union was sod down 1% to 82% on
the adverse decision rendered by the Supreme
Court yesterday in the Ol.ioand Indiana tax cases,
later ihe rtoCK rallied on the statement tbat the
sum involved was Insignificant. .
Among thehigh-pilceds ocks, New York, New
England -and Hartford were conspicuous for a
break to SO. Yesterday odd lots were traded In
at 171@173i^. .Final transactions were effected
10-day at 164. The street was flooded with unfa
vorable rumors about the sloe*, It was said thai
the company had a floating debt of b-tween
$0 000,000 and $9 000,001; that a new issue of
stock was Imminent, ai.d that the dividends are
likely to be reduced. Nothing of an olllcial char
acter was forthcoming.
In the Industrials Sugar was steady. General

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. In., Feb. 2.â Further Improve
ment In wheat over yesterday's closing took
place. There was %d advance In Liverpool, so it
was reported, but in the first half hour lower
prices ranged. There was another rally shortly
after, but trade was moderate and of a scalping
order. Receiots were 45 cars, and 27,253 bushels
were withdrawn from store. The Northwest had
260 cars, against 107 last Tuesday and t't*4 a year '
ago. Reported reduced acreage of the French
crop was a strengthening feature early in the
session.
Before noon the prices worked through the
calls, but around that point offerings proved heavy
enough to check the advance. Export clearances
were moderate at 460.886 bushels.. Bradstreet's
reported a decrease in the world's stocks of 2,
--164,000 bushels. The closing Continental cables
were lower. Further strength developed ln the
last hour, the consideration being the sale here of
200,000 bushels of cash wheat for export. May
wheal opened from 74Â»4c to 74" B e. sold between
74V4C and 75i_.c. Closing at 7594 c, Lgfai^c

mate. Liverpool quoted Vi~l advance in the price
of corn. Exports amounted to 693,141 buslie s.
Bradstreet's available stocks Increased 147, 458.

OATSâ The trade was devoid of Incident. The
action was prompted by the movement of wheat,
the price range being, however, narrow. Receipts

UNION STOCKYARDS, 111.. Feb. 2.-Desplte
the limited receipts prices are ru.l.ig very low for
most of the cattle arriving here. It would seem
that with corn ln lowa and Nebraska selling at
10(g,l lc per bushel tbe owner of. cattle would hold
their stock until they are well matured ana thus
get a fair price for his corn, ba; such is not tho
case. The need for ready money uo doubt acuates
farmers in sending lorward stock that is not half
fat. Receipts were moderate aria prices were
steady. The supply of hots was liberal, and prices
for that article continues on the down grade.
About 5000 head were carried o. er trom yester
day Into 10-day's market, and witn a run of about
27,000 trade dragged with a further reduction of
sc. There was lue usual light receipt, lor Tues
day. The receipts of sheep aud lambs wer> only

"EARTHQUAKE POSTS."
The Japanese Prepared to Flee on the
First Â« _i in to m of seismic Troubles.
There is nothing so appalling as a real
earthquake â an earthquake in earnest.
Even in' such countries as Japan and
Equatorial America, whero they are quite
usual, nobody ever grows indifferent or ac
customed to this one terriole energy of
nature, wherein she seems to rebel against
her own sanity, and to deny to her
children the very foundations of their ex
istence. Those who in such lands have
often experienced the blade, the 0
Jishin, will recognize promptly the
truth of the descriptions, hurriedly con
veyed in all the various local ac
counts which our columns this morning
contain. There is, all on a sudden, that
underground noise of a "rushing, mighty
wind" "-next, the swilt, impervious vibra
tion, as it were, of the very bones of the
earth, which sets everybody shaking in a
sickly swing, has first a tremendous cres
cendo, and afterward a doubtful, linger
ing, uncertain diminuendo, about which
you never feel perfectly certain that it
will decline and cease until the last
horrible - murmur is over and the
earth herself seems to pause, silent
and fearful, at that cry of unrest
and ruin which has gone through her in
wards. Generally, however, if great mis
chief be not wrought at the first clash of
the subterranean storm, it is a sign that
the danger will pass away. In Japan,
which has perhaps suffered more bitterly
than any other country from earthquakes,
the peril is placidly accepted as natural
to human life. No stately or costly
structure can be reared in those islands,
where tbe work of years might vanish in
a moment. The houses are perforce of
the slightest and lightest materials; the
holy temples Ihemselves of wood and
shinele. The . small, easily erected
abodes have central "earthquake posts,"
moving in stone sockets, and "earth
quake doors" firmly framed, so as
to afford the inmates a chance of
thereby escnping when O Jishin comes in
earnest. Nobody speaks carelessly of the
terror. Nobody knows, by day or night,
whether the dull roar of the under-world
and the sharp, fierce throb of the rattling,
breaking rocks may not .all upon the soft
est and sweetest hours of slumber, either
shaking down the heavy roof upon the
sleepers, and -so crushing them, or, by
overturning the lamps among the fur
niture, causing that general conflagration
which too frequently follows the earth
quake in Japan.â London Telegraph.

More; than a year ag-o W. R. Ellis be
came convinced that Livermore was not
being sufficiently boomed and kept before
the world for its own good, so he went
to that town, bought a newspaper,
commenced to make things lively,
and, as a result, Livermore now has a

\ â¢'. ShaH Outrival Livermore, and Who Has Thrown Down
. the Gaun-ltt to the Northern City.
' things which can be traced directly to the
'influence of Mr. E lis.
A few weeks ago R. H. McGiil Jr. be
â¢_ came convinced that Pleasanton was
altogether too much like a one-mule town
and was known too little in the busy
world outside its boundaries for the good
* jot "its inhabitants, and he decided that be
â¢would" out-do Livermore. He went to
Pleasanton, bought a newspaper, and has
liow started in earnest to work for
. Pleasanton until such a time as Liver
more shall occupy a seat in the rear.
Mr. McGill has started out in no nncer
.' 'tain tone. He realizes that it takes two
*â¢ to make a healthy tight and that Pleas
* antbn is the kind of a town that s rikes
J back hardest when it is hit most severely.
Guided by this belief he has already cre
ated quite a lively spirit cf rivalry be
tween the two towns, and yesterday he
â¢ formulated, a series of most violent
Charges against tbe little town.
'.'More than once," says Mr. McGiil,
"Livermore has stolen Pleasanton's thun
â * der and we have calmly submitted to the
'. piracy without even ihe mildest kind of a
protest. The time has come for Pleas
anton to awake. We have been sleeping
too long and other towns have marched
â  ahead while we have been peacefully
j slumbering. Other towns have reached out
* for every opportunity to advertise and
boom their localities and make the most
"of every chance that comes along. As an
example of this the case of Livermore is
worthy of careful thought. Its people
have shown a spirit of progressiveness.
with the result that the town has gone
ahead and by reason of its enterprise has
been widely advertised all over the coun
try. It has gone further in this direction
than another town I can call to mind.
;. -But we will now throw down the
â¢ gauntlet in earnest and let her see that,
L-ithough we are not the least bit jealous
ft>. her, we do not intend that she shall
progress to our disadvantage. Few out
side those living in the immediate vicin
ity know that Pleasanton is the largest
shipping point on the line of the railroad
in Alameda County, with the exception of
Oakland. Livermore has been credited
with that honor and has raaue the most of
it, even though the railroad business is
only about half of what it is at Pleasan
ton. Livermore has also exhibited *t
home and abroad fruit from trees that are
growing within the limits of Pleasanton,
and labeled it the product of Livermore.
"Good tobacco is grown within half a
mile of our town limits. It has been
cured and taken. to Livermore and ex
hibited there and elsewhere as a product
.of that town, while as' a matter of fact
'. experiments have shown that not a pound
"of the weed could be grown thereunder
the most favorable circumstances. Liver
more has been stealing from us for a long
time, but it must now cease, and we will
Claim all the credit that justly belongs to
' us." *
The next move between the rival towns
is being awaited with great interest and
there is no doubt that Livermore will
Officially repudiate : the charges made
Against -her good. name.
H. H. Pitcher, the president of the
League of Progress, said to-night that
â¢ Pieasanton's charges against Livermore
are unfounded. "Pleasan'on is only six
miles from our city." said Mr. Pitcher,
"and we regard it almost as a suburb. As
â¢a matter of fact, the people of Pleasanton
ruver could agree among themselves, and
â¢â¢â¢lie leading citizens of that town come to
i '"rmore to transact business. We are
m ;â ':*Â« willing for Pleasanton to go ahead.
â¢ wne can go a long way ahead before Liver
more will be aware of the fact.
"At the present time Pleasanton has
more little fights of her own on . hand
than she can handle, and we do not fear
.being eclipsed in the matter of progress
during the next week. Various projects
have been started lately which should
have been located at Pleasanton, but not
.one dollar could be found there open for j
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
investment, and in consequence the little
town of Altamont obtained a sub-cream
ery which should naturally have gone to
Pleasanton.
"On one occasion, I remember, we
though; we would put a little life into our
neighboring town. We chartered a band
and a special train and about a thousand
of us went to Pleasanton after dark and
gave the town a surprise party. We found
it asleep, and really we were made to feel
as though we were trespassing. We did
the same thing nt Sunol, which is not
quite so large as Pleasanton, and we were
received at the schoolhouse and had a
cood time. Really, Livermore hopes that
Pleasanton will improve muchly and
speedily. We admire her pluck but re
serve our opinion of her judgment. "
VALUABLES MISSING.
The in am 4 of Simon Murback Found
in the Bay Without
Money.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 2.â The remains
ol Simon Murback. formeilv a section
foreman for the North Pacific Coast Rail,
road at Sausaiito, were recovered from
the bay this morning near the narrow
gauge pier. Louis Schroder of Alameda
and Frank Costa of East Oakland were
tho first to discover the body. . They im
me_ia:eiy notified Coroner Baldwin and
Deputy Quiilen tcok charge of the re
mains.
Murback resided at 302 Twenty-fourth
street with his family. For seventeen
years he had been with tbe above road,
but had been out of employment since
August. He left home yesterday .morn
i-ig.at._B o'clock to visit Superintendent
Schumacher of the road with the hope of
again getting work. That was the last
his family saw of him alive.
Mr 3. Murback was greatly excited over
the failure of her husuand to return, and
when the Deputy Coroner called, and be
fore be could say anything, she asked if
he had any news of her husband. She
was much affected by the sad news. Mrs.
Murback says her husband had a silver
watch and $2 in money when he left
home, but nothing but 30 cents was found
on his person. How he met bis death is a
mystery, as there an** no marks to indi
cate foul play or that he had fallen from
the train.
Decayed was a native of Switzerland,
aged 56 years, and has a grown family, one
son being a motorraan on the Sixteent h
street branch of lhe Oakland Consolidated
Electric Road. No one knows whether he
reached Sausaiito, as no word has been
received from there. From all indica
tions the body had not been in the water
long.
44 Father " Lorenzo Waugh, Now in His Eiehty-Ninth Year.
Lorenzo Waugb was born on the 28th of August, 1808, near Greenbrier River,
West Virginia, in what is now Pocahontas County. ' He is the. oldest of twelve
children. In his younger days he knew Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams,
Thomas H. Benton and other great men who figured in American history. He
arrived in California in 1852, having come over the plains in an ox team, and on
his arrival here be was met by General Vallejo. who made him a present of 320 acres
of land in Sonoma County, near Petaluma. This land he afterward divided be
tween his children, retaining forty acres for himself, which he afterward sold for
$5500 and put that amount in .the People's Home Savings Bank, where it still
remains.
â¢ His great boast is that he never used tobacco or intoxicating llqoors of any
kind. This, he claims, is what has kept him as strong and healthy as he now is.
His present residence is at Los Olivos, in Santa Barbara County.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, . WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1897.
MR. LLOYD'S REPORT
City Jail So Shaky That His
Prisoners Are Likely
to Escape.
Less Officers in Proportion Than
Any Other City in
the Union.
Emphasizes the Nied of Quarters for
Women, G rls and Children
Under Arrest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway. Feb. *.. j"
Chief Lloyd has filed his annual report
with the City Council, and the leading
feature of it is a strong appeal for a better
place of confinement lor women, girls and
children who are arrested.
A plan for caring for them was recently
published in Tar. Call, and it is on the
line therein advocated that the Chief
! would like to see an institution estab
lished by the Council.
"The condition of the City Prison,"
says the report, "furnishes a great deal of
anxiety to myself and those city officials
who by reason of their position have b--
--come acquainted therewith. The prison
is dark, damp and gloomy, insecure as a
place of detention and exceedingly un
healthy. Some steps are being taken with
a view to improving these conditions, but
however much may be done, located as it
is, the place will still be more or less
hedged about with the drawbacks above
referred to. The lack of any provision;
for women, boys and .iris detained here
outside of unceremoniously dumping
them in with the rougher criminal ele
ment is a serious menace and a condition
that merits earnest consideration.
"I find also that while the city of Oak
land pays a large portion of the lund re
quired to pay the Receiving Hospital and
tne County Farm, this Police Depart
ment is absolutely at the mercy of the
caprice of those in chargo of said institu
tions, and I : aye learned by experience
that this department may be refused the
privilege of placing persons in our charge
and who may be in need of proper medi
cal treatment within those institutions, no
matter how argent the case, and we have
no power to alter the decree of those in
authority."
The Chief then goes on to compare
0 ikland's Police Department with that of
other cities. He Ims fifty men for a terri
tory embracing 70,000 people, which is an
i fflcer' to every 1400. San Francisco has
one officer to ev-ry 536 people. Grand
Rapids has one officer to every 1000 peo
ple, and this is the highest average in the
Union except Oakland. The Chief asks
that at least twenty men be added to the
department, and declares that unless this
be done the taxpayers cannot be given the
nrotection to which they are entitled.
The balance of the report consists of
kindly words for the public prosecutor,
the City Council and the individual mem
bers of the Police Department.
OPPOSE WOODWARD.
The .Realty Syndicate Claims He Has
Dealt in Bond** to the I jury of '.'.' â¢
tho -toad.
OAKLAND, Cai., Feb. 2.â The Realty
Syndicate, of which F. to. Smith is the
leading spirit ami -Frank C. Harms mana
ger, is. after F.J. Woodward, receiver of
1 the Highland Park and Fruitvale Rail
s road. They have filed a petition asking
! that he be cited to show cans.* why he
I should not be removed and a new receiver
: be named wbo will serve without charge
j lo the corporation. .
This is the latest move growing out
of the recent disagreement over the com
pensation to be allowed Woodward, who
claims that Smith and his associates are
down on him because he stood in the way
of the Realty Syndicate in "jamming" the
holders of some minority interests in the
road. ______t\
The petitioners on the other hand al
lege "that as receiver Woodward has not
managed the affair-- of the road in the in-.
terest of the defendant corporation, nor
the stockholders or bondholders, in that
according to information and belief of
this affiant the said Woodward has made
laree sums of money by reason of his
transactions in connection with the affairs
of the said corporation, as follows, to wit:
The said Woodward, while such receiver,
dealt in the bonds of such corporation,
purchasing from one bondholder for a
price less than the amount for which he
ha*- sold them to other individuals, and
retaining the profit therefrom derived as
hi- own money said Woodward has also
failed to attend to the affairs of said cor
poration, has permitted its rolling-stock
to run down and the condition of the
track and property of the said defendant
corporation to degenerate. Upon its in
crmation and belief the said Woodward
has settled claims against the said corpor
ation for less than their face and has
charged the corporation the fuil sum
thereof."
KILLED BY DELAY.
Capital Drifted Away From a Com
peting 'telephone Com
pany.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 2.â The Commer
cial Telephone Company will not establish
a system in this city. The following in
teresting communication has been received
by the Council, and the check for $5000 has
been returned. It was written by E. R.
Smith, general manager ci the proposed
company:
In June, 1885, 1 approached a number of ac
quaintances and friends in this city witn a
view to Interesting tnem in a telephone enter
prise in the city of Oakland. After carefully
going over the matter tney, with myself, con
cluded that there was an opening for a busi
ness of the character mentioned and agreed
with me to take sufficient stock in the company
when organized to construct a telephone line
as soon as the franchise was obtained.
Ravin**: previously talked with quite a num
ber of your business men and several members
of yonr Council, â  â  gained the idea that there
would be no difficulty whatever in obtaining
MISS REBECCA KIEVE, the Leader of the Beth-Jacob Choir,
7 Who Has Disappeared*
the franchise. 'Acting on this supposition,
canvassers were put in the field, and at a con
siderable expense, quite a number of contracts
were obtained from firms and Individuals
agreeing to use a telephone of our company
whenever lines should be constructed auil
ready for use.
We continued ln this line until we found it
impossible to proceed further without first
obtaining a franchise from your city author
izing construction of our proposed telephone
line.
From that time on we began to devote our
attention to obtaining the franchise itself, and
found much to our surprise and regret that
delay followed delay until months had
rolled by. In the meantime my associates
gradually drifted into other enterprises (one
of the most prominent ones met with a sud
den peath) and now the original plans of the
company have become entirely changed. We
do not calm that the delays oi the Council iv
passing ordinances were in any way unneces
sary, but the effects on our company were jast
the same as if they had been. Had the fran
chises been promptly granted the proposed
hue would have b.-ea constructed at once and
would now be in operation.
We have recently endeavored to interest one
or two competing companies with us. One of
them was willing and anxious and would
have joined with us but for the fact that they
claim that there existed one or two features
that made the validity of franchises question
able, even though It should be finally passed
by your honorable body. Prominent among
the defects is one contained in section 10,
which states "such ordinance to be finally
passed, ready for the Mayor of the city, within
ten days after date of sale of such franchise."
In view of existing circumstances we ueslre
to withdraw our appllcat on for franchise and
request the return of certified check which is
now in the hands of your City Clerk.
Having paid all costs and expenses con
nected with the matter we know that you will
at once comply with our petition.

before Justice Morris tbis morning. He
made no defense and was held to appear
before the Superior Court with bonds
placed at $2000. -The prosecution exam
ined Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Axx of Berkeley;

watched the proceedings with interest.
Neither was placed upon the stand.
Gay will appear in court to-morrow
and it is claimed that he will plead guilty,
as he desires to begin serving his sentence.
It transpired to-day that Gay had scru
tinized the ' marriage-contract records and
-seemed to . fear; tbat another marriage
might be sprung upon him. He seemed
relieved to find no record of anything
against him.'
STOLE A CHILD
FROM HER FATHER
Peculiar Conduct of the Lady
Leader of a Jewish
Choir.
Miss Bessie Xi ye Ba fl?s All
the Sheriffs Attempts to
. . Find Her.
Her Friends Refuse lo Entertain the
Idea That She Has
Elop d.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, F*Â»b. 2. J
Miss Bessie Kieve has disappeared and
her father is unable, even with the aid of
the Sheriff.** office and private detectives,
to locate her. Miss Kieve is the organizer
ot the choir at the Beth Jacob Synagogue
and came of age a short time ago. The
first thing she did after attaining her ma
jority was to take out letters of guardian
ship over her little brother and thus
legally steal the child from its' own
father.
For several days Sheriff White has been
trying to serve an order of court on Miss
Kieve, but she has disappeared as com
pletely as though swallowed by an earth
quake. The peculiar manner in which
she obtained letters of guardianship over
her brother was placed before the Su
perior Court ahd an order made com
manding her to bring the child into
court. The boy has been located with
some relatives at Berkeley, but pending
the appearance of the guardian his father
Is unable to recover his own child. The
young lady is just over 18 and is one of
tne leading members of Rabbi Lincfcer's
congregation, and her disappearance has
caused all sorts of rumors to be circulated,
although her relatives are positive tbat
the reported story of an elopement has no
foundation.
Lipman Kieve and family resided in San
Jose for many years and last October Mrs.
Kieve died. The family consisted of Re
becca, better known as Bessie, and three
boys, the youngest of whom is Harold
Maurice, aged 4. Soon after the death of
their mother, Mr. Kieve moved to San
Francisco, and for the better care of his
children he placed them in charge of Mrs.
Annie F. x, their grandmother, who re
sides at 2427 Dwight way, Berkeley. He
bas been employed for some time as a
commercial traveler for a large wholesale
house in San Francisco, and, being unable
to personally look after his young family,
he was advised to leave them with rela
tives.
Before leaving San Jose he had a little
trouble with his eldest daughter because,
without his authority and before he was
aware of it. she sold the entire furniture
of his house and refused to give him any
satisfaction regarding the disposition of
tbe proceeds. Having lived in close rela
tionship with bis family all his life, Mr.
: Kieve soon became tired of being sepa
i rated from tnem, so he prepared a fine
I home for them with relatives in San
Francisco so that he could meet them as
often as he was in that City.
He came over to Berkeley to take his
children to Sau Francisco, and, greatly to
his surprise, found tbat his daughter Bes
sie, having become of age, had, on the last
day ot December, applied .for and ob
tained letters oi guardianship on the
ground that tbeir father had abandoned
them and had gone to parts unknown.
The father at once began proceedings to
get back his child, and got an order to
show cause why Bessie suould not have
her letters of guardianship revoked; but,
up to this time, the order has not been
served and Bessie has not been seen.
Sheriff White, after employing Detective
Logan for several days, has been forced to
make a return that Bessie cannot be
found and that she must be in biding,. as
several of her friends have expressed a de
sire to hide her whereabout!*.
The case was called 10-day before Judge
Ogden, and, alter bearing all the testi
mony, it was postponed for one week and
service ordered to b^ obtained by publica
tion. It will come up again next
day. ,
Rabbi Lincker, who has been studying
English under the tutelage of Miss Bessie
Kieve, was asked by Detective Logan if be
knew her -present address. He replied
that be did not consider it anybody's busi
ness to make inquiry of him about the
young lady. â  "- .
â â¢ Mr. Kieve is certain that there is some
circumstance connected with this case of
which he is not aware, and he thinks that
his daughter Bessie was persuaded to sell
his home out at San Jose and steal his
youngest son by some one who has an
interest to subserve of which the father is
not aware.

ACCUSED OF CRAWFISHING
Captain Cole of Berkeley's Crew
Throws Darts at Stan
ford .
Says "They Prop se 1 Boatin**; as an
Intercollegiate Sport and Then
Backed Out.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 2.â Stanford's
stated reasons for not entering boatraces
against Berkeley are lar from satisfactory
to the Berkeley managers of aquatic
sports. President W. E. Cole of the U.
C. Boating Association has written a re
ply to the Palo Alto athl tic captain, in
which he uses some plain language.
"Stanford's objection might be valid if
we had started the rowing question," says
President Cole. "But the fact is that the
issue is of the Stanford men's making. In
1892 Stanford organized its famous crew
to go to the World's Fair at Chicago. The
crew was universally conceded the first
place and was widely advertised. Of
course, after all this, we could not remain
quiet. Some of our students look up the
work and by their energy we had the
finest rowing club on the* bay.
"We got a couch, rented a boat anl
started to train a crew. Negotiations were
entered into and were almost carried to a
final decision when the Stanford men sud
denly let the matter drop. In view of all
this and the fact that as early as January,
1893, Senator Stanford gave them $800
toward a shell to race us in, their state
ments are not only absurd but are an at
tempt to transfer the responsibility to the
wrong shoulders.
"The Stanford captain says his col
legians are very anxious to row, but if so
they have not shown it so far. We have
-.one to great 'rouole to be prepared io
meet them. For two years we hired a
couch for that purpose. After wailing
patiently al this time we think it but fair
that they should take some step in the
matter. We do not ask for a race this
term. We do ask tnp.t they set some
! definite date, '98 or '99, or whenever it
i mr.y be, when they will meet us on the
i water."
Every season for the last six year**,
Berkeley das had a rowing crew, and
creater or less interest has been taken in
aquatic sports by .the- student body.
Though having been unfortunate in losing
their boathouse in Sessions basin by fire
in 1895, it was soon rebuilt, so that the
interest in rowing has been unbroken
since the inauguration of the sport as a
branch of university athletic--. The oars
men feel keenly the lack of competition.

VERY BIG MONEY
ON SMALL JOBS
The Grand Jury Looking
Upon the Ciiy and County
Hospital.
. Dr. Stable Explains About That
Rich, Costly Velvet
Carpet.
The Attempted Bribery rf Dr. DcdÂ»e
by Milkman Frank -Marty
Also Inquired Into.
The Grand Jury was occupied all day
yesterday with an inquiry into the at
tempt on the part of Milkman Frank
Marty to bribe Supervisor Washington i
Dodge in his effort to secure a renewal of i
his contract to deliver milk to the City
and County Hospital, and also into the
alleged mismanagement or misappropria
tion of funds at the City and County Hos
. pita!.
Dr. Dodge himself told how Marty ap
proached him in the matter declaring he
would give $1090 for the contract.
Captain Reddy, superintendent of the j
Almshouse, and Colonel McClunj**. the j
bookkeeper/also told how Marty offered
them money without any consideration I
on different occasions while delivering
milk there under ihe old contract, which |
money they refused to accept.
The' jur/will continue the investigation j
at the next sittinn.
In the other matter a great numb*>pof
witnesses were called, among them Dr.
Hart, chairman ot the hospital committee !
of the Board of Health, ex-Superintendent j
Stahle, Steward Edmonds and ex-Steward
Robinson and bis son, formerly assistant |
steward, and Apothecary Hickman.
The inquiry developed the fact that !
there had been at least ridiculous mis- I
management, witn indications of worse. I
The testimony of ex-Steward Robinson |
went to show that not enough money was
allowed tbe hospital to carry it on prop
erly, and that In the face of this fact work
was undertaken calling for many times
the sum in hand. In this way, he said,
money was frittered away. The sewerage
of the hospital was simply an invitation
to disease, he said. He had tried to make
some improvement in certain of the drains
nnd taken a fever in consequence that laid
him up for months. He said that in lay
â¢ inz the new drnins the old drains had been
" allowed to remain and were a nuisance to
the healtb of the people about the hospi
tal who were not already ; ck. He "aid ;
that the hospital was a bankrupt affair; I
that the beds and bedding were old and
dilapidated, and that no appropriation
that could be obtained on the score of re
. pairs couM put the institution in order.
Dr. Hart testified to much the same !
thing.
Steward Edmonds told how big money j
had been spent on small jobs.
Dr. Stable was asked about that velvet
carpet which was bought out of the hos
pital fund and put down in his own j
house. He said that when he took the
superintendent*}* he called for a new car
pel for the effice. as the one on tho floor
was very shabby. The Supervisors said j
there was no money and Dr. Stahle took \
a carpet out ot his own bouse and put it
down in the office. When he went out of
offic? he would uot take the carpet which
had been in the public service so long and j
the Supervisors allowed him to buy a now
carpet for his house to take the place of
the other.
The whole matter was referred to a
committee for a thorough investigation
and special report.
GRIFFIN'S PARTIAL REPORT
Specially Prepared for the Grand
Juryâ Further Disclosures.
W. D. Griffin, the expert accountant of
the Board of Health, has submitted a par
tir.l report of his investigation of trie ac- j
counts of the City and County Hospital â¢
to Dr. Henry E. Hart, chairman of the
Hospital Committee. This report ha 3
already been examined by the Grand Jury
and Mr. Griffin himself gave evidence be
fore that body in the same connection
yesterday afternoon. Other witnesses
who testified yesterday were Officer J. W.
â¢Buiterworth, who has been specially de
tailed by the Chief of Police to assist the
Health Department in its investigations,
and Paul Edwards, the newly appointed
hospital steward. Mr. Griffin's disclosures
are an amplification of the facts already
published, and may, therefore, be left to
-â peak for themselves. The report is as
follows: - -MSSmm
Henry H. Hart. .V. D.. Chairman Hospital Com
mittee, Hoard of Health, Saw Francisco, Cat. â
Dear i-iK*. I nave the honor to submit for
your consideration the tollowing partial re
port of my .Investigation of the accounts of
the City and County Hospital to date.
Special repair fund appropriationâ James
J. F.vnn, kalsomlning November 28, 1896,
$480; De-emhcr 4. 1896,9325; December 18,
' 1896, $470. Total $1275.
It was understood that the . annexes and
anterooms of the different wards were to be
Included in this work, but on investigation
the lollowing were found to have been
omitted : Ward A. water closet; ward B, pantry
and office; ward C, pantry, office and bath
room; ward D. pnntry, office, bathroom, sink
room and water-cioset; ward Â£, pantry, sink
room, bathroom and water-closet; ward F,
office, first nursery and two anterooms; ward
G, office, pantry, bathroom, sinkroom and
water-closet; wards H, J, X, X, M, N, office,
pantry, bathroom, sinkroom and water-closet;
.ward C, pantry, operating-room, sinkroom,
bathroom and water-closet.
Operating-rcoras 1 and 2â With the excep
tion of the ve_iibu.es no work was done in
these rooms.
Many of the bathrooms, water-closes, sink
rooms and pantries are iv very poo' condi
tion; the walls and celling stained with leak
age, the plaster broken off and the kalsomine
scaling.
The bill of John J. Mulcreavy for concrete
work is also in error. On actual measure
ments taken of the work performed the fol
lowing overcharges are located: Storeroom,
charged for 2-_**'J4. should be 24x19:8;* over
charge 104 square feet. Vegetable-room,
cnarged for 27x27, should be 17x17; over
charge 440 -quure feet. Butcher-shop,
28x17, should be 28x17. Passageways,
charged for 9x50, should be 9x46, overcharge
3ts square tee* ; 15x10, should be Gxll, over
charge 84 square feet; 12x15, should be 12x
15. Total overcharges 064 square leet, at 18.8
cents, $124 83.
This same party renders his bill for concrete
work in water-closets in the sum of $195:
which at the rate p-r foot charged by him in
the above mentioned bill, would be the
equivalent of 1038 square feet. The actual
measurement of this work, however, is as
follow. -: Ward A bathroom and sinkroom.
12x12; water-closet 12x12; ward B, water
closet, 12x12; bathroom and sin-room, 12x12;
-ranking a total of 576 -square feet, an over
charge ol 462 square leet at 18 cents, sÃ6 85.
The charge of 18.8 cents per square loot for
this work is, in my opinion, exorbitant, and
* should not have been more than 10 cents per
square foot, which, I am informed, would be
a very liberal figure.
Bill of timothy F'ynn for "lathing and
plastering wall, hall, corridors aud ap
proaches." $265. Under the guidance of the
retddeut physician. Dr. F. W. Dudley, and ac
comraaicd by Officer John W. Butterworth,
sptci-1 detail to the Health Department, I
visited every ward and department of the
hospital, with the exception of the nurses'
quarters and the sleeping-rooms lh the execu
tive building, and as to these I made inquiries
of the superintendent of nurses, Miss Patton,
- and the matron, Mrs. Back, regarding any
repairs having been penormed. There is no
evidence whatever of any lathing having
been done, and the only plastering which ap
pears to have been repaired within a great
lime is as follows: Ward B. closet, about 2x5
feet; ward C, closet, about 2}4 square yards;
ward C, sinkroom. about '__ square feet;" ward
D, ceiling, about 2 square feet.
" Furthermore. I inquired of Dr. Dudley, who
makes frequent visits dally throughout the
entire hospital, as to any work nt a similar na
ture having been performed, and was informed
by him that there was none, for it there had
been it would surely have been noticed Dy
him. The different nurses lv charge of the
wards were also interrogated, with the same
result.
Bill of James Duffy _ Co.. October 19,1890
(changed to read December 1, 1896), for two
l.odv Brussels 1 Carpets, â 77 yards at $125.
$90 25; 85 yards lining at 7}Â£ cents, $0 35;
total, $10-* 60.
On inves'lgatioa I learned from Mr. Jour
dan, manager for James Duffy <fe .that Dr.
Stable presented the order ior the carpets and,
not being satisfied with the stock on band
there, was given an order on one of the whole
sale carpet houses for such carpet, as he de
sired; that he so received the goods and had
some laid in his own private residence on
McAllister street. Mr. Jourdin informs roe
that he saw Dr. ytame lust Snnday. the 24th
in si., in reference lo my visit to him in
search of this information, and was told by
Dr. Stable that he had received the permis
sion and approval of the I osrd of Health and
the chairman of the Hospital Committee of
the late Board of Supervisors for this pur
chase, and that it was in exchange for certain
carpets that he had brought with him to the
hospital and Pad left there after his removal
therefrom. I am informed that tne carpets
furnished were velvet and not body Brussels.
The results of investigations now under
way will be submitted to you in due course.
Respectfully. W. D. Griffin,
Expert Accountant.
TROUBLE COMES DOUBLY.
Health Inspector Uockery 'a Father and
Brother Both I'ur.gei 111.
Health Inspector Dockery is* meeting
with a series of misfortunes which have
awakened the sympathy of all the officials
at the new City Hall. Some time ago Mr.
Dockery's father fell seriously ill and he
has been considered to be in a critical con
dition for some time. Mr. Dockery has
passed ail the time he could spare from
ins oflicial duties with his father. Re
cently ue communicated with another "on,
his brother. Key. Father Dockery of New
Orleans. The last named gentleman lelt
as deeply as the Heal Inspector and
journeyed all the way from New Orleans
to this City that he might be near his
parent's bedside.
Key. Father Dockery had hardly arrived
in the City wnen he also fell sick. It soon
became apparent that he, too, was seri
ously ill. Late last week the Rev. Father
Dockery went to the German Hospital,
where an extremely painful operation \
was performed on him. Yesterday he
was considered to be dangerously sick.
Mr. Dockery is thus doubly distressed.
His father does not know oi the danger
ous illness of liis son. Rev. Father Dockery.
LOUGHBOROUGH'S WILL.
An Instrument Which the Law
yer Drew Up and Wrote
Himself.
The Writer Had Conducted a Great
Many Estates Through the Probata
Courts of This City.
Attorney Alexander D. Keyes yesterday
filed for probate the will of the late A. H.
Loughborough.
The will is written by the deceased, and
dated by him, thus filling the require
ments of a valid holographic will, and in
addition the signature is witnessed by
two friends.
Considerable interest has been felt in
the matter of the form of Mr. Lough
borough's will, for the reason that during
his lifetime he devoted a ereat deal of at
tention to probate legislation, and bad
much experience in the matter of testa
mentary disposition of nropertj . For
these reasons the full text 01 the will is
here given:
in the name of God, amen: I, the under
signed, Alexander H. Loughborough, of the
City and County of San Franelseo, State of
California, do hereby make my last will 'as
follow.'.:
I give, devise and bequeath all the property
; that 1 li.ay own at the time of my death unto
; my beloved wife, Marianne Z. Loughborough,
aad I appoint her so.c executrxot this will
and direct that no security he required of her.
In case she snould not survive me, then I
give, devise and bequeath to mr niece, Mary
Zaue, $5000, to my niece, Bessie Zane, $5000,
and io my nephew, Eddie Zane, $2500, and to
j my beloved children all the rest, residue and
remainder of my property, and appoint my
i son, Alexander Z. Loughborough, executor of
| this wili and direct that no security be re-
I quired of him.
1 declare this to be my will la the presence
: of the subscribing witnesses, whom 1 have re
! quested to subscribe tneir names as witnesses,
: and I declare that this will is entirely written
and dated and signed by me at said City and
County this thirty-first dayof March, in tne
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and ninety-two.
Alexander H. Loughborouch.
Witnessesâ C. ii. Ilatcn, Alexander D. Keyes.
Tnere was a suggestion on the part of
; some lawyers who read the will that it
i would be held invalid in the event of a
! contest, because under its provisions no
share of the estate is bequeathed to the
! children of the deceased. Further con
sideration, however, led to the belief .hat
\ this apparent delect was cured by the later
clauses, which provided ior the residue
going to the children,' provided Mr.
j Loughborough had survived bis wi.e.
j This recognition is held to be sufficient, as
I on its face the will shows thai the testa
j tor was not unmindful of the welfare of :
i his offspring. *-*â¢â¢"â -â 
Mrs. MariannaZane-Loughborough, who
as executrix offers the will for probate,
declares that the value of the estate is at
present unknown to her, and that his
j only heirs at law are the i etttioner and
; hi* sons, Alexander Z. and George A.
Liugh borough, and his dau ters, Pran-
I ces and Josephine Loughborough.
Those familiar with Mr. Loughborough's
affairs think that his cs ale will not net
over $60,000. He had a lucrative business
as a practicing attorney, but was not i.c
\ kind to hoard his gains. He was liberal
in all his relations of life, and particu
'. larly in his family.
The interest of the Loughborough fam
ily in the Keyes building is tbe separate
; property of Mrs. Loughborough, who
comes from the illustrious Zaue lamily,
for whom Z.-iuesvilie, Ohio, was named.
Mr. Loughborough's estate will be con
i fined to his home and the book accounts
| in his law business.
OLD LAW ; SUIT DECIDED-
! Judge Slack Gives Judgment in Favor
of Julius Raum's Estate.
Judge Slack yesterday handed down a
j decision in the sturdily contested lawsuit
|of Clara Baum, administratrix of the
estate of Julius Baum, against Edward
Roper, Kate Roper, David J. Speuce and
others for possession of a valuable piece
of property, 109x50 feet in size, at the
! corner of Turk street and Van Ness
avenue, in this City.
The trial occupied several days, and was
| exhaustively argued by Dr. Edward R.
j Taylor and Attorney Naphtalv ior the
j plaintiff and by Attorneys John B. Mhoon
and T. M. Osmont for tlie defendants.
The present suit bad been in court only
| four years, but It ligation had been pend
| ing in regard to the property in one form
! or another for about a quarter of a cen
i tury.

BURNED OUT OF
THEIR HOMES
Three Houses on Mission
Street Consumed by-
Flames.
A Narrow Escape for Mrs, F.
Munk's Dwelling From
a Similar Fate.
Water Was Obtained From Two
Tanks a Very Long Distance
From tbe Blaz;.
A serious fire, causing the total destruc
tion of three dwellings and the partial de
struction of the fourth, occurred a little
after 7 o'clock yesterday morning, close to j
the Mission . road, near Silver avenue. I
Four or five families were rendered home- I
less and about $4000 worth of property was
destroyed.
The fire started in the residence of Louis
" Metter, at 28 Francis street, which inter
sects Mission street or Mission road at the
4900 block and runs toward the west. The
bouse was a one-story frame, owned by a \
Mrs. Pratt. Mr. Metter arose a little af- j
ter 6 o'clock and started the fire in the
kitchen stove. He went out to attend to
his .poultry and Mrs. Metter a little later
observed that the west end of the house
was full of smoke. She called her'hus
band, but before he arrived the entire side
and roof burst into flames. Every effort j
was made to save the building, but the
fire had too much headway and' the neigh
bors were unable to make any impression
upon the blaze with their backets of water
drawn from a spring near by. .-".' "..'. ,
There was scarcely a breath of, wind," but
slowly and sorely the building was burned
to the ground, and only a part 'of the '
furniture and personal effects of the family
were saved, as the most of the efforts were
directed to the futile attempt- to save the j
house. The loss was about $1000.
In the meantime, Dr. Terrello tele- I
phoned from the drugstore on Silver j
avenue to District Engineer E. F. McKitt
rick at engine 13, on Valencia street, - near !
Twenty-sixth. McKittrick in . turn tele- j
phoned to Ocean View to start out engine |
33, while at the same time he ordered 13 j
to proceed to the fire. Engine 13. had two i
miles to travel, while tbe Ocean View j
steamer had to cover three miles of roads j
that were none the better from the last
"rains. ..â¢{â â¢;â¢â :/.
While the engines were on the way there
the fire bad obtained a strong hold on the
two adjoining buildings. At 26 Francis
street was tne one-story frame cottage
owned and occupied by Mrs. F. W. Mer
ritt. In a short-time it was all ablaze
from foundation to roof. There was suffi
cient time to spare to get the furniture
out of the bouse, but the latter was
doomed. Mrs. Merritt's loss was over
$1000. â¢
On the other side of the Metter dwelling
was the two-story dwelling and junkshop
of Mrs. Bertha Wolch* whose husband
runs a junk-wagon. The fire made great
Process and in a little while this building,
too, was burned to the ground with some
of its contents, causing a loss of about
$1500.
In the meantime the two engine com
panies bad arrived after giving the borses
a very hard run. District Engineer Mo
Kittrick knew that be was badly handi
capped, for there are no water hydrants in
that locality, and the nearest water was in
two tanks used by the vegetable gar
deners. He sent engine 33 to a tank away
down in a plowed field. â¢ Li was all 'the
HOW THE MONEY GOES.
! horses could do to reach the tank, but in
seven or eight minuter 700 feet of hose
was stretched across the field. Some time
ago Mr. McKittrick bad fixeded a gar
j dener's water-tank near Silver avenue, so
i that it could be used in case of a fire in
| the Hebrew Old People's Home, and lo
I this tank he sent engine 13. Over 1300 feet
j of hose was run out before the fire was
i reached.
While this was being done the fire had
made its way into the one-and-a-half-story
cottage owned by Mrs. Frederick Munk,
at 32 Francis street. The water arrived
none too soon, for the side and roof of the
building was ablaze when tbe firemen
turned the two streams upon the struc
ture. The damage to this building was
about $300. The other buildings were by
this time burned to the ground. Had
there been any wind from the west several
other buildings on the surrounding streets
would have suffered the same fate before
the engines could have arrived and got
into operation.
The people who were burned out of
their homes can ill afford the loss they
sustained, and it is said that several were
obliged to accept help and sheher from
their neighbors. Those who saw the lire
men at work under such great difficulties
slate that they did all that men could in
their efforts to save property.

KNEW THAT HE
WAS IN FUNDS.
The Assailants of Old Rod
ger O'Connor Were
Posted.
A Stranger Proposed to Sell
Hi a Fat Political
Position.
No Inquiries Made by th. Police in
R lation to ib.; Crimeâ O'Connor
Is Improving.
The murderous' assault of masked rob
bers on old Rodger O'Connor, which took
place at his cottage, 508 St. Rose avenue,
on Monday afternoon, is beginning to de
velop into a mysterious crime.
It now transpires that several days pre
vious to the assault Mr. O'Connor met a
man on Larkin street who accosted him
by name and began a friendly conversa
tion.
O'Connor did not know the man, but
the stranger seemed familiar with his his
tory and in a short time volunteered the
information that political, jobs were easy
to get if the method was only known. He
said that he was a friend and employe of
a newly elected City otli-ial and that for
the consideration of $100 he could procure
Mr. O'Connor a fat job in the City em
ploy that would last. a couple of years at
least.
The old man with the pleasant garrulity
that comes of old age* confided tnat" he
had recently drawn $200. out of .the
Hibernia Bank, and made an engagement
to meet his new-foun.l friend the next day
to talk the matter over. -
The stranger pained other information
about O'Connor's residence and the fact
that be lived alone in bis little home.
The stranger did not keep the appoint
ment made for the next afternoon,* though
O'Connor "Waited for several hours after
the time that had been agreed upon. .
Then came the assault, with its disas
trous consequences to O'Connor." His
brother,' Martin O'Connor, after learning
of the. conversation with the stranger has
come to the â¢ conclusion that someone,
learning that his brother bad drawn the
money from the bank, planned to get it
under the guise of procuring the old man
a fat political job, and fearing tbat his
plan would miscarry, concocted the
scheme of the robbery, knowing that little
resistance would be encountered.
Martin O'Connor, when Been last even
ing, seemed surprised that the police had
not evinced more interest in the case. â  He
slated that outside of tbe visit of Police
man Pyle no one connected with the po
lice force had called to gain any particu
lars of the assault or learn of his brother's
condition.* â¢
HIS FIEST WIFE.
Quackenbush '-aid to Have Used Strong
-Jj/'tWords .About Love and Money.
._ Mrs. Nancy Abbott-Quackenbush closed
her case in her suit against Thomas M.
Quackenbush in .Judge Seawell's court
yesterday, wherein .-he seeks to obtain
$500 a "month as permanent' support by
virtue of a contract marriage with the
aged capitalist," who is said to be worth
$600,000.
Mr. Foote, representing the defendant,
moved for a nonsuit, which was denied
by the court. .
Several witnesses were then examined
on behalf of the defense. The most im
portant witness for the defendant was I.
K. White, who â¢ testified . that while the
plaintiff and defendant were living to
gether ho used to visit at the bouse and
occasionally take a band at whist with
them. Quackenbush; he said, always re
ferred to Mrs. Abbott as Mrs. Abbott and
never as bis wife.. One night Quacken
bush was in a reminiscent, mood and re
minded him that he, the" witness, had
known his first wife. He said: "I shall
never marry again. Who would marry
me? Certainly no one, except for my
money." Mrs. Abbott was present at the
time, but made no remonstrance when
the remark was made. This occurred in
1892, three years after the alleged mar
riage.
The case will go on again . at 10 o'clock
this morning, and, as usual, Judge Sea
well's courtroom will be crowded with
gray-haired men and women who are in
terested in the love-making of this vener
able lady who confesses to 55 summers
and this old gentleman who "is rising 70."

CHASING A FLEET
CHINESE LUNATIC
He Escaped on the Front
From the Sheriff's
Van.
Scaled the New Ferry Depot
Wall and Hid Among the
Wharf Stringers.
The Aloha T_k s Out the Most V_lu.
able Cargo Ever Carried
by a Schooner.
Outside of the arrival of the Swanhilda
the most exciting incident on the water
front yesterday was the escape of a luna
tic from the Sheriff's van. Several un
fortunates were on their way to U-dab,
and when the door was opened one of
themâ a Chinese made a break for
liberty.
Immediately there was a .hue and cry,
and soon a hundred men and boys were
attempting to run the poor unfortunate
to earth. The maniac scaled the wall that
surrounds the new ferry depot, and half a
dozen athletes got over after him, while
half a thousand people who had congre
gated in the meantime yelled "Murder!"
"Thief 1" "Police!"
The Chinese hid himself among the
stringers under the wharf, but was finally
located by Ed Casey, a "runner" for the
New Western Hotel. Ed did not waste
any time, but at once climbed down the
pile and made the lunatic climb up in
front of him. He was then secured and
taken back to the van.
It appears . that. when the van reached
the Tiburon ferry the Deputy Sheriff
opened the door and started to take tbe
men out one hy one. While 'moving the
first man the Chinese made the break for
his liberty, * and of course the Deputy
Sheriff could not pursue him until he
had made everything safe in regard to the
others. â¢

also is out of danger, and his well-known
face will be -seen on the bridge when the
steamer leaves the dock. The Monowai
will be a day late in getting away, owing

A committee from the Journeymen
Stonecutters' | Association waited on the
Harbor Commissioners yesterday to urge
an eight-hour-a-day rule in the Colusa
quarry. It was pointed out to the mem
bers of the union that, the board could no
more control the time schedule of the
quarry than it could that of Carnegie's
Iron Works, that was making the steel for
the depot for the Risdon Iron Works of
this City. It was also pointed out to the
committee by President Colnon tnat the
use of Colusa stone meant a saying to the
State of $53,000, and not an extra expendi
ture of $7000. The committee acknowl
edged the mistake made in its statement
to that effect in writing.

GEORGE A. BRUSH DEAD.
The . Talented Grainer Passes Away
Suddenly While at Work, j
George A. Brush, a grainer, living at
1213 Twenty-sixth street, dropped dead
yesterday afternoon while at work at 1615
Fulton street. Brush was not an ordinary
painter. He was an artist in his line of
work. In 1876 he went to the Centennial
Exposition at Philadelphia, where he en
tered into competition with the best
grainers in the world. He proved to be of
superior talent to them all and won six
medals for the best graining in the world.
Mr. Brush was offered a number of posi
tions, several of which would have taken
him to Europe, but he refused all and
came back to California, bis native State,
with his honors. He was about 52 years
of age and leaves a widow and three
children.

Magistrat- Cook* Will Compare En
largements in the Cooney Case
on Saturday.
â¢ -
. The proceedings in the Cooney case
yesterday were confined to a sort of official
photographing of allthe documents that
have a bearing on the issues involved.
The decision of Magistrate Cook on
Monday to make expert comparisons on
his own account between tbe Crocker
blanks and the pencil deeds acknowledg
ments resulted in a change of front on the
part of the prosecution. It was on the
card that Expert Max Gumpel should be
called to point out the various defects in
the proofs of the notarial blanks printed
by H.S. Crocker Â«fc (Jo. on January 8, 1896.
in them he would declare that identical
typographical errors existed in the Cooney
acknowledgments on the pencil deeds.
This the fair people would contend was
evidence in itself that the certificates on
Mrs. Craven's documents were not printed
until January 8, 1896. although they bore
date of September 27, 1894. This in a
nutshell was the case which the Fair peo
ple styled the "mathematical demonstra
tion by which they would effect Cooney's
conviction."
Magistrate Cook has accordingly decided
to dismiss without bearing any experts
for the present. In conformity with his
announcement of Monday the Crocker
blanks ana the pencil deeds were photo
graphed for inspection and comparison
yesterday in the presence of attorneys for
the opposing interests. The camera was
set in the District Attorney's office in the
afternoon. The Fair interests nad Theo
dore Kytka there to supervise the proceed
ings in their interests. Cooney was repre
sented by Henry B. Smith of the Thor
gallery.
Two Photographs of the Crocker proofs
were first made. ..The certificates in the
pencil deeds were then reflected ou. the
sensitive glass, after which a finished copy
of the Crocker blanks was subjected to
similar treatment. [â â 
The six negatives will be made into
bromide enlargements* to-day and sub
mitted to the critical examination of Mag
istrate Cook. As District Attorney, Barnes
is ill . the case baa been continued until
Saturday next, when the comparisons will
be made in open court.
The civil case on the pencil deeds was
called in Judge Slack's court yesterday
and postponed for two weeks to allow the
jury lists to be completed.
RISING RIVERS.
The Sacramento Likely to Overflow Its
Banks Shortly.
â¢ Forecast Official W. H. Hammon has
issued the following bulletin regarding
the effects of the recent rainfall in the in
terior:
The rainfall of the past three days has
caused a rapid rise in the Sacramento River
At Redding the river Is 8.2 feet, a rise of 1 4
feet since last evening, It will reach its crest
of about 9 leet to-oav. At Red Bluff the stage
Is 13.7 feet, a fall of 2.3 feet since last night.
It Mill remain nearly stationary. At Colusa
the river is 23 9 ,eet. a rise of 1.7 feet since
last evening. It will reach its crest of about
24 5 feet to-night.
The Feather River at Oroville stands at 10
feet, a fall of 2 feet during the night. It will
continue to fall. At Marysville the stage is
15 feet, a rise of 1.4 feet duriug the night. It
has nearly reached Its crest.
The American River nt Folsom reached its
crest of 23 ieet during the night, and has now
fallen to 17 feet. It will continue to fall.
The river between Colusa and Sacramento
Will overflow durine the next two days. At
Sacramento the stage ls now 20.8 feet, a rise of
2.8 feet since yesterday. It will probably con
tinue to rise slowly until Thursday. But the
condition of the levees above the city will
probably not admit of the stage exceeding 22
or 23 feet.
