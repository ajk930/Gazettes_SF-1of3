liar ailment of the Czar has been no secret I
at the German court for some years, \
Since he was a lad emerging from boy- i
'â  hood it has been known that he was sub- !
. â¢ jeet to occasional fits. Tbey were rare, j
however, and were supposed, aftet the j
closest medical diagnosis, to be likely to
disappear as his physique strengthened.
The seizures, which in his early life took j
place about every four months, be- |
came more frequent and more distinctly I
epileptic, but they were never particularly j
â¢trying to his constitution until alter he j
became burdened with the work and j
troubles inseparable from the throne. !
During the last year he has had pro- I
nounced epileptic seizures about once a
month. These are not mere matters of

ence. The private correspondence which I

' "^become known.

up most of his imperial duties to the pro

There is better news about the condi
tion of the Cz >rowitch, the Czar's younger
j brother, the Grand Duke Michael, who
j though always in delicate health, is
I Decerning stronger. . .
J The consumptive tendency in the Rus
j sian imperial house has its parallel in the
Austrian. The political consequences
arising from the suicide of Crown Prince
Rudolph and the illness of tbe present
heir presumptive, the Archduke Franz
j Ferdinand, have been long under consid
; eration by Emperor Franz Jos ..
It is whispered in court and hi_:h
political quarters that the Emperor has
â  counseled his Ministers and political
â  leaders, botn Hungarian and Austrian, to
ascertain what suppoit they would give
to his grauitdauehter, the Archduchess
Elizabeth, and that he has found ready
support from Hungary, bit little or none
jin Austria. The Emperor, who has
readied his sixty-seventh year, has by nc
means abandoned his design to set aside
j the. Salic law in Austria. Meanwhile the
j health of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand
i is, according to newspaper reports, greatly
improve!, but the story which the Arch
i duke's supporters in Vienna have caused
â  to be circulate i that his diseased lungs
â¢ are healing and that he was able to go
. mountaineering recently in Persia is con
! s'. tiered doubtful. He looked doomed
about six months ago, emaciated and sub-
jeet to severe coughing, and only bis re
turn to active duty in the army and his
reappearance in Vienna society will con
vince the court and public of his restored
health.
There is the very best authority for the
statement that the draft of the reform
protocol as completed by the Embassa
dors at their conferences in Constantino
ple is drawn up on the assumption that
tbe Sultan will accept the proposals, but
there is no reference therein either di
rectly or indirectly to any possibility of a
resort to coercion on the part of the pow
ers to enforce them. Copies of the docu
ment reached the Foreign Offices in Vi
enna and Berlin on Saturday, and it is un
derstood ihat the text of the proposals
coincides with the desires expressed by
the Emperor and Count Goluchowsky, the
Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, at
their recent conference at Kiel. The op
position of the Kaiser to any further con
sideration of the question of coercion to
enforce the Turkish economics may have
the effect to neutralize the effects of the

WASHINGTON, jj). C, *I*_D. 7.-The
Spanish Legation has received with the
full abstract of the new reforms for the
islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, the pre
amble of Senor Canovas announcing tho
terms of the new decree. This preamble
expresses tho kindliest feelings toward
the Cuban people and declares that their
mother Spain is disposed, as she always
has been, to open her arms to them and
to extend amnesty for past offenses and
that the application of the reforms only
depends upon the insurgents. Minister
Dupuy de Lome discussed the scope of the
reforms .c-day with a representative of
the United Associated Presses, and said,
among other things: â %.-___
"The electoral reforms were not referred
to at length in the decree of the Ministry
for the reasons stated in the preamble of
Senor Canovas â that they will require the
action of the Cortes. lam informed, how
ever, that tbe Government contemplates
extending greatly the basis of the suffrage,
but they desire to do it in such a way as
to prevent undue influence being acquired
by the illiterate portion of the population.
Any educational qualification which may
be suggested by the Cubans and which
seem reasonable and proper will undoubt
edly be adopted by the Cortes.
"It is the purpose of the Government,"
said Senor Dupuy de Lome, "to show the
greatest generosity toward the insurgents
who lay down their arms. The reforms
cannot well be put into full effect until the
sovereignly of Spain is acknowledged in
all parts the island. The Government
will not remove its military activity in
any degree if the insurgents show any dis
position to continue the contest and fail
to appreciate the great concessions made
by the home Government.
"The tariff features of the new decree,"
Senor de Lome said, "mean a great deal
for the United States as well as for Cuba.
The first column of the new tariff sched
ules providing for revenue will contain
the greatest number of items, leaving the
list on which discriminations are made
in favor of Spain not exceeding 20 per
cent of the value of the imports, a com
paratively short one.. The duties levied
will be against all countries except Spain ;
and American manufactures and export
er . in view of their familiarity with the
Cuban trade and their nearness to the
island, are likely to appreciate the im
portance of these concessions. Tbe situa
tion wili be much more favorable to
American trade than under the reciproc
ity treaty of 1890."

CHICAGO. 111., Feb. 7.â Senator-elect
William E. Mason was' given a reception
last night by the Menoken Club, of which
he is a member. In the course of a
speech he said :
"I have disagreed with people some
times, but what I am going to say now is
a question of patriotism, not politics. I
was in the Supreme Court on Monday
when the Attorney-General sought to ad
vance the interests of the Cubans who
wanted to get out of their own country.
And if I get into any trouble it will be on
on this score.
"Have you read how the Spaniards are
killing women and children? Do you
know bow boys are shot every day? Tbefe
is no precedent for it in international law.
The strongest nation makes it. I tell you
I am sick and tired ot men and women
and children being murdered at our door

are not our brothers' keepers." I say we
are our brothers' keepers. And whether
I am blamed or praised I shall never be
silent until the belligerency of Cuba is
recognized."

MADRID, SrAiN. Feb. 7.â There is much
dissatisfaction expressed here over what
are alleged to be the excessive concessions
to the Cubans in the scheme of reforms
and it is thought that Cabinet changes
are likely to result. It is reported to-day
that Marquis Pidal or General Martinez
Campos will shortly replace Senor del
Castillo, tbe Prime Minister. The latter,
should he resign, would place himself at
tbe disposal of the crown, which would
probably advise him to support Marquis
Pidal.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 7.âMem
bers of the Senate and Assembly are in

appeared this morning in the Sunday
Leader of this city :
The Sacramento Grand Jury very wisely re
fused to have anything to do with the Legis
lative scandal. If they should investigate
that body they would have to indict the entire
outfit. Our County Prison is not big enough,
and then 120 members and 200 attaches

Legislature wash its own dirty linen.
They say that it is bad enough for legis

_ Indignation was ,so high that certain
legislators are now at work drafting a bill
to remove the State capital to Oakland.
They consider that they have been scurri
lously treated here by the existence of a
public sentiment which tolerates such un
founded editorials.
Several Senators delare that it is time to
make a law punishing such malicious and
unfounded libels and felonies. They say
that the publication was inspired by the
fact that the manager of the paper. Major
John N. Lsrain, held an eight dollar a
day job during the last session; that he
applied for a similar job at the beginning
of the present session and failed to get it.
The major is now persona non grata and

Senate hereafter.
SECRETARY SEARLES AT CANTON.
Mystery of the Visit of the Missing Sugar
Witness to the Home of
McKinley,
CHICAGO, 1n,., Feb. B.â A special to
the Tribune from Canton, Ohio, says:
John E. Searles, secretary of the sugar
trust, not only paid a visit to President
elect McKinley last Friday, and tried
to keep bis visit a secret, but he met
Chairman Hanna at the Valley Railway
station here and took him away to some
unKnown place for an hour's conference.
Mr. Searles' visit is causing more com
ment here the mo. _ its mystery becomes
known.
Tbe fact that he was under contempt at
Albany, N. V., for not appearing at the
Lexow Committee investigation of the
sugar trust on tbat day has caused all
sorts of speculation here over the subject
of his visit. - â {- rJ7 : .^i-_?iH-i .:'
Searles reached here from the East on a
Pennsylvania train and was driven di
rectly to the McKinley home. When he
was asked by a newspaper correspondent
what his me was he replied, "Jones."
The President-elect unwittingly gave it
all away, however. He was standing in
the hall when Mr. Searles came up the
steps, and the front door was open.
Nearly all arrivals are shown into the
library first, where they register and give
their cards to Secretary Cooper. Major
McKinley, however, recognized his visitor
by sight and did not wait for an introduc
tion. Whether be knew he was coming
cannot be ascertained.
Wnat Mr. Searles came to Canton for is
much of a mystery. The President-elect
has said that he does not know Mr. Searles 1
initials, and Mr. Searles' only explanation
of his visit, in reply to the usual question
put to callers at the McKinley house, was
that he came on a social call.
It is generally believed that the Presi
dent-elect knew he was entertaining the
secretary of the sugar trust, but that he
did not know he was in contempt of court
at the time. The most plausible explana
tion of the visit is that he was looking up
the question of tariff legislation, and
that Friday was considered most conven
ient for him, although it was embarrass
ing. to Mr. Lexow.
It is regarded here as doubtful whether
the matter is brought up to Albany on ac
count of the unjust criticiom to which it
might subject the President-elect.
PLEADS FOR HAWAII
Colonel Palmer Says the Natives Will
Never Consent to the Scheme of
Annexation.
WASHINGTON. D. CL; Feb. 7.âColo
nel Julius Palmer, private secretary of
ex-Queen Lihuokalani, has sent a com
munication to the Washington Times in
otate Senator Voorheis of Amador County,, Who Is an Active
Champion of Both Mine and Farmer.
which he extols in the highest manner '
the deposed ruler, and refers in the
course of his article to the question of the
annexation of Hawaii to tbis country.
Colonel Palmer says annexation is now
dead forever.
"For there is no escape," he writes,
"from one. of two positions. First, the
10,000 native voters now disfranchised by
a minority, that by official statistics in
1893 numbered 637. wili be allowed to re
sume suffrage. In this case they might
vote for one of their own chiefs of their
nation, but they will certainly vote
against annexing their country to any
other land.
"Second, the 10,000 native voters would
be still denied the right of expression of
their rights at the ballot-box. Tbev will
be held down by manacle and musket as
they are to-day. 1 have seen noble speci
mens of Hawaiian manhood laboring on
the roads carrying a ball and chain for no
other reason than their own loyalty to
Liliuokalani. If this course is pursued the
American people, under whatever party,
will never admit them to this great and
glorious Union, simply on the vote of
their oppressors, because these latter wish
to be relieved of the consequences of their
own rebellion and folly.''

Provision to Be Made for Restraining

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 7.â One of
the most pleasing features of the present
session of the Legislature, and one of its
unprecedented features as well, is the fact
that in matter* of legislation the farmers
and the miners are working together in
harmony. For years the Democratic party
has been promising with one face that it
would create such legislation as would en
able hydraulic miners to proceed with
their work, and with the other face it has
been promising the farmers that hydraulic
mining should not be resumed unless the
miners would go to the enormous expense
of buildine solid dams to keep the detritus
from being washed down into the rivers.
lt remained tor ihe brain and the genius
of ihe Republican party to evolve from
amidst the confusion of those two jarring
interests a plan which has now united the
interests of th* miner end the farmer.
That plan has been perfected and has as
sumed tangible shape in bills now before

mining legislation, so much so that unlike
many of his colleagues, he remains over
here on Sundays instead of going home to
restor to San Francisco to mingle among
the dizzy throng of pleasure-seekers. He
told a Call reporter to-day what the min
ers wanted; things which the agricultur
ists were willing to concede.
"Among these," said the Senator, "will
be some amended election laws adopted
by the Miners' Association. One is for
the purpose of practically abolishing dis
trict recorders. In the old day?, miners
in sparsely settled districts elected dis
trict recorders whose duty.it was to re
cord mining locations and were independ
ent of the County Recorders. As the
counties were organized the office of dis
trict mining recorder was done away with
in many instances. In some places, how
ever, they still exist. It is the opinion
of mining people that those things should
be turned over to the County Recorder.
If they still continue to keep district re
corders at long distances from the county
Beat their records must be sent to the
County Recorders and this involves un
necessary trouble and delay.
"Two of the most important bills before
the Legislature are those making avail
able the appropriation of $500,000 to build
restraining dams to bold back the detritus
and mining debris now lying in the can
yons and the bill known as the dredger
bill. Of this appropriation $250,000 has
been made from the United States treas
ury and $2j0,C00 from the State, the money
now being in the S ate treasury, Paving
been appropriated by the State some time
ago. The bill makes no new appropria
tion and simply prescribes the manner in
which the money may be uÂ«ed. I have
heard of no objection to the bill.
"The other bill appropriates $300,000 for
the purchase of the Bates dredger, etc.
It is designed in the interest of the
farmers along the banks of streams which
are now subject to overflow by reason of
the filling up of river beds and breaks in
the levees.
"These restraining dams will hold the
debris in the canyons that is already there
by reason oi mining or other causes. It is
a question whether hydraulic mining is
the cause of all this trouble. There has
been practically no hydraulic mining for
ten or twelve years, yet tbe debris accumu
lates in the river in about the same ratio
as it did before. Dams are necessary, be
cause the stuff that has been washed from
the hills comes down with every flood, and
it is, therefore, to the best interests of the
farmers to keep the debris out of tbe
American, Feather and Sacramento rivers.
These dams are to be constructed of stone
and cement, and, according to the reports
of the United States engineers, will last as
long as the mountains themselves. The
United States estimate of tbeir cost, if
they are built far enough up in the moun
tains, is $490,000. If it shall develop after
fair trial that the dams will catch and
hold ail the accumulations without injur
ing the lands adjoining, hydraulic mining
can be allowed to go on without complaint
from the farmers along the rivers.
"Tbe engineers are ready to proceed
with the work as soon as the season will
permit, for the work must be done in the
summer.
"The dredger will clean out the bars in
the rivers farther down, and will admit a
greater flood of water and a swifter cur
rent to run in the channels and scour out
the river beds. This will be effective in
preventing overflows and damage along
the river.
"The Federal Government does not re
claim lands nor provide against floods. It
takes care that there shall be water at the
lowest stages in navigable rivers, and its
duty ends there."

conferences, will be authorized in pre
senting the Sultan with the proposals of
the powers to inform the Turkish Sul
tan that the powers are prepared to en
force their acceptance and operation. In
regard to the extent or character or the
method of applying the coercion meas
ures, however, nothing has been decided
upon.
A pretty good idea of the situation may
be gathered from the utterance of the
Vossische Zeitung. in which an article on
the subject says:
"The greatest task of the powers will
only begin when the question is forced on
them; that a long time will yet elapse
before the protocol, after being approved
by each of the Governments concerned in
its formulation, goes through the formal
diplomatic course of presentation to the
Porte. This formality having been .one
through with the proposals will be pre
sented to the Sultan by his Ministers, and
they will be certain to be referred back to
the Embassadors, throughout a prolonged
process of examining of communications
extending until 1898, unless events in the
meantime shall scatter tbe Sultan's plans
and compel the powers to play each its
own game. The plain truth is that now,
as before the so-called concert, the powers
are insincere and do not intend to take
concerted action in the matter of coercion,
and the Sultan knows that they do not."

opened their campaign against him and
much on the old lines. He has been ac
cused of influencing the Kaiser in renew
ing the tension of relations with Prince
Bismarck, inciting him against Count
Herbert Bismarck and trying to divert the
imperial policy generally towards favoring
the Anglo-Austrian rather than the Rus
sian policy in the East.
The Bismarckian papers, however, at
tribute a great deal more power to Baron
Marschall than he possesses. His influ
ence with the Kaiser is simply that of a
State servant who suggests little, but can
be relied upon to follow out his instruc
tions. Last of ail would be dare to make
suggestions which could be suspected ol
personal bias. A gauge of his position
may be taken from the fact that at the
recent conference between the Kaiser,
Count Muravieff and Prince Hoheniohe
the Baron Marschall had no conspicuous
place.
The Hamburg Correspondent, Baron
Marschall's organ, explains the absence
of the foreign minister from the dinners
given in honor of Count Muravieff by the
Imperial Chancellor. Prince Hoheniohe,
and the Russian Embassador, by saying
that his digestive organ?, which have re
cently been affected, were too weak to
justify him in undergoing the ordeal of a
banquet. He made his appearance at
these reunions, however, after the dining
was over. His speaking form in the
Reichstag, when be defended his course in
the prosecution of Baron yon Luetzow
ana his fellow libelen, was amiable, but
his face showed some traces of illness at
the conclusion of the effort. The impres
sion left by Count Muravieff is distinctly
that of friendship toward Germany. He
seems to bave no authority from the Czar
to go further than a general expression of
friendliness.
The appointment of several socialists to
the Reichstag committee on the bill
amending the assurance law is satisfying
to the socialists and has the assent of tbe
majority In the House. Dr. yon Boet
ticher, the imperial Home Minster, is in
clined to consider favorably the conces
sions which the labor party want, includ
ing an increase of compensation and home
representation of workmen on the Board
of Trades committees.
Prince Bismarck's presence at the Ira
peror Wilhelm fetes is now not expected.
Many old associates who desire to see him
the prominent figure at the Berlin ce'e
bration and who have urged him to be
present get the same reply â that his health
is variable and that his undertaking tho
journey, with its attendant excitements,
depends upon the advice of Drs. Schwen
inger and Chrysander.
The Prince will not admit that the We
-1 del-Count Herbert- incident, when the
Kaiser insisted upon the withdraw
al of Count Herbert Bismarck's in
vitation to the marriage of the
! daughter of Minister yon Wedel to Lieu
tenent Yon Bismarck-Behlen, a cousin of
Count Herbert, being considered as a pre
requisite to bis own presence at the wed
ding, has anything to .do with bis reluc
tance to attend ceremonies which will
bring him into contact with the Kaiser.
The feeling shared by many leaders in the
aristocracy is distinctly with the Wedel
family, who were compelled to obey the
Kaiser's behests. It will be remembered
that a void was left in Berlin society last
season by a number of tbe highest and
princely families absenting themselves
rom Berlin as a demonstration against
the Kaiser's ill-judged interference with
the private affairs of several high placed
personages. A similar movement again
seems imminent. If the Wedel affair had
occurred two months earlier there would
have been noticeable gaps in Berlin soci
ety tbis season.
The court ball which was held on
Wednesday was a perfect crush, 2000
guests being in attendance. The Empress
wore a satin gown, embroidered with gold
and silver arabesques and flowers fes
tooned over the bodice and skirt, a diadem
of brilliants and a collar of emeralds.
Mrs. Uhl, wife of the United States Em
bassador, wore a white brocade robe
trimmed with embroidered gold and dia
mond arabesques and real flowers.
The electoral campaign in Austria is
proving the most interesting and keenly
fought that the country has known. The
new German Popular party, which has
the warmest sympathies of kindr.d in
Germany, is actively working in Austria
proper, Bohemia, Styria and Silesia.
They hope to gain some thirty seats,
chiefly from their opponents, th. Clerical-
Anti-Semitic parties. Their programme
proposes the formation of a great German
party in Austria on the single basis of
nationality, tbe union of the middle classes
with a view toward gradual social reforms
free from socialistic theories, but still op
posed to the crowing preponderance of
capitalism.
Perhaps the most interesting of the
many manifestoes covering the walls in
all the _?*_.ai towns is that of the Austrian
Episcopate, signed by five cardinals, four
archbishops and twenty-six bishops. It
advises voters to vote for men who will
pledge themselves to defend the princi
ples and interests of the church, notably
that of religious education against the
attacks of the anti-religious.
The new category of deputies to be
elected for the first time by universal suf
frage and who will number seventy-three
out of 428 members of the Reichsrath
will, according to all appearances, be
composed of anti-Semites and Socialists.
The speech of Sir Michael Hicks- Beach,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Brit
ish House ol Commons, on the position
of Great Britain in Egypt, the renewal of
the troubles in Crete and the relapse of
the Paris Bourse caused a marked de
pression on the Bourse yesterday. Fon
tigues lost from % to I*., per cent, Aus
trian credits 2}i and bank shares 1 per
cent.
Ou Friday the executive committee of
the trades guilds held a meeting at which
was discussed a motion supported by the
Socialists in favor of admitting domestic
servants and prisoners working in the
jails to the benefits of the law regarding
the guilds. After a somewhat warm de
bate the motion was rejected. The com
mittee subsequently agreed to admit
smiths, brewers and a number of other
trades. _^^_^_^^_^_
WARSHIPS IA A HVHUICAJIE.
Anxiety for the t quad ron hat Left
Hampton Roads 'i hursday.
CHARLESTON, S. C. Feb. 7.â The ex
pected warships did not arrive to-day.
The water front was lined with anxious
people all day, but no gunboat came over
the horizon line.
The Clyde liner Commanche, some
hours overdue, came in to-night from
New York, and had not spoken the war
ships at Hampton Roads Thursday morn
ing. Captain Pennington told of a severe
storm encountered off the capes on Satur
day, and from bis description of it tne
warships must have caught it. The ships
that left Hampton Roads on Thursday
were the cruiser N w York, the battle
ship Maine, tbe cruiser Minneapolis and
the monitor Amphitrite. This last-named
vessel is built with a very low fr. eboard,
and it is thought would have an extreme
ly rough time in a storm.
At a late hour to-night the warships bad
not been reported, but it is confidently ex
pected they will show up in the morning.
PECULIARLY PATHETIC 'CASE.
Paralyzed Veteran Secures a Pension
and the Aews Kills Dim.
HUBBELL, Nebb., Feb. 7.â A peculiar
and pathetic case, illustrating the futility
of belated justice, occurred here to-day.
Lewis Reiser, an old soldier, had been for
tbe past fifteen years a paralytic, his sole
attendant being his aged wi c, whose care
and fidelity were unsurpassed. Some
time ago he applied for a pension, Con
gressman Hainer visited Mr. Kai-erand
indorsed bis application. Yesterday he
wired the veteran that his bill allowing
him $72 a month had passed the Senate
and only awaited the signature of the
Pre ident. The news was gratifying, but
the shock was too much. Mr. Kaiser died
at 6 o'clock this morning and his loyal
wife suddenly finds her years of unswerv
ing duty and devotion fittingly rewarded.
Fraternal Aid Association,
WICHITA, Ka___, Feb. 7.â The Cali
fornia delegation to the National Council
of tbe Fraternal Aid Association, which
meets in this city Tuesday, arrived to
night. It is composed of the following:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1897.
ON THE NEEDS
OF THE COUNTRY
Long of Massachusetts Sets
Forth S3me Interesting
Views.
Tariff Schedules Shou'd Be So
Adjusted as to Provide Suf
ficient Revenue.
_________
H?arli'y in F .vor of an Arbitration
Treaty With Englani and Other
Foreign P. wers-
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. B.â The World
this morning prints the following as the
views of ex-Governor John D. Long of
Massachusetts on the problems confront
ing the incoming administration, as given
to a correspondent of that paper. In giv
ing his opinions ex-Governor Long reiter
ates that no definite tender of the Secreta
ryship of the Navy has been made to him,
although he has been invited to take a
place in the new Cabinet.
Ex-Governor Long declined to discuss
financial questions as beyond his pro
vince, and continued:
"I believe that the tariff schedules can
be so adjusted by the incoming Congress
that the present very unfortunate condi
tion of our inadequate revenue can be
rectified and adequate receipts secured.
The revision can be so arranged as not to
oppress our foreign trade or diminish cus
tom revenues. I see no reason why, with
ample revenue, the treasury gold balance
should not take care of itself.
"As to the Cuban question, the Presi
dent and Congress are leaving it just
where it ought to stand. What may be
the effect of any unexpected develop
ments in Cuba no one can now predict,
but whatever at any time may be the situ
ation, then will be the time to meet it with
wisdom and regard for international obli
gations. I should deplore any condition
tbat would necessarily invite war, a threat
of war, or anything to impair the present
promise of better times and era of peace.
"I am most heartily in favor of an arbi
tration treaty with England or any other
power. * * * lt is a step and a very
great one in the advance of human civili
zation.
"Whether the free-silver movement is
dead or not depends upon many consider
ations. I regarded it as a manifestation of
certain conditions that found expression
in that way and which might have been
expressed in another manner. An era oi
prosperity or an international agreement
will settle it. If the good times I confi
dently expect progress we will hear noth
ing of free silver throughout the country.
"Of course tbe Republican party should
welcome the co-operation of the sound
money Democrats; that is only Baying
that tbe Republican party should wel
come the co-operation of good citizens.
It ought to welcome not only sound
money Democrats, but all Democrats who
will co-operate with it in the cause of good
government, good finance and good times.
"I do not see why any proper demands
in reference to trusts or any other form of
the consolidations of capital or labor
should not be forced. It depends on
whether they are so drawn as to com
mand public sentiment and have its back
ing. Next comes the question of the
proper regulation of the forces and inter
ests existing at any particular time. These
forces and interests, at bottom, are all in
harmony, yet there is often a seeming
conflict.
"After all, this conflict is only the com
petition and manifestation of energies
which make up life and which work out
ultimate. progress and common welfare
and cause each century to advance on its
predecessors."
PEOPLE'S PARTY POLICY.
Leaders Differ on the Question of Per
petuating the Late Alliance With
the Democracy,
BOSTON, Maps., Feb. 7.â At a meeting
of the state Central Committee of the
People's Party of Massachusetts in Com
mercial Hall Saturday, officers were
| elected with George F. Washburn as
1 chairman. A resolution was adopted "af
firming the National platform adopted at
St. Louis and declining to recognize any
other authority as a ruide to our political
welfare." The following letter was given
out by Chairman Washburn:
Hon. J. A. Edrniston, Secretary National Com
mittee People's Party, Lincoln, Web.â Dear
Sir: I congratulate you on your very able
letter. It is plausible and will do credit to any
lawyer with a witness, but you hav9 not made
plain why two parties should force one Issue,
nor have you reasoned away the actual dan
gers that threaten the life of our party and
reform press. Ido not favor the abandonment
of silver or any change in the platform, and
my apn' al must not be construed to mean
that. You do not discriminate between planks
and issues. Our platform contains many
planks, but the platform was fought on one is
sue, though we did not abandon the other
planks. We made a subordinate plank the
issue, trusting to win by an alliance. By the
order of the platform scientific money comes
first. â -:',
We forced the Democrats to champion sil
ver, but we stand reedy to defend it when
necessary. I have received hundreds of let
ters coming from nearly every State in the
Union, representing every faction of the party
and Including nearly every leader, and the
unanimous sentiment sustains my appeal.
Your letter bears the distinction of being the
only one opposed to silver that the Rocky
Mountain News has so far received.
While I do not ascribe to you the intention,
nevertheless your plan of having an identical
issue with the Democrats would result in a
union of the Populist lamb and th â  Tammany
tiger, but with the former inside the latter.
While it was possible to unite during a fight
ing campaign, it is not wise to continue the
union during the educational one. Your plan
would force us to follow the Democrats under
their banner when we should lead them under
our own. Your plan would humiliate our
brave people, whiie mine would inspire and
ennoble them.
You favor retaining a subordinate plank as
the issue. I favor mailing the main one, which
includes yours, the Issue. You favor a plan
that would factionize the party anddivide the
W.st and Soutb. I favor a plan that would
unite all factions and lead to victory. You
favor a plan that would suppress our mam
pia ks. 1 favor a plan that would open them
to discussion when the people want to talk
about them. You favor a plan that would add
thousands of adherents to another part..- 1
favor one that would add thousands of adhe
rents to our own.
Fusion for a campaign may be politics, but
permanent fusion on identical issues means
absorption and disintegration for our party.
Disintegration from the same cause killed the
Greenback party. Why should we Invite a
similar fate? *â¢
You favor an issue that may be abandoned
by the Democrats through gsome form o;
compromise. I favor a plan that cannot be
affect d by these changes. You favor a plan
that would enable the Democrats to absorb
Populists and pave the way for a union of the
two wings of Democracy, leaving the future ol
reform but a forlorn hope. l favor a plan that
would force the. Democrats to our positions
rather than to recede from theirs. You favor
a plan that would wreck and ruin the reform
papers of the land. I favor a dan that would
preserve and prosper them.
Should other questions absorb the attention
of the people, or should UM Republicans se
cure an international agreement, it would
leave the silver forces strand.-d without any
(MM, and afford them an excuse for backslid
ing. The issues I fay >r are the ones that will
command th . attention of the people during
the next four years. "Why attempt to force
one issue when the people will discuss the
others? This move on the part of the Popu
lists will place our party at the head of the
column of reform, with the Democrats pro
tecting the rear. Our defense of the green
backs will add thousands of voters to our
ranks.
The radicals of to-day are the conservatives
of to-morrow. if we educate the people be
tween elections on scientific money, metal
money will become the conservative measure
of tne future, until the invariable paper dollar
shall also take its turn and become the money
of all nations. The next battle may be fought
on scientific versus metal money. .
There will be an informal, unofficial confer
ence in Memphis, Term., on February 22. It
will be attended by leaders of our party from
every section of the country. I believe the res
olutions adopted at that time will be so em
phatic in favor of independent action as to
lead to official indorsement by our National
Committee. In favoring a separate conference
you have unwisely added to the confusion.
Yours fraternally, *
George F. Washburn.
HASyA'S St..\A l olilAL BOOM.
Senator Perkins Says Washington Senti-
ment Strongly Favor* Htm.
CANTON, Ohio. Feb. 7.â Major McKin
ley attended church this morning. Sena
tor Perkins, secretary of the National
Committee, who has charge of the perma
nent headquarters in Washington, arrived
in Canton to-night. He came by way of
Cleveland, where he had a long interview
with Mr. Hanna about the work and plans
of the committee. Mr. Perkins said:
"The sentiment in favor of the appoint
ment of Mr. Hanna to the Senate of the
United States is very strong in Washing
ton and seems to be national in scope, for
0 is exppressed and echoed daily by pub
lications from all parts of the country.
The Republicans who come here think
Mr. Hanna's services to the country and
to the party, which were freely given and
without thought of reward, are deserving
of substantial recognition, and tbat the
people of Ohio could hardly do less than
to send him to the Senate."
Mr. Hanna's friends in Cleveland are
pretty open in the assertion that he will
not accept a Cabinet portfolio. It devel
ops here from talks with prominent men
who have visited Major McKinley re
cently that he does not expect to make
any appointments to the diplomatic and
consular service until the extra session is
well under way. His notion is that the
business of the country ought to be at
tended to before the work of apportioning
the patronage is taken up.
SVUTH DAKOTA'S DEADLOCK
May Lead to the Flection of a Bepubli-
can S, u.i tor.
PIERRE, S. Dak., Feb. 7.-Judge John
son, the member of the Democratic
National Committee, who has been sent
on from Washington to look after the
Senatorial difficulty, has arrived. He is
reported to have said that be is not sent
and does not intend to interfere or at
tempt to interfere as between the different
free silver candidates. He simply comes
to examine and report upon the situation.
There is no doubt there is great uneasi
ness at Washington lest a Republican be
elected. Mr. Johnson's mission is to try
to unite the different factions upon some
one candidate who is a thorough ex
ponent of free silver, be he Populist or
Democrat.
WENT DOWN A TRESTLE.
An Excursion Train on the Cumberland
and Pennsylvania Road Wrecked
by an Ice Gorge.
CUMBERLAND, Md., Feb. 7.â An ex
cursion train on the Cumberland and
Pennsylvania Railroad, a brancn feeder of
the Baltimore and Ohio, went down a
trestle at Franklin Mine, Md., at mid
night last night. There were fifteen pas
sengers on board.
John Howard, fireman of the train,
jumped from the engine as it was topplin_
over and received injuries from which he
died to-day. Engineer Ross was also fa
tally injured.
The accident was caused by the center
props of the trestle being knocked down
and carried away by an ice gorge.
UAiox pacific affaius.
Special Master Appointed for the United
â  Stites Circuit Court.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 7.â Judge San
born of the United States Circuit Court,
sitting in chambers, yesterday signed an
order appointing William D. Cornish of St.
Paul, Minn., special master for the court,
to receive all intervening petition? that
may be filed in the case of the United
Siates against the Union Pacific Railroad.
The master is also authorized to examine
and report upon all accounts submitted by
the receivers of the same railway com
pany. Â«
The petition of the city of Cheyenne,
asking for an extension for two years of its
contract with the Union Pacific, was con
sidered and an order entered granting the
same. It appears that several years ago
the city of Cheyenne, being on the point
vi building water works, made a contract
with the Union Pacific lor a low rate of
freight on all material to be used in the
work of construction, in return for whicn
tbe city agreed to build a viaduct over the
tracks of the company. The contract ex
pired some weeks ago, but the water works
are not finished, hence a renewal of the
contract was rendered necessary.

CLOSING DAYS OF
THIS CONGRESS
Much Important Work in
the Hands of the
Senate.
Indications That the Arbitration
Treaty Will Be Talked
To Death.
W bile the Nicaragua Canal Bill and
Cameron Reso ntioas Are to
Be Sidetracked.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 7.â Three
weeks and three working days only re
main of this Congress, and there are
marked evidences on the part of the Sen
ate to catch up with some of the work that
has been neglected. Appropriation bills
cause little uneasiness, for tbey can be
speedily passed, and, besides, no great
harm would follow, in view of the extra
session which is to be called lor March 15,
if some of these bills fail to become
laws before the 4ih of March.
The arbitration treaty with ; Great
Britain will be taken up to-morrow, Sher
man having given notice to that effect.
The chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee is very sanguine, and expects
to see the treaty promptly ratified. He
will ask the Senate to remain in secret
session bo that tbey may be able to reach
a vote on it by Tuesday if possible.
Sherman's sanguine views are not
shared by other Senators, who are prob
ably better informed as to the feeling of
the Senate on the matter.
Hale fears that 'he opponents of tbe
treaty may be able to defeat it. Other
Senators anticipate an organized effort to
start an interminable debate on the treaty,
with the view of holding it up until after
March 4. It is well known that several
Senators have prepared elaborate speeches
on the subject, and the men who are op
posed to the treaty are those who will de
bate it most.
When the treaty is called up to-morrow
a motion will be made to have the discus
sion proceed with open doors. It is doubt
ful if this will prevail, but a very consid
erable vote will favor it.
As a result of a conference of the Repub
lican and Democratic steering commit
tees tbe Nicaragua bill, owing to the fili
bustering against it, will be dropped
to-morrow and the bankruptcy bill substi
tuted in its place as the regular order.
This action is not calculated to make
Morgan, who has been the special cham
pion of the Nicaraguau bill, any less vig
orous in his opposition to the arbitration
treaty, which he regards as being mixed
up with the Nicaragua question.
The Cameron resolutions, recognizing
the independence of the republic of Cuba,
which were supposed to have disappeared,
is a possible disturbing influence. They
are to be called up again by Morgan, but
the bankruptcy bill will probably be given
the right of way after tbe arbitration
treaty has consumed a couple of days.
Tba bill reported to the Senate differs
materially from the bill whicn passed the
House. Many speeches have been made
on it in the Senate.. .... ,
Â©The House bill provides merely for
voluntary bankruptcy and is drawn solely
in tbe interest of the creditor class. The
majority report to the Senate provides for
voluntary bankiuptcy except in cases of
fraud. The text of the proposed measure,
which made sixty-four pases when passed
by the House, has been condensed by the
Senate to eighteen pages. Hoar has made
-i minority report in favor of the House
measure, and Nelson, representing some
of the Western ideas, has prepared a sub
stitute for sixteen of the sections of the
bill reported by Teller on behalf of the
minority of the committee.
Following the bankruptcy bill tbe Sen
ate may take up the Hawaiian cable
measure, providing for the payment of
$160,000 a year for twenty years to a com
pany building and maintaining a cab c
be ween the United States and Honolu v
and between Honolulu and Japan. There
is no prospect, however, of . this measure
becoming a law during this Congress.
On Wednesday next both Houses of
Congress will go through the form of
counting and declaring the vote which
will make Mr. McKinley the next Presi
dent of the United States and Mr. Hobart
Vice-President and President of the Sen
ate.
Statements as to probable protests and
interruptions are regarded as most un
likely of development.
Pursuant to the law of 1887 the Senate
and House of Representatives will meet
in joint convention in the Hall of Repre
sentatives at 1 p. M. and consider a form
of proceedings prescribed by that law, the
votes of the several States will be opened,
tbe vote . will be counted and the result
will be declared by the Vice-President of
the United Slates. This declaration will
be ihe only official not fication which Mr.
McKinley and Mr. Hobart will receive of
the high offices conferred upon them.
They will take official cognizance of the
facts without requiring a "communica
tion in writing."
TO REDUCE _P-S.A__iO-.V ..GEACIBS.
A'umber to Be Limited to Sine Instead of
Eighteen.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 7.â The
President has signed, on the recommenda
tion of Secretary of the Interior Francis,
an important order reducing the number
of pension agencies in the United States
from eighteen to nine. Th* object of the
order ijT.o eSect a very large saving to the
Government without inconveniencing the
pensioners. This demonstrates that by
this redaction of the pension agencies the
cost of disbursing pensions can b. re
duced, by at least $150,000 per annum.
Under the consolidation tbe pensioners
heretofore paid at Dcs Moines and To
p>ka are to be paid from i St. Louis, where
a new agency i. established.
A new agency is established at St. .Louis
because of the better mail facilities than
at Dcs Moines or Topeka and for the
further reasons that there isa Govern
ment building at St. Louis which can be
occupied without cost to the Government.
- The following are the nine agencies and
the number of pensioners paid thereat
under the new order: Boston, 94 357;

ISJCBIES OF .HE BBOOKLYX.
A Broken Propeller in Addition to Her
Dam-tried Bottom.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Feb. 7.â The
damaged cruiser Brooklyn was brought
from Marcus Hook to League Island Navy
Yard this afternoon. The trip was not
made under the Brooklyn's own steam,
but she was towed by four tugs, and one
of the most experienced pilots on the
river was in cnarge of the cruiser. To
night the vessel is anc: <red in the Dela
ware River off Leairue Inland and will
probably be put in the dry dock there to
undergo repairs on Tuesday. It was dis
covered by a diver that in addition to
damaging her bottom when she struck, a
piece a foot-long and six inches wide was
broken off one of the blades of the pro
peller on the port side.
Ex-Priest Slattery Mobbed.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., Feb. 7â When
ex- Priest Joseph Slattery concluded his
lecture at Industrial Art Hall tbis even
ing and appeared at the door to take his
carriage to his botel a mob gathered. Two
policemen got in the carriage with Slat
tery and his wife and drove off. The
crowd at the hall was he'd in check hy
the police, but parties of men and boys
armed with stones an i brick s were lying
in wait in the alleys along Broad stree'.
As tbe carriage passed these points vol
leys of stones greeted it. The windows
were smashed. Policeman Clements was
cut over the right eye, Policeman Doris'

MAXIM'S .NEW GUN.
New Machine of Destruction Fires Four
I i in Â«- _ in Three Seconds.
A new machine gun, which it is confi
dently expected, will cause more damage
to life and property than any other quick
firing piece hitherto known to science,
was introduced to public notice, and its
construction and capabilities explained
by Mr. Hiram S. Maxim, in a lecture at
tbe Royal United Service Institution yes
terday. A sample of the gun was on view
in an anteroom <Jf the -Buita-io**.
. It was pointed out that this was .the first
fully automatic ' gun above 1 1-2
inches which had been an unqualified
success. With this new terror a gunner
who knows bis business can deal out four
nine-pound shots in a shade under three
seconds without even so much as taking
his eye off the object to be attended to or
his finger off the trigger. The danger of
death to the gunner by the explosion of a
cartridge while the breech is open has
been rendered impossible by the applica
tion of a simple device which prevents the
gun being opened until the charge has
been fired.
This may seem a slight matter, but Mr.
Maxim holds that nowadays, when the
full mental pressure of the scientist is
being brought to bear on the invention of
new machines for the rapid annihilation
of an enemy, the risk of accident to those
wno work the complicated mechanism is
found to increase. Hence the emphasis
laid by the lecturer upon this feature of
the new gun. â London Mail.

TO CONTROL THE
WORLD'S ALCOHOL
-
Ambit Plans of the
American Spirits
Company.
President Rice Tells How the
Revenue Requirements
Handicap Trade.
If the F.uid Is Sent Abroad in Tank
Steamers Foreign M rkets Can
B> Competed With.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. The Herald
this morning says: If the ambitious
plans of S. M. Ri. c are realized, the
American Spirits Manufacturing Com
pany, of which he . is president, .vill
soon lo<k horns with the alcohol pro
ducers of Europe in an effort to control
the alcohol markets of the world. Mr.
Rice arrived from â¢ New York yesterday
and was in conf rence all day with Levy
Mayer. Angelo Myers of Philadelphia,
principal distiller for the company, came
on fiom Phiadelphia to attend the confer
ence.
President Rice is after the alcohol pro
ducers of Germany, Hungary and Rou
mania. For years American manufac
turers of spirits have been unable to com
pete with them in markets consuming
more than 100,000,000 gallons of spirits,
owing to the technical requirements of the
United States revenue laws. The mere
sub Mention of tank cars for barrels in
shipping spirits to the seabord will en
able American distillers to compete in
foreign markets, and incidentally furnish
an outlet for nearly 20,000,000 bushels of
corn every year.
It has been rstimated that the removal
of that volume of grain trom a surplus
that is steadily increasing would raise tbe
price of core 4or 5 cents a bushel. It is
now selling at prices ranging from Bto 12
cents a bushel on the farm.
"All we ask," said Colonel Rice yester
day afternoon, "is a chance to forward
alcohol to the seaboard in tankcars.
There it. will be transferred to tank steam
ers, just as petroleum is now handled.
The present revenue laws require all dis
tillers to immediately put alcohol in bar
rels and store the product in Government
warehouses. The single item of cooperage
makes it impossible for American distillers
to compete in the European market,
at present is supplying the world. The
selling price of a barrel of alcohol to-day is
about $5 43, of which $4 represents the
value of the alcohol and $1 45 for the bar
rel. It is obvious that we cannot hope to
get control of freign markets as long as
we are forced to pay $1 45 for every pack
age containing goods valued at $4.
"The plan we are working on now,"
Colonel Rice continued, "is to have the
revenue laws so modified that distillers
would be allowed to store alcohol in huge
tanks under Government control, draw
the spirits out into tank cars under Gov
ernment supervision and forward the
goods in bond in these cars to the sea
board. - That would enable us to entirely
eliminate an enormous expenditure fo<
barrels and the freight thereon, and im
mediately put us on a basis where compe
tition with European producers would be
possible.
"The distillers of Germany, Hungary
and Roumania control, in addition to
their own markets, the other markets of
Europe and those of Japan, China and
the African coast, where vast quantities
are used. To open such an enormous con
sumption to American producers would
be of great benefit to the farming ele
ment." '

Champion Corbett May Train at the
Famous "Sandy" Bowers
Mansion.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 7.â This being
Sunday, all was quiet in Carson. Most of
the members of the Legislature spent the
day with friends, and there was a lull in
authentic prize-ring gossip.
The Western Union is about to string
extra wires from Eeno to Carson. The
business is already rapidly increasing and
the two wires out of Carson are taxed to
handle the work. Newspapers all over
the United States continue to encage
quarters for their men. The London Tele
graph will nave a personal lepresentative
and an artist here. All the photograph
_ ers, typewriters and shorthand writers in
the city are being engaged at their own
prices and kept busily at work.
Stuart expected to arrive to-morrow, but
it is not believed that he can make con
nections before Tuesday, although he may
reach the city at 4 to-morrow afternoon.
He telegraphs Wbeelock several times a
day, and Wheelock cannot walk along the
street from the telegraph office without
being pounced upon by 100 people wild
for news.
The contest between Carson and Reno
seems about over, as the indications are
that it has already been settled by the
leaders in favor of Carson.
Edward Cooke, the agent for Corbett,
returned this morning from Walleys
â  Springs, and said he was well pleased
with that place as a site for training quar
ters, but he wanted a handball court. He
will go to-morrow to Bowers' Mansion in
Washoe County, to see what advantages
â it offers. It is the famous house of stone,
built years ago by "Sandy" Bowers at an
expense of $600,000, in the flush days of
' the South End. He cleared $1,000,000 in a
few months on a deal in Comstock stock,
and built bis mansion at the foot of a
â¢ rugped mountain, where a hot spring
" bubbled forth.
The- hinges on the doors cost $100 apiece,
' and the furnishines all came from Europe.
Tne place was once famous for its grand
entertainments and at least $100,000 worth
of champagne was disposed of at those
big suppers of "Sandy" Bowers' givtn to
the elite of Nevada the year his wife (now
telling fortunes for a livelihood) was pre
â¢ sented to the Queen of England. There is
a bowling alley connected with the nlace
and this, Cooke believes, will be just the
' spot for a handball court for Corbett to
practice m, while the big stone edifice j
â  will house 100 people.
"FITZ" JA FIAE FETTLE.
Ihe Antipodean Tells What He Expect*
to Do to Corbett.
. CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 7.â A special to
the Tribune from New York says: With
in a week, probably, or next Wednesday
.Fitzsimmons will depart for Nevada to
make final preparations for meeting James
J. Corbett on March 17, in what, ';" it is
universally admitted, will be the greatest
pugilistic event in the annals of fistiana.
Corbett has been training assiduously
for tbis fight for some months, until at
the present moment be is in condition to
do battle. Fitzsimmons, on the other
hand, started in to take exercise and that
of a light character, only ten days ago.
Tbis delay in beginning heavy training is
in stronely- marked contrast to Fitzsim
mons' behavior on all former occasions, as
it- has been customary with him, when
matched for a 'fight, to move with his
family and belongings to some quiet
place, where he systematically carried out
a prescribed system of training some
months before the event. His failure to
act according to his time-honored custom
in this the most important battle of his
career has given rise to much speculation
among the sporting fraternity.
â â¢ Corbett's friends are loud in proclaim
ing their doubts of the antipodean's sin
. cerity. To these cynics it will be more or
less gratifying to learn that, first of all,
Fitzsimmons' prime condition releases
" hm from a long siege of heavy training,
and secondly, that bis delayed departure
' for Nevada is due entirely to the serious
â illness of a member of bis family, a crisis
lor better or for worse having been daily
expected.
Could these same critics see Fitsim
-_pons, well muffled up and wearing
â  sweater and cap, trudging along in the
. morning to and around Central Park on
k his twelve-mile jaunt and returning to his
_6tel dripping with perspiration, tbey
would think differently. And, perhaps,
could these alarmists follow Fitz to his
room in the Bartholdi Hotel and see him
strip for his exercise with the dumbbells
and wrist machine, and note his condi
â¢ tion, they would hesitate long before
again commenting unfavorably on the
Cornish man.
; Bob Fitzsimmons is in superb condition
for this fight, and he looks it. His flesh is
firm and smooth, bis muscles hard but
pliable, while his massive chest and back
denote great strength and power. His
face and eyes show that he is not dissi
pated. In fact, he could not possibly be
in any better physical condition than he
is at present, and he knows it.
While he was being rubbed with alcohol
after his bath to-day, Fitzsimmons said:
"So the latest talk is that I am not
training properly? Well, I suppose that
Corbeti's friends will want me to follow
their instructions. It should be just their
.'pie if I don't get right and my loss. Such
kickers and cranks I never beard of. Why
tbey will expect me to tight to their direc
tions soon. I hay. beard so much talk
lately about what I am doing and what
Corbett is going to do to me on March 17
that I often wonder where the tales come
from. Well, I don't care what people
..think about my training. lam going to
(do the lighting and know just how I
should.be. 1 feel great and am fit to enter
.the ring now. My wind is good and
strong, and the only thing necessary for
me iB to become acclimated to tbe high
altitude of Nevada. I will have four long
weeks to do this before the fight." '--Â»
"How do you propose to fight Corbett?"
â¢'I don't know; but be does, or rather
pays he does. I have seen where Corbett
says lam a tricky fighter. Perhaps I am,
but the best trick 1 know is landing my
fists on the jaw just hard enoueh to knock
men out, and I hope to show Mr. Corbett
how this little affair is accomplished. It
is nonsensical for him to talk about tricks.
What fighter does he know whom I have
tricked unless, as 1 say, be calls the knock
out a trick?"
"Corbett says that yon are rehearsing
several new blows for this fight. Is
that so?"
"Well, he must be a mind-reader.
Where does he get his information?
New blows for him? Not on his life.
Any of the other ones will suit me, and if
1 get my right or left to any part of bis
pompadour head he will hit the floor, and
hard. I don't think that he will get up,
either."
"Have you any idea* formed on the way
you shall fight Corbett?"
"No, I have not, and if I had I
would not tell. It is 'just this way
with me: 1 might make up my mind to
do a certain thing in a fight, when a blow
from my opponent, or even a feint, would
compel me to change my tactics. When I
meet Corbett my fighting will be governed
entirely by his movements. I may see
my opportunity in the first round, and,
then, it may take me several to find his
weakness. You may depend, however,
that I will find his weak points. I am
just as confident as ever that I will win."
"How many rounds will the fight last ?"
"How can I possibly tell you? That's
the xind of bluster Corbett indulges in,"
said Fitzsimmons with a disdainful look.
: Tben brightening up and clasping his
| hands he said: !Â§_*Â§Â§
"So Corbett is going to have a doctor in
his camp, hey? Well, is not that a bit
surprising to his friends? Now, there is
just one thing that I am going to insist
upon before we fight, and that is to have
my physician examine Corbett. I have
my own ideas why this should be done.
I know that this new Nevada law calls for <
a medical examination, but 1 want my
own physician to examine Corbett before
we fight. I bave had one peculiar experi
ence and 1 don't propose to have another
if I can help it."
COBB Ell GTOHS UA'EASY.
Fears That Fitzsimmons Ie Inviting
Official Interference.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. The re
port telegraphed from New York two or
turee days ago that Fitzsimmons had torn
up tbe old articles of agreement and signed
a new one, in which provision is made for
a side bet of $5000 between the two big
men, gave Corbett some uneasiness. Com
menting on the subject to-day he said:
"What has Fitzsimmons got to do with
these articles, anyway? Now, I am not
saying a word about any side bet. 1 don't
say there is one or there is not one. But
Fitzsimmons has no articles to tear up,
and don't you forget it. This bluff of
Fitzsimmons' is just a red flag to the offi
cers of tne law, that's all. Why, we are
both under indictment there for arrang
ing a prize-fight in the State of New York;
and won't this talK of his be just a dead
tip to the officers that we had arranged a
fight?"
NEW BASEBALL RULES.
Umpire to Be Absolute Master of the
Field From Beginning to End
of the Game.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 7.â The
recommendations of the committee to
prepare new playing rules for the Na
tional League and American Association
of Professional Baseball Clubs has been
given out for* publication.' * Under the
caption, "The Umpire," the insertion of a
note calling attention to "advice to um
pires" printed in the addenda to the play
ing rules is recommended. It is as fol
lows:
You are the. absolute master of the field
from the beginning to the termination of the
game. You are by these rules given full au
thority to order any player, captain or man
ager, to do or omit to do an. act which you
may deem necessary to maintain your dignity
and compel respect from players and specta
tors.
No cnanges are recommended in the
rules governing the playing of the game
proper, the changes being more in the na
ture of improving tbe discipline surround
ill-- the game and making certain rules
less ambiguous. The report concludes:
We are emphatically of the opinion that
whenever trouble has arisen on the ball field
it has invariably been caused by the fact that
the umpire ha* failed to observe the rules.
Manyiruporta.it rules which have been cre
ated to maintain the dignity of the game have
become "dead letters" and Inoperative, simply
because the umpires have declined to enforce
them. This we consider radically wrong. It
is useless to adopt rules or make changes in
rules already adopted unless the rules are en
forced by the umpires.

TACOMA CLERK'S REVENGE.
Denied Increased Salary by the Northern
Pacific, He Issues Many
Passes.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 7.â A sensation
in railroad circles has been caused here
during the past week by the announce-
ment that more tban adozen passes of the
Northern Pacific Railroad were in the
hands of people who had no right to them.
Systematic investigation by railroad de
tectives was commenced, resulting 'in the
discovery that at least one of these passes
had fallen into the hands of ticket-scalp-,
ers, who were making remunerative use
oi it. Another result has been the dis
missal of Clerk Eaton from the oflice of
Assistant Superintendent Pearee, where
he had been employed since Pearee came
from St. Paul last fall.
Eaton was formerly employed in tbe St.
Paul offices and later in the land depart
ment under Paul Scbulze. He was
out of work for a time after Scbulze's
deatb, but having a family was soon given
another position. He asked for an in
crease in salary at the beginning of the
year. It was not granted, and it is
claimed tbat he then made use of the
signed pastes, which were in his pos
session, either to increase bis income or
to settle personal bills. He was given a
severe overhauling by the legal depart
ment, but it is understood there will be no
prosecution. The passes were good over
the western divisions of the road.

Southern Pacific Passenger
Trains in Collision
Near Chico.
The Engineer of One Too Hasty
in Attempting to Pass at
a Siding.
ti 'â¢ "â â  "â â â 
Two Men Sustain Fractured Bones
and Others Recsive a Rough
Shaking.
CHICO, Cal., Feb. 7.â Northbound Ore
gon express No. 15, on the Shasta division
of the Southern Pacific Railway, was in
collision this morning with southbound
express No. 16 at Notd station, seven
miles north of Chico. The tourist car at
tached to the latter was overturned, the
sleeper forced from the rails and tbe
second-class coach slightly damaged. One
passenger, an army deserter who was be
ing returned to Alcatraz Island, had an
arm fractured and another sustained a
broken ankle. The rest escaped with a
bad shaking up. The accident was due to ;
the failure of the engineer on the north
bound train to observe that tbe rear end
of the southbound express, was not clear!
oftbe main line.
The trains were scheduled to meet at
Anita, but the southbound express was
fifteen minutes late at Chico, and in con
sequence the meeting point was changed
to Nord, which is a few mile- to the south
of Anita. No. 16, the belated train in
charge of Conductor Moulter and Engineer
Bowsher, reached the crossing first and
was drawing into the side track when the
northbound train arrived.
A box-car which stood near the south
end of the siding obscured the headlight
of the locomotive behind it from the view
of Engineer Orr, who was piloting the
northbound train, and he did not observe
that three cars of the express were still
afoul of the main line. He slackened the
speed of bis train to about five miles an
hour, and was traveling at this pace when
the collision occurred.
Orr's engine struck the second-class
coach about midway and derailed the rear
trucks. The tourist car, three parts of
which stood on the main line, was com
pletely overturned and badly wrecked,
and the sleeper was also lifted from the
rails before Orr could stop the train. His
engine was crippled and the northbound
express was detained almost nine hours
before another train arrived from Sacra
mento. After a little delay the south
bound Pullman was replaced on the rails,
the tourist and second-class cars detached,
and the train started for Oakland.
SAN DIEGO BURGLAR CAUGHT.
Found Looting a Pastor's Residence
While Its Owner Was A tending
Church.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 7.â Larry Ham
ilton, alias Lawrence, a bard character
about town, was captured to-night about
9 o'clock by R. H. Young, F. J. Villa and
two others while trying to escape from
the house of Rev. C. W. Maggart, pastor
of the First Lutheran Church,' which he
had entered. The first intimation any one
had that there was a stranger in the douse
was the sight of a light moving from one
room to another. It was seen by two or
three persons who were leaving the church
at the close of the service. The parsonage
adjoins the church, and Mr. Young and
the others, seeing the light, rushed over
to investigate.
The noise evidently startled the in
truder, for he rushed to the nearest win
dow and started to jump through. Seeing
the men outside, he rushed back to jump
through another window, only to ' fall
into tbe bands of those outside. He
jumped to his feet, drew' a revolver and
red, but before be could shoot again he
was thrown to the ground -and disarmed.
Inside the Maggart house all was found
in confusion. A sack of silverware was
lying just inside the window, where it
had been by the burglar.
MARIN COCATY BOULEVARD.
Government to Build a Road to the Lime

SAUSALITO, Cal., Feb. 7.â The Gov
ernment boulevard to Lime Point reserva
tion is now assured, and, according to
Judge J. H. Pryor ot Sausalito, a connect
ing boulevard through the town of Sausa
lito will be constructed. The work will be
commenced on the Ist of April, it having
been ordered by the Board of Town
Trustees. Judge Pryor has been identi
fied with the . good-ioails movement in
Marin Connty from the first. He said to
day that the new road, for which Congress
had appropriated a large sum of money,
would be one of the finest boulevards in
tne State of California.
"A movement is now on foot," said he,
"to build a boulevard from Sau Raiael to
Sausalito. When this is accomplished
the town of Sausalito will have its boule
vard finished and will connect the San
Rafael road with the one to be built by
the Government. The Lime Point boule
vard will commence at the dividing line
between the town and tbe reservation and
will extend around - Lime - Point and a
short way up tbe coast and connection
will be made with the San Rafael road by
continuing the boulevard through Tenne

HILL VALLEY ADVENTURE.
Sausalito Physician's Horse and Carriage
Imbedded in a Bog for Two
Hours.
MILL VALLEY, Cau, Feb. 7.-Arthur
H. Mays, a physician of Sausalito, had a
thrilling experience near Mill Valley last
night shortly after 8 o'clock. The doctor
was notified that his services were re
quired in Mill Valley, and accompanied
by his wife started to drive from Sausalito.
The roads were in a wretched condition
because of recent rains, and the night was
dark and forbidding.
All went well until a point just below
Millwood station was reached, when the
horse stepped over a loe and sank into the
soft mud. The buggy also began to settle
in the mire, and the doctor jumped out to
extricate the horse. He found that both
horse and buggy were firmly imbedded.
Leaving his wife with the horse he
waded through the mud and slush to Mill
Valley, a mile distant, in search of aid.
He engaged the services of William Miller
and a pair of horses and sent them to the
relief of the stranded outfit, while he con
tinued on bis way to the patient's house.
When Miller reached the I orse ana
buggy he found that the animal was
breathing with difficulty, and immedi
ately efforts were made to drag the horse
out of the soft mud, In which it was slowly
sinking. A rope was put around the ani
mal's neck and the team brought from
Mill Valley was attached to the other end
and started. This means of rescuing the
poor beast was tried a number of times
and finally, after the animal had been in
the mud over two hours, it was dragged
out.
This morning it was found that a huge
landslide had occurred and the doctor in
the darkness had driven off the road. At
one spot a test was made to ascertain how
lar down the soil mud extended and an
eighteen- foot scantling was pushed down
completely out of sight. Dr. Mays and
his wife had a narrow escape.
SMALL SUJI *SKED FOR.
Funds Wanted for the Repair of the
Lick Observatory Road.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Feb. 7.âA bill asking
for an appropriation for repairing the
Mount Hamilton (Lick Observatory) road
and a yearly allowance for keeping it in
proper condition will be introduced in
both houses of the State Legislature tbe
coming week by Senator Morehouse and
Assemblyman Arnerich of this county.
The bills are being prepared at the in
stance of Supervisor Stern by Deputy
Districi At orney Beasly. An appropria
tion of $3000 will be asked for, and a
yearly allowance of $1000.
The road is used principally by visitors
to Lick Observatory, and as the road tax
in the thinly settled section through
which it runs is not sufficient to keep it
in repair it is thought the State should
aid in maintaining it. Tbe road was built
by the county at a cost of $100,000.

Reckless Career of Black
Jack," the Captured
Bandit.
Five Murders and a Score of
Robberies Charged to His '
Cutthroats.
Once Refused to Loot a Railroad Sta
tion Because a Woman Was
in . Charge.
SILVER CITY, N. M., Feb. 7.â The
capture on Saturday near El Paso, Texas,
of John McDonald, alias ''Black Jack,"
leader of the border bandits who have
been operating in New Mexico, Arizona
and old Mexico for the past year, means
that this section is at last rid of the mar
auding band. Col . Estis, alias Cole Young,
and "Bob" Hayes have- been killed in
fights with officers, and the remaining
two members, George Musgrave, alias
Jeff Davis, alias Jesse Williams, and Tom
Anderson are believed to have made their
escape into Mexico.
The gang had been in existence about
two years. Until nine months ago its op
erations were confined chiefly to smug
gling on the Mexican border. From July
20, 1896. until November 19 of the same
year the outlaws engaged in frequent
forays. Their first appearance was at
Separ, N. M., on July 20, when they held
up tbe postmaster, robbed the postoflice
of $20 and took about $200 from tbe store
in which it was located. Thence they
went to Nogales, Arizona, where they at
tempted to rob a bank, but failed to get
any cash.
"Black Jack" and his band were fol
lowed by a posse and a tight took place in
SKeleton canyon. Line Rider Robson,
one of the bravest officers who ever strad
dled a horse, was ambushed and killed.
Then tbey crossed over into New Mexico
and stopped the White Oaks stages, going
and coming, within four miles of each
other and captured the mail. From there
they went to Rio Puerco, and, in attempt
ing to rob an Atlantic and Pacific train.
Cole Young was killed by Deputy United
States Marshal Loom is. They returned
southward and again robbed both the
White Oaks stages. Coming on to Dom
ing, N. M., they boarded the Southern
Pacific train, westbound, but the conduc
tor backed the train into Deming, and the
robbers struck out for their horses and
made for the range.
On October 27 they were at Teviston,
where they robbed the postoffice and got
$15 from a store. They were next beard
from at Separ again on November 2. There
they took in the postoffice, store and sta
tion. Then they sped over to Hnachua
Siding, Ariz., where on the 7th they held
up tne agent and took $130. Their object
was to fob the United States paymaster,
who was"' supposed to * have "* been due on
that date. From the Siding tbey went
into . the Dragoon Mountains, making a
feint against Teviston, but landing at Will*
cox, where they bad intended to halt the
United States paymaster on his way to
Fort Grant. They again missed their date.
From /Teviston. they went, to Stems Pass
to hold up the station, but found a woman
in charge and said they would not molest
a woman.' -_V
They robbed the section boss to get ex
pense money and then struck for the
Chihuahua line, where they had* a des
perate fight on Novemher 19 with a mar
shal's and a Sheriff*, posse. "Bob" Hayes
was killed and Musgrave wounded.'
Besides the many robberies laid at its
door, the gang murdered five men. They
were Robson, the Tin erider; Parker, near
Rose water, N. Mex. ; a stockman, against
whom Musgrave .had an old \ grudge; m
rancher on the Gila,, who had informed on
them, and a cowboy, who had a fine horse
tbey wanted and had also informed on
them. Besides, they have beaten several
of the persons they robbed.
"The rewards for the capture of "Black
Jack" will aggregate over $3000. The cap
tured leader will likely be tried at Socorro,
N. Mex., on the charge â of stage robbery,
tbe punishment for which i. life impris
onment. He will be confined in the Silver
City jail for safe keeping until his trial,
and will be brought to this place by United
States Marshal Hall on Tuesday.

HUNTING WITH A MIEEOR.
Effect of Reflected Light "Upon Birds
and Rabbits in the "Woods.
A taxidermist at Northwood, N. V.. has
been matting experiments as to the effect
of light reflected in a bird's eye. A glass
seven or eight inches in diameter has been
found most serviceable. IÂ«he antics of
blue jays are remarkable* when the light
strikes them as tbey sit in the shadow of
an evergreen tree. T_ey jump to another
branch and try to look into the light, but
they have to turn away, as the. light
dazzles them. Then they fly around the
reflector, but after practice one is able to
keep the light always on them, and the
birds not infreauently come within reach
ol a man's band.
A ruffed grouse gives a startled look
when the light strikes it. Then it jumps
and away it goes. Hawks, too, are usually
startled or annoyed so that they fly off.
Woodpeckers don't seem to mind it at ail.
: Rabbits blink and stare .at a glass for
awhile, then go around a stump and sit
up again, as if waiting for the light to play
tag with them. New York Sun.
Where Dukes Are Burled.
'. Then we pursued the rest of the party
to Hamilton Palace, which is like a monster
London house Ãelgrave square covered

park is a huge domed edifice, something
like the tomb of Theodoric at Ravenna.
It was erected by tne last Duke- for him
self, his son, grandson and his nine pre
decessors. "What a grand sight it will
be," he said, ."when twelve Dukes of
Hamilton rise together here at the resur
rection ;He himself lies just under the
dome, upon a pavement of colored marbles
and inside the sarcophagus of an Egyptian
Queen, with her image painted and sculp
tured outside. He had this sarcophagus
brought from Thebes, and used frequently
to lie down in it to see bow it fitted. It is
made of Egyptian seyenite, the hardest of
all stones, and could not be altered; but
when dying he was so haunted by the idea
that his body might be too long to go in
side tbe sarcophagus that his last words
were "Double me up; double me up!"
After he was dead no amount of doubling
could get him into the mummy case, and
they nad to cut off his feet to do it. Alas,
that I should have to add a note to say
that the mummy case has been since dis
covered not to have belonged to a Queen
at all, but to the court jester. The Remi

jumping from the bridge. Hardisty and
Miss Akers, who were on the lower bridge,
started to ran when they heard the engine
approaching. At the end of the bridge
Miss Akers fell. Her companion, in en

MONEY FLOWING
INTO RANDSBURG
Capitalists Eager to Own
Mines in the Desert
District.
Its Future Pictured in Glowing
Colors by a Returned
Visitor.
Says Every Claim Yields a Profit to
Its Owners From the Grass-
Roots Down.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 7.â 0. H. Savage,
Western manager for the Feron & Bal
lon Company, has returned from Rands
burg and Johannesburg, in the great
Mojave mining district, which has aston
ished the entire country by its marvelous
richness. Mr. Savage gives glowing ac
counts of the mines, and says they much
more than justify all that has been said of
tbem. Teaming from the railroad station
keeps many outfits busy, and so great has
the traffic become that the Southern Pa
clflc Company is arranging to build a rail
road from Mojave, and the surveyors are
now at work running a line back from
Randsburg and Johannesburg. When
asked as to the stability of the mines Mr.
Savage said:
"The half has not been told. No such
extensive or such rich mining section has
ever been discovered anywhere before,
an.d the beauty of it is the mines have all
paid their way from the grass roots down.
The mine-owners are not inviting any
body to come; they are too busy working
their mines and taking out the gold to
worry their heads about anything else.
"The boom we all hear about is worKed
up by the railroads and town-lot owners,
and, strange to say, nearly everybody who
has bought lots Has made a good turn o.i
them, and improvements are going in rap
idly. Hundreds of wagons laden with
lumber and merchandise travel from Mo
jave to Randsburg and from Kramer to
Randsburg. The procession never ends,
day or night.
"There are fully 5000 people in and
around the Rand district, and a great
many valuable mines , are now being
worked. The milling is done within a
radius of ten or twelve miles of Hands
burg, where plenty of water is obtainable.
Prominent capitalists and mine-owners ol
Los Angeles and Randsburg are now de
veloping a big water supply within a few
miles of Randsburg, and extensive
mills will soon be erected, together with a
cyanide plant. The water question wiil
not be a drawback much longer.
"There is enough ore on the dumps
to keen 100 stamps going day and
night, all within a radius of one to five
miles of the towns of Randsburg and
Johannesburg.
"Wealthy mining men of this State and
from Colorado have at last ceased crying
down the Rand district in the hope of get
ting mining properties at their own fig
ures, and are now quietly buying every
good mine which is offered at anything;'
like a reasonable figure, and in many in
stances where very little development has*
been done, which shows their faith in the
section."
Mr. Savage was asked concerning the re
port that he had purchased the Winnie
and Yucca Tree, both valuable mines,
located within a mile and a half of Rands
burg, in the rich Yucca section of the
Rand district, for a round sum in siot
cash, and that be had been offered a hand
some profit on his investment by promi
nent California and Colorado mining
men.
"The statement is correct," said Mr.
Savage. "Several persons have been fig
uring with me to get the prope-ty for an
English syndicate, but I will soon push
work with a big force, as the mines are
both opened up and not mere prospects,
there being lully $15,000 worth ot rich gold
ore in sight already uncovered."
A remarkable feature of tbe many towns
is that the cost of living is not much
greater than it is here, and everything de
sired can be had almost as easily. There
is a thorough organization of the citizens
and life and property are as safe as any
where. ]-'â¢: â ' >..
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES.
Best of Them to Meet Univer
sities and May Go
East.
Field Days and Many Baseball Games
Arranged by Filteen Big
Schools* '
â  â '-â '
The Academic Athletic League of Cali
fornia is planning to send a crack team
East this summer to compete with the
best scholastic teams. The league has re
cently been increased to fifteen of the
largest' and most prominent schools of
the State. Belmont School, which estab
lished a remarkable record for itself on
the gridiron during football season just
ended, has joined the league. It is con
sidered a most powerful acquisition. â  .; '
A series of field days has been arranged
leading up to the semi-annual inter
scholastic championship meet to be held
in this City on April 3. According to the
rules of the league each of the fifteen
schools must enter a team for this meet or
pay a fine. A very large entry list will be
the result. The school winning the great
est number of points will be awarded the
championship.
At present the Berkeley High School is
supposed to have the best chance for first
place, Oakland High School, now and for
some time the champion, being conceded
the second place in any event, and Lowell
High School and Polytechnic High
School being looked upon as fair possibil
ities for third place, unless some of the
other schools prove a surprise. '
The first and second place man in the
interscholastic field day will represent the
league as a team in the annual amateur
championship field day to be held here
some time during April under the auspices
of the Pacific Association of the Amateur
Union. Berkeley, Stanford and the big
athletic clubs of the State will enter
teams. . .. - " â yS- '.v. '****_â 
The league has also arranged a series of
baseball games for the sctiool champion
ship. The school that shall lose two out
of its three preliminary matches will not
be eligible to compete in the finals, which
will be arranged later, j Oakland High
School is expected to win first place, with
Belmont School and Berkeley High School
close up. But there may be. some sur
prises.
Cycling races, too, have been provided
for. On February 27 all the schools of the
League will enter their best" riders in the
interscholastic bicycle meet which will be
held on the Velodrome track, in this City.
Lowell High School has recently com
pleted a cinder-track near Bush afid
Pierce streets. It is nine laps to the mile

AN EMBASSALOE SLIGHTED.
Why the French Kniba.nador Was Not
Invited to the Bachelors' Cotillon.
There is considerable agitation in the
diplomatic corps and high society circles
because the committee of young men who
are managing the bachelors' cotillon this
season have boycotted the French Embas
sador, says the Washington correspondent
of the Chicago record. The bachelors'
cotillon is the most select and exclusive of
all the public functions given in Wash
ington. It corresponds to the patriarchs'
ball in New York and the charity ball in
Chicago. The attendance is limited and
the list of those whose presence is desired
is made out by a committee which has its
origin and headquarters in the Metropoli
tan Club. The invitations are sent to a
selected number, who are permitted to
contribute to tbe expense of the enter
] tainment by buying tickets. If the pro
| ceeds happen to be in excess of expenses
; the balance is divided among certain local
charities.
The diplomatic corps is always invited.
The corps belongs ex-officio to the district
aristocracy, and all the members bave re
ceived invitations to subscribe to the
; bachelors' cotillon this year except tbe
French Embassador, who is the hand
i somest man among them and a gentle
man whose social distinction is equal to
his professional reputation.
All the other members of the French
embassy received invitations, and it was
i therefore supposed the Embassador's
J name had been omitted by mistake, but
when one of his attaches called upon the
committee to notify them of the error he
discovered to his astonishment that it was
intentional. He was coolly informed that
the committee had stricken the names of
Mr. and Mrs. Patenotre from the list be
cause he had slighted Mrs. Rockhill, the
wife of the assistant Secretary of State.
It was also intimated that the members of
the committee were friends of Mr. Rock
hill, and proposed to stand by him in the
social feud that has been going on for
'some time between him and the French
Embassador. The story is an old one.
Eleven years ago Mr. Rockhill was sec
retary of the United States legation at
Peking aud his wife was a leader in the
amusements of the diplomatic circle.
While arranging for a picnic or some
other function she asked the assistance of
Mr. Patenotre, who was then the French
Minister to China. That amiable eentle
man rode twelve miles on horseback on a
hot day to keep an appointment with Mrs.
Rockhill aud when he arrived at her
house she asked to be excused from seeing
him. He explained to the servant that
he had come in from the country a long
distance to see Mrs. Rockhill at her re
quest and was very certain that she did
.not understand that it was he when sue
sent the message. The servant went back
to his mistress with the explanation. She
retorted, impatiently: "Tell him I cannot
see him. It is too hot to talk business.
Tell him anything to get rid of him. Tell
him I am dead."
It so happened that the Chinese servant
repeated her words literally and accu
rately to the Minister of France, but that
was unnecessary, for he had overheard
them through the lattice work, and since
he left her door that day he bas not recog
nized Mrs. Rockhill. When Mr. Rockhill
was promoted to be First Assistant Secre
tary of State he and bis wife were ad
mitted to the diplomatic circle here, and
soon after met the French Embassador
and his wife at a dinner party. Being
ignorant of tbe situation, the hostess as
signed Mr. Patenotre to escort Mrs. Rock
hill to the dinner table, and when he re
ceived his card fie asked to be excused,
saying that he did not know the lady.
"But 1 will present you," said the host
ess. 'â¢
"I do not wish to be presented," was the
Embassador's reply. "This lady told me
more than ten years ago that she was dead,
and I do not care to be a resurrectionist."
Through a lack of tact on tbe part of
the hostess thi< dramatic situation be
came known to almost everybody in the
party, and within twenty-lour hours the
story was all over Washington,' which ir
ritated Mr. Rockhill to such an extent
that he sent a very indiscreet note saying
that if the French Embassador would not
recognize Mr. and Mrs. Rockhill socially
he could not recognize the French Em
bassador officially, and advised nim that,
in the future, he must transact his busi
ness in the State Department with some
other person. The French Embassador,
smiled, and put the note in his pocket, in
order to show it to Secretary Olney the
next time he visited the State Depart"
ment. He has studiously ignored the
Rockhill* ever since, and to some of their
friends who have endeavored to effect a
reconciliation he has said: "She told me
she was dead.' One must accept the word
of a lady, especially when she speaks of
herself."
In France 4,000,000 tons of potatoes are
annually used in the manufacture of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1897.
COMPANIES SHOT
FOR GLORY ONLY
Yesterday Comparatively
Quiet at Shell Mound
Park.
Company D of the First Regi
\ ment Resumes Active
Practice.
Medal, Class and Practic; Firing, and
a Private Match Filled the
Programme.
Yesterday was a comparatively quiet
day at the Shell Mound Park shooting
ranges, the attendance and the interest
attaching to the various events on the
afternoon's programme both being smaller
than usual. The weather, too, proved de
cidedly unfavorable to bigh scoring and
professional enthusiasm alone could in
duce the marksmen to stay long at the
targets. The scorers' noses were purple
and the numbed lingers of the marksmen
sadly interfered with a steady aim. Un
der such inauspicious conditions the aver
age maintained was highly commendable.
The members of Company ' D, First In
fantry Regiment, N. G. C, formerly
known as Company A, resumed rifle prac
tice yesterday after two years' intermis
sion, many of the old-time experts being
present.
The company has purchased four fine
medals, distributed as foUows: Cham
pion and classes A, B and C. Tbe first is
said to be one of the handsomest trophies
of the Kind ever offered by the company
for competition, and the others, though
necessarily somewhat inferior, are well
worth winning.
A committee, composed of Lieutenant
T. J. McCreagh, Sergeant C. I. White and
Corporal J. C. Seagrave, will hencefor
ward bave full control over these competi
tions. The committee's fond ambition is
to make Company D first in rank among
the military sharpshooters. In addition
to the medals mentioned 'above the com
mittee has arranged for the bestowal of
fifteen prizes upon the members making
the highest average scores during the year.
The company turned out in force yester
day, and, though rusty for want of prac
tice, made the following totals in the
class shooting:
Lieutenant F. J. McCreagh 39, Sergeant C.
G. White 42, Sergeant W. E. Meadows 34, Ser-
I geant K. W. Newbert 41, Corporal J. C. Sea-
I grave 33, L. H. Anthers 9, D. J. Daly 36, J.

J. G. Swan 24, W. Russell 12, T. Taylor 13.
Divisions 1 and 2 of the Naval Battalion
also did some class shooting in the course
of the afternoon. The tirst division com
pleted both its January and February
shoots yesterday, the following scores re
sulting:
Lieutenant C. C. Dennis 26 and 36, Ensign
Gaild 30 .nd 25. Luderman 40 and 47, Quln

The second division scored as follows:
C. P. O. Mills 35, R. Jones 32, Russell Reed
36, J. C. Kelly 33, E. Donnellan 30, A. D.
Stevens 16, F. R. Sutton 31, D. Weir 29, Henry

Jahnigan 41, C. Poulter Jr. 30. Cleveland 41,
Corporal Littlefield 39, C. 11. Ellis 42, Brink 27.
The Deutscher Krieger Verein held its
monthly medal shoot on the German ring
target, the result being:
Champion class, C. Weggemann, 391; first
class, N. Plegel, 321; second class, "W. Llnde
man, 315; third class, Mohr, 262; most bulls
eyes, C. Weggemann; first best shot, C. Wegge
mann, 24 ; last beat shot, 1. Bendel, 24.
A special match was decided yesterday
between H. Wicker and two teams com
posed of F. 0. Young and F. F. Bushnell,
J. Â£. Gorman and A. H. Pape respectively.
Wicker was given 50 points on the Colum
bia target, and won by virtue of his handi
cap, with 277 points against Young's 303,
the next best. It should be added by way
of explanation tbat the lowest numerical
score indicates the best marksmanship
on the Columbia target. The complete
scores were:'
Young 89, 48, 70, 51, 45â303.
Bushnell 113,93,93,99,80â484.
Total 787.
Pape 63, 54, 63. 64, 61â305.
Gorman 96. 63, 78, 93, 73-708.
Wicker 54, 60, 78, 68, 67â327, less 50â277.
Pane's team, therefore, beat Young's,
and Wicker, solus, defeated both. '
Captain L. Siebe, proprietor of the
ranee, announce., that he has enlarged
the stalls occupied by the Columbia Club
some three feet and has put in a side
table and another wheel on target C.
The Nord Deutscher Schuetzen Club
will hold a competition on the man target

The I-ifle Match Postponed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 7.â The rain this
morning deterred the Oakland team from
coming over to shoot against Company
G's men in the fifteen-men match. If the
weather is suitable and the Oakland com
pany willing the match will be shot next
Sunday. The" high wind this afternoon
prevented the home company from mak

AROUND THE DIAMOND
The Piute Indians Defeated by
the Alameda Alerts
Yesterday.
C.htral Park Crowded With Spec-
tators to See the Red Men Play
the National Game.
"Nearly 10,000 spectators saw the Ala
meda Alerts scalp the Piute Indians at
Central Park yesterday, the score at the
end of the ninth inning being 6 to 2.
Tbe game, as an exhibition of baseball,
did not reach the expectation of the
crowd. The Indians seemed to bo afflicted
with stage fright, and at times their fran
tic playing kept the crowd in a happy
mood.
The Alameda Alerts had a large crowd
of rooters with them, but their noise was
slight compared with that of the Piutes'
sympathizers.
The game started with the Indians at
bat and Clattwa was given an ovation,
but he struck out Daubuke hit an easy
grounder to first, going out, and Wish
shon followed Clattwa's example.
The Alerts were unable to make con
nections with Aquartra's speedy ball until
the third inning, when J. Hammond started
the run getting by hitting safely to third;
Goldsworthy was hit by pitcher and went
to first, advancing Hammond, and Bird
then tilled the bases by a pretty bit to left
field. The Piutes' pitcher became nervous
and hit Brochoff, giving him his base and
forcing J. Hammond in. Aquartra settled
down for a moment and struck Muskimon
out. __rug then followed with a hot
grounder to left field for two bases and
bringing in Goldsworthy and Bird. W.
Hammond hit safely to center and Brochoff
scored. McCarthy threw to third to put
out Krug, but Clattwa let the ball go
through his hands and Krug came home.
McKee was next up and reached first on
a hit to third. McCarthy became anx
ious at Aquartra'B wild Ditching and took
his place in the box, and Mertes, an old
time player, went in as catcher. Aquar
tra retired to the bench. The crowd did
not fancy this move and they hooted the
new pitcher, but he set himself right by
striking out Jacot sen, who is one of the
Alerts' star batters. Hammond hit to
Chickwa, who made a lightning throw to
first, in time to put the speedy runner out
and end the inning.
The Alerts gained another run in the
sixth inning. McKee led off with a high
fly to second. Wishon ran from short to
capture it, as also did DanbuKe. The
former allowed the ball to slip through
his hands, but eagle-eyed Danbuke made
a grand-stand play by getting under it
before it reached the ground. Jacobsen
redeemed himself by bitting past center
for two bases. Hammond went out on a >
long fly to right field, and Goldsworthy
brought Jacobsen in on a two-base hit.
Bird hit to center, and a quick throw to
first retired the side.
In the seventh inning Zubie made a
wild swing at the first ball thrown, and to
the surprise of himself and the crowd sent
it over third for two bases. Chickwa,
becoming imbued with the same enthusi
asm, hit to right field, bringing in Zubie.
Dahu was hit by McKee and was given
bis base. McKee' s arm either gave out or
he felt be deserved a rest after striking
eleven men out. so he went to short and
Krug took bis place in the box. Krug be
gan hostilities by bitting Clattwa, who
went to first, filling the bases. Danbuke
struck out, and Wishshon hit to pitcher
and out. â ' . '.".'*:.â¢"Â» *""
McCarthy had a chance to go down to
posterity as a great player, there being
three men on bases and two men out, but
the effort was too great and he ignomlnl
ously struck out. The Piutes scored an
other run in the eighth inning, but the
Alerts had enough runs and did not take
their last inning.
The Indians played a good fielding
game, but were weak at bat. The playing
of Chickwa and Danbuke was of a high
order. ;! â . -
The Alerts put up a ragged game and
had the Piutes been able to bat there
might have been a different story to tell.

The long continued wet spell cleared up
yesterday just in time for the people to
enjoy a good Sunday afternoon's outing
at the park and beach. There were a large
number who hastened out almost as soon
as the sun did. The Cliff flouse was
crowded and a large number took in the
sports at the Sutro Baths. The pictur
esqueuess of the park was aided by a
number of Chinese in their gayest silk
attire, enjoying their New Year's holi
days. â¢
There has just been completed a new
ambulance station at the park and here
after there will be a doctor there day and
night. He will have an assistant and a
driver and they will be ready to attend to
an emergency call at any hour of the day
or night. A receiving-room has been
fitted up adjoining the Park police sta
tion and the ambulance team will be
stabled near by.
At the Park Museum the curators have
just installed their collection of coins and
medals. They number 3,000, and there are
somo rare pieces among them. The Col
onial room has been rearranged and some
relics now displayed, which have been
sometime in possession, but are 'not yet
open for inspection. A number of new
gifts were received last week, among them
being the following: A Dresden china lace
group, "Tne Sleigh Ride," from S. and G.
Gump; four pairs of black-tail deer horns
from Hon. John Daggett; one pair walrus
tusks, elegantly carved, from J. L. Bard

Ringrose had second place. Fancy diving
by Shulte and Radican was one of the best
features. Shulte'9 long leap through the
air from the roof of the building â a dis
tance of sixty feetâ was a pretty perform
ance, and J. Radican made a handspring
high dive, which made it hard to decide
which excelled. The clowns furnished
laughter for the afternoon with a repre
sentation of "Mamma's Pet" and*,bis irate
mamma, who catches him smoking ciga
rettes and gives chase to him with many
misfortunes to her skirts. The obstacle
race was very closely contested by Otto
Schulte and R. B. Cornell. They climbed
all the barriers and took every leap into
the water at the same instant, thus afford
ing a very pretty sight. In shimming
tbe last pool Cornell got a little ahead
and so won the prize. .
At the Chutes there was a good balloon
ascension, and on the stage which has
recently been erected there, the Japanese
acrobats, | the Hagiharss. did some won
derful balancing feats. The grounds were
crowded with richly dressed Chinese who
have been invited there to enjoy their
New Year's holidays, and the spectacle
they made was tbe best part of the show.
The Celestial children were fairly
i georgeous in their bright silk costumes.
The Chutes are now being run every after
noon and evening. The entrance has a tine
new electric sign, and many new electric
lights have been added to beautify the
grounds. ' *

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR AltNATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
The indications from Sacramento are
that the National Guard will receive an
appropriation that will enable it to secure
that which it needs badly, namely, uni
forms, overcoats and blankets, but tbe
chances for encampments are very slight
as the energy of parties interested ap
pears to be in the direction of securing an
appropriation for camp sites. If the bill
for sites passes there is but little hope for
an appropriation for encampments.
The bill which was introduced by Sena
tor Pedlar will, it is asserted, not trouble
the guard any more in this session, as it
is claimed that it has teen killed in the
military committee; but there are others
and one which is likely to meet with favor
in the committee is the one known art the
Cross bill. This is said to have some good
features in it and those who are interested
in the guard have promised to have those
good features retained and have the ob
jectionable ones eliminated. This bill,
among other things, aims to prevent the
possibility of placing at the head indi
viduals who have not seen service in the
guard, that ia crowding out politicians
lor men of experience, men who know
something about the formation of a regi
ment out of a column of fours. The bill
increases the number of companies in the
guard from sixty-five to seventy, the ad
ditional companies to be located where
needed, that matter to be determined
upon a review of the military condition of
the State. It adds the brigadier-general
of each brigade to tho board of location
and organization within the brigade
limits, it also provides that the major
general and the brigadier-generals shall
have served four years in the National
â¢ Guard before appointment and of that
time to have served two years as a field
officer, lt further provides that all staff
officer*: must be residents of the brigade
territory of the brigade to which such
officers -.re attached.
Further the bill provides tbat each com
pany, troop or battery shall be composed
or not less that fifty nor more than 103
officers and privates. There shall be an !
annual inspection and muster of the
Guard in the month of March of each
year, and company officers must make out
triplicate reports to tbe major-general,
brigadier-general and adjutant-general.
The hospital and ambulance corps shall
not exceed six men; the present law al
lows not to exceed twelve. A regiment is
io consist of not less than eight nor more
than twelve companies, to be divided into
battalions of not le.s than lour companies.
Tue new sections regulate rifle practice !
and the organization of a sanitary corps. i
Section 2094 is amended so as to do away I
with Galling puns and permit the intro- !
duction of artillery. The appropriation of
$4000 per annum for the promotion of rifle
practice is reduced to $.500. Certain ap
propriations for the equipment of the
brigade signal corps are cut off.
Major Tilden, who bas always proved
a friend of the guard, went to Sacramento
ast week, and when before the military
committee discovered tnat in one of the
hi. was a provision that members of the
National Guard should not be exempt
irom the payment of poll tax. Under the
old constitution it was expressly stipu
lated that National Guardsmen, or militia
men, as they were formerly called, shouid
i.c exempt Irom the payment of poll tax,
but me uew constitution leaves the mat
ter in doubt as to whether the men should
pay such tax. The major soon convinced
the committee that it was a rank injus
tice to compel men to give their time to
the State without compensation, drill and
"be ready to turn out in case of need at a
moment's notice, and then pass a law
compelling them to pay poll tax. The
clause was stricken from tbe bill in which
it had been inserted.
It is probable that the call for the elec
tion of a colonel to iiil the vacancy caused '
by the resignation ot Colonel Macdonald
will be issued during the week, some time
after the meeting of the board of officers
on Thursday next.
Colonel Frame V. Sumner has during
lhe past weeK declared that although his
name had been mentioned in connection
with the colonelcy of the First of the
Second Brigade, be did not want to be con
sidered a candidate lor the place, and
added that he would not accept the re
sponsibility ol the command.
This narrows the numberof possibilities
to two â Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce, acting
colonel of the regiment, and Major Huber.
The lr ends of the acting colonel say that
he has not declared himsel: as a candidate
for the position, and that- with a spirit of
independence that is commendable, he |
will r.ot ask for the position, taking the !
ground tbat the office should seek the I
man and not the man the office. They i
claim for him that, as he practically has I
been the head of the legiment from the j
time Colonel Macdonald was named, the i
officers have had an opportunity to de- j
termine his fitness fur the position, and I
that if they desire to retain him in it they '
should maKe the offer and then give him
such a vote as would demonstrate, not by
a mere majority, but by unanimity, confi
dence in his ability.
Next Monday the signal corps of the
Second Brigade, which has been captain
less sines the resignation of Captain Board
man, will elect his successor. It is very
probable that tbe election will result in
the unanimous choice of First Lieutenant
i'_ji*i ( * J. Perkins.
Companies C and G (the Nationals) will
give a party on tbe evening of the 10th
ins.
There is a possibility that Company F,
First Infantry, Second Brigade, may go
into camp for two days shortly.
There is to be a battalion shoot next
Sunday.
The recommendation of the officers of
the Fifth Infantry, Second Brigade,
for camp ovens, has met with favorable
..-ration from tbe military commit
tee at Sacramento, as well as from the Ad
jutant-General.
The Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. s.âBat
talion drill in the Third Brigade drew a
â¢ full attendance last night, Company G be
ing represented ny fully sixty men and i
Company X having < l 8 many present, j
Owing to the sickness of Colonel Guthrie 1
-.-â¢._-_-_
Captain Steams, as ranking captain, was
in command and fully demonst'ated that
he was familiar with all the duties of an
officer of the National Guard. After assem
bling at the armory the two companies
were divided into four companies, but
owing to the lack of space but three com
panies were drilled at a time. Tbe men
l show marked improvement in tactics and
all marching movements and are enthu
siastic in all pertaining to the welfare of
the guard.
On Washington's birthday tbe battalion
will have a field day and will march to Ag
ricultural Park witn full equipments and
twenty rounds of blank cartridges.
Company G received four applications
at its last held meeting, which will be
acted upon on next Monday night. One
of the applicants is Heath, formerly of
Company B.San Francisco, and wno for
some' time has held the position of military
instructor at the lone School.
At the school for instruction of non
commissioned officers of Company G. held
Tuesday evening, the members became so
interested that Captain Steams had con
siderably difficulty in persuading them to
retire even after a two-hour drill. Troop
_$, Captain Cook, is rapidly coming into
form, and only lacks outdoor exercise to
bring it in condition to make any troop in
the State look to its laurels. The mem
bers are looking forward to a ten-day
outing, mounted, during the summer.
The following is a copy of a letter in
answer to one received by Adjutant-Gen
eral Barrett from Adjutant-General Axline
of Ohio:
Sacramento, Dec. 16, 1896.
General 11. A. Axline, Adjutant-General of
Ohio, Co umbus, Ohio â Sir: Re-plying to your
letter of the 10th inst. relative as to what the
United Stales Government should do in the
matter of additional appropriations for the
purpose of assisting the several States in
maintaining its National Guard I will briefly
state mv views in the matter:
Firstâ The National Guard of the different
States are practically to-day the standing army
of tne Government, and should trouble arisi
with any foreign nation they would be the
nucleus of the army of this country, Bud
therefore I claim that it is but just that this
Government shoum furnish to all of the States
modern and uniform arms and equipments so
I that all Stales would be equipped aliKe; as the
I condition of the National Guard of the differ
ent States now stands no two States arc
equipped the same and in case of war there
would be a difference oi arms, equipments,
rules and regulations.
i am a firm believer, so far as possible, in the
principle that all officers and men should be
schooled and disciplined in the rules and
regulations as adopted by the United States
I Government, so that if the time should ever
I occur that the troops irom aifferent States
should be called together they would all be
accustomed to the same rules and regulations
and practices.
Ido not think that the United States Gov
! ernmental the present time is appropriating
Its pro rata expense of maintaining the Na
| tional Guard ot the different States. For illus
tration, the state of Calif. .spends annu
' ally about the sum of $150,000 on its National
â  Guard a.-.a tht.- United States Government only
allots to this State *7700.
â¢ Secondâ l believe the amount should be so
I increased that in addition to furnishing the
i proper arms and equipments to the States, the
I United States should pay an annual per diem
of $2 to each member of the National Guard
for a ten days' encampment for the purpose ol
drills and instructions. Such encampment
snould be thoroughly inspected and instructed
1 by a competent officer of the regular army.
In this State the members of the National
Guard assemble for the purpose oi drills, pa
rades and target practice on an average oi
about fltty times a year. This is done entirely
without compensation, but for pure and pa
triotic motives, and I believe that the Govern
ment should pay for a camp of instructions
once a year, and I am satisfied that it would
be an incentive to' all National Guardsmen
which would be highly appreciated and would
be beneficial to this Government, and result
in having a National Guard which, when
called upon, would compose an army of which
the people oi this country would feel justly
proud: and I believe ihat Congress should ap
propriate, annually, the sum of at least
.-3,000,000, to be distributed to the different
I States pro rata, in accordance with the num-
I ber of National Guardsmen they may have,
| and 1 fee. assured that the people of this coun
i try would be exceedingly gratified to know
that their money was thus expended.
I shall take great pleasure in co-operating
with you i.i any measures that miv be for the
best interests nl the National Guard. lam,
very respectfully, A. XV. Barrett.
Adjutant-General.
-he Sixth Infantry.
The resignation of Colonel J. J. Nunan
as commander of Sixth Infantry has been
accepted, and the election to fill the va
cancy has been ordered for the loth inst.
This, it is generally believed, will result
in the promotion of Lieutenant-Colonel
Stuart S. Wright to the colonelcy and of
Major Colin Chisholm to be lieutenant
colonel, Should that programme carry
the headquarters will be removed from
Stockton to Fresno.
The Naval Hut .lion.
The members of the Naval Battalion at
this port have, like the other members of
the National Guard, been more or less
troubled about the possible action of the
legislators, but last week word came from
Sacramento that there would not be any
disturbance of the boys who drill on the
Comanche, and consequently there is more
quietude in the ranks. And, better still,
the battalion has the promise of assistance
from the lawmakers.
The battalion is beingdriiled thoroughly
both on land and sea and tbe men are
taking a great deal of interest in the work
assigned to them and in the instructions
imparted. The battalion is at this time
virtually the only body of artillery in the
guard. It is provided with the finest
rapid-firing guns in the serviceâ guns that
are effective in action.
Of late there has been opened a school
for the instruction of the men and the
petty officers. The tactics of the battalion
are somewhat difficult to understand with
out thorough explanation, and it is for the
purpose of preventing each individual
trom placing lis own construction on
these tactics that there is a s< hool of in
struction in the quarters on East street.
At stated times the petty officers are
called together and informed by one com
petent to do so the exact meaning of every
movement required and of the necessary
commands. If this was done in other
branches of the service it would result in
much good.
Then there is the lyceum, at which
lectures are to be delivered at least once a
month. The lirst of these was delivered
last Tuesday by A. H. Elliott of the sec
ond divi.ion. His subject was "The
Siege of Vicksbu.g by Land ami Water,"
and it is said by those wne heard it that it
was a masterly and most interesting and
instructive exposition from a staudpoint
of the army and the navy. The second of
these will be given on the evening of the
2d of March by Lieutenant Commander
louis H. Turner, who will talk on "The
Methods of Naval War.are, Past and
Present." He will dwell on the manner
of ship-fighting in the days of the Consti
tution ana La Guerriere, the Alabama and
the Kearsnrge, and the present methods.

THE SILVER MEDAL
WON BY GREELEY
Third District Rally of
the League of the
Cross.
i
i Young Men in Five Essays
Told Well the Cost of
Drunkenness.
Extracts From What the Speakers
Said â A Fine Audience and
Much Applause.
I
The League of the Cross of the Third
district held their rally at Metropolitan
Temple yesterday afternoon. It was en
joyed by a fine audience which havine
filled every seat overflowed, into the aisles
along tho side walls.
The main event on the programme was
the oratorical contest between tbe young
men representing the several parishes of
the third district on tbe general subject of
"What Drunkenness Costs," for the silver
medal. The winners of silver medals in i
the various districts are to compete finally j
for a gola medal next July. There was
also a musical programme.
The several parishes were represented \
as follows, and the young men spoke in
this order, which was deemed by lot:
Thomas Horan, St. Rose's.
James O'Donnell, St. Theresa's.
John Greely, St. Brendan's.
Paul Frateesa, All Hallows.
W. Hampton Sbadburne, St. Mary's.
Company H, League of tbe Cross Cadets j
of St. Brendan's parish, in fatigue uni
form, 115 strong, in command of Captain
J. J. Powers, First Lieutenant L. J. !
Healey and Second Lieutenant J. I*. Re- j
j-an, occupied seats on the platform. Tel
, chairman was Thomas G. Spillane. He
; was introduced by W. A. Breslin, grand j
, secretary of the league. He reviewed the â¢
i history of the order. Others who occupied
seats on the platform were Rev. Father P. !
O'Ryan, spiritual director of the league,
I and Rev. Father M. D. Connolly, pastor of
j St. Paul's Church. Tbe former delivered
I the invocation. All the parishes were
! largely represented in the audience and
; liberally applauded their young cham
pions. Following are extracts from the
essays delivered.
Thomas Horan said that "What Drunk
enness Costs'' can be answered by the
many starving children. Christ said no
j drunkard shall enter heaven. The drunk-
I ard wrones himself and his Goa. He
neglects his religious duties, public and
private. Drink is the greatest foe to tbe
church. How can God respect the man
I who does not respect himself? "We ad-
I monish Catholics engaged in selling liquor
j to consider tne danger of sin. Let them re
j remember tbat there is an avening heaven,
wnich will bring a terrible retribution.*'
Physical and mental wrecks, insane asy
lums, 'haritable institutions, the Coro
ner's office, the jails, show what drunken
ness costs."
James O'Donnell of St. Theresa's Parish
said drunkenness is the cause of nearly all
I evil. Fifty per cent of all crime is due to
liquor. He went extensively into statis- I
lies showing to what extent crime has its
inception in drink. But statistics left out
the great thing of allâ the loss of tbe soul
"The prime agent of vice is intemper
ance," said John Greeley, representing St.
Brendan's parish. He spoke without
manuscript. Lost manhood, lust, lost
womanhood and all otlier evils' were
created and lostered by liquor. Drunkards
begot drunkards. About 00,000 persons in
this country yield their lives to Bacchus.
Tbe world laments that bard times and
strikes are undermining society, but $156.
--000.000 more are spent for liquor than for
the necessaries of life.
"Eighty thousand paupers are now
wandering through the land. Thousands
of men, women and children are crying
out bitterly airainst the evil of intemper
ance. Drunkenness in this country leads
to 19 per cent or divorces. But Bacchus
could not always remain supreme, for
while there's life there's hope. Another
army is steadily being organized to meet
him and would draw their swords for
victory."
Paul F. Fratessa of All Hallows parish
was frequently interrupted by applause.
He said tbat in America the liie of the
inebriate is comparatively short and the
per.od of moderate drinking not so
marked. When a young man went out
into the battle of life not even parental
counsel could protect him Iron the temp
tation of the social class, the good com
panion and the saloon. He pictured in
excellent language the degradation of the
drunkard. I: each saloon in San Fran
cisco made but $1 per day the total
amount in one year would build 1200
homes at $1200 each.
W. H. Snadburne of St. Mary's parish
said that man since tbe earliest ages has
been prone to intoxication. Drunken
ness, even in the worst of Roman de
bauches, did not produce the maddening
influences of modern John Barleycorn.
The epidemic of drunkenness dates from
the close of the seventeenth century.
Then distillation came into use. The
speaker cited numerous instances of habit
ual intoxication among noted characters
of history. Retailers of gin were accus
tomed to bang out a sign in England stat- j
ing that their customers could be made
drunk for a penny and aead drunk for
twopence. Drinking was then universal
and a social vice in this country
and in England. Private families have
now much improved, but, he asked, how
about the public? He called attention to
the wide influence of saloons in modern
politics; said the Nation is debtuched
and there seemed to be no law to remedy
it. Yet the Knights of the Cross had mul
tiplied in tho face of the enemy.
Rev. Father Connolly also made an ad
dress. He highly complimented the !
young speakers on their subject matter
and tneir delivery. He said that if the
movement of the Leaeue of the Cross had
been started twenty-five years ago San
Francisco would have had an entirely
different set of young men to-day.
li was here announced that the judges*
thought the essay of John Greeley of St.
Brendan's parish was the best and he was
awarded the silver medal. The St. Bren
dan cadets and partisans loyally aud
rotisingly rose up and emitted their
parish yell. The nidges were Miss N. F.
Sullivan, John J. Barrett and Fred Jung.
Rev. Father O'Ryan also made som_
remarks, and others entertained the audi
ence as follows:
Vocal solo, George V. Wood; cornet solo,
M. Greunan; vocal solo, Miss Katharine Black ;
humorous vocal selections, J. C. O'Donnell;
accompanist. Miss M. Georgian!.
MRS. LILLIE MADE REPLY
j Answered Recent Criticisms o!
the R?v. Dr. Farrand on
Spiritualism.
: She Said Spiritual Belief C early Has
Its Foundation in the Carlstian
Bible.
The Society of Progressive Spiritualists
resumed public meetings last evening at
Scottish Hall, 105 Larkin street, after a
vacation of eight months. Mrs. R. S. Lii
ie, the noted inspirational m* dium of
j Boston, was speaker. A previous an-
I nouncement that Mrs. Lillie would reply
! to the attack recently made upon spirit
; ualism by tbe Rev. Dr. Farrand of How
! ard Presbyterian Church attracted a large
â¢ audience. William Rider, the president,
introduced Mrs. Lillie.
She stated that the influences control
| ling her desired to reply to the attack.
i She said spiritualism is as old as any reli
â  gion. What is known as modern spirit
ualism had its origin in Hydesville, N. V.,
through the mediumship of the Fox fam
ily, in the year 1848.
Men of scientific attainment have thor
oughly investigated the phenomena of
spiritualism, and when not absolutely
j convinced of the source of the manifesta
| tions have admitted that they could not
i account for them on any other than the
j spiritual hypothesis. Some stubbornly
declare them to be diabolism. Tbe speaker
I said that many reforms and advanced
! thoughts were directly traceable to spirit
! ualism. She said that if spiritualism was
| dependent upon any book for its founda
i tion, that book is the Bible. Spiritualism
j could get along without Christianity, but
â  Christianity could not get along without
i spiritualism, as the Bib is full of ac
l counts of spiritual manifestations.
Referring to the statement that the Fox
sisters at one time denied tbeir medium
ship Mrs. Lillie said that the Fox family
were all church members and the mother
a praying woman. If spiritualism was of
the devil why did not God answer that
good woman's prayers and suppress those j
early manifestations instead o. permitting
t them to spread like prairie fire all over
j the civilized world? Referring again to
the exposure of spiritualism by the Fox
girls th*- speaker said that Christianity
had its Judas and Peter, and spiritualism
had its Maggie and Kate.
The charge of fraud made by Dr. Far
rand the speaker did not deny. She said
that all things of value were counter
feited, and Presbyterianism would have
been had it been worth while. That
fraud -was practiced by some dishonest
persons claiming to be mediums spiritu
alists did not deny. The chnree ot infi
delity was answered by a quotation from
Scripture, "God is a spirit, ana whosoever
worships him must worship in spirit and
in truth."
At the close of the address Mrs. Lillie
gave an inspirational poem upon subjects
given by the audience. Mr. Lillie sang
some solos. The subject announced for
next Sunday evening waa, "The Bible
and Spiritualism."

FERRY-BOATS ARE
RAVING BAD LUCK
The Oakland Laid Up for
Repairs and the New
ark Breaks Down.
A Steamer That Has Been Laid
Up tor Years Put in Com
mission.
She Will Carry Freight Until the
0:d Timers Are Ready for
Work Once Mare.
The Southern Pacific's ferry steamers
have been playing in nard luck lately and
in consequence th traveling public has
had to suffer. Some days aco the Oak
land gave out and had to be taken off the
route for an overhauling. She was so foul
tnat the limit set on her steam gauge by
the Government inspectors of hulls and
boilers had to be exceeded in order to
make time. The Newark was accordingly
taken from the creek route and put in her
place and the old Garden City was hauled
out of retirement and put into the freight
business.
Yesterday tbe Newark broke down. On
one of the early morning trips a crank
pin cracked and the steamer had to reach
her slip under a slow bell.
Then the trouble began. The Bay City
was ordered to take the place of the New
ark, and the cooks and waiters, barkeep
ers and bootblacks had to pack up their
stock in trade and move in quick order.
The men on the Newark went aboard the
Bay City and those on the latter vessel
transferred themselves, bag and baggage,
to the Ei Capitan. For a couple of trips
contusion reigned, and frequently when a
man ordered a chop he got a steak, ana
when he ordered whisicy straight he was
just a-* likely as not to get rum or brandy.
The El Capitan is a small but fast boat,
and on several trips yesterday afternoon
she was very much overcrowded.
It will be several days before the Newark
is repaired, and in the meantime the
people on the narrow-guage route will
have to put up with the overcrowding on
El Capiian. To fill up the want on the
creek route the old Thoroughfare, which
has not done any steady work for years,
will be tit in commission and will run
between San Francisco and the foot of
Broadway until the regular steamers are
in commission again. The people of Oak
land and Alameda will thus get tbeir
freight as usual, and the only sufferers
will be the traveling public.
The youngest vessel in the fleet men
tioned is the Bay City, and she was built
in San Francisco as far back as 1873. The
next in point of age is the Newark, which
was also built in Sun Francisco in 1877,
and, strange to say, she celebrated her
birthday by breaking down. The Oakland
was built in Oakland in 1875. the Thor
oughfare in San Francisco in 1871 and the
smart little El Capitan in 1868. It will
thus be seen that there can be no cause
for wonderment when an occasional break
down among the Southern Pacific's
steamers is reported.

MIGHT STOP CARS
TO THE PRESIDIO
| Effect of a Two- and- a- j
Half -Cent Fare on
Union Street.
Streetcar Employes Think the
Companies Would ReduCÃ
Their Wages.
Assistant Superintendent Collins on
Lower Fare and Its Result
on Employes.
Street-car men are much interested in
legislative proceedings at Sacramento.
Like many other citizens, the gripman,
the motorman and the conductor do not
get up a ball hour before breakfast and
while the coffee is getting hot peruse with
vivid interest legislative proceedings in the
morning paper, but just now the amount
of bis wages is tied up in the Braun
nart bill proposing to reduce streetcar
fare to 2% cents between 6 and 8 o'clock
in tbe morning and 5 and 7 o'clock in the
evening. The men say that if the bill
passes the hrst thine: the streetcar com
panies will do will be to cut their pay,
i and it might result in a walk-out on some ,
j of the roads of the City if it did not become
1 general.
Assistant Superintendent Dennis Col
lins of the Union-street Railway said last
evening:
"The price of coal and bread always re- j
mains about the same. If the bill reduc- |
i ing fares becomes a law I feel that wages \
will be reduced. The wage-earner always
teels tirst the reduction ot expenses. Fuel j
and food prices are not cut."
Assistant Superintendent Collins did
not say there would be a strike on th .
Presidio line, but be added:
"I am satistied that if fares are reduced '
to '_._; cents the line will have to be closed i
od. The company is not making any
money. We have been carrying an aver
age number of passengers less per day
during each of the last five years. As
compared with five years ago, we are now I
carrying 2000 less passengers per day. i
The population is not increasing; it is de- i
creasing, and there are not enough people
to make up the difference. Ido not tee
how the California- street or the Sutter- '
street line could stand a 2};-cen fare. One
thing that we could do would be to issue I
no more transfers. All we get now for
transfers is 2\Â£ cents, and we certainly
could not carry a passenger for IJ4 cents."
â¢'Have you received any instructions
to tbe effect that the line will be shut
down if the 2__>cent bill nasses?"
"No, I have not. I don't need any in
structions on that point. It is self-evi
dent to me."
"What are the men on the line paid
now?"
"At the rate of $2 15 per day; formerly
$2 25. They have an hour off for dinner."
Superintendent Vining of the Market-
J street Railway Company recently said
S that they pay their men over 2% cents of
! every fare, and that all the company
| makes on each litre is a fraction of a cent.
A board on tbe side of a house at
Forbes, Mo., was removed the other day
I by the owner, as it appeared warped. He
I found a hive in the wall and 125 pounds of
I honey. The bees had entered through a
[ knothole.

THE CALL PUBLISHED '
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During 1896. j
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during 1896.
It is to be remembered that during 1896 the
Examiner published approximately 800 inches of
illegal lottery advertisements, or which TnE Call
did not and would not publish one.
The monarch of the falters turn doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of inches of adver-
tising during the past year by doping and deceiv-
ing advertisers through false at.d arrogant asser-
tions of the Character of the -foregoing fake. It-
would seem, however, from the facts that the
merchants as a rule have not been misled by its
fraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that Its books are open to
Inspection, but we suggest that it Inspect its own
books before it ventures UDon the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
exrosnre of this fake led the Examiner to drop lv \
In this the Examiner was discreet, and If It is wise j
it will make no more such bold attempts to
deceive the public.
The proposed tariff seem;, to be as full of
good things as a plum pudding.
There are too many people who are

There were more than ten thousand
prophets who predicted McKinley's Cabi

In less than a month Cleveland will, for
once in his life, gladden the hearts of the
whole people. He will turn his office over
to McKinley.
A society has been organized in New
York to prevent premature burials, and it
is needless to say that lots of Democratic
politicians are interested in it.
Eminent electricians are discussing the
feasibility of telegraphing without wires,
but in the Examiner office that sort of
thing is done every day just like any old

It is reported that at the present time
there is not a town of note in the United

The bellboy who set fire to a Boston

The estimate that by annexing the whole

THE END IS NEAR.
It must be evident to discerning minds that the end of Willie Hearst's wild and
j reckless career in journalism is at hand. The wasteful extravagance with which be
| has thrown about tbe millions which his father left has brought him finally to the
bottom of the chest, or else has caused his surviving parent and her advisers to realize
tbat bis lavishness must cease. For the past several months it has been evident that
the Examiner has been making a desperate effort to keep up appearances and to de
ceive the public into believing that it was other than a shadow of its former self.
' During the past year its local managers have frequently exposed its shaky condition
' by the desperation with which they have exhausted expedients to get for it money
which the estate of its owner's father was either unable or unwilling to supply.
It is plain that the end is near and that, following in the footsteps of others hav
ing weak moral natures and being overtaken with adverse fortune, it has been driven
to the trade of the outlaw at last. It is a part of the history of fakers and ellows
who live by their wits that they run for a season through a course of apparently
unclouded successes. Trading upon that trait of human nature which is either fond of
being deceived or is slow to believe it is so, the faker temporarily succeeds, the impostor
flourishes, the qnack prows sleek upon his earnings from the credulous, and the black,
mailer waxes fat upon ill-gotten gains. So it has been with the Examiner. Under
the oj. r.erFh'p of "Willie Hearst, and by access to bis apparently unlimited exchequer,
its fakers, impostors, quacks and blackmailers have been enabled to make a brilliant
display of tbeir literary and journalistic arts, and if now and then they have been
caught in a clumsy fake or a too transparent imposition, they have been swift to
turn to some new trick and thus divert the public mind from the point of their
offending.
The faker, fraud and impostor always finds an end to his career of public deceit
and the blackmailer's course of extortion is speedily run. It was Kossuth who elo
quently declared that "the people may be blinded for a season, but when their eyes
are once opened they can be no longer deceived." During the past year the eyes of
the people of California have been fully opened to the career of fraud and filth and
folly and falsehood which the Examiner was running in their midst. They saw it
i convicted of willful lying with reference to its circulation when the Chronicle gave the
pnDlic an object lesson of its fraud in this respect which will not soon be forgotten,
! Within the past few days The Call has proven it guilty of an equally gross and willful
j lie with respect to the amount in Inches of its advertising during the year 1396, and
j has shown tbat instead of publishing 5964 inches more advertising than any other San
| Francisco newspaper during that year, according to its boast, it in fact pnblished 3023
j inches less than did The Call. The silence of the Examiner in the presence of this
j fact is as eloquent as any denial of its truth would be false.
In addition to these two convictions the public has been presented with & long
1 array of confessed iniquities on the part of the Examiner. It has long since ceased to
i deny that it blackmailed the Southern Pacific Company out of |22,0C0. It haa not
| aared to dispute the charge that it has often attempted and sometimes succeeded in
j making similar levies of blackmail upon corporations having large interests and men
j possessed of means in various parts of California. In fact, there is hardly a section
Jin the entire State whose industries or whose individuals have not in one form or
i another paid tribute to its predatory habits. Whether the revenue derived from these
| extortions has been devoted to lessening its constant drain upon the Hearst estate
1 does not appear, but the recent increase in its desperate attempts at blackmail clearly
i indicate that herealter they are expected to be its principal source of supply.
The Examiner has taken to the road. It openly intimates that there is not a large
j business interest in or about San Francisco which it will not waylay. It is devoting
1 its columns to the advocacy of every cinch bill now pending before the Legis
j lature. It gives notice to the State generally that it is out lor coin. It c!ain*B of
1 course to be a Claude Duval among highwaymen and to.intend only the robbery of
j the rich, but the truth is that the Examiner has always robbed the rich and poor in
' discriminate^ whenever necessary to satisfy its need of money or its greed of gain.
Whiie it has been levying blackmail upon rich corporations and timid individuals it
has also by premium fakes, by lottery ads, by pretenses of charity and by "yards of
pups" been drawing their scanty doilars from the pockets of the poor.
What do the people of California think of the career of this outlaw among news
papers, this convicted fraud and faker in the field of journalism? this confessed black
mailer of business interests, this admitted supporter of every assailant of property
; and of the right to possess ii? What do the men who have large commercial and
. financial interests in California think of their chances of safety from the attack of this
â  highwayman? How much longer will they endure its presence in their midst and its
pollution in their homes? We think not long. While the funds of the Hearst estate
| held out men might well hope that the fellowship of wealth would finally bring its
â  reckless owner back to decency and might well hesitate to organize against a common
j enemy, but that time is past. The Hearst estate has been drained.
The reckless youth having exhausted his patrimony has either himself taken to
| the road or has let loose his local gang to follow their own natural bent in that direc
i tion. The Examiner must hereafter live by blackmail if it lives at all. It is the plain
j and present duty of men who have property interests to protect and reputations to
j preserve to unite in seeing to it that its career as a highwayman shall be short.
"The earth hath bubbles as the water hath." The Examiner bubble is about to
burst.
THE UffIVEBSITY.
Among the bills before the present Leg
islature is one which provides a levy of
a tax of 1 cent on each $100 of value of the
taxable property of the State for the use
and support of the University of Califor
nia. This bill merits the approval of the
people, and should have cordial support
in both houses of the Legislature. The
measure is directly in the interests of the
State, and the proposed tax is one which
will be cheerlully borne by all who have
any regard for the true welfare of the com
monwealth and the prosperity of its peo
ple.
The demand for university education in
California has outgrown the preparations
made for supplying it by the State. In
1887, the last time t_e Legislature made
provision for the support of the university,
the colleges at Berkeley had 306 students.
There are now 1554 students at Berkeley
alone, besides the 720 students in the pro
fessional colleges in San Francisco. The
number of students, in fact, has increased
more than lour times as fast as the in
come, and the university now lacks suffi
cient instructors, classrooms and appara
tus to supply the demand of the youth
of the State for the education it was in
tended to provide.
At the present time there is not a hall
on the university campus which will hold
all the students at once. For the large
gatherings which are from time to time
necessary tents have been set up. The
classrooms are overcrowded. Moreover,
the present force of instructors cannot
properly attend to the work. Some of the
classes contain from two to three hundred
students, and it is impossible to efficiently
instruct and examine this number in the
hours available for recitation.
It must be borne iv. mind that, while the
university bears the title of the State, it
has been a creation of private generosity
rather than of State munificence. Of all
the contributions to the university that
made by the State has been only about
one-fourth of the total amount. It is
right and fitting, therefore, that the State
should do more for the institution which
it has founded, and toward which it has
attracted the attention of generous and
public -spirited citizens as well as of
students.
It is fair to assume that if the State does
more for the university the contributions
from private fortunes will be larger. In
dividual generosity will be stimulated aim
encouraged by Stale munificence. Let us
once raise the university to the position it
ought rightly to occupy in California and
we can confidently count upon generous
aid to be given by men of wealth and cul
ture from ail sections of the common
wealth. As a matter of expediency, there
fore, as well as of justice, the proposed bill
should be adopted. The tax will be only
10 cents to the man who is taxed $1000, or
less than 1 cent a month. This sum is so
small that all can afford to pay it, and we
repeat that all who take an intelligent
interest in the progress of the State will
willingly do so.
The New York Herald has turned its at
tention from politics long enough to ar
range a calendar for courtship and mar
riage. It allows the young man three
months of attention before he proposes;
the girl is to have three months of reflec
tion before she accepts; three months of
adoration are to follow the engagement
and then the day is to be set. Three
months of preparation come next and then
the wedding. The whole affair is begun
and finished inside of a year. It is a daisy
calendar.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1597.
FABMEF.S' INSTITUTE.
One cf the notable events of tbe week
will be the holding in this City of a
Farmers' Instituie under the direction
of the University of California. It is to
be held at the Academy of Sciences hall
and will continue during the evenings of
Wednesday and Thursday. Later on
there is to be another session on February
24 and 25, and it seems probable that \
these will be the beginning of a series
which will be a permanent feature of our
civic life lor the future.
The session to be held this week will be
opened on the evening of Wednesday by
an address by Professor E. W. Hilgard
on "The Work of the College of Agricul
ture." There will also be an address en
"Highways," illustrated with stereopticon
views by Marsdon Manson, State High
way Commissioner. The programme for
Thursday evening will be opened by an
address by Mrs. Harriet M. Conness on
"The Profitable Uses of Small Pieces of
Land." This will be followed by an ad
dress by Mr. Alfred Holmann on "City
Farmers' Clubs."
The programme, it will be seen, is one
calculated to be of interest not only to
those residents of the City who are owners
of farms, orchards or other rural holdings
in the interior of the State, but to citizens
generally. There is every reason, there
fore, for believing that the institute win
prove successful in point of numbers who
attend, as well as profitable to those who
are in a position to apply the lessons they
learn from it.
It is estimated that the number of
owners of cultivated farms is greater in
San Francisco than in any other county
in California. Many of our people own
country homes of greater or less extent
and will derive practical advantages from
the instruction which will be giveu at the
various meetings of the institute. There
will be a particular interest in the paper
by Mrs. Conness, since a large number of
City residents either own small pieces of
land or desire to do so, and will be inter
ested in learning; how such tract* may bo
made profitable.
The institute will, we trust, be largely
attended. It is designed lor the public
benefit and it depends upon the people
themselves to make good use of it. The
State University has done ail in its power
by bringing the lectures to us and it will
be our own fault if we do not profit by
them. ,
BEET SUGAR.
The latest number of tbe Pacific Rural
Press contains much interesting matter
about the culture of sugar beets and their
manufacture into sugar, and among other
articles a long and elaborate one by Mr.
Gerberding, president of the San Fran
cisco Produce Exchange, in which the
profitableness cf this industry in Califor
nia is clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Gerberding tells us that although
the soil and climate of California are well
adapted to the production of the sucar
beet only about one-twentieth of 1 per
cent of the State's area is devoted to its
culture, and we are paying $6,000,000 an
nually to foreigners for sugar we could
just as well produce at home. In the his
tory of the development of the industry
In Europe, he shows how carefully it has
been fostered by the Governments of the
countries where it flourishes, and this is
the point to which attention should be in
sistently called.
It is well known that we have a soil
richly adapted to the root and a big de
mand for the product in the home mar
ket. These advantages will stay with us
without any effort on our part. There is,
however, a third advantage needed in
order to make the other two fully Â«ifeoi
ive. This third desideratum is the estab
lishment of such Government protection
as will leave our farmers un handicapped
in the competition with the foreign pro
ducers, who have such bountiful Govern
mental aid.
For the farmer to avail himself of his
opportunities of soil and market he must
have the co-operation of large capital, as a
properly equipped sugar factory is a very
costly thing. In order that capital may
be Induced to take the risks of a vast in
vestment in manufacturing plants it is
necessary to put the profitableness of
sugar-making on an equality with other
great manufacturing enterprises by a
fairly proportioned protective tariff.
Otherwise tne capital, jufit as naturally as
water runs down hill, will seek a use for
it.elf in enterprises less directly ad
vantageous to the farmers of California.
Perhaps the strongest argument in the
armory of the opponents of a protective
tariff .s the claim that it singles out spe
cial interests for favoritism, and there can
be no surer way to remove the opposition
of some farmers to the Republican policy
than to widen the ways in which the
farmer is made a strict participant in the
benefits given. Protection should be
equally distributed to all American inter
ests and in no way can it be made more
beneficial to a large number of farmers
than by affording such protection to the
production of sugar as will open for them
a new and profitable industry.
Thanks to the industrial enterprise and
public spirit of Claus Spreckels California
is well assured of the skill, enerey and
capital needed to develop the industry
within her limits. He ia at present time
constructing what will be the greatest
sugar manufacturing plant In the world.
The one thing required, therefore, is pro
tection, and for that we can rightly look
with confidence to the coming Republican
Congress.
A PITIFUL SPECTACLE.
Poor old Ambrose Bierce is really one
of the most pitiful objects within the pub
lic view. By degrading to the ignoble
uses of a disreputable newspaper talents
which rightly employed might earned
him a permanent place In tbe esteem of
the worthy, he has come at last to the
mangy slate of every snarleyow and lies in
the dust snapping slobbering jaws and
fangless gums at every passer-oy. When
a richly deserved kick brings him
yelping to his feet he recognizes
bis impotency and flies to bis un
sold edition of "Black Beetles in
Amber" for venom to spew at bis assail
ant. The "Post. Scriptum," which the
worn out snarler adds to his former for
gotten growl aptly illustrates bow far he
has fallen from his former estate. If
there ever was a time when Ambrose
Bierce needed a muzzle it is now, not to
pr vent his bite, but to conceal the evi
dences of his driv ling decay.
COAST EXCHANGES.
XV. L. Thatcher has sold the Nordhoff Ojai to
Randolph R. Freeman. No better advertise
ment than this pretty and bright little paper
could be conceived ol for the beautiful and
fruitful Ojai Valley.
The Los Ban os Enterprise wound up Its sev
enth volume last week. It is a successful
paper, an I that is largely because It is sin
cerely devoted to the best interests of the com
munity in which it Is published.
The Fortuna Advance has enlarged from a
four-page to an eight-page paper, and has add
ed to its features a number of special de
partments that go to make it a most complete
and thoroughly interesting publication.
The California Review is the new name
adopted for the excellent magazine which has
heretofore been known as the Santa Clara.
Carrie Stevens Walter Is still the leading
spirit and the clever lady Is ably assisted by
Mr. and Mrs. A. XV. J. Gibbs.
The Sausalito yews is on the high road ol
success. It Is a well-conducted paper and
very Influential in Marin Connty affairs. This
week the construction ot a new home for the
Nemm will be commenced, and when it is com
pleted a new power press will be introduced
and the various departments will bo lighted
by electricity. '
The Santa Clara __w devotes a special edi
tion to a description of that town, showing it
to be quite a commercial, educational, railroad
and geographical center, and picturing its
steady and sure growth. The paper cannot
fail to attract attention [abroad, and Santa
Clara will doubtless reap material benefits
from advertisement.
That excellent paper, the Petaiuma Argus,
has just celebrated its forty-third birthday.
In opening the new volume the editor makes
these observations : "It has not been much of
a money-making concern, though its pres
ent proprietors have had enough to
eat and clothing to wear ever since
they took hold of it thirty-six years
ago. The proprietors are still older than
the paper and they would like to turn it over
to some younger bloods. Tom Thompson and
brother Westonâ the founders of the Argusâ
had the sense to get out in time to make some
money for their old age, and we are glad to
know that they are both now in clover."
In an editorial about "California Homes"
the Willows Promoter makes these very perti
nent suggestions:
"He who buys land in California secures a
home from which he will be rewarded with a
perpetual income ior the maintenance of him
self and family, a sure dependence case of
sickness, an unfailing annuity to his heirs
after death. It is better than a savings bank,
more profitable than life insurance, and 100
to 160 acres of good productive soil will se
cure the home, the annuity. The rude win
ters of the East are wearing people out; they
love the sunshine and flowers that are only
found in this grand old State of California.
In fact, there are more hour* of sunshine In
California than in any place else except
heaven."
The Merced Star, uuder the caption of "A
New Industry," Btates that P. Dupont of Mer
ced proposes to furnish a market for a great
quantity of fruit heretolore wasted. "He
points out that fruitralsers experience consid
erable loss even in good business years be
cause much oi their product becomes too ripe
for shipment. Being a practical chemist and
skilled in the distilling of liquors from fruit
In his native country, Mr. Dupont is now or
ganizing a company to utilize this waste in
the manufacture of excellent wines, bran
dies and other liquors, which can be made
from every variety of fruit. Mr. Dupont has
entered a field hitherto uncultivated in this
section. A plan which provides a market for
what has hitherto been considered as waste
product is one deserving of investigation and
promotion. Such an industry/it would seem,
should be a paying investment, as it is a known
fact that good fruit liquors are a profitable
and salable article always in demand, a
class of products that gains 07 age, instead of
being valueless if not speedily consumed."
The Eureka Standard, after quoting an edi
torial utterance of The Call to the effect that
"what the voters of the State most desire in
the State Legislature is, first, letrenchment;
second, good roads, and third, more retrench
ment," remarks: "This is putting it in few
words. The Legislature, If it shall do the will
of the people, will cut down Stare expendi
tures and remodel the county government act
so that the expenditures may be lessened in
every county ln the State. Taxpayers have a
just cause of complaint, when the taxes on
their property, as.essed at its full valuation .
range irom Spi 70 to $2 73 on each $100 of
valuation. The most expensive thing in the
world to the farmers ana general public is
poor roads. The transportation of farm pr od
vets in this State over wagon roads alone costs
the people three to five times what it would
oost on thoroughly good roads. The saving to
the people which good roads would . make
would in ten years build macadamized roads
or paved streets wherever dirt road-* are now
used. Let the Legislature cut off needless ex
penses, get down to true economy in all pub
lic business and then give us good roads, or a
law that will eventually create them."
NEWS UF FOREIGN NAVIES
The Terrible, under 2045 horsepower and
49 revolution. of her twin propellers, attains
as peed of 10.3 knots.
Two torpedo-boat destroyer*, the Quail and
the Trasher, lately added to the British navy,'
maintained a speed during their three hours'
trial of 30.12 and 30.03 knots respectively.
Accidents in foreign navies are as frequent
as In our uavy, but not so widely advertised.
The Aurora, belted cruiser, came near collid
ing with another British war vessel at Ports
mouth, last month, owing to a breakdown of
her steering gear, a couple of days niter .-he
started on her steam trials, when the feed
pumps of her after boilers broke down and the
snip had to go to the dockyard lor another
week of repairs.
A remarkably ingenious automatic machine
gun has been adopted in the Chilean navy.
The gas developed by the explosion of the
powder is utilized far operating the breech
action and feed mechanism of the arm and
all the operations of loading, firing, extract
ing, ejecting and cocking are automatically
performed. It has the further advantage of
beiiig simple in construction, and the entire
gun consists of only thirty-one parts.
Portugal has ordered two cruisers, wood
sheathed, of 1800 tons, with the moderate
draught of 13 feet 9 inches. They are to have
triple expansion engines, water-tube boilers
and a sea-speed under natural draught for six
hours of 15 knots. The armament includes
two 5.9-inch, four 4.7-inch, eight 47 millime
ters, two machine guns and two torpedo
tubes. The guns are all rapid-flrers and the
ammunition will be 150 rounds for the lerger
guns and 300 rounds for each of the 46 milli
meter guns.
Creusot's armor-plate works, France, has
produced a plate of very excellent quality for
the Danish Government. A turret plate 7.87
inches thick, intended for the Skjold was
tried at the works with the following results:
Five shots from a 5 91-inch Schneider gun
with chrome-steel projectiles weighing 112
pounds were fired, with a velocity ranging
irom 2030 to 2076 feet per second, against the
sample plate of face-hardened nickel steeL
None Of the shots penetrated the target, as in
every case the projectiles were stopped and
smashed, aud the backing of the plate, when
stripped, showed no indentation.
The German naval estimates for 1897-98 call
for $32,262,225, or $10,779,625 more than for
the preceding fiscal year. Of this amount $9.
--893,885 is denominated as "extraordinary ex
penditures," embracing new ships, guns, torpe
does, etc. Out of this sum the German Admir
alty proposes to proceed with the construction
of an armor-clad of 11,000 tons to replace the
Koenic Wilhelm. The vessel will be on the
type of the Frederick the Great and will be
built by contract at Kiel, at an estimated cost
of $3,400,000, exclusive of her armament.
This cost is nearly equal to that of the United
States battleships Indiana, Massachusetts and
Oregon, contracted for in 1890. In addition
to the armored ships the Admiralty proposes
to build two second-class cruisers, simi.ar to
live now in course of construction, and also a
fourth-class cruiser, two gunboats and several
torpedo-boats.

None Would Mar tlio Pago of Life if

Rev. Dr. Spalding's text at the morning

yesterday was: "Whatsoever ye do in
word or died do all in the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God
and the Father by him."
He said that every word and act of the
Christian should be spoken and done to
God's glory; that the Christian's life is
just as much consecrated to God as any
cburch is.
He told of how the material on which
writin -s were made in olden times was so
valuable that by some chemical process
the same was used over and over again,
and that foul slandering words have been
erased and the words of Christ's sermon on
the mount found underneath.
He also spoke of a painter who was so
dissatisfied with the painting of a sin-
SCarred face that he erased it from the
canvass, and when he had done so found
the face of the child Jesus uuderneatn.
These instances he likened to our lives,
and said that when a child is baptized its
life is pure and spotless, but that when
temptation and sin comes Durily and
spotlessness is covered up.
He aiso said that we should watch our
words as well as our acts, and that if they
were spoken in the name of Jesus no
slandering words would mar the pages of
life.

We must always remember that the Bible is
for spiritual use. Its books are not to be used
as bullets, but as bread loaves. It is to com
fort. If it fails here It fails everywhere. The
psalms have been a spiritual consolation to all
classes of P T opl When the so:diers were im
prisoned at Lucknow they awaited in patience I
for the Highlanders and took comfort in these
immortal psalms. When Cromwell addressed
hU army he quoted one of the Psalms of David.
When savonaro:a was preach. ng in Florence
and Lincoln was bearing the burden of war;
when priests were ministering on fields of cat
tie and saints were contending with foes;
when men have laid away their dead and
cathedrals and churches have resounded with
praise these psalms were used to give spiritual
interpretation to the proioundest feelings of
the human soul.

It Is a "Natural Process, Says Key. J. S.
David.
The Rev. J. s. David, in a lectur6 on "The
Resurrection and the World Beyond," given at
Washington Hail, Red Men's building, yester
day morning, claimed that the resurrection of
man was not a return irom the grave, but the
emerging of the spiritual body from the phy
sical at the aeatn of the latter, and the
awakening to consciousness and activity in
the spiritual world. Man, he said, is a spir
itual being, temporarily clothed with a physi
cal body by means of which he is Draught into
sensible contact with physical nature.
As we journey through this vale 01 shadows,
he said, it is always a help and a joy to realize
that what. we call death is a gateway to a
broader and a deeper lit.-, and that the resur
rection alter death is as natural a process as
the birth of a chicken from the egg or the un
folding of torn from the husk.

SONS OF ERIN
WILL CELEBRATE
St. Patrick's Day to Be
Observed in an Appro
priate Manner.
Patriot c Address by a Well-
Known Irish
Priest.
Rev. James McFedden Tells of Ire
land's Hope of Relief From
America
St. Patrick's day will be celebrated in
regal style by the Irish residents of this
City. Ju_t what form the celebration will
take has not yet been decided, but at a
meeting of the St. Patrick's Day conven
tion, held at Knights of the lied Branch
Hall yesterday afternoon, a spirit waa
evinced which is bound to result in great
things; and a committee of arrangements
composed of men of intelligence, experi
ence and energy was appointed.
Then, was a large attendance of dele
gates at the convention. John ilulhera
presided, and J. J. Moran acted as secre
tary.
A communication was received from the
Gaelic Literary Society stating that T. J.
Maliett, J. P. Haggerty, J. M. McLaughl
hn and William Desmond had been ap
pointed delegates to the convention. A.
similar communication was received from
the County Monaghan Social Club, nam
ing as delegates Thomas Galnford, James
J. Connolly, Arthur iicQuaid, John Mc-
Quaid and Thomas Madden. The com
mittee on credentials declared those
named entitled to seats in the convention.
The chairman suggested the following
committee of arrangements, which was
indorsed by the convention: Jeremiah
Deasey (chairman), David J. Costeilo,
Frank Conklin, P. H. lynn, John Dev
any, J. A Foley, J. P. O'tonner, J. D.
Roche, M. Morrissey, John P. Henry, T.

William Mulvin, John Gainey, John P.
Dtgnan, Jeremiah Kelleher, M. H. Mc-
Cafferty, Captain M. J. Wren, Charles
McCrystal and J. C. Ryan.
Resolutions of sorrow and condolence
respecting the death of Daniel Hanlon, a
former president of the convention, were
read and adopted.
Owing to the resignation of T. R. Ban
nerman as trustee of the convention's
funds, the election of a successor was in
order, and John Mulhera was unani
mously chosen.
M. Cooney was then called upon for a
speech. He made a brief patriotic ad
dress, in which he referred eulogistically
to the Irish residents, many of whom are
now deceased, who had labored earnestly
to make former St. Patrick's day celebra
tions a success. Wniie he was speaking
Rev. James McFadden, the patriotic priest
who was for some time confined in Derry
jail for expressing obnoxious sentiments
to the Tory Government, entered the
room. He was greeted with hearty ap
plause, and at the conclusion of Mr.
Cooney's remarks he was asked to speak.
"I certainly have a great desire," he
said, "to be an interested listener to the
deliberations which will result in a grand
celebration of the 17th oi March, '97. I
only hope that the celebration will be in
keeping with the affairs here in the past.
I am j interested in these celebrations
as an humble Irish priest who has tried â¢
to do his duty to his people as occasion
arose. My lot was cast in stormy times
and I, of course, attained some notoriety
from having be n marked out for the per
secution of the Tory government. I have
no doubt the Tory government is still
keeping an eye on me, and is very ill
pleased to find with what cordiality I am
being received by the sons of Ireland in
the city of St. Francis.
"There is something of a lull now In
Irish affairs owing to the large Tory ma
jority in the Government, but we are hop
ing something will happen to England
that will result to our advantage. Our
chief hope is in foreign complications,
and one of the principal places to which
we look hopefully is the land of the stars
and stripes, but it begins to look as
though it were getting tinctured with
Toryism."
The reverend gentleman concluded by
referring gratefully to the warm welcome
he had received in San Francisco from the
Irish people.
P. M. McGusbin followed with an in
tensely patriotic address, in which he re
ferred to Father McFadden as "the lion of
the north, the patriotic priest of Derry
parish." He suggested that Father Mc-
Fadden should be given a public recep.
tion.
The convention will meet again next
Sunday afternoon.

LOST HIS TIES
AND WAS FINED
Captain Higgins of the Ex
celsior Had to Pay for
a Lost Cargo.
Mexican Cu-tom. Law; Permit
No Surplus and No
Shortage.
T.ie Fact That the Gicds Were
WasheJ Ovrboird in a Storm
Is N > Excuse.
Captain Higgins of the steam schooner
Excelsior has not a very exalted opinion
of Mexicans or the Mexican methods of
handling American vessels. The rule in
that Republic is to fine a man if he be
short in the goods called for by his mani
fest, and a fine is also imposed If he has
mora aboard than the bill of lading calls
for.
On the way down the coast tho Excel
sior was caught in a hurricane and 1200
railroad ties that formed part of her deck
load and nearly all of the starboard bul
warks were washed away.
The fact that the steam schooner had
been in a storm did not cut any figure in
the case and the Mexican authorities pro
ceeded to fine Captain Higgins for not
bringing his lull cargo into port. Heap- i
pealed the matter to the American Consul j
and finally the matter was settled to the
satisfaction of all concerned.
While discussing the matter on the |
Steuart-street wharf yesterday, a certain j
Custom-house officer remarked to Captain |
Higgins: "Why, you were in luck. You I
know the schooners Martha W. Tuft and j
Czar? Well, you should bear the captains I
of those vessels talk. Both of them
loaded railroad ties for Mexico and the !
Tuft left here ten ties short, and the cap- j
tain of the Czar found that when his cargo
was all aboard and tallied that ere was
still tea ties on the wharf. He took them
aboard, as the stevedore told him they
had been left over from the other
schooner.
"Now. what do you think happened?
When the Martha W. Tuft reached her
destination the captain was fined $.0 in
Mexican money for being ten railroad tie-,
short, and when the Czar got in, a few
days later, Captain Olsen was fined $50 for
having ten railroad ties more aboard than
histnanifest called for. Both the captains
protested, bnt that was all the good it did
them and the fine had to be paid."
Uncle Sam nets even with the Mexican
authorities, however. The Excelsior
brought up over 400 tons of salt from Car- j
men Island on which duty will be col
lected, while salt from Liverpool comes in |
free. "There is a large salt lake in the j
island," said Captain Higgins, "and it i
only takes a short time to scoop up four
or five hundred tons with a dredger; in
fact, the island iB nearly allincrusted with
salt, and would make a company's for
tune were it only in the vicinity of San
Francisco."
After discharging the Excelsior will
probably make another trip to Mexico
with railroad ties and bring back another
cargo of salt.
THE SCHOONER VINE SAFE.
At Least That Is the Information
Given to "Captain" Burns
by a Medium.
"Captain" Burns, who makes his head
quarters with the J. F. Cunningham Com
pany, on Clay street, near East, is author
ity for tbe statement tbat the schooner
Vine, over which considerable anxiety is
felt, is all right and will be heard irom in
a few days. According to him the chro
nometer is out of order and the vessel in
stead of being near the Carolines is not
within 500 miles of Kusai. Ue is a be
liever in spiritualism and asserts that a
medium described the vessel and told him
exactly where she was.
The Vine left here on June 10 last and
while in one of the Central American
ports the chronometer got out of oraer.
Captain Luttrell could not procure an
other and had to make his way to Corinto
with the aid of his watch. At the latter
port he secured a chronometer and sailed
for his regular cruise in the southern seas.
From that day to this the schooner has
not been beard from and Captain Mellan
der, the company's agent in the Carolines,
had to co to Hongkong to lay in a supply
of provisions on account of the non-ar
rival of tbe schooner.
"I know that the Vine is overdue," said
Burns yesterday, "but nevertheless I am
as confident that she is afloat and that
all are well aboard as I am that 1 am
alive. A friend of mine, while in a
trance, saw the Vine, described her to me,
and told me that the next steamer from
China would bring good news from her."
J. F. Cunningham, wbo is the _:_. it >t
the vessel, is hoping that Burns is correct,
and is anxiously awaiting the arrival of
the Occident! and Oriental Company's
Doric on the 14th Inst.
Work on the steamer Portland (late the
Haytian Republic) is being rushed, and in
a few days tbe new cabins and all the
woodwork will be finished. New boilers
are to be put in position, and the old ves
sel will be as cood as new. When all the
chances are made the Portland will be put
on the Alaska route in opposition to the
steamers Queen and City of Toneka. She
will connect with the stern-wheel steamer
P. B. Weare at St. Michaels, the latter
carrying freight and passengers up the
Yukon River.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company
will go extensively into the cannery busi
ness next spring, lt has a number of
establishments in Alaska at present, but
in a few weeks a vessel will be fitted out
with a full cannery plant, and will go to
Chilkat River. There the buildings will
be put up, and everything will be in readi
ness as soon as the salmon begin to run.
Tne merchants in the vicinity of Davis
and Clay streets will be delighted when
they reach their respective places of busi
ness to-day. The recent heavy rains
turned the street into a miniature laKe
and business was at a standstill nearly ail
day ..atuiday. Early in the day one ofthe
dealers hung out the following* sign : "A
liferaft given away with each dollar pur
chase." Another merchant immediately
took the hint ar.d put the following, iii
the shape of a sail, on a plank and set it
adrift: "Good fishing in this pond. For
permission apply to tne Superintendent

SERMONS ON
EMOTIONALISM
IN
RELIGION
Wrt
Wells Supports Jordan.
At the Second Unitarian Church last
night Rev. A. J. Wells recognized the in
terest attaching to the Jordan controversy
by preach, a sermon entitled: "The
Troubled Waters of Religion." His text
was from St. .John, v:i: "For an angel
went down at a certain season into the
pool and troubled the water; whosoever
then first after the troubling of the water
stepped in was made whole of whatsoever
disease be bad."
"Just now," the preacher said, "church
circles are greatly agitated over a state
ment by Dr. Jordan of Stanford Univer
sity. In a casual reference to emotional
religion, at Berkeley, Dr. Jordan said :
A revival of religion in which men loso
their reason in a lorm of drunkenness no
more worthy of respect thaa tho kind which
lies in the gutters.
This would seem to be a reasonable
statement, amply substantiated by the
observations of those who have witnessed
tbe hysterical excitement produced by
professional revivalists. It was qualified
the following day by these words:
The normal aim of a revival of religion is to
bring the various Impulses of life into har
mony and to fix the will to high purposes
rather than low ones. It should build up
noble ideas in the place of vagrant dreams.
Such revivals of religion rarely take place in
a crowd or undef the influence of a profes
sional revivalist.
The so-calied revival of religion too often
aims at producing a temporary mania, ll
tries to destroy the balance of life, to elimi
nate common sense and to substitute hypnotic
suggestion for the conscience and the will.
Its phenomena are those of hysteria or cata
leptic insanity, its victims rarely wholly re
cover and are as likely to enter the prison or
the madhouse when the hypnotic spell lias
passed as they are to become healthy members
of society. Pure religion and undented works
Itself oni in righteous action, while the destruc
tion of the sober mind, whether through
drunkenness, narcotism or religious excite
ment, is a step on the road to spiritual death.
"We are apt to discuss a statement of
this kind from the standpoint of our re
ligious prejudices or prepossessions. It
has accordingly aroused a storm of hostile
criticism, and orthodox ministers have
forgotten the example of the ten tie Mas
ter whom tbey worship and have brought
a 'railin , accusation' against President
Jordan for daring to have an opinion of
his own."
Mr. Wells then proceeded to examine
the question of revivals and the super
naturalism claimed to be involved in their
production, and also the phenomenon
called conversion. A true revival of re
ligion â meaning a new influx of life â was,
ha said, a cood thing; the modern revival,
however, was a combination of influences
â of chorus choirs, of moving music, of
fervent prayers, of enthusiastic speech,
catenated to produce excitement.
"The appeal," he continued, "is to the
emotions.
"The presence of a crowd powerfully
stimulates the feelings. You cannot be
quite as cool in the midst of a crowd as
you can in your parlor. Given a crowd
and a strong personality on the platform
and the nightly gatherings will roll up ex
citement as tbe schoolboy's ball of snow
gathers bulk and weight. The product
may be good or evil according as it is a re
vival of the higher or lower elements in
BUTLER'S SUNDAY
PASSES QUIETLY
An Uncle of Arthur Preston
Visits the Accused
Man.
He Will Be Examined by Com
missioner Heaccck To-
Day.
The R fusee From Australia Has
Preserved a Cool Demeanor Ex
cept on One Occasion.
Frank Butler, the supposed monster of
the Australian bush, will be removed irom
his cell in the City prison at 8:30 to-day
and placed in the prisoners' room in the
Appraiser's building.
At 10:30 A. M. United States Commis
sioner Heacock will hear the evidence
which Attorneys Cormac and Donohoe
will present for the British Government
against the prisoner, after which the ques
tion will be decided whether there is evi
dence enough to justify sending Butler to
Australia. The proceedings will in no
sense be a trial, the function of the court
being to decide whether tbere is probable
cause to believe that Butler has committed
the crime charged, and that he is the
same person for whom warrants are now
issued in Australia.
Attorneys Stone and Pidwell will ap
pear for the prisoner and contest every
step of the proceedings for their client. It
is not believed tbat any substantial part
of the real defrnse will Come to light to
day. Butler has been almost as uncom
municative to his attorneys as to the pub
1c at large. Throughout the entire ordeal
since hi" arrest the man charged with so
many fiendish murders. has preserved a
calm demeanor. He seems absolutely
void of imagination and the ordinary
emotions. T ere has been but one time
since his arrival b re when he appeared to
be moved for an instant.
That was when Captain Lees showed
him the Sydney Mail containing pictures
of the rescuing party that discovered the
bodies of Preston and Weller, together
with pictures of the dead men and
some bits of scenery contiguous to the
lonely spot where the murders were com
mitted.
Butler glanced nervously at the pic
tures, grew a little pale, and those who
viewed him closely saw that bis hand
trembled. With this exception, there has
been no break in the dull monotony of the
accused man's calm demeanor.
The prisoner was with Captain Lees
and two ex-sergeants of the Canadian
religion. There have been revivals of fear,
when multitudes have been seized with
religious panic; there have been revivals
of love and hope, in which multitudes
have shouted and prayed in an ecstacy of !
emotion that was chiefly sensuous; there j
i have been revivals of superstition, like ,
that of witchcraft in early New England." j
He cited several curious historical in- '
i stances of epidemics of hysteria pro- 1
l moted by example, especially among 1
j women, and asserted that the txcitiment i
j of revivals, the crowds at the "mourners'
bench" and '"instantaneous conversions"
belonged to this category.
"They are so regarded,'' said he, "by
President Andrew D. While in his valu
able work on "The Warlare of "science
With Theology.' Read Carpenter's 'Men
tal Physiology' and Mandsley's 'Path
ology of the Mind,* if you desire to inves
tigate the subject.
"That every great revival has an inju
rious moral result I very strongly believe.
Great stress is laid upon instantaneous
conversion, but such an _ experience is for ;
the most part mere emotional excitement. |
It is found, to be sure, in i .olated cases, |
but generally in groupb. It is like the
measles or the mumps â is catching.
"It involves some mental action and
some action of the will, ana so is lound in
individual cases, but chiefly religious ex
periences of this kind occur in revivals
and break out like an epidemic. They are j
supposed to have a miraculous root, and
to be the action of the divine spirit. But
they are philosophically explicable on
wholly natural grounds. To use a philo
sophical term, they are who ly subjective
phenomena, like the faith cures we hear
of."
Mr. Wells criticized the contentions of
the revivalists at further lengtu, and ex
plained what he conceived to be the true
meaning of religion. He concluded: "We
may not care for the old forms of faith or !
the old-time methods of winning assent to !
them and yet hold to the sanctities of reli-. j
! eious life. We may object to revivals as j
j irrational, yet believe la a personal rela- 1
j tion between ourselves and the Infinite |
j Father. It is the business of every man 1
to cultivate the worshipful, the reveren- j
tial, the tender and the spiritual side of j
! bis nature, and enter into the higher J
I forms of religion, thus recognizing the
eternal nature 01 religion while confessing
I the changes going on in human thought
â  as the universe enlarges around him."
J.atior.al Re\Mal.
At Golden Gate Hall Rev. Harold Boice
of the new Cosmopolitan Church spoke of
the kind of revival which he and his co
workers hope to bring about. His subject [
was "The Rational Revival in Religion." '
He prefaced his address with a histori- j
I cal analysis of the world's greatest refor
! mations. These were brought about, he j
argued, by some superior mind seeing l
through the mass of tangle of forms and j
ceremonies which had grown up about the
I religion of hia dayâ the germ of truth
which was at the ba o of all religions.
He would urge this simple truth until a
new sect would arise and cast aside the !
obscuring ceremonials, but gradually the
new schooi of belief would assume cere
i monials to which it would give more and
j more importance. Then another reformer
Northwest mounted police for two hours
yesterday. 3__B9-_S9_a
Questioned about his life prior to 1891
Butler persistently declined to speak, say
ing that he respected the feelings of his
family. "If anything is to befall me," he
said, "it is best that my family never
know it. It would do me no good to
speak of my past so they would know
who I am, andl shall not SDeak, at least
to-day."
Several hundred people saw Butler yes
terday and to all he was courteous. He
seemed to Miss Thomas Edwards, the
trusty who has been in the same ceil since
last Friday.
Butler was not in a very communicative
mood yesterday When John Preston Sr.,
uncle of young Arthur Preston, who was
murdered, called upon bim. He seemed
embarrassed, and several times was on
the point of making a statement, but
would check himself and start off on an
other subject. To Mr. Preston he ad
mitted having known his nephew, but as
serted that he had no hand whatever in
his death. Pressed to tell ail he knew
about tbe movements of the murdered
man prior to the tragedy, he gave an
evasive answer and said he would give
Mr. Preston ail the information he wanted
"in contidence" before he left San Fran
cisco.
Asked if he had any memento of Ar
thur Preston among his effects, Butler
said he had not, but he t ought that
"some friends that Preston had made in
New South Wales had one or two trink
ets." Further than this the man ac
cused of murder would not go, and Mr.
Presion had to content himself with to.
assurance that Butler or Ashe would tell
him all he knew "before leaving San
Francisco."
"That man knows all the particulars
about how Arthur came to his death," said

would arise, but always the same germ of
truth was the inspiration.
"We believe that the world is upon the
eve of a new reformation," he said, "a
reformation of thought in relieious mat
ters. Everywhere men are looking above
ceremonies and sects. The curve of the
pulpit is too narrow to embrace the
world.
"Your love of humanity, your Chris
tianity, your trust in immortality does
not depend on history. Imagine all the
stories of the Bible to be fables 9 ritten by
clever dreamers. This belief would have
no effect upon a true Christian. If you
could prove Jesus Christ a myth and "his
sayings the worn of exalted dreamers, it
would not shake my faith in the inspired
thought contained in those pages.
"The infinite is not the head of a sect.
Wherever man is doing good for hi- fel
low-man he is laying gilts upon God' 3
altar."
The speaker then outlined bis plans for
the establishment of the Cosmopolitan
Church. He conceived that this could be
made broader and more tolerant than any
organization in existence. It was not his
intention to form a sect antagonistic to
any scientific or religious society. His
idea was to institute a society where rep
resentatives of all schools of thought
might meet in tho common work of up
lifting mankind.
"By tb s means," he said, "representa
tives Of various denominations would not
be burling anathemas at each other upon
the quotation, often irapei fectly, of p-rt
of an address in a newspaper. Here they
could meet and discuss their differences
with dignity.*'
Mr. Boice believed that when the expo
nents of the ideas be advocated could
make people see that they were thor
oughly in earnest tbey would have
no difficulty in receiving material back
ing to erect a commodious and
artistic hall in the central portion of
the City. Here it is designed to
have uplifting entertainments not once a
week, as In the churches, but every after
noon and evening. These would not be
exclusively religious, but would be de
voted to art, science and other subjects
calculated to result in the betterment of
mankind.

The following appears ia the current
numberof the Monitor:
ROWDY REVIVALS.
Dr. Jordan of Stanford being the president
of a non-sectarian institution is privileged to
pitch into the sacred customs of our dear
friends the Methodists. Among that godly
people the revival possesses a sacrosanct char
acter. It Is the beginning, the foundation of
righteousness. He who wouid attack it is to
them as proiane as he who laid unhallowed
hands on the ark of the covenant.
We wonder what will the brethren say now
to Dr. Jordan. He has described the revival
as "a real drunkenness and no more worthy
of respect than the drunkenness of the gut
ter." The Rev. Dr. Dille and the Rev. Dr.
Case have, it ls true, spurred into the arena to
defend tue peculiar manifestations oi their
creed, but nobody minds them.
it is a common error among the secular
newspapers to describe a "mission" in a
Catholic church as a revival. There is abso
lutely no similarity between them. The mis
sion is a sad sober reflection on the truths of
faith, the revival is a wild delirium and
frenzy like unto that wnich seizes on the Mm
sulman at the sight of the pajamas of the
Prophet.
; Preston Sr. "Whether he murdered him
j or not remains to be seen, and I suppose
it will come out at the trial. It is very
I poor satisfaction, but I would like to know
| nil the particulars of the boy's death.
Butler is not a man that is giving much
; information away. He has a cool head
and I doubt very much whether he will
tell me anything at all. I will call on him
again and if I cannot find thing else I
may lind out where any little odds and
ends of mv dead nephew's belongings can
be found."
Preston feels confident that Butle*- will
i at least give him some satisfaction before
he leaves San Francisco; but the chances
j are that the prisoner will give him some
I "fairy tale" that wi.l prove to be false in
I every particular.
Butler now denies that he was a mem
! ber of t c Northwest mounted police iorce
j during the Rio! rebellion in 1885, although
I admitting that he, in conversation with a
I reporter of The Call on Saturday night,
I said that he was a member of Troop B
j and was stationed at Qu'Appelle Crossing
with Major Short.
If Butler was not a member of the force
; be knows a good deal about the Kiel re
! bellion and the Northwest Territories.
In speaking o; Major Short, who was in
command of "A" Battery of artillery* dur
ing the rebellion, which came from Quebec
to take part in is suppressing, he said
I that when the mounted police joined him
j at Qu'Appelle crossing the major looked at
them critically and remarked: "You look
like dandies. You have come here to fight
not to show yourselves off."
"You know," said Butler, "we nad pipe
clayed our belts and looked spick and span
and it angered the major," and he laughed
heartily os he spoke oi the incident.
Then Butler mentioned that Major
Short was, shortly after the rebellion,
' killed by a powder explosion in ths
Quebec citadel, which was a fact known
to the reporter to whom he was speaking.
In confirmation oi Butler's statement
on Tuesday afternoon when some police
men were talking to him in the City
Prison he said to one of them, Policeman
Coogan: 'T was once a policeman my
self.'
"Where?" asked Coogan, and Butler
replied, "In Canada."
A reporter of The (all saw Butler the
following day and asked mm if he had
been in Canada. He repliÂ»d that he had
audi n answer to further qui*..'. ions he said
he was more familiar win Manitoba and
the Northwest than any other part of the
dominion. He knew "Quebec city, bow
ever, and said he was tnere during a riot
that occurred one Sunday over a stating
rink being started.
"That was in ISS9," said the reporter.
"No," replied Butler, "it was in 1883,"
and he was correct; it v. as during the win
ter of ISSS.
There were other incidents that he re
ferred to Saturday t.i_.-bt that led to the
conviction be was telling the truth. He
now probably sees that there is every
chance of his place of birth ana real name
being discovered, as it would be on record
at the mounted police headquarters in
Regina, the capital of the Northwest, and
he is now anxious to save himself from
this exposure by denying that he was a
member of the force.
Captain Lees was for some days in
possession of information that led him to
believe that Butler had been in the North
west rebellion as a mounted policeman,
and had joined tne force in 1884. The
information he is keeping to himself, but
yesterday he wrote a long letter to Colonel
Herchmer, Commissioner of the mounted
police at Regina, detailing what he bad
learned and enclosing a picture of Butler
in the hope that it would lead to bis
identification. He is supposed to have
enlisted in 1834 for three years, and the
probability is that after serving bis term
he went to Quebec, and sailed from there
to some other country.

Edward Howard Griggs, professor of

last evening what was declared by nearly
all of the dozen speakers who followed to
be the best lecture delivered before the
Socialist Labor Party in many months.
"All reflecting students of modern civil

According to the point of view this or that
political party has been charged as re

but the s at is deeper tbat the measures of
any political party.
" The complications of civilization has
increased with amazing rapidity during
the past few years, thus the problem with
which we deal becomes most intricate con
stantly." Tbe social crisis, he said, was
the key to the industrial crisis. "There is
no hope of solving tbe latter unless we
solve the former. The industrial prob
lem, the condition of poverty and wealth,
increasing so constantly in seriousness,
rests back for their ultimate cause upon
the type of life which we seek and upon
our social attitude as individuals. In
other words, our essential problem is pro

that fact is ignored, "

the great), first wife of Mohammed (whose
name be praised), died December, (519 A. D.

The meetings are well attended, the member
ship is increasing and the good of the order
committee is doing all that can be done to
make the meetings attractive.
Sequoia Parlor, one of the youngest in the
order, has set a pace that has astonished many
of the older parlors. The members are most
energetic in bringing in candidates, its affairs
are conducted on strictly business lines, and
there is a spirit of good fee.'ing in the member
ship that cannot be excelled by any body
having a like number of members. And in
addition the parlor has a uniformed band
composed exclusively of its members, and as
one of the members said, ' -They are all good
wind-jammers."

grand trustees.having fully recovered from the
effects of his recent illness, will arrive in this

delegate each to the Grand Parlor.

There is unusual activity in all the parlors
and interest, too, in the selection of delegates
to the Grand Parlor; in fad, more so than In
many years pust.
On the last Saturday in January Redwood
Parlor gave an entertainment and dance
which proved a great success in every respect.
There was a large attendance-, including resi
dents of Menlo Park, San Mateo and other
places in the vicinity.
In a letter to the grand secretary, C. R. Run
kel, deputy for Nevada County, writes that he
visited Auburn, Silver Star, Sierra and Dor
mer parlors and found them all flourishing.
On the occasion of his visit to Sierra Parlor a
team from Mountain Parlor of Dutch Flat vis
ited and initiated fifteen cubs into the Curly
Bear degree. Then followed a feast at which
all the good things were not served on plates,
for there were many glasses on the board.
Frank Sabichi, one of the grand trustees, who
recently visited San Diego Parlor, reports it in
a very prosperous condition.
The tenth anniversary of Mt. Diablo Parlor
will be celebrated to-morrow night by au en
tertainment and banquet, at which the Native

HOW EVERY MAN
MAY GET RICH
Officers of the Labor Ex
change Tell All
About It.
The Topic Which Mest Inter
ests the Army of the
Unemployed.
A System Which Promises to Work
Out tLe Grrat Pr b em of
the Age.
State Organizer J. S. Clark explained to
a large and very much interested audience
yesterday at Pythian Hall something of
the results of his tour over the State in
th . interests of the Labor Exchange.
The new plan for the ultimate emanci
pation of the workers the United States
â of the world â bad been introduced here
but about two years ago, he said, and
there are now fitty-tive branches in the
State. The movement Is spreading rap
idly over the coast. He explained the
Labor Exchange as an institution that
carries on business without money, lt
has its own system of checks that, among
I its members, serve the purpose of money.
| It is the purpose of the exchange to set
the unemployed at worK by finding a
i market for their product â that is, effecting
exchanges between the members so that
every one may secure whatever he nee J -s
of the product of any other member by
offering the product of bis own labor for
it. To effect this readily a big storehouse
j has been opened at 3-2 Davis street, where
the surplus product of the members of the
I exchanges throughout the State is re
] ceived and distributed. During the past
I eiubt months a business of no less than
$28,000 has been transacted in this way.
"We believe we have discovered the
way out ot our labor and financial diffi-
I culties," said the speaker. "Of course we
! do not expect to overturn tbe old system
in a month or a year, but we are moving
j rapidly and with every day the momen
tum of the movement increases. The
army of tbe unemployed is very large and
with the conditions that obtain the task
of putting them all to work is a big one.
Hut our system is on a sound basis and
we are proceeding under safe, practical
methods, so the relief extended is perma
nent am the area of its good influence
keeps always extending.
For instance, a spicemill has been pur
chased within the pas', few days for the
exchange at Red Bluff; a shingle-mill bad
been purchased at Eureka; there is a saw
mill on Puget Sound and others along the
coast at different points at which the
Laoor Exchange checks are acceptable.
"Now, inasmuch as the laborers or work
men only gets about one-tenth of the pro
duct of hi. labor under the old system, he
will find it greatly to bis advantage to en
list under our system, where he practically
sets the whole product of his own labor.
It is rapidly coming to be understood how
the men who control the circulating
medium control all else. A newspaper
woman some lime ago, by means of dis
| guise, went among the poor classes of
j workwomen of this City. She discovered
I that no less than 300 of them were cm
i ployed at wages that amounted to an
! average of 15 cents a day. Is not that an
j illustration of how the wealthy have power
] to throw the working classes upon the
| charitable institutions while tbey (the
wealthy) secure the product of their labor
to themselves?
Thomas V. Cator was introduced as the
speaker of the afternoon. His discourse
! was more of a general appeal in behalf of
i liberty in reform movements and among
j reformers than an exposition of the prin
ciples of the Labor Exchange. He declared
j bis strong belief in those principles, how
i ever, lie said that be bad watched the
j progress oi ihe Labor Exchange with
j great interest and believed that it would
I eventually spread all over the United
! States and revolutionize the system of ex
! change and with it the waces of labor.
I He said be had talked with Senator Bar
low a few days ago and learned that the
j Labor Exchange of San Luis Obispo was
the biggest and soundest commercial en
i terprise in that country.
He thought that single taxers, social-
I ists, and every other branch of reformers
: working for the same end, the emancipa
i tion of men, should join in this move-
I ment, as its rapid trend was in that di
! rection.
Henry Warfield, president of Branch 26,
! further explained the workings of the
! movement. "The difference between the
j Labor Exchange and any other move
! ment." he said, "is that we do not have to
j wait for four years to get a chance to vote
j again. We are at work now and all the
time."
He explained that tbe next development
of the movement was to build houses for
tne members. He said that arrangements
had been effected for building a house for
a member who owned a lot and which lot
â¢ was deposited with the exchange. Labor
' and materials bad been secured; the
; bouse would be put up through the me
| dium of their checks, just as the Governor
j of Guernsey had built a public market
hou-e. The rent of the house would be
I paid into the exchange and the same re
! sult would be achieved as the single-taxers
; are striving at through the medium of
', legislation.
Great interest was manifested by the
I large audience. Another public meeting
â¢ will be held at the same place next Sun
l day. â¢

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted Hues, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain-*.
â¢â¢Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain ls probable:
but when Ihe "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is iroprob
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

J. C Martin Still Unable to Gratify
the Earnest Wish of His
Many Frknd**.
Oakland Office .an Fkancisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 7. )
There is great desire among lhe people |
of this city who are interested in poll tips j
. to see the secret system of conducting ;
â  {tarty and non-party. politics abandoned.
The only secret thing desired is the ballot.
Four years ago there was an agitation
against secret sessions of the Board of Ed
. iicai.ion. The School Directors got into a
habit of uie.ung and adjourning into |
."executive session," though everybody [
â¢ thought that every session was an'execu
tive one, and nearly ev.iy one of such
ytf_.cc tings was followed by some wild reve- ]
' /.a. ions.* The explanation was given that
i. tue of the teachers' characters were I
Y'lder d.iecussion, b^t it was soon learned
"that the awarding of large contracts for
: school furniture was really the cause, and ;
since that time secret meetings have not |
been held. -'-i^.-.Â»j -_c-_Â«- u;j.
"Witn modern newspaper methods there
isMio such' thing as a "secret" meeting of
any. political body. No matter what pre- I
â¢ â¢cautions are thrown around the proceed- I
ings a' report ol them can always be found I
'in next morning's papers, though the
moral of this doe*, not seem to have yet
borne much fruit. But whatever excuse
may be offered lor the secret meetings of
city central committees, there will cer
tainly he none offered for a secret couven- j
tion such as that held by the Municipal j
League ia.t week. Asa matter of fact,
mere was nothing said or done at the j
secret convention that needed protection
from the public, but the closed doors in- :
vited suspicion and the public accepted
ti.e invitation. It was perfectly safe in
indorsing the greater portion of * tne Re
publican licket, out there is certainly no
Hope lor the candidates whom it r.omi- :
â¢ nated and who have no other support.
The league is not the power it was four
years ago when Dr. Pardee was its con
trolling spirit and it 3 present attempt to
split tue regular Republican ticket* will
nut be successful.
. Nothing shows the growth of Alameda
I county more than the incorporation of
hew towns. Not long ago Pleasanton re
incorporated as a city of an advanced
class; Livermore will soon do the same
thing, and still more recently the town of
Emeryville has been created. Now comes I
another town for municipal honors and j
â¢Eim burst is considering the policy of hay- j
.. log a local Government.
A few years ago there was not a house in
Klmhurst, indeed there was no such place. '
'Jhe electric road opened, a churcn was j
built, a public school district was formed, I
/nouses arose iike mushrooms, and soon
I there was a town much larger than Oak-
I land was when she incorporated in the
time when Horace Carpenter was strug- \
gling for hi.- daily bread. *"';
. In this same connection is the growing i
desire to make Oakland a city ahead 01
Los Angeles. There is no reason why all
the outlying territory should still be with
. . out street lights, sidewalks and protec
;ion. The advantages that will accrue \
from being part of the city will soon in- j
crease the value of property to such an 1
ox'.ent that the additional proportion oÂ» I
' taxation would not Le felt. Ail the coun- j
fry between Oakland and Berkeley is set
tled, and it would De impossible for the |
different districts to form separate incor
porations, as the cost of town officers
would be too heavy. Yet tbey cannot re- i
main stagnant or property wiil continue j
â¢to he of no more value than if it were
located in Palomares Canyon.
The only relief is annexation and now '
that the large property-owners have taken |
|he mailer in hand there is little doubt
but that it will be annexed. The electric '
roa_is run directly through the districts
from the heart 01 Oakland and residents j
would rather live on the outskirts' of a I
town than in the center, if accorded the '
same police protection and conveniences, j
As carfare is the same for three miles as |

V ICE-PRESIDENT CAMPBELL OF THE ECONOMIC LEAGUE.
I OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 6â The Ladies* Economic L.ague of Oakland has been
- reorganized with a large membership. The league is conducted on lines similar
â¢ to that of the Ebell Society, without the latter's' social features. Mrs. Lydia A.
'. Prescott has been elected secretary, Mrs. Campbell of West Oakland'vice-presi
dent and Mrs. Kellogg secretary. â¢' ~ """ % ...*.--_
The league meets once a week to discuss questions of economics and to hear
papers from prominent persons who may b^ traveling in this part of the country.
Last season it had a membership of about 100 and it is probable' that that number
will be exceeded in the present course. -'-â¢â¢â¢v
one man, was placed the onus of protect
ing the interests of the railroad company
in the courts. But, although he was
often pictured before the people in certain
quarters as "a man who was paid to try to
legally keen a collar around their necks,"
that same public always respected J. C.
Martin. Now that Le has been sick for
over a year, there is not a person In Oak
land who would not gladly welcome his
kindly face and willingly-given hand on
Broadway.
It has often been said, ana with some
trutii, that J. C. Martin's sickness is more
the result of a broken heart than 'an in
firmity of the body. More than a year
ago tu*> partner of his life was taken from
him. His noble wife nad made a chapter
of history that will ever brighten the
pages of local â¢ annals of the kind and
good, and their home was to them both
their altar, at which they worshiped in
perfect accord every hour of their long
married life. (Since "that home was tem
porarily rent asunder the kindly attorney

Rev. J. W. Ellis of the Centennial Pres
byterian Church was prepared to make a
Rev. J. W. Ellis, Pastor-Elect of the Centennial Presbyterian Church.
statement at this morning'? service of his
side ol the matter that has split the con
gregation, but owing to the rain the at
tendance was so small that he refrained.
The pastor would have said that he has
no desire to stay in a church where he is
not wanted, but that he proposes that
everything shall be done decently and in
order.
"Somehow or other," said the pastor to
day, "Centennial Church is in an awk
ward position. There is the Elnihurst
Presbyterians on one side and the
Brooklyn Presbyterian Church on the
other and we are sandwiched in between,
with both sides pulling away from us.'
Next Wednesday evening there is to be a
general meeting of tne congregation and
the whole matter will be decided."
The dissatisfaction between the two ele
ments in the church is not confined to the
older members, but prevails as bitterly
among the younger people. Several of the
young ladies have expressed some very
strong opinions about their society which
created much interest some months ago.
The society was called the "M. M." So
ciety, and it was given out that the letters
meant "marry or move," and that if by a
certain time the members did not marry
they must move out of the neighborhood.
Whether this was the idea or not, it w as
generally believed to be the case, and the
young ladies declare that the pastor
â  caused them to obtain much unpleasant
notoriety.
On the other hand, the friends of the
: pastor declare that he is no way responsi
ble for any unpleasantness among the
young folks and that he only helped along
a practical movement for mutual culture
and progress. \ : â "â '.
Rev. Dr. Coyle recently stated that the
trouble appeared to be between money on
oue side and members on the other "and
that it seemed to be an effort to prevent
Dr. Ellis exercising that discipline whicU.
is essential to church government.
RETREAT OF SECTARIANISM
Key. E. Davis Leans Toward the Views
Advanced by .President
Jordan. â¢"â¢â¢Â»
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 7.â Rev. Edwards
Davis, who is one of the union of pastors
who invited Dr. Munhall to Oakland,
somewhat surprised his congregation 16
--night with the following section of his
sermon, 'which* was entitled "The Ad
vance ol Modern Thought and the Retreat
of Sectarianism' :
Human development depends on conflict,
not peace. Charge iv belief should be no more
appalllnsr than death that leads to life. Con
fidence In the ultimate triumph of truth
should make the Christian fear no foe of
Christianity, Skepticism proves nothing; in
fidelity is- merely the negation ol a ({ting
affirmed, to be confirmed; speculative phil
osophy, if erroneous, will enhance the
worth of faith, to whicn tho wandering mind
will eventually return, andthe-hypotnosis of
science, if wrong, will demonstrate us falsity,
while the truo revelations of the ! mind of
man will only reveal reality. And 1 would
rather know the truth that all were false than
think that all were true and have a faith in
falsity. ; ".*".' * ' â¢
As religionists we should be sufficiently
scientific to prove all things, lest we hold fast
to those things which are not Rood. If higher
criticism can reveal textual error in what was
supposed to be Holy Writ, if the text be true
ft is no less hoiy writ because it was written
by unhoij- hands; if the miracles be false,
then as allegorical teachings' their principles
are no less true; if Christ was not raised from
the tomb Christianity has risen from nothing
and its existence is a miracle, if the' masses
lose faith in human creeds they will find faith
in something, and that, whatever it may be,
is the divine creed. If the' universe' implies
the existence of a Creator, ono' of His attri
butes is necessarily omnisicence; and hence
truth' will ultimately triumph. * â¢* '*.'â >â 
Science Is not only incidental, but absolutely
essential to theo.ogy, for it is the classifica
tion of truths. But science and theology have
both been iv error, but both by an elimination
of the spurious aie being brought into com
pleteness. * ' " â â * - "â¢ * - â _ i â â -â _. .ri â â â¢
Aristarchus contended in vain with his con
temporaries In astronomy nineteen centuries
before Galileo demonstrated the falsity of the
belief that the sun revolved around the earth.
Science first believed the false, then theology
would not believe the true. The land-lubber
ing scientist believed the earth was flat, but
the sailors saw the convexity of the seas. The
physical scientist has advanced a presumable
truth and the theologian has refused the offer
ing.-â Science retaliates- with- a just criticism
of theology's excess of sentiment at the ex
pense of reason. Theology retorts and science
parries.- Mote personally, if Dr. Jordan be so
an tly wrong why does 'his mistake 'need
correction? Revivalist, , it not' hit, do not
dodge; theologian, if he be right in his asser
tion that the revival is a phase of intoxication,
then,' believer in au unbelievable creed, throw
your articles to tbe winds or, standing on the
shifting sands of sentiment, wail over 'a lost
faith. Prove all things, and hold not fast to
things that are not good. â -- â

Dr. Carroll, pastor of the Eighth-avenue
Methodist Church, referring to the matter
to-night, said: '-;'.', _ Â»
"During the war certain Protestant
churches erected flagpoles and displayed
'Old Glory' from them, and I see no rea

matter will be brought before the official
board this week to decide whether tho
pole shall be placed on the church build
ing or on the ground."
The doctor said that in case of opposi

PREPARING FOR DEBATE.
Berkeley Orators Reading Up
On French Educa

They Will Not Know Until the Night

Will Support.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 7.â The three
embryo .orators who will uphold the blue
and gold in the contest with Stanford for
the Carriot medal next Friday evening at
Palo Alto are whetting their wits, replen
ishing their vocabularies, burnishing their

logic and rounding out their arguments in
preparation (or their -battle ot words.
These three men are Harry Overstreet, '98,
a student in the college o! letters; Charles
E. Fryer, '99, who is taking a course in
the social sciences, and A. C. Marks of the
law college , in San Francisco. " The ques-
tion which they will discuss is whether
the present centralized system of educa-
tion in France is conducive to the best in-
terests of that Republic.' _ .' ' 1 '"â "-' ' A
A. feature of the contest will be that the
speakers " who 'are to â  participateâ three
from Berkeley and three 'from Stanford-
will not know until a few hours* before
they mount the platform - what side of the
case they are 'to speak on. The sides
which the young collegians are to uphold
are asd-.-ned by lot, so that it is possible to
have both Palo Alto men and Berkeley
speakers talking on the same aspect of the
subject. '*"-'" ... â¢*-* '-â â*-'-â.' -Â«--â¢â.-- Â«.. â 
Much interest is manifested in the out-
come of the contest, as the "medal went to
Berkeley "last-year,- as did also the honors
ot thi intercollegiate. Though Stanford
defeated rkeley on the gridiron in the
last meet the wearers of the blue and gold
hold the honors of 'logomachy. :i *** * .*, _:-.
The three speakers from Berkeley have
bad more or less forensic experience.
Overstreet, while in the High School, won
much honor as a debater; Fryer was a
substitute in the last Carnot, having
worked his way through the preliminaries
and finals, and' Maries has gained a repu
tation as a rising orator. '
Each year the contest alternates. Last
year it was held in Berkeley, while this
season it will take place at Palo Alto. An
excursion of Berkeley students will be run
down on the afternoon of the debate.

For some time the officers of the De
partment of California have been expect
ing the new infantry drill regulations,
but it appears that they are not yet ready
to be sent to the printer. A Washington
paper says word has been received at the
War Department that General Ruger has
decided that it is advisable to further re
vise some 'details of the battle, or open
order, formations. The' communication
from Governor's Island stated that, all
other parts the revision were ready for
the printer, and that these could be J sent
to the War Department at once. General
Ruger asked to be informed whether he
should forward to Washington such parts
of the regulations as were 'completed:
Just what details of the' open-order
formations General Ruger wishes to go
over are not known at the War Depart
ment. Nor is the department advised *' as
to how long it' will be before this work
is completed. Secretary Lamont has in
formed General Ruger" that as it is his
purpose to submit the infantry drill regu
lations to the commanding general of the
army when they are received here, and as
it is preferable, all things considered, that
the entire system rather than sections of
it shonld be laid before General Miles, it
is desirable that the" revision in a com
plete state be forwarded here as soon as
possible. , â¢ â -â â¢- â â¢--.-.
' Therefore, offic_rs must be prepared for

not intend to neglect thoroughness. ' The

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Copious Rains of the Week
Interfere With Busi
ness.
Volume of Trade in This City
as Compared With Business
in the East.
A Few Important Sa cs of Downtown
Property Reported Daring
the Week
The copious rains during the past week in
terfered considerably with the real estate
business. The volume of trade in TEls branch
of business, as well as in all other lines, had
for the time being been very much circum
scribed, yet Jew find fault, the people know
ing that the wealth and prosperity of the
community depend in a very great degree
upon a heavy rainfall at this season of the
year.
The pluvial dispensation has brought joy to
the hearts of the agriculturists and added
vastly to the prospective wealth of the State,
giving as it does assurance of abundant crops
of grain and large returns from the fruit dis- ]
tricts.
Confidence in real estate as security is un
shaken. Strong faith in land is a pronounced
ieaiure of the situation. Buyers may not be
particularly numerous at the moment, but
sellers from choice are equally few in number.
The market is well cleaned up of compulsory
offerings and this fact helps much to sustain
lne rather firm toue that prevails among the
holding interest.
Business men generally incline to the belief
that trade arteries will soon show increased
activity, when real estate matters will un
doubtedly come in for lull share of any
quicker movement that may develop as the
spring season approaches.
The following, showing the condition of the
real estate market in San Francisco, as com
pared with the Eastern cities, is taken from
Thomas Magee's circular:
"Dull as real estate has been here, and
scarce as money has been, the one has not
here been nearly as dull, nor the other as scarce
as They have been in Eastern cities. Evenin
New York and Chicago this has been true,
while it has been muc i more true generally of
all the other Atlantic cities, t * * In ordi
nary cities of the East real estate was so
boomed and loaded with debt that it oan now
hardly be given away. The worst examples of
this state of things are probably St. P.-tui, Min
neapolis and Denver. Of all the cities of the
United States San Francisco was least boomed
and least mortgaged, and has, in proportion to
its population, most money on hand. There
was plenty of booming and the robbery at
tendant upon it between 1887 and 1891, but
this skyrocketing was nearly all done in out
side properties of comparatively small totai
value, and was perpetrate d â¢>.* on small buy
er.-.''
During the past week 'he property on the
east line of Powell atreet, 85 feet south of
Geary, having a frontage oi 5:2:6 feet by 77:6
in depth, was sold for $50,000 to M. a. D.*rn.
The four-story frame buiidi%ig at present on
tha land will be altered ana stores will- be
built on the ground floor.
Another piece of property in the same block
and on the same side oi the street, 102:6 ieet
north of O'Farrell, with a frontage of 37:6
feet and a depth of 137:6. has been sold to
Emily M. Chabot for $37,500. The improve
ments on th* land consist of a three-story
building, which will be raised and a brick
story added below, which will be used lor
business purposes.
The property at the northeast corner of
Fourth and Minna streets has changed owners
for the sum of $52,000. The lot is 50x70 feet,
with improvements thereon consisting of a
three-story brick building renting for $375
per month. The seller is Mrs. H. Hampton
and the purchaser J. Calegaris.
Mrs. Phebe Hearst has purchased from the
Crooks estate a lot 20x80 feet on the
northwest side of Stevenson street, east of
Third, for the sum of $20,000. This Â«trip will
give a rear entrance to the Nucleus building,
which is being reconstructed.
The 17:6x70 feet, with improvements, on
the east side of Stockton street, 58:6 feet north
'of Geary, ha,s been purchased by G. Witteli

DON M. DICKINSON
WAS ONLY JARRED
Chief Counsel of the Sealing
Commissioners Arrives
Safely.
Thrown Out of His Berth by the
Impact of the Colliding
Trains
Explains the Status of the Interna
tional Inquiry â Praises for
Victorians.
Don M. Dickinson, chief counsel for the
United States in the pending international
inquiry into the extent of damages due to
British sealing vessels by United States
cutters in Bering Sea and formerly Post
master-General of tue United States, ar
rived here last night from Victoria, B. ('.,
on tbe belated Oregon train that was
partly wrecked in a collision early yester
day morning.
Mr. Dickinson was accompanied by
Robert Lansing of .Vaterto N. V., as
sistant United States counsel, Mrs. Lan
sing and Miss Lansing; by his own law
partner, Charles B. Warren of Detroit,
Mich., associate United States counsel;
and by Chandler P. Anderson of hew
York City, secretary of the commission.
They all went to the Palace Hotel, where
other members of the commission, includ
ing the leading representatives of Great
Britain, had arrived and temporarily es
tablished themselves the day before.
To-day the entire party will leave for
the East. The brief visit here is simply
for pleasure, the commission having, be
fore leaving Victoria, completed its in
quiries and adjourned to June 16, when
the final session will be held in Montreal.
From now until April 1 the United States
Commissioners will be busily engaged in
preparing their written arguments to be
presented to the British Commissioners,
who in turn will then present their writ
ten arguments to the United States Com
missioners before the final sitting of the
court in Montreal.
By the terms of the agreement under
which the Commissioners met one session
was to have been held in San Francisco,
but the United States Commissioners
waived the privilege and summoned to
Victoria the necessary San Francisco wit
nesses, and there, after a long and con
tinuous session from November 24 until a
few days since, received, examined and
passed upon claims presented by sealers
for damages alleged to have been done
their vessels during a numberof years pre
vious to 1852, when the Paris Tribunal
determined that Bering Sea is not a closed
sea and that consequently neither the
United States nor any other Government
has any special rights there or to the seals
not actually on the seal islands.
When the United States Commissioners
hrst appeared in Victoria, explained Mr.
Dickinson last night, they were looked
upon in their official capacity with very
great disfavor. The witnesses introduced
to give testimony favorable to the side of
the United States were tabooed and
were, generally made to feel that they
were very unpopular with the peopie of
Victoria.
Bu* notwithstanding all these .i^rnra!.

ing conditions the United States Com
missioners were able to bring out all the
facts tbey wished to establish.
This antagonistic feeling in Victoria
was due to the very important factor
sealing has been in the litis. ness of the
place, It is estimated tbat 15 per cent of
the total business capital of Victoria is
invested in the ocean sealing bus'ness.
Those primarily interested are princi
i pally sailors and men engaged in marine
| business, but tbeir success and their mis
[ fortunes have an effect upon tbe whole
community, particularly when it comes to
I taking sides in an international contro
versy.
In private social life Mr. Dickinson found
] the people of Victoria most courteous and
most entertaining. He also has words of
; praise for the courtesy and learning of the
' British commissioners. Victoria he styles
; a very cosmopolitan place, with a par
j ticularly enterprising population.
The original claims presented amounted
! to near $1,500,000, but evidence failed to
. sustain many of them. They were re
duced fully one-half. Mr. Dickinson ex
plains that in justice to the people of Vie
: toria it should be known that the most
flagrant attempts to establish false claims
I were those traceable directly to unscrupu
j lous Americans â persons who. while citi-
I zens of the United Stales, had attempted
to get damages as British subjects.
Speaking the collision in which sev
eral of the cars of his train were, shortly
after '6 o'clock yesterday morning, de
, railed, overturned and smashed, Mr.
; Dickinson said that be him-elf was jolted
j out of his berth onto the floor by the force
j of the impact and was slightly bruised.
He was the only one. however, of ail the
' passengers in the Pullman coach that
! suffered any inconvenience, for he hap
i pened just at tbe moment to have assumed
: a position on the edge of the berth, from
which he was easily thrown. .
The Pullman car. the last one on the
! train, was the only coach that escaped
injury. Its front trucks were raised two
feet from the rails by the cowcatcher of
the northbound train which smashed the
tourist sleeper all to splinters. The coup
ling between the sleeper and the Pullman
broke and prevented the last coach from
being overturned.
The escape of the passengers in the
sleeper was miraculous, particularly as a
number of them were United States de
j serters from the army and were compara
| lively helpless, because of being in irons.
! One of these captives had an arm broken.
A commercial traveler was badly rattled,
but instinctively snatched his satchel out
of the pool of water into which the
sleeper had been thrown, remarking as he
did so that it contained his commissions,
amounting to $100 for .roods sold.
Donald McDonald Dickinson, the chief
United States counsel in the Bering Sea
damage airy, was born in New York
State in 1846, and in 1867 was graduated
from the University of Michigan. He be
came a lawyer and was interested in many
: important suits. He was chairman ofthe
I Democratic State Committee of Michigan
i in 1876 and in 1880 was a delegate-at-large
I and chairman of the Michigan delegation
in the Democratic National Convention.
For some lime subsequent to 1884 he rep
resented Michigan in the Democratic
National Committee. He was nominated
for Postmaster-General late in 1887 and
the Senate confirmed the - nomination
early in 1888. He has been noted for his
personal devotion to President Cleveland.
In this connection it may hi stated that
he thinks that free silver will not again
be an issue, but that if it should have any
supporters four years hence it will be
completely defeated in 1900. In the Mich
igan Democratic convention in 1886,
when the chaplain in his orening prayer
failed to mention President Cleveland,
Mr. Dickinson arose at once to protest,
and thereupon offered a supplementary
prayer, in which he invoked a blessing for
i the President, considered as "a Demo
| crat of Democrats, the noblest of them

UNSAVORY COOKING.
It -Leads to a Lively Fight on Board
the British Bark Kll iot.
John Williams, a colored man, is cook
and steward on tbe British bark Elliot,
now discharging her cargo of coal at
Green-street wharf.
According to Frank Robinson, one of
the sailors, Williams is a poor cook, and
j during the voyage there were constant
complaints from the forecastle about the
| way he cooked and served up tne meat,
j bread and other edibles.
.Saturday Robinson went to the cook's
galley and remonstrated with "Williams,
who seized a large carving fork and threat
ened to stick it into him. Yesterday at
the dinner hour the bread was, so Robin
son says, nothing but dough, and he took
one of the loaves into the gailey and told
Williams it was not fit for a ling to eat.
Williams seized a fork and said he would
stick it into Robinson's eyes. Then he
grabbed a basin of boiling soup and threw
|it at Robinson. Robinson's arms were
: bare and the soup struck him on the right
! arm, burning it severely.
Robinson grappled with Williams and
! during the scuffle Williams got Robinson's
left thumb in his mouth and nearly bit it
! off. The men were separated and Captain
'. Evans had Robinson arrested lor disturb
| ing the peace.
Robinson was taken to the City Prison
; and booked and was then sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where his arm and
thumb were attended to. He says he will
swear out a warrant this morning for
Williams' arrest on the charge of may
> hem.

THE SPORTS ARE
STILL AT SEA
No Gauge on Which They
Can Base Their
Betting.
In a Quandary as to the Cor
bett-Fitzsimmons Priz2-
Fight.
There Will Be a Great Deal of Money
on the Cal-iornian at the
Ringside.
The local sports would like to know ex
actly where they ''are at" in regard to
the betting on the Corbett-Fitzsimmons
contest, which is booked for March 17 in
Nevada.
As a matter of fact there has not been a
single bet made, either here or in the
East, which might bo taken as a gauge
for the consideration of others.
Colonel Abe Daniels, the representative
of Phil Dwyer here in other matters, is a
fair criterion to go by in affairs sporty,
ana he derides the telegraphic reports
from tbe East of heavy-weight bets at
odds of $10,000 to 17000, such as have been
wired across the continent.
"It is the same thing in New York as it
is here," he stated last evening at the
Baldwin Hotel. "Over there they are
getting messages in regular channels that
Corbett is a 10 to 7 favorite out in Califor
nia, which is not a tact. So far as I have
been able to find it here, Fitzsimmons is a
strong man, and at this time, at least, 1
find even money offered me. 1 take it, of
course, for I am a strong Corbett backer
and believe I am getting a shade the best
of the wagers. However, 1 must say there
is little money in sight at this time and 1
have not been able to get more than a few
hundred dollars on the result.
"Corbett has many moneyed friends in
tbe East, and I have no doubt that this
will affect the odds to a great extent.
These friends will be satisfied to wager
even money for the time being, but I
doubt if they will care to give odds ex
cepting in large amounts, such as $10,030
to $9000, until they reach the ringside.
Then I feel sure there will be a great dif
ference. The heavy betters of the country
will be there, and they are nearly all Cor
bett men. The weight of their money
must necessarily be felt, and 1 would not
be astonished if odds of 2 to 1 were given.
"Take, for instance, such men as Ed
Kearney and Ed Kearney Jr., JacK Mc-
Donald, Mattie Corbett, "Smiling"
Johnny Kelly, H. Knanp. John Hun
ter, Phil Dwyer and Billy Edwards, who
is the custodian of a bank account de
posited with him by clubmen whose af
fairs he attends to. These men swear by
Cor bet L When he fought Sullivan they
believed in the young Californian, and he
told them he would not go near Sullivan
for three rounds. He told them, abo,
that he would do out-fighting for a half
dozon or more rounds, and then, when he
would have the big fellow worried, he
would mix up with him.
"Jim carried the programme through
and won is fight. He did the same
thing when he fought Charley Mitchell
and again he carried the programme out
according to his promise. The result is
that Corbett, to-day, could get backing to
the extent ot $100,000 if needed to tight
any man on earth. This is not necessary,
but. the very men who would gladly
make up the purse for him will be at the
ringside and it is quite natural they will
be ready to put up any amount the other
side might want to bet on Fitzsimmons.
"As 1 said before, it will be at the ring
side that the heavy betting will be done.
"Corbett has notified his friends this
time as he did in his past engagement-*-,
not to bet on the number of rounds but
on the resulL"
The local sports are still in a quandary
as to the line of action they are to take.
Whether they will join private parties to
Nevada or go on their own individual ac
count will depend greatly on the financial
tax. The excursion managers cannot as
yet present their prospectus for the reason
that Dan Stuart, the promoter of the tight,
has not settled whether Carson or Reno
will get the affair. Hence rates have not
yet been made by the railroad company
and cannot be handed down to the people.

the past week. He is one of the suave
DEAN A. C. PECK.
Rev. A. C. Feck, field superintendent of the Christian Missionary Alliance,
came over from Beulah, where he has been stopping since his arrival, to preach
at Dr. Dille' church tbis morning. The subject of his sermon was "What Consti
tutes Christianity?" and it was listened to by a large and enthusiastic congrega
tion. Last night he spoke at Grace Episcopal Church, taking his text from the
fourth chapter of Kings.
Mr. Peck was very much delighted with Southern California and with Beulah.
He says he "would like to remain here, but â 'business calls.' "
The Christian Alliance has been in existence fifteen years and ha 3 200,000
members. It is interdenominational and so interferes with no one's religious
ideas. It preaches what is callel a four-fold gospelâ Christ the Savior, sancti
fier, healer nnd coming King. There are over '.00 missionaries in foreign fields
and a chain of missions clear across the continent.
At the Old Orchard, Me., convention $270,000 was subscribed, and this was
duplicated at the October convention in New York.
The dean will preach in Oakland next Sunday and then he will go to Oregon

in hopes of running against Wheelock or
Stuart with a view to making Elko the
place if the Carson-Reno controversy be
came too acrid. As Wheelock left this
city and Stuart will pass through Nevada

back to catch them and present Elko's
claims.
Jim Corbett is expected to arrive here
next Wednesday. His brother Harry, who

ROBERT WIELAND IS WELL
Ho Has ll.M.ovored After an Illness
That Hi-ought ll> in Into the

Robert P. Wieland, who has been lying
at the point of death since Monday last at
his home, 2120 California street, will be
out again for an hour or two today.

R. P. Wieland.
iar young men about town, a son of the
late John Wieland, and whose generosity,
is to be seen in every charitable society
among tbe Germans in this City, and a
brother of Charles and Albert Wieland,
has had a rather narrow escape.
He was a bosom friend of Henry Man
pels of the firm of Tillmann, Bendel it Co.,
who died ten days ago, quite suddenly.
Robert Wieland was so struck by the
death of his friend that he was taken sick
himself Monday last with hemorrhage of
the stomach. His life was despaired of for
several days, but his magnificent physique
pulled him through.
There has been a strange fatality in the
Wieland family, and the friends of Robert
will gladly welcome his escape from it.
John Wieland and one of his daughters
were burned to death some ten or twelve
years ago, the father meeting his fate
while endeavoring to rescue the young
girls. Mrs. Wieland, the mother, died al
most suddenly about five years ago. Since
then Robert's young wife, one of .he most
beautiful women in this State, passed
away quits suddenly. His brother-in
law, Mr. Gregory, also died a year apo
after an illness of only two days in Cripple
Creek.

LONG LITIGATION
ABOUT SETTLED
The Miller & Lux Legal
Difficulties Drawing to
a Close.
The Papers Will Probably Be
Signed Within the Next
Week.
Concessions Mad. by Both Sides
Basis of Settlement Not Yet
M de Pub
After years of fighting in and out of the
courts the affairs of the vast Miller & Lux
estate are about to be settled to the satis
faction of all concerned.
In fact, the basis of settlement has al
ready been agreed upon, and all that is
now needed to close the matter up is to
arrange a few minor details and sign the
documents that will attest the rights of
the parties interested in the property.
The matter was brought to a focus on
Saturday last, when a meeting of the at
torneys for both sides was held. Certain
concessions were made by each of the
legal representatives, and it was agreed
that the necessary papers are to be drawn
up very shortly. The exact nature of the
settlement will not be known for several
days, as both sides are anxious to avoid
any further complications which might
arise through premature statements.
It is known, however, that the settle
ment has been arranged with the idea of
placing the big estate under the control of
a corporation which will keep it intact
and carry on lhe various enterprises Irom
which the princely Miller & Lux fortune
was built.
The trouble over the estate began some
time after the death of Mr. Lux, which
took place several years ago. Mrs. Miranda
Lux, his widow, was not satistied to leave
the business in tbe hands oi Henry Miller,
the surviving partner, and asked to have
the affairs of the firm wound up. This did
not meet with Mr. Miller's approval and
an action for an accounting was begun.
During the progress of the litigation Mrs.
Lux died, but her heirs carried on the
suit, which was fought bitterly in the
courts by the test legal talent of this City.
For several months past overtures have
been made from both sides looking toward
a cessation 01 hostilities, the consulta
tions finally resulting as stated.
Attorney Thomas B. Bishop, who has
taken a prominent part in the litigation,
i confirmed the rumor of a settlement last
evening.
"The matter has taken a very favorable
turn recently," he said, "and it now ap
pears as though the long litigation is at
'â¢ an end. There are yet some details to be
arranged, but the heaviest part of the
business is over with.
"At present I cannot give the basis of i
the settlement for several reasons.
The main one is that the matter can
not be said to be entirely settled un'il the
necessary formalities are over, and it
would be indiscreet, as well as a breach of
confidence on my part, to say anything of
the nature oi the settlement beyond the
fact that it is under way. The details will
be known shortly â probably within a
week. " ' "
The Miller & Lux estate, which is one
of the largest in California, grew from a
very small beginning. The firm were
cattle-dealers in a limited way in early
times, and, being shrewd business men,
took advantage ot the big opportunities
for money-making in those flush days.
Profits were invested in lands as fast as
they accrued, and the fortune grew to its
present vast proportions.
