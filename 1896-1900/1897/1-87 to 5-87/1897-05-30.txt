COLONEL VASSOS IS BECOMING
AMBITIOUS.
Thinks He Can Fortify tha Historic
Pass of Thermopylae and
Make It Impregnable.
[Copyrighted, i 897, by the New York Sun.]
LONDON, Eko., May 29.â 80 th sides
desire to gain time before peace is con
cluded between Turkey and Greece.
There is no longer a doubt that the ne
gotiations will be long and tedious. The
state of public opinion in both countries
is one of the reasons why the terms will
linally be more moderate tuan the mil
itary party in Turkey would now tolerate,
and more severe than the Greeks now ac
cept. There must be an opportunity to
moderate the feeling on both sides before
a conclusion is reached. The greatest
danger still is the Greeks' recklessness
and oossibility of revolutions in Athens.
While there is no verification of yester
day's reports that King George was bar
ricaded in the palace and ready to fly in
case of an uprising, the situation is crit
ical, and it would be folly to inform the
Greeks of the onerous conditions of peace.
The Porte is now quibbling over the point
that there has not yet been an official
armistice. When this is seltied the
cumbrous process of negotiating begins,
and will continue as long as the Sultan
enjoys that form of amu -eraent. It may
easily be prolonged ail summer when
there is such a grotesque concern as the
concert of Europe to deal with.
Tnis process may easily become a de
vice for offsetting Great Britain's sudden
revival of independence in refusing to
consent to Turkey occupying Thessaiy
even temporarily. The mystery of the in
dividual attitude of the powers is as great
as ever. The Sultan and Kaiser continue
to exchange telegrams expressive of
mutual admiration.
The Sun's Stamboul correspondent tele
graphs to-night that Germany \s al->o tak
ing full financial advantage of her pecu
liar friendship with the Turk. A special
train left Stamboul to-flay for Koniah
conveying Schrader and Zinder, agents of
the Puetscbe Bank, Kuhlmann, manaser
of the Anatolian railways, Grosho.'ze,
manager of the Oriental railways, and
other members of the railway extansion
scheme, to inspect the various projects
emanating from the Duetsche Brink
group. The chief point of interest is
whether these schemes harmonizs with
the Russian plans.
IN LEONIDAS' ROLE.
But Colonel Vassos Ha? Rather
Raw Material From Which to
Make Heroes.
LONDON, Esq., May 29.â An experi
enced Swiss officer, who has just been ex
ploring the country around Thermopylae,
writes that the historic pass is being
strongly fortified, and Colonel Vassos of
Cretan fame has announced his intention
to hold it against any army Edhoru Pasha
dare bring up.
This is vaporing against cold facts.
Vassos, wno aspires to piay the role of
Leonidas, brought from Athens four or
five thousand so-called soldiers, nearly
half of whom had never previously held a
gun. All are raw and undisciplined and
most unpromising material from which
to make heroes. Ynsse*, however, is do
ing bin best, fie has a number of engi
neer officers, under whose directions
strong earthworks are being thrown ur>.
But Thermoplvie is not what it was in
the. heroic ace of Greece. It is now nearly
2000 yards wide, and Edhem Pasha, with
his splendid artillery, would have little
difficulty in forcing a passage.
It is reported hrre that the Turks have
occupied Tsoponates in the neutral zone
and tbe Greeks have protested against
the Turkish advance into forbidden terri
tory.

ween Greece and Turkey, and with leas
prospect than ever before of arranging
matters on a permanent basis, satisfactory
to themselves and to t.'ae twe ii&tioi.u prin
cipally concerned.
The Sultan ol Turkey stands to-day in a
very d.fferent t>osition from" that which he
occupied in 1878, when the Congress of
Berlin took from him Thessaly and a part
of Epirus and gave it to the Greeks, as
from that of his predecessor, Mahraoud
11, who, after a Ion? war, with his naval
power destroyed at Navarino and a French
army in the Morea, was obliged at the
] jint dictation of Russia, France and iUng
land T o acknowledge the independence of
Greece and accept sucii boundary limits
from the latter as they proposed.
With a vicorious army of over 80,000
men occupying all of Thessaly and Lpirus
and a reserve of 200,000 more at hand, tbe
majority of his people enthusiastically
supporting him and demanding that he
retain all that he has conquered and the
Slieik-ul-I-lam advising him that it is the
will of heaven that he shouki do so, Abdul
Hamid is in a position to dictate terms of
peace and boundaries rather than be com
pelled to accept what the powers see tit to
allow him.
He ha 9 again acquired by force of arm<
what was taken from him in 1878, when
he was weak and humbled, and he Has the
precedents of German retention of ti:e
Danish provinces and of Alsace and Lor
raine to sustain him in tha face oi Europe,
and, although the powers declared at the
ouiset that no matter how the war re
sulted, neither Greece nor Turkey should
make any territorial acquisition, at least
t^vo of them, Russia and Germany, are in
clined io recede from that position in
favor of Turkey, while Eneland and
France are more fixed than ever in their
determination that the "status quo ante
belium" shall be observed.
In commenting on the first settlement of
the boundary question in 1831, an eminent
English authority, thoroughly familiar
with every point involved, said that "it
would never be settled permanently until
it was settled right, and that that should
have been done then, when the time and
circumstances were opportune."
Greece has always regarded Tbesatly
and Lower Epirus as naturally belonging
to her. The majority of their people are
Greeks, and they took a most active part
in the struggle for independence, though
not avowed to reap any of the fruits, the
powers relegating the country of Bozzaris
and his compatriois to Turkish rule.
While Greece took no active nart against
Turkey at the time of the Russo-Turkish
war nnd her name was not even men
tioned in the treaty of San Stephano, a
well-timed uprising about Dhomoko, in
Thessaly, in 1878, brought the question
before the Berlin Congress and it was
proposed that all of Thessaly and Epirus
proper should be given to Greece. This
would have put the boundary on the
crests of thb Amaches and the Pindus
mountains, for the most part natural
barriers and cut by gaps or practicable
passes in but few places. Strong opposi
tion was -hewn to this, however, especi
ally by Russia, and a compromise was
finally effected on a line which left
Turkey Mount Oiympus and the upper
parr, of Thessaly and all of Epirus north
of Janina and ihe Kalamas River. Tho
delimitation of this boundary was left to
Greece and Turkey. A part of it, between
Olympus and Metrovo, was surveyed and
marked in 1881 and subsequently, but in
spite of all her urging and diplomacy
Greece was never able to pet an inch of
territory beyond the Arta River. Turkey
beld on fast to Lower Epii 113. .

EL PASO. Tex., May 29.â The water
in the submerged portion of the city has
fallen eight inches during the last twenty
four hours, but as the Hoods con Unue to
pour into the crevasses above the city
the situation remains practically un
changed.
While there has been considerable suf
fering among the hundreds of homeless
poor their condition is hourly improving
and the majority are now sheltered by
tents and temporary sheds. The hospital
tent erected by the Board of Health is
crowded, but so iar there have been no
deaths. Aid has been asked from Con
gress and from the State Legislature, and
it is believed that the responses will be
prompt from both sources and that in a
few days the flood victims will no longer
be dependent upon haphazard charity.
The attempt to close the crevasses above
the city was abandoned this morning, tut
it is expected that the river will have
fallen sufficiently by to-morrow to permit
the resumption of work. Another rise is
expected to reach here by Wednesday, but
by that time it is hoped to i.aye the levees
repaired, and prevent the inundation of
the business portion of the town, which
has been so seriously threatened. The
Santa Fe road succeeded to-day in repair
ing the washout at Selden, and resumed
traffic over its own line.

[Copyrighted 1897 by the New York Bun.]
LONDON, Eng., May 29.â There is much
mysiery aboni the recent movements of
Kine' Leopold. Last week the official
court chronicler in Brussels stive out the
customary paragraphs of Ihe Kind's do
ings there, wflile all the time his Majesty
was strolling about London seeing the
jubilee preparations. Some say he nerpe
trated n little joke by proceeding to Shef
tieid Jast week when the Q 'een paid a
state vwt to that city, ana the old lady
was scared to see her royal kinsman on
foot in the front line of a big crowd of en
thiuiastic YorKshirernen. Whether the
sto-y is true, it is certain that last Sunday
he suddenly started after her Maj>sty and
traveled to Balmoral as an ordinary pas
senger. After seeing the Queen the King
made tracks for Glasgow, where his yacht
was opportunely anchored, and sailed
Wednesday for parts unknown. The ves
sel was jealously guarded and the King
selected the witching hour of midnight
for joining her.

(Copyrighted 1897 by the New York Sun.]
LONDON, Eng , May Â£9.â Nothing more
has been heard of the suirsiestioa to ap
point the Duke of Teck Governor-General
of Canada. Even iiis friends have ceased
the advocacy of bis claims. Curiously
enough, just at this moment a tight is
being made here against the Yukon Com
pany, of which the Duke is a member,
and which desires, apparently, to pobbie
up the best parts of British Columbia by
means of royal charter. The Liberal
members of Parliament are on the watch
for an opportunity to raise a debate on
the Yukon business and even political
women have been pressed into service
against the poor Duke, who cenainiy
never did them any barm. Thus the
Women's Liberal Association solemnly
assembled in conference a day or two ago
and passed a resolution denouncing all
chartered companies, with special refer
ence to the infamous South African Com
pany, and calling upon the Government
to erant no charters, which demand is di
rectly leveled at the Duke of feck and the
Yukon grant.
WILLIAM IS NOT WANTED.
Leading Frenchmen Ridicule ihe Idea o/
the German Emperor P.ymg a
Visit to Paris.
PARIS, France, May 29.â A momentous
topic is how to treat the Emperor of Ger
many if he comes to the French capital.
The Gaulois has been sound ni; politicians
and authors and the responses are almost
unanimous against the Emperor coming
to Paris. Mme. Adam thinks that Paris
and the French people would be the
laughing-stock of Europe if the Emperor
were to c^rue. Morris Barres thinks that
Paris might stone the Etnperor to death.
"It would be misfortune," he adds, "if
they did not."
Other replies oscillate between these
opinions. An eminent person who as
sumes to know ihe Emperor's mind says:
'The Emperor quite appreciates the re
buff he lias lately received. He expected
it, but has not changed hia intentions on
that account. It is a fixed resolve with
him to come to Paris and as a friend, and
he will find means of coming."

THE PRISON A CAGE OF WILD
ANIMALS.
The Great Strike Is Growing and
Revolt Is Seething In Ail
Departments.
SAN QUENTIN, Cal., May 29.â The
State Prison is a cave of wild beasts. The
animal in the convicts is loose and has
turned on his keeper. The huge bastile is
seething with revolt. Order has been
superseded by terror. Discipline is
maintained only by confining one-half the
inmates in gloomy cells. The great por
tion of the remainder are taciturn and
surly.
Matters are growing worse.
The striped felon showed his teeih omi
nously to-day. Tired of rieid restraint
and limited diet, he sought to break leave
his cage. A general prison break was
only thwnrted when the bullets of the
sentries' rifles cowed them.
Seventy of the 700 men who refused to
go to work in the jutemill on Thursday
morning for a time precipitated a panic in
the big bastile. Succeeding in getting out
of their dungeons, where they have been
confined for the past two days, th6y pro
ceeded to wrench the iron doors cf the
various dark cells from their hinges. Cell
wails were partially demolished with the
aid of improvised iron tools. The con
victs then sought to cut their way through
the floors to an engine-room beneath,
where they Hoped to hide until cover of
night and then make a concerted attempt
to scale the walls.
With the wrecked iron doors of their
cages tne prisoners made a barricade
against interruption. When the guards
would carry this fortress they were beaten
back with bricks and other missiles. It
was only when, a volley of bullets rattled
against the breastworks that the men
ha. ted, and under the protection of Winr
cheater rifles the guards were allowed to
beat down the obstacle with sledgeham
mers and subdue the prisoners.
The dungeon of the prison is situated
over the engine and cooking room of the
dining quarters. The dungeons are four
teen in number, gloomy,. forbidding, cav
ernous cells opening into a corridor.
In these dark holes were confined the
men whom the prison authorities su^prct
of being the leaders of the present .rebel
lion. The men were assigned five to a
cell, on a bread and water diet, on Thurs
day morning last. Confinement in this
quarter is enforced on only the most re
fractory prisoners. Figuratively speaking
it is the core ol the prison, and until to

day it was supposed to be escape proof.
Now its interior is a mass of ruins.
It was tais portion of the prison that
Guard Sullivan attempted to enter at 3:30
o'clock, for the purpose of inspecting the
dungeons. The entrance to the corridor
leads through double-doors. Outside is
an immense iron gate sw;n4Jng on heavy
hinges imbedded in solid masonry.
A few steps further there is a big
wooden door â a heavy, thick affair of oak
â with a small wicket to let in the light.
Sullivan, accompanied by Guards Slaven,
Connolly and Anderson, proceeded into
the corridor. The iron door was clc3Â»d be
hind them by way of precaution. The
moment the lock was turned in the wooden
door Sullivan and bis comrades were sur
prised to find some of the prisoners in the
corridor. The convicts at the same time
made a sudden assault on the guards,
in hopes of overpowering them and lock
ing them insi ie.
There was a hand to hand scrimmage
in the guards' favor. They hurriedly put
the wooden door behind them for pro
tection, while the convicts proceeded to
fortify themselves. Those who were al
ready in the corr.dor proceeded to batter
down the iron doors and gratings. Rivets
and locks were wrenched from the walls
with improvised crowbars.
Soon the whole mo b hsd access to the
corridors. The doors of their cells
were torn from their, hinges by the com
bined force of many men and with these
a wall of iron was built inside the wooden
gate. Behind the formidable barricade
wes placed a jute sack filled witti ball and
chain.
Sullivan, upon gaining the outer door of
the corridor, immediately reported the
progress of affairs to Captains Beriera and
Elgar. He returned to the corridor en
irarice only to discover tbat it wes but
tressed witiiin with all sorts ol prison fur
niture. Captain Beriem ordered the sen
iries on the â wall to open lire on the corri
dor entrance. Encouraged by the fusilade
fcu.livan, Connolly. Slaver, and Anderson,
armed with sledgehammers, attacked the
barricaded den. Ten minutes o: pummel
ing made a bole biÂ£ enough to ailow Snl
livan to see how matters stood inside. He
was received with a brick. A second of
this sort of missile caught Guard Connolly
in thetemrle, inflicting an ugly wound.
another glanced along the roof of
Guard Randolph's bead.
The onslaught with sledge-hammers
was renewed. The entrance cleared, Sul
l.van and his companions, re-enforced by
Warden Hale, entered the corridor, while
Captain Beriein and a jqnad of sentries
covered their advance with Winchesters.
Before this formidable force the men re
tired to the dark ceils with curses and
yells. Demands tor explanations of their
conduct were answered with a volley of
oaths.
Warden Hale, after inspecting the ruins
about him, ordered the men removed to
the cells in the south tankhouse. This
wus accomplished without incident, and
half an hour later the unruly convicts
were behind grated bars bellowing their
billingsgate to every officer or guard that
passed within earshot. The dungeons are
a mass of ruins. Everything that it was
possible to destroy shared that fate. Even
the walls were burrowed in places.
But it was not until complete order was
restored that the prison authorities real
ized just how serious a crisis tiiey had
avoided. The devastation of the dungeons
was attributed to pure malice until some
excavations in the floor were discovered.
Guard Sullivan had heard the order to
"dig down" repeatedly given inside,
as he was attempting to effect an
.entrance to the corridor, and these
excavations added peculiar signifi
cance to the words. It was the plan
of the convicts to die; down through the
floor to the engine-room beneath. Once
there the men would have no difficulty in
secreting themselves, providing the ab
ence from the dungeons was not discov
ered. Access to the yard could be effected
without any difficulty and the cover of
the night hour afforded an otsportunity to
attempt a general prison break to men
made desperate with hunger and the fear
of further dark confinement.
The plan might have succeeded, al
though it is probable that in its execution
Borne of the convicts would have fallen
under the bullets of the sentries. Hereto
fore there have been only eight guards on
duty at night. An attack from behind
might have disarmed one, or even two,
and the way would then be open to bay
the remainder one by one by the holdup
system. The prison officials are not
speculating along these lines. Instead,
they doubled the number of guards and
sentries to-night. The remainder of the
prison force is sleeping on their arms,
within calling distance. The Gatlin? guns
are trained directly on the tank cells.
The general situation is very grave.
The prisoners thus far seem to be masters
of the prison, notwithstanding locks and
bars. Tne fires are out in the jutemill,
and the police force organized into a re
serve sentry squad. The refractory con
victs are growing bolder and more inso
lent under their severe punishment.
Above the walls of the prisou there is
constantly arising the roar of curses and
oatus. The echoes may be hear 1 a mile
away. There is nardly a minute in the
day when the convicts are not bellowing
defiance to their keepers. Outside the
prison there is almost as much turmoil.
The families of the guards fear that the
reething mass of vicious humanity may
break over its confines. The actions of
t tie sentries' rifles this afternoon brought
the whole population of the tow& of San
Quentin out of their houses. Women and
children slood about in terror-stricken
groups. They climbed the neighboring
hills to see what was going on behind the
gray wails of the prison and besieged and
waylaid all guards lor news.
General R. H. Warfield's presence about
the prison in the morning gave rise to a
rumor that Warden Hale had invoked the
aid of the State militia.
The story grew as it traveled from
mouth to mouth, and the more imagina
tive began to conjure up visions of blood
shed and massacre, that would send
.Stephen Crane to an idiot asylum. But
the commander of the militia was not on
official business. Warfield has other busi
ness besides commanding citizen soldiers,
and this morning he was endeavoring to
close a contract with Warden Hale to sup
ply the prison with ice from the San
llafael Hotel.
The convicts show no sign of capitulat
ing. Three days on bread and water,
without exercise, baa not apparently
weakened their spirit, although their
lungs are giving out signs of wear and
tear.
From their places of confinement the
mutinous mill-workers are able to peer
through the openings in the iron doors
and see. who passes in the prison-yard.
When Captain Edgar or Warden Hale ap
pear in the yard it is s signal for a ereat
outburtt and curses rent the air. It is the
same with the other officers, but not quite
so pronounced.
To-night the same howling and pound
ing was continued as made the night cre
vious so bideoua. The guards who had
been on duty all day were unable to eleep
on account of the confusion, and what
â atches of slumber they obtained were
caught during the intervals when from
sheer exhaustion the convict 3 were forced
to remain quiet.
The tanks on the top slory of the stone
building are entirely constructed of iron
and in each one eight men are confined.
The men grab whatever is within reach
and all together they pound upon the big
stretch of iron. The result is a deafening
noue. This pleases them, and to add to
the confusion tney raise their voices in
chorus and shout until hoarse.
The bread-and-water diet has been cut
down. Twice a day the men were given
their allotted portion of bread and water,
but now they receive it but once a day.
Less than half a loaf of bread and a tin of
water is their daily fare. They received
this at 11 o'clock to-day. It is not a diet
upon which they can grow fat.
The strikers are among the mostdes
perate criminals in the prison. Oliver G.
Winthrop was already in the dungeon
when the mob was brought in to keep
him company. Last night six of the bul
lets from the sentries' rifles were found in
his pockets.
To-night a further punishment was
meted out to the rebels. All beds, cloth
ing, stools, candlesticks, tables and furni
ture of any Kind was removed from the
cells.
The convicts watched the progress of
the work without comment. The con
victs have nothing but concrete floors to
sleep on and their uniform as a covering.
As they are packed to the limit of the cu
bic-air ordinance, they will probably not
suffer much discomfort from the coid.
Warden Hale finds this strike a problem
much larger than any ue has heretofore
been called upon 10 solve. He is worried
and anxious. The origin of tho trouble is
a matter of conjecture to him, but on the
outside of the prison it is sa d that it ha.
been brewing for months.
The Board of Prison Directors will
probably convene in sprciai session early
next week, to consider the situation. One
of the plans advocated ty Director Wii
knis is the transfer of at least twenty of
the leaders of the strike to Foieora.
The prison authorities have decided to
close the prison and proumis to visitors
during tue present trouble. Tne strike is
becoming contagious, and even the
women convicts in their sympathy now
hoot and jeer their attendants.
MEXICAN RAiLWAY CHANGES.
Flans fcr Extensive Bern flections of the
Occidental Lne n the State
of Son or a.
HERMOSILLO, Bokoea, Mexico. May
29. â Railway changes oJ great importance
are taking place here now. Hugh Tudor
Richard?, formerly general managsr of
the Sonora Railway and the present holder
of a splendid concession for orange Jands
near this city, has procured an option on
the Occidental Railway of Siuaioa. This
railroad runs from the port of Altata xn
the Gulf of California to Culiacan, capital
of the State of Sinaloa, and in conjunction
with it is a line of coasting steamers,
among them the Aitata and Porfirio Diaz,
which ply between Altata and Agiabam
po, Penhuete, Mazatlan, La Paz and
Guayraas.
Richards represents a syndicate of
American caDitalists, and stock in the new
euterpnso will be held by parties in San
Francisco, Denver and Chicago. The Oc
cidental Railway Company al?o own a
valuable concession from the Mexican Gov
ernment for a line Jrom Culiacan to Salinas
del Fenon Blanco, according to the last
modification of which the Government
agreed to grant a subvention of $8300 a
kilometer, payable in 5 per cent inte
rior redeemable debt bonds, which the
company is to take at par, against $8000 a
kilometer, payable in special 6 per cent
subsidy bonds taken at par.
The intention of the syndicate is to com
plete the road to Durango and also make
its port terminus in the magnificent har
bor recently discovered by Colonel Wrot
nosky, twenty miles south of Altata, at
the new mouth of the Culiacan River.
The principal stockholders of the Occi
dental Railway Company are Sebastian
Camacho of Mt-xco and Robert R.
Symond of .London. The price at which
they agree to part with the construcied
line and concession is $720,000 in eroid,
payable as to the first $50 000 on taking
over the property, $50,000 in July next
and the balance in installments, of which
the last is payable in January, 1809.
Another exceedingly important change
in railway ownership is the sale of the
Sonora Railway (Nogales to Guaymas) to
Collis P. huntington, which is now a con
summated lact, the transfer having been
approved by the Government through the
instrumentality of Hon. Sebastian
Camacho, representative of the Sonora
Railway Company.

lets In His Body-Story of
a Witness.
CHATTANOOGA, Te>n., May 29. -On
the borders of the Chickamauga National
Park, dedicated to the memory of one of
tho bloodiest campaigns of the Civil War,
a feud of Jong standing ended to-day in a
terrible tragedy. Judge Frank O-ibourne,
a prominent North Georgia farmer and
magistrate, and L. J. Barber were the
principals. The former, who was the
aggressor, fell dead in his tracks with five
pistol balls in hi 3 body fired by Barber.
The meeting wr.s an accidental ons in a
etore at Crawfish Springs, the eastern en
trance to the park. Osbourne, spying his
old enemy,, advanced with a drawn knife
in one hand and a olow-point in the other.
Barber stood a f->w moments undecided,
until Osbourne flourished the weapons
almost in his face. Then drawing his pis
tol he emptied the five chambers in rapid
succession into his antagonist, who in
stant lv fell dead.
Barber coolly contemplated his work,
then turning lie walked to tne telegraph
station, where he fent two messages, one
to the Sheriff at the county seat, telling
him what he had done, and ihe other to
Cnattanooga retaining* a lawyer. The
Sheriff arrested Barber.
As the dead man had frequently threat
ened Barber's life the latter went con
stantly armed. Osbourne's friends are
incensed and further bloodshed is prob
able. Barber is car inspector for the Chat
tanooga, Rome and Columbus Railroad, a
man of quiet demeanor and excellent rep
utation. His victim was a farmer of con
siderable means and wide influence in
North Georgia.
Storekeeper Bond wa3 the only eye-wit
ness. Bond is quoted as say ins that Bar
ber began the altercation by demanding
of Osbourne if it was true that he had been
talking about his (Barber's)wife. Osbourne
replied affirmatively and immediately put
himself on the defensive.

ARCHITECT JUcKISt IS JLA'&SI.
Withdraw* Bit Vift of "The Bacchante"
from Hr.it on't Public Library,
BOSTON, Mass., May 29.â Architect
McKira has withdrawn his gift of the
bronze statue of "The Bacchante" from
the Boston public library, and is very in
dignant at the way in which his gift was
received. Architect McKim is a man of
great wealth and is able to gratify his ar
tistic tastes. When he presented the now
famous statue to the Boston library he
felt that the gift was one that would
greatly add to the attractiveness of the in
stitution, and was gren tly surprised when
he learned that the officers of the library
were hesitating about accepting the work
on the ground that it was of an immoral
character.
Many months have passed since the of
fer was made to the library, and as it was
not formally accepted McKim at last grew
tired and has now withdrawn it. He is
very outspuken in his opinion of people
whose prudery is so great that it pre
vents their appreciation of art, and calls
attention to the fact that copies of the fa
mous statue are now exhibited in the prin
cipal art galleries of Europe.

SPORT AT PACIFIC GROVE.
Students' Conference Delegates Test
Their Prowess on the Cinder
Path.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 29â The
field-day sports were the feature of to
day's proceedings of the Pacific Coast
Students' Conference. The regular events
were delayed by the tennis doubles.
These were not finished, butGifford(Stan
iord) and Belcher (Berkeley) led by a score
of 10-8 over Willis and Lewis of the
facility.
Reno Hutchinson, one of Berkeley's
football eleven, was chairman of the ath
letic committee and managed the events
of the !;cid day in a businesslike and
praiseworthy manner.
The first event of the afternoon was the
75-yard handicap dash, won by Hart of
Pacific Grove. In the 100-yard dash,
Leavitt (Stanford) won, with Ferguson
second. The half-mile run went to Smith
(Stanford), with Willey second.
Swan (Berkeley) won the snotput, put
ting the shot 34 feet 4'^ inches. Ballou of
the University of Southern California won
the hammer-throw. His throw was 92
feet.
Stanford's champion mile - walker,
Adams, came out strong in the walking
contest and won easily over a bit; handi
cap. Swan of Berkeley was second.
No remarkable jumping was done dur
ing the afternoon. The highest jump was
made by Holman, and the running broad
jumD by Hart, both Pacific Grove do vs.
The latter part of the afternoon was de
voted to ridiculous events in which the
faculty took part, to make sport for the
students. The first of these, a three-legged
race, Gifford and Smith (Stanford) won
easily, with Bradley and Brown closejsec
ond. Smith (Stantord) also won the po
tato race, with Michener second. The
sack race was hotly contested and was im
mensely absurd. Swan (Berkeley) sot
over the allotted space in the shortest
time. The elephant and obsiacle races
were the most enjoyed by the large crowd
of spectators because of the fun they
afforded. Dietz and Brown did the best
work as an elephant, and Smith beat all
his competitors in getting over fences and
ropes, eating crackers, etc.

by Bank Failures Preceded
tbe Deaths.
It Is Believed tbe Women Despaired
After Losing a Fortune L:ft
by an Uncle.
LOWELL, Mass., May 29. âThe bodies
of Mans and Frances Butlor, two un
marnei women who were about 50 years
old, who have resided at 85 Washington
street, this city, for about sixteen years,
were found on the kitchen floor of their
home this morning. Both apparently
had been dead for several hours, from
asphyxiation by gas, and It 13 believed
they committed suicide because of heavy
financial losses due to the failure of sev
eral banks in Nashua.
The women were sisters and were nieces
of the late ex- United States Senator
Grime of Oiiio. When the ex-Senator died
he left them considerable money and
they inves:ei it largely through the banks
in Nashua. When the financial difficul
ties overtook the banks there it is. said tbe
women lost heavily.
When the deaths were reDorted the in
spectors burst in a iear window and found
it impossible for a time to enter, owing to
the odor of gas. They found the eas jet,
which would have allowed connection by
a tube or pipe to a gas stove, turned on.
On the floor, near the kitchen stove, were
the bodies of the two women. A hassock
had been placed on the floor and both
heads were lying upon it. Tfte face of
one of the women had the appearance of
a person who had died suddenly of apo
plexy. The face of the other was that of
one in a dreamless sleep. Across the oven
door and up on the stovepipe were the
nightdresses, as if the women were pre
par.ng to retire.
Beyond the fact that their funds are
tied up in some of the savings banks of
Nassaua which were recently obliged to
go into the hands of a receiver there does
not appear to be any cause for the suicide.
The women are reported to have been of
a cheerful, sanguine disposition.

CLARKSBURG, W. Va., May 29 â
During a performance at the Sparks
oircm last evening, two trained horses
began to fight. The animals were very
vicious, and as they bit and struck at one
another with their hoofs the great crow 1
in tbe tent rather enjoyed the exhibition.
Finally one of the horses broke sway
from the other and rushed unon the seats
where the woineu and children were a
seru Wed.
Instantly there was the greatest kind
of panic. Peocle began to fight their way
out of danger, and the helplesn ones were
trodden under foot without cny mercy.
The ciic s people did all they couid to
avert the disaster, but their efforis were
in vain. For fully fifteen minutes the
greatest confusion reigned. Many people
rushed frantically hither and ihitherana
absolutely refused to listen to any direc
tions as to keeping qufer.
After tbe tent had been erup'ied it was
found that Helen Berry and Mnnie
Aliman were lying on the ground. Doctors
who were cancel to the scene at once
made a careiul examination of '.he two
giris and sai'i that they were in a dy^ng
condition. They were badly bruised by
the people tramping on them.
A number of other people who managed
to reach the/r homes are bndly injured.
Altogether the people of the town are
greatly depre&saa over the sad ace.dent.

THE TARIFF BILL
Five More Paragraphs
Disposed Of by the
Senate.
No Session to Be Held on Mon
day in Order to Honor Vet
erans' Memories.
Morgan Takes Occasion to Arraign
the Method of Procedure In
the House.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 29.-The
Senate gave four hours to the tariff hill
to-day and disposed of just five para
graphs (100 to 104 inclusive), all relating
to plate plass. Those paragraphs gave
rise to a vast deal of discussion, but all
attempts to reduce the rates below those
recommended by the Finance Committee
were defeated by majorities of 7 to 10.
All committee amendments were adopted.
The most notable event of the day was
a discussion started by a proposition to
observe Monday (Decoration day) as a
holiday. The motion was antagonized by
Hale, Proctor and Aldrich and enthusi
astically supported by Pettus and Mor
gan. The latter launched out into an
arraignment of the House and Speaker at
their course in blocking ail legislation.
He considered it a matter of grave doubt
whether the House, having abandoned its
post, had not thereby worked the dissolu
tion of the whole Congress. He was
finally arrested on this arraignment by a
point of order and when he took the floor
again he transferred his attention to the
tariff bill, which was designed, he said,
not for protection, but to pay bounties to
lordly masters of spindles and looms, rail
road corporations and trusts.
The tariff bill was taken up on motion
of Aldrich, who called up the paragraph
relating to china, crockery, porcelain, etc.,
which had been passed over. Aldrich, in
behalf of the committee, withdrew tne
Senate amendments to paragraphs 93 and
91, and stated that the House provisions
would be allowed to stand.
Jones of Arkansas objected to the par
tial consideration of the china schedule.
It was finally agreed to let the entire
schedule go over.
The bill was then considered from the
point reached yesterday, paragraph 100.
An agreement was reached striking out
the provision that all fluted, rolled, ribbed
or rough piate-glass when ground or oth
erwise obscured shall be subject to the
same rate of duty as finished cast polished
plate-â¢iass unsilvered.
On the paragraph as to unsilvered cast
polished plate glass, small size, Jones of
Arkansas moved to reduce the rate from
8 cents a square foot. Jones declared the
increase of the duty on all classes of plate
glass was astounding. In one case the rate
was increased 83 per cent above the high
rate of tne McKinley act, which, he as
serted, had been repudiated by the people
becau-e of its nich rates. This was an at
tempt to raise the price of mirrors used in
rhpÂ»p furniture for poor people, while the
large size glass used by people of wealth
had the rates reduced. This was a
peculiarity of the whole bill, as though
the senators in charge of it had in mind
the old proverb: "To him who hath
much shall be given, and from bim who
hath little shall be taken away even that
wbicti he has." Jones referred to the
enormous dividends declared in the last
three years.
Vest added that the entire plate-glass
trade, with a few trifline exceptions, was
controlled by a combine which met an
nually at Pittsburg, making rates, etc.
Jones presented a statement showing
that the plate-glass combination had made
profits of about $2,500,000 in twenty-two
months on a capital of $2,000,000.
Quay read a communication from the
Pittsburg Plate G:ass Company declaring
that any statements that it was in a trust
or combination in restraint of trade were
untrue.
After a lengthy debate Jones' motion to
reduce the rate on rough plate-glass from
8 to scents was defeated â yeas 2l, nays 29.
When the rejection of Jones' motion re
ducing the rate on rough plate-glass was
announced Quay asked the Senate's in
tention regarding the Decoration day ses
sion. He thought it should adjourn in
deference to the veterans.
Aldrich said he preferred a Monday ses
sion. He felt bound to press the bill
every available honr during every hour of
every day. Frye, Hale and Proctor spoke
for and Vest, Pettus and Morgan against
a session.
Morgan shifted into a lengthy criticism
of the House in the action. He gave the
titles of some important bills the Senate
had passed this session (126) and on which
no action could be taken by the House
under the existing arrangement. Under
any ordinary circumstances and con
templation of the founders of the Gov
ernment, he said, the House ought to be
in session to consider those bills and other
very important matters, but instead the
tariff bill has been put forward, ana sus
tained by all the Republicans and by some
Democrats as a solution of all the coun
try's difficulties. In order to compel the
Senate to pass it the House was held in
an unorganized condition and the consti
tution palpably violated. The course of
the House was not in compliance with the
question, and the matter caused a very
serious doubt whether one of the two
house* bad not abandoned its constitu
tional post and duty, whetner it had not
withdrawn itself from the session of Con
gress and thereby worked a dissolution of
the whole Congress. "The course of tne
House," he declared, "is a shocking out
rage on the Governmentjand the people of
the United States. It was the letting
down of Congres* in the estimation of the
people and the bringing of Congress into
de?ervert and sovereign contempt."
"Here," he said, "are hundreds of men
in Washington chewing the cud of reflec
tion and absolutely waiting on a word
from the lips of a single man to determine
whether they shall have a voic* in the
Government or whether in fact they shall
have any of the power of representatives
of their "States or districts. The patience
and patriotism of the American people a*
exhibited under these very peculiar dis
honoring and trying circumstances was
remarkable."
Hale made the point of order that Mor
gan violated a rule of parliamentary law
in criticizing a co-ordinate branch. The
presiding officer (Gallinger) sustained
Hale. A vote was then taken on Quay's
motion to adjourn over till Tuesday and
adopted by 34 ayes to 17 noes.

Lindsay Would Withdraw the Differ
ential Sugar :. Mate. ;
â WASHINGTON, D. 0., May 29.âSena
tor Lindsay of Kentucky, who was a mem
ber of the sugar investigating committee
in 1894, said to-day he would move to
strike from the tariff bill the provision
for a differencial rate to sugar refiners.
The Senator added:
"That is the only way to rid the Senate
of the scandal which periodically appears.
I doubt if the differential rate can be
stricken off, however, for I believe there
is sufficient influence in the Senate to
hold up the tariff unless the differential is
allowed. I know it was the case when
the Democratic bill was pending. In my
opnion nothing would be gained by an
other investigation. The same limitations
will exist and erabarrass the committee as
hampered the last. There is but one way
we can get at the bottom of this affair.
That is by voting down the sugar trust
differential."
Senator Jones of Nevada, chairman of
the committee which controls the contin
gent expenses of the Senate, to which was
referred the Tiilman resolution for an in
vestigation of the reports of speculation
in sugar stocks by Senators, said to-day
he thought the resolution would be favor
ably reported. He Etated, however, that
this was his individual opinion and not
the result of a conference with other mem
bers of the committee.
COLUMBIA, S. a, May 29.â Senator
McLaurin is on the way to Washington,
where he will take his seat Monday. He
said he opposed the tariff bill now before
the Senate because he was a Democrat.
If a protective tariff is going to be im
posed he wished his people, the cotton
and rice growers, to derive the same bene
fits the manufacturers did. He was for
Cuban liberty and favored helping the
patriots in their struggle. He is an
avowed silverite.
NO TRANSFERS OF TROOPS.
Too Much Need/ess Expense to the Gov
ernmentâ How the President
Keeps His Promises.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 29.â A rep
resentative of The Call was informed to
day in the office of the Secretary of War
that there would be no change whatever
in the stations of troops at present. The
Secretary has emphatically said two or
three times that the condition of tbe
treasury does not warrant any expendi
tures under this head except for the most
urgent reasons. A considerable sum was
necessarily spent in transporting troops to
Washington on March 4 and to New York
City to the Grant parade. While It was
advisable, it is presumed, to have the
army represented in both instances, the
feeling among many officers is that if the
amount of money expended on those
two occasions could have been applied to
much-needed transfers the army would
have been benefited to a greater dregree.
General Miles made a number of recom
mendations regarding the change of sta
tions of troops before his departure for
Europe, but just what they are cannot be
definitely stated.
In connection with the appointment
this week of Major-General Brooke, it is
learned from a reliable source that on the
occasion of that officer's recent visit to
Washington, which was about the time of
the appointment of Major-General For
syth, he had an interesting talk with
President McKinley. it seemed that Gen
eral Brooke called at the White House on
the invitation of the President. It also
appears that General Brooke was promised
his promotion upon the retirement of
Major-General Wheaton. This promise
was made by the President. The day that
General Brooke visited the White House
the .Fiesident recalled his promise and
said that his intention was to :uliil! it un
less General Brooke consented to its fur
ther postponement
Mr. McKinley stated, in a frank way,
that it was his particular desire to ap
point at once Generals Forsyth nnd Bliss.
He assigned what he regarded as good
reason for making these promotions, but
informed General Brooke that in view of
hit promise he would not do so should the
general offer objection. Very naturally
General Broose desired his promotion,
but under the circumstances he said to
the President that he would not insist
upon the execution of the earlier promise.
Tnen the President stated that he would
send in the nominations of General For
syth and General Bliss, and that imme
diately after their confirmation he would
send to the Senate the nomination of
General Brooke. This promise has been
kept.
Secretary Long has admonished certain
members of the board of inspection and
other naval officers who attenued the trial
of tne lowa that, it is improper to accept
hospitalities from ship contractors. It
appears that alt line officers on the lowa's
trip paid their own expenses, but that,
following custom, a number of the staff
officers did not. A few aays ago Assistant
Secretary Roosevelt sent inquiries to all
members of the trial board asking for in
formation on this point. The replies were
as indicated. No official explanation has
been given out as to what prompted Mr.
Roosevelt's question. All the replies were
laid before Secretary Lone, who ordered
letters of admonition to be drafted. As it
has been usual for shipbuilders to pay the
living expenses of officors on thp trial of
vessels the observance of the rule in the
lowa case is nothing extraordinary. No
contractor has ever presented a bill to the
Government on this score, and if they
generously entertain officers at their own
expense the Government loses nothing.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
JOHN D. DALY TO
GET THE PRIZE
It Now Seems Certain
He Will Preside at
the Postoffice.
Other San Franciscans Are
Beaten in the Race for
the Place.
John T. Dare Will Be Appointed an
Appraiser, Instead of Post
master.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 29.âCon
gressman Loud has decided to recommend
John D. Daly as postmaster of San Fran
cisco to succeed McCoppin. Mr. Daly is
well known in San Francisco, having fig
ured somewhat in politics. It will be re
membered that he was a candidate for
Assessor six or seven years ago and was
defeated for the office by Mr. Siebe. Daly
conducted a milk business for many years
and is said to have acquired some wealth
in that business. He resides in the Mis
sion.
Representative Loud was eeen by
a Call correspondent to-night and
positively declined to affirm or deny
the truth of the report that he
had decided to recommend Daly. Never
theless The Call correspondent's in
formation is positive and reliable. Loud
called on the President to-day to urge that
General Romualdo Facheco be appointed
to the Argentine Republic mission, but
while at the White House took occasion
to speak to the President about the post
mastership.
President McKinley is ready to appoint
McCoppin's successor in a few days. It is
the custom for the Republican Congress
man to name the Postmasters in his own
district, especiaily in his own city, and
Senator Parkins, who Is disposed to be as
liberal as possible, has already said that
he will not make any objections to any
good man who may be named by Loud.
John D. Spreckels, as stated in last
night's dispatches, is in favor of John T.
Dare for the postmastership, and as he
and Loud are entirely friendly and har
monious it may be that Mr. Spreckels'
wish will be gratified, as President Mc-
Kinley, as well as both Senator Perkins
and Representative Loua, realize that
Mr. Spreckels, as National Committee
man, is entitled to equal recognition. It
is certain therefore that if Dare is not ap
pointed postmaster he will be made ap
praiser.
It is expected that Perkins, Loud and
Spreckels will have a conference to-mor
row or Monday. It is certain the Post
mastership lies between Daly and Dare.
Messrs. Backus, Dodge, McKinley, Bas
sett and Stetson are not in it.
Representative Loud has received some
communications from McCoppin's bonds
men urging that the appointment be made
as soon as possible. One of the bondsmen
is ex-Senator Felton. Meanwhile Deputy
.Postmaster Doyle is conducting the office.
ANGELL STILL HAS A CHANCE.
The Slate Department Trying to Remove
the Objections of Turkey to the
New Minister.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 29.â The
State Department is trying to remove
Turkey's objections to receiving Dr. An
gell of Michigan as Minister of tne United
States. With proverbial reticence the de
partment has declined to make any state
ment about the attitude of the Porte.
YOLO'S PIONEER SETTLER.
Career of the Late John R. Woifskill, the Founder of Winters.
WINTERS, Cal., May 29.â John R. Wolfskin, the pioneer settler of Yolo County, who died
early yesterday morning at the age of 93, was born in Kentucky in 1804. He arpronauted Â»o
California in 1838. Here his brother, William Wolfsklll, had a Mexican grant of 40,000 acres
of land on part of which the city of Los Angeles now stands.
In 1841 the Mexican Government gave to John R. Woifskill 14,000 acres of land known as
the Rancho de> Los Putos, lying on each side of Putati creek, in Solano and Yolo counties. He
immediately moved to this tract and founded the American settlement in this part of the
State. For fifty-six years he has been a central fl?ure in this region. Of great strength of
character, indomitable will and firm integrity, he was during the early days of California a
leader of men and a strong factor in the settlement of the country. Up to a few hours of his
death his mind wig clear and vigorous^nd was storod with early reminiscences of a busy life.
As people csme to this part of the State to find homes, Mr. Woifskill gradually sold his
lands, and, unlike many grant- holders, was never a bar to the development of the country.
Some ten years ego he deeded to each of his four children 1244 acres. The town of Winters
and some two hundred other homes now occupy portions of the famous Woifskill grant A
widow and four children survive him. The latter are Edward Woifskill, Mrs. Samuel Taylor,
Mrs. T. J. Bonny and Mrs. C. C. Councilman, all prominent la affairs of this region.
Some officials have gone even bo far as
to deny that there is anything to prevent
the cordial reception of Angell at Con
stantinople, but their denial is merely
technical, hinging on the difference be
tween the words "formal" and "unoffi
cial," as applied in the Turkish repre
sentations.
At the Turkish legation less equivocal
explanations were given. It was said
there that the State Department had been
asked if certain statements attributed to
Angell were true. What these statements
are cannot be definitely ascertained
further than that they are said to have
been contained in a newspaper inerview
with Angell and in a speech delivered by
him. Other things relating to Angell
with which the Porte is dissatisfied con
cern his reported connection with
religious organizations that have freely
criticize! the attitude of the Turkish
Government regarding Armenia and the
massacres of Christians.
There is a conflict in [the information
obtainable as to the manner in which the
Porte's inquiry was brought to the atten
tion of this Government. What appears
to be the most reliable explanation is that
Terrell cabled tfaat the Porte was contem
plating refusal to receive Angell, but be
iore taking action had started an inquiry
to ascertain whether he was correctly
quoted. Angell came to Washington this
week and told Secretary Sherman just
what he had said and meant in the inter
view. Tnis explanation was given the
Turkish Minister here for transmission to
the Minister of Foreign Affairs at Con
stantinople.
The State Department professes to be
lieve that Anpeli will be persona grata to
the Porte.but the Turkish legation qualifies
with the word "probable" its statement
that Angeli will be acceptable to the
Sultan.

BROOKLIX MAMOICAP JEXTBIEB.
The rich Brooklyn handicap over a mile and
a quarter, one ot the severest tests ol speed
and endurance to which a thoroughbred can
be put, will be decided in the far East to-mor
row, the opening day at the Brooklyn race
track. The probabie winner is speculated
on months before the race comes to an issue,
ana interest in the big event is general through
out the country. The probable starters, with
the weights assigned by the handicapper aud
the jockeys who will ride are: HandsDring
125 (Sims). Harry Reed 114 (Taral). Ben
Eder 113 (Thorpe), Belmar 121 (T. Sloan),
The Winner 115 (H. Martin), Lake Snore 105,
Sly Fox 110, Loki 108 (J. Hill), Free Advice
108 (Scherer), Merry i'rince 100, King Arthur
Jl 98, Sir Waiter 115 (Doggett). Volley 95 and
Jetton on 83.
Requital was to have been a starter, and the
frlenoa of the son of imp. Eothen were legion,
but his recent poor showing with Handspring
probably caused his withdrawal. The two
carrying the colors of George E. Sinitn (Pitts
burg Phil), Belmar and The Winner, are nicely
located at the weights, and will he heavily
supported. Dr. McLean has sent his slashing
big colt Loki on from the West, and the South
ern contingent will presumably string its coin
his way. He has been traveling great guns in
private, and with J. Hill in the saddle, may
furnish the Easteners a surprise. Haudspiing
though, the slashing bis; son of Hanover, has
been getting ovor the ground in a way to
tickle the fancy of Trainer McCabe, and the
horse that beats him will probably carry away
the prize.
Slaughter continues his winning lick In the
saddle at St. Louis, scarcely a day passtng that
he does not get two or three mounts past the
finishing post in front.
During the three weeks' period of racing at
Morris Park, David Gideon headed the list ot
winning owners, withoversl3,ooo to his credit.
James R. Keene was tounh on the list with
$4395 and Marcus Daly tilth, his horses plac
ing $4392 to the Montana turfman's credit.
Crawley Thorpe is evidently not in the best
of standing in the far East. An Eastern report
says that one day la-t week ho gave a ghastly
exhibition astride Storm Queen, and it is un
derstood from high authority that the first
bad break the young man indulges in will re
sult in a rigid dose of discipline.
Humbug, a recent winner at .Louisville,
owned by J. E. Madden, is said to be more
than a useful selling plater.

SCHOOL WINS
Victor in the Sonoma-
Mendocino League
Field Day.
Spirited Athletic Contests De
cided on Santa Rosa's
Racetrack.
Uklah's Athletes Capture Second
Place From Those of Santa
Rosa.
SANTA ROFA, Cal., May 29. -The j
athletic field day of the Sonoma-Mendo
cino Athletic League took place to-day at
the racetrack. The lour high pchools of
Sonoma and Mendocino counties â those
of Healdsburg, Petaluma, Santa Roiaand
Ukiah â had representatives in tne strug
gle for athletic supremacy. After a stub
born contest the Petaluma High School
came out victorious, with 62 points to its
credit, as against 44}^ points for Ukiah,
I*} 4 for Banta Rosa and 1 for Healdsburg.
The victorious Petalumans received an
elegant silver cup.
An excursion train from Ukiah arrived
in the morning, bedecked in the purple
and gold of the Ukiah High School.
Throngs of Petaluma sympathizers with
ribbons of purple and white and Hcalds- ;
burg partisans decorated with lavender i
and white were welcomed by the local !
high school representatives, who were I
everywhere in evidence with their orange !
and black decorations.
Between 2000 and 3000 spectators crowded
the grandstand and grounds at the race
track. The day was almost perfect for an
athletic meet, and the tracK was in the
Lest of condition. Long b?fore 1:30
o'clock, when the games were called, the
grounds presented an animated appear
ance, a; the supporters of the several
teams vented their enthusiasm in cheer
ing and tooting tin horns. Intense rival
ry was the order, and each team seemed
to be couiident of victory. AJ L2an, who
had been training the athletes of the
Ukiah High School, and Everett Brown,
captain of the University of California
team, who had been coaching the Peta
luma boys, were among the most intei
ested and anxious spectators.
From an athletic standpoint, the nald
day was a grand success. The showing
made by the athletes, handicapped ai they
were by having a horse track to run over,
was creditable indeed, and indicated that
there was any amount of athletic talent
in the league. Tne finish of the 100-yard
dash, in which Putnam, Henley and
Cramer ran a dead heat, was one of the
most exciting incidents of the day's sport.
The managers of the competing teams
were: E. A. Strout, manager of the Santa
Kosa team and of the Sonoma-Mendocino
L ague; L. McClish of the Healdsbnrg
team, Tom McGuire of the Petaluma team

' areer of " Salvation " Donnelly, the
Mated of Tombstone.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 29.âAn
other bad man with a record in Los An
geles is "Salvation" Donnelly, the leader
of a religions sect in ibe Huachaca Moun
tains, Arizona, who was convicted at
Scenes at the Sonoma-Mendocino Field Day at Santa RosaÂ»
Tombstone on the charge of inhuman
cruelty to children. Five years ago Don
nelly was well known in Los Angeles. For
a short time he worked with the Salva
tion Army, but soon branched out as an
independent leligious teacher. In some
way he learned of a promising silver mine
in Arizona which had been deserted years
before. He found the mine, worked it
and is now rich. He returned to this city
four years ago and married Alvina Reich
ert, whose father was a carpenter at Boyd
and Wall streets.
Donnelly established a small city on the
proceeds of his mine, the disciples of the
camp working on the communistic prin
ciple.
Suicide at Pitaluma.
PETALUMA, Cal.. May 29â A poor,
discouraged old man was found dead this
morning in the little hut he occupied in
this city. He ha i been making a half
starved sort of a living for some time
doing odd jobs and evidently decided to
end the struggle for existence by killing
himself. He had been known a-t "Jack"
Ahlmann, bat it has since been learned
that his real name was Jacob Ehlemann.
The suicide had almost severed his head
from his body with a knife. After gash
ing himself in this manner he had hanged
himself with a bale rope fastened to a pro
jecting corner. Ehlemann was German
by birth and about 60 v-ears old.
Truekee Murderer ' onrieted.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., May 29.â Months
ago Giacomo Arrighini, a young Italian
ol Truckee, shot his brother Dominici,
four years his senior, and killed him.
There was strong talk of lynching him
before he was lodeed in the county jail.
Since Tuesday he has been on trial for
murder, and to-night the jury found him
guilty of manslaughter. His delense was
that he had been taking excessive doses of
quinino and became demented, so that
when he saw his brother approaching in
the moonlight he imagined him to be a
robber, and fired three bullets iuto him.

PARKER AGAIN IN
PRESCOTT'S JAIL
Ironed Hand and Foot
He Enters His Old
Cell.
Intended Lynching Prevented
by a Strategy of His
Captors.
Leave Their Train Two Miles From
Town and Reach the Prison
In a Carriage.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., May 29.â 1t will be
three weeks to-morrow since Train-robber
Parker left the Prescott ]ail over the dead
body of young La.c Norris. To-night the
desperado, alone with Forger Miller, was
brought back to his old cell, this time se
curely ironed nand and foot, and with no
possibility of bis escaping again.
Sheriffs Rnffner of Yavapai and Cam
eron of Coconino counties Drought the
prisoners from Flagstaff and landed them
in jail here secretly and securely. The
train was stopped two miles out of town,
where the party was met by Ruffner's
brothers with a closed carriage. Thus a
great crowd at the station was disap
pointed and, possibly, mob violence pre
vented.
There was ample /ear of the latter, for
threats of lynching had been openly made.
To-night Sheriff George RnfTner is a hap
pier man than he has been for three weeks
previous, as he has successfully concluded
a most fatiguing series of travels after the
worst desperado alive in Arizona.
A great crowd bid Parker good-by at
Flagstaff and many expressions of admi
ration for his wonderful nerve, and even
sympathy for his present predicament,
were expressed. Parker said to-day that
he regretted killing Lee Norrls.
"I had nothine against him," he said;
"only I was rattled and was afraid he
would wine me from the tower. How*
ever, what's done is done."
Parker was in fine humor and, on the
train from Flagstaff, talked a good deal
about his recent exploits. He said he
had been three nights without sleep, or
Preston and his Navajos would never
have caught him napping. Unless RuiT
nor and Cameron bad arrived just, as they
did he would have killed a few of the In
dians easily and escaped a.'am. He had
his plans laid and was only waiting until
his horse had been watered and fed.
United States Attorney Eilinwood
claimed Parker as a Federal prisoner yes
terday at Flagstaff, but Ruffner emphat
ically declined to turn him over, and af ler
some sharp words Eilinwood left the city.
At 'Whipple, a short distance out of
town, seventy-five determined armed men
were assembled, expecting that Parker
would be taken off the train there.
They were disappointed, but have vowed
to have their way yet During the ride
through town the crowd at dome places
surrounded the vehicles in which were the
prisoners. Miller in great terror cried
out:
"Oh, my God, here they come; I knew
they would do it."
"Shut up, you â fool!" roared Parker,
and he gave Miller a kick with his man
acled foot. Then he waved his hat at the
cro'vd and called out:
"How do you do, boys? We're just
riding about to get the air."
Extraordinary precautions had been
taken against mob violence at every point,
and Ruffner is happy to-night in success
fully landing his man. Jim Parker's dar
ing and sang froid are the talK of the city.
STOCKTON'S BOLD HIGH WAY 111 AM.
Insurance Agent Paynter of Sacramento
the Latest Victim of the
Robber.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 29.â Stockton's
lone highwayman comes out as regularly
now as the stars. Last night he held a
man up under the shadow ot the Baptist
church and got about $14, but through a
bit of carelessness be failed to cover the
lower part ot his chin with the mask that
he wore, and a scar was noticed extending
from the corner of the moutti down. That
will give the officers a tangible clew to the
robber.
The victim last night was R. L. Payn
ter, an insurance agent from Sacramento.
He had been visiting a friend in the north
ern part of the city and was on his way
home. It was about 11 o'clock, when hÂ«
was walking leisurely along in iront of the
Baptist church. He felt a hand gently
on his shoulder, and as he turned around
a man in the shadow asked him what time
It was. The agent answered that he did
not have his watch with him, thinking
nothing further about the matter and
starting to walk on. The highwayman
then asked for money, and without delay
proceeded to search the insurance man's
pocket?, taking all he had. The officers
were out all night searching for the rob
ber, bat without success.
TO PLEAD FOR WORDEN.
American Railway Union Committee Will
Be Heard by Governor Budd
To- Day.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 29.âTo
morrow morning at 10 o'clock a com
mi ttee from the American Railway Union,
headed by Harry A. Knox and George G.
Cros?ley, will be accorded an interview
by Governor Budd on behalf of Salter D.
Worden, the condemned train-wrecker,
who is under sentence to be hanged at
Folsom x>rison on June 4. The committee
claims that it is prepared to produce six
affidavits from persons who were called
upon the day after the wreck at Two-
Mile trestle, and who were asked by cer
tain persons for money to enable them to
get out of the country, and that Worden
was not one of the persons; also that
they could produce a confession of the
guilty persons.
This morning the Governor received a
telegram ffom Crossley asking him when
he would meet the committee from the
American Railway Union. The Governor
immediately pent back the word:
"In my office at Bacramento at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning. Shall de
termine action within twenty-four hours
thereafter. Further delay impossible."

Terry of the Friend & Terry Lumber Com
pany has purchased from person* holding
under a trust deed the entire plant and
property of the Shasta Lumber Company,

ENTITLED TO VOTE
Enfranchised by an Act |
of the Last Legis
lature.
"Joker" Contained in a Bill
Passed During the Closing
Hours.
Grants Them the Privilege of Cast
ing Ballots In Municipal
Elections.
PHCENIX, Ariz., May 29.â The discoT
ery has just been made by a Tucson law
yer that the last Legislature passed what
now appears to be a virtual equal suffrage
law ; ai least, in so far as it relates to city
elections. (Suffrage bills were introduced
in both branches of the Legislature, but
after much catory both of them were
killed by overwhelming majorities. Dar
ing the excitement which attended the
closing days of the Legislature General
O'Neil, the Mayor of Prescott, secured the
passage aad the gubernatorial approval of
a lengthy measure regulating municipal
affairs in incorporated cities. One of the
sections of this bill reads:
At any city election every taxpayer is enti
tled to vote, without distinction of sex. But
nothing herein ahull be construed as abridg
ing the right ol an elective franchise possessed
by any person.
The women of the Equal Suffrage Club
of Phoenix are very much disappointed
because they did not know of the new law
in time to improve their opportunity at
the spring election, but now that the se
cret is out the suffragists of the entire
Territory will combine for the purpose of
demanding their legal rights at the polls
in all future city elections.

HIS OWN DOCTOR
You will meet a man every
now and again who Is his
own doctor. He will buy
shoes from shoemakers, meat
from butchers and soap from
chandlers, but he must be
his own doctor. He tinkers
with himself, uses every
kind of tea or herb he can
find. This being yourown

motherly woman of a big
family, whose experience,
actual contact â is great â
but the ordinary man can no
more be his own doctor than
can a goat read Latin, or a
mule study Greek. A man
who finds he Is suffering

T;ere is considerable rivalry between the

CONSUL-GcNEHAL TO JAPAN.
Said on Good Authority Tat John F.
Bimcf of Olympia, Wash., Will
Surt-iy He Appointed.
TACOMA, Wash., May 29.â 1t has been
rumored here for several days that John
F. Gowej, vice-president of the recently
suspended First National Bank of
Oivmpia, is certain of securing the ap
pointment as Consul-General to Japan, !
and that his name wi i be sent io the Sen- |
ate early next week.
Gowey came from Ohio, where he was j
prominent in the politics of that State,
along with McKinley, Grosvenor and
Hanna. He has been training for the i
place since the election. It is out !
by friends of Mr. Gowey that private in- >
formation has been received fr m a thor
oughly reliable source mat the President
will appoint him.
Much interest is taken here in the mat
ter because City Treasurer William A.
biernberg is also a candidate and an ex
ceptionally long list of indorsements have
been forwarded to Washington in iiis
behalf.
In the wint-r of 1891 Mr. Gowey was
named Consul-General to Japan by Presi
dent Harrison. He went to San Francisco
to transact business and take a steamer.
There matters transpired in his busi
ness affairs which caused him to return
and resign the appointment. State Rep
reseniative Willaru D. Tillotson was then
appointed. Since his return Tillotson uas
removed to California to practice law.
Mr. Gowey has long been prominent in
btate politics, and was insirumental in
having this State's delegation to the St.
Louis convention instructed for McKtuiey.
BIMXICAI* CATTLE TRADE.
J-'ortner Â£ecords for Heavy Shipment*
Jfrokin Jhit ear.
DEMINU, N. Mex., May 29.â At no pre
vious time has there been such activity in
the Mexican cattle trade as now. In the
first four months of the year 825 cars have
been loaded and shipped from theDeming
yards, containing a total of 33,000 head.
In March 10.000 head were shipped out of
Mexico at this point. For April the Mex
ican cattle shipments from here amounted
: to about 21,000 head.
From the State of Chihuahua the figures
are far greater. The increase' lias r>eÂ«n
tremendous. During April of 1896, 14,904
head of beef cattle were shipped from
Chihuahua to the United Slates, while
the April shipments for this year have
reached as high as 72,644. and this is 27 v OOO
in excess of the shipments for the preced
ing mouth.
Thousands of cattle south of the Mexi
can border line are still on their way to
United States markets. The prospective
duty on imported cattle is largely re-Don
sible lor this condition of affairs. Mexi
can cattle-owners have felt that it was
now or never. â

NEVADA CITY'S SENSATION.
The Mystery Surrounding Mrs. G hr.g's
Tragic Death Still Unsolvedâ Result
of 'he Coroner's Inques .
NEVADA CITY, Cal., May 29.â After
examining some fifteen witnesses to-nigbt
the Coroner's jury, impaneled to inquire
into the circumstances of the death of
Mrs. George (jehrig, whose bloody corpse
was found hanging at daylight yesterday
in the rear of the National Exchange
Hotel, adjourned tiil next Tuesday even
ing without having come to tne conclusion
whether she killed herself or was assassi
nated.
According to Dr. L. C. Miller, who per
formed an autopsy this afternoon, the
woman was not first murdered and then
strung up to divert suspicion from tne
I criminal. Dr. Mulier says that the
wounds on the head were not serious and
mignt have been received in falling and
striking on a japsed rock or stick. He
further declares that she died of strangu
lation. .
The evidence as given to-night is mostly
but a repetition of the story already given
in The Call, with a few sensational addi
i tions here and there. Both Gebng and
I his old' st son were on the etand to-night
i and told straight tale<Â«. They said tftat
i tne wife and mother had frequently given
signs during the last few years of losing
tier rea-on, becoming violent and uncon
trollable at times. . . _.
The boy admitted that she drank freely
I of beer, and thought that this habit might
have had a tendency to aggravate her un
fortunate condition at times. All ol last
Wednesday she had stayed in her room at
borne refusing to admit any of the family.
That ni"ht sue had in spite of tneir plead-
ings and commands left home, saying she
was going to a hotel for the night an 1
would next day pay a visit to her sister, a
few miles out of town.
Next day Gehrig sent one of his little
bu\ s around io the hotel* to inquire for
h-r, but the eh Id could find no trace of
he-. She had re -istered by her maiden
! name of Frances Zmler. So the family
! concluded she had gone iuto the country
j and gave up the searcn. The next time
they saw her was when they found her
lifeless body at the City Hall.
William Carr, a n:gut watchman, testi
fied that from his investigations, made
I just alter the finding of the body, he is
j satisfied that Mrs. Gehrig could not have
hanged herself.
Ed Wi.liams, a clerk in the express
| office, said he had looked over the wood
j Â«hed where the body was found before the
' crowd got there and tramped around ami
j he saw what appeared to be the marks of
I the two feet of a body that had been
j dragged from a point where there was a
j po 1 oi biood toward the spot where the
body was hangine.
Sheriff Getcheil said that he had visited
the home of the Gehrigs on Sacramento
I street, searched the premises thoroughly
and questioned Gehrig closely. He found
that the latter had gone to bed at 6 o'clock
the night of the killing and stayed there
till 6 o'clock the next morning. He was
satisfied that it a murder had been com
mitted the huband had no hand in it.
One witness c aimed that about 11
I o'clock Thursday night he saw a man and
i woman passing along Pine street toward
' the woodsbea, bui he did not watch to see
i whether they entered it. He was not
! abl* to give any de-enption of the couple.
The interest of the peonle here in toe
caÂ«>e continues to increase hourly.
F-jr three hours to-night hundreds of
! people fought and struggled to get into
> the stuffy little room where the inquest
was in progress. At 11 o clock one of the
local evening papers got out an extra,
giving a detailed account of the testi
mony, and at midnight the streets are
thronged with people discussing the inys
| tery, which deepens with each new de
velopment.
REUNITED IN PORTLAND.
Husband Reconciled to the Wife Who
Had Lett H s Siskiyou County
Home,
PORTLAND, Ore., May 29.â This morn
ing's train from the sout i brought to
Portland A. Brady, a hotel-keeper of Scotts
Bar, Eiskiyou County, Cal. Mrs. Orpha
Brady was intercepted by Detective Welsh
yesterday morning on an unknown charge
and detained upon the supposition that an
officer from Siskiyou County would come
to-day and explain the situation. To the
surprise of the heads of the police depart
ment, Brady was not accompanied by an
officer of the county in which he lives, but
by Hon. E. H. Autenrieth, a lawyer of
Northern California. The latter gentle
man was not disposed to say much with
reference to his mission, beyond that
Brady desired the custody of the eldest
two children now with their mother, *tnd
that he was willing she should retain the
younger.
The fact is that Mrs. Brady, her children
and the woman's companion, "Bob" Me-
Caully, were held here without any pro
cess of law.
Mrs. Brady denies all charges of Infidel
ity, and says that her Husband drove her
from home last Sunday, giving her only
$100 wherewith to provide for herself and
children.
It was Brady's lawyer's intention to
wrest two of the children from the mother

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
WOLFE TONE TO
BE HONORED
Celtic Union to Celebrate
the Patriot's Birth
day.
He Was the Father of the Irish
Revolutionary Movement
oi 1798
Irishmen All the World Over Will
Do Honor to One of Their
N bust Heroes.
The one hundred and thirty-fourth an
niversary of the birthday of Theobald
Wolfe Tone, the father of the Irish revo
lutionary movement of 1798, which will
occur on June 20, will be celebrated in a
patriotic way in Ireland and wherever
else Irishmen have made their home.
Wolfe Tone is one of the most interest
ing characters in Irish history. The story
of his life as told by himself is a narrative
full of adventure. He must have pos
sessed the gayety of manners that usually
belongs to the gallant soldier. In many
ways he reminds the reader of one of
Dumas' heroes. The story of his life was
written for his wife, but it was given to
the worll by hts son as an invaluable con
tribution to the history of Ireland. Tone
was practically the founder of the Irish
separatist movement. He did not believe
in mere legislative independence. To
build up a free Irish Btate was the object
of Ms life.
He sougnt colleagues and comrade? in
Belfast, the capital of Ulster, then the
hotbed of treason, and he found them. A
Protestant himself, be brought Catholic
and Protestant together and impressed
upon all who came under the sphere of
his influence the necessity of united ac
tion again t the common enemy. There
was to be but one creed â Irish nationality
âand one classâ rebels against the British
rule.
The Society of United Irishmen was
founded in Belfast and soon made recruits
in I.ein.-ter, M under and Connaught.
Among the most interesting pans of his
story are his recitals as to the state of
Ulster toward the end of the eighteenth
century. The Prote-tants were ripe for
rebellion, and we can understand, there
fore, why the Protestant Irish in the
colonies as well as tne Catholic Irish gave
Washington such a cordial support. Tone
kept on the high road to rebellion all the
time and he strengthened the waverers.
He was obliged at length to leave Ireland
and he sought the t'nited States, and the
voyage across was full of adventure, in
that the vessel had to run the gauntlet of
English cruisers.
In the Unitea States he planned anew,
and finally sailed for France to persuade
the Directory to dispatch a fleet and army
to Ireland to help the, United Irishmen in
overthrowing the Government of Eng
land.
His success with the Directory won the
admiration or Wellington.
"Wolfe Tone," says the Duke, "was a
most extraordinary man, and his history
is the most curious history of those times
With 100 guineas in his pocket, unknown
and uniecommended, he went to Paris in
order to overthrow the British Govern
ment in Ireland. He asked (or a large
force, Lord Edward Fitzgerald for a small
one. They listened to Tone, and the
Bantry Bay expedition was the result."
Tone returned with the Bantry Bay ex-
Dediiion. But the elements fought for
England and the French fleet was scat
tered by the winds.
Tone did not despair. He persuaded
the Directory to send another and yet an
other expedition. Both failed. A fourth
and last sailed from Brest in September,
1798. It consisted of a fleet of one sail of the
lineâ the Hoche, seventy-four gunsâ eight
frigates and one schooner, under command
of Admiral Bumpard, and an army of
30' JO men under General Hardy. Tone
was on board the admiral's Â«hip, the
Hoche. On October 10 Bompard arrived
off the entrance of Loujjn Swilly and was
signaled from the shore. At daybreak
next morning a British squadron, consist
ing of six sail of the line, one razee (sixty
gun*) and two frigates, under command
of Sir John Warren, hove in Â»i.Â»ht.
Bompard signaled the Frencn frigates
and the schooner to retreat and e'eared
the deck for action. A boat from one of
the French vessels came alongside the
Hoche for port orders. The French offi
cers gathered around Tone and urged him
to escape.
"Tne combat is hopeless," they said,
"we shall be i>ri<-oners of war, but what
wiil become of you?"
He answered: "Shall it be said that I
fled when the French were fighting the
batiles of my country? No, I snail stand
by my ship."
The Britiih bore do wn on the Hoche,
surrounding the French sbir>, but Bom
psrd Difi ' d his colors to the mast and for
six houro .-i"od the combined fire of the
English shij.-.
Her mssts were dismantled, her riggine
was swept away, the scuppers flowed with
blood, the wounded filled the cockpit. At
length, with yawning ribs, with rive feet
of water in the bold, her rudder carried
away, her sails and cordage hanging in
â¢hreds, her batteries dismounted and ev
ery gun silenced, she struck. Tone com
manded a battery and fought like a lion.
The Hoche was towed into lvough Swilly
and the prisoners Uuded and marched to
Letterkenny. Tone was taken to Dublin
loaded with irons. The end soon came.
He was tried by court-martial and sen
tenced to be banged, He anKea to be shot
and was refused. A few days later Tone
was found dying in his cell,' and although
the jailers renoried it Â»s a case of suicide,
it has always been beiievea that he was
murdered.
In this City the celebration of Wolfe
Tone's birthday will be under the aus
pices of the Celtic Union. It has been
determined to hold this as an Irish na
tional holiday each year. It is felt that j
this rmie patriot and gallant soldier I
deserves this honor from his countrymen !
ior his brave services and for inaugurat- j
ing a movement that since '98 ha 3 given I
inspiration to Irishmen to continue on in
the struggle for freedom.
The Celtic Union embraces the different
Irish societies oi this City, and for a year
pa^t it has been agitating for an Irish hall
here, and the prospects are very promis
ing for the success of that movement.
The present celebration in fact has that I
object in view. As the ann versary faWs
on Sunday the celebration will be held
Monday evening, June 21, and at Metro
politan Temple. A very tine programme
is being prepared and the exercises will be
interesting. Hon. James D. Phelan will
preside, md the oration will be delivered
by Hon. J. J. Dwyer. The leading Irish
men of the City are taking steps to make |
the affair very successful, and it is ex- i
pected Metropolitan Temple will be packed
that evening.

ARE DEFECTIVE
EYES PREVALENT?
A Large Percentage of
Students Seem to Ec
Afflicted.
Oculists Claim, However, That
the Examinations Are Im
properly Made.
Â»
SÂ«y It Is Impossible lo Make Proper
Tests Without the Use of
Drugs-
After a few weeks of examination on the
pait of two physicians, over 1500 pupils of
the public school?, it is ?aid, have been
found to be afflicted with various affec
tions of the eyes.
'The excessive strain imposed upon the
immature nervous system," said Dr. F.
Cornwall last evening, "and through this
upon the eyes, caused by the great num
ber of months of study iv the year, to
gether with the forcing that conies
through the competitive system in our
public schools, induces such a prevalence
of eye failure, with other nervous com
plaints, as to awaken public interest.
"Naturally the medical man is consulted
and particularly the oculist, and he being
the only one with any knowledge of the
subject, all is left to him. This is as it
should bÂ«, but there are elements which
enter into the proposition and which bring
forth problems the solution of which is
desirable.
"A question arises which should be
passed upon, viz. : When an oculist is
selected in the ordinary way, what assur
ance have the public of his capacity or
honesty? Human selfishness is apt to ex
emplify itself in this as in all human af
fairs, and when there is a monopoly, with
no one possessed with knowledge with
which to criticize, as in this case, things
may not proceed as they should.
"An establishei oculist, has neither
time nor inclination to perform this
gratuitous work. A new and presumably
inexperienced man who might wisii to
bring himself before the public agitates
the matter through a political friend and,
influence being brought to bear in the
right direction, he gets the place. Se
lected in this way the oculist may be
either honest, dishonest, capable or in
capable. He has a great amount of work
to do, for which he is to receive no salary
or compensation other than being
brought within the scope of public view.
He may have, however, a percentage with
the sppctacle-man who supplies the chil
dren with their glasses, and in tins way
make $40 or $50 a day.
"To an ordinary observer this may seem
all right, even tne percentage part, but
when a full understanding is had it may
seem to be all wrong and of rio use what
ever.
"I wish to impart this knowledge so that
the non-rrofessional reader may under
stand. The basis of my statements are
ray own case books ancl that of other?.
Furthermore all unbiased oculists will, in
my opinion, coincide.
"What is called the accommodative
function of the eye is composed of its lens
and a muscle which surrounds it, called
the ciliary muscle. By the action of this
muscle trie lens can be changed in its
curvature. This adapts the eye for the
observation ot objects at different dis
tances, and the decline of which is shown
by the fact that we require the assistance
of glasses as we grow older.
"In normal eyes this muscle acts on all
the meridians of the Jens alike, but if a me
chanical defect of any kind ex:st this mus
cle may curve the lens in one meridian
more than another. A lens whose curva
ture is perfectly spherical may be ren
dered unequal (spherico cylindrical), or
the reverse may bs the case. Eyes, like
all individual things in creation, are sel
dom perfect, and only exist in ideals.
This ideal eye is one that focuses light
rays, emanating from distant objects, on
its retina.
"Sometimes the imperfection consists in
foresight (hyperopia), a condition in
which the eyebalf is too short from front
to back for the focal lenctn. of its cornea
and lens. Another defect is ftearsight
<m\opia), a condition in which the eyeball
is too long from front to back for the focus
of the lens and cornea. The focus falls in
front of the part of the pye which per
ceives the light (the retina). A third de
fect is a condition in which the lens or
cornea or both are unequal in the curva
ture of their meridians, which is called
astigmatism.
"It would be impossible to construct
an artificial eye with which to illustrate
the physiological adaptation of the
natural eye or tojÃhow how muscular parts
of the inside of the eye control the curva
ture of tne lens, which changes its focal
distance and thus adapts the eye for sight
at the near as well as for the far point.
The far-sighted young overcome their de
fects (keep the focus of paialiei rays upon
the retina) by bringing into action the
functions used in the correct eye, for
seeing at the near point. Thus the lens is
kept continually, with an extra curve suf
ficient to overcome the defect. This is ac
companied by muscular contraction, and,
of necessity, beine constant, uses up nerve
force to maintain it. This becomes a real
spasm ot the muscle, which does not re
lax in many cases, perhaps even in sleep.
Thus reflex disturbance of the whole ner
vous system may ensue, which brines on
continual headache, chores, epilepsy, etc.
This spasm of the muscie of accommoda
tion often becomes- so great that not only
the farsight is corrected, but the eye will
actually become nearsighted.
"When an attempt ia made to measure
farsight with. lenses they will be rejected,
as at best only a part of it will be revealed.
The nearsighted young frequently accept
glasses three times as strong as the real
refraction of the eye. This is done by
spasm. The same may be said of astig
matism.
"Attempts to correct the mechanical
defect and to get a more perfect outline of
observed objects put the nerves controlling
these functions into an irritable state and
when lenses are placed before the eye for
tnese tests almost any result may be ex
pected so far as a proper diagnosis is con
cerned.
"Many persons with nearsieht, farsight
or astigmatism, or a combination oi'theÂ«e,
may be examined every day in the week
and give a different result at each trial.
Taen of what use is an examination of
this kind, conducted as it usually is in
our public schools? It merely establishes
the probability of a defect in the pupil's
eye and approximates its kind. The
uncertainty lies in this, ihat a farsighted
eye may measure near.-if;hted aud an as
tigmatic eye may overcome the defect and
not be shown durins examination, or there
may appear to be astigmatism when the
eye is in good condition.
"The only reliable method cf making a
diagnosis of an error of refrac';on is to
instill into the eye a drug that will tempo
rarily paralyze the muscle of Â«c:ommoda
tion. This does no harm, but rests the
eye and prevents the muscles from accom
modating the eyes to any glass but the
right one. An optician may by repeated
fitting approximate correctness, but tnis
is done over a period uf months or years,
their only guide being that which gives
the most relief. Those who examined the
school children have but the one test, and
that js conducted in from three to five
minutes.
"Modern optbalmology has taught us
that affections arising from inharmonious
action of the muscles that move the eye
bail are almost as frequent as those that
came from the error of refraction. Some
times the place of rest of an eye is not
with its fellow, viz.: their visual axes
are kept on a common point of fixation
with difficulty. The eyes may have a
tendency to divergence or convergence, or
one may have a tendency above its fellow.
"The distress from the iorce required to
keep the two eyes directed townrd the
same object is often severe. A great deal
of care and a number of examinations are
r< quired to properly diagnose and treat
these ocular defects.
"It is possibly unnecessary to speak of
the reflex disturbancss of the system that
may and so often do arise from these
ocular deiects, as almost all are in some
way larailiur with them.
"Each advance in civilization imposes
new burdens on our eyes and perhaps
more than any other element character
izing our changing condition?, the City
schools are most to blame for eye failure
and the functional distresses that go with
them. It behooves those who occupy
places of trust in this line to inform them
selves carefully that they may be able to
avoid comuiittinc error as well as to at
tempt to do cood. It lias always been mv
belief that the diagnosis of these mechani
cal ocular defects requires greater care,
especially amo;ic school children, than the
general public is aware of."

The June issue of the Sentinel, the official
organ of the Supreme Lodge, pays an eloquent
tribute to C. H. Bremer, the lately deceased
grand secretary of the Foresters ot America.
The discussion of the advisablity of estab

will command the serious attention of the
next session of the Supreme Lodge, which
convenes at Detroit in Sentember.
Supreme Protector L. B. Lockard Is one of
the most popular and active of all chief execu

stabie William Treanor had an exciting
experience at Point San Pedro to-day
while arresting a Chinaman for selling
liquor without a license. Treanor went
to the point and asked for a couple of
bottles of beer at the place of Ah Tai.
The beer was paid for and the constable
went bahind the counter and placed the
handcuffs on the Chinamen. When he at
tempted to take his prisoner along a
hundred Chinamen who are engaged in
shrimp fishing at the point rushed for

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
TO PUGET SOUND
NOW FOR $5
And Only $2 50 Is Required
to Reach the Oregon
Metropolis.
The Southern Pac fie Rests Satis
fied With Its $10 and
$5 Kates.
How the Pacific Coast Steamers Were
Forced to Fightâ The Last Cut of
the 0- R and N. Company.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company yesterday made another cut in
ths steamer fare between this City and
Portland, reducing it from $6 cabin and
$3 second class to $5 and $2 50 respectively.
The Southern Pacific made no move to
meet the cut. In fact, its officials claimed
that they were satisfied with the relative
difference in schedule rates and would
rest on their arms. Tho Southern Pacific
rate is $10 and $5.
The railroad may change its mind early
this week and do some further cutting,
but nobody can teli. It's a good deal the
way the whim strikes. If the steamer
proposition blossoms out big and lots of
people go by the boats and seem to fight
shy of the cars the road will have it in for
the boats some more and do some cutting.
Otherwise, otherwise.
The rates by both lines are as low now
as they have ever been. In fact they are
unprecedented, and there is nothing to
compare tuem with except the lone fight
that raged two years ago from November
to July 21. People by the steamers got
board and those by the cars got free
berths. It will be curious if a whole lot of
people do not go traveling. But the tide
has not started much yet, so the trans
portation people say. They agree, how
ever, that there h^ not been time enough
for the full force oi the fight to be felt by
the people. The steamer Columbia ar
rived last night from Portland with 110
passengers. She will sail again on
Wednesday.
"It's ail right as it is now," was the
statement from the Southern Pacific
office alluding to the latest cut of the
steamship company. "We can stand that ;
will just rest where we are. That differ
ence is all rignt, and we can probably
stand it as long as the other company
can. : '
The fijht took on a three-cornered
asp-ct early in t!ie day, for the Pacific
Coast SieamshiD Company was drawn
into it. To protect itself in the Puget
Sound business it had to drop its $15
first-class ra'e down to $10 and its $7 50
second down to $5.
"We had to do this," was the story
given by the Pacific Coast Company, "or
tel the other companies get the business.
Ihe local rate, for instance, from Port
land to Tacoma is |6 25. Add this to the
rate from here to Port. and by the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company and
you see where we get off. We couldn't
tand it. Our $10 and $5 rates now apply
o Victoria, Port Townstnd, New Whai
com, Everett, Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia,
and, you may say, every oi her place on
the sound."
KEEPERS Of LIGHIHOUSES.
Regulations of the Monotonous 1 ivpt
They Are Compelled to Lead.
A lighthouse-keeper is appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury on the recom
mendation of the Lighthouse Board, ana
at first receives only an acting appoint
ment. At the end of three months, if he
passes an examination by the Naval Offi
cer who is the inspector of the district, he
receives a full appointment; if he does
not pass he is dropped from the service.
A keeper must be able to read ami write,
keep accounts, bail and pull a boat, and
have enough mechanical ability to make
ihe necessary minor repairs about the
station and keep it in order.
There is only one grade of keeper rec
ognized by law, but the custom of the
service has divided the keepers into dif
ferent grades, with different pay and
duties, and with promotion from one
grade to another. A man may be ap
pointed to the service and assigned to a
part.cular station, but he may be moved
at any time if promoted, or if the inter
ests of the service demand it. At stations
requiring but one keeper, a retired aea
faring man, witti a family, is usualiy
selected, and, in general, men of the sea
faring class are most wanted. At stations
where there is a fog signal, one of the
assistants is a man who has an engineer's
license and is something of a machinist.
Keepers are paid on an average about
$800 a year, but the individual sums paid
vary from $100 to $1000 a year, according
to the importance of the station and the
amount of service rendered The princi
pal keeper at Minots Ledge Light, just
outside of Boston, receives $1000 a year for
his services, and this furnishes the only
instance where the pay of a keeper is
specified by law.
The keepers who live at isolated light
houses and on the off-shore lightships lead
a very monotonous life, broken oniy by
the siL'ht of passing vessels and the quar
terly visit of the lighthouse supply boat.
These keepers get considerable leave, !
about two weeks in three months, during
which they visit their families on full pay.
A lighthouse on an outlying reef, for
instance, is on the same status as a light
ship, except that it cannot be blown away
and the keepers cannot leave it except
when they are relieved, as a storm might
come op and prevent their return.
Much is dune by the lighthouse board
to lurther the comfort of all its employes,
but most Ss done for those who endure
the solitary lire at the isolated lights and on
the lightship*. Libraries are furnished the
keepers and their lamilies; each contains
about forty volumes of works of history,
science and poetry, with a fair supply of
good novels. Tin* complete library is left
at a station for three months, and is then
transferred to another station by an in
spector on his quarterly visit. There are
nearly 1000 of these libraries in circulation,
each in its little portable case, and, by
tbeir judicious interchange, the keepers of
statioi.s where they are furnished, see
about 200 volumes a year.
Keepers are forbidden to engage in any
business which will prevent their presence
at their stations or interfere with the pro
per performance of their duties. Many
have useful and; orotitabl* occupations
which they carry on at the stations, while
some fill pulpits, aie Justices of the Peace
or teach school. All keepers are furnished
with quarters for themselves, and in some
cases for their families. In some cases
they are furnished with food and rations.
Other stations have barns furnished for
caitle and horses, and boats are furnished
all stations inaccessible by land.
The discipline of the service has been
always rigid, as befitting a service where
negiignnce or inefficiency may mean the
loss of many lives and much valuable
property.
Dismissal instantly follows in two
casesâ where a Keeper is found intoxicated
and where he allows his light to co out.
Keepers are trained to consider the care
of the light and the lightnouse property
above any and all personal considera
tions, and it is rare, indeed, when they
fail to reahze this high ideal. There haye
been a number of instances illustrating
the esprit de corps of the service ; how tne
keepers of the Minots Ledge, first built,
went down with the light and died at
their pests; how one keeper saved his lens
and let his family look out for themselves,
and instances where they have saved pub
lic property and lost their own.
fortunately the service is not ham
pered by any question of politics, and this
fact, coupled with the excellent discipline
maintained, accounts for the tine class of
men now in the service â men who take an
honest pride in their work, and whose in
terest makes the efficiency of the service
what it is. It is unfortunate that the
navy has no retiring laws for its seamen,
which would allow men after twenty,
twenty-five or thirty years' service, de
pending on the physical condition of the
man, to be retired and placed in the light
house service for the rest of their lives.
A valuable class of men would thus be
added, and the Nation would be paying a
debt which now goes unpaid.âPhiladel
phia Ledger.
IN FEONT Of A LOCOMOTIVE.
An Experience That Beats Football for
Making v Man Hungry.
The young engineer who has just been
graduated from college is likely to remem
ber the incidents of his first ride on a real
steam engine longer than some of the les
sons he took four years to learn at the
university.
"I went up to New York the other day
on my first engine test," said a young M.
E. of Philadelphia, who is in the employ
of a locomotive works. "It was a novel
and interesting experience, and one lvery
much enjoyed. But then a fellow could
enjoy almost any old thing after working
four months in the grime and dirt and
grease of the shop at the munificent
rale of 8 cents an hour. 1 suppose
I ought to consider myself lucky
to have secured any sort of work
when times were as hard as they were this
summer. Probably half the mun that
were graduated with me last spring would
be glad to have my chance, but still it
rather goes against the grain. At the
laic of 6 cents an hour we make only 64
cents a clay, $3 84 a week, wuen we work
eight hours a day for six days in the week.
But otten we don't get that chance. Be
iore election nut many engines were being
built, and sometimes 1 didn't work more
than twenty-live hours a week. Then I
earned the magnificent sum of $2 in seven
days.
"I'he engine we tested was made last
soring for the Jersey Central .Railroad to
haul tLe Royal Blue express from liew
York to Washington. The engineer of
tests and 1 rode from Phiiadeipma in an
eugine-cab to Jersey Cily, where the
engine we were to test â No. 456 â was
waiting for us in the roundhouse. It
was a beauty, a great shining iron
beast, witu drivers eighty-four inches
high. It had been brought to the rouud
nou^e the day beipre, and the mechanics
had trued up or lined up its cross-head
guides. We placed the indicators in the
cylinder, coaied our engine, filled the
water tank, backed into the station, hitched
to our train, ana were nil reaay to start
when time came.
"The engineer of tests and I took our
place 3on the lront of the engine oa the
ngnt hand Â»iue. He read the draught
gauge and speed, and 1 pat on top of
iuo cylinder taking indicator cards. You
haven't any idea ot tue breeze creaioa by
a train running at the rate of more than
a mile a miuuie until you get out on ihe
trout c. id of an engine. Ihe engine cab is
a calm anu sequestered retreat m compari
son. It. seemed to rue that we were tear
ing the very heart out of the wind. The
engine under me snorted and panted and
quivered like a wild animal in a rage, as
it sprang forward wildly into space,
shrieking snrilly half the time. The
wind smote my cheeks ii..c the blow of
a sharp blade. My eyes smarted with
smoke and the tears that the wind
dried. But for all that it was glorious
â the very apotheosis of splendid motion.
Tue landscape rushed past me like a fright
ened thiug. Farms, towns, rivers, me
earth, the sky. A.I was an indescribable
blur. At times 1 wondered il the iron
monster wasn't running away. Aud then
I thought of the daiKy who said he'd
rather be in a railway disaster than a
steamboat smashup, for in the former case,
'Dar you isl' but in the latter, 'War is
you?'
"1 must have been a funny sight for the
birds on the telegraph wires, as I dashed
past them on the top of that cylinder. I
fancy I looked like a dropsical brownie. I
had on two pairs of trousers, a flan
nel shirt, two vests, two sweaters
and a coat, besides a lot of heavy
underclothing. I wore a cap that
came down over my neck and ears,
and my feet were wrapped up in coffee
sacks until they were as big as a water
bucket. The only parts of me that the at
mosphere got a chance at were my cheeks
and my hands. I had to have the fingers
cut out of my mittens in order to handle
the indicator cards.
"When we reached Elizabeth we d scov
ered that one of our cro->shead guides was
getting hot. It had probably been lined
up wrong. We stopped, oiled it up well,
and started again, but it troubled us so
that we had to slow down considerably,
and by the time we reached Belle Meade
it was almost hot. That ended our
test for that day. We took off our
engine and let ihe train proceed with
a switch engine we picked up at Belle
Meade, while we backed 456 into Jerssy
City. It was 7 o'clock at night by tha
time we had all our traps off the engine
and were ready to start for home. We
hadn't a bite to eat since morning. Well,
I used to think alter a iootbali game that
I knew what it was to be hungry and stiff,
but my ride on that engine cylinder con
vinced me that I had previously had only
the laintest conception of what hunger
and weariness mean."-â New York Sun.
SOME NEW THINGS.
To bold a music book and prevent the
leaves from turning a new device has an
upright standard to which are attached
two X-shaped wire springs, the ends of
which project oxer the edges of the book,
the holder being; adapted to tit any size
book by opening or closing the springs.
The use of a roll and case to hold
clothes lines when not in use has just been
patented. When it is desired to use the
line the catch that holds tlie reel is re
leased, tuna allowing the cord to unwind,
when it can be threaded through, eyelets
on the different posts and fastened to the
last one, winding up the reel to draw the
line tight from post to post.
An adjustable dental mouth-mirror
jusi out. has a bead band to hold fast a
numDer of adjustable rods attached to
each other, the advantage being that the
dentist has both hands free for his instru
ments without having to hold the mirror.
For use in moistening and sealing en
velopes a new device consists of a series of
rollers through which the envelopes are
passed by means of turning a crank at the
aide of the machine, the first set of rollers
holding the body of the envelope fast un
til the moistening roller has operated on
the flap, when it is passed between the
secondary rollers to seal it.
To prevent wind and rain from coming
into a house under thedoor a new weather
strip is fastened to the bottom of the door
and is automatically raised and lowered
as the door opens and shuts by means of
a spring and projecting armj which tits
into a recess in the door, the strip lying
over the edge of the door sill when the
door is shut.
The protection of shirt Bosoms cy a
water-proof body having a neckband and
straps at the aide for fastening it around
the body of the wearer has just been pat
ented.
One of the most useful of recent inven
tions ii a pneumatic hammer for driving
nails or riveting bolts, etc., the air pres
sure being admitted through a pipe con
nected with the hammer eating and act
ing intermittently on a spring plungei
carrying a hammer at its outer end, the
mechanism bejn*-controlled by a lever at
the side to vary the force of the blows as
desired by preventing the plunger from
coming back. The hammer can be made
in any size desired for light or heavy work.
MORE LABOR FOR
GOOD ROADS
The New Department of
Highways Swings
Into Motion.
The Engineers Ciing to the Plan
for a Grand System of
State Highways.
President Marsden Manson Is Dis
gusted With the Late Legislature,
but Strong for the Fn'ure.
The Department ol Highways was or
ganized last Tuesday ana squared away
for an important two years' career. It's
the Department of Highways now instead
of tne Bureau of Highways, as it was be
fore.
Marsden Mnnpon, the surviving mem
ber of the old commission, was elected
president, and when he was in town yes
terday he told something of the hopes,
plans and projects of the new commission,
W. L. Ashe, J. H. Price and himself.
Mr. Manson has no exalted opinion of
the benefits of Legislatures to the good
roads movement, and neither have other
road experts.
"They turned everything backward that
the commission recommended," declared
Mr. Mansen ye3teriay. "We recom
mended laws that would have produced a
systematic betterment of the roads at less
taxation than now and they created a
chaotic condition at increased coat We
recommended systematization and classi
fication, providing for State, county and
district highways. We recommended a
scheme of great State highways, planned
with reference to the general needs of the
State and its future development, and not
to the wants of particular towns. We
placed them where nature made them
proper, gave the general termini and out
lined their general alignment. The Legis
lature provided that any county may peti
tion the Department of Highways to have
any piece of road in its borders declared
a fctate highway, and if we refuse the
matter must be decided by an arbitrator.
A State highway should be a Slate high
way and not wholly a county road. The
Governor vetoed most of the other road
laws passed, for which I am not sorry.
"At the close of the session the Legisla
ture passed the Clark district road law,
which was a chaotic and idiotic measure,
and distinctly a step backward in road
improvement. It upsets the method of
road administration throughout the coun
ties and may put a stop to road improve
ments until the courts can adjust the legal
complications involved. In connection
with other laws it creates a question as to
whether the County Supervisors or the
District Trustees provided for shall have
jurisdiction. The Attorney-General has
recommended that the question be taken
to the courts, and it may result in having
to wait two years for much road improve
ment."
During the next two years the depart
ment of highways will carry on the work
of the past two years in a more extended
way, ci.nging tenaciously to the purpose
of establishing a grand system of ate as
well as county and district highways, ex
ploring every part of the State for the
best and economical supplies of road ma
terials, keeping up the agitation for good
roads, holding public meetings, publish
ing road information, advising road
builders everywhere, and getting ready a
batch of road laws to risk oa the next
Lfgislature.
During the present season Messrs. Price
and Ashe will travel through Central and
Northern California, giving; special study
to the proposed main State highway, al
ready located in outline, locating their
alignment, etc., more definitely, with a
view to the future. Marsden Manson will
give this season mainly to Southern Cali
fornia, studying especially the occurrence,
availability, mode of development, etc., of
road materials in that part of the State.
Several bulletins relating to road matters
will depend on the office of Public Printer.
The department will have the pioneer
work of the past two years to build on in
putting at the service of the 6tate the
most approved methods of highway con
struction, as the law demande.
PBANOE'B POPULATION.
Moaning and Results of the Decreasing
Number of Births.
Jacques Bertillon, the inventor of the
famous system of identifying criminals,
has written an article for the Temps of
Paris on the decreasing birth rate in
France and its effect on the population.
He says:
"Our fears are again surpassed. An
official report which is about to be pub
lished by tho Journal Officiel shows a de
ficit of 17,000 lives during the year of 1895.
"This report is symptomatic and of its
kind the very worst yet made. In 1890,
1891 and 1892 th â¢â¢ statements showed an
exefss of deaths over births; but that
was easily explained, as then the grip was
at its height and decreased the births
while it raised so alarmingly the number
of deathi. In 1895 the figures have but
one explanation: the birth rate is growing
less, and it has b*en ever since the begin
ning of the century, rapidly tending to
place itself on an equal footing with the
mortality list. This bus at last happened.
It the birth rate continues to diminish â
which it must do unless some remedy is
found â we must resign ourselves to the
fact that France is rapidly going out of
existence, while other countries crow daily
more powerful, as the following figures
will prove:

1841â60 37|1891â 9i 22
"This decrease in births is general
throughout France, especially... in the
northern parts and in Brittany. It has
been explained as a cons quence of civili
zation; but if this were so it should be
necessary to accept France as the only
civilized nation of tne world, for she is the
sole great European country where births
diminish with such implacable regularity,
as these figures will show: -

"The political and military conse
quences that will ensue are easy to per
ceive. On the morrow of their war France
and Germany had almost the same num
ber of recruits (296,334 in France and 330,

to the hope of again reconquering what

they increased to 3,374,000,000. During
the same period the German exports in
croased from 2 974,000,000 francs (the aver
age for 1872-1876) to 4,500,000,000. The rea
son for this :s very simnle: The number
of our workmen doea not increase, waile
in Germany the population has jumped
from 41,000,000 to 52,000,000; hence this
gain over us.
"In Austria the same condition prevails.
Her exports for 1869-1873 averaged 1,055,
--000.000 francs annually; in 1594 the fiuures
had almost been doubled, reaching 1,988,
--000.000. This is also explained by a gain
of 7,000,000 of population!
"At the end of the last century Trance
represented 27 percent of the population
of the great European powers, and our
language was the one most spoken
tbroughont the world. To-day she lives
on her pa3t. There are 46.000,030 of peo
ple who know French from birth. Such
is the number of readers that a French
book could have; but the same book
written in German could be read by more
than 97,000,000 men, and if in English by
more than 115,003,000 people. Therefore,
it is not only our political and our mili
tary power that is menaced by the de
creasing births in our population, but
also our economic power, and above
everything it is the intellectual and moral
influence of our writers over the world, it
Is the intellectual patrimony of Franca
that is on the verge of disappearing."

It is admitted tnat for purpose" of de
bate it would be a great advantage if tbe
House could be made a more compact
boly, but the members are loth to give
up their desks, and it is argued that if
members could not write during the ses

sit on b. bench and listen it would be
harder than ever to get together a quorum
for the transaction of business. Mr.
Re-a's remedy for that would be to
amend the' provision of the constitution
which makes a majority of the House a
quorum, and to provide instead that
some arbitrary number â fifty or one hun

however, would not be easy to bring

Dr. Chalmers, the State quarantine
officer, asserts that he is in full authority
as far as the quarantine laws of California
are concerned. "Under section 3020 of the
Political Code," said he yesterday, "I
have full power to handle nil these ves

without the certificate of the representa
tive of the City Board of Health, and as
such I will assert my rights. The whole
matter has resolved itself into a conflict
between the State and Federal authorities,
and I think we will win. It we cannot
stop the passengers mid cargo in the bay
we can prevent all and sundry from land

fumigating, we can order the vessel back
into quarantine and then the trouble will

While the ruling of the Federal authori

over the Stale laws, still Dr. Chalmers, on

In the zone between 35 deg. and 50 deg.

may be expected, le-s irequemly, however,

Along the coast of Mexico and Central

occur.
Fog and mist will be prevalent along the

Frequent log may be expected north of the

C. F. Smurr on the Work At

The Transcontinental Lines to Hav<
an Agency in the W indy
City.
C. F. Smurr, general freight agent of the
Southern Pacific, returned yesterday after
several weeks' absence in St. Louis and
Chicago. Mr. Smurr, as well as ilr.
Stubbs, who has not yet arrived, ana other
leading railway officials, have been meet
ing the representatives ol d fferent lines
in an endeavor to come to some under
standing about rates.
The recent Supreme Court decision
knocked the Transcontinental Association
to pieces and the railroad? have been try
ing to effect some kind of a traffic organi
zation 10 take in the lines that were in the
old association, besides other line?.
There was a meeting in St. Louis, so
Mr. Smurr states, of the railroad lines in
the Texas traffic. The prospect us of an
organization was formulated, provding
in substance, that all rates of all lines be
announced through one medium. In case
of the unlawful manipulation of rates
there is to be an investigation and the
evidence gained is to be submitted to the
Interstate Commerce Commission.
The organization will probably be
known, Mr. Smurr says, as the South
western Bureau.
Tne meeting in Chicago was represented
by various railway men interested in the
Pacific Coast business. No rates were di v
mrbed, but a number of changes were
made in the groupings of articles carried
nr.der carload in westbound commodity
tariffs. They were sugeested by the Pa
cific Coast Metal and Hardware Associa
tion.
No changea were made In the eastbound
rates.
The transcontinental lines, he goes on
to say, will probably have no association,
but will have an ngency in Chicago to
publish the rates of different lines. These
will be filed with the Interstate Commerce
Commission.

LIFE IN CITIES
IS ARTIFICIAL
Professor Jordan on the
Subject of a Mission
"Zo."
He Thinks It a Boon for Al 1
Classes and the Best Site
on Earth.
Vigorously Denies Some Misrepre
sentations of Speech Made in
the "Examiner."
President David Btarr Jordan lectured
last evening in Social Hall, at the inter
section of Twenty-first and Howard streets,
on the subject of a Mission zoological gar
den. George D. Shadburne. president of
the Mission Park Association, acied as
chairman of the evening and introduced
the speaker in a few brief remarks bearing
on the importance of the queatiou uuder
consideration.
"There are certain peculiarities of life in
cities not iound in the country," said
Professor Jordan in his opening remark?.
"In the first place, we have not learned
bow to live in cities. Under the artificial
conditions at present obtaining they are
really devourers of lie. The rich either
lead lives oi ease without sufficient exer
cise or too much brainwork in the cares of
business without sufficient recreation. In
the case of the common people â meaning
those in moderate circumstancesâ they
generally have not the opportunity lor
proper recreation. All classes are affected
by the constant wear and tear on the
nervous system incident to the noise
made by heavy wagons on cobbles, the
streetcars and the machinery of large
establishments.
"Contagious diseases generally appear
in cities, becau-e there the microbes
abound through lack of proper sanitation.
There is a tendency to seek spurious
p eafures also and to drown the effects of
care by the use of drugs."
The lar est percentage of efficient men,
Professor Jordan believed, either came
from the country themselves or within
one or two generations. He was proui
that he had been reared in the country,
and had learned to drive horses, make hay
and plow.
These statements led up to the subject
of tne p'rk, which he said would bring
the country into the City in the form of
a breathing spot, where all could have
neodci rest and recreation. European
cities, he arHe<l, thing money spent in
parks and zoological gardens a good in
vestment.
"In London, 1 ' he continued, "a zoologi
cal garden is maintained tit a great ex
pense, because the climate there is not
equable. This is largely true of New
York. Chicago and Philadelphia.
"We could maintain one here at a third,
or perhaps a fifth, of the cost of any of
these. We have, in addition, a host of
land and marine animals that could be se-
cured at no great expense and would
form novel attractions.
"There is no other city in the world so
favorably situated as this one it for such
a garden. Ido not speak in favor of any
one part of the City, but my own opinion
is that the Mission'is the most favorably
situated. I believe that no place needs it
worse, for no place here is so badly
crowded.
"This, in my opinion, is the place for it,
and there is no better time to start it than
this summer."
Professor Jordan's remarks were warmly
applauded, especially his expression of
sentiment in favor of the Mission, and at
their conclusion a resolution of thnnks
was introduced by Attorney T. V. O'Brien
and adopted unanimously.
President George D. Shadburne then in
vited him to deliver the lecture at the
time of beginning work on the park,
which he believed would be soon.
Samuel Partridge ihen gave several
stereopticon viewa of park and zoolo ; ical
garden scenes and of various animals.
Professor Jordan was asked after con
cluding his lecture if he bad made the
statement, purporting to come from him
published in yesterday's Examiner, that
"there are only twelve first-class lawyers
in California who are equal to the best
lawyers elsewhere. The others are pre
tenders."
He made v gorous denial, asserting that
he had merely said a legal friend once re
marked in canversation that there were
only about a doeen lawyers in California
equal to the best elsewhere, and that they
descended in quality gradually to some
who might perhaps be termed misnomers.
"Nor did I say," he protes ed, "that
'there are a dozen first-class physicians in
this City, but there is a mob of other doc
tors whose Dictures are in the daily news
papers and who murder people in the
uark." What 1 did say was that if such a
condition of affairs as regards attorneys
really obtained the same would probably
be found true in mÂ°dical circles. The
article in question misrepresented me all
the way through " '

Attorney M. M. Fooie, while McKinstry & Mc-
Kinslry appeared ou behalf of the relatives of
Hie accused, who considered him dangerously
insane.
It was evident that the verdict of the jury
was based on the excellent understanding
manifested by Lenormand while on the wit
ness-stand. He seemed to comprehend all the
proceedings and to have a full appreciation of
circumstances attending his incarceration in
a madhouse. He appealed to the jurors to put
themselves In his place and see how they
would liar to be committed to an asy.um al
though conscious of having the faculties in
their normal state.
Several physicians who are experts in mat-
tern of insanity testified that the young man
appeared to be insane and warned the jurors
thnt hts mind might take a dangerous turn,
but despite this warning the jury set him free.
ELEOTEIO BOAD BONDS-
Rehrand Jnost Successful In Hit Ap
peal to the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court Commissioner N. P.
Chipman has rendered a decision in the
case of the Bradford Investment Company
against Behrend Joo st et a!., which was
concurred in by Justices Britt and Haynen,
in which the case was sent back to the
Superior Court of San Francisco for a new
trial. It was an action to foreclose fifty
first-morteage bonds of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Railroad Company of the
par value of $1000 each exclusive of cou
pons, given to secure a promissory note of
$25,000, issued by Joost. An agreement
was made by Joost that the bonds might
be sold for the payment oi the note. The
plaintiff's right to judicial foreclosure was
not denied, but the right of a personal
judgment against Joost for a deficiency, if
there was my, was questioned.
Upon filing the answer, the plaintiff
moved for judgment on the pleadings, on
the ground that the answer denied none of
the material allegations of the complaint.
The lower court granted the motion and
ordered judgment in accordance with the
prayer of the complainant, including a de
ficiency iudgment, to which order Joost
excepted and on this he appealed. The
other defendants did not appeal. After
reviewing the case at length, Commis
sioner Chipman says:
My conclusion ii that the trial court erred in
granting plaintiff's motion for judgment on
tiie pleadings, an d it is recommended thnt the
judgment be reversed and that a new trial be
granted.

OSBORN RUBS THE POUND.
The Humane Sccety Thrown
Out in the Cod by the
Supervisors.
The Keeper Has drained a Do;
Establishment in an Old Mission
Brewery.
The Public Pound has again passed un
der control and supervision of the City
because of a refusal on the part of the
Supervisors to remove Fred A. Osborn,
the present keeper.
The pound was formeriy a City institu
tion, but in 1893 passed into the hands of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.
A keeper was appointed by the society
at a salary of $75 per month, which he
never drew. Later tie resigned and Osborn
was appointed. He, too, turned the salary
back to the society until a short time ago,
when he informed the directors that his
circumstances were such as to make the
pay needful to him and he kept it. Then
a movement was made to oust him, ihe
consent of the Supervisors being necessary
for such action. This action was taken on
the ground that the society could not
stand the expense.
Tlie Health and Police Committee of
the board heard both sides Friday, and
on the showing by Osborn that rhe society
h*d a big cash balance to its credit and
also owned real estato the petition for Os
burn's removal was denied.
Directors Lissak, Hutching and Stevens,
who appeared for the society, then an
nonncfi that the pound would be closed,
but Osborn at once announced that he
would provide a pound and there the
matter dropped.
Osborn lost no time in making good his
threat, for yesterday, he selected as the
new pound an old brewery on Fifteenth
nnd Dolores streets, wtiere in the future
he will exterminate luckless and home
less canines. He will be obliged to tit up
the entire place and provide wagons,
horses, harness, etc., for those recently in
use are the property of the Society for het
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
This society of course will close the

A SEVENTY-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
STRICKEN WITH THE GRIP.
Mrs. Mary Stevens Tells a Story of Suffer-
ing and How She Was Cured.
Mrs. Mary Stevens, who resides at 425
Eddy street, San Francisco, said:
"My troubles I date back to a severe at-
tack of the grip two years ajro. Siuce that
time I have doctored considerably in order
to get relief from the re-ults of the grip. I
can candidly say I have obtained no real
help until I beg;<n taki-g the Electro-
Medical treat men t. I ran now sleep and
*at. I feei hungry now as I d d not be-
fore, can walk up a flight of stairs with
ease, and my cough is gone.
"I am, in fact, curort, and place it all to
the creak of the Electro-medical treat-
ment. Especially is this happy result re-
markable, as lam now past TO years of
ace, and cculd har.lly have expected 10
regain mv health and sir.ngth so readily."
Signed May 29, 1897-
MARY STEVENS.
This is but one of the many remarkable
cares made at the State Electio-Medical
Institute during the week. The
curing of disease by the Electro- Medical
treatment, which, by the way, cannot be
had at any other place than at the above
Institute, is beyond the compreuension of
ihe lochl doctors. Many of them have
visited the Institute '.o solve what seemed
to them a mystery.
Animals' Home, as it was called, at once.
The first move was mnde yesterday by the
discharge of five of the employes. From
all appearances the new dogcatchers will
be ttiose who ran with the wagon for Jake
Lindo.
fc-A. H. Lissak, one of the directors of tha
society, is very indignant over the action
of the Supervisors in retaining Osborn
and completely ignoring a large organiza
tion whose only purpose is to labor in the
interest of humanity and common de
cency. He said thsit while the society
owns considerable property its income is
not sufficient to pay expenses within $50 a
month. It has over $19,000 invested in
the home on Sixteenth street, which is
now practically useless. It also has a lot
on California street irom which no reve
nue is derived. Mr. I/s'sak feels anything
but kindly toward Mr. Osborn for the part
he has taken in this controversy, naying
that without the society's aid Oiborn
would never have been made PouDdkeep
er. He regrets that the Pound should
pass irom under the control of the society,
and predicts that n will fall into disreputa
as it was in former years. His sentiments
are shared by nearly all the other di.
rectors.
SON AGAINST PATHEB.
Tonng; Peixotto in the Role of a Legal
Iconoclast.
Attorney Edgar Peizotto is naving
some -port with the indictments presented
by his venerable father as foreman of the
Grand Jury. When the indictments
against Dr. Frederick H. Stahle, charging
him with embezzlement of property be*
longini* to the City and County of San
Frnncisco, were tiled the original docu
ment bore the signature of Peixotto pere,
and possibly just to show ihat he bore no
malice to the family Dr. Stahle at once
employed Peixotto nla 10 conduct his deÂ«
fense. His first move was to demur to
the indictment, and the District Attorney
tacitly admitted that he was right by al
lowing and advising the filing of a new
indictment. When the fresh documents
were presented in Judge Carroll Cook's
court yesterday the younger Peixotlo at
once began to pick flaws and point out
errors. In order to bring the matter up
regularly a continuance was granted until
next Tuesday.

The loyal Greeks of San Francisco, in
the depth of their sympathy for their

another effort to help them by raising a
fund to loiward to Athens. The follow

who sign it:

together with sympathizers ot the Hellenic
cause, haviJ organized the Hellenic Christian
Aid Society of Sun Francisco, Cal., for the pur

rel;ei as may be in their power to those en
gaged in the heroic struggle.
In view ol the tact that Greece, to-day, sin
gle-handed and alone, is lighting the battle of
all Christendom against the Turk, we feel
justified in appealing to you, and to others
who may sympathize with us, to come to the
assistance of the Hellenic Christian Aid So
ciety in the work It has undertaken.
We therefore beg that you will, without de
lay, take such action thai may to you seem
most practicable to raise all the money posd

OAKLAND, Cal., May 25.-The Academic team of baseball players of St. Joseph's Academy have issued a â tatement that they are the champions of the coast of all
.teams under 16 years of age. These successful young players nave won twenty-one games out of twenty-three, and last Sunday added one more victory to their string
because of the failure of the Little Swins of San Francisco to come over here and play. The Little Swins are supposed to be the crack team of San Francisco, and it was
from ti.em that the challenge came to St. Joseph's. At the last moment they backed out and declined to cross the bay. The Academics unbesiutlneiy declare that ibis
was due to fear and have claimed the game. â  v â .- â¢

YOUNG CHAMPIONS OF THE COAST.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1807.
FREE BEER FOR
THE MILLIONS
Appalling Programme of
Brewery Syndicate's
Picnic To- Day.
Free Trains, Free Lunch and
Carloads of Free Beer for the
Unheard-O: Festival.
The First Empty Refrigerator.Car
Will Be a "Cooler," ani There'll
B2 Sixtun B?ers Apiece.
The picnic season has achieved a wild
i and dazzling glory that beggars meta
' phor â achieved it out here by the sunset
seas amid the dizzying speed of the cen
tury's end.
On this Sabbath day there will be free
i beerâ beers in factâ for all the world that
can get to Niles Canyon.
To-day will know the first great picnic
of the brewery syndicate. The world fur
nished the like of this when Nicholas 11,
! amid his late crowning, fed tne Moujitc
j nordes with vast hospitality and scoop
j shovels on the Moscow plains, out such
events do not often flash in this selfish
world. The idea was conceived at the
; office of the San Francisco Breweries
I (limited), where Manager Stone means
| business every minute. But the picnic
j was planned and approved by the eight
i breweries in the syndicate. There is
I peace with viciiance and keen, very keen,
i competition in the local beer world, and
| customers are loved and cherished.
! Jealous people say that it is a scheme to
I advertise and popularize the syndicate
| beers in a "be a good fellow way," Dut
I that's just talk.
Anyway invitations were sent out last
! week. "To their customer*, employes
, and friends,'' said the iitiie fo'ders and
the outside brewers took "ttieit" to mean
their customers and friends too and they
i swore softly. The invitations were excit-
I ing reading. "Don't bring money;
J noshing will De sold," it reads right tnere
on the middle of the third page just a
! little below "plenty to eat and someihing
jto drink.' fc-kip the luncii business and
I here it is again â "L quid refreshments
will be dispensed free and fieely by all
j brewers and bottlers."
Free beer for the million I The effective
j nessot adveriising was never demonstrated
i betore. The syndicate stops at co half-
I way business. The quality of its hospi-
I tality <vas not strained. It announced
' free tickets and special trains to get its
! friends to the Gamonnian fountain. By
1 last Saturday night the applications
| actually on file numbered 30,000. Tnis
week the requests parsed the 50,000 mark.
It was decided that the ticsets should
j be apportioned among the eignt brewer
i ies and the associated bottling concerns
i in proportion to the barrels of beer sold
! currently, eacu brewery to distribute its
j tickets according to fts own shrewdness,
| skill and generosity. In a single week
half of the bos* orewers in town hhve
turned gray-neadsd and sad-eyed and rea
son has seemed ready to totter in its
throne. Delicacy forbids dwelling on this
part of the situation.
The capacity of the Southern Pacific
Railroad on v iren-beer day had to be
learned, to know how many tickets could
â  be issued. The raiiroud might as well
j have been a bobtail car line down the
i county road. It couldn't have got them
! all there in a week. It has attended to
i some pretty big j ius in its time, but when
j the syndicate nad cried "Free beer!'
J General Superintendent Fiiliuore just
i threw up his hands. He and Manager
Stone tilted along for two or threa days
and then he said that he could supply
cars for 3000 people by using some idle
! gondolas. Mr. Stone heard more rerorts,
1 viewed the demand again and late Mon
; day aiternoon gave Mr. r'Lllmore the ulti
' matnm that if it wasn't made 3500 the
j picnic would be declared off. Fillmore
surrendered and later surrendered again,
so thai 4200 tickets and baizes have been
apportioned. Some strong men are wish
ing that they had died young. There will
â | be 46 000 stricken ones in San Francisco
; to- lay.
The 4JOQ will, however, be only the
j specially honored guests. Anybody who
can get to Niles Canyon by regular trains,
buggies, bU-ycies, flying-machines or
shank lines can tome in and eat a-nd drink.
There is a large population within a few
miles of Niles Canyonâ enough to blanch
the cheek. But that's the programme.
"We expect perfect ordier," says the in
vitation. "Sheriff White says we'll have
it. Bring wife, best girl and children."
The imagination may needlessly pale,
for it will undoubtedly be a gentle, foamy,
dreamy delight of a Sabbath day. There
has only been one danger canvassed. If
the liquid refreshments should give out
in an untimely way â be meager or inade
quate, or something like thatâ the lion in
the breast of the people, while not exactly
rousing, might cause a long ng for home
and friends on the part of committees and
others.
It is reported that the Southern Pacific
Company yesterday retused to sell any
more tickets to the place for its regular
trains, as the car supply had eiven out.
The managers have arranged with Sheriff
White that the refrigerator car first emp
tied shall be used as a calaboose for the
first rioter and his followers. Five lone
special trains will rarry the syndicate's
special guests, and tho unnumbered thou
sands besides will be an inspiring sight.
To dispense the beer there will be a num
ber of sixty-loot counters, many tables,
and twenty-four waiters will go about
with great pitchers to fill any glass pre
sented.
"We estimate that we can supply six
teen glasses of beer to every man, woman
and child," said the secretary of the syndi
cate yesterday.

CRICKET CHIRPS.
Two of the City Teams Gotnjr Out
for Country MatchesâSun
dry Notes.
The local grounds will be practically de
serted on Decoration day by reason of the
exodus of the Pacific and Alameda teams
to country fields. The former left the
City last evening for Penryn. It will be
made up of the following players: Myers,
Dickinson, Harbour, Casidy, James, Mc-
Gaw, Wiseman, J. Theobold, Bloomfield,
Townsiey and Weiae.
The Penryn boys are preparing to give
the visitors a warm reception, so their
popular secretary, A. E. Coates, who was
in the City during the week, informed me.
The Alameda eleven go to San Jose to
play tiie Garden City Club a one-day match
Monday. They will he led by their doughty
chief, R. B. Hogue, and should give a good
account of themselves.
Ernest D. Severs, late Pacific bowler, left
San FrÂ«nciÂ»co Thursday for his new home
at Jhnuba.
At last the Portland cricketers are get
ting a move on. The Atuletic Club had a
meeting iaat week and arranged the
schedule for the season. They have some
exctsllent new cricket talent, including the
following names: Cameron, Barfaat, Luke,
Allison, Taylor and Williams.
Work on the new grounds at Riverside
is going on rapidly and it is expected that
they will be opened on July 4.
On Decoration day the Associated Banks
will play the Aluhnomahs on the latter's
grounds.
On June 20 tnere is to be played the an*
nual Town vs. Country match either at
Alameda or Golden Gate.
The Kn^lish cricket news is now chiefly
concerned with big scores. Prince Ran
jitsinhji exceeded all former efforts in the
M. C. Ok and Ground vs. Sussex by a four
hour innings of 260 runs for Sussex.

Basket Ball.
The Business Men's team played their
last game of basket ball in the present
tournament last Thursday. evening. Their
opponents were the Ninety-seven team.
It was quite a one-sided game, as the
Business Men's team are so much taller
and heavier, and put up splendid team
work. The score was 48 to 0 in favor of
the Business Men of the San Francisco
Y. M. O. A.
The teams lined up as follows:

KILLING THE WRIT
OF HABEAS CORPUS
Lawyer Crittenden Declares
That Such Is Threat
ened.
Judges of the Superior Court
Urged to Review Their
Brothers.
No Fine Paid by Lillian Ashley's
Attorney for Carrying a
R volver.
Attorney James L. Crittenden has not
yet paid that fine of $250 which was im
posed on him by Judge Slack several
months ago. The fact of the non-pay
ment was recalled by the habeas corpus
proceedings in Judge Carroll Cook's court
yesterday, Mr. Crittenden alleging that
he had been illegally restrained of his
liberty under Judge Slack's order.
Attorney Sidney Van Wyck first pre
sented to Judge Cook the petitioner's
application for a discharge, and began to
set forth the facts as they appeared to
him, but in this he was interrupted by
tbe court with the remark that counsel
would be admonished to confine his argu
ment to the facts as they appear on the
face of the commitment; that as to the
facts the commitment is taken to be con
clusive.
This ruling is in conformity with the
most recent decisions of the Supreme
Court of this State, notably illustrated in
the cases of Attorneys Smith and Coffev,
who were adjudged guilty of contempt of
court by Police Judge Jonchimsen. In
the Superior Court they offered to prove
that Judge Joachimsen was mistaken as
io the facts; that, as a matter of fact, they
did not advise certain prisoners to remain
mute when called on to plead, for the good
reason that they could not speak the Chi
nese language, which was the only lan
guage that the prisoners could speak or
understand.
Judge Wallace ruled that the petition
ers had no legal right under the law of
this Siate to be heard in regard to the
facts involved; that the commitment from
the court below is by the force of the stat
ute presumed to recite the truth. This
position was upheld by the Supreme
Court, and Messrs. Smith and Coffey had
to pay the penalty. Judge Wallacs re
marked that the law is clear in its terms,
and thnt he was not to bkirno if there is
any hardship resulting Irom its enforce
ment; that if there is any complaint to be
rmide in regard to the justice of the enact
ment, that complaint ought to be ad
dressed to the Legislature aud not to the
courts.
Mr. Van Wyck, payinc heed to Judge
Cook's suggestion, read from the record
of the proceedings in Judge Slack's court,
wherein it was made to appear that during
the trial of Ashley against Baldwin, Emma
Ashley drew a pistol, which was seized by
J. 11. Unruh; that Unruh pointed said
pistol nt James L. Crittenden, who is the
I petitioner here, whereupon Cnttenden
made a move to draw a weapon and threat
ened to shoot Unrab, said Crittenden be
ing then nrmed with a loaded revolver.
Mr. Van Wyck said that the petitioner
would line to supplement the record, which
was correct as far as it went, but being
denied that course, would address the
argument solely to the matters of law in
volved in the proceeding.
This order of commitment, Mr. Van
Wyck said, was in the nature of a judg
ment, and as such is subject to attack as'
aie oilier judgments.
The court appeared to concede the cor
rectness of this point, and Mr. Van Wyck
said that if this proposition be sound the
order of commitment must fail, because
there are some persons who have ft right
to wear a loaded revolver in the presence
of the court, and thai there is nothing in
the commitment to show affirmatively
that Crittenden is not one of the exempted
persons. He also called attention to the
fact that Judge Slack did not proceed
summarily to punisn the person charged
with contempt of court lor an act per
formed in the immediate presence of
the court; that in such cases the
court must proceed summarily or loss
of jurisdiction is the. result. The third
point was that the right of self-defense is
a right guaranteed by the laws of this
State, and that this right is not waived or
lost by an attorney who appears in a court
of justice.
Mr. Crittenden, the petitioner, addressed
the court in his own behalf. After em
phasizing the legal objections to the com
mitment Mr. Crittenden said: "What if a
man with a pistol in his hand should try
to kill the Judge on the bench and I be
ing present and having the right to carry
a pistol find having the pistol there pres
ent should so use it that I should save
the life of the Judge, would 1 be
liable to punishment for contempt
of court? That is not reasonable.
There is nothing in this record to
show that the petitioner was unlawfully
carrying a pistol at that time, and that
being the state of the record this court is
bound to find, as a matter of law, that the
commitment in this regard is defective
and inoperative." â¢ . .
Referring to his own case Mr. Critten
den said he knew of no rule that would
punish a lawyer for defending his own life
any more than for defending the life of the
Judge on the bench. When Mr. Critten
den remarked that ho never would pay one
cent of this fine so long as he could be
heard to speak in a court of justice against
"so unjust and. unreasonable an order as
this," Judge Cook seomei about to in
terrupt the speaker, whereupon Mr. Crit
tenden quietly added: "I understand that
Judges do not like to bear comments on
the acts of their brother Judges, but I do
not speak in a spirit of bitterness when I
declare that if this judgment . had been
delivered by a jury your Honor consider
ing the matter in regard to its leeal force
would set it aside on the ground of insuf
ficiency. - . â¢ "â â¢'â ' .
"In this age of trusts, combines and
combinations the courts have thus far es
caped the prevailing influence, and I hope
this may so continue. I understand that
there is an effort here to establish an un
derstanding, or concert of action in. the
Superior Court of this City. and County,
so that the judgment ot one department
shall stand as the judgment of all. 1 say
that if such a course; is pursued it is un
constitutional and is a denial of justice.
When a writ of habeas corpus is presented
to a Judge of this court it is the sacred
duty of the Judge to whom it is assigned
to" consider it as fully and as impartially
as if it had come from Arkansas or New
Jersey. These twelve Judges sitting in
this county are independent Judges, of
equal dignity and power, made so by the
constitution of the Slate, If for any reason
they or any of them should decline to re
view the acts of their brother Judges, that
would kill tue writ of ; habeas corpus in
this county. We have twelve independ
ent tribunals, established for theiafe
enarding of the people's rights, and the
observance of concert of action in matters
of ; this kind \ would reduce the court )to
practically one department.' : ; . '
'"Whether I offend Judges on the bench
or not, I say that it is their absolute duty
to perform their functions in an abso
lutely independent manner in regard to
the writ of habeas corpus as well as other
matters that come before them. The writ of
habeas corpus is the corner-stone of ,' the
liberties of the people of America and

Always' sincerely yours
To' OUR Readers: â The Medical Profession throughout America and
Europe are nearly unanimous in the opinion that head, throat, chest and lung
troubles lead to consumption, and consumption, uninterrupted, means speedy
and certain death. We publish. the Doctor's letter for our readers' benefit, and
respectfully suggest that every sufferer â  should take advantage of his most
generous offer. A medicine that will cure consumption ought to be good for any
disease. "We ask in writing to kindly tell him of having read the above letter in

as she has shown great speed. Last, year i
she won the Wallace trophy, and it is ex- |
pected that she will repeat her perform
ance, g .
The race between the Phoenicia and the
Flash should be interesting and exciting,
as last year the Flash won' from the
Phoenicia by a.very narrow, margin. "'
The Phoenicia has a. new suit of sails
and a new rigging, and it is hoped this |
will increase her speed materially.

NEW JERUSALEM
Mormons to Build a Mas
sive Temple at Inde
pendence.
The Plan to Be Drawn and
Given Man by the Divine
Architect.
A Revelation That the Site of the
Garden of Eden Lies in the
Mississippi Valley.
The Mormons intend soon to fulfill the
svord of prophecy, and in the doing
thereof will erect a massive temple at In
dependence, Jackson County, Mo. The
site, they state, has been revealed to them
by divinity.
This temple is to be built on a scale far
surpassing anything in the way of archi
tecture ever before essayed by the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and
ELDER E, H. NYE, President of the California Mission of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
the plans are soon to be revealed by the
Divine Architect. When constructed it
will be the New Jerusalem, from which
the people of God â will ascend when the
plagues are poured forth from the vials of
God's wrath upon a scoffing anc! sinful
â world.
Elder E. H. Nye, the president of the
California Mission of the Church of Jesu*
Christ of Latter-day Saints, will deliver a
lecture on this suoject of the temple to
night at Pythian CastJe. He spoke very
freely on the subject yesterday, and also
vouchsafed the information that by divine
revelation the site of the Garden of Eden
is known to members of his faith to have
been iocateo somewhere in the Mississippi
Valley.
Hi? elucidation of the prophecies and
their fulfillment, leading up to the founda
tion of the temple, is as follows:
As time roils by the Lord raises up men to
work out his pUns for the redemption of his
children, to usner in dispensations, etc. To
Joseph Smith, the great Latter-day Prophet,
were civen the keys and power to ush^r In
"the dispensation of the fullness of time*."
Having brought forth the Book of Mormon by
the power of God. and having thus revealed
to the world Â«v authentic and divine record of
the predecessors of the American Indian, he
was next commanded by the Great Master to
build a temple to whicn the Lord might come
in fulfillment of the words of the I'ropnet
Malachi: "Behold 1 will sena my lnessencer,
and he shall prepare the way before me, and
the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come
to his teniDle, even the messenger 01 the
Covenant, whom ye delight in, beho d, be
â¢hall come, saith the Lord or IloÂ»K"
(Mai. iii:l.)
Here it is clearly shown trial before the sec
ond advent of our Lord a messenger will be
sent to prepare the way and to rear a temple
to his name, where he would come and reveal
himself to man. Look abroad upon the lace
of the earth and you look in vain for a temple
the plans and specifications of which have
been riven by reveiatlon from God. Moses re
ceived on the top of Mount BiriÃi toe plans
upon which he bnilt the tabernacle in the
wilderness, and when the building was com
pleted it was dedicated to the Most High God.
80 also was tne temple of Solomon. To-day
one can find temples almost innumerable
bnilt to immortalize the name of *ome man,
sect or ordar, bat a temple of the Lord is not
fonnd save among the Latter-day Saints.

i Thus we â¢â¢ce the prophecy of Malachi was
[ literally fulfilled. The Litter-day Saints hare
I built live other templesâ one m Nauvoo, 111.,
which has since been destroyed by their ene
i mies, and lour in Utah, the crowning work of
which stand* in bait Lake City, and is more
than lour times the size of the Temple of Solo-
I mon.
Israel was scattered in ancient days, and,
| according to the Scripture*, must be gathered
i In the latter days. Ten tribes were curried
! away to the north. Judah is known all over
! the earth, but the tribe of Ephraim is lost, lost
! both to himself and to the world. No man
to-day among the Gentile races can Bay that
he is or is not of the tribe of Ephraim, but
: Ephraim must be known, Israel gathered, the
| Zton of the latter days built up and a temple
: of the Lord erected prior to the second coming
! ox our Savior, when he will taKe vengeance
: on the wicked.
! But the Christian world seems to overlook
, the fact that Christ is to come to his temple,
and to be known in Zion and her palaces in
': the latter days, long Delore his final coming in
; all his glory. He has already come to his
i temple, and the day is at hand for the estab
lishment of Zion, when "God will be known
j in her palaces tor a refuge." Already has
; Ephraim been "pushing the people together
j from the end- of the earth." Israel has been
i gathering to the place prepared and held in
I reserve lor this people by the Almighty.
The prophet Isaiah looking down through
the ages saw the picture as it now stands out
in bold relief to all who will view., it with an
unprejudiced mind. C. ii:2, "And it shall
come to paÂ«s in the last days that the moun
j tain of the Lord's house shall be established in
the tops of the mountains and shall be ex
alted above the hills, and all nations shall
flow into it." .
â¢ The Latter-day. Saints fulfill this prophecy
literally to-day in the mountains of Utah.
' I There is the prophet of the living God, with
twelve apostles at the head of the church and
. I the great temples, which together form the
mountain of the Lord's- house. It ii esub-
Hshcd in the tops of the mountains, exalted
11 Dove the hills, on the backbone, of the
American continent, and people of all nations
; How unto it. And thousands are coming up to
[ the temples of God, using in substance the
I words of the prophet, "Come ye and let us go
' up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house
I 01 the. God of Jacob; and he will teach us of
his ways, ami we will wait in his paths; for
I out whys, and we will forth the law and the
out of zion shall go forth the law and the
I word oi the Lord from Jerusalem." (Dan. ii:3.)
For years the people have been going up to
Utah, the Latter-day Zion, for the purpose of
learning; tne ways of. the Lord, that they
might walk in his paths. The law has been
going forth from Zion; the law of faltn, re
pentance, baptism and the laying on of hands
lor the gift of the Holy Ghost; and as time
presses on the word of the Lord will go forth
from Jerusalem. Already the Jews are gath
ering .to their promised land in immense num
bers. This fact is well known to all. In 1843
Joseph Smith, in obedience to a command <>i
God, sent Apostle Orson Hyde to Jerusalem to
go stand upon the Mount of Olivet and there
in the name of the Lord remove from the land
of Palestine tee curse that had so long pre
vailed over it, and also to dedicate the land to
the gathering of the Jews, preparatory to the
coming of the Son of man. From that day a
Change has been steadily wrought in that land,
and the Jews are flowing In from other lands,
i particularly from Russia. The Lord is using
the Czar of Russia to drive the Jews from that
land. And why? Because the day has come
for them to gather back to their own land;
but they will not go wittingly, hence the Lord
' moves upon the Czar of Russia to rise up and
oppress them and drive them out, that they
might go to their own lands prior to the com
me of their Messiah.
! The Zion of the Latter DayÂ« Is to be estab
lished in America. Speaking of Zlon, the
Prophet Isaiah says {sixtieth chapter first and
; second verses.): "Arise, shine, for thy light is
come and the glory of Lord is risen upon
i thee. For behold the darkness shall cover the
earu and gross darkness the people, but the
Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall
be seen upon thee."
This clearly sets forth the fact that a day
will coma when Zion shall arise and shine
and the glory of the Lo:d will be seen upon
i her, while yet darkness covers the earth and
gross darkness the people. In what way will
the glory of this Lord appear? It is told la
the fourth chapter 01 Isaiah, fifth verse: "And
the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place
of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a
cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a
flaming fire by night, for upon, all the glory
shall be a defense."
The Prophet David caught a glimpse Of this
wonderful scene, as shown In his forty-eighth
I psalm; "Great is the Lord find greatly to be
praisdd in the city of our God, in the moun
tain of hi 3 holiness, beautiful lor situation;
the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, in the
sides of the north, the city of the great King.
God is known in her palaces fora refuge." Isai
ah says (Isaiah ix-3): "And the gentiles shall
come to thy light and kings to the brightness
of thy rising." Forty-eighth psalm: "For 10,
the kings were assembled, they passed by
together, they saw it and they marveled;
they were troubled and hasted away; lear
took hold upon them there and pain as of a
woman in travail." What did they see 7 They
saw the cloud and smoke by day and the
shining of a flaming lire by night, and upon
the glory a defense over this wonderful city of
Zion, which, according to .the revelations of
God to the Prophet. Joseph Smith, will be es
tablished at Independence, Jackson County,
Mo., in this generation. Jackson County,
in this genenition.
According to the Book of Mormon and the
Hook of Doctrines and Covenants, which are
the guides of the Latter-day saints, America
is a land choice above all other lands to our
heavenly Father. : ..-,.
Keniy Father, Eden was upon this land, in
c Garden of Eden was upon this land, in
tho great Sl lgsissipui Valley, and there the
city of New Jerusalem will be built, the Zion
of the Latter-day Saints, and the great tem
pleâwhich is to Dc much larger, grander and
more magnificent than the one in Salt Luke
Cityâ and there the promise will be fulfilled
that the glory of the Lord shall rest upon it in
the form of a cloud and smoke by day and the
shining of a flaming fire by night. Then all
who are permitted to go into that temple shall
behold the face of the Son oi God, and thus
the prophecy of David will be fulfilledâ "God
is known in her. palaces for a refuge.".. , :
This city of the New Jerusalem is to be built
upon this laud. This statement may conflict
with the views entertained by orthodox
Christians -generally, because the only knowl
edge they have of that wonderful city is the
statement made by John the Revelator, when
he was permitted 'to behold the city coming
down out of heaven adorned as a bride for the
bridegroom.'- But this is net the case with the
Latter-day Sain is. We have in our possession
writings which | clearly, set forth the fact that
ho. men of Goa, were permitted to view the
city la its glory and learn ixombiu where it

would be erected long before John the Revela
tor'a day. In the Pearl of Great Price is iound
the following reference to it, given by tne
Lord to Enoch: "Righteousness and truth
will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood,
to gather out mine elect from the four quar
ters of the earth unto a place which I sholl
prepare; a Holy city, that my people may gird
ud their loins and be looking forth for the
time of my coming, for there shall be my tab
ernacle and it shall be called Zion, a New
Jerusalem."
The Prophet Ether, who lived 400 B. C, was
permitted to st-e in visions of the future the
beautiful city of the New Jerusalem, ana he
also saw that it should be built upon this land
i by the remnan' of the seed of Josephâ a holy
I city unto the Lordâ prior to the time ol his
coming.

the prophet oi the nineteenth ceniury.de
clares that the spot selected by him as the site
of the holy temple to be reared in this gen
eration is Independence, Jackson County, Mo.,
and speÃking oi the city that shall be built
there the Lord says: "And it shall be called
the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of
refuge, a p^ace o' safecy for the saints of the
i Most High God." (Doc. and Coy., p. 189.)
Some see from these sacred writings that the
lÂ»nd of America (In the eyes of the Almighty)
is choice a Dove ail other landa on the face of
I the earth and has been so from the dawn of
creation. In what is now the Mississippi Val
ley was the sacred spot where the Garden of
j Eden stood. Here also will stand ihe holy
city of New Jerusalem, the Zion of the latter
' daysâ this city wlilcn was promised by the
I Lord, foreseen by the prophets and described
! by John the Revelaior. And when the hour
of vengeance comets and the earth is aoout to
I receive her baptism of lire, when the words of
the apostle will be fulfilled, by all who are
alive and have kept the laith being caught up
to meet their Lord In the clouds, then shall
i this holy city be caught up aud all its inhabi
tants to meet him in the air; and when the
earth is puritied and cleansed of the wicked
ness and abominations that are upon its face
the saints and the holy city will descend to
the earth again preparatory for the great mil
lennial reign of pur Lord and Savior. It was
at thin particular stage of progress when John
the Revtlator caught a glimpse of the city of
ttie New Jerusalem.

STBENGTH OF THE BRITISH ARMY
The Total of All the Britinh Imperial 1
Forces Is 22 1,000.
Recent returns show that the strength
of the British imperial forces at home and
abroad is very nearly 221,000 of all ranks,
exclusive of the army reserve, and thus
well in excess of the 219,955 provided foi
in the estimate of the year. Of the total
nearly 106,000 are at home, about 76,000 in
India, 4000 in Egypt, and the remainder
are distributed over the Mediterranean
garrisons and the colonies. At home
there are, in round numbers, 26.000 troops
in Ireland and 76,000 in Ireland and
Wales. Of the large force required in
India, the Bengal command has the
greatest nhare of the 76,000, having; some
24,000 British troops, whflse the Punjab
command has 26,000, Madras and Bunnah
14000, Bombay 16,000, and the remaidtr
to complete the total are on passage.
South Africa has latterly occupied the
services of a considerable number of im
perial troops, and there are still about
6000 men at the Cape and in Nnta! and in
tho territories which have recently been
the scene of trouble. The garrisons of
Gibraltar and Malta absorb over 14,000
men, the West Indies about 3000, the
West African colonies 1000, Hongkong
nearly 3000, the Straits Settlements 1500,
Ceylon rathar more and Mauritius 1000.
In Australia there are no imperial troops;
in the Canadian Dominion some 150 J. Of
all the foreicn military stations Cyprus
and St. Helena are the smallest, the for
mer having about 150 British troops and
the latter not 300. For the most of the
colonies the numbers include special local
corps of natives, as the Malta artillery, t lie
Ceylon artillery and engineers, the Hong
kong regiment and the West Indian regi
ment; but the great Indian native army
is, of course, additional to the 76,000 im
perial troops quartered in the great depen
dency. â Boston Transcript.
L.<-se Majeste.
A queer case of lese rnajeste was that of
Adolf Hamburger, in Aschaffenburg, Ba
varia. During a conversation in the
tailor-shop of bis father he made a rude
remark about crazy King Ouo. One of
those prasent was a deaf and dumb work
man, who, of course, did not hear this re
mark, bat who, noticing the look of con
sternation on the faces of the oihers, had
it transcribed for him on a piece of paper.
Several years pasted and nothing came of
it, until one day the deaf mute quarreled
with the son ot his employer, a..<i then
went and denounced him. The court
sent toe young man to jail for sij Mouths.
TO VENTURE OR
NOT TO VENTURE
Mrs. Dimond Again Consid
ers the Matrimonial
Problem.
A Two Years' Open Offer of tbe
Heart and Hand of Mr.
Briggs of Yokohama.
A Moonlight Flooded Deck, Inquisitive
Possengers and a Unique
Proposal.
"Once bit, twice shy," is the way Mrs.
Dimond sententiously sums up her latest
love affair, offering the trite old axiom as
her only excuse for keeping the "'dearest,
sweetest fellow in all the world" waiting
for the answer which is to make him the
happiest or most miserable of men.
The lair and buxom Carey is perturbed.
Her plans are indefinite and her opportu
nities many. Witli her it is the embar
rassment of riches. Should she decide to
continue to sail her craft on the turbulent
waters of a theatrical sea there is the Mon
tana angel awaiting to launch her on the
gay New World metropolis.
Should she desire to return to the home
of i.er girlhood, again does fortune smile
on her â her stepmother has recently
passed from this world ol careâ and Mr.
Higley, her noble sire, stands ready to
welcome her to his heart, hearth ana
home. Last, but not least, there is a
handsome young Yokohama merchant
who is piayine and watching for her in
his Far Eastern home and who generously
lets his offer stand open for two years.
This latest romance of Mrs. Dimond
is quite the moat romantic of her not un
eventful life. It leads like a chapter of a
to-be-continued-in-our-next story, and
opens with that deligntful clause, "Once
1. 1 mi a time."
This is the way Mrs. Diraond tells it,
accenting the telling points witn rippling
laughter or deep sighs, just as the situa
tion demands.
''It was on my way down on the Coptic,
when I determined to go back and battle
for my rights. He was seated at ray left
at the purser's table, and incidentally our
conversation turned on lowa, its customs
and its people. 'Do you know any people
in Cedar Rapds?' he a=-kea. 'I passed
through there fifteen years ago and at
tended a wedding. One ol tha brides
maids was a little schoolgirl with the
merriest laush it has ever been the lot of
a poor mortal to hear. I have traveled
halt over the world to hear that laugh
once again.' I laughedâ l could not help
itâ and he recognized me. 'You are
Carey Hey ley,' he said, and from that mo
ment we became fast friends."
Mrs. Dimond tells of the tete-a-tetes
with only the pale moonlight shining en
the water to play ciiaperone, and of the
Yokohama merchant's growing interest
in the girl with the merry laugh.
"Then I told him all," satd Mrs. Di
mond, "or I should say, I gave him the
papers, in which the case was so widely
exploited, lie took them down to his
cabin end came no two hours later, hi-*
eyes red and swollen. 'You poor little
woman,' he said, 'I did not mean to
speak just yet, bat I must tell you what is
on my heart. First let me tell you, that
if it be best for you and your interest to
effect a reconciliation with Mr. Dimond
do so. If not, and you can see it in that
light, come out to me in Yokohama. 1
want you for my wife "
This unselfish declaration so touched
the sensitive heart of the iudy that it ap
pears it was only the inquisitive passen
gers on deck who kept her from flinging
her arms then and there about his nÂ«ck.
And then he sailed away to his Far East
ern home. Each steamer brings to the
fair divorcee tender letters filled with
sugary speeches and devotion. Each one
concludes witn a wait and hope expres
sion, and Mrs. Dimond is seriously con
templating the giving to his care, in t!ie
near mture, her undivided attention.
The name of the chivalrous gentleman
Mrs. Dimond decided to keep to herself,
but in her enthusiasm it slipped out, and
it is just plain mid ordinary Briggs â Mr.
Brigga of Yokohama.
At present Mrs. Dimond Is sharing her
qutiters at a downtown hotel with Mrs.
Jennie Douglassâ she of new-woman
fame, whose husband procured a divorce
recently on the ground mat she was too
p-ogresslve. She acts as a chÂ»erful anti
dote to Mrs. Dimond's frequent attacks of
the biues and is altogether, according to
her hostess' opinion, invaluable.
In the midst of all her cares and multi
tudinous plans Mrs. Dimond finds time to
think of her sisters in distress. "1 am so
sorry for Mrs. Abell," she said, "I will call
on her to-morrow."
RINGING THE BELL AND RUNNING.
A P*Â«tlme That Seeing to Be l'Unp
pearlng From the sport* of Youth.
"In the days when knockers graced the
house door," said Mr. Sioggleton, "the
small boy found sport in banging the
knocker and running. When bells came
in he yanked on the bell-pull and then
fled. Nowadays he mysteriously presses
the button, but the sport of calling people
to the door for nothing is not what it was,
and it seems probable that with the gen
eral introduction of the pusb-buiton it
will finally fall into decadence.
"There was some fun in pounding with
the door-knocKer, whose thunder rever
berated through tne hall and filled the
house, all of which you could hear your
self. And yon could ynnlc the bell- pull
out to the limit, causing the bell to fly
almost off the eprine; there was fun in
this. But there is no such fun in push
ing in a push-button. You can press that
in perhaps a quarter of an incn, aud that
is all you can do with it. Say you are in
the vestibule of a flat. Very likely you
don't hear the bell ring at all; it may be
that it is up three or four flights of stairs ;
you hear no sound. Nobody come* to the
door; you don't have to run. Possibly
the people whose bell you have rung may
press a button up there in the air some
where and you may bear the click of the
door-opener at your side, or they may not
do even that.
"It it dry fun ; not like thÂ« old slambaing
knocker on the outside of the door, or the
bell-pull with the jingle bell right in the
hall."â New York Sun.
Doworigbt Destitution.
She was not a woman who could sac
suffering without wanting to give relief.
"1 think," s; c said to her husband,
"that something oagnt to be done for the
Barkers in the next block. I don't be
lieve the neigtibors realize how desper
ately poor they are."
'Why, I thought they were fairly well
off," he answered in surprise.
'Oh, dear, no," she explained. "They
have to endure all sorts of privations.
Why, they only have one bicycle in the
family, and even that is not a '97 wheel."

NOVICES MADE
GOOD TARGETS
Heavy Batteries of the
Third Artillery in
Practice.
"Indirect Aiming" by Mians of
the Fange-Finder a Great .
Success.
A New Mechanical Apparatus for
Making Corrections for Wind,
Velocity, Etc.
The eight heavy batteries of the Third
Artillery stationed at Angel Island, Alca
traz, Fort Mason and the Presidio com-
Dleted their annual target practice with
the heavy rifled armament at the Presidio
on Friday. Each battery fired three
rounds from the 12-inch breech-loading
rifled mortar and three rounds from the
12-inch breech-loading steel rifle?. None
of the batteries had ever fired these guns
before, but for all that the targets made
were exceptionally good.
In thÂ« mortars an 800-pound shell was
fired at ranges of 7200 and 5000 yard?.
For the former 70 pounds of brown pris
matic powder was used and for the short
range 45% pounds. For these ranges the
mortar is given an elevation between fifty
and sixty degress and the shot takes
nearly a minute in its fliÂ»tJt through the
air. With the 70 pound charge the shell
starts with a velocity of nearly 1000 feet
a second and strikes witli a velocity of
about 100 feet less, but still quite sufficient
to penetrate the decks and bottom of uny
ship afloat. Grouped in batteries of six
teen and having a range of six miles
these mortars will prove most formidable
weapons.
The firing is done by electricily, but the
most interesting part is the aiming. As
the target it not in sight, what is called
'â¢indirect aiming" is resorted to. Observers
were stationed at Points Bonita and
Lobos, provided with an accurate instru
ment for measuring horizontal angle ll ,
something tike a large theodolite. These
angles were sent by telephone to the cen
tral station nt the mortar battery. These
angles were then plaited on a large chart
of the harbor, thus locating trie exact
position of the target. From this same
chart were taken the distance to the target,
and the exact angle at which the mortar
must be set to point toward the target.
By means of carefully computed range
tables, the elevation for the particular
range and initial velocity is then taken
out and the gun set.
At these long ranges, owing to the ro
tation of the shot in the air and the long
lima of its flight, the projectile swerves to
the right. If pointed direct at a target
7000 yards away the projectile would
strike at a point something over 400 yards
to the right of the target The proper al
lowance for this drift must be carefully
computed and applied in setting.
In a similar way the point where the
shot strikes is platted, and by measure
ments its exact deviation, right and left,
over and short, of the target becomes
Known. From theso data the proper cor
rections are made in the next shot.
The assumed target fur the mortars is
an imaginary rectangle on the water, 100
yards by 2u yards, representing the deck
of a ship. The bits are given different
values, according to their position in
this rectangle.
For the 12-inch rifle tha range was 6775
yards and two sized charges were used,
the larger of 360 pounds brown prismatic
powder made by tne California Powder
Works. The projectile weiehs 1000 pounds
and starts with the high velocity of 1725
feet a second. A 1000 yards this shot
would penetrate about twenty inches
of steel. Owing to the >low - burning
nature of the powder used in all heavy
ttuns the shock of discharge is much less
severe than :n many field pieces using
quick-burning powder. No inconvenience
was suffered by standing quite close to
the gun during discbarge.
The target was a spar buoy located be
yond the outer heads. The general
method of locating the target and plat
ting the shots was the same as in the mor
tar firing, ns at that range the target is
indistinguishable; but in addition use
was made of me Lewis range-finder aud
the Rafferty relocator recently installed.
The range-finder, by simply pointing a
telescope at the object, gives at a glance
its true direction and distance. These are
then mechanically transformed by the re
locator into the corresponding elements
for the particular gun-firing.
The shots are platted on a vertical target
210 feet by 35 feet, representing the side of
a man-of-war. A large proportion of the
shots fell close to the spar buoy, and
nearly all would have hit a vessel an
chored in that position.
For tiring the rifle a new piece of appa
ratus, devised by Captain Pratt, Third
Artillery, commanding Fort Mason, was
successfully used. This machine me
chanically makes the necessary correc
tions for wind velocity, etc., and the ret
suiting elevation for the gun is read off a,
a glance. It thus saves much computing
and is certain to ba adopted by the ar
tillery.
ONE NAME FOR BROADWAY
A Plan to Make a Single Thoroughfare
of It From Bowling Green tv Yoaken,
Incidental to the proposition now pend
ing to construct a bridge across the Spuy
ten Duyvil Creek at Kingsbridge in place
of the present footbridge there is a move
ment to drop the various names given to
parts of Broadway. It forms a continuous
thoroughfare from Bowling Green to the
Yonkers line and it is proposed to give the
title Broadway to the wholej of it. At
present it is Broadway to Fifty-ninth
street, Mien it becomes the Boulevard as
far a? One Hundred and Seventieth strett,
from there to ISpuyten Duyvil '-'reek it is
the K-ingsbridge road and in the Twenty
fourth Ward it anain becomes Broadway.
"When, how and why the chief business
thoroughfare of the Greater New York
was first called "Broadway" is one of the
mysteries of Gotham. It is not broad,
and many other streets, the Bowery con
spicuously, are better entitled to sucb a
designation. Originally, in fact, in old
New Y'orlr, lower Broadway was called
lleerc straa. Afterward the northern
portion was called Great George street,
under the English rule, and tho extreme
upper Broadway was called Bloomingdale
road. In the early part of the century
Broadway had alencth of about two miles
only, the lower half being paved.
On either side of it were dwelling-houses
of brick, and it i? one of the distinctions
of Broadway that the first sidewalk con
structed in New York was built on it be
tween Vesey and Murray streets. The
early chronicles of Broadway's growth
seem to the present generation of New
Yorkers somewhat remarkable, for at
what was called Anthony street Broadway
plunged sharply into the Canal street val
ley, between Fresh. Water Pond and the
Lispenard Meadows, and at what is now
Astor place Broadway ceased, being
crossed at this point by the wall of the
Randall farm. This wall put a stop tem
porarily to the growth of Broadway, bui
the removal of the obstacle was only a
part improvement, for many years arter

ward the upper part of Broadway, north
ol Thirty-fourth street, was widened, and
the proceedings not only consumed much
time, but also entailed cost and litigation.
The extension of Broadway across the
Spuyten Duyvil Creek line by the con
struction of the bridge at Kingsbridge, in
the annexed district, is part of the local
improvements which are incident to the
construction of the Harlem River ship
canal. For several years work has been
going on there and the channel has been
greatly improved. The work is under the
direction ot tbe chief engineer of the
United States army. The project of
making a navigable connection between
the Hudson River took Bhape more than
twenty years ago, a survey of the route
having been made in 1874.
The first appropriation wru made in
1878. and plan* for the work were com
pleted in 1875). Up to July 1 last the total
expenditure on the Harlem shiy> canal
Wae $1,000,000 of the estimated cost of
$2,700,000, but the bridge, which, it is ex
pected, will aid in the development of
Upper Broadway, is not to be paid for
from this lund, but by the city of New
YorK under bond issues authorized by the
Legislature for bridses.
Broadway may not be, technically, a
broadway, but the amount of business
done on it continues to be larger than that
done on any other Btreet in. the United
States, probably. It is one of the duties
of the Board of Aldermen to supervise the
street names, and the attention of its
members libs been invited to Upper Broad

more than bis proper share of tbis worlds' s

to come the scripture gives him only
slight encouragement to hope for
better times. What shall we say to him?
Not much â there is nonod; he talk to

WINE MEN TO MEET.
They Desire to Uphold the Schedule of
the Dingley Bill.
The following address has been issued
to the associated wine industries of Cali
fornia:
Under a general classification of the associ
ated wine industries of California, consisting
of growers, mater* and merchant?, there has
been a petition circulated throughout the
State memorializing our representatives in
: Congress to vote and work for the wine BChed
| ule of the Dingley bill. By its provisions the
i duties on wine are raised from 30 cents a gal
lon on dry wines of 14 degrees alcohol, and 50
: cents a gallon for swoet wines currying 24 de
! grees of spirits, to 60 Cents a gallon on all
I wine*, with a reciprocity clause of 10 cents a
| gallon to such c mntrles "as the President may
i deÂ»m entitled to concessions.
The Senate committee amended this iched
ule alter it had passed the House so as to re-
I tain the old Wilson-Gorman tax of 30 and 50
cents, and unless prompt action is taken it is
likely to become a law. The Associated Wine
Industries have a committee on tariff legisla
tion consisting of Henry W. Crabb, Charles
Bundschu. John Swett, Percy T. Morgan, P. C.
I Rossi, Frederick Jaoobi and Edward Frowen
feld, who have had charge of the petition re
cently forwarded. They have decided to issue
a call for a meeting to take place in the Cham
ber of Commerce, San Francisco, on Friday
morning, June 4, at 11 o'clock, to lake imme
diate action on the proposed Senate amend
ment. Judge John A. Stanly will preside,
and It is the intention to telegraph suitable
resolutions to Washington and perform such
other work as mny be necessary to protect the
$.~><>,ooo,ooo invested in vineyards in Call
loruia.
It is of the utmost Importance that there
should be prompt and vigorous action taiceu,
as tne Senate amendment is not only uuiair to
tbe producers, but is unjust to the whole peo
ple." In the wine districts of France the aver
' age wages paid to labor is from one and a half
to three francs a day, the laborer boarding
himself except his lunch. In California the
price Df labor for the name work is from 75
losl a ( ay and board. In this connection it
Mii.uld Oe remembered that interest on money
in California is from 7 to 10 prr cent per
annum, while in France, Germany and Italy
capital does not command more than 3 or 4
per cent per annum. It should also ba noted
that Germany charges an import duty of $1 95
per case for w! nes brought irito the coumry in
Klass. The duty in Italy is $1 44 a case, w hlle
i France ct>llec:s the same impost on all wines
I above ten and nine-tenths degrees of alcohol
that she doe< on pure spirits.
The proposed schedule discriminates un
justly in isvor of foieign wines es against
foreign whUkies and brandies. The duty of
50 cenisa gallon on sweet wines carrying 24
deg. of alcohol is much less in proportion
thÂ«n the duty on spirits of 50 deg. Proof
spirits pays $2 25 per gallon of 50 deg , which
is more than double the amount charged for
sweet wines of relative decree. It also en
courages adulteration, because ordinary Cali
fornia wines carry about 11% deg. of alcohol.
An importer can eafc.iy bring in wines forti
fied to 24 deg., pay 50 cants a gallon duty oa
it and then "str<.-tch" it into gallons of claret
or ot.ier taole wine*.
Tne contention that a lower rate of duty
will stimulate Importation and increase the
revenue is rot susceptible of proof. Uuder
the McKinley tariff, which imposed the same
duty us the Dingley schedule, the importation
of wines into the United Sta'es \n 1893 was
3,354,078 gallons, while in 1896 under me
Wusun bill, whicn lowered the duty to 30
cents per eallon, the importation was 2,768.
--485 gallons, netting a lons of more than a
Quarter of a million dollars in revenue aud
allowing a de< reuse of a million dollars in the
amount ot wine impor.'id. By order of the
commute, HenkyW. Crabb, Chairman.
Per F. Â£. Wait, Acting Secretary.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
BOY PEDDLERS
WHO ARE SAUCY
Persistently Violate the Or
dinance Passed Last
Year.
They Show Their Contempt by
Tearing Down the Signs
"No Peddlers."
Numerous Complaints Received by the
Police From Residents All Over
the City.
The police have received numerous com
plaints of late from residents in the West
ern Addition and Mission against fruit
and vegetable peddlers, and a vigorous
effort will be made to arrest some of
them and make an example of them.
In July last year the Supervisors were
compelled to pass an ordinance making it
a misdemeanor for peddlers to solicit cus
tom from a house where a sign "No Ped
dlers" was placed in a conspicuous posi
tion. A violation of this ordinance is
punishab.e by a fine not exceedine $100,
with the alternative of six months' im
prisonment.
The ordinance also enacted that each
peddler had to wear a badge with a num
ber on the front of his hat, but this was
repealed in October last year.
The ordinance was passed in view of
complaints against peddlera who annoyed
peop'e by persistently ringing the door
bells and others who made peddling a pre
text for robbing houses when the occu
pants were in the country or temporarily
absent downtown.
Peddlers are now openly violating the
ordinance by ringing the doorbells of
I houses where a sign "No Peddlers'' is con
spicuously displayed, and in numerous
cases have, to show their contempt .or it,
torn away the sign and thrust it under
neath the front door.
When remonstrated with by the ladies
o! the house the peddlers, who are as a
rule boys ranging from 15 to 20 years of
age, hre guiity of the grossest imperti
nence. There are generally from three to
five boys with a wa<;on, and one after the
other will go to the same house ana ring
the bel), although the first was told noth
ing was wanted.
Petty thefts are also reported, and the
police beiieve that some of the boy ped
dlers are responsible for them.
Last summer and fall a large number of
daylight burglaries were committed by
men peddling potatoes and other articles,
and several of them who were captured
are now serving terms in the penitentiary.
MÂ«ny bouses are at present closed, the
occupants being at the summer resorts,
and special precautions are being taken
by the police to prevent a repetition of
the numerous daylight burglaries of last
year.
SOUTH ENDS SUE ACMES.
Demand the Price of a Barge
That Was Burned in
Oakland.
History of the Long Controrersy
Between the Tw. Organizations
Ov r the Boat.
A complaint filed Friday in the Jus
tices' Court by the South End Rowing
Clnb and again-t the Acme A hietic Club
of Oakland has created quite a stir in
athletic circles.
The facts of the case, as related by a
member of tbe South Ends, are substan
tially as follows:
In April, 1895, the Souih End Rowing
Club arranged a regatta on the bay, with
a view of reawakening interest in aquatic
sports, and proposed to some of the lead
ing athletic clubs that they enter crews in
the races, and offered to these clubs the
use of their b athonse and boats. The
Olympic, St. Mary's College and Acme
clubs accepted the proposition.
Tne Olympics and St. Mary's trained
from the boathouse of the South Ends,
but the Acme Club requested the South
Ends to allow them to take a boat to Oak
land so that their crew could train at
home. Accordingly the South Ends de
livered to the Acme Club the four-oared
barge Jamea A. Garfield, with all neces
sary equipments. The Acme Club signed
an agreement to take proper care of the
boat and return it after the races on May
30, 1895, in as good order as it was when
delivered to them. About a month after
the delivery of the boat to the Acme Club
the University boathouse, where the boat
was kept by the Acmes, burned to the
ground and the barge Garfield was totally
destroyed. The then secretary oi the
Acme Club, J. P. Cook, officially in
formed the South End Rowing Club of the
matter and requested that a committee be
appointed to meet a committee from the
Acme Club and place a valuation on the
boat. Tne Acmes rowed in the regatta.
After the races on May 30, 185J5, com
mittees were appointed from both clubs,
but were unable to agree upon a price.'
Other committees were appointed with a
like result. Finally it was agreed to ap
point arbitrators, one from each club, and
the two so appointed, in case of disagree
ment, to choose a third. The decision was
to be final and binding on both clubs.
The Acme Club appointed Henry Tank
and the South Ends Wiiliam Thomas.
They settled upon a price, but the Acme
Club refuted to stand by Tank and the
agreement. Numerous committees have
since been appointed, but their efforts
have been fruitless.
Finally Mr. Allen, the president of the
Acme Club, made the announcement that
tbeAcme Club was not legally responsi
ble and that it would not pay one cent to
the South Ends. He stated that bis club
was not responsible, because the boat was
not borrowed by his club, but by a few
irresponsible members, and that there was
nothing on the minutes of the Acme Club
in relation to the matter.
This refusal led to the action brought
yesterday, which was for $299 and costs.

ARE YOU
PAYING THE PENALTY
FOR VIOLATING
NATURE'S LAWS OF HEALTH?
NATURE'S LAWS ARE AS IMMUTABLE AS
the stars in their courses. A violation of
these laws entails heavy penalties. This, is
particularly true when an attempt is made to
infringe upon those natural laws of health
that experience has taught us we should
strictly observe if we would enjoy perfect
physical and mental heilth, strength and
vigor. Many people are fully conversant with
these general laws of nature and many are
not, but a knowledge or lack of knowledge on
the subject seems to cut but little figure in
preventing the majority of mankind from
burning the candle at both ends. He who fol-
lows 'his rash course must in the end pny the
penalty, for nature is an exacting paymaster
and demands lull compensation for all viola- !
tions of her 'aw*. The most frequent exam- j
pies met with in every day life that illustrate
the futility of attempting to run counter to
nature are those afflicted with that baneful
disease,
NERVOUS DEBILITY. SiStS&
I to an alarming extent in this country, it is
brought on mainly through youthful indis-
cretions, excessive indulgences, mental worry
and anxiety, etc. It unfits its victims for all
business pursuits, for continuous application
to any kind of work and /or social duties. Its
effects are so far-reaching that no pen can fitly
describe the miseries endured by those who
suffer from this dread disease. There are a
multitude of symptoms, that give unerring
notice of the existence of Nervous Debility.
Some of the most pronounced 01 these, symp-
toms are : Weakness of body and. mind, brain
dullness, loss of memory, a wandering mind,
lack of energy and confidence, pains in the
head and back, dimness of vision, discontent,
despondency, an aversion to society, dread of
impending danger, dizziness, etc - Happily,
however, those who are afflicted with this
disease, even in its most azerayated form, are
not without hope. They can be cured. There
is â vt^'.v.
A SHORT AND SURE ROUTE TO
HEALTH AND STRENGTH.
You can find it and take advantage of it by
consulting this eminent specialist, Dr.
Sweany. He can and will restore you to
health. He will, by his treatment, endow
every organ of the body with new life, aad
cause them to perform their. functions prop- I
erly. Mental brightness, manly visor and
muscular strength will return, and you can
then say to all the world, "I am a man," and
there will be no one who can gainsay your
assertion.
DCMCMDCD that in Pacing: yourself
iILmCITI under the care and treat-
ment oi Dr. tiweany you are availing yourself
of the skill and ability of one of the greatest,
most famous and most learned specialists in
the country. He is a physician win se rare at-
tainments have earned for him an enduring
name and fame in the medical world. HE I
HAS FOR TEN YEARS PAST BEEN ENGAGED
IN THE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION IN
THIS CITY. His success is attested by thou-
sands, whose unsolicited written testimonials
tell in eloquent language of cures little less
than miraculous that have been wrought by
this shining light in the medical world
The secret of Dr. Sweany's success is easily
told. His constant study and research have
enabled him to perfect a system of treatment
that is original and effective. Each individual
case Is most carefully diagnosed, and a special
line of treatment for the same is followed.
It is an old and trite saying that "one man's
medicine is another's poison," Â«nd realizing
fully the truth of this, Dr. Sweany has found
from long experience that the only successful
method of treating patients is to prescribe lor
each one separately, according to his or her
needs. It is absurd to assume that any one
remedy will fit all cases, and it is due to the
fact that Dr. Sweany prescribes for each pa-
tient what he knows that his or her case de-
mands that he succeeds in curing where others
fail.
Dr. Sweany' does not confine his practice
to any one branch of the healing art, but treats
with unbounded skill aid success Women's
Diseases, Catarrh, Diseases of the Head,
Throat, Lungs. Heart, Stomacn, Liver and
Bowels ; also â¢ Diseases â of â¢ the â  Kidneys, : Con-

The latchstrine was out at Shell Mound
Park yesterday and the Caledonian Clud
dispensed its usual generous hospitality
to its guests at the thirty-first annual
gathering and games of the clans.
In view of the fact that the entire pro
ceeds, as announced, will be devoted to
the erection in Golden Gate Park o! a
monument to Scotland's bard, Robert
Burns, the officers of the club were inde-

fatigable in their efforts to provide a most â¢
attractive programme of events, and if i
the attendance on the grounds was not so j
large as was confidently expeced it was ;
not their fault. All tilings considered,
however, the attendance was fair, and it J
is safe to say that all those present thor- ;
oughly enjoyed themselves.
Among those present as guests of the
club were Colonel Taylor, Colonel Baker, i
Colonel Eddy, Judge Campbell, Judge j
Low, Justice of the Peace Barry, ex-Judge j
Ferral, Supervisor Morton, Police Lieuten- i
ant Birdsall, Andrew Wilkie, President j
6U Andrew's Society; Hugh Fraser, i
James McNab, John McLaren, William I
Nicol, Colin M. Boyd, Chairman of the j
Burns Monument Committee; J. N. E.
Wilson, J. S. Ore and others, and the fol
lowing delegation from the Caledonian j
Club of Sacramento: Chi f John Carlaw j
and ex-CLneis D. Reid, Tom Scott and !
John Morrison. There were also a num- i
ber of visitors from Stockton, San Jose
and other interior towns.
The games started punctually at 10 j
o'clock m the morning and continued :
without intermission till 6 o'clock in the
evening. The dancing by the laddies and
lassies in Highland costume was one of
the most interesting events, and some o/ i
the little ones put iheirelders in the shade !
oy the grace and charoi of their move- j
mentf. Annie Mclntyre, a charming lit- ]
tie maiden, danced most gracefully, and '"
her sister Jeannie and Maepie Basset
were almost as good. Elaine Telfer and ;
Bibyl Campbsll vrere missed, as there nre
no two better exponents of tha terpsi
eborean art on the coast.
A large number of young couples spent
most of their time in dancinc, the two j
pavilions beine crowded all day. William â 
Mitchell was Hoor manager in the large!
pavilion and George Ding^ail in the
iDOund pavilion.
Too much credit cannot be to ex- !
Chief Aii^a? McLeod, Daniel A. McDon- |
aid and Georee McDonald of the games i

ness to convert it into an eternal bulwark
of American liberty.
The project of the Lincoln Monument
League is conserving this widespread,
deeply rooted plant of country love, which,
without care or direction, might lose itself
in tangled luxuriance or languish in fruit
less neglect. Every one who signs a cer
tificate of membership in the league is
helping on the good work.
Men, women and children of every walk
in life are hastening to aid the movement
which will place a luting statue of Lin
coln in Golden Gate Park. Appended is

TOE STATE DEVELOPMENT.
ActiTe Work Being; Done Abroad by
the Local Committee.
The State Development Committee has
issued a bulletin to its subscribers in which
the work in hand is outlined. The com
mittee has been and is endeavoring to ad
vance tue interests of the State and is pay
ing considerable attention to the dormant
industries. Fiber culture and the mana
facture of fabrics from flax, hemp, cotton
and ramie have been looked into with
I gratifying results. The stereopticon lec
tures in the East and in England showing
the many advantages and natural re
sources of the State are still being carried
on witn success. As a result many letters
are received at the main office, in the Mills
buildinc, for information with a view of
home building and er .ring into business.
As mining ia becoming an important
field Tor development the committee has
undertaken to gather reliable information
through various committeemen in the
mmmc counties and to convey that infor
mation without charge to Eastern and
European cap talists who are in search of
legitimate raining investments. Mr.
Gray has been sent to Chicago to see what
arrangements, if any, can be made to place
there a permanent extiibit of California
products and to establish a bureau of in
iormation with daily slereopticon ex
hibits.
COLLISION CASE.
United States District Jadge Morrow
Decides That Both Vessels Were
to Blame.
United States District Judge Morrow
yesterday filed an opinion in the cases of
B. H. Madison et al., libelants, vs.
steamer Noyo, etc., Noyo Lumber Com
pany claimants, and Noyo Limber Com
pany, libelant, vs. schooner Alice Kim
ball, etc., B. H. Madison et al. claimants.
The first case is that of collision. The
sieamer Noyo on December 3, 1891, col
lided with the schooner Kimball off tne
Navarro River and damaged the schooner
in hull, spars .md rigging.
The second is a cause of salvage grow
ing out of the servicei rendered the
schooner Alice Kimball by the steamer
Noyo in consequence of the disabled con
dition of the ech'.ionor after the collision
mentioned in the tirst cause.
The evidence of witnesses on board the
steamer was to the effect that there was
no lig t of any kind on the schooner
sufficient to warn the lookout on the
steamer of the presence of the schooner.
Judge Morrow says:
I am, therefore, of the opinion that tfte
schooner was not free trom fault In its con
duct immediately preceding the collision. It
appears that the lookout on the steamer was
Dot on the forecastle head, but on deck, and
that he kept his lookout by walking trom one
side of the vessel to another. It may be It he
had been in a proper place for observation
ahead he would have discovered the presence
of the schooner before ho did.
My conclusion is that both vessels are at
fault and that the damages should be divided
between them. A reference wili be had to the
Commissioner to tako testimony as to the
damftge sustained by both vessels. I will
also leave the fixing of the value of the tow
age service rointered by the steamer to the
schooner to the court when tao report of the
Commissioner is received showing the value
of that service-

per cent since the introduction of electric

STATE EQUALIZERS
GIVE A WARNING
City Assessments Must Be
Watched by Super
visors.
An Important Meeting Was
Held at the City Hall
Yesterday.
Several Instances of Erronecm Valua
tions Given b/ State Equalizer
B amer.
The Committee on Assessments of the
Supervisors was given an intimation by
the State Equalizers yesterday that San
Francisco assessments are not high
enough and that a raise greater than last
j year may be expected unless great care is
taken in making up the rolls for the com
ing year.
Equalizers Morebouse, Bearner and
Chesebrougb, Controller Colgan and
Supervisors Devany, Lackman, Dodge
and Clinton were present. Deputy As
sessor Brig^s represented the Assessor's
office.
Mr. Morehouse was asked for sugges
tions as to the best methods to be em
ployed to prevent San Francisco assess
ments from being raised and why the
Equalizers had raised the assessments
last year.
He replied that the only suggestion he
desired to make was that the Supervisors
familiarize themselves with the work of
the Assessor's office and see that assess
ments were based on correct principle.
"We think, 7 ' he said, "that the Super
visors have heretofore been derelict.
They have waited until August and have
then come before us and have asked us
not to raise the roll, but they Knew noth
r ing about the assessments. We think you
should familiarize yourselves with the
work of the Assessor and see that lair
assessments are made. You cannot dic
tate to li i D 3, but you can surest.''
It was explained to the Supervisors that
the Equalizers based a raise, when one
i was made, on individual assessments.
I f*an Francisco had been raised because it
J Â£ as the opinion of tne Equalizers that trie
City was not assessed on an equality with
the rest of the Slate.
Mr, Beamer stated that the City had Jost
the luxes on $1,000,000 in one bank.
"What bank was that?' was asked.
"Tne Hibernia Bank," was the reply.
"That bank gets iuteiest on $1,000,000
| more than it is assessed for. In otner
j words, the loans made by that bank on
property exceed ttie assessed value of the
property by $1,000,000. Yet that bank U
the most conservative bank in tho City."
Mr. Beamer also calied attention to an
in -tar.Cd of what he considered an erron
eous assessment. He stated that the Del
ger block on Sixth an I Market streets was
purchased for $225,000, the buyer con
sidering ihat he nad made a good bargain,
and the Hibernia Bank, a conservatve
institution, had loaned $1 "20, 000 on it. Yet
it had been assessed at only $90,000.
Questions were ask d regaramg the rest
of the State, but Mr. Moreuousa said it
i was not the business of the Supervisors to
figure on the State, but to see mat the
assessments of San Francisco are equable
and just. Jtie warned the committee that
assessments are not high enough, and
that unless the board was given a good
explanation when the time for fixing the
assessment came another raise might re
sult.
The committee said they would be pre
pared if called to Sacramento to be ques
tioned about City as>essments.
Deeded Property to Uis Wife.
Fred J. Kauffinan complains that ilrs. Kath
arina Fauss has properly that ought to be held
subject to his claim for a debt due from her
husbind, Oito Fauss. Kauffmati produces a
note for 5*500 piven in his f*vor by Fauss on
the 3<i ol MÂ»y, 1894. He avers that while so m
oebttd to him Fauss deeded certain real estcte
to his wife, Katharina, tho consideration ex
pressed being '"love and affection." The
plaintiff considers this a fraudulent transac
tion and asks that the deed be set abide.

About fourteen years ago I was taken s ik. he

and said it would end in cancer. .
At limes I would vomit a black and b'.oodv-

The disease would make me very ner\ ou* and
despondent. - At different times- during my ail- 1

then it tvouU come back as bad or worse iban

I could find in the i- ast and nlso-b-eru in Califor-

I was advised to consult I>r. Tom She Bin,,
which 1 did about the Isi of October. 892.
He said my troub c was the cancer of the

hand came at last in the form of my poor wife,
who administered your marvelous remedy,

eai comfortably food prepared in Southern style, and consequently one suffers from it. Ona
day, feeling great discomfort from that ciuse, an old negro retainer said to me : ' Scuse me,
Missey, but my old woman knows something powerfu' good for dem pains. I disremembers
the name, but it just rips the pain out. Old Milly 'ill tell you 'bout it.' To please him I
called on his wife iv their little cabin, and will try and give you her account. ' You know

As the battery of artillery from the Presidio

No dogs will be allowed on the grounds.
No flowers must be picked. They are to be

"Work of the Alanieda County W. C. T.
U. Among the Young.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 29.â The Ala- j
meda County Women's Christian Ter- >
perance Union has taken up the matter of !
the unemployed and the Sabbath closing !
movement. At their annual convention '
they adopted the following:
Resolved, That the proper observance of the I
Christian Sabbath is essential to ths best in
terests of the individual, the home ana the
community. Therefore we will do all iv our
power 10 stop me present fearful tide of Sab- j
bath desecration which threatens the destruc- j
tion of the commonwealth, and to this end we !
will work for a State sabbath law and for tne !
closing of all saloons in Aiameda County on
itif Lord's day.
/ Resolved, That the members of the Woman's I
/ Cnrlstiau Temperance Union sympathize
| deeply with the large numbers of worthy men
V out of employment, and we would respectfully
â  'ill the attention of the municipal authorities i
10 the same, to the end thai if possible some i
method may be devised to permanently j
edy this great evil.
Resolved, That the defeat of the constitutional '
suffrage amendment has aroused us to a greater
comprehension of the extreme need of woman
suffrage to elevate the morals of our State as
well as a simple matter of justice to the women â 
of the eommun wealth. â  â¢ â  â¢
Inasmuch as our youth are accustomed to
congregate on vacant grounds for the purpose
of ball-playing, and, inasmuch ss the use of
bad language, the drinking of beer and gam
bling have become prevalent at such ball
games,
Resolved, That the Alameda County Woman's
Christian Temperance Union deprecates such
bad habits where only innocent pleasure
should prevail, and that we recommend our
superintendent oi juvenile work to use such
means as are found best to eradicate the evils.
Resolved, As it comes to the knowledge of
the Woman's Christian Temperance Union
that boys of the age of 12 years and upward
are freque ting billiard saloons at the
same time that older men are there smoking
and gambling, and inasmuch as these billiard
rooms are generally next door to a saloon, and
thuÂ» become the kindergarten of the saloon, |
we urge upon parents the necessity of knowing i
where their boys are after 6 o'clock in the I
evening. -i J
Resolved, As neither the Christian Union nor
any Christian organization may give coun
tenance to any disreputable or uuholy busi
ness, therefore we, the members of the Ala
meda Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
do molt earnestly protest against any liquor
dealer of Oakland having any place on any
committee of arrangements for entertaininz
the National Christian Endeavor Society ex .
pected to visit our city in July next. To nave
any liquor-dealer on such a committee will
bring reproach upon Christianity as well as
upon the great Christian Endeavor Society
composed ot the best . young people of the
Nation. Â-,â 
Resolved, That the thanks of- the convention
aie mo<t heartily tendered to the East Oak
. land Union for their generous entertainment
i and also those ladies an 1 gentlemen who as
-1 r.sted to make the medal contest interesting
I Â»nd special thanks for the excellent music

Deputy Constable Gronin is so near the
end of his life that the pnysicians to-day
pronounced that he could not hve more
than twenty- full r nours. \Vh9n this de
cision was arrived at, Deputy District At
torney Church and his stenographer vis
ited the dying man to take his ante
ruortem Â«tatement.
Early this morning Cronin suddenly be
came much worse. It was believed he was
dying and his relatives were summoned.
Cronin himself expressed the belief that
he cannot possibly recover and then
slowly told the circumstances surround
ing the shooting.
His story is just the same as that al
ready printed, and the District Attorney
declined to give it out for publication un
less Cronin dies. Hia wile and sister-in
law are his constant attendants, but they
are with the physician unable to relieve
j the Â£;reat pain in the reelon of the wound.
; His spinal cord is so badly injured that
I he has absolutely no control of his body.
I During to-day be has remained in a semi
conscious state only capable of conversing
at intervals.
James Bryan, the boy who did the
shooting, no'wiealizes the seriousness of
I his crime. He has had time to become
thoroughly sober and be sullenly refuses J
to see any one or say a word about the i
affair. His companion, McGinnis, who, it
is alleged, is partially responsible for en
couraging him to shoot, also maintains
complete silence.

ALAMEDA, Cal., May 29.â There was
a good attendance at the new circular
speed track of the Alameda Driving Asso
ciation this afternoon for the tirft meet
this season. There was a stiff breeze
blowing, which was something of a draw-
Lack for last tim^ as well as for the spec
tators. There were three events on the
programme, one of which, however, was
called off. The first race was trot tine,

Tunnel Proposition Abandoned.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 29.â Much re
gret is feit by the people of Aiameda over
the final outcome of the proposition to
construct a tunnel under the estuary.
They bad hoped that some way might be
foun i by which i: would be possible to
have such a great improvement over the
present method of crossing the stream,
but it seems that there is no way out of it
unless the cities of Alameda and Oakland
I shall join in such work. Many are in
favor of doing this, and others desire to
wait until the next, session of the Legisla
ture, when they propose to endeavor to
have a special act passed empowering
counties to construct tunnels, as well as
bridges, wherever needed.
MEMOEIAL DAY.
No Ceremonies to Be Held in Alnmeda
Appropriate to the Occasion.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 29.-Beyond the
general observance of Memorial day as a
holiday in this city there will be nothing
of a public character to signalize the oc
| currence. Owing to the destruction of
; Linderman's Opera-house and the absence
j of a hall large enough to accommodate
the audiences which have in the past at
tended such events, there will be no exer
cises. The National Guard and the Grand
Army post will participate in the celebra
tion in Oakland and in the decoration of
graves in Mountain View cemetery.

SUIT TO RECOVER
A LIGHT PLANT
NickeHn-the-Slot Gas Me
ters Bankrupt the
Company.
San Leandro May Try Again
to Vote Bonds for a Munic
ipal Plant.
Gas Stock Is Causing Some Trouble
in the Little Towa Across
th? Eridge.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 BroHdway, May "29. f
The San Leandro Gas Company has
brought suit against H. W. Williams, H.
D. Tassell et a!., for the purpose of obtain
ing from them the control of the ban Le
andro Gas Works.
According to the complaint, W. J.
Landers was sole owner of the gas works
prior to August of last year. At that time
an agreement was made between the
plaintiff and defendant to dispose of the
stock to the defendant for $12,000, to be
paii within four years. The new owners
were to put in a new system lor distribut
ing the gas within ninety days, and while
the purchase price was being paid interest
on the whole amount was to be collected
monthly.
Three weeks ago the new owners could
not pay their bills, and the place was put
I in charge of a constable, and the monthly
interest was not forthcoming. The origi
nal owner now declares that the new hrm
is insolvent and tno contract is broken,
cna fearing damage suit*, ho has operated
! the plant himseif for some time.
The secret of this trouble is the failure
of an invention to distribute gas on the
principle of a nickel-in-the-slot machine.
j Some months ago an Oakland brass
[ worker invented a gas meter which would
j emit a quantity of gas equal in value to
j a coin placed in the slot. A number of
I these machines were made, and the San
! Leandro gas plant was the first and only
! one to give them a practical test. While
the invention was very clever as it ap-
p eared on paper, it soon beean to provs a
: failure when put into practice. The ma
| chines couid be tampered with, and there
; were complaints that th y did not pro
duce as much illuminating medium as
was paid for, and, of course, alter ttie gas
was burned it was impossible to settle
! such disputes, anil the gas company grad
ually lost its patronage.
To make matieis more insecure the
town also voted to establish a municipal
i electric-lizht plant. Owing to a techni-
I cality in the p : oceedings, the election call
i ing for the issue of bonds was declared il
! legal and the matter was dropped tempor
i aruy. It is possible, however, that an at
| tempt to establish a municipal light
: plant may be taken up at any time, and
; as a result the value of gas stock at San
i Leandro is not thereby enhanced.

CALLS A NEW PASTOR.
Rev. Glen McWilliams to Preside
at the First Christian
Church
The Cornerstcne of the Njw St John's
to B-- Lai3 With Ceremony
Next Wedn?sday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 29. f
Rev. Glen McWiiliams has accepted the
call to the F/rst Christian Church. This
action finally disposes of all efforts that,
have been made toward bringing about a
union of the two Christian churches in
this ci:y.
The first Church is now without a
building of its own, but the fund realized
from the sale of its property will enable
both congregations to erect a first-class
modern church in a more convenient por
tion of town tnan the old building. They
are at present worshiping in the Y. M.
C. A. auditorium and have been without
a regular pastor for a couple of months.
Key. Glen McWilliams was called a f^w !
weeks Bgo to preacn on approbation and
has given such general satisfaction that
he has been offered and has accepted a
1 permanent call.
After vacating their old building the at
tempt was maae to unite the Central and
First Christian churches. The Central
Church has for its pastor Rev. Edwards
DaviÂ», and it was from that church that
the overtures toward consolidation came.
It was first proposed before Rev. James
Small resigned from the First Church.
The plan then was that both pastors
should resign, and a joint meeting of the
two congregations should elect another !
pastor to preside over the united body.
This was not favorable to Mr. Davis, who
dd not. consider it advisable to resign,
and Key. James Small left the pastoral
field to taKe up evangelical work.
Invitations have b> en issued by the offi- '
cial board of St. John's Epi-copal Church j
for the laying of the cornerstone of the!
now building at Eighth and Grove streets i
next Wednesday afternoon. "Walter
Matthews '.as been appointed to take
cnarge of the work, and he has prepared
plans of a typical English parish church.
The building will be 100 feet square, and i
will have seating capaci y for 400. It wiil
cost, exclusive of all Â«he furnishing*. '
$10,000, and the pians are so arranged that
if the fund will not permit of building a
tower at present, it can be added after
ward without difficulty.

The "fete champetre" at Arbor Villa,
the beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. F. M.
Smith, this afternoon proved to be the
most successful affair Riven in Oakland for
many months. The directors of the Cen
tral Free Kindergarten have been richly re
paid for all their trouble and will have a
snug sum with which to cary on their
work.
The prounds were at their best when the
visitors arrived, about 2 o'clock. From
that hour until 5 the stream of pleasure
seekers was never still.
Society was well represented, the Lake
side and Jackson-street set being iv evi
dence everywhere. An orchestra sta
tioned directly in front of the house en
livened the proceedings ail the nf>ernoon.
At 5 o'clock came tae first event, it
being a game of 'skipping the rope."
This was participated in by twenty misses
who had been drilled for the >'ast two
weeks by Mrs. F. M. Smith and Miss Ellis.

double quartet, was well enjoyed and
compelled to respond to an encore. The
Bingers were Messrs. Sanborn, Chestnut,
Burbeick, Merideth, Benham, Trefeiher,
Collins and Mayor Tnomas. Their song
was entitled "Louisiana,"' arranged by
Martin Schultz. It was a Southern mcl-
ody.
The event of the day, and the one all
looked forward to with great expecta
tions, was the "battaille de fl?urs." Nor
were the most exacting disappointed.
Just at 5 o'clock, as every one had gath
ered in front of the beautiful mansion,
with the descending sun casting an amber
snade upon everything, a troupe of
daintily dressed young ladies appeared
upon the porticos and the fun began.
Huge bassets of cut flowers had been
placed in front on the ground, while the
porticos were full of them. Faster and
faster flew the flowers. One after another
the older ones were drawn into the battle,
until at the close nearly every one on the
ground was bombarding the house or
ms neighbor.
Among the business men hard at work
were: Mayor Tnomas, A. M. Ben ham, W.
H. Friend, A. A. Pennoyer, Dr. Edward?,

harder clay's work. Mrs. J. H. T. Wat
kinson was in charge of tha "Lilac
House," where tea was servei to all
comers free. Mr.Â«. M. Hoadley, under v

try, which was greatly enjoyed by the
younger set. Miss El a Sterrett did a
good business selling fl >wers. Mrs. Stolp,
Mrs. Wheaton, Mrs. Gorrill and Miss Kit
tridge took turns attending the gates.

PIEE DEPABTMENT SCANDAL
Mayor Thomas Says It la Neoesiary to
Settln the Matter at Once.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 29.â The trouble
between Assistant Fire Cbief Murdock
and Jack Rohan, foreman of Hose Com
pany No. 1, will be ventilated in the Po
lice Court Tuesday morning, when Mur
dock will plead to a charge of battery.
The two men were at their work to-day,
and Murdock stated that he would file
charges against Rohan of oeine guilty of
conduct detrimental to the welfare of the
department. The misconduct alleged
consisted of circulating the affidavit of
Harry Lawson, a convict, attacking Mur
dock's character.
Hohan says he does not intend to file
charges against Murdock. Three years
ago be Joined MurdocK $100, and the as
sistant chief avoided him alterward and
only paid it back by degrees.
Murdock declares that he has bad
nothing to do with Lawson and denies
I that he furnished him with money at sev
eral times, a* claimed in the affidavit. He
says the trouble with Rohan began at St.
Mary's College fire, two years ago.
Mayor Thomas stated to-day that he
thought it should be settled whether or
not a new man was to become fire chief.
The matter would have to be disposed of
before discipline could be restored in the
department.
OLEOAK WANTS REDSESS.
Suit Against thÂ« License Inspector for
Criminal Libel.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 29.â John J.
CJecak, the West Oakland restaurant man,
has sworn >o a complaint charging License
Inspector Maloon with criminal libel.
The charge is based upon an article which
appeared in a morning newspaper over
Maloon's signature.
One of the charges is as follows:
"If the fathers and mothers of this city
knew haif the deviltry, corruption and
vice which are going on in the side rooms
of your all-night restaurants, such a pro
teat would go up to the Council of tr.is
city that an ordinance would be passed In
compel you to close at midnight, for more
youn.' men and women are ruined in such
places kept by you than in all saloons of
this city combined."
Clecan will have great difficulty in dis
proving the statements of Maloon, for
they bear % marked resemblanre to state
ments made by the Chief of Police and
other officials.

Cleric this morning for a marriage license,
but did not receive it. While the deputy
was filling out the blank the woman con

band from whom she has never been
divorced.
A little inquiry revealed the fact that
she was married in 1892, and about a year
later her husband deserted her, going to
sea. Tbe Clerk refused the license, which
made the eroom very ancry. He declared
that he would fix the divorce business in
short order, and said it was an outrage
that he shouid not be permitted to marry
the woman right away.

strange Phenomenon of a Large Num
ber of Counterfeit Capita
Prize Tickets.
A death blow has been given to the sale

lous individuals who have grown rich out

" little" lottery schemes openly and un-
One of the Fifty Capital-Prize Tickets in the Original Little Beneficencia Pufelica Company Declared
to Be a Counterfeit and on Which Payment Was Refused Yesterday.
molested by the police, will be oblieed to
resort to honest labor, or to live on the
interest of the money which they have j
plucked from their gullible victims.
Early yesterday morning, as soon as the
office was opened, a man entered the lot
tery shop of Henry S. Cahn & Co., room
olTof the Safe Deposit and Trust Com
pany's building at 328 Montgomery street,
and presented ticket No. 12613 o' the
Original Little Beneficencia Publica Com
pany of San Francisco, which number
was advertised as having won $3750.
The drawing took place in the City of
Mexico last Thursday in the Beneficencia
PuDlica Lottery. The Little Lottery of
San Francisco prints us own tickets and
advertises to pay prizes on the result of
the drawings in the Mexican lottery.
The "lucky" holder of the ticket, who
had sat up all night speculating with his
wife bb to what they were going to do with j
tne $3750 when they got it, took the "pre- !
dous" ticket carefully out of his pocket
and laid it on the counter. The affable
cashier of the lottery company remarked:
"That's counterfeit."
The next moment he stamped across
i he back of the ticket with a red rubber
stamp the word, "Counterfeit."
The poor fellow, who seemed to be a
hard-working mechanic and who had j
bought the ticket in good faith, ventured i
to ask why was it counterfeit, and the af- j
fable cashier explained that the paper .
wasn't good enough; the ink wasn't black I
enough; the private number in the leit- j
hand end was not correct and thstthel
watermark was missing. While he wa-t
speaking two more men came up, each
with a ticket bearing the same winning
number, ana these were also stamped
"counterfeit"
A Call reporter asked the cashier why
' was that so many winning tickets were
.itlnat. all of them having been purchased
i l's cents each by the unsuspecting vic
i rns.
The cashier replied that already fifty
'counterfeit" lottery tickets bearing the
number 12,613 had Seen presented, and he
lud no douot that many more would be
brought in during the day.
But the fact that so many "counterfeit'
tickets were afloat did not seem to dis
tress him a bit. On the contrary, he
seemed to take pleasure in relating that
after the drawing of May 8 of this year
the lottery firm of Metzger & Franklin
were presented with 500 Little Louisiana
lottery tickets, each bearing the number
3">,f>l3, which won the capital prize of
$3750.
The most extraordinary thing about
thÂ«se admissions is that so many counter
feit tickets of the winning number should
have been printed. The cashier said that
the counterfeiter was in the habit of print
ing a large quantity of tickets with the
same number on each in order to save
trouble and expense in the printing. If
this statement be true the chances for tne
counterfeit tickets to fit the winning num
ber of the capital prize are immeasurably
small. Yet within the space of nineteen
days the counterfeiter ha.-* succeeded in
guessing the number of the capital prizes
in two drawings. There appears to be
more of method than madness in thi.s ex
traordinary run of luck in a range of so
few numbers as are indicated by the state
ment of the cashier, who do-s not seem to
be breaking his heart over the ex.steuce of
the counterfei ers.
He said that the genuine 12613 was sold
to an agent in San Diego, and that when
it shall arrive here ihe difference between
it and the "counterfeit" will be apparent
to the most verdant sucker.

RECOMMEND ASPHALT.
Roofers Will Make a right, to Keep the
Fire Ordinnnce as It
Now IÂ§.
The amendment to the fire ordinance
proposed by Supervisor Britt and to be
recommended for adoption by the Fire
Department Committee will meet with
sturdy opposition when it comes up before
the board on Monday for nassaee to print.
The asphaltum roofers of this City claim
that the proposed chanrres will work a
great hardship to them and have prepared
n petition, sijrnea by many of tht lar.est
firms ami corporations of the City, lor
presentation to the board.
The petition recites that asphalt com
position roofs have proved durable and
acceptable to the sieners, that they have
not been unacceptable to tbe insurance
companies, and that to place them under
'he restrictions proposed will be detri
mental to th" public interest.
The petitioners protest against the pro
posed change, and the asphaltum men
will appear before the board on Monday
ana make a right for tneir interests.
DIFfERENCE IN BURGLARY.
Judge Cook Makes a Distinction in
Matter* of Punishment.
Judge Carroll Cook some time ago an
nounced that he made a distinction be
tween burglary cases; that he was not
disposed to be so severe on persons con
victed of entering stores or other unoccu
pied building as he would be if the crime
were committed by entering private resi
dences where familes were living, thus
jeopardizing buman life.
following this theory he yesterday sen
tenced Joseph Mahi to serve six months
in rhe State Prison at Folsom for burglar
izing the warehouse of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company on the sth of last
April.
James J. Fleming, who burcHriously
entereJ the store of J. St. Denis & Co., at
308 Sutter street, was also dealt with leni
ently. He was condemned to a sojourn
of one year at the San Quentin Slate
Prison. '
ARTISTS ARE AT WORK.

Strone.
Monterey Twilight Eff cts Trans
ferred to C-.nvas by Charles
Ro lo Pet-rs.
Charles Rollo Peters came up from
Monterey yesterdsv and will loiter in San
Francisco several days. During the past
year he has painted beach scenes at Mon
terey and twilight effects. He sent sev-
I eral pictures to London, where purchasers
i were found.
Joseph D. Strong has just finished
I portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Clift of Oakland.
i It is remarked among artists that Strong
Jis doing excellent work. A portrait of
Robert Louis Stevenson painted for trie
Bohemian Club is highly praised as a
work of exceptional merit. There is on
exhibition at Vickery's a pastel by Strong.
The subject is Miss D. Cool, daughter of
Dr. Cool. The picture Is greatly admired.
Fred Yates' portrait ot C. P. Hunting
ton is at Vickery's. The picture of the
firm and rugged railroad man is true to
life. Yates did some moritorius work In
painting General L. H. Foote, William
Greer Harrison, Irving M. Scott, Henry
Marshall and General Barnes, but the
Huntington picture represents his best
work in this country.
Lizzie Strong recently went from Mvn
i terey to Fresno and is duing some work in
painting animals and making landscape
sketches.
Henry Raschen is painting tishes for
the United States Government and look
ing after the interests of the art depart
ment of the next Mechanics' Institute
fair.
A view of the bay from Sausalito, a land
scape and marine, by H. Bloomer, is ex
hibited at Morris & Kennedy's. It is a
good picture.
Thomas Hill has not done a great deal
of work since the light stroke of paralysis
which he sustained last year.
He fancies that the air of the mountains
reinvigorates everything, hence another
summer at Wawona may make him as
good as new. Mr. Hill's painting called
"Sunset in the Foothills" is on exhibition
at the Bohemian Club. It represents a
group of cattle emerging from a mass of
: foliage. Artists speak highly of the pic
ture and particularly admire tiie color..
Alfred Oiis Larkin visiied Monterey a
I short time ago, and had his portrait
| painted in the house which his father
j built. In the room where he was born he

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
SHE MADE THEM
PERFORM PENANCE
Lillian Ashley's Audience
Suffers From
Ennui.
They Listen for Nearly Three
Hours to "a HDst of
Volunteers."
S mi Liviig Pictures of What Was
and What May Yet Be in the
Near Future.
The handful of peopleâ principally
menâ who went to the Auditorium last
night to see Emma Ashley's sensational
tableaus paid dearly for the privilege. It
was not in coin of the realm that they
paid so much as in three dreary hours of
waiting for the fair Emma's living pic
tures, during which Carrie CiarKe Ward
and a company described on the bills as
"A Host of volunteers" waded through
the four acts of "Kittie O'Connor."
When people act as "volunteers" it is
usual to treat their efforts tenderly â "lift
them with care," so to speakâ as if they
were fragile glas3 or china, so on that ac
count it is better to draw a veil over the
efforts of the â¢â¢volunteers." They meant
well, and some of them knew their lines.
Miss Kate McCarthy danced prettily, and
her palpable youth maiie her seem like an
oasis in a desert.
Carrie Clarke Ward's impersonation of
Kittie O'Connor is fairly known to the
older generation of California and little
more need bo said of it, except that last
n ight was "too late a day" for her to play
such a part.
Emma Ashley appeared in " Kittie
j O'Connor" as the haughty Dorothy Kavn-
J nagh. Miss Ashley veiled her identity,
however, under the norn de guerre of
'Miss Lucille Ulnier Thorndike," and rÂ»
i great many people did not know that the
j star performer of the eveninz was before
I them when the massive Miss Ashley
sailed in with a haughty degage walk,
which was meant to express pride and
loftiness of spirit. If Miss Ashley ever
striKes out a new path to fume for her
self on the stace it will be with that
J walk â it is as original and surprise-inspir
| fng as Cis?y's wink, but it not so likely to
J appeal to the chappies.
Emma Ashley was letter perfect, though
j beyond the haughty walk* and the con
sumption of six cups of tea she had
not a very arduous ro> to perform. After
the first r.ct Dorothy Kavanagh drops out
' of the play, and in dull, patient resigna
tion the all lience settled down to endure
ihe rest, cheered by the prospect of the
living pictures to come.
About 11 o'clock "Kittie O'Connor"
came to an end, the band played several
choice selections and then a portion of
| the drop at the back of the stage became
transparent and tableau No. 1, "Devo
tion," was revealed. It represented
"Lucky" Baldwin, somewhat younger and
fairer than in real life, kneeling in an at
titude of polite devotion at the feet of
Emma Ashley, who coyly extended a lily
white hand, which "Lucky" Dent forward
to kiss. There was nothing Don Juan
like about this picture ; it rather suggested
an animated woodcut from that pleasing
little manual, "The Complete Etiquette o.
j Courtship."
The next picture, entitled "Not One
Cent," showed "Lucky," a little more life
like than in number 1, sternly repulsing
the child and Emma Ashley, Doth ol
whom knelt pitifully to him, clothed in
rags. In the third tableau, "She Shall
Inherit My Millions," "Lucky" had un
dergone a change of heart; he was holding
out money to the child and Miss Ashley,
who were both resplendent in smiles and
tine apnarel. This picture was frantically
applauded.
The last scene of all, which ends this
i strange, eventtul history was culled "The
I Stage." "I am only Iza Clemenceau
! now." Miss Ashlev appeared in a cos
tume somewhat resembling that of the
Venus de Milo, but truth compels one to
add that the resemblance ended there.
BOGUS BRANDY.
Wine-3lakers* Corporation Expresses
Itself on the Subject.
The following resolution was unani
mously passed by the board of directors
of the California Wine-maKers' Corpora
tion at their meeting held on Friday, May
28 last:
Whereas, A large quantity of bogus brandy
was recently shipped from this City to Lon
don which was originally marked "California
Pure Grape Brandy," but in reality contained
only about 10 per c.-nt of California grape
brandy, the balance buing composed of corn
spiritÃ from Nebraska, water, glucose nnd
otUi;r compounds; nnd,
Wiii-.keas, If such bogus compounds are per
mitted to be sont throughout the world and
sold a* California brandy, it is certain to rum
not only our brandy industry, but the wine
and other industries of CalHorma alike; there
fore be it
L'esolvfd, That we unqualifiedly condemn
the adulteration and sophistication of brandy
or wine in this State.
Resolved, That wo strongly condemn the ac
tion of (he Collector of the Port, John H. Wise,
for having rushed through and caused to be
sent F.ast the bogus brandy above referred to
without giving the authorities of this City an
opportunity to confiscate the same and stop
its shipment; be It further
Resolved, That the thanks of this corpora
tion be tendered to Colonel John P. Irish,
Naval Officer; Colonel J. J. Tobln. thu Board
of Health of San Francisco, the Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association and Chief
Food Inspector Jdmes P. Dockery for their
laudable effort* made to itop the bogus brandy
from being shipped from this City, and that
we pledge our hearty support to all persons
who will assist in preserving the good name
of the products and manufactures of the Stale
of California.

KINGS COUNTY WINS.
It Will Not Have to Par Any Propor
tion of Tulare's Bonded
I>ebt.
A case of some im portance, bearing upon
the relations sustained by the parts of a
divided county to each other, was decided
by the Supreme Court yesterday. It in
volved the controversy between Tulare
and Kings counties, and the decision of the
lower court was affirmed.
The action was one brought by Tulaie
County against Kings to enforce a claim
for a proportion of the bonded debt of
plaintiff. By an act ot the Legislature of
1893 Kings County was created out of Tu
lare. At that lime ttiere was an indebted
ness of $22,000 in courthouse bonds and
$5000 in road bonds.
Tulare presented a claim for $5049 61, as
the proportionate share of Kings in these
bonds. The Supervisors of the latter re
fused to audit the demands, whereupon
suit was brought, resulting in favor of the
new county. The Supreme Court aftirms
this judgment, remarking that while sec
tion 3 of article XI of the constitution
provides that a new county shall pay its
proportionate share of the bonded indebt
edness of the old county, it does not pro
v de the machinery for the collection of
that assessment.
The act of 1893 creating Kings County
d id not provide a way to collect the same,
nor is the intention of the Legislature
shown to be that there should be any col
lection levied on Kings County.
The court remarks that the courthouse
lor which the bonds w;"re issued remains
in Tulare County, and there is no evidence
to show that any money of the road bonds
was ever spent in King:.* County.
YESTERDAY'S INSOLVENCIES.
Bankrupts Who Have Confessed Their
Financial Difficulties.
Three business men tiled their confes
sions of failure in the County Clerk's
office yesterday.
Frank H. Fowler and Guilford H. Lewis,
merchant tailors, say they are unable
to pay their debts. They owe $780 59
and have assets nominally worth $1503 15.
These are composed of $143 65 bills col
lectible and a note by Dr. C. H. Walker
for $1354 50. Fowler has individual debts
amounting to $116 50.
William T. Cottier, a dealer in ventila
tors, is also bankrupt. His liabilities ex
tend over a large area, the principal cred
itor being his divorced wife, Emily M.
Cottier, wno holds a claim ot $1550 against
him for unpaid alimony.
Dr. H. S. Orme of Los Angeles trusted
him $150 for medical services; Mrs. M. A.
McKenney, Central City, lowa, $250 for
nursing and borrowed money; William
Cronau and S. E. Coffman, $100 each for
money advanced in divorce litigation.
Cottier has no available assets.
Determined to Die.
Early this morning one of the cterks of the
Ahlborn House detected the odor ot gas on the
third floor, and found that the suffocating
fluid came from the room of. A. Raver, a
blacksmith.
The door was forced open ana Raver was
discovered hanging by the neck and uncon
scious. He was cut down aua sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital.
The rash man had made a desperate at
tempt at suicide. He had cut his throat,
slushed his wrists, turned on the gas and
hanged himself with a smail piece ot rope.
He was not expected to live at ;ast accounts.

"THE DAY OF THE DEAD"
To Be Celebrated by the Uuveil
ing of a Beautiful Monu
ment
The Presidio National C metory Will
Bs the Scene of Appropriate
Ceremo lies
Decoration day, 1897, will become a his
toric date in the archives of the Pacific
Const garrisons of the Republican Array
and Navy Union. On that date the united
garrisons will unveil and dedicate a beau
tiful monument to the memory of their
departed comrades.
The idea of erecting a monument, was
first started in 1894, when Garrisons Nos.
100, 101 and 114 gave a general military
tournament.
The parties conspicuous in this under
taking were General William M. Graham
and Colonel S. P. M. Young, United States
army, and Henry J. Crocker, also Ser
geants B. Follinsby and Younp: of Light
Batiery F and First Sereeant E. P. Grimes
of Battery B, Fifth Artillery.
The tournament proved a financial suc
cess, as the sum oi $1300 was raised, in
cluding $1000 donated by the Hon. H. J.
Crocker.
About last July a committee of which
Fost Commander F. Fitzgerald was chair
man, was appointed for the purpose of
raising subscriptions, ?\nd through their
efforts and the generosity of the citizens
of the City of San Francisco and by dona
tions of the various garrisons on the Pa
cific Coast, sufficient funds were raised to
meet the entire expenses of the beautiful
monument.
This monument is cast of white bronze,
and was built through the agency of
James Linforth by the Monumental
Bronze Company of Bridgeport, Conn.
The design of this beautiful monument is
original and cannot be duplicated in the
United States. The base of this monu
ment is 7 feet square and it stands 18 feet in
height.
The dedicatory services will be held at
the Presidio National Cemetery to-mor
row.
The order of exercises will be as follows :
Opening prayer by the Rev. J. H.
Macomber, chaplain, United Suites army.
Reception of the monument by General
William EL Shatter, D. S. A., command

The Colorado Crank Writes
Another Letter to
Mrs. Martin.
Rev. J. George Gibson Wonders
What Mrs. John Will Say
About Him.
The Prisoner Is Cnrtailed of Som.
Libertiesâ The Governor Will
Decide by To-Morrow.
Rev. J. George Gibson and Secretary
Lynch passed a quiet day yesterday, issu
ing no bulletins, admitting no cranks and
reading no anonymous letters. Tlieir
chief worry was, bo they said, concerning
the things that may yet be said deroga
tory to Mr. Gibson.
Secretary Lynch had heard reports that
Mrs. John Martin intends to lampoon the
pastor in straight Anglo-Saxon at her
Metropolitan Temple lecture on Friday
night. He said he hoped that the lady's
language would be temperate, as he de
sired no trouble, which would certainly
occur should the speaker utter slanders.
Mrs. Martin is busy ion her lectnre /or
Friday night and is hopeful that she will
yet save Durrant's life. She received an
other letter from vV. F. Bryan, the Colo
rado crar.g, yesterday. It is dated May
25, and runs in part as follows:
Dear Madam: Send me aP. O. money order
at once and I wiil ba in San Francisco in time
to treat with you aud others in this matter.
If you've not confidence to do this much, see
Miss Hester Hicks or Miss Henrietta Rigsby,
for I cannot get to San Francisco. 1 am sure
the police will not send for me.
The papers in Denver have put in ten times
more than I wrote to you, and this wilL do the
case no good. The only way that's leJt is my
presence in San Francisco, and $45 is all that
is required. Please answer at once. Respect
fully. W. F. Bbyan.
P. S.â lt would be more than useless tor me
to make a statement to you. They call me a
crank here, but they do me a wrong.
, W. F. B.
It is now the general opinion that
Bryan is either insane or an impostor.
Mrs. Martin will pay no further attention
to his ravings.
Theodore Dnrrant received no visitors
yesteraay. He was not allowed the free
dom of the yard, nor will ha be exercised
to-morrow. For seventy-two hours con
tinuously he will be compelled to remain
in his cell. To-day his father will visit
him, and he will then leara that Governor
Budd will do nothing until Monday.
The painters nave been at work this
week preparing the death chamber for the
reception of the next visitor, who will be
Durrant, if the Governor does nothing to
prevent.
Durrant's cell is directly under the
tanks where the unruly convicts are quar
tered, and during the night he is com
pelled to listen to their howls and noise.
The Governor has announced ihat he
will render his decision in the Durrant
and Worden cases at the same time â to
day or to-morrow. He said yesterday
that be was too tired to prepare his Jdeci
sion. He will make a pretty full state
ment of his reasons.
No intimation is given as to what the
Governor's action will be, but there exists
no doubt in the minds of officials in other
State departments and among those pol
iticians who are closest and who "know,"
or claim to, that he wiil refuse lo inter
fere, and It is thought that the statement
now being prepared is to justify his action
with political friends of the parties who
are fignting to save Durrant'* life.
THOSE EXPLOSIVE MATCHES.
Miss McQuaide, the Teacher, Gives Her
Version of tho Affair.
Miss Catherine G. McQuaide, the teacher
of the eighth grade in the Washington
Grammar Night School, on Mason and
Washington streets, and Miss Nolan, the
principal, are endeavoring to ascertain
who among the pupils placed the bends
of parlor matches on the classroom floor
last Thursday. While the offense of it
self was not and is not regarded as being
very serious still it was a decided breach
of discipline that it will not do to tolerate.
Miss McQuade's pupils are good-sized
youngsters â in fact, almost men â their
ages being from 17 to 19. In her eight
years' experience as a teacher in that
night school that was the first annoyance
-In 1 had ever had. In speaking of the oc
currence the l?Â»dy said:
â¢â¢It was not so very serious. Some of
the boys threw or dropped some ex plosive
parlor matches on the floor and wnen the
heads wee stepped npon the matches
made explosions. I had one boy gather
up all that could be found, and then I
questioned tiie class, but none would ac
knowledge having committed tho offense.
There are a large number of pupils in the
room who I know had nothing to do with
the matches, but there arg about fourteen
on the sus: ected list.
"I gave these boys until next Tuesday
to talk tue matter over among
themselves, and have the culprit
come forward so as to exonerate
the others who are under suspicion. If

and dimes. At 2 o'clock in the aiternoon
payment, was suspended until 5 o'clock,
until sufficient deposits on money orders
had been made to pay off the remainder.
This peculiar episode was due to the
fact that the late Postmaster McCorpin

P. ROSS OS' HrXtLTT, M. Â».,
:* S M KMrnj Street, Nan Franriico. CÂ»I."S ban 1-rancisco there are
three peaceful spots
where our dead soldiers
are buried. The Na
tion's Cemetery at the
Presidio has one portion,
called the ex- veterans'
plat, in which only those
who fougnt in the late
Imon can De laid. The Odd Fellows'
letery also has a G. A. R. plat in
:h some sixty old soldiers are resting.
Besides these two there is a Grand Army
Cemetery â a portion of the City Ceme
teryâin which only the Grand Army
comrades are buried.
It is a strange experience to view these
places just before the National holiday,
when the friends of the deceased visit the
graves of their beloved, removing all that
does not look beautiiul and leaving tears
and loving thoughts to hover about the
tombstone in their absence. Up on the
high hills near to the Presidio, where the
winds can sigh at will and wander unmo
lested through the dark cypress trees and
then sweep out to sea again, to whisper
to the white-capped waves the story of
man's mortality, is one silent city. Its
white spires gleam in the sunshine and
the dark, even as the deeds of those
whose resting place they mark will shine
fair and white in war and peace as long as
the Nation endures.
Mound after mound rises in this fair
place, along the avenues bordered by the
gloomy cypress. Flowers are bloomingâ
not radiantly, but softly and modestly, as
though their very natures were in accord
with the place. And every grave is fair
and green â none neglected.
For this is a day for solemn duty and
not for festivity. It is no holiday, no
gala occasion on which to parade our
finery and babble away the spirit of levity
which constantly lies waiting under our
every-day cloak for special opportunities
to soar. The donning of another cloak
to-day means something else and some
thing greater than a preparation for
pleasure, notwithstanding the several
regretable indications to the contrary
which appear here and there in announce
ments of games, picnics and sporting
contests to be held amid the ministra
tions to the honored dead and to disturb
the solemn hush which should linger
lovingly and reverently over their graves.
Deplorable as it is that there be men s<
careless of their brothers' memory ii
death, and so heedtess of that gratefu
respect which is due to the bartle-slaii
patriot from those who live to enjoy th
fruits of his noble sacrifice as to spend i
boisterous sport the day set apart in hi
honor, there is a sense of gratifkatio
and dignity to be derived from the as
surance that the rest of us refuse t
make a holiday of it. We know it onl
ns a day on which to do our duty by th
d nd. And. it.fills us with peace and th
comforting knowledge of a duty we
don; to note that * "every grave is fair an
green â none neglected."
Odd Fellows' Cemetery has had ii
plat filled for some tim*\ No less fair i
it than the Presidio plat, and it differ
only in that a low fence separates it fror
the other portions of the cemetery. Thei

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, MAY SO, 1897.
mourners com? to view V the place and lay
their gift of flowers on the graves, while
memory softly traces across their faces
lines of grief,- longing' and bereavement. '
The third, and . last, the ' Grand Army
Cemetery, impresses one â - as -the saddest
i spot of all. Viewing it from the car lines,
1 it looks so gloomy that instinctively you j
" walk slowly and solemnly up to the gate
and pass in with a -sigh. c There is the
same green grass covering mounds of the
same length and breadth and depth,' and
one begins to feel that fanciful preciseness
which is the chief horror of death. j| Here
I and there the mourners tread softly with
their baskets of blossoms and their . tear
stained : faces. There are '.i some new
mounds with just a few blades of -grass
. springing up into- God's ~ sunlight, a.nd
children strewing blossoms over them,
while the elders look on and weep. And
: he flowers that have lain a long while
look pitifully withered and faded, as
though they longed for the darkness of
oblivion. The fresh blossoms nestle their
fair faces into the warm grass and smile
themselves awayâ cheerful offerings to
courage.
And they wander in and out together,
all these human beings, for death brings
all to one levelâ the living as well as the
dead. The proud woman, in her cloak of
reserve, walked to the graves beside the
bowed mother broken in body and soul
by struggles with a conquering world.
There are the young with their careless
laughter and the old with their knowledge
af reality. The maimed and the halt,
snd even the blindâ and all with the per
fume of the flowers in their nostrils, and
the knowledge of grief in their heartsâ are
there.
But over all, mingling with the sunshine
and the passing breeze and pervading
everything, is the feeling of gratitude that
such men were buried there. The world
is better because they lived and nature
smiles at their return into her bosom.
It is hard to realize in the midst of all
this peace and beauty of nature that those
who were buried there were once young
and stalwart, once stood and listened to
the news of their country's trouble, and
casting all asideâ future ambitions, hope,
love, home, everything that a mortal
holds dear, went bravely forth to
battle, to face death. Not one of us but
has heard the tales of weary marches, of
sleepless nights in dread places, of the
death of comrades and heartrending scenes
with loved ones.
And not one of these who returned to
finish their life in peace but brought with
him something to prove his courage.
To most of them it was broken health,
some complaint contracted in the dire ex
posure. Others had scars, but the kind of
scars that do not disfigure but beautify.
Little wonder is it, then, that a nation
honors them, and their countrymen are
proud to lay offerings upon their last
resting place. It is no wonder that loved
ones in great numbers gather about with
loving remembrance. Not a flower is
laid there but blossomed for them, not a
breeze sighs over the graves but brings
some message to them. Every beam of
sunshine is more warm on their grass
grown mound, for not one rests there v/ho
is not a hero.
i18
THE NATIONAL
CEMETERIES OF AMERICA.
Nearly half a million soldiers' graves
will be decorated in the cemeteries of the
United States to-day. .Krom the Atlantic
to the Pacific the Nation's heroes â¢will be
honored by a loyal and loving people.
.From the time the sun rises over the hills
of Maine until it sinks to rest beyond the
mountains of California the vast extent of
our land will echo with the bugle call and
the booming of cannon. The youth of
the Nation will get their best lesson in
patriotism when they . lay a wreath of
flowers on the stone that marks a soldier's
grave.- ? j^Â§QH
It is at the present time impossible to
state exactly, how many soldiers' graves
will be decorated to-day, as no record has
been made of them for several years.
When the last record was made there
were about 300,000 sleeping in the Na
tional cemeteries and probably 75,000
scattered in little graveyards all over the
country. . The accompanying map gives
the figures of the last record made.
Of course, the number oi graves has in
creased since then. The veterans have
become fewer and fewer. They have not
fallen as rapidly as they were mowed
down before the death-dealing fire of
Gettysburg, nor as they fell in the awful
charges of Bull Run, but their rank* have
been thinned by the grim reaper, ana for
each one that passed away there has
arisen another mound to be decorated to
day.
National cemeteries, as is, perhaps, well
known, are burying-places maintained at
the expense of the United States Govern
ment, and wherein only soldiers are
buried. Many of these are near some
military post, but by far the larger ones
are located in the vicinity of the big bat
tlefields. Some of the heroes were buried
near the spot where they gave up their ;
lives for their country, and numbers were
taken to as near their homes as possible.
In the National cemeteries near the bat
tlefields most of the graves are unnamed.
Only a number and a tiny stone tell where
a hero lies sleeping.
When sliells and shot mowed men
down by the thousand it frequently hap
pened that there were none left to iden
tify the bodies. In most cases it was
known to what company certain men Lad
belonged, although each could not be
identified individually, and in such cases
all are buried in groups and the names of
all the men who were missing after the
battle axe inscribed on a single shaft.
There are in all about ninety National
cemeteries in the United States and so
scattered that each presents an entirely
different appearance. Could pictures of
them be viewed one after another they
would present a panorama of our country.
Each characteristic would be shown.
There would be cemeteries far out on
sandy wastes where the sun beats down
mercilessly and the dry desert wind car
ries the hot sand in blinding clouds
over the shiny stones that mark the
graves. There would be cemeteries in
mountain wilds and on boundless western
prairies. There would be peaceful little
spots sheltered 'neath church towers, and
vast stretches of beautiful park where
thousands lie buried. Millions of people
will visit these cemeteries to-day and
when night comes each will be a perfect
bank of flowers.
The most easterly of the National ceme
teries is the one known as Cypress Hills.
It is located not far out of the city of
Brooklyn, and is a typical Eastern bury
ing place that contains some of the finest
monuments that are placed over soldiers'
graves in toe country. The natural aspect
of the country at Cypress Hills is some
what flat, but the cemetery has received
so much attention and art has done so
much for it that the flatness is not notice
able. It is a most beautiful spot, where
5000 heroes are buried.

Coming up from the canyon, the other
morning, I walked into the midst of a
tragedy enacting under the sun. On the
roof of a bird box, where a pair of blue
birds had set up their lares and penates,
crouched a cat, reaching with murderous
paw into tne littie doorway in an en

agony of helpless rage, from which I

impressive place to visit at any time of

Wilmington. About 7000 are buried in
these three.
Almost at the southern tip of South
Carolina is the most beautiful National

a Jew miles away, across the river that
divides the two States, and it is from there
that the crowds of people will come who
will decorate its graves to-day. Hundreds
of the :-ons of Savannah are buried in
Beaufort.
In general appearance Beaufort might
be said to be a typical Southern cemetery.

are tiny lakes, bordered by smooth green j

monuments raised over the graves of
famous soldiers in thiÃ cemetery; but just

nameless graves that are marked only by
a small stone and a number.
For picturesqueness the National ceme

people causes uiueh attention to be given
to the ceremonies.
From Anderson Pille, Ga., and following
a sort of curve to Little Rock, Ark., there
is a line of cemeteries where nearly 100,000

still remember their lost sons, and even at

A National cemetery that is very little
known is Jefferson Barracks, located
about eighteen miles below St. Louis, Mo.

UNCLE SAM'S BIG REINDEER FARMS.
From all that can be learned, it would seem as if UieUnited States Government's
experiment of breeding reindeer in Alaska has turned into a failure. Certain it is
that it has prored to be a disappointment at one station and the animals are known
to have not "done wt 11" at the other, but the exact state of affairs cannot be learned
until the revenue cutters get bacÂ£ from the Arctic nexi fall.
The experiments of breeding reindeer must be conceded to be the greatest enter
prise of a paternal nature ever undertaken by the United States Government. It
ranks in importance with the "Freedraen's" schools which were established during
the CiviJ War for the purpose of educating the negroes, althougn it is not likely thai
the. cost ran so high. There is no doubt, however, tha: both of them took vast sums
of money.
A crsual estimate of the amount of money spent on the reindeer enterprise
would place it at about $2,000,000. It is to be hoped that all this is not lv,st, as in that
event there would be great discouragement to such enterprises in the future.
It is about seven years since the reindeer experiment was hm heard of and the
â  mount of attention and work that has been given to it since then is enormous.
Considerable mention was made of it in the newspapers for a couple of years after
the enterprise was started, bnt lately the subject seems to hove been forgotten.
The man who started the experiment so hopefully is now the first to declare it a
failure, on one station at least.
Tbe cause which prompted the enterprise was, as everybody might Know, the scar
city of draught animals in Alaska. Horses and mules couid not stand the climate
except in very few sections, and then they needed great care and comfortable stabling,
which two essentials are not easy to provide in a country that is frozen up during the
greater part 'of the year. Does, of course, were to be had in plenty and the little
feKows were able to do good work, but not of the kind demanded. They could drag a
email sled with a miner's outfit on it for miles and miles over hnrd, frozen snow;
but when it came to drawing heavy machinery they were not equal to the task. Some
other animal was needed. Oxen were tried, and failed worse than horses, owing to
their weight, which made them sink deep in soft snow.
The Government officials realized that if Alaska were to be improved and event

fats with the others in the Union some
draft animal must be provided. As in
every other new country the transporta
tion problem here was of the first consid
eration, and when David Johnson advo
cated the importation and breeding of
reindeer for this purpose his idea met
with ready approval.
Mr. Johnson was a man of vast experi
ence in the Northwest, and knew all about
reindeer and where they were t) be ob
tained. They were not indigenous to that
part of Alaska where they were needed, j
but there seemed no reasons- why they
should not thrive there. In fact, it seetued
as if they shuuld do splendidly, as the
climate was milder than in Siberia, their
native country.

wonc'e-fu!. A pair of males in good health

Californian in its tenor. A ready response was received from
twenty- four artists with homes stretching from San Francisco
to New York.
A further condition was that the contestants be in some
way, directly or indirectly, connected with the State University,
and thus the contest was limited to the confines of the institu-
tion. From the Mark Hopkins Art Institute came the greater
portion of the work submitted, while from the class in indus-
trial drawing at Berkeley a number were received. It was a
coincidence that in the sealed contest Sidney Armer of the
Mark Hopkins school should receive the first prize and that
L. N. Scammon of the Berkeley department the second prize,
the San Francisco department being first and the Berkeley
school second in rank.
On the whole the designs reflected much credit upon the
originality and artistic conceptions of the competitors. Many
that were meritorious from an artistic standpoint fell short of
the stated requirements for pure black and white, some being
colored, others being too fine in detail for reproduction, while
others were too pictorial in effect to produce that reitfulness to
the eye that comes only from the simple and the unpretentious.
The conception of the first-prize winner is excellently
wrought and is a worthy creation both from the point of view
need little food and appear to be indifferent to cold. In addition they are tractable
as horses, and always willing to wort. To put it plainly they are JoÂ»t what is needed
i i Al&sku
Of course there was considerable red tape to be gone through with before Congress
made tbe necessary appropriations, but after that was done the work went on
smoothly. _
The revenue cutter Bear was detailed on the work, and started from San Francisco
early in 1800. The wort done in the summer of that year was simply to select points
for stations, in which some assistance was given by the survey steamer Patterson.
Five stations were selected, the principal ones being Port Clarence and leller station.
The lollowing year, 1891, buildings were erected and a few reindeer brought to
their new homes from the northern shores of Siberia. Crews were procured for these
stations and left with enough provisions to last them until spring. On the Govern
ment books the keepers of these stations had about the same standing as lighthouse-,
keepers, although the pay was much smaller. Most of the crews were Esquimaux.
In 1892 the revenue cutter Bear was in the north early. The reindeer that had
been left at the different stations the previous fall were found in the best of condition,
and if any change was observable it was an improvement. The animals seemed good
natured and contented, consequently the officers of the Bear felt encouraged to pro
ceed with the work. During that summer the Bear made two trips to Siberia
and came back each time loaded with reindeer. On one trip 178 were obtained
in Siberia and 175 landed in good condition at Port Clarence. Three died on the
trip, whicn is considered a remarkably small number considering how much the
animals were out of iheir element while on shipboard.
The officers of the Bear had no trouble in obtaining all the reindeer they wanted
on any of their trips. They got most of them in exchange for rifles, ammunition,
provisions and articles of clothing.
Last fall when the U. S. cutters got back from the Arctic the officers stated that the
deer were not doing very well. They had not bred as rapidly as was expected and
seemed to be ailing in different ways. It is apparent now that the trouble must hare
been serious it that time as the following dispatch, which has already appeared in
the San Francisco newspapers, will show:
TACOMA.Wash., May 23.â David John
son, who has been in Northwestern
Alaska for six years, has just arrived on
tbe Sound en route to Chicago on a vaca
tion. He reports the Government's herd
of reindeer in the vicinity of Teller station
dying at an alarming rate from "footrot."
Many that do not die have to be killed
because of the decaying of their feet.
Although the dispatch only refers to
Teller station it is quite probable that iht
same or a similar state of affairs prevails
at the other stations. The conditions are
about the same at all of the stations.
There are spring thaws that leave the
ground wet. Tni3 causes all trie trouble,
aa the reindeer, accustomed to the hard
ice and snow of Siberia, suffer from damp
ness. It is to be hoped that something can
be done to save the herds. If they could
be removed to a place in the mountains
where there is snow all the time the
trouble might be overcome. This would,
of course, cost large sums of money, but
better spend that than have tbe enter
prise turn out a flat failure.

A Postmaster-General in the Golden State.
One of the many valuable historical
documents which the late Frank McCop-
I>iti had in his possession was an order
establishing the office nf Postmaster-Gen
eral in California in 1848. Very few people
are aware that California, a mere State,
ever boasted a Postmaster-General. Wil
liam V. Voorhies was his name, and, by
virtue of the commission he held from the
chief of the Postoffice Departmental Wash
ington he was authorized to establish
and maintain a postal system west of the
Rocky Mountains. This was nearly filty
years ago. The result of his labors has
been practically obliterated by the rapid
growth and development of tho Pacitic
Slope and his identity lost sight of, until
a historical document came to light the
other day which on its face shows the re
sponsible and stupendous task he under
took to perform.
The document referred to is the com
mission of William V. Voorhies from
the then Postmaster-Genera), C. Johnson,
"to act as agent for the United States
Government in making arrangements for
the establishment of postoffices and for
the transmission, receipt and conveyance
of letters in California." It is dated No
vember 1, 1848, and subsequent events
show that "Agent" or Postmaster-General
Voorhies was not long in getting into the
held.
The interesting old relic came recently
into the possession of Postmaster McCop
pln, it having been sent to him by a gen
tleman living in Sonoma. Where the com
mission has been since the time of Mr.
Voorhies would be hard to tell, the last
owner merely writing that he found it
stowed away in an old trunk, ana had no
knowledge as to how long it had been
there or where it came from.
It is a curious old document, written in
a girlish hand, upon legal cap paper, and
neatly tied with green ribbon, from which
the luster has long since faded. They did
not have typewiiting machines in those
days, but there can be no rightful com
plaint on that score, for the cbirography
is exceedingly legible, despite its age.
The commission itself is interesting
reading, as it outlines tne establishment
of a postal system in California thai could
grow and expand wilh the growth and ex
pansion of the country without entailing
an extra expense at any time on the
country. The document reads aa follows:
him a miner of 1849, with the Mission Church ann the gold
fields behind them, while still another has for its central
features two students â a boy and a girl â representing co-educa-
tion.
Still others are wrought in fanciful manners, wherein
figures of men, after the Aubrey Beardsley style, are the
features. One particularly meritorious design represents the
maiden "California" springing forth full grown from the Heart
of a beautiful srolden poppy.
Taking the contest as a whole, it is the general expression
of opinion that great credit is reflected upon the art depart-
ments of the State University. Botn from the standpoint of
originality and accuracy of detail, some of the designs offered
rival closely the work of Eastern schools of longer standing and
greater facilities. Will C. Russell.

Postofkice Department,)
November 1, 1848. {
Sir: Being authorized by an act of Congress
approved 14th August. 1848, to employ an
agent in making arrangements for the estab
lishment,of postoffices and for the transmis
sion, receipt and conveyance of letters in
California, I hereby appoint you such agent.
The duties with which you are to be charged
will not be confined to any one branch of the
department. They will embrace whatever
may appertain to the operations of the con
tract, appointment and fiscal bureaus of the
department in California.
A route having been created by law and the
same being put in operation by the employ
ment of steamships extending along the
whole coast of Caltfornia, your first duty will
be to proceed to the selection of suitable per
sons for Postmasters at San Diego, San Pedro,
Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Monterey
and at such other points on the Pacific at
which the United States steam mail packets
shall touch as may need such appointments.
For San Francisco a Postmaster has already
been appointedâ Samuel York At Lee Esq. â
who will repair by the first opportunity to
that place. Of course, you will not take steps
for appointing Postmasters at any of the
above named places on finding that the ap
pointments would be inexpedient or unneces
sary by reason of not having a mail supply or
for any other cause.
On making such selection you will report
the same to the department at Washington
for appointment, in the meantime placing tne
nominee in the performance of the duties of
his office by a temporary letter of appoint
ment, signed by yourself, to cease on receiv
ing a commission from the Postmaster-Gen
eral or official information ;.hat the appoint
ment has been refused. With your report of
the nomination of any postmaster you will
forward his band, duly executed by himself
and sureties, certified by you to be sufficient
and filled with such an amount as you shall
deem adequate for the case. You will also
cause him to be duly sworn on entering upon
his duties.
You will make report by every mail of the
condition and prospects of the business under
your charge, and will be careful at the expira
tion of each quarter to render those official
returns which Â« ill show the state of all pecu
niary arrangements of the department in Cal
ifornia, and the indebtedness and credits of
each party, whether postmaster, contractor or
others; and to keep the PoUmaster-General

spectfully, your obedient servant,

William V. Vookhies Esq., Present.
Evidently when Mr. Voorhies arrived
in California he found that his chief in
formation on the needs of the country
was incorrect, for although he established
nine postottices in this State during 1849,
only one point suggested by Postmaster-
General Johnson was included in the list.
Of course the rush of gold-hunters which
occurred about that time must have had
some effect upon the selection of settle
ments that could support postoffices ac
cording to the Postmaster-General's ideas.
The points at which offices were located
in 1849 are as follows: Monterey, Salt
Lake, Vernon, Stock on, San Jose, Colo
ma, Sacramento City, Benicia and So
noma.
It was not until April, 1849, that San
Francisco had a postmaster. Samuel
Yorke At Lee, the gentleman mentioned
in the commission, refused to venture into
the far West, as did also Stephen J.
Dallas, who was appointed twelve days
later and John W. Geary commissioned
January 22, 1849. Jacob B. Moore finally
accepted the appointment or Postmaster
at San Francisco, assuming the duties of
office April 18, 1849. He served until
March 26, 1853, when he was succeeded by
Thomas J. Henley. Since then the :ol
lowins postmasters have served in tn-s
City, the date of appointment being after
their names:
Charles L. Weller, July 10, 1854; Sam
uel H. Parker, April 4, 1861; Richard F.
Perkins, January 25. 1864; Holland Smith,

Samuel Backus, May 14. 1890; Frank Me-

office until his death last Wednesday.
William V. Voorhies served as Post
master-General of the Pacific Coast until
1860, when he returned to tne East, finally

years ago. Colonel J. D. Fry*, now presi

FROM GREATER NEW YORK
/Ingio-Qothamites WitK ar\ Eye or\ the
gueer\'s Jubileeâ J^lovtements of Gali
fomians ir\ the Metropolis.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 24.â Are you
going to ran over in time for the jubilee?
Every Anglo-New Yorker seems inter
ested oniy in that one topic lately. So
common has become the question that
downtown men forget to say "Have a
drink with me," and unconsciously nsk
"Have a jubilee with me, old man?" Be
yond doubt It will be one of the grandest
and most imposing celebrations of the
centurj', and I heartily envy the fortunate
folk who will have the opportunity of wit
nessing the marvelous scene, and in a
measure doing homage to a woman whose
life has been one of noble ana simple dig
nity, and whose example of motherly love
and devotion should be as a beautiful ser
mon to every mother in the land.
It seems odd that just at the time when
everybody is scrambling for passage across
the big pond the incoming steamars
should be comfortably filled with Ameri
cans returning to home and loved ones.
Mrs. Henry Gillig. looking very well
and handsome, arrived from London on
Tuesday. She was -called home sooner
than she anticipated on account of the
very painful accident that befell her
mother, Mrs. Crocker, at Sacramento.
Mn. Gillig received the distressing news
while in Lonaon, and with all speed has
tened to New York, intending to continue
direct to California. On her arrival here
she received the good news that her
mother was out of danger and conva
lescing rapidly. She has therefore de
cided not to go to California for the pres
ent. Mrs. Gillig's own illness while in
Italy has not told on her, for she certainly
has not looked better and lovelier in
years.
Hon. Thomas Fitch has carried out His
plans to locate in New York and has al
ready opened law offices in the Tower on
lower Broadway. He and Mrs. Fitch have
decided to remain in New York for the
greater part of the summer and have en
gaged apartments at the Ban Kemo over
looking the beautiful forests of Central
Park.
George C. Baldwin of San Francisco
spent a few days at the Gilsey last week.
C. R. Rockwocd, a prominent citizen of
Los Angeles, arrived in town on Wednes
day.
W. B. Sink of San Francisco has been
In town during tne past week looking
into business affairs here.
Arthur G. Fisk of San Francisco was
among the numerous arrivals here from
California on Wednesday. He is putting
up at the Hoffman.
Mr. and Mrs. Hugn Keenan of San
Francisco are also guests at the Hoffman.
Mrs. Ida S. Lewis, Miss Mabel Lewis
and Mrs. George B. Lewis, of San Fran
cisco, have been having a most enjoyable
visit in Gotham since their arrival several
w-eeks ago. They are located at the Fifth
avenue Hotel. On Saturday they formed
a pleasant party and ran down to Worden
town, Pa., to spend a few days with
friends and relatives. They will return to
town on Wednesday.
Mr. and Mrs. Leon Lewia of San Fran- '
Cisco are guests at the Savoy. They are
undecided as to when thsy will return to
California.
The many friend 3of Mr. ana Mrs. H. H.
Pearson will join in sympathy at the su\
intelligence of Mrs. Pearson's recent mis
fortune. On last Tuesday, accompanied
by her daughter and soi.-in-law, Mr. and
Mrs. W. H. Lamprecht, she was leaving
the cable-car at the corner of Broadway
and Fourteenth street, when the car sud
denly started, violently throwing Mrs.
Pearson into the 3treet. She struck on
her Lead, and when gently lifsea from the
ground was found to be unconscious and ;
frightfully wounded about the head and j
face. She was removed to her home, i
where physicians were summoned. She I
has not regained consciousness except at
snore intervals, when she faintly com- j
plain 3of a painful tingling throughout j
her whole body. Mrs. Pearson is quite j
heavy in weight, and the fearful fall she \
sustained has caused internal injuries
which may bring on a stroke of paralysis, j
so the physicians declare. . Concussion of
the braiu is also feared. Her sons Harry
and Fred, who have been out of town,
were telegraphed for, and Charles Pear
son, who is manager of the Hotel Stuart,
passes every moment possible at his
mother's side.
Mr. and Mrs. Lamprecht had intended
leaving for their home in Cleveland, Ohio,
on Wednesday last, but the accident to
Mrs. Pearson will doubtless detain them
here for many weeks, as Mrs. Lamprecht
will not leave her mother until she has
wholly recovered irom ncr injuries.
C. O. Poolo of San Francisco is regis
tered at the Hotel Imperial. He has been
in the city a week.

The fates decree strangely sometimes,
don't they? Two years ago it looked as
though William A. Brady, the young
Californian, would lead thelistof popular
and successful theatrical managers in
| America. He displayed remarkable abil
ity as a caterer to the public taste, made
several excellent proiuctions that proved
j successful artistically and financially and
I in truth won for himself the confidence
j and respect of the pleasure-lovinsr public.
! The closing season has undoubtedly been
I a most disastrous one for Mr. Brady, inas
| much that the several plays he produced
I during the year proved failures. Mr.
! Barrymore in the drama of "Roaring
| Dick & Co." closed early in the season.
j "New York" at tne American was a dire
| failure, and "Under tha Polar Star"
! was called in early. Mr. Brady de
; cided to spend all bis time and en
j ergy in managing Corbett. Corbett's
i failure in wresting the championship
: was necessarily crushing to Mr. Brady,
! However, phenix-like. he has arisen from

The Native Sou*Â§
The members of the Native Sons' band, com

very large number of friends who were, dur
â  ing the day, greatly entertained by music

The Argonaut Degree.
Last Friday night California Camp, No. 4,
of the Argonauts held a special meeting for
the purpose of initiating sixteen candidates,
all of whom took the first degree and two only
took the second degree. This is a side degree
of the Native Sons of the Golden West and is
one of the most elaborate of its kind, the
paraphernalia for the proper carrying out of
it costing not less than $600 for a camp of
fifty members. The ritual is based upon man's
desire for goid and the greed for gold is de
scribed as the chief end of man. The several
charges are illustrative of the dangers that be
set the one who seeks to acquire gold and they
are exceedingly impressive, being lull of use
ful lessons told in refined language. The
charges have been prepared with a great deal
of care. As they were delivered on. Friday
night without book in a manner that showed
a close study of them, they, created a deep im
pression on" the candidates, some of whom
were at first inclined to laugh at the idea of
the ceremony.
The candidates were moved from station to
station by attendants attired In costumes ap
propriate to the character of the solemn cere
mony, where they listened to the words of
wisdom, and at the last sta'.ion were rewarded
by a sweet smile from Lady Croesus, the beau
tiful goddess of the gold mines of the Golden
Stale. This formed a tableau which, in its
presentation, was highly dramatic and very
effective.
In the carrying out of the second degree
there was considerable sport with the two
blindfolded candidates, who went through
several testa to try their courage in their
search for gold. The tests to which they were
put were of a good-natured, harmless kind,
but all tending to show the act of Imagina
tion on different individuals.
This camp, which was instituted hut a short
.... time since with James J. Jamison as president,
. Frank D. Ryan as secretary and James P.
Dockery as chief of ceremonies, has already
167 members, and there are many applica
tions on file. Nearly all the grand officers
have taken the degree and there is not one
who has not spoken favorably of it. At the
meeting on Friday all past grand presidents
and the present grand president of the order
were made honorary members of the camp.

Ex- Attache on the Prevalence
of Mourning in Europe.
It is difficult to convey an idea to the
people in this country of the anxiety
which prevails not only is England itself
but also in every quarter of the vast do
minions of Queen Victoria concerning her
own health as well as that of every mem
ber of her large-sized family. It is not so
much on the ground of loyalty that this
anxiety exists just now, although it can
not be denied that the reigning dynasty
of Great Britain, and her Majesty in par
ticular, enjoy probably to a greater degree
than any other sovereign house the re
gard and affection of their fellow-country
men, but It is the dread lest any tin*
toward event should occur to render use
less the extensive and costly preparations
which have been made to celebrate in
an appropriate manner the sixtieth
anniversary of the Queen's accession to
the throne. Every one in the British
empire is looking forward to what is
commonly known as "having a good
lime in connection with this gre.at na
tional festival. The rich ana the well-to
do are organising all kinds of entertain
ments for their own enjoyment and for
that of their friends and acquaintances.
The business classes anticipate a golden
harvest from the revival of trade which is
certain to be entailed by tne expenditure
in connection with the celebration, while
on every side plant* are being made for
ameliorating the lot of the poor and the
working classes, both the Queen and the
Prince of Wales having impressed upon
the public the fact that they would ap
preciate more highly that form of cele
brating the diamond jabilee than any
other that conld possibly be devised.
Besides this enormous sums, amounting
to many millions of dollars, have been al
ready invested in decorations for adorn
ing the route of the royal procession
through the streets of the British metrop
olis on June 22, entire brick buildings
having been torn down and reconstructed
in a different fashion in order to present a
pleasing spectacle to the eye and to offer
accommodation to sightseers on that sin
gle day. Now all these preparations will
have been useless, all the money already
spent will be lost beyond redemption, and
all hopes and projects disappointed in the
event of any death taking place within
the next four weeks that would entail
court mourning. True, a number of the
mercnants, business men and speculators
in London have endeavored to protect
themselves against loss in this particular
by insuring the life of the Queen, policies
to the amount of some $10,000,000 having
been taken out on her Majesty, which will
become payable in case she were to die
before the end of June. But it must be
remembered that in the first place this
would only serve to indemnify a relatively
â mall number of individuals for their dis
appointment and loss, and that, more
over, these policies do not take into ac
count the possibility of the sndden demise
of one of the sovereign children, grand
children or other near relatives, of whom
she has nearly 100, and any one of whose
deatns would suffice to put an end to all
ideas of festivities in consequence of the
necessity of court morn in -.
Court mourning may be described as the
n ightmare of European court life, as well as
of that portion of the official world and of
society which are more or less intimately
connected with the court. No entertain
ment can ever be organized, no festivitj
planned, without the everlasting dread of
some royal death taking place to render
necessary a postponement or an abandon
ment of the entire affair. Annoying for
the men, it is still more so for the women,
since they never know until the very last
minute whether they can wear colors or
whether they are condemned to garments
of sable hue. For even when the relation
ship of the dead Prince or Princess
of the tlood is so remote as to ren
der unnecessary the postponement of
social and official functions and en
tertainments, court mourning is, nev
ertheless, de rigueur for a period
ranging all the way from ten days to three
months, during whicn time every woman
with pretensions to social standing is ex
pected to array herself in black and to
relegate her diamonds, her rubies, her
sapphires and her emeralds, as well a3 her
tnrquoises, to her casket, and to wear
nothing in the shape of jewelry out pearls,
which are the symbol of tears, while the
men are expected to add a mourning band
to their hat, to restrict themselves to
black ties for day wear, and if entitled to
wear a uniform to adorn the sleeves
thereof with an arm band of crepe. Royal
personngei and court officials are great
sticklers about such matters as these, and
while any lady who ventures during a
period of court mourning to attend a
dawiig-room or court function in colored
attire exposes herself to a very ungracious
reception on the part of the royal person
ages present, there have even been nu
meror.s occasions where women have
actually been prevented by the officials of
the Lord Chamberlain's Department from
entering the presence of royalty at all, in
consequence of their being dressed other
wise than in the prescribed black toilettes.
Just at the present moment all the
courts of Europe are in mourning for the
deaths of tne Duchess of Alencon in the
great tire in Paris and of her uncle, the
old Due d'Aumale, at Zucco, his place in
Sicily. True the mourning is only for a
fortnight. But royal relationships nowa
days are so extensive that what with one
thing and another two-thirds of the year
may be said to be spent m court mourn
ing. Under the circumstances the reign
ing families of Europe are naturally re
luctant to saddle themselves with addi
tional burdens in this respect and it is
to this consideration in part that must be
ascribed their failure, with one notable
exception, to decree court mourning
for the Empress mother of Ja
pan, a neglect which has given
no end of offense to the Mikado. There
was but one sqvereign in Europe who went
to the length of putting his court into
mourning during the space of a fortnight
for this great lady of the Orient, and that
waÃ King Leopold of Belgium, who was
prompted thereto by motives which must
be described as of an economic character,
rather than by reasons of sympathy and
sorrow. For he is largely. Interested in
the fortnightly line of steamships between
Antwerp and Yokohama, which has
recently been inaugurated, and which is
heavily subventioned by the Japanese
Government, while he is doing his utmost
to promote the trade and commerce
between his kingdom and the Land of the
Rising Sun, where he nopes to find a new

At tiie present time there is no court in
Europe where the rales for mourning are
90 onerous as that of Russia, and when
either an Emperor or Empress there dies
all Muscovite official* an i dignities above
a certain rank are compelled not only 10
> array themselves and their families in
habiliments of woe, but also to clothe their
servants in deep mourning, to have their
carriages upholstered in black and to have
the coats of arms, crests and monograms
removed from the panels of their equi
pages, while one of the salons of the resi
dence muse be draped completely in black
cloth, with the furniture upholstered in
black. Moreover, all the gold and silver
embroideries on the uniform of the offi
cers and officials has to be carefully cov
ered with crape. This is a terrible ex
pense, since the slightest drop of rain or
snow has the effect of taking the dye out
of the crape and damaging the embroidery
beyond repair. Many of these uniforms
cot-t as much as $800, and ordinarily the
pay attached to the offices of those enti
tled to wear them is not so big as to admit
of their spoiling many of such uniforms.
Until a few years ago it was a rule at
the courts of Europe that no mourning
should be donned by royalty, or should
be officially decreed for wear at court,
save in the cases of -he deaths of full
fledged Princes and Princesses of the
blood. It did not matter if a sovereign
or a royal personage had some morgan
atic relation, either in the shape of a wife
or of a child, or some dear and intimate
friend of meraly noole or plebeian rank,
whose departure for another world con
stituted nothing less than a bereavement,
and an irreparable loss. They were not
supposed to assume mourning in such in
stances as these, no matter how heart
broken they might be. Queen Victoria,
however, may be said to have inaugurated
a new era in this particular. For she took
the unprecedented step of decreeing official
mourning for Princess Julia of Uatten
berg, the plebeian born and morganatic
wife, or rather widow of Prince Alexander
of Hesse, a lady who on the Continent
was not even considered as "boffechig,"
that is to say qualified for presentation at
court. Queen Victoria's action gave rise
to no end of diioussion. For in decreeing
court mourniug for the Princess Batten
berg, she practically compelled all the
foreign Embassadors and envoys accred
ited to her court to pay the same tribute
of respect to the dead lady, and there
were many of the Continental sovereigns,
notably Emperor William of Germany,
King Christian of Denmark and Emperor
Francis Joseph of Austria, who did not at
all relish the idea of iheir Embassadors
putting themselves into mourning for so
insignificant a person as the morganatic
relict of a mere Serene Highness such as
Prince Alexander of Hesse, indeed, a
yast deal of very acrimonious diplomatic
correspondence ensued in consequence
thereof between the Foreign Offices of
Vienna, Berlin and Copenhagen, and that
of Great Britain.
In conclusion let me state there is one
point of analogy between the courts of the
Orient and those of tne civilized Occident
in connection with tne death of royal per
sonages. It is the sort of grim comedy
which provides that a. royal personage
shall be regarded as alive until the qbse
quies are actually celebrated. As far as j
Europe is concerned it is an etiquette
which belongs to a by-gone age and which
should find no place in our present en
lightened era, since it savors of something
akin to mockery and cannot but be most
painful to those near and dear relatives
who have been bereaved. Thus just before
the funeral the royal corpse holds a
sort of levee or reception when all
the great dignitaries of the realm
and members of the court pass
one by one before the august doad
bowing low and kissing the cold and
clammy hand of the cadaver. It was a
ceremony that was not even omitted in
the case of poor Crown Prince Rudoph of
Austria, although the crushing in of the
top of his skull and of the' left side of hi*
head by those who took part in the ter
rible tragedy at Meyerling necessitated
the use of the utmost skill on the part of
the physicians and embalmers to conceal
from the public the traces of the injuries
which be had sustained. The reluctance
of the reigning families to omit this)
species of post-mortem reception is be
cause its absence invariably gives rise to
the most extraordinary rumors and re
ports, the late King John of Saxony and
Czar Alexander I of Russia having been
asserted to have survived their official ob
sequies for many years owing to their not
having lain in state.
At certain courts (notably at that of
France in the days of the Bourbon kings)
dinner was Jaid for the i'lustrious dead
every night and aunounced in the custom
ary manner by the grand master of cere
monies to the corpse as it lay in state, and
in the following words: "Sire, the dinner
is served according to your Majesty's or
ders." The officer standing on duty beside
tne bier would respond, "His Majesty has
been graciously pleased to dine already
and desires to remain undisturbed,"
whereupon the master of ceremonies
backs out with three low obeisances to the
dead and orders the meal to be taken
away. Tbis continues every day until the
final obsequies. Much the same grewsome
pantomime was enacted at the time of the
death at Formosa of the Japanese Im
perial Prince and Field Marshal Kitashi
rakawa, so well known in this country.
Japanese court etiquette requires that no
official information of the death of
a member of the reigning family shall ba
made until after the celebration of certain
mortuary ceremonies in his or her own
palace. The dead Prince was therefore
brought all the way back from Formosa to
Tokio as a live man. The general order
announcing his departure to the troops
bore what purported to be his signature.
The man-of-war that conveyed his corpse
to Japan flew no emblems of mourning as
its masthead. Meals were served in the
cabin where the dead Prince lay, and mili
tary and naval reports were made to hit
deaf ear every morning and evening just
as if he were alive. On reaching port he
was disembarked with naval and military
honors and arrayed in a uniform of field
marshal, was seated in a saloon carriage
on the railroad, his staff taking their
places around him. Arriving at Tokio ha
was conveyed not to a h arse, but to a
state coach, seated in which and sur
rounded by a cavalry escort he was driven
to his palace. Only on the following day
did the Qovernment issue the public and
official announcement of his death.

A Dangerous Spot.
A short time ago an old lady went on
Nelson's flagship, the Victory. The dif
ferent objects of interest were duly shown
her, and on reaching the spot where the
great naval hero was wounded (wnich la
marked by a raised brass plate) the officer
remarked:
"Here Nelson fell."
"And no wonder! " exclaimed the old
lady. "I nearly feil there myself."

dise there, only those remain who are
destitute and unable to get away. Thus
bursts another Bellamy bubble. Major
Winchell's sugar-beet colony, run on lib
eral and common-sense principles, is the
kind of a colony best calculated to bring
to its members comfort and happiness.
PUT AWAY DISTRUST.
The speech of Secretary Gage at the
! commercial banquet in Cincinnati on Fri
day evening was marked by the eloquence
of rieht words fitly spoken. It Rave utter
ance to sentiments of permanent value
and yet having a particular relation to the
conditions of the present time. It was
therefore something more than an after
dinner address, and will have a beneficial
effect in steadyine the public mind and
strengthening popular confidence in the
administration and in Congress.
The keynote of the speech was em
bodied in the words, "Faith and courage
lead to conquest and victory. Distrust
paralyzes and destroys." The attacks
which have been made upon both houses
of Congress and upon the pending tariff
bill Dave had the effect of creating discon
tent, uncertainty and fear. As the
speaker said, these attacks are injurious
and have sowed evil seeds in many direc
tions. They have engendered a sentiment
of distrust "dividing classes, destroying
unity and breeding hatreds." Tha result
nas been to retard the revival of trad,e and
the restoration of prosperity.
There is no justification for partisan at
tacks on the Government in any of its
branches, nor any reasonable foundation
for fears which may be felt by any class
of citizens Speaking for the administra
tion, the Secretary declared it would
faithfully fulfill all the pledges made to
the people during the campaign, and
added: "In good time and in proper or
der affirmative evidence of my declaration
will appear." All assertions or suspicions
of any forgetfulness of those promises
were declared to be "unjust and un
founded."
The Secretary could not speak for Con
gress with the sane authority he has in
speaking for the administration, but ne
nevertheless bore testimony to the zeal
and Kood faith of those in both houses
having tha tariff bill in charge. His
statement on this point at Cincinnati was
confirmed by a remark made at Washing
ton almost at the same time by Senator
Vest. At the close of the day's debate on
the tariff the Senator said: "More prog
ress has been made in the Senate on this
bill in three days than was made on the
existing tariff in three weeks."
There is indeed every reason for the
American people to be well content with
the prospects before them as regards both
individual industry and the Government.
There has never been a tariff bill on
which there has been less partisan light
ing and a more earnest effort to provide
for the welfare of the people and the Na
tion. Nothing is needed to hasten the
coming of good times but a relief from
the distrust that paralyzes and destroy*
and a return to the faith and courage that
lead to conquest and victory.
The Secretary's words of counsel and
chier should be read and heeded by all.
'â¢In the meantime, my friends, do your
part to help those charged with the legis
lative and administrative duties. Don't
let inertia, engendered by fear and dis
trust, creep over yon. We have been pass
ing through a period of great trial and
nobly we have endure! the strain. The
future is not dark with lorebodings. It is
illumined with rational hope."
TOR FREE CUBA.
The appeal issued by the Cuban League
of the United States for a National sub
scription of $1,000,000 to aid the cause of
Cuban independence is an evideuce that
the friends of the patriots in this country
have not allowed their energies to be re
laxed by reason of the brightening pros
pect of success, but are as active as ever
in speeding the struggle and hastening it
to an early and victorious consummation.
There is every reason to believe that if
prompt aid is given to the Cubans now
the long protracted war can be brought to
a close before the end of the year. The
Spaniards are despondent, while the Cu
bans are flushed with victory and san
guine ol success. Every report from the
island brings news of additional defeats
for the Spaniard and triumphs for the
patriots. Weyler has ceased to make even
a pretense of campaigning in the field and
confines his efforts to maintain his garri
sons in the scattered fortresses with which
the provinces are dotted. This is clearly
significant of the approaching end. When
an invading army abandons the aggres
sive and seeks only to defend itself its
final surrender can only be a question of
time.
"There are tides in the affairs of men
which, taken at the flood, lead on to for
tune." That tide came in the American
Revolution when Cornwallis stopped in
his march from the southern to tne north
ern colonies and intrenched himself at
Yorktown to await aid from England. It
was Washington's opportunity, and for
tunately, by the aid of the French fleet
and French munitions of war, he was able
to take advantage of it and strike the de
cisive blow. The tide has come for Cuba
now. If we can give to her but a portion
of the assistance France gave to us Cuba
will be free.
The appeal issued by the Cuban League
is most timely and opportune. Money
advanced for Cuban independence now
will bring a sure and speedy return. With
the amount asked the patriots will be able
to arm themselves, and Garcia can assume
the aggressive and force the Spaniards to
take to their ships for safety. There
ought, therefore, to be a prompt response
to the appeal. Colonel Ethan Allen, pres
ident of the league, in a dispatch to Mayor
Phelan urging contributions in this City
says: "The country will follow. New
York will do her part." This is indeed
no local movement The independence of
Cuba is an American cause, and all Amer
icans should give to It sympathy, encour
agement and help.
THE MEERSCHAUM CENTENARY.
To those who find soothing delight in
the after-dinner pipe, or who, on care-free
evenines, reclining in chairs of ease, love
to court the fancies that rise and wave
about in the wreathing smoke, and van
ish, only to be followed by troops of
others with every succeeding puff, the
present year unfolds a tale of interest;
and this interest will be a hundred-fold
greater if the smoker has once touched
his lips to the silicate gathered, on the
plains of Eski-shehr. This year, in fact,
records the centenary of the meerschaum
pipe.
The man who possesses a meerschaum
pipe deems himself blessed beyond the
common run of mortals. He guards it as
he would the choicest gem. When he has
enjoyed its solace for a time, he carefully
puts it away in a satin-lined case, and
secures it in his treasure-house, perhaps,
till the hour shall come again to welcome
it to his lips and pleasure. Woe be to the
wretch who would scratch or mar that
pipe, which smokers have hailed as a gift
of the gods. Its owner watche?, with a
species of delight, its changing color,
from snowy whiteness to a creamy tint,
from which it then gradually takes on a
hue of brown, until, after years of use, it
reaches finally a brilliant, deep chestnut
brown, nearly black. He waxes it all this
time that it may color evenly, and is par
ticular to handle only the amber mouth
piece when he smoke?. But, of course,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
all this refers to the genuine articleâ the
real hydrated silicate of magnesium.
The waxed egg-shells and oth?r products
of meerschaum factories, known as the
meerschaum of commerce, can never de
ceive the man who has once tasted the
sweetness of the real meerschaum.
The raw material was first brought to
Prague just one hundred years ago and
was first converted into a pipe by a Mag
yar. Men have derived immeasurable
comfort from the meerschaum pipe since
1797. It has been blessed by poet and
painter, statesniAn and warrior. Enthusi
asts go so far as to say that history, with
out a doubt, has been diverted into new
channels by the meerschaum; that be
cause of the cheer of the right pipe at thÂ«
right time generals have won cam
paigns, and they quote the instance of
General Lassalle, who always led his
cavalry with a meerschaum between his
teeth.
The century will probably be celebrated
in Vienna, the central point of the meer
schaum industry, and it is even suggested
that a monument be built to the memory
of Eduard Cardon, who made more good
meerschaum pipes than any man of his
day, the kind through whose heated bowls
a needle can be passed without leaving a
trace. To own one of Carbon's pipes is to
be a thirty-third degree member of the
smokers' order. Edwin Uootn was the
possessor of one, and he is said to have re
garded the genuine article as something
productive of about the fullest measure of
earthly bliss. If the meerschaum has
contributed io largely to the comfort of
mankind it is proper that the meerschaum
centenary should not be allowed to pass
unobserved.
PATRIOTISM IN THE SCHOOLS.
A fitting and beautiful prelude to Me
morial day was ihe Lincoln celebration
by the myriads of school children of the
City, assisted by veterans of the Grand
Army. Nothing more inspiriting, in a
patriotic sense, can well be Imagined in
this timo of peace than the spectacle of
white-haired soldiers, clad as of old in
uniforms of blue, bending their aged
forms to greet the shining faces of the
little boys and girls at school, and to the
new generation â listening with eager
nessâbreathing some recollections of the
war in which the union of States was ce
mented forever by the blood of the He
public's loyal citizens.
Our schools and their teachers merit a
hearty commendation in the premises.
To their credit be it said that the Grand
Army orators who were seiecte I to tell
the children something about Abraham
Lincoln found to their surprise and de
light that even the smallest of the pupils
knew almost as much as they about the
great emancipator. Such was the story at
every school, and not a single child could
fail to be impressed by thoia exercises
with a high sense of country pride ana
love for the flag and all the flag means.
The children of our schools are the
hope of the Nation. Its future depends
upon their loyalty and devotion. Then it
is not only right and just, but imperative,
that lessons of patriotism should be taught
in schools throughout the length and
breadth of the land.
We have a history as glorious as that of
any nation that the sun shines on, and
names that jrlow as brightly on the scroll
of fame as any that Greece or Borne pro
duced. Our pride, as a Nation, should be
as strong as our own annals are glorious;
and especially should we cherish those
examples of moral worth, firm character,
sublime courage and splendid heroism
that adorn our country's story from the
beginning.
Lincoln day should Be set apart on the
calendar for like appropriate recognition
and celebration in each succeeding year.
In a score of years from now there will be
no more Grand Army on the field of life;
but while our schools put forth pupils
armed with such Knowledge and apprecia
tion of their country's history as the San
Francisco public schools to-day assure
there need be no fear for the future.
Then, if ever foe should assail us, no mat
ter whence or in what guise be comes, or
how numerous his ships or great his
armies, there will be no dearth of Lin
colns; thera will be no dearth of Grants.
Their spirits will be with us, and that
means victory for our flag.
SUMMER TRAVEL.
The season of summer travel is almost
upon us and soon there will be a multipli
city of life in our picturesque mountains
and by the rollicking waves of our border-
Ing deep blue sea. And where on earth,
we may ask, can the tourist find more to
charm his vision, inspire his thoughts and
rejuvenate bis being than here on the
Balboa shore?
The remark is frequently made with re
gard to Californian3 that they do not as
a rule sufficiently appreciate their own
State. There is a large-sized grain of
truth in this. We long to view the sights
of Europe beforu we have seen the wonders
of California. The great waterfalls of
the Scandinavian Peninsula hardly com
pare in grandeur and sublimity with our
Yosemite. We have Alpine splendors as
well as Switzerland ; skies as blue as those
of Italy, and which are more balmy. Nature
nas been lavish with us in her bounties.
From the Oregon boundary down to the
Mexican line the observant traveler will
be presented with a series of the most
varying scenic pictures to be found the
world over. Our mountain lakes are no
where surpassed for placid beauty, and
our historic missions are replete with in
terest for the stranger. Big and small
game are found in abundance in our nills
and forests, and fish in plenty in our nu
merous streams. At our redwood giants,
which were saplings somewhere back in
Solomon's time, and have been growing
steadily ever since, the world will never
cease marveling.
Our citizens in general would acquire a
deeper feeling of State pride if they would
acquaint themselves more thoroughly by
means of travel with the Stato at large.
If you delight in travel and sightseeing
don't leave California until you are able
to describe to inquiring people of the less
favored countries you may wish to visit a
few at least of the wonders of the land
you call home.

WHY CHAUNCEY DEPEW DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE.
j "People may say that happiness cannot come at will, but I believe it can."
j The speaker was Chauncey Depew, and he was addressing a representative of the Plttsburg
Dispatch. "I remember once when a young man I was on the point of suicide," continued
Mr. Depew. "I had lost all, including the savings ot several yearsâ not representing pri
vations, but money that had been put aside Instead or spending it on Dassine pleasures that
| were tempting but not necessary to happiness; but worse than thelo.s of all my money was
the fact that I had managed to get
into debt while trusting in the bad in
vestments from which I suffered. What
galled most was the fear that creditors
would bring pressure to bear on ray friends.
It was bad enough to think that duns would
soon be convinced of the uselessneis of trying
to get anything out of me, out pride revolted
most at the thought that others were likely to
be squeezed in efforts to obtain a settlement.
I brooded for days on tha thought of self-de
struction. I discussed the various means of
uking off, until I became an expert in poisons,
pistols, drowning-, asphyxiation and the use
of the knife. I went into details in selecting
a weapon, and particularly speculated on the
best sort of pistol and point of aim for a man
unused to firearms.
''But gradually I awoke to the fact that man
has a dual nature. My worse and better feel
ings argued the matter out. On the one hand
I said to myself: 'You're made a bad mess of
things and you can't improve them by staying
here; you may as well give up the struggle
and get out.' On the other side something
within me said: 'Chauncey, you're a young
man; you have had a good education; you
have a gooa head. Be a man; face the battle
of life; take up your burden and make up your
mind to succeed.' So I faced the battle of life,
but on the heels of ray decision to do so
came another resolve. I realised for the first
time it wa3 necessary for me to extirpate the
seeds of heredity. My grandfather's death
was due to worry. Almost certainly my fath
er's had been from the same cause, and I had
just seen how early I had allowed troub'e to
tempt me to end niy own life. So I set myself
to work to extirpate the seeds of heredity and
assiduously cultivate the lighter side of my
nature. I determined to always look for the
funny aspect of things and travel miles lor a
good joke or story. The result has been that
1 have boen able to face the battle of life with
more cneerfulness and work harder than most
people; and what I prize still more is tnat
I've i ri'n able to help many another poor
devil along.
"Another result has been that almost every
newspaper in the country speaks of me as a
â flippant cuss,' and every now and then tone
oracle says, ' What & pity it is thatCnaunCey
Depew cannot be serious always. His words
hnd opinions then would carry some weight.'
But 1 liAve been so eminently satisfied by the
brightness brought into my life by the course I
have followed that if they were to guarantea me the Presidency of the United States and the
Chief Justiceship of its Supreme Court at the samo time on ihe condition that I would go
around making heavy, p.atitudinous speeches, I would refuse the offer.
"Times are hard and they have affected my interests as well as those of other folk. There
is little in the material condition of property or things in general to encourage me in cheerful
ness. But I can at least fiud cause for happiness in McKlniey's election, for I believe that,
ike me, he believes that 10-morrow should always be better than to-day, aad he has more
power to make it so than I have, thoagh he cannot be more inclined to try."
Then the newspaper man went away feeling that he had been given a glimpse of the inner
nature of one which would add much to the liking he had always had for him, and still more
to his respect. The man who can achieve a reputation as a humorist by extirpating the dolor
ous seeds of heredity and assiduously cultivating the brighter side 01 his nature is a man of
100 much strength of character to be regarded as a ''flippant cuss" and mere aÂ£tÂ«r-dinner
orator.
WAR AND CIVILIZATION
The Greco-Tnrkish war again brings up the
question whether war Is ever a necessity and
whether modern war conditions are inimical
to the highest interests of civilization as we
understand them to-day.
To be fully prepared for immediate war is
now recognized as a first necessity by all the
great Continental powers. â¢ These conditions
profoundly affect the entire policy of these
states, both domestic as well as foreign. This
is a most remarkable feature of the present
stage of civilization and one worthy the full
est attention of the philosopher and states
man. So far-reaching a system cannot but
have a marked effect for good or evil upon the
nations concerned and through them utK>n the
whole civilized world.
If the result of the extraordinary advances
made In all departments of science during the
past halt century has been to enable nations
to butcher one another on a scale hitherto un
known, it may well be thought, at first glance,
that our boasted civilization is a mere gloss,
and that if the surface be but scratched all of
the fighting and destroying tendencies of
barbaric man will still be apparent.
In the minds of many extremist!* war is never
justifiable; no possible good can ever come
from it, and hence it should be Avoided on all
occasions and at any cost Needless to say if
such views had always held full sway and had
been carried to their logical conclusion we
would not now be enjoying the benefits and
privileges which can only come from being
citizens of a great and powerful country. To
condemn war indiscriminately is thus tanta
mount to denying the advantages flowing
from those larger aggregations of peoples
called nations.
Evidently, and without entering Into any
apology for war for its own sake, occasions
must often arise in the life of a nation when
war is not only justifiable, but actually de
manded by every consideration. Not all wars,
unfortunately, fall into this category. As long
as human nature remains unchanged we may
expect the same conditions to repeat them
selves, and once the war spirit of a people is
aroused calm reasoning is at an end. If to
provoke unnecessary war is a crime, scarcely
lets so is it for a nation to remain quiet under
insult and injury. To be prepared at all times
for war is to lessen the probability of its oc
currence, and in this sense a reasonable con
dition ol preparedness is the duty even of the
most peace- loving of nations.
Nations have often been compared to indi
viduals, and in the main the comparison is
exact. By war nations are born, by war they
g row, and by war they finally perish as or
ganized and separate communities. Peace is
enervating, while war develops many of the
finest qualities both of nations and of indi
viduals. If then the civilization of the present
day has made war in many ways more terrible,
on the other hand It has made it a thing not
lightly to be undertaken. Great wars are no
longer dynastical, but national. The whole
manhood of the nation is involved, and the
consequences of defeat or victory are therefore
vastly more far reach ing. Public opinion and
not the will of princes now controls the dogs
of war. A constant state of readiness for wnr
constitutes in itself the strongest guaranty of
peace. The very scale on which modern war
iÂ» waged causes a serious drain upon the
richest country. The sinews of war are still
the same.
As a result of all these conditions wars be
tween civilized nations are becoming both less
frequent and of she rter duration, and will not
probably be undertaken until every other re
source is exhausted. Who can say that this
does not constitute a distinct advance for civ
ilization? It marks a decided change from
by-gone times, when war was undertaken
often upon the flimsiest pretext and dragged
its slow length along for years, with all the
interruption to progress which that Implies.
Now, when war is finally decided upon the
object will be to make it short, quick and de
cisive. It will be pushed to its legitimate
conclusion as quickly as possible. In this way
a lasting peace is assured wit li the least possi
ble Interference with existing conditions and
the cause of civilization correspondingly ad
vanced.
LIGHT ON A MYSTERIOUS WORD.
There are any number of queer items in a
tariff bill. Who can tell, at first thought or
after a day of careful study for that matter.
anything about pulu, or divi-divi, or styrax,
or calamine, or osmium, or any other of the
thousand-and-one curious names lor still
more curious articles that have to be enumer
ated?
All ot which is preliminary to a story which
a veteran member of Congrem told to a Wash
ington Post reporter the other day. It seems
that for a number of years there was in the
tariff laws a duty of 60 per cent ad valorem
imposed upon "alkakange." There it stood
in all ita glory, duly assessed, resisting all ef
forts to place it either on the free list or to
reduce the duty. When Judge Kelley of Penn
sylvania was the chairman of the Committee
on Ways and Means some tariff items had to
be tevised, and the suggestion was again
made that perhaps a duty of 30 per cent upon
"alkakange" would be sufficient. But all the
members of the committee, Horace Maynard,
and Schenck and Austin Blair, stood up in
earnest protest.
"What Is 'alkakange,' anyhow?" asked a
Democratic and inquiring member of the
Ways and Means Committee when the item
was reached.
"The idea of any one asking that auestion I"
exclaimed Judge Kelley, and all his colleagues
raised their hands In holy horror at such
ignorance.
As these exclamations did not answer the
question the Democratic free-trader sent for
an unabridged dictionary, and looking it all
through found no such word at alkakange.
He got no more instruction from an encyclo
pedia. He asked in vain of Ure's dictionary
oi science ana arts. The meraben of the com-
SSEL
â¢nittee began to grow worried. Finally they
summoned a prominent chemist, for, of
course, said they, alkakauge was a drug. But
the chemist said that to his knowledge there
was no such thing as alkakange in all the
pharmaconia.
At this point some one suggested that they
send over to the Government Printing Office
and ask the proofreader who had revised the
law. Certainly lie would know.
"Weil," saia the employe, who at last ap
peared, "the truth is that nineteen years ago,
when we hÂ«d a page of the tariff" law on a
'form,' a part of the type dropped out, and it
was fixed up by one of tue primers. The only
thing he could make out of the combination
of letters was the word 'alkekango, ' and I sup
pose it has remained i- the law ever nince."
Perhaps pulu and <livi-divi and a few other
of the unpronounceable and wonderful things
in the present, tariff bill got in through the
same way. Who knows?

Artificial Iceâ E. ID. 8., Hanford, Kings
County, Cal. Various kinds of ice machines
have been manufactured, but the only practi
cal successes have been those employing the
expansion of a compressed gas, or of a liquified
vapor which cools during compression. The
gaseous amonic frigoric machines are isea
most widely, being so-called because thej em
ploy anhydrous ammonia. In prlnciplesucii
machines consist of an evaporator or con
gÂ«aler,Â«in which the evaporizaiion of the am
monia takes plate; a pump for aspiratinf the
gas as formed in the evaporator; a liquifer or
condenser where the gas is compressed bf the
pump, the liquefaction being aided by a con
densing stream of cold waier. This last romed
portion of tne apparatus serves simply ;o re
store the ammonia to its original state, so
that it may be used over and over agaia. In
order to utilize the low temperature ob.ained
by this apparatus for making ice, the usual
practice is to run the ammonia into coils for
evaporation. These coils being led in coils of
brine, the evaporation robs the brine of its
heat, and cans of water being set itto the
brine are frozen. The usual sizes <f can
molds are for containing from 100 to 300
pounds of ice, but within a few yeirs the
manufacture of plate ice has come to be pre
ferred in many quarters. These plate." of ice
are about Bxl6 feet in size and from 1C to 16
inches thick. From eight to twelv* days'
time is required to freeze them.
Tne most recent ice machines built on the
principle described will produce abou. thirty
two pounds of ice per pound of coal cotsumed,
the proportion depending on the outr.de tem
perature at the time.

MAHAN'S LIFE OF NELSON. '
THE LIFE OF NELSON' THE EMBODIMENT i

United States > a vy. In two volumes. Bosion:

The publication simultaneously in this
country and in England of Captain Mahan's
'â¢Life of Nelson" is the literary event of the
rear. The book hag been anxiously and im
patiently awaited on both sides of the water,
/or it was felt that previous biographies of
Eng : and's naval hero â those of Southey. of
Nicolas and of Russell, to cite the three bestâ
were all more or less detective. The student
of maritime matters has long been on the look
out for a standard work, free from technicali
ties and couched in readable English, that
would deal impartial justice to one of the most
important characters in the hisiory of Eng
land. The volumes before us are evidence
that the desired end has been reached, and it
is not too much to say that, dating from 1897,
Captain Mah.an'B work, will be accepted as
standard.
Captain Mahan possesses numerous qualifi
cations for the work ne has undertaken. He
is an officer of the United States navy, and has
seen continual service since 1859. He has
also won considerable reputation as a naval
historian, this being based upon his "Gulf and
Inland Waters," a history of the movements of
our navy during the Civil War; "The Liie of
Admiral Farragut"; "Tue Influence of Sea
Tower Upon History, 1660-1783," and "The
Influence of Sea Power Upon the French Revo
lution, 1793-1812," all these being recognized
as authoritative upon the subjects of which
they treat. To this add a charming style of
English composition, Combined with a per
fectly balanced and impartial method of han
dling facts, and it will be readily seen that we
have in Captain Mahan a writer eminently
fitted to act as sponsor for a new life of Nelson.
The idea of writing a biography of the hero
ol Trafalgar 15 rst occurred to Captain Mahan
in 1893, when he was ordered to the command
of the United States ship Chicago. lie had
then already formed the purpose (which he
has since carried out) of retiring from the
navy at the expiration ot forty years' service.
With this idea he had petitioned the depart
ment to release him, in order that he might
continue with his literary work. Tiie naval
authorities, however, refused to accept his
resignation, and a two years' cruise lollowed.
Trie captain endeavored to do his literary
work after his hours of duty, but, a?
can well re imagined by those pos
sessed of t*ie slightest acquaintance with life
on shipboard, he found this impracticable.
The "Life of NelÂ«on," therefore, has been
â written since Captain Manan's return from
his cruise on the Chicago in May, 1805, with
the exception of the first couple of hundred
pages, and these nave been largely revised
and amended from the original draft. Owing
partly to official duties as a lecturer at the ,
naval war college and partly to other engage- :
ments, the work was not begun until Novem
ber, 1895.
If there is one laudable characteristic pos
sessed by the author of the work under re- j
view and manifested in his treatment of the !
subject, it is a really liberal measure of mod
esty. To use his ownwordi: "Tne aim of the I
present writer, while not neglecting other
sources of knowledge, has been to make Nel
6on describe himselfâ tell the stcry of his own
inner life as well as of his external actions, j
To realize this object it has not seemed the
best way to insert numerous letters, because i
in the career of a man of action each one
commonly deals wHh a variety of subjects
â which bear to one another little relation,
except that, at the moment of writing, they
all formed part of the multifold life the writer
was then leading. * â¢ * The author's
method has been to make a careful study of
Nelson's voluminous correspondence, analyz
ing It in order to detect the leading ieatures
of temperament, traits of thought and motives
of action, and thence to conceive within him
self, by gradual familiarity even more than
by formal effort, the character therein re
vealed." Such is the p'.an of the wort. as out
lined by its author, whu, steadfastly adhering
to his theories, has proved their superiority.
In his work Captain Mahan has baea at
particular pains to set down nothing in malice,
wnile extenuating nothing. He pictures to
us the man as he was, exhibiting both his
many good traits and his undoubted failings.
An invalid throughout his life, this fact is
mentioned by Nelson's biographers as a factor
in his career which should not be lost to mm d,
inasmuch as "on the one hand it explains iv
part the fretfnlnsss which at times appears,
and on the other brings out with increased
force the general kindly sweetness of his
temper, which breathed with slight abatement
through such depressing conditions."
Of the mental characteristics of Nelson,
Captain Mahan has this to say:
"The breadth and acuteness of Kelson's in
tellect have been too much overlooked in the
admiration excited hy hit unusually grand
moral endowments ol resolution and fearless
ness of responsibility. Though scarcely what
could be called an educated man he was oue
of close and constant ooservation, thereby
gaining a great deal of information; aaJ to
the use of this be brought a practical sageeity
which coped with the civil or political ques
tions placed before it, for action, much as it did
with military questions â for, after all, good
generalship on its intellectual side Is simply
the application to the solution of a military
problem cf a mind naturally gifted thereror
and stored with experience, either personal or
of others. As a strategist and tactician Kel
son made full proof ol high native endow
ments, of wisdom garnered throush fruitful
study and meditation and of clear insight into
the determining conditions of the various
military situations with waich he had to
deal."
To a frail body and a powerful brain Nelson
united a dash and daring that were remark
able. Confirmation of this is to be lound In
his correspondence before the occurrence of
the tiege of Bastia under Lord Hood, who was
himself fearful of hazarding the experiment.
"I feel for the honor oi my country," wrote
Nell on at this time, "and had rather be beat
than not make the attack. If we do not try,
â â¢re caa never be successful. I own I have no
fears for the final issue; it will be conquest.
My reputation depends upon tbe opinion I
have given, but I feel an honest conscious
ness that I have done right. We must, we
have it, or some of our heads will be laid
:ow. I glory in the attempt." And again:
"What would the immortal Wolfe have done ?
As he did, beat the enemy, if he perished In
the attempt." Still again, a fortnight later:
"We are in high health and spirits besieging
BaitU; the final event, I feel assured, will be
conquest."
The one great blot on the career of Nelsonâ
the Lady Hamilton episodeâ is handled by
Captain Mahan in a manner provocative of
our highest praise. Indeed, after reading
those portions of the book treating of the
matter one is almost inclined to forgive the
liaison between the two. The Incident is a
singular contradiction of the ancient saw that
two of a kind never agree. Nelson and Lady
Hamilton, as described to us by their bi
ographer, were very similar in temperament
and composition, especially in their common
love of admiration and the flattery of courts.
Born oi humble parents, possessed of great
personal charms and accustomed to the !
adoration of public men, diplomats and j
artists, it was natural that Lady Harniton
â bonid have laid her nets for the successful ,
naval commander whose name and lame were j
at this time (17i>0) the talk of Europe. Â»Â«- j
son arrived at the court of Naples, met the j
renownea wife of Sir William Hamilton and j
was conquered; but it must not be imagined
lhat their acquaintance was a simple love af
fair. Through the relations of Lady Hamilton
with the Queen of Naples, whose "real and
only confidential friend" she was, Nelson was
enab.ed to keep his hand upon the pulse of
Europe, then throbbing feverishly. In 1801
we find him writing tor Addington, the then
Prime Minister of England:
"Having for a length of time seen the corre
spondence, both public and private, from all
the Neapolitan Ministers to their ciovernmeut
and to the Queen of Naples, I am perfectly
acquainted with the views of the several
powers."
From this it will be seen that whatever suc
cess Nelsou may.have had in the field of diplo
macy it must be attributed to his experiences
at the Neapolitan court under the tuition of
his inamorata. That she was fully capable,
apart from ncr exclusive sources of informa
tion, ol being his tutor may be judged from
an estimate ot her character made by Beck
ford, a contemporary writer, who said of her:
"She was artiul; and no wonder, she had
been trained at the court of Naples, a fine
â  school for an English woman of auy stamp."
As for h:s own wifo, whom he had left be-
I hind in England, there can be little doubt that
i Nelson's estrangement from her was caused by
i nothing more serious than a lack of sympathy
I between the two. Yet several times in his |
j correspondence tie took occasion to speak in
! the highest terms of Lady Nelson. Thus in a
| letter to Lord St. Vincent he writes: "I am
possessed of everytning which is valuable iv a
wife," and later he concludes a letter to her:
j "With every kind wish that a fond heart can
' frame, believe me, as ever, your most affection
; ate husband. M
Turn we now to the closing scenes in the
I life oi Nelson. In the chapters of Captain
Mahan's work entitled "The Antecedents of
Trafalgar," and 'Trafalgarâ The Death ot Nel
â  son," our author has narrated historical
i events with consummate accuracy and skill.
j Every point made and every position taken i
1 by the opposing fleets is elucidated in the j
i clearest possible manner with the use of dia- j
. grama. The smallest details of the attack are
presented â even to the position of the wind on
i that memorable day in October, 1805.
The day belore the battle of Traialgar, Nel
i son spent niiicU of his time on the poop of the
Victory. Addressing himself to a numbar
of midshipmen, the admiral said: "This day
or to-morrow will be a fonunate one for you,
young gentlemen." alluding to their prospect
of promotion after a suocessiul battle. The
.same day at dinner he said to some of the
company: "10-morrow I will do that which
will give you younger gentlemen something
to talc and think about for the rest of your
lives, but I shall not live to know about it my
self." He added that be expected to capture
twenty to twenty-two of the hostile fleet.
This anecdote, it may here be said, is related
by Captain Mahan as a new one, it having
been to.d to him by the son of a man who was
present when Nelson's prophecy was made.
In fairness to the author we shall not dis
figure the text descriptive of the actual
battle, so ably and thoroughly done, by mak
ing short excerpts from the same. One inci
dent, however, should be touched upon, view
ing it as an illustration of tbe ruling passion
lhat is strong even in death. Always a prayer
ful man, it seems strange to read of Nelson's
solicitude for and invocations to the Deity in
behalf of the object of his unholy affection.
"Take care of my dear Lady Hamilton," he be
. sought Hardy continually; n.ad to the attend
; ant, Dr. Scote: "Doctor, I have not Been a
| great sinner. Remember that I leave Lady
i Hamilton as a legacy to my country."
The substantial results of the battle having
! been made known to him, Nelson was dis
| tinctly beard to murmur, "Thank God, I
I have done my duty," and these words, says
I his biographer, "sealed the closed book of
Nelson's story with a truth broader and deeper
thau he himself could suspect. His duty was
I done and its truth perfected."
Tho entry in tne log book of the Victory un
: der date Octobsr 21, 1805, is brief and rugged :
I "Partial tiring continued until 4:30, when a
; victory having been reported to the Rignt
! Honourable Lord Viscount Nelson, X.8., he

first the place of reunion. After a while a res

table was set. The first to drop out was Flau

Tourgueneff pasted away three years later.
Dwell, If you can, on the number of pounds
of coal Miss Braddon has burned or caused to

Zola, long ago in the Figaro, acknowledged
how much he was indebted to Tourgueneff. It
was at the beginning of Zola's literary career.
He had written something about politics In
Le Corsair, and the Due de Broglie had exer
cised the censorship, and the article was sap
pressed. "Not a newspaper would print a
line of mine. I was perishing with hunger,
and they were all throwing mud at me. It
was then that Tourgueneff took me in hand
and introduced me to Russia." Those who
have followed M. Zola may remember that
"La Faute de l'Abbe Mouret" was pub.isb.ed in
Russian before it appeared in French,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1597.
HOW EPIRIS WAS LOST.
Later reports indicate that the Greek col
lapse in Eplrus was a miserable fiasco, and the
people who paid to see some real generalship
and some clever infighting are entitled to
have their money refunded at the box-office,
says the Washington Post.
â  The first day the Greeks had much the best
of the argument. Steve Crane lea the profes

leaded two-step and caught the Turks nap
ping.
While Crane's forces engaged the enemy in
front Rudyard Kipling and his command at
tacked the Turkish rear, and by a syndicate
prearrangement these two valorous leaders
worked the deadly parallel column on the de
moralized foe.
There was a bright Grecian streak in the
atmosphere, and the bookmakers were giving
remarkable odds on the fight.
When the second day's fighting opened
everybody said it was a Grecian cinch in a
walk, and Grecian money went begging.
When the firing opened between tho out
posts at Penteplghadia the welcome word was
carried to the managing editors of the battle
that Richard Harding Davis, fully provisioned
and highly pajamaed, was bearing down on
the enemy on the right at the head of a band
of Evzones, who were armed with the Reming
ton strip.
At this juncture of the struggle the Turks
began to feel like 30 cents and other small
change.
The strategic 'dangle was playing to boat
the band, and the Turks were fanning the at

mosphere In great shape, going out In one
two-three order.
Up to this time it was what Hazel Kirke
would call pretty work.
Then came ths crisis.
It was none of your off-hand, special-salo
day crisis. Nor did it partake ot the stereo
typed, the villain-approaches stage effect. It
was one of those deliberate, well written and
carefully revised affairs, and it marked the
turn in the battle with a ghastly, blue-pencil
appearance.
When victory had secured a little airship
exhibition, and was about to utilize the
Grecian banners for perching purposes, the
startling announcement was made that, owing
to the breaking down of the press, Sylvester
Scovel would be unable to make the expected
attack on tne Turkish left flank.
It was a crisis that tried the space-work
souls of the entire command.
Retreat without an effort meant dishonor,
while an advance under the circumstances
might mean annihilation. After a short con
ference it was decided there would be no back
pedaling, and the order to advance was tele
phoned up and down the line.
Blucber Scovel could have saved the day,
but his messenger-boyishness prevented.
With * migaty roÂ«r the contendir>g;forees
clashed, and the sight that followed would
have caused a circulation war to go off in some
quiet nook and weep highly salted tears over
its own insignificance.
Above the terrible din of battle could be
heard the inspiring bluck-face, double-pica
shrieks oi tlie valorous leaders as they urged
their men to fight. (To describe this scene
properly would be a gross plagiarism, on John
L. Sullivan's story of Mrs. Fitzsimmons' heroic
work at Car3on City.)
The roar of the Mergenthalers was terrific
as they poured the hot lead into the matrices
and made history at the usual space rates.
There was an occasional pause, when the
sharp clicking of the typewriters showed they
were getting in their work on the Turks in
much the same manner they did up that Chi
cago banker.
In the last half of the ninth inning, with
two men out, two strikes on Edhcm Pasha, not
a Turk on the bases and the crowd leaving the
grand stand, came the blow that killed father.
Edhem was desperate and, making a vicious
swipe at a paragraphic inshoot, he caught it
for three bases.
A sickly yellow kiddish expression took pos
session of the face of the Greek pitcher. It
was plain to be seen that he had contracted a
complication of the glass arm, charleyhorse
and punctured nerve.
A passed ball, a base on balls, another hit,
a wide throw by the shortstop, and the Greek
demoralization was complete. The Turts
trotted around the bases like intoxicated
sailors on a merry-go-round.
The score ana the plot thickened like news
paper office paste in warm weather. The
groans'of the dead and wounded were remark
able, particularly those of the dead. (Ar
rangements are in progress to have these new
things in groans produced on the phono
graph.)
But why prolong the awful recital? There
was nothing for the Greeks to do but fall back
to Arta. Thus was the horrible retreat Inau
gurated.
The quarters of these gallant commanders
looked as if they had boen visited by one of
those individuals who occaiionally drop in to
whip the editor. AH was confusion and next
morningish.
As the demoralized column approached the
suourbs of Arta and managed to fight through
the lines of the fakers engaged in selling war
relics, there burst upon them a specter of the
illuminated supplement variety. For a few
moments they were dazed.
As it approached it grew nearer, and sud
denly they recognized General Miles. He was
accompanied by his full uniform and staff of
stenographers, topographers and photogra
phers.
Reluctantly they told General Miles of their
defeat. He wanted them to turn and make a
final rally against the Turks, but they respect
fully and firmly declined to respond to the
encore.
This is the true story of the rout at Epirus.
Historians and General Miles' official re
port may be able to make a better
showing for the Greeks, and some peo
ple who are continually poking about
in war records may try to squara Sylvester
Blucher Scovel, but these are the stubborn
ana tantalizing facts.
The next day the Grecian sugar market
slumped eight points, and there were heavy
declines all along the line.
The price of the Overland Monthly has been
fixed at 10 cents.
THE TYPICAL AMERICAN NOVEL.
We are not looking for an American novel
as distinct from an English or a French or a
Scandinavian or an Italian or a Grseco-Roman
novel. We think that the resources of fiction
writing are just as thoroughly well known as
they ever will be; that nil the appliances of
the art have been discovered and tested long
ago; that no amount of taking thought will
add a single item to the technical equipment
which is at the servico oi every novelist to
day ; aud that whenever a really great novel
is produced, it is great because of the man be
hind the book and not because of any five-spun
theory which the book itself exemplifies.
Nevertheless, from another point of view, one
may truly speak of the American novel as a
thing apart, because of the great difficulty in
the conditions that attend its successful com
positiou. The American novel, as we under
stand it, is not to be a novel constructed on
hitherto unheard-of lines, or by some new
formula thoughtfully evolved by American
writers; but a novel that shall give an ade
quate and accurate delineation of the life that
is lived only in this huge, loose-hung, colossus
of a country â a kind of life to which the his
tory of the world affords no parallel whatever.
When the Englishman or when the French
man sits down to write a novel his back
ground is, in a way, already rilled in, and it is
only figure- painting that he has to do.
But how strangely different is the cesa with
one who seeks to fix upon his canvas a true
impression of American life. A vast kaleido
scopic mass of color lies before him, shifting
and changing with every touch, a society in a
fluid state, heterogeneous, anomalous, bizarre
and shot all through with a million piquant
incongruities. The boundless wealth and the
squalid poverty, the spiendor aud the crudity,
the magnificence and the cheapness, the reck
lessness and conservatism, the cynicism and
the faith, the intellectual keenness and the
unpseakable fatuity, the strong common-sense
and- the foolish gullibility, the defiant arro
gance and the patient meekness, the commer
cial acuteness and the political stupidity â can
anyone bring out all these wonderful contrasts
in the National character and yet preserve the
slightest trace of verisimilitude and probabil
ity? And the strange medley of humanity
âthe washerwoman of the diggings blossom
ing out into the grand dame who entertains
kings and gives her daughters in marriage to
princes, the young girl with her "chaste de
pravity," the emancipated woman, the caual
boy lighting his way to the headship of the
nation, the keen-eyed business man who is to
day cornering the market and to-morrow
haranguing the Senate and the day after
bringing out an edition of a classic, the curi
ous bits of foreign life and custom embedded
In the midst of an Anglo-Saxon people, and
underneath <t all a great compact mats of
strong and simple and conservative men and
women, bearing up the rest and giving cohe
sion and stability to the whole structure.
Any one can tell ot all these things ; any one can
sketch them separately and in detail; but who
is able Rnrt who will ever be able to give one
luminous picture of them as a single entity,
each in its true relation to the rest, with a
sense of proportion and relativity, and in Â»uco
a way as to make one see and feel the truth of
it all?
No Â«uch problem ever before confronted the
novelist: yet it is not until this problem has
been BOlved that the American novel in its
largest sense will have an actual existence.
To begin with, there is not even such a thing
as an American type. There Is a New England
type, and there is a Southern type, and there
is a Far Wesiern type, but even these are not
perfectly defined, but shade off into each
other, while between them lie all sorts of indi
vidual and quite distinctive groups which an
American easily recognizes, even though he
cannot so easily describe them. These people
do not even speak an absolutely identical lan
guage, but display such dialectic variations
as make the difference of habita: Immediately
perceptible to the ear of a native. Our writers
understand tho complicated difficulties that
beset the one who tries to limn in a large
way the life and attributes of the Ameri
can people; and hence it is that
they have given us, in the main, not
the American novel, but novels written in
America, which Is a very different thiug. It
is not likely that any better work will be done
thau much of that which already revealÃ
some oi the strange nooks and corners of
American life. No one, for example, could
show a subtler knowledge of New England
than Miss Wilkins brings to her intensely
vital delineations; no one will ever make us
feel more intensely the spirit ol the Northwest
than Uamlin Garland does; no one will better
draw tne dull, raw life of the little towns of
Central and Western New York than Harold
Frederic; no one will have a fuller under
standing of certain phases of existence in the
American metropolis than has Brinder Mat
thews. But who is to come forth equipped
with the knowledge and the insight and the
vivid power necessary to draw the picture as
a whole and with a master's touch to fling
before us the gieat National cosmos in its
entirety â vital, convincing, real? â Harry
Thurston Peck in the Bookman.

to make it such. The Ltpplncotts are excep

ON DESULTORY READING.
A man of great in lellectual vigor declared
not lone ago that be bad foresworn newspaper
and novel reading and taken up the stiff eat sort
of metaphysics because he found be was losing
tbe habit of prolonged attention. Too much
newspaper and novel reading had begun to
show their evil effects. It Is a serious ques
tion whether tbe ability to bold the mind to
one line of thought has not been diminished
by the inconsequence of frivolity of too much,
of the matter which appears in the average
newspaper.
As a ruie, men who do serious intellectual
work give a very limited time to tbe newspa
per, and read novelsâ apart, of course, from
the masterpiecesâ as a recreation. Bright
ness, cleverness and quickness are very enter
tÃinlng whan one Is dealing in a discursive
fashion with a variety of unrelated subjects;
but when it comes to real grappling with any
question or subject, one ounce of concentra
tion is worth a pound of versatility.
This is one reason why so few people rela
tively read the great books. With such uu
caiculatcd resources within reach It seems
strange that tbe half dozen of books of the
first class should remain closed to an in
numerable company who have only to put
out their hands to possets them. The expla
nation lies in the fact that these great books
make certain demands on their readers and
that tbe great majority of those who read are
not willing to put forth any energy. They do
not expect toco-operate with a writer; they
expect to be diverted or carried along by him.
.Nothing which goes below the surface of the
mind awakens any response in them, be
cause they have never developed the power of
attention; or, if they have possessed it, they
have lost it by too much desultory and discur
sive reading. Such readers have lost the fac
ulty of following a line of thought. "One may
be a devourer of books," writes John Morley,
"and be actually incapable of reading a hun
dred lines of the wisest and most beautiful.
* * â¢ To the besotted gambler on the turf
the lonely hillside glowing with heather
grows to be as dreary as a prison; and so, too,
a man may listen nightly to burlesques till
'Fidello' inflicts on him intolerable fatigue."
Tbe newspaper disperses attention, so to
speak, over a wide field by presenting a great
number ot subjects on the same plane of in
terest; the average novel relieves the mind of
any necessity of co-operation with the writer;
it asKs the reader to be entirely uassive; to sit
on a cushioned seat at the stern while another
rows the boat. No wise man will leave
his newspaper unread ; and no man who
j cares for literature or who needs diversion
1 will put tbe novel out of his library. The
trouble with the newspaper is that
I we give it too much time, and the trouble
i with the novel is that It is generally without
literary quality, and that we read it too olten.
The great novels, being literature, cannot be
read too frequently; they demand something
of tbe reader; they do r.ot pauperise him In
tellectually by giving without exacting a re
turn. Readers who have accustomed them
selves to habitual reading of inferior stories
find "Henry E-smond" dull, and "The Cloister
and the Hearth" prolix. To such readers
"Wilhelm MeiÂ«ter" snd "On the Heights" are
stretches of arid sand. They care for nothing
which they cannot possess by merely glancing
at the page.
Now, this dissipation of the power of tbe
mind to do its proper work is due unquestion
ably, in many cases, to the habit of newspaper
and novel reading. When a reading publto
has lowered its taste and its Intellectual vi
tality to such a point that it asks only to be
amused and resents any endeavor to awaken
thought it has lost the power of appreciating
real literature and shut itself off from the
higher educational influences. The reading
habit is often spoken ol in this country as if it
were a good thing in itself: as a matter of fact
it is often a ready means 01 mental demorall
zation. The people who read nothing but the
trivialities and vulgarities which fill the col
umns of too many American newspapers, or
! who stupefy themselves with a succession ot
trashy novels, would better not read at all.
The illiterate man of good powers of natural
observation is a far more intelligent person
thin the man who reads tbe padding and
stuffing of the average newspaper which falls
into his hands.
It is at this point that cheap Journalism and
fiction come into direct collision with litera
ture; they cannot touch its quality, but they
can and do diminish the general capacity to
understand and enjoy it. They develop such
slovenly mental habits and they so relax the
muscles of the mind that mental activity of
every kind seems a hardship and becomes, In
too many cases, impossible. Audiences which
have grown accustomed to cheap humor or
tawdry declamation lose the power of appre
ciating or enjoying really noble speaking. A

A Hero.
General George B. McClellas.
I was not born until after the Presiden
tial campaign of 1864, so that my earliest
recollections of my father are of a time
when he had left the army forever, and
had temporarily, at least, retired from
politics.
1 first remember him as the kind, loving
father ot a very delicate little boy, whom
he watched over and cared for with the
tenderness of a woman. Next I remember
him as an elder brother rather than as a
father, always ready to sympathize with
my sorrows, and always willing to share
my pleasures.
I never knew him to lose his temper,
and I never heard him say an angry
word. Through all his troubles â and
they were many â despite all the abuse
showered upon him by his enemies, he
was always the same guileless, unostenta
tious, lovable Christian gentleman. .Asl
look back at him as he was during the
twenty years of our friendship, I than*
God that he was spared long enough for
me to have known him and to have had
his example as a father and a friend.
My first definite recollection of my
father is at a dinner he gave to bis corps
commanders and staff on the seventh an-
General George B. McClelland.
niversary of Antietam. My nurse carried
me downstairs wrapped in an afgban
wrought by Borne patriotic woman, as a
gift, in the semblance of an American flag.
After making several desperate plunges
ai the heads of several eminent generals I
was deposited on my father's, knee and
my health was drank, to my great inter
est and surprise.
On my way upstairs I asked my nurse,
"Who were those gentlemen dining with
papa?" "Officers," answered my nurse,
who never encouraged idle curiosity; and
to my shame be it said, visionsof William
B. Franklin, Fitz John Porter and Win
field Scott Hancock floated through my
mind, clad in blue policemen's coats and
bearing sticks. For such is the race of
nurses that up to that time the police of
ficer on our beat was the only kind of
officer 1 knew.
Our home wag at Orange, N. J., in a
house that my father had built, having
drawn his own plans and been his own
architect. He took a tremendous amount
of interest in that bouse, and thoroughly
enjoyed working over it. Tdere was never
a piece of china broken that my father
did not mend; and he delighted to be his
own carpenter in repairing the ordinary
wear and tear.
I remember that after several dismal
faiJures in the way of leaky roofs he rev
eled in the possession of a brand-new tin
one. ''It won't cost much more than a
much cheaper roof," Le said, "for I in-,
tend to paint it myself," and so he did.
George B. McClelian, who had led half a
million men, spent five scorching hot
August days, paint brush in hand, work
ing on that roof.
I carried the paintpot and thought my
self very important. When the job was
finished, my father called in a neighbor
ing painter to inspect the results. The
painter, who wap an authority, closed one
*ye and laid. "Well, general, that's a
nrettv smart job." And I think that my

father was almost a? ranch pleased at his
approval as he was when he won Antie
tani.
He always had half a dor n dogs about
the place, bat his favorite pm was old Dan
Webster, a sixteen-hand bay horse who
had been given him by some New York
gentlemen just before "the seven days."
For the last ten years of his life Dan never
did a stroke of work. He was popularly
known in the army as "that Devil Dan,"
and he was always worthy of the name.
Dan bad just passed his twenty-eighth
birthday. He had celebrated it as he
usually celebrated important events in bis
later career â by slipping his halter and
running away. His great age and quiet
country life ought to have made him re
spectable, but I am sorry to say that he
never recovered from the demoralizing
effects of army life.
Toward evening, as was hia wont, Dan
quietly trotted home and ate his feed with
an enthusiasm worthy of New Jersey oats.
Then, without any apparent reason, be
lay down, as it afterward appeared, for the
last time.
Whan Dan heard my father coming to
him he roused himself and tried to get up
and stand at attention, like the good old
soldier he was. He tried again, but his
strength was going, and he fell back and
whinnied plaintively as his master sat
cown in the straw beside him.
There was nothing the matter with Dan
bnt old age. He had lived twenty-eight
years, and when his time came he gave up
his life uncomplainingly, as a soldier
should.
My father took Dan's head in his lap
and sat there most of the night, scratch
ine the old horse's ears and feeding him
sugar, lump by lump. At 3 o'clock in the
morning Dan refused his twenty-lir3t
lump of sugar, "The end hag come,"
said his master. And so Dan died; his
two ruling passions strong in deathâ his
love for his general ana his fondness lor j
lump sugar.
We buried him the next morning in a
great hole that had been dug beside a
rock in the garden. We children rather
enjoyea the funeral, but my father did
not. He shoveled on the eartn himself,
and as we left the grave I wondered why
he seemed so much affected and why he
said "Good-hy, old friend; good-by, my
dear old Devil Dan."
My father put off sending me to school
as long as he could. I know that leaving
him was a wrencn to me, and I thintc thai
he felt the parting as much as I did. He
chose a school for me on the Hudson,
chiefly, I fancy, because it was a military
school. As a graduate of West Point he
firmly believed that no man could suc
cessfully battle with life without at least a
rudimentary knowledge of the manual of
arms and minor tactics.
On our way up to Sing Sing he was very
silent, bnt as we neared our journey's end
he said:
"I suppose, boy, that I should give you
the usual fatherly advice on leaving a son
at school. I don't know exactly what to
say to you. I have always tried to do my
duty, and I think that I have done it.
Make up your mind what you tnink iÂ«
right, and then do it, no matter what it
costs you."
By this time we had reached our desti
nation. After introducing me to my
schoolmaster and inspecting my quarters
the time came for my father to leave me.
I had always kissed him before this when
I said good-by; but this day when he left
me he only took my hand and shook it
and said as he got into his cab, "You're a
man now, boy." He choked down what
was almost a sigh as be said it jk
Wnenlwent to college my fathef was
quite as much excited over this important
event in my life as I was myself. Noth
ing pleased him better than to come to
Princeton during term time and practi
cally to live the life of an undergraduate.
He took a great interest in athletics and
would almost rather have had me a suc
cessful athlete than a scholar. He was
himself a very powerful man and like all
strong men thought tbat the rest of the
world should be strong, too.
The name "Little Mac" given my father
by nil soldiers was more an expression of
endearment than description. He was
not s small man, although the great
breadth of his shoulders made him appear
shorter than he really was.
His height wa*s feet %y % inches in his
stocking feet. He had a cuest measure
ment of 45 inches inflated and he weighed
180 pounds.
It used to be a source of regret on my
part that ne had not been born in an age
of amateur athletics, for I naturally took
a tremendous amount of pride in his
strength. He not only in nis younger
days had the reputation of being the best
rider in the army, but also of being one of
its strongest officers. When at West Point
he could smash a three-quarter-inch door
panel with his naked fist, and was a capi
tal ambidextrous fencer.
Even in later life he kept his physique,
and weighed no more at the time of bis
death than he did a quarter of a century
earlier. When he was 50 years old I saw
him bend a dime double witt the thumb
and first two fingeis of his right hand.
He was an enthusiastic Alpine climber
and initiated me into the delights of tbat
greatest of all physical pleasures almost
as soon as I had left my nurse's apron
strings. We spent altogether seven sum
mers at St. Moritz, in the Engadine Val
ley of Switzerland, and he gradually edu
cated me up from almost level paths to the
hardest of ice work.
He loved flowers and never took a walk
without returning lauen with them. Hia
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.
favorite was the little star-shaped edel
weiss, that blossoms far above the snow
line, where no other flower dares grow.
When I was a little fellow, with an all
consuming ambition to pick an edelweiss
for myself, he took me to a bed of tbem
he had found and made me think that it
was my own discovery.
He used to keep a sort of journal of his
travels by pressing and mounting flowers
which he bad picked at almost every
place of interest he visited. He loved all
nature passionately, and beautiful
scenery seemed almost to take him out of
this world and fill him with a supreme
thankfulness for God's goodness in let
ting him live.
My father would have shared his last
crust of bread with any of his old soldiers
who stood in need of it He never turned
one of them from the door empty-handed,
for he loved them ai few mothers love
their children. He not only cared for tbem
"HE WAS MORE THAN A SOLDIER TO THEM."
as any army, and as a memory of the
past, but he seemed to have a personal,
individual love for every one of them.
The last time he ever met any large
number of his comrades was on the Deco
ration day before he died, when he deliv
ered an oration at the National Cemetery
at Antietam to a gathering of Union and
Confederate veterans. He had never been
back to the scene of the greatest battle of
our history since be had won it, and,
strangely enough, what was practically
his last appearance in public was made
here.
The ovation he received pleased him ex
ceedingly; and yet, surrounded as he was
by the graves of more than five thousand
of hi men, his journry had been almost
like a piKtrimaee to the grave of a favorite
child. When lie looked upon the acres of
little white headstones about him his first
words came straight from his heart, "Oh,
my poor boys, my poor boysl"
Remarkable as my father was as a pub
lic man, he was even more extraordinary
in his private life. He possessed the
power of making all who knew him love
him. Tliere was nothing coarse in his
nature; in fact, he was wonderfully part
minded. He had a strong sense of
humor, and could always appreciate a
joke. Yet, without being straight-laced,
anything vulgar or indecent actually hurt
aim.
Ho was always a sincere Christian, in
small things as well as in great, and
taught his children that religion was not
a mere matter of form, but a practical
working rule to guide and aid them in
ereryday life. His lore of God and his
desire to do his duty carried him safely
through temptations and trials that
would have made a smaller man falter.
"God's will be done," was the motto of
His life; and coming in contact with him
it vras impossible not to be impressed with
the loftiness and grandeur of his nature.
He always saw the best side of life and of
people, and tried to make his children
feel with him tnat there was no man so
baa as not to have tome good in him.
iWs!
He never became cynical, and never bore
malice. He was quick to sympathize, and
ready to listen and eive advice to any one
who asked him for it. My father was the
most manly man I have ever known. â By

Oh, little children, dwelling to-day

THE LETTER
BOX
Sebastopol, Cal., May, 1897.
.Dear Editress: As my other letter was not
printed I shall write again. Oar school is just
going to last five weeks longer. Our teacher's
name is Miss Clary.
The people of Santa Rosa had a carnival on
the 15th of this month. They had a queen
and decorated floats.
I read all the stories that are printed on the
Children's Page. I think they all are fine.
The story about Rob's journey was very in
teresting. The poppy page of Thk Call I
think was beautiful. We have some poppiea
growing in our yard. Your little friend,
Annie Elphick.
Dear Editress: I am a little girl of 10 years ,
and my parents have taken The Call for a long
time. I enjoy the children's page very much.
I am going to tell you about a visit I paid to
lowa about four years ago during the latter
part of May.
My mother, little brother and myself went
back East to attend the World's Fair, and after
enjoying its wonders and beauties for many
days, we went to visit my grandmother, who
lives with my uncle on a beautiful farm In
lowa, and we arrived a few days before Deco
ration day.
I wish I conld describe to you how very
lovely the farm is. Along one side runs a
range of hills, through which flows a stream
of pure, clear water.
High cliffs tower on either side. Along the
banks grow tall walnut trees, their spreading
branches reflected in the clear waters below.
The cliffs were covered with a luxuriant
growth of ferns, vines and the most beautiful
wila flowers that I ever saw.
The day before Memorial day we gathered
great baskets of wild honeysuckle, mar
guerites, lady slippers and ferns. In the even-
Ing: mamma wove them into wreaths and gar
lands.
After breakfast the next morning: my nncle
took as to town in a large three-seated car
riage, and when we arrived we found the
streets already filled with people. The bands
played and the procession formed.
We fell into place and the long line of car*
riages wound elowiy along to the cemetery
while we listened to the sweet strains oi
music, a: (i the air was heavy with the
fragrance of the flowers.
After hearing the Impressive words of the
speakers we reverently laid onr beautiful
wreaths on my dear soldier grandpa's grave.
It was a sweet day, which I shall never en
tirely forget. I was prompted to write you
this letter by your pretty Mayday page, and I
hope soon to be a member of the C. R. C.
Your constant reader, Emma Dulfkr.
Dear Editress: Memorial day Is a day we
keep in memory of the noble men who fought,
bled and died for their country. On this day
we decorate the soldiers' graves as beautifully
as possible to show that we have not forgotten
them though they are now dead. Yours truly,

Deas Editress: I live in the beautiful city
of Santa Cruz, situated on Monterey Bay. It
is surrounded by summer resorts, and has a
fine view of the mountains, ocean and bay,
and has a lovely beach.
With this I will send a selected paragraph
for Memorial day and a puzzle for next Sun

The woods are full of wild flowers such at
snow-lily bells, painter's brush, poppies, etc.
I remain yours truly,

Dear Editress and Readers: I have been
working all day for the children's page, and
now i shall take the pleasure of writing a
letter to my friends.
I have been going to school, bat as this Is
institute week we have vacation. My teach
er's name is Miss Callie M. Coomb?. I like
her very much, she is such a good teacher.
Do you remember that little Kansas boy who
was so sick and whose name was Willie Zim
merman? Well, he has passed away from|tne
cares and sorrows of this world. I received a
very sweet lettor from his mamma, telling of

his death, about a week ago. I am so glad
that I learned of that near boy when I did,
and for this knowledge I must thank Kva
Navone.
I like my badge very much. I think it is
worth while working very, very hard if after
ward we can own such a lovely badge. I take
great pleasure in wearing mine to school.
From your little friend,

San Pablo, Cal., May 17. 1897.
Dear Editress: I shall write again, as I did
not see my last letter published. I should
like to belong to the C. R. C. Club, so I shall
send you a puzzle which I made up, and hope
it will please you and the members of the C.
R. C. I have a little sister since I wrote to
you last, and her name is Myrtle. She is very
cunning, and is just three months old. It is
lovely in the country now, every thing is green
and the fields are thick with wild flowers. We
are rolng to have examinations next week, so
I have to study hard, as I wish to be promoted.
I still have my pet cat Minnie that I wrote
you about, and alto my bird Goldie. I shall
close for this time. From your little friend,
Elsie Davis.
Zelda, Churchill Co., Nev., May 18, 1897.
Dear Little Friends of the C. R. C.: I wrote to
you two weeks ago, but my letter was not pub
lisned, so I thought I would write again.
I lire at a railroad station; we have no trees
nor grass. There are two engines here to help
trains up the hill. It is a very dull little
place, and I don't like it much. There are
onlf four children here, and we have no
school.
I have a little sister named Erma. Mamma
teaches us. Erma can read a little. If you
publish this I shall write a longer letter next
time. Your friend, Irene Maud Conkey.
Calistoga, Cal., May 23, 1897.
Dear Editor and Headers of Childhood's Realm:
Doubtless many of you remember a little boy,
Willie Zimmerman, whom I wrote to you
about a long time ago. Well, poor little Willie
is dead now. I have Just received a letter
from his mother stating that he died April 30.
Even in his last hours here on earth he did not
forget the little friends whd lted written to
him, and whose letters had helped to pass the
weary hours when he was confined to his bed
or obliged to sit in a chair. I write this to you
because I thought you would like to know.
Dear Editor. I thank you for publishing my
little poem. To-day I send for a badge. Your
friend, M. Eva Navone (C. R. C).
Gertrude, Madera Co., Cal., May 17, 1891.

Saw Mill, May 16. 1897.
Dear Mr*. Richards: Unas been some time
since I have written to The Call. Since I
wrote last I hurt the tendons of my knee by
being thrown from my skees. I could not
walk for a while. We are spending the sum
mer at Luce's mill, and it is a lovely place.
There are immense sugar pine, pitch pine and
yellow pine trees around here, and in the fall
of the year the yellow pine drops great cones
full of juicy nuts. Just now the red bells, wild
forgei-me-nots, Indian pinks, wild roses, pan
sies, tulips, dog-tooth violets, larkspurs, dog
wood, cherries, plums, pink Dutchman's,
breeches and snooting stars are all out in
full bloom, filling the air with sweet fra
grance.
While we are here mamma lets my sister
and I go to school and we take our doe "Sport"
with us. As ours is an ungraded school there
is but one room. So "Sport" goes in and lies
down under my desk and there stays. When
recess, noon or 4 o'clock comes he gets up and
marches out with the scholars. lam going to

The last flicker of the waning season is i
going out in New York and actors and ac- 1
tresses are packing their trunk 3 prepara- :
tory to going to "summer snaps," or to ;
Europe, the former for remuneration, the ;
latter for ideas. San Francisco is the i
summer-snap actor's paradise, for here he j
knows there is no sweltering on roof car
dens, no crying necessity for fans and ic?d
drinks. Society is out of town during the I
dog days, out what of that? Plenty of peo- j
pie are left who find the theater as pleasant
a place for spending the evening at mid- i
Bummer as at Christmas. So the snmmer
enap actor is waitinc to come here cheap
and put on less airs in a month than he!
puts on in a day during tne regular New i
York season.
Heaven forbid that I should point Â».o
any star, or galaxy of stars, and say: |
"These ere summer-snap actors." That j
would be as unjust a proceeding as to call j
every daintiiy-clad damsel one meets a I
summer eirl. Summer girls are proverbi
ally faithless, and summer-snap actors â 
fold their tents like the Arabs and steal!
back to New York when the neat dimin
ishes. But the summer-snap actor is to j
be with us this season, and we shall all
be heartily glad to welcome him, more I
particularly if we realize that the time is j
not far distant when San Francisco may
begin to cease being looked upon as the !
softest of all soft summer snaps.
"The conquest of England by the Ameri
can actor" â that is the latest dream of
actor-, managers and authors since the
news was flashed across the Atlantic of
the triumph achieved in London by Gil
lette's 'Secret Service." American plays I
have straggled into London bjfore now, ;
but "Secret Service" is the first that has'
come within a mile of setting the Thames j
on fire. "The Girl I Left Behind Me" j
was produced about two years ago in Lon- !
don, with English actors, and made a .
tepid sort of success. "A Trip to China
town,' 1 "My Friend Froai India," "Chris- !
topber Jr.," "The Prodigal Father" and j
others have been localized and played I
with more or less â generally less â success ;
by English actors. Neil Burgess is at
present giving "Th* County Fair" at a j
suburban London theater with his Ameri- J
can company, and the critics and public j
reeard it with mild curiosity as a .
"Yankee" curio. But "Secret Service," |
produced by a New York company of j
American actors, is a real rousing sue- j
cess. Even Clement Scott, the caustic
critic of the London Daily Telegraph, re
marks:
The latest American success in London is
"Secret Service," with its author, William Gil
lette, and his native compauy as interpreters. |
Of course there will be much of unfavorable !
matter written about this production, but !
irom til accounts it will find general favor.
Charles ironman caDles to the Mirror an ex
-1 pression of Clement Scott of the London Tele-
Eraph as to this play. Mr. Scott 6aid : "It is a
great success It fascinated us. It is the best
example we have ever seen of harmonious,
easy, wel. -balanced acting. Visits from such
a company with such a p:ay do us good.
They %vake us up Instead of taking the bread
out of the mouths of English actors and
authors."
Charles Frohraan ia the commander-in- I
chief ol the American actors lor the con* j
quest of England, and the seasons play ,
into his hands. The height of the Lon
don season is jmt about beginning as the
Nev. - York season ia drawing to a close,
and siars will find it less fatiguing 1o step
an board a Liverpool or Southampton
bound Atlantic liner than to spin across
the continent in the heat anddtbt. "I
{rues* we will all have a look in," said N.it |
Goodwin yesterday, in speafeing of the j
success of "Secret Service." "Charley
Frohnian intends to play Drew, De Wolf
Hopper and E. H. Sothern in London be
fore very long, and I'll have a try there I
myself, too." Goodwin has played suc
cessfully in London before, but lie intends
to be in the swim and try it again.
That is the one -crumpled rose leaf in
the promising outlook for the conquest of j
England by the American actor â the
fancy of stars will lightly turn to thoughts j
of fume in London, and San Francisco j
will cease to be regarded as the softest
Bummer snap on earth. Marie Eyely.v.

Golumbia Jheater.
The new Frawley Company opens its
season at the Columbia Theater to-mor
row night with Hadden Chambers' melo
drama, "The Fatal Card. 'â¢ An elaborate
scenic production is promised. There is
a strongly marked love romance running
through the play, which is said to contain
more human interest than most melo
dramas. The hero is placed in many
dangerous pobitions, and i as such a des
perate light to riohi himsell and win his
sweetheart that the usual melodramatic
demerit of suspense is well in evidence.
In the last act a younp man has tracked
the murderer of his fa:her, and discovers
tbat tue father of his affianced wife is the
guilty man. He is caught by the band of
which the murderer is the head, and,
bound to a post, is about to be killed by
an infernal machine, when the girl'i
father finds in the lover's pocket one-half
of the ace of clubs. Th:s torn card was
siven by the murderer some years before
to the lover, who had lescued him from a
mob of lynchers in the Itocky Mountains.
In an attempt to remove the infernal ma
chine and save the lover's life, the father
is blown to pieces, which is a very expe
ditious and melodramatic way of dispos
ing of an undesirable father-in-law-elect.
The full cast of "The Fatal Card" is as
follows; Frank Worming, J. M. Colyiile,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 30, 1897.

HE Â»JRAN y\WAy.
HoW Frank Valerga Escaped the
Horror of Citizenship at pVesi
der\t Kruger's Hands.
Frank Valerga says that to fight and
run away is not such a bad principle when
you have no interest in the result of the
fisht, but he thinks that a better principle
is to run away before the light comes off
at all. Valerga speaks from experience,
for if he hart not departed from Johannes
burg without standing on the order of his
going it is his opinion that instead of
singing with the Philharmonic Society at
the Baldwin to-night be might have been
chanting with angelic choirs.
It is not far short of a decade since
Frank Valerga leit the Tivoli and went
East with the "Said Pasha" company.
From that time till now he lias never been
heard in opera in this City, tnough he has
almost circumnavigated the globe with
different operatic companies and has met
witn many exciting adventures by the
way.
For a number of months he beloneed to
a stock operatic company at the Gaiety
Theater, Johannesburg, and ii was only a
playful little habit the Boers have of en
listing alien residents to fi^ht in tbeir
foreign wars taut made him shake the
dust of the Transvaal cff his feet for ever.
"They may say what they like about
South Africa," be said yesterday, "but I
would rather be buried than live there.
The country is ail rocks, rich sand, lava
beds and ant hills, ana it makes Ameri
cans sick to see the way Boers and Eng
lish alikeSbuse the Kailir*. Beat them?
Why I have seen strips of flesh torn irom
the Kaffirs' arms and back with a great
whip ten yards long, that they use for
driving spans of oxen. In the cities it is
forbidden to pass through the street? with
an ox team without a Kaffir at ttie ani
mals' heads. It is no uncommon sight to
tee ibe owner of the team sit in his cart
and whirling, one of those ftraat whips
round, hit the Kaffir and maKe him jump
four feel in the air. The whip geueraliy
carries a<vay a. strip of liesh witn it.
"In a financial way we did well in the
Transvaal, for the Boer 3 arc very fond of
music, from the President downward, bat
music doe 3 not soften tne savage breast
\vi h them, as my adventures show. One
day I was sitting Id my room, a little bit
of an adobe place wnb. no windows and
only an opening in the wall for a door,
when six mounted police rode up and
i resented a scroll to me, which they com
manded me to sign, at the same fme de
manding 10 shillingsâ they ask 10 shil
lings for everything in the Transvaal. If
you have a sore throat they tine you 10
shillings. Thinking it was only a fine I
signed the scroll and paid the 10 shillings.
Afterward 1 found to my sorrow that I
had signed articles of enlistment to light
acainst Magetto, a Kaflir chief, who was
rebelling about L'so miles from Pretoria.
"There was no American Consul in
Johannesburg, but I went to G. L. Wil
liams, the assisiant Consul. 'I don't
want to tigbt, 1 I said, 'I am here to s'.ng
and have absolutely no cravings for the
joys of a warrior's life.'
" '1 cannot do anything to help you,'
3aid Mr. Williams. 'It's a case of fight or
set out, and if you take my advice you
will go, f.rthey will surely compel you to
tight if you remain.' Wei', it happened
that two days before five Englishmen had
been made to go to the front. I was
fricntened out of my life at the knowledge
that any moment I might have to do tne
same thing, so I made short tracks back
to Cape Town, where I was safe under
British rule.
"When the fighting had blown over I
went back to the Transvaal, to Pretoria,
for a short engagement, and there I saw
the five Englishmen coming back from
the front. At first they had refused to
tire on the Kaffirs, and the Borr3 had pun
is^he'l them by shutting them up in a cage
made of bamboo and feeding them on
bread and water. The cage was put over
i cart and looked something like the con
veyances we call prairie schooner*. After
i while they nave in and consented to fire
Dn the Kaffirs, but they were brought back
to Pretoria in the cage.
"I saw them arrive in Pretoria. One
bad his arm shot off, another had a muti
lated hand, anil soon all through the lot.
President Kruger rewarded them for their
bravery by conferring citizenship upon
them, which means a good deal in the
Transvaal, where you cannot take out
papers unless sou have been a resident
fifteen years, and even then citizenship is
hedged about with great difficulties'. I
should have been sorry to eet citizenship
at the price of fighting the KÂ«ffitÂ«, though,
and was not Ion? in clearing out of the
country for good."
Zirvk's X-Jta\j Lantern.
One of the funniest incidents in ' Merry-
Tramps," the spectacular production in
which the LUiputians will appear here on
Monday, June 7, at the Baldwin, is the
pantomime in the second act, in the course
of which Ebert takes a shower-bath. He
appears very nosy, reads the simboard on
the bathinp-home, and in expressive pan
tomime makes it plain that he lias decided
to have a bath. He takes off his hat, over
coat and coat, but on finding himself in
his shirtsleeves he gives a comical grimace
of moclc modesty and retires behind the
<-bed. His bare arms place several other
"arments into view. .After ii-? has retired
Zink enters carrying an X-ray lantern
which he turns toward the shower-bath,
the sides of which at once become trans
parent and disclose Eoert standing up
right, with his chubby oaclc bared to the
audience, and vigorously rubbing himself
as it in a stream of water. The ab.<urdit3"
of the scene generally arouses a roar oi
laughter. I

THE FAMOUS HAUNTED CELL IN THE MARIN COUNTY JAIL
It was late when we reached San Ra
fael, on our way to vi3it Marin County's
haunted cell. It had been a warm day,
and the air scintillated still with the heat,
and the trees languidly tried to fan them
selves after tne exertion of enduring. The
flowers glanced at us from between the
cracks, nodded over the fence tops and
showered their petals down from above,
welcoming us with the perfume of their
warm breath. The cool evening shadows
began to creep after us, doubtfully, like
naughty children who have stayed away
too long.
"Going to jail" is not the pleasantest
thing on earth, even with a clear con
science. 1 tried to fancy how one would
feel to be chained and led to a dungeon
along a pathway strewn with flowers,
with a load of sin upon his soul and tho
consciousness that the world knew of his
guilt. To endure hell in the midst oi
heaven must be no worse.
We paused on the lawn in front of the
Courthouse and viewed the prison from
without There were a few blank, staring
windows that contrasted strangely with
the green, smiling lawn. There was noth
ing unusaai about it. It was like all the
rest.
"Did you want the County Clerk?"
asked a voice at my elbow in dulcet tones.
Turning I saw an elderly gentleman
with a world of mischief in his eyes and
two dollars' worth of expectation in his
smile.

"Want to see the haunted cell and stay
there"; he spoke with a falling inflection,
eyed us and smiled cynically â the kind of
a smile that impresses you with the
owner's knowledge of the world and
human nature, and tells you plainly that
he thinks that you are a harmless lunatic
playing the part of a fool.
That is, a smile which is owned chiefly J
by politicians, although at times it is bor- j

At 18 Frances Lauphton was a dream
ing, blue-eyed girl, with firm blacfc brows
and rippling gold-brown hair. Intellect
was hers by birthright; poetry by the
grace of God.
"Mine was a silent, dreamy childhood,"
she says, "haunted by visions of impossi

We followed the Sheriff flown the
wooden steps and into the damp of the
prison . air. He showed us the cell of
Colonel Finigan and told us how he had
entered there a rich man and in a short
time had gone into the world again to go
through insolvency, and he smiled mean-
ingly again.
"Wbat will his wife dot"
"She can't do anything, now," he said,
as he turned away, "but she'll come out
all right. There's no getting away from a
woman."
Which may have been true â with ex
ceptions, as in all rules â but it was
scarcely polite.
The keys clanked unpleasantly as the
door was unlocked into the further corri
dor and the whitewashed walls gleamed
ghastly in the half light. We passed the
cell where the vagrant lay â an old man,
broken in body and soul, with pitiful, un
certain eyes and trembling hands.
He should have been resting in this
evening, after his battle of life, in the
shelter of love, hiding his scars and bear
ing the wounds until he should sink away.
She raised her children, cared for her
household, shared the reverses and suc
cesses of her husband's career, living the
while the poet's life of isolation, best de
scribed in her own lines:
In tbe house which is my own.
Though no living eye can read
The invisible title deed
Which makes it mine aloneâ
In the room where my heart and I
In still communion alt.
It adds nothing to her rare personality
that she early won and without effort re
i tamed recognition.
She published in Harper's Magazine and
| other periodicals of that class as well as
j for the great papers. Perhaps no woman
! has had more poems illustrated in Har
per's by the best artists in the same
length of time than Mrs. Mace between
the years of 1870 and 1890.
At the Bangor centennial in 1869 her
poem was selected to be sung.
Her friends like to remember that when
Portland unveiled the English bust of
Longfellow, presented to the Maine His
torical Association by the Longfellow me
morial committee, of which the Prince of
Wales was chairman, Mrs. Mace waÂ«
called upon for the dedicatory poem, and
responded with her fine "Welcome Home
to Longfellow.' 1
Tben, too, when the gentle Whittier
first met Mrs. Mace tie said: "In Bangor
I know but two persons, Hannibal Ham
lin and thee. I know him for his states
manship and I know thee for thy beauti
ful poems."
It is hard to tell of the catastrophe in
this beautiful lifeâ hard to recall that
under the strain of intense and conflict
ing activities of mind, heart and body,
the body, being weakest, gave way.
Worn out by the care of her youngest
daughter, an invalid, blue-eyed Juns
Mace, her "summer child," of whom she
writes, "Her days had been for laughter,
not for tears, " she iell ill of pneumonia,
which resulted in a stroke of paralysis.
Possessed of what should have been a
strong body, with a rich and trained in
tellect, present success assured and the
future beaming with promise, she was
forced to lay down her pen, as her friends
believed, forever.
But her indomitable mind did not
yield so easily. Long before the tiniest
muscle would respond to her will, her
brain resumed its work.
In her quiet hill cottage near Los Gatos
she is regaining a measure of physical
strength and freedom: above all, her pen
hand is again obedient, and she loves to
reach out toward other* shut in like her
self from "life's sweet work and liberty."
She looks upon this as the one way left
her of serving the humanity she loves â
this woman, whose simple act of living is
a service to the world.
From her broad window she gazes with
far-seeing eyes bayond picturesaue Santa
Giara Valley, beyond stately Mount Ham
ilton, to where she sees a great stone house
beside the blue Peaobscot, where, she
says. "I see again beloved faces, missed
forever from my life. I cannot forget, but
I think I shall find content in this pretty
home among the hills."

instead of lying on an iron cot in a dank
cell, alive and unfriended, his food the
prison fare served to him in rusted tins.
"Bad luck, pardner!"
He sat up and looked at us and swayed
his body back and forth in feeble assent.
"Go wy from here," he said ; "'tis not

Then he lay back and closed his eyes,
while I looked longingly toward the

There were two large cells opening into

two tanks or dark cells. We went into
the inner one and looked about. A more

THE GHOST AS IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SEEN.
THE RICHEST MAN IN ALL AMERICA.
SPOKANE, Wash., May 26, 1897.â As I
I was lounging in the lobby of the Hotel'
Spokane this morning I noticed an elderly j
man, with a newspaper carelessly folded I
on his lap. He is atypical frontiersman,
miner and prospector, tail, buie-ered,
stoop shouldered, iron-cray hair and un- |
kempt whiskers. He was in a good humor
with himself and all the world aud was
easily engaged in conversation.
"lam here from Montana," he stated,
as he called my attention to a paragraph
in the Anaconda Standard in regard to W.
A. Clark's fabulous strike in the May
Flower district.
"I knew it was bound to leak out some
time," he added, "and have been sur
prised that it was kep^ from the news
paper sharps so long. You will see that
strike make* William Allen Clark the
richest man in the world. Beside him all
the millionaires of ancient and modern
times are but as paupers. Clark is the
only living billionaire and the only man
who ever required ten figures to represent
his wealth!"
This information took my breath and I
was anxious to hear more. The old gen
tleman was just as desirous of imparting
all the information stored away in his
shaggy head.
"You see," he continued, "it states that
Clark purchased the May Flower claim
nine months ago for $150,000, and ai that
time there had betn no development work
excepting a seven-foot hole."
I glanced at the paper and saw the old
prospector was stating the facts.
"Then from a space 16 by 10 feet and
only 10 feet deep the lucky owner has
taken $100,000. I happen to know all
about it. for 1 have been over every acces
sible foot of that claim."
"Do you know what happened after the
figure* showed the wealth of the mine?"
I confessed my ignorance and curiosity.
"Why, ClarJc shut down the work and
packed off every man that had been work
ing for him, excepting myself, lo his dif
ferent properties in other sections of the
Stateâ scattered them, as it were, to the
four parts of the earth, and they are kept
at work. When one grumbles about any
thing, seeking some excuse to quit, to go
prospecting on his own hook, his wages
are raised and he ii induced to remain
where he is."
"What was the reason for such action?"
I inquired.
"That's just what I am Roing to tell
you," replied the old prospector, as he
took a chew of tobacco.
"You see, Clark has handled some
pretty rich properly in his day, but he
had never run across any th Ing like this,
and he didn : t want any experienced
miners around. You see, ,the paper states
that this mineral belt extends clear from
the Boulder to the Jefferson River, and so
it does, a distance of nine miias, every
foot of which can be traced by croppings.
Clark has been filling the district with
greenhorns, fresh from the East, who
have staked out claim after claim, and
I wouldn't know a piece of gold quartz from
an old chunk of cast iron. Every one of
these claims has been bonded or sold â ;
outright to Clark. He probably owns
about thirty-six square miles of territory,
the richest on the globe."
"I was a sort of assistant foreman on
the first work. I am getting too old and
stiff to do anything but boss, and I knew
Clark's people way back in Ohio fifty
years ago, when old Bill Allenâ 'Foghorn
Allen* as they used to call him â after
whom Clark was named, was the great
political power in the State; and so Clark
put me in charge of the May Flower work.
He sent me gangs of the greenest men I
ever saw handle a pick or shovel, and I
was in terror every time a blast went off.
We ran that tunnel the Standard tells
about 100 feet below the first opening and
we atruck the ledge again, just a foot or
two wider, if anything perhaps a little
richer. Then we went 300 feet lower on
cot, with a rougn blue blanket, sat in a
corner. That was all the furnishing.
â¢'This is the haunted place!" he said,
going toward the further tanK. "In here
a man hung himself. See," he went on,
"there's where he tied the rope â up there,
and swung himself off, quite neatly. It's
his ghost that comes back. A Chinaman
hung himself in the other cell, but he
don't seem to haunt it. Guess now he's
got out of it, he prefers to stay."
"But this ghost?"
"Well, there was a young woman here j
from somewhere. She was trying to
paint the town, and we locked her in here
In the morning she swore that the ghost
came out of the cell where the fellow
hung himself, and crouched in the corner
nearest the door. She described him.
and it is not probable she had ever heard
of the incident.
"Then there was a Chinaman who said
he saw a ghost, and when we let him out
in the morning he was nearly crazy with
fright Lots of people declare it is no
myth."
"And yon credit the story?"
He smiled and shooK the keys a bit.
the side of the mountain and tunneled
again and found the ledee intact. After
that we were 3et to wort scratching along
the beck of the ridge here and there for
the 1500 feet of the claim, and everywhere
the ledge showed up between two walls of
granite as perfect as molten lead poured
into a mold, and you see those greenies
really wondered when we would strike
pay dirt! I tell you it was laughable.
Somehow, I disreraember how, a particu
lar friend of mine, Sam Adams, located
on an adjoining claim early in the game,
but Clark, after r:e had scratched along
the 1500 feet, coolly planked down $100,000
and took the claim. I lost my job shortly
after and am now on my way East with
Adam?. I reckon he and I can get along
on $50,000 apiece, but it is a mere drop in
the bucket to what that mountain of ore
is worth."
Hore my friend took another chew as he
proceeded. .
"Now it is simply a matter of mathe
matics, and I figured it out on the cars
coming down and have it all in my head.
The problem kept buzzing in my head to
the rhythm of the car wheels like Mark
Twain's idiotic 'Blue trip slip for a
10-cent fare, punch in the presence of the
paseengaire,' and I can roil it off at my
tongue's end. From a hole 16 by 10 by
10â that's 1600 cubic foetâ comes $100,000,
or $62 50 per cubic feet, and two claims
giving a united ledge 3000 feet long, 400
feet deep â and no telling how much
deeperâ and 16 feet wide gives 19,200,000
cubic feet at $62 50 per cubic foot in round
numbers aggregates $1,200,000,000, and
that is some idea of the immediate wealth
of William Alien Clark. The gold is
there and it won't take two years to get it
out. You see, just the rock removed in
cur tunneling and scratching, entirely
outside of the main ledge, netted
$500,000,

"I have never stayed here to see," he
said. "I will believe you in the morning."
Then be passed down and out of the
hall. I heard his hurrying steps and the
grate of the keys in the lock. Then I
looked at my companions and shuddered.
I am quite sure they shuddered too.!
"Brave or not," said one, 'M wouidD't
stay here alone for the world. What is it
that makes one feel so sleepy ?"
There was no doubt about the feeling
whatever it might result from. The
thought of anything intangible and inca
pable of ;being understood and which one
cannot wrestle with is distressing. It is
not fearâ it is a feeling as difficult of ex
planation as is its cause.
The quickly gathering dnrkness played
tricks with the gray light that filtered in
through the one grated window. It gath
ered in the corner and formed elusive
shapes and chased that welcome intruder
out into the open air, where finally with,
one sigh it gathered its forces and fled,
leaving all in complete darkness.
We aat on the rough couch and leaned
against the wall and talked. Our voices
echoed strangely iv the stone place as we
told of weird happenings, of sudden, unex
plainable and unusual deaths. We re*
counted tales of sudden madness, caused
by the reappearance of those who had
passed beyond the grave, of all the awful
sights and sounds which had been told to
as. We recalled stories of tbe dissecting
rooms, and agreed that it was really fool
ish to be superstitious. And with charm
ing consistency â to be expected, I suppose,
from women â we refused to move or
>leep. We spoke in lower and still lower
tones, until our voices became whispers,
and we breathed carefully, thankful that
we could not see each other, but longing
wistfully for daylight.
I must have fallen asleep, anxious as I
was to keen awake, for I started snddenly
to find myself stiff with cold and some
what confused as to my location. Remem
bering suddenly, I looked in the direction
of the door, which stood partially ajar,
into the other cell a lew feet from our soli
tary window. Gradually something light
assumed proportions, and two arms were
stretched across the top of the door.
Cold in excess, broken rest, and a fresh
fund of ghost stories, are apt to make one
nervous and apprehensive. I did not
move until I was positive that there was
something there. Then I awoke the
others.
"Awake?" I asKed.
"Yes! what's the matter?"
"Look at the doorl"
"Nothing there!" spoken in low whis
per?, as though in fear of disturbing some
thing.
They say that supernatural things are
oftentimes visible to but one person in a
company. I was beginning to fear that I
was the unlucky individual who could
see, when the artist struck a match,
walked to the door, grabbed something,
l:e d up to our view a man's white flannel
undershirt, then peered out the window
and remarked that it would soon be day
light.

i subject before Congress. I think the

But my mind Lad been stunned by the
enormous facts and n ures so glibly nar
rated by my loquacious acquaintance, and
I was moving toward the bar, and as be
joined me he repeated a quotation from
Bret Harteâ
This Is my atory, sir: a trifle, indeed. I assure you.

Who swerves from the truth in his tale. No,

And as the old man moved slowly back to
his seat I inquired of "Jim" who he was.
"Oh, I don't know,' ' he replied, "as I
am comparatively a stranger here, but be
is some fellow with a half dozen aliases,
more or less. I have been introduced to
him this morning once as Rider Hageard j
and once as some foreign nobleman,

But the hotel clerk was an old-timer,
and smiled as he said: "Been having a

Raphael's Joke.
Kaphael, the great Italian painter,
whose celebrated Biblical pictures are
worth fabulous sums of money, was not a
rich man when young and encountered
some of the vicissitudes of life like many
another genius. Once when traveling he
put up at an inn and remained there, un
able to get away through lack of funds to
settle his bill. The landlord crew susni.
"How did that get there?" y
"â  "It was there when we came In. I saw,'
it, but forgot about it. There's a pair of
red flannel what-you-call-e:us on the
other cell door."
Somewhat peculiar certainly, bat still
not supernaturalâ quite to the contrary.
Daylight came slowly so much more
slowly than it had gone the night before.
It made the walls look painful and did
not interfere at all with the darkness that
gathered in the tanks.
By tne early morning light our faces
hooked pale and haggard and the prison
damp was on our hands and our lips were
parched. There was nothing to say nor
to do save to quietly wait for the Sheriff.
We had stayed in the prison ever night.
And all for nothing.
We did not say nor feel it. We could
not iauph with each other over the non
appearance of the ghost.
There was nothing for the visions in the
unholy place; but the very air we were
breathing resked with the sighs and
groans and misery of those who had been
there before usâ the playthings of circum
stance with their unbridled and unprinci
pled natures. Every stone in which the
friendless eyes had gazed had burned
into it the thought that sprang from the
heart. Thoughts of wasted lift, of crime,
accomplished and contemplated, of
crushed hope, of great despair â oh, they
lived au a thrived there, these child rea
of worse than madness, and they shrieked
their little beings into our ears and mads
us feel their living.
But this was no haunting peculiar to
this cell. It is in them all, filling them,
crouchin.- in wait for the next occupant, /
to creep about him and instill itself into
him and possess and handle him before
ho recognizes it.
Then there was a step far away and the
clanking of the keys and the opening of
the door.
We met the Sheriff in ;he corridor.
â¢'What did you see?" he asked, and
he looted a little anxious. "Is it
haunted?"
â¢'Yes."
He smiled the old cynical smile.
"What did you see?" he asked.
"Nothing."
"What did you hear?"
"Nothing."
"Well, then?"
"Don't you feel it?"
He turned abruptly and walked away
and we followed, nor did we pause or
speak until the San Rafael sun was thaw
ing out the prison chill.
"I didn't think you ought to have tried
it," the Sheriff said. "It isn't like other
things some way. It seems some way
serious. Good-day," he said. 41 l hopÂ«
you haven't caught cold."
It, may not truly have visible ghosts
that steal in the dead of tbe night from
their hiding-place and crouch in corners,
this strange cell, but it is haunted never
theless, and you can feel it and know it,
and if the visible spirit form does prowl
about it has invisible companionship.

women whisters wno was then in Brooklyn
that the bud would so soon blossom. Those
that we looked upon as favorable to such an
idea threw cold water upon it, but, like
Banquo's ghost, it wouldn't down, and to-day
it is a living reality. The little flame that was
kindled goon spread, and the Trist Club of
Philadelphia, with Mrs. T. H. Andrews at its
head, set the wheels again in motion, and by
her indomitable pluck and energy succeeded
in accomplishing what otherwise might have
proved a failure.
To the ladies of the Pacific Coast no little
credit is due. California was the first State in
the Union to admit ladies Id their whist clubs
with tho same rights anJ privileges as men;
and for that reason and oihers we are pleased
to giye to the whist world the portraits of
many of the leading * hist experts among the
gentler sex who firmly believe and agree with
Eugene S. Elliott, father and founder of the
American Whist League, that the training
schools of whist-players =;iould continue to be
our homes, where our wives aud daughters
reign supreme, and where their ennobling
and refining influence can best be exerted.

MBS. P. J- TORMET.
II Mrs, Tormey could be induced to explain
how she happened to take up whist, she would
undoubtedly ieli us "she was driven to it by
her hueband." Â»\ ith her ihe says it was whist
for bresk.'a*:. whist tor lunch, whist for dinner
and wu:Â«t far into the night, Mrs. T. is the
wife of President Tormey of the Pacifio Coast
Want Association, who is also president of the
Trim Duplicate Whist Club and director of the
(American Whist League. Her interest in the
me commenced in the spring of 1885, when
â¢ >.- was one of the charter members of a ciub
of ladles and gentlemen. Line many other
ladies on the coast she dates her study of the
game to the enthusiasm of Miss Wheelock.
It is generally conceded by those who know
Mr. Tormey that he is quite an enthusiast on
The game, but Mrs. Tormey is a good second.
To show that she has the lever quite as bad as
her husband: On her first trip to Europe,
several years ago, while in Dresden, she had
a little tea set made to represent spades,
hearts, clubs and diamonds, and table linen
decorated with all sorts of wnist emblems.
Mrs. Tormey thoroughly believes that whist
is an accomplishment second to none. At the
present time she has three daughters now
spending their fourth year in one of the finest
educational institutions in the State, aud she
cays if they graduate without a thorough
knowledge of this beautiful game they go
back again.
MRS. CHARLES S. SITTON,
The founder and president of the Kate Wheel
ock Club of Portland, Oregon. This club is the
largest ladies' whist club in the United States.
At the present time it has a membership of
about one hundred. Three years ago when
Miss Wheelock ma<ie her first trip to this 6tate
iv a professional way an incident of her trip
goes to show how her reputation as a teacher
and player preceded her arrival in Portland.
To use her own words she told us she "ar
rived in Portland tired and travel worn." No
preparation bad been made, of course, for her
comingâ and, as she expressed it, she "did not
know a soul in the city. You can imagine
how I fe'.t when I found away off there a club
composed of seventy-five women called the
Kate Wheelock. It was the most touching
compliment 1 ever had paid me."
Mrs. Sitton wa* there, and for several years
she knew of the wonderful abilities of this
little queen, and she says "what other name
could we give our little club?" Mrs. Bitton's
work fn a whist way is a labor of love. We
have had the good fortune to sit opposite her
. partner, and we speak oy the card in say
lag she Is a player second ro none among those
we have met in Oregon. She is thoroughly
I .miliar with every new and old system of
play, being a close siudeDt. Mrs. Sitton's
writings on many a subject pertaining to the
game are familiar to our readers. She often
refers to the quotation from Edgar Allan Poe
where he says, -'Beyond doubt there is noth
ing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the
faculty of analysis. Proficiency in whist im
plies capacity for success in all those more
important undertakings where mind strug
gles with mind."
MRS. JOHN D. EBT.
>frg. Eby is without doubt one of the most
enthusiastic whisters in Oakland, a member of
the Oakland Whist Club and one of its found
ers. She first came into prominence in whist
with her husband, J. D. Eby, in founding the
Linda Vista Club, which was the first club in
Oakland to join the American Whist League.
Mrs. Eby has played in several very important
match games with clubs on this side of the
bay and always came out a prize-winner, or
very near it. Since the organization of the
Oakland Whist Club Mrs. Eby has been a hard
v.orker, a member of the board of directors
find one of the whist committee. She is like
a few others in whist, always working for the
benefit of others.
MUS. GXOHOE B. BATES.
Mrs. Bates is one of the most prominent
whist enthusiast* on the coait She is a na

the Pacific Coast Wnist Association at its last
annual meeting. To her amiable disposition
and winning ways is due the strong hold she
has upon the hearts of all whist-players with

ago she commenced the study of the game,
and she has succeeded in mastering it much
better than the average player. 6he nas cap

How Seed Germination Is Increased by Electrical Excitation
It has at last been practically proven
that electricity is a real incantive to ibe
growth of plants. This is the result of
experiments made at the Massachusetts
Agricultural College, at Amherit, by Asa

increase the power of germination of a
seed planted in the earth.
Mr. Kinney conducted the experiments
and submitted different seeds 1o the
action of an electric cnrren*. He found
that germination was much accelerated.
Two lots of twelve groups containing 112
seeds each were s-oaked in water until
thoroughly moistened and while wet
placed in glasÂ« cylinders opened at either
end. Copper disks which were connected
with the poles of an induction coil were
pressed agninst the seeds and n current
passed through (hem for one or two min
utes. After this the seeds were sown, the
temperature being kept at 45 to 50 de
grees. The result was an increase of
growth in the seeds to which electricity
was applied over the seeds not subjected
to the experiment of 30 per cent.
The objects of this experiment were
threefold : First, to determine whether
the seed germ responded in any way when
subjected to electrical influence; second,
should there be any visible action, to de
termine whether it was injurious or bene
ficial; third, to determine the effects of
different strengths of current. It was
found that with apparatus within the
reach of almost every grower the use of
electricity may prove of great service in
the termination ol small seeds, which
under ordinary conditions start very
slowly.
In the selection of germinating puns for
this work two chief points were taken into
consideration: First, that the normal or
untreated seeds should have exactly the
same environment as those treated, aside
from the conditions brought about by the
application of electricity; second, that the
conditions for germination should be as
favorable as possibleâ that is, that there
should be the proper amount of heat, air
and moisture to give the best possible con
ditions.
The form of apparatus used in these ex
periments consisted of two plates, an
outer one of porcelain about nine inches
in diameter and an inner of clay seven
inches in diameter. Within the inner
plate filtered paper is placed, upon which
tho seeds are sown. In the outer plate a
constant supply of water was kept, which
gradually passed through the plate of
porous clay, keeping the filter paper
within constantly moist. The seeds wero
sown upon tha filter paper, which was
divided into eight equal parts. Seven of
these were used for the treated seeds,
while the eighth was for the normal, or
untreated seeds.
A second piece of moist filter paper was
placed over tho seeds, resting upon them
and touching at various points the paper
beneath. In this manner the coverings
were kept moist by absorption. In order to
insure perfeot darkness a piece of black
cardboard was placed over the pan in such
a manner as to shut out the light but not
to prevent a free circulation of air. The
moist filter paper which constituted the
covering of the seeds offered but little ob
struction to growth.
The batteries used in the experiments
were of two kinds, namely, four Lelanche
cells, arranged in series, giving an electro
motive force of from four to five volts, and
two No. 1 Samson cells giving an electro
motive force of 2 88100 volts. Had lone
periods of treatment been desired gravity
cells would have answered the purpose
much better. But as the current was
never used for more than five minutes at
a time and then the battery allowed a
period of re*t, no difficulty was experi
enced from its running down, and a com
paratively constant strength of current
could be rbtained.
The great advantage gained by using
the aat ammoniac battery is the ease with
which it may be set up and renewed when
exhausted. In order that a large varia
tion in electo- motive force could be ob
tained an induction coil was employed
that was a form of the Rnhmtorff appara
tus- In some of the experiments hourly
treatment was desired. This was accom
plished by passing the wires from the bat
tery to an electric clock and thence to an
induction machine. Â£ cli hour the clock
formed a connection, completing the cir
cuit, and a current was passed through lor
a period of about thirty second*.
The result of the experiments showed
that electricity exerts an appreciable in
fluence upon xhi germination of aeeds;
that the application of certain strengths
of current to seeds for short periods of
time accelerates the process of germina
tion. Those lots of seeds receiving elec
tricnl stimulation gave a higher percent
age of germination than the normal. The
range in the strength of current which
accelerates germination is exceedingly
limited. Seeds subjected to but one ap
plication of electricity show the effect for
only a few hours. E'ectricity when ap
plied hourly to germinating ?eeds or grow
ing plants does not Jose its effect, but acts
as ft constant stimulation to their growth
and development.
George E. Stone, botanist of the Agri
cultural College, says of these experi
ments: "I know of no experiments along
this line in which numerous measure

in attendance at the seventh congress at
Put-in-Bay.

Petaluma should be- proud of having a whist
player of such noted ability in tneir midst.
The Pacific Coast Whist Association at their
annual meeting in January last selected Mrs.
Atwater a? their corresponding secretary.
Her whist fame has reached beyond the limits
of this State. In the whist department of Thb
Call Mrs. Atwater's opinion Is frequently
asked, and in justice to her ability we will say
she is without doubt one of the greatest stu
dents and expert players in the State. Her
writings to the official orsjan oi tho American
Whist Leagueâ Whist of Milwaukeeâ have at
tracted the attention of the whist world. Mrs.
Atvrater is an associate member of the A. .7.

MRS. FRANK F. FREDERICKS.
Mrs. Fredericks of the Trist Duplicate Whist
Club ha* made her mark in the whist world.
At the las', nnnual meeting ot the Pacific Coast
Whist Association Mrs. F. and her partner,
Mrs. Myers, carried oft the highest honors
and prizes in the match for progressive pairs.
She is also a member of the crack ladies' team
of the club. Her bright and brilliant whist
play has won her many admirers.
MISS EDITH HAWLKY BROWN.
Miss Brown is one of the devotees of whist
and also one of the charter members of the
Oakland Whist Club. She is a student, and
plays the game with excellent judgment and
skill. If the whist clubs on both sides of the
bay had more such enthusiastic members as
this charming littie lady the clubs would be
greatly benefited.

MISS ANNIE BLANCHE BHELBT.
Miss Shelby has the proud distinction of
being the whist editor of the Oregonlan of
Portland, Or. Some months ago we bad the
pleasure oi listening to several whist talks by
| Miss Shelby before the Kate Wheelock Club of
Portland. She has the happy faculty of being
able to matte everything clear and concise. Her
experience in the game is far beyond most of
the ladles. Her travels over the world, com*
ing in contact with many of the noted players,
j have given her a wide-world reputation. Her
whist teachings are generally on the line of
the masters, taking no stock in the fads that
tho whist wind blows her way. We hope as
long as the continues in the whist editorial
chair that we will be favored with her
writings.

MRS. E. D. FLINT.
Mrs. Flint, a charter member of the Oakland
Whist Club, is a whist-piayer of more than
average ability. It has seldom been our good
i fortune to have as good a partner and one
that always pla'yrd with the sime cooi delib

marked for deep thought, and she seldom sit-i
down to a game of whist without giving it her
undivided attention. It is a rare treat for any
one that loves whist and knows the game to Do
fortunate enough to secure her as a partner.
MRS H. PAYOT.
Mrs. Payot, wife of the ex-president of the San

merits and comparisons of a large number
of treated and normal plants placed un
der exactly similar conditions nave been
made. Ail experimenters, however, have
not been able to obtain positive results by
the use of electricity. It can readily be
seen from the results of Mr. Kinney's ex
periments that many of the negative re
sults often reported can be accounted for
by the fact that the strength of current
which accelerates germination and
growth is quite limited, and consequently
a current which did not come within this
limit would have no effect.
"These experiments, as well as many
subsequent one?, show conclusively that
electricity, when properly applied, accel
erates germination and growth, and,
furthermore, that experiments have pro
gressed fnr enough to show that in many
respects electricity acts similarly to light
in its stimulating pffect."

FASHIONS, FADS AND FANCIES OF THE SUMMER GIRL
The summer girl of 1897 is to be dis
tinctly an athlete. She may still cling to
the fluffiness of other years when she is
indulging in a promenade upon the hotel
veranda or along the beacu, but this will
disappear when the hour of a'hletics ar
rives. It is all the outgrowth ot the idea
that a woman to be thoroughly fashion
able must be muscular. The day of the
flabby girl has departed.
What particular form will the athletic
fad take? This is the question the moth
ers and fathers of the summer girl have
been asking. You can count the branches
of the fad on four fingers. Here they are:
Golf, fencing, swimming, rowing. There
is a strong tendency toward popularizing
the fourth in the category named. Welles
ley girls had a "crew" last year that took
spins on the river and lake. The gymna
sium s at the girls' colleges were exceed
ingly well patronized by ihe students.
Perhaps one might not think it, bat very
many of those same students are summer
girls â the simon-pure article.
There are a lot of things the summer
girl must know to be athletic If a girl is
really going to enter into outdoor sports,
she must be absolutely correct in what
she does. Golf is considered a rather
muscular game for a woman, and so it is.
Not only that, but it is a game that calls
for knowledge as well as skill. Take
"driving" for instance. In this feature of
golf, one must cultivate a good style.
Style may not be of the great importance
which some veterans insist on, but who
can deny that a good style is a distinct
advantage to the summer girl who wishes
to become a good player?
This is where the knowledge comes in.
To make a irood drive the club should be
grasped firmly with the left hand, the
right being used more to guide the direc
tion, the two hands as close as conven
iently possible, the left being a few inches
from the top of the shaft. Hold the club
w< 11 borne in the palm of the left hand
and more in the fingers with the right.
The ball should be just opposite tbe hands ;
that is, the ball, club, shaft and hand and
eye should all be in the same vertical plane
and the club resting lightly on the heel,
should be at an exact right angle with the
ball's intended direction of flight. Thus the
player's hands will be slightly in advance
of an imaginary line drawn vertically
down the center of her body. She should
stard firm, with her legs about eighteen
inches apart, the left toe slightly in ad
vance of the right. In this posture she
should execute the waggle.
The ideal waggle consists of a gentle
swaying to and fro once or twice only
with the club over the ball, and in the
same vertical plane as the arc which the
head of the club ought to describe in the
actual stroke. The player should waggle
wuh her wrists only. She should let the
club head rest again for a moment be
hind the ball before making her upward
swing, her left eibow slightly squared,
her right at an easy angle, and her hands
well down about on a ievel with her belt.
Then she should swine her club back to a
horizontal position behind the bead, never
for a second taking her eye off the ball,
allowing the body to turn gently with its
weight upon the right foot, raising the
left heel slightly off the ground, a per
fectly natural motion. She should keep
the head of her club perfectly steady and
let her upward and downward swing be
practically one motion.
When the young woman comes to fence
she will find the one thing it is necessary
for her to pay particuia 1 - attention to is
the parry. The safest advice to L-iva to
her is to practice assiduously all the par
ries, excepting, perhaps, the one known
as the prime, which is difficult to execute
and very little used in foil play. As the
young woman becomes more dexterous
she will soon see for herself what guards
are the safest to rely upon. Successful
parrying depends to a great extent upon a
trained instinct, which enables one to
foresee the direction of the opponent's at
tack and upon accuracy and judgment in
executing a movement. The important
thing for the young woman to remember
is that ehe must not be led off into mak
ing her parry too wide, for in fencing, as
in everything else, the conservation of en
ergy is vital.
It is easy to see that if, upon her ad
versary's feint in sixte, the summer girl
allows her blade to fly too far out to the
right she will be unable to ?et it back in
tine to parry the real thrust in quart.
Therefore, she should begin by trying to
make parries too narrow, only broadening
them when she sees she is hit too often.
At the same time she should try to avoid
moving the arm, using the fingers and
wrist almost entirely. The greatest com
pliment which can be paid a fencer is to
say that her finger play is excellent. This
advice, if carefully followed, will give the
beginner a grace which will make her the
envy of her companions.
When the summer girl has learned all
these things carefully she may be tanght
to swim, provided she does not know how.
The method is worthy of a moment's no
tice, however, because it teaches on* how
to swim without entering the water. This
is the way it is done. Take a chair with
out a back and place a padded cushion on
the top. On this the pupil balances her
self on her stomach. Then the in
structress shows her how to work her
hands, and w en they are all right
her feet, and when the hands and
feet can do their part she makes them
work together in proper time. The pupil
stretches out straight from finger tiDS to
toes, palms downward. At the word
"one" the hands are quickly turned out
ward, while the arms are brought around
square with the shoulders. At "two" the
elbows are close to the sides and the'hands
are brought together between the chin
and breast.
At the word "three" the hands are sent
front to the full length of the arm with
energy and not in a purely passive way.
The legs should be carried well up under
the body and outward as much as pos
sible at every stroke. The toes should be
pointed upward toward the shins before
each kick. The object of turning the toes
up is to get ail the advantage possible
from them, as it is in the stroke that the
power is applied with the fiat of the soles.
The feet ought to be turned out till the
toes are in line with the elbows just before
the kicK. After a vigorous kick, turn the
toes downward and close the legs with a
snap, again bringing the soles in use. As
the heels meet tne strain which was put
upon the feet to turn the toes down is
taken off and must be pat on again after
the next kick* is made.
"When the hands and feet cam each do
their separate parts they should Le made
to worJc together In this fashion: As the
hands and arms supply the power, the
legs are being brought up for the kick all
at the word "one." The kick is made as
the hands meet the chest and the sweep
with the soles continues the rhythm as the
hands are brought to the front in the re
covery. By the movements power is al
ways being applied either by hands or
feet. W hile the arms are working the legs
are recovering and vice Versa. A half a
second ought to elapse before the hands
are parted. This will give confidence to
the pupil and will keep her from swim
ming too fast when she makes her first
attempt in the water. So much for learn
ing to swim on dry land.
From swimming to rowing is a natural
step, and so it is that the summer girl
promises to become fairly proficient in
sculling. Now sculling is no joke. It is
not like sitting down with a pair of oars
which fit snugly into rowlocks and will
not go overboard if you drop them. It is
performed by one person, who sits in the
center of the boat and uses a pair of short
oars, technically called sculls, holding one
in each hand. In holding the sculls, it is
a mere matter of fancy whether the right
hand or tbe left is uppermost, the sculls
overlapping more or less. The great points
to be borne in mind are to sit upright, to
reach out well over the toes, dropping the
body between the knees, which should
open out as the arms stretch forvard to
get firm hold of the water at tbe moment
of contact, and to lift the boat over the
water with the first part of the stroke.
The sculls when not in use should inva
riably be flat on the water to preserve the
equilibrium of the boat.
The great art In sculling is to pull
equally and evenly with both hands in
order to balance the boat and to main
tain a straight course, for there being no
cockswain the sculler has to do tier own
steering. This she accomplishes partly
by keeping the stern of her boat pointed
straight at some fixed object astern and
partly by turnina her head, not her shoul
ders and body, round to the right or left
to enable her to cast her right or left eye
as the case may be as far along the water
front as possible.
All these things must tbe summer girl
of 1897 ponder over. If she faithfully car
ries out the promise Dame Fashion will
require her to make she will have far less
time to spend in Flirtation Glen or En-
I gagement Grove.
MARCELLA'S GHAT
Having alluded to the many charms pos
sessed by cashmere when handled by tbe
expert tailor or dressmaker, I am not sur
prised at receiving Â«*verai requests to de
scribe a few model gowns evolved from
this fabric, and I am especially glad to do
so having just beard of two designed in
Paris. TLe first would admirably suit the
pretty brunette so soon to become a bride,
and would be most cbic as well. It is the
shade of a Parma violet; the blouse bodice
has a creamy cambric yoke, with a quan
tity of the tiniest of hand-made tucks;
groups of these alternate with real Valen
ciennes lace insertion; over this is worn
a sort of bolero oi taffeta glace Parma,

covered with ecru embroidery. The
neckband is of cerise velvet veiled with
ecru embroidery. The skirt has its upper
part made of the glace Parma, and the
lower of the cashmere. Ecru pmbroiuerv,
or insertion, with finished edges, conceals
the join. However, I warmly advocate a
skirt made entirely of the cashmere with
bias folds of the taffetas glace, unless ecru
insertion, of a superior quality can be
used. The waistband is of the cerise vel
vet. With thi? can be worn effec
tively a hat of fine black straw, trimmed
with three handsome black ostrich
plumes. Next the hair in the back
should rest a cluster of cerise roses or
Martha Washington geraniums. A short
cape of black mousseline de soie would
give a pretty finish to the costume, which
is lined completely with a Parma-colored
surah, through which runs a cerise stripe.
Equally fetching is a mouse-gray cash
mere. Steel and siik mingled together is
used to embroider the plain round skirt.
The blouse bodice has a small basque of
pearl-gray taffetas that closes on the left
side under two small frills. These start
from the shoulder and vanish under the
waistband of dahlia velvet. This should
bo studded with imitation jewels, and an
emerald clasp holding it together imparts
a certain Parisian touch.
A small hat of mouse-gray straw
trimmed with rich velvet pansies, having
a large white aigrette at the left side, goes
prettily with the toilette.
Garden Party .Models.
Three emanate from the hands of this
I artist and are eminently suitable for tbe
purpose for which they are designed.
Red taffetas glace is used for one. The
skirt is sun-pleated and around it is a
double row of chevrons, made of
black inch-wide velvet ribbon. The
effect is charming. The velvet is
also used for the odd Delt, which
is short in front and in the back, but ex
tends in a deep point almost to the arm
hole on either side. At the left is a
large steel buckle and an erect bow,
made with several loops. The sleeves
are beaded with a draped puff
and are completed with fine taffeta
pleating, which rests on a cream lace
friil, like the upstanding ruff on the chic
flat collar of black silk gauze, relieved
with creamy laca and gold embroidery.
Tbe lace droops as a frill down the front
and is laid quite flatly on the fluted taffeta
epaulets, the long ends of which are
pleated and carried round under the arm
hole. The sleeves are long and slightly
wrinkled. A ruffle of the taffeta and one
of lace completes the wrists.
Virot is responsible for the hat of Gas
cou straw; it has a round brim enclosed
in a bouillon ne of cream lisse, caught up
round the crown with a band of mauvre
ribbon ; this also serves as a footing to a ]
spreading out row of white lace pleatings,
within cream ones. "Saule pleureur
plume of white ostrich feathers Cache
peigne in shaded mauvre flowers."
The parasol used is of pompadour silk,
veiled with white silk lisse and surrounded
with a handsome flounce of white lace. It
has a white satin bow and an enameled
mount.
The French are quite crazy over sun
pleating, so Felix has evolved a second
lovely confection also with a sun-pleated
skirt, but this time he uses a transparent
biue barege, round the bottom of which is
some beautiful Eastern embroidery in
gold and silver thread.
The bodice I am most enthusiastic over,
although I have but tbe colored plate to
gaze upon. It fit 3 closely and is mainly
composed of most exquisite bise guipure
over pale blue satin, and this also is used
to make the tabs, one of which extends
down either side, being about eighteen
inches in length. The Oriental em
broidery that appears on tne skirt edges
them as well as the lawn-puffed barege
that forms the upper part of the sleeves.
Ti ese are made of spotted barege of a
lighter shade than the rest of the gown,
and about them I felt rather concerned, as
really I think the effect would be better
were they of the plain fabric, for what with
the guipure over the blue satin and the
embroidery, the blue velvet waistband
(which had a small buckle to hoid it in
ilace in front, a larger one in the centei of
the moderate-sized blue velvet bow in the
bactr). I think quite enough things
have entered into the composition. How
ever, to continue. A blue velvet bow
appears at the back of tbe neck,
with outstanding loops and ends. Over
each puffy shoulder cap is a bow of blue
velvet with drooping ends; the entire
lining of this transparent fabric is of pale
blue satin.
The style of the hat is the "Aureole," and
in this case is made of pleated silk lisse;
at one side are two roses, one red the
other pink, from them arise a white and
pink aigrette.
The third dress is for a slender young
woman, and can be made out of any light
summery material, but the one under dis
cussion is of the most delicate white silk
muslin, "painted with elongated and
treble Vandykes, black, violet and mauvre,
and further dotted with sets of double
raised spots, recalling the four shades."
The round skirt has fifteen graduated
flounces. Down the front of the bodice is
a triangnlar plastron made of five rows of
smaller ruffles. The sleeves are close
fitting and gauged, at the top of
which are five diminutive ruffles. The
yoke is of white mousseline de sole,
of an exceptionally good quality.
It is adorned with an undulating
yellow satin ribbon, and gathered to the
neck under a broad one, crossed in the
center with five lines of black baby velvet
ribbon. The same finish used for thÂ«
wristbands and the waist. At the back of
the neck are two accordion-pleated ends
oi the mousseline de soie, trimmed with
the yellow satin (narrow) ribbon and a
row of the black velvet. The entire foun

&MINERS
Local newspapers report that Colonel An
drews la going up through some of the north
ern counties to look for diamonds. He may
not find rich new diamond fields, but the
matter calls attention to tbe facts that Cali
fornia produces genuine diamonds and that
no systematic prospecting for diamonds has
ever been made in California by anybody who
could recognize an uncut diamond in a gravel
pile.
California has its diamond fields. The term
"California diamonds" has sometimes in a
popular or rather in a jeweler's way been
given to cheap crystals and imitations, and
comparatively few ueople know that Califor
nia diamonds are diamonds, and that the only
trouble with them is that they are small and
scarce as far as we have got with them. The
biggest diamond yet found in the State was in
the rough about the size of a large pea and
weighed two and a quarter carats. Several of
one and a half carats are on record. When
through a large region diamonds of that size
have been accidentally, incidentally and fre
quently shown to exist there is a reason
able probability that time and intelligent
search may reveal bigger and mor* valuable
ones.
Diamonds have been found in this State in
Butte, Amador, Â£1 Dorado, Nevada and
Trinity counties. The first discovered was in
1850. During the '80' s quite a number were
found, but no recent discoveries of not* have
been reported. Diamond experts acquainted
with the South African fields have advised
that systematic search be undertaken. With
the exception of the microscopic diamonds
found in the platinum sands of the Trinity
River they have in this State been under tbe
same conditions as in Brazil and South Africa
âin beds of conglomerate or cemented gravel,
and generally clos* to bedrock, and also in
dation is of a soft finished white taffeta
siik.
The hat has a circular brim of yellow
straw that matches the ribbon. It is laid
over a deep goffering of silk muslin. The
crown is of mauvre silk muslin, surround
ed with four tabs of white muslin edged
with mauvre frills caught up in the center
under a large tuft of rariegatea roses and
lilies of the valley. Marcklla.
association with platinum and other rare
metals.
The most fruitful field so far discovered Is at
Cherokee Flat, in Butte County, where during
the course of many years quite a number of
smÂ«ll oneÂ« have been found In the gold-bear
ing gravels being worked. Fifteen years ago
one Chris Wlsner found aDout twenty near
Volcano, Amador County, in gravel tunneled
from a deposit buried under forty feet of lava.
One of them he sold for $33. Here as else
where no careful, systematic search or the une
of expert skill followed. In 1861 n diamond
was found one and a half miles from Yankee
Hill, Butte County, during a sluice clean-up
It was sold to M. H. Wells, who gave it to Gen
eral John Bidwell of Chico. The gem weighed
a carat and a half, and Mr. Bidweli had it cut
in Boston. For many years it graced a finger
ring worn by Mrs. Bidwell.
A few others obtained by California mining
men nave been cut and worn by California
ladies. In 1867 three diamonds were found
in gravel near White Rock, El Dorado County,
and one of them was sold in the rough to a
San Francisco dealer for $50. Some time ago
Professor F. Wehler of Gottingen carefully
analyzed platinum sand from the Trinity
River and found minute grains which, after
careful tests, he pronounced genuine dia
monds. Particles of diamonds have been
found in the product of stamp mills throush
which cemented gravel from drift mlnÂ«s had
been run, the diamond* having broken up in
the milling process.
The diamond discoveries made so far have
all been made by ordinary gold miners or
others without any expert knowledge of the
gems. Those found are, of course, stray speci
mens from among far greater numbers.
Miners have naturally often pawed over the
gravel from drift mines in regions where dia
monds have been found and have often found
little, reddish, irregular, dirty bits ot crystal
line formation which have been guessed to be
diamonds. They have sometimes shared in
the ancient and general but erroneous
popular idea that a true diamond is
so hard that it can hardly be broken, and
have used a hammer for testing. A diamoiii^k
however, has lines of cleavage, and may ofteW
be split on the edge of a knife or cracked along/
its regularly arranged lines of cleavage with si
smart and not very heavy blow. The most
ready test Is to rub it on a little emery wheel,
and if it perfectly resists the emery it is apt to
be diamond. It diamond discoveries of value
â re ever made in California, they will likoly
accompany the development of drift mining,
which is yet in its infancy In this State. In
the museum of the State Mining Bureau are
several interesting uncut California diamonds
contributed by the late J. Z. Davis, president of
the board of trustees, whu had a deep interest
in the diamonds of this S:ate.
The new trouble with the Anti-Debris Asso
ciation bids fair to be peacefully settled,
hereby preserving the vitally important
spirit of co-operation between the miners and
he farmers, which has already resulted in a
partial resumption of hydraulic mining and
teps to Improve the lower Sacramernn, and
which is needed to secure further Federal as
istance. The executive committee of the
California Miners' Association has appointed
President J. H. Neff. Tirey L. Fjrd and Andrew
Corrigan to confer with the special committee
of the Bacramento Chamber of Commerce.
These committees will institute an impartial
expert investigation of the mines against
which Injunctions hare been asked. The other
evening the Nevada City Board of Trada
unanimously ratified the action of the Miners'
Arsociation, expressed confidence that the
matter was in competent and impartial
hands, and pledged co-operation for a peaceful
settlement Meanwhile the officers of the
Anti-Debris Association have abandoned their
activity, and as a majority of the valley popu
lation are now cordially interested in the re
vival of mining prosperity, In which they in
directly share, and as strong business Influ
ences in Sacramento are interested in preserv
ing the trade and good will of the mining
Communities above, it is likely that the unex
pected campaign against ground-sluicing will
be quietly dropped.
Governor Budd is expected to announce
right away the new board of trustees of the
State Mining Bureau, which It is time for him
to appoint. The members left after the death
of President J. Z. Davis are W. S. Keyes, J. E.
Doolittle, Thomas B. Bishop and W. S. Pyle.
The Governor has an appointment of more
practical importance to make and that is the
State Debris Commissioner. The term of the
Republican incumbent, John F. Kiader of
Grass Valley, will expire June 1, and several
mining engineers want the place without stir
ring up any talk about it. This office is just
about to assume its proper importance, as
$500,000 is soon to be spent on big restraining
dams on the Yuba, Feather, American and
Bear rivers. The $250,000 appropriated by
this State, and now available, is to be spent
according to plans of the Government engi
neers, to be approved by the State Debris
Commissioner and paid out on warrants
drawn by him.
An important question as to what consti
tutes "hydraulic mining" has been raised ty
the manaeer of the Anti-Debris Association In
an effort to induce the Government engi
neers composing the California Debris Com
mission to assume control of all mining in
which gravel or tailings are washed through
sluices by water on the watersheds of navi
gable streams.
It has been erroneously stated in some
newspapers that the Commissioners have ruled
that sluicing in any form is hydraulic mining
within the meaning of the Caminetti act. 11l
fact the commission has decided that the
sluice-working of banks of tailings by the hy
draulic process is hydraulic mining, and
within their jurisdiction, but this official ex
tension of the definition is at present of only
theoretical importance, as only- one miner in
the State has worked beds of tailings that way,
and he has got through.
The Tracy Gold Mining and Milling Com
panr has been formed in this City to develop
the Tracyâ formerly the G. A. R.â mine, near
Angels Camp, in Calaveras County. The mine
is on the same vein of the mother lode as tbo
Utica, and displays a wide ledge of good ore,
with a development of only eighty feet. Prepa'
rations for sinking a 500-foot shaft are being
made. â The Kirkham quartz mine at Kevads
City has been bought by the La Suerte Mining
Company, which bonded it some time ago. Ei'
tensive work will be done at once.

Explanation.
The arroTV flies with the wind. The top figure*
â t sta'.ion indicate maximum temperature for ihe
dars: those underneath It, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hucdredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or soiid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted linen, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric vressure and
is usually nocomDanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cicudv weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the VVusblnjcton
coast. Wh^n the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coas;, and the isobars extend
north and south alone ths coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low- is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" ln the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
Â« etther may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

The following letter from Ethan Allen,
president of the Cuban League of the
United Slates of America, will be read
with particular interest on this day, de
voted by the local Cuban League to a
demonstration for raising funds for the
island patriots:
The Cuban League of the United States )
. of America, COL. E. Allen, President,>
115 Broadway, May 17, 1897. )
Faust E. Mascherini, Secretary of Cuban League
of San Franciscoâ Dear sik: I "nave just re
ceived your lavor 01 the 12th, asking me as
the president of the Cuban League of the
United States to send you some expression of
goodwill lor your grand demonstration in be
iialf of the patriots of Cuba, to be held in San
Francisco on the 30th of this month. I wish 1
-- could be with you in person, but the width of
a continent forbids this. 1 shall be with you
in spirit, for the eartn is not broad enough to
separate those who are animated with a com
mon and patriotic desire to help struggling
sufferers on the road to political ireedom.
It Is inconceivable to me that any opposition
should exist in our country to actively help
ing forward the cause of Cuban independence
except upon the theory of total depravity.
He who can read the appalling story of suffer
ing by the heroic Cubans in defense of a pur
pose as noble as that which animated Wash
ington and his compatriots and not feel
impelled to rush to their relief is so steeped in
the depravity of original sin that he becomes
a dangerous member of society. And when
mat man has, unfortunately for the country,
crept into high official position he can do
much by cant and hypocrisyâ as he is doing
to-dayâ to dishonor our Republic before the
world. I need not here recall the tortures
applied in Cuba to her entire population
regardless of age or sex. The world knows it
by heart. lie who rises in his place, whether
in Congress or out of Congress, and Bays he
does not know it or pretends to disbelieve it
is to-day the canting hypocrite I have referred
to, and the truth is not in him.
The crie3 of Cuban distress we can almost
hear which the savagery of brutal Spain
wrings from non-combatants, and more than
this not a letter comes from Cuba, nor is a re
port made from personal visitation that does
not dwell on the evidence of needless slaugh
ter. The Government of Cuba has long been
in working order, levying taxes and raising
armies, and virtually controls all the Island
except the sea ports, which the navy of Spain
still retains. Then Ib it premature to say that
he who at this time rises in his place as the
conservator of the morals and the patriotism
of the American people and asks {or further
information upon the controversy is guilty of
dissimulation, his demand for mere knowledge
is a sham, and he bo convicts himself ss he
stands?
Can honest men divide as to our duty in
this case when the facts must be admitted as
just stated? Nations, as well as individuals,
are bound by the obligations of humanity.
Wanton murder befouls the eyes and sense of
him who views it without effort to prevent it.
So the cruel story of Cuba, must render callous
the better feelings of our people as a whole,
unless natural impulses have their way, and
further wrong is stopped by our interference
We are great and powerful while Cuba is
weak. We enjoy liberty, because our lathers
gained it in battle. Cuba inspired by our ex-
Ample is fighting for the same great end. In
our trials France gave to us that support whicn
meant victory. Are we not the colossal in
Â£ratei of the earth, if we in our strength shall
aiot do for Cuba what so greedily we sought
,t rom France a century ago? This however, is
"the sentimental side of the question, and space
forbids its enlargement.
But upon material groundsâ if we are base
enough to fly no higher in the realms of
j^thicsâ free Cuba means ultimately American
territory. This territory is what we need, and
In the near future must have. I know that
(there are thoseâ whose eyes being in the back
of their heads they see not the futureâ who
nay "Cuba is not wanted." On the contrary,
â we so much want it that some day â if it be the
only way to this endâ we shall deluge it with
American blood to obtain it. Commercially,
it dominates the whole South American con
tinent, whose trade we are after. It com
mands the gulf, which will soon be to our Na

tion as an inland sea. It has a population of
1,000,000 of white inhabitants and has given
10 U3, of itself, a trade of $100,000,000 a year.
It is capable of easily sustaining a po-ulation
of 16,000.000 of American citizens, with a
value to us of $1,000,000,000 a year. It is the
catch phrase 01 many thHt "we don't want any
territory by aggression"â meaning that we
won't tight for additional land. How empty
headed is he who utters sucn a proposition!
We are the most warlike people on the p on â â 
and will fight at any time for whatever is
necessary to push on the principles which our
fathers of tiie Revolution fought for and
gained.
This Nation represent? an irrepressible con
flict between republicanism ana monarchy,
and we are always in that conflict, whether
we will or not, whenever any people fires tne
opening gun for political freedom. What is
this Nation, so far, but a Nation built upon
aggression? War presided over its birth and
has attended its growth. By arms we wrung
the original colonies from Great Britain, and
with powder and ball seized from Mexico
California, Texas and neany half of what is
American territory. The Louisiana purchase
gave us peaceably the central part of the conti
nent, and only an idiot can tail to ice that if
this had not been ceded to Jefferson for a Drlce
we would have crimsoned ihe waters of the
Mississippi by aggressive warfare to secure
the ownership to tne ocean. In spite of oppo
sition we do want territory wherever it is
needed for the advancement of American in
terests, and the time ihould never come when
we shall be too cowardly to draw the sword
for this, the hour and the necessity having
been reached to do so. Cuba is territory
which we shall surely want hereafter, and
her freedom now means our peaceful acquisi
tion of it in the future.
It is not my pleasure but my great regret to
use the language I hare in reference to those
appointed to rule over us. But it is a neces
sity that we should all resort to plain speech
in this crisis. Not a citizen in the land, out
side of those dominated by some evil motive,
arising from the cowardice of wealth or the
quest for political favors, but feels mortified
and degraded by the action of those intrusted
wfth the direction of our Government. The
previous administration was servile to Spain,
but this one, *o far, gives evidence 01 out
bidding it in ignoble service. It is to be hoped
that this policy may soon change. Something
more than a paltry donation by Congress to
help the victims of Spanish cruelty is due to
the heart of our country, which is not cow
ardly nor selfish when facing its natural obli
gations to check tae murder of helpless pa
triots. The cheap trumpeting of the demand
that "American citizens must te protected" is
only to qnlet and deceive those who have been
anxiously and rightfully expecting so much
more.
Of course American citizens are to be pro
tected as the first and chiet duty of the execu.
tive of the Nation; but, more than this, shall
â >ye compel an observance of the rules of civi
lized warfare toward those so close to us as
the Cubans; shall we continue to listen un
moved to their appeals for help while they
are making the most heroic struggle ior free
dom since Leonldns: and shall we cease to be
the voluntary naval police in support 01 Spain,
doing this vile service to the suppression of
or interference with our own legal and legiti
mate commerce with the Cuban insurgentsa
Spain has never been our friend, nor so far
aided us in any way, that we should now be
come her ally at the price ot our manhood and
public justice. I am, very truly yonrg,

President of the Cuban League of the U. S.

pared by Surveyor Tilton, who estimates
that the size of the sewer is sufficient to
drain the storm waters of that -egion.
The drainage now is about as bad as
anything in that line can be. The Spring
Valley Works put in a tunnel or a drain
pipe from Lake Honda, below the Alms
house, and the waste waters as well as the
storm waters from the watershed pass
through the Sunset district. The action
of the water has gullied out the sand and
earth to a great depth. The gully varies
in width from thirty to eightyfeet and in
depth from ten to twenty feet. This gully
grows deeper and widar after each heavy
rainstorm, and if something is not done to
carry off the water througn a sewer much
valuable property will be destroyed.
Houses as well as lots will be under
mined before another rainy season ends.
Supervisors and members of the Grand
Jury have visited the district, and can
judge for themselves whether property
owners would be justified in making per
manent improvements wtiile the present
stateof affairs is permitted to exist.

It is expected that the Board of Super
visors will take up the subject at the
regular session to-morrow. It is roughly
estimated that the proposed brick sewer
will cost the City abom $25,000.
The building of the Affiliated Colleges,
the construction of the Balboa boule
vard and plans for other improvements in
that section of San Francisco have
directed public attention to Sunset. Men
who are interested in the development of
the City believe that the wealth of taxable
property would be largely increased in a
very short time if Supervisors would join
the property-owners in advancing meas
ures of public improvement in the district
of the park.

SAY THE CEMENT
IS SURE TO CRACK
United States Engineers Re
port on the City Hall
Roof.
Mayor Phelan Says That the
Commissioners Have Vio
lated the Law.
Hardware Men Testify That the Iron
Used Is Fully Up to Speci
fications.
Mayor Phelan gave the City Hall Com
missioners a quiet intimation at the meet
ing yesterday that they had violated the
law in changing the specifications for the
roof of the hall after the contract had been
let.
Ever since be began an investigation
into the manner in which the roof is being
constructed â  the Mayor has had the im
pression that the structure is imperfect,
and that when the rains come again leaks
will develop that will cause great damage
to the building.
He employed an expert to report on the
matter, and the result was a statement
that the cement covering of the corru
gated iron would crack under the hot sun
and that in winter :t ; would leak freely.
The other Commissioners, Auditor Broa
erick and City and County Attorney Cres
well, made â¢objection to the report on the'
ground that it had been made by a man
who, from the nature of bis business, was
naturally opposed :to the style of roof
being built. .
Then Mayor Phelan asked two United
States engineersâ Lieutenants Charles L.
Potter and P. S. Rickon â to report on 'the
roof, and the result was made known yes
terday. The reports of the two experts
substantially agreed, that , of Lieutenant
Potter being that the cement finish will
crack and will separate from the galvan
ized iron. He > considers that the beach
sand when wet will corrode the iron, be
cause of the salt. In ; some parts of the
work already done the cement gutter is
not even a continuation of the roof slope
but rests on top of it, giving another sur
face, which the water will readily follow to
the brick wall. ; â¢ -s ,
; Mayor Phelan insisted that these men
could-; not be : mistaken, though others
might have been, and; that 1 - the Commis
sioners should take some cognizance of
the danger of bnildine a faulty roof He
asked what course would be taken with
the reports.
Â£Vi 'Refer them to the architect," said Mr
Cresweil.
''But will not the Commissioners con
sider them?" asked the Mayor.
_ ' Ota, I don't know,'' saidCreswell â  T "the
Commissioners did not ask for them "
; Mayor was evidently nettled
and quie ti y aalÂ£ed the Commissioners if
they were not aware that they nad violated
the law when they chanced : the spec n ca .

Mayor refraining from pressing his point.
Later, he explained that the act providing
for tne raising of funds for the roof ex
pressly states that r.o changes in the plans
or specifications shail be made after the
contract is let.
The complaint oi the metal-roofers that
the iron that is being used in the roof is
not up to specifications was taken up, and
representatives of Hoi brook, Merrill &
Stetson, George W. Gibbs and Dunham,
Carrigan & Hayden testified that the iron
was fully up to specifications. They msde
tests on the roof, and reported that there
wa? no foundation for the complaint.
