There Is- a Terrible Slaughter During the Suc

That Cause the Outlook for the
Hellenes to Appear Hopeless*
'Copyrighted. 1897, by tne New York Snn.]
LONDON, Eng., April 24.â Yesterday
was Holy day for all worshipers of Mo
hammed. The Turkish hosts who con
fronted the Greek armies in Thessaly
and Epirus invoked the aid of Allah
ai.d the prophet and flung themselves
-with resistless fury against the enemy
all along the line. Nothing human
could withstand the mad, demon-like
assaults which the Sultan's troops
madeâ not once, twice, but half a score
of timesâ upon every position held by
â  the Christian foes.
The burdened wires bring only brief,
laconic details of the bloodiest day's
work in recent history. The principal
battle was fought at Mati, between
Milouna Pass and Larissa. Seven times
did the brave Greeks, led by the Crown
Prince himself, beat back the army of
fanatics, whose frenzy was only in
creased by each repulse.
The Turkish commander had secured
the strongest ally known in ancient or
modern warfare when he appealed to j
the religious spirit of his men, aud vie- j
ti-ry- Â«--<â¢? fiisu.-e.-t from tho liist. *.'
The same thing is happening in 'â 
lipirus, -where the same spirit inspired -
the Mussulman hosts to attack- again |
and again the strong fort which the
Greeks captured early , in the week,
until the crescent Anally supplanted
the cross above it.
At other points on the frontier the
bloody work went on, almost always,
alas, to the undoing of King George's
soldiers. There wan method as well ns !
fury in it. and a masterful disnlay of
military genius. This was also chiefly i
on the side ofthe Turks. JMhem, who â 
was reported yesterday in disfavor with I
his sovereign, established the right to
shape with his new chief the title of
â¢'Ghazi, the Victorious." . He failed
only at one point in his great plan of
campaign against the Greeks iv Thes
saly. He hoped not only *to take La
rissa and the rest of the province, but
to deal a death blow to the Greek
cause by making a prisoner of the )
Crown Prince. J.arissa is his, also
Turnavo and the I hessalian plains, but |
the Greek army and royal commander j
escaped him. The horns of Ills crescent- |
shaped advance did not come together
until his opponents discovered the trap
closing in upon them and slipped
away.
â  Such is the story of a single day of
Turkish victories, as far as it has
reached the outside world at this hour
of wr.ting. Fragmentary details are

BERLIN, GERMANY, April 24.â Prince Ferdinand's visit is of more than ordinary im-

ROUT OF THE GREEKS.
j Compelled to Retreat Before the
| Advancing- Turks and Abandon
Turnavo and Larissa.
ELASSONA, Greece, April 24.â The
i Greeks have been routed at Mati, and as a
result the entire Greek army has with
drawn from Turnavo and Larissa. The
Greek headquarters is now established at
Pharsales, twenty-five miles south of
Larissa.
The Turks attacked Mati in 9 trong force
yesterday afternoon. Aithouph greatly
outnumbered, General Mastrapa with his
brigade made a gallant defense. After
six hours' fighting a council of war was
held on the field, presided over by Crown
Prince Constantine, who participated in
the battle. It was decided to fall back
upon Turnavo, and the retreat was imme
diately effected in good order.
ATHENS. Greece, April 24.â The vic
tory of the Turks at Mati is officially con- -
firmed. The carnage on both sides was
terrific, but the Greeks suffered the most.
The Greek army is in full retreat. They
abandoned the entire plains of Thessaly.
They are not being pursued by the Turks.
LONDON, Exg., April 24.â Dispatches
this afternoon say that hard fighting oc
curred before Turnavo was abandoned by
the Greeks. After resisting severe attacks
the Greeks fell back upon Kazablarin
Plain, between Turnavo and Larissa. It
is understood that Larissa was evacuated
by the Greeks without fighting, in order
I to avoid the capture of the Greek gar
| rison. Edhem Pasha's troops were ad
; vancing in the form of a crescent, and had
almost encircled the city when the Greek
j commander withdrew. Then the evacu
: ating troops joined the forces of the Crown
i Prince and the general retreat to Phar
i ai-ales be an. Edhem Pasha said a few
j days ago he would be in Larissa Friday.
EVACUATION OF LARISSA.
Retiring: Troops Followed by In
habitants and a Big: Crowd of
Refugees.
ATHENS, Greece, April 24.â The battle
of Mali was decided by the combat at
Reveni, where the Greeks, after a splendid
defense, were compelled to retreat. As
soon as he bad seen the battle had gone
against him, General Mavromicahlis, di
visional commander, sent a laconic dis
patch to Colonel Dinopoulo, saying: "*I
am beaten; take your measures." There
upon a council of war resolved to retreat.
Larissa was hastily evacuated, the with
drawal of troops beginning Friday ingot
and continuing until late this morning.
The troops were followed by the inhabi
tants and a crowd of refugees, and shortly
after noon to-day nobody was in tlie
town except the Prefect, a few policemen
and telegraph operators. These left about
2 o'clock in the afternoon. One operator,
who remained until the last moment, sent
a message before he lef., saying he couid
see on the horizon a cloud of dust, which
was probably caused "by the advancing
The Greet Fleet Bombarding the Batteries on Cape Kara at the Entrance to Salonica Harbor.
At sunrise on Friday the Greek fleet appeared off the entrance to the harbor of Salonica, and soon afterward opened fire on the batteries on Touzla Point the
southeastern extremi yof Cape .Kara, a bold headland jutting out into the bay. The vessels of the fleet steamed up in single line, the forward one delivering the fire
from her starboard guns, and then, keeping away to port, hove around, giving the batteries the benefit of her port guns as she passed out. The others followed in th*
same way, and were thus able to use all their guns on the Turkish fortress. v *

later all telegraphic communication with
Larissa was cut ' off. It is supposed the
Turks occupied the place to-night. .",'.*

a prolonged council was held by the Cabi

procession and marched to the cathedral,

broidered robes and golden tiara glittering
with terns, and the choirs chanted pray
ers as the cortege passed along. !
The procession stopped in the middle of
the square, where the Metropolitan prayed
to God to protect the soldiers who are de
fending the national â  honor and â '. fighting
for the glory of the cross. At this point
the - emotion of the people was at its
height. The silent multitude stood with
uncovered heads in the flickering light of

with the voice of the Metropolitan. After
the ceremonies the people dispersed
quickly.

GENERAL MILES' MISSION.
Going to Europe to Observe Modern
Military Appliances of War- i
ring- Nations.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 24.â The
President formally cave vis consent to
day to the suggestion of "Secretary Alger
that General Miles be sent to observe the
operations of the hostile forces on the
Grecian frontier. The official order di
recting the commanding general to pro
ceed to the seat of war will be promul
gated Monday. Miles will not sail until
May 5. He will be accompanied by Can
tain M. P. Maus, one of his aides de camp.
The general said this afternoon he would
not determine until he arrived in Europe
what his exact course would be. He was
going, be said, to observe the appliances of
strategy and armament of the opposing
force?, field equipment, uniforms, trans
portation, medical and hospital appli
ances and all matteis pertaining to mili
tary operation in the field. He thought
it probable he.would | inspect some of the
other European armies.
The Army and Navy Journal says to
night:
Major-General Miles in likely to visit the
theater of war in the East. He will do so unless
President McKinley interposes objection. He
is ready to start, and will leave for Europe to
day if the ollicial authority ne has requested
is granted in time. ',â '* "
For several days "secretary Alger has been
| considering the question of having creditable
representatives in the field with the armies of
Turkey and Greece. Early in the week Captain
Scriven, our efficient military attache at Rome,
cabled Secretary Alger and asked permission
to join the 'Sultan's troops, with a view to
officially reporting the incidents of their,
campaigns and military lessons to be derived
therefrom. ~. "-.'â¢; i^'i J. yjjj. t 'A '.-;Â«â¢ ' -. â¢ -
Wnile the Secretary was considering the ap
plication it was suggested to him that an offi
cer should also be authorized to go.with the
Greek troops. Captain Dorst, our zealous at
taci c at Vienna, was recommended for the
detail. Shortly afterwards the Secretary con
ferred with General Miles. It was at tnis con
ference that General Miles proposed that he
should go to Europe, accompanied by one or
two aids, observe the hostile forces and upon
his return make an official report of his expe
riences. The general's suggestion was heart
ily indorsed by the Secretary, who expressed a
desire that an officer of high rank should go
to Europe. ' f-^-- ;
Tho present war will not present as many
great opportunities to gain information of
modern warfare as would be the case if the
foes were Germany and France. But who can
sny that it will not eventually draw into con
flict, not only those two great military powers,
but Russia, England and Austria? The far
seeing ones realize that the combat between
Turkey and Greece may involve the chief
powers of Europe. If it is prolonged and the
Greeks are joined by one or two sympathizing
states, does anything seem to be more- cer
tain? i ; 'â¢ *" -' ,"â 'â 'â¢ â¢
Should a conflict come about it. would be
highly appropriate that an officer of General
Miles' distinction ana ability as a soldier
should be this country's chief representative
to witness and record the great battles that
would surely ensue. Even if hostilities are
limited to the troops of the Sultan and King
George it is advisable that an "officer of ""high
rank should be the accredited American
representative at the front. If "a general
European war should follow" it would be par
ticularly appropriate tnat General Miles, like
Scott, Sherman' and Sheridan bet ore him,
should be assigned to the important duty.
: President McKinley now -has General Miles'
request under , consideration. The present
probability is that he will approve it. . Secre
tary Alger was in conference with the Presi
dent on the subject on Thursday and again
yesterday. V_ The Secretary . ; has advised that
General Miles be given the authority be has

asked for. There are a number of cases where
general officers have been sent to Europe In
time of war to represent this country. Gen
eral Scott observed the Napoleon wars In 1815,
General Sherman the brief hostilities between
Germany and Austria and General Sheridan he
conflict between Germany and France. McClel
lnn. Helsfleld and Mordecai reported on the
Crimean war and Hazen and Green on the lest
Turkish war. Upton, Forsyth and Sanger in
spected to armies of the world In 1875.
- Should General Miles go to Europe he will
be accompanied by Captain Michier and possi
bly Captain Maus. Ke will make no final ar
| rangements about starting until the Presideut
! speaks. It Is understood that he has already;
; perfected some preliminary .plans in order
I that he may get away promptly when the
order to "march" issued. Naturally Geueral
Miles is exceedingly reticent in referring to
the probabilities.' When he speaks of the sub
ject It is evident that he is extremely enthusi
astic over the prospects. â¢ . ,
As to Captains Striven and Uorst the Presi
dent has approved a recommendation of Secre
j tary Alger, that the former be authorized to
j join the Sultans .army and the latter, King
George's forces. * ' - â¢ lâ¢ x â  â 'Â»
â  Captain Scriven has been directed to report
to the American Minister at Constantinople.
Instructions have been sent the Minister by
the Secretary of State to request authority for
J the captain to go to -the front. No application
I has been received from Captain Dorst to join
the Greek army. In his case the orders issued
grant him permission to go to Athens and re
port for duty to the American* Minister. It is
assumed that he will gladly avail himself of
this opportunity and it is expected that some
particularly interesting reports will be made
by him to the War Department -â"-*-' *-

CIRUJtDA IN DISGRACE.
The Off cer Who Caused kfaceo's Death
Ordered Home by Captain-dneral
Weyler.
HAVANA, CUBA, April 24.â Colonel
Cirujeda, who is now on the way to Spain,
has lost all the glory he gained after be
led the Spanish forces in the ambush and

disgrace is that he was in Havana with

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 25, 1897.
I was received of an expedition landing on
! the northern coast of this province near
Santa Ana. Orders were sent him to
start immediately to the front and cap
' ture |lhe filibusters. Instead of doing so
: he went to Marianao, a suburb of the capi
tal, remained there, and sent to Santa
Ana a captain with 100 soldiers. This
I force met the insurgents under General
'. Castillo and suffered such dire defeat that
the captain aud seventy of the soldiers
were killed. The expedition landed
safely and Cirujsda was recalled by Wey
ler. At the same time it was discovered
the troops of Cirujeda by his consent were
, selling cattle to insurgents and to mer
, chants in Havana. Weyler ordered him

A', Villi: E IS RELEASED. _"
! One of the Competitor Crsw Out s>f ths
Spaniards' Clutch..
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 24. âGeorge
Washington Aguirre, an American citizen, ;
| was released from tbe Cabanas prison in
Cuba to-day, and Jose Cepero, another
American citizen, iB to be set free from
prison at Santa Clura as soon as certain
legal formalities are complied with.
A telegram from Lee and a note from
Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish Minister,
informed - the State Department of
Aguirre 'a good fortune. The young man
: was captured with the Competitor crew
! last July. Lee succeeded in getting the
i case transferred to the civil courts, but he
j was not tried. He was born in the United
j States, but his surname made the Spanish
; cautious in dealing with the requests of
| this Government for hit release, and this
i caused a delay. Aguirre was released on
I condition he would leave Cuba.
Spanish agents have scented another
; filibustering expedition. De Lome has
| officially notified the State, Treasury, Jus
| tice and Navy deDartments to watch it.
: But all tha officials concerned with the
| â¢suppression of filibustering don't know
i what to do. The information furnished
lis exceedingly indefinite. All the Span
] ish Minister bas been able to tell ia that
i an armed expedition is about to start
I from some place along the Atlantic coast,
i between New York and Charleston. The
I Minister's suspicion points to both of
; these cities. He also suspects Philadel
; phia. There is not enough naval vessels,
! revenue cutters and Federal officers
! available to patrol the coast for several
! hundred miles, and the Government is
i awaiting another tip from the Spanish en
voy.
WERE BOTH HIBDENS SLAIN?
There Is Now a Denial That One of the
Supposed Murdered Men Is
Yet Alive.
I WICHITA, KAHL, April 24.â The town
I of Pauls valley, I. T., was startled re
; cently by the sensational news that Jesse
Hibden. who with his cousin Charles,
was reported murdered in Arkansas about
a year ago, was alive and bad since done
: time in prison at Leavenworth, Kansas.
TbÂ« Hibdens were residents of Pauls
Valley, as was the cook named Jones,
who was tried for the murder and hanged.
, Since the publication of the report, which
, was given out by James Cain, now of
j Mason Valley, Arkansas, D. M. Spain of
i White Bead, I. T., uncle of Charles
I Hibden. has denied the story throughout.
' He declares that the Hibdens were mur
| dered and their bodies burned near Boon-
I ville. Arkansas, and that Jones was wear
i ing Jesse Hibden's clothes when arrested
. ana riding Charlie's saddle. He says the
j house in which they camped was burned
; and portions of tbe skulls and other parts
I of two bodies were found in the asheÂ«.
Ho says that Jones had in his possession
stock belonging to Charles Hibden. James
I Cain wrote a letter on the same date
â  reiterating every statement previously
j made concerning Jesse Hibden except
; that he (Hibden) is not now in jail and
j eivins as his authority one L. B. Condit,
' who was a fellow prisoner with Hibden.
1 He says Hibden told Condit that himself
i and Jones (the man that was hanged)
j had plotted to murder Charles and their
'. other partner, that Hibden took the
i money and left Jones the stock and left
! Jones the murder to commit. Hibden
, starte I back through the nation and was
; arrested and tried at Muskogee for ped
dling whisky, was convicted and sent to
: the penitentiary at Fort Leavenworth,
; Kansas.

GROVER MAKES A
LITTLE SPEECH
"Present Problems" His
Subject at a Club
Dinner.
Attributes Business Stagnation
to the Policy of Pro
tection.
Applause and Laughter Greet His
Remarks, Regardless of Op
portuneness.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 24 âGrover
Cleveland discussed "Present Problems"
at the tenth annual dinner of the Reform
Club to-night. Cleveland read his speech.
With his eyes glued to the manuscript
most of the time he delivered himself in a
dreary monotone, frequently stumbling at
polysyllables. He was in the bouse of his
friends, however, and the 500 admirers
who crowded the banquet hall wildly ap- \
plauded all of his utterances. The gallery
was crowded with ladies, among whom
were lurs. John G. Carlisle and Mrs.
Charles S. Fairchild. Cleveland said in
part:
We nave gathered to-night as patriotic citi
zens, anxious to do something toward rein
stating the prosperity of our fellow-country
men and protecting the fair name of our
country against shame and scandal. On every
side we are confronted with popular de
pression and complaint. These conditions are
perhaps largely due to the work of agitators
and demagogues who have busily sown the
seeds of discontent in order that in the harvest
they might reap personal advantage.
While scattering the seeds of discontent
"They have also cultivated the growth of sec
tional and class suspicion and distrust, which
threatens to choke or destroy that fraternal
feeling which leads to considerate counsel in
the day of common mlsfottune, and which is
absolutely essential to the success of our plan
of government.
The fundamental truth that our free institu
tions offer opportunities to all within their
influence fo* the advancement and Improve
ment of their condition has been so far denied
that honest accumulation is called crime and
necessity and habit of individual effort and
struggle, which are the mainsprings of sturdy
Americanism, are deserted as unjustifiable
burdens, while unwholesome paternalism is
presented in handsome and inviting garb.
Cleveland traced these influences to
their culmination in the demand for the
free coiuage of silver and continued:
It was a rude awakening for the negligent
and overconfident and a day of terror for
sober and patriotic men, when the bold pro
moters of this reckless creed captured the or
ganization of a powerful poli'.ical party, and
seizing its banners shouted aefiance to the
astonished conscience and conservatism of the
country. Hosts of honest men. in blind
loyalty, gathered behind the party flag they
had been accustomed to follow, falling to dis
cover that the part; legends had been effaced.
Deliverance, however, came through the
action of those who saw the trick and loved
the principles of their party too well to follow
its stolen banners in an attack upon those
National safeguards, which party as well as
patriotism should at all times defend.
The party placed in power as a result of this
splendid Democratic patriotism has failed to
meet its obligations to the people's trust. Its
distinct campaign declaration was unre
servedly in favor of sound money. The
country's pressing exigencies demanded
prompt and efficient action in the effort to
place tbe Nation's finances upon a safe basis,
approved by the business judgment of the
land and secure from successful attack. In
stead, however, of addressing themselves to
tbis task the managers of the victorious
partyâ these professed champions of sound
finance nave, before the eyes of an expectant
people, returned in hot haste to their wallow
ing ln the mire of extreme protection, offend
ing millions of voters by their exhibition of
party bad faith ana disgusting millions more
by their unconcealed determination to repay
partisan support from the proceeds . of In
creased burdens of taxation placed upon those
already overladen.
In the meantime the allied forces of calam
ity, encouraged by these malign conditions,
are still active and aggressive. They confi
dently speak of the muter in which they
failed as only the 'first battle" and gladly
hail every untoward incident and every
added pretext lor passion and resentment as
new and welcome allies in the continuance of
tne crusade. 'â  r.jjyjy
I began by saying that this was an assem
blage for patriotic purposes. I hope my sym
pathy In its high aims will not be suspected
when I contess that 1 have brought hero
sturdy partisanship and devoted attachment
to the principles of true Democracy. It is an
impeachment cf the intelligent members of
any political association to say that party
management and discipline should at all
times command implicit obedience, even
when such obedience leads to the abandon
ment and radical perversion of party prin
ciples.
To<**se who believe a crisis is at hand can
hardly fail to see the party in power so joined
to Its idol of mad protection and so complete
ly doomed to popular condemnation that it is
a useless instrument of defense against im
pending peril. The path of duty and the best
hope of safety lie in an Immediate and
earnest attempt to accomplish the rehabilita
tion and regeneration of the Democratic party
and its return to the principles of true
Democracy. The task it not easy, but it is
surely not hopeless. The work has already
been inaugurated by the creation of an or
ganization founded upon the declaration of
Democratic principles so sound, clear and
patriotic that they should rally to their sup
port every true Democrat and supply the in
splratlan tbat lorbids defeat.
Cleveland's reading was interspersed
with repeated cheers and laughter, much
of which was misplaced. The inoppor
tuneness of this was so marked in one
case that Cleveland mildly chided the en
thusiasts for laughing at a solemn warn
ing.
Speeches were afterward made by Car
lisle and Wilson of Cleveland's Cabinet
and by Chairman Bynum of the National
Democracy. Carlisle scored ihe silver
propaganda, and the others attacked pro
lection.

WASHINGTON. D. CL, April 24. -Ex-
Senator Warner Miller visited the White

COLONEL SHAFTER'S PROMOTION.
Although There Has Been Opposition the
Senate Will Confirm His Nomina

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 24. -The
nomination of Colonel Shafter to be briga
dier-general was on Thursday unani
mously reported to the Senate by the
Committee on â  Military Affairs of that
body. Charges had 1 been peferred, but
did not prevail. The Call correspondent
understands -that in addition to protests
mentioned in former dispatches there was
some opposition offered by tbe labor ele
ment in the 'West on account of Colonel
Shafter's action. in the railroad str.kes in
California a few years ago.
There is not the slightest doubt of his
confirmation, but action will be delayed i
for about ten days. he Senate was not
in session yesterday or to-day. â¢It will
meet on Monday, but will immediately
take a recess until Thursday, on account
of the Grant ceremonies in New York.
The Senate will on Thursday take another I
recess for three days. "It is expected tnat

The Great Author to Be Placed on the
Presbyterian Grid ron at the
Annual Synod. ....._
"Copyrighted by the New York Sun.]
LONDON, Eng., April 24.â annual
synod of the Presbyterian church of Eng
land, at which an attack is to be made
upon lan McLaren's alleged heresies,
op-ns at Sunderland on Monday, and
there already prevails the nearest ap
proach to excitement which can possibly
occur within such a sedate body. A peti
tion asking for an inquiry into Watson's
heterodoxy has been printed and circu
lated among the members, and lobbying
is in full swing for and against the erring
brother. The petition gives a chapter
and verse from McLaren's "Mind of the
Master" and his suggested crtei from the
sermon on the mount.
The petitioners declare that "if such
' statements are allowed to pass without
: any disavowal or explanation on the part
I of Watson or any notice of them on the
! part ot the church the result will be most
j disastrous to the spiritual life of the
church, and also eventually to its outward
progress and prosperity."
Watso*h, full of fight, arrived at Suther
land to-day, in readiness for the fray. It
is just possible tbat the battle may not
j come off at tbis synod. The petition is
signed by certain ministers and elders,
I but the rules seem to require that such
i charges be made upon the responsibility
of some subordinate chnrch court, such as
a session or presbytery. If it does not
bear the indorsement of such a body the
synod may refuse to discuss it, and in any
j case the matter is not likely to come be
j fore the synod before Thursday, owing to
the pressure of routine business.
HAD TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE.
Directors Give a Bank Cashier All Kinds

Heavy Defaulter.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 24.â Harry A.
Cassin, a young man of fine family and
heretofore of exemplary reputation, was
to-day discovered to be a defaulter to the
j amount of $45,000. He was cashier of the
! Georgia Loan, Savings and Banking Com
j pany. So implicit was the confidence of
j the directors that he was permitted to
maKe loans without reporting until the
I end of the year. He availed himself of
this to invest tbe company's funds in pri
â  vate enterprises. He haÂ« transferred per

"When my son was 7 years old he began
to complain of soreness on both sides of

on one sids and grew to half the size of an
egg. We then became more uneasy and
began to doctor hm for scrofula.. He
gradually grew worse, however, until at
the age of 12 years we bad lost all hope of
his recovery. He became so weak he
could sit up but a few minutes at a time.

Thought Her Insane.
Relatives of Therese Ferguson and
the Lowell Pollca Try to Con
ceal a Great Mystery.
BOSTON, Mass., April 24.â The climax
ofa tragedy shrouded in mystery and
secrecy occurred in Lowell, Mass., to-day,
when the body of a wealthy woman who
disappeared nearly, five months ago was
discovered in an awful state of putrefac
tion in a closet of her own bouse.
Therese Ferguson, 30 years of age, dis
appeared the 6th of last' December. Tbe
body was found to-day in the closet of a
room she formerly occupied on Wamesit
street and was secretly buried without
service. Neighbors say Mrs. Ferguson's
mind was affected by the death of her
husband and tbey believed that she had
gone to an asylum when sbe disappeared
in December. When the priest drove in a
closed carriage to the house to-day the
neighbors inquired whether anybody was
ill. They were told that nobody was ill.
Medical .Examiner Hartwell was called.
He reported that Therese Ferguson died
in the closet from suffocation by gas on
December 6. The body was discovered on
account of its condition. There was a
easjet in the closet, but it does not appear
t'.at it has been turned on for four
months. Was it murder? "If it was
suicide bow could the caajet have been
turned off again? An undertaker buried
the body without service and did not give
the news to the newspapers. No informa
tion was given out at 55 Wamesit street,
"We wish nothing said about the case,"
was the statement of a woman supposed
to be a sister. "We believe that it was
accidental."
"We know nothing about it," say the

ELECTRIC LIGHT
WITHOUT DYNAMOS
Important Discovery by
an Electrician of
Mill Valley.
With Ordinary Batteries He
Produces a Brilliant
Illumination.
His Secret Embodied In the Fluid
With Which the Cells Are
Charged.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., April 24.â
Deputy Sheriff John F. Magner, who is
also the electrician for the San Rafael
Electric Light Company nt this place, has
made a discovery which bids fair to create
a sensation in electrical circles and yield
a fortune to tne discoverer and inventor.
Mr. Magner has, by a careful study of
over two years, discovered a method by
whicli he is able to produce an arc light
by the use of a simple battery. He has
had his apparatus in working order for
three days in the laboratory at his resi
dence in Mill Valley.
"Two years ago," said Magner to-day,
"while in the employ of the Midwinter
DEPUTY SHERIFF JOHN F. MAGNER of Mill Valley, Who
Has Made a Discovery That Bids Fair to Revolutionize
Electric Lighting.
Fair in San Francisco, I was at work on
electrical apparatus in connection with
the big tower which stood in the center of
the grand court. There I made the dis
covery which this week I have put in suc
cessful operation. While I was attempt
ing to get a method of running the electric
elevator in the tower Dy means of a bat
tery instead of a motor I accidentally ran
across something that set me to thinking
and for two years I have worked on this
proposition â to produce a cheap, strong,
steady and brilliant light without the use
of a dynamo.
"Two months ago while mixing the so
lutions in the cells I produced an arc
light. At last after my labors I had put
the theory into practice, but I was not sat
isfied. The lieht while Drilliant was
small, and thinking to make it larger I
put more of my solution (the Ingredients
of which are known only to myself, for it
is in this that the entire secret of my suc
cess lies) into the cells and the light went
out.
"It seemed as if the work of two years
had gone for nothing, and I Immediately
tried to solve the mystery. Three nights
ago success again crowned my efforts, and
I can at any time demonstrate by actual
operation that mv discovery is genuine.
"I use four cells, producing about five
volts each, connected by wires. In each
cell are two poles of carbon and zinc.
Other batteries are similar, except that
they have only one pole each; but itis
not in this that the results are produced.
It in entirely in the solution with which
the cells are filled.
"Of course I intend to immediately take
steps to protect my discovery. I reckon
that a six-room house can be lighted for
about $1 a month by this method, and I
am now at work in an attempt to bring
the- cost of the solution down to a mini
mum. When I have accomplished this,
as I feel certain I shall in a very short
time, the mixture can be sold around the
streets as a milkman now delivers bis
milk from house to house. It would be
served in rubber palls."
Mr. Magner attributes his good for
tune more to an accident than otherwise,
but it is nevertheless a fact tbat ho has
been laboring to produce the results ob
tained tbis week for a long time. He has
been engaged in the task without assist
ance, and what benefits will be derived
from the introduction of the new fluid
will be entirely his own.
SHOOTING AFFRAY AT COLUSA.
Two Men Quarrel Over Their Merits as
Wrestlers and One Is Thrice
Wounded.
COLUSA, Cal., i April Oscar Tur
man, a son of H. B. Turman, one of
Colusa County's most prosperous stock
raisers, shot L M. Bedell in the head
three times last night at a saloon on Mar
ket street. The shooting was the result
of a quarrel that started early in the
evening over the relative merits of the
two men as wrestlers. Bedell, who had
been drinking all the afternoon and was
Intoxicated, met Turman in the Recep
tion saloon and began bis bullying tactics,
finally drawing a knife. Baker, the nigbt
bartender, asked bim to put it up, Tur
man, also joining in the request, but
Bedell ignored them both. Then Ben
Turman, a brother of Oscar, went up to
Bedell and demanded that he put up his
knife, but Bedell pushed him to one* side
and was advancing on Oscar Turman,
when the latter, who had retreated almost
to the door, drew a revolver and fired. â¢. i
. The first shot went wide of its mark and
embedded itself in the frame of a large
mirror back of the bar. The second struck
Bedell in the forehead ' and felled him to \
the floor. Turman advanced and, stand
ing almost airectly over Bedell, fired again,
this shot also taking effect in the fore
head. The fourtb time the cartridge
missed fire, but the fifth bullet struck the
prostrate man in. the mouth, passing
through the palate and out at the right
ear.
Tnrman was immediately arrested and
placed in Jail, and Bedell was taken to the
ofiice of l)r.Â«. Belton and Cason, where
his wounds, which the doctors say are not
necessarily fatal, were dressed. Then he
was removed to the home of bis father-in
law. Colonel John T. Harrington. Late
to-night he was resting easily.
DRIVEN FROM STOCKTON.
LefUngwell's Army of Unemployed Com
pelled io March From
the City.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 24.â Sheriff
Cunningham arrived early this morning
and had a talk with Leffingwell, tbe
leader of the Army of Unemployed, which
yesterday captured a freight train at Lodi
and was brought to this city. Sheriff
Cunningham told the men that they must
leave the train and depart from Stockton.
They were provided with food for their
morning meal and left to camp on Weber
Foint.
The Sheriff was busy all morning pre
paring to send the army away. He called
some of the Supervisors into consultation,
but "just what. agreement was reached he
wouid not say, save that a number of citi
zens were willing to raise enough money
to send the men away. At 11 o'clock
Leffingwell visited Sheriff Cunningham
and held a conference with him.
He then went to tht* office of the Cali
fornia Navigation and Improvement Com
pany, but Manager Corcoran Pad no boat
that ne would give him. Subsequently he
said that be had arranged to have a barge
and a steamer take the army away from
Stockton. He would not say what
steamer he had chartered or whither the
men were going, but admitted they were
supposed to be going to San Francisco.
After they were started on their journey
on the water, though, he said, they would
go where they pleased, intimating that
they proposed to go to Sacramento if
there was any cnance of making the
steamboat men take them to that point.
That was where the men were bound for
and they did not propose to go anywhere
el*e.
Here is the signed statement of Leffing
well given to The Call correspondent:
The majority of tnese men belong east of the
Missouri River. They were allured here by
fake advertisements placed in Eastern papers
to attract immigration *to this already over
flooded section. Many of them left homes in
the East to find the labor market glutted on
this coast. They asked me to do what I could
to assist them to return. Believing every man
has a right to live somewhere, and noting the
fact that they were denied the right here, I
agreed to do all I could to get tbem to their
homes. When that ls done I shall return to
this coast. s. a. Leffingwell.

Cripple Creek, Colo. The arrest was made
by City Marshal W. J. Orr of this place
and W. J. Finley of Calistoga on Rancheria
Creek, about thirty miles from Cloverdale.
The hiding place selected by Hurd was in
the redwood forests of Mendocino County, â 
and his cabin was a miniature fort, in

Last Homage to the Graceful Sov

LOS ANGELES, April 24.â T0-night
tbe city has let itself loose in a perfect
riot of merry-making. â¢ Everybody is
behind a mask and nearly everybody 13
dressed witb a view of attracting more at
tention than anybody else. Everybody
is trying to make more noise than any
body else, and the result is that the dome
of heaven is being fractured beyond the
possibility of mending.
The beautiful Queen made her last pub
lic appearance at the school-children's
function this morning and received the
salute of the marching multitude of little
ones with that ami. and appreciative
graciousness that has distinguished her
among the festival Queens. With her
retinue she was in place upon the throne
promptly at 10 o'clock, the throng of spec
tators forming a dark line spreading away
on both sides.
Tbe gates were thrown open and the
army of children in their bright summer
clothes, many of the schools being uni
formed and every child carrying a nag,
marched in. By "company front" they
made the circuit of the arena, saluting the
Queen as they passed. By clever evolu
tions, showing careful drilling, they were
tben massed facing the throne, their great
number filling the entire body of the
arena, with only reservation at the sides
sufficient to enable them to march away
in good form.
The children were formed in companies
of twelve, and were officered by cadets
from their own numbers. As they passed
the throne each company presented a
tribute of flowers. When massed a brass
band took a station in the center and led
this immense chorus of small voices in the
singing of "Hail, California," "The Red,
White and Blue," and finally â¢"America."
At tbe conclusion of each song' the chil
dren burst into cheers, waving tbeir flags,
making a picture of color and animation
that wa*] inspiring.
After the singing Prime Minister
Thomas descended from his place beside
the Queen and read the following address
ofthe Queen to the children:
I, prime minister, by royal grace of her most
exalted majesty, the queen of La Fiesta, am
commanded to adore*-; a few words to the
little ones who have come to welcome her
royal presence and to express her appreci
ation of the loyalty shown by this gathering
of the school children ol her favored city.
To-day closes the events inaugurated to wel
come our gracious queen upon her annual
visit to her city, and upon you has fallen the
honor of being the last of her subjects to re
ceive and welcome her.
To-night our queen leaves us for another
year, and while her heart Ik nilea with a keen
sadness, that tho joy and pleasure of this
visit is drawing to a close, she desires to state
that in all the many pageants and great dis
plays made in the honor of and to welcome
ber visit none have been so loyal, none so
true in the expression of that welcome ns
that which you, the children of her schools
have Riven.
She presents to each of you a souvenir of her
; visit and of this welcome. Upon each is im
pressed tho flag of this land, a land of which
she and you are native born. She desires
that all of you treasure this little gift, and
that the emblem thereon impressed be ever
before your minds, instilling therein the loy
alty, the love and the patriotism of which
ln the minds of all her loyal subjects it has
ever been emblematic.
Little oues, again your Queen greets you
and extends a kind and loving farewell.
. 'Hon. S. T. Blacx, State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, addressed the great
assemblage briefly, beginning with: "May
it please your gracious majesty." He con
gratulated the children upon having so
gifted, so beautiful and so lovable a lady
for queen, and said she was to be con
gratulated upon having so many devoted
subjects. .
The spectacle here presented was a
grand oneâ more inspiring and significant
tnan tbe armies tbat are now gathered
upon the Thessalian border. The lesson
to be learned from tbis meeting was the
importance of fidelity to the flag and true
devotion to those in authority. The pupils
saluted tbe flag, and lifting up their right
hands, renewed their oath of devotion to
the emblem of truth and liberty. This
done, "America" was sung.
The children again marched before the
Queen on their way to the Twelfth-street
exit. While t hr* companies were march
ing away the Queen ordered one of the
beautiful floral emblems presented to her
by the children â an elaborate shield â to
be presented to the wife of tbe Prime Min
ister. She sent for Hon. 8. T. Black, Pro
fessor Foshay and F. K. Rule and thanked
tbem for their services and devotion. In
doing this the Queen displayed signs of
deep emotion. The floral gifts from the
children were so numerous tbat tbe Queen
could not possibly take tbem in her car
riage, so she ordered them to be divided
among the hospital of tha city.
Before leaving for ber home the Queen
had the following prepared:

Shot to Death by Two Prisoners Whom a
Fellow-Officer Was about to
Handcuff.
VENTUKA, Cal., April 24.â Constable
McCoy Pyle was shot and instantly killed
at Castac, a small station between here
and Los Angeles and just over the line in
Los Angeles County, while attempting to
arrest two desperate characters. The
murder was committed at 4 o'clock this
morning.
Ed McCamish, a denuty constable who
lives in a small shop in Fillmore, about
twenty-eight miles from here, was chloro
formed and robbed Thursday night He
and Pyle hunted for the perpetrators of
the deed all day yesterday. They stopped
last night at Castac station waiting lor
the men, who, they .-uspected, would be
along that way. At 4 o'clock this morn
ing the men came along, and Pyle r.nd his
deputy stepped out and ordered them to
throw up their hands, which they did.
Pyle then covered both of the men. while
McCamish was putting handcuffs on
them.
Something attracted Pyle's attention
and be turned bis bead a trifle, when one
of bis prisoners got the drop on him 'and
shot, tbe first ball entering his left temple
and killing him instantly. Two more
shots were fired by the assassins, wbo then
dashed away. McCamish fired four shots
at them, and claims he beard one of them
give a cry of pain, saying he was shot in
the arm.
The whole county was soon aroused and
the people turned out to hunt the despera
does. Under Sheriff Snodgrass and Con
stable Miller went out from here and
Sheriff Burr and two deputies came up
from Los Angeles. Miller returned this
evening and reported tbat tbe murderers
were tracked about 200 yards from the
place of tbe shooting, and there all trace j
of them was lost.
McCoy Pyle was 29 years of age, and
leaves a widow and three small children.
He bad been a Constable for years, and
was known as a man absolutely without
fear. The body was taken to Fillmore lor
interment.
FIGHT IN A SALT LAKE HOTEL.
Constable Joe Bush Holds a Stairway
Against a Dozen Hired
Roughs.
SALT LAKE, Utah, April Armed
witn a dou ble- barreled shotgun this morn
ing, Joe Bush, a noted Deputy Marshal
and ex-Deputy Sheriff, held at bay an in
vading force of twelve hired roughs. The
scene of action was the entrance to the
Hotel Manitou, the most fashionable fam
ily house in the city. For months pant a
legal battle has been waged between Pro
prietor Fisher and Hamilton Paik, who
claims the ownership of the property.
Park is a well-known old-timer, having
been one of Brigham Young's household
employes many years ago.
To-day Park hired a dozen men, who
are known to the police, to accompany
him to the Manitou and take possession of
the property by force. At the bead of the
main stairway Fisher and two of his em
ployes met the invaders,' and being in the
uppermost position, rushed down upon
the advancing body and started in to
tight.
The battle was a fierce one. The oro
prietor managed to get ihe invaders to the
bottom of the stairway, but he was a mo
ment later thrown into the street, coat
less, collarless and much the worse for
wear.
Then the invaders, having disposed of
Proprietor Fisher, started to again as
cend, the wily Park standing on the side
walk and giving order* like a general as
to how the plan of campaign was to be
carried on. At this point Joe Bush ap
peared on the scene. He had been em
ployed to keep the invaders off. Bush is
an old officer who has had some dealings
with the Robbers' Roost gang of outlaws
and is not afraid of anything. As the
bold dozen started up thu polistied stair
way Joe pointed a barreled shot
gun down the stairway and sain tbat the
hrst man who advanced would be killed.
Tiie "boys" knew Bush and they never
advanced. They remained at the foot of
the stairs debating the matter, all the
time looking at the gun held by the fear
less officer. . The guests were greatly ex
cited. Bush held the s; air all day, and
when arrested on a warrant he loaned his
gun to another man and the raiders were
kept at the foot of the stairway.
PALOMARES DISTRICT STRIFE.
Danger of a Conflict Between Ranchers
and an Irrigation Company's
Workmen.
POMONA, Cal,, April 24.â A hostile
water controversy is agitating the people
of tbis city and the excitement is of no
mean proportions. The trouble is in con
nection with a suit recently brought in
the Superior Court in Los Angeles to re
strain the Palomares Irrigation Company
from developing a water system on cer
tain land owned by H. H. Williams, J. J.
Henry and W. B. Bailey.
On Thursday the Palomares Irrigation
Company employed a force of men to lay
a pipe to a well on the land, claiming the
right to do so under an old contract.
They managed to lay 200 feet of pipe and
left two men in charge to guaid the works.
On Friday morning the pipe was found
piled up beside the road.
The hunt became warm ; the neighbors
of the land-owners offered their services
â¢gainst the company and the two oppos
ing forces are on the ground watching
every movement* Messrs. Henry, Wil
liams and Bailey claim the undisputed
possession of the properly for eight years,
and the contest will probably remain in
tbe same inflammable condition until set
tled by the court. The case is set for next
Monday. j <--â¢ : â¢
Cooler citizens are doing what they can
to prevent bloodshed, but, the opposing
parties are bitter, and the indignation of
the neighbors of the land-owners is great.
I OLO CO I* ATX CROPS.
A Pew TArjM Showers Would Insure nn
Immense Yield.
WOODLAND, Cal., April 24.â The hot
norther which has prevailed for the past
few days in this county has had a bad
effect on the fruit and grain, especially
late sown cereals. Should the wind con
tinue, a few days longer not more -than
half a crop will be realized. Around
Woodland it was thought at first that the
loss would be quite heavy, but it has since
been learned that while a large quantity
of almonds and apricots were blown off
the injury would hardly be worthy of
note. Up through the Capay Valley the
apricots and almonds have suffered, con
siderably. The" pears and apricots were
damaged to some extent at Winters. I 'The
grain is now turning, and with a few light
showers Yolo County will have an im
mense yield.

brightness and completeness to the
â¢whole. The place is in truth as well as in
name a redwood city.
Business houses vie with each other in

outdo the other until some of the blocks
are fairly encompassed in a mass of gay
colors and striking designs. To encour
age them to adorn their places, the decora
tion committee has offered suitable
prizes, to be awarded by disinterested and
competent judges. The residences have
also put on holiday attire, similar prizes

dences.

Grand Parlor will hold its sessions, is now
in the hands of the decorators, who are at
present putting on the finishing touches.

materials are being used in the work, ai,d

front of the Native Sons' Hall is a massive
. affair, and is covered with redwood boughs
and appropriate designs.

CEDROS ISLAND MYSTERY.
Rockets Sent Skyward to Attract the
Attention of a Passing Vessel's
Crew.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., April . 24. â Last
Wednesday when the schooner Anita,
bound from Calamilli to San Diego, was
. passing along the east shore of Cedros
Island, 250 miles south of here, the crew
and passengers were startled by the light
from a series of rockets, which were evi
dently sent up as signals from the island
to attract the attention of passing vessels.
j For some unknown reason the schooner
j passed on without putting in to ascertain :
; the cause of the signaling, but upon its i
! arrival here the news leaked out.
1 From the description given it was I
learned that the rockets bad been fired
frora the point on the island occupied by
Dr. F. G. Powers and his mother, who
went there nea- l.v two years, ago to take
charge of the Cedros Island Mining Com
pany's property, and who have lived
there alone ever since, being supplied
with provisions at irregular intervals. â 
As soon as the news became noised
about preparations were made to send a
schooner down to the island to Investi
gate, as it is believed something serious
has happened there. Accordingly, the
schooner Ida. Captain Doddridge, was
dispatched to the scene. Tne Ida will
probably arrive at the i-land to-night, and
will return about Tuesday with the news.
IRHSSO PAR mls RS MEET.
Campari* on of yotes Shows That the
Thrip Invasion Is Sot Serious.
FRESNO, Cal., April 24.â Farmers'
Club, held another, meeting to-day and
discussed the threatened injury to the
\ grape crop from the thripÂ», wnich are also
known as vinehoppers. It developed that
the harm done by the thrips is .not as ex
tensive as was at first supposed. It ap
pears that to them was laid the blame for
damage caused by a light frost a few
mornings ago. Mildew has been another
factor to add to the damage, all of which
the thrips received the blame for. The
farmers are using a number of devices and
are making a good headway in exterminat
ing them.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., April Captain
"Bob" Morris of the teg Santa Fe, while
cruising outside the harbor yesterday
afternoon, sighted a monster gray back
! whale. The Santa Fe had a party of
United States customs officers aboard, and
iin sport tbe captain gave the order to

SUCCESSORS OF
THE GRAND ARMY
The Sons of Veterans
Destined to Become
Powerful.
â  i
Active Recruiting to Begin at
Once Throughout Cali
fornia.
Division Commander Pierce Will
Labor to Advance the
Order.
SALINAS, Cal., April 24.â The veterans
of the Grand Army and the members of
the patriotic auxiliary societies left the
city for their respective homes to-day,
bearing with them the most agreeable
memories of the encampment of IS97JjJJ
The Sons of Veterans, California divi
sion, held a successful encampment and
elected the following officers for the en
suing year: Division commander, Charles
L. Pierce, Oakland; senior vice-com
mander, Glenn Walker, Los Gatos; junior
vice-commander, Oscar Judell, Oakland.
Division councilâ Rollin Fitcb, Los Gatos;
H. L. . Longfellow, Oakland; Guy E.
Abbott, Santa Cruz. National delegatesâ
A. L. Johnson, Oakland; George S.
Walker, Los Gatos. The newly elected
officers were duly installed by Past Divi
sion Commander C. C. Houck.
Commander Pierce has appointed es
adjutant of the division Captain Handley
of Fair Oaks Camp No. 15, San Francisco.
The newly appointed division quarter
master is Frank Dunn of the same camp.
From this time until the department
encampment meets at Nevada " City in
1898 extraordinary activity will bo dis
played in recruiting for the Sons of Vet
erans. A camp will be organized in every
town of California that can present the
required number of applicants for a char
ter. Commander Pierce is recognized. as
an organizer of ability, experience and en
ergy. He promises his companions that
he will lend his energies to the upbuild
j ing of the organization. He has the influ-
I ence of the G. A. R. department of Cali
[ fornia to re-enforce bim.
Veterans of the war are now coming to
a full realization of the fact that the
Grand Army of the Republic is rapidly
diminishing in membership. The per
centage of deaths is largely increasing,
due to the advancing ale of the old
soldiers. It is admitted and officially
recognized that tbe Sons of Veterans must
perform the duties and bear the re-ponsi
bilities now devolving upon the G. A It.
as an organization. Bach year diminishes
the total number of the Grand Army
posts "and reduces the membership of
those existing. Post consolidations must
necessarily follow' for a time and -ulti
mately a complete suirender to the sons.
The proceedings of the division encamp-,
ment here and the addresses made to the
senior organization in "department coun
cil plainly indicate that the young men of
California whose ancestors assisted in the
preservation of the Union have the ability
and patriotism to take up the work where
their fathers lay it down. â '.*â¢',
The Sons of "Veterans will ( surely be
come a powerful organization in Califor
nia. As the State grows in population by
immigration new material will be pro
vided for re-enforcement. The grandsons
as well as the sons will be eligible until a
great organization, capable of wielding a
powerful influence for the good of the
country, will be created.
In 1898 the veterans f*nd the Sons of
Veterans will camp at Nevada City; in
1899 they may assemble in San Diego;
in 1900 all raay assemble in San Fran
cisco. The closing year of the century
may be accepted as a proper time for a
reunion of all the surviving veterans on
the Pacific Coast. By that time the Sons
of Veterans will be able to present a su
perb marching column, and bring to pub
lic notice companies properly drilled and
appropriately uniformed for escort duty
ana ceremonial pa tits.
EXPERTS lE^TIPX AT PRESTO.
Close of the Prosecution's Case in the
Trial of banders.
I FRESNO, Cal., April 24.â The prose
cution rested its c?.se to-day in the forgery
trial of Professor W. A. Sanders. Carl
Eisenschimmel, the expert on whom the
prosecution relied principally to prove
that ths signature to the $1400 draft was
a forgery and who made a serious mis
take while testifying yesterday , in pro
nouncing a letter submitted, to him on
cross-examination to have been written
by the defendant, whÂ«*n in fact it was the
writing of Captain E. A. Yon Schmidt of
San Francisco, went on the stand again
this morning and explained ,his error,
rie said that he had taken a hasty glance
before passing his opinion on it. Upon
closer examination to-day, the expert
.aid, he could easily see that the writing
was not that of Sanders.
John Reichman and W. H. McKenzie, !
two local experts, then positively pro
nounced the disputed signatures to be
forgeries. This concluded the case for the
people and the , court adjourned until
Monday morning when the defense will
begin the introduction of testimony.

Murder and Suicide Committed at the

OGDEN, Utah, April 24.â Just as the
Union Pacific flier was about to start for
the East to-night John Ross shot and
killed Glenna Carter and turning the re
volver on himself -blew out his brains.
The tragedy was enacted at the depot.
Both were from Salt Lake and the girl
was the daughter of respectable parents
in tbat city. Ross was originally from
Hamilton. Ohio.
The trouble arose from Ross' jealousy
over the attentions paid by anotner man
to the girl and with whom she had left
Salt Lane. On Thursday, beiore leaving
Salt Lake on a hunt for Miss Carter, who
was known here as Mamie Evans, Ross,
wrote a letter addressed to the public ask

MARKET STREET, CORNER TAYLOR AND GOLDEN GATE AVENUE.
SAYS THE JUSTICE
ABETTED MURDER
Boy Assassin Accuses a
Town Magistrate of
Calabasas.
Frank Valdez Claims He Was
Hired to Kill Merchant
Lorden.
Alleges That He Was to Receive
$100 for Taking a
â¢y Life.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 24.â Frank
Valdez, the young sheep-herder arrested
for the murder of Michael Lorden, the
merchant of Calabasas who was assassi
nated in his store last Wednesday night,
made a sensational confession here to-day,
implicating Justice of the Peace N. M.
Richardson as an accessory in the crime.
Constable Brans-combe of Calabasas ar
rested young Valdez, brought him to this
city this forenoon and took him to the
District Attorney's office, where, in the
presence of District Attorney Darnell, As
sistant Attorney Williams, Branscombe
and a stenographer, Valdez related the de
tails of the crime and made his sensa
tional charges against Justice of the Peace
Richardson. The murderer is only a boy,
17 years of age.
"I was offered $100 by Justice -of the
Peace Richardson to - murder Lorden,"
said he, "and while I might have killed
him in time, this was not the reason I
killed Lorden then. He cursed and abused
me and I didn't like it, and when he came
toward me with the ax handle I had to
protect myself. It was five days ego that
Richardson made me that offer. I was
going along the road by his house, ana he
called to me. He said, 'How do,' and
after talking a little while he asked me if
I wonld like to make $100. I said that I
would, and then he told me that he would
give me $100 if I would go and murder
Lorden, as he wanted to get his Govern
ment claim. I did not say then whether
I would take the job or not, and he told
me to stop back in the evening when I
went past, and I did, and I said then that
I would take the. job.
"The reason I did not go right to Lor
den's place and kill him was Because I
wanted to think the . matter over. : When
I went to the store Wednesday evening I
wouldn't have killed him if, he hadn't
abused me and threatened to kill me. I
would have killed him, though, at some
time. No, Richardson never gave me any
money and he never when I was to
get the money if I killed Lorden."
. Vnldez bad confessed the crime to Con
stable riraiiscnmbe before be was brought
to Los A tuples and this officer believes
that the Justice learned of the sensational
char c* made by the prisoner, for he says
Richardson sent a friend away after
weapon and the latter handed a revolver
to the Justice just as he. backed up by
Constable Nash, approached the village
jail. Branscorabe leveled his revolver and
commanded them to halt.
"If you come another inch I will kill
you," he yelled to Richardson, and when
Constable Nash called out. that he was
with the Justice, Branscombe repeated
his injunction and added that he would
kill the constable as soon as he would the
Justice of the Peace.
''We have come after that prisoner, and
we are going to take him before the local
Justice "or examination," called Richard
son, but to this Branscombe replied that
he did not propose to have anything to do
with him, and he would bold Valdez.
Justice Richardson, so Branscombe as
serts, ordered him to bring Valdez before
him for examination, but to this he con
tinued obdurate and, though he was cited
to appear before the Justice next Tuesday
for contempt of court, he stood by his
guns and the others retired, seeing that
he could not be made to surrender.
CONSOLIDATING TWO DAILIES.
"Morning Herald and "Evening Ex
press " to Be Issued From the *
Same Office.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 24.â The
Evening Express to-day discharged all of
its printers. On Monday it will be set up
on the Herald Linotype machines, will be
printed on the Herald presses and issued
from the Herald office. Without an abso
lute statement to that effect being made,
itis believed that this means a practical
consolidation of the two dailies, the Ex
press to be an evening edition of the
Herald.
This move has been anticipated for
some time, and because of the conditions
that thus admit of the coalition of a
Democratic morning and Republican
evening paper, the near future is ex
pected to witness the establishment of an
out-and-out Democratic daily that will
whoop it up for Bryan, free silver and
such things without restraint.
It is known that some of the largest and
most influential stockholders of the Demo
cratic Herald are also large and influen
tial holders of the stock of .the Republican
Times, and lhat the manager of the Demo
cratic Herald has been a life-long Re
publican, was formerly business manager
of the Times and is a warm iriend of
Colonel Otis.
Similar inconsistent conditions prevail
on the Express. The Democratic contin
gent of Los Angeles and Southern Cali
fornia is said to be fretting under the be
lief that these conditions prevent a prop
erly enthusiastic support of their doc
trines, and a company is formed with a
brother-in-law of Carter Harrison at its
head to launch i. Democratic daily within
the next few days.

FRESNO, Cal., April 24.â The body of
Herman Nixdorff, a German laborer, was
found hanging to a tree just below the
railroad bridge across the San Joaquin
River at Herndon this morning. The
deceased was 35 years of age and had
been a recent inmate of the county hos

WHY YOU HAVE
Blood Poison.
BLOOD POISON IS MANIFESTED BY
some' local disease of the skin. It may'
j be sores, pimples or a scaly condition of
I the skin. If you have any form of skin
| disease your blood is poisoned. When all
â  organs and different elements of the body
! are healthy nature rebels against all in-
-1 fection.
To keep the different organs and tissues
I in a healthy condition your stomach must
| digest all food that is necessary to rebuild .
â¢he waste that is continually going on in
the system.
If you nave dyspepsia, indirectly it puts
| your general system in a condition sus-
l ceptible to the many different diseases of
I the blood.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla clears the.
j stomach, stimulates tne gland* that se-
j crete the digestive fluids and keeps these
i glands in a healthy condition. By the'
I moderate use of this wonderful tissue-
rebuilder and digestive stimulant- you
I can have pure blood and a perfect im-
j munity from blood poisons. If you are
j suffering from any form of skin disease'
I purify your blood. Chronic ulcers on the
limbs are indications of impure blood. -
Eczema, rough skin, pimples, all tell your
blood is impoverished.
Your liver must work to perfection, as
the secretions from the liver digest all
fatty food that is taken into the alimen- '
tary canal. Undigested fats in the ali-
mentary canal decompose and are ab-
sorbed into the blood, thus causing many
disagreeable diseases of the blood and
skin. Keep your liver active by using .
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Uremic poison is a very fatal disease.
The kidneys become clogged by the many,
excretions from the body. They cease to
perform their functions, the system reab-
i sorbs this poisonous matter, causing one
j of t c most latal diseases, of the blood
(uremic poison). Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
j parilia makes active kidneys, acting as a
mild vegetable stimulant, as it contains
not one particle of mineral drugs, such as -
mercury, lodide, potash or mineral acids,
to cause irritation of the kidneys, which
so ofl"n results in some form of chronic
disease of tho kidneys.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla givea
good, rich, red blood, good digestion
and strong nerve*.Wit Â«ââ,. fifall

i
Postmaster McCoppm Heartily In
dorses th.2 Li: cola Idea.
A Check.
Enthusiasm lor the proposed Lincoln
monument continues to rise on all sides.
Letters pour in on Professor W. W. Stone,
president of tne League Association, and
wherever the loyal members of the Q. A.
R. are gathered" together there the pros
pect of commemorating the famous war
President in this State is approvingly com
mented on.
During the past State encampment of
the Grand Army of tlie Republic Colonel
C. .Mason Kmne, chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions, arose from his seat
and said :
Department commanderâ The name of Lin
coln is everywhere revered.
Lincoln, the statesman, the patriot, the Pres
ident, the commander-in-chief of the army
and navy of and for the Union.
Washington the father, Lincoln the savior
of our country.
To the memory of our martyred President
no monument stands to-day on the Pacific
Coast.
A Lincoln Monument League has been or
ganized in California by comrades of the San
Francisco Grand Army posts, assisted by the
Sous of Veterans, for the purpose of raising
funds by popular subscription for a monu
ment to be erected in Golden Gate Park to the
memory <if Abraham Lincoln.
The commander-in-chief of the Grand Army
ot the Republic and the National president of
the Woman's Relief Corps heartily approve of
the patriotic movement.

cities, superintendents of schools and patriotic
citizens everywhere most heartily comment.
the idea, and it now rests with this encamp
ment to place its seal of approbation upon the
project by an official indorsement. In order
therefore to place this matter before you for
action, I offer you the following resolution:
Resolved. That this department of California
and Nevada, Grand Army of the Republic, in en
campment assembled, hereby approve and Indorse
the principles and organization of the association
known as the Lincoln Monument League of (.'ali
for. la authorizing and requesting its newly
elected department commander to further the
movement In every possible manner, permitting
and urging the several posts In the department to
secure membership in and contributions for the
league, to the end that a suitable monument
to the memory of Lincoln may be erected at the
Golden Gate of the Pacific as a fitting testimonial
of loyalty to country and an enduring precept of
patriotism to our coming generations.
The resolution was received with loud
and prolonged applause and adopted with
out a dissenting voice.
This important action of the State en
campment makes the Lincoln Monument
League an integral part of the Grand
Army, and gives it an official status that
ensures it the confidence and respect of
the entire State. This gratifying condi
tion of affairs could hardly be otherwise;
the material of the various committees
has been selected with the greatest care,
men having the entire confidence of their
respective posts having been called into
council in the preliminary organization.
General Chipman, the new department
commander, is in thorough and hearty ac
cord with the league, and will aid it by
every means in his power.
lt is understood tbat in the near future
he will issue a general order on this sub
ject, calling upon members all over the
coast to consider themselves recruiting
officers for the Lincoln Monument League.
Book of certificates are to be -sent out to
tbe posts of the coast and through the
posts to every considerable corporation.
Secretary Peck has a number of letters
from tbe interior of the State ask in.: for
information about the proposed "brancb
leagues." '!~'\.f :--
It is proposed to organize a number of
branches in the various parts of tiie State,
in this way minimizing the labor of
organization and collection. One letter
from an enthusiastic schoolteacher in San
Benito la worthy of mention. She writes
without solicitation and inclosed a 25-cent
coin to pay for her membeiship, promis
ing to bring the matter before her school.
The delegates to the late encampment
procured a large numberof membership
certificates. These certificates are now
scattered all over the State, acting as a
vanguard of the army that is to follow.
It is understood that on Monday books
will be sent to every post in the jurisdic
tion, calling upon member? not only to
join themselves, but to induce others to
join.
Twelve thousand circulars were sent ent
among the schools last Friday; the bal
ance, amounting to Ã¼bout 30,000, will go
out to-morrow. . Jj.{.. ry- yiy
The officers of the league nre justly,
elated over the outlook. On Wednesday
next a general meeting of the whole league
is to be held at Foresters' Hall for the pur
pose of perfec ing arrangements for a gen
eral move along the whole line.
Several prominent citizens have urged
the advisability of a grand mass-meeting
at . Metropolitan Temple, offering to pay
all expenses.

The Knights of Tara form an Irish pa

Knights of the Red Branch. Their object
is to keep in tbe minds of the Irish and
their descendants that love of country so
commendable to all races. Yet, the mem
bers of this organization while patriotic
to the land of their birth are none the
less loyal American citizens.
One of tbe principal objects of to-day's
outing is that one-half of the proceeds of

Sheriff Thomas Desmond and Captain
Samuel P. Smith, whose names were men
tioned in yesterday's Call as those who
figured so prominently in the rescue of
the Irish patriots confined in a prison cell

EXCELS IN THREE ARTS
Little Pearl Ladd Creates Sur
prise at the Califor
nia.
She Acts, Dances and Gives a Dif
ficult Pianoforte Re
cital.
A remarkable impression was created at
the California Theater last night by Pearl
Ladd, the child pianist, actress and dancer.
The little girl is only just entering on her
teens and her pianoforte recital alone
was a remarkable effort of the memory
and artistic ability for a child. To this,
however, was added the "Potion scene"
from "Romeo and Juliet." which was no
mere reciting, for Pearl Lndd gave it with
wonderful dramatic intuition.
To complete her tours de force the
child's programme concluded with some
skillful dancing.
The pianoforte recital embraced light
difficult selections, such as might appear
in the repertoire of any adult pianoforte
virtuoso. Pearl Ladd played them with
out a note of music and never for a mo
ment showed nervousness or hesitation.
Her recital opened with Handel's
"Harmonious Blacksmith, " in the diffi
cult variations of which she was especially
at home. A Chopin ''Berceuse" was
played with erace and feeling, and Grieg's
"Norwegian Bridal Proce-sion'' was . iven
with a keen appreciation of the character
istic music. ;3SSkÃl
There were two Liszt numbers on the
programme, the transcription of "Rico
jetto" and the "Hungarian Rhapsodic No.
12." which presents enormous technical
difficulties . â¢ rj .â¢.-.-. J:\yj.
Pearl Ladd not only wrestled brilliantly
with tbe technical difficulties, but she
made the themes sing even when they
were embroidered wilh variations.
In . Moszkowski's "Valse in A flat
major" she did did some especially good
phrasing, as well as in Weber's "Invita
tion to the Dunce," and in Gottschalk's
"Tremolo" her virtuosity especially im
pressed her audience.
In addition to her recital Miss Ladd,
played Beethoven's "Sonata No, 5," for
violin and piano, with Nathan Land*.

A PUBLIC PARK
FOR THE MISSION
Pleasure Grounds Are Not
Equally Located in
the City.
Heavy Taxpayers Will Pre
sent a Feasible Show
ing.
The 0 d Cemeteries Are Claimed to
Bj the Ideal Spot for a Rec
reation Site.
Between now and the Ist of July the
taxpayers and residents of the Mission
will make their influence felt before the
Supervisors when sitting as a Board of
Equalization.
The topic uppermost in the minds of
the Mis-ion peonle is the question of a
suitable piece of property for a public
park. The grounds already selected by
those who have given the question con
sideration are the two blocks formerly
used as cemeteries and known as the "Old
Mission Jewish burying grounds." This
piece of land is located between Eigh
teenth street on the north. Twentieth on
the south, Dolores on the east and Church
on the west, with Nineteenth street run
ning between.
Each of those squares or blocks runs 520
north and south, with 560 east and west,
except the block bounded by Eighteenth
and Nineteenth and Dolores and Church,
in which the City owns 30x37:6 feet. The
remainder of the entire block is owned by
the Home of .Peace Cemetery Association,
and is designated as block 86, Mission
survey. The other block, 87,, is owned by
the Congregation Sherith Israel.
The trustees having in charge these
block?, when approached one year ago by
a committee from the Mission Improve-
ment Club, r.f which Judge F. W. Van
Reynegnm was the chairman, held out a
favorable chance to dispone of the land at
what was then considered a fair price.
The negotiations for the purchase of
those blocks were deferred in consequence
of the moro urgent one of baying a high
school in the Mission.
The gentlemen tbat represented tbe
people in the Mission Improvement Club
tbere are to the fore now, principally
among whom are: Judge Van Revnpgom,
J. H. Gready. A. B. Macuire. G. W. Kelly,
E. V. O'Brien, A. P. Van Duzer, Mayor
Phelan, G. W. Shadburne, G. W. Cen tor
and many others, who will once more ap
pear before the Supervisors to prosecute
thefr claim.
NOT THE ASHLEYS-
Two Ladles at the Baldwin Deny an
- Allegation.
A story originating in the office of a pri- '
vate detective in this City a tew days ago
war. to the effect that the Ashley girls of
Pasadena were in town and that tbey bad
brought a contract for E. J. Baldwin to
sign, making him responsible for the care
of the infant child of Miss Lillian Ashley.
On Wednesday last two ladies register
ing as Mrs. B. Lay and Miss F. Lay of
Chicago arrived at the Baldwin Hotel and
were assigned to suite 230, third floor, on
the Powell-street side, tome time after
ward the suspicions of the hotel people
were aroused that the new arrivals were
none other than Lillian Ashley, the nem
esis of E. J. Baldwin, and her sister,
Emma As i ley. There were some strong
points in resemblance, so it was stated.
Different efforts were made to get them
to tell If tney were really the Ashleys, as
had been suspected. They denied that
they were other than .they seemed to be.
A morning paper published a story yes
terday involving substantially these de
tail-.
Yesterday Attorney H. I. Kowalsky.
Manager Stone and others saw the ladies!
They reiterated that they were from Chi
cago and that they were Mrs. and Miss
Lay, and not the A*-hleys. Yet the hotel
people are not satisfied. â "â ' r JJy
"I went up to see them to-day," said
Manager Stone last night, ''and was ac
companied by Colonel Kowalsky. They
were told that if they were the Ashley's
tbey must at once leave the hotel. * But
they declared they were not th* Ashleys,
and didn't know them. * One of them said
she was Mrs. Lay, the wile of a retired
business man of Chicago, and. that her
companion was her sister. They had a
little child, 3 or 4 years old, witn tbem.
lt looked like a gin.
"I had been assured positively by a
man that I , knew tbat one of them was
Miss Ashley, but Colonel Kowalsky, who
knew her, said when he came away that
it wasn't Miss -Ashley :at all. I didn't
know what to do about it I can't tell. **; I
will try and find out to-morrow. This
lady said she telegraphed tbis morning to

THE LAST APPEAL
FOR DURRANT
It Will Be Made to the
United States Supreme
Court
On the Ground That His Rights
as a Citizen Have Been
Inlringed.
Governor Budd Asked to Grant a
Reprieve anl S?**y of Execution
in the Meantime.
Eugene N. Deuprey, counsel for Dur
rant, has perfected his papers on appeal
to the United States Supreme Cr-urt at
Washington, and they will be presented
to Chief Justice Fuller. It is likely, how
ever, that Justice Field will have charge
of the matter, it being within his terri
torial jurisdiction, Chief Justice Fuller
having the preference as a matter of cour
tesy.
The ground on which the Supreme
Court wilt be asked to intervene is that
Durrani's rights as a citizen of the United
States have been infringed throughout
tbe whole course of the proceedings
against him.
It was expected that an appeal would
be bad to the United States Circuit Court
here, but it was found that in case of an
unfavorable decision at the hands of that
tribunal the time for an appeal to the Su
preme Court at Washington, D. CL, would
be too close upon the date set .or the exe
cution, June 11.
There was no hope from the Supreme
Court of this State, and there were cer
tain indications leading to the suspicion
tbat an appeal to tbe United Stales Cir
cuit Court would not tie productive of
favorable results, so it was decided to take
tbe direct appeal to the highest i tribunal
in th9,l%ridJjyJ'y.:?jJjyi.., i .
, Simultaneously with this movement the
necessary papers ware prepared for pre
sentation to Governor Budd asking him
for a reprieve until alter the United States
Supreme Court shall have rendered an
opinion on the merits of the appeal.
Should the opinion be unfavorable to the
condemned man Governor Budd will be
asked to commute the death penalty to
imprisonment for life.
Several persons called upon the Gov
ernor shortly after bis arrival from Sacra
mento and laid the matter before him.
The Governor has the matter under ad
viemi'iii. It is not believed that be will
refuse to grant the reprieve so long as
Mr. Deuprey shall have a spark of hope
left, to save his client. The fact that the
conviction was baaed upon circumstantial
evidence will have great weieht in Dur
rani's favor, so far as a stay of execution

STANFORD'S HIGH JINKS.
A Great Entertainment Tendered
to the Grand Parlor
N. S. G. W.
Twelve Hundre.*. Native Sons Listened
10 Mirth, Music and Song and
Ea 5 a Jolly Gool Time
There were nearly 1200 Native Sons of
tbe Golden West in the banquet - hall of
the Native Sons building last night. More
than one-third of the number was com
posed of representative-- irom all parts of
the Golden Slate, being delegates irom the
subordinate parlors to the Grand Parlor,
which will meet in its twentieth session at
Redwood City to-morrow.
The occasion of this great gathering was

a bigh jnks tendered the delegates by
Stanforu Parlor No. 76. Tim Is an an
nual function of this parlor just preceding
the meeting of the Grand Parlor, and each
year it takes measure* to excel tne pre

questionably the best Stanford Parlor has
ever given. The affair was under the sup
ervision of Henry S. Martin, J. J. Mc-
Carthy, D. A. Curt in, CD. St iger, G. D.
Phillips and Dr. W. H. Sieberst.
Henry S. Martin, the jolly grand treas
urer of the order, actec as director-gen
era!, and he was presented, with a hand
some star as a badge of bis ollice. It was
of the finest quality of tin.
The assemblage was called to order by
Harrison Housewortb, president of the
parlor, who in a few words welcomed the
Native Sons and advise! them to make
themselves merry and enjoy the hos
pitality of Stanford No. 76. \.y^y
There were a number of artists from the
Tivoli and the Orpheum by courtesy of
the managers of these places, and the
numbers they presented added much to
the excellence of tbe entertainment. The
programme included the following:
Bass solo, C. L. Parent Jr. ; vocal selections,
Golden Gate Quartet of colored warblers; imi
tation of mus. cal instruments without instru
ments. Wil am Masset; vocal solo, W. H.

Stanford Pa-lor by the composer, Eugene A.
Beauce, and vocal solos *>y Rhys Thomas and
Ferris Hartman of the Tivoli.
During the evening there was passed
around pipes, tobacco, sandwiches and re

before "Home, Sweet Home" was played,
and the Native Sons parted with "we'll
meet again in Redwood."

Vital Organs at Work.
The doctors will do laundry work on the
inside of your stomach now, while they

smoothly, just as an engineer watches the |
piston strokes of his compound engine.
They are doing these and other wonder
ful things with the X my here in San j
Francisco. They can tell in a minute, by I
standing you up beside a Crookes tube,
â¢whet your heart is enlarged, and if you
want to see your own heart you can do so
by means of the X ray.
Some new points about tbe use of the
X ray in medicine were brought out at
last Tuesday evening's session of the
State Medical Association, when Dr. Philip
Mills Jones stated the general status of
the discovery as applied to medicine, and
Dr. Albert Abrams illustrated with lan
tein-siiJes some results of his own experi
ments.
This cleansing of the stomach is a new
thing, but the only connection with the
X ray that it hus is ihe fact that the X
ray "enables the operating physician to
watch tbe scrubbing of the stomach. A
few days ago dispatches told of its being
done by a Chicago physician, but at the
meeting of the State Medical Association
Dr. Abrams asserted that be had done it a
month or so earlier than the Windy City
medico.
This work is now done mainly in cases
of catarrh of the stomach, when the in
ner membrane become*) covered with a
mucous coat. The simplest way to re
move a useless coating from any surface is
to scrub it off.
. Tbat is just what the new operation
amounts to. An instrument has been de
vised for the purpose. It is called a
gyromele. It consists of a flexible tube,
at one end of whicb is a sponge-coaled
spindle, about two inches ion.; and a balf
inch in diameter. This is attached to a
-flexible shaft which runs through the tube,
at the other end of which is a wheeled ar
rangement tbat will revolve the shaft and
the sponge. The patient swallows tbis j
tube, sponge end first, as be would a
Btomacb-pump, and when the doctor
grinds at the upper end the sponge in the
stomach revolves with a scrubbing effect.
The tube curls up easily, and as it is
pushed in and out a little and turned it
caches every portion of the inside of the
stomach. _'â¢ ..." 'J-tJ.V'
Soap suds are always appropriate to
â¢scrubbing, and soap suus are actually used
in this operation. The flexible tube con
tains an inner tube as well as the shaft for
the sponge, and through this inner tube a
washing composition in which there is a
little soap as well as other things is in
jected.
All this could be done blindly and by
gue-s work, but now comers the X ray
apparatus which enables tbe physician to
see the position and movements of the !
aponge in the stomach.
.A Call reporter saw this demonstrated
in Dr. Abrams' laboratory last nigbt. The
exposition was a marvelous one with all
tbe X ray wonders that have been re
counted.
' A half dozen physicians were there to
observe an examination of . a patient
brought from tbe Marine Hospital. He
was a brawny negro sailor, thick of frame
ana apparently in perfect health. Dr. C.
W. Dodee of the Marine Hospital was
treating him for an aneurism of the aorta.
An aneurism is a sack which is protruded
prom a weakened point in a blood Teasel.
It forms a sort of estuary for the blood
current. The elastic membrane stretches
more and more under the pressure from
the heart, the sack lengthens, and death
comes with rupture. In this case the
aneuri-jta was plainly evident by the
shouldÂ»j;i-blade iii the back, where the
bulging sack throbbed with esch heart
beat. But what could not be told was the
point along the aorta where the aneurism
started, and the X ray was invited to re
veal it.
A big static electrical machine was set
in motion and a Crookes tube was con
nected. In the dark the now familiar
box-like fluoroscope can be dispensed
wiih. The room was made dark except
lor the faint, weird, trembling glow of the
Crookes tube, tbe patient was backed up
; against the lube, and a simple fluorescent
| screen was placed against the patient's
! breast. *. â¢*-â¢*-.'>*
It was as though the screen was a
\ window in the man. O.i the screen in
! dim shadow were cast the rib', while a
| large dark shadow revealed tbe heart.
This shadow regularly expanded and con
tracted a little, showing plainly the tell
ing of the heart. At tbe top of the breast
tone was a blotch of shadow which
should not have been there, and it was
made plain that this was the aneurism
and that It was at the lop of the arch of
the aorta. Dr. Dodge had located surely
and quickly wiat it was not otherwise in
the range of medical science to locate.
Another patient . stood before the
Crookes tnbe and swallowed the gyromele
with which he was being treated. * On the
screen there was a space lighter than the
rest, indicating the stomach by the ab
sence of other more opaque organs, and
into this light space the sponge and the
tube behind it wore seen to come and
then to turn and curl against tbe wall of
the stomach.
The accompanying study by the artist
shows this more distinctly than did the
fluoroscope, but it was nevertheless evi
dent as a moving shadow of a tube. The
diaphragm was shown a-, a curved line of
shadow, the liver was a. shadowy mass
witbout clear outline, and the ribs and
heart were faint shadows above. A coin
placed in. the back was plainly shown in
front with tbe band that held it.
By stooping over a little and looking nt
his own stomach, or rather at the window
over it, the patient could see inside of him
the thing that was disgusting him, and be
could see the twinkling of the shadow
that was cast by his heart. The pulse
could be counted from across the room.
There is weirdness enveloping one of
these scenes, but this is what we are com
ins to: â¢Wel), let's see your heart," the
doctor now will lay.
KRELING BESTS GREENLAND.
The Olympic Club Man Victorious in the
Wrestling Contest at Port*
land.
PORTLAND, Or., April 24.â Charles
Kreling, champion catch -as- catch-can
wrestler ol the Pacific Coast, defeated
Herbert"Greenland"of 'Portland to-night
in the most closely contested match ever
seen in this city. The first bout was won
by Kreling in 1 hour 23 minutes with a
balf-Ne<son with a quick change to an
armhold. The second bout was won by
Greenland in 3 minutes and 54 seconds on
a flying fall. The third bout was won by
tbe Olympic man after 5 minutes and 19
seconds of fast and sc entitle wrestling,
with a hammerlock with a quick roll.
It was pronounced the best amateur ex
hibition of wrestling ever witnessed in
Postland. Greenland is a Greco- Roman
wrestler, and defeated Kreling last June
at this style of wrestling. The San Fran
cisco man had tbe advantage of bis oppo
nent in weight and style of wrestling.
In the first bout the Multnomah man
proved to be a surprise to Kreling in the
latter's favorite style. Kreling was in
first-class condition and was on the ag
gressive from the moment the men stepped
on the mat.
Some slight dissatisfaction was. ex
pressed at Referee Bosnian's decision on
the last bout, but all agreed that tbe best
man won at tbat style of wrestling.

H* Considers the Conduct cf Dr.
Selling and Dr. S'ioson an
Outrag .
'â â â 'â â  ' . \ '
Further investigation into the death of
Mrs. Mary 11. Loring, 5 Gordon street, last
Sunday morning, has determined Coroner
Hawkins to lay the full , case before the
Grand Jury, with the view of bringing in
indictments against Miss Dr. Selling for
beinf* an accessory to tbe fact and Dr.
Stinson for removing the organs of the
deceased and not notifying the Coroner or
police.
Detectives Gibson and Wren called at
the Morgue yesterday and delivered to
Deputy Coroner McCormick tbe missing
organs of the deceased. The detectives
said that Miss Dr. Selling had possession
of the organs and had delivered them to
the keeping of the detectives only after a
peremptory demand had been made upon
her.
The detectives said further that Miss
Dr. Selling had at first denied that Mrs.
Loring bad made a written statement be
iore she died, but when they insisted that
they had evidence that the deceased had
done so, Dr. Selling produced the im
portant document, of which a copy was
published in yesterday morning's Call.
When the detectives saw Dr. Stinson he
told them that he was called Into the case
about tlnee weeks ago by Dr. Selling,
After working on Mrs. Loring he finally
advised her removal to the Waideck,
where he and Dr. Selling performed an
operation upon her, but she died eighteen
hours later irom peritonitis.
"There never was," said Dr. Stinson,
"any statement made to me about the
husband's treatment of his wife. Dr.
Selling had charge of the case and I sup
posed she knew all about it. After Mrs.
Loring's death I toot the organs ont and
took them to ray office as I wanted to
keep them for scientific purposes. * I
might have done wrong in doing this, but
thought 1 had a right to do it."
"Why did you not report the case to the
Coroner?'' was asked.
"If I had. known as much as I know
now," replied Dr. Stinson. "I would hare
done so. Tbe fact is, 1 left everything to
Dr. Selling, as ii was her case."
The Coroner considers the whole affair
an outrage. He says that Dr. Selling
I should at least have notified the Board of
Health of the dying statement made by
Mrs. Loring when she and Dr. Stinson
signed the death certificate. He says
further that Secretary Godchaux of the
Board of Health should notify him in
every suspicious case of death by perito
nitis or sept uremia. He regards Miss
Dr. Selling's denial of the existence o' the
statement of the deceased as very suspi
cious. .He will take the matter before the
Grand Jury, and has asked the assistance
of the detectives in having a full investi
gation into the conduct of the two doctor".
Detectives Gibson and \Vren have sev
eral'more witnessei to interrogate yet.
They have called at their residences, but
as they appear to object to being mixed
up in the case it is difficult to find them.
The body of Mrs. Loring was taken yes
terday afiernoon to Holy Cross Cemeiery
and rein red there.
Loring, the husband, is in the City
Prison, still nursing a sore head and a
sprained ankle. He refuses to mako any

DIPPING INTO THE RESERVE.
N arly a Million Dollars in Gold Taken
" ' "Frcm 'a Sub- Treasury tor Shp- '
ment to Europe.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 24â Notice
of the first heavy withdrawal of goid from
the sub-treasury at New York since the
gold reserve took an upward tendency,
shortly after the last bond sale, was re
ceived at the Treasury Department to
day. Assistant Treasurer Jordan tele
graphed an order for $977,000 In gold bul
lion to be withdrawn for export. The de
partment officials said tbey had teen ex
pecting this for some time, as the balance
of trade is in our favor during the winter
and against us in the spring. The enor
mous exports of wheat, however, bave
caused an exception in our favor up to the
present time this year.
May is tbe month of the heaviest with
drawals for shipments abroad, and the
notice given to-day is considered at the
treasury to mark the beginning of a regu
lar practice. There is no danger, however,
of .the depletion of the gold reserve, which
to-day amounted to $155,262,753 in coin
and bullion. The legal gold reserve for
the redemption of United States notes is
$100,000,000, but the rest of the amount \
named is credited to tbe fund and can be
used if the demands exceed the smaller
figure.
It is believed at the treasury that the j
withdrawals will continue until August, \
when trade changes will bring the gold
back again. Although the treasury., offi
cials have no information on the subject,
they think that the recent action of Japan
going on a gold basis may have had some
thing to do with to-day's notice. Japan
draws on London for gold and London
draws on New York to supply the de- j
mand.
CANADA'S NEW TARIFF.
Not a Had. cal Change, but Framed to
Offset Some of the Dingley Bill's :
Provisions.
OTTAWA, Cawada, April 24.-The new
Canadian tariff outlined in Parliament!
by the Liberal' administration is not a
radical departure from the old protective
tariff, and is generally considered a de
cided step in the direction of free trade.
In some respects it is more favorable to
the United States than the old tariff.
1 here is a moderate reduction of duties in
a large number of lines, and a big cut in
the duty on iron, woolens, sugar, flour
cornmeal and agricultural staples. The
duty on mining machinery is abolished,
while corn is free, except for distilling j
purposes.
American manufacturers must profit by j
the removal of specific duties on iron and
steel, especially m regard to a particular
article of screws, in tbe manufacture of
which Canadians cannot successfully com
pete. In refined sugar there is a reduc
tion of 14 cents per hundred pounds.
The tariff on spirituous and malt uquors
and tobacco is largely increased. The
duty on coal of 60 cents a ton is retain
If tbe American Government would loave
the duty at 40 cents instead of increasing
it to 75 cents, as proposed in the Dingley
bill, Canada is prepared to meet tbe
United States in that line. If, . however,
tbe Dingley tax is maintained, the Gov
ernment slates that it will not only raise
the duty on bituminous coal to the same
figure, but will also restore the 50 cent
duty on anthracite.
The most important feature in the new
tariff is the double schedule. This new
departure irom any policy before adopted
by Canada will probably seriously affect
the United States. By the announcement
of this fact the Government accepts, the
idea of a general tariff to be levied upon
goods from countries giving Canada n<> !
tiade advantages and of a special tariff!
applicable to mi ports from Great Britain
and other countries that permit imports
of Canadian goods free of duty or at rain
imun rates.
The Government views the policy of the
nited States and even the schedules of
he Dingley bill as not precluding the
negotiation of a reciprocity treaty be
tween Canada and the United States. If,
however, the Dingley bill were to become \
I a law it would seriously affect the trade of j
j Canada with the United States. Under j
these circumstances the Government an
nounces that while it does not favor re
taliation it is well at present not to ex
tend to goods from tbe United States the
measure of tariff reform now brought
down. Tbere is no hostility implied.
United States products will be admitted
at former dutie** pending the time when
the American Government may remove
tbe barriers to a freer interchange of trade
commodities between the two countries.
One of the Fleet of Gasoline Boats That the New Ruling: of the Supervising: Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers Will Condemn to Idleness.
The special tar ff provides for a special
preference of 12"^ per cent, and means
that on Britisii Importations the duty will
be reduced one-eighth. This preference
will continue until July 1 of next year,
after which the preference will be in
creased to one-fourth, or a reduction in
duty of 25 per cent.
Many here consider tbis to be the first
step in the breakdown of protection on
the Continent, since the effect this new
policy will hare upon the public must
convince the United States of the incon
venience of maintaining so high a tariff

Smuggling from Canada must eventually

tion required from all engineers under the
rules. -Such vessels cannot be licensed to
carry passengers for hire or otherwise. Notify
, the Portland and Beattie boards.
When the ga-oline steam schooner first
j came into use she was simply classed as '
i a sailing vessel, and nine times out of ten
the captain was also the engineer. Feb
ruary last Congress passed a law making !
"all vessels of above fifteen tons burden, j
carrying freight or passengers for hire, [
propelled by cas, fluid, naphtha or Â©lee- j
trie motors, shiÂ»il be and are hereby made j
subject to all the provisions of section j
I 412b of the Revised Statutes of the United '
j Mates relating to the inspection of hulls
and boilers and reouiring engineers and
pilots. * * *"
In connection with the above the Su
pervising Inspector-General issued the j
following:
Supervising and local Inspectors of steam
vessels are directed to r.otiiy Hie owners or j
agents of all vessels of above fifteen gross tous j
wilhin their various districts, propelled by I
gas, fluid, naphtha or electric motors, em
ployed in carrying freight or passenger* for !
hire, lhat sucn vessels are subject to the same I
Inspection as are steam vessels and that such
vessels must also carry a censed engineer
nd a licensed pilot ; and in case such vessels
are navigated without such inspection or run
wlthou i a licensed engineer or a licensed pilot |
â¢ * * the inspectors shall report them lo j
the chief officers of customs tor prosecution.
This law was rigidly enforced, and every
one of the big gasoline schooners that
trade between here and Bolinas Bay,
Point Reyes, Fort Ross and other near-by
points had to employ licensed men. The
new ruling therefore came as a thunder
storm out of a clear sky. Tbe supervising
inspectors have been holding their annual
meeting, and the question of gasoline j
launches came up. It was developed that
each nud all of these boats were carrying |
combustibles in the shape of naphtha,gaso
line etc., and consequently could not be
licensed to carry passengers. When the
decision was reached Captain Berming
ham at once wired to San Francisco, and it
did not lake long to reach the ears of the
parties interested.
In all there are about thirteen gasoline
schooners engaged on the coast. Many of j
them, like the Moro, have been a long
time in the coast trade, while others have
just received their licenses end others
azain have just come off the siocks. Of |
the latter two are .'being completed for j
Ross & Hewlett, but one of them comes
under trie fifteen-ton class and there is
still time to make the other one into a i
steam schooner. .'{-iv
Among the boats that will be affected
by the new ruling will be Charlie Fair's
gasoline yacht Lucero. He will not be '
able to go on a cruise and take any guests j
with' him unless, he ships the latter as
"crew." In that event the Luce arti
cles would make interesting reading, as '
many prominent business men would ap- i
j pear on the shipping list as an A. B. deck- |
band, cook or waiter.
"In one sense, I suppose, the thing is all j
( right," said Cu-totu-house Broker Thorn-* J
ley yesterday. "It will work a terrible
hardship on these men, however, and it
looks to me like class legislation. Almost
every person connected with these gaso
line launches has his little all tied up in
them, and to refuse them a license to carry
passengers means taking the bread and
butter out of their mouths. Of course,
o her companies that hnndle gasoline,
naphtha and coal oil have 10 put on ves
sels, which are elated to carry. 'com bu.ti-
bles only,' and I suppose it is under that
section nt the Revised Statutes that the j
supervising inspectors are working. As j
far as I can see the new rule simply means
the const. of at least a dozen smart
boats to the boneyard." ' â¢
- One of the captains said yesterday: "If
I cannot carry passengers I may as well
give up. Every other Sunday I take out a
party of fishermen on an excursion that
nets me as much as a week's work. Then
my passengers to and from Fort Ross
more than pay my expenses, to, you see,
if I lone all that I cannot make both ends
meet." â¢
Supervising Inspector Bermingham is
expected back this week, and a delega
tion of laptains of gasoline schooners will
wait on him to try and get tbe ruling
i 'modified.

MAN, ARE YOU WEAK

AN ARE YOO WEAK
Some Points on the Development of True Manhood by Elec-
tricityâReasons Why Dr. .anden's Electric Belt Is the Only
Sure Remedy for the Recovery of This Vital Power.
What a great amount of happiness is destroyed by this terrible drain which Is
called Nervous Debility I You see the evidences of it in the faces of more than half
the people you meet. \
This great country of ours is a nation of nerves ; nerves which have been
drained of their vital force ; nerves which are crying out for help. And why don't
we help them? Why don't we replace the energy which has been stolen from them?
Because the medical profession, to whom we always go in time of sickness, has
no means at hand to restore nerve power. Dru*-s never build up weak nerves with-
out taking the strength from other organs of the body.
That don't pay. You might as well be sick one way as another. If you are
going to steal from your kidneys, your liver and your stomach the energy to give
temporary nourishment to your nerves you'd better let your nerves suffer and save
I your stomach anyway.
"I'm tired of drugging." We hear that remark every day. It's the wail of the
nerveless man who has lost all confidence in the old, worn-out system of medicine.
"I was practically on my last legs when I got Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. My
powers were all gone and 1 was almost a total wreck. I had spent $300 for medi-
cines, without getting any ben-fit. I improved as soon as I put the Beit on, and am
now as strong as ever," says H. KNOWLTON, 621 Kearny street? San Francisco.
That shows you what Electricity does. Fowler, the noted, .phrenologist, says
it's the instrumentality of all life.
Dr. Sanden's Belt is a simple thing. You wear it about three hours' at night.
You feel electricity going into your nerves all the time. You can regulate it your-
self; turn it on mild or strong. Every minute you soak up nerve power from it.
Even electricity is useless if not intelligently applied. Dr. Sanden has devoted
twenty years to close study of the nerve and sexual forces, and even if other belts
fail his treatment will cure.
Cheap, clumsily made electric belts are like cheap jewelry. You think you are
getting a high-class article at a low price, but your experi nee tells you that you pay
twice for what you get.
"When I bought your Belt last September I was almost a wreck from nervous
debility and losses. My liver and kidneys were in bad shape, and I used to have
emissions three or four times a week ; also losses at stool ani in my urine. After
wearing your Belt three months I felt fine ; my losses were all stopped, my digestion
was good, and I felt strong and vigorous. 1 have had no return of my trouble. I
think your Belt is the besttiing in the world for lost manhood and am pleased to
recommend it. It has made a man of me."

CIVIL SERVICE METHODS.
â¢ -â â  *> - * !
Some Interesting Imotmatwn Given the
Senate Committees by Heaas of
Departments.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 24.â The
Senate Committee investigating the civil
service methods of the last administration
to-day examined numerous dismissed em
ployes. Secretary Wilson was also be
fore the committee, expreasinir the opin
ion that the civil service laws needed
modification, particularly in regard to
agents and inspectors in his department,
as it was impossible under the regulations
to secure competent, practical men. Stat
isticians and heads of bureaus should
also, he thought, be chosen by the Secre
tary.
A letter was read by Secretary Gage
stating that, while the law was beneficial,
it could be modified to advantage. He
recommended the exemption of deputy
Collectors of Internal Revenue. The
j policy of various departments to reinstate
old soldiers ana widows who were dis
j missed by the Cleveland administration is
causing the Civil Service Commission con
siderable anxiety. In order to create the
necessary places, an equal number of
those in the classified ' service will be dis
missed "for cause." -While this will be a
violation of the spirit of the law the com
mission is powerless to prevent it.

The Spreckels cup, richest of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club's many stakes, was de
cided at lngleside track yesterday before
a laree assemblage of sport-lovers of both
sexes. To the winner went $5000 in cash
and the magnificent Spreckels cup, valued
at $1500, donated by the millionaire turf
man in whose honor the stake was
named. It was a grand struggle, and
Howard S, the brown son of imp.
"Whistlejacket, sporting the colors of the
"Western turfman, Ed Ryan, carrying
top weight, won the rich prize by a
"nod."
The race, a handicap at one and a
quarter miles, drew out all the crack
three-year-olds in training. Howard S,
even with 122 pounds in the saddle, was
made an 8 to 5 favorite and was played to
win thousands. Ed Purser's pair, Key
del Tierra and Scarf Pin, opened second
choices at 2J4 to 1, but the accounts of the
latter filly's poor work caused the odds to
recede to four against the pair.
Estaca at 7 to 1 was well backed on
glowing accounts of fast trials. Altamax,
too, with pounds and. Mike Hennessy
in the saddle, had a select following,
which eagerly accepted 10 to 1 for their
money. Vincitor and Lode Star received
a scattering play.
To a pretty start Loulou X went out in
front and led for a mile, and then the real ,
struggle began. Moving up from the
rear, Howard S was third, behind Alta
max and Key del Tierra. Mike Hennessy
astride Altamax was resorting to his vast
fund of resources to keep the Burns &
"Waterhouse colt in front, and I'iggott was
rising the favorite in typical demon fash
ion.
They raced as a team, head and head,
both jockeys ing whip and spur, and in \
that lashion passed the wire. withVinct" '
tor, four lengths away, third. Every
body eagerly waited for the number of the
winning horse to go up, but they were '
kept in suspense for some time. After
considerable deliberation the race was
given to Howard S amid great cheering. ,
The time was '2:08} _.
Of the other favorites all were beaten
with the exception of The Bachelor, which :
ran a dead heat with Lobengula. The
belting was better than for some time
past.
Rey Salazar again scored in the two
year-old run. Going to the post third
choice he led the 2 to 1 choice, Torsida,
out a length, stepping the five furlongs in
I:O2Ji. Saiabar, a4to 1 shot, was third.
A poor start contributed to tbe down
fall of the favorite in the six-furlong
sprint that followed. Pat Murphy at [
fours got away three lengths to the good, [
and in a hard 'drive -beat Major C-'ok'a !
neck in I :l4*^. George Miller, the 9 to 20 i
choice, was m ird.
The mile and a furlong selling affair re- j
sulted in a dead heat between the 5 to 2 >
favorite. The Bachelor, and the second j
choice, Lobengula, ridden by Marty Ber
gen. Addie Buchanan, with Hnzird as j
close companp, cut out tbe running to the 1
stretch, where both giew wear}*. Bergen j
on Lobengula then assumed command !
and stalling off the first choice's chal
lenge passed the wire nose and nose, and !
the judges, unable to separate them, de- j
cided a dead heat. Daylight was a good j
third.

de handicap at one and a quarter miles, i

UNHAPPY DIVORCEES.
Hereafter They Must "tValt a Tear In
California Itefore Remarriage
Yesterday was the last day allowed by
law for the filing of divorce proceedings i
that would allow of remarriage before the \
expiration of a year after the signing of j
the decree.
For several years It has been the custom !
for persons to go from the divorce courts !
to the marriage license office and to cele- i
brate their lreedom from marital ties hv
an early renewal of similar ties with other â 
persons. The ; last Legislature thought
proper to change this order of things. j
Whether this action was wise remains to
be seen, but at any rate the new law must
remain in force for at least two years, or
until a lobby of divorcees sufficiently |
strong shall be able to direct the current
of legislation in Sacramento.
It was expected that there would be a '
big rush of applicants for divorce yester
day, but this expectation was not fulfilled,
as only half a d zen actions for legal sepa- !
ration were riled with County Clerk Curry j
âa record frequently equaled during the j
busy months of domestic litigation. Fol- I
lowing is a list of the suits of those who
seek to be untied by the courts:
Emma H. Humphrey against O. J. Hum
phrey, for cruelty.
Blanche L. Husa against Otto . Ifuss, for fail
ure to provide.
Horace F. Kendall against Margaret E. Ken
dall, for desertion. ;<_/-â¢.-_
.Mrs. F. Williams against A. Williams, for
failure to provide. ' '".-'â¢â * '
Clara MoMshon against George McMahon,
for desertion. ----- * - â
Amelia Plechot against Jean Plechot, tor
neglect and desertion.
Although the wind-up of the "open sea
son" for divorces was not as lively as was
generally expected, yet there has been a
constant stream of suits since the adjourn
ment of the Leeislature that will cause
the total of the first half year to mount
much above the normal fi_nre.
Held for Kur-lary.
James Fennessey was yesterday held to an
swer before the Superior Court by Acting
Police Judge Kerrigan on the' charge of
burglary in $2000 bonds. He was arrested for
breaking into a paint shop on Sutler street
ana stealing some brushes. He ii a painter by
trade. f"-,?.<-* '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 25, 1897.
THESE WILL VOTE
FOR PURE FOOD
Delegates to the Congress
From All Parts of the
State.
Otj ct of the Gathering to
Wipe Out All Adulterated
Goods.
An Interest Programme of Ex r
ci:ej Prep ire 1 for the Two
Days' Session.
The California Pnre-food Congress to be
held in Pioneer Hall, on Fourth street,
near Market, in this City, on April 30 and
May 1, promises to be Â«he largest gather
ing of its kind ever held this side of the
Mississippi Valley. The promoters of the
congress anticipate that great good will
be achieved from the meeting, and that a
united effort will be made all over the
Slate to enforce the pure-food laws now in
the statute books of California.
The congress will be held under the aus
pices of the California Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association in conjunction
with the committee of the Council of As
sociated Industries. For several weeks
past the movement has been on foot, and
so earnestly have the several committees
been at work that nearly 500 delegates
from the various counties of the State and
the many industrial and manufacturing
organizations have signified their deter
mination to be present.
It was the first intention to hold the
congress in the large hall of the Chamber
of Commerce, but so fast were the invita
tions accepted that at their last meeting
the promoters decided to occupy Pioneer
Hall, and now even this will be' none too
large.
The objects of the movement can be
summed up briefly. Scientific examina
tions have demonstrated that 99 per cent
of the canned and preserved food products
consumed in this City and State are
adulterated with poisonous substances
and cheap substitutes. To the credit of the
State be it said that most of these impure
foods come from Eastern manufacturers
and unfortunately some of the California
manufacturers have fell compelled to
meet this cheap competition by sacrificing
the on rity of their goods in order to keep
in business. In the language of one of
the most zealous workers the situation is
expressed in these words:
"It is a shame that the people of
California are obliged to consume im
pure and adulterated foods, while every
I known food product can be produced in
this State. All varieties of berries, fruit,
: wines, olive oil, honey, etc.. raised or
produced in tbis State scarcely pay the
cost of production, yet the products of
these are put upon the market for human
consumption it: a condition not fit for the
human stomach. The pure food agita
tion in the City bas been of great benefit,
and now the dealers' and manufacturers'
agents are pushing these same adulterated
goods upon the communities of the in
terior of the State. It is to drive out of
California these dangerous foods and sub
stitute only the pure articles .that this
congress has been called."
The organ'zation of the congress and
the order of business has been under the
direction of J. A. Filcher, Julian Sonntag,
L. R. Mead, li. N. Rowley and Isidor
Jacobs. They have decided that all reso
lutions mnst be in writing and will be re
ferred to the committee on resolutions
without debate. Speakers will be allowed
fifteen minutes on the platform and es
says must not take up over twenty
minutes each.
The programme of the congress as pre
pare! up to date is as follows:
Friday morningâ Congress called to order at
10 a. M. by James W. Kerr, president of the
Manulacturers' and Producers' Association;

Mr. Wheeler made the chain, and its

â  i
Though the Valley road has been in
operation to Fresno for only about seven
months, its business, both freight and
passengei. has increased within that pe
riod to such an extent as to require the
putting on of another steamer betwacn
this City and Stockton. Tne additional
boat win be tbe J. D. Peters. She will go
into service to-morrow and will make her
hrst trip frora Stockton.
For the past three weeks the Peters has
been laid up in the yards ot the California
Navigation and Improvement Company,
undergoing renovation in .every depart
ment. She has been entirely recarpeted,
tepainted and refitted, and her accommo
dations have b?en augmented by the ad
dition of forty new staterooms, which now
gives her 110 separata apartments, each
supplied with electric lights and running
water, In addition to the regular comforts
of a steamei of this class.
Up to the present time the T. C. Walker
and Mary Carratt have beon in the Valley
road service between San Francisco and.
Stockton, on*** or the other leaving this
City or StocKton each evening. The new
boat will increase the facilities of this ser
vice 50 per cent, and will enable all ship
ments to b-r forwarded in either direction
with the utmost promptness. Beginning
with to-morrow two boats will leave both
San Francisco and Stockton three days in
the week, and each day the wharf will be
entirely cleared ol all freight.
This addition to the service is the result
of a steady growth in the business of the
Valley road, and is not due to any sud- '
THE REFITTED J. D. PETERS. ,
den or unexpected movement of freight.
In view of the fact that the service has
been in a remarkable degree satisfactory
to the patrons of the road, it is expected
that the future increase of business will
shortly warrant the construction of a new
and swift passenger boat to run between
this City nnd Stockton. The utilization
of such a boat lias already been the sub
ject of consideration by the California
Navigation and Improvement Company,
and the gratifying growth of the business
that has developed in connection with the
Valley road will, in ail probability, hasten
the project of putting into service a fast
passenger boat.

Hurst had been acting queerly for some
time past, and his triends were a little
fearful that he would commit suicide. He
used to talk, however, about the- easiest
way of getting out of lire, wbich would be
not to mutilate the body in any way, but
to take poison, or if there was any objec
tion to that to jump into the water and
die a pleasant death.
He was a sculptor of more than ordinary
ability. For some reason or other, how
ever, he never seemed to make ranch
money and was always despondent.

IN AN ANACONDA'S CLUTCHES.
The Terrible IJ<->Kth uf an American
Sailor in the Island of Celebes.' "i,.: â ';.'!
On the 25:h of January, 1891, the sloop
Papua left Say pan, one of the Ladrones
islands, in the North Pacific, bound for
Sydney, with a load of copra or dried co
coanut. bhe was eighty-live tons, and had
a crew of five men, of all nationalities.
One was a Kanaka, the otters English,
Italian, Finlander and an American,
Charles Summy, while the captain, Held,
was a Swede
February 1 they were caught in a ty
phoon, lost their head sails and were
driven hundreds of miles off their course
to the eastward, and finally came in sight
of land, which they believed to be one of
tbe Philippines.
The sloop had struck on the north side
of â Tomani Bay, in the island of Celebes,
and about forty miles from Fort Amster-
I dam, a Dutch Government station the
coast. Tho natives were very civil and
agreed to pilot the. crew to that place.
The toad was a mere cattle track
I through woods so thick that a dog could
j scarcely make his way, and nothing was
j seen the first day but droves ol monkeys.
The beat was fearful and tbe attacks of
numberless insects kept them from sleep
i in-.*. They started by daybreak next
morning. About 10 o'clock they were
coming to an open place in the woods,
When suddenly the monkeys began a
demonstration. They howled and chat
tered, swinging from three to tree and
casting branches and nuts into the road.
The natives bung back, explaining that
there was a snake ahead and the monkeys
had detected : m and were giving warn
ing. After some hesitation the American
(Summy). a powerful, reckless fallow, de
clared that he Would go ahead, snake or
no snake. The guide advised him, but he
started and in a moment was lost to sight.
Suddenly a curious sound was heard â
almost like a blast of wind â and then a
fearful scream. "The snake has got him,"
said the native. 'Quick! Let's go away j
at once."
Captain Held was armed with a heavy
musket loaded with 'heavy shot, and he
rushed forward, one of the natives follow
ing. Twining the trunk of a huge tree
they saw an appalling sight. The own
space was about 100 yards square, of pure
white sand, flowing in the sun and bor
dered by the rich tropic vegetation. In
the center was the body of the wretched
American in thecoils of a monstrous snake
fifty feet long, and almost as thick as a
ship mast Sumray's hands and arms
weree free, but his body was fairly in the
black and yellow coils. The snake's bead
was waving from side to side before strik
ing. Although horror-stricken the captain
retained his grit, and, aiming for the bead
about seventy yards away, fired. With a
tremendous hiss and convulsive spring
the monsier uncoiled and entered tbe
thick brush, fold aiter fold being seen un
til it vanished.
For an hour they watched the body of
their shipmate until the monkeys began
to gather around it â a sign that the snake
was gone. They went forward, picked up
the body and brought it to the road. The
face was horribly distorted, and every
bone in the body broken by the crushing
coils. Although a large man. weighing
one hundred and seventy, the hips could
be spanned by two hands. Death must
have been instantaneous.
One for the Student.
"Sir," said a Heidelberg student to a
night watchman in the wee sma' hours of
the morning, "sir, I would like to ask you
a question.
"Go ahead, young man," answered the
dignitary, "that is. what I am here for."
"Well, sir, does the law permit me to
call a policeman an ass?"
"You had better be gone immediately
or I will lock you up."
The votary of alma mater advanced a
few steps on his way home, but returned
and asked humbly:
"Bur, sir, is it permitted to call an ass
a policeman?"
"The law doesn't say anything about"
that, young man."

rived here yesterday and is at the Occi
dental. She has come to address the
woman's congress which will open to
morrow and continue till May L Mrs.
Gardener came direct from her home in
Boston, with the exception of a short stop
in New York.
The eminent lady lived for a good while
in her early youth in St. Louis and Cin
cinnati, but she has never till now been
west of the Mississippi.
Some of the books which have widely
contributed to Miss Gardener's fame are
these: 'Is This Your Son, My Lord?"
"Pray You, Sir, Whose Daughter?'' "An
IK official Patriot," "Facts and Fiction of
Li:e," "Mtn. Women and Gods," "A
Thoughtless Yes."
Mrs. Gardener has studied both medi
cine and law .n order to be informed in
regard to certain scientific and legal work.
She is not, however, a graduate ot either
ame Ileal or law school. But she is evi
dently enormously better informed in re
gaid to both studies than many persons
who have practiced for year-*. She has
made a careful study of heredity and
several more of her novels treat heredity
in a most interesting yet thoroughly
scientific way. Dr. E. C. Spiizka, the
leading brain specialist of America, com
mends her work as highly scientific and
adds: "I had heretofore believed only
specialists capable of at once intelligently
and popularly dealing with these sub
jects."
"One of my lectures before the con
gress," * said Mrs. Gardener, "will be
'Heredity' and I presume the other will
be on the subject 'Sex in the Brain.' This
latter lecture, by the way, has been trans
lated in eight languages.
"VV bat else i may lecture on, if any,
has not yet been decided. I shall remain
(taring the congress, and probnblv con
siderably longer, >eeing meanwhile dif
ferent parts of California.
"I find the interest in the cause of
women growing steadily. Recently there
was a mothers' congress in Washington,
which was attended almost solely by so
ciety ladies. They wouldn't have thought
of attending a woman suffrage meeting,
but when they were through with tbat
they were willing to attend any kind of a
woman's congress. Mrs. General Bir.ney
was president and Mrs. Phoebe Hearst
was one of the vice-presidents."
Mrs. Gardener is a small, almost petite,
lady wilh very dark hair, dark eyes and a
pleasant, intellectual face.
ANTABOTIO EXPLOBATION.
The Leader or the Projected Belgian
Expedition Tell* About His Plana.
In an interview with an agency corre
spondent in Brussels, M. de Gerlache, the
Belgian naval lieutenant, who is the or
ganizer and leader of the projected Bel
gian Antarctic expedition, gave the fol
lowing particulars regarding his enter
prise:
"The expedition is to start from Ant
werp on or about July 15 next in the
steamer Belgica, which at present is lying
at Sands Fiord in Norway. The vessel will
have to undergo extensive alterations be
fore she enters on her voyage, especially
with a view to securine her against ice
pressure, and a laboratory is to be con
structed on the deck for the use of the
sc entitle members of the expedition." â¢-
In a recent visit to Copenhagen M. de
Gerlache met Commander Wandel, who
had just returned from an Arctic expedi
tion, in tbe course of which he explored
the regions lying between Jan Mayan
Island and Greenland and also Davis
Straus on the west of Greenland. This
expedition gave excellent results, its chief
aim having been the collection of zoologi
cal specimens.- Commander Wandel gave
him some very useful information regard
ing the Danish expedition.
"The Belgian expedition," Mr. Gerlache
continued, "is to be carried out on nearly
Â«- same lines as ,bat of Commander
Wandel. but it will have the further aim
of making meteorological and magnetic
observations. Our apparatus will be ab
solutely perfect and furnished with tbe
latest improvements. We shall use the
sounding line invented by the Prince
of Monaco. This sounding line, which
is worked by steam, will enable us
to take soundings at any depth.* ,It
will also be possible, to carry on fishing
operations at a depth varying between
3000 and 4000 meters by means of. th
'Sig-ibee' trawl. The steamer will also be
provided with drags and ..all the other
necessary appliances for making observa
tions. We shall make* a study of the
'Plankton'â that is, the animal 'life exist
ing in the upper layers of the seabed.
The first observations of the -Plankton'
were made by Professor Reussen.
"The organizers of the Belgian expedi
tion have had many difficulties to con
tend with. First of all, became Belgium
is not a maritime couniry; that is, it is
not so woll provided with nautical in
struments, etc., as other countries. These
instruments have been bought in various
placesâ in Copenhagen, Paris, etc. The
expeditions of other countries, moreover,
have had their Government's assistance.
"In the Danish expedition the Govern
| ment furnished . Commander Wandel
with both the vessel and the men. He
had only to choose, while for this expe
dition I had to obtain the necessary
funds by means of public subscriptionc.

EMBROIDERY AS A BUSINESS.
Made Far More Profitable by a Special
Art Training.
To an embroiderer a living must be more
than a bare existence. There are two
classes of embroiderers, the artistic and
the plain. As in all arts, there are the
rood and the poor, the exceptional
and the ordinary. There is the
work of the artist and the work
of those who are not artists. Work
done by ihe needle can be as high in art
as that by the brush. One must have
originality In colorings and designs to
carry embroidery to a higher standard
than is found in shops. Competition is as
sharp as in any other business. There is
the machine work and the product of the
girl who does it by the piece.
If one has an eye for artistic coloring, an
education in the grammar of ornament,
with perseverance, hard work and econ
omy sbe can earn a eood living. To do
this don't wait for people to come to you,
but go to them. If you have pretty oddi

Â»Â«â¦ S Me * 9 * man wh *> had spent thousands of dollars without finding relief until he
got the grandest of all remediesâ
THE ELEOTRO-MBDIOALi TREATMENT.
AS GOOD FOR WOMEN AS MEN.
The application of this treatment for all forms of rheumatism, including acute,
cnronic, sciatic, inflammatory and muscular, has met with amazing success. Cures
are enected in every instance. In *â¢ me cases the cures are little less than miraculous,
tor the treatment succeeded where every other remedy had failed. Of this electee
medical treatment it cm truly be said it is â¢ treatment that cures and a euro that
will last. ..
Under no circumstances should the Electro-Medical Cure be confounded with the
ordinary electric treatment as applied by comm**-* batteries or with such crude mag-
netic appliances as electric belts and the like. Tne Medical Cure is different
in J 1 menta * princi|>le, d.fferent in application ana different in effect. This com-
bined hilectro-Medicai treatment cannot be obtained at any other place than. at the
Institute, as it is their own original discovery. The equipment of the Institute is
superb, and includes thousands of dollars' worth of apparatus and instruments. Call
and inspect it The visit will cost yon nothing. *.

tant than your health. A little negiect now may cause you years of suffering. Address

ties not attainable in the stores or art
rooms in either commenced or finish- d
work and can obtain names of those mos.
likely to purchase embroideries in each
small city, -hen go to tbem. You can
nearly always make sales or take orders.
Owners of handsome homes are anxious
to add to their decorations all the pretty
aid suitable novelties.
If one has not the time or money to give
to a thorough education in ornament, let
her select two or three good books on the
subject and make a study of all classical
designs. I consider Anslev's "Outline of
Ornament" a good foundation stone;
Jones' "Grammar of Ornament" and
Herbert Dys' "Fantasies on Dec
oration" are all good; for if one
makes a success of any business she
must understand it from the beginning,
and when one is able to carry out in nee
dlework the classical designs called for by
architects and all good decorators she
finds si. is better able to fill orders and
carry out in embroidery portieres, piano
and table-covers, Turkish stools, chair and
cusnion-covers in correspondence with
wall and ceiling decorations.
To illustrate:. A Moorish music-room
calls for piano and chair cover* in Moor
ish colorings and designs; an Indian
library requires portieres, window-seat
cushions and table-covers, as well
as bookcase hangings in Indian de
signs. In .an old English dining
room the portieres, table-covers, the
leather-covered chairs, must all be em
broidered in old English renaissance. In
a colonial hall the most appropriate de
signs for portieres and cushions are fes
toons, firebrands and wreaths of that
peiiods and for a Louis XIV reception
room pretty, conventional fleur-de-lis in
its decorations. This suggests what can
be done in embroidery.â New York Inde

The Polar Bear's Sore Foot.
The polar bear on one side and the two
grizzlies on the other, of the line of bars
tiiat separate the bear pit in the Central
Par- menagerie into two compartments,
scrap a little now and then through the
burs. They can't reach through far
enough to do one another much damage,
and ihey don't fight very much, but a
while ago the polar bear had a piece
, nicKed out of one of his forefeet by a
grizzly's claw, and the wound made a sore
--pot, which needed to be healed. It would
have been possible to ia-so the bear and
so secure him that his paw could have
been bandaged: but he would have torn
the bandage off the moment he was re
leased and other means to cure him were
adopted.
A healing lotion was prepared and then
when the bear had been attracted to the
front of the pit, while one man led him
some food that he liked very much an
other applied the healine lotion to the
sore foot by means of a syringe, and the
application was repeated in this manner
as often as it was necessary until the
bear's foot was healed. â New York Sun.

'Wow â w â â w!"
One long shrill howl, followed by a
lusty chorus of "We gave them the ax;
â¢we gave them the ax, the ax, the ax!" and
a human avalanche of cardinal hurled
itself upon the platform, carried two
striplings around in triumph and nearly
shoot the arms off a very demure-appear
ing young lady. Bouquets enough came
hurtling through the air to ornament the
walls at a Bradley-Martin ball.
This is a very, faint and indistinct por
trayal of the scene that occurred at Metro
politan Temple last evening when the
aged Judge Searls advanced to the front
of the rostrum and announced that on ac
count of argument and style the judges
had awarded the fifth annual intercol
legiate debate between Leland Stan
ford Jr. University and the University of
California to Stanford.
But the Berkeleyites were forced to
content themselves with dismal groans of
"We're in the soup" and "Boom, ya! ya!
boom, ya! va!" Many of them, however,
crowded forward and added their con
gratulations to the victorious winners of

nia and the negative by Miss Londa L.
Stebbins, John M. Switzer and .__ B. Mor
gan of Stanford. "
Twenty minutes were allowed each
j speaker, and the affirmative ten minutes
in which to close.
President Martin Kellogg of Berkeley
acted as chairman of the evening; Hon.
Niles Sear!*. Colonel John P. Irish and
James H. Deering as judges. â¢ â 
The prizes contested for were the George
C. Perkins prize of $200, to be divided
among the members of the winning team,
and a cup, offered in 1894, to go to the
university first winning three debates.
This decision makes each university the
winner of" two debates, and next year
settles the question of supremacy.
The Temple was crowded almost to
suffocation, with the wearers of the blue
and gold occupying the gallery and the
car-linal-be decked ones on the right side
j of the lower floor.
At 8:20 p. M. the Berkeleyites fired the
j first cun by a volley of "Rah-rah-rahl U.
jC, Berkeleyâ Zip. boom, ah!" Stanford
J students came right back with "Rah-rah
j rah ! Rab-rab-rah! Rah-rah, Stanford!"
President Kellogg's instruction, or,
rather, request, as he introduced Charles
C. Cohn, the first on the affirmative side,
not to delay proceedings hy applause, was
little heeded, as both sides broke out con
secutively after each speaker had closed.
Debater Cohn said the measure under
discussion was not a new one, but had
C. C Cohn.
been favored by both Blame and Garfield
j and also by many Senators. He thought
i the present system of communication
! between the Cabinet and Congress cum-
I berÂ»ome in the extreme, and the efficiency
I of the spoken word is overlooked.
"This communication is now only by
J written report and too frequent." he a-
j serted. "The printine office is over-
I crowded and only a round-about
j after all. This is not a radical change,
nut only one of procedure."
Conn's eloquent and forcible remarks
were followed by those of Miss Londa L.
Stebbins of Stanford, a pleasing and
polished speaker, who took the negative
side. She admitted that it was not in the
intention of the reform that the danger
) existed, but in its practice.
She argued further that the proposed
j change is unconstitutional and would re-
I suit in a mongrel form of government,
I and that there is oral communication
: enough when the members of the Cabinet
j are calltd upon for information during
| committee meetings.
"The alleged remedy of the opposition
j â¢wonld only precipitate another evil," she
! said. "They think something must be
done, and wouid rush into danger with
out due consideration. To place the Cabi
net officers in Congress would only de
stroy that equilibrium so necessary to sta
ble government."
Adolph L. Weil replied for the affirma
tive. His remarks were terse and to the
point and delivered without any visible
effort.
â¢ "If we were advocating a system that
bordered on the anarchistic," he said, "or
even on the radical, there might be a rea
son for the arguments of our opponents.
But it is not it is only a method of pro
cedure.
"The privilege has beer, extended to
others and it might be here, they will ad
mit, except for the fact that a constitu
tional provision is said to stand in the
way. In other words tbey say that there
is a constitutional provision that no per
son holding any office under the Govern
ment of the United Stales shall at the
-ame time be a member of Congress. But
we deny that it will be soâ giving them a
seat there is not making them members
of that body by any means."
For his -ide Weil argued that to give
Cabinet officers a seat in Congress would
aid the executive, Congress and the coun
try at large. He said that as questions of
moment arose the Secretaries would be
there to elucidate many points necessary
'.o intelligent Voting.
"The bouses at large," be said, "have
now no method of receiving information
at hrst hand. It all comes' throueh com
mittees. But remember that we do not
try to do away with committees. The
lar est amount of work would still be
done by them. We would merely supple
ment them with a system that would give
Congress the opportunity of receiving the
benefit of the secretaries' information."
John M. Switzer followed for Stanford,
and made one of the best efforts of the
evening. He started off by stating that
only three Congressmen had ever de
fended this theory, and that very briefly;
that, in addition, it was never brought to
a vote.
"Neither can it be charged that Con
gress desires more information on which
to work," he continued. "Plenty o! in
formation is at hand in the reports of com
mittees, of bureaus, of the heads of de
partments and even of the secretaries
themselves. Why, if called upon for in
j formation the secretaries could no more
refuse to give it than they could if they
had a seat in Congress.
"There is just as much co-operation and
intercommunication between the execu
tive . and the legislative department ai
there is between the two houses. This
cannot be gainsaid by any unprejudiced
person.
"The President even now has so much
authority that he in reality forms a third
branch of the National Legislature. It re
quires beventy-tbree additional votes to
overthrow bis veto."
H. A. Overstreet came next ior Berke
ley. He made an excellent argument, and
was assisted by a full, melodious voice. .
"Our opponent*-," lie began, "have suc
ceeded in proving in most eloquent style
the wrongness of a system which we are
not advocating at all. They follow one
the other in regular procession. But I
hope that the last debater on the side of
our opponents will give up his time to
answering what we are advocating.
"Aa has been said before, we are not ad
vocatins any radical reform, but merely a
mode of procedure. If we believed tbat
we were on the side of a theory which in
practice would be detrimental "to the best
interests of the Nation we would not be
here."
The argument of the negative was
closed by A. B. Morgan, who made a clear
and forcible argument and showed him
self a master of satire and invective. His
exordium was devoted to laying great
stress upon the facts that the burden of
proof lay heavily on tbe affirmative and
tnat tbe question of expediency cut the
most important figure after all.
His side was not opposed to change, he
stated, but to this particular change.
Changes that were both necessary and
safe should be had by all means. i *â¢' J'y

Overstreet closed for the affirmative in
a humorou** strain, claiming that Stanford
had erected a man ot straw only to knock
him over. He believed none of the argu

didn't hesitate to say so.
At the first pandemonium reigned until

announced that the judges would retire

A buzz of conversation was then kept up

TESTING A WATOH.
English Timepieces ' Tried as to Their
Correctness and Regularity.
There has been watchmaking at Cov
entry as lone as there has been a watch
trade in England, which is for the last 200
years or thereabouts, says tbe Jewelers'
Review. There used to be three centers of
the English trade, these being Liver-pool,
Coventry and London ; now there are prac
tically but two, Coventry nnd Birming
ham. The test of a good watch is that it
should obtain a tvew certificate, and of the
watches that go to Kew 75 per cent are
from Coventry.
At Kew no watch has yet succeeded in
getting the 100 marks which signify per
fection, but Coventry has come nearest,
with ninety-two, and is always well to the
front. The Kew test is no light one. The
watch is listed in every position, and its
rate registered, not only per day, but per
hour; it is hung by us pendant, hung up
side down, bung on each side, placed dial
down and back down and at any number
of angles, and to finish up with is baked
in an oven and frozen in an ice pail. No
wonder that a watch with a Kew certifi
cate is a comfort to its owner.
When it is considered that it makes
18,000 vibrations an hour and must not
vary a second a week, while a quarter turn
of its two time screws, meaning a mil
lionth of an inch, will mane a difference
of twenty seconds a day. the delicacy of
its adjustment will be appreciated, as will
also tne risk of intrusting its repair to any
but skillful hands. ' ' fjj

Couldn't Beat
Exciting Contests for Six Hours
Witnessed by a Gay
Throng
The University of California yesterday
afternoon defeated Stanford University in
their fifth annual intercollegiate field day
by a score of 62 " _ to 49)_.

Among the collegians the final score
was generally unexpected. Both sides
bad figured on winning by a smaller mar
gin. To Stanford 'it was a sore disap
pointment. For the first time probably
in her history she had felt confident that
the result would be In favor of her ath
letes.- i">.3?i
: "Johnnie" Brunton, whose remarkable,
repeated and consistent performances of
late in the sprints had inspired the Stan
ford men with ihe greatest hope, was evi
dently not in his normal condition, and
was unab.e to do himself justice in any of
his three races.;
With the evidence of his unexplainable
! weakness early came to the Stanford sup-
J porters their first doubts of victory, but
I none of them had any 1< ss confidence in
I the ability of their sprinter.
Drum, the California freshman who won
J the 100-yard, the 2-0-yard and tbe 440-yard
i runs, defeating Brunton in each, was the
gr atest surprise of the day.
That Berkeley Drum could not be beat-*
en! He ran in excellent form. His per
! formance of 51 seconds in the taxing quar
] ter mile race proved that be is a possi
| bility to be feared by the best of his lim
ited class in this country. It is to be re
! gretted, however, if true, that dangerous
! stimulants were used to force this young
i athlete to his utmost speed.
There were other surprises that
amounted to reversals of general expecta
tions. In the hammer throw Stanford
j won all three places. Dorn of California.
as he did last year, after being credited
j in practice wonderful distances, fell
, as before, nearly thirty feet short of his
j reputed work and again got only fourth
â  place. I:i the mile walk California'-*, fast
! new man. Griffin, showed himself speedy,
but repeatedly throughout the whole dis
! tance used a very questionable hitch that
| employed finally upon the homestretch
I caused him to be disqualified, though he
I was first to breast tbe tape.
Adams, the little experienced but big
I and strong Stanford man, walked a re
i markably fair race and finished breast
| and breast, with his plucky and equally
j fair-walking rival, Westerfeldt of Califor-
I nia, who had lost a shoe in the first lap,
i i but kept evenly at his bard heel-pounding
stride for five laps more. v ;.
The ball-mile race wasanother surprise.
Burnett of Stanford was practically con
j ceded t- c first place; but Carroll of Cali
i lornia. coming up out of a large field dur
ing. the latter half of the distance, forged
steadily and strongly to the 'ront, just
! beating Burnett and establishing a new
j coast and intercollegiate record of 2 min
utes fiat. ~. -"*..;â  {;?â ', 'â â -.'â jy.
It was an ideal day for record-break
in*; â warm and without a breath of wind.
But the track was, unfortunately, as
bard as a macadam road. Two other in
tercollegiate records were improved upon.
Morgan of Stanord, though not equating
his previous pertormances or the coast
record, clipped a small fraction, off . the
intercollegiate time f r the 120-yard
hurdle race. Dole, Stanford's captain
j and all-round athlete, established a new
' intercollegiate mark for the pole vault, an
j inch lower, however, than his own coast
record. To Dole Stanford owes much for
his work yesterday. . .-... *: '.- ;.
He won three first places and would, it
was thought, have secured a place in the
running broad jump had the California
men in printing the programme not
omitted his name from the regular entries
for the even , and then ungallantly in
sisted that he be not allowed to c>>in*.<et- > ,
though Edgren, their hammer-thrower,
without having his name anywhere on the
programme last year was admitted by
Stanford.
Perhaps 2990 persons witnessed the field
day. It was typical college crowd and a
picturesque one, "the lon- shaded. grand
stand at the Olympic grounds being filled
| with prettily gowned young women and
j their escorts. ........
California's victorious team will not go
East. Neither will Stanford's team un
less and only as originally intended it go
to Chicago to com pate In the Western
intercollegiate meet. It could not go far
East as was supposed because some of its
best men â Morgan, Burnett and Ker
riganâhave not been in college long
enough to qualify according to the East
ern rules. 7' ! " ; "" .'".'. '*'

Big "Lodging-House Bein. Built in New
York by D. O. Mills.
D. 0. Mills has decided to give this city
the best system of lodging-houses for men
in the world. Two are now bein-.' built.
Mr. Mills believes that if lodging-houses
were clean and supplied with comfortable
reading-rooms, writing tables, games and
music, tocether witb ample bathing and
laundry facilities, lodgers would have a
better chance of securing work. Self
respect would be created and the moral
standard elevated. In pursuance of this
idea be is now building on Uleecker street
a hotel wbich will accommodate 1500 men.
Another, half as large, is being put up on
Rivington street. These buildings are to
be ten stories high and architecturally
beautiful. 'v.
The Bleecker-street house will belike
two buildings, each 100 feet square, with
an interior court forty-five feet square, the
buildings being joined at the center by a
tower containing the staircases and eleva
tors. The two places will cost upward of
$1, 003, In these hotels, each lodger
will have a private room instead of sleep
ing in the great dormitories of the ordi
nary lodging-house. It is expected that
20 cents a night will be charged lor the
rooms, with bath, laundries, etc., free of
charge to guests. These hotels will not
cater to the "tramp" element, but will be
for sober, industrious men who need such
a home. It is said to be Mr. Mills' inten
tion to develop .his system until the me
tropolis is fully. supplied with model lodg
ins-houses. What's the matter with Pitts
burg adopting the same idea?â New York

A. Heavy Insurance.
The Bishop of Peterborough met at din
ner a rich, ! benevolent, I but somewhat
brainless millionaire, who boasted that he
gave away Â£2000 to the poor regularly
every year. He said :
"I think it's right, you knowâ a sort of
duty in my position. I can't say what be
comes of it, but it's given away in charity,
that's all I know, and that's all I cure for
Â£2000 every year."
"'What!" said th& Bishop, "do you
really mean to say that you pay away
Â£2000 to the poor as a religious duty?"
"I assure you, my Lord, that it is so."
"Well,'* said the witty Bishop, "that's
tbe largest insurance against fire 1 ever
heard of."â Tit Bits.

It is a significant fact that the sales are being
made to practical farmers and fruit-growers who
know the producing qualifies of the soil, and are
also aware of the fa t that nowhere else In tbe
whole state of California can such bargains be he-
cured. Tne WolftKlU Grant is th" cho cest piece
of real estate in California, It is charmingly
located on the banks of Pitah Creek, wnere
It is sheltered from the oold trade- winds
wh eh sweep across the lower plains in
summer, and with a warm, eqttab.e climate
crops mature quite as early as in the justly famous
Vaca and l'.eaaant valleya The rich, alluvial soil
Is deep and inexhaustible. It will grow everything
cnown to the vegetable kingdom with but ordi-
nary care ln cultivation. Semi-tropical fruits grow
readiiy, and the staple varieties, such as peaches,
apricots, pears, etc., reach a higher state of devel-
opment here than in any pari of the state. Al-
though the growth it enormous, there is no sacri-
fice in flavor, aa the fruit from this place has at-
tained its celebrity through Â»Us quail y. Intending
purchasers have only to go through the various or-
. bards and gardens on the plare to real the
truth of iur claim. HesiU s Uie staples, sjch r.s
peaches, apr cots, prunes, almonds and grapes.
there are to b- found here In profusion olives, or-
anges, En. listi walnuts, lemons, strawberries,
raspbtrriea etc. These are no: grown under glass
or tor ornament, but make paying rops.

HIS WIFE'S DEATH
BeDJamin Hill Hears His'
Fate With His Usual
Calmness.
No Justification Found by the
Supreme Court for the
Tragedy.
In a Few Days He Will Ec Taken
Into Ccurt and Sentenced to
Death
Oakland Office Sas Fbancisco Call,)
â  90S Broadway, April 24. .' .*..'!
When Ben Hill, who"sbot his wife over
a year ago. was informed of the decision of
the Supreme Court affirming the sentence
of death passed upon him six months ago,
.it had no more effect upon him than if
Jailor Whitehead had Jmerely said "good
morning."
Since his conviction Hill has been.. a
most interesting person. He is unlike any
other murderer who was ever in tlie Ala
meda County Jail. He has been the boon
companion of C. R. Bennett, who was
once secretary of the Society for the Sup
pression of Vice, and the two men have
conducted themselves in a manner that
leaves the impression that they are both
earnest Christians or caoable actors. Tbe
opinion of those at tne jail is tbat in their
professions of religion they are sincere.
After his conviction it was not Hill's
wish that any appeal to the Supreme
Court should be made. He calmly stated
that he preferred death to areprieve. This
calmness has been displayed since the
very minute t at he gave himself up to
Superintendent Rudolph' of the Twelfth- |
â -.ireet road immediately after the thoot
i .-.
Twenty minutes after the deed was done
Hill was* in a tank at tne City Prison
readin.* a novel, and when spoken to he
calmly replied that he had done the shoot
ing and tnat he was prepared to pay the
penalty, but he expressed a inn belief
that after hearing the tes'iraony no jury
would convict him. His hopes were
groundless, however, for although a good
deal of testimony was introduced to try
to pull down his wife's character it failed
to have any effect with the jury.
The circumstances leading up to the
murder are very clear. Six months be
fore Killing his wife Hill want north.
Without any warning he returned and
called on his wife. He then went lo San
Francisco an i came back in the evening,
called for his wife and they walked together
just one block. Hill then placed his gun
so close to his wife's head thut some of
her hair was found in the trigger and shot
three time*. The evidence tended to show
that two of the shots were fired after the
woman fell. For his defense he said that
during that walk of a block bis wife told
him of things that had transpired which
rendered him momentarily insane and he
at once killed ber.
Two minutes afterward, as rational as
any human being eve -- * was, he walked
toward the carhouse and gave himself up.
Mainly through the instrumentality of
the Salvation Army, who held regular
meetings at the ja 1, Hi'! asserts that he *
is a converted man and quite ready to die. i
He is as impassionate and calm as a j

Alameda Com plaining of the Perennial

ALAMEDA, Cai.., April 24 âOnce again
the city authorities will Lave to take up
the matter of the nuisance created pri
marily by the tanneries and the cotton
mills in East Oakland dumping refuse
matter into the estuary. . This is driven
by wind and tide into the tidal canal, but
as the flow of the tide is not sufficient to
slough the pocket-like canal the result at
low tide is to ; pollute the water and kill
the fish, the combined effect being to cre
ate a stench, which is something unbear
able and a menace to public health. Dur

PARDEE WILL
CONTEST ENDS
Both Sides Agree to Hide

tons.
The Widow Gains a Few Strong
Points by the Com
promise.
Dr. George Pardee Ceased Fighting
Out of Resp ct to His Father's
Memory. -
Oakland Office Sam Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, April 24. j
The Pardee will contest will not be tried
in court. It has been compromised, and,
Members of the Pardee Family, Which Has Just Settled Its Differences Out of Court.
! judging by the terms ef the agreement,
eacn side has made some concessions.
Since the contest was hied many depo
sitions have been taken and it was m ide
evident tbat the case was to ba bitterly
fought. At each stage of the litigation
new material has been found and has been
replied to by something equally as bit
ter on the other side, and there seemed to
be a tacit understanding that no quarter
was to be shown.
Friend** of both sides tried to prevent en
open conflict that wonld of course end in
some disposal of the estate of the late Dr.
E. H. Pardee, but not until much had
been said and brought forward that must
be regretted by the widow and the son
and which might not add to the respect
shown to the memory ol the dead. The
doctor was a prominent Mason and a man
who stood well socially, politically and
professionally. He figured prominently
in official life in this city, and was one of
the most valuable Mayors Oakland ever
had.
Daring the latter years of his life occa
sional whispers that all was not as serene
as it might be in the Pardee household
were heard, but no attention was paid to
them, and after his death h s many friends
and relatives were anxious that none of
tbe carefully concealed skeletons should
be unmasked and brought into the light
of public criticism and possibly derision.
This agreement was faithfully kept for a
few weeks, wbeu every body concerned was
surprised to ie â¢ a lengthy section of Mr-.
Pardee's deposition published, and from ;
that time on for several days the unpleas- }
ant inside history ol the doctor's fami j
has been mercilessly laid bare.
As the number of tbe depositions in- i
creased so did the attorneys' engaged in :
the case, until when to-day's compromise j
was reached Dr. G. C. Pardee was repre- â¢
sented by Attorneys Mastick and Mastick
and A. A. Moore. The widow weÂ« repre- â 
sented by Van R. Pater-on, W. W. Foote,
George Reed and Emil Xusbaumer. .
In view of all the circumstances, it is '
certainly a victory for the widow, who !
now gets more than one-third of the j
whole e-tate of her late husban. i, after j
bringing a contest against the will which â 
declared that to do 30 would be eaulva
lent to forfeiting all rig is.
ln ber contest, Mrs. Pardee, the widow,
declared that a' the time of mating bis
will Dr. E. H. Pardee was so completely
under the influence of opiates and his son,
Dr. G. C. Pardee, that he was not cos:
nizant of the disposition he was making
of his property. He left property to the
widow which he valued at $75,000, and it
is noted as remarkable that thi*j' is the
only valuation of property, named in the
whole of the will. Its present value is
said to be $60,000. To his daughter, Nel- '
lie, be left two pieces ; â Â»! -property wbich i
she was to obtain possession of when she j
was 23 years of age
She died a few months after her father, i
and by a clause in -the will which pro- '
vided that should either the widow or I
daughter die before the distribution of the '
estate by an order of the court the
daughter's property went to her half
broiber George. As matters now stand
under the will George Is entitled to about
$".'50,000 and the wi low to about $55,000.
it is evident that Dr. Pardee ii i.e. pa tea
a contest, for in another clause of Â» i.c will
it is stated that if any of the beneficiaries
shall make a contest they shall forfeit ail
claim of any nature to the estate. '
There is' also another clause which '
shows that a contest was expected. The
decedent provided that any doctor, attor
ney or any professional man who had had
dealings with bim during his life should
not b? subj-ct to the statute relating to
profe-Kionalcnnfidenre, but should be at
liberty to tell everything they knew with
out restraint.
Dr. Geor.e Pardee might have won the
contest, because the lawyers for Doth sides
were unanimous in declaring that the will
was a most perfect lepal document and
that nothing but a ruling from the [Su- I
preme Court on points on which tney
have never yet ruled could set aside its
terra? and disinherit the doctor.
For th reason 'he compromise will be
a disappointment all over tbe State to
tho*-e who were anxious to get Supreme
Court opinions on the disinheritance
clause. By the terms of the compromise
the widow receives the Areata House.all
the personal property left to her and to
her uau hter Nellie under the terms of
! the will and $35. in casb. These jointly
are worth about $115,000 and **s the whole
estate is said lobe worth $275,000 Mrs.
Pardee. baa certainly reason to becon
gratulatPd.
Accordinc to the value placed on tha
Areata House by the decedent, viz.:
$75,000, Mrs. Pardee's share will amount
to $120,000.
Not. .ing but respect for the memory of
his father could have induced Dr. George
C. Pardee to consent to a compromise.
He is a known tighter and never quits,
and the fact that he has done so in this '
instance, while it may be a di-apprint
ment to some courtroom loafers, will be
veiy acceptable news to the . hosts of the
I friends of the late doctor. .
PRAYING FOR SPRINKLERS

â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Apiil 24. \
Oakland broiled to-day, and although
the surface of the streets was whisked
about in the air by a stiff breeze, not a
sprinkling cart was in evidence. .*_.
The sun commenced to beat down even
before its usual hour, and the discomfort
was not decreased when it was learned
that .the farmers and orchardists were
fearful that the wheat and fruit blossoms
would suffer from the heat.
The most ardent enthusiast of a dollar-
I tax limit wan quiet to-day, and, according
;to the merchants, the cost of street
i sprinklers was more than lost by the 'â 
â  damage done to tie goods in the stores by !
the clouds of dust that were blown in.
The hot spell has proved at least one !
I thing. The charges - made against the I
I Stieet Department a few montns ago by
| the -advocates of a $1 tax levy were not i
j e.' , -|gpQHBBWB
It was frequently stated that $1 tax was â 
sufficient to run the city and to pay all ex- !
penses, and that the ' watering-carts were j
; kept off the streets solely for the purpose
jof proving the fallacy of Mayor .vie's i
i<l_as, but this is not the case. The Street
Superintendent bad the supreme dissatis
facti* n to-day of seeing the watering-carts
warping in the hot sun. without being able
to send them on the street, unless he paid
for them out o his own pocket.

For many years much of the local ora
tory of John P. Irish has been delivered
from the text, ' First make clean your
gateway then garnish your house." He
bas made this remark hundreds of times,
and it has reference to the fact that it
would be absurd to talk about beautifying
the city of Oakland so long as every over
land traveler who lands at the Sixteenth
street deoot, the only gateway to the city,
must needs be hauled over half a mile of
miasmic marsh before reaching the city.
A large flagpole has been donated to
the city for adorning the park that will
soon take the place of tbe marsh, and
to-morrow it will be formally accepted by
Mayor Thomas.
Tbe West Oakland Improvement Club
should take ait the credit of bringing
Â»bout the doom of the marsh. George W.
Drake. William Walsh and Ferdinand
Kuemg, who constitute the committee of
the club in charge of the presentation,
will hoist a handsome flag, and for the
first lime the stars and stripes will float
over tbe noisome district alongside the
depot.
Mayor Thomas will accept the gift on
behalf of the city and George Carleton,
the city electrician, will attend to the
musical part of the programme. Many
members of the City Council will be
F resent, and it is expected that John P.
rish will make a speech', in wbich he will
refer in pointed language to the emanci
pation of West Oakland from its worst
enemy.
Should to-morrow be so hot as to-day
the marsh will present . its mo-t objec
tionable feature to tbe large assemblage
that will certainly gather at the bead of
Campbell street. This, however, will be
no inconvenience or no cause for regret,
but will only serve to enhance the value
of th improvements in the eyes of the
public. â  - â¢ â

"No Appointment* Made.
OAKLAND, Cal., April -24. â Mayor i
Thomas to-day denied that be had ap
pointed physicians to fill the vacancies
upon the Board of Health. Nor would he
commit himself as to whether he would i
appoint allopaths or homeopaths when :
the time comes.
The late unpleasantness in regard to the
practice at Fabiola Hospital has served to j
intensify the fight for the control of the j
board. Two homeopaths hold over, and j
with one new member they can control
the appointment of the Health Officer.

EAILEOAD BOOKKEEPING.
A Cam In "Which Two Cents Had to Be
Divided Into Eighteen Etjnal Parts.
Few persons outside of the offices of the |
great corporations know anything of the
care and minuteness with which the j
systems of accounts keep track of I
! every detail of operation. The character
of these accounts was illustrated the
I other day by an anecdote told by an :
ex-division superintendent of the Perm- |
sylvania Railroad regarding an item of 2 t
cents. Some one had told of an outlay of
something like $100 in clerk hire and other 1
expenses made by the United States Gov
ernment in collecting and accounting for
a sum of 1 cent, which had to be covered
into the treasury in order to mate.a clean ;
balance sheet. Then the railroad -man '
spoke up.
"I had an experience somewhat simi- '
lar," he said, "when I was clerk of the
shops on the division where I was after
ward in charge. "We were about naif way j
from Philadelphia to Pittsburg, and we 'â 
nad to have a whisky jack sent from Har
risburg to our chops. At the rates of
freight which the railroad charged itself
for material transported I figured that we
owed the main line 2 cents upon that !
whisky â¢ jack and sent in a report '.
which made it possible for the other ;
division to collect that amount from ours, j
Tbat amount had to be entered in a num- :
ber of books beyond our**, but in ours it !
became a matter upon which some very .
intricate figuring had to be done. E7Â«ry
general item of shop expense bad to be
apportioned to eighteen different ac
counts in accordance with a system of
percentages which nad been adopted, and
no two accounts were of the same value.
Therefore, when I paid out that 2 cents I
had to divide it up into eighteen unequal
parts and charge it up tr* the eighteen dif
ferent accounts." â New Y.>rg Sun.

A- DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW
BUILDING.
The Main Hat Wi 1 Be the Second
Largest of the Kind in the
State.
Under the fierce rays of old Sol, who
did bis very best to scrape a ciose ac
quaintanceship with everybody present,
with a large, orderly, crowd of people
standing by in respectful silence, and all
points of vantage in the vicinity taken up
by sightseers, the cornerstone of the new
Masonic Temple on , Mission street, be
tween Twenty-second nnd Twenty-third,
was laid yesterday afiernoon in accord
ance with tne beautiful ami solemn ritual
of the Masonic brotherhood.
It was ared letter day for Mission Lodge
No. 169, F. and A. M. It meant to the
members the beginning of a building that
will be not only an ornament to the City,
an edifice in which they may well be proud
to hoid lodge session*, but a monument
to their labors of the past.
Proceedings began with the formal open
ing of the grand lodge, F. and A. M-, of
California in the present rooms of Missiot.
Lodge, Sixteenth and Valencia streets. A
procession was then formed, including
California Commnndery and Golden Gate
Commandery, Knights Templar. Mission
Lodge, F. and A. M., and unofficial dele
gations from the various Masonic lodges,
chapters, councils, commanderies and the
consistory, all actinic as escort to the
grand lod^e. A uniformed band headed
the procession, and as it passed in stately
march along Valencia street to Nine
teenth, along Nineteenth to Mission and
thence to the site of the ceremonies the
streets were lined with spectators and en
livened by the unusual scene.
The list of officers of the Mission Lodge
is as follows:
Andrew Christenson, W. M.; William H.
Cobb, 8. W.; Fred 11. Gibson, J. W. ; George D.
Flack, treasurer; Charles D. Hunker, secretary ;
Charles A. Day, 6. D. : Charles W. Sturges.J.
D.; Charles F. Llbby, mar**nnl; Charts E.

sonic Hall Association are:
President, Harvey C. Somers: vice-president,
James }'. Hodgdon; treasurer, George I).
Flack; secretary, Henry C. Bunker; directors-
James W. Keyston and Andrew Christenson.
The cornerstone was laid by Grand Mas
ter William T. Lucas of the Grand Lodge
of California, assisted by the oilier grand
officers included in the ritual. All ttie grand
officers, however, were present, as follows:
William T. Lucas, Q. M. : Thomas Flint Jr..

The ceremonies were opened with a
prayer by the crand chaplain. When the
time arrived for Harvey C. Somers. presi
dent of the Mission Lodge Masonic Hall
Association to deliver the silver trowel to
Grand Master Lucas, he did so with the
lollowing brief speech:
Most Worshipful Grand Master of the Grand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Califor
nia. Brethern and friends:
We, of Mission bodge, have for a long time
contemplated building us a Masonic home
and nave finally selected this spot. We will
erect this building not only for ourselves, but
for the generations to come after us. We have
laid the foundation good and strong, and it is
now necessary that the cornerstone be well
and truly laid.
â¢ Most Worshipful Grand Masterâ behalf of
Mission Lodge No. 169, F. and A. M., I now
invite you to lay this cornerstone for us in

treated specially for sick headaches, dys-

to be a liver or kidney affection or heart-
disease, when in reality the whole trouble
is with the reproductive organs. This
delicate and intricate organism and the '

of the trouble from the inside: It is not
merely temporary, external, local, bol-

directly tones and strengthens the in-

and regularity, and completely banishes

The cornerstone was then laid by Grand

In the copper box deposited beneath the
stone were the constitution anu by-laws of i
Mission Lodge, together with a list of j
members and a historical sketch of the â¢
lodge; other records relating to the Grand !
Lodge, Grand Council, Grand Chapter and ]

The ceremonies proper were followed by j
an eloquent and learned oration by Grand J
Orator Cobb. After complimenting Mis- j
sion Lodge upon the progress it had. made '
and the acquisition of its new building, he j
said: '". _ J
A very distinguished and scholarly man In
this community recent:;." made the public :
statement that there is no excuse to-day ior
the existence of such an organization as the
Masonic fraternity. In view ol this public;
statement I deem it proper on an occasion i
like tbis to briefly state the otjectsof free
masonry and the reason why ire devote our '
time and means in promoting its welfare. * **
To, increase knowledge, to promote virtue,
to learn to subdue the passions, act upon the ;
square, keep a tongue of grod report, main- i
lain secrecy and piactice cnarity â this is ti.e !
mission of free masonry to-day. And a candi- j
date should be raised mentally and morally I
as well as physically to the sublime degree of I
master mason.
We are banded together to assist each other I
iv building broad, manly, religious charac- ,
ters, and ii we are not doing this then our I
critic was right and there is no excuse for our '
existence as an institution in this day and age
oi the world. A lodge cannot be measured by
the perfection oi its work under' the ritual;
nor by the number of its candidates; nor the ]
frequency and attendance oi its meetings;
nor by its wealth, its temple or its ,
charity; but. its true and final measure is
by the characters it builds. Emerson
says: "Very few of our race can be said to '
be as yet finished men. We still carry
sticking to us some remains of the preceding j
quadruped organization.* If love wiih tears ;
and joy; if want with his scourge; If Chris- j
tianity with its charity; if trade with its"
money; if art with its portfolios; if science
with its telegraphs, through the deeps of
space and time can set man's dull nerves
throbbing and with loud' taps on the tough I
chrysalis can break its walls and let the new
creature emerge tree; and free, make .May and
sing a paean, th" age of the quadruped is to go
out, the age of the brain anu of the heart is to
come in. Man's culture can -spare nothing, I
needs ail materials."
Brethren, to-d y we dedicate this temple to
Almighty God and lay its cornerstone, hut
every day ,we . are laying cornerstones of
i grander temples than any of which King Sol
j omon ever dreamed; and we toil amidst the
| dust and rubbish of human environment
I waiting for the goddess and the Shrine. Noth-
I ing shall drive irom mc the belief that there
is arising here iv America a type of Masonry
new to history, from which shall proceed in
ages yet to come an influence more lender, a
majesty more pure and grand than any which
the ancient-craft ever knew. Through tears
and smiles, through the joys and sorrows
i which have united hearts in all agesâ through
the exercise of rights never before conceded,
:of duties never before imposedâ tne spirit of
; truth is evolving the truly Masonic character
of periect manliness. V* â¢' ' '
Tne ceremonies were concluded with
the singing of the old, familiar hymn,
"Praise God, From Whom Ail Blessings
Fiow," and . tbe benediction, by Grand
Chaplain Church. . In regular order tbe
various bodies then marched back to Mis
sion Lodge Hall, corner of Sixteenth- and
Valencia streets, and disbanded.
"When completed the new building will !
be a handsome structure of pressed brick, j
terra cotta and steel, two stories in height. !
An extensive basement is to be con- j
structed for the use of stores, and heating I
and ventilating apparatus, which consists
of a furnac*, a large ventilating fan and
an electric motor. â¢
The first story will contain two elegant
stores, swith plate glass windows and
mosaic tiled, entrances.
Above will be the large hall, 42:6 by 63

tary's office, and one smaller hall- and

BRINGING LIGHT
FROM THE ORIENT
A Brahmin Teacher Has a
Message for the West
crn World.
Brahmacharin Eodabhiskshu
Says All Great Teach
ers Aere\
Th osophy, Hi Says, I? the Inner
Truth Found in All
Religions.
. *
Brahmacharin Bodabhiskshu has
brought to America a message of uni
versal Brahminism. Tlie pos-essor of
this elongated name is not tbe formidable
personage bis signature might suggest,
neither is be to be pitied on account of
his unwieldy cognomen, for he adopted it
hi me If.
Bodabhiskshu is a member of an order
of ascetics known as the Brahmacharin
order. The designation of the order
means literally "one who moves in the
supreme." The other part of bis name be
aaoDted according to the custom of the
order, and its meaning is "mendicant for
truth."
Tbis order has two classes, one of which
practice's celibacy, and to this class be
longs Bodabhiskshu. 'He is a high-caste
Brahmin, and his* conversation exhibits
education and culture.
"1 am not identified with any society in
the sense in which membership is under
stood in the Western world," he said last
night, "and I am not here as a mission
ary. I have traveled acro-s the continent
at the invitation of my theosophical
friends in this country representing
Brahministic teaching in its universal
aspects. Theosophy is ihe inner teaching
of the Brahmins, the Buddists and the
Christians also. There is no quarrel. The
teachings of Brahma are in no way at
variance wilh the teachings of Christ or
other great teachers.
"From one standpoint I may say I am
working for theosophy. 'From' another I
may be considered as presenting the views
of the Brahmins.''
The lecturer's immediate mis-ion in this
City is to .lecture before the Woman's
Congress, at whose invitation he came to
the coast. ' He also expects to deliver
several other lectures, the first of which
will be at >iative Sons' Hall this evening.
His subject will be "Religion as a
Science." *.. .. . -; *â â¢"â¢ i
KANGAROOS FELL DOWN.
Ball Tossers From Australia
Succumb to the
Reliance.
Numerous Lar^i and Lusty Hits
R suit in the Score B ing Ridic
ulously Swelled. j
' : Aja: i
The rumor has gone abroad that the
young men from the land of the festive j
kangaroo cannot play ball enough so you
would notice it. For six innings of the
game between the Australian and Re
liance teams yesterday it looked as if the
cricket graduates would very effectually
nail that rumor. It is not smooth, clean
ba-eball this presumptuous nine plays,
but it is bard, earnest and always steady.
For three innings Kemp, the Australian
south paw, managed to hold the Oakland
men down to a few scattering hits, and in
three innings only three runs- were se
curedâfairly gooa, ball, as the game has
been played here of late. ; Then .Over was
for some reason substituted and. in the
language of the cuibstoue, they "didn't
do a thing to him." Mclntyre started the
damage with a home-run hit when fro
men were on bases. Krug followed with
! a lift over the left-field fence, and then
balls were slammed against the fences
with a regularity that would have dis
heartened a less stolid aggregation. At
the end of the inning the bell rang ten
times.
The* Australians did a little batting in
the sixth and made eight runs. From
that time on ttie runs were added with a
rauidity that made the scorer's arm ache.
The fin_l score wss 18 to 23, the Reliance
having the best of it and a spare inning.
The Australians did some pretty play
ing, the long throws of Stnckey at center
and the work of Over while playing short
beinc particularly noticeable.

j r
When the Woman's Congress is called
: to oider to-morrow morning it will not be
|in the First Congregational Church.
| This decision was reached at a special
: meeting of the executive board, which was
held at the residence of Mrs. Lovell
| White, 161G Clay street, yesterday after
noon. - - . â 
| The place selected at this eleventh hour ;
| for the congress was Golden Gale Hall.
This, the ladies say, is an eminently satis
factory place in wnich to conduct such a
1 convention, but, nevertheless, there are
circumstances attending the change of
plans with which they are far from satis
fied. -yj-VJ
It is more than three months since the
ladies of the executive board secured per
mission to use the First Congregational
Church edifice for the congress and until
adayoi two ago it was presumed that
everything was lovely. The snag ap
peared when the ladies began making
preparations for a platform, which they
deemed necessary for the conduct of their
meetings. To this Dr. Adams, the pastor,
most strenuously objected. He exolained
that they might have the church, but be
would not consent, to any alterations
which would interfere with the regular
services.
The ladies insisted that the platform
could easily be removed Saturday night
and replaced Monday morning, but the
doctor expressed his incredulity of the
feasibility of this plan. â 
Mrs. Lovell White, who spoke for the
board, then asked Dr. Adams if he would
rather the convention -nd not meet there,
and the minister admitted that might be
the better plan. He declared that on the
occasion of a former convention the ladies
had jumped upon the pews, scratched tbe
furniture and otherwise proved undesir
able guests of the church.
That is why the ladies who are looking
out for preliminaries of the Woman's
Congress met yesterday aiternoon and
decided to enga-e Golden Gate Hall for
the convention. Members oi the board are
outspoken in ascrihing a motive to the
action of the minister in discouraging the
convention. They say it is the result of
tbe factional difference in the church,
many of the ladies of the convention
being supposed to be friendly with one
faction.
Dr. Adams does not personally take the
responsibility lor declining grant the
board's request, but declares it is the
action of the church committee. He re
fused to disclose to the ladies, however,
the names ot the committeemen.
GREEKS ARE IN ACCORD.
Cannot Praise Enough the Bishop of
the Greco-Roman Church. !
"The Hellenic Mutual Benevolent So
ciety has nothing whatever to do with
church matters," said President M. D.
Vanvales yesterday. "We never go to the I
services in a body, and while many of our
members did not attend last night's serv
ices for the reason given in The Call, still
many others did.
"It must be clearly understood â¢ that
every member of our society loves the
Bishop. He is a whole-souled Christian
gentleman and has done more* toward
binding up any differences that have j
arisen in the past in the church than any
other man sent here from Si. Petersburg.
Every one of those who remained away
from the services thinks moro of the
Bishop than of any man in the United
States, and their action was simply a pro
test against the position taken by the
Czar."
Mr. Vanvales is an ardent Greek, but he
wants it distinctly understood that there
is no dissatisfaction in the colony under
the beneficent rule of the present Bishop.
Burglars Sent to Jail.
Judge Webb of Fresno, sitting in Judge Car
roll Cook's department of the Superior Court,
yesterday sentenced Robert Smith to twenty
years in the State prison at FolEom for burg
lary. Thomas Low, convicted of burglary,
was consigned to the same prison lor fifteen
years. â¢-â¢â¢>/.

Sold by all druggists." May 1, 1897, will witness a series of the
oddest celebrations of 'lie day history
records. The bicycle, wbich has invaded
almost everything else, it* now scorching
toward Mayday. Instead of a circle of
young people holding garlanded ribbons,
one end of which is attached to the May
pole, we shall see bicyclists performing
the action, though, of course, they are
likely to bo young 'people, too. Hereto
fore, the participant? in the Mayday fes
tivity have danced about the pole in weav
ing fashion, thus twining the ribbons un
til the gay sections are united in a gorge
ous whole. This rime the bicyclists will
weave in and out, accomplishing a similar
result.
It is an entirely new idea. When first
suggested, many cyclists thought it Im
possible, but tor several weeks experi
ments have been quietly in progress here,
which demonstrated that the idea was
thorou practicable. It is necessary
for the young men and women who take
part in May-lay events of this sort to be
able to control a wheel with great ease. It
is the short turn with a bicycle that throws
the novice. 'Ihe Maypole riding is prac
tically a series of short turns and the ut
most skill is necessary toavoid collisions.
In winding the ribbons of a Maypole, as
the practice is called, it is necessary that
almost as much rhythm be preserved as
in the music of a dance. A false move by
a rider may tangle the whole combination
so thoroughly as to necessitate an entire
unwinding and thus a new beginning. It
ie oftentimes necessary for the rider to let
go of the handle bars entirely, and never
is it possible to keep more than one hand
upon them. To make the jjame interest
ing it is advisable lhat there should be
very little distance between ihe wheels of
the riders. This leing the case it can
easily be seen that the cyclist must not
lose control of the wheel for a moment.
Again, it is often necessary to reverse and
weave in a new direction. Hence one
almost needs eyes in the back of his head.
Anywhere from six to fifteen riders can
take part in this up-to-date Maypole gath
ering, according to the height of the pole
and the number of garlanded ribbons. It
is customary, at least so far as experi
ment hasdemonstrated, to have eight per
sons attempt the feat witn wneels. At
the start all move in the same direction.
The ribbons are allowed to, as the sailors
say, take three turns around the pole.
Then the process of weaving begins. Four
of the riders reverse front, and, while lit
tle or no progress is made in the change
of position, the ribbons become more and
more entwined. Then another change of
front is made, and four of the riders keep
their machines as near stationary as pos-
Bible, never losing hold for a moment of
the garlanded ribbons.
Then three turns more are taken around

MAYDAY AMID THE WILD FLOWERS
May day will witness the opening of the flower season. All nature seems glad in anticipation. Over the hills the warm
wind sings and sets ;he buds and grasses to dancing merrily. The sun fills the atmosphere with a quivering light that mingles
with the happy notes of hri-hl-plumaged choristers. 'Tis May day in California.
And what a day of joy it is! In no land in the world does nature show to better advantage at this time than she does
in the Golden State. From the snowy peaks of the high Sierras, where the tiny alpine flowers are just beginning to peep from
underthe ice crystals of last winter, to the shores of the Pacific, where sea birds scream, the great voice of nature is singing.
It is springtime.
Not the springtime of England nor of the East, when buds are just commencing to open, but a springtime fully devel
op* '.. when the wild flowers are at their best and the fruit trees are aglow with bloom. After the dreary winter just
passed May day comes, if anything, a little more brilliantly clothed than usual. The winter rains soaked the earth
deeply and the cool days of last month held back vegetation. Then came the warm days of April and tbe sunshine
sent the sap hurriedly tingling to the end of every twig. Almost as if by magic the hillsides burst into bloom, red,
yellow, blue, green, pink, purple and violetâ the colors of the spectrum and all the hues of science.
The plains of the San Jonquin Valley are literally ablaz? with color. On the wild lands the poppy reigns
in all her glory and on the cultivated lands the fruit tree rules the day. Wherever a house can be found
there are roses in profusion-*
The country within a few miles of San Francisco is, perhaps, the most beautiful in ail California. The
hills are more varied in their outlines and the forest depths are more picturesque than elsewhere.
There are certainly more birds.
Tbe soil of Marin County has been found to be the most prolific in the State for its growth of wild
flowers. On a single square yard on the hill just north of Mill Valley thirty-two different kinds have
been iound. Of course, they were not all of the gorgeousness of the poppy, but all were, beautiful.
May day is, of course, the beginning of the picnic season. There may be picnics before that
time, but there is always something lacking, even though the skies are biue and the fields green
and the forest echo with the songs of birds. It does not seem natural to have a picnic before
Mayday. When the April showers have brought forth the May flowers, oh, then is the time
for picnics. "^' >
Of course all who can will go to some sort of a picnic on Mayday. It may be to some
distant point with a trainload of others on the same errand bent. It may be only a small
party of three or four, or you may go alone with some lunch in your pocket. ' But it *
matters little how you go so long as you go. -.''< *
No city in all the world offers such opportunities for Mayday outings as San
Francisco. For a few cents you can board a boat or train and be carried to as beau
tiful spots as exist anywhere. A short walk from the station will take you into
the depths of nature, where there is nothing to suggest modern civilization.
There is no day like Mayday for the real lover of nature. And, after nil
bow the real lover of nature is to be envied ! Nature" is always willing to
give if you will only take. ' ** yy
The real nature-lover is an early riser on Mayday, and almost as soon
as the sun is up will be far on his,, way to the wilderness; over the hills
and through the valley, across the brook and through the forest, shade
and sunshine attending.
Perhaps he will wander to some unfrequented spot where no
human foot has trod for many months. Into the depths of some
canyon, where the only sound that breaks the stillness is the
murmur of waterfalls splashing over moss-covered stones. There
nature is in her glory. How soothing is the influence. How
beautiful the sunlight comes aslant through the rustling
branches of the giant redwoods. How comfortable and
happy every living thing within sight. See the wild flow
ers nod in that patch of light when a soft breeze pene
trates to the solitude. ; -^y-J.
As the sun gradually descends to the western
horizon, each moment seems to increase in beauty.
The shadows grow longer and longer and the
Ughts grow dimmer and dimmer, and in the dis
tance a soft purple haze comes, as if from fairy,
land. Lower passes tiie orb of day until the
distant bills are only a shadow and the west
ern sky is a blaze of light. Gradually . thi s
lades away and the day is done. But even
night has its glories. What mystery
there is in the shadowy clump of oaks
How dark and gloomy, and yet how'
soothing.
' Truly Mayday is a glorious day,
and he or she who spends it

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 25, 1897.
MAYDAY BESIDE FOREST STREAMS
There are different kinds of lovers of nature as there are different kinds of men in the varied walks of life. There is the
one who is content to roam over the hills or through the forest simply for the love of nature, and there is the one who to
enjoy nature must sit on a mossy bank watching a cork fastened to a fishing-line. Both will be given an opportunity to
enjoy Mayday, the latter particularly, because on that day the trout season really opens.
For the trout-fisher this year there are only a few new things in the way of tackle. No real innovations, however.
And, by the way, have there been any real improvements over the methods of the fisherman's saint, Izaak Walton?
The principal difference in this year's tackle compared to last year's is that everything that can be made of aluminum
can be obtained in that metal. The advantages of this are obvious to any sportsman. Tackle can be obtained cheaper *,
this year than last. There are a few improvements in reels, all of which are very high priced. Jointed poles are lighter
and prettier than ever. ,v : : ? J J J
Hooks and lines are of the same old style. There are a few new flies out, whicb, however, do not look
any more "tempting" than the old kinds and would have to be tried before their advantages can become known.
But judging by the amount of new tackle that has been sold during the past week Mayday will be a
bad one for the trout Hundreds of devoted anglers will leave here next Saturday morning and in a few hours
be scattered along the streams within a bundred miles of San Francisco.
Just where they will all go it is hard to say, but of course the old favorite fishing grounds in Marin,
Sonoma and Santa Cruz counties will come in for their share. There are a number of old anglers who'
have little "private" pools of their own stated out but as well ask them for one of their eyes as for
the location of the place. That is their secret
Of course the first day's fishing of the year is really the most enjoyableâ even though none of
the finny tribe are lured from their hiding places under the rocks.
A good fisherman gets on Mayday the advantages of the beauties of nature and the advant
ages, if any, of the excitement of the sport.
What pleasurable anticipation there is in the walk to the trout stream in the early morn
ing hours. A well-stocked lunch basket and a box of tackle are your only companions. Down /
the road under the tree 3to the path that leads to the fishing place. There were lots of fish /
there last year. i -VJ *'
What's that? Somebody else there. Well, no matter, there are other places. This
is a better place anyhow. Hear the water roaring over the rapids and the wind whis
tling through the redwoods. Inspiration enough for a work of art., How dark that pool '
looks. Surely there are several big teilowsin its depths.
-â¢â¢ Get out your tackle.- That bright red fly is a good one to begin with. If he will
rise to that he will rise to anything. Swish, r-r-r-r-r, and your first cast of the
season is made on Mayday. But what's the matter? The fly is getting water
soated. It has been offered with no takers. Try again. No better. Maybe there
are no trout in the hole. â¢ r * ; J: â  â  fyflM
, â  Try the yellow ana green fly. ; There, that's better. My ! but he is a big
fellow. How he makes the reel hum. Now he has stopped. Wind him in.
Slowly. Now he's off again.
Of course your first fish of the season makes a game fight Half
an hour slips by like a minute beiore you manage to get him beneath
the lid of your basket. But what a pleasurable half hour it was.
And such a successful one. The first is a beauty. Now for some
lunch. How good it tastes. Ah, if you could only have that appe
tite every day in the week. . |
And as the.day wears on, the sun rises higher and higher,
and it gets warmer and warmer. You; have a basketful of
fish and are healthily tired out. Now for a rest until train
time. And perhaps a smoke and a pull at theâ but that is
another story., Â . ]( ;^J J r ,y *V '
Perhaps as you lie half asleep, half awake, and you
surely knew this is the ideal repose, you may dream.
Most liKely you will dream of catching the largest
trout that ever was caught. You will in vision cast
your, fly and, after the gamest possible fight, land
the tish. Then â¢ you will wake up and feel for
your basket of beauties. They will be there and
you will be as happy as you ever were in your
life. If you are notâ well, there is no poetry
in you. * OI course, you may say. there was
never any poetry in you, which only goes
to show how little you know about it
The ride back to the City is a
long one. Much longer than the ride
to the fishing grounds. But you are
glad that you went, and on the
ferry-boat across the bay will
have the pleasure of compar
ing your catch with your
friend's. What joy it is if
you have made the larg
est catch of the day. J^y.

little hammer and a double-headed brass
tack, from which depends a tiny streamer.
With almost lighting-like rapidity the
cyclist pins the end of the ribbon to the
pole with the tack and a smart blow from
the hammer instantly following fastens
the end securely.
While at first thought this programme
may seem an almost impossible array of
effort experiment has proved that it is
entirely feasible. A prettier sight than a
May pole adorned in this fashion or a more
clever exhibition of cycling powers than
the riders give under these circumstances
would he difficult to conceive. Fashiona
ble persons who know say that the bicycle
Maypole party will surely.be a fad the
first of next month and that we may look
for a general turnout of the riders of vari
ous ages to take part in the festivities that
have latterly been left to the children.
Inasmuch as the pastime is to be a fash
ionable fad, the matter of costume at once
becomes an important item. It is declared
that it will be very t proper for the chil
dren, or the young men and women, or
their mothers 'and fathers if they choose
to take part, to attire themselves in cos
tumes of bright stuffs that will harmonize
with' the parlanded adornments of the
Maypole.*" There has been just one party,
and this was indoors and. for practice,
which has tried this sort of costuming.
The effect is declared to have been beyond
compare, and it- is said this incipient
pageant' was fully as charming to the eye
as the attractive features of the spectacu
lar performances at the theaters.
The advent of the bicycle into the May
day festivities is likely to cause a paitial
return to the customs of a â¢ century ago,
when all persons who were physically
able to do so took part 1 in the Maypole
dance. As a rule, the younger children,
to whom Mayday is a period of elysium,
will be compelled to forego the delights of
the bicycle feature, and in < this way it
will devolve upon that portion of the
cycling contingent which considers itself
sufficiently skillful to enter the lists, re
gardless oi age.
This calling the attention of the adults
to the celebration of the Ist of May prom
ises to make the observance of the day far
more general than in many years. â  It has
not been infrequent to invite the elders to
the juvenile parties, which took place on
the evening of May 1. This custom wi'l
be improved upon this year, for it has
been decided that the elders will form out
ing parties for a trip to the parks or some
suburb during the day, the evening to be
spent at the home of the host and hostess.
Thus, if there is not a Maypole dance in
the daytime, there surely will be a May
day hop in the evening, and so, in one
fashion or another, young and old will
dance in the fullness of their joy that the
springtime is really here.
All this is due to the bicycle. Thus the
wheel has not only given to many of us
health and strength, but it is bringing
about the return of one of the good old
customs that the older ones used to ob
serve so long ago as the days when Queen
Elizabeth smiled over her ruff at the
merrymakers, and bluff King Hal did not
disdain joining the dance around the
Maypole.

A DAY WITH
JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY
â¢ Milton, Milton the majestic, made the
devil roar in his stately and stilted meas
ures till "The hollow concave of all hell
resounded," but we have done with the
devil; we have done with hell, and we
have pretty nearly done with Milton.
Burns has more readers, ten to one, than
Milton, and Riley has more readers in hi-*
own land, at least, than Burns. Why?
Heart. That is the answer in one word,
â¢clean, pure, single, wholesome heart
Will we ever have an American litera
ture? Yes, we will have. We have it
already and Riley is at the head of it;
not at ail because of bis dialect, but in
spite of it. Yet his dialect is genuine,
true as that of Burns is true. The secret
of it ad is the heart that is in it. Go to
the heart, go crosslots, through the
orchard, over the fence, down the
lane, anyway or anyhow, only so
you get there. Go straight, quietly
and with as few brief, baby words
as you can use, right into the
heart. Make no noise, no show of your
self, or long learned words or high-sound
ing Miltonese measure, and you will stay
in the heart when you tet there, as Rilev
stays. This is to be the American litera
ture, as against English literature of the
Milton, Byron, Macaulay school of
"words, words, words," of ruins, wars,
devils, hells. The world is weary, wearied
unto death with these old deeds and
creeds in lurid and lordly and gorgeous
garmentings of sounding and resounding
: words, words, words and words.
. American science has swept aside space
and time; American science dashes on at
fifty, sixty miles an hour. American
literature, under the lead of our littera
teurs and learned men, born of hack cen
turies, still insists on lumbering along in
the old-fashioned English stagecoach at
.the old rate of ten miles an hour, and :
oftentimes with a red-coated outrider,
and he blowing a horn! And our trained
critics insist on sitting in judgment on
American literature with the old, cold,
musty and majestic Milton; and Macau
lays as the only law and gospel.
Meantime Riley is being more widely
and heartily read than all three of them
put together.
, Why is the world turning to pictures
and turning so entirely away from the
stately writers of England? Because it is
abreast with the times. It wants ideas,
not words, words, words! If a picture
goes to the heart, tells the story at a
glance, little matter how crude or rude,
the heart prefers a square of picture to a
column of words.
If Riley can stand you "knee deep in
June," with a dozen little bits of dialect
or sawed-off Saxon words, why he is sim
ply in line with the time; the new man
and the true man. the master of the new
American literature, a man with an idea.
Great is Lowell, Longfellow, Whittier,
Whitman, Holmes great, truly great,
and great poets all; but only great as the
going Engiish poets are great, if we ex
cept some work of the first-named poet.
A jewel that depends on its setting is a
poor jewel. Poetry that leans on stately i
words and war and rage and ruin is not â 
ali poetry. I have done many books, but
I have despised big words and have not
written a word of war either in hell or out
of hell. I would starve first. French
literature? War and intrigue, hate and
lust; and so, with scarce the exception,
she has not a line of poetry, simply be
Discovery of a New Indian Poet
A few years ago, while rambling about i
in the northwestern corner of Oudh, I !
came into possession of certain bundles j
of manuscript written by one Achmet
Fazl-ood-deen, Jemadarof Aligunj, one of I
the villages of Oudh, which nestles in a
clearing of the Teraiâ the great jungle
that skirts the foothills of the Himalayas. !
The MS., which was written in flowing ,
ACHMET, THE BARD.
Bhagist(the Urdu caligraphy used by men
of clerkly attainments), proved on exam
ination to be the journal of the said
Achmet, who began his career as a hum
ble-acolyte of the village mosque, the
Moolah of which taught him Urdu and
Persian and Arabic. He early developed
a faculty for writing verse, some three
score specimens of which are scattered
through the MS. in my possession, for he
j cause she has no heart. Germany? Heart
!to the core. And so it is that even her
; great, clumsy, lumbering language is
i often teeming to the lips with poetry.
My love of Riley, a discovery, strange
:or new? Bless you, Lowell was his Co
| lumbus, and years ago. And Holmes
| sailed into port right along after Lowell.
j Says Holmes:
'James Whitcomb Riley is nothing
i short of a born poet and a veritable genius.
! I think he is a later Hosea Big'ow, lite
as original as the latter and more versatile
lin certain respects. I own a good deal of
| enthusiasm for this latter product of In
diana soil, this delineator of lowly hu
manity who sings with so much fervor,
pathos, humor and grace." The above
estimates seem also to be the verdict of
the reading public, as over sixty thousand
of his volumes were sold last year, and
the publication of a new book from him
bas grown, therefore, to be a literary
event both in England and America.
John Boyle O'Reilly said long ago:
"He is the poet of Nature, of Nature do-
I mesticated, so to speak, to be the back
! ground of a simple human story, the sym
â  pathetic accompaniment of unsophisti
| cated feeling and speech. The Burns of
| America."
And Howells said only the other day:
"Without the poetry of James Whit
| comb Riley our literature would be so
| much the poorer that it seems idle to
J state the fact. He has more perfectly
: mastered his instrument than any writer
I of dialect verse since Lowell, and I do not
know why one should not frankly place
I him with Lowell as equally master in that
j kind.
"What he bas said of very common
! aspects of life has endeared him; you
| feel, in reading his verse, that there is
: one of the honestest souls that ever ut
tered itself in that way, and that he is
I true to what we all know, because he has
', Known it, and not because he has just
verified it by close observation."
Yet am I in doubt if they all or any of
j them knew that this man Riley meant so
[ much as he really means. Maybe Riley
! himself don't know.
May I intrude a few lines to show what
I mean by brief, baby words in work?
Here is something said at the grave of
Burns a quarter of a century ago:
In men whom men condemn as ill
1 ti:M to much of goodness still;
In men whom men pronounce divine
1 find so much of sin and blot,
I hesitate to draw a line
Beiween the two when God has not.
The lines have lived and will live.
Why? Because the words are not bigger
than the thought, and the idea depends
on nothing but the simple truth. For
you must know that the purest truth is
the purest poetry.
The poem of all poems, whether human
or divine, is "The Sermon on the Mourn." !
There is no debatable ground there. The [
words are the purest and simplest, and
yet the solioest, ever laid down in pave
ment for the feet of truth to pass over.
Riley is not a new American, as his j
name might imply. His lather was a con- '
spicuous Judge here in the capital of In
diana, a"d here Riley read law. The old
homestead lies a dozen or more miles out
of town, at the little city ot Greenfield. â 
Here is the home in .which he was born,
and here he is, and has been since boy- â 
hood, an idol. No other prophet was ever I
more honored in hil own land or in any |
was much given to ventilating the opinion
of the "bard who stirred within him"â to
use his own expression â every possible
occasion.
The people of Aligunj seemed to have
entertained a half-amused contempt for
Achmet, which was not to be wondered
at in a community of bucolics; but in
deference to the popularity and fame that
his verses had begun to acquire in the 'i
metropolitan city of Lucknow, they gave
him rather more than the modicum of
support that a prophet obtains in his own
country, and at one time, when he snd:
denly blazed into an exhibition of courage
that was hardly to be expected from a
mere poor, he was in a fair way of earn

land from the very first than Riley has
been in his, and in this Indiana entirely
and most bravely honors herself.
But Riley did not like Blackstone. He
ran away from his father and his books
and fell in love with a big dream and mar
ried it, and was glad.
Riley is a rich man, rides in a carriage
and dresses with the care and daintiness
of a "Bret Harte. These things don't
mean much of themselves as to this one
man, but they signify that right here is a
rich country and a generous people and a
refined country and a land where civiliza
tion has set foot firmly in the Indians'
path of old. Hereabout stand four great
cities â Cincinnati, Columbus, Indian
apolis and Louisville. These four cities
astonish cne with their fine carriages f
their refinement, propriety in dress, good
breeding, broad, heart life. These fforu r
frugal scrivener with simple tas'es.
At this juncture, and when his lucky
star seemed to be in the ascendant, the
pestiferous vanity which affects all poets,
more or less, and is a part of the poetical
temperament, led him to fall in love with
the daughter of the Thanadar (the chief
of police) of Aligunj, whose pride was
greatly affronted by the presumption of
the scrivener and bard. Achmet's "bub
ble reputation" soon collapsed in his
native village and he was on the verge of
starvation, when he attracted the atten
tion of a kindly Yankee who was ''tour
ing" India in search of tho secrets of
Hindoo magic. I .
By the wandering American he was
made acquainted with the fascinating, but
forbidden, savors' of swine's llesh and
strong waters, thereby becoming "an
alien to his mother's children," and from
this period many of his poems were of a
bacchanalian character. He rapid. de
veloped into an Epicurean like his great
prototype. 'Omar Khayyam, with -whose
noble poem he was well acquainted, and
on whose preserves he unconsciously en
croaches in the manuscripts before me. â *
By his newly found friend he was taken
to San Francisco, and during the voyage
his irrepressible bardic temperament led
him to fall in love with a native daughter
ofthe Golden West, who must have had a
great deal of fun with him according to his
own naive confession.
While in San Francisco he won a con
siderable prize in a lottery, which en
abled him to return to Aligunj by way of
Mecca. The pilgrimage thus performed
made him' a Hadji; and, thus â¢white
washed, wilh money in his' purse,* he whs
welcomed with open arms to his native
village, where he was adopted by the
Jemadar, and was recently accepted by
the Thanadar as a suitor for his daughter's
hand. â¢
On the death of his adopted father he
became the Jemadarof Aligunj, a position
that he still enjoys.
Wbatever may be the fate of his verses
done into English .they .'have' already
made him famous in his native province,
although : they are of a sort that does not
appeal to such popular taste as we nave
in this country, which is caught by the
careless songs of Eugene Field and James
Whitcomb Riley. The Oriental has far
finer instincts in matters crtaining to
art than we of the Occident, with all our
science and boasted civilization.
In the following metrical translations I I
have attempted to render the spirit of !
Achmet's muse rather than his mere
words. I need hardly say that much of
the bloom of his verses is lost in the rough
handling of translation :

The following verses, were sung as he
sailed out of the Hoogli, with no hope of
returning to his native land:

Beyond these pathless waters. "'

Seeking its sedgy nest: :,â '

Ere they retire to rest;

O Aligunj, upon thy brow,
And on thy weary land.
He visited Stevenson at Vailima, and

ten' on bearing of the great author's
death, and is not any worse than so much
of the verse that has been written, about

But I bad to talk that night and I had a

took his hand to lead him up be.-ide the

He was frightened almost to death, here
in his own town, with those who nad
known him from boyhood, and every
man and woman in that densely packed
gallery or on the floor his friend. His
face was sad and his voice trembled as he !
tried to speak. Men cheered and women
waved handkerchiefs, but he could not be
heard and soon fell into a seat beside the
Speaker. Then I knew why he had sworn
never again to appear in public. Only

The manuscript finishes with a prayer
that there should be no unchaste thoughts
in the minds of its readers! What would

ness,'' who keeps his own mind perfectly
pure, as set forth in his "short and simple
annals"? â¢ J. Laird.
the Senate into the House. Here he hid
away behind a mass of women and was
glad for a spell. But they dragged him
up into the Speaker's desk; ond, the
same as before. We got down and out of
there into the woods, and I don't want to
st-e anyone go through that again. Long
fellow came nearer to Riley in this than
any one else that I ever saw. Whitman,
did not suffer so, and I heard a man say,
as Riley stood on the steps wiping his
face, "Why, you couldn't scare Eugene |
Field or Bill Nye that way with a dozen, |
cannon."
And now, how we walked and talked! j
Squirrels, birds, brooks, snow, red beech j
trees and yellow maple. It is a dull, level
land about here, but Riley sees wondrous
change and color and "go" in it all, and
says so in the fewest, briefest, best-chosen
words in the world.
Now I am not eager to proclaim with I
Lowell, Holmes and Howell3 that Riley
is entirely great. He is great as Warren
was great at Bunker Hill. Warren fell, we
lost tae tight and tne ground where he fell;
then a long war, Washington, and for all
[ that we were never quite emancipated till
Lincoln. We ma*,* have even a longer
and harder fight fcr freedom, emacipa
tion, than that which lasted from Warren
to Lincoln, but we will be emancipated
from words, words, sooner or later. The
greatness of Riley is in his contempt for
words; tn his showing that great men use
small words, and, by inference, that small
men use big words.
Please compare a state paper of the
Great Emancipator with a recent state
paper of a man who lately left the White
House. Why, Lincoln could and would
have put a whole column of Cleveland in
a single paragraph.
When the Messiah of American litera
ture comes he wiil come ringing, so far as !
may be, in monosyllable-. And there is j
no reason why, in this republic, a state j
paper may not be, as Lincoln indicated, as
lresh, plain and simple as a song. The
man who intrudes a big word, or a new
word, or an obsolete word when a simple,
brief word will do, is to that extent a rob- j
ber of my time. He" is doing it, too, not ;
to teach or tell me anything. He is doing j
it to air his own-vanity and fancied im
portance. ;
Riley, the law student, must have ever
had a whole army- of words at beck, but he
uses only the bare and the sharp, sharp
blade. Tho Romans fought on foot, nearly
naked and with only the short Roman
sword; the- barbarians fought on horse
back, a-gi.iier with gold and steel, and
with the long, tasseied lanes in the air.
But it was the short Roman sword that
went to the heart and won the world.
And yet sha-ll'-T say I have not adored
and do not still revel in luxuriant litera
ture? I love it, but it is the love of wine;
a delirious intoxication that is not for the
best unless it be wine of the very best.
And we have more dealers in bad words
and bad wine. I know of but one man in
California whom I would license to use
words entirely as he pleases.
When Riley and I parted that first day
it was dark. We had to dress tor the show.
I was to talk in a chuich and he was to in
troduce me. He came promptly, to the
minute, most elaborately dressed and
pale, so pale, his' black dress suit and
shining patent leathers and black silk
stockings making his. white face seem as

j church. â¢ I wanted to go into the pastor's
study. I told nim I believed we had
friends there and a fire, for it was cold.
"No; no women in there; here." He
led us into a little side door, a sort of
storeroom for the janitor, and here we sat
and shivered as the great cold church
slowly filled. Men kept coming one after
another with their bicycles. Then two
1 women came to hand their rubbers in
through tno door to the janitor. Then
one came and oanged at the door, and as
Riley shyly opened it six inches she
shoved in a poodle dog. with instructions
to the janitor. Riley without a word
promptly passed the dog out and bolted
the door. We sat down close together,
for we were shivering, shivering, au 1 it
was dark in that den of bicycles and coal
scuttles and old rubber boots, and cold, so
cold!
lt was then that he gave vent to this
lesson:
"Uh, do not touch liquor. It will hit
you hard some day; hit you hard when
you are looking the other way."
We still shivered, and I wanted to go in
where the women were, in the pastor's
comfortable study.
"No, no; no, no."
"Jim, tell me; you never married; tell
me why. Who waa she? What became
of her?''
He took my hand in his as we sat still
closer together and said, in tbe soleranest,
sweetest voice lever beard, and as if to
himself:
"She was only a little seminary girl, the
sweetest little seminary girl that ever was
seen in a dream; and she went to the,
seminary and never came back. You see
1 hardiy knew her, only saw her a little,
only two or three times, and I only held
her hands once, and then only for a sec
ond, as she got in the sleigh by her father
and then I, I leaned over and kissed her
little hands. That's all, that's all." *
And then he slowiy, lowly, so tenderly
repeated these next lines and was only
ending them when the audience impa
tiently called us from the dark and cold.
Yet mind you, these lines.while written in
his youth, are not characteristic. It is only
in dialect or baby verses that he is at his
best, is Jim Riley.

............. ........THE LATEST PHASES OF X-RAY INVESTIGATION
Why the Mysterious Radiance Is Visible to
Some Blind People
Instead of diminishing as the days go by ;
interest in the X ray is constantly on the
increase and any new theory as to its ori
gin, action or results is eagerly seized upon
by medical men, electricians and the pub
lic in general, ln some way the X ray has
not proved all that was expected a year
ago, but in others it has surpassed the
wildest conjectures as to its possibilities.
It has been shown that it 13 not a play
thing to be used by anybody, and it has
also been demonstrated that in experi
enced hands its field is almost boundless.
Ever since Professor Roentgen made
the discovery oi the existence of the X ray
scientific men have constantly been expe
rimenting to ascertain why the wonderful
rauiance is invisible to a normal oye.
Powerful enough to pass with ease through
a piece of three-inch oak the human eye
cannot see it While it is shown that a
space of many cubic feet around an active
Crookes tube must be a perfect glow of
light, as far as the human eye is concerned
it is perfect darkness. Truly this is mys
terious.
For a long time the generally accepted
theory was that the vibrations of the X
rays were too rapid for the human sense
of vision to grasp. It was estimated that
this was a trillion times the vibration of
ordinary whita in daylight. Then came
the astonishing statement that many blind
people experienced the sensation of light
on looking at a working Crookes tuba. To
be sure they saw no objects, but the fact
that they were able to distinguish light
was something wonderful.
Charles Guillaume, an eminent scientist ;
of France, has just issued a circular in re- ;
gard to tbis aspect of the X ray that seems ;
reasonable in many ways. Experiments ;
have also been made in this City that show I
the correctness of his reasoning. A copy |
of the circular in question has been re- â¢
ceived by Professor Van der _<aillen of the ]
School of Engineering, and he has only
been too willing to (show it to those inter
ested.
In Lis circulars Guillaume states that
he was led to his investigations by the
acknowledged connection between the X
ray and the ultra v.olet rays of the
spectrum. it has been shown photo
graphically that the ultra violet rays ex
ist, and yet they cannot be seen by the
human eye. Whether they are also capa
ble oi penetrating solids is still a matter
of conjecture, owing to the lack of appa
ratus fur collecting and separating them
from the other colors of the spectrum.
Following up his theory, Guillaume
concluded that there was something in
the normal eye tbat resisted the X rays
and prevented their reaching the nerve
centers. The aqueous humor and crys
talline tense of the eye are as transparent
to ordinary light as the finest window
glass, but investigations show them to be
as impervious to the X ray as a piece of
lead. This is why tne rays cannot be
seen.
In many cases of blindness, particularly
blindness caused by some accident, the
optic nerve is in perfect condition, but the
structure of the eyeball has changed. The
greater portion of it has decayed and
become, instead of a perfect piece of
mechanism and an arrangement of refrac
tory atom-, merely a piece of organic
matter like the tissue in many o;her parts
of the body. In this condition it is plainly ]
The Oldest Brick Building In San Francisco
On the southwest corner of Merchant and Montgomery streets -
stands an old, weather-beaten, two-story structure â a pioneer of
1850 â the oldest brick building in San Francisco. It has an
annex on Merchant street, erected a year or so later, and on its
facade workmen have been engaged for several weeks past in
stripping off the old mastic or cement covering, which has been
gradually peeling off for years past and falling at intervals to
the imminent peril of the headgear of passing wayfarers. Now
it presents a rejuvenated appearance, with afresh coat of cement.
Of these two old landmarks, familiarly known to the pio
neer as the Naglee building, work on the
one on the corner of Montgomery and
Merchant streets was commenced on May
11, 1850, and the structure completed four ;
months after. Its owner then â Captain
Henry M. Nagleeâ was graduated at the
head of his class at West Point in 1835, and
after serving a few years in the Fifth
United States Infantry he resigned and
took up the occupation of a civil engineer
and surveyor. At the outbreak of the Mexican War Nagleo
girdled on his sword and fought valiantly in Old Mexico, and
while hostilities were still progressing was commissioned as
captain of Company D, First Reyiment of New York (Steven
son's) Volunteers and arrived in Verba Buena (now San Fran
cisco) with that regiment in Marcb, 1547. During the War of
the Rebellion he served with distinction as major-general of
volunteers. United States army. As a manufacturer of fine
brandies he is well remembered by old-time connoisseurs and
vivants. in th old Naglee building was held the first ses
sion of the United States District Court lor
California, and a view of the present sump
tuous quarters of the United States District
Court and those of its attaches in the Ap
praisers! building taken in comparison with
those of 1851 leads one to reflect upon the
improvements made in courtrooms and
clerks' and marshals' offices in the cycle of
time now verging on close to a half century.
Judge Ogden Hoffman Jr. was the first
Federal Judge to preside in California, and on March 19 1851
within the old walls of the Naglee building be ordered his com
mission as Judge of tho United States District Judge for the
Northern District of California to be spread upon the court min
ute*. This old-time parchment bore the signature of President
Millard Fillmore Â»nd was attested by Daniel Webster, Secretary
ol State. David F. Douglass .was the First United States Mar
shal and his deputy was George Perm Johnston, well known as a
newspaper writer in journalistic circles. Tne first United States
Grand Jury was also impaneled in this building, in tho latter â 
part of 1851, and after serving two days
brought in twenty indictments against
Captain "Bob" Waterman, familiarly *. JJ]y.t-r.
known as "Bully" Waterman, of tho ship
Challenge, and his chief mate, Douglass.'
They were charged with murder in one in
dictment and in the otbers with cruelties
practiced on the crew of that vessel. Learn- . ....
ing that Perm Johnston was after him with
warrants of arrest, Douglass "took to the
woods." There was intense excitement in the community at
his escape. Marshal Douglass offered a reward of $1000 for bis
capture and about a week after Colonel Jack Hays, Sheriff of
t-'in Francisco, assisted by a deputation of sailors, captured the.
male near San Mateo concealed in the bottom of a farm *
wagon, on his way to Monterey, where Mate Douglass contem
plated shipping on a brig to escape justice. Both captain and
mate, although acquitted of the murder charge, were ; heavily >
fined on the other indictments.' Among the attorneys in* 1851
"â ho had offices in the court building was A. P. Crittenden, who
' seen that it will offer no more resistance
to the X ray than a portion of skin, ana
that if the nerves are still perfect, the
rays will reach them and the sensation of
light be conveyed to the brain.
To ascertain the correctness of Guil
laume's theory several experiments were
made for Tue Call on both normal and
blind eyes. Professor Van der Naillen
Kindly loaned his apparatus for this pur
pose, and the results have been more than
enough to show that Guillaume is on the
right tracK at least. What the future will
develop remains to be seen.
For these experiments the eyeballs of
different domestic animals were used,
most of them being obtained in Butcher
town as soon as the killing was done.
There was the greatest uniformity of re
sult observable in ail the tests.
In the first experiment the naturally
blind eye of a calf and also a normal eye
of the same animal were placed side by
side on the same plate and given exactly
the same. time of exposure. They were of
course developed at the same time and
printed on the same sheet of paper.
The proof showed the normal eye simply
as a dark spot, with a slight indication of
1 the crystalline lens appearing a little
', darker than the other parts. The conclu-
I sion to be reached from this is that the
rays could not pass through the "eye. Tbe
biind eye, on the contrary, freely per
mitted the passage of the X rays and ap
peared quite light, with considerable dn
lerentiation of the layers. Tnere was a
slight indication of the lens and also sev
eral spots that were meaningless. But the
difference between the two eyes was ap
parent at a glance.
Experiments were also made with the
eyes of sheep and rabbits and the results
were about the same in all cases. The
normal eyes came out perfectly black in
all instances, but the blind eyes showed
different comparative shades, owing, of
course, to the condition of the tissues.
Experiments were also made with eyes
artificially blinded. From some the lens
was removed and others were injected

ture of the tissue. , : ft "_-
On the whole the results of these tests
were similar to the others. The normal
eyes showed dark and the artificially
blinded eyes permitted the passace of the
rays in spots, possibly such spots as were
acted on by the injected chemicals. The

removal of the lens was clearly shown,
although the aqueous humor that re
mained showed as a dark plane.
The eyes of sheep and rabbits did not
give as good radiographs as those of
calves and sheep," for the reason that they
were much smaller and the differentiation
was not as plainly indicated. Still, in
every instance the results showed that
the X rays passed through the blind eyes,
more or less, but were resisted almost
entirely by the healthy eyes.
"But what use is all this?" some might
ask. The answer is, possibly a great deal
and possibly none* It may be very useful
at opening up new fields in the study of
radiation which will be of great use in the
future. It may be all wrong and can only
be put down as so much timo wasted in
the study of science. -yi-y
But it would seem as if it would be use
ful in determining the extent of an
afllieted person's blindness. It has been
demonstrated from time to time that per
sons who have lost the sight of an eye
through some accident have nearly al
ways been able to sco the X raj*. This
would prove that the nerves were not in
jured, and that if the eye could be re
paired sight would be restored.
Cases of people blinded from other
causes might be tested if the physician
could determine the condition of the eye
ball. Should he be able to ascertain that
it was in a condition to allow the X rays
to pass through it, and the person still he
unable to see them, 1: would show that
the nerves wero dead and blindness por
mnn?nt. On the other hand, if the sensa
tion of light was experienced, and there
was hope of repairing the eyeball, there
could be little doubt of a permanent re
covery. The assurance of this would un
doubtedly be a great help to the patient.

A Possibility That the Rays May Be Ex
amples of Universal Force
About one year ago the scientific and
unscientific world was startled by an an
nouncement that a professor in the uni
versity at Wurzburp, Germany, had dis
covered a means whereby the hidden in
| terior of the human frame might be ren
dered visible. Professor Wilhelm Konrad
j Roentgen, while engaged in electrical ex
; periments, discovered that certain "rays"
; penetrated opaque bodies and produced
J effjets analogous to those produced by
j rays of light upon a sensitive photograph
i plate, although the plate was inclosed in
1 a plate-holder. In other words a perfect
| outline picture was produced without cx
i posure to light. *yA\
Unable at the time to definitely deter
mine the chemical, mechanical or other
attributes of the rays, the term X was
given them, X standing for an unknown
quantity. Since their discovery a great
many people have satisfied their curiosity
regarding the rays, and have learned that
it is quite easy by the employment of the
ray to produce a photograph of the bony
structure of the body, or of coins, etc.,
hidden within a box or purse. The flesh
of the body and the substance of the box
or purse offer no impediment to the pas
sage of the X raj-.
These remarkable happenings, involv
ing a sudden setting aside of all previous
conceptions of the limit and power of
human vision, however artificially aided,
were sufficient to confer upon the newly
found power a reputation bordering on
the miraculous, and it is not improbable
that many people believe that with the
use of the X ray it i 3 possible to see for
long distances through walls of bouses
without number. It is to assist in creat
ing a proper idea of what the new dis
covery really is, what it is capable of
doing, and to what extent the knowledge
of its qualities and abilities may modify
our present conception of natural physics
that this article is presented.
All forces of powers are termed energy.
The science of physics uses the term "ra
diant energy" as meaning energy pro
ceeding outward from a source and pro
ducing effects at some distant point. The
energy may be transmitted by its actual
transfer to the distant point of matter, as
the flight of a bullet from a gun; or it
may propagate itself along a line by the
motion of the particles of the media
through which it operates. If you lay a
number of marbles in a row, touching
each other, and then strike one end of the
row the marble at the distant end will
move away. All the marbles intermedi
ate between the one struck and the one
moved will show no movement. Each
one transfers the energy it receives to the
next one, no one undergoing mere than
very slight displacement. This is the
movement of ordinary lieht ''wave mo
tions." The former, represented by the
flight of the bullet, is that of the X ray.
The X ray is ptod tied by the employ
ment of a glass globe from which the air
is almost but not quite exhausted. Two
wires enter the globe through its glass
sides. One of the wires terminates inside
the globe in a small concave disk ; the other
wire has on its end, within the globe, a
small platinum plate set at an ancle of
forty-five degrees. A current of electricity
of very high frequency and potentiality,
obtained either from the secondary wire
of a powerful induction coil, or from a
static machine, is sent through the glass
globe, the anode terminator being
attached 10 the wire having tho pla
tinum plate, and the cathode to
the other, and while the current passes
there is thrown off from the platinum
plate what is known as the X ray. Al
most every schoolboy is familiar with the
fact that if a wire carrying a current be
broken a spark will occur at the break.
For convenience in distinguishing tho ter
minals of an electric circuit, the end giving
off a negative current is called the cathode
and the positive the anode.
In the operation of the arc light it is
found that the anode carbon forms a cup
like depression on its end and is decom
posed more rapidly than is the cathode,
showing that a stream of force pastes
from the cathode. Hence in experiments
upon electrical emanations, especially in
â¢S.mplf farm of Focus Tube.
Imhroved -form of Focu.l Tube.
vacuum tubes where the energy becomes
luminous, the cathode ray is the impor
tant one. The X rays are radiant ener
gy. They are possessed of a singular di
rectness of purpose. m they cannot be di
verted or turned from their path, refracted
nor reflected, ns may be rays of heat and
light and sound. They are not the cath
ode rays reflected from the platinum
plate, for the cathode rays pass completely
over to the anode terminator to form the
circuit. They induce chemical action in
certain classes of matter, as a photographic
plate. They cause fluorescence when they
fall upon certain substances; that is, the
substance"* plow with light when the "X"
rays strike them. The rays are propa
gated in straight, direct lines, and are not
susceptible of polarization, as are those of
lieht. They discharge all bodies either
positively or negatively electrified, the
former more rapidly than the latter.
The immediate results, the application
of the discovery to the needs of surgery,
naturally receive * greatest popular atten
tion, for a most wonderful knowledge has
suddenly been bestowed upon the practi
tioner. Not only foreign substances, as
was shot and killed by Mrs. Laura D. Fair on the ferry-bo*
El Capitan in November, 1874, and his law partner, Samuel W.
Inge, the first United States Attorney for this district. Judge
A. Glassell, who is now passing his declining days in afflu
ence at Los Angeles, also practiced law in the Naglee building.
On the second floor Dr. Hugh H. Toland, the well-known
surgeon, also had apartments frora 1850 to the day of his death,
some fifteen years ago. The owners of the present building,
the sole tenant of which is now a printer, intend fitting up the
interior of the structure to harmonize with modern times.
Already the old iron railings which pro
jected from the windows on Merchant
street, reminders of pioneer architecture
have been ruthlessly torn from their fasten
ings and consigned to the junk heap. The
bricks in this old building were well made
and laid in a good bed of cement and mor
tar, as is evidenced by their lasting quali
ties at this day. It cost Captain Naglee
$140 per thousand to lay the brick and the
fcrtisans employed by himâ carpenters, masons, etc. â received
from $15 to $20 a day, according to their skill.
A Remarkable |JeWspaper.
Mr. Edward Randlett of Alameda has in his possession a
relic of the Revolutionary days which he holds more valuable
than money. It consists of a copy of a newspaper prinied*27
years ago. The paper was the seven hundred and ssventy
' ninth number of the Boston Gazette and County Journal. 'its
editorial page announcements remark that it contains "the
fresheft advices, Foreign and Domeftic.'*
and bears the date of Monday, March 12,
1770. It is a four-page paper about -0x24

after the Boston massacre, which occurred
the previous week after the paper went to
press. This subject is given two columns,
including naif a column of explanations.

Among the most notable features of this ancient paper as
compared with the papers of to-day is the lack of headlines and
the editorials in the first column ot the front page. Not a head
line appears in the whole issue. Reports of a meeting of free
holders of the town of Roxbury is given. It was called "to
know the minds of the Town, whether they will do anything to
ftrengthen the hands of the Merchants in their Non-Importa
tion agreement."
The advertisements are unique as wel
as ludicrous. One, Smith offers a reward
for money lost between his residence and
the residence of Widow So-and-So, detail
ing the hours between whicli it was lost.
The legal ads would be the laughing stock

There is a. lady in Augusta who has never heen from
under tne old Confederate flag. Her name is known, but by
request it is Withheld. Whether walking, eating .or -sleeping,
there i-< always a Confederate flag over her head. While walk
ing on the streets there is always a fleg in her hat, and, no mat
ter how many hats or bonnets. she has, there is always to be
found a flag pinned on the inside of the crown. On the head
post of her bed is securely fastened a large "flag of the Con
federate States. The flag is as necessary for her as three meals
J; a day. * She says she has never surrendered and never. wilL
bullets, needles, etc., in the human body,
are accurately located. Out the healthful
or unhealthful condition of the internal
organs may be discerned and determined
by the use of the X ray. If nothing
else had resulted from Professor Roent
gen's discovery, this alone must place It
in the front rank of valuable acquisitions.
Bnt it is the further fact that much of the
action of the ray is bounded by totally un
known law, which arouse speculative in
quiry among scientists.
The question is. What bearing has the
newly discovered physical manifestation
on our preconceived notions of the phy
sical universe? It is one that awakens
profound contemplation among students
of the sciences.
What are these rays? They originate at
that point on the platinum plate where
it is bombarded by the cathode ray. They
are in some . respects electrical in char
acter and in others not. They seem to
follow some of the known laws governing
light, and again disregard them.
There is an increasing tendency among
investigators to assert that the primal
cause of physical manifestation, the
universal force, is some form of electrical
energy. What is termed space, the space
between the planets, is said to be filled
with ether, but just what ether is no one
seems to know. Some say it is matter;
others say it is not. Phenomena occur in
the ether, light is transmitted throngh it,
perhaps formed in it; electric and mag
netic phenomena, attraction and repul-Â»
sion have their field of action in it.
The X ray is the product of electrical
energy and is manifest only in vacua ap
proacning that of spac-*, and its force in
creases with the reduction of temperature.
In many things it exhibits fts greatest
powers under conditions which approach
the conceived idea of interplanetary
space. Did Roentgen discover a means of.
making actual exhibition of the universal
force? May it not lead to the positive de
termination of the vexed question as to
the character of the ether? Common air
consists of two gases oppositely electrified,
which if decomposed would expand enor
mously. The single fact of the X ray's
ability to discharge electrified bodies is
pregnant with meaning, for, by its opera
tion along this line it may be found possi
ble to utilize such action in the generation
of dynamic ener.-y to wort machinery.
It may be possible to employ some modi
fied application of the X ray to disrupt
the molecular bonds of the gases, and
then power will become unlimited.

And over the world the twilight falls.

NEW YORK, N. V.. April 16, 1397.â Mr5.
John D.-ew, that grand old actress, of
whom America should be more than
proud, is to me one of the living examples
of what a cheerlul soul and buoyant dis
position can accomplish In a face and
figure when moro than three-score years
have tolled the knell of youthful dreams.
I saw Mrs. Drew the other afternoon at a
business meeting of the Professional
Woman's League, of which she is one of
the vice-presidents, and as I looked at her
I pondered on the philosophy ol an active
lile and a busy brain. Mrs. Drew is just
73 years old, ami it is not exaggeration to
declare that she doesn't look a day over
50. Her completion is as clear and -'ink
tinged as a girl's, and her young grand
daughters cannot boast of clearer, bluer
eyes.
At present the stage can boast of many
very old and prominent actors and
actresses. There's Joseph Jifforson, who |
paints teal oil painting, writes stories and I
autobiographies, goes fishing and plays
hi** tattered, and worn-out Dutch char
acter, Rip Van Winkle, at least 200
nights in the year. By the way, though
Jefferson is considered our representative
Armrican actor, few of our countrymen
have ever pau-ed to think thai after all he
's hut a Dutch dialect actor. "Rip Van
Winkle" has, of course, made a fortune
for Joseph Jefferson, but it does seem
rather incongruous that we should place
on a pedestal a gentleman who has never
attempted to auvance American dramatic
art; who has never produced a new play
written by an American, and very rarely
does he give his wonderful talents lor the
benefit of American charities.
C. W. Callahan, well mown in San
Francisco, has been in New York for sev
eral weeks. Mr. Callahan has recently
returned from Africa, where he was
interested in gold mines. On Wednes
day he left New York with a party of
Englishmen, en route to Rossland, B. C,
to inspect mining properties there that
are reported to be exceedingly rich. The
party will go via Portland, Or., where
they will stop several days cefore continu
ing on to Rossland. Among the party is
the popular financier, Eugene la Cour of
Fresno. Mr. la Cour has large interests
down in San Felipe, Guatemala, and but
recently returned from there to join his
party of friends going to British Columbia.
Among the many callers from Califor
nia who were welcomed at the New York
Call offices, 34 Park Row, this week were j
Raoul Auzeriis and E. M. Leaden of San j
Francisco. Mr. Auzerais and Mr. Ledden j
will open offices in New York next month
and anticipate remaining permanently.
They will represent the San Francisco
Hunt Loom and Fabric Company, of
which Samuel J. Hendy is president. Mr.
Auzerais' sister, Mrs. E. T. Sterling, is a
resident of San Jose.
Mrs. W. M. Hickman and Miss Mary S.
Hickman, of San Francisco, have been in
town since last Wednesday. They have
apartments at the Stewart. Mrs. F. Saw
yer arrived from San Francisco on Friday
and is a guest at the Astor. House. Wil
liam Hanchett of San Francisco, after a
short visit in this city, proceeded home
ward Friday.
Livingston Gilson floated into the Wal
dorf Hotel on Easter morning and regis- i
tered amid the bustle and rustle of a
happy holiday. He must have felt quite
at home when the perfume of the nodding
Easter lilies and roses was wafted to him
from the handsome pilmroom, for the
profusion of flowers was such as to make
one believe a big chunk of California had
been transported to this Eastern shore.
"Mose" Gunst, the genial and popular
Police Commissioner of San Francisco, is
another gentleman who arrived in time
to enjoy Easier Sunday and watch the
vast procession of church-goers decked in
their wealth of gorgeous Easter finery.
Mr. Gunst has apartments at the Savoy,
where Fifth avenue empties its moving
throngs and thousands of equipages into
the great wide entrance of Central Park.
"Mose" Gunst told a newspaper reporter
yesterday that "San Francisco has the
finest police force in the world." True to
bis colors be proudly referred to the fact
that "out of the force of GOO men 460 are
native-barn Americans and 300 of the 460
are native, sons of California." Surely
New York cannot boast of- a comparative
majority of . American-born citizens en
rolled on the police force. Mr. Gunst will
sail on tho steamship Paris April 28. Mr.
and Mrs. Al Hayman wili sail on the
same steamer. They will nil remain
abroad several months. Mr. Gunst has a
host, of loyal friends in Gotham, and
doubtless his last few days on this side of
the briny deep will be filled with the
gayest of dinners and suppers given in his
honor.
Miss Virginia Foltz will leave on Satur
day, the 24th inst, for Florence. Italy,
where she will finish her musical and
vocal education under the direction of the
celebrated maestro, Signor Vannencini.
Miss Foltz, during the past two years and
a hall, has been a pupil of Whitney at the
New England Conservatory, Boston. Her
advancement has been remarkable, and
on ies are enthusiastic in their praise of
her voice and the wonderful possibilities
it holds. Though but 20 years old, Miss
Foltz (is gifted with a. contralto voice of
unusual strength and register. She is a
native daughter of San Jose, Cal.
Leon Bocqueraz of San Francisco sailed

white and yeilow leather belts with little
chatelaine purses to match are for sale in
all the big shops, and for the* sum
mer girl they will be very pop
ular, because the little purses are
large enough to hold a fine cambric
handkerctii.f. The silver chatelaine with
many ornaments of silver is coming into
vogue again, and wilt doubtless become
very popular. The new spring shirtwaists
are positively too lovely to wear and spoil
by laundrying. Many of the thinner ones
are made over a lining of colored silk or
sateen. Ginghams with satin stripes are
beautiful, and do not lose luster when
laundried.
Braided gowns seemed to lead the pro
cession of the ultra fashionable on Easter
Sunday. However, many modistes de
clare that they will soon be passe among
the beau monde, because of the cheaper
shop-made gowns which will soon flood
th- market. If you want to be quite prop
erly attired when you go drivi. g, besides
your handsome carriage dress you should
nave your hat, parasol and scarf or cape
to match. The latest things from Paris in
that line are wonders of beauty in chiffon,

UNSIGNED BANK NOTES.
Will & Flock Victimized by Two
Unknown Boy Cus
tomers.
Willi & Finck reported to United States
Secret Service Agent Harris yesterday
that they had b*en viciiniized by two un
known boys, who passed upon the firm
an unsigned Canadian bank note of the
face value of $10. The boys purchased a
ball for a small sum and tendered the note
ii payment. The ca-hierdi counted the
note at 5 per cent, such being the custom,
and paid the boys ihe remainder. V. .-
When the note was presented to the
bank it was discovered that it was of tho
Bank of Montreal, but unsigned, and
therefore worthless.
It appears that several years ago a lot of
unsigned bills were stolen from the Bank
of Montreal, and since that time they
have made their appearance all over the
United States. A few years ago they were
circulated in San Luis Obispo.

tained by Mr. Murphy at the chil
dren's playgrounds, who put them in
po-session ol the merry-go-round, swings
and goatcarts, besides a sumptuous lunch.
The little folks will not soon forget his

He Leaves His Wife and Two Little
Children, Destitute.
Mrs. Julia Harsey of 45 Van Ness ave
nue has been deserted by her husband, a
saloon-keeper. She reported to Secretary
Frank Holbrook yesterday that for some
time past her husband, . Georee Harsey,
owned a saloon on Grove street and Van

deserted her. On the afternoon of. that
day a stranger took possession of the
saloon and he remov-d all the stock and
fixtures. He exhibited a bill of sale issued
to him by Harsey. jJji-J.
When Harsev left he failed to give , his
wife any money and she and her little
children, G orge ana Willie, aged 2 and 3
years,: have since been dependent upon
the neighbors. The unfortunate woman,
who bears a good reputation, is at a loss
to account for the strange conduct of her
husband. Under the circumstances Mrs.

tion had a banquet and business meeting
at Druids' Hall on Friday night for tie
purpose of celebrating their victories and
putting themselves on record on business

opposition to the California Slate Pro
tective Association. The resolution was
as follows:
' "Resolved, That said C. G. Keller has no
authority to represent the association in
any manner; that the Saloonman's Jour
nal, published by Winfield Scott and rep
resented by Keller, is not in any respect
the organ of the association, and- that
neither the men nor the paper are in any
manner affiliated with the order."
At the same meeting Keller was ex

TOOK AN ' OVEKDOSE.
Robert Furgeson, a Victim ofthe Opium
Habit, Nearly Dies.
Robert Furgeson, a commercial traveler
from Lexington, : Ky., had a narrow
escape from death yesterday morning.
He has been living at 324 Jones street
and early yesterday morning was found
in bis room in an unconscious condition.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
and Dr. Weil diagnosed the case as opium
poisoning. The doctor thought that the
poison had got in its deadly work, but tbe
usual remedies were applied and later in
the day Furgesou was pronounced out of
danger.
Furgeson said be had been in the habit
of takintr small doses of opium and he sup
posed lie had taken an overdose Friday
night on retiring. He disclaimed any in
tention of trying to commit suicide.
Mrs. Schardin, the landlady of the
house, says that Furgeson had been out
ol work for some time, which made him
despondent. He was due her three
months' room rent and had been expect
ing remittances, which did not come.
ASPHYXIATED BY GAS.
A Loose Stopcock Caused the
Death of Mrs. H.
Lammers.
Her Husband Also Ovarcome by th-**
Fumes, but His Life Saved
by Dr- Bunnell.
Mrs. Lamm an aged woman, was
found dead in bed yesterday morning at
her residence, 2198 Devisadero street, and
her husband was found on the floor in an
apparently dying condition.
The discovery was made at 6:20 A. m. by
a man named Stoner, who lives in the
house. He called in Dr. Bunnell, who
found that the gas fixtures were out of
order and that the deceased or her hus
band in shutting off the gas on retiring
bad turned the key all the way around,
thus letting the gas* escape.
The suffocatinc fumes awakened Lam
mers,' who fell to the floor and tried to
crawl to the door.
The body of Mrs. Lammers was taken
to the Morgue. She was a native of Ger
many, about 60 years old.
Doctor Bunnell worked upon the un
conscious body of the hu-Dand for three
hours and a half, and succeeded in bring
ing him out of danger. Lammers said, as
soon as he ' recovered consciousness, that
he and bis wife retired at 8 o'clock on
Friday night and that he turned off the
gas very carefully. He had no idea how
the accident happened. The interstices
in the doors and windows allowed the en
trance of sufficient oxygen to save his life
until the doctor reached him.
PHELAN MADE PRESIDENT.
Reorganization Under the New Law of
the Teachers' Annuity aud Retire
ment Fund Commission.
The Teachers' Annuity and Retirement
Fund Commission reorganized under the
law recently passed by the Legislature at
the rooms of the Board of Education yes
terday. Mayor Phelan was elected Presi
dent, Superintendent of Schools Webster
secretary and City Terasurer Widber as
treasurer.
After the reading of the new law by the
secretary an informal discussion of the
manner in which the affairs of the com
mission shall be conducted was held, but
no action was taken .beyond calling a
meetiug of the 600 teachers who have
already signed the roll for next Saturday
afternoon, when a committee of five will
be appointed to pass on the applications
of teachers desiring to be retired. The
commission will act on the reports of this
committee and pending its organization
and report no applications for retirement
will be considered.
Under the new law the pension fund
comes out of the appropriation for school
purposes rather than out of the pockets
of the teachers.
SCHOOL TOR PEEOITA.
The Census "Will Justify an Additional :
Buildine in the Valley.
A canvass of the Precita Valley school
census is said to justify the demand of the
Precita Valley Improvement Club for a
new school building for that section.
The committee appointed at the last
meeting has selected a suitable site, but it
has not made its choice public The com
mittee proposes to bond one or more sites,
leaving the selection to the School Di
rectors, who have given it as their opin
ion that the residents of the valley are
the best judges of what is wanting.
The recommendation of the club for
the improvement of certain streets and
sidewalks was favorably received by the
Supervisors, and it is believed that its sug
gestions will be carried out.
The Board of Health has promised to
abate the offensive pool of stagnant water
at Folsom and Army streets.
The persistent efforts of President
Stephen Byrnes, Secretary J. E. O'Brien
and J. T. Graham in the betterment of the
Precita Valley are fully recognized and
appreciated by not only the members of
the club, but also the residents and prop
erty-owners of the section.
Tne transformation of Bernal Pare from
a sun-burned condition to a beautiful
park and the removal of the offensive
Pesthouse are conditions fondly hoped for
in the near future.

WHY INSANITY
IS GROWING
Interesting Facts Sug
gested by Doctors in
Convention.
Immorality, Worry, Overwork
and Under- Rest Destroy
the . Mind.
The Struggle for Bread Is So Fierc;
That Many Are Driven
Daft.
Dr. E. H. Woolsey of Oakland spranc
an interesting and far-reaching question
at the State Medical Society's Convention
at Golden Gats Hall last Thursday when
be suggested the possibility of a condition
when the insane of California shall out
number the sane. ' . jJJJ J'JJyJyMj.
"If the frightful increase of insanity
continues at its present rate," he said,
"the day is not far distant when the sane |
will be compelled to build asylums of pro
tection against the ravages of the insane. !
Besides this, nervous diseases are more |
prevalent than of yore, and the neurotics j
are becoming dangerously numerous.
"I submit that the only definite and
feasible remedy that the professional man
â MS to prevent the increase of insanity is
in the realm of surgery, where there are
definite methods of treating insane men
and women in such a way that society
will not have to contend with their off
spring. It must be borne in mind that a
large part of insanity is hereditary, and
that preventive surgery insures us against
the propagation of a race of men tainted
with insanity." I
Statistics covering a long period of years
show that insanity is on the increase at
an alarming rate in California and on the
! Pacific Coast. Wider generalizations,
however, show that it is a world-invading
J disease that increases with the growth of
civilization, being almost unknown among
savages. . ( .
An inquiry made among a number of
San Francisco physicians who make a
specialty of insanity and nervou** diseases
shows that much of the insanity of Cali
fornia is not indigenous to the soil, but
comes from all parts of the world,
j None of the physicians seen would con
sent to the use of tlieir name in connec
tion with the expression of an opinion on
the subject, all regarding such a publica
tion of tneir name as unethical.
From the general tenor of their conclu
sions they believe that many people suf
fering from nervous diseases come to Cali
fornia, which is a sort of asylum for the
I afflicted of all nations. Regarding this
State as a Mecca, they often arrive here
too late, break down and are sent to asy
lum*, thus swelling the figures here.
â  A prominent special. st who was once
assistant to the eminent Vienna professor, !
Freiherr yon Kraft-Ebing, st.id:
* "Carefully collected data snow that in
sanity is increasing rapidly in all the
great â  centers like Vienna, : Berlin , Parts
and your. American cities. â¢ The reasons
apply in a large measure to California.
."Primarily it is a disease of civilization
arid worry, and we 'are living in a very
busy century, crowded with nervous
never resting --people.- - Overwork and
1 under-rest may be laid down as two great
i causes of insanity. Men worry and rush,
refuse to eat, exercise and slÂ«*"*p Properly.
Many lead immoral lives. From the ex
cesses of drink and immorality much in
sanity arisen, and we find softening of the
brain a disease peculiar to men.
. "There is a certain disease that poisons
the blood, undermines the system and
I leaves taints in the blood of the offspring.
: From this disease spring many cases of
insanity."
Though it is difficult to obtain compara
; tive statistics of any value as to the in
crease of insanity during any given period,
one physician expressed the opinion that
the iucrease dining the past generation
has probably reached 10 per cent. "
"The point is just this," said a promi
nent member of the profession. "Every
individual has his breaking point, and if
you subject him to sufficient stress he be
comes insane. Capacity to suffer is the
: measure of intellect Irom the clam on up
: to the statesman, yet suffering leads. to
insanity. It comes from adverse circum
stances, worry, anxiety and troubles of
all kinds which cause great excitement of
the nerve centers.
"It is more difficult to get on in the
world than it was in the old days, aud
: whatever makes the struggle for bread
harder, whatever adds to the perplexities
and strain of the individual, increases his
cuances of becoming insane. Much of the
increase of insanity, therefore, is due to
-â¢xisting social and economic conditions.
Until people learn to live more slowly anil
rest more they must expect the machinery
to break down. Insanity is one form of
breakdown."
The late convention of physicians has
started an interesting discussion as to the
causes for the increase of insanity.
Will Take Up the Tracks.
The Market-street Railroad Company has
nformed Mayor Phelan that as soon as It can
complete arrangements to use another lino it
will abandon and take up the tracks on Cole
street, between Waller and Frederick,
back of the Chutes. The street will then b<Â»
paved by the City. Properiv-owners asked the
Mayor to ascertain the attitude of the railroad
company in the matter, and the letter was the
result of a communication irom him.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
A fine day for recreation.
Good weather is here and good times
are coming.
Europe has an ill wind, but it blows
good to wheat-growers.
The battle of Pharsalia is to be fought
over again and fought differently.
See Balboa avenue to-day and then see ;
what you can do to help the fund for com
pleting it.
The best thing for the Sultan to do now
is to go off with his fleet and set up a junk
shop somewhere.
The war in the Levant seems to be any
body's fight at present, but before long it
may be everybody's.
The Turk is evidently as good a fighting I
man as ever, but there seems to be some
thing wrong with his constitution this
time.
It is not yet certain whether the Kaiser
is to show himself at this juncture as a
war lord, a marplot or a bull in a china
shop.
Los Angeles did it beautifully and there
will be no complaint if her head is fonnd
this morning just a little bit too big for
her hat.
HRus.-ia hr.s changed her policy in regard
to Constantinople, but not her intentions.
She still keeps an eye on it with the hope
of having a hand on it eventually.
â 
The -Mississippi continues to spread it
self over as many Congressional districts
ns possible and evidently intends to get a
big appropriation or swamp the country.
Those German officers who were to
teach . the Turks bow to overrun the
Greeks in short order have received a les
son instead, of giving one, and will go
home wiser than they started out. .
The one disappointment of the war so
far lias been the withdrawal of the Turkish
fleet from the scene of action. The world
has been waiting a lone time for a good
sea fight and will never be satisfied until
it has one.
â 
The constitution of the proposed
Australian federation provides for an
army and navy to be controlled by the
Federal Parliament, and if that isn't ex
actly a declaration of independence it is
very much like it.
I.anahan of Texas has introduced into
Congress a bill "to decrease Federal
salaries and discourage the office-seeking
industry in the United States." Mr. Lan
ahnn at present is not engaged in that in
dustry. He has an office.
The Dingley tariff is good in the main,
but it needs revision in some places, and
the Senate, therefore, is to be commended
in going over it with careful deliberation.
California as well as other States expects
belter things than the bill gives.
Minnesota is said to give university edu
cation at State expense to a greater num
ber of students than any other State in
the Union. Michigan comes next and
then California. This is a good record for
our young commonwealth, but there is a
chance to improve it by heading the list,
and we may do it some day.
When times were hard fashion decreed
that women should have cloth enough in
their sleeves to make a whole skirt, but
now that better times are at hand the
Sleeves are reduced to the smallest dimen
sions possible. The financiers and the
â¢dressmakers ought to get together and de
vise more appropriate combinations here
after.
The check given to the Turks by the ap- |
pearance of- the Greek fleet in the Gulf of j
Salonica is a striking illustration of Cap
lain Mahan's theory of the importance of
the sea power in war. The Turks were j
â¢well started on the road to Athens after
carrying Milouna Pass, but the first at- ;
tack upon their communications by the
Greek ships caused them to halt' and
threw their whole plan of campaign into
confusion.
. -
A correspondent of the American Econo
mist, who has made a careful study of the
â wool industry in Australia, reports as a
result of his investigations that the cost
of producing a pound of wool is 12 cents
more in the United; States than in that
country, owing to higher taxes and land
values, and to that extent our wool
growers deserve protection. As they pay
taxes to maintain our Government, they
certainly should have some advantage
from it.
One of ths most curious contempt of
court cases on record Is reported from
Wisconsin. One of the Judges of tbat
State being a candidate for re-election was
assailed by an opposition newspaper, and
it so Happened that one of its attacks ap
peared on a day when the Judge was
holding court in the town where the paper
is published. The Judge not liking tbe
criticism summoned the editor into court
and -sentenced him to thirty days in jail
for contempt. Tbe case is now before the
Supreme Court on appeal and it is also
before the people with the prospect that
tne Judge will be taught that citizens of
this country cannot be sent to jail sum
marily for the exercise oi the right to
criticize a candidate for office.
THE EUROPEAN SITUATION.
When the Turks declared war against Greece it was reported as the general con
clusion of European statesmen that the peace of the rest of Europe depended upon
the ability of the Turks to march immediately upon Athens and close the war by a
short, sharp and decisive campaign. This conclusion was based upon the generally
recognized condition of the Turkish empire in Europe. The subject peoples of the
Balkan peninsula are known to be eager to throw off the Turkish rule, and it is an
easy inference that if the Greeks gained any marked success the spirit of insurrection
would be. encouraged, and a general uprising would. take place throughout all the
country south of the Balkans. ' . - \ i. i ; .*.."' i'H) J^/ySx VJ -'iO ''_ . :
There has been a weeK of war. and- the Turks, so far from gaining a success which ,
justifies the belief that they can speedily overthrow the Greeks, have been checked in
their advance in Thessaly, and have suffered many disasters in other localities.
Their fleet has utterly collapsed, and the Turkish coast is at the mercy of the Greek
warships. The result has been what was expected. Bulgaria has. already demanded
long desired reforms from the Sultan, and Montenegro and Albania are eager to fol
low her example. Under these â¢ circumstances, unless all the opinions formed at the j
outbreak of hostilities were radically wrong, then a general war in Earope is immi
nent, and may begin before this week conies to a close.
One of the disturbing features of the situation has been the shifting of European
alliances. The Emperor of Germany has been extremely active, and it is believed
has arranged a definite policy by which Germany, Russia and Austria are to act
together in any emergency that may arise. He is supposed to have incited the
Sultan to begin the war, and strangely enough he is also supposed to have encour
aged the Bulgarians in making their demands for reform. It is not easy to recon
cile these seemingly conflicting courses of action, but the evidence to sustain the
opinion that the Kaiser has been the moving spirit intthe councils both of the Turks
and of the Bulgarians is too strong to be easily set aside.
This activity on the part of the Emperor of Germany adds to the probability
of war. Mr. Gladstone was not far wrong when he described the Kaiser as a young
man of wbom Europe had but little experience, and that of a disturbing kind. He
has so repeatedly spoken of himself as a "war lord," and so contemptuously ignored
the memory of his peace-loving fathei Frederick in order to give an honor which
amounts almost to adoration, to his warrior grandfather, that there can be little
doubt his ambitions ara to be a warrior king; and that he will gladly hail any op- '
portunity to lead his mighty army into the field and win for himself a fame not
inferior to that of the war lords who have made his house famous. .'_â â '/!
Opposed to these warlike forces there is almost nothing except the commercial
I spirit of Europe, which desires peace, and the power of England, which will be used
to maintain it as long as possible. The continuance of Lord Salisbury and the
Queen away from England affords a reason lor believing that they do not regard
war as imminent. On this fact the advocates of peace build their hopes. It remains
to be seen whether they are trusting wisely or foolishly. Certainly Lord Salisbury
ought to know whether there is an immediate danger of war. but it is equally certain
that if he has any assurances of the continuance of peace they have not been made
public and are not known to any of the able correspondents who represent the press
ol the world in the Levant.
A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
There is much cause for gratification in
the renewed agitation now going on for
the establishment of a National univers
ity at Washington. - The list of wise men
who have pointed out the vast advantages
of such an institution is a long one, but it
is sufficient to show the importance of the
subject to mention that among them were
Washington, Jefferson, John Adams,
Madison, Monroe, John Quincy Adams
and Grant.
Among the reasons given by Washing
ton why it would be greatly beneficial
was that the assimilation of principles,
opinions and manners of our countrymen,
by the common education of a portion of
our youth, from every quarter, would by
lending to make tbe people homogeneous
increase the prospects of permanent union,
and he held that the primary object of
such an institution should be the educa
tion of our youth in the science of govern
ment. Among Jefferson's thoughts of. tbe
good to be derived from the university
was that it would more adequately train
the statesmen, legislators and judges, "on'
whom public prosperity and individual
happiness so much depend." /_ '_
The neglect of this scheme, so cher
ished by the great men of the Republic,
probably has its compensation ' in the
building up Of State universities, which
would probabl> not have been urged for
ward with so much energy, if there had
existed a National university -to satisfy
the more imperative demands for the
highest forms of education. The high
excellence of the State systems now estab
lished will make the National university
more perfect when it does come, and how
ever munificently endowed and equipped
and thoroughly effective these great State
institutions are they should be regarded
as mere complements to a Federal estab
lishment which would complete our edu
cational system even as tbe Federal Gov
ernment at Washington is tbe crown of
our political organization.
The results that would come from the
gathering at one center of representatives
of the finest scholarship in all branches,
not only from their teaching others, but
for their mutual assistance in search of
knowledge, could scarcely be estimated.
The advantages tbat Washington already
offers in many ways to the prosecution of
scholarly research make the capital a
most suitable site for the crowning glory
ofa complete educational plan, and its
existence side by side with Congress
would exert a beneficent influence on our
political destinies. ' It would be an admir
able check on ignorant legislation and an
invaluable aid to tbe statesmanship
which . wished to be guided in its
acts by the principles of enlightened
political economy as understood by life
long students of the science of govern
ment and the experiences of history.
NUMEROUS BOARDS OF TRADE.
It is a matter for remark that in spite
of the many evidences of depression in
business that have been manifested
throughout the country during the past
, two or three years, the result in this State
as broue-ht to light early in' '97 is highly
encouraging. For it has not been an ulti
mately injurious one, if we may. take
present industrial signs as a criterion.
The various periods of depression seem to
have produced only temporary discour
agement on the part of the people, from
which they have emerged with a reactive
enthusiasm.
The evidences of renewed activity have
in one striking particular taken a form of
organized associations, designed for the
promotion of industry and enterprise.
Most of these associations are Boards of
Trade, any number of which are spring
ing up all over the State. Within the
past few months the newspapers of Santa
Cruz, Los Gatos, Napa, Chico, Merced, and
numerous other towns have been ringing
with accounts of long and stirring meet
ings of citizens imbued with a desire for
local progress.
As fast as these various boards are or
ganized and their constitutions and by
laws are drawn up, and ; officers elected,
they enter upon a series of monthly meet
ings at each of which there are presented
propositions which the authors of them
have doubtless had in mind for a number
of years. * *,?'
The association of the representative
minds of each community presents a
definite outlet of expression through
which the various plans that bave hitherto
lain dormant may be brought to a locus
and laid effectively, and comprehensively
before the public, in whose interest they
are proposed. Consequently, many of
these plans, being thus intelligently con
sidered, will receive direct and effective
promotion.
In Los Gatos, for instance, no sooner
had tbe local Board of Trade been estab
lished than three excellent proposals came
forth and were shortly put into tangible
shape for the electors of the town to act.
upon. These were, projected resolutions
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, r SUNDAY, 2 APRIL 25, 1897.
to build a new Town Hall and Jail, fire
alarm system and municipal water works.
As a direct result of the Board of Trade,
these long needed innovations will proba
bly be realized. " â¢
The Chico Board of Trade has thus far
presented no very concise outline of its
intentions, but proposes to work for the
general interest of the community. The
Chronicle-Record of tbat town places at the
head of these interests the desirability of
interesting Eastern visitors in , Butte
County resources.
Santa Cruz Board of Trade was organ
ized last fail with the improvement and
embellishment of the Cliff House drive as
the main point at which to direct its en
ergies. . The drive in question skirts the
promontory from the â¢ bathers' beach
around to what is called Veu de I'Eau,
and is one of the scenic driveways of the
Btate. It being a conspicuous feature of
Santa Cruz as a pleasure resort, its beauti
fication was no insignificant undertaking,,
and in successfully carrying out their in
tention in that direction the citizens of
Santa Cruz performed a work upon which
they have reason to congratulate them
selves. The procuring of additional
street lamps and various other desirable
features are among the subs qnent
achievements of the board.
These are simply examples of what all
the interior boards of trade are doing.
There has been a veritable wave of enter
prise in tbese substantial forms sweeping
over the State within the past six months.
As an offset to the numerous com
plaints of dull times which ran murmur
ing and muttering over the land less tban
a year ago this uprising of boards of trade
is somewhat remarkable. It speaks well
for the people of California that in the
midst of adversity they are courageously
inspired to plan upon their own account for
the improvement of those conditions over
which they have control, leaving the more
extensive affairs which are responsible for
their trouble to the care of their official
representatives in Washington.
DANGEEOUS CROSSINGS.
The resolution offered at the last meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors requiring
the railroad company to erect gates at
certain dangerous street crossings, so as
to guard against accidents and afford pro
tection to the lives of passers along the
streets, was referred to the Street Com
mittee, nnd it is to be hoped that this
committee will not delay long in making
a report favorable to the resolution. The
matter is one of considerable urgency.
These crossings have been too long left
open and it is full time that tbe proposed
protection to the public should be pro
vided.
. There is nothing in tbe suggested meas
ure in the nature of an untried experi
ment. The erection of gates on railway
crossings of puolic streets has been prac
ticed in every country where railways
cross such highways on ihe level with the
atreet. To establish them here will be
simply to adopt precautions which in
many other places have long been em
ployed and have been found of great serv
ice to the community.
No argument is needed to show the im
portance of such protection for tbe public
at our -dangerous railway crossings and
no urging should be needed to induce the
Street Committee to promptly report ihe
resolution. It would be gratifying to have
the subject brought up for definite action
at the next meeting of the board and
there seems to be no reason why there ;
should be any delay in the matter.

IS SNOBBISHNESS AMERICAN?
Is snobbishness an American jrice in
digenous to tbe soil of the United States
and peculiar to its people? Until now
everybody who has had the advantage of
reading Thackeray has labored under the
impression that it had both its origin and
its home in Great Britain; but if one is to
believe an article printed in i the current
number of Cassell's Magazine on "The
American Girl fn London," this is not the
case. It has been imported into England
from across the Atlantic, just in the same
manner as the potato and the tobacco
pipe.
"Snobbishness," declares the article in
question, "first sprang to life in a republi
can country. Where princely pageantry
and ducal estate are a matter of course
they can never make anything like the
same impression as where they are seen
and their influence felt for the first time. '
It is the existence of this snobbishness in
the United States, so the writer goes on
to intimate, that causes the daughters of
Uncle Sam to crave for "some other pre
fix to their names than that of a mere
'Mrs.,' even though it be followed by so
well known a patronymic as that of Van
derbilt or Astor," and which impels them
to flock to Europe in search of titled hus
bands â English noblemen being preferred.
The article in question has been so ex
tensively copied and. quoted by the daily
and weekly press | of Great Britain that it
should not be permitted to pass unno
ticed, and possibly the following remarks
may derive additional weight from the
fact that they are written by an English
man who as a boy used to sit on the knee
of Thackeray, the unrivaled delineator of
the snob and of the snobbishness of his
countrymen. j
To begin with, there has been afar
greater eagerness manifested by the Old
World aristocracy ". lor alliances with
American heiresses than any anxiety on
the part of the latter to secure titled hus- !
bands. â  With a few isolated exceptions j
the matrimonial "stalking" lias been 1
done not by the daughter of Uncle Sam
but by the European nobleman, and the
latter' in the case of most of the so-called
international matches has been compelled
lo come over to this country in order to
proffer his suit, instead of being hunted
down in his lair on yonder side of the
ocean by the American Diana, as the au
thor of the article of Cassell's Magazine
would have the reader believe. The two
Dukes of Marlborough, the late Duke of
Manchester, the Comte de Castellane and
many others too numerous to record here
were all obliged to traverse the ocean in
order to see their American brides, and
far from their being "run after," as al
i leged, their offers of marriage were only
accepted after some hesitation, alliances
of this kind being subjected to much criti
cism not only by tbe bride's relatives and
friends but iikewise by the American peo
ple at large and by tbe press.
With regard to the alleged snobbishness
of the American, girl, it is just because \
she is not a snob tbat she is so much j
sought after by tie impoverished noble
man. .The. daughters of Uncle Sam are '
by no means the only heiresses in the j
matrimonial market. There is many a j
merchant prince in London, Liverpool, i
Manchester, Leeds, etc.. who can give
his girl .quite as nandsome a dower as j
any American father, and who would be
gled to pay heavily in order to secure the \
admission of his child into an illustrious j
family. But the trouble is that she does i
not fit into the latter. She cannot adapt i
herself readily to her surroundings, and j
the snobbery which is innate in the up- :
per and lower middle* classes of England j
exudes, so to speak, from her every pore, |
jarring terribly upon the nerves and re
finement of her blue-blooded husband, of
his relatives and acquintances. Her head
is turned by her social elevation and her
one aim is to conceal the fact that she is
not to the manner born. Her behavior is
invariably affected, unnatural and ex
treme. She is either abnormally stiff,
and even arrogant, or else subservient and
familiar. Above ail she is lamentably
lacking in that self-respect which imparts !
dignity even to the Scotch and Spanish
peasant, and in one word repels by her in
nate and ineradicable vulgarity.
That is why an English nobleman who,
by reason of the charges upon his heavily
incumbered ancestral estates, cannot
afford to marry, any but a very rich
woman, such as is not to be found among
the members of his own caste in Great
Britain, prefers to come 'to this country
for a bride. The American girl, no mat
ter to what class of the social system in
the United" States her parents may have
belonged, somehow or other adapts her
self at once and without any effort to
whatever circle she may be introduced into
by her husband. Thoroughly imbued with
that supreme respect of self which in a
woman is a jewel almost as priceless as
chastity, she does not err on the side
either of undue assertion or of * too great
1 subserviency. Her innate refinement
somehow or other inspires her just what to
do and what to say, and sweeping though
the statement may appear I have never
in all my acquaintance with "the Ameri
can girl in London," in Paris and in other
great cities of .the universe Known her to
be guilty of any solecism of speech or be
havior that could be described as either
vulgar or snobbish. Take a girl from the
English middle classes, a - maiden from
among tbe French bourgeoise or a young
fraulien from the Burgerscbaft of Ger
many and transfer them suddenly to some
more exalted sphere of society â bring
tbem, for instance, into social contact
with royaltyâ in nine cases out of ten they
will render themselves supremely ridicu
lous and will talk and behave in a manner
calculated to embarrass not only them
selves, but also those around them.
But with the American girl it is
quite different. She has the faculty of
at once assimilating herself to her sur
roundings, no matter bow new or strange,
to such an extent that no one would dream
that she had not been born and bred
thereto were it not for the fact that she
rarely makes any secret about her parent
age or seeks to depict it as better than it
really is. When it is taken into consid
eration that, in addition to this adapta
! bility, .tbis absence of snobbishness, of
vulgarity and of affectation, she possesses
an education infinitely superior to the
European girl of the middle classes, be
sides beauty, piquancy, readiness of speech
and repartee, and an elegance of carriage
and attire that is distinctly Gallic, it is
not surprising that the titled foreign
nobles should infinitely prefer the daugh
ter of the self-made American to the
womankind of the British, German; or
French parvcnu.lÃs|a3iÃStÃ
It is probable that these remarks will
not meet with universal approval on
yonder side of the Atlantic, although
they are undeniable. When, a short time
ago, in these columns, I ventured to in
stitute a comparison between the English
girl and her American sister, with regard
to the general knowledge which they pos
sessed, pointing out that whereas the
average American, girl, could ..without a
moment's hesitation rattle off the names
.of the various rulers of Europe it would
| be difficult to find one gentlewoman in a
bandred* in England who is} acquainted
with the identity of the President of the
United States, .Vanity l Fair, which - is
edited by the Earl of Dysart. assisted by a
staff comprising members of Parliament
and peers and peeresses of the realm, and
is perhaps the most extensively recognized
j organ of . English society, found nothing
j better to respond thereto than the follow
ing extraordinary exordium: â -.â *?;
"Burely you could not compare igno
rance as to the occupants of the throne of
Russia, for example, with a non-knowi
edee as to whether the estimable middle-
I class gentlemanâ who has. by means of
l gigantic bribery in dollars and promises,
or frantic tweakings at the lion's tail, been
elected a tawdry kind of glorified boss, to
be shaken hands with at will in the "White
House .for four years â happens to be
i called Elihu B. Moggs or Washington
j Lafayette Snooker." .
. This it will bo admitted cannot be con
sidered in any way as a proof of the
groundlessness of my arguments, but on
the contrary as an ill-natured and rather
I vulgar confession that they are true, and
I that the American gentlewoman goes out
into the world equipped with a far more
extensive stock of useful general knowl
edge than that possessed by the average
English woman. That in itself very nat
urally has been sufficient to render her
conversation and her society infinitely
more interesting and agreeable than that
of their British sisters to men of the j
world such as the Prince of Wales and
others equally blase, who look upon ennui
as the one enemy who has it in his power
to impair the enjoyment of their exist
; ence and to embitter the pleasures of life.
It is difficult to find any subject of con
versation in which the American woman
is not more or less at home and concern
ing which she is not able to talk brightly,
freshly and intelligently. But the Eng
lish women who can do so are few and far
between, and even tbese are looked upon
either a; blue stockings, as for instance
the Duchess of Sutherland, the Duchess of
Bedford and Lady Henry Somerset, or
else as dangerously fast and perilously
flighty, such as the Countess of Warwick,
save for ber beauty the British counter
part of Princess Pauline M. Metternich,
but whose brilliancy has led to her being
assailed with such animosity in society,
and even at court, as to render her posi
tion in the London great world exceed
ingly difficultâ that, too, despite her rank
and wealtb.
Tbis. absence of snobbishness in the
American woman is likewise conspicuous
in the American man, no matter what the
position which he occupies in the social
organization in the United States. He
starts out with the conviction, not that
he is better than everybody else, but that
be is just as good, that be is every other
man's equal. . That imparts to his bearing
a certain unconscious dignity which pre
cludes the notion of obsequiousness and
enables him to meet princes, kings and
emperors as man to man in such a manner
as to compel regard and respect. An
Englishman of tbe upper or lower middle
class ushered for the first time into the
presence of royalty will commence by
erring on the side of excessive .subser
viency, which will be transformed into
offensive familiarity if he is treated by the
j illustrious personage with j a sufficient
amount of geniality and condescension.
But in the case of an American, the prince,
as a general rule,-; does not bave to fear
tbis. Nor does be feel disposed to display
any degree of condescension, which would j
mark tbe difference in rank, and' therefore
might be resented.* On the contrary, he
talks to the American on the level, and
the consequence is that the conversation
is to the prince vastly more entertaining
and interesting tban that of nine-tenths
of his own countrymen. When in addition
to this absence of snobbishness, this self
respect' and sentiment of independence,
tbe American man happens to possess
refinement and breeding â with
which he manages to endow himself in an
astonishingly short time â he becomes a
most delightful and much-sought-after
friend and associate of the great people in
the Old World. Nobody dreams of in
quiring about his parentage. The fact
tnat be acts, speaks and behaves like a
gentleman is amply sufficient, and doors
are opened wide to him which are kept
rigorously barred to Europeans of infi
nitely higher social standing tban that to
which he belonged before leaving the
United States.
An American gentleman is welcome
everywhere, even in the most exclusive
society, and no questions are eVer asked
concerning his birth, bis origin or even
his own antecedents. All that is neces
sary is that be should bear himself as a
gentleman. Providing he does this, he
enjoys an altogether exceptional position
in Europe, and it is a peculiar fact that
almost every monarch of the Old World
has one or more intimate American
friends with whom be is able occasionally
to talk as from one man to another, in
stead of having the feeling that he is
speaking from the top of a lofty altitude
to the . people down below. Only those
who have lived for any length of time at
the courts of royalty, and who have
; noted the manner in which the
anointed of the Lord are addressed,
the servility to which they are accus
tomed and tbe atmosphere of obsequious
ness by wbich they are environed, will do
able to understand how warmly the au
gust personages appreciate being occa
sionally treaied, not as princes of the
blood, but as mere gentlemen, as men
of the world. Americans thus distin
guished by the friendship and regard of
Old World royalty as a rule show that
they are worthy thereof by abstaining
from boasting about it And thus it ls
not generally known that it was an Ameri
can who acted as best man to the Gran
duke Michael of Russia when he married
Countess Sophie Mebrenberg, in defiance
of the late Czar's orders. There are sev
eral Americans, members of the very
smart Marlborough Club in London, who
have been proposed and put through by
the Prince of Wales, and still others for
whom he has himself obtained the privi
leges of the club during their stay in Lon
don. . The most intimate friend and most
trusted confidant of the so secretive Em
peror Napoleon 111 was a Boston
Young Emperor William, as every one
knows, delights in the companionship of
his former American fellow student at the
University of Bonn, who can boast of
being the one man on earth with whom
the Kaiser is unaffected, natural and free
from pose.
Indeed, there is not a crowned head in
Europe or a prince of the blood of any
importance who does not have one or
more American cronies with whom he
can unbend without danger of encourag
ing undue familiarity. These do not en
deavor to take advantage of the royal
friendship to serve selfish, personal inter
ests, and above all do noi offend nim
either by excessive obsequiousness or by
snobbishness. The soil of the United States'
is distinctly unfavorable to the cultiva
tion of the latter, and during the course
of a residence of several years on and off
in this country I have had the Â«***oportunltv
of observing that even those Englishmen
in whom the complaint ha* been most
acute at home have been cured of it be
fore tbey bave been here very long â the
remedy in each instance being tnat self
respect which is the birthright of the na
tive citizens of this great commonwealth,
and which seems to inflate the lungs of
even the lowliest immigrant from Europe
the very moment that he sets foot on the
soil of the United States. Ex- Attache.

circumstances as the one now declared to
exist. It was that of Russia against Turkey.
Russia had already massed large numbers of
troops on her frontier, and Turkey was also
engaged in the work of mobilisation.
On April 24, 1877, the Emperor of Russia is
sued a manifesto to his subjects, in which he
recited the interests of the empire in the
Christian population of the Balkan peninsula,
and the general desire that their condition
should be ameliorated. He declared that all
efforts at peace had been exhausted. He had
given the orders for the Russian army to cross
the frontier, and the advance upon Turkey
whs begun without delay.
By the opening of 1878 the Turks were com
pletely prostrated. Tne road to Constanti
nople was clear. Before the English public
had time to recover their breath the victori
ous armies of Russia were almost within sight
of the minaret* of Stainboul.
Soon Russia entered into a treaty with Tur
key, the famous treaty of San Stefano, by
which it secured for the population of the
Christian provinces almost complete inde
pendence of Turkey, and also looking to the
creation ot a great new Bulgarian state with
a seaport on the JEgean Sea.
England refused to recognize this treaty.
After some delay, discussion and alteration.
Prince Bismarck, assuming the new role of a
peaceful mediator, a congress of the powers
was called and the treaty of Berlin resulted.
The object of some of the powers, notably of
the English Government, was rather to main
tain the Ottoman Government than to care for
the future of the Christian race.
GEN. LANE'b ENGINEERING SKILL.
Columbus (Ivans ) Courier. .:-VrJ .
General Jim Lane of Kansas may have been
a good fighter, but he knew precious little
about military tactics or the necessity for
strategy In military movements. Lane had
established Fort Lincoln only a short distance
north of Fort Scott in the early days of the
war. It whs situated at the bottom of a little '
valley, which was surrounded on every side by
hign mounds. One day an inspecting officer
of the engineer corps of the regular army ar
rived and was astonished to discover the
strategic lacking which marked the location
of the post. :,â¢.*- j;V
"Who located this fort?" he Inquired of
Lane, who was in command. r * *':.'.
"I did, sir," responded the general. â  .-.,-i
"Well, general, this location is exceedingly
disadvantageous. â  ] The enemy could come up
on any one of these mounds and shell you out
and you would De practically helpless."
' "I thought of that, sir; I thought of that,"
said General Lane, with the utmost gravity;
"but at the same time I thought if the fort
was captured how easy it would be to recapture
it. sir."
THE SANDWICH UP-ET INGERSOLL
ijfi :.. New York .Press.
Bod Ingersoll was once terribly upset by
Justice Harlan. He was arguing an important
case before the Supreme Court when Harlan
with great dignity arose, and when a page
had pulled back his chair walked behind the
curtain that hangs on the right of the room.
There he found a glass of milk and a huge
sandwich of the railroad variety, which he
proceeded to devour while listening to the
colonel's oration. Between bites and sips he
would peer around the corner of the protect
ing screen to keep track of the speaker. Just
before reaching tne climax of his effort Inger
soll happened to look in that direction, his
eye caught Harlan in the act of introducing
the last piece of sandwich In his capacious
mouth and standing ready to wash it down
with the last drink of milk and ho stopped
short. The sight was too much for him. He
forgot what he intended saying and broke out
in a snicker. Justice Harlan wiped his lips
and returned to his seat with dignified com
posure. â

THE APE.THEIDIOTANDOTHER PEOPLEâ
By W. C. Morrow. Phllade phla: J. B. Llppln
cott Company. For sale In this city by A. M..
Robertson, Post street, Price 91 50.
When a good story, or volume of good
stories, is fresh from the publishers the pleas
ure which it gives to all lovers of literature
Will be felt in a much augmented degree Dy '
those who can claim the author as a posses
sion by virtue of his being a fellow-country
m*-** or fellow-citizen. Thus the feeling of
patriotism and pride In a sense of serai
ownership adds zest to the appreciation of an
excellence which the purely literary tastes
would have found delight in without consid
ering whence it came. Such is the double
- ture of the treat presented to San Francis
v, ma and Californians in this choice collection
of artistic short stories by one of our own
coast writers â one in whom we can take a
patriotic pride and confidently challenge
comparison with him by the writers of any
other State or country in the particular line
. which he has made a specialty. He takes
rank among the strongest writers of short
â stories now living, and is second to none on
this coast, although he has here a bright
array of competitors.
The glided griffin on the binding of the
book strikingly suggests the nature of the
stories inclosed, and partly prepares the read
er's imagination lor those charms of the grew
some and the grotesque which the author has
used with consummate cleverness to spell
bind the attention. To say that they are bril
liantly horrible would but poorly characterize
the work ; though even if that were the sole
achievement in them, the amount of ingen
uity displayed in their construction, the skill
ful use of language, the extent and originality
of imagination, would combine to make them
of thrilling interest and of rare merit as ini
mitable literary productions.
Many of the stories are subtle analyses of
human passion, and deserve to be read care
fully and seriously pondered, not merely as a
matter of curous interest in literary skill, but
because they enlarge the understanding of
human nature. It is one of the highest aims
of fiction to so extend our sympathies that we
can learn more and more to put ourselves in
the author's place, and so br laden our com
prehension of the human mind. Particularly
is this needed in order that we may be "loyal
to the low, and cognizant of the leas table
majesties."
Mr. Morrow's book is superlative In lis power
cf making us realise the possibilities that
these "less scrutable majesties" exist In the
personalities around us, perhaps seemingly
far beneath â in rags, in convict stripes, in
the stupidity of the idiot and semi-idiot, iv
the unfortunate who ls condemned for a single
grave fault.
j With a talent of close kinship to that of the
â preat actors on the stage he shows us traits of
tharacter in these "lows," to whom we might
well be loyal as having a majesty of heroism,
patient endurance and of kindness, placing
them far above us, could we but be cognizant
of what is in their souls. Qualities which
need the searching of keen intellect and deep
sympathy to find now perhaps, but yet germs
half smothered of an exalted destiny beyond
our guessing, Indeed, many of the stories
read as if the thought of the less scrutab.e
â majesties was dominant in the author's mind
whenhe composed them. A fine example of
this sort of portrayal is the tale of "The Hero
of the Plague," wherein the ex-convict and
seeming fool, Baker, is so shown as to convince
us that he had wisdom enough in his dull
brain to wiu the eternal wealth of heaven's
approval.
The foundation of fact on which some of
these stories are built will give them added
interest. While the happenings are changed
and colored by imagination, there is yet truth
enough to show that the existence of such
characters is credible; and this hero of the
plague, for instance, really lived, suffered for
his own and the stupidity of other people
and wore a crown invisible to most who saw
him here.
"Where the tales are purely fiction the au
thor .possesses such a method of analysis of t
"details as to make things that would seem
highly improbable by less clever treatment ap
pear not merely credible but inevitable as
the outflow from the nature of the being por
trayed and his compass of circumstances.
The characteristics of his work are strength
in the delineation of the weird and grewsome,
a rare faculty for showing us many unex
plored abysses of mind and emotionâ passions,
hopes and fears, infrequent but intense, and
often felt by those tho tragedy of whose lives
we are prone to superciliously overlook.
There is a story in the collection called "An
Uncommon View of It," dealing with the pas
sions of a wronged husband and his gradual
change of point of view and intentions in re
gard to his once loved and loving wile, which
ih not so much a story as an essay on the
/higher manhood, and which is a most subtle
v tracing of tbe emotions and reasonings of a
Vioble being subjected to one of the most will
muzzling and (severe of trials.
The author evidently considers the best
thing in the collection to be the tale which he
has chosen to give title to the book. There
are some notable examples in the history of
literature where authors were unconscious of it
when they performed their best work. This
may or may not be the case in this instance,
but, while the merit of the story about the ape
and the idiot is appreciated for Its artistic
conformity to an Ideal combination of grew
someness with beauty, for its masterly attain
ment of that short-story desideratum, the sud
den surprise in Us development, and for Its
astonishing finale, so gloriously happy for the
heathen Chinee and so pathetically sad for
the serviceable ape who had brought this hap.
piness, yet, iv sp .le of these excellencies, we
would unhesitatingly choose as the master
piece of the volume the tale of "The inmate of
the Dungeon." Herein is dramatically told
the story of a convicted but brave and finely
fiber--d â one who describes, in patslonate
eloquence, the soul torture caused by the
jailer's lash, saying: "Then something in
side me twisted hard and then broke wide
open., and went pouring all through me like
melted iron." .. â 
THEY EXCHANGE SOULS.
FLAME!*â ty Robert Hicfaens. Chicago and
-New York: Heroert K. dione <-_ Co. Price
*1 50.
The ground for this curious study about life
and its passions was obtained by imagining
two young men of very opposite temperaments
exchanging souls. They were great friends,
ahd beiore they effected the exchange were
both safe from the temptations of the world.
Valentine was one over whom refinement had
more pouer than religion. "It governed him
with a curious ease of supremacy, nud held
bjim back without efl* irt from most of young
Â»'.au'sslii3." Julian had passions ungovern
able until he formed his cose friendship for
Valentine, ana then the purity of his friend's
life rebuked and inspired him into slnlessness
co far as gross forms of indulgence were con
cerned. Valentine came to believe that there
was no merit in his natural frigidity and
longed to "have drumming pulses, and danc
ing longing-, and voices calling forever In his
ears like the voices of Blrens." ' 83 tiring of
fcelflrs Saint Valenilne be permits his soul to i
feel the thrill and temptations of Julian's
warmer temperament. Out of the conse
quences is constructed a fairly good story.
CHARACTER STUDIES.
THE LANDLORD AT LION'S HEAD-By W.
D. Howells. New York: Harper -*"â * Bros. For
sale by William Doxey, Palacd Ho eL Price
*1 75.
Something good is, of course, to be expected
when we see Howells' name as author. In
this novel there are at least half a dozen char
acters drawn with skill, and the dialogue
tvlih which the book is r-*s!ete is clever. Tho
story opens with an account of an artist's trip
into the country to paint the Lion Head Moun
tain. He boards for three weeks at the Bnr
gin farm, and becomes so interested in the
characters he meets there that after a five
years' absence in Paris he returns to the New
England farm to renew his acquaintance with
the country people whose history makes most
of the story.
At the very first passage the author executes
some of his fine work in character drawing by
sketching the farmer's boy Jeff, who is a
strange mixture of good and evil. Jeff 'is aft
erward sent to Harvard, and his wild and
fickle career and his entanglements with
women of various character lake up a goodly
portion of the volume, although the artist,
Westover, is by far tho nobler character.
There is a lifelike scene in the parting be
tween the artist and the farmer's wife, when
there is a fine display of courteous tact on the
part of the artist and of simple-minded kind
ness on that of the woman as she tries to bu7
from Westover his flue picture of the moun
tain for a part of the board money he bad just
handed her. She is exceedingly liberal and
wants him to demand just as much of the $15
as he thinks is right.
Jeff falls in love with a country girl, Cyn
thia, who is far too good for him. There are
many interesting scenes between these two
and Jeff retains nobility enough to confess his
faults to her in order that she may not be de
ceived into marrying him with the truths she
should know unrevea.ed. Jeff becomes at
tracted by another girl of lighter character
and the passages between them are interesting
by contrast with those had in his previous
love affair.

THE IMPUDENT COMEDIAN AND OTH
ERSâ F. Fran f:rt Moore Chicago. H.S.
Stone Co. Forsale in Oils City by William
Doxey, l a.ace Hotel. Price $1 50.
These half dozen tales about actors and
actresses are of commendable merit. They
contain a great deal of witty dialogue, and
have that expert way of exceeding expecta
tion at the finish, which is one of the main
features in the art of short story telling.
However good the writer is at the start or in
the midst of his tale there is always a climax
of cleverness at the finale, and things some
times take a turn wholly unlocked for. There
j ls a good story about how David Garrick and
Peg Woflington, while they were preparing a
play for the stage, found one of the 'actresses
I too tame at rehearsal. In order to rouse this
I girl to more vim and passion in her playing of
the part of a jealous woman a scheme was re
sor ed to to make her jealous in reality. Then
she played stronger than they bargained for.
The story tha'. gives title to the book is about
the famous Nell Uwyn, the favorite of Charles
II of England. It abounds in wit. There is a
scene of pathos in It finer than the reader
would think possible when beginning to read
about the merry mistress of the profligate
king. It tells of how the man who loved her
I honorably and seif-sacrificingly when she was
I a young girl, coming home from the sea hop
j ing to claim her for his bride, but finding the
woman for whom he had labored and hoped
so long in the possession of his king.

DISAGREEABLY GREWSOME.
THE DEVIL-TREE OF EL DORADOâ
Frank Aubrey. New York: New Arast'-rdam
Look Company. For sale by A. M. Robertson.
Post street. City. Price $1 Ml.
That feature of the story which is given
prominence by the title, and the illustrations
to the same, are too unpleasantly horrible to
be commended. The tale describes a tree in
an unexplored region of South America which
has great writhing, snake-like branches reach
ing out for victims that pass beneath, then
lifting them to the deadly embrace of the
tree's center, where b? some vampire-llke
action the blood is sucked out of them. The
dry bones are dropped to the ground, where
hideous serpents hungrily await the ghastly
remnants. The romance is not recommended
to those of a nervous temperament. Other
fanciful descriptions of the wonderful unex
plored Roraima country do more credit to the
author's vivid imagination. - Â.:*.
AN ALLEGORICAL PAMPHLET.
THE KING, THE KNAVE A ND THE DONKEY.
By "Pythias Damon." Chicago: T. S. Denison.
Paper.
This it one of the Denison series of quarterly
Issues. It is a sort of a satirical essay on his
torical and political subjects. It is fatriy well
written, but there seems to be an attempt to
imitate the style of Carlyle, and as it is but a
feeble echo of the master, the work would
have had more force If he who writes under
the norn de plume of Pythias Damon had re
frained from borrowing another man's man
nerisms. The "donkey" in the tale represents
,the people. Perhaps the. best thing in the
book is ln the chapter on "The Heresy of Dis
content," in which is strongly condemned .he
teaching of the false idea that ambition and
perseverance will accomplish anything. "How
much better to say to the poor boy: .'You may
always remain poor, but now ln your youth
lay deep ana well the foundations of charac
ter, industry and steadfastness. These will
serve you pcor, and adorn you rich.' "

Pros. For sale by A. __ Robertson, Pcs: street.
Price 9 i 50.
These clever writings of the prince of hum
orists have appeared before in the leading
magazines, but they will bear repeating With
out vexlnit the ear, for twice-told tales are not
always tedious when the raconteur is a master
of his art. In his essay on "How to Tell a
Story" Mr. Clemens claims that the humorous
story is distinctively an American product.
The English, he says, can write comic ones
and the French those that are witty. The
humorous story is dependent for success on
the manner of telling it, but in comic and witty
stories the matter is sufficient to mak<vthem
go. There is something rather humorous in
the thought of Mark Twain undertaking to tell
other people how to tell a story. Talking to
the general public In this vein is much as
though a seagull should seriously try to in
struct us in the art of flying. "Only a portion
of art can be taught, and the artist needs the
whole." _________'"*'

find a welcome from readers of fiction. This
little tale cannot compare with that great
political novel with which Ford made a repu
tation as a writer, but there was evidently no
pretense or even effort to make it anything
extraordinary. It is, however, a very read
able story. The plot involves a mystery, and
there is a pretty love affair running all
through the tangle of the train robbery, which
adds much to the interest of the tale. There
ls, too, a surprise for the reader in the work
ing out of the motives for the hold-up and the
discovery of the unexpected class of people
who were concerned in instigating and exe
cuting it. We note quite a problem of the
true point of honor brought Into the'narra
tion by the [embarrassments of the railroad
man who hunted down the perpretrators oi
the train robbery. He was in love with a girl
who was implicated in the plot, and who was
as sweet, innocent and lovable as no one
could conceive it possible for an accomplice
of train-robbers to be.
WHERE A MAN WAS FOOLISH.
SAINT EVAâ By Amelia Pain. New York:
â¢ Harper <*_ Brothers. Price $1 25.
The sweet saint of this story is the daughter
of an Italian father ana an English mother.
She is beautiful aud so excessively innocent
that she possesses not even that knowledge of
tbo world to be derived from reading modern
novels. Her ideas are perfectly fresh and one
of her women friends has a way of asking her
questions about life and herself ln a tone of
banter which greatly disconcerts her, but only
serves to amuse her querist. Eva falls In love
with Clayton Seaford, who is ln many respects
a remarkable man, but appears not to have a
sense of appreciation. He proposes to her
and is accepted. Later he Inherits a vast es
tate and then his fiancee's value Is dimin
ished in hit eyes. She loves him too deeply to
bear his abandonment and her heart breaks.
"Sa ntEva" isa sad though a pretty story.
GOETHE.
Goethe himself has said that the faults of
great men , seem exaggerated as well as their
virtues: and if we apply this principle to his
case it ought to remove much of the odium
wbich rests on his name. Some of the accusa
tions which have been brought against him
are undoubtedly just ; but it is equally certain
that others have originated either in party
prejudice or from the jealousy of his literary
contemporaries. He is certainly to blame for
his desertion of Frederika, and probably for
other flirtationsâ though such behavior does j
not always seem to militate against a man's i
character.": Goethe's ; love affairs, though by |
no means to his credit, were of quite a differ
ent sort from the immorality of Byron, Burns
and Heine.
The accusation, however, that ha was a
selfish aristocrat, unpatriotic, insensible to
the sufferings of the poor and opposed to the
popular and reformatory movements' of h<s
lime, is untrue ' and unjust, and can easily be
proved so. That he was 'an . aristocrat cannot
be doubted; but so was Sir Walter Scott, ior
they were both brought up aud educated at a
period when ; aristocracy was considered the
natural order of society. *?â¢
*'.- Of all classes of people none would seem to
be so unfitted from their tenderness of leel
ing, their- pictorial habit of mind, and their

The matter of it is largely autobiographic, an.l

wanted to learn something of the facts con

years of the great Reform bill, there were
standard books on every subject, which could

ed in the reign of Queen Victoria,
there were only the interminable files of
newspapers to consult, except, of course, for
some special works dealing with particular
chapters of history, such as the Crimean war
or the Indian mutiny. This was the want
which the author of th-a History was anxious
to supply, and he started upon his task with
the conviction that there was no necessity for
making .eyn contemporary history a dry
record of facts and dates. A third and fourth
volume were added to the story somewhat
, later, and the review of events passing within
our own recollection was brought up to the
crisis of 1880, when Mr. Gladstone, at tha
head of the Liberal party, once more returned
to power. The fifth. volume now announced
takes up the story at that momentous epoch.

remembered that it could not be killed
with the fine shot in the gun he carried,
and it is very dangerous to merely wound
a bear.
He was anxious to go down the stream,

rectly in his way and would not run off
into the thick lorcst as they usually do
when a man comes near.
This bear did not 'seem to know that
any one was around, and stood as still as
the old log beside him, with his eyes fixed
upon the water running at his feet.
He stood jo still that a little bird, who
niirht have taken him for a black stump,

take, flew away again, singing loudly, but
still the bear did not move.

a few steps nearer, but still the bear stood
and looked at the water.
All ot a mi Ideti there was a great splash,
after which the man noticed a large, shin
ing salmon trout floundering UDon the
shore; for quick as a flash the bear had
dashed his great, flat paw into the water
and thrown the fish quite out 01 the
stream, almost before it had time to even
think of danger. Then he began to make
is dinner upon it. This did not take
him very long, and after it was eaten he
bolted off into the woods and the man was

He met no more bears that day, but all
along the stream he saw the scales or
pieces of ha/f-eaten fish and knew that
this must be the usual way for bruin to

More About the
Doodle-Bug.
The letter from Hattie Fairchild of

j doodle-bug rem nds me of an insect which
the children of an Eastern State call the
I ooly. They say it knows what is said to
j it, for when they call, "Oolyâ ooly, out the
ground !" it comes out. and when they

The children of a country school took
I their teacher by tho hand and led her to
an old upturned stump, at the foot of

I bugs. At first they saw only little pits in
, the sand, but when a little girl put her
! lips close to one and called, "Oolyâ !"
there was a movement at the bottom of
the pit, and Mr. Ooly looked out, then
drew back and threw up a little shower of
sand. Then he looked out again, and
this time was taken up in the little girl's

and looked very qu-er, with his short]

How queer! Is It not? And how strange
that such a common-looking little bug
should act in such an uncommon way.
If we observe closely we will find a rea
son for the habits and manners of even the
least of God's creatures, and school chil
dren, near to nature, may often learn
truths that men of science have not dis
covered.
Now I will tell you what the scientist
know about the doodle-bug or ooly. They
call it Myrme leon. It looks hard, don't
it? But not so hard after all, for myrrae
means ant and leon is lion, so there is the
name of the doodleâ ant lion.
The strangest fact about this insect is
the fact that it is hatched from an egg
laid in the sand by a small dragon fly.
As soon as lie is hatched the ant lion
be ins to burrow beneath the sand and
scoops out a small cone-shaped pit, at the
bottom of which he lives
Tr.e pit is really a trap, for should an
insect step over the edge he slides down
with the loose sand to the bottom, where
the ant lion lies waiting to seize him.
If a fly should tumble in and attempt to
clim'i out or to fly the lion throws up his
spray of sand which bring him down
again.
The ant lion sticks as a spider does, and
when he has finished his feast he jerKs the
remains out of the pit, seizins; them in his
fore fee: and going backward.
For two years he lives as an ant lion,
and then when full grown he spins a
cocoon for himself and in three weeks

When children call "Dood.'e! Doodle!"
or "Ooly! Ooly!" they are really playing
April fool with the ant lion. He hears or
feels the vibrations of the sound, and
thinking it a buzzing fly rushes out to
catch his prey, often throwing up his
shower of sand for their amusement.
While you are on your vacation this

; dents voted for the ones they wishÂ°d to
have on the editor al staff and finally suc

ary editor, girls' representative and boys'
representative.
The literary editor received and selected
contributions, which were then passed
upon by the editor-in-chief.
The boys' and girls' respective repre
sentative- acted as reporters, and were
constantly on the alert for interesting
items.
After all the literary articles were in
they were sent to the "art 'department,"
which consisted of two boys who were
very talented in the use of the pen, and
who printed and illustrated the entire
paper by hand.
At the moment the news items were
received from the representatives and
printed in columns reserved for that pur
pose.
Then the paper was neatly bound, and,
after being inspected and accepted by the
teacher, was read to the class by some one
who had been appointed to perform that
pleasant duty. 'IJJ-'
As all the work was done by hand, only
one copy of each number was printed, but
it was kept on file in the schoolroom, where
all might have access to its pages.
Its contents were contributed by
members of the class, and consisted of
prose and poetry, jokes and news items;
all of interest and many very instructive.
When the, first "number was completed
and placed on file, many visitors came to
see what they called "a wonderful piece of
modern (school) journalism 1"
The local newspapers sent their re
porters'.and the Siudent, was highly
praised and encouraged in their columns,
and that sixih grade became the banner
class of the City.
The Student was a grand success, and is
stil! alive and flourishing.
Now I hope these lines will encourage
all would-be editors to try to follow in the
footsteps of these children. Obtain first
the permission of your teachers, then get
your schoolmates interested, and before
long yon may rind yourself to be one of
the proud publishers of a school journal.

Pajaro. Monterey County, April 7, 1897.
Dear Editress: A long time ago, when I
was very small and my little sister was a
baby, mamma called me out to the chi ken
coo? to get the eggs. It was in the morning.
She had not gathered them the night be
fore, so I thought there would be a great
many. I took a little basket and went to each
nest without any success. Then mamma told
me to look behind a large box. I did, and
there was a nest full of eggs, of all colors.
They were pretty. 1 gathered them up and
took them into the bouse. I could not think
â¢^ow they came in that nest and how they
1 could be of so 'many colors. Mamma told me
to crack one. I did not like to break the
pretty shell, but I did, and found it had been
boiled hard. Alter I had done as I wished
with the eggs mamma told me it was Easter
Sunday and explained to mo why eggs were
used on that day in memory of the time when
Christ had risen from the grave. I went to
Sunday-school, too, and heard the preacher
tell all about it. I am g.ad next Sunday is
Easter, because mamma will paint and color
some more eggs and 1 can give them away.
Mamma is going to send a big box of flowers
up to Blue Canyon to my aunty and little
cousins for their Easter greeting. Your Utile
friend, * Chester Gudden.

Dear Editor: This is the third time I have
written to The Call ana I hope this letter will
be published, as my last one was not.
There seemed to be more and more joining
the club every week, so I guess I'll have to be
long, too.
I enjoy my walk to school in the morning
very much, for everything is so lovely now. I
live quite a ways from the schoolhouse, so my
walk is long. We live up in the hills and
have a fine view of the ocean. We have an or
chard and the trees are all in bloom. The
apple blossoms smell very sweet and the ap
pies taste sweet too when they are ripe.

hawk took one of the cute little things yester
day, so now we have only three. I think they
are such pretty birds and they are so easily
tamed. Ours will fly to us when they see us
coming and wilt eat out of our hands. Our
other pet is a big black Newfoundland dog
named Rover. We have taught him to carry
In a stick of wood, always paying him with
some bread. He brings wood iv every day.
Sometimes I get tired of taking it from him
and will pretend not to see him. Tben he
barks and makes as much noise as he can to
attract my attention. He Is a great swimmer
and loves the sport. If we throw a stica into
the water he jumps after it, gets it and brings

to go with us. She Is very fond of Rover and
will rub up against him and purr in a very
friendly way. Your loving reader,

Dear Editor:! have been wishing to be a mem
ber of the C. R. C. I have a dog named Amigo,
which is a Spanish name, and means "frieud."
She is about a year old and can sit on her hind
legs and beg. Sometimes she will beg me to
play with her when she thinks lought to. She
w.ll speak when commanded to do so, and
give me her paw. 1 had a rabbit called Snow
ball, but he died not long ago, and nobody j
knows the cause. The rabbit and the dog were
good friends and used to play together, but the
dog was rough, aud 1 mink she must have
killed bunnie accidentally. Your friend,

Dear Editor: 1 see ihai the *.*. R. C. Club is
increasing and the list oi letter-writers grow
ing longer, and that is just what we wish. I
think Maud Mallory's rhyme was very nice.
I like to read the letter-box, as the letters are
all Interesting. I shall send a story some time.
My naughty little dog ran away yesterday and
my brother has just found him. He followed
a man up to Reservoir Hill and then followed
htm back again. I should have leit sorry if
he had been lost. I live at the Placervllie
park and there is to be horse racing the Ist
and 2d of May. Our school will close in six
weeks. I have about a mile to go to school. It
would not be tad walking if there were not so
many little hills. Wo have been having some
fine weather here for a while. -"'â  . .7. V

Dear Editor : During the last three hot days
I wore my brother's broad hat. I caught a
number of butterflies with my net. 1 caught
some birds in my trap. Among them was a
young canary, but I saw it was going to die, so
I lei it go. I am 9 years old and go to the
Douglass School, and am ln the third grade.
My lather is. building a greenhouse and he
says that he is going to give me a little corner
to plant anything I wish in. He has promised
to make me a big kite 6 feet high, and it Is to
be covered with cloth. 1 like the children's
page aud read it every Sunday morning. Your
loving friend, Gordon Marshall.
Dear Editress : I thank you very much for
making me a member of the C. R. C. I send
the answers io last Sunday's puzzles and also
a charade. I sent you a story a few weeks ago,
and as It was not published I supposed It was
net quite suitable. But people's first stories
usually are not published, and as I am notd s

. The Great Round World, and What Is Going
On In It is a weekly newspaper for boys and
girls, published by William Beverley Harri
son. New York: $_ 50 a year.
This little paper will prove invaluable to
wide-awake boys and girls who wish to keep
well posted and up with the times. Your cdl
tress advises you to send for a sample copy
right away.THE STAGE
"The top ay the mornin' toyez, but sure
an' it's late yer are."
"Arra, go aisy, if yer think yer afier
talkin* the brogue yer wrong, for it's
talkin' thro' ver hat yer are, an' Mr. O'Sul
iivan 'd tell yer so."
This is the style of conversation which
is in vogue at the Tivoli just now. â¢ For
over a week Denis O Sullivan has toiled
through the heat and burden ol the day to
teach the Tivoli company just the right
roll of the tongu-* necessary for making
"Shamus O'Brien" racy of the "ould sod,"
and now success is beginning to crown his
efforts. Even the waiters are saying "be
gorra," instead of "ach" and "Gott in
Himmel." There are rough spots in the
brogue of the chorus here and there, lap
sus lingua? when the American touch of
the banjo in the voice gets the better of
the brogue, and sometimes an Itishman
would not recognize the language as his
own, bur. ti.e principals have become ab
solutely word perfect. An expert would
be deceived into swearing that they were
imported direct from Cork or Limerick.
We have heard a great deal about
"Shamus O'Brien" since it was first pro
duced in London over a year ago. The
work is a. new departure â an Irish opera
written by an Irishman. "The Lily of
Killarne?" is an Irish opera, but Sir Julius
Benedict was lar from being an Irishman.
Balfe and Wallace were Irishmen, but
they sought Bohemian girls and Spanish
gypsies and all sorts of foreigners for their
heroines. Not a custom-house on the
globe would stamp their operas "Made in j
Ireland." When Viliiers Stanford wrote
"Shamus O'Brien" he did one of those
things that make people exclaim after
ward: "Why in the wor.d did no one
think of it before?". He got an Irish plot
and made his music racy of the Irish soil,
just as Chopin made his music racy of
Poland and Grieg is making his music
breathe the airs of Scandinavia, andâ but
their name is legion. Dvorak has tried to
do the same thing for America in his
symphony, "From the New World," but
Dvorak was not "made in America" and
somehow his negroes had a way of whis
tling Bohemian airs when they should
have been teaching DvoraK plantation
melodies. "-â¢â¢- - ;:
There is no doubt about the character
istic quality of the music in "Shamus
O'Brien." One cannot sit through half
aa act of a rehearsal without catching up
tunes that make one think of the songs of
lrelana, and very fine songs they are. I
once knew a musician who was music-mad
on the subject of folk songs. He had
never been in Ireland and had not a drop !
of Irish blood in his veins, so his testi
mony was unbiased, but on their intrinsic
merits he said the folk songs of Ireland
were the finest in the world. He would
sit at the piano and play them for hours,
and when he stopped to rest made such j
remarks as, "The songs of Scotland ! Bah ! j
You like them because you know them. |
The songsof England! Nonsense! Not to f
te corn pared to these. Plantation- melo
dies! Bah! Nonsense! Just listen to this."
and then he would play one of the for- '
gotten songs of Ireland, for, when you
come to think of it, the songs o f Ireland
are practically forgotten. Most people's
ideas of them are confined to Moore's
Irish melodies, Bal.e's "Killarney" and
" above everything else, -.'The Harp That
Once. *
It is the last orchestral rehearsal but
one of "Shamus O'Brien" at the Tivoli,
and the singing and resinging of the
numbers afford a good opportunity of
unraveling the tunes from the very mod
era orchestration of Stanford's opera.
"Let the army come, with its sword and
its gun." sings the chorus. "Ar-r-my,"
yells O'Suliivan jovially. "Ar-r-r-my,"
responds the chorus, with a good ringing
"r" this time that brings a whiff of the
Emerald Ide with it. A minute later the
chorus subsides, and Kitty O'Toole is
singing, "Where is the man that is com
ing to marry me?" and I think of my
friend, the folk-song player. "Where is
the man?" is not one of the melodies that
he used to rave over, but it has all the
characteristics of his pet songs.
Someone remark*,, "O'Suliivan has full
steam on," and that exactly describes the
barytone's condition, which they say is
chronic at rehearsals. Most singers find
that they have enough to do through their
parts, and rest their voices between times,
but O'Suliivan scorns traditions about
resting the voice. He is doing the work !
of stage manager, property man, chorus
master, musical director, brogue instruct- j
or, and operatic hero all rolled into one. j
George Lask's occupation is gone, for he
seems to recognize that 100 many stage
managers would be as bad as too many
cooks. Even Carl Martens conducts with
one eye on the score and the other on
O'Suliivan. When "Shamus O'Brien"
was first produced in London O'Suliivan
sang the title role. He has gone on sing
ing it ever since, and knows every bit of
business and every bar of the music by
heart. As the barytone gets older and
more hardened in stage ways, he will take
more care of his voice and have less over
flowing enthusiasm to spare for the gen
eral production, but just at present he has
thrown himself heart and soul into mak
ing "Shamus O'Brien" a San Francisco
success.
The day is hot, and the rehearsal has
been long and arduous, but no one's en
ergy flags. The musicians. stolidly play
on, scarcely looking up Irom the score,
the principals go through all the dashing i
business of "Shamus O'Brien" air am and I
again, and never seem Â«o grow tired, I
though they have none of the exhilarating j
features of a performance to inspire them. â 
The dark theater yawns like Mn empty j
tomb at their feet, and the brick walls |
stare behind the jumble of scenery on the !
stage. Laura Millard is absent, and her j
part is assumed by George L*rsk, in a white |
sweater and a bown Derby hat. He
won't hear of the British soldiers captur- j
ing Shamus, and pleads "Let me not live j
as his widow forlorn," but the military j
are inexorable, and drag the hero from his [
loving embrace. That is the signal for j
the end of Act I, and the rehearsal is
called off for tbe company to get a mouth
ful of lunch. I ask Sullivan if he is not
worn out, but he responds, "O.i, it's noth
ing when you iike it." HSH
It must take a great deal of liking to
make a man enjoy rehearsing all day and ,
ringing far into the night, as the members
of the company are doing. In pity for
stage-struck boys and girls, managers
ought to admit them to an occasional re
hearsal, io *-_Â«Â»â  them the gingerbread with

Designs on Europe.
Charles Frohman has left for Europe,
where he says it is his intention to push
American plays and American actors.
"I intend," he said before his departure,
"to secure a" theater of my own in Lon
don, and this will enable me to extend the
engagements of the American players I
am g.Â»mg to take over. Among* these I
may mention John Drew, E. H. Sotbern,
Maud Adams, Nat Goodwin. H^nry'Mil
ler, .he Bostonians and Da Wolf Hopper,
all of whom I feel confident will succeed
in Lnidon if properly presented.
"When 1 have a theater in Loudon these
stars can visit England every season.
Until quite recently it was most difficult
to secure a theater in London for Ameri
can plays. An American ; had to stand
around, hat in hand, and after several
weeks of persistent labor, when it was
finally decided to allow him to pay a very
high rental for a theater then closed, he
was expected to look delighted and made
to feet that he had received the height of
hospitality. .
"All this is changed now, and when an
American company presents 'Secret Serv
ice' at the Ade! phi, London, on May 15
the Englis management will not only
participate in the profits or losses of the
venture, but will p-y. their shave of the
expense of the ocea''*trH**Â«i>ora(ion. An I

management will also take a sharing risk
with me.
"Among other home products that I
propo-e to arrange for in London is a new
drama and comedy by Martha Morton;
David Belasco's 'Heart of Maryland,' with
the entire American cast, to be presented
next season; a production of 'Lord Chum
ley'; the farce 'Gambols,' recently
launched successfully at the Irving Place
Theater, and wnich 1 shall do here in
English next autumn. I expect also to
arrange an opening for the Bostonians in
London with 'The Ssrenader**.'
'I anewdea with English authors,
by the way," added Mr. Frohman, "which
not only includes the producing of their
plays In New York, but in their own
country as well. Th- only English attrac
tion that we intend to bring over next
season is George Alexander and bis St.
I James' Theater company, in which theater
John -Drew will play while Mr. Alexander
is here."
pinero's |-leW Play.
From all accounts Pinero's new play,
"The Princess and the Butterfly" or "The
Fantastic s," is not likely to have a much
longer life than Sardou's "Spiritism," and
the rumors are that it will soon be with
drawn from St. James' Theater, London,
where it has received Its first production.
Pinero has tried to combine high comedy
with something like farce. A critic says:
"The sentiment and the action of the first
two acts of "The Princess and the Butterfly'
in no way prepare the audience for wl at
is to follow. These two acts are a wonder
ful, stinging satire upon the society of our
â especially the second act, which
passes at the house of a lady of fashion,
who drops out of the play before . the* real
intrigue begins, leaving an interesting
little story, which has been admirably
conducted, at a most exciting point. Prac
tically, the play is nearly hslf over be;ore it
begins, for it is only in the third act t hat the
affairs of tho .'Princess' and the 'Butterfly'
become of paramount importance. * Then
the fun begins, or, rather, the satire' ends
and the comedy b'gins. , And a very beau
tiful comedy itis. -Nearly all that has gone
before may beViomotten, or remembered
afterward as a satire, studded with in
dividualized types of men and women of
tbe day. Tne young gentleman who brings
mechanical toys to the houses at which
he is a welcome visitor is a rich idea.
The scene in which toys are set working
is comical in Itself; it â is comical, with a
world of meaning underlying the fun for
those who will see below the surface of it;
yet it is utterly disproportionate, not to
its immediate purpose, but to its connec
tion witn the plot. There is too much at
tention to detail, as the play moves tnis
way and- that, and even the coming and
going of the servants, the pulling down
of tbe magnificent blinds, and- trifles of
that sort are carried out with a delibera
tion which is only too much like actual
life. With the; third act the Princess
Pannonia and her friend. Sir George
Lamorant, begin to absorb the interest.
They are both a little too' distressed per
haps at tie approach of middle age. He
is a bachelor of 45, and she is a widow of
40 wno has passed twenty years of her
life as the wife of an elderly valetudi
narian. In a . businesslike way they con
sider the advantage of -marrying one an
other as a protective mea-ure against do
ing anything more foolish "at their time
ofliie." Sir George's offer comes at the
dramatic moment, for the Princess has
just received a proposal of marriage from
a young gentleman in the diplomatic ser
vice. Edward Oriel is many years her
junior, and the ' Princess, who loves him,
means to conquer the passion she feels for
*h" young man. But her, heart overrules
her mind, and in the end she marries her
lover, while Sir George himself is capti
vated by a winsome, roguish young
American-Italian, Fay Zuliani, to whom
he had long considered himself only as a
guardian.

CONSTANTINOPLE OF TO-DAY AND ITS PROBLEMATIC FUTURE
Constantinople, xtith its dramatic past
and its problematic future, is a very inter
esting study at the present time, when
war has just broken out between Moslems
and Christians, with the not remote pos
sibility that the great powers may become
involved in the struggle. Should tlft con
cert ol Europe be broken up, then the rule
of the Sultan at the Golden Horn, whic
rests solely on the diplomacy or the jeal
ousy of the leading nations, would soon
come to an end. an i Constantinople would
pass into the possession of a great civilized
power, with the almost certain prospect
that it would become the leading capital
of the world, perhaps as great in propor
tion to our advanced times as old Rome
was in the height of her glory.
Some of the leading facts of its past and
prophetic intimations of its future can
now be opportunely called to memory.
One of tie most interesting of these pro
phetic intimations of the probable great
ness of its destiny is in the story of the at
tempted bargain between Alexander of
Russia and Napoleon Bonaparte aa to the
partition of the world. The estimate of
the value of Stamboul both by the clear
brain of the would-be world conqueror
and the powerful Czar, who was the most
effectual barrier to tbe French Emperor's
vaulting ambition, is strikingly illus
trated by the offered bargain and Its re
fusal. The Czar promised the Corsican
that he would oppose no hindrance to his
European schemes of aggrandizement
provided only he would let Alexander
have Constantinople. The pros and cons
of the proposition were weighed by ono of
the keenest military brains the world has
ever known, and the answer was an em
phatic no. To the conqueror, who wanted
the most powerful dominion in the world
and who had the capacity to so nearly at
tain it, tbe possession of this strategic
point from which to administer universal
empire promised an advantage to Russia
which outweighed dominion over all the
balance of Europe.
Another intimation of the probability of
its being selected as the capital of one of
tbe greatest of future empires is that it
has been said by high authority in military
science in recent times that the first line
of defense of the Turkish capital, stretch
ing from Lake Derkos to the Sea of Mar
mora, far exceeds that of any capital in
the world. In fact, it is said that this line
of defense, supplemented with a first-class
fleet to guard the Black Sea, would make
WHEN BIRDS BUILD THEIR NESTS IN THE SPRINGTIME
I nailed a knot of bale rope to a shed I
roof yesterday and seated myself by an
open window overlooking the roof to
watch results. It was a windy day and j
the ends of rope flapped in the air and
beat softly against the shingles. I waited j
a long time with no reward for my pa
tience, but at' last a wee lady goldfinch
â¢lighted upon the roof and began bopping j
about tbe rope. Another bird, whom I ]
took to be her mate, perched upon the j
ridgepole close beside her and watched
operations with apparently as much in
terest as I felt. After a careful sutvey the
little hen took hold of one end of the rope
and began to pull at it. It was only by
dint of mucn pecking and working with
bill and claws that she succeeded in sep
arating a single thread of. the tow from
the rest, an-d then she set to work to I
break this. Such a pulling and tugging I
and hopping about to get abetter grip! j
Once or twice she slipped, lost her hold j
and fluttered up into the air to avoid fall- j
ing heels over head.
During the whole performance the male
bird sat upon the ridgepole and sang
blithely, but offered no assistance. Evi
dently he was the ornamental member of
the domestic firm. The little ben seemed
to expect no aid from him. Indeed she
never once looked in his direction, but
when at last she had broken off her bit of
thread from the rope she gave a triumph
ant little "cheep" and the two flew away.
Either they returned again and again or
several pairs of goldfinches visited the
"rope. I think there were at least two pairs,
but in each instance the programme was
very much what I have outlined, the male
bird perching sometimes on the ridge,
again upon a willow branch, and enter

THE ONLY PENSIONER OF WHICH ARIZONA CAN BOAST
Arizona has but one Territorial pen- I
sioner. His name is John D. Dobbs.
At every session of the Legislature |
since 1872 he has been taken care of to the
extent of from $300 to $500 a year. The
last Legislature was no exception, though
some of the ultra-economical statesmen
voted bard and spoke long against the in
justice of this single pension bill. They
urged that it was unfair to pension only
Johnnie Dobbs when there were many
others whose wounds at the bands of tbe
untamed Apache rendered tbem or their
surviving heirs every bit as deserving of
public aid. Bills were introduced for the
relief of several others who suffered from |
Indian depredations, but only Johnnie I
Dobbs' bill was allowed â as it always has
been and ever will be probably until the
end of terrestrial time comes to the soul
of Johnnie Dobbs.
Those who know the story of Johnnie
Dobbs' life and how he gained the scars
which entitle him to legislative relief are
willing enough to believe that if the Leg
islature voted him -$5000 a year, yet tbe
scars were barely paid for and society's
debt to him scarcely requited.
The early part of Johnnies life was
a wild one and the incident at Fort Bowie
on the morning of February 26, 1872,
whereby Johnnies partner lost his life
and Johnnie the use of his two arms for
life was as thrilling as any ever told be
tween the yellow covers of the old Wild
West dime-novel.
Johnnie came into the Governor's office
at Phoenix the other day to get his quar
ter's warrant signed, and when the execu
tive signature had been attached, Johnnie
Btaid awhile and told three or four of us
how he came to earn his pension. Said be:
"Just before the scrimmage at Fort
Bowie, I was driving the mails between
tbat post and Ralston and Tucson. My
last run was from Bowie to San Pedro on
the upper. Tres Alamos. I made this run
several weeks after every other driver on
the road had been killed, and the last day
I came in, dead tired with a twenty-four
hours' trip, the sergeant told to report at
once to Colonel Sumner. I had not seen
bed for t irty-six hours ami I was wet
through with the soft snow tbat had been
falling all day In the mountains. I went'
over to the canteen and got a big swig of
whisky and then reported at headquarters.
"*As soon as you've bad your supper,' ,
Constantinople absolutely impregnable if
boldly guarded by an army of 75,000 men.
Colonel F. V. Greene of the United States
army, who was with the Russian staff in
the Russo-Turkisb war of 1877-78 and made
a thorough study of the strategic possi
bilities, of the lav of the land, and whose
standing is high as an authority in miii
tary science, in bis work on the "Russian
Campaigns in Turkey" gives it as bis judg
ment that the seat of the Ottoman empire
is practically impregnable, if in the hands
of a first-class military and naval power.
But the military advantages of Constan
tinople as a site from whicb to wield do
minion over a large part of the world is
only half of the desirability of the situa
tion. Equally great is its importance as a
center for vast commercial control. No
harbor in the world has such a double
outlet to big areas of productiveness and*
easy acres* to great sea marts. These
waterways east and west are so safe to
friendly vessels and so readily made im
passable to foes that the combination is
unique, and above all others would be the
choice as the vantage point for the future
most universal of commercial empires.
The harbor is almost tide ess, and in
the Golden Horn alone there is safe and
commodious anchorage for 1200 ' ol the
largest vessels, and the mere open space
on the other side of the city is also safe
and deep enough for the heaviest ships.
Promptly from here the great argosies
can pass through . tbe Bospnorus to the
Biack Sea and be in easy contact with a
region which for the wide extent of its
richly productive area is not anywhere
excelled on the globe, or tboy can go
downward through the Dardanelles and
be quickly in the _B*ean and Mediter
ranean seas, where the commerce of
three continents would be gathered close
for them to carry. In time of threatened
danger their refuge is, readily reached,
and so complete as to make assault ab
surd. The foreign navy that entered un
bidden and unwelcome into the Helles
pont when it was properly torpedoed
below and guarded with modern guns
above would simply steam over th. edge
of the universe and drop into the abysses
of chaos. With a great naval power at
Staraboul, the master of that capital
could also be master of the Mediterranean
and control a lion's share of the trade of
Europe, Asia and Africa.
To any nation with the ambition and
capacity for world mastery the glorious
taining his lady with song while she
worked.
A pair of titmice visited the rope soon
after the goldfinches left with their first
thread. These two worked together, each
pulling at its own thread and making a
good deal of twitter over their work. They
were followed by a red-beaded linnet,
wbo was all alone, but evidently about
setting up housekeeping, and he tugged
away at tho rope until he had secured sev
eral of the threads. The linnets seem to
live up to the principle of equal rights,
for males and females. came and went in
dependently, tearing at the rope and
I breaking it off, and I did not see a single
I pair at work together. A male towbee
j bunting flew down to the roof as I watched,
but made no attempt to secure any of the i

| almost immediately and begun pulling at {
I the threads. Ii was interesting to watch j
these two. I do not know if they were a j
pair. The suber-hued hen did not seem
to care about the rope, and after a few j
tentative picks she left t and I
began picking. at some blades
of grass growing in cracks between tbe I
shingles. The other bird did not thrust i
his society upon her. In fact be seemed
: scarcely aware of her presence unless she i
j approached him, when he was instantly j
at attention, wings trailed, head and tail, !
erect, and bill opening and closing rap- '
idly, a perfect picture of gallant courage i
and devotion. She did not seem at all j
impressed, I regret to say, and each time, j
after an indifferent glance, she would j
turn away, and be would immediately as- |
sume an air of intense absorption in some
thing else. There was about the perform- !
ance the same leisurely, quiet courtesy
said Colonel Sumner, 'I want you to go I
down to Doubtful Canyon and bring in
John Reddy, Tom Donovan and Cabias. â 
They've b'-en dead since last night, but I I
d dn't hear of it till an hour ago. I'll |
give you an escort of twenty-five men.'
"Well, that was twenty-four hours more
of riding without sleep, but we went at it.
I was going to tell you what we found
when we got, to Doubtful Canyon, but I j
can't put the thing in words dreadful ar.d j
horrible enough to bring it out like it
really was. * Reddy, Cabias and Donovan
were mail-drivers. Five men on the same
runs had just been killed before them, i
but tbey were plucky boys and had staid |
on just one day too long. The Apaches
had. hacked their bodies in an awful man
ner and had then burnt off their lower
limbs in a big brush fire. One man's I
head was split wide open by a -tomahawk j
and -another was disemboweled. The
buckbcardt were a mass of ruins and all I
the m aii fags bad been slit into ribbons '
and the letters torn to fragments. It was \
the worst scene of butchery and desola- !
tion that I ever viewed, and I had seen j
some years of Indian fighting in the j
country. ' â
"By the time we cot back to Bowie I
had made up my mind to quit the job and
Colonel Sumner hadn't a word to say j
against it. Every time a man went
through Doubtful Canyon . his life was
worth no more than a toss-up. I was a j
young man then, about 23, and wanted to
stay around on earth a few years ' longer.
Well, I drove through that canyon a few j
times more until tbey could get a man to |
take my place and then I went to herding
cattle, for the fort. This was ticklish
business, but a man bad some fighting
show in it. Jack Williams and me took
the contract to bring in the beef. About
the 25th of January, 1872, we started in at
this.
â¢ "We went out and bought the cattle
from Hooker and other cattlemen and
then drove them to tne fort.' We had to
make all our drives at night, and during
the day we lay hidden, for.that part of the j
country' was just swarming with Apaches. !
"We made several successful drives, and
I tell you that each drive we made gave
the troops, food that was- absolutely
needed. â  They could not Lave secured
fresh meat in any other way...

ary we ended another successful drive. We got seventy-nine
head of cattle into the fort without losing a single head.
Just before sunrise
we turned them into
the post corral.
About 9 o'clock in
the morning we took
them out to Bare
Springs to let tbem
browse and water.
Tbis is not more than
half a mile from the
post and we thought
we were safe enough.
We hadn't been in
the arroyo long, how
ever, before I noticed
that the cattle kept
wagging their ears in
a peculiar way and
they refused to feed.
I said to Jack: â
" 'Old man, there's
Injuns about here.'
"He only laughed
and asked me what
put that crazy notion
into my head.
" 'See them cattle,'
I said.
" 'Oh, you're super
stitious, Johnnie,' he
answered, and he laid
back on the sand and
began cutting plug
tobacco for bis pipe.
Well, he never
smoked that pipe

out from Cbicago

that traces birds and reptiles to a common
ancestry. After a few minutes of ibis
neutral defiance they rise in* the air,
I clinch and fight savagely, the little hen
wbo is the cause of hostilities sitting
calmly by to watch the conflict, and, as
; often as not, going off with a third wooer
j when it is over.
It was interesting to note the number
of birds that visited my bit of rope in the
I course of the forenoon. A summer warbler
I carried off several threads to line its
j nest. A white-crowned sparrow secured
I a bit â very much to my surprise, for I nad
| not supposed that this bird would remain
i here during nesting season, lt has been
| my experience, however, tbat the birds
â  seem to feel themselves under no obliga
tions to behave as the books say they do.
. This is especially true of our Californian
j birds, who are possibly not 'up" in the
literature about birds which so many
i bird-lovers have written lately. So I was
I not surprised when, the other day, I saw a
! bluebird with a bit of straw in bis bill, ap
parently busy at nest-building. It is
| asserted of this bird that he never assists
â¢ in the building of the nest, aad it is pos
| sible that this action on the part of my
â  bluebird was the merest specious pretence
of industry.
For all he !s so pugnacious there is no
bird so easily repulsed as the English
saw. But the dog was lying with his nose to the wind and
there was quite a stiff breeze stirring. The cattle were headed
the other way and the
red devils were clos
ing in on ns against
the wind. Of course
I wasn't dead sure
there were any In
dians aboutâ l hardly
tbougi-t tbey would
dare so near the fort
âbut I didn't like the
way those cattle act
ed. I had seen them
act "that way before
wben there had been
trouble, and it's pret
ty safe to bank on
something serious in
the wind when cattle
that have been on the
road all night won't
browse in the morn
ing. So I went up
the side of the cliff
cautiously and l keot
both eyes open for the
barrel of a nun peep
ing out from a rock.
"I hadn't got fifty
feet from where Jack
lay when crack, crack,
crack! went ' a volley
and five buck Apaches
sprang out of the
brush and were danc
ing around Jack Wil
liams before 1 could
fire.
"If I had known
that Jack was killed
by the first volley 1 I
would have bidden
myself: and crawled
back to the post un
der cover. But what
I did was to open fire
on the gang at once
and I winged a couple
of them. I bad some
nerve in : those days
and was as good a
hand with the rifle as
any body in the neigh
borhood. I fired lour
shots and then some
thing struck my left
wrist. It earned own
I sparrow. For several years these birds
have nested in the walls of my bouse,
having their exits and entrances through
â¢undry openings made by woodpeckers.
Early this season, however, I hardened
my heart against them to the extent of
throwing small lumps of earth at them
on several occasions when they ' came
about. They took the hint with aston
ishing quickness. Only one pair seems to
have builded in the old places and their
former homes have passed Into the pos
session of a bevy of wrens and' bluebirds
who keep up a * deal of musical gossip - in
tbe early morning hours.
It seems to me that the songs of the
birds deepen in tone and increase in vol-
I 'ume as tbe season advances. Even the
goldfinches, who early in the spring sang
in tender, hesitant little snatches, now
pour out perfect showers of dainty lyric
as they rush to and fro on their innu
merable important errands. These birds
are among the latest to mate and settle
down. Most of them have already paired,
but even these have not, yet. begun nest
building in earnest, and tbe gay bachelors
are still holding high carnival among the
treetops.
Most of the other birds have already as
sumed family cares. I know where a
score or more of patient little heads peer
above the edges of nests, as faithful little
beauty of the site now occupied by the
sublime Porte would aod much to its at
tractiveness for the building of the grand
est capital the earth has ever seen, and
the glamour of its historic record would
be another teason. Many travelers pro
nounce the grandeur of the scene here to
be beyond any elsewhere to be seen on
the earth's surface, and they say it marks
an epoch in one's life to witness it for the
first time.
The glamour of the historic record of
Constantinople comes largely from the
persistence ofthe empire there. No other ,
city, ancient or modern, anywhere near
equals it iv tbe far stretch of the centuries
during which it has been the capital of an
empire. Fifteen centuries and sixty
seven years is the immense measure. For
more than ten centuries it was a Christian
empire, and the Ottoman empire will
have held sway there on the 29th of this
month for 444 years. Old Rome was not an
empire's capital for one-third of this time.
Twenty-five centuries is Constantinople's
age as a city. For five centuries it was the
most populous and wealthy city in the
world. For eight centuries it successfully
repelled the assaults of immense armies of
every race of people surrounding it, and
conquerors, elsewhere irresistible, with
drew, baffled by its power. For fifteen cen
turies it was a great maritime world mis
tress, and tbe record of such famous com
mercial cities as Venice, Tyre, Carthage,
Alexandria, Genoa and, in lact, all others
is but brief and little by comparison. For
five centuries she was the center of learn
ing, art and general civilization, and .it
was because of her heroic resistance to the
attacks of barbarian hordes during so
many centuries that so many priceless
heritages have been safely banded down to
modern civilization. Since the Emperor
Constantine made it the capital of the
Roman empire in 330 A. D. it has endured
twenty great sieges and only yielded
twice â to the Venetians and Crusaders in
1.04 and to Mohammed II in 1453. Alto
gether the famous city has a record of
hsroism, intellectual energy, skill and
perseverance that counts up an aggregate
surpassing that of any other.
One of the notable things about Con
stantinople historically is tbat one lan
guage, the Greek, bas been continuously
used there for twenty centuries. It has
varied slightly at distant periods, but has
possessed an inherent power to return to
its original purity unknown to other ,
| mothers sit expectantly upon their eggs, {
and here and there beneath the trees tell
tale bits of shell evidence the presence of
young broods bigb up in the branches.
Tbe season is at its height, and -tor
and canyon have tbeir bands full of beauti
ful things for their lovers.' I found the
first Mariposa lilies a few days ago, flutter
ing, like butterflies, in tbe breeze on a
rocky windswept eminence. The soil there
is sparse and stony, but tbe dainty, fairy
like white blossoms flourish in it as though
it were the richest garden loam. Lower
down, where the trail descends into the
wooded canyon, the ceanothis is a mass of
blue blossoming, -and tbe wild columbine
invites tbe climber to almost inaccessible
thickets, wbere its eerie flowers hang just
beyond his reach. The milium is passing,
but the Solomon's seal is still in
its glory, and the big bumble-bees
are gathering rich harvests from the
mints.
There is as much individuality about
insects as there is about biros, and among
none is this more marked thaa among the
bees. Sit down quietly any day among
! the thickly blossoming mints and clover
and watch the bees at work. * The honey
bee gathers from but one sort of flower at
a time, but beyond this s'.ie seems to have
no systematic plan in ber industry. Sbe
flits irom flower to flower sipping daintily
here and there, often returning to a flower
she has just left. But the big bumble-bee
is more sparing of effort. She settles upon
a plant of the mint and makes a circuit of
the minute cups, drinking a sweet drop
from each. It is delightful to watch this
creature feeding. There is something
wholesome and hearty in the way it
grasps a blossom in its strong forefeet,
' fr m the top of the bluff where a buck was i
bidden behind a rock. I a fterward
learned that this was the cousin of Chief
Cochise and he had been sent up there to
pick me off.
"The blood poured ont of my wrist and
it felt numb like. I had two six-shooters
and I began to fire tbem on the crowd be
low, trying to keep out of sight myself by
crouching in the tall brush. But the buck
on top of the bluff could, see me and he
kept up his fire. One ball went into my
left breast, but that didn't seem to hart
me at the time. I kept edging away, but
kept on firing all the time. I guess I had
about two shots left in my last revolver
when something pricked my left elbow.
"Then it was time. to quit. The re
volver fell out of my hand, but my gun
was slung over my shoulder by a strap. I
couldn't use it, however, for both arms
hung helpless.
"By this time the fort had heard the
firing and was getting into action. Boots
and saddles was sounded, but the cavalry
was out for rifle practice, and it took
them some time to reach their horses.
"There was an infantry company at the
post under Colonel Evans, and he got his
men started way ahead of the cavalry.
They came up tome just after 1 crossed
the arroyo. I crossed this within fifty
feet of where Jack Williams lay, and the
Indians dancing all around him and tear
ing off his clothes and hacking up his
body with their knives. They could have
done what they liked with me then, but
they just stood and stared at me as I
shambled by them, the blood spouting
out of both arms arid streaming down my
breast. The buck on the bluff quit firing
as soon as I did and no one offered to
touch me.
"Well, when I saw the infantry coming,
I just fell in a heap, and they packed me
off on a stretcher and set the doctors to
work trying to stop the bleeding. I lost
so mucn blood that my wounds could not
be dressed and the bones adjusted for six
months, and it was not till the following
November that I got out of the Tucson
hospital.',
â¢'But I forgot to tell you abont that

though a slight baldness made it seem so,
and the chin narrow, but square in form.
His hair was thin in front and dark brown,
as was his beard, which was quite long,
but not very thicfc, and arranged witn
neatness and taste.
"His mustache was heavy 'and rather
long. His eyes were very large and of a
light blue; his complexion was pale. As
a speaker his manner was at once incom
parably dignified and graceful. His pos
ture and appearance in repose was impos
ing, not only from the essential grace and
dignity, but from a sense of power they
impressed upon the beholder.
"He spoke as if with but little prepara

which belongs to extemporaneous speak

art of his argument were not felt nntil
yon reflected upon it afterward. He ges
ticulated freely, equally well with both
arms. Nothing could be more beautiful
in its way than was the sweep of his n_ht

Beyond a doubt he was the greatest of

tips it forward and drains the cup.' It
will not leave the head 01" mint until each
flower has been visited, and it will make
no such blunder as to poke its proboscis
twice into the same cup. The butterfly
like the honey-bee flits captiously from
flower to flower. It does not confine its
visits to any one variety, however, but
flutters airily from cream cup to iris, from
iris to mallow or thistle, or even to your
finger if you wet it and hold it up when a
butterfly comes near.
Different from any of these is the
method of that other honey-hunter, the
wasp, a sort of wildcat among insects.
He attacks a blossom as be seems to do
everything in life, with a certain" fierce,
earnest vindictiveness, as though life was"
too brief and full of hardship to admit of
any gentleness or pleasure or beauty. It
is hard to imagine the wasp loving honey,
or knowing that it is sweet. It seems as
though his natural food was gail and bit
terness. Yet what a marvelous thing it
â the intelligence and consciousness,
the recognition that runs through all
these lowly forms of life. I knelt to ex
amine a bumble-bee's nest the other day,
and the insect came buzzing up at once to
inquire my business, and only a few hours
ago I came upon a honey-bee with sticky
legs. It could not free itself from the
bark of tbe tree upon which it had
alighted. I pried the little struggler off
with my pencil and put it on the ledge of
the hive. In less than a minute two other
bees came to its assistance and presently
escorted it within the hive. Could human
fellowship and kindly consciousness do
more than that for a brother who had
fallen upon hard fate and been bruised ?

A prayer which was none the less sin
cere expression of fervent gratitude from
the fac; of its amusing and very definite
and needless allusions to infinite power
was made by a New Hampshire delegate
at a missionary convention some years

After offering thanks for the Lord's

strength and earnestness of purpose in
foreign lands, giving up the ties of home
and all other interests in their devotion to
the cause, he concluded his prayer thus:
"And we thank thee, 0 Lord, for thy

lIWJ^- GEORGE DE LANCEY PEAR
l|^|* SON always paid for his board at
ni^V*^ Mrs. Wilson's fashionable board
i .ig-house with a bad grace and muttered
| imprecations on the scheme of life that
made such a proceeding on his part neces
sary. When the inevitable day on which
he was expected and accustomed to un
loose his purse strings for the benefit of
his landlady came with its provoking
regularity, De Lancey Pearson was ac
customed to arise from his couch in' a
mood that would have done credit to a
hungry grizzly bear, and invariably he
put in a bad day of it from tbe rising of
tbe sun even unto the going down thereof
ami until long thereafter, and all because
be had to nay for the food that kept his
soui and body together, and De Lancey, j
as Mrs. Wilson would avow, seemed to
think that this required a. great de-il of
sustenance.
Every one in the fashionable boarding
house where Da Larcey Pearson lodged,
ireakfastedand dined knew at breakfast
time whether it was his day to pay. beard,
for on that day in the month the man's
temper was simply and unequivocally vile
and his bad humor was certain to show
itself before he had been long at table.
He carried his bad temper on these occa
sions to the oflice where he was employed,
and not being in a position to bully any
one there, he would spend the day in
the snlks. After carrying the amount of
money necessary to pay his board around
with him all day, fondling and smoothing
it and counting it as often as business i
would permit him to, he would go home i
*. in the evening and finally miserably capit
ulate and pay the money into the hands
ef his expectant landlady, with many
grunts and growls and mtuterings, all to
the effect that he was charged an excess
ive price for a very poor article of board. j
To ali these mutterings and imprecations
Mrs. Wilson turned a deaf ear, for Pear- j
son was "sure pay," if he did make a fuss j
bout it, and except for this ono short
coming of his be was really a desirable
boarder.
On each recurring "payday" Pearson
would swear that ho. would change his
boarding-house and find a cheaper place in
stanter. The first time lie di.l this he fright
ened Mrs. Wilson, who thought she was
surely going to lose one of her best-paying
boarders. But Pearson didn't leave then,
nor did he the next time that he made
the same threat, nor the next, nor the
next; and so the landlady got used to his
recurring menaces and ceased to pay any
attention to them.
One payday George de Lancey Pearson
went home in a particularly nasty temper,
and found Mrs. WiÂ«son in tears. Pearson
couldn't believe his eyes. Why shouid the
landlady cry? What reason did she nave
to shed tears? Wasn't sne a gabbling,
grasping wretch, with nothing to do but
to squeeze hard-earned dollars Irom the '
pockets of deserving young men, giving
them nothing but a few mouth of food
daily in return? Huh! She bad nothing
to cry for.
"What's the matter with you, pray?*'
asked Pearson, scathingly.
Mrs. Wilson sniffed and snuffled a few
moments without replying and then man
aged to gasp out: "The house-owner has
raised the the rent!"
Then Pearson showed inst what a brute
he was. He laughed aloud and pranced
around like a jackanapes in bis fiendish j
glee. |
"Raised the rent, has he?" he finally ,'
gasped. "Raised the rent, eh? Ho! ho!
he! he! Raised the rent! Glad of i ! ,
Glad of it, d'ye hear me? Wish he'd
doubled it! Ho! ho! ho! Wish he had
tripled it! D'ye hear? Wish he had
tripled it . Now you know what it is to be
in the bands of a grasping old skinflint,
don't ye? Now it won't be all take and
no give with ye, will it? Oh, no! Ho!
ho! Got to pay out some of your money
now, haven't you? and Pearson again
danced idiotically around the r. om.
"But â but I â l've got â cot to raise â
rave the price of bo â board," sobbed Mrs.
Wilson, as though her heart were break
ing, "and I â l hale to â to ba â have to do â
uoit!
"What!" shrieked Pearson, as he
jurrp-d straight up into the air and came
down with both heels and a resounding
thump. "What! Raise the price of
board? You raise the price of board?
Youâ vou â you â you â Oh-b, this is too
much! Raise the price of board! Ha
ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!" And witb this
mirthless cackle Pearson flopped all of a
heap in a big armchair and gazed crazily
at his landlady.
Mrs. Wilson braced up. "Yrs, ' Mr.
Pearson," said she, calmly enough now;
"the owner of this house has increased
the rent materially, and I will have to in
crease my prices. Your board will here
after be $10 a month more than it is nox*

The tiniest dog in the world is in Vancouver, B. C, the property of R. A. Mustal).
Mr. Musiall c aims that Sir Archibald Maclean's canine, Midget, a picture of which
appears in many American papers, is not the smallest dog in the world, as reported.
The Maclean dog is half an inch larger all around and weighs from appearance many
ounces more."

it! I won't pay it! Here, madam, here!
Here, take this. It's the pay for last
month ! I'm no longer a boarder of yours,
madam! I'm no longer under your roof.
I leave you! I leave you now, madam!"
And, tossing the bank bills he had been
fondling all that miserable day into the
lap of the landlady, Pearson fled from the
house. ,
It was probably an hou- later when j
George de Lancey Pear recovered his I
senses sufficiently to realizs that he was j
rushing along tlie streets with bis hands I
thrust deep into his pockets and his hat
tilted over his eyes, muttering like an
idiot, and generally making a fool of him
self. When this disagreeable intelligence
flashed upon him, he stopped' short, and j
taking off his hat mopped his perspiring
forehead, while the 'cool evening breeze I
fanned his fevered brow.
"Humph!" grunted Pearson, after a
glance around him. He* had walked all
the distance downtown, and was in the
vicinity of the office where he was em
ployed â and he was hungry. Contempla
tion of this latter condition reminded him
that he had quitted his place of board and
must seek another. A pretty task at that
hour of the day I He decided he would
go to a restaurant for dinner and secure a
lodging for the night, and postpone look
ing lor a permanent place of board until
the morrow.
There were a number of first-class res
taurants in the vicinity, but their prices
I were too high to suit the penurious soul
'; of De Lancey Pearson, and he began to
' cast about him for a cheap and unpreten-
I tious place, and finally found one that ;
| seemed to be to bis liking. It was one of j
! those long-named places with tables ranged |
; down one side ol the room and a fly- j
! specked cigar-case end a made-to-order \
j blonde in front, and a blackboard adver
tising "small steak and potatoes 15 cents," I
I etc., on the sidewalk outside the entrance. -
'â  "Table d'hote dinner with wine, 40 cents," j
was conspicuously painted on the window
of the establishment, and it was this
"leader" that caught Pearson.
Pearson endeavored to make himself ;
; believe that he enjoyed the lonely and un- ]
palatable meal, and became so angry with
his inmost self because he was unable to
; convince it that he was really and truly j
happy over his escape from the grasping
power of Mrs. Wilson," that he determined
1 to invest in one of the $10 commutation
tickets advertised- for sale in a footnote
on the menu cards of the establishment
at $$ 50. Here was a chance to economize !
This was the sensible and correct way to
Jive! He wanted to eat what he wanted
and only pay for what he ate! Why had
he so long neglected an opportunity as
this? In contemplating the economy of
this mode of existence Pearson really be
came enthused, and it was with manifest
satisfaction that he pocketed the flimsy
piece of pasteboard the blonde girl gave
him in exchange for $8 50 in coin.
In the conscious pride of the possessor
of a $10 commutation meal licaet, Pear
son sallied forth. from the restaurant and
strolled slowly down the street. He felt
so sslf-complacent and satisfied that he
even invested in a 10-cent cigar. Then it
occurred to him that he had other wort
â¢ before him. He had surrendered his rooms
at Mrs. Wilson's, and it was incumbent
upon him to find other quarters at once
and relieve his. grasping ex-landlady of
â¢ the care of his personal possessions as
: soon as possible.* Three hours later Pear
son and his belongings were safely en
sconced in two "furnished rooms" at the
, . base of Nob Hill. Pearson bad secured I
the rooms at the modest rental of $.*$ a
week, and with his commuter's ticket in
his pocket he felt very well satisfied with
himself and with life in general and bis
scheme of domestic economy in particular, !
But the three days that followed Pear
, son's departure from Mrs. Wilson's were
'â  fraught with awful experiences to him.
On the evening after his purchase of the
commutation, meal ticket Pearson had re
'â  turned to the restaurant where he bougbt
it. He scarcely recognized the place. It
looked dingy. The blonde girl who had
presided at the cigar-stand and punched
meal tickets had disappeared, and in her
place was a large young man with a
. pimply face and a red nose. The white
; table-linen was gone and the eating-tables
j were covered with red cloths thai had
evidently seen better days.
; It The air and appearance of the whole
place was changed and Pearson- would
have believed that he had made a mistake
had it not been for the signs upon the
i window. He pulled himself together and
taking a seat at table ordered his meal. A
slouchy girl served him a cold and sloppy
: lot of stuff he couldn't eat. Sick at heart
I and disgusted Pearson left his unsavory
: meal almost untasted, and grabbing the
check the girl gave him, took it and his
meal ticket to the large, pimply-face
; young man at the cigar-stand. The young
j man looked over the ticket carefully and

then handing 'it back unpuncbed to
Pearson, he asked laconically, "Wat
tell?"*
"Punch what is required out of it," said
Pearson, lofti'y, with a wave of his hand.
'It's a commutation ticket, you know ?"
"Commodation ! You pony up 40
ceuts for this 'ere, then," said the large
i young man. as be glanced at Pearson.
"But, my friend, I bought that ticket
I here last night, and ," Pearson began .
I to explain, when he was cut short by the
I man behind the cigar-case.
"Blast your ticket and hang where you
bought it I This place has -changed hands
an' lam running it, see? An' that paste
board don't go 'ere. You pony up that
j 40 cents or I'll call a cop," and the pimply
ace became frightful in its distortion.
Thoroughly affrighted by the belligerent
attitude of the young man, and even
more by visions of a cell in the City
Prison, Pearson hastened to "pony up"
the forty cents and leave the place. When
he bad put "several blocks between him
self and the large young man De
Lancey stopped. He slowly drew from
his vest pocket the bit o! pasteboard for
which he had paid $8 50. in the name of
economy, and razed at it ruefully.-â¢'Swin
dled!" he muttered to himself, finally.
Pearson dreaded notoriety more than he,
loved money. He knew that he "might;
succeed in having some one punished for
the traud .perpetrated upon him, but be
abandoned the idea of doing this as soon
as it suggested itself, and did exactly as
the swindlers figured on their victim's
doing â pocketed his loss and swallowed
i his chagrin.
Sore at heart and feeling like a wan
| derer on the face of the earth Pearson
â  sought his lonely lodgings. No bright
! fire such as he had been accustomed to
I find awaiting him in his rooms at Mrs.
| Wilson's sparkled and crackled in the
i grate; the servants had not so much as
J lighted his gas, and his rooma were dark,
I cold and cheerless. If such a thing had
: happened to him at Mrs. Wilson's Pear
j son would have torn and snorted about
I the house like a madman, but a change
had come over De Lancey. All bis ob-
I steperousness was gone, and he no longer
' had heart left to kick. He sank deject
i edly into an armchair that stood mock
' ingly before the tireless grate, and gazed
1 moodily into tbe bed of cold ashes. Shiv-
I ering, hungry and utterly miserable Pear
j son finally crept away to bed to be further
! chilled by the clammy, unaired sheets.
Pearson looked up a new restaurant at
i which to breakfast the next morning, and
found a place he thought exactly to his
I liking. It was presided over by a widow,
and was a marvel of neatness. The cuisine
was splendid and the service could not have
been better. Pearson was delighted, and
i in the enjoyment of the excellent break
| fast that was served turn he forgot his
j troubles and his disagreeable expeiiences
; ana his heart warmed within him again.
â  So "Pleased was De Lancey with this model
I restaurant thai he had so luckily, he said
Ito himself, stumbled upon, tbat he
I promptly purchased a $0 commutation
i ticket for $5 when the buxom widow at
j the cashier's desk offered him one. * ../
It was with the most delightful anticipa
tions that Pearson wended his way to bis
little bijou, restaurant for. dinner that
evening. He was enthusiastic on the sub
ject of "his discovery." as he elected to
term the cafe. So pleased was he with it,
: that he ding-donged its praises. into the
ears of his fellow clerks all day and wound
I up by asking two of them to. dine with
hint at "his discovery" the following
I Sunday. So it was with a light heart and
'â  a hearty appetite that Pearson took his
way to the restaurant and as he fondly
believed â to dinner. Finally he reached
l the cafe and instantly all his blithe spiriis
i fled. The place was closed and evidently
I deserted. The window shades were drawn
and not a glimmer of light came throti gh
the crevices from within. A hasp had
i been roughly fastened to the doors and
they were secured with a padlock. Below
this was a slip, of paper on which was
' written the words, "Closed by the Sheriff,
and beneath this was a long legal docu
ment with ali the blanks filled in.
It was the last straw! Pearson deliber
ately read the legal notice reciting the
woes of the buxom widow wno bad that
morning so nonchalantly sold him a
worthless piece of pasteboard for $5.
i Then he turned and blinked solemnly at
I the electric-light on the street corner for
a few minutes, while he seemed lost in
; thought. Then be boarded an uptown car
and went to Mrs. Wilson's. He was clos
; eted with his former landlady for a half
; hour in the cozy little den she called "the
office." What he confessed to her, what
promises he made and what she said to
! him will probably remain locked forever
J in their own breasts; but when Pearson
came out into the main parlor at the end
; of thirty minutes he looked meek but
j serenely happy, and that night ne was

STRANGEST OP TOMBS.
Erected by a Roumanian J Profesaro j
Over the Uody of liii Daughter.
Bucharest has perhaps the strangest j
tomb ever erected in a civilized land. Itj
stands over the embalmed body of Julia ]
Hasden, a young authoress who died six i
years a o. Her father, Profe-sor Hasden.
of the University of Bucharest, believes he
is able to communicate with his lost child.
He sits every day for hours by the side of !
her coffin, and occasionally surprises his j
fellow-scientists by gravely quoting some, j
remark that she has made to him.
The tomb is consti ucleu, so it is claimed,
in accordance with plans outlined to the j
lather by the daughter after her death. It :
Is in the Greek cemetery. The structure is
of marble. Over the entrance and under
the name "Julia Hasden" is a niche filled
with her well-worn school books. As one
enters he is greeted by strains of unearthly
melody. At the entrance a huge slab of
black marble bears an inscription which
may be translated as follows: "Let those
who seek not knowledge pass by this
grave, but those who fain would learn the
secret of life in death descend !"
The vault is paved with black and white
marble. Its walls are or the purest white
marble, with inscriptions in letters of goi I.
Tbese, according to Professor Hasden, are
remarks culled from the conversations he
has bad witb bis daughter, since her death.
Here and there are quaint little triangular
stools. Close to the stairway stand two
handsomely decorated mirrors, which
formerly adorned Julia Hasden'a boudoir.
At the further end of the vault, behind a
white marble balustrade, is an exquisitely
carved sarcophagus containing the body
of the young girl. The coffin is so ar
ranged that by drawing' back a slide the
broken-hearted parents may still gaze on
the face of their cbild. Two colored lamps
burn continually at- either end of the
sarcophagus. , < .iV'.;. â¢;". H~._ '.*.;;"â¢*,;â¢..'
In the center of the balustrade stands a
beautiful bust of the young Roumanian
woman. It represents her as a handsome,
clever-lookine girl, attired in* modern
evening dress. A. white veil is drawn
over it to preserve it from, tbe dust,. and
at the waist nestle a few faded roses, held
in place by long satin ribbons that float to
J the ground. They are the flowers ami
I ribbons which Julia Hasden' wore at the
last ball.
On the walls hang photographs of her
jat various ages. One small water color
j sketch, entitled "Son Dernier Jour Ter
reste" (her last day on eartb), represents
I her tossing on her deathbed, with feverish j
! cheeks and sunken eyes.
On the table to the right lies a large
! album, a few books and a block of black
I marble, on which some iines of music are !
' engraved in gold; the title tells you they :
i form "a melody," composed by Julia Has
den after her death, and listening to its I
mysterious tones one could almost believe :
it an echo from spiritland.
The mechanism that produces the weird
music above mentioned is apparently con- I
cealed in the table. Visitors are per
mitted to inscribe their names in the great
album, and Us pages are full of touch
ing expressions of sympathy in every lan- '
guage.
There is nothing grewsome in this re- 'â¢
markable tomb; the fresh air streams in -
| through the open doors, carrying with it !
I the perfume of flowers and the merry '-
| song of the birds without.
Here it is that Professor Hasden passes i
I almost all his spare time; it is no strange
| thing to see him taking his coffee here of !
> a morning and smoking his cigarette be-
I side his child's coffin. His wife comes in
I the afternoon and remains until late in '
j evening. afc-g-l
"She a seldom alone," the old porter at |
the gate will tell you (he speaks of Julia '
Hasden as though she were alive). "Poor j
folks, it's a comfort to them and it don't ,
| harm us. People's given up remarking on
it long ago." it ii generally believed lin
Bucharest that Professor Hasden's mind'
jis deranged on spiritualism. On all other
j matters it is as strong as ever. â New York :

MAN AND DOG FROM YUMA
C^LWO of the most notable figures in
vl V" Arizona's nineteenth legislative
-J-Â»r* assembly have been the man from
-Yuma and the dog from Yuma. Both
have attended every session promptly and
regularly. Both are peculiar and distinc
tive characters in their way.
The man is the best parliamentarian in
tbe Treasure Territory. The oog is the
only one in the Territory who may boast
of having on numerous occasions occu
pied a berth in a Pullman palace car. The
man's name is J. H. Carpenter, familiarly
known and famous all over the Territory
as just plain "Carp." The dog's name is
Carlo, tut he has been dubbed the "Legis
lative Brown Pup."
Carpenter represents Yuma County in
the Senate, and Carlo represents Carpen
ter anywhere and everywhere. If you see
the dog in the street you know at once
and infallibly that Carpenter is not more
than twenty feet away. And the memory
of the oldest inhabitant scarcely reaches
to the time when Carpenter went abroad
unattended by Carlo.
Carlo is a well- bred, dignified beast,
whose father was a water spaniel and
whose mother had the unadulterated
blood of the Scotch collie in her veins.
The mixture makes almost a distinctive
breed, and altogether a fine-looking, in
telligent dog.
Either the" man or the. dog separately
are interesting characters. Carpenter has
served in five of Arizona's nineteen legis
lative assemblies. He was chief .clem of
the Senate in the twelfth, assistant chief
clerk of the House in the thirteenth, chief
clerk of the Senate of the fifteenth,
Speaker of the House of the eighteenth,
and member of the Senate of. the nine
teenth, tbe one that has just adjourned.
Out of all this wealth of legislative ex
perience Carpenter has profited immense
ly. He is keen-witted in debate, quick as
lightning in his parliamentary rulings
when in the chair, and on the floor a
most dangerous foe to any measure, no
matter how strong tbe vote against him
may be. His successful battles against
the removal of the Territorial penitentiary
from Yuma â a measure that ail the coun
ties except two and nine-tenths of all the
taxpayers most heartily desire â have been
lasting monuments to his fame as a par
liamentarian.
During the eighteenth, while Speaker
of tho House, he adjourned the Assembly
sine die, though the appropriation bill
had not been passed, in order to defeat
the prison-removal bill in the interests of
his own constituency. Only a few days
before the nineteenth adjourned he again
defeated prison removal by his parlia
j mentary keenness. At one point the
i battle was almost lost, for the prison
| removal men had the necessary votes to
! carry the day. Only delay could save the
cause cf Yuma. The bill was before the
House, lying on tho clerk's desk, with
only one or two minor measures ahead of
it. This was early in tho morning, and
had things gone in their regular order the
bill could have been engrossed and passed
I before the afternoon adjournment.
Suddenly Carpenter moved to take up
the "regular order of business. The motion
I was redundant, superfluous and unneces
j sary, yet technically correct. The prison
removal men looked at each other ques
tioningiy. â¢ What did it .meanâ this new
I move of Carpenter's?
â  He gave them no time for reflection,
| however, and insisted upon his motion
being put. President Hughes, who is a
' Tucson man and therefore a friend indeed
of Yuma, was quick to see the gist of
things. . -:*â ".â¢ z'fihu '.
Th-*- prison-removal . men voted "no"
solidly, just because the motion was made
j by Carpenter and tbey were afraid of it.
! Result: They had voted not to consider
i their own measure, and now it must lie
over till afternoon, ln very chagrin the
Navajo man moved to adjourn sine die,
and only the fact tbat the appropriation
bill had not yet been passed prevented
| the measure from carrying. â¢ : Jy -.
It was openly conceded that Carpenter
j had "Aim flammed" them. But Carpen
, ter is always right in his parliamentary
' tactics, always safe within the rules, and
j his own foes do not accuse him of more
I cleverness than the minority always has
j the right to exerciseâ if it has the knowl
j edge and the wit to do it.
Carpenter was once secretary or the
Merchants' Exchange in San Francisco.
He has studied law, but is not a lawyer,
and is now the superiutendant of the Col
| orado River Irrigation Company. So
> much for the man.
Now about the dog. Cario is 9 years
â¢ old and has attended three sessions of the
j Legislature. The most wonderful thing
about him is his ponderous and pompous !
j dignity. Most dogs act like dogs when
' out of doors, if at no other time, but Carlo
i is always a fastidious and circumspect in
j dividual. He does not make friends with
other dogs readily, and you must be
be surprised. The good people had long
grown used to Jerry, but to see him arm
in-arm with his doubleâ well, that was
another matter.
J.s, So the people stared and stared. . Then
1 formally introduced to him by the "gen
tleman from Yuma" before be will take
j you into his confidence to the extent of
even exchanging caresses.
When the Senate is in session Carlo lies
at the side of the Yuma desk, or possibly
upon it. ' Sometimes when there is a lull
In the proceedings Carlo will wander
around the room a little and pay his re
spects to his fellow members. But . if
Carpenter snaps his thumb aud second
finger instanter Carlo returns and re
sumes his place beside the Yuma desk.
During rollcall and reading of the journal
in the morning hour Carlo invariably
makes the round ot the Senate chamber.
Ho goes directly to the president's chair
first, receives a nod or a pat of recogni
tion, rubs his nose friendly against the
president's hand, then walks down, very
quietiy and with great dignity, to the
Gila member's desk. In turn he goes to j
each desk, exchanges "good mornings,"
and then takes up his seat beside Car
penter. â¢ *â¢ -{ -'-'A*
It is Carlo who is first to notify the As
sembly, tbat the Senate has adjotirned.
The two branches of the Legislature meet
In adjoining halls, with heavy swinging
doors between them. If at any time dur
ing the day the memrjers of the Assembly
see a big brown curly dog push his way
through tbe deor and walk over to the I
Speaker's chair, everybody knows that the !
Senate has taken a recess. And until
"Carp's" dog appears everybody knows
that the Senate is still in session.
Carlo has no frivolous ways about him.
No one ever saw him run â at least not in
Phoenix. He walks quietly side by side
with Carpenter, and when Carpenter
"meets a man" and stops to talk the
"brown pup" halts also.
When at Yuma sometimes Carpenter
leaves Carlo at home for a day or two i
while be takes a flyin**; trip to Lis An
geles. This occurs but rarely, but when it
does Carlo goes down to meet every in
coming train. There are two trains a day
at Yuma â one east and one west â and of
course the whistle blows as the train nears
the town. Carlo's home is at some dis
tance from the depot, but the dog always
gets there first, and this is probably the
only time he ever loses his dignity long
enough to travel at an undignified pace.
Carlo has a profound contempt for lob
byists and members of the third house.
He never notices such ordinary indi
viduals unless formally introduced by
Carpenter. As a rule he associates only
with members of the Senate, but at long
intervals he takes a quiet stroll through
the Assembly and sneaks to those witn
whom he is acquainted.
If Carpenter goes to church Carlo goes
to church, and on the same day and in
the same churcb. If Carpenter attends a
caucus Carlo coes the same. He is safe
and will reveal no state secrets. Doubt
less he has a great many of tbem locked
up in his wise old head, but he never
breathes a word.
Yet he talks quite plainly and intelli
gently and nods long conversations with
his master at. odd times. He does not
perform any â such procedure would
be entirely beneath bis dignity. He is as
well known in Ariz ma as Carpenter and
Carpenter is probably the best known of
the young men of the Territory.
Carlo 'has traveled ail over this section
of the country with Carpenter and by all
kinds Of conveyance. He is as familiar
with the interior of Pullman 'palace cars
as other dogs are with their kennels, for
Carpenter's duties make him a constant
traveler, and Carlo is his constant com
panion.
There is really something very pretty in
the friendship and understanding uetween
these two individuals, and everybody in
the Territory likes Carlo almost as well as
Carpenter and Carlo is welcome wherever
Carpenter goes. For Carlo is never a dog
out of place wherever he may be. He is
never officious, never troublesome. You
must speak to him first or he will prob
ably pass you by unnoticed. He is one
dog in a million and probably the only
canine member of a legislative assembly
in the Nation. The claim is made for
him, too, that he is the only dog who has
ever ridden in a Pullman car.

"That these women can be the widows
of Revolutionary soldiers is readily under
stood in view of the fact that their hus
bands were well on in years when they
married.. As, for example, when Esther
Sumner married Noah Damon in the year
1835â filt> -two years after the close of the
warâ she was but 21, while be was Tli. The
last Revolutionary pensioner who had
married prior to the close of the. war, and
had therefore actually lived during Revo

of Daniel F. Bakeman. She died about
twenty-seven years ago, only a year or

AN ANTI- JOHNNY BILL.
Mr. Sin It ha on' Measure for the Protec
: tion of Young "Woman "Students.:
Mr. Smithson has introduced a bill in
the Senate with this caption: "An act
for the protection of boarding-schools for
females, and principals and inmates
thereof."
It will be seen at once that Mr. Smith
son is aiming at an evil that principals
and patrons of female schools have dis
cussed thousands of times, and have often
taken precautionary measures against
with but poor avail. In short words, he is
aiming at that class of '"Johnnies" whose
laces, wreathed with tempting smiles, are
often seen in the neighborhood of schools
for young girls. Thereiore he gives warn
ing to ail such classes that they will have
something worse thau the barking dogs,
which betray their lurking presence, to
dread in the futureâ a statute making the
offense a misdemeanor.
Mr. Smitbson's bill says it shall be un
lawful for any persons to linger on the
street, alley, road or byway near a school
for females, and that they shall not hold
any communication, either in words or
signs, with any of the inmates of such
colleges. In passing the institution they
shall not linger or lurk near trying
to communicate with any one on the in
side, and no one will be allowed to speak
to a pupil without express permission
from the principal.
If in any way the inmates of a scaool
are annoyed by billet doux of any kind
tbe offender will be guilty of a misde
meanor. The owner or the property or
the principal of the school will have re
course to the law in all cases where per
sons linger around the school.
Mr. Smithson is not a moralist, but he is
aware of the capers that have been cut by
boys in the neighborhood of more than onÂ«
female collage in Tenne-see. Mr. Smith
son said, referring to a certain female col
lage in this State: .
- . "There is a class of boys who have made
themselves notorious by their capors
around this college. The girls are wor
ried to death by letters and all other kinds
of communications. The boys pass up
and down in front of the college and use
their handkerchiefs as a! means for flirta
i tion with the girls. The girls cannot go
i out on the streets without being accosted
! by all sorts of handKerchief and glove
! flirtation signs, and often the boys speak
1 to them. Tho principal has been worried
; out of bis wits almost, but there is no way
; to stop ft. ;â¢.",' '-*7 â .:;"..-..**.â  ,*-/!
"Even in the churches on Sunday the
boys will try to flirt with the college girls.
i The ag. ravation has passed standing any
'. longer, and there must be a law to protect
! the girls and 1 the colleges. This sort of
conduct does not happen only at the col
! lege I sper.k of, but almost every female
school is bothered by the Johnny class."

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
Once upon a time a poet wrote about a I
maiden who "wore a wreath of roses in j
her hair," but I wonder what he wouid j
have written could he have seen the fair
belles and matrons this season. Indeed, 1
fancy he would have been distracted and ;
quite unable to have produced even a
rhyme, as a simple wreath of roses would
be scornfully derided by most of them.
But in spite of many fearful and wonder
ful combinations how perfectly lovely are
many of the chapeaux; how well tbey
suit the bright winsome faces that smile,
dimple and blush beneath their hues.
And the gowns! Truly never have they
been quite so chic, charming and capri
cious in fabrics and designs.
It is a fact no longer disputed that our
women impart a certain individual and
delightful air to their simplest garments,
and an intangible something ttiat the
French women lack, for the principal
dressmakers and milliners in this country
find that our leaders of fashion demand a
certain toning down of the colors and a
modification of styles that does credit to
their artistic development and their sense
of the beautiful.
How gayly Easter week has passed. The
luncheons, card parties, dinners and the
Oakland masked ball have been each and
every one quite delightful, and almost
with reluctance are many planning to
leave shortly for the mountains and sea
side, out as our summer winds increase in
violence the exodus will begin. However
the June weddings are to be numerous,
and many will tarry yet awhile, for the
summer wardrobes are as yet incomplete,
and, when the latest engagements are not
under discussion, endless are ihe remarks
made and the questions asked concerning
hats, ribbons and flowers, fabrics, laces,
frills and shirring, so I present you with
what I have
Culled From .Many Sources.
A Parisian dress that will be seen at
Newport this summer is of handsome
black Chantilly lace over lettuce green
silk. The bodice has a special cachet
because of its having a mousseline de soie
blouse between the lace and the silk.
Very odd is the deep collar of black satin
that extends down the back in three long
narrow points. Black satin also encircles
the waist Tr.e chapeau is a marvel of
lace and black feathers, with a touch of
green.
Watered silk upon a tiny check will be
one of the favorite materials all season for
the fashionable fancy bodices. One beau
tiful model bodice just created is of
Parma velvet. The front, of accordion
pleated mousseline de soie, is sewed over
mauve silk, and a cascade of lace falls
like a cloud over the vaporous chemisette.
The throat and waist are finished with a
pleated band of velvet of a darker
shade.
Lovely is a crepe de chine from a well
known house. It is silvery gray; the
skirt is --oft and clinging; is trimmed
with a wide flounce edged with guipure
over rose silk, and the vest carries out tbe
same idea, the lining throughout being of
rose taffeta glace. With it goes a white
and pink toque, from which spring two
sprightly black ostrich tips; white gloves
and a parasol of heavy lace over pink silk
completes a chic toilet.
Extremely attractive is a perfectly plain
dress of light -rray cloth for a young girl.
It has a large square collar reaching to the
bust and crossing, hemmed with white
cloth. This is made in the Russian blouse

style and overhangs a silver belt at tbe
back and at the front. The bishop sleeves
are gathered into cuffs. Such blouses are
at the present moment much worn in
Paris by slender young maidens with
good figures, small waists and rather nar
row hips.
One just noted of white cloth has quite
an elaborate trimming ot galoon, which
is traced in many shades of red, blue and
green. With it is worn a gold belt,
studded with enamels In different colors,
and at the neck it fastens with a large bow
of white chiffon, and this reminds me
thai you should all know that elaborate
ruchings, fussy bows, etc., about the throat
are entirely out of date, the fashion hav
ing been made utterly ridiculous by the

numerous absurd exaggeration** indulged ]

if you would not be utterly out of style
and odd looking.
Lace.
The fact that lace is an important item
is evident to every one who bestows
even the smallest amount of attention on
her wardrobe â for there is scarcely
a dress complete without a small piece
being used somewhere. For example, a
smart lace cravat is quite the thing to
wear with the severest of tailor gowns.
This may be made of maltese lace,
mounted on white tulle, and wonderful

dulged in you will find it quite a consid
erable item of expense.
Many old Caiifornians own goodly stores
of choice and costly laces. Indeed I have
seen here some of the rarest old rose point,
not just a yard or two, but great flounces,
sufficient to cover elaborately an entire
skirt. Such lace might grace the trous
seau of a Princess. And another matron
owns a precious fan of old point de
Veriise â just such cobwebby wonders
we can understand the old Venetians
covering with gold pieces so as to se
cure it.
Strange is it not the air imparted by
even a few inches of rare yellowish lace.
I never tbink of a dear old grandmother
I without picturing her with a lot of lace
here and there. Indeed the woman who
cannot understand what there is to ad
mire about lace I should avoid, as her
higher sensibilities must be in truth dull
and lacking in cultivation.
Now, since we must use cheaper weaves
let us employ them with circumspection,
using them only when unavoidable in in
conspicuous ways. Great collars, etc., of
imitation laces are never indulged in by
smart women, they considering a few
yards of choice lace far preferable, and in
many instances ribbons, especially the
narrow baby velvet ribbon, is all-sufficient
trimming. But do not imagine that one
or two bolts (a I olt contains nearly ten
yards) will be sullicient, for nearly fifty
yards have been used on a simple little
India silk which I have just received from
my dressmaker, and all of it. with the ex
ception of ten yards, is on the waist. So
i you can readily comprehend how the New
i York dressmakers can consume such vast
i quantities, for numerous are the ruffles
that beautify the skirts of the summer
girl, and on each ami every one, if velvet
is utilized, must be three rows. As a nat
ural result of this fashion being popular,
tbe manufacturers are utterly unable to
meet the demands made upon them, and
so our stores have not a full line of colors.
Green seems to be in the greatest favor,
and if you want to obtain a novel effect
nave this velvet used instead of braid on
a white vest, and if you select the correct !
color the result will be extremely chic.
< Foulards.
Numberless are the questions I have
been asked concerning foulards, and I can
only say I am very thankful that I did
not indulge in a dark blue one with a
white figure, for exactly the same designs
are shown in calicos, lawns and organdies;
as a result they are going to be. to say the
least, excessively ordinary. However, my
remark docs not include all foulards, for
>ome of them are delightfully pretty and
inexpensive, but those calculated to excite
admiration are invariably the work of
first-class dressmakers, who handle these
goods with as much care as though they
were designing frocks of costly satins and
brocades, but such fabrics must have im
parled to them a certain indescribable art
or they had best be promptly consigned
to the ragbag.
Tea Gowns
Are now such elaborate, complicated
creations that no longer are they regarded
by even the most fastidious of men with
disapproval, for no more are they classi
fied with the untidy "Mother Hubbards"
or the nondescript "morning wrappers,"
so now and then I feel called upon to re
late the charms of some of these confec- i
tions, since Worth, Paquin and many
other artists consider them worthy of I
their serious thought and most artistic '
exertions.
We may replace the afternoon cup of |
tea during the summer months by some I
more cooling drink, just as the gowns < f |
rich and heavy silk or cloth now give way
to airy fabrics that look as though woven
by the fairies' fingers out of moonbeams,
cobweb*", dewdrops and such flowers as
Queen Titania twists into marvelous
garlands for her hair.
Positively 1 feel my inability to do jus
tice to some of the tea gowns which will
1 shortly be worn by a dainty bride who has
a. ways been noted for her exquisite taste.
I However, I can give you some idea ol
j two â one of lettuce green, the other of
i cerise taffeta and white crepe. The foun
! dation of the first is built of lettuce
! colored taffeta silk, shaded with a silvery
j white. Over this is tbe sheerest of French
j organdy, covered yes, encrusteu â with
real Valenciennes lace and insertion. This
lace edges a deep frill that extends around
the bottom. It has three rows of one
j inch-wide insertion.
Down the sides are five insertions, which
are bordered on eitber side with tiny lace
frills. The body of the gown is a mass of
I lace and insertion, and the deep-rolling
i collar is most becoming to. the round
I white throat. A great bow of taffeta ties
! in the back. Now do not exclaim over
j the extravagance of . such a gown. To be
1 sure the money spent on the lace alone
THE LATEST IN SMART BLOUSES.
A foundation waist of blue silk is covered with an open-work embroidery of grass lawn, the
soft fullness drawn Into a waistband of blue silk, tied at the left side into a big bow. The
sleeves are absolutely tight from waist to shoulder, where they are finished with a chiff n
raffle, matching in color the grass lawn. To compensate for the plain sleeves this blouse ha

would make many feel called upon to ex- -
press their views on the subject, and the J
exquisite needlework kept one woman j
busy for neariy a month. Indeed this ;
year expert needlewomen will certainly
be at a premium, as never since the in- |
vention of the sewing machine has there
been such a demand for fine hand work, |
as innumerable are the garments and
dresses that must be made without the
aid of our machines, and the French bead- !
ings that must be let in, with the inser
tions, give an incredible amount of work.
There is a decided tendency to return to ;
the shapeless sleeves which years ago '
were in fashion â they have only a seam
inside the arm. Such sleeves usually
have Insertion let in perpendicularly or
diagonally. The pagoda sleeve is worn â
it is drawn into a band above the wrist
with a frill beyond.
The cerise costume is completely veiled
with an ex-uisite white china crepe,
which has a square yoke, tbe threads of
which appear to have been drawn, and
lines upon lines of hemstitching permit
us to see through the fine meshes the
bright-hued silk that lends a rosy hue to
the softly falling folds of crepe. The
sleeves are wrinkled, a la mousqnetaire,
and are finished, as is the yoke, with a
i v t
soft fail of lace. Otherwise the gown is
unadorned; but the foundation slip has
three ruffles edged with cream white lace.
Encircling the slender waist is a band of
cerise velvet, which terminates in the
back in a short and frisk bow. A delicious
gown, is it not? The cut is strictly
princess âa style far from becoming to any
but slender, graceful figures; but I can
quite distinctly hear some of my readers
say, "Such materials are quite too costly
for us. Do tell .us about simpler
things." ':.-.- -Vi :-*.â¢'â .
Well, for instance, take an evening
dress that is no longer fit for active ser
vice, rip it np, have it cleaned by a thor
oughly responsible man, and on its re
turn home see whether it will not make a
satisfactory foundation for a pretty or
gandy; say it is an old lavender silk; if
you are slim have it cut princess; if plump
have a five-gored skirt and a smart tea
jacket. I have just seen one made in this
way: The silk, lavender in color, was o
t
surah, and therefore had a lining, so as to
give it sufficient body ; round tbe bottom
was a six- inch wide ruffle-edged and bro
caded with a cheap but good imitation
Valenciennes lace; over this fell a skirt of
pure white organdy, with wide stripes of
lilacs separated from one another by half
inch stripes cf vivid green. The skirt had
three lace-edged frills, and the jacket was
cut like a little coat. A deep rolling collar
finished with lace was effective, as were
the elbow sleeves. ''.â¢'"Â»â¢
The vest over lavender silk was of alter
nate rows of green ribbon and white in
sertion.
If you have not a silk foundation you
will be charmed to discover as 1 have just
done how very nicely the lawns now* so
extensively used will answer your purpose,
but if you have limited means and require
cool, light garments remember that the
charm of such simple things consists in
their perfect freshness, so if economical
ideas must prevail let me advocate white
in preference to colored organdies, etc., as
even when handled with the greatest care
how transitory they are.
India silk may likewise be employed
with the happiest results, as many cf even
the most inexpensive wash perfectly, and
certainly they hang artistically about the
figure. /.-

It falls gracefully from a yoke of creamy
ecru guipure of a heavy quality, cut
square so as to reveal a pretty throat. It
also forms a sort of little cap for the
sleeves, wnich wrinkle softly to the wrists.
In color the silk is of a vivid serpent

are two lace-edged ruffles of creamy white
silk. You can understand how well this

For Men.
The best turned-out men arc wearing to
their offices singlo or double breasted sack
suits. If you prefer the single-breasted
style your entire suit may be of the same
fabric; a quiet, serviceable plaid will rove
most satisfactory. However, in case a
double-breasted coat suits you better order
a blue or black one. Yon may have t c
trousers match, but most prefer to have
fancy trousers. *'-':-
The covert coat and sack suit go well
together, and such coats are being cut
with full, loose back. Complete your
morning costume with either a derby or a
soft Hamburg bat, a madras or cheviot
shirt (striped effects are considered smart,
as are also checks) and a rumchunda tie
of the butterfly pattern, wnich is made
especially to wear with a high banded
turn-down collar of white linen, for if you
wear a standing collar a tie or four-in
hand is appropriate.
Your glove should be either heavy dog
skins or tan-colored suedes. The dog
skins are best liked, and either russet or
calf shoes are correct, but no longer are
tbey to be shined; they may be polished
only, shiny shoes being considered hor
ribly bad form in New York. Men may now
exhibit much originality in the selection of
their shirts, cravats and waistcoats, for
many are the colors and combinations
offered, but the popularity of fancy waist
coats will indeed be short lived unless
care is taken to avoid loud colors, and re
member ihat it is extremely bad taste to
wear one that does not harmonize with
your suit.
Concerning waistcoats Him writes:
"The tailors on the avenue are still agi
tating fancy waistcoats. They have
brought out special vests tor golf, wheel
ing, riding, driving, business and full
dress. For golf and cycling the cloths
used aie rather loud * flannels. These
fabrics are, made up into single-breasted
waistcoats, with large oval or round bone
buttons and flap pockets. The riding
waistcoat is made single-breasted, of buff
or scarlet cloth. The formal waistcoats
for wear with the Albert coat are made of
fine silk Bedford cord, overshot with wee
silk dots of blue or bright sell-tones on
buff. Worsteds are also used, the favorite
shades being cadet, slate and tan. 'â 'â¢:
How to dress on board a yacht is not
understood by some, so let me inform
you that if you desire to be well turned
out you must wear a blue serge coat â a
double-breasted one. fastened with three
large black club buttons â a white vest,
which may be eitber single or double
breasted ; white linen duck trousers, turned
up at tbe bottom ; white shoes with rub
ber soles, and your cap should have a
patent leather peak and black soutache
band. Your shirt may be either of flan
nel or madras, made with a white collar,
and a rumchunda tie. Never make the
mistake of wearing ordinary shoes.

Glub System of Whist, play.
Every organized whist club should have a
recognized system of whist play." We do not
mean by this thnt a club should adopt any
particular authority, it would not be bad If it
did, but a system of play is essential to the
club's success. â¢ ,A.i .y â . . , â^..^.-,
The Kate Wheelock Club of Portland, Or.,
has taken the initiative. In a letter received
recently from their president, Mrs. L. W. Sit
ton, she gives the system of play adopted by
the club as follows:
ORIGINAL LEADS FROM LONG SUITS.
The lead ol ace proclaims king with five or
mcreinsuit; queen, jack, with four or more
in suit; or at .east six in suit without the
above combinations.
The lead of king proclaims either ace or
queen, or borh, with four in suit.
The lead of queen proclaims king with five
or more in suit; or jack, ten, with four or
more in suit. . .
The lead of jack proclaims king ana queen,

The lead of ten proclaims king and jack.
Any other le id should be fourth best.

Jhe Whist- Player Who KnoWs lt Ail
The Boston Transcript has a whist depart
ment second to none in this country. In fur
nishing one of Its many entertaining and in
structive articles it says : a curious feellig ex
ists among some whist- players regarding the
quality of tne game they play. In ail lines of
science and art there have been few men' or'
.women' who have not had to recognize some
one as superior to them. Why whist-players
cannot recognize this and, instead of showing
jealousy and ill-feeling, strive by study to as
certain wherein others are stronger and then
apply themselves to Improving iheir game, is
a bard question to answer. Good plays by op
r-onentH should be cheerfully acknowledged.
To defend poor pluy by one's self is not a sign
-*â¢! genius. The player who knows it all is
never sought after, cither socially or as a
member of a team. An ingenuous young lady
once remarked utti i ix-hat.ded euchre part. :
â¢'lt's funny I cannot learn euchre; I learned
whist in five minutes." That "a little knowl
edge is _ dangerous thing" can rcost truly be
Eaid as applied to whist.

Fergus Falls' System of Play. "
Wheelock's Weekly, ably editcJ by XV. 11.
Wheelock, comes to us once a week and it has
many a good whist article. The following will
Interest all students of the game:
"It is a pleasure to notice that the masters
oi the game of whist in America" are gradu
ally adopting the points of the system of play
which the Fergus Fulls team have practiced
for several years pat-t. Ii emphasizes the
truth of what players in thi* town have been.
fond of saying ever since they first engaged in
tournament play, namely, that if the skill of
the team was equal to the strength of Its sys
tem It would win many matches; or to put it
differently. if the system of the leading long
suit clubs were altered to that played by the
Fergus Falls team thu local team would not
b. : in it even to the slight extent that It has in
the past.
"An instance of this change to Fergus Fall"!
models was shown in the last edition of Whist
of To-Day, the most progressive whist book of
the day, in whic.i the author alters the rule of
not opening from four trumps except when
there ar>.' three of every plain suit in hand, to
permit such opening regardless of plain-suit
strength when the hand seems to warrant it.
The Fergus Falls players have held steadily to
this latter Interpretation of the pay for four
or five years past. At the fourtn congress of
the A. W. L. the Fergus Falls team was tho
only one which used the three-trump signal
on hl^h cards led by partner. Thru play has
since, been adopted by nearly every leading
club in the couniry. At the *s*- me conrnss
there was no other team, so far as known,
which led ten from queen, jack, ten. To-day
that is the accepted and conventional play In
America. Another point In which Fergus
Falls has differed from all the authorities so
far as known is its interpretation oi the plain
suit â¢ cho or unblocking play. Cavendish say's
the play should not be us.d when partner's
opening shows only four in suit. Fergus Fails
begged to d. ffer, aid unblocked regnrdles-i <*Â£
number shown by partner's leadâ and thinks
it has gained tricks by it."

Son* and Daughters of St. George.
Last Friday night the members of Burnaby

gave an anniversary enter eminent and dance
i learn that in a late issue of the London Field
an advertisement appeared as follows:
Whist enthusiast desires to meet with others
who have mastered hook play ana will meet fre
quently and reguiarly for practice, without stakes
or bits. D. G. 11.
Just fancy what this meansâ that in the
great metropolis of Locd.u a poor, lonesome
whist-player desires to meet with others who
do not scorn later day developments and
progress. I pity the poor Englishman. . If ]
he would emigrate to this great and glorious
country, and take up his residenco in any
little town of 10,000 or more people he will
find tho associates he seeks without advertis
ing in a paper of the Field's standing. This
recalls to my mind what "Cavendish" told me
when he first visited this country iv 1893.
The day of his arrival had been publicly an- !
nounced, and the whist-players of this city
knew that he was to bo my guest. They
called quite constantly to pay their respects
to the great whist author, and every dcv and
for many hours we played whist. "Cavendish"
'thought I ' had previously arranged for
him to meet the best players in this vicinity,
and it was almost an impossibility for him to
believe th.it such was not the case and that he
was simply meeting the general run of play
ers. It was a revelation to him, because the
average of play here was so much higher than
:he was revs t < 'â â¢ d to at home that he
thought, and naturally, that the best players
had been selected to meet him. it has been
and still is the exception for him to get three
other good whist-players at thu whist table in
England. He very soon found that it was the
exception to have .any but four very good
players at the whist table in America. I have
heard that since his return to England ho In
forms his countrymen that they have been
distanced in the rue. - and that if they want to
play whist well and Intelligently they will
have to do as we have done- study the game
in all its phases f- rid not as lias been their cus
tom to consider It merely a game of chauce,
the main object b leg to win the other fellow's
money.
"Whist in the Mediterranean."
Henry Payot, for two years the president of
the "-an Franci -co Whist I lub.'und one of the
most popular whist men in the City, whose
only fault is he worships at the shrine of
straight whisr," delivered a lecture illustrated
with stereopticon views for the "bene
fit of the Fix ey Free Kindergarten, last
evening at the residence of Mrs. F. M. Pixley,
at the corner of Union' and Filimore '. streets,
on the subject, 'â¢â¢Glimpses, of t the Mediterra

near losing his lite for "calling lor trumps'* in
a RHine of whist. To enjoy it, you want the

VETEEAN COUVIUT SHIP.
' More Than a Hundred Years of Life to
/iL'.tVr-.-l Her Credit. . } ] A-fJ'.
The . most remarkable vessel . that has
yet passed up the Ship Canal- may now be
seen at Pomona Docks. In some respects,
indeed, the Success must be the
most raroarkable vessel afloat. Con
| structed almost entirely of .Indian
teak, with the square-cut stern and
j quarter galleries of a century ago. she was
-launched in 1790 at Moulmein, a rich set
| tlement near Rangoon, in Burmah, and
j traded for many years between England
and the Indies as Â« first-class merchant
; man. Subsequently she made occasional
I trips to Australia, chiefly as an emigrant
| and passenger vessel, until in 1852 aha
| found herself left at her moorings
j at Melbourne, abandoned by both crew
j and captain. Vessels in Australian ports
j were liable in those days to such deser-
I tions, for the gold fever was at its height.
Soon afterward, the Success was sold to
the Victorian Government, whose jail
accommodation, under the stimulus
of the eo'd rush, had quite given
out, and by whom she ~ was now
converted into a prison hulk with
seventy-two cells, lhe carpenters who
carried out this piece of work were paid,
we are told, at the rate of 35 shillings a
day, so magnificent was the influence of
the gold fields and so great the difficulty
of ietaining skilled workmen in Mel
bourne. It is in its prison form that the
Success is now making a tour of the chief
ports of this country. .
The vessel remains apparently in much
the same condition as when her decks
witnessed the scene** of horror which led,
although not until 1857. to the abolition
of the hulk system in Victoria. One can
quite understand, after an inspection of
the penal appliances of the ship, the
anxiety of the people of Melbourne
to have all traces of that odious system
destroyed. The Success, indeed, is afloat
to-day, thanks simply to a blunder on the
part of the authorities, by which she was
permitt d to escape the destruction that
i finally overtook the other members of the
prison fleet. \ JJjJ
An effort to remedy tbis blunder was
made in 1892, when some of the colonists
of Sydney succeeded in scuttling the ves
sel and sending her to the bottom of
Port Jackson. Six months later, how
ever, .. the Success was raised to
the sunace, and last year she set
out, after an interval of lorty years, on
another voyage across the seas, arriving
at London about five months and a half
after her departure from Adelaide witb
not a stick lost or the slightest weakness
discovered. â Aston Reporter.

THE MOTHER LODE IDEA
T-^iylTH the revival of gold-mining f
(\f\~iz3 we constantly hear ul inquiiies I
IM^II;^ almost all over the world about
the great mother lode of California. The j
foreign investor wishes to know more j
abont this mineral belt, the fame of which j
has spread everywhereâ what is its ex
tent, the character of its ores and the
possibility of favorable returns for money
expended. That he has a very indefi
nite idea of the character of the mother
lode is not to be wondered at, and it is not j
surprising also that this term to his mind
means everything of any real value in j
California. But at home, however, where
we have snch a good opportunity of ac- j
quiring some definite conception of what j
is meant by this term it is surprising that
there should exist such an indistinct idea
of its significance.
Such is the magic influence of the term
that not only does every miner in the
main gold belt of California feel assured â 
tbat his property is more valuable if he
can trace the mother lode through it, but
even in far Siskiyou or San Diego or in
the hot stretches of the desert the pros
pector, when he has found something ap
parently valuable asks himself if it cannot
be possible that his property is on a con
tinuation of the great lode of the central
part of the State. He sometimes goes so
far as to lay down a rule on the map for j
the purpose of seeing if the course of the j
lode in the central counties will not carry I
it near his discovery.
Descriptions of mines sent abroad for
tbe purpose of making sales are sure to
attract much more attention if it is as
serted that they are on the mother lode.
Every new camp of any importance is sure
to have its mother lode. We frequently
hear of it lately at Randsburg.
Those who are familiar with the origi
nal mother lode know its really unique
character as a. continuous mineral bell of j
remarkable richness, but they also know j
that because a mine is on this belt it is
not necessarily a bonanza, is not neces- j
sarily even a paying mine; that here as |
elsewhere are met the same difficulties in â¢
mining, the same low grade or barren i
veins; in fact, the same chances of success I
or failure which characterize mining |
everywhere. A man who has a compre- I
hensive knowledge of the character of the j
gold deposits of California as a whole {
knows that there are just as good mines
off the so-called mother lode as on it, and 1
that the undue exaltation of tnis lode not
only injures its permanent reputation, but
works against the mines in other parts :
of the State.
As was to be expected when gold was
first discovered here attention was given
exclusively to the placers, but these, how- j
ever, could not last. As far as we know I
the term mother lode was first used in El !
Dorado County when the miners began to ;
leave the shallow placers and seek for the |
source of the gold. It had frequently been
found in quartz bowlders, and conse- i
quently its original occurrence mmt be j
looked for in the great veins of quartz j
which ran through the country.
While these veins were found to con
tain gold over a great area of the Sierra
Nevada foothills it was soon recognized
tbat there was one remarkable mineral
zone stretching from Mariposa County
northward. For over 100 miles the pros
pector traced this remarkable lode, some
times able to walk on its croppings for
miles at a stretch. For long distances
the fissure occupied by the most import
ant vein had the appearance of being con- i
tinuous, and while contracting here and â 
there was characterized at certain spots by
great "blowouts" of quartz affecting even
the topography of the country. The
greatest body of quartz exposed above
ground is fonnd on tho Mariposa grant
in Mariposa County. It rises eighty feet,
with a length of 100 and a thickness at '
the base of twenty feet. It is known as !
the May Rock and presents a most strik- ;
ing appearance. Carson Hill, Quartz
Mountain and other eminences are due to i
aggregates of quartz veins. The lode does
not always occur as one great vein, for
through much of its length it consists of
numerous veins scattered in a belt of black
slate through which course dikes of green
stone parallel to the stratification. Thus
it has happened that while the whole
western slope of the Sierra Nevada is
more or less mineralized, the geologic I
structure is such that it has favored great- J
er development of fissures and subse- J
quent quartz veins along a comparatively j
narrow line.
Everything in nature seems to have
conspired to make this belt one of the j
greatest centers of mining in the world.
In the first place it is situated in a health- i
ful, pleasant region, well watered and
with plenty of timber, and comparatively
easy of access. The geological formation
known as the Mariposa slates, which the
lode follows almost continuously from
Mariposa through the intervening coun
ties to the south fork of the American j
River, ( has a- comparatively regular dip I
and strike in general parallel to tne line
Of the Sierras, thus contrasting strongly j
with much of the mntaphoric rock in !
other parts of the State. The disturbing {
forces which folded the slates and the j
dices which have been intruded parallel '
with them have given opportunity for the |
formation of regular and extensive fissures j
which were subsequently penetrated by !
the mineral-bearing solutions as they per- !
colated upward and filled with the goid- i
bearing quartz. It hardly seems possible j
that the oottom of the slates will' ever be I
reached in mining, and it is more than"
likely that gold will still remain when the '
greatest depths which can be worked with
profit .ball have been reached. Nature
could hardly have done better for us along
the great gold belt of California.- It is
possible that if she had been more prodi
gal the gold would, have been obtained so
easily that it would not have the value for
us which it now has. JJJ
What do we understand then by the '
mother lode? As I have used it, and as I
believe it was originally used, it is applied i
to this continuous narrow belt of veins â 
lying in black slate or on the contact of !
slate with greenstone or other eruptives, i
and extending through Mariposa, Tuol
umne, Calaveras, Amador and El Dorado
counties. I know, however, that this
definition will not suit all. But then
what is the need of any term at all, if we
make it cover everything in the State?
Nature has certainly produced, in tlie
counties mentioned, a mineral belt which
is geologically distinct, but the individual
mines there are no richer, or more easily
worked, or more permanent, than else
where in the State. Those who are famil
iar with the ground can cite as rich mines
off this belt as on it. The man whose
mine is not situated on tills comparatively
narrow zone may not be satisfied with this
definition, nor those who are interested in
mines in Nevada, Placer, Butte cr Plumas
counties.
Thesmple fact of it is that mines in
these counties are just as rich and valu
Pozzoni's Complexion
Powder produces a soft and beautiful skin*
it combines every element of beauty and
purity. *
r able in every way, have just as regular
j and permanent ore bodies as those farther j
south, but tbe geological conditions are j
I somewhat different, and unless we apply I
â¢ the term mother lode to the whole min
eral belt the length of the State we should
limit it in some way, and, in so doing,
that given is the original and only natural
one.
The miner in Siskiyou need not worry
about the mother lode. We know there
arc good mines there, and if his happens
! to be one of them, or if, on tbe contrary,
! it happens to be a poor one, it is not going
j to help him any to have it on the mother
| lode. To be sure, in making a sale abroad
! where the real character of the mineral
i belt of California is not known and only
tne mother lode has been heard of it may
make some difference where the mine is
situated, but this will not always bo the
case. When the foreign investor finds
! that he can be cheated in buying mines
situated on the mother lode, as he can
elsewhere, the mere name will cease to
have any direct money value.
It is coming to be realized that Califor
nia's wealth in gold is even greater than
has been supposed. The mineral belt
stretches the whole length of the State,
although apparently cut off by some of
| the larger valleys. It is probable; that
, with the exception of the gold-bearing
j quartz veins at Bodie and a few other
( minor localities the deposits belong to
about the same period of mineralization.
They are, hence, all genetically related,
having many characteristics in common.
The recent important discoveries of gold
n the Mojave desert, taken together with
our wider knowledge of its occurrence and
distribution, impress upon us the fact that
there is no immediate danger of California
reaching its maximum production and
; then declining. As the richer and more
| easily worked deposits known at present
: become exhausted there is still a certainty
, that others will be found to take their
j places, while the ever growing improve
| ment in the methods of mining and in the
j extraction of gold from low-grade ores
makes it possible to work the immense
! bodies of low-grade quartz which are
| known to exist. Gold is not so rare as we
I sometimes think it is. Careful examina
j tion has shown that it is present in very
J small Quantities in most all rocks and in
I sea water. In these conditions it is prob- :
| ably forever inaccessible.
It is very probable that as the globe
| cooled down from its original liquid con-
I dition to form the solid rocks this metal
| was nowhere concentrated in the form in
which it is found to-day but dissemi-
I nated, as I have before said. Ages of
convulsion followed the primary cooling,
I change succeeded change, periods of quiet,
| now of volcanic outburst with th^ sinking
j and uplifting of great ranges of moun
j tains. The history of our State is in no
I way peculiar. Its mountains form but a
, part of the great Cordilleran system run
; ning the whole length of the western
i coasts of North and South America.
I Minerals are found the whole length of
j these mountains, one in excess here, an
j other there. The country embraced by
California is but a small part of th's great
stretch of mineral-bearing mountains. It
wonla sometimes appear from the pres- j
ent-day knowledge of the earth that the
great gold deposits had been found, and
that the total production might lessen in
a few years. We must learn, however,
from the recent discoveries in Alaska that
i many possibilities yet exist where per-
I haps we least expect them.
Much has been said about the depth to
which the gold ore 3of California extend.
The question arises in every new camp as
it hits in Randsburg, Do the veins go
down? What reason have we to doubt
tbat they go down? There is but one im
portant district in the State where they
I have seemed to give out, and there the
| conditions are very peculiar. The veins
; certainly go down, and if rich on the sur
i face there is no reason to suppose that on
i the average they will be poorer in depth
as far as they can be opened. The pros
pector who has toiled miles over the hot
; desert and at last uncovered a little vein
of good ore should not. deceive himself
1 with the thought that it will certainly
j grow better with depth. It may do so,
and again it may not. Experience only
! will show.
though the life of the prospector is a
j hard one, he is also a free man and can
I come and go as he pleases, and, although
| money is needed for the successful work
; ing of many great discoveries, yet he need
not generally go hungry. Good prospects
are always in demand. The great trouble
i generally is that with the thought of the
possible wealth buried below he is apt to
demand several times what the would-be
investor is warranted in paying.
Great as is the mother lode with its un
â  told millions still hidden, yet opportuni
j tics for new discoveries at the present timo
i are greater in other and less known parts
jof .the State. These other regions are
i coming to the front, and in time the ques
-1 tion will not be asked with such earnest
ness about any particular mine, is it on
| the mother lode, but what is it on its own
j merits? We can give the aue proportion
of attention to the mother lode which it
I deserves, a gold belt which for magnitude
i and favorable situation cannot be equaled
j in the world, but at the same time realize
that it is composed of innumerable veins,
j each having a character of its own some
j being good and some poor, as in other
' district?. The success of mining there
with the frequently occurring low-grade
j ores it is most closely connected with the
skill and care shown by those in charge

A Paradise of Felines 'If This Old I

Strangers in Siena often speak of the
great quantity of pet cats to be seen there.
At each doorway opening directly on the
street tils a pet cat, staid and respectable, !
with a ribbon or some piece of color tied
about her neck to show that she belongs to
a human family. Workmen in their little
shops have a cat to keep them company,
j sometimes sitting on a low counter at the
window. All are within reach of any
! teasing hana; but , I never saw a cat
chased or teased iv any way, and it is
! plain that they feel perfectly safe and did
| not expect "any injury. Personally, I
i found t.em unsociable, and tbat when I
| spoke to them they took no notice and
| made no reply, even when I learned an
I Italian word or two to say to them. They
were happy at home, and did not need to
! make new iriends.
J In Naples there are men whose business
, it is to feed cais tvery day at noon. Peo
j pie with economical tables subscribe a
! small sum to have their cats provided for
i by the cats' food man. The cats begin to
I feel quite hungry about noon, and stroll
out from the shops, in all those crowded
| streets to watch for their dinner. I <ould
j not imagine what was the excitement
j among them the first day I was out at that
hour. Presently I saw a part of the daily
distribution on bust inn Chiaja. There
were cats there who feemed to watch what
was dealt out to them very critically, as if
they intended to make a complaint if
their dinner was not as good as it ought
; to be.

or looking timid and anxious as if uncer
tain where to run to. I remember a cat I
used to pass near the old: Medici Church
of San Spirito. â  She seemed to live on one
of the upper floors of a large house, and
she could only look up to her window by
sitting in the middle of the street. She
would never answer my greeting, but con
tinued to look up as if watching her
friends, or perhaps signaling to them that
she was ready to go home.
There is a special cat < hurch in Florence,
San Lorenzo, Mh* church in which so many
Medici are buried. I don't know whether
tnat family was particularly fond of cats
or tow it happened, but. the cloisters of
San Lorenzo are reserved for homeless cats,
whether they come there by themselves or
are brought by people who want to dis
pose of them. I had read in my guide
book that these animals are fed every day
at noon from scraps brought in by people
from the neighborhood, so I was particular
to time my first visit at noon, and was
disappointed to hear that for some reason
the break ast hour had been changed to
9 a. m.
There is a large raised green center in
the cloisters, on which grow some shrubs
and trees; and asleep under the bushes
or loitering around the stone ledge that
inclosed the green were a dozen or two
of the charily cats. Legend says they are
witches, who have consented to take this
harmless shape and to keep out of mis
chief. They were a rather dilapidated
looking lot, but stiil interesting, because
all cat-< have a great deal of individuality,
and, wben possible, of independence also.

Italy and certainly not the birds; but if I

EXPENSIVE BRASS BANDS.
Over Ten Thousand Dollars for a Jew
eled Cornet.
The writer was recently accorded the
privilege of a peep into the museum at
tached to the factory of one of the largest
firms of brass instrument makers in Lon
don. Here are to be seen types, fac-similes
and models of every kind of musical in
strument that the mind of man has ever
devised, invented or produced.
In one corner Is a duplicate ot what is
believed to be the most costly presenta
tion cornet ever produced. It was made
to the order of the late Czarof Russia, and
is of sterling silver, richly graven with va
riousl devices, among which the arras of
the mperial bouse of Romanoff figure
conspicuously.
The whole of the ornamentation is of
beaten gold filigree work, and the "bell"
of the instrument is thickly me usted
with rubies and emeralds. Its net value
is a trifle over 2000 guineas.
A melancholy interest attaches to a bat
tered and blood-stained bugle which was
picked up on the field of Isandiwana. In
addition to the dark patches â which were
once splashes of wet blood sundry frag
ments of woolly hair were adhering to the
bell of the instrument when first found, a
pretty conclu-j.ve indication that the gal
lant owner had used it in a last desperate
effort to beat off his relentless foe*. It may
be that some ebony-skinned Zulu still
wanders about with an indentation in his
skull whom it would be difficult to con
vince thai "music hath charms."
Near to this interesting relic is a fac- |
simile of a set of drums whicu were made
for the new Rhodesia Horse. The peculi- '
arity lies in the fact that the cases are of
aluminum, a precaution rendered neces
sary by the number of white ants that in
fest that country. The other instruments
are of brass, silver-plated, and the whole
band costs some Â£350.
The above is, of course, a comparatively
modest turnout. For real itorgeousness in
brass bands it is necessary to inspect some
of the costly and magnificent sets of in
struments turned out for Eastern poten- I
tates. The bands of even the smartest of
our crack cavalry corps are absolutely not
in it, so far as elegance of appearance is '
concerned, with the private bands of some j
of the Indian tributary Princes, although
probably the latter would nave to give tue
iormer several points if it came to*, a
musical contest between them.
The private band of the Rao of Outcb,
for instance, cost originally Â£900 and
renews most of the instruments every four
or five years. The ti_er skin used by the
Rao's big drummer, which was sent
over here to be prepared and mounted,
was taken from an animal killed by his
Highness, ana measured over seven
feet in length. It is lined through
( out with heavy corded crimson silk,
! and the brute's eyes are simulated
oy a pair of big yellow diamonds.
Another very fine band was made three
I years ago to the order of the late Shah of
Persia. All the instruments were of pure
| silver â which, by the way, does not give
i forth so good a sound as brass, besides
< being heavier to handleâ inlaid with gold.
| The total cost of this band de luxe was a
I trifle under 3000 guineas. A very differ
-1 ent kind of band was that made last year,
! by the same firm, for the Mimkish In
j dians, a tribe of savages living near Alert
i Bay, in British Columbia. The -band is
nearly all drum, and the mouthpieces of
! tho few brass instruments are tipped with
j indiarubber, to obviate the inconvenience
of applying metal to the lips in .a ter
n perature of some thirty or lorty degrees
'â  beiow zero.
A curious offer was received a short
time ago from the Emperor of Morocco,
It was for eighty clarionets for one band.
As the instruments in question were all in
one key, it is probable that they were to
be played in unison. The effect upon an
overage man of eighty band clarionets
blown simultaneously would probably be
to create in him a wild desire to take to
the woods and become an aborigine. Even
to imagine such an ear-piercing combi
nation sets one's tympanum quivering. â

THE LARGEST BBIDGE.
A Great Structure Recently Erected
Over tho Danube River.
The longest railroad bridge in Europe,
and, in fact, the world, was recently
opened to traffic with great ceremony.
The new railroad bridge over the Danube
River at Czeruavoda is one of the most
imjartant technical achievements of re
cent date. For more than nine miles this
bridge crosses the Danube proper and the
so-called inundation which is annually
under water for a certain period of time.
The largest spans are over the main cur
rent of the river, there being one of 020
feet and four of 455 feet each. The total
length of the bridge proper, without any
approaches, is 13,325 feet, while the
largest railroad bridges in the world meas
ure as follows: Tay bridge, Scotland.
10,725 feet; Mississippi biidge at Mem
phis. 10.600 feet; the Forth bridge, Scot
land, 7800 feet; the Morody bridge, in Ga
licia, 4800 feet, and the bridge over the
Volga, near fcysran, 4700 feet.
Tne clear height oi the bridge over the
main channel is so calculated '.hat even at
high water the largest vessels sailing on
the Danube may pass under it. Tne clear
height of the distance from high-water
mark, which is taken at 35 leet above low
water mark, measure* 105 leet to the low
e.-t ratters of the superstructure. The
caissons upon which the foundations of
the bridge piers rest reach to rock bottom
or 115 feet below high-water mark. The
Roumanian Government has just cause
to be proud of this magnificent structure,
wbich enables travelers from London to
Constantinople or India to shorten their
trip 'by fully sixteen hours. The promise
of diverting: transcontinental mails from
otber lines was tbe most potent factor in
bringing about the construction of this
bridge over the Danube on the part of
Roumania. â Atlanta Constitution.

MINES
& MINERS
S. K. Thornton, vice-president of. the Cali- !
fornia Miners* Association, is meeting with
much success In his present zealous efforts to
organize new branch county associations, to
stimulate those already organized and to
bring them all into co-operation with the
Siate Association, which needs their support.
He is making a tour of the mining counties
as an officer and representative of the associa
tion, sent out by the executive committee,
and spent the last week in El Dorado County.
He believes that a total membership of 10,000
can be secured in the State. There is nothing
but good wishes anywhere for the success of
the association, which has so completely won
the confidence of the mining and the general
public by its high and representative char
acter and tha remarkable success which it has
achieved in securing legislation in behalf of
the industry.
With the comparatively recent discovery
that the veins of the mother lode are apt to be
as rich at the greatest depths reached as
above, deep mining has become a matter of
much importance to California. Tne increased
gold production of the mother lode region in
the future will come from operations at deeper
levels as well as from the development of new
mines. The Bendigo field in Australia has
taken the lead In deep gold mining, and just
now holds the record.
The Dlestelhorst dredger on the Klamath,

draulic miucs in full operation, including the
Nanetta B and the Seattle. The hydraulic

HOW COLFAX WAS BEATEN.
A Good Story Told of the Late Joseph I
* I*. McCullagh,
One of tbe best stories of the late Joseph
B. McCullagd is his own account of how
he prevented the re nomination of Schuy- !
ler Colfax for Vice-President in 1872, says !
the St. Louis Republic. 'â /.'â â 
As Mr. McCullagh described the event, |
Colfax had treated! tho newspaper repre- j
sentatives who had legitimate business
with him in Washington very shabbily,
and thus prep ired the way for a hostile
demonstration on their part. Mr.. Mc-
Cullagh look up the cause of tne Wash
ington correspondents and at the Phila
delphia convention was chosen to lead
their movement against Colfax.
The first step was to secure a rival can- i
didate on whom to concentrate their favor- '
, able work. At a council of war held iust '
before the convention i>D9ned Henry Wil
son was chosen. McCullagh then went to |
lobn W. Forney, the editor of the Phila- i
delphia Press, and said:
"We want you to help ns beat Colfax." I
"But," protested Mr. Forney, "I have j
promised Mr. Colfax that I would bring j
tbe Press out in his favor. lam not par
ticularly a Colfax man, but I must keep
my word.".
"Well," said McCullaeh, "will you let
me run the nolitical matter in your news j
columns? You boom Colfax editorially and |
I will quietly attend to our man through |
the rest of the paper."
Forney consented to this, and McCul
lagh applied himself to work on the local
and telegraph paces of the Press. Eveiy
morning the paper appeared with an cdi- i
torial leader in favor of Colfax, while else
where were published special telegrams
from all over the country, describing en
thusiastic feeling in favor of Henry Wil
son lor the Vice-Presidency. Th * local
columns made the most of every Wilson
preference expressed by arriving dele
gates at the hotels and' elsewhere, and
there were reports of railway trains hav
ing been ' polled and -indicating an over
whelming desire for Wilson's nomination.
All this had a vastly, greater influence
upon the public mind than Forney's edi
torial panegyrics.
Just at the right juncture McCullagh
raked up an ola letter that Colfax had
written to ths New -York Tribune in ISO,
announcing that at the completion of his
pending official term he would not be a
candidate tor renomination, it being his
determination to retire permanently from
political life. This letter was written at
the time when the war upon Grant was at |
its height, and McCullagh shrewdly real- j
ized that it would be accepted by the i
delegates to Philadelphia as Colfax's pub- â 
lie repudiation of Grant and his adminis
tration. In less than two hours the j
letter was in type and was circulated by
means of handbills all over Philadelphia, j
In this way the impression was created !
that in the very midst of General Grunt's
sorest trouble-* his lieutenant had volun
tarily assisted in the conspiracy to kill
him. It had its effect; Â«o, when the con
vention met, Colfax'? hold was thoroughly
unsettled. Grant was nominated by ac
clamation. The first ballot for Vice-
President result in a stand off between
Colfax and Wilson, some Southern States
having thrown idle complimentary votes.
McCullagh stood on tbe platform near
the presiding officer's desk. He knew
there was likely to be a stampede, and
that if the States were recognized in al
phabetical order Wilson might yet be
slaughtered; stampeders invariably go as
ihey are led, and Alabama was liable to
change to Colfax.
Alabama was already on her feet clam
oring for recognition.
"Recognize Virginia," whispered Mc-
Cullagh to Judge Settle, president of the
convention, and Judge Settle did so. -
Virginia changed her vote from Colfax
to Wilson, as had been arranged in ad
vance. That started a hurrah, and the
stampede was turned the way McCullagh
wanted.
Colfax's private secretary stood just be
hind McCullagh at that moment. When
Virginia announced her change McCul
lagh turned and said:
"You may go and tell Colfax he is
beaten, and that the newspaper men did
it."
This performance McCullagh always re
parded as one of the cleverest political
strokes he had ever made.
A NEW SOUP SPOON.
A Desired Improvement Which Will Be
Appreciated by Moustached Diners.
Destiny is shaping the end of the man
who for years has been breaking hearts by
his efforts to fetch the point of his soup
spoon "head on between the wings of his
moustache. He may refuse to be shaped,
of course, and may continue to dislocate
his shoulder at each mouthful and to
wreck a frill of his neighbor's sleeve at
each hoisting cf his elbow, but he can no
longer in fashionable houses j;et the point
of his SDOon into his mouth.
An.l the reason is lite that which the
little boy gave for refusing to give the core
of his apple. "There wasn't going to be
any core," and there isn't any point to the i
new soup spoon. A round spoon, not so !
very unlike a miniature ladle in its shape
as to entirely escape the calumny, has ;
been eagerly adopted by those who like !
up-to-date services, and is now being
bought at the rate of thousands a week by
those who follow fashion.
Very heavy single spoons of the nrn*
style were sold lor Christmas gifts at $4 I
and $5 each, but lighter ones of the usual ]
weicnt for soup spoons are sold at from i
$30 to $50 a dozen. A chrysanthemum
pattern, made exclusively by a Union- i
square firm of silversmiths, has ceen enor
mously successful, over $10,000 worth of
spoons and similar small tableware having
been sol. l by them in a few days.
To make a rather esthetic comptnion
for the new soup spoon, that it may not |
go forth into the world alone, so to speak,
there is to be the debut this week of a posi
tively new pastry fork.
A "pie fork" they would probably call
this in the land where Ralph Waldo Em- I
erson, a favorite non, is reverenced for
"STEW TO-DAT.

A "pantry fore" it is called here, but by
even a more euphemistic name yet it
would be an interesting invention and a
high novelty. The wavy edge, which has
made a certain sort of bread knife famous*,
has teen applied to the pastry fork, to
gether with a curving shape, which makes
it possible lor even a nervous man to keep
the tip of his fork on his plate and saw
through an obstinate bit. of puff pastry.
To le spared the old familiar agony of
seeing the soft and melting heart of his
"sweetie" go sailing away, to make a cran

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
FOR ffBUUKSS OF Ml
WHICH rCBED HIM AFTER EVERT-
THING ELSE FAILED,
Palnfal diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and tinder
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubies. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
cf medic. that not only completely restored
the Keneral health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, mid
he now declares that any man who will tako
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at cues could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cnred me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the lew postage-stem necessary

WHEATâ Boomed again yesterday. Spot grain
rose 7V2 c, May 714 c and December _V_c. This
advance is sharp enough to satisfy almost any

j world.
The local market has advanced more sharply
than the taster and foreign markets ou accouni
lof tbe prevailing hot north â Mod. But aside from
1 tills, the Emopeaii war and the lkss tavorable ap
pearance of the crop In several important Wheat
j countries are in themse.ves sufficient to send
j prices up.
The advance has drawn shippers out of their
snells and they are now buying at the higher
prices. The millers, 100. are taking hold and

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During tbe
week there have been three arrivals from Wash
ington with 11.060 tons of Coal, live from Oregon
with 2310 tons, one from British Columbia with
1200 tons and one from Australia with 28-ti tons,
The very light arrivals will not disturb the mar
ket, as there Is ample here to meet all immediate
calls. There were some deliveries of Corral Hol
low this week which were closely analyst?*]' but
judgment is withheld unti the consumers make a
report ou its capabilities. As it may possibly be
come a permanent factor with our fuel consumers,
considerable interest Is being displayed with Its
advent locally. The unsettled* condition of the
tariff on Coal is Keeping orders back, as It Is very
dubious yet what will be the final outcome, al
though the verdict should be very closet at baud.
Coal freights remain firm from Eng and and Aus

CORRIGAN IN A
TIGHT CORNER
Confessed Under Oath That
He Had Seriously
Blundered.
A Great lojustice Was Done
Messrs. spreckels and
Leake.
It Was All About an Obligation for
$2500, Which the Turfman
Seeks to Ignore.
Had Edward Corrigan, turfman and
sport, been possessed of the true instincts
of a gentleman who is not loth to acknowl
edge when he ha* committed an error, he
would have stood up yesterday morning
and proffered an abject apology to Adolph
B. Spreckels and W. S. Leake, the late
president and secretary, respectively, of
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club.
The opportunity for this was presented
to him, and it would undoubtedly have
been received with good grace, but Corri
gan either did not appreciate the situ
ation, or, what was more apparent, did
not want to.
Nevertheless, while under oath, and
while under the presence of a series of di
rect and unavoidable questions hurled at
him by Attorney Garret McEnerney, this
Mr. Corrigan was compelled to confess,
-.-radically, that he had been articulating
through his chapeau when he made a
statement recently to the effect that
Messrs. Spreckels and Leake had con
spired to rob him of $2500.
Corrigan has had a great many business
transactions with Mr. Spreckels during
the past two years, chief among which
was the borrowing of money from the
young millionaire. But all this ended
recently, wh en Messrs. Spreckels and
Leake withdrew from the Jockey Club in
order to let the Chicago horseman run
things in his own peculiar way, and since
then Corrigan has not had many kind
things to say about his former associates.
At all events, during the settlin_-up
process Mr. Spreckels found that Corrigan
still owed him $2500 on a promis3 ory note
executed on the 3d of February, ISU6, and
be formally apprised the man who in the
East is known as "the master of Haw
thorne" of the fact.
â¢^Corrigan refused to redeem the obliga
tion and in consequence a suit was begun
to recover ttie amount.
This proceeding had the effect of caus
ing Corrigan to lose his temper and to
forget as well his pretensions toward up
rightness and integrity. In his angry
moments he proclaimed that be had
thought all along that he had been deal
ing with gentlemen, but found himself
mistaken. More than this he made re
marks which were printed in a morning
paper, from which the inference could be
drawn that Mr. Leake, with the knowl
edge and consent of Mr. Spreckels, bad
juggled three promissory notes and a like
number of cbecks in such a manner as to
deprive him of $2500 due him.
But these gentlemen were given a speedy
and positive vindication yesterday morn
ing, when, by mutual consent and on an
order of court, they met with Corrigan at
the office of Attorneys Rothchild & Ach
for the purpose of giving depositions.
Mr. Spreckels was first sworn, and in re
sponse to Mr. Ach's questions said that on
February 3. 1896. he loaned Corrigan $2500
and received his note therefor. He paid
the money over in the form of a check on
the Nevada Bank. On the 10th of March
of the same year Corrigan wanted some
more money and Mr. Spreckels loaned
him $10,000, again civing a check on the
Nevada Bank and attain receiving a prom
issory note, and once more, on May 21,
1896. Corrigan borrowed $5000 more.
This time the check was drawn on the
California Safe Deposit and Trust Com
pany, in favor of a Mr. Summerfield, but
was indorsed "nayable to bearer.'' All
three of these checks were produced by
Mr. Spreckels before the notary who took
the deposition, and the cancellations
showed that they had been paid over to
Corrigan. They all bore the latter's sic- |
nature, too. The promissory notes for
$10,000 and $5000, respectively, Mr. Spreck
els did not possess, as he had turned them
over to the horsemen when they were re
deemed, but he did have the unpaid note
for $2500 and promptly exhibited it. This
amount be said was still due.
Then Corrican was sworn. He was in
clined at first to dodge a direct admission
that the signature-* on the checks were
his, but Attorney McEnerney's persistent
demands for a positive answer finally
brought out the desired acknowledg
ment.
"Now, Mr. Corrigan, you received all
of that money â those three separate

amount? didn't you?" asked Mr. Mc-
Enerney. * Zy.' J
"I presume I did," replied the Cbi
cagoan, h-suatinglv.
"Well, now, didn't you?" *_'/*Â«â 
"I suppose â well, I must have received
it. The checks show for themselves."
The attorney then handed Corrigan the
unpaid promissory note, and asked him if
he nad executed it. Corriean first "sup
posed" he did, and then acknowledged it
flat-footedlv.
"Mow, Mr. Corrigan, what we want to
know is whether or not you are willing to
swear that you paid that amount?"
Here was the nut of the whole affair.
Corrigan was palpably worried, and iiazel
uneasily at that canceled $5000 check.
Then he procee*iel to lain, rather dis
join tedly, that he had been under the im
pression for some lime that, while he had
given a note for $5000 on the last borrow,
still he had received a checK for but $2500,
t'*e idea being to take up the first note for
$2500. He remembered that he had made
a dicker of some sort with Mr. Leake, who
was acting for Mr, Spreckels.
He acknowledged, however, that there
was a mistake somewhere, as the last
check plainly indicated that he had re
ceived the full $5000.
This would snow that the $2500 debt
was still delinquent.
"You thought you received but $2500
when you gave that last note for $500*0
there, and thought that in that manner
you had disposed of the first $2500 note,
and yet the check here shows that you re
ceived the full amountâ isn't that about
the situation?" asked Mr. McEnerney in
conciu-ion.
Corrigan nodded affirmatively and Mr.
McEnernev said he guessed they had
heard all that was necessary in the case.
Corrigan had blundered, but would not
come out and say so.
He said he might have paid the money
over in some other manner, but could not
say how. He would like to have time to
look over his books, he said, and in this
manner was granted a week's respite.
"I will say this for Mr. Corrigan," said
Attorney Ach, rather apologetically,
"this $5000 check is a surprise to him. He
had forgotten it. It is in reference to that
matter that he asks for time to consult
his accounts. He is nofquite sure as to
how he stands."
Messrs. Spreckels and Leake and their
friends departed in triumph, while Cor
rigan remained behind to tell his troubles
to Mr. Ach. It is extremely doubtful
now if the case will ever come up in court.

FUBNISHINGS DAMAGED.
Suit of Webster Jones Against Rudolph
Spreckeltt on Trial Yesterday.
The suit of Webster Jones against Ru
dolph Spreckels was on trial before Jus
tice Groezinger yesterday, the plaintiff
giving bis testimony.
.He stated that he bad rented bis ele
gant home to tbe defendant because he in- !
tended to remove to Ross Valley. He had
asked $200 per montli, but had taken $110
per month, with a year's rent paid in ad
vance in consideration of Mr. Spreckels
residing in the house and taking cood care
of it. He testified that the latter bad
agreed to turn over the property at the
end of eighteen months in as good condi
tion as he had received it.
Mr. Jones further stated that when the
lease was up he found that during the
last four months 01 its duration Spreckels
bad not lived in the house, and had not
even Kept a caretaker there, and the range
was broken, the curtains and carpets torn
and soiled, and the place in a generally
bad condition. The water had been al
lowed to run until it had ruined plants
and sidewalk. He had sent the bills for
repairs, amounting to several hundred
dollars, to Mr. Spreckels, but no attention
was paid to them, and he sued for $250
damages. - >*'
The case was continued until the de
fendant's attorney could have a chance to
produce testimony.

NO HOPE FOR THE
SHIP SAMARIA
The Wreckage From Her
Washed Ashore Along
the Coast.
Fishermen Looking for Bodies,
but None Have Come
Ashore.
The Schooner Albion Had to Put Back
in Distressâ Lest Her
Mainsail*
All doubt as to the fate of the overdue
collier Samaria seems to have been set at
rest. In a private letter received by E. L.
Woods from Astoria yesterday, it is
learned that a life-preserver, part of a
boat and a section of a deckhouse, all
marked "Samaria," had all drifted ashore
off Cape Disappointment during tbe night.
The wreckage was hauled up on the beach
by some fishermen and a search made for
bodies, but none were recovered. 'â ".' ...
Fire broke out on the collier Washtenaw
now being repaired at the Fulton Iron
Works yesterday, but was put out with
out much damage being done. The fire
started in the galley and made a gr?at
smoke, bui a "bucket brigade" soon bad
it under con trol.
The schooner Albion, which lett her* a
week ago for Alaska, ran into a heavy
norther on tbe 25 1 inst., and was so dam
aged that she had to put back here for re
pairs. The mainsail was carried away
and took with it all -the blocks and the
standing rigging from both sides of the
masts. She will have to go on the dry
dock for repairs.
i The ship Occidental also put in. At
first it was thought she was in distress as
tbe Guide showed her as bound from De
parture Bay lor Acapulco. It was learned
on her arrival, however, that there was no
demand for coal in Central America, so
the vessel's destination was changed for
San Francisco. â¢-;--.!
There was a shakeup among the carpen
ters, sweepers and dredger bands on the
water front yesterday. All Commis
sioner Cole's appointments went out and
Commissioner Harney's men will till their
places to-morrow.
Since the arrival of the United States
sbip Cam-inch-.*, in the harbor for the
use of the Naval Battalion, that organiza
tion bas greatly felt the need of an engi
neer corps to bave charge of and handle
the machinery on the vessel. During the
last Legislature tbe matter was actively
pushed before the Committee on Military
Affairs, with the result that a bill was
passed providing for an engineer division,
to be composed of fifty or more men.
A list has been ODened at '2:1% East
street for applicants who may wisti to en
list: as machinists, water tenders, boiler
makers, oilers, first, second and third fire
men. Tne opportunities for promotion in
an organize tion of this kind just forming
are very bright, and the officers having
the matter in charge ex- eet to soon have
a division of first-class men- on. their
hands, especially as the men when called
upon by the 4 Government for their ser
vices will receive the same pay as those in
tbe corresponding ratings of the United

no difficulty in securing the required
number.

first vessel to get a charter in six weeks.
It was inadvertently stated in yester
day's Cam. that Morton's special delivery
had gone out of business on tbe water
front. This is not so, as their solicitors
are there as usual and can always be
found at their post. The only change
made by Mr. Morion was the removal of
his office and receiving-room at the
ferries. His delivery system on Taylor,
Market and Battery streets is still in full
force, however. Morton Brothers assert
that they are still in the ring, and that it
will take a dozen transfer companies to
kill their opposition.; JJJ, J.
EXPENSIVE ECONOMY.
Big- Damage Suit Growing Out of Mar
ket-Street Railway Parsimony.
Henry Johnson, by bis attorney, Martin
Stevens, bas instituted an action at law
against the Market-street Railway Com
pany lor $10,000 damages for personal
injuries.
The plaintiff avers that on the 18th of
the present month he was riding on one
of the electric cars of the defendant cor
poration, which was operated by a motor
man without the assistance of a conductor;
that tie tola the motorman to stop at the
corner of Frederick and Stanyan street;
that when nearing that point the car was
slackened in speed and the plaintiff was
about, to alight, when the person acting in
the dual capacity of motorman and con
ductor carelessly and without warning so
operated the motive power that the speed
of the car was suddenly increased, wheres
by the plaintiff was forcibly thrown to
the ground, breaking his right arm in two
places and painfully bruising his head
and body. *
Mr. Johnson complains of the conduct
on the part of the company for employ
ing one man to do the work of operating
this car when two were needed, and holds
the company responsible for tbis culpa
ble negligence, as the accident would not
have happened if there had been a regular
conductor on the car. This is another
instance where an effort at economy may
piove a source of expense. * ;**_'-*i

he required the information for the benefit
of Eastern communities'which might de
sire to follow the example of San Fran
cisco.
Heretofore the unemployed in other
States have been set to work at repairing
roads, but the experiment of making per
manent roads has never been tried.
Three hundred and fifty men were en- ;
gaged yesterday on the boulevard. The
work of macadamizing the roadway to the
full width was begun yesterday and if the
good people who have not yet subscribed !
will now step to the front and assist in the j
undertaking the beautiful driveway will
be completed to the lngleside.
Mr. Bunker, speaking of the 250 un
employed men under Letlingwell, who
made a raid upon the town of Lodi
last Friday, said:
"This committee has never recognized
those people in any way. They organized
simply for the purpose of bulldozing the
community. We organized this boulevard
committee to furnish relief to the genuine
unemployed, who are willing to work on
the bouievard. Thos*) Leffingwell people
came to us at the outset and said, 'We de
mand recognition as a body,' aud they I
were told that they were recognized, and
for that reason we didn't want them.
They refused to leave the City in detach
ments or to accept positions offered to
squads of three and four, but insisted that
the whole gang should he employed as a
body. Their leader, Leffingwell, said
that if they were to accept employment
as individuals, the organization would j
fall to pieces, and that they proposed to j
hold together."
Supervisors Devaney and Delaney pro
pose to introduce a resolution at next
Monday's meeting of the Board of Super
visors to turn over to the boulevard lund
the $3000 usually appropriated for Fourth
of July fireworks.

CLEANER CORRIDORS.
Head Janitor -'Neil of the City Hall
Much Pleased.
The corridors of the new City Hall al
ready bear witness to the good effect of
the anti-expectoration ordinance. Head
Janitor T. J. O'Neil reports that the work
of keeping the main corridors clean has
been minimized, thus permitting the em
ployment of the men in other parts of the
building.
Another advantage is sanitary in its
character. Hitherto vast quantities of
soap and water were required to scrub out
the stains of tobacco juice that befouled
the stone floors of the passage ways, and
the atmosphere was Kept damp by the
evaporation that followed those diurnal
floods. That evil has been obviated in
great part by the fact that not so much
water is needed.
An odd phase of the expectoration
nuisance, which leads to spitting on the
various stairways, has grown up. how
ever, by reason of an effort on the part of
some graceless wretches to show their de
fiance for the spirit of the law without, as
they think, violating the letter, and thus
laying themselves liable for prosecution.
Inasmuch as the ordinance forbids the be
foulment of the corridors, but says noth
ing of the stairways, some evilly disposed
clowns consider it a mark of wit to use
the stairways as cuspidors. Chief of Po
lice Lees has instructed the policemen on
duty in the municipal buildings to arrest
the first person caught offending in this
regard, and a test case is to be made in the
Police Court. 'â¢â¢';-..';
