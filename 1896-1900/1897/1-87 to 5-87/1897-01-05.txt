VOLUME LXXXI.-XO. 36.
OPENING OF THE LEGISLATURE
But There Is a Very Serious
Question as to Its
Organization.
JUMBLE IN THE SENATE
AND ASSEMBLY.
Peculiar Tactics of Hamilton in
Securing a Call for a
Caucus.
MEMBERS FALSELY TOLD THAT
OTHERS HAD SIGNED.
Intense Indignation Exists and the Fierce Fight
Begun Will Now Be Waged Until a
United States Senator Is Elected
to Succeed Perkins.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 4. âManager Hamilton announced to
il ght that he had secured sixty-two signatures to a call for a Republi
can caucus to-morrow evening on the Senatorial matter, Robinson of
Nevada County being the last to append his name.
After the list had been given to the press Assemblyman Pohlman,
whose name was on the list, stated that it had been represented to
him that all of the San Fra. Cisco delegation had signed, which was
not th- fact, and he therefore proposed to take his name off.
Other Republicans have made statements to the same effect. In
tense indignation exists, and a fierce fight has begun. It will be
waiied until a L'nited States Senator shall have been elected.
There is a serious question as to whether the Legislature was or
ganized to-day. The Senate adjourned earlier than did the Assembly,
.iml th, rcsrlt was that the Senate was not notified that the Assembly
had organized. The Senate committee could not find the Governor,
and the Governor was not notified. Hence the organization is said to
b^ incomplete, the foregoing. essentials not having been present.
Samuel M. Shortridge arrived on the late train last night, and was
received at his headquarters in the Golden Eagle Hotel by a hoit of
friends. __
OPENING OF THE SENATE.
Peculiar Omission That May Cause
a Postponement of the Sen
atorial Election.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 4.â When
the Senatorial caucus, which had met
iri one cf the rooms upstairs, ad
journed shortly before noon to-day, and
when the Senators filed into the well
wurmed chamber in which they were to
make laws Jor the government of the peo
ple of this State, they were followed by a
large crowd who wished to witness the
opening of the session of that distin
guished body.
The pallrries were filled and in the
lobby and seated in the red plush chairs
inside the railing on thejsround floor were
many ladies, attired in their most gaudy
raiment and most brilliant plumes. The
Senators themselves were not lacking in
the appreciation of the dignity and im
j.onance of the occasion. A few had their
wives sitting by them and a!l were ap
pareled as became the distinguished office
tiiled by them. The elderly gentlemen,
who put on a most severe expression of
countenance in order to parry the smiles
of the good-looking young women seeking
positions at the bands of the Senate, wore

black clothes and black cravat*, and
looked to the life most potent, grave and
reverend seigneurs.
Senator Morehouse of Santa Clara is
one of the most distinguished looking of
the new members. He wore a white
cravat and in his coat lapel a camellia of a
deep crimson hue.
Senator Bert, a holdover from San
Francisco, and Senator Denison of Ala
meda sported four-in-hands of brocaded
siik. the three enlivening the gloom most
gayly. The personnel of the Senate com
pares favorably with that of former ses
sions, there being many more than ordi
narily strong men amone tnem. For that
reason the present session promises to be
one of the most interesting if not impor.
ant in the history of the Stale. The first
day was as tame as all first days usually
are, the business beingof the most routine
character of preliminary organization.
Just as the hands of the big clock in the
zallery pointed to noon Lieutenant-Gov
ernor Jeter walked up the steps leading to
his chair of well upholsterer plush. It
was &ucli a chair as poets of the do;ce far
niente school would love to 101 l and doze
in; suggestive of sweet Deace and the rest
which belong 1 ? to him who possesses
neither fame nor care. Mr. Jeter is a fine

Opening Session.
looking man, tall, dark, in the happy
medium degree, with curly hair and a
sweeping mustache. His are such a face
and figure as were seen before these vil
lainous days of gunpowder, when the good
right arm, the stout heart, the well-tem
pered blade, the quick eye and the stipple
prist won the way vi their possessor to
ducats and duchesÂ«es. Put upon him the
conventional doublet and hose ; span the
lithe waist with a broad leathern bolt,
fasten thereto a basket-bilted hanger ot
hand-made Damascus steel and cover tie
squirming dark locks with a wide
brimmed sombrero and you transform the
Lieutenant-Governor of California into a
rollicking blade of the days of all who can
k.ss pretty maids and drink sack with
equal pusto.
But Mr. Jeter is not that kind of a man.
Detail with his description has been gone
into because, a general rule, the Lietven
ant-Governor of a State, like the Vice-
President of the United States, drops into
oblivion after election, unless he elopes
with some other man's wife or murders
his mother-in-law, or does something hor
rible to force trie newspapers to notice
him and the people to reruember him.
However, on this occasion, Mr. Jeter was
a personage of consequence in the affairs
of the State.
The Senate could not have organized
without him, had he chosen not to take his
seat. That is the opinion of Governor
Budd as expressed this afternoon, but it
has been stated that the opinion is un
sound. If that were the case the death of
a Lieutenant-Govornor at an hour or a
minute before the opening of the Senate
would throw matters into confusion the
most inextricable.
The call to order was short and sweet
two raps of the gavel and tlie simple an
nouncement that the session had begun.
After the rollcall there was a pause of live
or ten minute*, which interval was occu
pied in conversation with visitors and
others ut the desks of the Senators.
Senator Dickinson was the first to speak.
He presented the temporary rules, the
significant one of which was that the
standing committees should be appointed
Jay the Senate, thus conveying to Mr.
Jeter's mind In the most delicate man
ner that precedent would not be observed
in this instance for obvious reasons.
Senator Bert was the author of the first
motion, which was to proceed to the elec
tion of the standing officers.
The h'Tst joke was perpetrated by Sena
tor Langford of San Joaquinâ a good man,
but a Democrat. The Senator had been
nominated Â»Td voted for by tiis colleagues
of ihe Democratic faith for the position of
temporary president. It was a party vote
of 28 to 12, he getting the full dozen.
vVhen the result was announced the Sen
ator rose in his place and inquired inno
cently:
"Mr. Chairman, do I understand that I
am defeated?" His expression was so
funny that everybody laughed.
The Senate sent a committee of three to
notify the Governor that it had organized
and was ready to receive any communica
tion that he might choose to make. The
committee returned and reported that
the Governor was not in his office, and
thai the notification, therefore, could not
be served upon him. Then the Senate
notified the Assembly of the fact of or
ganization and udjourned fin hour or co
before the Assembly had completed its
organization. The committee of that
body sent to notify the Senate of course
could not fulfill its mission, the Senate
not being in session.
The omission to notify the Senate was

contended by many parliamentarians to
invalidate the organization, two of the
essentials of organization â the notifica
tion to the Governor and the notification
by the Assembly to the Senate â having
been omitted. These things, it is claimed,
are as essential factors of organization as
the election of a statutory officer of that
body, and the proposition s t up is that
an organization bad not been established
to-day, and that the election of a United
States Senator would liave to be deferred
for anotuer term.

IN THE ASSEMBLY.
Organization Effected by the Elec-
tion of Coombs as Speaker and
Selection of Minor Officials.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 4.âShana
han of Shasta was a conspicuous cham
pion of the Populist party in the prelimi
nary steps of the Assembly organization
to-day. Shanahan, rosy as the dawn and
fresh as tbe dew, first came in view as a
contestant for recognition against North
of Alameda. Each was prepared to ad
dress Chief Clerk Duckworth, temporarily
presiding, and offer a motion, but the As
sembly proceeded to call the roll of mem
bers. The chair recognized North, and
this recognition excited the representa
tive of Shasta to an outburst of protesta
tions.
The incident was soon passed over and
the Assembly proceeded to organization,
swearing in the new members in con
venient blocks. At the proper time Dib
ble moved for a special committee to pre
pare rules for the government of the
Assembly, the committee to include the
Speaker, Chynoweth, Dibble, McClellan
and McCandish.
In the midst of this serenity there came
a burst of oratory from an unexpected
source. Many members and some of the
spectators had apprehended that North of
Alameda would early in tbe session open
the. floodgates of eloquence, but no one
surmised that North of Yolo would enter
the arena first and challenge all comers to
a parade of pretty Dlatitudes. North did
hold the Assembly spellbound, and at the
close of the speech members and specta
tors generously applauded the spellbinder
from the Yolo tules.
The effect of tbe sneech would have
been heightened if the members had read
ily understood what the orator was talk
ing about. But they obtained a shadowy
impression that he was placing Speaker
Coombs on a high pedestal, and having
about placed him there, was trying to get
down himself. It "Was readily assented to
that Mr. Coombs was in nomination for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
Speaker, and then Bridgeford nominated
Caminetti. The voting went along smooth
ly until S anahan'a name was called, and
then the member from Shasta was con
strained to explain his vote.
Incidentally ne recalled his service in
the Assembly six years ago when Coombs
was Speaker, There the Speaker had so
won his admiration that an infant Shana
han was christened to bear the illustrious
name of Coombs. Yet this admiration
growing briehter and going deeper as the
years advanced was not sufficient to swing
his vote. He explained that the principle
represented by Caminetti bore a "closer
approximate" of .Populists' faith than the
tenets of Coomb?, therefore, he would
vote for Caminetti.
Assemblymen Guy, Bridpeford and
Caminetti performed the agreeable func
tion of escorting Coombs to ttie desk.
Chief Clerk Duckworth administered the
oath and introduced the Speaker.
ProDer applause followed the introduc
tion. The Speaker acknowledged his grati
tude for the compliment and honor be
stowed in his election, and assured his
associatos that he entered upon the duties
of the office without ambition personal to
himself. He offered a few suggestions,
urging early work to complete tue labors
of the session. He thought the general
appropriation bill should be passed ten
days before the close of the session, so
that the tux levy could be accurately
made. He spoke of the extravagent ex
penditures to support public institutions,
and recalled the fact that six years ago he
sought to abolish various commissions,
bui his efforts then resulted in failure. In
closing Speaker Coombs said:
'Every appropriation should be meas
ured by a rule of public necessity. The
public welfare should be a charge on the
honor and ability of members."
The Speaker's opening speech won ap
plause.
Assemblyman L. H. Valentine placed in
nomination for Speaker pro tern. Brewster
C. Kenyon of Sar. Diego. J. K. Burnett,
fusionist, of Paso Rubles, was also put in
nomination. Mr. Kenyon was elected and
acknowledged the compliment in a mod
est speech wherein he likened hiuiseff into
the third wheel of an ammunition wagon,
meaning thereby, the extra wheel of a
caisson and at that he would let it go.
The oath which Duckworth admiuis
tered to Coombs was in turn passed along
and administered by Coombs to Kenyon,
and the latter has it now.
In proper routine along the usual lines
o! organization S. J. Duckworth of Mon
terey was chosen chief clerk, an I \V. O.
Banks, ex-Senator from San Francisco,
was elected sergeant at-arras.
Shanahan of Suasta encountered his
usual distress in an endeavor to throw his
vote strictly on the line of Poouii3tic
principle. He made a gallant stand to
vote for Ga,viuan for Chiei clerk and ended
the struggle by voting for Gallagher. As
the "approximation of the idea he pos
sessed" the gentleman from Shasta ex
plained his political disabilities on the
ground t;at he had to caucus by himself.
The organization was completed by the

ground.
election of assistants. There was some
talk of deferring the election of chaplain,
but it was deemed essential that tbe
chaplain should be on duty to-morrow
morning and so Rev. Charles F. Oehier
was elected. For assistant clerks W. 0.
Hawkett of Alameda and Clark Alberti of
San Diego were chosen.
Landsborouuh of Sacramento, who was
recently indicted by the Grand Jury, was
sworn in, and voted for Speaker, casting
his vote for Caminelti.
The usual resolution was adorned direct
ing the chief clerk to notify the Senate
that tlie Assembly was organized and
ready for business.
Judge Dibble moved that the Governor
be informed that the Assembly was organ
ized, and so a committee, of which Dibble
was chairman, waited on the Governor.
Under the radiance of the electric lights
the Assembly went into (he fight aeainst
the refunding bill. Mr. Belshaw intro
duced one set of resolutions and Mr. Cam
nietti introduced a substitute. Both
measures were referred to a special com
mittee.
The outlook is promising for a fine dis
play of pent-up oratory immediately after
the Assembly convenes to-morrow. There
is a wide difference of opinion on tho
question whether the Government should
foreclose and sell the competing roads or
simply tase and manage the properties.
CALL FOR A CAUCUS.
But Some of the Republican Repre
sentatives Were Induced to
sign by False Pretenses.

Hamilton, Senator Perkins' manager,

did not sign were: Jones, Bettraan, Dibble,
Henry, Dennery. Kobinson, Kelly.
Assemblyman Fohlman, whose name
appears among the number signing the
caucus roll, stated this evening that he
signed the call under a misrepresentation
of the facts ana under a misapprehension
and that he will withdraw i:is name there
from. He was told that all the San Fran
cisco delegation in the Assembly had
signed, whereas the fact was that none of
them had signed at the time the state
ment was made 10 him. It is represented
that many other names were likewise ob
tained by means of representations that
the seventy-four members of the Legisla
ture had agreed to sign it or had signed
the call.
The tactics exhibited by Mr. Hamilton
have aroused a feeling of intense indigna-

tion. Those signatures having been ob
tained fraudulently cannot have any
binding effect and will not be regarded by
tbe members who were thus deceived.
Other members late to-nigbt announced
that they had appended '.heir names to
the call under the same false pretenses,
and declared their intention of taking off
their names. The light is on and will.be
\vu;:ed vigorously from this time until the
end of the con;e-t.
GARBLED THE INTERVIEW.
A Pointed Portion of Charles M.
Shortrldsre's Statement That
the Examiner Left Out.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 4. â The
Examiner had in this morning's issue an
interview with Charles M. Shortridge, part
of which it published and part of which it
suppressed. The suppressed part is really
the best reading of the whole interview.
In oraer tliat the public may be enabled
to jutlge of the reasons why the Examiner
did not publish it in its entirety it is in
serted here:
"I believe his (S. M. Sbortridge's) elec
tion w:ll come as surely as the Legislature
meets. While it may be said by some that
be comes late into t.e tight it cannot
be claimed that he does not come
nooly into it His name will be pre
sented in time for the Legislature of
California to cive it due considera
tion.
"While he is bei:ig fought by the San
Francisco Examiner, which journal, you
will remember, fought Mr. White and
thereby aided in bis election, and while
he is b ing fought by the Sacramento
Record-Union, which thereby notifies the
State that he does not and would not wear
the railroad collar, I am of the opinion
that a majority of the legislators of Cali
fornia will recognize in this position a
strong reason to advocate hu cause.
"There will be plenty of time and ample
opportunity offered to the press and to
the legislators of California to investigate
the record of Samuel M. Shortridge from
his youth up to the present moment.
There will be ample opportunity ottered
for a comparison of ability to serve and
for a decision in His favor. I confidently

the people,"
SENATOR BOYCE'S BILL.
Will Endeavor to Make Klndsrgar-
tons a Part of the Pub Ie
School System.
SACRAMENTO, Ual., Jan. 4.â Among
the new Senators is J. J. Boyce of Santa
Baibara, a sturdy Republican. Mr. Boyce
has just returned from a vacation among
the snows of Mount Shasta, where he lias
been recuperating, his health lately not
being the best by reason of his arduous
work for the Republican party. He comes
back bronzed and rugged looking, although
not quite himself again. He has taken
much interest in educational matters in
his own beautiful county and also in the
remainder of the State, and will early in
the session introduce a bill making tne
kindergarten a part of the public school
system. He tells an interesting story of a
school in his own town which will illus
trate the value of kindergarten methods
in the school system.
In that lovely village by the placid sea
is a millionaire spinster and a school sup
ported altogether by her private purse.
The story goes to the effect that about ten
years ago the lady, Miss Blake of Boston,
came to Santa Barbara to recuperate dur
ing the summer. Sue liked the balmy
climate so well, and it liked her so well,
that she kept coming summer after sum
mer, and finally built for herself a cosy
villa at a cost of about $10,000. She also
expended a similar sum in the erection
and titling up of a kindergarten school, in
which the children were taught cooking
and sloyd work, the Yankee instinct of
whittling wood being strong with her. In
order that the school might not lack for a
competent teacher. Miss Blake took in
hand a young woman of that place named
Miss Rich, and sent her to Europe to
study the latest and most desirable and
effective methods of kindergarten work,
and also for the purpose of giving her that
breadth ol mind without which the modern
system of education would be a failure.
The school has done excellent work, and
has proved a blessing to the parents in
that to wn; but the best work it has done
has been to open the eyes of the people to
the necessity of improved kindergarten
schools for the benefit of the young.
Such schools, but not on a scale so per
fect or so extended as that of Santa Bar
bara, are found in the larger cities of the
State, but they are supported wholly by
charitable persons out of their private for
tunes. People who have given the subject
some thought consider that it is repulsive
to the genius of American institutions to
allow the children of citizens to depend
for this particular Kind of instruct on upon
private charity, and they contend that the
kindergarten school should be made a
part of the public school system. It has
proved to be a popular and excellent thing,
and all excellent things in the way of edu
cation should be incorporated into the
school system.
"The people of Sania Barbara," said
Senator Boyce, "are modest and do not
ask much Irom tbe State. They do not
want an insane asylum or a reform Â«c;io(.;l,
because they have none of that kind of
peopie there, and do not want that kind
of i eople to swell the roll of the popula
tion.
"Warden Aull told me a year ago that
the islands of the coast of Sania Barbara
are ideal locations for penal institutions,
the climate being perlect as to healthful
ness and the ocean being the best sale
guard against escape or attempts at
escape. But, as I said before, we are not
asking anything from tbe Mate except
that tbe kindergarten shall be made a
part of the public school system or that a
portion of the school fund shall be sdt
apart for helping to maintain them and
not allow the burden to rest upon the
shoulders of the sood people who have
devoted their time and money to estab
lish and maintain them."

the subject of the hearing before the Com
mittee on Ways and Means this mornir<t*.
Michael Tobin of Baldwinsville, N. V.,
said that up to within a few years the to

to within a few years the, tobacco section
of New York crew some 35.000 cases of to
bacco annually, while now the production
has fallen to about 12,000 cases.
It was not fair, he said, that their
dangerous rival, the Holland syndicate,
employing labor at 10 0r,12. cents day,
should* be allowed to annihilate and ruin
a domestic industry of such magnitude. â¢â 
Other manufacturers' and growers of

which visited this city Sunday stili con
tinues, arid while comparatively little
snow has fallen, the wind drifts what has
fallen and impedes traffic. Snowplows
and road sciapers Have been constantly on
the go all day. The thermometer has
ranged from zero to five degrees above.
Reporfs from Huron and other points in
South Dakota show thirteen inches of
snow. A special to the World-Herald
from Vermilion, S. D., states that the
wind has drifted the snow lrom ten to
twenty feet in places.
Three stockmen are reported to have

wind have played havoc with the trains.
The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and
Omaha is blocked north of Elair, and no
iruins came in from Sioux City or went
there to-day over lhat road. The Sioux
City trains came down on the lowa side of
the river over the Sioux City and Pacific
road. The Union Pacific branch trains
were running, but all main line trains
were late this afternoon. Eastern, West
ern and Southern trains arrived from ten
to forty-five minutes late. Rock Island
trains from Denver were laid out by the
snow, and a stub train went east this aft
ernoon from Omaha.
Telegraph wires are working very badly
throughout the West and Easi, as well as
Nortii, each road doing nearly all of its
business over one wire.
â  The Union Pacific snowplows are break

Island branches.
TOPEKA, Kans.. Jan. 4.â The railroads
of Kansas aru suffering badly from the
snowstorm. All trains are iate, and in
some places traffic is entirely blockaded.
In places the drifts are bit and ten feet
high. At Lamed the snow is four feet
deep on the level.
Santa l"c passenger trains 5, 14 and 6
were stalled over ten hours between
Dodge City and NicKerson yesterday. An

delayed to-day.
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 4.â Central
lowa has been in the throes of a blizzard
the past eighteen hours. Snow has been
falling, a high wind nas prevailed and tbe
mercury has fallen about ihirty degrees,
standing now several points below zero.
The Weather Bureau predicts continued
cold and that the storm will last another
day. About eight inches of snow has
fallen and it is drifting fast. Wires are
badly interfered with in many directions
and the railroads are beginning to have
difficulties in moving trains. Thers are
delays on all lines out of here and a num
b r have been abandoned on account of
inability to make connections.
HURON, S. Dak , Jan. 4.â The heaviest
snow and wind storm since 1888 has pre
vailed here and over this part of tbe State

that it will cease before to-morrow. The
temperature is below zero and the wind
comes from the north at sixty miles an
hour. Fifteen inches of snow has fallen,
filling the railway cuts and piling drifts
ten to fifteen feet high. All trains on the
Dakota Central division of the Chicago

Northern trains are abandoned and no
effort will be made to move trains on
either line until the storm abates. The
telegraph service is interrupted. Suffer

The United State* Supreme Court Upset*
n Conviction.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. I._ The
efforts of counsel to secure judgment from
the Supreme Court of the United States
upon the constitutionality of the law for
i he suppression of lottery traffic in the
prosecution of Aibe-t L. France et al.
indicted for conspiracy for violating the
act by trafficking in lottery slips and
drawings between Cincinnati and Coving
ton, Ky., were not successful.
The court of the Southern District of
Ohio found the defendants guilty. They
appealed to the Supreme Court of the
United States. The case was argued by
James C. Barter for the defendants and
by Assistant Attorney-General Whitney
for the Government, the arguments being
devoted to the question of the constitution
ality of the law.
"But," said Justice Peckham, disposing
of the case to-day, "the court did not rind
it necessary to pass upon the constitution
ality of the law-, for in the opinion of the
court the acts complained of, the carryina
of papers used in lottery drawings did not
con titute an offense prohibited by
statute. The conviction is therefore re
versed and the discharge of the defendants
ordered.

Correspondencs Between Minis
ter Taylor and Secretary
0 ney Leaks Out.
The Spanish Government Keenly Feels
Its Sacrifice of Life an I
Treasure.
NEW YORK, X. V., Jan. 4.â A special
to tne Tribune from Washineton says:
Is General Weyler to be succeeded as
Governor-Genernl of Cuba? There are
good reasons for giving an affirmative
reply to this question, and ior saying that
officer's day? as a director-in-chief of tbe
Cuban affair^ are numbered.
Recent press dispatches from Madrid
have intimated that Prime Minister Oano
vas, certain members of his Cabinet and
some leading Soanisb papers are dissatis
fied with Weyler's course in Cuba. The
general has accomplished too little as a
soldier to please ihe authorities and press
at Madr.d.
The intimation made that Weyler is to
be called home is not based so much upon
what is being said in Madrid as upon a
report made to the State Department by
Mr. Taylor. Generally what Mr. Taylor
Fays is held in BOCh strict confidence that
little intelligence he conveys reaches the
; Ã¼b:ic. Information has, however, leaked
through that Mr. Taylor lias informed the
Secretary of Sia:e that General Weyler is
likely to be relieved of bis command at an
early date, and that his successor has been
practically decided upon.
Minister Taylor informed Secretary
Olney se^ral days ago that the author
ities at Madrid were on the point of re
lieving General Weyler of his command
in Cuba and of appointing Primo de
Uievera. Reasons were given in brief
why a change was deemed advisable, and
a statement was made as to the probable
time when the orders would be promulga
ted. It is learned that the Madrid Gov
ernmtnt Is disp eased at the fact that
General Weyler, Â»it 6 about 200, COO
troops, has not put down the Cuban re
volt. He has expended large sums of
money, out so far has made no decided
headway in accomplishing his main ob
ject, that of quelling the insurrection and
restoring peace and good order. His
t'oups have been v.ctorious on occasion?,
but they have also met defeat, and the
total result, considering Spain's outlay in
life and tieasure, is far from satisfactory.
The one great requirement â success â has
not been in; tilled , and Weyler has conse
quently fallen iudisesteem at Madrid.
THE COStaiOUORE WItECK.
Captain- Jlurp/fj *ittj* It Warn a He suit
of >rfiUgrnce.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 4.â Cap- j
taiii Edwin Murphy, the commander of i
the wrecked filibustering steamer Com
modore, and the remainder of those saved
from the wrecs arrived in this city from j
Daytonia to-night. Seven men are still |
missing and are believed to be drowned. |
CaDtain Murphy gives their names as fol- i
lows:
James Reddingan, chief engineer, of
Brooklyn; E. R. Ritton, assistant en
gineer, of Jacksonville, Fla. ; Thomas
Smith, sailor, of Charleston, S. C. ; Jonas
Frankiin (colored), fireman, of Jackson
ville, Fla.; W. A. G. Smith (colored), fire
man of Jacksonville, Fla., and one un
known colored man, who took the place
of Murray Nobles just before the ship
sailed. Besides these William Higgins of
Connecticut is dead, having been drowned
in the surf while landing.
Captain Murphy says that Ritter and
the two colored men were on board the
vessel when she went down and were
drowned. The other men were on a raft,
and the cruiser Newark and steamer
Three Friends, hs well as a fleet of small
boats from tne Halifax River, are now
hunting for them. The Newark went to
the scene Sunday night and used her
powerful searciilight, but to no effect. It
is now believe l the men are all drowned.
Captain Murphy's story of the sinking of
the Commodore is as follows:
At midnight Friday the engineer re
ported that the vessel was leaking badly
and the water was rapidly rising in the
ho!d. The pumps could not be made to
work, for they were choted and the s-uc
tion was gone. The men were put to
work with buckets bailing, and wood, oil
and alcohol was pat in the furnace to
keep up steam aud get the vessel to the
shore if possible. The water eained in
spite of the efforts of the men, and before
the vessel ran three miles the lires were
extinguished.
Anchor was then dropped and the boats
iauncheri. In the first were Major Del
â rado, Paul Rojo, Felix de Los Rios,
Emilia Marquis. Ventuna Linares, Romeo
Hernandez, J. Franco 31anco, Jose Her
nandez, T. B. Benier, Leno Soldno, <i:i
briel Martinez and Santiago Diaz. In the
second boat were: Juho Rodriguez Boz,
Manuel Gonzales, Louis Sierra Meaios
and Jesus Alvarez. The first left imme
diately, but the other stood by to render
assistance if needed.
Later another boat was launched and
Mate Grain and seven men entered it.
This was stove in before they got nway
from tlie ship. The men climbed back on
board and built a raft. All pot on it and
the raft was taken in tow by the dingy,
in which were Captain Murphy, Step: en
(rune, C. B. Montgomery and William
Higsins. The heavy sea caused the raft
to break loose twice, and the last time it
was carried out to sea.
The captain and companions landed
Sunday morning, Del-ado and party
landed Sunday nieht and Julio Boz and
party landed Sunday night. Nothing has
been seen of the raft since it drifted out
of sight of Captain Murphy. When asked
if there was treachery on board Captain
Murphy said to-tight: "No, Ido not
think so. It was neglect more than any
thing else."
C. B. Monteomery, the steward, still in
sists that there was treachery, but he can
not definitely place it on any one.
Paul Rojo, tlio Cuban commander, said
co-night: "I think the eDginepr was
drunk and neglected his duties. When I
went below I found the pumps would not
heave water and that the injectors which
Â»re used to inject kero-ene in the fire in
sase of emergency when steam is needed
were not put on. 1 asked him why. He
rmtdittd that he iiAd ordered them put on,
adding that he would nave them put on
immediately. I went above and returned
in iive minutes. They were not then on.
He had made no effort to put them on."
WHAT VOSSI-I1 UTtSa PIttACT.
Eminent Lnwyra lÂ»iÂ»cuÂ»* the Case of
th* Thru* .Frfenrf*.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 4. â Al
though there has been no determination
to that effect the possibility of the Gov
ernment prosecuting the Three Friends on
a charge of piracy has been discussed and
men learned in the law have been quietly
looking up the matter.
Senator Davis of Minnesota, one of the
best authorities in the Senate on inter
national law, says the question is quite
plafn and that no principle is more plain
than that for prosecution for piracy the
vessel must be manned and equipped for
robbery on the high seas.
Whatever might have been tbe mission
of the Three Friends, no man, he says,
will contend that this was the case. The
fact that she when cornered may have
tired at the Spanish gunboats does not
make her a pirate either undsr inter
national laws or the rulings of our own
courts.
Senator White of California took similar
grounds. Mr. White stoutly defended the
Itata, similarly charged at the time of the
Chilean troubles, and he cites as abundant
authority the declaration in Mr. Cleve
land's message of December 8, 1885, with
relation to the alleged Colombian pirates.
The President at that time declined to
consider such expeditious as piratical.
The Colombian Government, in order
to break diwn its own insurgents, pro
claimed the closure of certain ports and
declared tiie vessels held by the insurgents
to be piratical. The United States de
clined to assent to this doctrine, and the
President set forth the declaration in the
message. Senator White held tliatin view
of Mr. Cleveland's message and the deci
sion of the courts the charge of piracy
against the Three Friends could not be
maintained.

such a misdemeanor and place himself
outside the pale of the law. Such an act
I would be unpardonable in a person whose
duty is to know and respect the laws of
the country he visits. If it is a serious
offense lor other Americans to visit the in
surgent camp it is still worse for one to do
so who represents his country in its Par

Hr. Money returned to Havana this
evening. All efforts <o learn from him
where he h.id been were fruitless, he de
clining to say anything that would tend to
disclose his whereabouts ?ince he disap
peared. The general opinion is tl at he
had been within the rebel lines to seek the
information he desired, but there is no
way of proving tnis belief.
Consul-General Lee is authority for the
statement that Mr. Money lias no connec
tion with the Cuban Junta in New York.
This statement is made in view of the fact
that a report has been circulated that Mr.
Money is an agent of the Junta or has
some connection with that body. General
Lee adds that Mr. Money made tbe trip to
Cuba for pleasure and to obtain informa
tion within lawful limits of (he condition
of the country in order to enable him to
speak with authority.
Last Saturday Lee says he was invited
to visit the town of San Jose de Las Lajas,
some fifteen miles southeast of Havana,
in order to see the country. He ' went
there that day and remained until to-day.
He remained in the town during nis en
tire stay and saw no rebels.
The Maiquis de Palmerola, secretary to
the Governor-Genera 1 , the civil' Governor
of the province of Havana. Chief of Police
Barriera and Inspector of Police Perrez,
made a visit yesterday to the town of
Guanabacoa, a suburb of Havana, which
place was recently attacked by rebels.
The object of their visit was to inspect
the town and the new fortiticatious in
course of construction there. They were
received- by the members of the Town
Council, who escorted tnem on their tour
of inspection. The party subsequently
visited tha hospital of the Sisters of Char
ity and expressed them-elves as highly
pleased with the condition maintained
there.
General Luque reports from Cienfneeos
that his command met 1500 rebels at Mar
roquin, province of Sania Clara, and after
a long tigUt compelled them to retreat.
No mention is made of the losses on either
side.
Four hundred rebel cavalrymen, com
manded by Mnximo Gomez, the insurgent
commander-in-chief, made attacks at
Santa Teresa ani other places upon a
Government convoy.
The Spanish forces comprised artillery,
and the charges of the rebe!3 were met
with volleys of grape-shot, which caused
havoc in their rank?. It is calculated that
100 of the insurgents were killed. The
Spanish losses are said to have been only
a captain and a private killed and thirteen
wounded. The convoy has arrived at
Arroyo Blanco.
Colonel Asina reports that he has dis
persed several rebel parties at Brugitos,
province of Pinar del Rio. Nine insur
gents were killed. The troops destroyed
over 100 houses and a number of planta
tions. They also captured 205 persons
who were living in the fields.
It is said that General Gonzalez Munoz

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
RAPID RUN OF "THE CALL'S" SPECIAL TRAIN
At Times a Speed of Seventy Miles an Hour Was
Attained in the Successful Effort to Deliver
Copies of the Live Newspaper at the
Capital Over Five Hours Ahead
of Competitors.
Ninety-five miles in almost as many minutes was tbe record for fast railroading established yesterday morning by
The Call's special train during the run from the Oakland Mole to Sacramento.
It was just 4:13 o'clock when the last of the many bundles of copies of The Morning Call wan transferred from the
tug Millie to the train at Long Wharf. An instant later Conductor J. L. Whissen gave the signal and engine 1409 with
"Kid" Small at the throttle was darting rapidly forward.
â¢'We are going to make a lively trip, very lively," said the genial conductor as the rounding of a curve seated him
rather precipitously. "Kid Small is one of the famous engineers of the road, p.nd if he don't break all records this
morning it will not be his fault."
Port Costa was reached at 4:45 o'clock. The bie ferry-steamer Solano was in waiting, and before the wheels of the
cars had ceased to revolve after running aboard the steamer was conveying the train across the waters of the San Pablo Bay.
No time was lost in leaving Benicia, and from thence on, the tract beinc without any extensive curves, Engineer
Small gradually increased the speed until the half dozen passengers aboard the train held their breath in suspense, won
dering what would occur next. After leaving Benicia, the first seven miles were covered in seven minutes, the last two miles
being at the rate of over sixty-five miles an hour. Still faster sped the train, and the rate of speed had been increased to
at least seventy miles an hour when suddenly there was a shrill whistle, and a few moments later the train came to a
standstill at Elraira. Going forward to ascertain the cause of the delay, the conductor was informed that there was a hot
box on the epgine. This matter was remedied easily, but it caused a loss of time of tive minutes.
Being determined to overcome all obstacles and make up for the brief loss of time, the daring engineer was soon

going at the rate of over a mile a minute. One can form a very good idea of the rapidity with which the train moved
when it is stated that it only required seven minutes and thirty-six seconds to reach Dixon, a distance of nine miles. So
far the performance of the train may well be considered remarkable, because the run was made in the inky blackness of
the night, which is considered quite a handicap by railroad men when efforts are being made to run at the utmost speed.
However, Davisville was reached at 9 minutes to H o'clock. Thence to Sacramento is a distance of thirteen miles, but the
track is straight and the roadbed solid. These assuring circun. stances gave "Kid" Small renewed courage, and so greatly
did he increase the speed :hat the Sacramento River was crossed at 2 minutes alter (> o'c'ock. Thus it will tie seen *hat the
last thirteen miles of the run were made in just eleven minute?. From the figures eiven it will be noted that the gross
time occupied in the run from the bay to the State capital was just one hour and forty-nine minutes. Deducting five min
utes for the delay at Elmira the actual time consumed in the journey was one hour and forty-four minutes.
The record for fast time between San Francisco and Sacramento is one hour and thirty-six minutes, but this per
formance was accomplished in daylight. Within five minute? after reaching the Sacramento depot the bundles of Calls
were distributed to agents and carriers, and so before half of the good people of Sacramento had been aroused from their
plumbers The Morsino Call was upon the breakfast-table. In addition to the copies distributed in the manner stated,
Chief Mailing Clerk George Boyne of Tns Call and Will F. Morton, Thomas Shelton and J. Coyle, hi 3 assistants, freely
circulated copies of the paper to every ODe in the business center of the city.
By this means the residents of Sacramento were enabled to receive copies of The Call and read a complete forecast
of the business to be transacted at the opening session of the Legislature mora than five hours before other San Francisco
newspapers arrived.
When the copies of The Call were distributed at the Golden Eagle Hotel there was a small knot of politicians and
office-seekers already assembled in the lobby and on the sidewalk. These men freely commented on the enterprise of The
San Francisco Morning Call in furnishing the news of the day more than rive hours ahead of competitors.
"What's the matter with The Call?" asked one young man from the Sierras.
"The Call is all right," replied a well-known law-maker from the southern citrus belt.
"There are no fliej on The San Francisco Call," was the chorus of a crowd of small newsboys, who had sold all
their papers and were in quest of more. And the httlo follows knew just what th?y were talking about.
The track was rather heavy for the other San Francisco morning papers, but The Call sent out its rapid special to
show the people of the State that the enterprising metropolitan journal continues to speak and speed for all.

AOT SUIXG FOR PEACE.
the Cuban Junta Jiepiidittt** Jtumort
From Upanith Sources.
MADRID, Spain, Jan ; 4.â A dispatch
from Havana says it is expected that
Maximo Gomez and other insurgent lead
ers will Â«oon make overtures to the Spanish
military authorities in Cuba with a view
of securing favorable te^ms of surrender.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 4.â The Cuban
Junta here discredits the story sent from
Madrid that Gomez wishes to sue for peace.
Tney say that Gomez is stronger than
ever, and will lastas long as the Spaniards.
They feel greatly encouraged by the dip
patch, because it indicates Spanish weak
ness in having to send out misleading
reports about (he Cuban nrruy. The Junta
people assert that they have very late news
from Gomez and that be is as determined
to carry on the war there as ever.

HAVANA. Cuba, Jan. 4â Several de

while reconnoiterins at Montes, Cazaiso
and otber places, have destroyed over 400
huts of all kinds and demolished all of the
forage and other resources of the enemy
south ot Lejas and Pilato Hills. The de

three of whom were killed. The troops
suffered no losses.

THE v iLij'vi* e n etojct.
Making : Such .JOradwny . That Spain Is
I'raetieall}/ J'nwerln*.
NEW YORK, Iff. V., Jan. 4.-A Herald
special from Washington says: The prov
ince of Cavite is now the principal strong
hold of the rebels, and â¢ the mail reports
which have reached here show that they
are strongly intrenched in the village of
lmus, which is nearly impregnable. The
province of Cavue contains about SOO.OCO
souls, and nineteen out of twenty-two
villages are held by the rebels. Cubans
in lira city, who cave bÂ«en closely watch
ing the Philippine trouble, say that Spain
will not be ab:e 10 put down the rebellion
in the east without the most extensive ex
penditure, supplied with the latest imple
ments of warfare.
The report that the Japanese are secretly
supplying the insurgents with arms and
ammunition is pronounced by the Japa
nese legation in Washington to be with
out foundation in fact. In the first place,
no firearms are manufactured in Japan
except by end for the Government itseif,
which is certainly not supplying any of
its output for the purposes mentioned.
No tn<llic in firearms is being carried on
by individuals for the use of the people of
the Philippines.
The presence of a Japanese warship in
the vicinity of the Philippines is of no
significance. The ship that is now re
ported to be in those waters is an old
wooden steam frigate, inadequately armed,
which has been used as a training-ship
for many years and is at present on a
practice cruise.
The Mikado is particularly desirous o!
establishing friendly relations with the
Spanish Government, and Mr. Kurino,
formerly Minister to the United Stales, is
now in Madrid endeavoring to negotiate a
treaty of amity, commerce and navigation
similar to those already ratified by the
United States and the European powers,
except .Spain and Portugal, and several
South American countries. He reports,
however, that his mission is meeting with
little surcets, and his presence at the
Spanish court is regarded as a blind to the
real attitude and intentions of Ihe Japa
nese, who are understood by the Spanish
to be playing the cards for the acquisition
of the port of Lacon.
While the disposition of the Japanese
is unqualifiedly to preserve neutrality
aud amicable relations, it is stated that in
case of continued outrages or. the part of
the Spanish or in the event of increased
anarchy in the Philippines, or a call on
them for aid from the insurgents of the
islands, the Mikado is not likely. to exer
cise the forberarance that the United
States is now preserving in the Cuban
difficulty. Arms and men might be fur
nished openly, and should the struggle
develop unfavorably to Spain and the
partition of the Philippine colonies be
imminent, the Japanese would doubtless
be on the lookout for their share. For the
present, however, every effort will be
made to preserve neutrality and to pre
vent aid being given against Spain, either
directly or indirectly, by Japanese sub
jects.

FOR A PLACE IN THE CABINET.
California's Congressional Delegation Has
Another Conference â Judge McKenna
May Be Selected.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 4.â The Re
publican members of the California dele-
gation in Congress met this morning in
the committee-rooms of Representative
Loud, at the request of Senator Perkins.
These statesmen again discussed the de
sirability of uniting in a memorial to
President-elect McKiniey asking that
Horace Davis of San Francisco be ap
pointed a member of the Cabinet. This
meeting, like former ones, was secret.
Newspaper representatives were exclud
ed on motion of Grove Johnson, where
upon Representative Loud said he must
refuse to take part in the caucus. He said
lie believed it wise to admit newspaper
correspondents so that they might obtain
accurate reports of the meeting, rather
than have to depend upon hearsay testi
mony of the representatives. He said
that it has been demonstrated in the past
that it was far better to admit press men
than have inaccurate reports telegraphed.
Mr. Loud, therefore, positively refused to
participate in the meeting.
At the conclusion of the conference the
following statement was made Dy the
chairman. Senator Perkins:
"The rlelttratlor. met and after a confer
ence came to the conclusion that they saw
no reason to recede from their former posi
tion, but out of deference to the views of
prominent Republicans of California with
whom they are at present in communica
tion they concluded to take no further
action ai the present time."
The Californians wrangled for an honr
or more before they decided not to recede
from their recomnienilation of Horace
DnvK All of those present, however,
including Senator Perkins and Repre
sentatives Johnson, â¢ Hilborn, Bowers,
Barham and McLachlan, finally decided
to stand pat on Davis.
The memorial will not, however, be
sent to Major AicKinley immediately,
but, "in deference to the views of promi
nent California Republicans," will be held
up for the time being.
This means that Judge Waymire's
friends are making a bie racket, and for
prudential reasons it is deemed besl by
the statesmen not to take any real action
in the mntter until the Legislature has
elected a United States Senator.
It matters very little, however, what the
Californians may recommend. The Call
correspondent at a late hour to-night
secured what is believed to be a positive
assurance that President-elect McKiniey
will ask United States Circuit Judge Mc-
Kenna to become a member of his Cabi
net. He will probably offer bim the
Attorney-Generalship.
This news was wired exclusively to The
Call ten days ago, and recent develop
ments have confirmed its correctness.
Indeed, it was agreed in the conference
of the Californians tc-day that if any
Californian was honored with a Cabinet
position that man would be McKenna.
This seemed to be satisfactory nil around
the table, although they s;tibbornly re
fused to back down from their former
recommendation of Davis. One of the
members said:
"We felt chagrined that our former dis
interested action in meeting to recom
menrl a Cabinet officer for California
should have been criticized by Republi
cans, but we will stand by our recom
mendation of Mr. Davis."
It is now the unanimous opinion of
Californians here that Judge McKer.na
will be offered the Attorney-Generalship,
and he will accept it with the under
standing that he will be appointed
to the United States Supreme
bench to succeed Justice Field if
there should be a vacancy on that bench
during President McKinley's administra
tion. Justice Field is very feeble. A
Califominn who visited him on Saturday
said to The Call correspondent to-day
that he would not be surprised at any
time to hear of his life being snuffed out
like a candle.
SUICIDE OF A BANK CASHIER.
Deliberately Drowns Himself After a Short-
age of $60,000 /s Discovered in
His Accounts.
BALTIMORE, Ma, Jan. 4.â Richard D.
Cornelius, one of the oldest and best
known bank cashiers of this city, com
mitted suicide to-day.
His body was found in the duck rtond in
Druid Hiil Park iust a few hours after the
shortage of $60,000 had been discovered la
his accounts at the National Farmers' and
Plnnters' Bank.
Last Saturday Bank Examiner Marshall
Winchester drew the attention of the
officers of the bank to some irregularities
in the accounts of an out-bf-town institu
tion.
This morning Mr. Cornelius was asked
to explain the irregularities. He did not
attempt to do so, but abruptly walKed off.
A closer examination of his accounts dis
closed an apparent shortage of $60,000.
When the officers of the bank learned
that the cashier bad left the building they
telephoned to Smith. Weston and Lyon,
the detectives, to hunt him up. Mr.
Weston traced the defaulter to Druid Hiil
Park and thence to the duck pond. There
they found his body floating In three feet
of water. The man had evidently held
himself to the bottom of the pond by the
weeds that grew there.
Cornelius was about 58 years of age and
had been connected with the National
Farmers' and Planters' Bank for over
forty-two years. ' He was a close friend of
the late Enoch Pratt, who wa3 president
of the bank for almost iilty years.
The matter caused more excitement in
the banking district than any other event
in years. For many years Mr. Cornelius
had been very prominent in Methodism,
and at the time of his death was
a local preacher of the Balti
more Conference, president of the
City Missionary and Church Extension
Society, president of the Emery Grove
Association, ono of the trustees of the
Baltimore annual conference, and :i mem
ber of the official board of Madison
Church. He attended divine worship
twice yesterday.
The National Farmers' and Planters'
Bank is one of the oldest and one of the
strongest in the city.

ST. LOUIS, Mo, Jan. 4.â Public Ad
ministrator Richardson and a few legal
heirs of the late J. B. McCullash made a
partial inventory of the effects of the de
ceased to-day. In a safety deposit box
$3000 in money and mining stock of the
face value of $1,000,000 was found. This
stock is worth but $00. The tnirty shares
of Globe-Democrat stock, worth $(>O.OOO.
were not found. His desk in his office in
the Globe- Democrat building is full of per
sonal papers, and there the Adminutrator
hopes to find a clew to the securities and
money he was believed to hold when he
died. By agreement of the Administra;or
and heirs, there will be no public sale of
the property found. Mr.' McCuuagh was
one of nine brothers, most of whose fami
lies live in Ireland, and if no will is found
tney will share in the property.

THREE ST. PAUL
BANKS SUSPEND
Solvent Concerns, but Com
pelled to Give Way
to a Panic.
V ' Depositors Swoop Down on the
Institutions Like a Herd
of Wolves.
'': The Tronbie Precipitated by the Fail
ure of the Ftur Banks in
M nner po is
ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 4.â The Ger
mania, the Allemania and West Side
banks, all doing business as State banks,
to-day closed their doors. The iailure of
the Bank of Minnesota December 23
caused unrest in the community and de
, â¢ positors withdrew their money from these
three banks to such an extent that they
were forced to the wall because they had
not fuuds enough immediately in band to
â¢ â¢ meet the demands made upon them.
Each ot the three is solvent and in time
â  will reorganize as soon as the money lor
the purpose can be got into use. The di
rectors of the Germania met this evening
for that purpose. The Germania is in the
â¢ . hands of P. M. Kerst as assignee and the
other two are in the hands of Bank Ex
aminer Kenyon. A receiver will be ap
pointed for the Allemania to-morrow and
the West Side Bank will try to make ar
rangements witti its creditors and reopen
without the intervention of a receiver.
The last official statement of the Ger
mania showed total resources of $1,625,768,
$253,847 of this being in the building and
$975,420 in loans and discounts. Liabili
.â¢ ties $1,625,768. including $400,000 capital
stock and $633,019 in time certificates of
deposit. Deposits subject to check,
$445,191.
Ihe closing of the Germania was in
pursuance of the action of the directors on
Saturday night, who concluded to protect
their depositors by suspending. President
Vvillius prepared a statement, in which he
said:
Just as soon as the result of the Presidential
election became known matters began to im
prove in a remarkable degree, aud there did i
not seem to be any doubt that on May 1 tho
bank would bo so sound and impregnable that
an assessment could be successfully made on
the stock. This was the situation until De
cember 22, when the suspension of the Bank
of Minnesota occurred, lollowins immediately
' â  â¢ upon the failure of the Bank of Illinois, which
came as unexpectedly as a stroke of lightning
in midwinter. Four Minneapolis banks fail-
Ing increased the panicky feeling, but I did
not fear any disastrous outcome until it be
came apparent that certain evil-disposed per
sons maliciously directed their attention to
.ward the Gerraania Bank, circulating false
and manufactured reports regarding it from
one end of the city to the other with sys
tematic persistency.
1 hoped from day to day that the excite
ment would subside and make room lor better
judgment, but it grew iv intensity. The at
tack oecaine bolder every day. After the close
of business on Saturday, the 2d of January, we
found that the withdrawal oi deposits had
assumed such proportions that we did not feel
justified in receiving deposits or paying out
money without submitting the condition of
affairs to the dhectors. Accordingly we called
a meeting of the board for that purpose. We
had paid off nearly #225,000 deposits in nine
business day?, and kept ou hand and in re
serve Something over $100,000 in cash, which
shows the unreasonableness oi the panic.
The directors, after having weighed the
matter in all its bearings, came unanimously
to the conclusion that the nction of the officers
had been correct, iind that however deplorable
it might be, it became their duty for the pro
. tection of all depositors aud other creditors to
close the doors and to place the assets oi the
bank in charge of an assignee.
The Allemania closed a few minutes be
fore 11 o'clock, with a crowd of depositors
clamoring at the paying-teller's window
fur their money. President Scheffer said:
Our suspension is due to the large number
of withdrawals this morning and the fact that
most new depositors witnheld their deposits.
The news of tne suspension cf our neighbor,
the Germania, precipitated the run here, and
of course With all the deposits being withheld
and the fact that there was a steady with
drawal we could not stem the tide. When the
full force of the Germouia's failure burst on
them they seemed to become panic-stricken
and they came down on us like a wolf on the
foid.
When the Bank of Minnesota failed the
business men fortunately were not much dis
turbed and few were caught. The feeling of
ease returned shortly aud might have con
tinued had it not been for the fallare of the
fonr banks in Minneapolis. Then the panicky
feeling came back and was intensified by the
fact that the business men then caught it very
badly. The feeling very naturally spread over
here and the people nave not been easy since.
When the Germania closed its doors this morn,
ing that was the last straw in the case and
they came down on us like a herd of woives.
The total resources of the Allemania, ac
cording to the last report, were $1,061,009,
including $706,842 of loans and discounts,
Liabilities $1,061,009, including capital
stock of $400,000 and deposits of $329,789.
Speaking of the failure of the West Side
Bank President Staples said:
Our suspension was due to the Allemania.
We did all of our clearing through the Alle
mania and this morning they failed to cover
our clearings and sent them all back on us.
In the meantime the news of the suspension
of the Germania and Allemania spread
through West St. Paul and our depositors be
gau scrambling in and demanding their
money. We could not refuse and in a little
while there was a good-sized run on the bank.
We were obliged to close up to save ourselves.
The official statement of the West Side
Bank made to the State Bank Examiner
on December 17 is as follows: Total assets,
$217,014 17; of this $150,000 was in loans
and dUconnts and $23,000 in real estate.
The total deposits were $113,546. The fur
niture and fixtures represented $2200 and
bills rediscounted $1500.
There was a considerable run on the
three savings banks during the afternoon,
but aJI gave depositors notice that they
must give sixty days' notice before with
drawing funds. All are perfectly solvent
and the action of the depositors was
wholly due to the generally panicky feel
ing.
".IWAITIAG IHE COMPTJtOIihJEH."
Notice Fonttd by a Suspended Horth
Hakota Hank.
DEVILS LAKE, N. D., Jan. 4.â The
Merchants' National .Bank did not open
its doors this morning. The notice posted
was, "Bank closed; awaiting the action of
thÂ» Comptroller."
A numb?r of depositors drew their
money Saturday. A county deposit of
$4500 was in the bank and was called for to
day, when the new Treasurer took charge.
This, together with the prospect of a gen
eral run and the non-arrival of a train,
owing to the blizzard, with additional
currency, probably caused the decision of
Cashier Wemple not to open the doors.
The last statement showed deposits of
$47,000; bills payable, $7500. and discounts,
stocks and securities, sss,ooo; cash, $12,500.
A PRINCE OF SWINDLERS.
Wanted in Many Cities of This Country
for Either Forgery, Embezzle
ment or Bigamy.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 4.â "Count" Gins;
lemo J. do Juster, alias Dr, Juster, alias
Dr. Frank S. Rhodes, said to be a Rouma
nian of excellent family, and who pro
fesses to be 3tu(lyine dentistry in America,
was arrested in this city to-dcy.
He is said to be wanted for several
offenses in Buffalo, N. V.. New York City,
Brooklyn, Boston, Leadville, Colo., and
Denver. Wife abandonment, embez
zlement, forgery, swindling, big
amy and obtaining money under
false pretense are some of the specific
charges for which he is wanted in various
parts of the country, and it is believed
that he has obtained in all about $100,
--000 by his alleged illegal methods since
he came to America three years ago.
The prisoner is a young man dressed in
the height of fashiou, and lias stopped at
the best hotels in all the cities he has vis
ited. In Chicago he has lived at the
Auditorium Annex and the Lexington,
aud posed as a man of means.
He claims to be a member of a noble
Roumanian family, and came here three
years ago to study dentistry. He came to
Philadelphia first, where he is saia to
have attended the medical school of the
university, and afterward entered the
Harvard dental school.
It is alleged he fled from Boston after
he had been detected in a number of
swindling scnemes. He then went to
Brooklyn, where he married the daughter
of a prominent jeweler of that city.
Soon afterward, it is said, he went to
Buffalo and there, after cultivating an ac
quaintance, obtained money to the ex
tent of $1500 by fraud. He again returned
to his wife in Brooklyn and lived in style.
He was in tronble there a number of
times, and it is alleged his wife paid out
nearly $2000 to keep him out of jail. Ho
deserted his wife August 21 of last year
and went West.
Leadville was his first stoppins-place,
and ho is charged with swindling a citi
zen of that place out of a house and lot.
He is also wanted there on several charges
of forgery.
Going from there to Denver he con
tinued bis fraudulent methods. White
there he assumed the name of Frank S.
Rhodes and posed as a gentleman of great
wealth. He fled from that city and came
to Chicago.
Boon after his departure Chief of Police
Russell of Denver learned of the numerous
swindles he had perpetrated, nnd sent his
de-cription to the police of this city.
Here, while in dire distress after having
been ejected from two prominent Hotels
for non-payment of bills, he met Belle
Cults* who the police say is an ad
venturess, and a marriage with her soon
followed.
He owed a number of liverymen, and
warrants had been sworn out lor his arrest.
He pawned his wife's jewelry and seal
skins to pay his annoying debts.
He then concealed himself in a house
on Wabash avenue to escape the police,
and borrowed considerable money from
his landlady, promising to return it to
her when he got his remittance from the
old country.
After his arrest he did not deny his
identity and was locked up. The Brook
lyn authorities were immediately
notified of the capture and n tele
gram was received from P. H. Corr
of the Corr Detective Agency of
that city requesting the Chicago police to
hold the prisoner until extradition papers
can be secured. He will bi turned pver to
the Brooklyn authorities as soon as an
officer arrives, and will be prosecuted
there, it is caid, on the charge of wife
abandonment.
THE REVENUE-CUTTER SERVICE.
Secretary Carlisle Warmly Praises Us Effi
ciency and Shows Its Value to
the Government
NEW YORK, N. Y./Jan. 4.â A Tribune
special from Washington says:
Secretary Carlisle has written some com
plimentary criticism of the revenue-cutter
serv cc. In a report on the subject the
Secretary says, among other things, that
the general and varied work of the service
abundantly commends its value and effi
ciency as a branch of the Government.
There has not been a similar period in the
history of the service, he states, when,
witb old and badly appointed vessels an 1
depleted personnel, its resources have
been po severely taxed as they were dur
ing the year just closed. Yet, with the
numerous calls made upon the service, it
has ably performed important work in
trusted to it, and an incomparable record
of service rendered is presented. The re
port says:
An active patrol of the coast line, rivers and
harbors of the United Stales, especially on tlie
sea, gulf and great lakes, has been maintained,
and in the performance of this work the ves
sels of the service htsvo cruised an aggregate of
307,133 iiÃutic-'l miles arid boarded and exam
ined 20,250 vessels of the merchantman ma
rine, of which number 645 were reported to
the proper authorities for violation of the
United .States customs and navigation laws,
incurring penalties in the Bum of $210,941.
During the year 67 vessels, with 694 persons
onboard in actual distress were assisted, the
value of the vessels and their cargoes amount
ing to $1,011,807.
Referring to the Bering Sea fleet Secre
tary Carlisle says :
The able captains and other officers and the
faithful crews ot the service, under the skillful
direction of theotticers in command, met every
emergency and are deserving of the highest
consideration and oraise. This fleet has
cruised over 100,000 nautical miles, boarded
and examined 116 different ypssels, of which
number 66 were engaged in fur-sealing.
The Secretary recommends the creation
of a retired list of commissioned officprs.
He also recommends that section 4457 of
the Revised Statutes (act of April 18. 1814)
be amended so as to read as foliows:
The enlisted men of the revenue cutter
service of the United Slates, who have been or
may be wounded or disabled while in the
a<:ual discharge of their duties, shall be en

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. Iâ An evening
paper prints the following from its Wash
ington staff correspondent: "The com
mittee is packed in the interest of the
people who control the Pacific roads, and
it is useless to hope for a favorable report
on my resolution."
I had asked Senator Pettigrew if he
thought the Senate Committee on Pacific
roads would make a favorable report on
his resolution to appropriate $10,000,000 to
take up the Union Pacific Railway Com
pany's six per cent trust notes. He
replied as quoted. Then he said:
"That is pretty strong language. I don't
think I ought to use it. Still, it b the
truth, and 1 shall say it on the floor of
the Senate if occasion requires. I don't
say that every member of the committee
is under the control of the road, but I do
lay that a majority of the committee is
'packed' and will not report legislation
adverse to the people controlling the
roads."
"Senator Morgan suggested that the
committee sit during the holiday recess.
Has it done so?"
"No," Senator Pettigrew replied, "Sen
ator Gear, the chairman, said that he
would have a meeting to consider the
resolution if he could get a quorum. But
he tells me that he was unable to cret a
quorum, so that tliere was no meeting."
''What are you going to do about it?"'
"Wait until the funding bill comes up
and I will move to add my resolution as
an amendment, unless I get it up in some
other way."
"Upon what contention do you base
your resolution?"
"On this: Suppose you owned a river
which received most of its water from
tributaries on either side along its course.
Suppose some one directs those tribu
taries to another river running in tho
same direction so that your only supply
is from the head of the river. It would
damage the value of your river very
much by lessening its navigable powers.
WÂ»U, take the Union Pacific road. The
richest source of its revenue are from its
Dranch lines. Suppose the business of
those branch line-< should be given to a
rival line, parelleling the Union Pacific.
The latter would suffer greatly, would It
not?"
â¢'Well every one knows of the large
sums of money due the Government from
the Pacific roads. Every one knows, too,
that the time has come lor the Govern
ment to foreclose on the roads. The ma
nipulators el the roads wish <o have the
Government extend the time of payment
of the money due it. Moreover, the ma
nipulators want not only an extension of
time but a lowering of the rate of interest
payable to t;>e Government on the princi
pal. If the Government refuses to extÂ«nd
the time of payment it will foreclose.
But if in selling the main road the
branches are not included the price which
the foreclosure would bring would be com
paratively small.
"The prospect of getting such a small
price would have weight in inducing the
Government to listen more favorably to
the proposition to extend the time of pay
ment, even at a reduced interest. There
fore it is not surprising that these manip
ulators should do whatever they can to
bring such an unpleasant prospect square
before the eyes of the Government,
especially when by so doing they could
feather their own nests, additionally well,
even should the Government foreclose
and sell the main line to some other than
the manipulators to whom I have re
ferred.
"Now, how is this to be done? Just this
way: In 1891 the Union Pacific Railroad
Company issued its 5 per cent gold notes
lor $8,5000,000, or, at least, the principal
and interest amount to that sum. To se
cure these notes the company deposited
j the. bonds and securities of the branch
i lines, as well as those of the main line.
I The notes have been past due for two
I years. The interest has been unpaid, I
understand. It is now proposed on the
part of the owners ot. these notes to fore
close upoii the securities, issue bonds to
the amount of $10,000,000, and issue
$5,000 r OQO worth of Mock, and deliver the
j stock to the people, who take the bonds
j and furnish the money to pay these trust
! notes.
"These securities and bonds of the
i branch roads, eiven for security of the
| trust notes, are on their face worth $93,
000,000. Their market price to-day is, I
am informed, from $35,000,000 to $40,000,
--000. Yet it is proposed to sell them to
pay these trust notes, to get possession of
the branch lines, and then, should the
j Government take possession of the main
! lines of the Union Pacific, divert the
I branch lines to the Northwestern or some
other road which nearly parallels the
Union Pacific, and so, besides enriching
themselves, greatly decrease the value of
the Government property, as can be very
easily seen.
"This situation seems to have surprised
a great many people. Senator Morgan,
who has given such close attention to
the Pacific roaas funding bill, said on the
Senate floor the other day thai this mat
ter was entirely new to him. My purpose
is to have the Government appropriate
money to take up these notes of trust
and bo prevent the holders of the notes
obtaining possession of the branch lines."
"Put you say that these notes are past
due. How can you prevent the holders
foreclosing before Congress could appro
priate the money necessary to take up the
I notes even were Congress so disposed ? '
"Weil, the foreclosure has not taken
place and Congress should take steps im
mediately to appropriate money to take
up the notes. The whole scheme is one
of the grossest outrages ever perpetrated
on the people."
"What was the debt for which the trust
note* were issued contracted for?"
"For the notes, I should say. The
branch lines were and are making money.
They could have paid the interest on the
notes, and the principal, too. My belie!
is that there is no need of ihe debt. In
fact, 1 do not believe thnt any money was
paid on U>e notes. It's all a gigantic
fraud ; an outrage on tlie public."
"Do you contend that the people who
issued the notes are the same who now
hold them and the securities?'
"They all baionir to rtie same crowd.
They have been robbing this Government
for years, and the pity of it is that the
Government continues to have anything
to do with them."
"You intend to ti; ht for your resolu
tion?"
"With all my misht."

Instead of being a question of wages, work

SOUTH DAKOTA`S SENATORSHIP.
Kyle Is Still in the Lead, but the Situa-

Uneasiness.
PIERRE, S. D., Jan. 4.â There is but
little change in the Senatorial contest in
South Dakota. Kyle is still in th 3 lead,
but unless elected at an early date will be
compelled to take a back seat. He spent
a restless night last* night, not retiring
until a late hour this morning. Yester
day he put in his whole time in political
work.
Loucks, who is still second in the race,
has a strong force of lobbyists and they
are doing much work. Plowman has bis
forces well in hand. Wood of Custer City
and McGee of Rapid City and others are
his leaders and they are working untir
ingly.
Goodykoontz has many friends and
Railroad Commissioner La Follette is con
ducting his campaign, lie is the second

The Senate will organize and select a
majority of the members of committees
and allow the Governor to fill the balance
of the committees. There is no inclina
tion on the part of the Senate in a.iy way
to slight Lieutenant-Governor Hardman
and he is as earnestly inclined to co
operate with the Senate.
The inauguration will occur at 3 o'clock
to-morrow and the ball will be held at the

Fourth Gun Division, Naval Battalion,
N. G. C, under command of Lieutenant
Morey, spent yesterday afternoon as
euests of the officers and sailors of the
Monadnock. They renewed acquaint
ances they had formed last summer, wlie n
they made a cruise and received special
instruction on the monitor. This visit,
while of a semi-social nature, was attend
ed by the usual courteous discipline of the
ship and gave the naval reserve an oppor
tunity to study the useful things with
more leisure than on former visits. The
Monadnock may remain here several days
if the weather should prove favorable. A

ARE CURED.
The Depression Caused by
Disease Is Dispelled.
DISEASES. ESPECIALLY THOSE OF
a chronic nature, cannot be cured ex-
cept by a treatment that strikes directly
at the root ot the trouble. The new, origi-
nal and marvelous method of treating dis-
eases tnat is pursued at the State Electro-
Medical Institute is one that never fails.
The salutary effects of the treatment on
any disease are at once perceived and a
speedy and permanent cure is invariably
made in every case.
The treatment is medical and electrical
combined. The peculiar method of ad-
ministering these two great curative reme-
dies is a new, original, scientific discovery
of the Institute. "It is used exclusively by
them and the most amazing results are
accomplished in the treatment and cure of
all diseases.
The Institute is splendidly equipped
with evpry device known to the scientific
world for administering medical electric-
ity, includine large Static, Faradic and
Galvanic batteries, Electric Beits, .Body
Batteries and a great variety of other
electric appliances that are manufactured
and used exclusively by the lustitute in
their Electro-Medical treatment. By
means of these electric batteries and ap-
pliances, vitalizing, life-giving electric -
currents are used to aid in sending the ,
Institute medicines directly to the dis-
eased organs and diseased' parts of the
body.
The medicines prescribed at the Insti-
tute are perfect laboratory triumphs, for-
mulated from a true appreciation of the
medicinal wants of the body; and when
these medicines are aided in their recu-
perating and healing work by electricity
scientifically applied, every symptom of
disease is rapidJy dispelled, the patient
soon regains perfect health and strength,
while the depression caused by disease ia
displaced by the happiness and pleasure
that is he natural heritage of those twin
blessings, "a sound mind in a sound
body."
If you are sick or ailing, if you want to *
know what id tne matter with you, and if
you want to be cured, you should resort
without delay to the State Electro- Medical
Institute. The Institute IIIEATS AND

RAPID PROGRESS
Prosperous Condition of the
County Told in
Figures.
Retiring Chairman Greeninger
of the Supervisors Submils
His Report.
Steady Adv?ncement Made Along
Every L-ne Within the Past
Twelve Years.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 4 -At the regu
lar meeting of the Beard of Supervisors
this morning P.iul I\ Austin and Fred M.
Stern, the newly elected members, took
their seats. The retiring members were
J. S. Selby and A. Greeninger. Elmer Rea
was elected chairman. The personnel of
â¢ the new board is as follows: Paul P. Aus
tin, S. F. Aver, Elmer Kea, Fred M. Stern
and John Roll. S. F. Ayer tucceeded him
self from the Fifth District. On his elec
tion as chairman Mr. Rea made a short
f.ddre?s and invited the new board and re
tiring members to adinner at the Lamoile
House.
Before retiring, Chairman Greeninger,
who has been a member of the board for
twelve years, presented a report of the
progress of the county during the time of
his service as Supervisor. It is as follows:
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisor* of
Santa Clara < ounty: Bei-.g about 10 retire from
membership in mil honorable Loard. after a
service which lias covered a period of twelve
years, I deem it proper, with your consent, to
tail attention to some of ihe more important
Transactions that have occurred during that
lime, and to make a briei review of the progress
of the county during those years.
BOAD9 AND HIGHWAYS.
Probably the most important department
within the jurisdiction of tjie board is that of
public roads and highways. The condition of
the public roads of a community is a fair md
( x 10 the progressive character ot the people,
as well as to the intelligence and energy of its
executive beard. For many years SdDta Clara
County has been prominent for the efficiency
with which this department has been admin
istered, and to-day there is no county of the
l'acinc Coast that can equal it in the number
and excellence of its public highways. Dur
ing the past twelve years the county has
opened and improved 229 miles of the new
public roads. The extent to which the road
system has been perfected and improvements
accomplished during tne last twelve years is
indicated by the following statement compiled
from ttie records of the board:
In 1835, when I had the honor of taking my
seat on this board, there were but two roads
in the coiintv that were being systematically
gj rinkledâ the Alamedaand the Monterey road
â the former between San Jose and Santa Clara,
a distance of a little more than two miles, and
the latter between San Jose and the Oak Hill
Cemetery for a like distance, the aggregate
' amount of sprinkled roads being about five
miles. Investigation and experiments by the
Loerd had convinced them that the mainte
nance of the public highways could best be
accomplished by a liberal use of water during
the summer season. It was also ascertained
ihst ii general system of sprinkling would en
tail a large amount of money at first cost; but
this wou.d even:ually be returned in a les
sened cost of maintenance. The question of
first cost caused the board to move cautiously
in the beginning, but iis efforts in the initial
experiments were so successful and Its jtid^
*o fully confirmed that the taxpayers
were quick to appreciate the results and eecu
fear tue demand for aa extension of the Â«ys
iem came lrom tne peop.e of all districts. How
much progress has been made in this direction
will be shown by the statement that, in the
place of the five miies of sprinkled road in
lfc?.j, with a sprinkling apparatus consisting
of two carts, the county now regularly waters
about 250 miles of county road.*, lias 55
watering-carts ami more than 90 miles of pipe
vita macninery and arpamtus, constitut
â¢ permanent plant valued at about
*150.000.
The board has full reason to be gratified at
tin- result of its labors in this department- The
blinding dust which, twetve years ago, charac
terized the rural highways in tiie summer
linn . ihat made travel a burden and demanded
of the traveler a thorough cleansing process at
the end of even a brief journey, has disap
ed, and he can now drive for miles in any
direction with comfort and pleasure. The
chuck holes which lay concealed beneath a
covering of impalpable powder, and which
passage <<f loaded teams almost in
tolerable, have ttiso gone, find in their place is
a hard and smooth rcanbed, over which the
most fragile articles can be transported with
out danger or inconvenience. This is a most
Important consideration ;o the fruitgrower,
- rapidly monopolizing the territory ou<
â¢ side' the limit* oi cities and towns. Over our
-. as they are now maintained, his pro
em be carried to their destination with
-1 â â :: braising and de ivtreu in a cleanly condi
:io 1.
I will herr, gentlemen, take the liberty to
t that however tar the improvement of
our public roads has teen carried there is still
room lor progress. The principal item of the
nt expense is the lost of obtaining water.
] iiope to see the time in the near future when
this 1 xiiunse will be reduced to a nominal
â¢ Bum. Taera are streams in the hills thn: sur
round .he valley which will lurnish a supply
of water amply sufficient for all road purposes.
-apply can be led to convenient points by
.gravitation, and thus obviate the employment
of costly machinery or apparatus, and save the
â  laige sums now actually expanded iv the pur
chase of water. It seems :o rue to be the true
policy for the county to lake immediate steps
â¢ toward acquiring such rignis to the different
source! oi water supply ts will enable it to en
joy the full advantages 01 those natural re
sources. Each week mat pa-ses will mate
this more difficult. The rapid settlement of
tne territory tnrough which these streams
flow complicated the difficulty by raising up
confiii tine claims, so that what niiuht now be
accomplished without dispute may next year
bÂ» obtained only through great trouble and
largely increased expense.
WORKING THK PRISONERS.
One of the problems mat have been subjects
nf careiul and continuous consideration by
the board is the question of providing em
ployment for the prisoners confined m me
:yJail. Several experiments have been
made and none of them have proved entirely
satisfactory, the expense being lound too
large to give satisfHctory results. The Snfe
keeping oi the prisoners rendered it necessary
to employ and 'pay extra deputies, while the
co^t of transportation and the time required
to move the prisoners from jail to place of
iatior aii'l return entailed much expense on
. tiie county. But one of the most important
objections to auy of the experiments thus far
mnde is, in my opinion, the competition cre
ated between lree and penal labor. The law
abiding wage-earners ol the county should
lif.ve all the money that the county expends
lor labor. The difficulty hns been 'in finding
some employment that would not interfere
with this free labor and which would at the
snme time bring in a prolii sufficient to re
imburse the county for the expense (hat must
-;iri!y be incurred in maintaining the
prisoners.
In common with the other members of this
board I have given this que.ntion much seriotM
consideration, and I have become thoroughly
convinced that all difficulties can be obviated
by putting the prisoners at the wort of pre
paring material fur the public roads of the
<â¢> uirtv and the streets of the city. There is
an sbundanea of rock ot a superior quality
within three miles of San Jose. It is mcx
liÃus:ib:e In quantity and can be transported
inexpensively and conveniently to all points
wh-jreitmay be needed. A small expenditure
<>; money would furnish necessirv buildings
for the use of the prisoners and provide com
pensation for superintendence and extra
guard. There are natural facilities for wurk
icg any number of prisoners, arid the result
would bo the preparation of nn abundance of
the best of road material, which could be used
by the county or sold to the incorporated cit
:>â - mid towns at a very lowpnce. Itcouldin
runny instances be made to take the place of.
el. The roads would be better for iis use
1 wouid cost less money. The plan would
not Interfere wl' 11 lree labor, but. on the con
trary, would acid to the opportunities of the
free laborer. It wou.d be work ivhicn, if not
done in tins manner, would not be done at all,
and, when the municipal authorities see an
abundance 01 material so cheap and so well
adapted to the rarpose. many streets and
roads wi;i be improved which under other cir
cu instances woul 1 not be done.
Tnis would make additional labor for the
labor. ng man rather than deprive Dim ot that
which he already haa. Ihe fact that prison
ers would be obliged to work would materially
reduc â  the number of vagrants. This fact has
been abundantly proved by the experiments
already made by the board. . ,
I desire to urge this matter on the board
with all the earnestness in my power. It is
for the moral -and financial benefit of the
couutv. It will save money to the taxpayers
and famish additional employment to iree
labor. It will exert a poweriul Influence in
bringing our road* ana streets to a higher
s;ate 01 perfection, and will go a long way
toward exterminating the tramp nuisance
which is so burdensome to the industrious
people ot the community.
â¢ RELIEF OF INDIGENTS.
In providing for the sick and destitute of the
county the board has exhibited an intelligent
lib-ralitv. Mucn money has bÂ«en expended,
but it been in behalf ol suffering human
ity and hns not been begrudged by the general
body uf taxpayers. At the time I entered on
my tluiies ms Supervisor the county had two
eleemosynary institutionsâ the County Hospi
tal and the Alinshouse. The growth of the
county haa demanded many < additions and
improvements to theso institutional Theso
improvements aro enumerated in another part
of this report and were accomplished at a total
cost oi $23,355. . -
Tnc growth of the work of relieving the poor
will be illustrated by the following statement:
Kxpense (ruftfnt*nance) Infirmary 1885.. 117 45

uutsiJe relief granted 1896... 18,al8 85
Oi the amount expended for outside relief i
about $2800 wus received from thetStnte.
Xot iuirequently afflictea persons, residents
of oilier counties, have presented 'themselves
for relief. In some instances it has been found
possible to return these persons to th'j coun
ties where they belong ; but in most cases the
dictates of humanity have demanded that ;
they should be taken in and cared for. and
this has been done. This has materially iu
creased â¢ the number of inmates of the In
firmary and Almhouse. Resident physicians
in different parts of the county have been
employed by the board so that the afflicted
poor ol all sections mirrht have equal oppor
tunity for medicnl treatment. All of tnese
things have cost money, but. as heretofore re
marked, the expenditure has been in the
interest of humanity and has not been com
plained of by the taxpayers. The cost has
been more than usual during the past three
years, owinsr to the stagnation of bu-.iness and
consequent hsrd times. The prospect of a re
vival iv all oranehes of industry makes it
probable that the expense in this department
may be materially lessened; but, at all events,
the deserving poor should be cared for In as
liberal a manner a* the condition of the county
will permit.
DIBEASE IN CATTLE.
About two years ago the San Jose Grange
called the attention 01 the board to the fact
that the presence oi tuberculosis had been
delected in seme of the cattle herds of this
couniy, and particularly among cows -from
which milk was being, supplied to consumers,
and asked the boaru to take action in the
premises. An - investigation was promptly
made, and as soon as the facts were fully ;
ascertained a veterinary inspector and health i
officer . was appointed and a campaign in
augurated against t^e deadly disease. There
was some delny experienced in procuring
supplies of the tuberculin test material and by
the opposition on the part of some of the
cattle-owners to the iuFpection of their herds.
Tne real practical work in the field began in
March, 1896. Since that time 3203 head of
cattle have been inspected, 01 which 450 were !
condemned as tuberculous. The inspector |
nas also condemned twenty-one horses as
giandcred. investigated and abated numerous
nuisances, and has made systematic and fre
quent inspection 01 slaughter- houses and
dairies. Of the cattle condemned and killed
as tuberculous about 300 were cows giving
milk, and it is estimated that these furnished
about 900 gallons daily, which were consumed
I by the people. The energetic measures taken
! by the boarawiil promptly drive the disease
I lrom our herds, and Santa Clara County will
soon be as famous for its pure milk and dairy
products as It is now for the excellence of its
fruit. ,
PROTECTION OF ORCHARDS.
During the last twelve years tne county has
changed from grain-growing and general larm
ing to a fruit-growing community. Horticul
ture has become the dominant industry. This
transformation was recognized by the board as
soon as the change commenced and such aid
has been given to the new enterprise asitspro
i moters h-ive recommended and the iaw per
mitted. On the suggestion ol the fruit-growers
a Horticultural Commission has been main
tained lrom time to time by the board. The j
work done by the inspector has been efficient, j
His duty has' been principally to prevent the j
introduction of insect pests and diseased trees
I and ihe extermination of those which have ;
al ready found lodgment in our orchards aiid |
vineyards. His efforts have been ably sec- !
onded by the fruit-growers themselves, and
the result Is that the orchards of Santa Cara
County are more free from these euemie's than
those of auy othor county in the State.
FISH AND GAME.
The preservation of fish and game is a mat
ter of conceded importance, uotonly for the
purpose of preventing the destruction of a
food supply, but In order to furnish riealthiul
recreation lor the people at home and to add
to the attractiveness of the county to the peo
ple abroa'l. Many hundreds vof dollars have
been annually taken out of the county by our
citizens who seek the recreation of hunting
j anÂ«i fi>htng in other lacaiities. If the laws
I now existing are rigidly enforced this sport
can be furnished within our own borders, not
only to our own people, but our advantages
will entice to v* a. large number of sportsmen
from abroad, and the money expended here
i will add no small amount to our income. The !
j efforts already made by the board iv thU di- !
rection have borne good fruit. The work per- j
formed by the Game Warden, although he \
has been in office lew than two years, has had j
a marked effei-t. The replenishing of our
streams with trout and the nddition to our
list of many rare varieties of game and song
bir.'.s have called attention to our county in
different portions cf the country where our
existence nas been previously unknown.
During n is term of service the Game Warden j
ha* secured and planted in our streams 300,
--000 young tro*ii. He has also secured ninety
pairs of Chinese pheasants UTo-d and silver).
Tnese birds are breeding well and wiil soon be
in plentiful supply, if properly protected. He
has also secured sever.ty-three pairs of English
skylarks, twenty pairs of Pek in nightingales ;
or bu.buis eleven cardinals, two pairs of zebra !
doves, two pairs of golden quan, six pairs of j
Southern mocking birds and specimens of |
other rare song and game birds, ail ot them in- i
sectivorous ami whicn will be incidentally an j
aid to the iruit-growers. These bird 3 have |
been gathered not culy from America but |
also from foreign countries, and the corre
spondence incident to tbeir procurement has
served as an excellent advertisement for our
county. The Game Warden is continually in
receipt of letters from all parts of the world in
dicating tnat a successful issue of his efforts i
will make Santa Clara County a favorite resort j
lor wealthy tourists. All of this stock, both
fish ami birds, has been procured by him with- |
out cost to ths county, and tue system of ex
changes which he lias arranged with the dif
ferent acclimatization societies wtll insure a
continuous supply of everything that is desira
ble in this department, and without expense
to the people. As a business proposition, leav
ing out the question of sentiment altogether,
1 think the efforts of the board in this direc
tion will result in great profit to the county.
ADVERTISING THE COUNTY.
The duty of spreading abroad information
concerning the resources of the county has
not been neglected by th-e board. The annual
appropriation permitted by law for this pur
pose has, in my opinion, been wisely ex- j
peucled. It has been distributed turough
channels too numerous to be detailed in this
j report, Dut which have received the indorse
i meat and the approval of tne taxpuycrs geu-
I eruily and of the public societies and boards
I organized for the purpose of inducing immi
i graiion and finding a market for the products j
of our orchards and vineyards and other in- |
duttriea, The appropriations by the board for |
, this purpose enabled the county to be effect- |
ively represented at the World's Columbian j
' Kxpositiou at Chicago, at the Midwinter Fair j
at San Francisco and at the World's Industrial
Exposiiion a; Atlanta, Ga. I think this money
, wisely expended. It nas caused our county to
become widoiy known in tne older States and
has been returned to us several times over in
the new money brought here by the people
who have been induced by your efforts to
make their home in this community and has
done much toward extending the market for
the products of thecuuntr.
HALL OF RECORDS.
One of the most important as well as the
most valuable improvements that have been
added to the county during the term of my
s*rv.ce as Supervisor is the construction and
furnishing of the Hall of Records. The neces
sity for a i^uildlng of tiiis character had been
apparent lor severnl of years, and petitions
asking that the work be done, and signed by
prominent taxpayers and persons interested
in the safe keeping of the public records, had
been presented lrom time to time. But the
board did not sec its way clearly to the r.on
summ.ition of the projjet without heavy bur
den to the taxpayers until 1883, at which
time it purchase 1 the lot adjoining thfi Coun
house, paying therefor the sum of $50,000.
At the time of this purchase there was seme
nritic;smof theaciion of the board based on the
fact that a lew years previously ihe lot eouid
have been bought at a considerably less price,
i'.ut ti.is criticism was more ol a political than
of a business character. The people fully un
derstood that there had been a large advance
In values ol all kinds of property ; that the lot
was the only one available for the purpose and
Â«as well worth the pric* paid.
By tha tax levy of 1889-IS9O the purchase
money for the lot was folly paid and In 1800
the construction of the buiMing was com
menced. In May ol that yenr the contract for
the foundation was awarded for $30,499. Iv
October the contract for the superstructure
wbb awarded for .$162,000. In December,
1892, the contract ior tue metallic furniture
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
was awarded for $11,715 72, â¢ and in the same
month was also let the contract for. vault
fronts and doors for $37G0. . Marble wains
coting wis a separate' contract' and was let in
May. 1893, for $1500, and this, with the pur
chase oi a safe for tue Treasurer's olfice, com
p.cted the building, the aggregate expenditure
bein? $211,474 72 for the building and
$50,000 for tno lot. making a grand total of
$â¢201,474 72.
I mention the construction oi this building
with much pride from the fact that it is, ns
tar as I have been able to as-certain, the only
work of equal magnitude in the State that has
ever been carried through to completion with
out issuing bonds or causing a stringency in
the ' treasury. '. Every just claim was paid in
coin promptly on presentation and, when the
building was" finished,. it was fully paid, for,
and this withontany material increase In the
rato of taxation or tor^o .ving money 111 any
manner. This noble building, which marks
the progress of the community, is also a
monument to the energy, business intelligence
and fidelity to the public -interests of the
board under whose administration ;it was
erected. I believe that the people of the
couniy so understand it and appreciate the
work you have so well performed for their
benefit. â  Â- ' , * '

COUNTY INDEBTEDNESS.
It will be seen by ths foregoing review of the '
business of the several denartm'nts under the
jurisdiction of the board tnat the county has
during the last twelve years kept fully abreast i
of the times. Much additional property has
been acquired and the improvements made
in all respects equal and in many re
spects superior to those . of any other
county in the State. This showing is as
Gratifying to the board as it must necessarily
te to the people who furnished the money to
accomplish the work and who can see in the
result value received for every dollar they
have paid into the county treasury. It is no
less gratiiying to know that all these things
have been accomplished without imposinc ex
tra burden upon the taxpayers. During the
term indicated the rate of taxation has been
kept aown to the lowest point commensurate
with intelligent economy. During that time
but nine counties in the Mate have had as low
a tax rate as Santa Clara County nnd but three
of them lower. No debt oi any character hns
been created. On the contrary, a large por
tion of the old debt has been extinguished.
On the Ist day ot January, 1885, the bonded
indebtedness of the county wai as follows: '

During the first year of my membership on
this honorable board $10,000 of the Western
Pacific Ruiiroail bonds were redeemed and the
remaining $145,000 were refunded, as follows:
$45,000, with interest reduced from 7 to 4WJ
per cent, nnd $100,000, with interest reduceu
from 7to 4 percent; thus reducing the total
annual interest charge on these bonds from
$10,850 to $6025.
During thy next five years, or up to July 1,
18yO, there were redeemed of the Courthouse
ana Jail bonds of 1876 the amount of $14,000.
The remaining $45,000 was refunded, with
interest reduced irom 7 to 4)< per cent; re
ducing Ihe annual interest cnurge on tnese
bonds from $413L> to $3005.
Since that time bonds huve been redeemed
until the indebtedness ol the county has been
reduced to $112,000, of which $59000 bears
4J-j per cent interest and $53,000 bears 4 per

In other words, the county has paid off

year in interest.
Tne county has no floating debt, and every
claim allowed by the board has been paid on
piesen union to the Treasurer. And, While
this hMS been done, the value of the property
owned by the county In its own right has been
increased from $422,000 to $890,000. and the
rate oi taxation has b.-eu kept lower thau that
of most of 4he counties in the State.
The permanent Improvements of the county
{ being now in such an advanced state, I have
! no doubt but that the board will be called
I upon for very little expenditure in this direc
! tion in the near future, and that it will be on
! abled to make a material reduction in the rate
of taxation, and even then pay off the entire
debt during the next four years.
IN CONCLUSION.
Under the facts disclosed by the foregoing
brief statements I think 1 am warranted in
! congratulating the board on the result of its
j labors. You have maintained the position cf
! the county iv the front rank in the inarch oi
progress. All of its institutions ure iv good
working condition. You have added more
than 100 p_r cent to the value of the county
property, rednce^ the county debt more than
i 70 per cent and the annual interest charge
j more than 75 per cent, and have, substan
; Hully, maintaired the tax rate at a lower
j figure than that of any other county in the
i State. In the meantime every warrant against
i the county has been promptly paid upon pre
sentation. These are achievements nnequaled I
by any other county in California, and could
not have bsen accomplished except for the
hearty co-operation oi the taxpayers, whose
intelligence and public spirit have enabled
them to comprehend the object of your efforts
and to strengthen your hands.
And to the nress of the county also much
I credit is due. Tne newspapers generally have
co-operated with the board in Us efforts and
have rendered valuable assistance. There has
been some adverse criticism of your work in
the local journals, but such occurrences have
been infrequent, and oalv during heated po
iitical campaigns, when zea) lor party tempo
rarily obscured the editorial vision. But when
the partisan smoke has cleared lrom the polit
ical battlefield the presi has been quics to
recognize the good work done by the board
and to join its influence to your efforts In the
endeavor to secure for the county an economi
cal and at the same lime a progressive admin
istration of public affairs.
I desire personally to extend my thanks to
each member of the board and all county
officers for uniform courtesy accorded me dur
] Inir the time In which I have been a member
of your honoroble bi'dy, and particularly dur
ing the time in which I have had the honor to
preside over your deliberations. I retire with
the kindliest feeling for each of you. In on
clusion I will express for myself and for each
of you the confidence that the work done by
i the board in the past will be fully equaled
|by the work done in the future. My personal
I knowledge of the character of the new mem-
I bers of the board for intelligence, energy,
! fidelity and progresslveness. Fives full warrant
j lor this prediction. Respectfully submitted,
a. Greeninger,
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors oi Santa
[ Clara County.
TO END COSTLY LITIGATION.
Varied Interests of Miller & Lux Are to
Be Combined in One Great
Corporation.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 4.â lt }s proposed
to form of the varied interests of Miller &
Lux a mammoth corporation. Papers
have already been drawn up and it is said

days. The arrangement would end the
costly litigation that has involved the
estate since the death of Charles W. Lux.
The capital stock of the proposed corpora
tion will be $12,000,000. which is considered
a conservative estimate of the value of the
estate, and the s:ock will he issued o n a
basis proportionate to the present owner
ship of the business. Henry Miller, the
survivine partner, will receive $6,000,000 in
stock ns his share. One-half of the re
maining 16.000, C00 will go to the five
brothers an<i enters of Charles W. Lux,
Mrs. Miranda W. Lux receiving the other
half.
Henry Mil.er is to be president and
eeneral manaeer and a director ex officio.
J. Leroy Nickel, Erwin G. Rudolph and
Jesse Sheldon Potter, son of Mrs. Charles
Lux, will also represent the Miller inter
nals on the board of directors, Henry Lux
of San Jose acting for the German heirs
and Attorney Thorn% B. Bishop repre
senting the interests of Mrs. Miranda W.
Lux.'widow of Charles Lux. Dr. Azro N.

CLARK RESIDENCE ABLAZE.
Flames Badly Damage the Magnificent
Dwelling Before They Are
Controled.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 4â The magnifi
cent residence of the W. S. Clark estate ai
the corner of the Alameda and Schiele
avenue, had a narrow escape from destruc
tion by fire last night. As it was, the uam
ace to the house, furniture and carpets
will reach $5000.
About 11:30 o'clock the odor of some
thing burning aroused the suspicion of
thu inmates, and on investi ating they
found fire between the walls back oi the
fireplace in the library. Southard Hoff
man, a prominent society young man of
San Francisco, who was visiting at the
house, secured an ax and cut out the wall.
When the rrandailville Fire Company
arrived Mr. Hoffman assumed the man
agement of tiie lire-fighters and did valiant
work in saving the house. It was neces
sary to cut away the floor and walls in the
second story and a great deal of damage
was done by water. After three-quarters
of an hour the tire was put out.
The house is occupied by the Misses
Alice, May, Grace and Belle Chirk. Squier
Clark, a little brother, and William Dun
can, an uncle. The loss is covered by in
surance.
INDIAN PICTURES NEAR ALTURAS.
Discovery of Strange Hieroglyphics Caned
in the Side of a Rocky
Bluff.
PORTLAND, Or., Jai:. 4.-W. B. Whit
temore while in Alturas recently discov
ered some remarkable hieroglyphics about
fif'een miles northeast from the north end
of Warner Valley on the edge of what is
loccally known as the "desert" in Lake
County. Mr. Whittemore is one of the
officers and principal owners of the War
ner Valley Stock Company, and is thor
oughly conversant with the locality. He
says the hieroglyphics had been cut with
a >haro instrument in the surface of the
hard basaltic rock. They cover the face
of the buff for a distance of about three
miles, and consist of pictures of Indians
with bows, arrows and spears, besides
deer, antelope, dogs and wolves, geese,
ducks, swan and reptiles of various kinds.
Intermingled with these animals are char
acters which, of course, he could not de
cipher. He says that the execution of
the p.ctures was very good, and he is sat
i-fieil tnat it could not have been the
work of ordinary Indians. Throughont
the entire distance the characters and pic
tures are in rows.
The Indians of the vicinity have no
knowledge of the meaning of the hiero
glyphics or of the people who ages ago
chiseled them on the surface of the rocks.
One old Indian saiit there was a tradition
among his tribesmen that many ages ago a
people came tiier? who were very bad.
They remained for a lone time and went
awayâ whither he knew not.
Who were those stranee, bad people?
They were not, as Mr. Whittemore says,
ordinary Indians, for their Knowledge of
sculpture could never have enabled them
to execute the pictures so remarkably true
to nature. From the description given,
the picture- writing bears a close resem
blance to those found in Mexico and Cen
tral America. If this supposition is true,
a careful study might reveal to the archae
ologist some insight into the origin or
wanderings of a dead and forgotten civili
zation.
BOLD ROBBERY AT ALBINA.
Masked Men Compel Thr&e Laborers to
Surrender Their Week's Wages
on Payday.
PORTLAND, Ob.. Jan. 4.â Two armed
men this evening, at 5:45 o'clock, held up
L. E. Snell, J. Mover and A. J. Kirkland, j
employes at the Portland flourlng-mills at
Albina, robbing them of $80, their aggre
gate week's wages. When the men were
ordered to deliver Kirklana ran back to
join his fellow-workmen in the rear, to
summon them to the assistance of the
other two, but a threat to shoot him en
forc <1 his return. The men in the rear, j
seeing the dilemma of those ahead, beat a
hasty retreat, and one of thÂ« thugs fired
at them without doing any injury.
The three victims begged to be allowed
to retain part of their money, as they re- !
quired it ior their families, but not a i
nickel was left to them. This was pay- i
day at the mill, and the roboers, who were !
quite loquacious while searching their |
victims, remarked that it had been their I
purpose to raid the mill office, but there !
were too many men to cope with.
This bold affair has created intense ex- '
citement in Albina, and several posses of
citizens and detectives are searching the '
contiguous country. The victims of the
robbery claim to be able to identify the ,
robbers on sight.

CRUELLY LUSHED
BY WHITECAPS
Idaho Rancher Taken From
His Residence and
Flogged.
Believed to Be Dying From the
Effects of a Brutal
Beating.
Was Accused of Causing Discord in
tbe Home of a Neighboring
Farmer.
SPOKANE, Wash , Jan. 4.â C. W. Red
dick, f prosperous young farmer near
Newport, Idaho, who was said to have
been on too intimate terms with the wife
of his neighbor, a rancher named Cusick,
was visited at his home by a gang of
whitecaps last night. They dragged him
out into the timber close by, and despite
his protestations of innocence, brutally
beat him with clubs and Jashed him with
rawhides until he was insensible.
There is little hopo of his recovery.
The whitecaps are known and will be
made to answer for their crime.
Newport is just across the Idaho line
and about fony miles from Spokane. Red
dick lives but a few miles from Newport.
Cusick, his neighbor, was married only
recently. Reddick was a frequent visitor
at the Cusick ranch, and soon the tongues
of scandal-monuers were unloosed. Their
talk reached the husband's ears and a do
mestic quarrel followed.
Cusick summoned a number of friends,
and they decided to become judge, ju-y
and executioner. Reddick was warned to
leave the county, but paid little attention
to the threat. Last night ne was awakened
by a knocking at his door. Supposing
that one of the neighbors had met with
an accident, he arose and opened the door.
Instantly he was seized by a dozen
strong hands and dragged outside. Red
dick foueht desperately, but was auickly
overpowered. Half stunned by a shower
of blows the helpless man was dragged to
a spot a short distance from the house
and there given a terrible beating.
Clubs and horsewhips were used, the
lashes cutting to ribbons Reddick's
nitrhtrobe and sinking deep into the flesh.
His shrieks of agony were answered by
jeers and laughter and fresh blows upon
his bleeding body.
Not until tbe victim was a mass of cats
and bruises and fainting under the tor
ture did tbe mob grow weary of its brutal
work. Then, with final warnings that if
he did not keep away from his neighbors
house they would return %nd bane him,
the raiders mounted horses tied In the
bushes near at hand and rode away.
Naked, dumb with cold, and suffering
tortures Reddick finally succeeded in
crawling back to his house. Friends found
hiru and oared lor him as best they could,
but owing to the terrible injuries he had
received, the exposure and the delay be
fore medical assistance could be sum
moned, it i 3 feared that he niav not re
cover. His body is covered with gashes
and he suffers excruciating pain. The
greatest danger 13 that blood poisoning
may set in.
The neighbors are indignant over the
affair, and the entire population has tauen
sides. Many threats have been made, and
more trouble is looked for. Word has been
sent to Rathdrum, the county seht, and
the Sheriff and a posse have gone to the
scene. The ringleader of the outrage is
known, but his friends say they will not
allow him to be taken. The county is
hilly and rocky, and should the so-called
vigilantes make a stand in the hills they
could hold a larjre number at bay.

Residents Excited Over What Thru Be-
licred to Ilnre lire it Hitrder.
ANDERSON, Gal., Jan. 4.â Some prac
tical joker, lacking in that qualification
sometimes termed horse sense, created
the wildest excitement in Anderson this
morning and kept the village Constable
and a corps of assistants on a vain quest
all day.
The excitement was caused by the find
ing on the porch of the pubiic school
house of blood-stained garments, - while
the appearance of the porch and the steps
leading to it indicated that there had been
a desperate struggle for lile.
A gory trail led from the 'steps to a
near-by well, as though a body had been
dragged along, and tue reddish imprints
of a man's hands on the cord and the
bucket added their mate testimony to
prove thai a crime had been committed.
The well was dragged, but no body was
brought co the surface of the water, and a
most diligent search of the vicinity proved
fruitless. -
To-night it was learned that the local
constable and the public as well Lad been
duped. The authorities know who the
joker is, and there is a possibility that he
will be arrested for defacing school prop
erty.

STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 4. â The new
Board of Supervisors went into office to
day and the old one went out. James A.
Shepherd was absent, being on a sick bed
at Lathrop, and this left but one Demo
crat on the boardâ D. C. Shepherd. He
nominated Hemphill for chairman, as a
"joker" on Henderson, whom the Repub
licans had decided . on. As it requires
three votes to elect a chairman this move
forced Henderson to vote for himself. . !
. The new chairman immediately drew a
list of the new committees from his pocket
and from this list he at once made ap
pointment?. In not one case was n Demo
crat named as chairman of a committee.
As soon as the newly organized board
was called to order this afternoon a gen

The courthouse gardener was replaced,

BRAVED DEATH TO

lOn a Brakebeam an Old
Man Starts to His
Wedding.
Cars Give a Lurch and His Eody
Is Mangled Under the
Wheels.
Thtfush Penniless, H Had Determined
Net to Dis^pp int His In
tended Bri e.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 4.â Determined
to keep his marriage engagement whether
he had a penny or not Charles Sawtella
started from Spokane on Monday of iast
week to beat his way to Portland. He has
arrived â that is, his n. angled body is here
lying upon a slab in tne morgue.
Sawielie was a paper-hanger, a hard
working, industrious fellow for a man of
his years â he was aged 63. For a number
of years he had lived in Portland, but
work becoming scarce tie removed to Spo
kane. In fact the move that sent him
away was the same that was bringing him
back, for while here ho had become en
gaged to Anna Birchraan, working a3 a
domestic in the family of H. 8. Guild, at
686 Twenty-first street. It was the hope
of making a home for himself and brido
in Spokane that led Sawtelle t lther. The
wedding ilav had been set for early In
, January, 1597, and the paper-hanger, dis
appointed in his search for <mp!oyment
and being penniless, determined at all
hazards not to disappoint his intended as
to the marriage, and he started lor Port
land by the brakebeani route.
He had never attempted anything of tho
kind before, and bis mani.est ignorance
of hobo traveling attracting the attention
of the brakomen. On Friday last he was
put off an engine, on to the tender of
which he had clambered at Monber.
There a brakeman, taking pity on the
old man's evident inability to handlo

OUR NEXT SENATOR.
The election of a United States Senator is the most important duty which the
State Legislature during the hrst fortnight of its session will be called upon to
perform. This duty will devolve upon the Republicans, whose aggregate of sev
enty-four members constitutes the majority of both houses of the Legislature. The
next Senator, therefore, will be a Republican. Who shall it be?
It is high time that the great State of California should give serious considera
tion to the subject of its Senators and should approach their selection with a
proper degree of pride. In the earlier history ot the Republic it is recorded that
men have declined nomination for the Presidency, esteeming their seat
in the United State Senate to be the more exalted office. The
older commonwealths have set California an apt example in the
quality of men whom they select as Senators, and proudly point to the
statesmen whose illustrious careers in the Senate have reflected glory upon their
respective States. Why may not California make an epoch in its history by
choosing from among its sons a Senator who, in the possession of those qualities
which the office peculiarly requires, shall be worthy to take an equal place among
the orators and the statesmen of whom her sisrtor commonwealths are so justly
proud? While lowa sends an Allison, Ohio a Foraker, Nebraska a Thurston,
Massachusetts a Lodge and New York a Choate, why may not California furnish
to the United States Senate a mau who in character, in ambition and in ability ia
worthy to be their peer?
What are the qualifications which the Legislature of California should require
in every candidate for the Senate as essential to his selection? Character? That,
of course; and character of that high quality which holds itself superior to
sordid and selfish interests and free from those entanglements of business which
have so often interfered with a Senator's impartial and unselfish service to the
peocle of his State. â¢
In addition to the first essential of character there should be ability of that
nature which the office of Senator peculiarly requires. There should be learning
in the broad sense of the termâ a knowledge of the history of the ages, of the rise
and fall of nations, of the structure of society, of the growth of human liberty, of
the laws and institutions of Deoples and states; an intimate acquaintance with the
social and political movements of the present time, and lastly, an exact under
standing of the resources, the rights, the needs and the demands of his own State.
As a complement to this learning there should be the faculty to make it po
tential, or, in other words, the power which lies in speech. The next Senator
from California should be an orator; not merely a phrase-maker, nor an elocu
tionist repeating essays and set speeches, but a man of that kind of eloquence
which attracts the minds, controls the reason and compels the will of other
men; a man rvho can fitly represent the State of California by speaking out
grandly and bravely and convincingly for its rights as a State among States, and
for its interests as a commonwealth among nations; who can voice the ambitions,
the aims, the impulses, the moving spirit of its sons and daughters, and who can
upon occasion take high grounds of honor and of principle upon issues of
National importance and of world-wide influence. Such an orator California, in
justice to herself, to her past, to her interests and to her genius, should
place in the Senate a3 her most potent agent, and her Legislature
cannot do their State a greater honor nor a more needed service than the present
selection of such a Senator.
Again, the Senator who shall be chosen should have the united and un
reserved support of the Republican party of California. He should be
able to unify all factions; to put an end to all internal disruptions, dis
cords and disputes. He should have deserved his party's loyalty by his own un
swerving loyalty to it and by a long term of unselfish and distinguished service in
all its times oi need. His party leaders should be his sponsors, and the Legisla
ture should require their indorsement as a prerequisite to his election. No
man has the right to be Senator who has been arrogant enough to esteem himself
above his party or selfish enough to sacrifice its interests or chances of success in
preference to his own. The time has arrived in Republican politics when party
wounds should be healed and party dissensions ended. The man who sufficiently
possesses the faith, the friendship and. the confidence of leaders and of factions to
bring about this result should be our next Senator in order that there may bs
wielded that influence with the incoming administration at Washington which
will secure for California the recognition which she so richly and fully deserves.
Lastly, the next Senator from California should possess the esteem and confi
dence of the people of the entire State without respect to party or pursnit or
creed or class. They should know him to be & fearless friend of justice and cham
pion of Jiberty; a fellow-laborer like the majority of themselves, who by reason of
having worked his own way up to eminence is in sympathy with honest men in
their every effort and aspiration for the general good.
The Legislature has presented to it an opportunity to select a man who meas
ures up to ail of these requirements for our next Senator in the person of Samuel
M. Shortridge of San Francisco. In character, in learning, in eloquence; in knowl
edge of tno rights and needs of California; in ability to unify the Republican party
through the confidence and support of its leaders; in the possession of tue esteem
and respect of the people of the entire State, Samuel M. Shortridge is the candi-
dale before the Legislature whose claim to their favor is founded upon his eminent
fitness for the place.
REPUBLICAN UNITJ.
To the Republican party the people ol
California have intrusted the management
of their political affairs. All the oppor
tunities of the time for advancing the
welfare of the State by legislative action
are in the hands of the Republican major
ity in the Legislature. Upon those repre
sentatives of the party rests the responsi
bility of so administering the trust that
the people will be satisfied and the hold of
the party upon popular favor be strength
ened and confirmed.
In considering the best means of ad
vancing; the welfae of the btate by party
government the Republicans of the Legis
lature cannot fail to see that it is of prime
importance to put an end to those tactions
within the party which disturbed it during
the past campaign and to re-establish in
the ranks and among the leaders that
harmony which Is essential to the best and
most vigorous action.
Every step taken by the Republicans of
the Legislature should tend to party unity
and harmony. The counsel and advice of
the leaders of all sections of the party
should be listened to and due deference
given to those who are manifestly seeking
to allay past differences and to arrange for
a leadership which will truly and fully
represent the policies and aspirations of
California Republicanism. If the guii
ance of such men is followed the future of
the Republican party in this State will be
secure, and California hereafter will be
counted as surely in the Republican
column as her great sister Stales, Penn
sylvania and Ohio.
In the nature of things the first step in
the direction of restored party harmony
must be taken in the election of a United
States Senator. That issue arises first and
must be settled first. Republicans should
give their votes to that candidate who has
been most loyal to the party organization
at all times, who has labored most earn
estly for the success of its regular tickets,
whose influence has tended most to har
mony and whose election would be most
likely to trive satisfaction to the rank and
file of the party in all sections of the
State.
If any Republican member of the Legis
lature is in doubt as to which candidate
Des f . fill til la these conditions he wiil nave
his doubts removed by even the most
casual study of the situation at Sacra
mento. He will rind that the leaders of
the sections of the party most divided dur
ing the campaign are now unitedly work
inc for the election of Samuel M. Short
rid ge. These men have united in support
of Mr. Shortridge because they know that
his election will not only assure California
an able, eloquent, patriotic and influential
representative in the Senate, but that it
would put an end to party dissensions at
home and unite all layal Republicans
under that new leadership which is neces
sary to the new era in our political his
tory.
The fact that the leaders of opposing
faoiions who a short time ago could scem
inglv agree upon nothing are now work
ing in harmony for Mr. Shortridge is a
convincine evidence thai he has the power
and influence to bring men into agree
ment with one another upon those high
platforms of party and public policy
which are above personal rivalries and an
tagonisms.. Men of all ections of the
party and of the State recoenize in him a
man whom they are glad to support for
the high honor to which he aspires, ana
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
Republicans of the Legislature cannot
fail to note the significance of the fact.
It is well known to e/ery student of our
politics that the favor shown to Mr. Short
ridge by the leaders of all divisions of the
Republican ] arty i 3 not undeserved. He
has been faithful to Republican traditions
and Republican discipline in season and
out of season. He has served the party
B3 a whole and not to promote factions.
He has been at ail time? a true representa
tive of its patriotism and an advocate of
its principles. He is known to every
leader of the party in this State and to
many of the rank and file in every county.
All who know him trust him. In his can
didacy all factions cease. Opposing lead
ers lay aside thei' differences and rally to
his support. He stands as the candidate
of those who seek to make a united Re
publican part)', and therefore with justice
asks the vote of every ioyai Republican in
the Legislature.
THE WORK OF CONGRES3.
The session of Congress which opens
this morning has the possibility of becom
ing the most important short session in
our annals for many years past. It has
before it the important duty of taking
steps to determine the grave constitu-
tional question whether the recognition
of an independent state is the prerogative
of the President or a part of the duty of
Congress. It has to settle the Pacific
roads question and it has an opportunity
to pass the Nicaragua canal bill.
These constitute the salient opportuni
ties of the session, but there are, of course,
many other measures hardly less impor
tant which will come before Congress be
fore it concludes its labors. The possibili
ties of action are, therefore, great, but at
the same time the constitution of the Sen
ate is such as to render it doubtful
whether even with the vast opportunities
before it the work of this session will be
materially different from that of other
short sessions which have preceded it.
The question of most interest to Califor
nia is, of course, that of the settlement of
the debts of the Pacific roads. The fund
ing bill is to be taken up on Thursday by
the House and according to the arranged
programme the vote will be taken on Mon
day. This allows but small opportunity
for debates and none for dilatory tactics.
The issue is, therefore, already virtually
made up, and so far a3 the fight in the
House is concerned we can do no more
tban has already been done to defeat the
bill and assure the relief of the people of
California from the cinch of the mo
nopoly.
While the advocates of the bill have
been loud in their boasts that it would
easily pass the House it is by no means
certain that they feel as sanguine as they
talk. A minority of the committee hav
ing charge of the subject has reported a
bill favoring the foreclosure of the Gov
ernment claim on the road, and at the
present outloolc there is as much proba
bility of the passage of the minority bill
as of that of the majority. Even if the
tight is lost to the people in tbe House
there is still a chance before the Senate,
and the debate in that body will be long
enough to allow the voice of California to
be heard before the vote is taken.
The Cuban question is one which affects
this country hardly less than Cuba itself.
The controversy which has ziow arisen
brings up ior final solution the issue
whether the President has the right
to exercise an almost exclusive con
trol of onr dealings with foreisn na
tions. It is to be â 'hoped this question
will be determined before Mr. Cleveland
goes out of office, for as President Mc-
Kinley, when he enters upon his admin
istration, will undoubtedly act in accord
ance with the views of Congress there
would be no issue raised by which the
question could be settled. Congress there
fore should act promptly on the recogni
tion of Cuba, in order to put to a test the
claim which Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Olney
make of the right of the President to
ignore the action of Congress on such mat
ters whenever he sees fit to do so.
THE ICE OAENIVAL.
People of Truckee are busily engaged in
preparing for the ice carnival which is
soon to open in that city. The weather
has been propitious for the work and fur
nished all the material of ice aud snow
which is needed for the construction of
the palace and the arrangements of the
toboggan slides. The prospects are that
the festival this winter will far exceed that
of the previous year and that Truckee will
begin our midwinter fetes with a genuine
triumph.
The day for the opening of the festival
has not Leen fixed, as it is designed to
postpone it until everything is in com
plete readiness for the reception of visitors.
At the rate at which the work is progress
ing, however, it is the hope of the man
agers to be able to inaugurate the festival
before the close of this week. If â¢his hope
should be realized it will be a true Isew
Year's celebration and will find the people
ready to enjoy it with all the brightness
and animation which mark the public
mind at the beginning of a new year.
When the ice carnival closes at Truckee
and, perhaps, even before il has ceased to
attract visitors and afford joyous frolics
of tobogganning, skating, sleigh-riding
and all the gayeties which the winter king
offers to his votaries there will be opened
in other parts ol the State citrus fairs or
rose festivals which will employ the ener
gies of amusement-seekers and give them
a new variety of entertainment to delieht
their faculties.
We are, in fact, at the beginning of our
season of festivals. In this we afford a
striking contrast to the East, where the
people are now snowbound, shivering in
blizzards and thinking of almost anything
ei-e than out-of-door gayeties and amuse
ments. These features of California win
ter life will sooner or later be widely noted
in the East and will be among our greatest
attractions to tourists. No other State in
the Union can entertain its visitors with
;ce palaces or floral pavilions at their
choice, nnd no other, therefore, is bo at
tractive to pleasure-seekers of all kinds.

NEW METHOD OF EXERCISE.
Chicago Times-Herald.
M. Quad, the Detroit humorist, several years
ago fitted up a small platform in hiÂ» residence
and took regular exercise by dancing jigs tc
the accompaniment of a piano played by an
other member of the household. He said that
dancing not only gave him the physical ex
ercise he required but also furnished much
needed mental rest. "Walking would do
equally well," he said, "so far as exercise is
concerned, but whenever I wink I am busily
thinking about my work and making plans
for the morrow. No one can do that while
dancing vigorously."
A prominent Chicago lawyer several months
ago hit upon a scheme for exercise that is
equally unusual. He changed his office from
the third floor of a skyscraper to the twelfth.
"My friends use the elevator," he explains,
"but I always walk, both coming up and j;oing
down. It beats any gym nasiumMn creation. I
was led Into this by my Dhysieinn reporting
that my heart was weak and advising hill
climbiu? to strengthen the organ. A Chicago
office building is better tnan any hill I could
find."

EÂ£D AND WHITE LIGHTS.
Powell ' Street to 'Have *an Original
Feature in Its Display.
Before the end of the present week Pow
ell street will be adorned with a most
unique display of electric lights. There
will be an originality about the affair
wnich has not so far been introduced into
any other illuminated street in the City.
It will consist of six white lights on
eacn side of the str-et between Ed ly and
Ellis, and overhead, in the center of the
street, four red lamps. Those will throw
a blending ray down on the stronger light
nearer the ground, tfivinsr, as it is contem
plated, a prismatic radiance to the scene.
It is tne intention of ti.e subscribers to
this additional feature to make Powell
street the most attractive of any of the
recently i'iuminated streets by having the
red lights burn during the entire night,
while the white lamp will be extinguished
at 12 o'clock.
Tne novelty of the liphts, as also the se
curing of the funds with which to carry
out the design, has been the constant
thought and labor of Sam U. Friedlander
of the Columbia Theater, who was the
prime mover in the matter.
His ideas, however, were heartily co
operated in by the principal business peo
ple on the block, who ungrudgingly sub
scribed to tho enterprise with the object
of making this portion of Powell street
the most attractive of any in the City.
Missionary Topics.
The topics ior '97 were given out at the
monthly meeting of the Woman's Occidental
Board yesterday. Instead 01 different coun
tries, as has been the case in the past, the top
ics for '97 embrace a variety of subjects. Jan
uary will bo devoted to "The Bible and For
eign Missions"; February to "Evangelistic
Missionary Work"; March, 'â¢Missionary Ad
ministration"; April, "Native Christians" ;
May, "Woman's Work"; June, "Foreign Mis
sionaries"; July, "MisÃion Printing Press";
August, "The Reflex Influence of Foreign
Missions"; September, "Missionary Schools";
October, "Medical Missions"; Nuvemher, "In
fluence of Christianity on the Social Lite and
Civic Institutions of Heathen Lands"; Decem
ber, "The Home Church and Foreign Mis
sions."
Tilden'a Will Probated.
Judge Coffey yesterday made an order admit
ting to probate the will of the late M. C. Til
den, whereby the son by his second wife Ik
declared disinherited. There was no contest,
but a motion to revoke the admission of the
will to probate may be presented at any time
within a year.
BILLS TO BENEFIT
STATE PRODUCTS
Proposed Laws Before the
Council of Associated
Industries.
Demands for the Appropriation
ot Money for Californian
Exhibits.
A State Food Commissioner Whose
Duty Shall Be to Prosecute Those
Guilty of Adulteration.
A meeting of the Council of Associated
Industries was held yesterday afternoon
in the rooms of the Manufacturers and
Producers' Association, Julian Sonntag,
president, in the cbair.
A letter was read from J. Richard
Freud declining the office of secretary of
the council on the ground that other du
ties prevented him from accepting the
position.
A communication was received from the
secretary of the Guatemala Exhibition
calling attention to the fact that one-tifth
of the part of the floor space ID the exhibi
tion buiiding devoted to the United States
had been set apart for California and
ursine that the people of California make
a creJitable exhibit.
Charles Bundschu drew attention to the
fact that individual efforts do not suffice
to make sue > an exhibit an the State
ought to make and asked the council to
use Its influence in securing an appropri
ation of. say, $5000 to make a display such
a* should be made.
Mr. Jacobs wished to know whether a
bill had been drawn to that effect to pre
sent to the Legislature.
Mr. Bundschu said that none had yet
been prepared. He thpn stated that there
is a need of at least $10,000; that about
$6Â£KX) had been raised, and that if the
sum of $10,000 is secured the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company would contribute
$1000.
Oa motion of E. F. Adams the matter
was referred to a committee consisting of
Messrs. Jacobs, iiealy and Eggles with
instruction to report next Saturday.
The council met for the consideration
of a number of bills which it is proposed
to submit to the Legislature. The first
read was one which provides that all pub
lic institutions shall give preference in the
matter oi goods to those of home manu
facture, all things being equal.
There was quite a discussion on the
question of submitting all bills that it is
proposed to present to the Legislature to
one committee of the council or to sep
arate committees, and finally it was de
cided, on motion of Mr. Kerr, that all bills
offered to the council shall be passed
upon by the council in full.
A bill was offered to appropriate $70,000
for buildings and maintaining a Califor
nia building at the trans-'Mississippi ex*
hibit at Omaha in 1898 and the appoint
ment of three commissioners.
J. A. Filcher explained the proposed
bill, which, be said, emanated from the
Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles,
that several States west of the Mississippi
have already made large appropriations
and that California should make as good a
showing as any other Siate.
Action on the bill was deferred for ten
days.
The next draft of a bill read was that for
the appointment of a State food commis
sioner, three assistants and an expert to
examine food offered for sale, the commis
sioner to be paid $3000, his assistants $1200
and the expert to be paid two-thirda of ihe
amount usually paid exports.
Mr. Jacobs, of the Fruit Exchange, said
the purpose of the bill was to take the
place of the various laws now in existence
to punish the adulteration of food. He
said 'he expense will not exceed $15,000 a
year.
Colonel Denicke waa of the opinion
that the Board of Health has the power to
attend to this matter and that there is no
need of a commissioner. He said that the
Governor, he thought, would veto the
measure because of his opposition to com
missions.
Mr. Jacobs said that the local Board of
Health has indorsed the bill and that the
SState Board of Health is not charged with
the matter of food. Prosecutions at this
time are almost useless, as there seems to
be no power able to make the officers do
their duty.
The bill was referred to a committee of
three, Messrs. Riley, Healy and Jacobs.
The next bifl was one relating to uni
form licenses, which was indorsed.
Another bill was from the State Devel
opment Association, providing for the
establishment by the Frison Directors of
an experimental station for the growth of
fiber under a superintendent of ribercul
ture at a salary of $200 a month and ex
penses not to exceed $50 a month. It also
provides for experiments with the prod
ucts of fiberculture â flax, hemp and ramie.
Colonel Denicke wanted to know what
the University of California was doing at
the experimental stations, five in ntimuer.
He thought if the appropriation was to be
made it siiould be turned over to the uni
versity for the purpose named in the pro
posed law.
The matter was referred to a committee
consisting of Messrs. Adams, Denicko and
Palmer.
The next bill presented was to the effect
that all goods manufactured in prisons
bear the announcement in plain lettering
that such goods were made by convicts.
The council will consider more bills at a
meeting to be held to-morrow afternoon.

to boys between 12 and 17 was held at
the Mission Y. M. C. A. yesterday after
noon, when Rev. Dr. Beard of Grace M. E.
Church spoke to eighty-six boys on "A
Wonderful Workshop." He said that the
brain was the center of the nervous sys
tem and controlled all the actions of the
body. The automatic muscles were con
trolled by the little brain, and these
actions occurred because me muscles had
got into the habit of doing one particular
thing. The speaker impressed on the boys
the importance of forming good habits in
youth, warning the boys especially against
intemperance and impurity.

The American Bark Empire Is
Now Unloading Coal at

The American bark Empire docked at
tbe North Pacific Coast Company's wharf
at Sausalito yesterday. After discharging
her cargo of coal the vessel will be tied up
in â¢ Richardsons Bay to await better timea.
Lying alongside the wharf, with the crew
at work unbending the sails, the Empire
presented a very pretty appearance. Dur
ing a storm which was run into the bark
lo>t her foretop-gallant mast, and that
damage will have to be repaired before
she can again go to sea.
The Harbor Commissioners have put a
watch on the ferry tower. Two fat firemen
on the river steamers have made a wager
in regard to the lime which they will take
to climb the ferry tower and return to
Mother Earth. The man who makes the
best time gets $5, and his opponent is out
and injured. The contestants are mem
bers of the Hit and Miss Athletic Club,
but, nevertheless, President Colnon is not
taking any chances on a probable acci
dent.
Alec Stewart, the champion of tne ferry
steamer Bay City, weighs 319 pounds, and
Frank Sulfivnr.. the champion of the
Modoc, weighs 308 pounds. In spite of their
weichteach man is unusually active, and
quite a number of bets have been made
that the men will climb the tower and get
back to the foundation again in less than
fifteen minutes. If the men make the
climb they will have to do it on the sly, as
from this on a watchman will keep watch
and ward over the tower in order to pre
vent the contest.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Zea
landia will not get away on time. The

are that it will be early Saturday morning
instead of Thursday afternoon before the

tralasia. In the meantime the cargo has
been pouring into her until DOW she is
loaded down with machinery, canned fruit,
canned salmon, broomcorn, doors, whisky,
and, Btranee to say, starch. Tne latter is
a trial shipment, and i* consigned to Syd
ney, N. S. W. Should it prove successful
another industry will have been started in
California.

If the men in the confidence of Gover
nor Budd know anything the next Harbor
Commissioner will be Mark Tarpey. He
will succeed Commissioner Cole and will
thus rill the chair of as faithful a servant
as the State has ever had. Just whether
Mr. Tarpey will take the posit on or not
remains to be seen. His mines in Mexico
claim a great deal of his time and he may
refuse the appointment on that account.
Still the knowing ones say that next
Marcii the Harbor Commissioners will be
Colnon, Chadbourne and Tarpey.
The Miltonburn is the pioneer of a fleet
that will leave here during this month for
Australia. There is no chance for a char
ter party from here before next July, and
in consequence about lifteen vessels will
go to Newcastle. N. S. W., and load coal
for this port at 12 shillings a ton. When
the grain season opens again they will
have a fair chance to get fair rates between
here and Europe.
There are two Jordans on the list of
pilots, and one is called ''Big" Jordan,
and tiie other "Little" Jordan. "Big"
Jordan at the present time is the most
miserable man on earth. He is an invet
erate smoker, and not one of his acquaint
ances can ever remember seeing him with
out a rigar in his mouth. When Bryan
lost the election Jordan had to quit smok
ing with the new year and abstain for six
months. Now everybody that meets him
on Change has a package of chewing gum
on hand in order to console the unfortun
ate pilot. Never in al! his life has Jordan
had so many free cigars offered him, but
still he has the satisfaction of knowing
that should he last out the six months,
Dillon wiil give him the best chronome
ter in his shop. Virtue always has its
own reward.

CYCLISTS WANT
BUT ONE FAVOR
The Passage of the Bag
gage Bill by This
Legislature.
All Their Efforts Are to Be
Concentrated to Insure
That Result.
Juige Kerrigan Says Judge Dunne
and Others Will Go Up to Make
the Fight.
The wheelmen want but one thing from
the present Legislature. They want to
have tne bicycle recognized as baggage,
that it may be carried free as such on the
railroads of this State.
Every effort will be concentrated upon
the so-called baggage|bill to insure its pus
sage. One man is already on the ground
at Sacramento looking out for the inter
ests of the wheelmen and keeping the
league officials informed, and another will
probably soon go to the capital from this
City.
When the different committees of the
Legislature shall have been named and
the time shall have arrived for the hear
ing of proposed bills a special delegation
will go from here and advance arguments
in favor of the baggage bin. It will be
clearly and forcibly explained to the com
mittee in order that at the outset it may
rec9ive proper indorsement before it shall
come to a vote.
Speaking last night of the legislation
desired by the cyclists, Judge Frank H.
Kerrigan, consul of the League ol Ameri
can Wheelmen, said:
"The wheelmen throughout the State
will concentrate their fight upon what ii
sometimes known as the Armstrong bag
gage bill. It is a bill permitting a passen
ger to carry his bicycle, his guncase, his
valise, or his trunk as baggage without
charge. No mention is made of a bicycle,
but the bill is so worded that all such
articles as a person is in the habit of
carrying with him may come under the
head of allowable baggage not exceeding
the weight limit.
"Baggage-bill planks were introduced
into the platforms of all the political
parties not only in the municipal conven
tions but in all the subdivisions of the
State. We saw to that. Each party is
pledged to support the bill.
"We have voters enough to carry it. The
only thing that can beat it is the possibie
trading of some of these votes to the rail
road in exchange for the support by the
railroad of certain interior matters for
which support may be desired. The ques
tion is, Does the railroad care enough
about it to trade votes? But we are going
to keep a careful lookout. Dwyer, one of
our men, is up there now. He is one ot
the clerks; has been for several years. He
will keep his eyes open. Then Percy V.
Long, a representative of the league, will
go up shortly to introduce the bill. When
the proper committee is ready to bear a
discussion of the bill severaf men will go
up from hereâ Judge Dunne and some
others â and will see that the thing is
properly explained and understood.
"As for the good roads bill, that will be
attended to primarily by the State Bureau
of Highways, and supported, of course, by
the wheelmen."
fOLIOE STOPPED THE CROWD
Yesterday at the Great Closing Out Sale
of Arinand Cailleau.
There was such a larjje crowd that
thousands were turned away without
being able to get into the store. Mr.
Cailleau nad about forty extra salespeople,
yet the police had to be there to oversee
the people. At the rate the goods were
going the sale will not last long.
They Want 100 Per Cent.
The Retail Grocers' Association has in

the known creditors of Levin Bros, copies of a
circular, previously prepared, urging them not
to accept from the embarrassed firm any set
tlement save upon a basis of 100 cents on the
dollar. The circular has also been presented
to the Board of Trade.
Levin Bros, have not yet submitted any
proposition whatever to their creditors. The
C'.'niniittre of adjusters at present engaged on
behalf of the Board of Trade in taking kii In
ventory of the stock in the firm's several
stores will probably not be able to make a re
port within a week. Pending this report the
creditors say they can take no formal action.

Judge Seawall Has Charge of Superior
Court Allah's.
The annual meeting of the Judges of
the Superior Court was held yesterday, all

Rule 14. When a demurrer to a complaint or
cross-complaint is overruled by the court and

out the written consent cf the adverse party
or his attorney; and if the complaint or cross
compiaint is unverified, leave to answer shall
not be given unless an affidavit of merits be

which any act is required by law to Ac done

nection with any other order or orders or any
stipulation, shall operate to extend such time

by law.
In case the time within which any act is re
quired by law to be done is extended by stipu
lation, no extension of time shall afterward

order shall correctly show upon its face the
extensions of time previously given. Every

MILLIONS IN A
COURT DECISION
After Eight Years of Liti
gation A. B. Bowers
Wins His Suit.
The Most Important Patent Case
Ever Tried on This
Coast.
About Forty Cases for Infringement
Pending on the Issueâ Big Con
tracts Are Involved.
By a decision of the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, handed down yes
terday, A. B. Bowers virtually owns a
monopoly of the hydraulic dredging busi
ness. The decision Mr. Bowers estimates
as worth a trifle above six millions to
him â ail the way from six to fifteen
millions.
The decision came in the suit of Bowers
against yon Schmidt â which is one among
many casesâ but the decision is supposed
to end nearly all the others. The lan
guage of the decision is that Mr. Bowers
is the original inventor of the hydraulic
dredger and that his patents are entitled
to broad and liberal construction.
The fight lias been going on for eight
years, and testimony has been taken suffi
cient to cover 2477 large printed page?.
The suit which was concluded yester
day was begun in November, 1888. In
July, 1894 â six years later â a decision was
rendered by Judge McKenna in favor of
Bowers. An appeal wus taken, and pend
ing the decision of the Court of Appeals
a great deal of work has been tied up, as
well as other litigation stayed.
Judges Ross and Gilbert participated in
the decision, Judge Hay being disquali
fied through his having decided certain
minor points in the same case.
No less than eighteen suits are now in
the courts against alleged infringements
of these patents, and some twenty others
are about to be entered. Among the for
mer are suits against the Pacific Improve
ment Company, the American Dredging
Company, tbe Oakland Iron Works, the
New York Dredgijkg Company, the San
Francisco Bridge Company, Pacific Coast
Dredging and Reclamation Company,
American Hydraulic Dredging Company,
Lindon W. Bates, Hydraulic Dredging
and Improvement Company and the City
of Oakland.
This involves a check to a number of
big contracts, notably tbe dredging of the
Oakland harbor, the big drainage canal at
Chicago and the dredging of "the city
waterway" in the liaroor of Tacoma.
These big jobs, undertaken by rival
companies with the objectionable dredg
ers, may not be stopped, to be sure, but
they will have to go forward on a basis of
settlement with Bowers.
The decision is vory far-reaching. It
will put dredging, so far as it is done by
hydraulic suction dredging, in the hands
of A. B. Bowers, and this not only applies
to the work going on in this country and
to go on, but to big contracts in the har
bors of the world, notably some in Japa
nese and Russian harbors, contracts for
which are about to be awarded.
The big work being done at Tacoma has
been practically awaiting this aecisioti.
An application was made in the courts
there by Bowers for a preliminary injunc
tion on the strength of the decision of
Judge McKenna, but it was denied. This
decision will serve to secure the injunc
tion. The work there is being done by
the New York Dredging Company. The
work in Oakland harbor is being done by
the San Francisco Bridge Company.
The attorneys for Mr. Bowers in this,
said to be the most important patent case
ever tried on this coast, were John H.
Miller and John L. Boone. The briefs on
tile in the Circuit Court were presented by
Mr. Miller. The lung tight made by Mr.
Bowers, and which means millions to him,
has been fought for much of the time
under great financial embarrassment.
The defendants in the suits mill to be
brought include corporations, private in
dividuals, United States engineers and
the United Btate3 Government. It is
likely, however, that compromises will
be effected and that they will be required
to pay a royalty for using their dredgers.
The "cost of a hydraniic dredger of the
Bowers type is about $40,000, so that it
may be found cheaper to pay royalty than
to throw tbe big machines away that are
decreed to be infringements.
Heirs to a Snug .Estate.
Last Christmas Elizabeth Bollard was found
dead in her home in Providence, R. 1., her
husband having died a low days before. An
open letter was by her side addressed to her
niece. Miss Elizabeth Napier, 256 Eighth
street, this City, who with her widowed
mother are thought to be the only heirs of the
Ballards. The property of the Ballards com
prises a house and lot and some other real es
tate in Providence, and the estate is under
stood to ba valued at $6000 or $7000. Mrs.
Napier has written East to the Providence au
thorities claiming the estate. As yet she has
received no particulars concerning its value.
ONLY A SOLID
SEVEN IS LEFT
Supervisors Clinton and
Dodge Break the Com
bination.
They Would Not Caucus With
the Raineyites Regarding
Patronage.
Police Court Clerks an! Prosecuting
Attorneys Selected by the
"Organization."
There was no caucus of Supervisors last
night, as many politicians expected.
Nothing remained to be done, and they
were all at sea about one little thing or
another â or in other words, something
had dropped in camp. After the open
meeting the only thins remaining Unset
tledâat least so far as the Democratic ma
jority was concerned â was that trifling
matter of places on the Hospital Commit
tee of the board. This committee is al
ready under the control of the physicians,
but some difficulty has Deen experienced
in getting a third man to serve with them.
Seven of the Rainey Supervisors in cau
cus voted to relinquish their prerogative
of appointing various City employes. To
come nearer tlie truth, the solid seven
(pro tempore) â Supervisors Rottanzi, De
lany, Devany, Has Kins, liivers, Sheehan
and Britt â decided finally in formal man
ner to give "ihe patronage to the organ
ization," meaning the privilege of select
ing City clerks and officials to Boss
Rainey.
One of the most important duties falling
to the Supervisors' lot is this selection of
men to perform City work. Rule and
precedent make it incumDent on the ap
pointed officers to select with care, hon
estly and intelligently these employes of
the municipality, ana, indeed, this very
duty is encompassed in the pledge made
by the Supervisors. But the first act
almost of the solid seven (pro tern.) is the
open violation of this duty to the City.
Instead of choosing proper persons they
leave that part of toe municipal business
to Boss Rainey.
The first serious inkling of a rumpus,
which could not be overlooked, became
apparent Saturday night when the seven
ring Supervisors met at Boss Rainey's
beck in Dr. Rottanzi's offices at Third
and Folsom streets. This caucus began
shortly after 8 o'clock Saturday evening
and came to a close at 1 a. m. fSunday.
Drs. Clinton and Dodge were absent, tne
former at a banquet in the California
Hotel given by the retiring Board of Eiu
cation to the incoming School Directors,
and as for Dr. Dodge, he was attending
to his own business. Neither of them
would have anything to do with the
caucus.
They gave it the glassy eye. But as
there could not be a consultation of physi
cians Dr. Rottanzi prescribed medicine to
steady the nerves and allay the mental
disturbance of his colleagues. The dose
was to be taken repeatedly: "Sp. Fru
menti, two fincers; aqua Spring Valley,
nit." Spring Valley was good enough to
toast on such an. occasion. As the story
goes there was no other consolation and j
the solid seven (pro tern.) voted to let
Rainey select the men for City Hall
offices.
Supervisors Clinton and Dodge, it now
appears, told their Democratic brothers of
the board that they would positively ob
ject to allowing any one except the board
itself to make the appointments. This
was their duty to the people and their
right. And so the Democratic majority of
nine came to be badly demoralized, lor
Dodge and Clinton took a stand for the
right. The two Supervisors have parted
company with the Rainey seven, and may
be looked lor to appear as independent in
their voting.
It leaked out last night that the solid
majority would \e larger than seven,
witn Dodge and Ciinton out of it as a re
spectable minority. Anyhow, the cheer
ing additional fact was stated in this con
nectionâthe Spring Valley pipes will be
safe.
The Police Court prosecuting attorneys
have been named. They are E. P. Mogan,
Robert Mann, Charles F. O'Callaghan and
Charles A. Reynolds. Frank Drury was
withdrawn in favor of Reynolds, but there
still was some doubt about this office, as
Spinetti's chances improved considerably
yesterday through the influence of the
Fire Department.
The Police Court clerks have been se
lected as follows: Samuel Kohlman, who
was in Block's office; Joseph Hayes of the
Forty-second district, and now in the
Sheriff's office; Thomas Farrell, thÂ« Sixth
street, plumber, and Captain John Foley of
the Forty-fifth district. Folev claims he
got the district from Gavin Me.Nab, and
his appointment insures, the Forty-fifth in
the Rainey column â to the victor, etc.

COOK AND DUNNE
ASCEND THE BENCH
Two New Judges in the
Superior Court of
This City.
Ceremonies of Induction in De
partments Eleven and
Twelve.
Ex-Judge D. J. Murphy Was Eloquently
Eulog:z;d by cx-Judga Robert
Ferrai.
Two changes in the personnel of the
Superior Court Judges occurred yesterday
âJudges Jfnrphy and Sanderson retiring
and Judge i?rank H. Dunne and Judge
Carroll Cook assuming their positions on
tlie bench.
In Department 11 the introduction of
Judge Dunne was performed by Judge
Delcher, who for some time has presided
" over that department but who did not de
vote himself to the trial of civil cases. A
great many attorneys and other citizens
interested in the change were present for
the purpose of manifesting their gratifica
tion upon Judge Dunne's accession to the
place, for which he was chosen by so largo
a popular vote.
After Judge Belcher's remarks Judge
. Dunne called the morning's calendar and
decided that a general calendar be made
up for the department, the same to be
called at 10 o'clock to-morrow.
In Department 12 there were also some
interesting proceedings. Judge Murphy,
the veteran jurist, ascended the steps, ac
companied by Judge Cook, who as an at
torney has made a name for himself in the
criminal branch of the law.
The courtroom was crowded, many of
the noted members of the San Francisco
bar being in attendance. Judge Murphy
smiled as be looked over the throng and,
standing wiuii his hand on the reading
desk in front of him and indicating the
presence of Judge Cook by a gracious nod
o" the head, he said:
It is hardly necessary for me to introduce to
the members of the bar the presiding Judge
of Department 12. He is not alone weil known
io us all, but to the public generally, and it
affords me great pleasure to state that he will
be presiding Judge of this department I hope
ior ihe full Term of six years, lor wuieh he is
elected, and for many years thereafter, and the
clerk win spread upon the minutes of the court
the commission of Judge Cook In full.
I am weil satisfied that the bar will find in
Judge Cook a courteous, kind and considerate
Judge, and lie will undoubtedly expect the
baiue consideration, attention and respect
irom the bar, which he will, without question,
receive; and in introducing him and retiring
from the bench all I have to say on behalf of
myself is that I return my sincere thanks to
the members of the bar for the courtesies al
ways expended to me. I have endeavored to
do my duty and to treat ihe bar with that con
gideration to which it is entitled, and perhaps
in many instances I lailed to do so, but it was
more the result ot the .head than the. heart.
Judge Cook is now ia possession of Depart
ment 12.
There were manifestations when Judge
Murphy concluded his remarks, and Judge
Cook responded in these words:
On assuming the duties to which I have been
elected by the citizens of this community,
there is but little that I can say. As Juage
Murphy hns said, the members of the bar of
this City all know me. 1 have been one of you
now forever twenty years, and my oniy hope
is tnat in the new duties which 1 will be called
uj.ou to fulfill, I may be ade, by reason of my
experience as a practitioner and advocate, to
appreciate the difficulties tnat members of the
bar labor under in prosecuting cases entrusted
to their care, and to realize that it is some
times their zeal rather than anything else that
may cause them to persist in matters which
may not be entirely well founded.
1 know that in this community 1 have many
friends, aad I presume some who are not
iriends. but I will say to all that out of my
court 1 shall do my utmost to keep and main
tain whatever friends I have, but upon enter
ing the portals of this court my individuality
shall be entirely luid aside anu I shall know
neither friend nor ioe; whoever appears here
belore me shall be treated impartially, and I
intend to show the same consideiation for one
man as another, and my individuality shall in
bo case cut any part.
I hope that the members of the bar and my
self will always find our connections and busi
ness associations pleasant, ?.nd I shall cer
tainly do all iv my power to make them so,
nnd 1 will ask the members of the bar and I
know they will endeavor on their part to do
the same toward me.
Ex-Judge Robert Ferral arose and in a
*7ery impressive manner greeted the in
coming Judge, at tne same time paying a
merited tribute to Judge Murphy, who
was just retiring. He said :
If your Honor please, while it is entirely un
necessary for any member of the bar to in
dulge in any words, 1 desire to state that the
community at large has paid you a very high
compliment in electing you by a most extraor
dinary majority. 1 feel thc.t they are well
satisfied with the people's choice, and when
your Honor's time lor retiring has come and
you are about to resume active practice that
you will leave the bench as your predecessor,
Judge Murphy, tins, with the good opinions of
the bar and the public generally.
I feel that on this occasion it would be a
wrong to allow his Honor, Judge Murphy,
to pass from the sphere ot his public service
without a woru, and as one wno has a long
practice at the bar and served on the bench,
â who has knottn Mm for many years extend
ing over a quarter of a century, and knowing
the feeling entertained for him by all the
practitioners both in the civil department
and in those devoted to criminal busi
ness, I think it is proper to say
this, that as ho went on the bench
twelve years ago auei a very active life in the
practice and a me which is necessarily given
to many antagonisms, as it is utterly impossi
ble to carry on the prosecution of his pro
fession, particularly in criminal iaw, without
malting some enemies, yet he was elected by
his feilow citizens because they had seen his
life and believed that he was pre-eminently
well qualified to adorn the bench, and he has
so performed his clmies us to speedily win the
confidence of all the community 'and the
respect of th? members of the bar.
The only regret during his whole term of
office that I have heard expressed in regard to
Judge Murphy is, that he chose to take a civil
department, because we who practice here,
particularly in thÂ« departments devoted to
criminal business, felt we had sustained a loss
just as the community had in probably the
ablest criminal lawyer on the bench.
I know it is ii very popular mistake that
almost any party cun be a criminal lawyer, and
almost auybedy can be a criminal judge, but
to those who understand, that is a very grave
and serious mistake.
It was a positive loss when we were unable
to again secure Judge Murphy's services, De
cause, as your Honor well knows, he was nol a
candidate for re-e'.ection. He desired to lay
aside the responsibility, the care and worri
rnent necessarily attached to the office, and to
again go back to practice. Had he Chosen to
serve the public further there is no question in
the world but what they would be delighted
to honor him with the position he so -well and
nobly fulfilled; and now In going ont of office
I feel that he has endeared himself to the pro
fession and to the community, and I do not
think there is a member of the bar to-day who
has any ill-feeling against him; but, on tie
contrary, that by his course of conduct, by the
manner in which he penormed his duty, by
that impartial character and that freedom,
and that stern determination to udminister
the law i:s it should be administered, honestly,
ably, conscientiously and kindly, he has
won their re.spect, tueir admiration and their
love, and I speak tne sentiments of the bar ol
San Francisco when I say we part with him
with sincere regrets, and realizing that his re
tirement irom the bench is a public loss to the
profession and to the community. I only
hope tnat should he again weary of practice iv
the next two years ho will consent to
again resume the Judicial mantle and the po
t-iiion he so nobly and honorably wore. Iv his
retirement he carries with him the respect,
confidence and admiration of all this com
munity, ana not only this community, but the
Biate at. large, because he made a State reputa
tion while serving the public of San Francisco.
Judge Cook responded in a similar man
ner, saying:
In that respect. Judge Ferral, I can only re
ply you riMve, iv everything you huve said, as
to the retiriiiK judge of 'his department,
voiced my individual sentiments. I have
known Judge Murphy ever since I was first
admitted to practice. At the bar of this City
I have appeared before him on many oc
casions as counsel, and I know that I never
in my whole experience at the bar appeared
before a judge who was in every way so
capable, so fair and so impartial as was the
juuge who is now retiring from this bench. I
know that no matter what question might
ftave arisen before him, they were all care
fully and conscientiously considered, and if
in his mind there arose any doubt as to what,
the law was, that doubt was always resolved
as it should be, in favor of the weaker party,
and I only hope that during the term that 1
shall be upon the bench as his successor,
1 may be able when I leave it to leave it with
the reputation equal to that of my prede
cessor.
Judge Murphy was visibly affected by
these expressions of appreciation by one
of the best known practitioners at the
local bar.
At the conclusion of the ceremonies
Joseph P. Stevens was appointed court
room stenographer and Oscar Tolie took
his position as clerk.
In Judge Dunne's department Luke
Kavanaugh was appointed official re
porter and Joseph Riley assumed the
duties of clerk.
Judges Hunt and Hibbard needed no
formality to induct them into office, as
they were re-elected to serve another
term of six years each. They ordered
their own election commissions spread
on the minutes of their respective courts,
and went ahead with the judicial tread
mill as if nothing bad happened.

A GAME OF EUCHRE.
John Henneggy, an Old Man, Alleges
That He Was Swindled Out of
Twenty Dollars.
John Hennessy, an old man employed
by the Street Department, lives at 8 Ivy
avenue. He is fond of a game of euchre,
and a night or two before Christmas he
dropped into ihe saloon on the corner.
Michael Hannan, the bartender, Thomas
Cochrane and Joseph Mclnerny .were hav
ing a quiet game, and Hennessy was in
duced to taJce a hand.
Next day Hennessty swore to a complaint
in Judge Joachimsen's court charging
Coclirane with petty larceny, and the case
came on for trial yesterday. Hennessy in
his evidence was very bitter against Coch
rane and the saloon. He said lie first lost
fifty cents, then $5, and he went heme and
returned with v $20 gold piece. They had
been playine for a shore ticie when Coch
rane took the $20 gold piece from under
a cribbage- board, where Hennessy had
placed it, and reiused to give it ud.
Cochiane, Hannan and Mclnerny all
testified that the old man had lost the $20
fairly at the game, and was mad at having
to part with so much money.
The Judge will render his decision this
morning.

Red Branch Hall, corner of Mason and

ticular importance will come up lor dis
cussion relative to proposed changes in
the game and fish laws a large attendance
is expected.
Some very excellent bags of quail were
scored on Saturday and Sunday in the
vicinity of Point Reyes. Louis Meyers
and Thomas Walsh killed eighty-three
birds. Frank Vernon had a miscellaneous
string, consisting of quail, duck, cotton
tail rabbits, snipe and rabbits. He was
the proudest man on the cars returning
from Point Reyes Sunday evening. Billy
Kittle, the champion wing shot of the
Country Club, had been a martyr to rheu
matism for some weekÂ« and as a conse
quence few birds of any kind were regis
tered from the Country Club on Sunday.
John K. Orr was snipe-shootiug on the
club preserve last Saturday, and according
to his own statement he shot his doe acci
deatally. Some people said tbat the
canine "refused to obey orders and had to
be punished.
Lloyd Eaton, Al Newman, Victor Har
rier, the champion canvasback extermina
tor of Solano County, and "Bill Nye" had
a very chilly experience Friday and Sat
prday last on Tomales Bay. The sports
men left this City with the avowed in
tention of decimating the flocks of sea
brant that have, so to speak, taken pos
session of Tomales Bay. On their arrival
at a station named Hamlet they inquired
for the hotel and were escorted by a fisher
man to a resort which is known by a few
local sportsmen who are fond of brant
shooting as "the rest for the weary." "Bill
Nye" gives a description as follows of the
Hotel de Hamlet and the hunt:
"The fisherman escorted us to a house,
or shack, more properly speaking, that
had certainly seen better days.
"There was only one bed in the house
and that was occupied by the landlord,
but we were offered a bunk in a big fishing
smack, which was sufficiently large to ac
comodate four persons. The blankets,
sheets, etc., were made of potato sacks,
but we had to make the best of it, as there
was no use in kicking under the circum
stances.
''Well, we did not enjoy a very solid
night's rest, because you know an early
rise meant to us a big bag of birdsâ at
least we thought so.
"Saturday morning, long before the
gray streaks of daylight appeared in the
pastern horizon, we were out in Tomales
Bay waiting 'coldly' for the coming of the
sea brant, but luck was against us, and
only one solitary fool brant looking roossi
bly for a lost mate came within gun shot.
Well, he received a red-hot reception any
how, and I intend to sample the meat of
this highly prized bird to-morrow. I expect,
however, ~to find mo:e lead than meat, as
the poor bird received eight charges of No. '6
shot, but everything goes when you eat
gamÂ« birds, you know.
"We woulu have done well had it not
been for a very high tide which spoils
brant shooting in Tomales Bay. My
friend Vie promised birds to all his friends
in Vallejo to-morrow, and as a friend shot
two doze., sea crows for us, Vie will try to
induce the Vallejoites that they are brant,
and I guess he will carry his point, If not,
then there will De a picnic."
Harry Golcber returned with about one
dozen quail from Point Reyes. He stated
that the birds were in the" heavy under
growth, and would not flush to open
ground.
Cooper, the famous snipe shot, John
Kerrigan, A. Lawrence and Louis Ron
deau bad fairly good snort, each scoring
a good mÂ«ss of quail.
Frank Dolliver failed to bag many ducks
on Sunday. He missed five eood shots,
and his dog, "Lealherhoad," returned to
the hotel dicnstsd, but Frank, instead of
shooting at the dog, praised the animal
for his good sense and judgment. Charley
Brecht bagged one dozen snipe near Shell
viile. Anglers who visited Point Reyes
met with very poor luck. It is generally
thought that fishermen are netting the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
WIELDED AN AX
WHIT GREATH EFFECT
Very Exciting Scene Wit-
nessed on Sherman
Street.
Gustave Fingler Starts In to
Demolish the Rcof of a
House.
He Is Arrested on Charges of Assault
With a Deadlj Weapcn and
Malicious Mischief.
Sherman street, a small street running
south from Folsom to Harrison streets,
between Sixth and Seventh, was packed
with people yesterday afternoon for nearly
two tours.
A man was on the roof of 16}Â£ with
an ax in his hand, cutting up the roof and
knocking down the brick chimneys. The
occupants of the building, which is a two-
Gustave Fingler "Working on the Roof He Thought He Owned.
story house, were standing outside, terror
stricken, and men were on the roof of the
adjoining house too frightened to attempt
an assault upon the man with the ax.
Word was sent to the Southern police
station and Policemen T. L. Ryan and
Ed ODea were sent with the patrol wagon
to arrest the man. When they reached
the place there was a hot exchange with
bricks going on between the man with the
ax and three brothers named Kennedy,
who live next door and had climbed to the
roof of their house.
A long ladder was procured and Ryan
and ODea mounted to the roof of 16%.
\Vhen they reached the roof the man
dropped the ax down the chimney and
surrendered to the officers without a
struggle. The crowd cheered the officers
as they descended the ladder with their
prisoner and drove off with him to the
Southern station, where he was booked on
charges ot assault with a deadly weapon
and malicious mischief. One of the bricks
thrown by the man struck Willie Kenne
dy on the hand, nearly breaking the
bones, for which the first-named charge is
made.
The man with the ax was Gustaye Fing
ler, a cripple, 39 years of ape, Jiving in
Alamcia with his mother. He formerly
owned the house, but was dispossessed by
Flynn & Treacy, contractors, about eigh
teen months aÂ«o by order of the Superior
Court, as he refused to pay his share of an
assessment for laying a basalt pavement
on the street.
Fingler in explanation of bis conduct
said: "I am the rightful owner of the
property, as it was illegally taken from
me by force in June, 1895, by Flynn &
Treacy. I did not sign the petition for v
basalt pavement, neither did my mother,
and they could not legally assess me
for H.
"I have notified them several times that
I am the owner of the property, and last
December I inserted a notice in The Call
that I intended maKing alterations to tlie
house. It was with that intention that I
went there to-day and cut ud the roof and
knocked down the chimneys. They can
not convict me of malicious mischief as
the property is mine.
"The charge of assault with a deadly
weapon is unfair. I did not throw any
bricks at the Kennedys till one of them
struck me on the jaw with a brick. Then
I had to defend myself.
"1 deny that Flynn & Treacy ever got
an order of court dispossessing me of the
property, and the records in the County
Clerk's office will show it. The lawyers
have been all against me and I cannot
get my rights."
The roof of the house, which a flat one,
is all cut to pieces and the chimneys are
demolished. The furniture of Mrs. A.
Gallacher and Miss Pauline Field, who
occupy the upper flat, is almost entirely
destroyed by the falling debris, and they
threaten to compel Fingler to make good
the loss. The lower flat is occupied by
Mrs. Catherine Flaherty. All the tenants
have been paying tbeir rents to Flynn &
Treacy. __^___________
STEUOK WITH A BOTTLE.
Harry F. Mann, a Shoemaker, and His
Wife Assaulted by a Customer.
Harry F. Mann has a shoe-repairing
shoo at 715 Hyde street. Last evening a
young man called for a pair of shoes he
he had left last week to be repaired. He
said he had no money, but would pay
Mann as soon as he was in funds.
Mann refused to give up the shoes un
less he was paid, and the young man left
He returned in a few minutes and struck
Mann on the head with an empty bottle,
inflicting a scalp wound. The bottle was
broken by the blow, and as Mrs. Mann
rushed to her husband's assistance the
young man struck her on the arm with
the broken bottle, which cut through the
sleeve of her dress and into the flesh. He
ran away, leaving his hat in the shop.
The patrol wagon was summoned, and
Mann and his wife were taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where their wound"
were dressed. They said they did not
know the name of the young man.
Policeman Bailey was detailed on the
case, and has possession of the hat as a
clew.
AS TO PEEFEEEED OEEDITOES.
An Interesting Point Decided in the
United States Circuit Court.
An interesting point came tip In the
United States Circuit Court yesterday in
the case of the Atlantic Trust Company
against the Wood bridge Canal and Irri
gation Company. This action is on the
ioreclosure of a mortgage on the canal
company's bonds.
In this there is no contest, but soon
after ilie action was begun a number of
creditors of the canal company appeared
in the case as intervenord. They set up
the claim that their claims should be first
satislied and the intervenors classed as
preferred creditors. These claims they
based upon the fact that some were em*
plores of the company and others had
furnished materials, etc. In other words
they should be preferred in the same
sense as a mechanic has a lien upon a
building upon which he has labored.
To these claims the trust companjrde
murred. Yesterday Judge McKenna
overruled the demurrer and gave the
trust company an opportunity to answer.
That is, he sustained the claims of a num
ber of intervenors and said that their
claims should hold pood over those of the
mortgage bonds, as it is necessary to keep
the canal as a "eoing concern," as he c-x
--pressed it. A number of claims of the in
tervenors he held were not entitled to
special consideration and they should be
duly considered when the main case
comes on nearing, which will probably be
before the Master in Chancery.
TO STAND HIS TRIAL.
Nicholas firennan, <li <â¢ Betrayer of
Teresa Tarpey, Held to Answer.
Nicholas Brennan, the stenographer,
was yesterday held to answer Defore the
Superior Court by Judge Con Jan on
charges of criminal assault, extortion and
placing a minor in a disreputable house.
The bonds on each charge were fixed at
$3000.
Brennan is accused of having caused the
death of Teresa Tarpey, a young girl,
about two weeks ago. The day before her
death Judge Conlan held court at her bed
side and secured her dying testimony, in
which she chareed Brennan with the
crimes for which he will stand trial. The
cirl lived with her parents at 2820 Green
wich street.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Divorce suits were filed yesterday as follows :
Jeannie Marie Bigue against Jean Bigue; Ar
thur J. Allen against Lena AUen ; Daniel Gor

Stoner against D. P. Stone r.
ENTERTAINED BY SOROSIS
The Ladies Give a Reception
in Honor of Frank
Lincoln.
Belles and Beaux at the Second Meet-
ing of the Monday Night
Dancing Class.
It is not often that a guest of honor con
tributes so yreatly to the success of an af
fair as did Frank Lincoln, tbe popular
humorist, at the reception given by
Sorosis, complimentary to him.
Mr. Lincoln and Hugo Mnnsfeldt, the
pianist, were the only representatives of
the sterner sex present, and taking all
things into consideration it must be said
that the ladies passed through the ordeal
not only triumphantly, but gracefully.
Mrs. H. E. Huntington Lad charge of
the programme, and the excellent variety
she presented reflects more than ordinary
credit upon her abilities as a hostess. At
2:30 the ladies began to arrive, attired in
handsome reception and calling gowns
and muffled to the chin in rich costly furs.
Holly and mistletoe, relics of the joyous
season scarcely yet passed, made the ar
tistic rooms brignt and festive like.
Eacti number of the programme was re
ceived with approving applause. Hugo
Mausfeldt gave with eiqciisite delicacy
Chopin's "Marche Funebre. " and for an
encore Lizt's "Campanella." Miss Cor
nel! followed with two vocal solos. "Part
ing" and "Her Guests." Then Mrs. D. H.
Kinney followed with an excellent paper
on "Our Duty to the Sick.' 1
Preceding Mr. Lincoln's monologues,
which brought the entertainment to a
close, Miss Cornell sang "Maying," and
gave for an encore a delightful character
song, "In Winter I Get Up by Candle
Lieht."
Mr. Lincoln during his slay in town has
given many samples of his art, and his
contributions to yesterday's programme
were made up of his choicest bits. His
stuttering lover's proposal put the audi
ence in rare good humor and he followed
rapidly with his travesty on grand opera
and his ABC sermons.
After the programme, between scalding
sips of Russian tea, Mrs. Huntinjjton pre
sented the guest of honor to the ladies
assembled, and the compliments of the
season were exchanged.
Golden Gate Hall was the scene of a
brilliant assemblage last evening, the oc
casion being the second meeting this sea
son of the Monday NiÂ«ht Dancing Class.
The guests were received by the patron
essess of the club, Mrs. Cav-tam Taylor,
Mrs. Carolan, Mrs. Smedberg, Mrs. Hoff
man, Mrs. McNutt, Mrs, Thomas Breeze,
Mrs. T. C. Van Ness, Mrs. Sidney M.
Smith, Mru. William Gwin Jr.. Mrs.
Georpe Pope, Mrs. Oseood Hooker and
Mrs. Winthrop E. Lester.
According to the rules of the class the
guests arrived early and dancing was at
once inaugurated.
At midnight light refreshments were
served.
NEW SERVIAN SOCIETY.
It Is Called the "Unanimity" and Will
Be Benevolent.
About forty gentlemen of Servian de
scent met Tuesday evening in the Palace
Hotel and organized a new benevolent
society called "Serbsfco Jerdutsto" and
elected the following officers: President,
M. E. Ljinbobratich; Vice-president, C.
Antonioii; treasurer, M. L. Metrovich;
recording secratary, N. A. Ragenovich ;
financial secreiary, B. Prokuriza. Trus
tees â N. L. Satencicb, L. Petriz and G. D.
Fabris. Physician. C. A. Glover, M.D.
After formally organizing and instruct
ing the officers, Mr. Petrovich made a very
appropriate and stirring address on the
benefits to be derived from benevolent
societies and condemned the practice of
allowing religious dissensions to crop up
among the members. He closed witn an
earnest and patheiic appeal to the mem
bers to make "Serbsko Jerduisto," which
signifies unanimity, their watchword.
A committee of three, consisting of F.
de Cortoni, K. Ragenovich and V. Vusco
vicb, was then appointed to complete ar
rangements for a banquet which is to be
given in Pythian Castle Hall on the even
ing of January 26, the finniversary of the
great Servian holiday, Savin-dair.

A space has been set apart in the rooms of

DR. ALEXANDERS
SCATHING WORDS
Scores the Journal, " Twin
Sister of the Examiner
of This City."
The Noted Divine Gives a Word
Picture of Princeton Cele
bration.
Ray. Dr. Wcodworth Gets a Presenta
tion Hatâ R:V. Dr. Youag on
Isaiab as a Politician.
Rev. Dr. Alexander pave the Presby
terian Ministerial Association a frank and
humorous word picture yesterday of the
recent one hundred and fiftieth celebra
tion of Princeton Colleee. The speakers
and the speeches were all described, and
the address concluded with a few coming
ideas for the Pacific Coast, which had been
suggested by the doctor's visit East.
Cleveland's address st Princeton was
spoken of by Dr. Alexander in high terms.
"The President was very simple in hia
diction, which was good sense on his part,
as men of much more learning than he
possesses were present. His sentiments
were everywhere well received, except by
the New York Journal, the twin-sister of
the Examiner here, and it attacked him
very severely â I suppose, for advocating
honesty."
In summing up the results of his ob
servations at Princeton, Rev. Dr. Alexan
der said: "The academic gown and cap
appear to have come to stay, not only in
the college, but the pulpit. 1 suppose the
custom of preaching in the cap will get
l.ere in time."
The address concluded with the hope
that "God would put it into the heart of
some rich man 10 build a Presbyterian
college on the Pacific Coast, where stu
dents would have the religious influence
that they obtain at Pr.nceton."
The association elected officers yester
day, and when tho announcement was
made that Rev. James Woodworth had
been le-elected treasurer and secretary,
Rev. F. R. Farrand, the retiring presi
dent, rose and made a neat little speech of
congratulation to Mr. Woodworlh for his
eight years of efficient service as secre
tary. He said that in ancient times it
was the custom to crown the victor with a
wreath, and after describing tho wreaths
of Greek times, Mr. Farrand added: "I
teil you that our Brother Woodworth de
serves them all. I take great pleasure in
putting on our brother's head this mod
ern crown," and with these words he
drew a handsome new hat from a band
box ana placed it on Mr. Woodworth's
head.
In his speech of acknowledgment the
recipient of the hat said he would en
deavor to wear it as gracefully as he
could and see that the thoughts that
coursed beneath it were worthy of the
Presbyterian Ministerial Association.
The other officers elected were: Rev. R.
W. Reynolds, president; Rev. R. Liddell,
vice-president. Executive committee â
Rev. F. R. Farrand (chairman), Rev. H.
W. Sevier, Rev. G. W. Lyons.
"Isaiah as a Statesman" was the subject
of a paper read by Rev. I. S Young of can
Jose before the Bapti&t Ministerial Union
yesterday. "A true statesman," he sad,
"is not a trickster, but one who, with
heart on fire with love for country, in
tensely seeding its best good, discovers
the birth ol each new force and the trend
of existing forces." Mr. Young declared
Isaiau, viewed in this light, to be a true
statesman. A sketch was given of the po
litical conditions with which the prophet
had to cope, and Mr. Young showed in an
interesting way how valiantly Isaiah faced
his difficulties, "though il is no part of
my purpose to attempt to indicate to what
extent he was a mouthpiece only."
Professor T. P. Bailey of 'he State Uni
versity addressed the Congregational
Monday Club yesterday by special invi
tation. His subject was "The Atonement
from the Standpoint of a Philosopher,"
and he took a view of the theme which
the members of the club indorsed as
orthodox.
At the Methodist preachers' meeting
the brethren, led by Bishop Newman,
heM an experience meeting. Encouraging
accounts of the week of prayer were re
ceived from most of the churches.
Rev. Edwards Davi3 of the Central I
Christian Church, Oakland, described to j
the Christian pastors "The Influence of a !
Reserve Personality." According to him,
"No man is allowed by the natural law of
natural desire to use the dynamite of
speech who is not conscious of the power
of words through action. No man should
attempt to control wiio is uncontrolled by
self. Every man should : aye -striven not
for the knowledge of material things as j
for a divine wisdom of things spiritual"
The following officers of the Christian
Ministers' Society were elected: President,
Professor A. M. Elston, Berkeley; vice
president, Rev. Frank S. Ford, San Fran- I
Cisco; treasurer, Editor W. B. Berry of ;
the Pacific Christian, San Francisco; sec
retary, Edwards Davis.
KEONG MAKES DENIAL.
He Asserts His 1\ illingneas to Aid in
Bringing His Brother's Murderer
to Justice.
The statements made to the police by
some Chinese at 724 Commercial street,
that Chew Lee Keong, the brother of
Chew Ging, murdered on Jackson street
by a member of the Wah Ting San For.g
Highbinder Society, would not aid the
police in detecting the assassin, is bitterly
denied by that person.
Keong solemnly affirms that he is will
ing at any time to confer with the officers
of the law, if by such proceeding he can
assist in untangling the twisted skeins of
avidence. In fact, he is so eager lor this
truth to be im Dressed indelibly upon the
public mind that yesterday he went down
to the office of hij attorney, Alfred L.
Worley, and there repeated it in the
presence of a witness through the medium
of an interpreter.
Mr. Worley has sent a letter to Chief
Crowley denying the truth of the state
ments made to Sergeant Wollweber by
the Chinese at 724 Commercial street,
and emphasizing the alleged fact that
K-ong Is bubbling over with enthusiasm
to play the part of detective. Neither
does he believe that his client has any in
tention of becoming a participant in any
feud, something alleged to be entirely
foreign to hia patient nature.
The Railroad Case.
The Railroad , Commissioners' demurrer , in
the case of the Southern Pacific 'Company
against the Commissioners â¢was " overruled [by
United States Circuit Judge McKeuna yester
day. Judge Hayne appeared for the Railroad
Commission andstatea that whcn't be demurrer
was submitted it was done so that the de
fendants might get I all . the points in M the
premises on record, and that he would submit
the demurrer without argument. 'â - Judge Mc-
Kenna overruled the â < demurrer aad gave ; ten
days in which to 3 answer. -s All of .; these pro
ceedings were mora a matter of form than in
volving any material point or â propositions in
the great railroad suit. ; \

A HUNDRED YEARS.
Will People, Be Stronger and Live
Longer At Tliat lime?
A well- known scientist says that in a
hundred year 9 Jrom now dhease will be
almost unknown, because people will have
learned how to take care of themselves
and medical science will have made such
wonderful advancement. This statement
may be true, but it i 3 also true that if peo
pe were only to take advantage of the
great discoveries of science even at the
present time they mi^ht po through life
without ever having a day's illness. Many
people have realized this fact and many
have discovered a way to keep strong and
well the whole year round. Here is an
opinion on tlie subject which showa how
they manage to do it:
Mrs. E!ia Feddermann, 291 W. Fayette
street, Baltimore. Md., says: "Sometime
ago I suffered irom terrible sinking spells
and headaches, as the result of a run down
system and extreme nervousness. I ob
tained no reli'i until a friend persuaded
me to try Duffy's pure malt whiskey.
After using it a short time I became fully
restored to health."
Science has pioved that for building up
a run down system nothing compares with
a reliable stimulant â preferably pure whis
key. vEvery person who has ever lried
DuffvTi pure malt whiskey huds tnat it is
uneaualed for promoting health. There
is nothing like it for making sickly people
strong and vigorous. Thousands have tes
tified to the wonderful benefit derived
from taking it. I

The Mayor's office is now occupied by
James D. Plielan, the tirst naive son to
hold the office of chief executive of San
Francisco. Mayor tsuiro left the office
yesterday afiernoon for the last time in
his official capacity.
The ceremony ot introducing the new
Mayor and Board of Supervisors yesterday
afternoon was pretty much according to
custom. The as?embly chamber and City
Hail corridors were crowend. The two
Mayors, so to s-peak, met il! the executive
office, and proceeded together to the com
niittee-room of the Board of Supervisors,
where the old and new members bad as
sembled. Mayor Phelan and ex-Mayor
Sutro walked arm iv arm into the assem
â  bly chamber, and each new and old Su
pervisor followed arm in arm in line. The
Mayox ana ex-Mayor occupied seats on
the platiorm. and each new Supervisor re
mained standing while the retiring mem
bers occupied the seats pending the trans
action of the usuai preliminary business.
Then as their names were called the new
members presented their credentials and
took their seats, the old members during
the remainder of the ceremony occupying
chairs behind them.
Supervisor King" of the First Ward was
super--eaed by Supervisor Devany, Super-
Tiaor iiculJy of the Second Ward by Super
visor Ha.-kin-, Benjamin of the Third by
Delaney, Hirsch 01 the Fourth by Shee
han, Dimood by Dodge in the Fifth,
Hughes by Lackmanu in the Sixth, Dud
ker by Rottanzi in the Seventh, Taylor by
Morton in the Eiphtb, Morgenstern by
Britt in the Ninth, Spreckels by Smith in
the Tenth, Hobbs by Clinton in ihe
Eleventh, Wagner by Rivera in the
Twelfth.
Ex-Mayor Sutro then made his retiring
address and introduced Mayor P&elan.
'c said:
â  Gentlemen of the Bonrd of Supervisors: Our
term of office has expired. The ouly thing we
bave to do now is to turn over our part of the
City government to our successors.
" A great city like San Fra-nclsco has many re
quirements. They grow from year to year,
and new legislation ii needed to maintain ana
control the City's natural progress. The orig
inal consolidation act has been supplemented
by innumerable legislative and municipal en
actment*â& veritable' wilderness of lawâ
which, in their construction and application,
cause great Contusion and loss.
It iiu.s, therefore, becomb an absolute neces
sity to adopt a new fundamental' iaw or char
ter. This should bÂ« clear, concise and com
prenensive, bused upon the be-t experience of
other cit.es in the United Stales ana in
Europe. During the two years oi our adminis
tration hardly a day has paaaed that we have
not been vividly and lorcibly reminded of the
cumbersomeness and other imperiections Of
our present laws. â  The action ol tne Legisla
ture has conferred on the Governor of the
State many of the powers iim rightly and
properly be.ongto the Mayor ol San Francisco,
and the decisions of the bupreme Court have,
in many cases, reduced late chief executive of
tne City to the position ol a mere clerk.
The curse of our largo cities are the wealthy
corporations, which own nearly all the public
utilities and by the unscrupulous use ol
wealth have succeeded in raiiruig control oi
tbe political management cf municipal effalrg.
If tne City o.w:ed its waier. gas, electrical
and othe: public works as'weil as us street car
lines, the saving per annum would amount to
millions and mtgnt, in time, make it possible
to dispense with ail direct taxation, busues
removing the greatest source and occasion ol
corruption. .
These corporations have been a drawback to
our growtn and prosperity. San Francisco, by
its geographical position. itR magnificent har
bor and climatic advantages, should cemmaud
rhe traffic of the whole Pacific Ocean. The
high port ciiarpes and other obstacles raised
.through the influence of corporations have
almost driven aivay our maritime commerce,
and year Â»ftf-r year the Nicaragua canal bill
has been defeated by ihe secret machinations
of the railroad powers.
Hereafter let the citizens of San Francisco
sojidly unitÂ© to raise our beloved City to tlie
rank to which it Is entitled, and permit me to
express the hope and belief that the incoming
administration, in its efforts for good, honest,
impartial and economical government, may
excel all that have gone before 1 1. yaggWjPHfog
As far as I, Individually, am concerned, dur-
V
ing the two year 3 of office Just terminated
have striven to serve ihe people honestly and
impartially, and if in this board we have had
differences of opinion on public questions our
l>er>onal relations have generally beeu ot a
pleasant character, and you have my best
wishes for your future prosperity.
Mayor Phelan then responded, reading
his inaugural . address with a crisp, busi
ness-like manner and tone of voice. He
tskes a firm stan'l for retrenchment, econ
omy and public improvement. Hes3id:
To the Honorable tbe Board of Supervisors:
J'urs'j, nt to.custom, I will take this oppor
tunity of addressing you, the newly eieeted
Board of Supervisors, who will have iv your
keeping the welrare : tiiis^Oity and County
tor next nro yearsr You by.ye been rrilied
to a high' and res; on-ibln Irust and. invested
with lurge powers ut a time when ihe citizens
of >an Cisco have to an unprecedented de
gree ken an interest in public matters. The
rise of improvement clubs, the discussion of a
! new charier and ttie imposition ol an exces
-1 sive tax have brought the forces of good gov
i ernment to the frout to make battle for a
i better, more progressive and more widely
economical administration of municipal at-'
fairs. The people huve expressed confidence
In yorf willingness and ability to undertake
this task, and they place their reliance in
your integrity and honor. You have been'
pledged by your several political parties speci
fically and generally to a business-like admin
istration of tho City's affairs.
He expressed regret that the City has
not a more satisfactory charter than the
consolidation act, and said no municipal
progress on broad and enduring lines is
possible tili a new charter based on the
experience of other American cities is
adopted. He said it would be bis first
duty to consider economy without parsi
mony. The people desire/improvement*,
but they want tbe public revenues pru
dently expended. His;h taxation in the
.past bas been due to waste and extrava
gance and to tbe shifting of the tax bur
dens, especially as to franchises and per
sonal property, which, be told the new
board, it is in their power to remedy. The
board, sitting as a board of equalization,
should cooperate with tbe As.-es^or. He
said he would point out one or two of sev
eral extravagantly conducted City depart
ments to illustrate the spirit of extrava
gance which has crown un in the munici
pality which could be remedied by the
board or by tne Legislature, and he rec
ommended the appointment of a legisla
tive committee to watch and prevent
legislation inimical to the City.
In 1893-94 the County Clerk's office ex
| pended lor salaries the sum ol $76,201. In
1894-95 -hat sum had crown to $95,686, and
in 1895-96 to about $134,000. There must be
a leglsliitive check put upon the wiistelui ex
travagance of this office, because tiie County
Clerk himself refuses to voluntarily conduct
liis office within reasonable limits of expendi
ture.
The cost of the clerical force in the office of
the Justices of the Peace has increased <ver
lHgt year '25 per cent. In the license office
there has been likewise an increase of about
; 20 per cent, while the Police courts have be
' come a large source of expense, whereas
lormerly they were a source oi revenue to the
< ity. Trie Supervisors should recommend the
Legislature to abolish one of the courts, as
; three courts are amply sufficient lor the ncces
â¢ sitiesof this City.
I The sum of $ 24,720 has b -en set aside for
: j.mitor service iv. the new City Hall, which is
; ciearlv excessive. But not only the amount
i expended, but the character of the work dove
has bsen the cause of public indignation.
He called attention to the abuse of the
nrgen: necessity fund. The sum of $29,
--730 15 had beer, expended for tninga
: wliicb were in no sense an urgent neces
sity. About $1,000,000 bad been expended
for supplies throughout the City depart
ments, when he knew from competent
author ty that '25 per cent more than the
retail price was paid for them. He recom
mended the aboiiliou of the fish and game
warden as an unnecessary office.
The contract for lighting public build
| ings and streets by gas baa been let for
| nearly two years ahead. He had been in-
I farmed by competent authority that 12
: cents per lamp is exce-sive and recom
] mended investigation. He made the s-arue
criticism and recommendation in regard
to public electric lighting, the price being
j more than is charged private individuals
! in the same circumstances. The advance
i of gas and electric stocks was due to the
i increased ejirnine capacity of the com
pat:y. In New York, win-re tbe gas and
electric companies have combined, as they
have here, the Board of Aldermen had
taken steps toward the acquisition ol a
gas ana electric plant, fearing the power
of the combination.
The majority of this board are pledged to a
material reduction oi the cost of gas, electric
lignt and telephone service, wh.ch can be
â¢lone without any injustice to the uompbnies.
We are paying nearly doubly ihe price of elec
tric and Kas illumination in this City that is
paH lv Eastern cities, Bnd while the condi
tions are different the difference is not by any
means as considerable as that. As an example
of municipal progress 1 would call your atten
tion to the fact that thecitv of Glasgow niter
January 1 will levy no municipal taxes, the
revenue from the wnter deDartment, street
cars and gas being sufficient for all municipal
expenses.
In regard to the fixing of water rates by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
the board next ruontti Mayor Phelan said
it had been suggested in public discussions
that 5 per cent interest is enough to allow
the company on its bonds and capital
stock in addition to it? operating expenses,
and that Â£ per cent is jfair and reasonable,
especially in view of the belief that the
company is overcapitalized and that
much of its property is held for specula
tion instead of use in supplying water or
to exclude competition. He recommended
that the board at once take steps to in
quire into the real value of the Spring
Valley Water Company's property and
fix the rates accordingly, as the water
rates in San Francisco, compared with
those of other cities, are unmercifully
high. He continued:
The suburbs of the City should have the fos
tering care of the municipal authorities, for
the benefit of any part of the City is the bene
fit of all. By making the suburban and resi
dential districts attractive we can recover our
lest population from the bay counties and
oilier parts of the State, which was driven
away by bad and unclean streets, neglected
park's anu unsanitary conditions. By attract
ing population to the suburbs, the assessed
wealth of the City, which comes from the
presence of population, will materially in
crease and compensate us for any unusual out
lay.
In regard to the closing of cemeteries he
said it is unfortunate toat as the law now
statids there is no restrictions on burials
in the City limits, although the City doubt
less has power to forbid burials as a
measure lor tne preservation of the public
healti;. Also large cemeteries retard the
growth ar.d development of the City. He
recommended the passage of an ordinance
fixing a term 1 after whicn burialg in the
City limits shall cease.
He suoported practical trades and tech
nical education in the public schools, and
said :
There has been extravagance in the School
Department, as was receutly evidenced by the
Grand Jury report, which concluded thus, and
to which lea hour attention: -'In 1883-84
there were 31,578 pupils. average attendance,
wilh 714 teache.-R, witb salaries ot $057,824;
in 1895-Oti, wish 32,436 average attendance
there wore 928 teachers, with salaries of $872,.
311â that is, an increase of 858 pupus had
been attended by an increase of 214 teachers
and an increased expense of $214,487 for
teachers' salaries.
He commended tbe Merchants' Associa
tion for its work in assisting City officials
in the direction of the use of public mo.i
eys for the improvement and cleaning of
streets. Tbe new plan of repaying streets,
the City to pay half the expense and tbe
property-owners the other, sboula be en
couraged.
There has been a general demand for the re
pavement oi Market street ami you will have
to give this subject your careful consideration.
The pavement should be at once durable,
smooth and possibly no aelcss. As a mere
suggestion I call your attention to the fact
that many Eastern cities have laid wooden
pavements of yellow pine blocks, treated with
creosote oil, upon a concrete foundation. This
pavement offer* an apparent advantage over
asphalt or bitumen, inasmuch as it has been
demonstrated to be durable, smooth and noise
| less and, at the same time.it prevents the slip
ping of horses and reduces the wear and tear
oi vehicles. European cities have recently
i Riven preference to such wooden pavements.
; I would in this connection call your aticntiou
I to section 11 <>f general orders of the Super
! visors. Xo. 1587, regulntinr the width of the
tires of wheels, for it is useless to put down
fine pavement unless every means is employed
to preserve it.
There is estimated to be 16,000 bicycles in
use in this City, ami the introduction of this
means of conveyance has made it even more
incumbent upon the Supervisors to provida
1 the streets with smooth surfaces between the
I homes of the people and their workshops,
I and between the parks and residential sec
tions and the center oi the City. Certain
streets shouid be maintained as boulevards
lor the safety and pleasure of the people. In
order to enhance the beauty of the streets
tree planting In the suburbs should be gen
erally encouraged on the sidewalks.
He recommended that the telegraph
and telephone companies be required to
remove the poles from downtown side
walks, put the wires in subways, as has
been done in ruo-t Eastern cities, and
that iron bins sunk in the edge of side
walks take the place of the present un
sightly bins for street sweepings.
He recommended, in the matte of
granting street railway franchises, that
new measures should be enacted by the
Legislature, and also recommended tiie
underground trolley system, tbe economy
and perfection of wnich has been demon
strated in New York.
He took a strong stand against adulte
rated and diseased food and milk. Tbe
public health is a matter of first considera
tion in cities.
He recommended that while the one
company bond system for City officials
has much to recommend it, the law
be amended so as to require two companies
to quali/y.
The completion of the new City Hall is
promised this year by the hoard ot Commis
sioners, and it is a matter of congratulation
that the now Board of Supervisors will at
length occupy v c. mpleted building. Tho
money sawl in tn's direction will, among
othÂ»r things, enable the Supervisors to keep
down the tax levy, which has grown progres
sively in the last ten years until the total rate
per 100 tor <'ity, County ami Stute purposes
reached $2 25, yielding the enormous sum of
16.872. 1 his year the amount which will
bp mis d ny tfi.xaticn for the same purposes of
$5,901,000. Last year the assessed valuation
of tiie City's property, upon which the rate is
$2 25 wns letted, was $327,805,147.
This year, in addition to an increase of
â¢ bout $30,000,000 made by the Assessor, the
State Board of Equalization added 20 per
cent, increasing the total assessment to $422,
--069.000, a gross injustice to the city at large,
and which, if permitted again, should bo
stubbornly resisted by the Board of Super
visors. Tiie tax levy upon this busls will pro
duce this year ior City and County purposes
$4,090,000, and for State purposes $1,810,000,
or an exact total oi $5,901,000. In addition
to tho revenue derived to ihe City from direct
lax ut on, amounting, as above, to $4,090,000,
the City is in receipt of revenue irom other
sources amounting to $1,630,513 and from
railroad taxation of $1974, making a grand
total of the revenues of the City for the fiscal
year of 1896-97 of $5,722,186.
'ihe Ciiy property, including the parks, lots
and improvements, is estimated to be worth
$25,000,000, and the net indebtedness of the
City, represented r>y b^nds, amounted on June
30. 'l 89(5. to but $186,000.
The majority oi this board is pledged during
its term of office to levy no tax in excess ol $1
on thi $100, on a basis of $310,000,000 of as
sessed property, exclusive of tne needs of the
park and the smaller parks and souares. As
tht- amount allowed for the park this year is
$250,000 find lor the sina.ier parks and
tquarts $30,000, the total revenue which can
be raised t>y tnx-uion will r.nrter this pledge
amount to $3,3b0,000, as aaainst $4,090,000
raised this ytur, which forces upon you the
necessity of retrenchment in the various de
partments, which I am sure cm be done with
out impairing the efficienc" of the public
service, as we have alr.ady seen.
In conclusion, gentiemen, 1 desire to assure
you that 1 wili be always ready to co-operate
with you in any work designed to benefit the
City. But I iiia convinced that high taxes not
only repel population, but discourage ail pro
ductive enterprises, and no city Can prosDer
that is laboring under great and unnecessary
burdens. The watchword of our administra
tion must then be, and the sentiment involves
no inconsistency, enlightened economy and
municipal progress. San lrancisco, by reason
of its location, is one of the great cities oi the
world, and it should also, with its natural ad
vantages, be one of the most attractive and
prosperous cities. I tru^t that you will dedi
cate your labors to realization of these ends.

Yesterday.

Minor Changes-
Yesterday was cleaning-honse day at
the City Hall and the ins and outs
changed places with many smiles anil
congratulations. The ball started in the
Board of Education, where almosi a clean
sweep was made.
The old board met just before noon, and
after listening to a report from the finance
committee, which attributed its troubles
to the Board of Supervisors in cutting
down the appropriation, and an address
from the acting president, Dr. Clinton,
waited out and gave the new directors
their seats.
Before retiring Dr. Clinton made the
following address:
This is not a time for a long speech, but I
wish to say a word before we sever our con
nection with the deportment. I think that
our administration has been a good one, and
that the good we have done will far outbal
ance the wrone. When we took charge of the
department we found a feeling of unrest
among the pupils and teachers, but in a short
time the teachers learned that we were their
friends. They learned that we were not eager
to snatch their positions from them. We he^d
no star chamber proceedings to work them
evil, and when they felt secure the work of
the department progressed harmoniously and
for the benefit of the pupils. I also wish to
say. thank God this board never developed a
boss. It was not knowu as a Jones board or a
Smith roard. It will be known as the decent
board of 1895 end 1896.
The new board at once got to work by
electing C. L, Barrington president. The
new presiding officer made a brief address
in which he said that unless all *igns fail
the incoming board would be the best that
the people of California iiad ever elected.
He hoped that when its epitaph had been
written it would be said that it had shown
as much zeal and interest in the welfare
of the public as any board that had pre
ceded it. He continued:
To be selected presiding officer of such a
i<oard of Education as 1 believe we will have
during tlie ensuing two years is indeed an
honor which any one might covet.
I have met you all singly and collectively
on numerous occasions since the verdict of the
peopie was rendered on November 3, and un
less all signs fall, we are to have a board which
will .justify the confidence expressed by the
people at that time.
It has frequently been said that the board
which has just concluded its labors has been
nn improvement on many of its predecessors.
When the epitaph of this board shall have
been written may it be said that it has sur
passed all others in zeal for the welfare of its
wards, prudence and judgment in the super
vision of the property interests intrusted to
it and in general faithful and meritorious ser
vice.
Gentlemen, I thank you and hereby promise
that my best efforts shall be directed toward
those ideals which we should all strive for and
I earnestly hope all may obtain.
He then announced the appointment of
the following committees:
Financeâ Waller, Burns and Armer.
Classificationâ D.-rhum, Carew, Burns and
Halstead.
Rulesâ ]>rucker, Armer and Waller.
Qualification â Armer, Bantel and Ham
mond.
Buildings and Groundsâ Burns, Drucker and
Gallagher.
Salariesâ Head, Derhamand Bantel.
Suppliesâ Bantel, Carew and Head.
Judiclnryâ Halstead, Hammond and Head.
Printingâ Galagher, Burns and Drucker.
Visitingâ C.irew, Halstead and Hammond.
Superintendent of Schools Babcock
stated that changes in the staff of the
office had been decided on, and tnat Sec
retary Bennston would be succeeded by
Charles Welch.
The attention of the boanl was called to
the fact that Mr. Beanston had been a
trusty and efficient employe of the depart
ment for many years, and that lie should
be retained, but the appointment of his
successor was confirmed by a vote of eight
to three. Director Halste id being absent.
Director Waller then offered the follow
ing resolutions:
Resolved, That the positions of the three
assistant secretaries of the Board of Education,
the position of heÃd storekeeper, the position
of head Inspector of Buildings, be and the
same are hereby declared vacant-
Keso'ved, That John O'Donnell, K. P. Hoe and
Joiiu Casbin be appointeJ assistant secretaries
of the Board ot Education, ana that George W.
Ryan be appointed head storekeeper, that
John J. O'Brien be appointed Inspector of
Buil<lingt> and that Alex Vogelsang be ap
pointed attorney of the Board of Education.
An effort was n>ade to have Mr. Asheim
retained as an assistant secretary in place
of Mr. Hoe, but the motion was lost by a
vote of 8 to 3, and the resolution was car
ried by the same vote.
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose and
A. J. Donovan, who has been reappointed
Chief Demity, spent yesterday afternoon
looking over the lists of the applicants
for oflice which have been presented.
The following names were decided on to
supersede an equal number removed:

Monahan, Fred Butz.
In the Justices' clerk's office Clerk Wil
liams made one change, J. M. Cabe being
substituted for T. Carroll, a brother oi
Justice of the Peace Carroll.
Mayor Phelan, after presiding over the
meeting of the Board of Supervisors, took
possession of his office and made the fol
lowing changes: William P. Sullivan,
clerk; Ernest McCullough, consulting en
gineer; John E. Richards Jr., stenogra
pher; W. J. Lofton, messenger.

therms, or dottea lines, equal temperature. The '
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
i.s usually accompanied by fair weather: "iow"
rÂ»fers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather rain*.
"Lows" usi.ally first ap|H-ar on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior '
end low alone the coas:, and the Isobars extend |
north and south along in* coast, rain Is probable:
but when ihe "low- v inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in thÂ» vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of theseconditionl
will produce an opposite result.

IN HIS WRATH
His Answer to the State
. ments of His Legal
Opponents.
Scorching Words About Those
Who Wish to Break the
Pardee Will.
He Supposed the Dead Would Be
Respected and the Living
Let Alone.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
903 13 road way, Jan. 4. i
Dr. Pardee has risen to answer the
nume-rous stories which, ever since his
father's* death, have been repeaieJ about
his fattier, his fortune and himself. His
answer, written by himself, is as follows:
' Ever since mv father's death there has been
fo much said, both in the newspapers and out
of them, concerning his and my affairs, and so
many statements made by those interested in
breaking my father's last will, that, in spite of
my reluctance to air the family disputes in
the papers, I am at las-t driven to that expedi
ent. My father has been accused oi almost
everything: his reputation has,b?en assailed
and "his sanity attacked. I, too, have been
maligned and abused, and accused of things
that exist only in the minds of those who
abused my father living and have endeavored
to besmirch him dead. I have kept gi;ent
under these attacks on my father and myself,
hoping that they would cease and thai the
dead, ai leust, would be respected and the liv
ing let alone. Such, however, I am ashamed
and sorry to say, has not been the case.
The attacks have grown in virulence and
mendacity until at last in pure desperation I
have been forced to make public my side (or
at least a portion of it) 01 the unfortunate state
of affairs. Ido this with extreme reluctance,
and only then that the people of Oakland may
no louger think that my father wna tne kind
ot'i man that his detainers are trying to make
him out, and that they may no longer think
â¢ that my continued silence is a slgu of weak
ness or that I admit, even by silence, that he
was anything but a good man. As for myself
I aesire ;o say that f shall, at the proper time,
(â¢how that nil of the stories circulated so in
dustriously against me are absolutely and
unqualifiedly untrue, and tbat the persons
making them are unworthy oi belief.
In has been industriously circulated by
word of mouth Â»nd in interviews in the public
prints that my father made an unfair divi
bion of his property and bequeated the larger
portion to me, leaving his daughter, my half-
Mster, and his widow, my stepmother, but ill
irovided for. It has been stated both by word
of rconth and in newspaper interviews that
the value of my father's estate was from $350,
--000 10 $-400,000. Neither of these statements
is triv.
My father's estate at this time is, at a fair
and liberal estimate, not worth more than
$280,000. This estate he divided into two
unequal portions. To me he gave the lesser
jortion and to his widow and my sister, be
tween them, he gave the larger portion. To
me he cave property valu d tit not more than
. $127,000 and to his daughter and his widow he
gave sl43,ooo. It was fair to suppose that his
i:augh;er would survive his widow and be
come htr heirâ so that he practically divided
his property into two unequal poriions, giving
the larger "portion to his daughter ana the
smaller pnrtioa to his son. All this property
was acquired by my father before his mar
riage witn nis widow, and no portion of it whs,
ns i:iv lather declared in his will, community
property. The property he gave to his widow
is, at a low estimate, worth $70,000, there
fore, ore-quarter of the whole estate, and
brJlisrs In a. i ncome ot $215 per month. The
total income of the property jriven to sister
*ancHiCfmiJthen^*OTcr-^'4sO per month. i -
It is mie that my latner provide! that the
propt-rty bequeathed to my sister should in
the event ot then entirely improbab c contin
gencies go to me. Those contingencies have,
â unfortunately, arisen, and the property be
queathed to my sister goes, under the provi
s.ons of the will, to me. What is there unnat
ural in this ? Is it not perfectly nnural that a
man should wish thnt his property should go
to his direct descendants and not to the family
of his second wife, neither of whom, the wite
or the family, had helped him accumulate any
portion oi it ? And is not that wile (and eveu
her family) well provided for when she is lelt
i>roperty of the vÂ»lue oi $70,000, a home rent
free and an income of over $'200 a month,
<venin these times, when renis are low and
property has depreciated ?
As I have said before, I mnke public a por
tion of niy defense of the pood name of my
father with a great des.l of reluctance, and
only a:tt-r I had waited patiently and In
silence many weeks for the attacks uion him
to cease. As .for the false accusations that
have been made iigainst me and my good name
I have at this time only to say tnat they are
absolutely and unqua.lliedly untrue, and that
when the proper time comes (as it will when
the contest comes in court) I shall show that
those who have believed these tales without
waiting to hear the other side have done me
an injustice and themselves no honor. >

Sherman Fogarty Falls in the
Bay and 1 ticks in the
Mud.
A Little Bl c!< Spot on the Water
Prov.d His Salva
tion-
Oakland Office San Fraxcipco Call,/
'â )U6 Broauway, Jan. 4. f
Sherman S. Fogarty can thank the top
of his head that he did not pass the night
in the Morgue. He will remember his
narrow escape from drowning this after
noon for many days to come.
Mr. Fogarty is an enthusiastic aquatic
sportsman and all h s bpare hours are
epentin boating on the estuary. He has
had many narrow escapes on account of
his fearlessness, but this afternoon nearly
closed his career. He was literally saved
by the too of his head. He was attempt
ing to steo from the Alice-street bridge
into his boat, which ua-j moored Blackly
from either end. Mr. Fogarty pulled the
mooring line that was nearest him, in
tending to junio into the boat as soon ass
it could be beneatli his feet. He did not
allow, However, for vhe spring of the
maniia line, and when he jumped the boat
was net there. Mr. Fogarty went into
the %\ater, which at that particular spot is
just about as deep as he is tall. His feet
>vere imbedded in the soft mud from
which ne could not readily free them and
just about one inch of his head was visible
ahove the surface.
No one saw him fall into the bay, but
some people who were rlshine heard the
splash and at once ran to see the cause.
They could see nothing but a little dark
spot on the water, and as it moved they
changed their first idea that it was a little
â *al and concluded that it was the head
of a human being. Their conclusion
proved correct, and no time was lost in
rescuing Mr. Fogarty from what came
very near proving a watery grave. He
was fished out, the mud was scraped off
him, ana he was forced to invent many
excuses for his peculiar appearance as he
walked to his home.

EVERY HEAD TO FULL
Supervisors Take Office and Do
Business on the "Whirl

Roeth Wanted to S c All His Friends
Drawing Official Salaries Next
Week.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 4. j
A lively session marked the inaugura
tion of the new Board of Supervisors this
morninc. Although each member ac
complished much, the honors of making
the pace were definitely carried off by
Supervisor Roeth. Not content with or
ganizing the new board, passing rules for
its government and transacting much im
portant business, Mr. Roeth also intro
duced a blanket resolution covering every
office in the gift of the board and declar
ing them vacant. This final ambition of
his, however, was temporarily laid over.
No time was lost by the outgoing mem-
Ders in handing over their seats to their
successor-. Joseph Johnson pave way to
Charles Roeti), W. S. Pelouze to John H.
Mitchell and Hi:am Bailey to Thomas
Well?. Mitchell at once nominated Tal
cott for chairman, and the appointment
was made unanimous.
Very few words were lost in ceremony
when Supervisor Roeih introduced a set of
rules for the government of the new board,
which was unanimously adopted. After
the adjournment Chairman Talcott an
nounced the following standing commit
tees:
Building Committee â Mitchell, Roeth,
Church.
Financeâ Mitchell, Church, Eoeth.
Roads uud Bridge-â Koeth, Wells, Mitchell.
Hospitalâ Church, Mitchell, Roeth.
Printingâ Roeth, Mitchell, Wells.
Secretary Koeth then introduced his
voluminous resolution. It provided for
the immediate decapitation of courthouse

watchman, uining-roorn steward and
baker, bii.dge-ter.der Webber street, copy
ists, and roadmasiers of Piedmont, Ciure
mont, Bay and PeraJta and Temescal
districts.
Supervisor Church was inclined to show
a little leniency to the incum
bents, and alter s aiing that there was no
need to turn all the poor fellows cut till,
the end of the month at least, the reso
lutions failed to pass. It will, however,
go through in time to make the changes
on the first of February.
The lucky men to rill positions so far
as m;i ie public are the following: Ass-st

Supervisor Chunh brought up the
Webster-street bridge matter. "We have
received orders from tne Secretary of
War," he said, "to build that bridge, so
we must do something at ones. For one,
I do not feel competent to pass on those
plans, so I move that a special committee
be appointed to fully investigate tne
matter."
TaJcott and Church were appointed and
instructed to empoy a competent person
to report on the cost and feasibility of the
new scheme. The committee was re
stricted in expenditures to $100.

Between the State University
and tne Farm.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
903 Broadway, Jan. 4. f
The State Farmers' Institute to open at
Livermore on the 18th inst. will be one of
the most important gatherings of its kind
ever held. Very complete arrangements
have been made by Hon. F. R. Fassett,
and a programme of great importance has
been prepared.
The various subjects will be treated by
men regarded as leaders in their par-
ticnlar locations on this coast. On the
first day E. S. Adams will open the insti
tute with a paper on the relation of the
university to the farmers. Mr. Adams
has long been a student of experimental
agriculture, and believes that the univer
sity should prove of far greater benefit to
the farmers than it does at present.
J. M. Doty will treat of olive culture in
all its branches, from a practical point of
view, and Professor N. E. Jaffa will
h andle ihe matter of cattle-feeding. A. P.
H ayne has b en intrusted with an article

to lead an agricultural life should lay the
foundation of an education needed on the
farm.
On the second day E. C. Hahn, who has
made several years' study of tobacco cul
ture in Alameda County, wiil speak of the
result of his work. Within the past six
months there have been many experi
ments maae with tobacco seed in this part
of the State, and the growing interest in
them is shown by the large number oi let
ters that have been received by the bod
ies making the experiments from land
owners anxious to follow the example. H.
P. Mohr of Pleasanton, the well-known
horseman, will attend to the subject of
horse- breeding and J. A. Filcher, secretary
and manager of the State Board of Trade,
will handle the subject of foriegn markets
for California products.

Cunningham, who recently organized a
crusade against non-resident landlords of
Alameda County, who persistently ne
rlect their property, wili speak of her
favorite subject, "Huive Markets. " State
Highway Commissioner Marsden Manson
will treat of the value of good roads.
A discussion will lollow each address,
and a general question-box will be held at
the end of each session.
The Masonic Hall, where the institute
will be held, will contain a display of
farm, dairy and fruit products, and one of
the most interesting exhibits will be that
of tobacco plaiits made by Mr. Hahn.
TO BEAUTIFY BERKELEY.
D finite Plans Made for the
Planting of Shade
Trees.
Silver-Leaf Map c, American White
Elm, Acacia and Deciduous
Trees Recommended.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 4â The uni
versity town seems destined to have its
"oroad streets and drives lined with beau
tiful shade trees of various orders before
another year has passed into history. The
recently organized floral society, which is
composed of a large number of the most
prominent citizens of Berkeley, as well aa
members of the university faculty, has
taken decided steps toward transforming
the college town practically into a pnrk.
At the monthly meeting of the society
which will be held to-morrow evening at
Stiles Hall, the committee which was
recently appointed by President Wilson
to consult property-owners as to the
planting of shade trees along the streets
will make its report.
The committee consists of Colonel
Charles R. Greenleaf, Principal Warring
Wilkinson, John Hinkle, Professor Wil
liam Carey Jones, J. B. Hume, W. T. Bar
rett and Anson S. Biake. In their report
they will suggest that the local property
owners be solicited at once to set out trees
While the season is ripe, and not wait until
spring for the passage of a law which will
compel them to do sc. for by putting the
matter off until later a whole year's
growth will be lost to the trees.
The committee, after having considered
the climate, the characteristics of the
various trees and their shade-giving quali
ties, has decided to recommend the plain -
ng of the silver-leaf maple, American
white elm, acacia of the evergreen variety,
and deciduous trees.
In their work thU3 far the committee
has met with but little opposition on the
part of the property-owners. Should much
objection arise the Fioral Society will re
sort to the enforcement ot the State law,
which provides that citizens of a town can
be forced to plant trees after the manner
described if an appeal is made from a suffi
cient number for such a move.
At the meeting to-morrow evening
Professor J. G. Lemmon will sneak on
"Some of the Noble Trees of California,"
and Mrs. Lemmon will read a paper on
"Native Plants Worthy of Cultivation."
He Extended the Tims.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 4.â The public

Libjrtine in Fine Fettleâ Therese Won
Easily â Woodchopper Sawed a
Cord of Wood or So.
The result of the last race at Ingleside
yesterday, while it did not quite sweep
the favorite players out of existence, left
them in a badly crippled condition, and
they are still wondering where Rey del
Tierra, which turned up the winner at
odds of 20 to 1, became imbued with his
staying qualities. The very pleasant recital
was over one and a sixteenth miles, with
five starting, and Louis Ezell's aluminum
gelding Kamsin occupying the place of
honor in the betting, with evens chalked
against him. Strong support wan ac
corded Judge Denny at 11 to 5, and there
was a shadow of a few dollars going in on
Addie Buchanan. Opening at 12 to 1 Rey
del Tierra ascended tue scale until he
struck 20, and was then backed down to 8
and 10.
During the early stages of the running
Addie Buchanan and Judge Denny
showed prominently out in front, but as
the bend for home was reached both were
about done. Little Clawson now made
his move with Rey del Tierra, and, draw
ing away clear of the bunch, was not over
taken, and in a hard drive won by a
length. Jones on the favorite, which had
been poorly piloted throughout, got a
great move on in the stretch, and, al
though showing his accustomed game
'ness, was nosed out for the place by Peter
the Second, ridden by Sam Doggett. The
lines behind the bookmakers' stands were
not very lengthy after the race.
Of the other rive events run off the favor
ites had the good fortune to take three,
and the regulars, who were mustered out
in full force, were in clover. The track
was still a trifle deep, which augured
against fast time.
The win of Caspar and the defeat of the
13 to 20 choice, Zamar 11, in the third
event at five and a half furlongs, created
almost as much of a sensation as did the
victory of Rey del Tierra. Honig's
sprinter looked like a "ca3t-iron," and his
overthrow can be attributed to Slaughter's
bungling ride.
Bellicoso, carrying 120 pounds, was
looked upon as the contending horse, and
was held at 2tol in the books. With but
99 Douuds n the saddle, as good as 10 to 1
was laid against Caspar, Contrary to ex
pectations, Jones on the latter colt went
to the front, and heading Bellicoso with
the exception uf at the three-quarters,
stood a drive gamely and finished half a
length before the odds on choice with Na
glee Burk's sprinter lapped on the pair.
After a quarter bad been covered Slaugh
ter found himself pocketed and compelled
to go on the outside of the two leaders.
He then made a wide sweep into tue
stretch, and also furnished a pretty exhi
bition of numskullery.
A very poor assortment started in the
first event, a six-furlong selling run, and
the 2 to 1 lavorite disposed ot them like
splitting cordwood, winning very easily
from Abi P. Pleetwood, an outsider, was
third.
Ed Purser and his lriends strung their
checks all along the line on his mare Ap
plause, forcing her odds from even money
down to 3 to 5. She was cranky at the
post, and. as the barrier flew up, wheeled
and was several lengths behind the bunch
when Jones set after them. Although
making a fine run she had to be contented
with third position. Woodchopper was
always out in front and galloped in six
lengths in advance of brametta, a 15 to 1
outsider. Three to one was laid against
the winner.
Three Forks had the class over the as
semblage in the hurdle race, and star me
a 7 to 10 choice showed the way and
jumped in eight lengths ahead of Candor

kindly than is his wont, was a good third.
Liberal 'cratchin* on the part of owners
reduced ihe number of starters in the fifth

in thf saddle, was in fine fettle, aod going

NOTES.
Two-year-old races will be a feature of
the next meeting at Oakland track.
Gena Leigh yesterday disposed of Pe
trarch and Woodchopper. Mike Killing
getting the pair for $600.
The judges were not pleased with
Slaughter's riding of Zamar 11, and in
quired into the matter somewhat. Owner
Dan Honig said that he told the jockey to
use his own judement in piloting the
sprinter. Slaughter said he had to tak^
his mount up on the back stretch to pre
vent him from jumping on Caspar and
Bellicoso, but is satisfied that had he gone
to the bat sooner he would have won. The
officials cautioned the lad that in future he
must endeavor to make a closer turn into
the stretch when it was possible. There is
a consolation, at least, in knowing how it
all happened.
Henry Grattan was said to have worked
six furlongs in 1:15 flat previous to yester
day's race. He must either be a before
breakfast horse or else Marty Bergen has
lost hi 3 grip. The race was won in 1:18>^.
Louis Ezell nacl a swell bet down ou
Kamsin and should have cashed. Eduie
Jones "scrambled the eggs" very badly
with the white-stockined gelding.
Considerable was expected of Mr. Reel
in the hurdle event, but he made a bad
stumble taking the first obstacle and was
never after in the hunt. Alaynard now
rides for Andy Blakeley.
It seems strange that the judges do not
give Martinus a cnance to ride. The very
best of the local riders over the timber, he
was set down for what the officials thought
a bad ride on Governor Budd, which race
was run December 2 last and won by Cap
tain Rees. Burmah, Moutalvo, J O C,
Hello and two others finished behind
Budd, and ii he ever ran a better race it
is not on record.
Torsino evidently has not recoverei
from her gruelling finish with Argentina
in the stake race last week. About one
race a fortnight suits the mare.
The following stakes will be decided at
the coming meeting at Oakland track:
Monday, January 11â Berkeley handi
cap, $1000, high weight handicap for all ages,
three-quarters of a mile. . â 
Wednesday, January 13 â The NagleÂ« stakes,

MANWARING IS
STILL CHAIRMAN
Re-elected as Head of the
New Republican County
Committee.
J. M. Chretien Believes in New
Blood, but He Is in the
Minority.
"Unite the Party" Is the K^yno'e of
the First Meeting of the
Committee.
The retiring Republican County Com
mittee neld its final meeting and the new
County Committee held its first meeting
at Shieis hall Jast eveningâ the old band
ing over to the new committee $15, with
everything paid for.
Charles Manwaring, chairman of the
old committee, was re-elected chairman
of the new. F. J. Conn was elected sec
retary of the new committee.
J. M. Curetien opposed the re-election
of Manwaring, and nominated William
Cluff for the place. In a short and rather
sharp speech he insisted that new blood
should be injected into the management
or official head of thecomruittee. He ?aid
that Manwaring had led the party to de
feat twice, ana that that record should
warrant his retirement.
"During the last cam- aign the party
was split Into lactions. which ran it to i:s
death," he said. "What we want is new
blood. Had we been united during this
light (it was a Republican year) we would
have won every office from that of the
Mayor to the last School Director. WÂ«
should have won them. Now it seems the
will of the majority, here to go ahead on
the old line*, legardless of this lesson. If
we do so I want to go on record as opposed
to it. If we meet with the same results
the majority should be left to bear the
blame."
There was a call for the question, but
before the chairman could state the result
a demand was made for the rolcall.
Jesse Marks took the occasion to say that
he thought they were going 100 fasti
"It's the same old douge," said Chre
tien. "They want to bar out the minority
altogether."
Marks went on to say, however, that be
was for Manwaring. He thought a de
feated chieftain was entitled to resp ct
a:id esteem, even if he bad lost the battle.
The committee should get behind him
once again and help him pull through.
Cuff at this juncture rose and with
drew his name. He said that he had
allowed the use of it on the condition that
it would bring harmony. There had been
something said about defeat; he did not
think the chairman was responsible for it.
It was the business ot the members of the
conmittee themselves to unite.
The roll was called, and Manwaring
scored 31 against 17 opposed to him
Chairman Manwaring thanked the com
mittee and then especially thanked Mr.
Cluff for what he had said. "We have
been defeated twice," he said, "but it was
not my fault. It was an unfortunate splii
in the parly, which I did my best to heal.
1 may say that I will do everything that
in me lies to bnns the two factions to
gether. If it is possible I think I will do
it."
Secretary Conn thanked the committee,
and then Mr. Chretien moved tbat a com
mittee on rules be appointed at once.
There was a little discussion over this,
and it was laid upon the taole, the prevail
ing opinion being that there was no hurry
about it.
Jesse Marks at this juncture suggested
that there should be a vice-cnairman and
named T. D. Riordan for the n'ace.
Chretien seconded this, saying that ii
Marks had not made the motion he him
self would have done so.
Mr. Kiordan was chosen as vice-chair
man without dissent.
Mr. Eiordan moved that a committee of
fifteen be appointed by the chairman, the
report to be made at the next meeting. F.
E. Wallace moved that the number be
eighteen, and the motion carried, in spite
of a protest from Jesse Murks, who
thought they were fjoiri<? too fast again.
that this committee should be ap
pointed at the chairman's leisure, and
very carefully chosen, as it was of the
first importance in the matter of healing
the difference in Ihe party.
Lincoln Savage introduced the following
resolution*:
Eesolvcd. First, that a committee of three on
reorganization be appointed by the chair for
the purpose 01 consulting with'dis-iffected Re
publicans with a view to the formation o! one
organization, representative of theÃepublican
party in the City mid County of San Francisco.
Resolved, That this com in 1 1 tee report at the
next meeting of the County Committee.
In speaking to tho matter Mr. Savaee
said that there was 25 per cent of the Re
publican party not represented in this
committee at all. "On!y when united
and led by strong candidates can the
party hope to carry this County," he said.
â¢â¢At present Â«c are split wide open. We
are all defeatedâ both sides are defeated.
It is now our business before there is any
fieht on at all, before we jjet into lise
newsDapers, before any faction has been
created, to get together and go into th?
next campaign a strong and united part-."
Chiit en took exception to this. He
said they should have thought o f that be
fore they elected their officers. "It is tine
policy, isn't it, to first elect a chairman
and then to :o tLis 25 per cent of the
party and tell them that you would like
to have them join you?" he said. He then
moved that me whole matter be leit to
thf: chairman.
Savage said he did not look at the mai
ler that way. He did not beiieve that the
chairman represented all the wisdom ol
the rarty. He tnoncht tliii committee
could do the work better than the chair
man could and s-honld be appointed.
Chretien's amendment was carried al
most unanimously and tl.e committee ad
journed to the call of the chair.
The mail-carriers in Northern Maino
have put on their skaies.

MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT AS A
MEANS TO SOCIAL REFORM
The Suggestions of the Rev. Mr. Bliss Meet With
Hearty Approval of Business
Men.
Proper City Control Would Mean j
Work lor the Unem
ployed.
DR. STALL CRITICIZED.
Dohrmann Says Allowing Supervisors
Executive Powers Encourages
EcoJlers.
__^_^__ _^
The Rev. Mr. Bliss' presentation of the ;
problem of municipal reform has met |
with considerable favorable comment by J
prominent laymen who heard his discus- i
sions at St. Luke's Church on Sunday. j
Business men particularly expressed i
themselves as heartily in accord with the j
ideas be advanced.
One larÂ«e merchant yesterday sent a
check for a contribution to the work the
league may undertake along the lines J
suggested by the clerical sociologist.
Next Monday forenoon the Rev. Mr.
Bliss, at the conclusion of his visit here,
will deliver a special address before the
meeting of the clericus, which is the regu- !
lar gathering of all the clergy of the Epis
copal church in this City. It is expected j
that he will suggest plans for municipal !
reforms to be advocated from the pulpit; :
for the intelligent presentation and eluci- !
dation of sociological principles by cul
tured men to persons constituting cbnrch !
congregations with their associations of
dignified thoughtfulness as opposed to
the smaller bands of dissatisfied individ
uals tbat alter having little themselves j
contend for any change that may bring to ;
them what they might never get by de- j
serving and superior effort.
The Rev. Mr. Moreland, speaking of the j
matter discussed by the Rev. Mr. Bliss, |
declared yesterday that he believes that I
municipal reform will be the vital, the
general issue throughout the United
States during the next four years. Those
impressed with a strong belief in socio
logical principles of City government
are, he thinks, quiet and undemonstrative
only because they are hopeiul of the time
when their num tiers may naturally become i
Jaree enough to be effective at. the polls.
The president of the Merchants' Asso- !
ciation, in criticizing the means for
municipal reform recently advocated by j
Dr. Â£tallard of Menlo Park, thinks that
the Board of Supervisors should be de- [
prived of executive powers and the oppor- j
tunity to control positions and handle I
boodle. He would model the manage
ment of the City after the business meth- I
ids of lar^e and successful private con- j
cerns, in which the boards cf dirt-ctors
advise and legislate, while the executive ;
ollicers do the real work of managing the |
business. He thinks that Dr. Stallard's i
views, wnile generally apt and thoughtful, !
ore based partly upon European models |
that are not completely applicable to con
ditions here.
The following is a copy of a letter writ
ten yesterday by F. VV. Dohrmann, presi
dent o! the Merchant;-' Association, to Dr.
Stallard, in reply to his published plans
for municipal government :
January 4. 1897.
Dr. J. H. StaUardâ Dear Sir: 1 have carefully
read your article published in the Overland
Monthly, and thp manuscript for an addi
tional one to foliow, and am greatly obliged to
you for submitting the Utter tome now.
You have evidently made the .subject of mu
nicipal government a life study, ana your criti
cism of existing evils proves that you have
given close attention to present conditions in
Son Francisco.
The conclusion which you evidently arrive
at is that a cnange is absolutely necessary. In
this I fully concur.
The remedy you suggest is that in remodel
ing our fundamental lÂ«.ws the legislative as
well as the executive powers be placed in a
council and that the executive function be
placed in the hands of committees.
Your principal reason for this system seems
to be that it is successful in England and
more democratic than to give legislative pow
ers to a council and executive powers to a
Mayor.
Â£1 am not convinced in the first place that
the reasons for improvements in European
cities are chiefly that a council had charge of
them.
Did not Paris become the leading and model
of ail modern improved cities through the
efforts of Baron Haussmann. aud was not Wash
ington made new through Boss Shepard?
And if it is undemocratic to divide the powers
to leeislate and the duty to administrate, then
the United States and all our State governments
are on a wrong and undemocratic foundation.

An Authority Whom All *
Will Delight to Honor j
Golden Gate Kindergarten Association, Â£
MRS. SARAH B. COOPER, Presm>6NT, Â£
4902 Vallejo Street. i'
San Francisco, Cal., Feb. 3, 1890. Â£
You ask me if I know anything about the Royal 5
Baking Powder, and if I consider it free from all i
adulteration. 4*
lam glad to be able to assure you that I know, %
both from experience and from a chemical analysis,
that the Royal Baking Powder is a pure, whole- %
some and dependable article. Â£
Knowing the pernicious effects of deleterious in- *
gredients used in the preparation of food, especially i
in that indispensable article to every family â bread \
â I have taken great pains to ascertain what I could !Â»
safely use in my own home, and recommend to the i*
many mothers with whom I constantly come in con- <t
tact in our work among the children. I regard the J
Royal Baking. Powder as a boon to the household <*
and a benediction to the race. Â£
Very sincerely yours, Â£
| Have we not now in our present Board of
I Supervisors almost exactly the- very conditions
which you advocate to right the wrongs which
we now suff.'i? But|grantingthnt committees
can and would govern our City better than
our present board or a Mayor with certain
powers, providedâ and you cer.ainlv assume
such a conditionâ that the right men could
be elected and would consent to servo, what
progDect have we that such would be the case
under your plan?
For my part 1 prefer to draw my lessons from
experience at home rather thnn irom Euro
pean cities where conditions are entirely dif
lerent, and here we certainly learn that it has
been almost next to impossible to have ma
jorities in our respective Boards of Supervisors
which had the interest of the City at heart
and were competent properly to take charge
of its ati'iiirs.
On the other hand, we have scarcely ever
j failed to elect Mayors whom we could safely
i trust with the responsibility lor our entire
i City government.
1 tuerefore should advocate to make our
i Board of Supervisors or Council an entirely
i legislative body, without patrom ge ana the
| privilege to disburse money at all.
This would so reduce the possibility of boo
-1 die that in place of being an office of suspicion
j it would become one of trust and honor, and
j we could then hope at least to induce our best
; people to accept these positions.
The executive I would trust to such officers
! as may be required, placing the Mayor at the
i head of them, with sufficient powers to super
vise and to enforce proper discharge of the
duties which each officer under him would be
bound to perform.
That is the way business is always con
j ducted â not, as you seem to assume, by a
board or committees who have mostly legisln
tive and advisory functions. The real work, is
never performed by the board ot directors, but
always by the executive officers, as you will
! find it you will insDect the workings of rail
j road, insurance, manufacturing or commer-
c ial companies, and I am firmly convinced
that only when we follow most closely the sys
i tern of conducting business by private con
i cerns will the business of our municipal or
' ganization be properly managed. Re^pect
i fully yours, F. W. Dorhmans.
THAT EVERGREEN PLAY.
|" The Old Homestead" at the
Baldwin Proves Popular
as of Yore.
The Columbia "Disappoints" for the
First Time â Comedy and Fun
at the Alcaz r.
Denman Thompson's and George W.
Ryer's perennial play, "The Old Home
stead," was greeted at the Baldwin last
night by a large audience, which laughed
at the jokes as heartily and sympathized
with the pathetic scenes as feelingly as if
the people had not known beforehand
exactly what was cominir.
The fact is that "The Old Homestead"
is growing into something of a rural
classic, and although it has long outlived
its novelty it continues to be accepted on
account of its touches of human nature.
These touches are considerably helped on
by the opportunities for the introduction
of specialties and the characteristic staging
which the play allows.
The company at the Baldwin is about
the best all-round troupe which has pre
sented "The Old Homestead" here. John
BarKer, who plays very much on Denman
Thompson's lines, is an excellent Joshua
"Whitcomb. There is a well-denned touch
of pathos in nis work and he does not ex
aggerate his whimsicalities, though he
contrives to m ke them marked enough
to keep the audience in a ripple of laugh
ter during a large portion of tne time that
he is on the stage.
Frank Knapp plays the role of the
tramp naturally and effectively, Lizzie W.
Hall is a good Aunt Matilda and the roles
of her elderly swains, Cy Prime and Seth
Perkins, are well played by Fred Clarke
and Â£. 11. Stephens. Ihe rest of the cast
is satisfactory.
The specialties are all good; "The Old
Homestead" double quartet is repeatedly
encored. "The Palms" in the scene out
side Grace Church is sung with good
effect and the Salvation Army band is
larger than usual and makes more noise.
As lor tbe scenery it shows the signs of
wear and tear and is of the approved "Old
Homestead" pattern.
Alcazar Theater.
Two entirely diverse btlli of fare were served
up at the Alcazar Theater last night; the cur
tain-raiser, "Dream Faces," is of the serious
or romantic type, and "A Serious Tangle," a
farcical comedy in three acts by Sydney
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1897.
Grundy, abounds from beginning to end with
ridiculous and laughable complications.
In the curtain-raiser Francis lowers played
the role of a dissipated spendthrift, who, after
leaving his daughter to the care of chance
charity from her infancy, suddenly wakes up
to the fact that he loves her when it is too
late for him to be anything but a burden and
a disgrace to the girl.
Francis Powers gave a rendering of the
spendthrift's role that was excellent, both as
regards acting and makeup. Miss May Buck
ley was artless and graceful as the daughter
and Mrs. F. M. Bates played the part of the
aunt carefully and conscientiously.
The complications in "A Serious Tangle" are
so njazy that they have to be seen to be ap
preciated.
They kept the audience in a chronic state of
laughter at the Alcazar last night. If "A Seri
ous Tangle" has a Â«nornl it is that young hus
bands should think twice before going to the
theater without their wives, and if they do
commit that folly tney had better confess to it
immediately, lest worse befall them. Hugo
Toland played the part of the husband who
went to thy th?ater secretly and who got into
a series of ridiculous complications Irom try
ing to hide the fact.
Beatrice Lieb was good as the wife and May
Buckley added largely to the spirit of the per
formance by her guileless impersonation of a
mercenary maid. George Osbourne was excel
lent as Uncle John aim Maud Hines played an
ingenue part prettily.
The Grand Opera-Houne.
"In the Name of the Czar," presented at the
Grand Opera-house last night to a good house,
is aptay that has many striking scenes in it,
some very good tableaux and a plot that is not
difficult to comprehend. There are many im
possible situations in it, still they all go to
make up a sensational play and give the play
ers an opportunity to show their ability in in
terpreting the author's ideas, and several of
the company in this particular acquitted
themselves in a very creditable manner.
Norman Darrell, governing a fortress in
Hussia, is enamored of the wife of a man he
nas caused to be imprisoned, but being un
nble to win her seeks to use his power to get
her sou out of the way if she will not consent
to be his wife, and in the course of this en
deavor the governor is frequently thwarted :
by a young American who was a college mate j
at Yale of the threatened son. The daughter
of the governor is in love with this son, who !
is her cousin, and the two help to frustrate
her lather's plan.
Leslie Morosco, who plays the part of the
American hero, gave evidence of a high de
gree of talent, astonishing his many friends.
Victory Bateman had a good acting part in
the character of the governor's daughter, and
she nctcd it well, wnile there were several
others in the cast who had good roles. Young
Bert Morrison, who recently made his debut,
gave turther proof of his aptitude for the i
stage.
At the Orptietiin.
The grand opera ballet and the aerial ballet
still form the chief attractions at the Or
pbeum, although several good acts have been
added to the vaudeville bill this week. Diver
sity has been given to the grand ODera ballet
by the introduction of a dance by twelve
secund as dressed in Spanish costume, who,
according to the programme, trip the light
fantastic toe In the style popular in Cuba.
Their dresses are very gorgeous, and the dince
they execute is pretty and effective. The Dun
bar sisters nave finished their engagement,
and the bnllet is without premieres except for
a small child who dances gracefully.
Among the new vaudeville acts Charles
Wayne and the two Bostons made decided hits
last night. The lormer is a monologue artist
with eccentric dances who is gifted with a
happy knack ot saying his jokes in a free and
easy style which makes '.hem appear to be
dashed off on the spur of the moment. The
two Bostou>, whose Kpeeoh loudly proclaims
them as coming from the banks of the Thames,
are grotesque comiques, one of whom pretends
to perform feats of strength and cunning,
while the other makes it his business to betray
his partner to the audience. For instance,
the short ff t Boston pielends to lift a mighty
weight with his teeth and the long thin Bos
ton brings in a little white cat, which claws up
the weight with ease and is carried away,
weight and all, by its taii. Tne most amusing
pan ot the Bostons' act Is the Mexican bull
fight, with a dog made up to look like a savage
bun.
Frederick Hallen and Mollie Fuller's act
embraced some fairly amusing dialogue, and
Hallen dancfd gracefully. Miss Fuller's soug
mipht with advautage to their turn be
omitted, as neither the song itself nor Mi<Â§
Fuller's method of executing it had anything
to recommend it.
Miss Anna Caldwell appeared insome catchy
songs.
The clever Phoite's pantomime company are
in the last week of their engagement, and the
rest of the bill embraces tome of the strongest
of last week's acts.
TivoU Opera-HougÂ©.
"Jack and the Beanstalk" is still proving a
big draw at the Tivoll. The cast, which made
such a success in the piece, remains un
changed, and the ballets nnd the transforma
tion scenes are work.ng very smoothly.
The Hur.io-Tamer.
Oscar R. Gleason's horse-taming exhibitions
are proving very popular at the Circus Royal,
corner of Eddy and Mason streets, every even
ing, ladies and children forming qnlte a part
of the audiences. Horse-owners have been
bringing unruly animals from all over the I
State to have them quieted and driven by j
Gleason, and some of the orutes have proven j
tough subjects.
This evening he will have a lot from Oak
land, Including come thoroughbred runaways,
thrte very vicious and wicked kickers and
"Ugly Mary," whose pet title is "queen of the
kickers." Gleason will also quiet and ride a
wild horse. This will be his last week in San
Francisco.
At the Chutes.
A number of extensive improvements are
under way at the Chutes and will not be com
pleted until about the first of February. Until
that time the Haight-street grounds will be
In full running order only on Saturdays and
Sundays. The roller-skating rink, however,
will be open every afternoon and evening,
rain or shine.
For the first time since their opening two
years ago the management of the Columbia
Theater was obliged to disappoint their audi
ence last night, owing to the illness of Joseph
Murphy, who was confined to his rooms at the
Occidental Hotel with a severe attack of the
grip contracted last week during his trip in
the Northwest. The physicians who are at
tending iiim deemed it best not to permit him
to appear la*t night, ami found him so much
improved that they assured him that he
could appear this evenfng.
AN EVENING HIGH SCHOOL.
Opportunity for Young Men and Young
Women to Develop Their Talents.
There are many young men and many
young women in this City who have com
pleted the course of instruction offered in
the grammar schools of this State, and
who are desirous of puisuing high-school
work; but they are prevented from doing
so because they are obliged to work dur
inir the daytime.
In order to supply such persons with
the opportunity of pursuing advanced
work in high-school branches, the Board
of Education of this City has established
two classes at the Business Evening
School, corner of Bush and Stockton
streets. A two years' course of study has
been prepared, and instruction is offered
in history, Latin, algebra, English, geome
try and government. The instruction in
all branches is free.

NATIVE SONG
EAT A BROTHER
Sequoia Parlor Banquets
Off the Symbol of
Its Order.
How a Cinnamon Bear Cub
Furnished a Meal to the
Fraternity.
Presentation of a B?autifuly En
graved Badge to a Retiring
Presiient.
Cannibalism broke out last evening in
Sequoia Parlor No. 160. N. B. G. W., and
the members banqueted off the remains
of a roasted brother. In life the deceased
native son was only a hall-grown cinna
mon bear, but, being a symbol of the order,
that fratricidal feast app?ars startlingly
unfraternal. Possibly, like the eternal,
mystical boar of Valhalla, upon which
the heroes feed, they expect that their
bear will become whole again and live un
devoured, inexhaustible, everlasting. In
Past President Pape's Beautiful
Badge, the Gift of Sequoia
Parlor, N. S. G. "W.
that CBse the braves of Sequoia sat down
to their fraternal, symbolical and indisso
luble roast with no unreceipted butcher
bill as a specter at tbe feast.
Manager R. W. Martland of the Native
Sons' Hall on Mason street, where the ban
quet took place, makes this plea of justifi
cation:
"It was just a case of bear eat parlor or
parlor eat bear. Ever since that brother
was initiated last summer be has been
dying to chew up some of his fellow
members. Even the night we put him
through the lirst degree he clawed off the
marshal's trousers and thai officer had to
20 through the ceremony with the par
lor's banner wrapped around his manly
form. We had that warlike cub chained
head and foot, and even then we had to
call in Henry Martin to sit on him and
hold him down while we buckled a regalia
made out ol wire-netting on him.
"That was a lively initiation. While
the president was administering the obli
gation to the new native son he stood on
top of his desk with a piece of gaspipe in
his hand to fight off the candidate should
he get away with Martin. We didn't try
any more decrees, for that cub was too
active and enthusiastic. We made him a
sort of honorary member and let it go at
that."
The bear was brought down from Sltka
by the Alaska Commercial Company. It
was presented by Mr. Gerstle of the com
pany to Secretary Henry Lunsted of the
Grand Parlor, N. S. G. W., to b<* used In
the ceremonies of the order. When Mr.
Lunsted heard that his pet had maimed
two roustabouts on the steamer during
the passage to this port he tried to get
out an accident policy on his life, but the
insurance agent had heard of the bear and
raised the rate.
Robert W. Martland, the next owner of
the brute, had to chloroform him before
he could get a collar around his neck.
He worried with the bear for several
months, and finally persuaded Sequoia
Parlor to accept him as a gift.
The bear was partially initiated into the
mysteries of the order and couched for
the Admission da\- parade at Stockton.
A committee on bear education, composed
of S. A. White, James Jamison, R. D.
Barton, Charles Terres and James O'Neill,
was picked out to put him throueh the
ritual. He took to the instruction with
more or less enthusiasm and to the in
structors with teeth and toenail. So
active did he become in the pursuit of this
branch of knowledge that the country
parlors heard of him and threatened to
come down to Stockton with their bear
dogs and Winchesters. The grand presi
dent sent a protest to Sequoia parlor, and
the railroad company refused the four
footed native son transportation, except
at explosive rates. This settled the ques
tion, and he wai left at home.
What to do with their brother has been
botherine the parlor for months. Every
day he grew larger and less inclined to
look upon the members of the order with
that fraternal regard so necessary to a
perfect brotherhood. He evinced such a
desire to use his jaws on them at every
opportunity that they conclude! to turn
the tables and eat him. Consequently a
few days ago he calmly expired with a
rifle-ball in bis brain, and lÂ«st night his
fat juicy carcass graced the banquet board
of his brethren. It was the occasion of
the installation of the following new
officers of Sequoia Parlor: S. A. White,
president; C. Â£. Talo, first vice-president;
L. C. Pistolesi, second vice-president;
James O'Neill, third vice-president; R. D.
Barton, record inp secretary; C. E. Torres,
financial secretary; L. M. Barman, treas
urer; John Glavmovich, marshal.
After the officers were installed A. H.
Pape, the past president, was called to the
front and was gracefully presented with a
beautiful nnd costly badge by L. C. Fisto
lesi in a pathetic speech. The badge is in
the form of an eneraved disk .suspended
from a crescent by two chains. To a third
chain hangs a six-cornered srar, in the cen
ter of which is set a large Kohinoor dia
mond. A ranpant golden bear surmounts
!he whole. The words, "President A. H.
Page. 1896," appear on the disk, me en
graved disk, crescent and star are of the
finest tanned bullhide and the ."acef'il
pendant chains are of bright steeJ.ine
Koliinoor was clipDed from the handle of
a beer schooner and the rampant golden
bear is brass.
Mr. Pape was at first overcome with a
flood of tender feeling, but recovered suf
ficiently under the ministrations of the
surgeon to thank the donors, and stated
that when he looked upon the beautiful
gift he would be reminded of the villains
lie had presided over for a whole year.
After the banquet the room was cleared
and Thomas Sharkey, who was the guest
of Sequoia Parlor, took the floor and an
nounced that Spider Kelly and William
Savage of Australia would have a four
round friendly se(-to.
The two men went to work, but it was
soon apparent that Keliy was too lively
for the Australian. He skipped around
the ring and nut his gloves all over his op
ponent's head and body.
â¢'Don't you loul him, Kelly," said
Referee Sharkey, "or I'll give the tight to
the other fellow."
This brought out a perfect storm of
cheers, showing that the Native Sons ap
preciated the joke.
The next bout wis between T omas
Cooney of Boston and Kid O'Brien of Los
Angeles.
"No fouling now," sang out Secretary
Lunstedt, "for Sharkey won't stand it.
He's dead on fouls."
With this warning the boxers went to
work. There was no play about the busi
ness and the blows fell fast and strong.
O'Brien, who was much the i eavier
man, was soon short of wind, and the
Bostonian did clever work on his head.
Two rounds were quickly fought, and
Shnrkeylet the third run fully five min
utes, giving the audience plenty of enter
tainment.
There was not much ctincbintr, but good
honest fighting and lively movements.
Sharkey gave the bout to Cooney, who was
the better man at the end.
LEFT SMALL EVIDENCE.
A Hat aod Coat Labeled W. G.
Stuart Found on the
Ferry.
He Was Employed by Wells, Fargo
& Co, and My H. va Had
Business Difficulties
A brown overcoat and a black derby hat
were found by captain Murphy of the
ferry steamer Bay City, lying on a seat
near the boat's wheelliouse, at 8 o'clock
last evening. The hat had pinned to it a
note containing tlie name of VV. G. Stuart
and the oft-quot:d phrase, "May God
have mercy on my soul."
The find was turned over to the police
on this side of the bay, as they are of the
opinion that another unfortunate has
committed suicide.
The boat on which the suicide took i
passage, if, indeed, a suicide has taken
place, ieft the foot of Market street at 7:30
r. m. It arrived at the Oakland mole on
time.
Captain Murphy left the piiot-bouse
and was on his way to the lower deck |
when he found tbe abandoned apparel and !
the note. He immediately concluded that !
the owner of the property had taken hiÃ
life, and on his return to this City in
formed the police.
Nothing was found in the overcoat by i
which its owner could be identified. The j
pockets contained a bunch of keys, a
pair of lady's kid gloves, a linen handier
chief, a wooden package-holder and an
English thumb dictionary. Across the
front of the dictionary was written the j
name Merrifield.
The Oakland police were informed and
are working in co-operation with tbe San
Francisco department and hope to clear
up the mystery In a short tune.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 4.â The W. G.
Stuart who resides at 460 East Twelfth
street had not returned home at mid
night, and his family were anxiously
waiting lor him. They Knew of no reason
.'or his absence, for he is as punctual as a
clock, and was never known to remain
away from home before.
"I have 'heard of the things found on
the ferry-boat," said Mrs. Stuart to-night,
"but I cannot believe that they belone to
my husband. lamat a total loss to ac
count for his absence from home to-night,
as it is the first time in our mairied life
that such a thing ha 3 occurred.
I think it impossible that he
can have done anything so desperate
as suggested by those things found on the
boat. He wore a black ue.rby hat and a
brown overcoat when he left home this
morning, but to neither of them was bis
name attached. He never carried a band
in his hat with his name on. There has
never been any trouble of any kind and
he was never despondent. He was
a most devoted man to his family
and never spent his evenings away from
home. He has been chief clerk of the au
diting department of Weils, Fargo & Co.
for several years and we have lived here
five years. During all that time he has
come home regularly till to-night. How
ever, I cannot believe he has committed
suicide; it woula be so unlike him to ever
think of such a step.
"This morning he sent me a postal or
der from the city, and with it a letter con
taining many terms of endearment. In it
he expressed a fear that something might
happen before long, and said he was not
able to meet a arnall bill. I have not the
letter Here, but in spite of its contents I
expected him home to-night."
Mrs. Stuart was greatly excited while
telling her story, and although she ex
pressed so much confidence in her hus
band's return it was very plain to see that '
her hopes did not justify her words. She
gave indications during her conversation
of knowing much more than she was will
ing to tell, but she admitted indirectly
that her husband seemed to anticipate
some trouble.
It was learned positively that the letter
referred to contained a direct intimation
that the writer intended to end his life by
jumping off t he 8 o'clock ferry-boat.
Mr. Stuart is 40 years of age, and has a
family of two boys and two girls. He
was married sixteen years ago, and prior
to coming to Oakland he lived in San
Francisco. He carried a life insurance of
$2000.
W. H. Brlttan's Murder Trial Begun.

The bill regarding the regulation of tuber
culosis in cattle, for the purification of the
milk supply, as presented in yesterday's issue,
is not fathered by the Dairymen's Union
which is willing to consider all measures to

THE PRICE OF
LOVE WHS DEATH
Barbara Groom Kills Her
self for Joseph V.
Pidgeon.
A Frightful Death Follows a
Large Dose of Carbolic
Acid.
Her Farewell Letter to the Destroyer
of Her Happiness Was Indeed
Pit. fill.
Barbara Groom, a young country girl
from Coiusa, committed suicide at 402
Geary street, early yesterday, because she
was unable to secure the love of the man
of her choice, and because she was heartily
sick of the low life she was leading.
Whether the awful pangs of carbolic
poisoning or those of unrequited love
were the more poienant can to some ex
tent be judged by several letters left by
the girl.
From all account* she came of poor out
respectable people, who keep a hotel in
Coiusa. Within the past few months she
met an electric worker named J. V.
Pidgeon. who is employed by T. F. Holtz
of 546 Mission street. About Christmas
time Miss Groom left the old people in
the little country town and came to the
City to bask in vie smiles of the man for
whom she died. She tooK a room at 402
Geary street and the people there knew
but little of her life or aspociates.
Her letters, written just before her
death, showed that she had gone the
way of many a poor deluded girl who
Joyed not wisely but too well for her own
purity or peace of mind. In these letters
she writes of freqaeiiting the saloons and
of playing fast and loose with strange
acquaintance*. Reading along the lines
and between the lines shows that for all
of this degradation her whole soul was
wrapped up in the man for whom she
died.
The first intimation that there was any
thine wrong at the lodging-house was the
discovery that the deluded girl was dying
from the effects of carbolic acid. Dr. Dud
ley was called, but he could not do any
thinp. A little later the body was in the
Morgue and the Coroner was in possession
of the letters, pi.iful acknowledgments of
a ruined life and shame too revolting for
description. They were written upon
cheap paper, and in one corner a gaudily
painted rose appeared, emblematic of the
tender passion. A strange condition the
girl's mind must have been in, for only
once did she think o| a hereafter, and that
not darkly, for she wrote:
My own darling, when we meet on the beau
tifui shore we shall join hands and think of
the day we met; of tne iiappy time we had to
gether, as lovers do. But first I i^aa taken
away and then you came.
The principal documentâ her pitiful
letter to Pidgeon â was, in part, as fol
lows:
Fan Francisco, Jan. 4. 1896.
My Own Pet: I snail sc.nl this letter to you
by the messenger-boy. Keep it, pet, for this
is the last one I'll ever write to you. 11l be
mre you get it now. I will toke carbolic acid
and ena my troubles. â¢ â¢ â¢ This world
has beeu a perfect torment to me, no differ
ence how I try to avoid it. You know I Â«m
crazy about you, Hill I don't blame you for
not marrying me. Don't ever marry any one
fteainst your wishes, p**t, lor you never can
love tnem. â¢ â¢ ' Enjoy yourself, pet; that
is my only wish. Keep away from my irieixl
Daisy, for I don't like you to have anything to
do with her. Oniy Epeak to her and treat her
as a friend. * â¢ â¢ I have friends, but
friends are not lovers, and one is worth more
and dearer to me than my life. â¢ * â¢ Pet,
if I had lived and ever caught you talking in
any way lovingly to another girl I would
have killed you Â»nd she, too. â¢ * â¢
Pet, I would have you go with ;me, but I
khow you can't. But now you teli me you
intend to go to Mexico with those machines.
I wish you will have good luck with them
and don't be foolish, my own darling, and
don't give up your job and trip for me; but
say there is only one girl gone to to make
room for another one.
* * * lam just after getting carbolic acid,
it will be a fearful tieuth, 1 know, but that's
nothing, pet. The reason I took this was bi I
c&uxe you never loved me. so I had no desire
to live. So good-by, pet: be a good boy. I
hope when you see me I'll be dead; so this
is nil for you, for this time and ever. Remem
ber me forever and thiuk what ft foolish girl I
was to do this.
We are parted for ever and ever. I wish
you goou luck. I will remember you and die
thinking of my darling Joe. I have written
this letter Sunday, and this evening I have $7
and I'll blow it all in. I got 50 cents' worth of
carbolic acid, bo I guess that will burn the
insidea out oi me.
The little country girl'i letter was signed
"as ever, your own broken-hearted and
true. â 'B. Attached was a note to the
Coroner telling that official that she had
died by I er own hand.
The misguided girl has a brother who
keeps a lodging-house on Stockton street,
but he did not know anything about his
sisier's whereabouts recently, or why sh9
left her home. He is not acquainted with
Pidgeon.
It seems that several charitable people
heard of Miss Groom's life recently, and
made an effort to save her and send her
to the Salvationist Rescue Home, but she
refused all help and clung to the man for
whom she sacrificed her life.
