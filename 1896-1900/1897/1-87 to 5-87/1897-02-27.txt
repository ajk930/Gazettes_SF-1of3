J Ringing Speeches Made by Well-Known
Business and Professional Men â Sub-
Gommittees Appointed to Arrange
for a Demonstration.
:â  â¢ Ringing words in freedom's name that ]
â â  "found a .spontaneous response in en
<husias;ic applause were spoken last even
in^ at the meeting of the commif.ee of
tifty-e ght appointed by Mayor Phelan to
arrange for a mass-meeting to give the j
people of San Francisco an opportunity of j
expressing tneir feelings toward the j
patriots ol Cuba.
.. T-.he very mention of free Cuba seemed
"fo rind a responsive chord in the hearts of \
iho?e present, and staid old business men j
c'ar>ped their hands and tapped their j
canes on the floor and cheered the elo- j
q'vient speakers who demanded that San [
Erancisco get In line with the rest of
America and reach out a helping baud to
. the Gem of the Antilles.
Solid men of the community from al
most, every walk of life responded to the
cail for the meeting. Merchants, bank
â¢ ers, attorney?, physician'--, journalists,
â¢public officials and others sat side by side,
and vied with each oiher in their eager
ness to do something for the cause.
â  Tlie meeting was held in California Hall,
â  an Bush street, near Powell, and was
called together by Faun E. MaÂ»cherini
and Jotiu 11. Jones, the pioneers in t;.e
Gub.an movement in this City.

- 'â¢ Tne platform at the north end of the
ha-11 was tastefully decorated with Ameri
can flags, but the meeting would have
'.been earnest and enthusiastic had It been
â  held in asandlot, and before the gathering
..dispersed there was not a man present
' .but felt that he bad enlisted his time and
_. energies in a noble cause.

10-get down to business and show the Cu
.'l-ba'n sympathizers that the committee was
. alive and ready to take action.
. . General Salomon declined the honor on
â .â ' Vthe ground he was not altogether familiar
.with the movement and that the men
â¢who had originated the Cuban League of
. . San Francisco and called the meeting
.. were present and could fill the office
.. better.
.President Jones of the Cuban League
â  then stated that Mayor Phelan had prom
â¢. ised to be present and that It would be
' more fitting to await his presence, inas
much as tie had appointed the body that
. â  w*s gathered together.
â¢ â¢ "We hart gathered here," he said, "for the
purpose of expressing our sympathy lor Cuba
and tor oatriots in their struggle for freedom
â¢and independence from the cruelty, tyranny
and oppression of Spain; to devise ways and
â¢ 'means whereby San Francisco in particular
ami California in general may materially
assist them in obtaining that for which tney
â¢ â¢' struggle and to map out a plan whereby these
' â "' objects may be the more readily accomplished.

: tnch leagues should be organized in every
County, of the State so that there will be co
stive action between every section of the
i-'tate'and thereby spread the feeling for the
â  cause of Cuba.
: "Resolutions should be drafted protesting
bgainst the indifferent attitude and policy of

States, and requesting Major McKiniey to
; adopt a vigorous policy iv the Cuban affairs,
aiid immediately after his inauguration, or as
â¢â  ' n thereafter as possible, to grant bel.lgerent
': rights to the Cubans and to demand the in-
Siaiit release of all American citizens confined

"Gentlemen: A great duty lies before us, one

struggle is ended and Cuba Libre is a* recotr
â  'niz d republic of the world, there will come a
" sound from that region below the Gulf which
will say: Long live the Cuban League of San
Francisco."
Rob-rt Ferrai suggested that the Mayor
might be late in arriving, and that in or
der to begin the business of the meeting
The San Francisco Call
] it would be best to appoint a chairman
and secietary at once and get to work.
He said that tie knew of no one who
would better till the chair than Charles M.
| Shonridee, the editor and proprietor of
; The Call, the paper which had taken up
the movement from the start and made it
i no-sible to get such a representative gath
j erine together. He nominated Mr. Shor;
--: ridge for chairman, and the election was
â¢ made by acclamation.
Mr. Shortridge thanked the committee
I for the honor and called for nominations
j for secretary.
Mr. Mascherini, the secretary of the
i Cuban sjmpathizers, wa3 nominated, but
| declined on the ground that hi 3 business
would not permit him to attend to the
j business of both the Cuban League and
i the committee.
Mr. Jones, president of the Cuban
! League, was nominated and elected unani
mously.
Chairman Shortridge stated that the
, object was to organize the sympathizers
J with Cuba in this City for the purpose of
- giving them substantial ard moral aid,
that the yoke might be thrown
off and Cuba admitted to the family of
: republics.
Henry E. Highton was called upon for
< suggestions as to the course of the com
mittee. He stated that his lack of
familiarity with the subject would not
permit him to suggest, but that he
I wished to heartily express his sympathy
with the struggling Cubans. Organiza
tion, he said, was necessary to give the
movement an impetus, ana the question
was how far mij:ht the committee go
j toward helping the patriots without com
i ing into a clash with the relations now ex
isting between the Governments of the
j United States and Spain.
Mr. Shortridge sugsested that the com
i mittee begin on the lines suggested by
tne call lor the meeting. He said that the
! selection of the executive committee was
] the first step to be tnken.
Mr. Highton moved that an executive
committee of rive be appointed to confer
with the Mayor and call another meeting
to arrange for a great mass-meeting.
Gavin McNab said that the committee
should be cautious about calling a mass
meetinE until those who were to address
the gathering had bad time to prepare
; themselves so that they could not only
talic to the sympathizers with Cuba, but
convince those wno were not.
A. P. Van Duzer said that there was no
use in waiting to gather information. The
I Call, which had started the movement,
had given all the information necessary.
i What the committee should do was to
move as quickly as possible to affect the
release of American ctizens in Cuban
dungeons.
This idea caught the members of the
committee, and was met with hearty ap
plause. Mr. Van Duzer moved that fif
teen members be appointed to organize
and prepare for a mass-meeting.
General Salomon said that the time to
act wai now. The Cubans were not insur
rectionists, but revolutionists, and had
Dattled Spain, her armies, navy, gold and
influence, and shown that they could
hold their own. They ought to be recog
nized and at once. A fight for liberty
should have the support of every Ameri
can citizen, he said, and San Francisco
should not lag behind.
Robert Ferrai was in favor of immediate
action, and he said that it was not the
time to talk about figures.
"Cuba," he said, "wants liberty, and we
want nor to have it. The Cubans have
fought and bled end died for liberty, and
it is time that the American people arose
in their might and demanded freedom for
the patriots."
Mayor Phelan entered at this time and
state i that he had appointed thp commit
tee at the request of earnest and enthusi
astic sympathizers of Cuba.
"I am thoroughly in accord with the
sentiment that gave birth to this com
j mittee/ he said. ''The end has come to
Spanish tyranny in Cuba. They will be
free, and it was the example of America
that nerved them on to fight. American
sentiment is with the struggle for liberty,
and it cannot be stayed now. The time
has come when liberty's banner is waving
and it will ever wave over free Cuba.
1 Even this remote community should not
! be left out of the procession that will wel
, come free Cuba.
"This Cuban matter is an American
matter. It should have our ready sym
pathy and action. We ought to have a
! big mass-meeting to help the Cubans and
j bring California in line."
I Joseph Leggett said that he hoped time
would be taken to make tbo mass-meeting
a vast success. He had no doubt that
those who arranged the matter would
have eloquent speakers, and men who
were able to lay the matter thoroughly be
fore the people ready to send the move
ment alone with a boom.
"I believe it is of the utmost importance
that we should stir up the sentiment in
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 27, 1897.
favor of Cuba that is dominant in this
country," he said, "though it may be dor
mant.
"The American people have the liberty
of Cuba in their hearts, and while the art
ministration may be siow to move, the
citizens of this country are not, and they
have already shown by their action
throughout the United States that they
are ready to act."
He offered an amendment to the origi
nal motion that the committee to be ap
pointed bo given us own time to arrange
for the mass-meetine. This was carried
unanimously and Mr. Shortridee named
the following committee:
James 1). Phelau, Henry E. Highton, Robert
Ferrai, A. P. Van Duzer, Gavin McN'abb,
General Edwnrd S. Salomon, Joseph Leggett,
Major W. F.ihey, R. P. Clement, George T.
Gaden, H. B. Master>. John F. Lyons, John H.
Jones and Fisher Ames.
On motion of General Solomon, Charles
M. Shortridge was made a member of the
committee and Mayor l'helan an honorary
member of the general committee.
Joseph Lecgett moved that the com
mittee of tifteen be asked to co-operate
with and asÂ£ the co-operation of the
Cuban League of this City. The measure
was carried unanimously.
A. P. Van Duzer was elected secretary
of the committee of liiteen, and General
Salomon moved that a sub-commitee be
appointed to arrange a general plan for
the mass-meeting and report back to the
committee of fifteen. This was carried,
and the chair appointed Messrs. McNab,
Gaden, Salomon, Ferrel, Clement.
The chair was also made a member of
the committee. This sub-committee will
meet on Tuesday evening at the Occiden
tal Hotel and will report to the committee
of fifteen on the following evenins at the
came place. 1 tie meeting then adjourned
to the call of tbe chair.

MOSLEMS DEMAND
CHRISTIANS' BLOOD
Made Bold by the Policy of !
the Powers They Pa
rade Canea.
Ishmael Pasha Circulates False
Stories to Inflame the
Turks.
Greece Refuses to Withdraw the
Army of Invasion From the
Island of Crete.
CANEA, Crkte, Feb. 26â Most of the
foreign warships that were tying in the
harbor here have left and gone to Soda
Bay, where there is a better anchorage
than here. It is likely, however, that
their presence here will asrain be required,
as the situation has become more critical
than ever before, and it would not be sur
prising if a conflict should occur.
In one respect the interposition of the
powers has had a bad effect, in that it has
led the Moslems to believe that Europe is
back of them in the:r combat with the
Christians. As a resnlt there are this aft
ernoon 8000 Moslem fighting men, besides
the Turkish soldiers, all heavily armed,
parading the streets of the city and de
manding the blood of the Christian dogs
who have dared to question the rights of
the Turks to rule them.
The combined forres that have been
landed by the several powers number
only 800 men, and it is believed thai with
out the aid of the warships they would
prove of no avail in preserving order in
the city.
The popular passion has been added to
by Ishmael Pasha, the acting Governor,
who has circulated false stories to the
effect that the Greek troops are mutilat
ing Moslem children. The Governor
knows these stories are untrue, and ap
parently his only object is to create among
the Moslems deeper hatred of the Chris
tians and to further excite the t'esire for
revenge. He is carrying matters with a
high hand, and it is likely that the powers
will have to intervene.
Accompanied by an armed body of
Turks he left Candia to-day and occupied
strategic positions in the vicinity from
which he attacked the Christians, causing
serious losses to them. The commanders
of the warships remaining in the harbor
protested to the Governor asrainst his
breaking the armistice, but the protest
was unheeded. The admirals command
ing the foreign fleets hayÂ« been notified of
Ishmael's action, and there is much specu
lation as to the course tney will pursue.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 26.-Tbe Athens
corre-pondent of the Times telegraph
that Prime Minister Delyannia has in
formed him that Greece's determination to
retain her army in Crete is irrevocable, but
that the troops will abstain from the of
fensive. They will only protect Chris
tians. Greece will not declare war against
Turkey unless the Turks invade Thessaly
or the powers render the position of the
Grenk troops in Crete unbearable.
The correspondent adds that the Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Athens had tele
graphed to the Pope, asking his Holiness
to mediate between Greece and the powers.
ATHENS, Greece. Feb. 26.â The popu
lar indignation against the great powers
shows no sign of waning, and if the people
hold their way they woul 1 fight with
arms in thrir hands against the combined
forces of Europe in defense of their right
to protect the Christians in Crete. It is
not alone among the people that this feel
ing prevails.
Parliamentary and official opinion
strongly favors resistance to the demands
of the powers. The joint note addressed
to the Greek Government has not yet
been delivered and the delay is unex
plained. Only the Ilusjian, Austrian and
German Ministers have been instructed
by their Governments concerning the
note.
It is reported that one of the powers has
withdrawn from the concert. If this is
true it wiil leave matters in statu quo and
will br ak up the concert, the efforts of
which have been directed toward over
awing Greece by threats.
TRAGEDY AT SALT CREEK.
One Man Dead and Another Dying as
the Rtsult of a
Joke.
OGDEN, Utah, Feb. 26.â As the result
of what was apparently a joke, J. W.
Lewis is now lying almost dead and John
Nichols entirely so at Plain City. About
a week ago Nichols playfully took a watch
from Lewis' pocket and laughingly said,
"I guess I'll keep it." When asked to re
turn it he smiled and walked off. He
came to Ogaen and pawned the watch and
when asked by Lewis to return it He only
laughed.
Lewis discovered lhat the watch bad
been pawned and swore out a warrant for
Nichols' arrest for petty larceny. Nicdols
heard of it and this morning, taking a re
volver, he started for Salt Creek, where
Lewis and several others were working.
"I'm eoing to settle that waich busi
ness," he said, and fired, the ballet sink
ing Lewis in trie back. He then returned
to nis home, put a bullet into his forehead
and almost immediately expired.
Lewis is 20 years old and a Southerner.
Nichols was 22 and was born in Plain
City.
HOW THE COHLISS ACT WORKS.
Had Jlloott Bettceen Canadians and,
Amtricana on the llortti r.
NEW YORK, N. V., Fob. 26.â A Snn
special Jrom Toronto says: Canadians
have been complaining about the United
States law regarding alien labor, which
prohibits persons living on the Canadian
border from going into the United States
and returning in the evening. It is said
that the Canadian Government will pass
a retaliatory law touching Amer.cans
coming into Canada.
The Globe, the Liberal organ, has sent
a reporter to investigate the matter, and
some interesting stories are told of the
inconvenience Canadians are suDject to at
Windsor, owing to the Corlhs act. There
is bad blood on the border and the former
friendly feeling has passed away. Cana
dians crossing the river to Detroit to visit
have been turned back, because it was
thought i hey were gome across to work.
It is sail at Windsor thai nearly as
many Americans find employment on the
Canadian side as there are Canadians who
cross the river to work on the American
side. A count of the number crossing
from Detroit durintr the hours of 6 to 8
was 197. or tturty-e:ght more than rrossea
to Detroit during the same time Wednes
day. The Cor.iss act does not interfere
with women crossing, and many of t. c
Canadians crossing are stenoirrapners and
saleswomen of Windsor employed in
Detro>t.
If the Canadian Government passes a
law to retaliate, more American-* would
be affenetf than Canadians. There are
some L'UOO American citizens now in t lie
mining districts of Western Ontario and
British Columoia, and besides there are
several Americans engaged in the Cana
dian lumber camps who would come
under such an act as it is proposed to pass

which will necessarily redound to the ben

ALL UNITED
FOR THE NEW
POSTOFFICE
Business Men, Labor and the
State Legislature De
mand It.
RESOLUTION BY THE SENATE.
Joint Meeting of All the Business Organiza
tions to Be Held March 4 to
Take Action.
Supervising Architect Aiken will probably revise his beliefs in the
matter of the San Francisco Postoftlce. Mr. Aiken is the man who
makes plans and has to do with details mthe constructing of postoffices.
In an interview published in THE CALL on Thursday he said that the
date upon which work would be begun on the San Francisco Federal
building was "very indefinite"; that the engineers had "certain prob
lems to solve" concerning the site before it could be determined what
kind of a building might be erected upon it. This, after the site had
been definitely accepted and Mr. Aiken had himself made his plans,
and they also had been accepted.
San Francisco and the State of California have grown impatient
with this halting and are about to see that a period is put to it. The
Postoffice and Federal building is long since due. The work undertaken
now would come in the form of a special blessing to the congested labor
market. Completed, the building will give a home to the Federal courts
and to the postal authorities in keeping with their necessities and the
dignity of the City.
The agitation of the subject by THE Call seems to have been
all that was necessary to awaken not only the City but the whole
State to an expression of the impatience under which they have been
chafing for years. Indeed the Chamber of Commerce has several
times made a demand for action in the matter, and a letter of inquiry
from the Merchants' Association is even now discovered to be on the
way. These inquiries and protests have hitherto been filed away by
the Secretary of the Treasury, or whomever they may be addressed to,
and the inquirers are expected to accept and be satisfied with Mr.
Aiken's vague explanation about problems that have to be solved by
the engineers.
But this is different. The organizations representing every busi
ness interest in the Ci + y have united in a demand that the work shall
be begun at once. The Labor Council of this City and County last
evening added its protest and claim for consideration. The State
Senate has passed a resolution of emphatic protest against the delay,
coupled with another demand. Our Senators and Representatives are
called upon by these bodies to be diligent in looking after the business,
and, not satisfied with this, Congress will be asked to appropriate a
quarter of a million, to be added to the quarter of a million already
I available, in order that, once begun, the work need not be checked for
lack of funds.
This temper is likely to see an end to the dawdling over problems
that have long ago been determined and of which determination the
authorities at Washington were long ago given the proofs. San Fran
cisco is sick of playing the ignored suppliant while cities of much less
importance have their needs, so far as the Federal Government is con
cerned, supplied for the asking. San Francisco is the metropolis of the
West, and her postal and customs business is immense. Siie requires
suitable quarters in which to transact that business, and she will see to
it that she be given them.
The high fence that surrounds the site at Seventh and Mission
streets has been a blight on that neighborhood quite long enough. The
interest on the cost of the lot would almost pay for the building had the
money been otherwise invested.
A joint meeting has been called of the Manufacturers and Pro
ducers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the State Board of
Trade, the Board of Trade of San Francisco, and the Merchants' Asso
ciation, to be held in the rooms of the Chamber of Commerce on the
4th of March. While the ceremony is going forward at Washington, in
augurating a new President, a new and more energetic administration,
the men who represent San Francisco in the fullest sense will be gath
ered in this City to prepare to place before that administration San
Francisco's most urgent demand upon it. The work should be done in
a manner that will not leave it open to more than one interpretation.
In the meantime let the petition to Congress for a further appropri
ation be circulated and signed. No further time should be lost.
A MONSTER MASS -MEETING
Five Large Commercial Bodies to
Petition the Authorities to
Hasten the Work.
On Thursday, March 4, there will be a
grand meeting of the members of rive of
the largest commercial and industrial
bodies on the Pacific Coast, in the Cham
ber of Commerce, at 2p. m. The purpose
of this gathering will be to prepare a
petition to be forwarded to the authori
ties at Washington asking that every
effort be made to get the work on the new
San Francisco Postoffice started at as
early a day as possible; also to netition
Congress at its prospective extra session
to appropriate a quarter of a million dol
lars more, in order that when the work is
started there will be no delay for the lack
of funds.
This decision was arrived at yesterday
at a meeting in tne Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association rooms in the
Mills building that was composed of rep
resentatives of the leading commercial
and industrial bodies. Julian Sonntag,
president of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, presided. Hugh
Craig, president of the Chamber of Com
merce, represented that body. The Cali
fornia Stcte Board of Trade was repre
sented by Vice-president J. S. Emory and
Manager J. A. Filcher. J. R. Freud of
the Merchants' Association represented
that body. Colonel John P. Irisn, one of
the Postoffice Site Commissioners, was
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
there also. A. A. Watkins, president of
the Board of Trade of San Francisco,
telephoned that business prevented him
from being present, but h9 understood
the nature of the movement and was in
sympathy with it.
Mr. Sonntag gave a brief explanation
of the objects of the meeting and said that
tno matter of thp erection of the new Kan
Francisco Postoffice is being agitated. He
said that if the organizations there repre
sented should join hands in concentrated
and concerted action he believed that
something might be accomplished. There
is no use for any single body to undertake
to set thÂ» ball rolling, if ull would per
form their parts the very nature and back
ing of such a petition as the one suggested
would certainly be felt In Washington.
With a large sum of money already in
hand it would be very desirnble to start
the work as quickly as possible. The ex
cavation for the foundations could at least
be made.
Colonel Irish, by reason of his posi
tion and having recently bsen to Wash
ington, was able to give much informa
tion upon the subject. Colonel Irish was
evidently of the opinion that the reason
the work on the Postoffice was not begun
long atro was because of the attitude of
the people of San Francisco if their posi
i tion could be determined by utterances of
certain newspapers \n this City, for he
said: "I was in Washington only a short
time ago and called upon Secretary Car
lisle and upon the supervising architect Oj2
the -treasury,, and the position San Fran
cisco has placed itself' in in tbe eyes of
those at the capital is that of a semi-oar
baric people. I will show you how.
"Two years ago Secretary Carlisle was
intending to start the work of building
the new Postolfice here, and word to that
effect, soon reached this City. What
was the result? Immediately after the
Examiner of San Francisco came out
with columns denouncing the site as unfit
for such a structure and declared that the
site was a bo^hole and that the masons
could not build the walls last enough to
keep the last row of bricks above the sur
lace, so fast would, the whole structure
sink. Even editorially the paper declared
that the building should never be placed
oh the site selected. ' The Keport took up
-the matter in the same v in. These edi
torials and local clippings were sent by the
dozens to the Secretary in letters, in which
the writers, basing their assumptions upon
this newspaper rot, advised Mr. Carlisle
not to let the work be done there.
"The result was just what might be ex
pected. The Secretary quit then and
there and said that he would not be re
sponsible or tase any chances upon mak
.ing a mistake that involved so many hun
dred thousand dollars of the Govern
ment's money. As I said these papers
and the people of this City are wholly re
sponsible for this lone delay in beginning
the construction of this Federal building,
.and not the architect nor the Secretary.
The latter showed a desire even after re
' ceiving these newspaper clippings and the
letters to do all that he c uld and had a
board of military engineers rebore the
â¢ ground all over the postoffice lot and the
report showed that tbe foundations would
be as good as any in the City. In other
â words, good and solid. On another occa
sion the Examiner published articles in
which it sail that we do not need such a
building south of Market street and these
. clippings were also sent to the officials at
Washington, which did not in any way
hasten the work contemplated.
, "Then again the plans of the building
have been attacked by people in this City.
"I brought nul a prospectus view of the
"new Postoffiee and put it on exhibition. j
It was at once denounced by Willis Polk i
as being unsightly and having the appear
ance of a cross between a Madison-square j
boarding-house and a brewery. He stated
that his opinion was shared by the editor
of the American Architect, but that gen- j
tleman wrote to me and he indorsed the I
plans as good. So you see the people j
themselves are to blame for all this delay.
The Secretary of the Treasury could not
consistently go on with the work with ob
jections to the plans and the stability of
the foundations seriously questioned. '
"Years ago I showed that the Seventh- !
street lot was never a bog, but to the cor.- I
trary that there was a hill forty to sixty ',
â¢ feet high over the present site. I even
produced the affidavits of the men who
graded the lot to its present level for
â¢Pope & Talboi."
â¢ J. A. Filcher at this point made an ex
cellent suggestion by saying: "Admitting
all thi3 to bs true would not a petition 'â 
-and request from our combined respective
bodies counteract the impressions made at j
Washington? Tie members of our several ;
commercial and industrial organizations j
ar. 1 the representative citizens of San !
Francisco, and a strong petition from us:
would impress the officials at the capital I
with the true sentiments of our people. '
This should be our object in dealing with '
.this proposition, ana it would pave the '
way to our getting what we want from
the Federal Government, and without
much delay, I think."
Mr. Emeryâ l am of the same opinion |
as Mr. Fiicher. By showing in the way I
â¢indicated that the true sentiment here is j
friendly instead of hostile to the project i
we could no doubt get the work of exca
vating for the foundation started very
soon.
Chairman Sonntagâ l am sure that with |
such an understanding our several bodies i
would take up this matter in earnest and j
that our friendly attitude, as representing !
the true and unselfish sentiments of the j
people of San Francisco, will show Secre- <
tary Carlisle exactly how the representa- i
tive people of this City view the situa
tion.
Colonel Irish â If this matter is taken i
up in such a manner and in such a spirit j
vonr wishes can, I am sure, be gratified. I
Ca.ll together the members of your organi
zations, pass appropriate resolutions and
draft a petition to tha Pacific Coast Sena- j
tors and Representatives and to the Sec- !
retary of the Treasury as to what is j
wanted. There will no doubt be an extra i
session of Congress called for about March
12. Have the Pacific Coast representatives
ask for an additional appropriation of
about $250,000. There is on hand now
available about $240, C0D. With these two
sums of money there would not be any |
necessity of stopping the worn after it is
begun, waiting for the next regular Con
gress to act upon such an appropriation
as I suggest.
Hugh Craig stated that he was convinced I
that the plan offered would meet with sue- '
cess. He is sure that there will be much !
less delay, he said, in this work than is
anticipated. The Chamber of Com
merce, of which he is the president, has
had this subject under consideration on
several occasions and much corre
spondence has passed between the cham
ber and Secretary Carlisle. The last
letter upon this subject sent to the Secre
tary was in the nature of an inquiry as to
the present situation upon the entire
Postc ftice proposition. To that the follow
ing self-explanatory letter was received :

HOW THE SITE WAS CHOSEN.
John P. Irish Explains Why the Seventh-Street Lot Was Considered
Most Eligible.
The several reports of the commission transmitting to the three
Cabinet officers the sites offered, described each, located them all upon
an acompanying map and gave the superficial area in square feet and
the price per square foot. In each report we indicated our judgment of
the eligibility of the sites in the order in which it appeared to us. We
merely nominated the sites, and the Postmaster-General, Attorney-
General and Secretary of the Treasury elected upon our nomination.
A part only of the present site was first offered, and because of its in
ferior area was not rated by us first in eligibility. Its area was subse
quently largely increased, and in our last report we rated it first in
eligibility. r JOHN P. IRISH. ,
to me that tbe work can be taken up with
out much delay or trouble. lam confi
dent that if we place tbe matter properly
before our representatives at Washington
they will be able to secure the desired ap
propriation, so that the work will go on
continuously, and not be delayed until the
next regular "eusion of Congress."
"That being the general sentiment,"
said Chairman Sonntac, "it will be un
derstood that we call for a mass-meeting
of the Chamber of Commerce, the City
Board of Trade, tbe State Board of Trade,
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation and the Merchants' Association to
take up the matter upon the plan sug
gested. I hope every member will attend
and show what the true sentiment of Ban
Franciscans really is."
Mr. Freud said that the Merchants' As
sociation, as indicated by the board of di
rectors, is favorable to the project, but
that at the last meeting it was decided
to send to Congressmen Loud and Ma
guire asking for information as to the
cause of tbe delay. An answer is ex
pected by mail, but as the movement is
now making such progress he would ask
for this information by telegraph, and bis
body will no doubt act upon the matter as
soon as the answÂ«y> are received.
After a little discussion it was decided
that the joint mass-meeting of the five
organizations will be held in tbe Chamber
of Commerce on Thursday, March 4, at 2
p. m. The calis of the several presidents
upon the members to be present r.t that
gathering will be sent out on next Mon
day and Tuesday.
LEGISLATORS ACT.
The Senate Unanimously Passes
Wolfe's Resolution Demanding: a
Federal Building.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 26.â a
unanimous vote the Senate to-day passed
Wolfe's resolution calling on the Senators
and Congressmen at Washington from
California to take steps that will cause the
issuance of orders to begin work at once
oh tbe proposed new Postoffice and Fed
eral building at San Francisco.
I There was a special caucus of the Re
publicans of both houses this morning to
consider the abolition of the rule prohib
iting the introduction of any measure but
revenue bills after the fiftieth day of the
session of the Legislature. While it was
admitted that the rule was in contraven
tion of tbe constitution of the State it was
decided to retain it.
In view of this decision Wolfe changed
his resolution so as to make it a simple
Senate resolution instead of a joint reso
lution, by striking out the words "the
Assembly concurring" in the first resolu
tion, which left it to read:
Whereas, There has been inexplicable and
apparently inexcusable delay on the part of
the Federal authorities at Washington, D. C,
in ordering the commencement of work on
the Postoffice building to be constructed on
the site already purchased at the northeast
corner of Seventh and Mission street*. San
Francisco, and for which there is now $210,
--000 available for immediate use in the treas
ury of the United States; and whereas, there
is a large numb?r of unemployed men in San
Francihco, who have gathered there from all
parts of the State and who are anxious
and clamorine for an opportunity to earn
a living by honest toil, and who would be af
forded the opportunity the* desire if this work
were begun at once; au'i, whereas, the
construction of a new Postoffice at San Fran
cisco is. a necessity demanded, not only by the
commercial needs of that City and the entire
State, but will be a boon to every section
whose mail must pass through that City;
therefore be it
Resolved. By the Senate, that our Senators 111
Coueress be instructed, and our Representa
tive* therein hi requested and urge 1 to take
such action as will cause the proper authori
ties at Washington, D. C, to issue the neces
sary orders to have the work of constructing
the San Francisco Postoffice -building begun
forthwith; and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
forwarded to said Senators and Representa
tives in Congress by the Secretary of the
Senate. â¢ . â¢â -
In this form it was received and read by
the Seer -tary. Wolfe moved its adoption
and Voorheis seconded the motion. Wolfe
spoke to the resolution as follows:
"This resolution is the expression of the
sentiments of the people of San Francisco.
It is well known to those people and tne
rest of the people of the State that San
Francisco has no Federal building worthy
of being so designated. It is the largest
commercial center of the Pacific Coast
and should be shown more consideration
than has hitherto been accorded it at the
National Capitol.
"If this resolution is adopted it will
hasten the action of the Federal authori
ties, and tbis means that It will give work
to the hundreds of unemployed now seeK
ing avenues of honest employment in San
Francisco. It also means, if tbe Federal
authorities are induced to act, that proper
mail facilities wiil be civen the business
men of San Francisco and of the entire
State.
"San Francisco has poorer accommoda
tions with reference to its Federal busi
ness than any city in the United States,
and its Postoffice accommodations are in
ferior to those of a city one- tenth its size.
Sacramento and Carson have Federal
buildings that they can be proud of, but
San Francisco, by reason of the inactivity
of its representatives in Congress and the
unexplained discrimination against her
Â»t Washington, has been unable to get
recognition, and I know that if this reso
lution be adopted it will hasten the neces
sary action and give us what we so much
need."
Senator Mahoney advocated the adop
tion of tbe resolution. He said:
"I heartily concur in the resolution
offered by my colleague, and know that it
meets with tde approval of tbe ptople of
San Francisco. Tbe site for the Postoffice
was "purchased two or three years ago, nnd
there is now over $200,000 in the treasury
of the United States, remaining out of
this purchase price, which is available for
the construction of the building. For
some reason or other it has never been
offsred to San Francisco. I hope that this
resolution wiil meet with the approval of
this Senate."
Senator Seawell favored the adoption of
the resolution in the following words:
"It affords me pleasure to indorse the
resolution offered here in the interest of
San Francisco and the country that is
tributary to it. That City in the line of
public buildings Is not .up to that stand
ard that it ought to be, and has not re
ceived that recognition by the Federal
Government that it ought to have receivea.

portant ports in the world. Ban Fran
cisco deserves more than it is asking for
in this direction, and I heartily concur
with these gentlemen in this suggestion;
and I would further suggest that if this
policy were pur.-ued and continued by the
people of this commonwealth the waves
of the great ocean that sing a constant
lullaby to the couriers of commerce that
leave our shores would be bearing on their
bosoms a much larger number of these
white-winged carriers. I hope this reso
lution will be adopted, and by a unani
mous vote."
Thirty-one Senators voted on the reso
lution and not a dissenting voice was
beard.
THE ARCHITECT AWAKE.
WASHINGTON", I>. C, Feb. 26.â The
supervising architect of the Treasury
has evidently heard from some of the
San Francisco people, for THE CALL.
correspondent learned to-night that he
ii at last making extraordinary efforts
to push ihe San Francisco Postofflce
building- plans to completion and to
commence work as soon as possible.
Senator Perkins and Representative
I. oud, in response to urgent request
from THE CALL, will use every effort
to induce the Treasury Department to
commence -work this *pring. They do
not hope to be able to do anything,
however, until the new administration
is installed.
LABOR COUNCIL IN LINE.
Will Urare That the Work on the
Postoffice Be Bsgun at Once.
The San Francisco Labor Council, which
is the central body of the local unions,
has taken up the Postoffice matter. At
the regular meeting last evening Secre
tary Rosenberg called attention to the
situation and said that to have tne work
on tbe prorosed Federal building begun
at once would afford creat relief to
a large number of laborers and me
chanics cf all kinds. An extra session
of Congress will b3 called under the
new administration, and the Pacific
Coast representatives in Washington
would be able to do much toward obtain
ing a fair-sized appropriation from Con
gress in addition to that already appro
priated or left over after the purchase of
tbe San Francisco site.
Delegates Hawks, McArthur, Robbins
and others spoke in a similar vein. The
matter was referred to the law and legis
lative committee of the council, which re
tired and a little later returned with the
following resolution, which was unani
mously adopted.
WHEKEAS, The Postofflce facilities
of San Francisco have for many years
been very inadequate and a cause of
great inconvenience and a commercial
loss; and whereat, there is in the hand*
Â«f the Treasury Department of (he
United Sta'es tho sura of 8240, 000 left
over from the appropriation forth* pur
chagt* of the Site for the lostoffloe at
San Francisco; and whereat, there is
now a season of unxxainpled distress
in San Francisco, and that work on the
Postofflce would furnish employment to
a largo number or mechanics; therefore,
bo it
HfMnlt-fd, By the San Francisco Labor
Council in re B ul:Â»r sevnion assembled, on
February 26, 1897, That our represen
tatives and the authorities in Washing
ton be earnestly requested to use every
â¢ ffort to expedite t <iÂ«. beginning of this
most necessary public work; and
Brmolreil, That a copy of these resolu
tions be forwarded to our represent*
tives in Congress and to the authorities
in Washington.
NO REASON FOR DELAY.
W. H. Mills Says That If Wa Want a
Government Building We
Should Have It.
W. H. Mills, laDd agent of the Southern
Pacific Company, said:
If the Government of the United States in
tends to construct a Urge Government build
ing, popularly known as a "Postoffico build-
Ing," but which in fact will be & home for
Government offices, such aa Federal courts.
Federal land offices, incidentally some of the
offices connected with the revenue services ot
the United States and the Postofficc, now
would be the best time tn the world in which
to expend the money, not oniyb. cause gov
ernments arc bound to consider the condition
of the people, but because the same money will
go farther, expended now. tnau when prosper
ity is restored.
In addition to the fact that the expenditure
of Government money, which must sooner
or 1r ter be expended, and a Urge percentage
of which is now on hand, would relieve the
distro-s of the unemployed, it is also obvious
that now wouM be an excellent timo in which
to spend that money. In short, if ihe Govern
ment is going to build that Pos'.office they
might jnst as well do it now as at any time,
â¢ nit better.
However, the construction of a great post
office building is an anachronism. In all
cities of Europe ana America the branch post
office is just as much an independent post
office as the main post^flice of any city. Alia
general postoffice building is used for is to
distribute ihe mail In such a way that it may
be sent directly to the branch offices in the
city. What the Government should have done
was to have built a imull general Postoffice
building and constructed, as they were needed,
branch Posiofflce buildings for the use of the
districts wnich they serve, and serve as abso
lutely as the postoffiea At Stockton or Xapa
serves the town. Now, take Loi.don for ex
ample; the necessity for a building in tnat
city is not greater than it is at Los Angeles or
Sacramento. The postoffice districts ot London
are so well known ihat letters are addressed to
them by district, and- the district postofflce
serves exactly the purpose that Â»postoffice
buildings serve the towns of the State. Ttie
time was when a p stofflce building vas
visited by the people, but that was before you
had the carrier system, beforo you had the
branch postoffice system and before yoa had
what is called "the railway mall service," by
which tbe matter is distributed into sacks ad
dressed to branch postoffices.
Let us illustrate this with a familiar exam
ple. The mail for this building, if properly
addressed, never passes through the Postoffice
at all. Oar mall that we send on t never sees
the Postoffice in San Francisco. It is distrib
uted by clerks ia the service of the railway
mail service on postal cars into sacks and de
livered directly here. This ia the case with
all tho branch offices. The mail is delivered
directly from the distributing office on the
trains to the branch offices in the cities and
sent by carrier to the proper address. This
eliminates the Postoffice building ior postal
purposes. We may safely predict that the San
Francisco Postoffice building will be the last of
its kind. At the same time the Government
has determined upon the policy of building a
great buildin? for postal services in San Fran
cisco. The suggestion that it will cease to
have the uses to which the same buildings
were devoted in times past h*s no practical
bearing on the case on hand, and tbe time to
build it Is now.
It is a matter of much surprise to Eastern
visitors that San Francisco has no Govern
ment building, and it is a matter of difficult
explanation why there Is a good postoftice
building at Sacramento nnd none in this City.
It is hardly fair to attribute this lack of at
tention to the Postoffice building to tbe inef
ficiency of the people who have represented
this City in Congress. I, for one, am disposed
to think that it has been due to the dissensions
among our own peopie here in San Francisco.
The City has been represented by men of large
ability and great efficiency. Horace Davis and
Charles M. Clayton might be named iv this
connection, besides Senator Aaron A. Sargent,
who waa tbe most efficient Senator tde State
ever had, and who exerted himself frequently
on benalf of San Francisco's Fostoffice build
ing. A peculiar fatality has atteuded the un
dertaking since the first. There is no apology
at the present time, however, for delay in tbe
construction, except the mere dilatoriness of
the officers of the Government who have
charge of this construction. They have the
necessary appropriation and a site has been
selected and conveyed. There is co reason
now why the construction of the building
should not be proceeded with.
I want to say this: If The Call succeeds by
the agitation it has raised in securing tho con
struction of this building It will be an addi
tional Uluifrntfon of the already recoguized
fact that an energetic newspaper is better than
a Congressman.
FURTHER TESTS.
Piles to Be Driven and Heavily
Weighted In Four Deep Pits.
The report of the local military en
gineers who last year had charge of what
was the second test of tbe ground for tne
new Federal building has not yet been
made public, though it was filed sorce time
since in Washington. It is given out
*emi-officially, however, that it was favor
able to the erection of a heavy structure.
A complete test was not made owing to
lack of funds, only $30C0 having been
originally available for the use of both
commissions.
Four large square holes were dag to a
depth of from titteen to twenty feet under
what would be the positions of the four
corners, or heaviest parts of the building.
At a depth of fifteen feet below tbe sur
face of the ground yellow sand containing
small particles of iron was found in all
cases. It was the same kind of sand found
at lesser depths and on tha surface.
Tbe tests mad* in the four pits con
sisted in placing sixteen tons of pig iron
upon a board fitted into the bottom of tbe
pit after the water had been puniped out.
After the first compression there was no
settling. Water was stiuck in all of tbe
pits, and samples of it still on exhibition
in the military engineer's office here in
dicate that some of the pita furnish clear
well water. The water level in the different
pits was not tbe same. It varied from a
foot to two feet.
The lowest point of the deepest founda
tion of the building would, it is stated, be
13.84 feet above tbe plane of tbe City
directrix, or tide water level.
The complete test contemplated tbe
driving of two piles into the bottom of
each pit, and then placing upon them a
weight not of only sixteen tons but of
eighty lons of pig iron.
This conclusive test will be made when
an appropriation is obtained sufficient to
defray the expense of the piles, the rent
of the pig iron and of the piledriver, and
the cost of labor. Such a test can, it is
asserted, be easily concluded in six weeks.
The four pits are now simply covered over
with boards awaiting further operations.
LOCAL MERCHANTS SPEAK.
All Want Work on the Building to
Begin at Once.
Among the merchants the sentiment in
favor of urging ibe matter of beginning
work on the new Postoffice building is
unanimous. All are heartily in accord
with the views of The Call, and few for
got to say bo.
"This matter has been delayed entirely
too long," said George W. Raphael of
Raphael Bros. "In my opinion the prin
cipal fault lies with our delegation in
Congress.
"They are the men to urge this project.
It is their dnty to strain every nerve to
see that the matter receives immediate
attention.
"The ground has been paid for, and
there is a large surplus in the treasury.
It should be used at once as a starter.
"'Jhk Call has, with its usual Tim and
foresight, taken voluntarily upon Itself
the duty of securing the Postottiee in the
uear future, and I hope its efforts will
bear good fruit."
"You can count me in on anything that,
will help to awaken the Federal official*
from their lethargy." said Henry Froh
man, a member of tne firm of Kohlbcrg,
Strauss <fe Frohman. "and it is a grand
idea of Thi Call tr step forward and di
rect the attention of the people to the fact
that they are not in receipt of something
lone due.
'â¢I am very much In favor of doing
everything that can be done. For that
matter everybody else feels the same way.
It will put many men to work at once.
If there is anything we need here much
more tnan a chance for the worthy poor
to earn bread I am ignorant of it.
"If The Call urges this matter force
ful;y, as I have no doubt it will, some good
wiJl result. Tnere can be nodoubt of that.
The construction of this building should
j have been begun a long while ago. If we
I are not going to have it pretty quick it is
our rightâ nay, our duty â to demand a
good and sufficient explanation."
Charles Keiiusof the Hub was emphatic
in his views and wasted no time in ex
pressing them. "Sorely in need" of a
postoffice is the way he put it.
"The quicker the work is begun the bel
ter," he said, "'lhe present quarters are
an outrage on a city of 300.000 inhabitants.
They are fit to be exhibited to strangers
as a monument of ancient days.
"The Call is one of the foremost jour
nals of the day in everything thai relates
to enterprise, and if it stays with its fight
it will not be long till we will have a post
office to be proud of."
"There fs no question but that the con
struction of the Postoffice would do the
town a vast deal of good," said N. P. Cole
of the California Furniture Company.
"We are talking about taking up sub
scriptions for the poor. Well, in my
opinion, if the Government is unable to
start our Postoffice we had better take up
a few subscriptions to help it along. Un
cle Sam can help the workmen of this
j City a great deal ys<t at present.
"We may have men at the head of the
Government in a week or two who will do
something. When we have paid for the
site, tt:e plans for the building have been
adopted, and there is a surplus to our
credit in the treasury, I fail to find any
good excuse for delaying the work. The
fact that Thk Call fails to find any either
| serves to strengthen that opinion."
"There can be no two opinions in tne
matter," asserted Quincy A. Chase of the
firm of Kohler & Chase. "The construc
tion of the building snould be begun at
once.
"San Francisco has yielded a big reve
nue to the Government and it seems
strange to me that while third and fourtn
rate towns in the East get postoffices we
are left out in the cold.
"The site has been paid for and is lying
there useless. I cannot see why the sur
plus is not utilized to begin work on the
building."
J. F. Sullivan, proprietor of Sullivan's
shoestore, was also a warm advocate of
the work beginning at once. In fact he
said he was willing to be put down as say
ing anything at all so long as it was favor
able.
"There can be no possible process of
reasoning t>y which any man can find a
sufficient excuse for delaying matters,"
he declared. "We are entitled to the
building and it would help the town won
derfully.
"Other places not half so large have
been given good postoffices, but up to date
all we have is a site. We should have the
building."
baid R. E. Marx, manager of the Maze:
"The Call has started in the right direc
tion. We need the building, and further
more we deserve it. it will be one of the
best solutions of the mooted problem of
work for the unemployed yet discovered.
"We have the site paid for. The plans
of the building have been adopted. Now,
with a surplus on hand, let us have the
building by all means.
"The reasons advanced for the delay
amouut to nothing. Our representatives
in Congress ought to make themselves
heard on this subject. If The Call stays
with it they will uave it."
"The building cannot be started too
quick for us," was the emphatic declara
tion of Marshall Hale of Hale Bros., "and
I am unable to see why things have been
delayed no long.
"Mr. Loud is the Congressman from the
particular district in which the site lies,
and I deem it his duty to atir matter* up
a bit.
"The appropriations for the smaller
towns have been carried out. San Jose
and Sacramento bavo good vostoffice
buildings, and we should see to it tlat
there is no more dawdling in our case."
"We ought to have bad that building
long ago." said A. H. Page of the Indian
apolis Furniture Company. "We nave
been treated worse than a tenth-rate
village would have been in the Eastern
States.
"Tbe Postoffice we have now is not one
fourth large enough. It wss built tc
supply the wants of a town of a few thou
sand peopte, but while it has remained
the same we have grown.
"I cannot understand why the work has
been delayed so long. Our Congressmen
should look to it at once."
Attorney Creswelt.
City Attorney Harry T. Creswellâ The
Government of the United States ought to
own a building Â».n ev^ry large city of the
country and each -building should be largo
enough to accommodate all tne Govern
ment offices in its particular locality.
That is the first reason for hastening the
com pletion of the new Poatoffice. Further
more, such a structure ous;ht to be cen
trally located, so thut citizens who have
business with federal officers will not be
compelled to go miles ou' of their way in
order to attend to their affairs. Therefore
I hope for sniedy action in completing
the new building so thai the public may
be accommodated. In like manner and for
similar reasons I hope to see the dome of
the new City Hall complete and finished
in sucti n manner that it may be occupied
by the California Supreme Court, thus
giving that honorable body the fittest
apartments in the world and bringing all
our State courts under one roof. Besides
the State would pay $600 a month rent to
the City.
County Clerk Curry.
County Clerk C. F. Curryâ Without a
donbt the Government officials ought to
have their memories jogged. Possibly
they have forgotten that the people have
rights which ttiey are bound to respect.
When McKinley is in the White House
there will be no more trouble having such
public matters adj :sfed. He will give
some thought to the interests of the
people of this City as well a3 of the rest of
the country. The money that would be
paid out in this work would help many
deserving men, and would relieve their
wives and children from the fear of priva
tion if not of actual hunger. The effort to
secure speedy action in this bu*iness de
serves and ought to have the support of
ali good citizens irrespective of party.
The work ought to ba commenced as soon
as possible.
Colonel George H. Mendel!.
Colonel George H. Mendel 1, one of the
three engineers who orieinally tested the
stability of the site of the pro Dosed Fed
eral building â It was three years ago that
1 made the examination and I do not re
call the details, but I know that I found
no reason why the buildiDg should not be
placed there. I found no indication of a
bog. The foundation would be as good as
that for any of the big buildings now in
the City. There has been, howsver, an
other examination since then conducted
by Lieutenant Davis.
Supervisor Delaney.
Supervisor Delaney â I am heartily and
strongly in favor of having the Board of
Supervisors take such action as may tend
to hasten up the dilatory people at Wash
ington in reference to the construction of
the new Postotfice. The board should
make itself understood fully and show
that it is in earnest in voicing the wish of
the people for fair treatment. I will vote
for any resolution to that end. There are
many idle people and they should be
given a chance to go to work.
Collector W!s-Â» Surprised.
Collector of the Port John H. Wiseâ l
am certainly surprised that something
has not been done to start the work on
the new Postoffice and Federal building.
When Mi-. Clark was in this City ho told
me that work would probably be begun
by the first of last November. The new
building is certainly needed, and needed
badly, for this ojd tumble-down structure
is not only a disgrace to the City, but to
tally inadequate for the business tuat is
transacted here. I undei stood that the
lot had been tested and found fit for the
building, and that the only obstacle to
beginning work was toe matter of the de
sign, which was not satisfactory to the
people of this City.
If that has been satisfactorily arranged,
I see no reason why the work should not
begin at once. It would certainly give
work to many idle men and put a large
amount of money in circulation that is
now lying in the Treasury. It would be a
great thing for the unemployed.
W. W. Foote Says Move.
"I would like to see work on the build
ing commenced at once," said W. W.
Foote, "in view of the fact that there is at
present a large number of idle men in the
City. If work should begin it would be
the means of putting a larse amount of
money in circulation and would help to
tide over any stringency."
Unlock tha Money.
City and County Treasurer Widberâ
There can be no better time than the
present to begin work upon the now Post
office. The appropriation made for the
building should be used. The money
should be unlocked. In circulation it
will do much more good than it can do
while locked up in a vault. The great
number of unemployed persona in the
C.ty indicates unmistakably the desir
ability of going to work as soon as pos
sible.
Tax Collector Block.
Tax Collector Blockâ The present Post
office was ancient thirty - eight years
ago. It is clearly inadequate and
the psople at Washington know
that to be thÂ«s fact. So 1 cannot un
derstand why the new Postoffice is not got
under way. Tuis is a propitious time to
begin. I am most assuredly in favor of
exerting all the pressure that can be
brought to bear on the supervising archi
tect through our Representatives in Cou
gress, or otherwise, tiiat we can exert.
"Cupid" Danforth Solid.
"Cupla" Danforth â While there are
several things Sac Francisco needs de
cidedly, there is no more pressing neces
sity than the need for the new Postoffice.
That is so evident a fact tnat it admits of
no question.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
S. E Mcffett Treats on That
Subject Before the Iroquois
Club. .
Dr. Ragau's Caustic Letter. of ; Criti
â ;." cismâ Money for the Unem
ployed Fund.
â  The regular meeting of the Iroquois
Club was enlivened last evening with a
paper by S. E. Moffett on the subject of
"National Postal Savings Banks." The
lecturer was a warm advocate of the sys
tem, and was greeted with applause. la
part, the paper was as follows:
In view of the consuming anxiety now pre
vailing about the precarious condition of the
Nation*', finances and the talk about Issues of
bonds, exchequer bills and other devices for
brldgln* taps in revenues and taking care of
an inelastic currency, :: is rattier curious that
so little attention has been paid to the fiscal
advances that might begained from a sys
tem of postal savings banks. â  : â â ,:."
In Great Britain more than two-thirds of all
the savings deposit* are kept in the postal
banks. The proportion In round numbers in
1894 was $446,000,000 for jostal to $217,000,
--; 000 for private savings banks, and the postal
banks had 6,108.763 -.depositor!", against
1.470,946 i:-. the private institutions. In (he
United States in 1894-95 the savings deposits
aggregated $1,310,597,023. Two-th;rdÂ« of
this amount would be almost $1,207,000,000,

or nearly 50 per cent more than the total
bonded National debt. .
If we should take in deposits to this extent
they would enable us to redeem all our out
standing bonds of 1907 at the smallest Drict,
and have a reserve of nearly $300,000, C00 lei t
which we could keep on hand lor use in par.*
for other purpose?, us seemed most convenient.
That such a reserve would more than be am
pie, the experience of existing savings banks
abundantly proves.
The aggregate savings deposits in the
United States were $1,524,844,506 in the fiscal
ycsr 1890, $1,023,074,749 in 1891, $1,712.
--169,026 in 1892. $1,783,150,957 in 1893, $1,
--747.961,280 in 1894. a-.d $1,810,597,023 in
1895. ' The growth has been, almost continu
ous. â¢ Even the punic of 1893 caused a decline
of only about $37,000,000 in tne amount of
deposits, and lack of confidence in the safety
of private institutionsâ in many cases too
well justified â was largely responsible for
that.
It is evident that as a rule new deposits
may be saieiy counted upon- to balance with
drawals in the absence of douot as ;o tho
solvency of the Government,
The entire record of tne American savings
banK system from its origin in 1816 discloses
only four instances in which the aggregate
deposits have declined from cue year to the
next. There never has beeen a year in which
the net withdrawals have reached $80.
--000,000. If the savings deposits had been
secured by the credit of the Government it is
doubtful whether there could e'er have been
any net withdrawals at all.
The value of Eug'.i>h postal deposits has
steadily increased every year since the estab
lishment of the system in 1861, although the
deposits in private savings Links are no
greater now than they were thirty-five years
ago and have fluctuated from year to year.
The fundamental. vice. ot our present cur
rency system, according to "sound money"
authorities, is that f no Government is doing a
banking business without having any of a.
batik's resources for takii c care of its notes.
Postal savings banks would give it absolute
control of the currency, ana this whether our
standard were gold, silver, bimetallic or fiat.
The chief objection to the Postal Savings
Bank system from an abstract point of view is
that the Government has no means of invest
ing deposits to advantage. It would be easy
to mention investments it could safely make,
but we have no need to disturb ourselves
a com such things under present conditions.
The Government now has the best possible in
vestment in its own bonded debt.
In Great Britain, with little more than half
our population, there were 7,579.709 savings
banks deposits in .. 1894. .Evidently Great h
Britain taps a stratum <a population mat our 1
savings banks do not touch. }
Th" little rills of private thrift continue to
fill the reservoir of public credit. We are al
most the oniy great Nai'cm that entirely ig
nores tnis natural association, neglecting at
once the interests of the people who need ab
solute security for their earnings mid of the
Government that needs the use of those earn
ings. In France there is not only a national
postal-savings system, but there are municipal
and school systems.
Among all the millions of depositors in the
pub.ic savings banks of Europe not one has
ever lost a cent through the laiiure of the in
stitution to which he has intrusted his earn
ings. Compare that with the black trail of
ruined lives left by American savings banks.
In the three-years before January 1, 1897, the
loss of depositors in twenty-two bankrupt sav
ings banes in New York City alone amounted
to $4,475,061.
The recent failure of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank in San Francisco robbed 12,000
depositors of their accumulated earning):, left
many in destitution, drove others to suicide,
and others from good homes to the slums.
But when the Government can end all these -
evils at a stroke, not only without cost but
with a profit to itself. Its persistent refusal to
do so deserves some harder name than negli
gence.
Dr. Rapan, who was blackballed at the
last meeting, sent in a drastic letter com
menting on the club's degeneracy, and
explaining that the bringing forward of
bis name was a mistake. On motion of
Max Popper all proceedings in relation
thereto were expunged from the roll.
H. P. Andrew?, District Attorney of
Tehama County, was accepted in 10 mem
bership and made a speech of thanks.
On motion $50 was ordered taken from
the duo's treasury to helD swell the fund
ior the relief of. the unemployed.
The subject for discussion at the next
meeting will be:
Resolved, That a general treaty of arbitra
tion between nations to provide a court or
triDunal for the fetl.ement of international
disputes between the treaty nations is a de
lusion and a -iiuro and as imprnotUio.l as it is
undesirable".
A letter from William J. .Bryan to
Charles Gild ea, ex-president of the club,
making formal acknowledgment of an in

â¢" Touching Address of the
â¢ â¢ " Evening.
.; SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. North,
r>f Alauieaa, appeared to-night in the role
of a premonition. He entered the Assem- i
bly 'at 7:30 in evening dress, but illy con- j
cealed w;tij a fawn-colored box overcoat. j
.His ample shirt-bosom blazed under the
glare of the incandescent-light chandeliers
â¢â¢ in the full glory of a French laundry. And j
there were others. Clawhammer coats j
'.. were the rule. The manhood and the
i beauty of Sacramento crowded the gal-
I leries and the lobbies until the air became
I 1-ot.atid very uncomfortable, but heat and
y discomfort were ignored, for it was to be a
great occasi n â the reception of the first
member of the Cabinet from California,

guest in front of the Speaker's desk, Mr.
Bruner introdncad Judge McKenna in a
â well-worded address, to which Speaker j
Coombs replied by inviting Judge Mc-
Kenna to take a seat with him, and made
â¢ a speech eulogistic of the distinguished
â  gentleman who, on being himself honored,
had honored California. Judge McKenna
replied as follows:

the Senate and Assembly and invited guests:

.it would take. But maybe things have

Mr. Speaker, on a few occasions lately I have

Gentlemen, what memories this hall recoils!
I was a member of the Legislature of 1875-70,
and occupied a seat upon this door lor lour
months. Where you sat, Mr. Speaker, sat Mr.
Carpenter of Ei Dorado, an aule gentleman,
quick in decision, but always impartial. On
the floor of the House was John R. MCConnell,
as able a man as I ever had the good fortune
to come in contact witn. His mind was a
bVisht storehouse of learning that he trans
muted into wisdom lor the instruction of nts
party. Here sat, also. Judge Lawrence Archer
of San Jose, an able, conscientious and upright
gentleman. Also C. P. Berry; now Assistant
Treasurer of the United States, than whom no
man on the floor of -the House is more direct
and clear. Judge Coffey was here, since be
come distlnguisncd as a judicial officer.
Scrivner was here, and others whom I have
not the time to mention. In the Upper House
was Farley, afterward United States Senator;
the gifted Edgerton. Pendcrgasi, Lewis, Pier
sou and others. I recall them all with pleat
ure ; I recall them all with sadijesfc.
Now, gentlemen, I am about to say farewell
to Cahiornia only for a while. Ido it in sad
ness, but I do it, I hope, as a representative of
this coast, and X hope to be able tojuntiiy
some expectation expressed about me, and I
shall surely carry those scenes of kindness
with me as a memory and as an incentive that
in my new place I will at least make an effort
to deserve it.
Governor Budd in response to a general
call made a characteristic speeca in which
he welcomed ttie 'distinguished guest of
the evening, and spoke of the university
bill which he propose^ to sign to-morrow.
He closed by saying that the university
and other great institutions of California
should be supported irrespective of reli
gion, politics or personal differences. .ââ¢ <
Senotar MorÂ«house made the molt elo
quent speech of the Evening. He began*
by. ing: "There are incidents, in the
life of every man and woman so dear and
tender, so sweet and sacred Hi at they will
unfold in the human heart like some* weet
petal of a bl ssorn, that the mother re
membering some kind word, perhaps
some fallen teardrop of a departed. child,
marks in the holy book the memory of
that child by placing there the petal of a
rose. Sometimes memories come to us
that leave in our souls such lingering
sweetness that all the future years cannot
wipe it away. We have witnessed such an
incident to-night."

HARD WORK AS TO
WAYS AND MEANS
Chairman Guy of the As
sembly Committee
Talks Business.
Rigid Inquiry Has Been Made
Into the Needs of State
Institutions.
Less Jur.kitinfe and a More Thorcu;h
Inspection Would Be an
Improvement.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 26.â One of
the bar.lest working ana ai the same time
most unassuming members of the Assem
bly la W. R. Guy of San D ego. As chair
man of the Committee on Ways and
Means, he has not had a day of rest since
Assemblyman W. R. Guy of : San
Diego.
tbe opening of the session, for he has in
troduced more bills than any other mem
ber of the House, ana all those bills are
important. When asked by a Call re
porter to-day as to the work of the Ways
and Means Committee, Guv replied:
"1 consider the Weys and Means Com
mittee t c business committee of the
House, and it is composed, as it should
be, of earnest, faithful, conservative busi
ness men of sound judgment in order that
all measures presented may be given care
and due deliberation. My aim as chair
man has been to make it a business com
mittee, and therefore I have not taken ad
vantage of my position to display myself
upon the floor of the House in making
motions or speeches.
"At our first lueeting, early in the ses
sion, I impressed this idea upon the
minds of members^ the committee. As
to the work of the%>mmmee, I will say
that at tbe outset a sub-committee -was ap
pointed, consisting of Sims. Leavitt and
myself, for the purpose of inquiring into
the needs of the various State institutions

and making estimates for the considera
tion of the committee.
"The lirst thing done by the sub-com
mittee was to fend out written int rroga
tories to all the S:ate institutions for the
purpose of ascertaining as near as we
could their present financial condition,
and also their estimate of future needs, to
the end that the committee might be
enabled to make a general forecast for the
coming fiical years.
"After we had received replies to those
written interrogatories and had exam
ined them, we sent invitations to the su
perintendents, or the management, of
those institutions, in order that some Â«.ne
might appear personally from each before
the sub-committee, in order that ail mat
ters and interrogatories affeclinsr ihe
wants of those institutions might be ex
planed and answered.
"That plno was followed and was
found to be a success. When we hud
those persons in <*ur presence and pro
pounded pertinent questions to tuem witn
reference to certain pretended needs, in
mauy instances they admitted that they
were not actual r.eces i mici. In every case,
and absolutely without fear or favor, we
endtavored to base our action on actual
neeiis. We were aiso enabled to get at
the truth by holding frfquer.t conferences
with psople lro:n those institutions.
'â¢Another and a very practical and
effectual means of enlightenment is visits
10 the instiiuiions in question. The
Wuvi and Means Committee or a sub
commitu-e from it should be the proper
visiting committee to inquire into the
condition ot State institution* by personal
inspection, for it is the committee which
is required to pass upon the appropria
tions to bi asked for by them. The
Legislature frequently scuds persons on
those visits who are not called upon to
pass upon questions affecting the condi
tion and necessities of public institutions.
"My judgment is that there really
should be an investigatiou made by some
committee â perhaps a sub-committee, or
the Ways and Means Committee, if it
could be continued. It should visit tho-e
State institutions within six weeks before
the meeting of the next Legislature and
mate a written report to that body or a
resolution, and that is, in my opinion,
the only way in which thu facts can be
gotten ut impartially. Under the present
system committees of the Legislature do
not havo time to make a props' and thor
ough investigation. Their coming is ex
pected by the officials, and when they
arrive they are dined and otherwise en
tertained socially and they are not able to
get at the einct facts. The effect of the
visit upon the committee is either good or
bad according to the social qualities and
enter tuning ability of the officials.
"There is always a tendency to influ
ence the chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee in favor of liberal ap
propriations, Dut all along the line we
have endeavored impartially to measure
the appropriations by the actual necessi
ties of the case. In some instances the
appropriations asked for have been cut 10
per cent, and in others much more than
tbat. We believe tnat the general appro
priation bill as we have reported it to the
Assembly is both fair and economical."

The Municipal Census Bill
Believed to Contain
a "joker."
May Place the City's Patronage
in the Hands of the
Governor.
With ioo.ooo Popu'atioa Los Angeles
Would Come Under State
Control.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 26.â The
municipal census bill, which has just been
signed by Governor Budd, providing for a
special census of California cities, con
tains, so far as it shall become operative
in this municipality, what is believed to
be a "joker." It is understood that the
bill was introduced at the solicitation o(
Postmaster John K. Matthews of this
Ctty. Matthews has for years desired an
increased allowance tor help in the mail
service of this city, rendered almost im
perative as a result of extending the
boundary lines of the municipality, as
well as by tho rapid increase of the popu
lation.
General Matthews learned from the de
partment at Washington that before an
extra allowance could be granted here it
would be necessary for the Legislature of
thi9 State, by special enactment, to make
provision for a new census of the City,
and if such census showed the increase
claimed by the Postmaster, the additional
allowance would be granted ; if otherwise,
the increase asked for would have to be
deferred until after the Government cen
sus of 1900. General Matthews, it ia said,
thereupon drafted the bill and pent it,
with his explanation, to Sacramento. The
plan seemed so reasonable and business
like that no one questioned the propriety
of the measure and it went through almost
unanimously.
But the bill might have been entitled,
"An act to increase the appointive power
of the Governor of California." la other
words, if Los Angel-es is shown by tbe new
census to have a population of 100,000 it
will be put in the same category as San
i'ranciscoand subject to the same law. in
this case the Governor will have the ap
pointment of the Police Commission, the
Health Department officials and others,
and in a large measure tbe control of the
municipal patronage will be placed in his
hands. Governor Budd would, of course,
place members of his own party in power
and displace about a score of Republicans
who came into office just a few weeks ago.
CROCKER'S SOUTHERN MISSION.
Sen Diegans Believe That Other Than
Masonic Matters Occupied His
Attention.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 26.â San
Diego people are considerably elated over
the visit of Colonel Charles F. Crocker,
vice-president of the Southern Pacific
Company, to that city on Wednesday
evening last. They see in it a mysterious
purpose on the part of the Southern Pa
cific ConiDany, in ihe event that Santa
Monica should not be choten as the deep
harbor site, to shift the business of the
company from Port Los Angeles to San
Diego, where there is undeniably a good
natural harbor. It is the favorite theory
of San Diegans that Huntington will
build directly across the desert from San
Diego to Yuma, and give Los Angeles the
gQ-by altogether on trans-Pacific business.
It has been reiteraied, however, that
Colonel Crocker's trip to Southern Cali
fornia ia not involved in mystery at all,
except as the affairs of Masonry are -mys
terious. The colonel is grand master of
the Grand Consistory of Cahlomia, Scot
tish Rite ilasons, and be is in Southern
California to make official and fraternal
visits to the brethren ot that rite in this
part of the State. He is accompanied by
Inspector-General "\V. Frank Pierce of the
Grand Consistory, and Charles L. Patton,
past grand master. Their visit to San
Diego was for the purpose of instituting a
lodge of perfection, which they did on the
evening of their arrival there, leaving at
an early hour the following morning for
this city.
Last evening these gentlemen visited
Los Angeles Commandery of Knight's
. Templar in the Masonic Temple and wit
nessed the ceremony ol the Order of the
Temple, conferred by Eminent Com
mander Frank iiader, and an inspection
of the commardery by Eminent Sir Addi
â  lon .Morgan, district inspector. Among
other distinguished Templars pre?ent
â were: Grand Generalissimo R. M. Powers
of San Diego, Dr. Thomas Flint, grand
.hifch priest of Royal Arch Masons; Emi
nent Sir Jesse B. Fuller of Mnrysville and
Past Grand Commander Henry Sayre
Orme and others.
Colonel Crocker's car was attached to a
train for the North to-day. He and the
gentlemen with him expressed great
pleasure at the fraternal reception which
they had enjoyed wuile in Southern Cali
fornia.

TERMS OF COUNTY OFFICERS.
Officials Must Be Remunerated for Services
Until Their Successors Take
Charge.
LOS ANGELES, Cal, Feb. 26.â The
Supreme Court nas finally determined the
much-mooted question concerning the pay
of ex-county officers for extra days at the
expiration of their terms before their suc
cessors came into oftice. The case was
entitled Henry C. Dillon, ex-District At
torney, respondent, vs. Charles C. Bick
neil, Auditor of Los Angeles County,
appellant, and the appeal was taken from
a judgment by Superior Judge Shaw to
the effect that Dillon was entitled to pay
for tiie extra days served. The Supreme
Court alii :ined toe judgment of the lower
court.
"Section 221 of the county government
act," says the decision, "requires the Au
ditor to draw his warrant on the first
Monday of the month in which the term
of olHc â¢ expires, yet it may happen that
the lirst Monday in January is the lirst
day of Januarr. and the term of the in
cumbent does not in that case expire until
the second Monday.
"Indeed, under the statute fixing the
commencement and termination of the
terms oi county officers it can never hap
pen that the term consists precisely of
two years, and therefore the provision fix
ing the compensation at an annual sum
should be construed as fixing the rate of
compensation to be paid for the time the
officer actually serves. The judgment
appealed from should be affirmed. "

FRANKFORT, Kt., Feb. 26.â Governor Bradley will recommend the passage of the new corporation law for the purpose of
reaching foreign corporations. Governor Bradley to-day began the preparation of bis message calling an extra session to meet

has bsen seeking to get the Southern Pacific Railroad to comply with the laws of Kentucky in paying the franchise and 'other
taxes, and the law is for the purpose of reaching th is company. Attorney-General Taylor has held several conferences with attorneys
representing the road who have asked that he withhold the suit he has prepared to file against the corporation on the ground that
the Kentucky-born California corporation would settle taxes without suit, and the matter be adjusted out of court. Humphrey and
Dave, attorneys for the road, telegraphed they would be here to-day toadjust matters, but failed to come. The purpose of their de
lay is not known, except it is to delay litigation in the hope that there will be no legislative action in addition to the legal process
Attorney-General Taylor tiled with Governor Bradley a statement requesting the law. The law that will be introduced will give tne
Board of Assessment and Valuation power to annul the charter of thesa corporations that brazenly refuse to comply with tlie
law under technical grounds and will put the Southern Pacific at the mercy of the board. Attorney-General Taylor is very much
in earnest and has prepared his suit, aggregating $250,0C0, and ii will be filed unless the attorneys for the road agree to comply with
the law at once.

MR. RHODES AND
THE TRANSVAAL
Testimony Before the South
African Commission of
the Commons.
The Cape Colony Premier Trie;*
to Justify the Raid of
Jameson.
Declares That President Kruger Was
Preparing to G ye England the
Co d Shoulder.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 26.â The South
African Commission of the House of
Commons appointed to inquire into the
Jameson raid into the Transvaalf resumed
their sittings to-day, and ihe examination
of Cecil Rhodes was continued. A num
ber of members of the House of Commons
and peers were present, but for the first
time since the inquiry began the Prince of
Wales was absent.
Mr. Rhodes admitted that he had in
structed Rutherford Harris, his aceht in
London, to communicate confidentially
the plans of the secret movement to cer
tain persons in En r land, but he refused to
give their names.
Mr. Rhodes was asked whether he re
garded his having a force ready to march
into the Transvaal as consistent with his
position as Premier of the Cape Colony,
and replied that it was for the committee
to juaze his conduct, which did not ap
pear to him to have been inconsistent.
Witness was then asked concerning the
allusion in the statement read by him at
the opening of the inquiry to the intention
of the Boer Government to introduce
foreign influence into the Transvaal. Hon.
Edward Base added that he assumed
lhat Mr. Rhodes had adequate grounds
for the statement.
Mr. Rhodes s.iid thit be bad, but if he
should state his reason for his belief it
might do harm and cause irritation to a
friendly power. Nevertheless, he abso
lutely did believe it.
To a question by Mr. Blake in regard to
the imperial character of tbe proposed
federation of the South Atrican States,
Mr. Rhode* replied : "You must remem
ber that when we federated Canada it was
a local people federated and the imperial
Government finally sanctioned it."
Mr. Blaseâ Do you think that the end
justified the means?
Mr. R odes â It I had succeeded we
should have !ad a union of Africa and the
Chartered Company would have profited
greatly. As I failed 1 must take the re
sponsibility, and I hope that the future
will accomplish the union. I also hope
that the committee in their deliberations
will take into consideration the objects I
had in view.
Mr. Rhodes was then examined by Mr.
Labouchere, who asked him whether Ger
many was the power he bel ; eved to have
been favored by President Krager, which
question the witness answered in the af
firmative. In response to a question ask
in g for evidence in support of his belief
Mr. Rhodes read extracts from a speech de
livered by President Kruger before the Ger
man Club of Pretoria on the occasion of the
birthday of tne Emperor in 1895 in which
the Boer President claimed Great Britain
ha I relinquished her claim of suzerainty
over the Iransvaal, and declared that he
had been able to make a treaty with Ger
many, so that if one nation tried to "lick"
the Transvaal the other nations would try
to stop her. Mr. Rhodes also said that he
had reason lor the belief that President
Kruger intended by this speech to claim
the right to make Mich a treaty and con
firm it without the sanction of the Queen.
'lhe whole tendency of the Transvaal
policy, he added, was in favor of foreign
ers, Gf-rmans especialJy, at the expense of
the English.
Mr. Labouchere â Parbaps President
Krugcr'a speech was an after-dinner ora
tion.
Mr. Rhodesâ President Krugfr drinks
nothing stronger than water.
The witness referred to the objection
raided by the German Minister of Foreign
Affairs in a speech In the Reichstag to a
commercial union ol the South African
States us being likely to lead to a political
protectorate and the exclusion of German
good?, and denied that a policy of protec
tion existed at the Cape. "Protection,"
he said, "means bad faith and bad articles
for the benefit of a privileged few."
Mr. Rhodes further said that in some of
the mines they intended to employ Amer
icans only, becanse of their better ac
quaintance with dee > levels.
To a question by Mr. Labouchere as to
the meaning of the words "civil rights"
as u^ed by Mr. Rhodes that gentleman
answered with much warmth: "The
Johannesburgers have no civil rights and
no body of Englishmen will ever remain
in any place for any period without in
sist nsr upon their civil rights."
Evidence showing the animosity of the
Transvaal toward Cope Colony and
Great Britain was introduced, in the
course of which Mr. Rhodes took from
his Docket and read aloud a long extra* t
lrom a speech in rei-a-d to Crete recently
deliverer in the House of Commons by
Mr. Labouchere. As he finished readme
Mr. Kho :es said: "I quite agree with
Mr. Labouchere and transfers d the same
sentiment-' and state of affairs to the
Transvaal."
Tu Â»s remark created a laugh, in whioh
Mr. Labouchere joined.
Witness said that Mr. Chamberlain, Sec
retary of State for the Colonies, had aoso
lutoly no knowledge whatever of the revo
lutionary movement, and Mr. Chamber
lain said that be would be very glad to
answer any question on (he subject.
The committee adjourned until Tuesday.

â¢ CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 26.â Cabinet spec
ulations Mem to have come to a hah. It
is assumed that Colonel J. J. McCook has
been given an opportunity to accent a
portfolio, but it is not certain that he "will
do so.
In the talk about New York appoint
ments that has appeared in the news
papers from day to day since the election
it seems to have escaped general notice
that Hon. Whitelaw Reid of the New
lork Tribune has always been a great
favorite of the President-elect for some
suitable and conspicuous recognition.
Mr. Reid's selection for a place in the
Cabinet or a foreign embassy at his choice
has been until recently under Major Mc
ivmlev a careful and most cordial con
sideration.
The relations between the two gentle
men have long been Intimate, but Mr.
.Keid and his friends think it would be im
prudent for him to risk the confinement
of official work until his health is abso
lutely restored, and hence have advised
against that course.
Ma P r McKinley within the last fort
night finally and reluctantly gave up the
idea of appointing Mr. Reid and there
upon wrote him a letter expressive both
of ms regret ana appreciation and of
the deep regret that for the present ai
least he could not have the advantage of
his association and co-operation in the
affairs of the administration.
Major McKinley is improving rapidly In
health. He took a long walk to-day and
dm considerable work.

"The report telegraphed from Los An

putting it rather too strongly.
"I believe that San Pedro will bo chosen

menced to formulate its reports."
Judge MuKuire said to-night: "I think
San Pedro will be aelected as the site, but
the report of the commission will not be
made for several weeks yet. I understand
that it will be made to the new Secretary

Ground Against a Recent Order
by the President.
OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 26.â The Com
mercial Club, ai a special meeting to-day,
passed these resolutions, which were im
mediately telegraphed to Washington:
The Commercial Club of the City of Omaha
being interested in the growtn and develop
ment of the trans-Mlsiissippi country, and
particularly the State oi Nebraska, is greatly
alarmed at the promulgation of an executive
order by the President ot the United States by
which 21,000,000 acres of land in the North
west are reserved for exploration, settlement,
mineral development and filine, and railroad
construction. Cf theÃe 21,000 000 acres of
landâ which, added to the 17,000,000 acres of
land heretofore reserved, mates nearly 40.
--000,000 acre* ot the public domainâ 3,ooo.ooo
are in the State of Wyoming and the Black
Hills section of South Dakota, wnicn country
is directly tributary to the State of Nebraska,
and is one of the sections largely supplied by
agricultural products of this State. In view of
the alarming and disastrous results to follow
from this executive order, it is
Sifoivtd, That while in sympathy with any
legitimate effort to protect the lorenu of the
public domain we believe tbat this sweeping
order will have no such result, but by making
the 60-cÂ«l;ed timber country an uninhabited
waste will increase ihe Onager of tne destruc
tion of the fort-sis by fire; and in view of the
fact that large sections of these proposed res
ervations are now settled by agriculturalists
and miners, whose industries must cease il
this executive order shall continue in opera,
lion, Â»c call upon our Senators und Represent
atives in Congress by proper legislation to
annul such order, believing that the present
stringent laws are sufficient ii enforced to
fuily protect timber on the public domain.
The Commercial Club also adopted a
form of pro ten and sent it to Lincoln this
afternoon with the rt- quest tbat the Siate
Legislature adopt it at once.
The business men of Lead, 8. D., held
an indignation meeting last night. similar
to that held at Deadwood. The South Da

Which May Deed: the
Campaign-
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 27.â A special
cablegram to the Herald from Manila
says: Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock
a group of rebels entered the barracks of
the town, killing the lieutenant and ser
geant in the barracks along with the cap
lain of the fort custom-house of Manila
city. They then escaped, taking with
them arms and ammunition.
They ran through the streets of Tondo
pursued by armed police, who fired on
them, the rebels returning the fire.
The rebels escaped clear out of the
suburbs, through Tondo, a quarter where
the alarm was general. The shops and
establishments were closed for fear of
complications.
11l the suburbs of Manila the rebels
were pursued. Many have been made
prisoners or killed.
General La Cbambre captured the town
of Perez dos .Marinas Thursday after eight
hours' hard fighting. The rebels made a
desperate resistance. The losses are enor
mous, and eighty to ninety Spaniards
were killed.
The rebels fled on the entrance of the
Spaniards.
Eoine fortified themselves in the con
vent and this was cannonaded with terrible
carnage. The victory is important as it
brings the forces of General La Chambre
within nine miles of Imus.
All the interest of the campaign centers
in the attrck on Imus. General Polavieja
will attack it from the north and General
La Cbambre from the Â«outh.

Sixty Carload* for IF. P. Fuller & Co.
of San JFyÂ«Â»nÂ«?lÂ»co.
MUNCIE, lud., Feb. 26.â Thomas P.
Hart, manager of the Western Window
glass Manufacturers' Association, with
offices in this city, this evening received
the largest order ever placed for window
plass by one firm in the United States.
It was for sixty carloads to b* sent in
one shipment to W. P. Fuller & Co. of
San Francisco. The glass is for the Pacific
Coast trade. A feature of the order is the
fact that heretofore this firm has imported
all its glass.
To-morrow the head of a big Atlantic
coast firm will be here to place a large
order, which will supplant foreign orders.
Mr. Hart says business prospects in this
line of trade are getting bright, and there
will be no closing down of window-glass
factories this year at least.

Bowles â Is there any prospect of the

Morgan of Alabama Says Cleveland
â¢â¢ Has Been Sleeping Wbile
Americans Suffer.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 26.â The
Sen"aie had the Indian appropriation bill
before it to-day throughout the session.
, bilt. that fact did not prevent Cuba and
the Sanguilly case from being fought over,
even in a more angry and excited manner
th-an it had been yesterday. At the very
opening Frye (R.)of Maine referred to the
dispatch announcing Sanpuilly's reieas-e
to-day, and. deprecated furtner discussion
of./ the matter, saying that for his part he
.did not- believe in wasting powder simply
â  for. tne purpose of making a noise.
, . The 'Sanguilly resolution having been
." sent to the calendar, two otner resolutions
as to victims of Spanish cruelly were
â¢ offered, one by Morgan (D.) of Alabama,
in the caseof George Washington Aguirre, j
â¢and one by Call in relation to the suicide
or murde- of Dr. Ricardo Ruiz. As to
Aguirre, there were Â£on}e comments upon
his baptismal name, Morgan assuming that
it gave to Aguirre an additional claim
upon. American sympathy, and Lindsay
â¢ (D. ) ot Kentucky, insisting that his sur
render, under a proclamation of amnesty,
was an un-George Washington act.
A letter from Ethan Allen of New York,
. vouching for the young man, was read,
and Hoar was led in a jocose mood to in
quire, with *n air of gravity, whether
â¢ that was the Ethan Allen of the Revolu
tion: Morgan said that he was the grand
â  son of the revolutionary hero, and another |
Senator added the information tiiat he j
â¢ v.-as the president of the Cuban Junta of j
New York.
The storm broke out again through the j
Sanguilly matter, and White (D. ) of Cali
fornia and .Lodge (R. ) of Massachusetts
â  had some delicate sparring, in which
White spoke Ironically of Lodge as one of
the great men of the world, and as know
ing. more aDout the Spanish pronunciation
-than ail otner Spanish scholars known.
This was provoked by Lodge's sneering at
WUite for pronouncing "Julio" as
"liuleo."
â  Lodge retaliated by imputing envy to
â¢the California Senator because his long
speech yesterday had not enthused the
galleries.
Hale (R.) of Maine appealed to the
Senators to lay aside all extraneous dis
cu>Mon and confine themselves to the
business of appropriation bills for the six |
remaining days of the session, saying that
he expected the Senate to sit on Sunday.
He was cruelly ridiculed by Morgan
and told that he ought to start out on a
: regular tour of lecturing if he could find a
lot of school children for his audience.
Tne Alabama Senator was in a very un-
, conciliatory mood. He refused angrily
- and with every mark of disrespect to per
. mil either Senators Hoar or Hale to inter
. j'ect a remark into his speech, but he re
served his bitterest words for President
Cleveland, who he described contemptu
ously as having been "down on his |
hunkers" praying Spain to release San- i
guilly; also as a "sluggard sleeping and
â snoring when Americans suffered."
. Morgan was on the floor over an hour, j
Alter he resumed his seat the bitterness
. faded out of the debate. Instead of it
â¢â¢â â¢there was a witty passage between Sena
tors Daniel (D.) of Virginia and Gray (D.)
oi Delaware.
When the former used the Spanish
word "incommunicado" Gray assumed
ignorance of its meaning and said he did
â  not talk Spanish. With a pleasant and
gracious smile Daniel excused himself
â¢ and said that he thought that the Senator
from Delaware had just been talking very
good Spanish.
This polite response, with its unex
pressed but well-understood meaning,
provoked an outburst of laughter on the
&oor and in the gallerie?, which were
.'crowded all tlie ciay.
In" the pleasanter turn which the dis
cussion had thus taken the Cuban ques
tion was permitted to subside and the
actuaf consideration of the Indian appro
priation bill was resumed.
Â°. be bill haci not Deen passed when, at
"6 o'clock, a recess was taken until
7?30 p. m.
Tl>e House bill to prevent trespassing
upon and providing for the protection of
â  National military park" was tbo first mat
ter- taken up in the Senate, and passed
wi-ih an amendment.
Hill (D.) of New York asked unanimous
consent to have an executive Bession at 3
o'clock this afternoon.
â  Frye (R.) of Maineâ l object
. Hillâ l give notice so that no one may
be taken by surprise that at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon 1 will make that motion.
Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania a>ked unan
imous consent to tike up anc i con
sider the substitute for the labor commis
sion bill.
â¢_. Hate (R.) of Maineâ That is a very im
portant matter and will give rise to de
iate. I must object.
At Quay's suggestion the substitute was
read. It provides a commission of live
Senators, live Representatives and nine
others to be appointed by the President
to investigate questions pertaining to im
migration, labor, agriculture, mining and
business, and to report to Congress such
legislation as it may deem best. The total
cost is not to exceed $50,000 a year.
"That is a gigantic scheme," Hale said,
"for building up a great set of officehold
ers at ihe rate of $50,000 a year. I ob
ject."
At 11:15 the Indian appropriation bill
was taken up with the understanding that
at 1 p. m. the Sanguilly Cuban joint reso
lution would come up as the unfinished
business.
The pending question was the commit
tee amendment as to the payment of large
claims for legal services to the old settlers
of the Western Cherokee Indians, to
which Brown (R.) of Utah offered an
amendment to bar and shut out awards
already paid and accepted.
In the course of the discussion it was
stated by Burrows (R.) of Michigan that
the lawyers liad already been paid the
enormous sum of $198,000.
Brown's amendment was acreed to.
Vest (D.) of Missouri moved to strike
out the committee amendment as to that
part of itdireciir.g the commission to set
apart lands upon which any towns are
now located in the Indian Territory, to
provide for the further growth of sucli
town 3 and to allow all other lands in the
Indian Territory belonging to the Chicka
saws, Choctaws, Cherokee*, Creeks and
Seminoles; also to strike out the clause
requiring nets of the Council of either of
those tribes to be submitted fur approval
to the President of the United States.
Vest made a s-tatement as to tne lawless
condition of the Inu.an Territory which
he described as a harbor for criminals.
Tie courtÂ«, he said, were a travesty of
justice. They were eoverned by corrup
tion. Their laws were antagonistic to
American civilization; their modes of
punishment were entirely different, con
sisting of whipping, torturing, and in
cases of capital punishment, the rifle.
"That is an improvement on our mode,"
Frye (R.) of Maine suggested.
Vest went on to say that the treaty con
ditions with those Indians must be dqne
away with. His proposition was not to
rob the Indians nor to molest them, but
to protect them and also to protect the
citizens of the contiguous States. Sena
tors living at a distance had no idea of the
outracres committed on the people of Kan
sas, Missouri. ATkansas and Texas by
j reason of the unfortunate situation now
prevailing in the Indian Territory.
Pettigrew (Silver) of South Dakota, in
I charge of the bill, accepted the first part
of Vest's amendment and it was agreed to.
Pettigrew offered to accept also the lat
ter ] art of Vest's amendment by modify
ing the clause so as to make it read that
the laws of tlie Indian councils shall b iv
force unless disapproved by the President.
A long speech was made by Bale (D.) of
Tennessee en a point oi order which was
made against tbe committee amendment.
Before any disposition of the question was
ciade the presiding officer, Pasco (D.) of
Florida laid before tne Senate the joint
resolution in relation to Julio Sanguujy.
Frye (R. ) of Maine, said a telegram bad
been received, saying that Sanguilly and
his attorney have both acknowledged thai
the judgment was just; that the punish
ment was just ; that they have withdrawn
the appeal; that the Queen Regent bats
signed the pardon and that Sanguilly is
free.
"While I regard that as unfortunate in
many respects," said Frye, "it seems to
me that it leaves this joint resolution with
out any necessity for further considera
tion. Ido not believe and I never did be
lieve in wasting powder simply for tbe pur
pose of making a noise. Ido not believe
that any one will doubt nay friendship for
Cuba.
â¢'Every pulsation of my heart is with
the patriots who are struggling lor liberty
j and is In utter detestation of the brutali
j ties of Spain. But holding as I do that
I condition of mind I do not beiieve that
there is any further necessity for consid
ering this resolution, and l hope that the
Senate will proceed to the consideration of
the Indian appropriation bill."
Lodge (R.)of Massachusetts said that
the Sanguiliy case could not be disposed
of by sneers. There were many cases
which had been suppressed. So far as the
committee was concerned, he desired to
say that it had received no information of
Sanguilly's pardon. The case had been
considered by the committee for more
than a month, and had beer postponed
from time to time at the request of the
State Department on the ground tnat
Spain had promised to pardon the man.
Finally the committee reported the reso
lution, and it was debated by the StUate.
The next morning the cable announced
that Sariguilly cad been pardoned. The
action of the Senate did it, and the com
mittee is sneered at for its efforts.
Call (D. ) of Florida offered a resolution
and asked immediate consideration and
passage, calling on the President to send
to the Senate all correspondence relating
to the imprisonment and death in Cuba
of Dr. Ruiz, an American citizen, and lo
state what effort, if any, had been made
to obtain further information on tbe sub
ject.
White (D.) of California objected to its
consideration.
Hale (R.) of Maine urged that the ap
propriation bills be proceeded with and
dsclared with some sarcasm that tbe
"moot court" was over.
Senator Morgan informed Hale that if
be proposed to begin a lecturing tour he
would find that he did not have a lot of
school children for his audience. Tbe
Senator from Maine served notice yes
terday, he said, that the Sanguilly resolu
tion could not pass, after the Senate by a
large majority had displaced the appro
priation bill with it.
Hale interposed an objection to the con
struction Morgan placed upon his remarks
and said that what he meant was that
such a resolution could not be expected to
pass without reasonable debate.
"Oh! It makes little difference what
the Senator now says," retorted Morgan.
"We all knew what he meant. He meant
that it should not pas* at all, if be could
help it. The Senator from California iook
the floor during the afternoon and made a
long constitutional speech, not on tbe
merits of the resolution at all, but for tho
purpose of staving off action until some
thing happened. Now that something
has happened. And how are we informed
of it? Through the press. We have noth
ine from the President to show that San
guilly has been pardoned. We are left
altogether in Ihe dark.
"The relations between the Preaident.'and
the Congress and the American peopie on
this Cuban question are so strained that
we are unable to get any information out
of him. Ido not wonder that the Presi
dent prefers the darkness to the light."
Every citizen, Morgan said, who held
naturalization papers and bore a Spanish
name who had been arrested in Cuba â
and few escapedâ had been discriminated
against by the Spanish authorities.
With pointed emphasis Morgan said the
friends of Cub.i, when they began to dis
cuss this question, knew that Spain had
not only apologists but direct advocates
on the floor of the Senate, but that made
none the less peremptory the oblipation
for them to do their duty. Referring to
the cabled dispatch that pardon bad been
extended to Sanguilly he asked what had
brought that about. Answering, he said
it was because the Queen of Spain â for
whom he had a great respect â could not
stand the exposure. If she could have
sustained by any law of humanity or
otherwise the action of her officers in
Cuba, would she not nave felt it her duty
to stand by them?
"But," said Morgan, with bitter sar
casm, "thiiiK what joy this result must
bring to that statesman in tbe White
House, who for two years has been down
on his 'hunkers' praying for Sanguillv's
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1897.
release and now finds it brought about by
other means.
'â¢The President," Senator Morgan
added, "escapes two duties, one to his
country and another to his manhood. I
am willing he may escape both. I am
willing that Sanguilly shall be thus im
molated. But I wash my hands of it
here, in the presence of the Senate of the
United States. I am not guilty, tnanK
God, of that."
Call read a dispatch from the New York
Herald of to-day to the effect that Consul-
General Lee had called upon Secretary
Olney for a warship, inquired whether
there was American j-hips of war ready to
be sent to Havana, and had declared that
he would not stand another Ruiz murder.
He was asked by Morgan whether he
thought the didpatch was authentic, and
he said he thought it just as authentic as
the dispatch announcing the pardon of
Saneuilly.
Gray read a press dispatch saying that
Secretary Olney had received a cablegram
to-day from Consul-General Lee stating
that Sanguilly had been released. "That,"
said Gray, "was the end we had in view.
So much has been accomplished by and
through the Secretary of State, who
throughout all this aad business ha* never
failed to assert the power and dignity of
his coumry in behalf of these Spanish-
American citizens."
Daniel (D.) of Virginiaâ We can say at
least that the joint resolution introduced
the day before yesterday has not delayed
the release of Saneuilly. [Laughter.]
Hill (D.) of New York moved the con
sideration of executive business. The mo
tion was rejected and the consideration ot
the Indian appropriation bill was pro
ceeded with. No progress was made.
The fortification appropriation bill was
reported and placed o:i the calendar, and
at 6 p. m. the Senate took a recess until
7:30 r. m.
The lirst twenty minutes of the evening
session were devoted to private pension
bills.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
House to return the Senate bill donating
to the Daughters of the American Revo
lution a site in the Washington monu
ment grounds for the erection of a memo
rial museum.
Consideration of the Indian appropria
tion bill was then resumed â the question
being on an amendment to substitute
United States courts for Indian courts in
Indian Territory.
Teller (silver) of Colorado, and Hoar
(R.) of Massachusetts favored the amend
ment on the eround that tbe Indian
courts were corrupt.
The amendment was a creed to. The
Indian appropriation bill was then passed
and tbe postofflce appropriation bill
taken up. It was laid aside, however, and
the II iuse bill passed authorizing tne
Territories to fund their indebtedness at
a lower rate of interest.
Quay (It.) of Pennsylvania gave notice
that to-morrow he wou!d call up the bill
to forbid the sale of liquor in the Capitol,
and Hill gave notice (sotto voce) that he
would oppose it.
At 11:40 the Senate adjourned until to
morrow.
IT IS 1131 E TO CALL A HALT.
Scandalous Per*onal attack on Lee by a
spa nt Official.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 26.â A Herald
special from Havana via Key West says:
The Marquis de Palmerola made a scanda
lous personal attack on General Lee
Wednesday night in the Palace in the
presence of several American newspaper
correspondents.
The incident arose because the censor
refused to pass a dispatch for the cor
respondents which said that the release of
Scott had been demanded because he was
both arrested and Kept in prison in de
fiance of the law.
"Who told you that?" shouted General
Palmerola, the Secretary of State for the
island.
"General Lee," replied a correspondent
calmly.
"General Lee in a liar, imposter and
rebel," sbouted the little Marquis, with
an oath.
General Lee is of course too busily en
gaged in protecting the lives and property
of our fellow-citizens to pay any attention
to Palmerola' s outbreak.
The situation is still the same as de
scribed to you on Wednesday.
General L?e leaves Havana at tbe mo
ment when be is satisfied that tbe Gov
ernment at Washington will not do its
whole duty in preventing the occurrence
of another Ruiz murder.
The investigation promised by the Span
ish Government into the manner in which
Ruiz came to his death has been begun,
but with closed doors and apparently
without the slightest attempt to preserve
even an outward appearance of sham legal
procedure.
A young lady, a member of one of the
many distinguished French families who
have plantations near Santiago de Cuba,
has been arrested and thrown into the
Casa de Recojas, or prison for disorderly
women, in that place.
The charge against her is that she was
making lint to dress the wounds of the
insurgents. Tne papers in the case are
now in the hands of the acting French
Consul-General here, and it is expected
that energetic action will be authorized
from Paris. The French colony and mer
chants are very indignant and demand
immediate action on the part of their
country. They ask that Count Sala, the
Consul-General, now in Paris, return im
mediately to his post, as the acting Con
sul-General, they say, is not protecting
French interests.
Fondevilla's column returned on
Thursday night to Guanabacoa. It Lad
had a fight that morning with Arango and
Aranguern and lost fifty out of 200 men.
The .troops had a fight with a local party
on Wednesday one mile out of Santa Clara
city. Fifty Spanish guerillas and bom
beros were killed. Many Spanish prisoners
were taken but afterward liberated.
Information has been received here
from Sancti Spiritus to the effect that
General Weyler visited the jail there on
Monday last, and was very much dis
pleased with the conditions found. In
that jail Sylyester Scovel, an American
newspaper correspondent, is confine. i.
General Weyler immediately ordered a
change of the warden and dismissed all
of the attendants who had been kind to the
correspondent. The bed has been removed
from bis cell.
AVERT FURTHER FRICTION.
Cleveland and Dine;/ Shew Their Friend
â¢ /tip for Spain.
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. Â£6.â lt is under
stood here that Secretary Olney, as fur
ther evidence of his and President Cleve
land's friendship for Spain, has instructed
Consui-General Lee to act with caution in
bis dealings with the Spanish authorities
and to spare no effort to avert further
friction with them. By Spaniards here
this is given to mean that General Lee, to
meet the approbation of bis superiors in
ottice, must not be as persistent as he has
been heretof re in pressing fora recogni
tion of the rights of American citizens.
It is rumored that the reason why Gene
ral Lee still holds ; his post is that he has
been induced to do so by private in tima
tions from a high Republican that he will
be supported by the incoming Republican
administration in upholding American
rights and honor.
Julio Sanguilly, the American citizen
who was twice sentenced to imprisonment
for life on the charge of beine a rebel, was
released this afternoon, the Queen Regent
having pardoned him.
He at once left the Cabanas Fortress,
where he bad been confined awaiting the
result of his appeal against his sentence,
and started for home. He was naturally
highly elated at being at liberty again
after being confined for over two years,
and he was so anxious to get to his fam
ily that he did not have time to talk about
his experiences. He will leave to-morrow
for the. United States with his family,
traveling by way of Tampa. It is re
ported that lie has promised never to re
turn to Cubu.
STOPPED HI THE VESUVIUS.
The Tug Vauntltt* A ot. Permitted, to De

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Feb. 26.â The
tag Dauntless bad a little tilt with the
cruiser Vesuvius to-day. She tried to
leave the river, when lour blasts from t 1 c
Vesuvius' big whistle were beard. The
tug did not obey and a second and third
were blown. Seeing other preparations
made to stop her by force, the "tug yielded
and came into dock again. It is believed
that this was done to make a case against
the Government for damages stronger, al
leging illegal detention.
It is reported to-night that the cruiser
Indiana is at the bar and will go south in
the morning. Her destination is unknown,
but her presencs here has aroused much
comment on account of the Cuban situa
tion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 26.-The
alleged filibustering steamer Dauntless, in
whose behalf suit was filed yesterday
against the Collector ol Customs at Jack

to accept the condition-* offered by the
Treasury Department for her departure
from the port, and as a result wat ot per

LINCOLN, Nebr., Feb. 2G.â In the State
Senate to-day Caldwellof Nichols County
offered the following resolution:
Whereas, We are reliably Informed by dis
patches through the public press from Cuba
that the flag of this country is daily being dig
honored in the streets of Havana, that Amerl
cans arc not only being hissed along the thor
oughfares of the city, but are being robbed
and Imprisoned and murdered by the Span
iards, and indignities are heaped on Ameri
can women there, and every atrocity conceiv
able lor a Spaniard to visit on Americana Is
being thrust upon them; therefore, be it
Rctolvtd, By the Senate of the State of Ne
braska, that we regard such treatment as bar
barous in the extreme and inimical to the
spirit that should be shown by one civilized
Government to another, and that longer si
lence or inaction on behalf of the United mates
would be a dishonor to the dignity and loyalty
of the Nation; that we resent and disapprove
the attitude and policy of the present admin
istration in Its unpatriotic treatment of these
outrages dally committed by Spain against our
National honor; and that we commend the
action of Consul-General Lee In resigning his
consulship rather lhau obey the instructions
of the State Department in its unpatriotic, un-
American policy in America.
It was introduced as a party measure,
being signed by the seven Republican
Senators, but was adopted by an almost
unanimous vote, but one Senator oppos
ing it. _ .
M /. } l.t:i.s cm sir. nay FAILED.
General Rivera Say Bit Effort* Were
Itidicutout.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 25.â A letter
dated Rio Hondo, Cuba, January 11, has
been received by T. Estrada Palma, presi
dent of the Cuban Junta in this city, from
General Rivera, who has taken the place
of General Maceo in the patriot army.
General Rivera, after lamenting the death
of Maceo, says:
"General Weyler's campaign in Pinar
del Rio wasa ridiculous failure. We knew
that the campaign was decidedly in our
favor sooner and easier than wo expected.
The balance ot Weyler's forces, after try
ing once or twice to take our positions on
the hills without success, employed them
selves in burning the lowlands to the right
and left of the railroads and tbe houses
occupied by the pacincos."
LIVE MEN ARE AT WORK.
Marin Developmeci Association
Organizing a Committee
of Fifty.
The Obj ct Is to Sicnre C:-Opjra
tioa for the B?aut:fication of
Marin County
The Marin Development Association
has been actively at work for the last few
days organizing a committee of fifty to
constitute a committee ui>on projects of
public development in Marin County. A
commission, consisting of Morris Schwartz
secretary of the California Association,
and B. Allen Brown, secretary of the
Marin Association, is in charge of the
organization of this committee ana has
met with much encouraging success as a
result of the first few days' work. The
following have agreed to act upon tbe
same:
Dr. L. L. Dun bar, Sydney V. Smith, James E
Walsh, General R. H. Warfield, J. \V. Dorsey,
J. W. Wright, William Corbin, Edgar M. Wil
son, Edgar C. Chapman, W. I. Pixley, J. D.
Maxweh, J. H. Pryor. S. F. Bamow. Louis L.
Janes, E. Steele, ft. A. Boole, C. A. Harmon, W.
J. Thomas, Thomas H. Fotrell, C. J. Dowd,
Commodore C. H. Harrison.
Secretary Schwartz says that the object
of the formation of this committee is 10
assist in the promotion of a boulevard, be
ginning at Sausalito and Belvedere and
running to San Rafael, then branching
out into other parts of the county, in
other words establishing a road system
covering the whole county by the im
provement of present roadways and the
creating of new ones as may be neces
sary.
"We look upon this work," he said, "as
being essential to the carrying out of
projects for the development of Marin
County. It is expected to take up im
mediately the work of improving and
beautifying Marin County and the resi
dence districts not only in the matter of
roads but in other public utilities and
conveniences as fast as they can be got to.
We are very well pleased with the suc
cess with which our proposition has been
received, as already a considerable num
ber of the most Influential ratn in the
rounty have been secured to act upon it.
We hope by the creation of a botiv like
this 10 get much more intelligent and con
certed action than we would otherwise be
able to, even by a meeting of the members
of tbe association. The character and
standing of tho men who have taken bold
are sue i as place the thin.: in excellent
condition. 'â 
Tbe meeting of this committee will be
held some time next week at which it will
be formally organized and placed in worn
ing order.
THE WRIT RAN ASTRAY.
Sup3rior Court Judges Would
Not Sit in Bank to
Hear It
Attorney Critfenden's Vaia Attempt
to Gather Together a GaUxy
cf Justices.
Attorney James Crittenden appeared in
Judge Hebbard's court and asxed for a
further postponement of the habeas corpus
case wherein he was sentenced to jail for
contempt of court.
Judge Hebbard said he had already
granted all the delay that was right. He
deemed that he had exhausted his disore
tionary powers and that the matter must
1 be heard, according to the previous order
of the court, at 10 o'clock this morning.
Mr. Crittenden replied that lie would
not be ready to proceed at that time; that
be had been attempting to get all the Su
perior Judges to sit in bank for the pur
pose of hearing the argument in this case,
but be had not yet been able to make the
arrangement.
To this Judge Hebbard responded that
of Mr. Crittenden is not prepared to take
up the matter he would dismiss the writ
and remand the petition, but if he wished,
would at once grant another writ, returna
ble before Presiding Judge Seawell. As
for himself, Judae Hebbard said he was
not willing to let the matter drag along in
his department any longer.
Mr. tritiendsn gave notice that he would
object to such proceeding, but the court
reiused to reconsider the determination
already announced.
When Judge Slack ordered the im
prisonment of Attorney Crittenden for
contempt because he appears l in court in
the Ashley- Baldwin seduction case with
a loaded six-shooting revolver in his hip
pocket, Mr. Crittenden applied to Judge
Hebbard ior a writ of habeas corpus. His
Honor granted the writ and made it re
turnable before all the Judges of the Su
perior Court "sitting in bank."
This provision by Judge Hebbard for
submitting the question to all the Judges
"sitting in bank," is by his compeers
gently spoken of as "an inconsiderate
act," for the reason that the Superior
Court never sits in bank.
At the annual meeting of the Judges on
the first Monday of January Judge Heb
bard broached the subject and asked his
colleagues to ascend the bencn with him
for the purpose of reviewing Judge Slack's
action.
Judge Wallace was the first to object.
He said that the act of one Judge of the
Superior Court in committing a man for
contempt done in the presence of the
court ought to be regarded as the act of
the court, ana that he tnought the person
who considered himself injured should be
invited to apply to the Supreme Court for
any relief to which he deemed himseif en
titled.
Now Judge Hebbard is impelled to dis
miss the writ, remand the petitioner and
let him proceed further as he may bÂ« ad
vised.
BLUE VS. EED EOOK.
The Stwrt Committee Xa Asked to
Abolish the Kattler Test.
The Street Committee sought enlight
enment last night on the subject of the
respective merits of blue and red rock for
maca amizinir and concrete purposes, as
advocated by contractors and quarrv
owners interested in one or the other.
The advocates of red rocfc also urged the
abolition of the Rattler test, while the ad
vocates of blue rock were equally deter
mined in their support of its retention.
The Joirner argued that the Rattler test
is altogether inconclusive and unsatisfac
tory and that whereas it is admittedly the
case that red rock is frequently con
demned when subjected thereto, a material
like soapstone will pays through it un
scathed. The red rock party freely as
serted that the blue rock gentlemen con
stituted a monopolistic combination, and
the biue rock gentlemen assured the
committee that their only desire was to
promote the cause of good road construc
tion.
The committee listened to the discus
sion for three hours, and will subse
quently report its conclusions to the
board.
The principal speakers on behalf of red
rock, and who advised the abolition of the
Rattler tÂ«st, were J. C. Heggerty, J. B.
Crocker, Joseph Scheerer, Diggins and P.
H. Goessel, who were opposed by Mr.
Lukens. Â£. AicCullougb, George and
Harry Gray, D. Sullivan, Wetmore and C.
A. Warren.
The committee adjourned after further
discussion.
Deprived of His Klghts.
The Supreme Court has overruled the de
ciÂ«ion of the lower court and ordered a new
trial in the case of Joseph M. A. Fournier, a
saloon-keeper, who was convicted of arson in
Madera. There was $600 insurance on the
man's saloon, which burned to the ground
ju^t before he wns to depart for France. At
the trial Fournier tried to explain why he had
removed a cask of wine snd a cask of brandy,
and he wanted to introduce witnesses to prove
that he was about to sell the saloon for more
than the amount of the insurance. Both priv
ileges were denied by the lower court. The
Supreme Court held that this waa not giving
the accused a fair chance to prove his inno
cence of the charge and it made the foregoing
order.
MR. FRANCISCO GARCIA.
TTEN'TURA (CAL.). MR. GARCIA IS ONE OP
Â» the finest looking men within Â» day's walk
of Ventura. He is able to hold nis own with
all the young men of this place. When I was
introduced to him! remarked his strength,
and he told me it waa only a while ago when
he was out of sorts, all rim down, no appetite
and troubled with sleeplessness. He was ad-
v sed to and aid use Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla. He told me exactly what hundreds have
before said. He soon began to sleep at night,
his bowels bacame regular, his appetite re-
turned, and he was enabled to do a good day's
work, cut a fair share of iood and sleep his
allotted hours. Now he weighs 180 pounds,
and in all his movements shows the perfectly
healthy man. Speaking of Joy's Vegotable
Sarsapariiia, he said: "I did not use the
remedy until I had been advised to do so, and
then I did not put much faith in it, but now I
can safely say that Joy's Vegetable Sprsapa-
rlllft is a greÂ»t remedy, an-1 thÂ«t it clarifies the
biood, leaving no bid effects oi the entire
body. I never had a sing c pimple or blemish
on my face; I never had the least disagreeable
feeling whito I used Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla. Of course I was not astck man, yet I
felt out of sorts and was beginning to lose
flesh. Yes, I do recommen t Joy'i Vegetab c
Sarsaparilla." HENRY" TILLMAN.
No druggist owns stock in Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilia. Any druggist claiming
to Day its advertising bills is a fraud.
Don't let the drug clerk talk you into
buying somotning else for Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. He laughs at you when
you leave the corner store with, a substi-
tute. Watch biro..

There is to be no investigation by the
State Senate of the coyote-scalp claims.
It seems there are too many of them, and
.Jhe q'dor is not enticing.
â¢ We bee to remind the legislators that in
Addition to the people of the State whb
wish appropriations there are others, and
the others are taxpayers.
The" Turkish Government has been vir
tually eliminated from the politics of
Europe, but the Turk himself remains
and may make trouble yet.
The appropriations proposed by the
Legislature are in full accord wltn gen
erosity, but they could be pruned with an
Â£i without hurting justice any.
The fact that tbe Senate shoved an ap
propriation bill aside in order to discuss
the Cuban question shows that this is not
such an economic age after all as some
people thin* it is.
The policy of Salisbury to grant eu
tonqmy to Crete, but compel her to re
main a part of tbe Turkish empire, is
clearly designed to throw the patient into
fits in order to cure her later on.
As King George replies to the demands
of the powers that he will not recall bis
troops from Crete, but having taken the
sword will stay with it, it is evident he
has either a secret backing or a very visi
ble backbone.
Secretary Morton has found a friend at

The approval, however, seems to com* not

"I am opposed to wrong, violence and
tyranny wherever they are exercised, and

so will net Secretary Sherman when he
enters the State office.
The suggestion of Mr. Irish that our
delegation in Congress should work for
an increase of the appropriation avail
able for the beginning of the construction
of the Federal building in this City is a
good one. As Mr. Irish says, the money
has to come some time, and nothing is
gained by issuing it in comparatively
tniall sums
A number of experts have been exam
ined by a leeisJative committee in Massa
chusetts with regard to preventing danger
from the use of water gas, and one and ali
of them declared the best means would
be to turn the gas off at the place where
it is made, and keep it turned off. The
remedy, it is admitted, would be efficient,
but somehow it is not regarded as satis
factory.
Some of the leading papers in the East
assert that the investigation of trusts now
going on before the New York Legislature
is not being made with any intention to
eet the facts, or to remedy the evil of
Â»uch combinations, but to make a grand
stand play before the people and at tbe
same time give the trusts a chance to
make public a mass of testimony in their
favor. That is the kind of treatment a
reformer gets in the world. Whoever
makes a fight is always accused of mak
ing it in the wrong way.
PUSHING THE WORK.
The movement undertaken by The Call to brine about a speedy beginning of the
work of constructing the new Federal building in this City goes forward with com
mendable vigor. It baa been promptly supported by tbe commercial and industrial
associations of the City and has found favor with the people generally. It is reason
able, therefore, to expect good results. We may yet see the ground broken and the
work becun before the coming spring gives wn3 r to summer.
One of the encouraging features of the situation is that there is no apparent
obstacle of any magnitude in tbe way of success. From all that can belearned.it
seems the delay in the construction of the building has been due solely to a deter
mination on tbe part of the present administration not to undertake it. This opinion,
clearly stated by Congressman Maguire, is shored by every member of the California
delegation at Washington, if this is so the obstacle which has interposed in the past
will be removed on March 4. We shall then have a new administration and a hew
method of doing public business. We have been balked by Cleveland, but we will be
helped by McKinley.
It will not do for us, however, to trust everything to the incoming administration.
It must be borne in mind the newly appointed oilicials will have a thousand things
to claim their attention and in the rush of the new worK they have undertaken the
claims of San Francisco will in all probability be overlooked if tuey are not persist
ently urged by our Representatives in Congress. We must, therefore, be diligent oar
selves if we hope to attain an early beginning of the work on the new building. If
we are indifferent others will be indifferent. There will be no decided movement in
Washington until there has been aroused here a sufficient energy to set it going.
In an interview published in Tjje Call yesterday, John P. Irish made a sueges
tion of prime importance to the issue in saying. "The first thing that is necessary to
the construction of the now building is for Congress to pass an act increasing the
available appropriation." It would be well to have this suggestion acted on as lar as
possible. As Mr. Irish says: "It is not a wise policy to start work on a building
whicb is to cost several millions of dollars with only a comparatively email sum of
available money." If it is possible for us to obtain the proposed appropriation, it
would certainly be expedient to do so, and at any rate the advantage which would be
derived from such an increased appropriation is worth working for, even, if the effort
to obtain it should be something of a forlorn hope.
While we strive for the appropriation suggested by Mr. Irish, we should not, how
ever, overlook the fact that the chief Doint at i sue is to get the work started. It is
known that the new administration will be inclined to do everything in its power to
promote an immediate revival of industrial activity in all parts of the country.
Every official will be predisposed to a prompt beginning of every work of public im
provement for which there is any available money in the treasury. This fact will be
of great help to us in our efforts to attain tne beginning of the work before spring is
over. We ought to profit by this friendly disposition on the part of the incoming
Government and urge our claims in such a way that they will be speedily attended to.
The earnestness with which the commercial ana industrial associations of this
City have entered into tbe movement to obtain the much-desired construction of tbe
proposed building is in the highest degree commendable. Their activity will be a
potent aid to our delegation in Congress in achieving success. They speak for the
whole people of San Francisco, and do something more than speaic. They give
actual aid and help to the movement and will be among the strongest influences in
bringing about the result for which the people have so long waited.
With an administration favorable to our claims, with a Congressional delegation
roused to new activity in urging them, with the commercial and industrial associa
tions of the City combined to work for them and with the whole people awakened to
a new resolve to succeed, we may fairly look forward to a successful accoruDlishmeut
of our desires. Let the agitation be kept up and it will go hard with us if we do not
see the ground broken and tbe work on the new building begun and fairly under way
in a comparatively short time.
THE FAIR ESTATE.
It is about time that the washing of the dirty linen of the late James G. Fair
should be completed and the soiled remnent ot his estate removed from public view.
From tbe time of the demise of that bard-headed and hard-banded member of the
famous coterie of Bonanza millionaires until the present his wills, his heirs, his
attorneys and the claimants of specific portions of his estate have engrossed
the attention and clogged the calendars of the civil and criminal courts of San
Francisco with a series of gyrations which have increasingly bewildered the public
mind. For more than two years this absorption of our judicial system has continued
and in the interest of less wealthy but more scrupulous litigants it should be allowed
to continue no longer. The public have some rights in the premises which the
squabbling claimants to the estate should be compelled to respect.
It was apparently not enough that the Probate Court should have been made dor
ing the past fwo years the scene of a comic opera performance over the issue as to
which really was the last will and testament ot the dead millionaire, in the progress
of which neither dramatic similies nor legal consistencies were observed by his attor
neys and heirs, and throughout which they were on this side and that of the question
as their interests seemed to from time to time bÂ«Â«. It was not enough that
the civil branch of the Superior Court should havj been invoked
to determine the issue as to the validity of the Craven deeds.
It was not even enough that month after month should pass in skirmishes prepara
tory to tbe civil trial, which when finally reached would apparently settle every one
nf the controversies which have arisen over the wills and deeds of Senator fair.
After ali this exhausting of the time and patience of the civil tribunals and of the
public, whose business they should dispatch, and after the respective litigants with
their numerous counsel have been drawn up in battle array, our criminal courts
and processes are suddenly and strangely drawn into the controversy and in
their turn become the clothes-line for the Fair estate. The Police Department of San
Francisco, which for nearly two years stood by the ringside an inactive witness of a
variety of most peculiar legal antics on the part of the princ.pal aspirants for a parti
tion of the Fair minions, was all at once aroused to the urgent necessity of its participa
tion therein. For the past several months its chief detective bureau has been devoted
in the most activeâ not to say obsequiousâ service of the moneyed side of the litigation
The recent indications are that not only the criminal department of the Superior
Court but even the Grand Jury itself is to be involved in inquiries which ought to
have been tiied and determined in the civil courts a year or more ago.
It would seem to be nearly time for public patience to protest in this matter
against the wasteful and unreasonable appropriation of its judicial system by the Fair
estate. It is now quite well understood that the civil case which directly puts in
issue the genuineness of the Craven deeds and incidentally the pencil will is ready
for trial, and it appears that the claimant and her counsel are only too anxious to
proceed. Why not concentrate the whole case in a single court
and dispose of it there? Why drag the Grand jury away
from its other and in fact more important public business to the assistance of either
side of the civil controversy ? Why involve the detective service of San Francisco in
this matter when it could be so much more proritably engaged (at least from a public
point of view) in seeking out the uncaught criminals of our City? Why clog the
already congested calendars of our criminal courts with tbis or that phase of this
matter when every phase of it is ready for trial in the civil department*? Why is it
that the Fair estate and those who represent it are outdoing Fabius in
expedients for delaying tho very case which would speedily determine every issue
affecting the ownership of property, while they are openly involving almost every
other department of the local judicial system in issues which can only embarrass and
prolong the litigation?
The general public who have business with our courts and who pay taxes for their
maintenance have some rights in the premises and are entitled to demand that a
speedy end be put of their appropriation to tne selfish and tortuous purposes oi those
who are interested in the Fair estate.
STATE APPROPRIATIONS.
The detailed report given in The Call
yesterday of the various amounts the Leg
islature may be called upon to appropri
ate for all purposes at this session serves
to direct public attention once more to the
danger of an excessive taxation for the
next two fiscal years. According to this
review the summary of proposed appro
priations is a* follows:
General appropriation bi11......... 94,815,776
School fund â¢ -. 4,029 9^o

Total â¢â¢â¢ .' $10,000/794
As there is about $750,000 remaining in
the treasury there would have to be raised
by taxation if all these appropriations* are
adopted a sura in excess of $15,230,000. As
the total assessed valuation of the property
of the State is estimated at $1,200,000,000
such appropriations would entail an an
nual tax levy of 63 cents on the $100. This
sum. it goes without saying, is larger than
the people are willing to pay. It behooves
the. Legislature, therefore, to make active
use of the pruning knife on the proposed
appropriation bills and reduce them con
siderably below the figures given.
There is every reason to believe the
leaders of botc houses thoroughly under
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1897.
stand the importance of economy at this
time and will see to it that tbe desired re
ductions are made. It is said the tax levy
bill will be the last measure acted upon
hy the Legislature and that members of
the Finance Committees are of the opinion
appropriations may be so arranged that it
will not be necessary to call for more than
a 50-cent levy. This report is encouraging,
but the people snould not trust wholly to
| it. From every section of the State there
| should go up protests against tbe heavy
j appropriations proposed and a demand
I for strict economy.
THE CAUBE OF CUBA.
The committee appointed by Mayor
l'lielan to co-operate with similar com
mittees in other cities lo advance the
cause of Cuban independence iÂ» now fully
organized and ready lo begin its work. It
is the intention of the committee to call a
niass-meetintf at an early date, in order to
Â«ive expression to the sentiments of the
people and to make manifest the Jact that
San Francisco stands in this issuÂ«> along
side her sister cities in supporting a cause
which is truly American not only in geog
raphy but in principle.
At the meeting of the committee last
night there was displayed a spirit of earn
est devotion lo the wort. All who were
present signified a willingness to actively
aid the movement, and to Rive it every
assistance in tneir power. Tbere can be
no doubt that a similar spirit exists
among the people at large. San Francisco
will not fall behind the front rank of
American communities in a movement of
this kind. The voioe of her people will
be as clear as any that ia uttered in any
portion of the Union, and their help will
be as vigorous and as promptly given.
There can be no question of the timeli
ness of this movement. Events now oc
curring in Cuba directly affect the people
of the United States. The Senate finds
the issue the most important and the most
argent that confronts it. Party lines are
obliterated. Republicans and Democrats
vie with one another in devising means to
compel the administration to take steps to
protect Americans in Cuoa from Spanish
violence, and everything tends to show
that the crisis is one in which there should
be a thorough unanimity among the
people.
It is unnecessary to go over the situa
tion. Every citizen who takes an intelli
gent interest in the affairs of hi 9 country
is aware of it. American citizens in Cuba
have been insulted, plundered, impris
oned and in some cases murdered. An
aDathetic administration sits sullenly idle
and permits these wrongs to go unpun
ished and almost unrebuked. The Senate
has called upon the executive in vain.
As if to show his contempt of Congress
and of the people the President rsfuses to
take any action whatever to protect either
the lives of his fellow-citizens in the hands
of the Spaniards or to maintain the pres
tige of tbe Nation.
It is time the voice of the people should
make itself heard. It is time that elo
quent orators should come forth to ex
press the sentiments shared by all true
Americans. It is time that in every city
in the Union there should be mass-meet
ings. It is time that organized efforts
should be put forward to uphold the
right and crush the wrong. Tue cause of
Cuba is the oause of America. No citizen
should hesitate to sapport it. No patriot
should delay to uphold it.

HYPNOT ZING A GOVERNOR
St. rani Pioneer Press-
Two Detroit physicians have asserted posi
tively, tt a meeting of members of their pro

Governor Rich of Michigan to prevent his
signing a bib affecting medical practice two

notist went to Lansing, got nth work in on the
Governor and so the bill failed to receive the

to get almost any bill through tne Legislature

OUR VICE-PRESIDENTS.
Much is said about the coming inaugura
tion of President McKinley, but very little
about the inauguration of his associate on the
presidential ticket, Garret A. Hobsrt, writes
Major Handy in the Chicago Times -Herald.
That is the luck of Vlce-Presldents. It takes a
man oi real force and ability to maintain him
self in the Vice-Presidency, and a man of Mr.
Hobart's modesty is very apt io be lost in the
shuffle even before the deal begins.
(iarret A. Hobart will be the twenty-fourth
Vice-President of the United States. The list
of his predecessors embraces more men of dis
tinction than the man who does not carry his
American history in his head is apt to think.
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr,
John C. Calhoun, Martin Van Buren,
John C. Breckinridee, Chester A. Arthur
mid Levi P. Morton were among the
best. Eight, or one-third of the whole
number, hailed from New York. Mrssachu
si'tts has contributed three. Adajns, Gerry and
Wilson; Virginia two, JeffVrson and Tyler;
Kentucky two, Johnson and Breckinridge"; In-'
diana two, and Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Alnbamn, Maine, Tennessee and Illinois one
each. The New Yorkers besides Burr, Vun
Buren, Arthur and Morion, were Clinton, Fill
more, Ihompkins and Wheeler. There have
been sixty-three presidents pro tempore of the
Senate, aud it is a remnrknble fact that the
grade of men vrho have filled this position in
the last quarter of a century is even higher
than It was in the earlier years of the Repub
lic. Wade, Carpenter, Thurman, Bayard,
Davis, Edmunds, Sherman and lugalls take
rank in nbility higher thanaimostanyof their
predecessors.
lv many respects the most capable and ver
satile of Vic.e-Presirtents was one who after
ward fell from his high estate aDd Is known to
the public of the present day chit-fly as a
traitor. I mean, of course, Aaron Burr. When
he last took the vice-presidential chair he
had but recently incurrod opprobrium and
was a fugitive from justice as the slayer of
Alexander Hamilton. The lew months imme
diately before he took hii seat were parsed in
hiding, dodging a :nal for murder. But he
presided with so much grace, dignity and ini
partiaiitr thai he commanded the admiration
ot tne Senate. When he tool: his leave
In made a speech which will ever live
as a model. He moved his hearers
to tears and was the recipient of a
resolution of thanks, which was anything
but perfunctory. It was said of him that he
presided with the impartiality of an angel
and the rigor of a devil. Perhaps he mignt
have regained hts popularity before the peo
ple if he haa after his retirement not entered
into the Blennerhas-ett conspiracy, which
was believed and partly proved to have in
volved a plan for disunion and certainly
meant foreign conquest at tho expense o( tue
peace and good name of tne United States.
Thenceforward he was a man without a coun
try, and there is no story more pathetic than
that of his wanderings in Europe, making
occasional social conquests, but oitener cool
ing his heels in the ante-chambers of royalty,
dogged by the police an<l suDsisting on food
that in other days he would have been
ashamed to give his negro servants, to whom
he wns a modul master.
Calhoun was another great Vice-President,
but by no means tue equul of Burr in fitness |
far ttjai particular position. He resigned the
ifl'n c to take a senatorshiD. He never mag
nified the Vice-Presidential office, and with all
ins pride and mien seemed to consider the
Vice-President as the representative of the
Federal authority ot less importance than the
individual Senator who was the accredited
representative of.a sovereign State. When on
the floor Â«< Senator he never addressed the
presiding officer, but the Senators themselves.
His form of address was "Senators," instead of
the enstomary "Mr. President"; his manner
in the chair was a perfect combination of dig
nity and deference.
John C. Breckinridge was an interesting
figure in the chair. He was the personifica
tion, of courtesy. Chester A. Arthur was a tnau
of very much the same pattern, and his too
short occupancy of the chair prepared the
country for the courtly dtgnlty which char
acterized him in !h>- White 11 ii.s-. T he best
purliHineutarian ever in the Vice-Presidential
cuair was Schuylcr Colfax.
Most of the V ec-Presidents have brcn
troubled throughout their terms by the buz
zing of the Presidential bee, and there is
alwp.ys a disposition among opponents of the
administration to flatter a Vice-Preriident by
ministering to his mnbition. The Presidents
haw too often yielded to the weakness of
treating this officer as an heir-apparent whose
very existence is an unwelcome reminder of
tne possibilities of succession. There was
none of this feelrng between HarrlsM and
Morton, but there haa been a good deal be
tween Cleveland and Hendricks and Cleveland
and Stevt'iisoa. One or two Presidents have
invited the Vice-President to sit with them in
Cabinet council, but, except in tho case ot Van
Buren, the practice was not attended with any
pleasant or beneficial results.

PRESS CLUB SMOKER.
Valuable Plctnres and Bare Papers and
Books Among the Cariosities of
the I'oomi,
One of tbe semi â¢ occasional smoKers
which have usually proved so entertaining
at the Press Club to all who have at
tended is to be given to-night. The invi
tation whici has been sent to the mem
bers is brief and is as follows:
"An informal smoker will be held at the
cluoroonis on the evening of Saturday,
February 27. You are cordially invited to
attend. Pipes, tobacco, music and a good
time."
This will be the first entertainment
since the Yuleticle jinks, which was at
tended by almost a packed throng, and
which was enjoyed by everybody. Un
like the jinks, however, there will be do
programme. Things will work out only
as they happen. The club continues to bÂ«
very popular.
A number of works of art have laiely
been added to the rooms. W. A. Coulter,
the widely known artist, who greatly ex
cels in marine wort, has contributed a
large and handsome picture in pen and
ink representing a jury-rigged Â»iuik,
tossed hither and thither in the desolate
ocean.
The picture is called "The Last Watch."
It is considered a very tine thing. An
other picture by George E. Lynn is a pen
and ink sketch of Julia Marlowe Tabor,
the noied actress. It likewise is consid
ered one of Lvnn's best. Besides these
James M. Hamilton has contributed a pen
and ink picture of himself in Scotch High
land costume by Joe Strong. It is well
liked.
Besides these there are some curiosities
in journalism. One is a copy o! tbe tirst
issue of the 80-ton Transcript of July 4,
1830. It was handsomely framed and pre
sented to the club by Cnaries F. Hanlon.
Another rare thing is a copy of the Lon
don Times of June 22, 1815, containing the
account of the deieat of Napoleon by
Wellington. It was contributed by
Colonel H. Treveliyan of Fresno, one of
the heroes who fought in the famous
charge at Balaklava. Quite a number of
valuable books have also been recently
added to the rooms. The smoker, it is be
lieved, will be well attended.
THE LABOR COUNCIL
It Roundljr Denouncen the Recent La
bor Law Convention.
The regular meeting of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council was held last eve nine,
and Secretary Rosenberg, who was one of
the committee of arrangements of the Cal
ifornia Labor Law Convention, explained
why he had withdrawn from the commit
tee. He said that he could not indorse
the resolutions prepared to be presented
to the meeting that was held recently in
Metropolitan Hall. He said that they
were misleading and did not state the
facts relating to the labor law legislation
at Sacramento. Bather than place the
council in a ridiculous position uy appar
ently indorsing the same by passively lei
ting them go through he withdrew.
Delegate McArthur was another repre
sentative of the council who withdrew
from the convention for the same reason.
He aaid that the convention way a "howl
ing success," so tar as noise was con
cerned, but he would not speak on that
platiorm an advertised, knowing as he
did in advance what the chairman of the
convention was going to say. He de
clared that the chairman ( J. W. Rose), by
his assertions, put the laboring classes in
a most ridiculous position by making
many statements that were wholly false.
These statements referred to strikes, lock
outs, etc., as failures, ami labor unions
also as failures. The action of the com
mitteemen in drawing out of ti.e conven
tion was indorsed.
A resolution â mentioned elsewhere in
these columns â was pp.ssed urging the
early commencement of work ou the new

Louis Hansen's Attempt to Save His
Hat Nearly Cost Hun His Life
on the Pi dmont.
The stern-wheel steamer Grace Barton
has been practically rebuilt and is now as
good aa a new vessel. An upper house
has been built on her and in it will be
cabins and waiting-rooms for passengers.
A tank lias been put up near the wheel
house and there will be running water
throuek the vessel in consequence. On
all the other bay and river steamers the
water is supplied from pitchers and
water-buckets. The cabin will be a very
pretty one, and when all the alterations
are completed the new steamer will De
one of the best of her class in the bay.
Her name will probably be changed to
Menlo, as in the near future she will
probably be running between here and
Alviso in connection with the Santa Clara
Valley Railway Company.
The Piper-Aden-Goodall Company was
forced to purchase the steamer in self
defense. They are running opposition to
the Southern Pacific, and some time ago
when they wanted to lay the Sunol up for
repairs they found what that opposition
meant. They could neither beg, borrow
nor steal a vessel, as Manager Pryor put
it yesterday. An agent of the railroad had
been around to every owner of a stern
wheel steamer in the biy, and the result
was that not one of them could be hired
for love or money. It was tqen the firm
determined upon purchasing the Barton,
and now they have one of the handiest
crafts in the bay. The Grace Barton, or
the Menlo, as she will probably be called
| later on, will have her trial trip on the
j bay some time next week.

Tne British ship Purt Locran will sail
probaDly to-day for Ca\e Town with a
load of wheat. She is only 1833 tons reg
ister, yet her capacity is such tnat Captain
Pierce has been abio to stow <tway 3150
j tons of wheat in her holds. A number oi
vessels are going to Cape Town, bin,
strange to say, there seems to be no de
mand for wheat in India.
The pyp-ies have been driven out of
Marin Count 3*. and they are now on their
way to San Jose, via Men:o Park. They
tore down half the fencing in Mill Valley
to use for firewood; chickens [and other
domestic animals mysteriously disap
peared, and any loose article that was left
13 - ing around by the residents could never
be found when wanted. Finally
the residents of Marin County rose
in tlieir wrath and drove out the
invaders. Two constables took them
in charge an I|, brought them all
to San Francisco. Therj were eight
wagon-loads of them, and when Sergeant
Mahoney saw them coming off the Sausn
lito ferry-boat he at once telephoned the
Habor Police station for assistance. Two
officers were sent down and the gypsies
were told that they would have to move
on. They asked if they might go to
Santa Clara, and the sergeant said he
didn't care where they went so long as
they got out of San Francisco County. To
make sure that they did not lose their
way a mounted pokceman was sent along
to show them the San Mateo boundary
line. *
There seems to be some doubts about
the movements of the batile-shipOregon.
It has been stated that she will leave next
Thursday for Seattle to go on the drydock,
but tome of her officers assert that bhe
will remain here for at least two month-.
She certainly needs a cleaning, and the
chances are that next Thursday will see
her under way.
SOON TO CLEAVE THE WATERS.
Two Gunboati to lie Launched at the
Inion Iron Works.
The two United States gunboats. Wheel
ing and Marietta, being built at the Union
Iron Works, are now nearly finished. It
is expected that they will be launched
March IS.
Among those who will be present at the
launching are representative citizens of
Wheeling, W. Va., and Marietta. Ohio,
from which places the boa:s have been
named. Invitations have not yet been
issued, but will be shortly, and a pro
gramme of exercises for the launching
will also be prepared.
We take great pleasure in calling the at
tention of our reaiiers to tho fifty-first an
nual report (published elsewhere) of the
Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany. It is, taken as a vfhole, one of the
most satisfactory and assuring accountings
made public this year. The Connecticut
Mutual Life Insurance Company, as the
report of the president shows, is con
ducted on conservative lines. It works
solely for the larce tinancial benan't of its
members â in other words, for all those
who are insured in the company. Presi
dent Greene in his report very aptly illog.
trates the differences between the so
called progressive, or as he terms them,
the "rushing" members of the insurance
profession, who push forward their busi
ness simply for the purpose o) aggregat
ing it, without any relation to its absolute
cost. The Connecticut Mutual Life's ex
pense, it is said, is less than that of any
other company, and only about half of
that of the great "pushing" companies.
Its results to policy-holders are larger
than the others, and its stability is greater
and more conservative. President Greene's
report is one of the most interesting that
has been put out for many years, an<' he
takes a very vital and practical view of
the insurance question.
It has been computed that between 36,
--000.000 and 37,000,000 babies arrive each
year.

DEATH CAME TO
HIM SUDDENLY
Police Sergeant J. M. Fitz
gibbon Expired Yes
terday.
Stricken With Heart Disease as
He Alighted From a Cable
Car.
A Veteran of thi Force Who NÂ«ver
Knew a Day cf Sicknessâ Twenty-
Nine Y.ars on Dn'y.
Police Sergeant John M. Fitzgibbon,
one of the veterans of the force, died sua
deniy early yesterday morning.
He left his home at 545 Howard street to
go to a restaurant at 915 J. a ' Howard street,
where it was his custom to eat his break
fast, and on alighting from a car was seen
POLICE SERGEANT JOHN M. FITZGIBBON, Who Died
Suddenly Yesterday Morning;.
to put bis bands to his chest in a manner
that indicated :.e was in pain.
From the street he staggered into the
restaurant and sank into a chair. A
physician was hurriedly summoned, but
within a few moments and without hav
ing uttered a word be was dead. Death
was doubtless from heart disease, but the
Coroner's office was notified and the body
taken to the Morgue.
Deceased was a native of Ireland, 64
years of age, and had been on tue police
force twenty-nine years lacking three
days. He had always been in robust
health, and it was a matter of pride to
him that he bad never missed a watch
through sickness while in the public
service.
Sergeant Fitzgibbon was appointed to
the police force on May 1, 1868, the same
day on which Captain Dumeavy became a
patrolman, and he was always held h:gn
in the esteem of his superiors and fellow
officers.
He never saw the Board of Police Com
missioners in session â a distinction en
joyed by few of those who have been so
long a period in the Police Department.
Two years ago the deceased wss ap
pointed to the position of sergeant, but
he continued to keep his watch on the
Pacific Mail dock, where he nad been
stationed previously.
During his long public service Sergeant
Fitzgibbon had accumulated quite a for
tune, his savings being invested in real
estate at times when prices were low. In
addition to his home at 545 Howard street
he owned a large lot on Liberty street,
three dwelling houses on Fell street and a
ranch in San LuisObinro County. Hises
ta;e is valued at about 150.000.
Deceased was a widower and had two
daughters, one being the wife of William
E. White of this City and the other of
Frank Â£. Moore of Sanla Barbara.

Green way's A- Weary of

The Quiet Passing of the Popular
Friday Night Cotillon
Clnb.
Not Enough Animation Left to
Appoint His Worthy
Successor.
i
The dissolution of the fashion ab*e Fri
day Night Cotillon Club is imminent.
E. M. Greenway, the dictator of the
swell set, is suffering, according to his
own diagnosis, from a severe cold and the
many evils that overtake a man enjoying
his lucrative position.
Succinctly he says: "There is a lot of
money in my business, but it kills a
man." And what with thinking of his*
cold ard his business that kiils and his
rheumatic knee, he does not even care if
the slowly dying Friday cotillon ever re
vives again or not.
The leader is n-woary. With bis own
hand lie proposes to remove from his
fevered and aching brow the dictator's
crown, and is not even interested enough
in the social destiny to appoint a suc
cessor.
This lingering death of the fashionable
organization will neither shock nor sur
prise the smart set, for it was itself that
dealt the fatal blow.
Little by little the attendance at
the cotillon has fallen off until at
the last meeting there were only !
fifty-five couples on the floor, against i
nearly 150 cuuplts the year previous.
Greenway nought to account for the lack
of inter. Bt in every way. It could not bi
hard times. At last the disagreeable truth ;
had to be acknowledged. Society, cold, !
cruel, nmratefu l , and above all fickle, !
gave the ever-faithful friend the go-by.
The cotiilo-.i arranged to take place just
before the Len>en season had for lack of '
application to be postpon d, and it is ex
tremely doubtful if the usual Easter cotil
lon will take pace.
It is more than probable that the two {
dancing classes, the Friday Fortnightly !
and the Monday Night class, have usurped '
the exclusive patronatre of the Friday
nights. Th â¢ Monday night dances have
been extremely popular and the Friday
fortnightlys, with the.r extremely small
dues, are financially away ahead, "and the
attendance is so large that vi the last two
dances invitations had to be limited.
However, in spite of all the distressing
circumstances attending the last hour- of
the Friday Night Club, Greenway is chary
about promising the solemn "rest in
peace." Like a careful doctor be stand*,
and with his finger on the pulse, counts
the last throbs and wisely shakes his head.
In spite of his lack of interest in all ;
social matters, the self-deposed leader I
predicts that ihe Teri sichoreans is to b? â 
the coming sweil organization. And
though he sighs and protests he is weary
and wants to rest, "1 wouid like to man
age the Terpsichoreans," he say?.
The Friday Night Coiillon* Club was
organ zeii some* fourteen years ago.
Its first leader was E. H. Sheldon. The
initial cotillon was had at thA B. B. Hall
on Eddy street, Sheldon leading with
Miss Louise Tevis, now Mrs. Fred Sharon.
For two years Sheldon directed the des
tiny of the club, and then Allen St. John
Bowie assumed control. Bowie looked
after the welfare of the club but for
one season. He led his first cotillon with
Mrs. Latham as his partner.
After Bowie's brief reign came Green
way, who uas ever since directed the for
tunes of the cinb. At the first Greenway
cotillon Miss Tessie Fair, now Mrs. Her
man Oelricus, was the leader's vis-a-vis.
Iluuer Sue* Welburn.
J. J. Raver, as assignee of the Wasp Pub
lishing Company, has sued O. M. Welburn,
Collector of Internal Revenue, in the Justice
court, in his individual capacity, for 5=48 for
advertising. The United States Distric-t Attor
ney's otlice will request that t tie case be trans
ferred to the United States District Court, on
the ground that the suit is properly against
Mr. Weiburn in his official capacity.

RECEIVERS OF
STOLEN GOODS
Chief Crowley Intends to
Land Them All in
Jail.
The Recent Raid of the Tehama-
Street "Fence" Is Only
a Beginning.
Harper, One of the Self* Accused
Thieves, Has Offered to Confess
to Save His Wife.
The crusade against tho pawnbrokers
who are doing a rushing business in stolen
goods has begun in earnest, and Chief
Crowley has instructed some of his best
men to follow up all cases reported to the
source of disbursement. That is usually a
pawnshop.
Some of these have been doing a lucra
tive business witn thieves. Lucas and dry
goods the "fence," as the pawnbroker :s
called, sells at private houses through the
medium of peddlers, but all jewelry m
melted ap and Bold in nuggets to the
Mini.
The sensational arrest made by Police
man Ryan Thursday night at the home
of Mattie Frawley and Rose Harper on
Tehama street was the first successful
attempt of the kind that has been made
here in years.
Yesterday afternoon Detective Cody,
who is workinc on these cases, arrested
one of the pawnbrokers. Abraham Davis
was booked on a charge of receiving stolen
property at his place of business, llf>o
Market street. He is accused of receiving
and melting up tt gold watch stolen by
Burglar James Lee, who appropriated it
from the person of Benjamin Hughes.
W. Warden, C. Harper, Matti<Â» Frawley,
Rose Harper and Elizabeth Keane were
all booked yesterday afternoon at the Ci:y
Prison on charges of burglary and receiv
ing stolen goods.
Harper declares that until about six
months ago he was a stranger to crime
and had always been an industrious
workman. He seems to be very much at
tached to this woman Rosie.
"She had uot been what you would call
a Eood woman, perhaps," he said, with a
touch of patho", "but she was trying to
do better and I think this was partly due
to me."
Unlike Warden, Harper is not addicted
to morpnine, arid though he undoubtedly
assisted in numerous burglaries and petty
larcenies, bis story of the motive which
prompted him to the crimes is described
in a manner that prompts belief. He re
fuses 10 say any thing that will implicate
Warden, but offered to assist the detec
tives in locating stolen plunder if they
would refrain from prosecuting the woman
whom he calls his wile, lie insists that
she bad no compliciiy in the affairs, and
so far only a charge of vagrancy has been
placed against her.
SUIT FOR OVER A MILLION.
P. G. Gal pin Going >o Portland to Pros
ecute It Against Executors of
William S Ladd
The suit of Mrs. P.Albert Hiller of this
City against the executors of the last will
of William S, Ladd of Portland. Or.,
which has been in the Unned States Cir
cuit Court of that city for the past two
years, is to be argued on next Monday.
The suit is one brou-ht for $1,500,000 for
the lunds arisine out of a sale of stock in
the 0.-egon Sieam Navigation Company
belonging to the estate ot J. W. Ladd,
who was the first hr.sband of Mrs. Hiller.
The will of J. W. Ladd wasprobited in
the Superior Court o; this City and County,
and in the proceedings the stock was not
inventoried nor was there Any order ever
made by the court authorizing its sale.
William S. Ladd of Oregon was the exec
utor. The amount of the stock was 7600
shares. No accounting was ever made of
it, and the suit is brought for the recovery
of the value of the stock.
P. G. Galpln of tne firm of Galpin &
Zeigler. who are the attorneys lor the
plaintiff in the action, left for Portland
last evening. It is expected that 'ho ar
pument will occupy tue greater part of
next wt'ok.

We saw some tea the
other day â tea sold in San
Francisco âso highly col-
ored that a spoonful washed
in cold water, left an ugly
green powder, one-six-

the bottom of the cup.
Not all tea is colored like
that of course ; some tea is
colored only a little. Schil-

i
CARSON. Nev., Feb. 26.â There were
two new additions to the Corbett strong
hold to-day in the persons of William A.
Brady, the big pugilist's partner and
backer, ana Charley White. t!ie well
known trainer. Bra.ly and White had no
sooner set foot in Carson than they char
tered a rig and shot oat to Shaw's Springs
to have a look at Jim. Brady was par
ticularly anxious to be with his protege!
and see for himself whether or not all of
the reports he hail heard of the Califor
nian's superb condition were true. He
arrived at the training quarters just in I
time to catch the big fellow at work with i
his trainers, and to say that he was j
pleased with what he saw would be to i
put it milder than he himself described
h!s feel infra.
'Why. I am actually paralyzed," said
the genial Billy in his characteristic way.
"Of course, I expected to see Jim looking
well, for when I last saw him in the East
he seemed to be picking up. But I did
not dream that I would find him so big
and fine as I did to-day. It staggered me,
'pon mv honor. 1 have known Corbett a
Jong time and have seen him in bis best
battles, but I will say with all sincerity
that he never before looked so well as he
does now. I cm satisfied, alter seeing
him wear out all of his trainers, one After
another, this morning that his wind is
sunerb. That was the only thing I was
afraid of. You know hts exhibition with
that sailor, Sharkey, started stories nil
over the country to the effect that Corbett
had passed the top notch ol his fighting
career and was going down hill. It was
no wonder, ether, for from all I have
heard Jim made a miserable showing with
the mariner and only squeezed through
with the decision by a scratch.
."But after all it was the best thing that
could have happened to him. It woke
him up at last to something that his
friends never could beat into bis headâ
the fact that a man's reputation alone
will not keep him in the championship
cuss. Ordinarily, in good condition, Jim
would have thumped thai sailor out and
asleep in a couple of round', or anybody
that looked like him, but he made a mis
take in thinking that he coulU turn the
trick without conditioning himself for
the mill. It was a great lesson ; though,
as is shown by the manner in which he
got right down to the real thing of taking
care of himself after that experience. You
remember that he went off to Bartlett
Springs and got a good start, and when he
got .back East he was the very personifica
tion of good behavior. He has really been
in training for this contest with Ftzsiro
roons ever since the articles were signed,
but I will say candidly that I did not ex
pect to see liirn round out into such splen
did condition as I found him. He is tne
greatest fightor the world ever saw, in my
humble opinion. Will he win? Why,
my bop, I don't see how he can possibly
lose, unless it is by a fluke."
Brady made a number of bets on Cor
bett while in New York recently, giving
oddÃ of 10 to 8. He has brought a corpu
lent wallet to Carson with him, and ex
rects to do some tall betting between now
and the day of the battle. He would pre
fer, of course, to get something like even
money, but stands ready to give odds in
the event that the pries on Fitzsimmons
does not advance.
Billy brought a mascot with him for
Corbett. It is an old and decrepit dog, a
cross tetween a pointer and a bulldog,
which responds to the appellation of
"Nea." J.m bailed the appearance of
Ned with unfeigned delight, and nearly
hugeed Brady to deÂ»th for beiug so
thoughtful. Ned is not making his debut
as Corbett's mascot by any manner of
means. He was with the Callfornian dur

van and Mitchell, and journeyed with him
to Hot Springs when Jim went there to
get ready for the battle with Fitzsimmons
which ended in a fiasco. The fact that
Corbett never lost a battle is attributed to
Ned's abilities as * mascot.
Ned has a rival at the springs in the
handsome collie which Harry Corbeit
gave to his brother a fortnight ago. The
two mascots mixed matters up as soon as
they got sight of each other. The collie
sought to chase the new-comer off the
grounds, but old Ned would not havo it
that way. He pitched into the youngster
and soon had him hors de combat and
willing to acknowledge that he had the
right-of-way in the mascot line.
Corbett put in a good day's work and,
as usual, bad crowds of visitors. His bag
punching interests the callers probably
more than any other branch of his work.
Jim is an adept at thumping the pneu
matic ball, having it down so fine that he
can reproduce tde sound of a snare drum,
with base accompaniment, the galloping
of a horse and tho approach of a detach
ment of the Salvation Army. He take* a
turn at tbe ball twice a day and keeps up
the rat-a-tat for at least twenty minutes
without stopping to take a brsatb. Tuis,
along with some exercise on the wrist
machine, is the beginning of his routine.
This over, the champion, enveloped in a
big fur overcoat, trips over the snow to
the handball court, w.-.ere he puts in from
a half to three-quarters of an hour in
earnest play with Al Hampton and Joe
Corbett. Then come the boxing bouts.
He began this morning with Bihy Woods,
the latter being encased in his pneumatic
armor, and thumped him merrily as long as
Billy could stand it. Once during this bout
Corbett whipped in a peculiar left-hand
blow which caught Billy on the point of the
chin and despite the protection afforded
by the mask the Denver man reeled and
would have falien had not Corbett caught
him in time.
"I have been trying to perfect that blow
ever since I have been here," said Jim,
addressing me, while Woods was taking a
rest. "It is something new and I fancy it
very much, for I believe I can develop it
into one of the most dangerous punches
in nÂ»y repertoire. It has to be put in like
a flash, but if it lands the fellow who gets
it is almost sure to go down and out."
I watcned the big fellow carelnlly when
Woods was ready to resume boxing, and
did not have to wait long to see the blow
repeated. Woods was sta.gered again
with it.
It is difficult to describe the blow. It
appears to me to be a sort of cross between
i a hook and en npp.-rcut Corbett holds
his fist close to bis hip and waits for bis
opponent to drop his right arm a little
j below its usual resting place when in po
: sition for boxing. The moment the open
| ing is offered his glove Hies upward and
| across, the arm being slightly crooked, as
lin the case when a hook is intended. The
| blow is in direct line for the other man's
; chin, and is essentially a knockout blow.
Corbett says it does not necessarily nave
j to be delivered with great force in order to
' be effective, as it is the jar or jolt that de-
Drives the opponent temporarily of his
senses.
"Any more kicks from Fitzsimmons to
| day?" asked the big fellow, aa he was
| preparing for a bout with Jeffries. Being
j informed that Bob bad been thoroughly
| quiet, Jim laughed and said he guessed
j the Comishman was thinking up a me
j thing new \o spring on Referee Siler.
"It Jooks funny, indeed, " mused the
Californian. "Fitz has always prided
bimself on being a great infi^hter, and his
objections this time to the rules permit
ting us to nit in clinches and breaks strike
me as being rather strange. But I am
not wasting any gray matter in trying to
find out what he is really up to. i don't
care. For my part I am ready to fight
under any old rules, so long as I get a
chance at that tall fellow. I intend to
whip him, but I want to do it fair and
square.
"My only desire in connection with the
rules is that nothing will be incorporated
in them which will give Fitzsimmont an
opportunity to do any tricky fouling or to
lie down and claim he is fouled. I want
tho clory of whipping him out and out
and don't wish any decision on afoul. I
honestly believe that if Fitzsimmons
should lie down in the ring without giving

me a chance to pat him to sleep I would
be tempted to kick him in tbe face. I am
after the glory in this contest as much as
the money."
It was a quiet day out at Cook's ranch
where "Lanky Bob" is getting ready for
the big mill; and it was rather gloomy,
too. Neither Fitzsimmons nor his brother
in-law, Martin Julian, has recovered
from the saddening effect of that unhappy
telegram from New York, which yesterday
told them of the death of Julian's and Mrs.
Fiizsimmona' mother. Poor little Julian
is about prostrated and repeatedly breaks
down and sobs like a child.
Fitzsimmons continued his training,
but wont at his work in a listless and
moody manner. He boxed three rounds
each this morning with Hickey, Stelzner
and Roeber without taking a rest, and
then gave Roeber a tussle on the wrest
ling pad. He came into town at noon for
his mail, walking and running both ways,
and in the afternoon had another seance
with his trainers. Bob says he is now
thoroughly acclimated, and finds his wind
greatly improved, daspite the altitude of
Carson. He is eating ravenously now,
having completely recovered from his ra
cetit stomach trouble.
Fitzsimmons declines to further discuss
his recently raised objection to the rules
which are to govern tne battle. He says
his complaint has been wrongfuily con
strued as an indication of cowardice on
his part in some quarters, and for that
reason he is poinjc to stop talking.
"They will find out on the 17th of March
whether or not lam afraid of that dude
with the pompadour," said Bob, clench
ing his lists and shaking his heaa
ominously. "I'll give them a little song
to sing, mark me."

It was Hawkins' desire to train at Shaws
Springs with Corbett, but the latter's
retinue has grown to such proportions
that there is no more room there, and
Hawkins had to be turned away.
George Green, the clever welter-weight
who is going to meet "Mysterious" Bi,ly

at the springs, and left there this evening.
He and Hawkins have joined issues and
will train at the Wigein ranch at Empire,
three milos from Carson. They leave for
the ranch in the mornine, along witn
their trainers. "Mysterious" Smith and
Flaherty are not here yet, but are on the
way. It is not known where they wul
train.
Harry Corbett, the "champ's" big
brother, returned to Carson this morning
and is as busy as a bird dog. He is get
ting everything into shipshape for the
bringing of two special trainloads of San
Franciscans to Carson to witness the great
battle, and also for the opening of his
Doolrooms. In the latter ventu-e he will
be associated with Johnny Coleman. while
in his special-train affair Colonel C. F.
Burns is hia partner. The poolrooms will
be opened about the 6th of March, and it
is the intention of the projectors to handle
bets on the San Francisco and New Or

Dan Stuart is not out yet, but i* up and

things frum this retreat, and is not letting
any of the details stip through his ringers.
Stuart is greatly gratified over the way
the tickets for the big mill a c going, and
says there is no question now about the

Work on the mammoth building is

Evidence That a few San Franciscan*
Will See the Fight.
The Southern Pacific Company has
come to the conclusion that it will be all
It can do to carry the throngs of people
who want to see the world's champion
ship battled for by Corbett and Fitzrim
mons. Indeed the railroad has almost
despaired of its ability to take all who want
to go, despite the fact that it will not only
use all of the Pullmans available, but will
bring into requisition its ordinary passen
ger and possibly its tourist cars.
The officers of the road are exerting
themselves to gather in all the shekels
possible, Dut they are not certain that they
can do it. Still they will try very hard.
Up to yesterday iifty cars, each holding
twenty-two people, bad been engaged irom
San Francisco alone. Besides this Fresno
is asking for five, Sacramento five, and
even Woodland wants two or three, while
applications Irom other towns are coming
in pretty last. As one of the leading offi
cials of the road says, "there isn't sleep
ing accommodation at Carson for the peo
ple who are going." Because of this as
many as possible are trying to arrange for
Pullman transportation.
Already about 7000 admission seats have
been sold for the pavilion where ihe tight
is to take place. Besides this Jour special
trains of ten Pullmans and two baegage
cars each, and each drawn by two locomo
tives, have been chartered from Chicago.
It is considered certain that . there will be
from Chicago alone at least fifty cars of
people, while from Ban Francisco there
will probably be at least eighty.
New York, Cincinnati, Louisville, Sti'
Louis and other cities are also, of couise,
expected to contribute a great many, as
well as 'he Mississippi and Missouri
valleys. From up and down the coast also
there will be many.
It is considered lucky that there Is so
large an amount of siding at Carson. It is
what is known as a "pusher" station.
From Carson to Virginia the road is very
precipitous and as Carson is situated in
the Eagle Creek Valley, a couple of milos
from the Carson River, where tho road is
very favorable a good many switches have
been constructed in times past for the ac
commodation of engines and cars. |
The cars coming -from Chicago will, as
is now estimated, cover tbree-fourtbs of a
mile of truck, while those from here will
require at 1-Ast a mile. That is a mile
and three-quarters to start with. When
other cities and towns are accommodated
it is believed the switch yard at Carson
will look something like the business of a
transcontinental railroad.
A few days ago John P. Dunning, agent
here of one of the press associations,
went to Carson. He wanted to make
arrangements for getting out a report and
proposed to take four men there. ,He
wanted, to see what board and other ex
penses would be. He was told that it he
would bring his four men on then and
remain till after the tight they could have
board for $23 a week each, but if he waited
till near me time of the tight it would
cost him more.
It was finally decided that A. C. Thomas
of Chicago, jjeneral Western agent of the
association, First Assistant Agent Nat C.
right and Harry L. Beach of Chicago
and a force irop.i this City would go de
spite the high board prices.

Murderous Maniac Escapes
From Medical Lake's
Asylum.
With Giant Strength He Tears
an Iron Screen From His
Cell Window.
Though the M dman Is Manacled, the
Residents of the Vicinity Fear
His Lust for Elood.
MEDICAL LAKE, Or., Feb. 26.â
Thomas Devine, the most desperate in
sane criminal ever consigned to the State
hospital here, made nis escape last night
and is still at large. The well-known
strength and murderous tendencies of
Devine have caused him to be closely
guarded, and he was almost constantly
handcuffed. Two years ago he broke out
of his room at the hospital, procured an
oaken mop stick from a wnrd washroom,
and, lyine in wait for Niche Watchman
Winn, almost killed him and then escaped
from the building. He was recaptured on
the Yakima Indian reservation and has
since worn handcuffs, when not personally
attended.
During the supper hour last evening,
Devine succeeded in evading his keepers
long enough to wrench off nn iron screen
and break ihe glass of the window of his
room. The room is in tbe second story,
but the desperate fellow dropped to the
gronnd, some twenty feet, while still
handcuffed, and escaped in the darkness.
The strength of the man was evidenced
by the comparative ease with which he
tore out three locks of the iron screen.
His escape was soon discovered and Super
intendent Semple dispatched searcninc
parties in all directions and notified the
officials of the surrounding towns by tele
graph to be on the lookout. As Devine
wears handcuffs and is without hat or
coat ii would seem that it will be easy to
locate him. He is a giant in physique,
weighs about 195 pounds, hat black hair
and eyes and is of dark complexion. His
homicidal tendencies render him a very
daneerous lunatic to be at large.
PORTLAND PAWNSHOP ROMANCE.
Sister and Brother Reunited Through the
Medium of a Pledged
Jewel.
PORTLAND, Ok., Feb. 26.â The dis
covery of an amethyst seal ring in the
show-window of a pawnshop yesterday
will lead to the reunion of a brother and
sister who had not seen or heard of each
other in two decades.
Mrs, S. E. Carrington of Cambridge,
Mass., came to Portland a few days ago
on a visit to friends prior to her leaving
| for Southern California in search of
health. Yesterday morning, while
promenading with the woman whom she
is visiting, her attention was casually
drawn to a pawnbroker's show-window.
She saw a ring which struck her as being
one ahe had once seen before, and Mrs.
Carrington asked the broker to allow her
to in-pect it. The request was readily
granted, and to her great amazement she
found engraved on the inside of the ring
"E. W. 8., from mother."
"Why, that's my brother's rinsr," ex
claimed Mrs. Carrington. "Where did
you get it?"
The broker, referring to his books, re
plied that early this month the owner bor
rowed $3 on it to mike up a sufficient sum
to cairy him to Sacramento. He at that
time requested the broker not to dispose
of the ring under any circumstances, add
ing that it was a gift from his dead
mother and that he would redeem it in
thirty or forty days. He left his Sacra
mento address with the present custodian
of the memento.
Mrs. Carrlngton was prepared to re
deem it at once, but the broker declined
to accommodate h?r without the presenta
tion of the pawn-ticket. He, nowercr,
gave Mrs. Carringion her broti er's ad
aress anil sheat once availed herself of
the nse of the wires. At 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon the anxious sister had an
answer from her brother and to-night she
left to meet him.

SETTLERS FOR VENEZUELA.
American Concessionaires to Colonize
Land Leased From the Gov
ernment
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Feb. 26.âDon
ald Grant, well known in the West as a
railroad contractor and builder, is now ac
his winter residence in this city. Mr.
Grant has just returned from Venezuela,
South America, where he and bis co-part
ners have succeeded in getting a con
cession of land embracing 15,000 square
miles.
"I have succeeded in obtaining from the
Government of Venezuela a fine body of
land, either for agricultural, stcck-raisine
or mining purposes," said he to-day.
â¢'The land lies an the northeastern part of
the republic, and the concession was
granted by the Government to promote
the settlement of the country. There are
but few settlers outside of the natives, and
they might as well not be there, as far as
the development of Â«he country goes.
Our town in the concession is Santa Cata
lina, and nowhere on the Pacific Coast can
a finer port of entry be. found."
"What are tbe principal and best-pay
ing oroducts there?"
"One can raise anything that grows in
any other country, and, what is better
still, he can plant anything he chooses
and it will grow and mature every rnontd
in tbe year. Coffee is the principal prod
uct. For the moat part our land is flat, but
in -ome parts there are some rather high
altitudes, and in the mountains we have
as fine Bessemer iron ora as can bÂ« found
anywhere in this country. Only six miles
from Santa Catalina is a solid hill of un.
usually pure Bessemer ore, one and a half
or two and a half miles in extent, and
about 600 feet in height, and in this there
are over 1,000,000,000 ton 3of ore in sight,
and within six miies of ocean steamships.
"Tbe company has contracted for the
immediate erection of a hote ," continued
Mr. Grant, "and, in addition to this build
ing, there wiil be another lar-re structure
for a store and offices. A picked colony
of about twenty tivÂ« persons sailed from
New York for that place on February 4,
arm other-t will soon follow. It is our in
tention to settle that country with people
from here, although there are a good
many English nnd Germans already there.
It is a fane country and tbeclimate is very
similar to that in Southern California, and
I believe when this and its many other
advantages become generally known the
opportunity will Â«be quickly grasped and
there will be something like an Oklahoma
rush."
Mr. Grant will remain in Santa Monica
for about a month, and on tbe Ist of
April will return -to his Venezuelan pos
session?, leaving his family here until he
is prepared for their stay in their new
home.

FOOD COFFEE.
MOEE FUN
To Be Well Than .All the Best of the
Fun on Earth.
Some physicians say that all nervous
diseases arise from a disordered stomach,
and that even the peculiar diseases of
females are direcriy traceable to an unbal-
anced nervous system caused by stomach
troubles. - -,';. <â¢
The stomach may be suffering, but will
not show it there; freauently the distress
will be telegraphed over the nerves to tho
head, eyes, back or abdomen. ; â¢'
Medicines are not so much needed as
good common-sense in eating and drink-
ing. Coffee is one of the most prolific
causes of trouble with the stomach, prin-
cipally because people continue to use it
when they' are f6eling bad, not knowing
that the poisonous alkaloids of coffee di-
rectly check digestion and attack the liver.
A dismissal of coffee for a week or ten
days will show many sufferers the causa
of their troubles, and, while they won't
eet well in that time, the improvement in
health will open their eyes. Postum, the
health coffee, made at Battle Greek,
Mich., can be usÂ°d by those who are
troubled with coffee, and it agrees per-
fectly with the weakest stomach, while
the pure food elements of the grains of
which it is made will nourish and fatten
the body. Return to natural living and
get well.
Beware of the fraudulent imitations of
the original Postum Cereal grain coffee.

the- Idaho Leg. stature. The affidavit sets
forth that Kepresentative W. Y. Perkins

gave him $110, the remaining $100 not

SAUSALITO MAN'S OFFENSE.
Charles Burrey Musi Face the Law for
Tak.ng Two P.ctures Owned by
the SI in keys.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Feb. 26 âArt circles
in Mann County will be treated to a bit of
a surprise this week, for Darnel Slinkey, a
brother of J. E. Slinkey, the proprietor of
El Monte Hotel, has sworn to a complaint
â¢ before Recorder Josepn H. Pryor, charg
ing Charles Burrey. late of Sausalito, but
now a resident of ban Rafael, witn taking
two pictures from the Hotel Sau?alito.
Mr. Burrey is really not as bad a man
as Mr. Siinkey would have it appear, for
when he heard that Slinkey intended to
bring an action against him he took the
pictures from the wall winch they graced
and returned them, and they now occupy
adust-covered shell in the hallway of
Hotel Sausalito.
The pictures are not original but, toge
gether with tne frame*, they would proD
â¢abiy bring about $175 at* forced sale.
One represents Columbus at the court of
Ferdinand and Isabella and the o:her is a
chromo in colors of a Roman chariot race.
Sausaliio's entire municipal covern
roer. t is agitated ovrr the affair, and Mar
shal John E. Creed has the warrant In his
pocket with which to surprise the unsus
pecting Burrey.
Pror-ecuting Attorner Adolph Sylva is
consulting his law bcoks for cases bearing
on the subject and Judge Prvor, before
whom the case must De tried, is debating
in his own mind whether the offense is
serious enough to permit Mr. Burrey to
enjoy freedom upon bail.
â¢ Mr. Barrey is known from one end of
the county "to the other, for be was Hie
editor of the Herald, which, after chang
ing us headquarters to almost every town
in Marin County, finally gsve up thfÂ» strug
gle for existence and died. Mr. Burrey
lor many years lived with tie Klinkeys in
Sausalito and became imbued with the
idea that the pictures in question really
belonged to him. Now, Slinkey wants his
pic.ures, but at the same time be wants
Mr. Burrey punishe \ for tnking them
away, and that is why the Marshal of
Sausalito is waiting for the sri admirer to
walk into the arm< of the law.
. BXXTJL ROSA. JUHOKS DISAGREE.
Fail to Reach a Verdict in Ex- Recorder
Hall's Case.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. After
being locked up for twenty-four hours, the
jury- in the case of the People vs. G. P.
Hail was unable to agree and was dis
charged by the court. Mr. Hail was
charged with failing to account for $35 cf
county money, while serving as .Recorder
of this county, the specific charge being
but one of a series of alleged shortages.
The trial lasted over two week?, and was
most hotly contested. It is said to bava
cost Sonoma County $10,000, and the end
is not yet. It was shown during tue. trial
that lour or five different persons had
access to the cash box of the Recorder
while ilr. Hall was in office, and this fact,
taken with the defendant's excellent
character, had a great influence with the
'jury, seven members of which bad stood
out for acquittal to the last. .

SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 26. â Fine

factors contributing to the succees of the
race meeting here to-morrow, and fast

tunity of witnessing a bicycle contest be
tween men of national reputation, it is
eale to prophesy that the capacity of the

first race has been decided. The splendid
weather of the past few days has afforded
â¢â¢very opportunity for practice, and the
flyers are all in good trim for record
breaking.

AN ANGRY WOMAN'S DEED
Mrs. Mattie Hagan Seriously
Injures Her Husband, John
Hagan.
The Injured Man, to Shield Her,
Declares It Was an Ac.
eldest
Mrs. Mattie Hagan, young and win
some, but with sparkling eyes that tell of
a ferocious temper, last night plunged a
carving-knife into the breast of her jealous
husband.
Jack Hagan, devoted but suspicions, lay
on a cot at the Receiving Hospital, and
while the death sweat gathered on his
brow and the words of the hospital physi
cians that his recovery was doubtful still
rung horribly in his ears, reiterated a
clumsy fiction calculated to shield the
woman who had dealt the vicious blow.
About 10 o'clock last evening Hagan
rushed inio Hyer's grocery-store, at the
corner of Third and South Park streets,
with tie request that he be taken to a
rtoctor. Flingincopen his coat he showed
his shirt front and vest drenched in blood.
He was taken at onca to the Receiving
Hospital, where he said he was playing
en the sola with the baby in hts residence
at 33 South Park. He had a carving-knife
in tiis hand, and slipping from the sofx,
he fell upon the knife. This story he
stuck to throughout al interrogation.
The physicians at the hospital examined
the wound, and lound the left ln:.g badly
punctured and the aorta tadlv cut. He
was very weak from loss of blood, and the
doctors do not believe no can recover.
About an hour after the occurrence Mrs.
Matt;e Hacan, his wife, appeared at the
Receiving Hospi:al. She had no idea of
the enormity of the offense she had com
mitted, as she thought she had only given
him a slight rcratch.
"It was all his fault." was the only an
swer she would vouchsafe at first to in
quiries* as tothe nature of the husband's
wounds. Upon further questioning she
admitted that she did the cutting.
"He was always quarreling," she said.
"He was good to me. but he was awfully
jealous. He accused me of the worst
tbinjrs you cou.d imagine. Last night be
came home and 1 was drinking a glass ot
bfer. He doesn't drink, and tie would
have it that I Was drunk.
"Then he commenced abusing me. He
threw a chair, intendinc to hit me, and hit
my three-year-old baby. I had left the
baby on the lonrue, and he said I was
neglecting it and was too lazy to get. up
and take it in bed.
."Then he called me an awful name. I
won't allow any man to call me that, and
when be came near me I just pushed him
away with the carving-knife. It will
teach him a good lesson.
To the police she stated that her hus
band assaulted her with a ha.chet, and
shf used the knife in se!f-ttef?i;se.
Hagan is employed at an electrical es
tab.isbment on O'Farrell street.
His wife, who is a woman not over 22
years of ape, petite nr>d r tther pretty, was
formerly a Miss Homick of San JoÂ«e.
Her father is at present employed in Oak
land.
She was allowe i to return to her home,
but a policeman accompanied her to keep
guard on the premises.
Later. Hagan taid be was chopping
wood, an i his wife had the carving-knife
in her hand. In a ployfnl struggle for the
knife, he eaid, he was scratched.
All Well on the Rattler.
The schooner Eureka, which arrived last
night, reported that it had spoken the schooner
Rattler twenty miles iff Polm Reyes. The Rat
tler had 118 â â ea. skins uu board and wished to
report "all well."
'; There was a time when critical ale drinkers
despaired of getting a bottled ale free from
dreg and sediment, but to-day they delight in
the success of "Evans," because in it they see
the perfection of brewing and bottling. 6b er

a gathering of farmers in a large city
seems strange, but it is a fact that San
Francisco boasts of a large number of
farmers. They are not of tbe typical
granger order, suspenders fastened
to thin overalls Kith a fence-board nail,
tut, nevertheless, they are farmers. Many
of those who attend the meetings own
large farming properties which they man
age through an overseer, and others look
after their own properties and' make fly
ing trips to their possessions several times
a month to see that- the hired men are
properly caring for trie livestock and
poultry, pruning tbe iruit-trees and Tines
and to see how the cereal crops are pro
gressing.
Such was the nature of the gathering
last evening, ana oat of these gatherings
is growing a Sab Francisco larmers' club.
At a previous meeting a constitution was
framed. The matter of forming the club
was left in the hands of a committee, con
sisting of: H. H. Tr.ylor, chairman; Ed
ward F. Adams, Ernst A. Denicke, Alfred
Ho.man, 15. P. Finn, Philo D. Jewett and
P. B. Cornwall.
This committee reported that it recom
mended the organization oi suoh a club
under tbe constitution previously sub
mitted, and added:
We recommend that all persons desiring to
become members of said club be requested to
hand in their names and address with $150
for does for tbe first six months to Victor L.
O'Brien, 402 Montgomery street, who has con
tented to take charge of the same until the
organization of tbeclub. We recommend that
the club meet for organization at 8 P. X. on
Monday, April 5, at some place to be deter
mined later and announced through the press
by Mr. O'Brien.
About 60 people have signified their in
tention of joining the club and more are
expected. Not only are the actual farm
owner- interested in the club, but several
bank officials who hold mortgages on
country properties and real estate agents
are looking into the movement.
The lectures given at the institute meet
ings are particularly interesting to all
who own outside lands that they are de
sirous of improving. Last evening there
were two speakers. Pro eetor C. W. Wood
worth and Professor E. J. 'Wickson, The
former delivered an interesting discourse
on "Dairy Bacteria," in which he described
the minute organisms which multiply in
milk products. Some of these, he said, are
of great value ami others highly injurious
and dangerous. He dwelt at length upon
the relationship ol milk to typhoid fever
and consumption and told ol the danger
of spr 'aduiÃ these diseases in lacteal fluid
and ita products.
Professor Wickson's subject was
"Grasses and Foraee Plants lor California
Dairymen.'* Tne professor exhibited sev
eral dozen samples of good, baa and in
different forage plants, natural and im
ported, that are now growing in this BtatÂ«\
At to-night's meeting Proffssor E. W.

The Blf-rchants' Association.
The Merchants' Association directors re
solved yesterday to ask the Legislature to
amend the <Mvil Code to permit the lease of
City lots for fifty years; to oppose Senate bill
125 and Assembly bill 276, on the ground
that every application for a franchise, under
the terms of the bills, must be published and
also for other reasons; also to protest against
Senate bill 450, relative to work on streets
and sewers.
A request was received from Mayor Phelan
that tue board indorse the constitutional
amendment providing that sections 4 nnd 5
of Article XI of ;he constitution relating to
citie* and counties shall not apply to San
Francisco. Mayor Phelan nlso requested the
board to approve the act that has ueen intro
duced in the Legislature, ennbliug San Fran
cisco to limp.iiy and economize in. the special
eleCiion oi Freeholders to frame a new charter.
Both requests were granted, and tbe secre
tary was Instructed to send notices of its ac
tion to the Mayor and to the legislators. The
board decided to do all in its power to encour
age and assist the Golden Gate Carnival.

TWO DEAD AND
MORE DYING
Horrible Condition of an
Italian Family of
Eight.
They Ate Toadstools Instead of
Mushrooms and the Effect
Was Awfu 1 .
Four Doctors Labored in Van to
Keep Death Away From tha
Suffrers.
The Easseinas, four of them, the father,
mother and two children, are lying at
death's door from eating toadstools in
stead of mushrooms.
Two more of the children are dead, and
they are laid out on a bare table in the
room next to where foar doctors are try
ing to save the lives of the others.
Wednesday the two little boys, the ones
who are now dead, went out to the Presi
dio to gather mushroom*. They returned
with a pailful, and Thursday these were
cooked for the family.
Before nipht all were down with un
doubted signs of poisoning.
The children were the first to show
signs of the fatal mistake. The youngest
were taken with sharp pains in the stom
ach, and their faces and necks turned al
most black.
Then the father was taken down and
then the mother, and before yesterday
morning one child was dead, the other was
almost dead and the remainder of the
family were practically dying.
Sick as she was Mrs. Paratine left her
house and called in a doctor and then im
plored aid from tbe neighbors.
A Mrs. Adams who lives in the vicinity
was the first she appealed to, and when
Mrs. Adams reached the house a pitiful
sight met her eyes.
The children were all sick in one room.
The father was trying his best to help
them, although be himself could hardly
stand, and the two liltle Curpses added a
significant part of the melancholy pic
ture.
Last night the mother was better, in
fact practically out of danger, and the
father, too, was convalescent.
The remaining cnildren, however, are
still in a most precarious condition, and
the doctors are not sure that more may
not join the two silent little corpses on
the table.
Tbe Basaeina's live at 308 Lombard
street. The father is an Italian laborer
and bis family is not in wch-.0-do cir
cumstances.
The parents - are almost crazed with
grief.
TOR A NEW OHARTER.
The Mayor Submits a Bill to Cheapen
the Required Machinery.
Mayor Phelan has sent the following
letter to Senators Mahoney and Stratton
and Assemblyman North:
Senator Stratton, Chairman Senate Committee
on Kttctions, Senate thamber, Sacramtnto, Cat. â
Bear Sir: Inclosed is h uiait ot a bill, the
object of which is to lessen the cost of special
elections for ireeholdent or for tbe adoption of
charters for municipalities. It provides that
at such elections any number less than six
regular preciucts may be consolidated into
one, hnd further that the election boards at
such elections shall consist of two judges and
two clerics only, li also dispenses w iih the ne
cessity ot new registration by providing for the
use of the precinct registers utcd at the last pre
ceding general election, and also that supple
mental registration shall be had before such
election, so as to nitord electors whose names
do not appear on these registers or who may
have changed' tueir residence an opportunity
to vote at such election.
As there Is a strong sentiment in San Fran
cisco (tbe only large city in the State that has
not adopted a freehulaers' charter under the
new constitution) In favor of a new charter,
and it is proposed to hold a freeholders' elec
tion this year, v Is highly important that such
a law as tne one proposed be enacted at the
present session of the Legislature. The bi.l
was drawn by Garret W, AicEnerney, and it
meets with the Approval of the Registrar, W.
M. Hlnton. Mr. Hiuion lniormsme that if it
is enacted the cost of a treeholders' or charter
election wnl be reduced more tnan half.
I trust that the measure will be expedited.
Yours very truly, James I>. luklan.

WORLD OF SPORT.
The Tug-of-War Tournamentâ The Wheel, Cours
ing, Fishing and Trap-Shooting.
The events of importance to-day are the
championship cycling races at the Velo
drome track and the great tug-of-war in
the Mechanics' Pavilion this evening.
To-morrow there will be a 25-mile road
race, held under the auspices of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycl'ng Clubs; an inter
state coursing meeting at Ingleside Park,
rifle shooting at the Shell Mound and San
Rafael range*, trap shooting at Alameda,
handbali tournament at Olympic Clnb
grounds. The yachtsmen are making
ready for the opening of the sailing sea
son. In fact, all lines of sport are in a
healthy state.
THE WHEELMEN.
Santa Rosa Races To-Day and Big
25-Mlle Road Event To-Morrow.
Tiie cycling season may truly be said to
have opened for the year 1897 under most
favorable auspices. Last Sunday practi
cal, y marked its opening, when thousands
of wheelmen took advantage of the beau
tiiul weather for a spin in the park. Mon
day (Washington's birthday) gave them
another opportunity for riding in the fore
noon and lo visit the Velodrome races in
the afternoon, which many ot them did,
judging from the large attendance. To
day and to-morrow it is the same, with
plenty of racing events for those who like
ihum, and the prospects of good weather
and good roads for those who want to
ride.
This afternoon the first cycle champion
ship ever held by the Academic Athletic
League will take place at the Velodrome
at 2 o'clock. The entries and events were
given in The Call yesterday. The great
est interest, hov;ever, is centered on the
big gathering of professionals and ama
teurs at the Santa Rosa meet, the occasion
being tile opening of the State circuit.
This is expected to be one of the best
meets ever heJd in California from the
high class of the riders who will compete,
and it will oe attended by wheelmen from
ttus City, Oakland, San Jose and all the
"towns contiguous to Santa Rosa.
Then to-morrow there is the annual
twenty-flve-milo road race of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs â one of the
classic cycle road events of the year â
'Which will be held over the San Leandro
triangle, starting from San Leandro
promptly at 10 a. m. ->l ost of the riders
and officials will go over on the 8 a. m.
boat, except those who go to Santa Rosa,
and they will not get back until about
quarter to I). There are 102 entries in this
race, with handicaps varying from noth
ing to ten minutes. There are twenty-live
prises to be contested for, and a pretty
race should result. It must De remem
bered that at Saii Leandro spectators can
see the start, have the riders pass them
twice and be at the finish, as the course is
triangular in shape. It is therefore an
interesting race 10 attend and always
draws a Jargo crowd.
From ail over the country can be read
the criticisms of the cycling pr?ss anent
The recent National Assembly oi the
League of American Wheennen. .Bear
ings, the great Chicago weekly, says edi
torially in the last issue:
The National AssemDly of the League of
American Wheelmen this year did more talk
ing and leas work then ever before in the his
tory of the body. II reiused to ailow Sunday
â¢lac'ini: when the majority of the delegates de
manded it; It barred proiessionals from mem
"bership because a lew tociety cads tliougut
. thiu iheir lily white purity would be contam
inated by allowing men who made an honest
living by riding bicycles to belong to the same
organization as the blue-bioode i ones whose
l'utc.*] forefathers happened to settle in the.
Jimplre State several <vmuries ago; it would
have notliiag to do with the scheme lor con
trol of racing by :-tate boards. In fnct it re
fused to do anything that in any way would
â  better the League of American VVneelmen and
help to make ii oue of the moat poweriul ath
letic bodies i.i the world, it was a case of
spite. work and broken promises all the way
through, and it is not to be wondered at that
sensible men are disgusted with the actions
and treachery of some of the delegates. We
-could enumerate many other things that the
assembly failed to accomplish, but it would
â  take us a much shorter time to tell wnat it
really did. About the only business trans
acted was the election of Isaac B. Potter us
president, but that was ouly accomplished by
means of treachery, such, as most ward-healers
and plug-uglies would not deign to stoop to.
Nevertheless the wiiter commends the
election of Potter in another article as a
wise move, states he is a capable man and
: predicts that "with such a pilot at the
helm the good ship L. A. ~W. will weat-.er
all storms and sail into the port of Pros
perity the iareest athletic organization in
th,e v.orld." Yes, if it doesn't get wrecked
on the reefs of its own narrow-mindedness
and indiscretion.
Frank W. Fuller, who attended the Na
tional Assembly, L. A. \Y\, is expected
home to-morrow night at 8:45, ami Mr.
"Welch says he would not be surprised if
Judge Kerrigan was with him. The latter
will probably wire to some of his friends
liere in advance if he is on that train.
Mr. Welch showed a telegram yesterday
from H. 0. Fourton, president of the New
.Orleans Cement Track Association, as
showing the spirit of the Louisiana Divi
sion. It read: 'We are prepared to form
a league to promote cycling and Sunday
racing and admit professionals to mem
bership." This is about what will be
â¢ done, but no action will be taken until
after the National circuit ha* been here
.and gone, Is.te in April. Mr. Weich favors
more freedom for the divisions, and the
new league will be ao constructed.
The South California Division and its
Chief Consul, Monaghan, came in for a
large amount of criticism from various
Sources. Mr. Welch, speakin? of Mon
sghan, said: "Instead of assisting us at
..the assembly, as you would have tnoueht
a. man from our own State would have
done, that man Monaehan went there to
put obstacles in the way of what is abso
lutely essential to the good oi the league
in California, furthermore, it he was
honest in his representations the Sunday
racing proposition could not affect him or
his division in the least, as it would have
been left to divisional option and mey
"could easily have decided against it. Yet
it was the fcouth California Division that
rirst started racing on Sunday, and nearly
a score of professionals down there are
now under suspension 'or it, and the rail
road track at Santa Monica is blaeklUted
in consequence of permitting them to
use it."
Mouaghan was literally kicked out of
the WVsiern caucus at Albany, and was
' roundly hissed on the lloor of the assem
bly for his intemperate remarks ia the de
bate on admitting professionals to inem
â¢bership. Next to refusing all divisional
oution, the greatest nnstpke the assembly
made was in refusing the "pros." admis
sion to membership. And yet it came
within six votes of admitting negroes. The
Southern, Central and Western estates
won't lorjjet these things in a hurry.
And another thing, the North California
Division does not want the South Califor
nia Division to get the idea into its head
that the latter in any way assisted in
the passage of the Dacgape Dill re
cently before tte Legislature. Ta e
work was ali done by this d.vi
.Hion. the â¢ burden being borne by
CharJps Albert Adams. Percy V. Long and
1; T. Dwyer. The North California Divi
sion and the Cycle Board of Trade of San
Fr.mcisco paid all the expenses. Not a
cent came lrom ttie foutb, or assistance In
ar.y shaijo whatever. It will be equally
benefited witli this part of the State by
tiie passage of the m*-.i-ure, but what is
"jarring" Hie league cfhials here is that
the south la trying to tute the credit for
the good work, t>:tying what "we" did for
the wheelmen of Southern California.
Credit belongs where credit is due, and in
this borage- bill matter, the North Cali
fornia Division .ilone is en i itic-d to all of it
Captain J. S. Lewis of the San Francisco
Â£oad Club has called a rua for to-morrow,
to leave tne clubhouse at 8:30 o'clock and
take the 9 o'clock boat to San Leandro to
witness the California Associated Cycling
Clubs' twenty-hve-mile road race, in
which the club has a number of ili
strongest road riders entered. They have
trained patiectjv and expect to make a
good showing. The club presents a busy
scene every evening as the different riders
"plug out" from five to twenty and
twenty-five miles on the home trainer.
The club is at present in a very Nourish
ing condition and the directors are loot
ing for larger quarters, in which they can
erect a gymnasium. President O. R. Ster
ling is at present absent from the City,
but be is expected to return in time to
witness the race on Sunday.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen, led by
Captain Hadenfeldt, will have a run to
San Leandro to see the road race, taking
the 8:30 boat At the next regular meet
ing, March 9, there will be a lantern-slide
exhibition.
The piogramme for the big meet at San
Jose on Saturday, March 13, will include a
mile open, professional; mile open and
two-thirds of a mile handicap, amateur,
and the Ziegler-McFarlaud matches, best
two in three, mile ht-ats, for a parse of
$500. Michael, tno Welsh champion, will
make his first appearance on the coast at
this, meet, and may be matched at five
miles against W. E.Becker of Minneap
olis, the bolder of the world's record for
that distance. Becker has, come out with
a sweeping challenge to race Michael,
Loughead, Ziegler or any other man in
Dave Shafer's siring for a i.uge purse,
etc., etc. lam inclined to think any one
of these three will show him their rear
wheel in a match race at any distance.
Michael is said to be on his way out here
now, accompanied by !â '. Ed Spooner.
They are coming by the southern route
and are expected next week. Spalding.
THE ANGLER.
Thousands of Salmon Fry Will Bo
Liberated In Coast Streams.
The streams are now in splendid condi
tion for cteelhead fishing, and doubtless
there will be a rush of anglers to-day to
Point Reyes and Shellville. Next week,
it the weather continues fine, a party of
angiers will depart for the Russian River,
which large stream should soon be in good
order to receive its whippers.
It is hoped that tbe Fish Commission
ers will have a deputy patrol the Sonoma
Creek to-morrow, as it i:' reported that
an exhibition of fish-spearing will be held
not far distant from the tovvn of Glen
Ellen. A few weeks ago some large fish
were speared in the vicinity of Dr. O'Don
nell's ranch.
J. Â£. Locke, who managed in such a
successful manner midnight excursions to
the angling and hunting grounds between
Point Reyes and Duncans Mill?, is con
templating giving an excursion in the
very near future to Point Keyes.
Doubtless if an excursion was run from
this City to Point R â¢yes, leaving here on
Saturday evening at 8 or 9 o'clock so that
the anglers could enjoy a little sleep be
fore morning, quite a number of the
patron* of tue sport would take advantage
of the trip and the early fishing.
Should Governor Budd sign the game
bill before Saturday next, then a special
sportsman's train to Duncans Mills would
be very well patronized, as hunters would
have Sunday to -hoot quail and duck and
the anglers would certainly enjoy good
snort in the tidewaters of the Paper-mill
and Russian River. An excursion should
not leave this City later, if po-sible, than
8 p. m , as sportsmen and anglers are as
anxious to catch a few hours' bleep ns any
other class of men.
Within the next few days the California
Fish Commissioners will liberate 750.0J0
salmon fry in the streams of central Cali
fornia. These little feilovrs were incubated
in tbe Bear Valley hatchery, in Marin
County. They will bs released in Run
sian River and its tributaries, Paper-mill
Creek and its tributaries, Olema Creek
an-d its tributaries and in the Bear Valley
Creek. Ihe United States Fish Commis
sion was made aware of this fact ana has
sent word to A. B. Alexander to proceed
at on re to the iiatchery and make a study
of the salmon fry, its habits, rale of
growth, fooa, movement and enemies.
During the late heavy rainstorm several
thousand fry were destroyed by an over-
How of water from tbe hills which flooded
the breeding department of the Bear Val
ley Hatchery and washed away the little
fisnes. Fortunately the attendants by
hard and persistent toil saved the lives of
several thousand youngsters. The little
fellows will now be given their freedom,
and it is hoped that the experiment will
prove a success. The eggs were shipped
from the Siason hatchery to the Bear Val
ley hatchery som month i ago. Expens
in fish culture are ot the opinion that the
salmon fry will immediately seek the"
ocean where they will wax fat and strong.
Anglers will be interested in Assembly
bill 451, approved by the Governor yester
day, and now in full force and effect. It
prohibits the taking, etc., of salmon

THE POOLROOMS
MUST BE CLOSED
Judge Wallace Sounded
Their Death Knell
Yesterday.
John Glynn Was Promptly Re
manded to the Custody of
Sheriff Whelan.
Judgj Campbell's Decision Was Upheld
and the Ordinance Was Cordially
Commended.
Judge Wallace yesterday delivered an
opinion sustaining the conviction of Pool*
seller John Glynn by Police Judge â¢Camp
bell. This is a hard blow at tbe down
town poolrooms, and if the law be enforced
by the police, all such resoits wiil be
closed in short order.
Judge Wallace declared that Judge
Campbell aid exactly right in convicting
Glynn, and said that the penalty of $100
fine was not excessive, so the defendant
will have to pay or go to jail, and in the
meantime if he persist in pursuing his
business of poolselling he will lay himself
liable to further punishment.
The ordinance under which Glynn was
prosecuted was passed by the Supervisors
of this City about two months ago, and it
was decided to make Glynn's case a test
case, as about a oozen other trials in the
Police Court are still pending, for the pur
pose of securing Judg? Wallace's ruling in
regard to tbe constitutionality of the
enactment.
Judge Wallace said that the ordinance
was not oniy constitutional and valid, but
that its merits from the standpoint of
public policy are such that it commends
itself to tbo approval of the courts and the
community.
The ordinance was drawn to circumvent
all the iake pretensions of the downtown
poolselle.-s that they were collecting com
missions for placing bets on the races at
Ingleside, wben, in tact, no such trans
actions were possible, but even if the
placing of such bets had not been pre
vented by the managers of the racetrack,
yet the ordinance was sufficient to sup
press tliese clandestine deadfalls that have
been the ruin of so many young men and
bo vs.
Attorney Dunne argued on behalf of the
defendant that the new ordinance was
oppressive and unjust, as 'he thought it
deprived his clients of the privilege of
conducting a lucrative bu-iness which the
constitution of the State allowed them to
carry on.
Judge Wallace tbousht there was no
merit in this contention. He held that
the power of the community to enact and
enforce proper poiics regulations cannot
be legally disputed, and said that, in this
case there was no ground for disturbing
the judgment of the court below. The
prisoner was therefore remanded to the
ctmody of the Sheriff.
fha courtroom was full of pool-sellers
and their cappers when Judge Wallace
started to pive his opinion, but they
quickly perceivid the drift of his re
marks, and, foreseeing the conclusion that
lie was about to announce, they began to
leave, so that by the time ihe remarks of
the court were finished the only friends of
Glynn left to siand by him were his law
yers and Bailiff Curtis, who stood ready to
give him safe conduct to jail.

What a sorry day it was for favorites
.â¢ iud their followers at Ingleside yesterday.
â¢ Outsiders that were not conceded a chance
. for first place came floating past the
stand, setting at defiance all laws of the
"depisfs" and handicappers. It would
have taken several pipefuJs to convince
Oneof the regulars before the sport opened
that .Nebula would defeat Good Times and
Haward S,' yet it came to pa-is. The
Brutus fiily took the two colts mentioned
into cab)p at odda of 25 and 30 to 1. Ana
â¢ basis-, another entry of Boots & Son, was
successful at 25 to L Of the seven favor
. 'yes two only had their numbers hoisted on
r> irobably the win of Nebula was the
"most unexpected of the day. She was
one of six starters in the mile dash for
three-year-olds, for which Good Times.
naden.by Cash Sloan, was an even-money
chance. . The latter was pocketed at the
6rtt turn, -cut off eighty yards from the
wire and failed to pet a mark. Nebula,
â ridden "by Piggott, cut out the pace from
theoutset and lasted long enough to beat
the.. -wretchedly ridden Howard S by a
bead in 1:43] 4 . The favorite, after being
shut off. Jailed to chow, finishing fourth,
behind t>oniro.
. The mile race in which Altamax started
some days ago seemed to have done him
a world ot good, for he came out iD the
opening six-furlong scramble for maiden
tiiree-year-olds against an ordinary
lot- of platers and won hands down
from Queen Nubia, an outsider. Tulare,
a 4 to 1 chance ridden by Tod Sloan, was
a lair tbird. AMicus was poorly handled.
The race following was a split of the
;ir?t, with ten facing the barrier. Philip
11, Nuncomar and Peaceman, trained by
Ki.ly ' Murry, coupled in the betting,
opened, favorite at 3 to 2, but there ap
. Pear-ed .io be "nothin' doin' " and 4to 1
was chalked againat the trio at post time.
A big plunge was made on Yuraa, send
ing him to the post a2to 1 choice. An
other heavy play was made on Barney
Schreiber's Charlemagne, cutting his price
. from sto 3. When the barrier was raised
â  Thorpe, on the 25 to 1 outsider Anabasis,
â  -rushed that horse out in the lead and,
although hard ridden, Charlemagne was
beaten out a length by the outsider in
1:17. Philip H waÂ« a good third.
The fourth event, over seven furlongs,
saw George Palmer go to the post a 3 to 5
choice and finish third. lia-quil at 6to 1
jumped away in the lead and was never
caught, passing the judges two lengths be
fore Instigator.
â¢ The mile and a sixteenth race proved a
. .good thing for Joe Terry, the 13 to 5 sec
ond cnoico. AdoipJi Spreckels, tne 6to 5
' choice, appeared sore and unable to ez
l himself. Terry made all the running,
â¢on eased up from Little Cripple, a

INGLESIDE TRACK'S GREAT CARD.
The Fastest Lot of Sprinters Ever Gath
ered â  ered lit California Meet To- Day.
The programme to-day at Ingleside is
one to exult over. It is one of the best
ever offered local racegoer?. A faster band
of sprinters have seldom met than the
eight entered in the last race of the day,
including among them David, Ferrler,
Libertine, Preston, Magnet and Bnckwa.
It is a collection of speed seldom brought
together, and the finish should be worth
going along way to witness. The mile
handicap also has a splendid lot of entries,
while the two-year-old division will be
represented by the Schreiber stake, worth
$1300.
The judges at Ingleside have requested
Secretary Leake to notify Trainer William
Hurry of the Cambridge and Lone stables
that the inconsistent running of the
horses in his charge will do no longer tol
erated. In the communication the offi
cials say Mr. Murry's explanations are
not in keeping with the rules. of racing,
and that a repetition of the same after
this date will cause a recommendation for
the refusal of his entries and further pun
ishment to him as may hereafter be de
termined. â¢
The officials in the stand also recom
mend that the entry of Greyhurst be re
fused at Ingleside until such time as
Owner Griffin can assure them that the
I horse is educated to break from the bar
rier.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1897.
BUTLER HELD ON
BOTH CHARGES
Commissioner Heacock So
Ruled Yesterday After
noon.
Attorney Donohoe Grew De
cidediy Dramatic During
His Argument.
He Denounc3d the Prisoner in Un
m^asur^d Term? as a Most
Abandoned Villain
Attorney Donohoe, in the course of hi 9
argument before Commissioner Heacock
in the Ashe extradition proceedings yes
terday afternoon, created a deep sensation
by bis personal references to the pris
oner. The climfix was reached when, af
ter graphically describing the murder of
young Preston, he began to speak of the
Lee Weller case, which pioved the pris
oner's undoing. Turning to the latter he
said:
"How you mast regret, Butler, tbe day
that you, by your aevilish wit, lurod him
to accompany you."
The prisoner shrank before the men
acing finger of the attorney, and mut
tered: "Don't talk to me like that." Mr.
Donohoe was merciless and continued in
tones hi thunder:
"How you must say to yourself, 'Oh,
that 1 had had nothing to do with thai
.Lee Welier and that I hnd only lured to
my cbarnel den among the mountains the
beardless boy. whose disappearance caused
no comment 1'
"Bat, no, your eyes were blinded by your
greed for his gold nieces, for his poor

Commissioner Heacock listened lor four
hoursyesierday to counsel's argument and
in his subsequent ruling nnucsitatingly
decided to hold the prisoner upon both
charges on the ground that the evidence
adduced shows iÂ«utricient criminality on
big part. A certified copy of the evidence
will bu transmitted to the Secretary of
State, and the prisoner wili remain in the
custody of the Uniied States Marshal un
til the "President's order for his surrendet
i is received.
Tha argument yesterday was conducted
in the Commissioner's office, in the Ap
praisers' building, and was attended by
mosi of the witnesses in the case, includ
ing the Consui-General, J. W. Wurburton,
Detectives Roche and McHattie, Constable
Conroy, Marshal Baldwin, Sergeant Ban
ner, Capuin Fraser of the SwanhilJa,
and a group of privileged listeners. The
prisoner, guarded by Deputy Marshal
Gallagher, sustained the ordeal with bis
customary stolidity, and in the face of
the flood of denunciation which Mr. Dono
hue, Mr. Corinac's colleague in the prose
cution, poured upon him, showed scarcely
a trace of emotion. It is true that his
sang troid gave way a little when the
prosecuting attorney addressed him per
sonally, and with a dramatic gesture
charged him almost directly with the
crime of murder; but for the most part he
preserved bis favorite nonchalan t attitude,
his arms folded and face riveted upon
tbe ceiling.
Mr. t onuflc opened the argument for
the prosecution at 10 o'clock, Mr. Black,
the prisoner's counsel followed, and .Mr.
Donoboe closed at greater length in reply.
While Mr. Cormac confined himself
strictly to an elucidation of the evidence,
hi* partner frequently indulged in ora
torical flights an i eloquently emphasized
tbe paiheiic aspects of both case?.
Mr. Blacic rested nis defense mainly
upon his mmiliar objection to the court's
' jurisdiction and argued that the essential
| principle* of international law expressly
' constitute a vessel the actual territory of
the nation whose flag she flies, and that
the Swanhilila, thcreiure, was British ter
ritory wherever she might chance to be.
The arrest for this reason was illegal, and
the prisoner could not be arrested m Cali
fornia waters under these conditions, ex
cept for some offense commuted against
the laws of California. Tbe treaty was not
self-acting and must be put into operation
by the statute.
He raised another Important objection
witb reference to the interpretation of the
treaty, asserting that Judges and magis
trates could only act in accordance witb
iv provisions when so authorized by an
act of Congress.
Mr. Donoboe then rose to reply. Coun
sel for tbe crown, he contended, were not
there to prosecute, nor would the present
tribunal determine the question of the
prisoner's guilt or innocence. The main
evidence, both for the prosecution and
the defense, must be considered by a
Judge and jury m New South Wales, and
â¢'in that investigation," he continued,
"the prisoner will be protected by all
tbose safeguards which the experien c of
te t centuries has woven into the fabric of
the common law.
"The sole question for your determina
tion," he said, ''is whether we hare made
put a sufficient priina facie case to satiÂ»f c
the Secretary ot State that this man
should be returned to the authorities to
stand his trial. And lam glad that this
disgusting battle will be fought out in an
other land. I respectfully submit that
durine the entire period since California
was admitted into the sisterhood of States
we have never harbored a wretch so desti
tute of human attributes, so wantonly de
praved, bruiul, cool and calculating, so
ogrellke in his disposition, so reckless and
yet withal so cowardly. That desperate
man who bolds up a stagecoach and robs
the passengers at the pistol's point is ad
mittedly a scoundrel, but he is not neces
sarily a coward.
"The burglar who enter* the household
armed with a bludgeon and revolver is a
scoundrel, but not necessarily a coward.
In California we have known many in
stances of murder when the blood was
hot, when green-eyed jealousy was the
motive, to avenge outraged honor, and
from lust, but never, thank God, have we
known of a series of atrocious murders to
be perpetrated from purely mercenary
motives. Of such crimes does this man
stand accused in hit own country and for
â¢itch crimes must his guilt be determined
or his innocence established."
Mr. Donohoe said, referring to Mr.
Black's objection as to jurisdiction, that
under the lti w of this State the committing
magistrate hud the right to inquire into
any crime if the criminal was brought be
fore hini, and that any question of terri
torial jurisdiction must be raised by the
Government. Tho mere statement 6f the
proposition that an accused prisoner
could raise such a question was one of
those arguments whicu bore upon its face
its own refutation.
His introduction naturally led Mr.
Dononoe to sp^ak of the defendant, to
whom he referred as "this smooth-spoken,
resourceful gentleman, who held the
golden key of the treasure-land across the
mountains. After Preston's death, this
fowler lost no time in bating his trap (or
another victim." Later on the prisoner
was accrioed as a "human spider," and
then the language quoted in t: c opening
parueraph was forcibly employed.
"Welier," said Mr. Donohoe, "had
scores of friends in Sydney â the very dogs
knew and loved him. 11,I 1 , is on record that
he told hundreds of people about the
prospecting trip. It is true that he did
not mention the name of the person with
whom he was going."
Warming with bia subject, the speaker
asked: "Is it possible that no foreboding
suggested tself at that time? Could he
not read the warning in that man's face?"
indicating the prisoner with a gesture.
"These indications are so apparent that a
landsman would as soon think of trust
ing his life to tne kindly cuidauce of a
ground shark as to this defendant.
"1 do not believe," concluded Air. Dono
hoe, "that there is one human being in
this fair City who is 80 sodden with sin
and dead to manly impulse that be would
desire to keep this craven, this murderous
brute, one moment iouger than is neces
sary. I therefore ask that he be handed
over to the authorities of Great Britain,
and that you so certify to the Secretary of
State that he may be returned to the
country whence he came to stand his
trial."
The court said:
It is hardly necessary for me to review the
evidence. 1 huve no written opinion and
seldom inuke une, I prefer to decide a case
when it is first submitted nnd everything is
fresh in my mind. Tne main aigumeni on
the part of the prisoner's counsel with regard
to the jurisdiction of the CoinmUsh ncr, or of
any party, to inquire into tne criminality of
the prisoner upon tutse charges, that he came
to this country on board a British ship, ana
that that British snip, being covered by
a flag, was British territory, I think
with counsel for me crown that it would be
strange indeed ii such questions could be
raised as between individuals, on the part of
the prisoner, to proieet him lrom a prosecu
tion for the crime with whicn he stands
charged. Such provisions are rather for the
benefit of the contracting nations as between
themselves and do not pertain to this case.
But the language of ti.e treaty is, ' 4 \Vho shall
seek an asylum" iv the other country or who
shall be found therein. It appearb from the
testimony that the prisoner at the oar came
voluntarily aboard the Swanhilua as an able
seaman ; lie was coming to San Francisco ; he
Itfnew tne port to which he was coming.
There are certain circumstances detailed by
Captain Frascr which teud to show that he
intended to stop here; that he wished to dis
guise himself; that he wished to come ashore
before the vessel nac really leached land and
gut another job here. And I think it is v lair
linding Irom the testimony that he was a
fugitive from justice coming here.
He Â«as arrested onthesbiD. Counsel con
tends that the Â«ords "seeking asylum" have
beeu left out of the act ol Congress, and that
as the treaty is not soli-acting and as Congress
has not authorized its officers to act except
wnea the prisoner is lound within the United
States, that therefore, we have no jurisdicion.
Upon that question I will cite in re Kaine,
Decisions ol the Supreme Court, volume 20,
page 66: 'â The ireaiy with Great Britain is
equally binding uroii us hb an act of Cou
gies.s, and it liken in- confers jurisdiction and
authority on the Judges and magistrates of
the respective Goveriiinents to lsbue warrants
for the npprelienMon oi lugidves and for hear-
Ing and considering the evidence produced
:. r .:ui:^t them, and n.s<> provides that the com
mitting mugistrate shah certify as io tbe suffi
ciency ol the evidence to the executive au
thority, so that a warrant oi surrender may
issue."
Thus the court hoi, is that the treaty is in
this respect self-acting, and that it needed no
ace of Cougrcas to give the Judges and magis
trates additional powers. If there be ques
tions touching the jurisdiction of ihe Commis
sioner, v/hic-h may be construed as ot vital
import, 1 shall leavÂ« them to some other tribu
nal less impressed with the criminality ln
voived and shown by the testimony and* the
charges against \hv prisoner, and 10 some tri
bunal that is perhaps less impressed than 1
am with the importance of such technicali
ties, which, though they may sometimes pÂ»o
--tect the innocent, oUcner open up avenues of
escape o the uuniy.
The court continued that as to the evi
dence of criminality there were the fol
lowing circumstances to be considered:
The connection of Weller and Preston
with tiie prisoner; the testimorry of wit
nesses lo the fact of tneir beiug seen to
gether gradually going into the Blue
Mountains â where gold is never found â
hunting lor nold ; the inducement held
out by the prisoner to each; the discov
ery of the bodies within ten or twelve
miles of each other, and in one case a
mile and a half from the spot where a
witness testified that be bad seen them
together. In tbo Lee Weller case it was
admitted that there was sufficient evi
dence for the Commissioner to hold tiie
prisoner. Then he continued:
If there was ever a case that Shakespeare
could possibly have imagined wherein one
should â¢â¢steal the livery of heaven to serve the
devil in" it is in the case of Lee Weller, for nil
the certificates by which the prisoner claimed
to be a master seaman were stolen from the
deceased, and here when I asked his name he
nrÂ«t answered "Lee Weller 'until the evidence
confronted him with the fact that the bouy
haa been foun.i. and then he had to abandon
the idea that he could pass himself off upon
the Commissioner as the reiti Lee Weller.
Wheii asked whu.se picture the photograph
of Mrs. Lee Weller was he replied, '-That is a
picture of my wile." But mark you, there is
a change later, for when the Commissioner
began to examine him in the Preston murder
ca*e he stood mute and refused to answer.
I Rhall hold him tv answer upon both
chttgus, believing the evidence shows suf
ficient criminality on his part, and sliuli trans
mi' a certified copy of the evidence to the
Secretary of State us soon as possible, and
shall commit the prisoner into the custody of
tiie Marshal until v o:il is received from "the
Presideut, ordering his extrHdition, and I
shall later make, an order impounding such
property as may be necessary.

CONVICTED, BUT INNOCENT.
Thomas Thompson Is Probably a Vic
tim of Mistaken Identity.
Attorney FranKlin V. Brooks has suc
ceeded in shaking Judge Wallace's faith
in Jhe vprdict of the jury that declared
Thomas Thompson guilty of stealing State
Senator Mahoney's watch on the night of
the Corbett-Sharkey pnzeli.'ht.
As a consequence of toe doubts in the
Judicial mind the sentence of Thompson
lias been postponed until March 26 and at
that lime it is expected that a new trial
will be cranted, with a prospect of the
District Attorney practically abandoning
the prosecution. There is a general belief
that Thompson is a victim of mistaken
identity.
In arguing for a new trial on behalf of
his client Lawyer Brooks set forth the
fact that on the tirst trial there was a dis
agreement, only two members of the jury
voting for conviction. He said that on
t he second trial Juror Lezynsky was asleep
during the taking of important testimony,
as well as while the arguments and in
structions of the court were being deliv
ered.
Thompson is an honest-looking indi
vidual, without any of the characteristics
of tiie professional criminal. He told a
straight story of his career in this Civ
tnat impressed all who heard it, but the
jury evidently formed the judgment of
convic:ion on the testimony of the men
who swore that Thompson wan the man
who pawned the watch. An effort to dis
credit this testimony will be made if an
other trial should be granted. Thompson
ii without lunds or acquaintances and his
attorney is acting under appointment
by toe court.
LIFE INSURANCE. .
FIFTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT
OF THE
COMECTICDT MUTUAL LIFE
lIVSURASCE COMPANY.
To the Members:
The year 1896 was marked by almost unre-
mitting commercial depression affecting every
Interest ana by serious disturbances in the
public finances producing apprehensions more
or less approaching panic for nearly the entire
period, both conditions having their origin
largely in those questions which became the
issues in a political campaign which, for the
critical gravity of the results involved and the
intensity of feeling engendered, has had no
parallel in our history. '
In such a year enterprise loses much of its
usual reward, and the best results in nearly
any business are those accomplished at least I
cost while maintaining the efficiency of the I
working machinery and awaiting such favor-
able change bS will allow a satisfactory
amount oi business to be done at usual cost
and without strain.
Effect on Business.
Especially is this true in the business of iife
insurance. Its cost is usually reckoned as a
part of one's expenses; and when money is
hard to come at and profits are little, and per-
haps nothing, new expenses are not readily
undertaken, the usual ones are often curtailed
and business shrinks. Under such conditions
a large volume of new business can be main-
tained in only one woy; by such concessions
on the first premium as tempt a new insurer
to taKe a policy which costs him little or noth-
ing the first year, and which he gets at the ex-
pense of the older policy-holders, whose money
has to make up the deficiency caused by what
the "new blood" costs but fails to pay.
Were uny given quantity of new business In
nny one year necessary to the stability of a
companyâ as it might be were the company
new and its amount at risK as yet too small for
a safe average experience there might be a
reason for keeping up a pace even at increased
cost, if the business so got were likely to stay
by. But there is no company of our class doing
business to-day in any such situation ; nor any
which cannot afford to let its new business vary
with the conditions affecting the volume of
every other business, except those which have
attached to the simple methods of legitimate
life insurance certain wholly extraneous fea-
tures which create necessities of ther own
and dominate the situation. The "accumu-
lated dividend" companies, some of which are
losing $125,000,000 and upward Of old busi-
ness every year, and must keep a very great
amount of business going in order to keep up
the lapses ana forfeitures necessary to pro-
vide their "accumulated surplus" or tontine
fund, have tried to educate the public to be-
lieve that a great "new business" and a great
"amount of risk" were the true measures of
success, and may feel that their choice lies
between keeping up the inflow at any cost, by
any effective means, and such a shrinkage as
they cannot Contemplate with equanimity.
However, that may be, the vicious ttnd costly
methods of competition arc continued.
An Ideal Position.
The Connecticut Mutual is happily under
the stress of no circumstances, natural or ar-
tificial, requiring it to force its business be-
youd the conditions of the times. Its position
is ideal, and that to which every company
ought to strive to obtain, a business so large
as to give absolute stability in its average ex-
perience, yet not to large bur that in good
times ami under fair conditions it can be
maintained without difficulty, even allowing
for occasional and considerable shrinkages in
bad times, . a standard of solvency beyond
question, investments worthy such a trust,
and an expense account so small as tOfcive the
largest possible Having to policy-holders and
bo adjusted that, whether its business in-
creases oi shrinks, it will not have to cut its
dividends on that account.
That is the position we occupy. So far as
the absolute safety of every present policy-
holder is concerned, or so l'ar as bis future
dividends would be effected, it is not neces-
sary that we should ever write another new
policy. The company would pay out to the
very last man and maintain the same relative
high dividends without it. The only reason
for taking new business is that we may give to
new families the same secure and cheap pro-
tection that those of our present members are
getting. The latter nave no need whatever
for any new business. And, therefore, it is
that, among all tho struggles for first place as
to new business and amount at risk among the
large companies and those of the smaller ones
to keep somewhere in the race, the Connecti-
cut Mutual has steadily refused to compete for
new business at the cost of present policy-
holders. What we can get without reducing
their dividends we take; what we can't
goes to those whoso inducements to agents
and whose speculative proposals - and mo-
mentary temptations to new men are great,
but whose dividends to old members are
smaller. In good times we more or less en-
large our business. In hard times we husband
our strength, indifferent to all considerations
except maintaining our standard of excel-
lence. â¢
We are thus explicit, not only because the
matter is apt to these times, but also because
in the competition of business it is commonly
represented by those whose only point of com-
parison with us is in respect of new business
and amount at risk that it is undesirable to
insure in a company which is not rapidly in-
creasing itsbustness; that expenses would be
less, dividends larger and security greater if
we were pushing harder for new business and
getting more of it â a statement which is false
to every aspect and particular. There must
come a point with every company, no matter
how rapid its present growth, beyond which it
Cannot force an increase of size. And several
of the largest companies are rapidly approach-
ing that point. What will be their status
then ? Should the public, therefore, turn irom
them ? If they wilt be then undesirable com-
panies, why should they be built up at all ?
If a company be truly desirable, prosperous
and safe only while and only as it is increas-
ing its risks, then the more rapidly a company
is growing to-day the faster it is approaching
the time when ii will be no longer desirable,
prosperous or safe. If that be so, 'life insur-
ance should .be summarily suppressed as an
Inevitable swindle.
But, as our expense rate Is less than that of
any other company, and only about half that
of the great pushers, white our results to
policy-holders are very much larger than
theirs, and our stability greater and more
conservatively based, the advantage to be de-
rived from following their example would
seem more than doubtful, especially in view
of the heavy and continuous reductions they
have made and are still making in their divi-
dends, while we have maintained our -scale.
The reproach of such a conservatism we are very
content to bear. â  The vigor of the oak is of an
enduring sort. â 
--- . Review of the Year.
Notwithstanding the dullness of the year
1896, the affairs oi the company in every essen-
tial particular were as prosperous as could be
reasonably expected under the conditions. A
gain in income, assets and surplus, while earn-
ing an increased dividendâ an increase of
strength more thnn corresponding- with the
Increase in liabilities, while decreasing the
cost of insurance- --may, in such times, well be
regarded as fairly satisfactory.
. The operations of the year, as covered by our
report to the Insurance Department, are as

â  We received for interact and dividends $2,-
-834,953 31 ; for rents, 254,446 91. The dull-
ness of the times made collections unusually
slow. Yet the overdue interest on December
31, 1890. on nearly $36,000,000 of mortgage
loans was only $150,400 71, about $30,000 of
which has since been received. ' â ySjgbBBMBIIP

loans made was much smaller than usual; a
natural result of the conditions which made it
hard to get money to pay with and also made
less use for borrowed money. Old loans were
paid amounting to $5,560,110 40 and new
loans were made for $5,202,279 87.
Foreclosures and .Sales.
Other results of the hard time* were the
prolonged inability of many to pay interest,
compelling us to take under foreclosures
properties costing $1,233,028 08. and also a
great dead ness in the real estate market by
reason ,of which comparatively few sales |
were made, amounting to $124,325 33. There i
were a eood many iuquiries after properly,
but most of them were made in the hope that
the pressure of the times might dispose us to
otter at low price;. Wo are fortunate. v able
to hold our property until usual conditions
restore usual prices.
The advantage of being able to do this Is
well illustrated in our own history. Since
.1879 the company has sola properties which
it had then acquired under foreclosure ,at a.
cost of - $7,531,018 30. In an . examination
made that year the Insurance Commissioner
valued these properties at only 5jttj, 445,773, an
apparent loss of $1.085,845 30. But we did-
not sell at those figures. We waited and sold
as the market wanted it, for $B,9'_*2,tÂ»sG 31, or
$1,391,038 01 more than the property cost;
and $2,476.883 31 more than the Commis-
sioner's valuation.
While some of our properties will not prob-
ably sell for as much us they cost, others will
sell for more, and. judging from past experi-
ence, we see no reason to apprehend any less
on this Item as a whole. â  ; â 
Bond Transactions and Holdings.
There were paid off or sold during the year j
municipal and railroad bonds which cost us
$8t>4,633 30. and other bonds purchased at a
cost oi $783,610 44. The market value of
such securities in general was considerably
less on December 31, 1896, than on December
31, 1895. The shrinkage on our holdings was,
however, only two-thirds of 1 per cent. These
holdings are ft r $13,285,000 par value, cost-
ing $13,606,034 97, and worth at the above
date $14,058,907 by an entirely conservative
valuation. . : : -v
-..â¢_â , Profit find Lost.
A small net loss of $13,105 87 on some of
the real estate sales ana sundry items whs off-
set by a net gain of $63,246 62, mainly on
transactions in bonds, leaving $50,140 75 to
the good.
Mortality.
We paid to the families and estates of de-
ceased members during the year $4,106,366 25.
The value and timeliness of this great sum to
its many recipients in their hour of need are
the measure of our yearly service to the house-
holds oi our country, its helpfulness can be
somewhat realized if one will but Imagine
that amount being constantly distributed
among cases like some that will occur to any
of us, and wilt think what it has meant to
them, or would have meant to those who did
not have it. It is an unmixed good, coming
when the necessity for such help is greatest.
Our death losses were ho far inside those ex-
pected and provided for that the savings there-
lrom were $436,689.
It should always be borne in mind that it is
not the amount of a company's death losses
nor their proportion to its amount at risk, nor
to its income or its assets watch are signifi-
cant of their effect upon its prosperity, present
or future. The older its business, the longer
it has been in force, the greater the average
age of its members, tie greater will be the
proportion of deaths and me volume oUosses.
The question is not only what losses have oc-
curred, but what were expected. What losses
were anticipated when the premiums and re-
serves to meet them were computed? Are the
actual losses inside or outside that expecta-
tion?. That is the only pertinent question in
the matter.
Expenses.
The ratio of expenses to income in 1896 was
10.55 per cent, an increase over the usual
average of about one-half of 1 percent. This
was due to no increase in the cost of getting
business or in any general expense, but solely
to the increased cost oi repairs to real estate
taken under Joreclosure and necessary to put
it in proper order and to rightly protect our
property. The same careful aud systematic
economy which always distinguishes this
company has been ricidly maintained.
New Busineaa.
' In consequence of the unbroken business
depression tit 1896, ana especially during the
months of the political campaign, and because
we spent no money trying to overcome these
obstacles, we wrote about 10 per cent less new
business in 1896 than in 1895. The renewals
of old business were so well kept up, however,
that we lost during the year on the whole
amount in force only $619,430.
We believe the persistency of the old busi-
ness of tne Connecticut Mutual is jquite
unique. It is an element of great strength,
and of cheapness as well. It costs tar less to
take sucu care of old business as to keep it
than to get new to replace it. And we are
fortunat-ly not in the position ot those com-
panies whose heavy expenses can be met and
whose extravagant representations of "post-
poned or accumulated dividends," to be paid
hfieen or twenty years hence, can be iulfiwei
only by the proceeds of heavy forfeitures of
old business every year.
Dividends.
â  The dividend paid on each policy in 1896
was larger than the corresponding one tor
1895. There will be a similar increase in divi-
dends and consequent decrease in the cost of
insurance on policies renewed in 1897.
Surplus.
We call attention to those items from which
it is possible to derive a surplus and to the
manuer iv which they have been applied
during the year, with a preliminary word of
explanation. 1
We agree to pay certain sums on the occur-
rence of a certain event. To do this we must
have premiums large enough to pay running
expenses, the current death claims, and pro-
vide a reserve for the greater mortality that
will come with the increasing age of the busi-
ness. We can earn interest on that reserve
while we hold it. to we assume a maximum
death rate, a maximum expense rate and a
minimum rate of interest, and calculate our
premiums and the reserve to be laid aside out
of them on those three assumptions. If
the death losses and expenses are less
than we assumed we save the difference
from the premium; if the Interest is more we
save that also. Taere are sundry other inci-
dental items. Here is an exhibit of the opera-
tion oi these several factors in the Connecti-
cut Mutual in 1896:

This total of items applicable to expensea,

1 The only item in this exhibit which does not
explain itself is probably the saving from the
, reserve on policies . surrendered or not re-
newedâ sl29,7s9. This grows out of lapsed
andrurrendereu policies (less those reinstated)
for $5,860,703, the reserve upon which was
$961,577, of which amount $831,818 or about
. 87 cent, was returned to the policy-hold-
ers in paid-up insurance, cash or otherwise,
' leaving the saving mentioned $129,759. This
saving covers some policies which had not
been in force long enough to have a value;
but it is principally made up of a small neces-
sary charge made upon each surrendered pol-
icy to help in replacing the business so lost, to
cover the cost of the change and to protect the
company against the impaired vitality caused
by the voluntary witndrawal of sound lives.
Let it be noted that were iv; doing a tontine
or speculative "investment" business the
whole $961,577 of reserve and all the surplus
it had accumulated would have gone into the
"pooL"
A similar, exhibit of the items available for
expenses, etc., and their application lor, say,
the last fifteen years, will be interesting in
this connection.

ness the wh01e511,337.131 and all the surplus
accumulated by it would have pom' into the
'â¢pool' for . the iucky ones to dividi â or so .
much as whs not eaten up by the expenses of
pushing lor new blood.
Similnr exhibits by the great group of com-
panies doing that sort of business would be
very Interesting. They would mark as noth-
ing else ever can the precise character, the
enormous magnitude and tne startling signifi-
cance of the gambling in life insurance carri.'d
on for the last twenty-five years or more and
now involving, annually policie3 to the
j amonnt of mnny hundred million dollars,
policies which ought to be sacred to the pro-
tection of the famines whom they do not
guard, which are not taken to guard the
family, but with intent to share in what others
are to lose.
Moreover, such exhibits by those companies
would slow those people who have lapsed and
forfeited those policies and the surplus already
accrued on them where their monpy goes;
and would show those who have won in the
speculation, where their money liÂ»s come
from, and "would show them also why their
speculation hasn't turned out half as big as
, the "estimates by which they were led into it.
.Excess of Strength Above Legal '
: ..-ji ; Standard.
Whoever has occasion to observe the state-
ments of this company, Â»s published by the
several State Insurance Department reports,
â will notice that they credit us with a much
larger surplus than we credit ourselves with.
For instance, their reports lÂ«Â«t year showed
us as having nearly $1,300,000 more surplus
than our own figures. This year the differ-
ence will be .'â¢omeih^ng still larger. The cause
of our ciwu more conservative showing is this:
TheStnte Departments compute our liabili-
ties i n the asMimption that we ill earn 4 per
cent â¢ compound interest on our reserves
throughout the longest possible duration of
any of our policiesâ say seventy years or more.
On all policies written since April, 1882, we
compute our liability on the assumption that
we may earn only 3 per cent. For the long
periods our contracts are written to cover we
do not think it entirely prudent to assume
more. This requires us to carry a larger re-
serve thin the 4 per cent assumption, which
is the legal standard of solvency.

This has been done at an exp use in manage-
ment of 8.79 per cent of the income. Botn in
what has b-en done for the policy-holder* and â¢
in the economy of managementâ is, in
the low cost of the treat protection givenâ
these results are equaled by no American com-
pany.
It has been with a clear perception and deep
sense of the absolute necessity to the home
life on which our civilization rests and is be-
ing built, of simple, straightforward, reliable
and absolute protection to the family, that the
Connecticut Mutual has adhered to the plain,
uncomplicated, non-speculative ideals of life
insurance plan and method which give that
protection most perfectly and at least cost,
avoiding those schemes which have indeed
pained a great following by offering a specula-
tion in that professed protection.
It is with a deep . thankfulness we offer the
results of our adherence to the right, if simple,
ideal to scientific truth, and to true business
method. Respectfully submitted,

NEW YORK, H. V., Feb. 26.âSpeculation at
the Stock Exchange to-day turned upon the par

by the general run of traders at the start, but
when it became known tlm the event was likely
to stifle any attempts it jingoism In the Senate a
more cheerful feeling pervaded sock circles.
â¢Business, which was decidedly sluggish during the
_ morning, resumed fairly good proportions in the
aiternoon, when the tone became strong and
prices advancrd all along the line. The dealings
were wvll distributed, boh the high and low
priced stock shoving great improvement. As
uv..al. when the t>hi>rts attempted to cover thÂ»
â¢demand developed a small floating supply of
stocks, and it was, therefore, not surprising, under
\he circumstances, that advances made rapid pro
; press. The bet that houses with Washington con
nections were among the principal buyers was re-
Karded as siininiant, and certainly stimulated the
upward movement

UNION" STOCKYARDS, la, Feb. 26âAl
though this week's receipts of cattle were only
45,000, against 47,845 last week, a bad market
hat been experienced, and prices were weak and
largely 10c per 100 pounds lower. The quality
was poorer than ever and only a small percentage
of the beef steers sold as high as 5. One carload
of extras brought Â«525 and the next best sale,
were at $515. Exporters and Eastern shippers
have taken hold more sparingly, and this has
given local dresse<i-beef concerns a chance to sup
ply their wauts at slightly lower figures. The
day's market was of the usual Friday order. Only
about 2500 were received, but there was enough
to supply the demand, and prices showed 110 Im
provement.
Hogs have continued to arrive in good numbers
and prices rose to the highest point tiii* wee* that
has been reached in a Ion; tim -, prime weights
bringing $3 70. The quality of the offerings was
never better and the bulk of the hogsÂ»eil within a
! very narrow range and packersare taking all they
; can get. The strength recently displayed received
a check to-day and price* t.rjke about 6 cent* on
receipt* estimated at 31,000. At the 1 decline the ,
market was airly active.
Sheep receipts have not been extensive Ibis
week, having run along pretty evenly with last
week, but were considerab y under those of a year
ago. The demand has continued active at firm
prices, sneep ruling stronger than lambs. Trade
was good at steudv prices to-day.

come with a rush like the breaking of a great dam.
he growth for some weeks past has been more en
couragirg because In neaily all lines it has been
KiaduÂ». and moderate. Kupture of the steel and

of trade which has been held back and has put
many thousands of men at work, while the slow

with strong hope. .Meanwhile it is substsntlal
ground for confidence that montns which wer^ re

ports over imports would â¢ continue as large in
January ai It hat been in previous months, and
yet it was surprisingly law. '1 he February re
turns have naturally been less favorable, as cotton
exports fall off a: this season and yet a net in
crease compared with last ear is trifling, while
Increase in imports to be expected at this season
in tinted during the past three, weeks to only
ftiU9,O4o. 'compared with last year, or about 'Â£
per cent. .Nothing in the state of foreign ex

or Him country have been liquidated or seriously
diminished. '
.Nothing is yet settled about the price of Lake

The rapid increase In the coke output In the

foreign makers by 70 cents and are selling cot. on

With leas rapidity but ye', steadily other Indus
tries are gaining. Although brown four-yard
sheetings are an eiglnn lower and print cloths a
sixteenth lower it is found that several cotton
mills re started, not covered by the reaction ai
to print-cloth works which is carried out. In
creasing demand has also started quite a number
01 woolen-mills,' including many making dress
goods and hosiery. The demand fur men's woo.
ens is also somewhat better, especially for heavy
wei lit-, and there are improving sales of better
qualities.
In boots and shoes also growing belief that
prices will not give way has star.cd many more
tihops, although many jobbers will shrink from
the prices asked.
Wheat enjoyed a brief rise, then dropped over

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been 15 arrivals trom the north
ern mines with 30,718 tons of i oal and no arrival
trow any lorelgn source. 18,878 tons were shipped
from Â£rlilÂ»h â¢ olumbiaand 1 J.BIO ions from Ore
gon and Washington. The las. arrival of any for
elen Coal cargo Â»at on February 4; nil thÂ«te Is
not any scarcity of fue for general uses, thus dem
onstrating we are self-sustaining from the output
or our i oast mines. Yet Coal vmues annually are
established by the prices named for the foreign
importer", which are again regulated by the out
ward freights on grain, as inward Coal freights are
graded by thu wheat, freight rates to Kurope. Busi
ness in the mci line Is repor.eJ fair, wi h values
tending upward, as the inducement for Coal car-!
riers to seek this ion are very discouraging. Mar
ket values locally for ihe net three months will
be entirely control ed b.- the managers of the
northern collieries, as it is to them we must look
almost entirely for our supplies for March, April
ana May. Aftr thai time- we may look for free
arrivals from Australia."

THE DIAE.S OF BOENEO.
Fine Specimens of Humanity Who Fol
low Curium Customs.
Physically the Dyaks of Borneo are a
fine race, and it is said that some ol the
women are pretty even to European eyes,
though many of the ladies would notj
perhaps, be regarded as belles in a Lon
don ballroom. They have great admira
tion Jor fluency of speech and their ora
tory is flowery. The marriage customs
arc very curious, but tne prohibited de
grees (which seem to be strictly ob
servea) are much the same as our own.
A Dyak may not marry his deceased
wile's sister, nor, by the way, may he
marry his first cousin. Divorce is exceed
ingly frequent, and is nearly a matter of
mutual arrangement. Superstition has
almost the force of the law, and when a
couple are newly married, if a deer utter
a cry at night near the house at which
they are living they must separate at
once and finally, or else the death of one
of them would ensue. Yet, notwithstand
ing the lightness of ihe bonds which unite
them, husband and wife are often deeply
devoted to each other; and there is a
story of how, when a man was seized by
an alligator, his wife sprang into the
river shrieking, "Take me also," and
dived down at the spot where she
had seen the alligator sink with his prey.
She swam about in all the places most re
sorted to by the ferocious reptiles in tne
hope of dying with her husband, and it
was with difficulty that her friends forci
bly removed her from the water.
Home of the Dyaks Durn their dead, the
ceremony being accompanied by various
offerings intended to piopitiate the ghost
of the deceased. The tribes by the sen,
however, generally resort to burial, often
after a sort of Jying-in-state to which the
corpse is dressed in clothes richly orna
mented. In one or two districts there is a
custom of letting boats drift out to sea
containing various artic'es belonging io
the deceased, whose soul is supposed in
this way to travel to some unknown world
beyond the ocean. In former days a slave
woman was sometimes chained down in
tries deutb boata and the Malays from
neighboring islands used to b on the
lookout for them, so that they might ob
tain boat, slave and property free of ex
pense. â Newcastle (En-.'. ) Chronicle.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 26. \
' Mrs. Catherine Booth, the old lady who
di*d about three months ago and who was
a lineal Scotch countess, was really a rich
â woman. Since her death some remarka
. ble facts have come to light, and either
6he must have been very deceitful or else
totally ienorant of the value of her pos
sessions.
For several years before her death she
â was practically supported by charity, and
by means of the Woman's Exchange she
. was able to dispose of some of her family
. 'heirlooms to good advantage. . Alter her
< death the Public Administrator look tem
porary possession of her effects and in a
/ew weens they we re turned over to a
frandson in Vallejo. This grandson, J:
Booth, is a clerk in a grocery-store in that
city and his claim to his grandmother's
property has already been recognized.
His father was at one time a clerk at the
City Hall, but died suddenly of fever
tome years ago, and after that event his
; widow and children moved to Vallejo.
Among her effects was found $23 in
cash, and in her trunk were Government
bonds, twenty-five of which have matured
â¢ and are said to be worth $20,000. and fif
teen more that will mature in 1905. A
large block of Arizona mining stock was
also found, which lust week paid a divi
. dend of 5 per cent. Under these circum
stances the many people who supported
Mrs. Booth in the last few years of her
life are at a loss to understand why these
facts were secreted from them. As the oid
lady was advanced in years and not par
ticularly strong in intellect, it is thou ht
she was not aware of the extent of her
wealth.
The deceased lady had a sister, Mrs. Dr.
Fonda of West Oakland, whom she ac
: cused of secreting letters from her lover
many years ago. The effect of this action
was such that Mr?, Booth remained a
widow nearly all her life, and did not dis
cover her sister's perfidy until after her
dea h. when, on going through her trunk,
â  she lound some of the intercepted letters.
Among i er effects are some Masonic
papers over a century old, which establish
her claim to be a descendant of on* of the
oldest families of the rent isL nobility.

STANf OKD TAiES THE NEGATIVE
I Sides Finally Chosen for the Intorcol
;â¢ ;3 1-giate Debate.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 26.â Stan
ford debaters have chosen the negative
side for the intercollegiate debate. The
question for debate, which was chosen by
the University of California and sent
down to Palo Alto a week ago, is as fol
lows: "Resolved, that members of the
Cabinet should have a peat and a voice in
Congress." In both of the intercollegiate
debates which Berkeley has won in the
last two years the University of California
had the negative side of the question.
Many.of the Stanford men have attributed
Berkeley's forensic victorif s in part to the
tactical advantages of the negative side in
the debates. This fact may account to
Borne extent for Stanford's choice for this
year's debate.
The Stanford debater.'â Switzer, Morgan
â¢and Miss Stebbinsâ were chosen some
t.me ago. The first preliminaries at
Berkeley will de held on March 10 and
the finals a week later. An unusually
iarf.e number will try for a position in
â¢the debate.

WOMEN IN THE FIGHT.
They Will Open the Crusade
Against Saloons on Monday
Afternoon.
Secretary Jacks of the V M. C. A.
Issues a M nifesto on the
Gre^t Issue.
Oakland Office San Francifco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 26. )
The committee of fourteen who has
> charge of tl<e saloon-closing campaign
has decided that active work shall be
opened by the women at the First M. E.
Church on Monday afternoon. This is
the Brat of several meetings planned
for the campaign.
' Noel H. Jacks, secretary of the Y. M.
C. A., has issued the following manifesto:
, Shall the saloon triumph? That is the bu-n*
ing question of the hour in Oakland. The
I young men of tbe association are familiar
: with the recent developments regarding the
control of the saloons in this city, and now we
as voters are called upon to express our opin
ion on the question, "Shall the saloon in
Oakland be banished?" What say you, young
men, one aud all? The Y. M. C. A., as an or
ganization, has always been the out-nnd-ouf
opponent of the saloon, mid as far as we can
speak for the Oakland association, we stand in
that relation to our 200 saloons.
The issue put before trie people by the Coun
cil is not m political but a morn lone; there
tore there should be but one result. All good
people should unite in saying: "Let us banish
from our fair city this man-d.'Stroyine institu
tion." A ss-meeting 01 men will be heM In
our Auditorium next Sunday afternoon at 3:30
o'clock to consider this saloon matter, when
short addresses will be given by Hers. Dr.
Kumrner, Dr. Coyle, C. H. Uobart, James
Small, Dr. Chapman and others. This will be
a live, wide-awake meeting. Coma out and
show your colors and help by your presence.
The Women's Christian Temperance
Union has also entered the fight ana - has â 
appointed a committee of three to confer j
with the workers and see what can be I
done to beip the battle along. There will !
De a mass-meeting conducted by women j
at Y. to. C. A. Hall Monday.
The saloon question is now the most
prominent of any before the candidate*,
and so far not one outside of the Prohibi
tion ticket, whicn usually polls about 8 i
per cent of the vote?, has declared himself. '
A banquet will be given on Saturday
evenine to A. C. Henry, ibÂ« independent ,
candidate lor Mayor. A fine programme
has been prepared, and there will be ten- ;
minute speeches by independent candi- j
dates.
T:>e Democrats held a maÂ«s-meeting
lost night at Washington Hali, and were
addressed by Â£>etb Mann, the candidate
for Itoayor. and Thonias P. 'iarrity, candi
date for City Attorney. The Democrats
have arranged for several mass-meetings
next week.
EFFECT OF THE CARSON BATTLE.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 24.â The Corbett-Fitzsiromons spirit has made itself
very apparent, io this city. In children's playgrounds and on vacant lots the de
sire to display a knowledge of fisticuffs is demonstrated eTery hour, and in some
parts of town youth has organized little clubs for the encouragement of the so
called art.
In East Oakland, just across the Eighth-street bridge, in a vacant lot on the
â oath side, there is a gymnasium, which is liberally patronized by what is known
as the "Little Corbett Chib," In the center of the lot is an oak tree, anct from one
of the outspreading branches is suspended a punching bag, atuffed with sand and
horsehair in about equal parts. There are about a dozen members to the club,
whose average age is about ten. The little fellows gather on the lot, strip off their
superfluous clothing and punch the bag with great vigor, while using all the Hang
phrases and ring expressions common to old-time pugilists.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1897.
LIEUTENANT BIRD
MAY YET RESIGN
Sequel to the Flag- Raisin^
at the East Oakland
Church.
Trustee Watson Says That His
Interference Was Quite
Necessary.
Captain Cobb edick R>sents the Stand
Taken by H.s Jan or
Offic:r.
Oakland Office San Frakcipco Call,)
908 Bruad-avay, Feb. 2H. J
The trouble over the flag- raising at the
Eighth-avenue Methodist Church will
proDably end in the resignation of Lieu
tenant Bird of the Boys' Brigade. Trustee
Watson, who was charged by Mr. Bird
with undue interference in the erection of
the flagstaff, asserts that there was no
actual trouble and that Lieutenant Bird
itcted too hastily.
"On behalf of the trustees and official
board of said church," said Mr. Watson
to-day, "as well as of the Boys' Brigade, I
wish to correct the injury already done by
tbe giving out of mistaken information.
I did not stop the flag-raising, but was
heartily in favor of it; but I did insist
that the flagpole should be placed in a
stable position and be properly braced
and rest on brackets. As a trustee I ob
jected to cutting t.e cornice of the church,
as I did not wish the building to be de
faced, and it waÂ« only when I saw them
preparing to cut a hole in tbe projection
in violation of instructions that I ordered
t. c carpenters to cease."
Captain Cobbledick, who is in charce of
the company at ihe churcn, said to-day :
"There was no discord between tha pastor
and Mr. Watson, and all has been carried
out in harmony. Trustee Watson merely
insisting that the fi igsiaff should hi prop
erly placed. The whole matter arose out
of the statements made by Lieutenant
Bird, which were not in accordance with
the facts."
Lieutenant Bird says that the trouble
over the flag-raising wiil probably end in
his severing hia connection with the com
pany. "I was chairman of the commit
tee," he said, '"that was given full power
to act in this ma'.ter, and we were eoing
ahead when Mr. Watson interfered. I was
a?ked to sign a statement which was not
true, and because I refused to do so tbe
opposition to me has become very active.
There may not be a conflict between Mr.
Watson and the company, but I am of the
opinion that Mr. Watson is not through
with the matter yet. The bill is larger on
account of the trustees interference t Jan
we contract e<l :'or, and he will have to pay
the difference or I wiil know the reason
why." __^^^_^_^___
STOLE A HOUSE.
Charles Scott of Llvermore Tried on a
Novel Charge.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â Charles
Scott is on trial before Ju tge Ogden
charged with having stolen a house, the
property of Sarah Gallagher of Livermore.
Scot is known as one of the terrors of
Liverroore, and some time last July ttie
Gallaghers discovered that a smail houee
in tl. e foothills belonging to them bad
disappeared with all the contents. They
traced thp t lieft to Scott, who was arrested
and charged with stealing the property,
which is valued at $75.
From to-day's testimony it appeared
that fccott lived on property on the offside
of the creek near the Gallagher ranch.
ThÂ«re was a trail from the bouse to Scott's
place, over which it appeared as thougn
some heavy material had been dragged.
On the side of the house something had
been burned to create the impression that
he house might have been burned down.
The lumber from the cabin, it is alleged,
was found in an addition to Scott's aouse.
CHILDREN POISONED.
Three Little Frople Ht Wtit Oakland
Ate Deadly Food.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad way. Feb. 26. j
Three little children at West Oakland
are in a critical condition, and circum
stances make it appear that they have
been ncciden a;ly poi^pned.
John Joyce of 725 CoiUer street went to a
funeral this morning and when he re
turned his children ware in convulsions
and his wile in hysterics. After their
breakfast the chi dren were sent to pur
chase some crackers from an adjacent
grocory-store. They were each given a
cracker and about an hour JatÂ«r Mary,
a>;ed 5 years, was seized with spasms A
few minutes afterward Maggie aud Jack
wore also seized with spasms.
Dr. D. D. Crowley was iuramoned and
he stw at oiice that it was probably a case
of poisoning and adopted proper remedies
n hastily aÂ» possible. He was a?siÂ£tecl by
Dr. Medros. but they are unwilling to
m ake a definite statement as to what ailed
the children. They are practically certain
that they will save the little one*' lives.
The source of t ho accident cannot bo
definitely stated, but it is suspec ed that
in some manner they partook of the poison
with the biscuits.
"THE UNITARIAN EBELL"
Rev. Marshall Law Objects to
Dr. Wendte's Claims lor
His Faith.
Publishes Some Caustic Remarks
About Rector Bolton and His
' Ik as.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 26. f
Rev, Marshall Law, the clergyman wi.o
recently expressed an opinion that news
papers should chares advertising rates for
publishing sermons, has written an edi
torial in the current number of his church
pamphlet which will probably form a
topic for one of the discussions of the
Ebell Society in the near future.
Rector Law says:
We suggest tnat the church people in Oak
land trans:er their patronage to our own St.
Luke's Hospital, in ihe cuy, iind that the la
oies who have uuwituugiy become members
of the U itarian Ebell Society clearly urider
s tan J that by remaiui g members or the Eoell
tuey are Indorsing and tupporiing a social
club which denies the divinity of our L rd,
Jesus Christ. There are enough truly Chris
tian believers among the church ladles of Oak
land who are now in the Ebel! to organize a
social club which has no church coiorinit.
The most of mem thought thay had joined
tuch ii one when they went into the Ebell,
and it must have been a cruel surprise to
them to have Mr. Wend te tear off me mask
lasi week and show mam that by virtue of their
Ebell membership they were claimed in tne
Unitarian fold, aid ro advertised all over this
coast. Verily, whoever plays fast and loose
with either of these extremes will wake to find
themseives snared. "Will you walk into my
parlor? said the spider to the fly."
YORKE ANSWEARS COYLE.
The Chancellor Denies That
This Is a Protestant
Land.
Siys That It Is M n.iy "America, the
L ,nd cf tlie Brave and the
Free."
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â Rev. P. C.
Yorke delivered his postponed address to
night at the Macdonougn Theater in an
swer to Dr. Coyle, wno lectured on "What
Liberty Owes to Rome" two months aco.
The speaker commenced his lecture by
Btatine that he proposed to take up Dr.
Coyle's arraignment of Catholics para
eraph by paragr&ph. He then said in
briel:
It" we could bring our minds to the improba
ble hypothesis ot the Oakland preachers
agreeing on any subject in the heavens above
cr on the earth beneath we might take Dr.
Coyle's i.ronutiotamento as tne official reply of
O iklaud's preacherdom to my ,ast lecture.
Bat ibis is not so, and I presume tbat after a
yrar of Wendie they may apprec.ate a few
months of Coyie.
Dr. Coyle *-ays he has no quarrel with Catho
lics, but bis quarrel is with the church. This
is absurd. He does not attack me, but he at
tacks the mother who bore me. Strange logic
that, indeed. But away with such pretenses.
Dr. Coyle can do no Mich thing, for the two
are Inseparable. Elizabeth haugod Catholics,
not because of. their individual religion, but
because they were loyal to the church, and tne
same persecuting biood flows in Dr. Coyle's
veins. Dr. Coyle is but one of tens of tnou-
EaiKis who have gone up against the churcn
of God, and the blows lrom which evangelical
preacherdom still reels were struck by Protest
ants, who were not afraid to be lair, aud they
have demo.is:raied that the Proteitant revo
lution threw back tbe march of civilization
over 200 years.
What proof has Dr. Coyle brought of his be
lief? He makes assertion after assertion, and
he has traversed history backward and for
ward from the twelfth century even to the
E resent nay. Like the energetic politician he
as' claimed everything in sight, but unlike
the wive politician he has not produced a sin
gle fact to substantiate his claims. You have
beard or read his address, nnd I challenge you
to name a single principle of good govern
ment which he has ascribed to Protestant
teaching. I challenge you to mention a singie
fact in tne history of people struggling to be
free that may with justice be applied to their
religious belief in ihe Refoimti.ioii. He has,
it is true, made a long catalogue of alleged
aggressions by the Catuollc church on non-
Catholic communities.
Suppose every word of it were true, does it
prove that Piotestantism is favorable to the
rights of man? If I prove that Mayor Davie is
the candidate of the -aloon element in this
town does that demonstrate that Mr. Thomas
is the ctiamnion of prohibition? If he wishes
to prove tnai Pro estantit-m is in favor of civil
and religious liberty let lnm show the doc
trines ot Protestantism, or of the leaders of
Protestantism, which make for rhat belief.
Let him explain away the standards of his
own faith and the standards of his own
theology. Let him name a single Protestant
sect in any age or in any country which did
not persecute not only Catholics but all othi-r
Protestants when it had supreme power. Then
we may begin to a â lmit Ins claims, then we
may begin io believe tnat the preaciiers have
not been the brakes upon the whee.R of
progress, then we may begin to hope that
there U not nud there has not been a gram of
civil liberty, or a measure of religious free
dom, or a concession to popular right, which
the ministers oi Dr. Coyle's denomination and
the men of Dr. Coyie's stamp have not cursed
in Its inception and have not tried to neutral
ize in Us execution.
Your lecture, Dr. Coyle, was spoken for the
purpose of influencing this coming election,
and was spoken for the purpose of influencing
it in favor of bigotry. You are the leader of
those candidates, men and women, who have
giveu their solemn promise that no Catholic
girl shall teach in your Oakland schools. And
in this same connection you say lei in the
light, and yet you exclude the Monitor and
the Star from your library.
Dr. Coyle says that Catholic countries are
not fit to live in. How is thi*? In England
one person in every thirty-nine is a pauper;
in France there is only one pauper in every
145.
But, no doubt, what is at the bottom of all
Dr. coyle's trouble is the United States and
the Pope's Irish. Lt-t me tell Dr. coyle that
the Unite. l states is not a Protestant "country
and its Government is not founded on Pro'.es
tant principles. There are seventy millions of
people in this country, and not fi.teen mil
lions belong to any Protesiant church. There
is not a principle in he Declar.-ition of Inde
pendence that may not be paralleled in the
writings of Catholic* hundreds of years before
Protestantism existed, and there is not a safe
guard of freedom in our constitution which
was not known to our Catholic ancestors.
This country is not a Protestant country nor &
Catholic country. It is America, the home of
the brave and the land of the free.

Prepared Judgments Over a Sewer.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â For several
years complaints have been made regard
ing the impurity of the air in the Police
Court chambers. All of the judges who
have occupied the bench for several years
have complained, and Judge Wood a short
time ago was taicen sice from this cause.

Repairing the Bridge.
ALAMEDA, Cal , Feb.- 26.â The ex
treme precaution taken by the train bands
in crossing the Alice-street bridge has
caused most of the patron* ot the broad
gauge to take the narrow-gauge trains this
week. This has had a tendency. to over
crowd the small cars. On Monday next
the trains will run from Masiick station
to Fran vale, transferring passengers to
the Seventh-street local. A gang of
bridge-carpenters are at work- on the
bridge, and each train crosses the bridge
no faster than a person could crawl on his
hands and knees. 5885

FINDING JOBS
FOR UNEMPLOYED
Supplies Being Issued to
Many Destitute Fam
ilies.
Deserving Cases Cared For by
Men That Have Nothing
Themselves.
Soliciting Cash Subscriptions to the
Boulevard Wcrk Naw to Begin
in Earnest.
As the days drae by without any im
mediate prospect of work for the
majority of the unemployed the men
themselves are gradually developing an
organization that ij one more than in
name alone. They have established an
employment bureau at their headquarters
and they have begun to issue from their
meager larder -mall supplies to different
destitute families represented on the rolls
of the organization.
The citizens' relief committee met yes
terday in the Chamber of Commerce only
to report progress and to receive little
books to be issued to the different district
collectors that will go about in earnest
raising funds for the boulevard work.
So far there is a little over $1100 sub
scribed. The amount received yeserday
by Treasurer Daniel Never was $90. ma<ie
up as follows: Ca*h $10. Daniel Meyer $50,
Bam D., $20, Mrs. M. Langley $10. On
Thurs .ay Mrs. Phelan subscrioed $100 and
Mayor Phelan $250. â¢ In addition to the
cash in hand therÂ« are said to be promises
as good as cash from A. B. Spreckels for
$300 and from the Ingleside Racetrack for
$500. There are also possibilities that
several hundred dollars promised to the
boulevard association some time since
may be made available for present use.
It was suggested yesterday at the citi
zens' relief committee meeting tiiat a
practical test be made of the members of
a committee of liitv that declined to serve
after being appointed by the Mayor on
the India famine relief cause ou account
of the suffering among the unemployed
in this City.
The employment office established at
the hea :quarters for tne unemployed in
Howard street consists simply in notices
of employment offered posted on the
wall, tne applicants for the job beinn con
sidered in the order of their appearance
before the execuiive officers. So far
tweive men have been found work in
vineyards and orchards, one has been
given employment at upholstering one
elderly man h^s been sent to a place in
the country, and another elderly man has
gone to a city bouse to accept general
work. Four other men have also been
sent out to steady positions. To-day a
man and wife will go into the conntrv to
accept positions' offered through this new
employment bureau. To-day also thirty
of the men will be given work tor the one
day only at handling furniture herein
theC:ty.
President Lefflngwell, speaking yester
day of the beneiits to be derived from the
employment bureau system, assertej that
if the proposed mining project is found
feasible Ha can send from 250 to 300 men
into the mines next week. He is waiting
now to hear from a man who is making
inquiries in the mining resions.
In the afternoon the wagon was taken
out. according to daily custom, and drawn
by over 100 men through several streets in
quest of collections of supplies. A few
sacks of potatoes and a few sacks of beans
were about all that was collected. There
was enough, nowever, in the corumissarv
with this added to maintain the hungry
hundreds until to-night. Beyond that
and aside from to-day's contributions
thera is nothing in sight for to-morrow.
And so it is day by day.
Sieniticantly enough about the time the
wagon is roady to start there seems to be
very few men about headquarters; but
there are always hundreds ol them loiter
ing expectantly aDout Â»o welcome the
I wagon on its return and the men who
have tramped several miles in draw
ing it.
In addition to. the voluntary workers
who perform the comparatively light task
of drawing the wagon, t ere are about
fifty other men employed about the build
ing. They are giving their services freely,
and their evident industrious spirit, were
it manifested by more of the others, might
be the means of creating a very muc i
more favorable impression upon casual
visitors to the headquarters. The corps
employed in the building and working for
the others without any r numeration or
favor is made up as follows:
Executive department (twenty-six men)â A
president, a vice-president, a recording secre
tary, a financial secretary, an executive com
mittee of twelve, a relief and investigating
committee of five, an auditing committee of
three, and a grievance committee of two.
Commissary department (four men)â A com
ml.*sar>-, an assistant commissary and two
clerks.
Cooking department (twenty-one men)â
Four cooks, four dishwashers, three pantry
men, a steward and nine waiters.
Official department (four Â«uen)â A sergeant
at-arms, two aignt watchmen and a house
orderly.
Of the 140 cases ie destitute families
requesting relief from the headquarters of
the unemployed ninety of them had up to
last night been served *rith supplies from
the meager commissary of the unem
ployed after the relief committee reported
each particular case worthy of immediate
aitention and in actual distress.
This is what was doled out to an aver
age family of rive, two grown persons and
three children : Five pound â¢ of potatoes.
I 3 pounds of onions, 3 pounds of meat, \%
poun<!s of sugar, 4 pound? of flour, 1 pouni
of coffee, 2 loaves ><t bread, % of a pound
of tea and 3 pounds of bean*.
The relief committee's report shows
that on Thursday it distributed the fol
lowing supplies to families in distress:
Fifty-one pounds of potatoes, 96 pounas of
onions. 23 pou ids of meat, 24 pounds of sugar,
28 pounds of flour, 14 Dounds <if coffee, 21
loaves ot bread, 3 pounds of tea, 38 pounds of

MANEUVERS
FOR DELAY
Another Postponement in
the Big Pencil Deeds
Case.
OF MANY FAIR LAWYERS
ONE IS ILL.
Graven Attorneys Make a Vigor
ous but Vain Fight
for Trial.
SOME EOT SHOT FOR BONANZA
INTERESTS.
The Heirs of the Millionaire Accused
cf Questionable Tactics to
Delay Matters.
â¢Of the army of lawyers in the employ of
the Fair millions one is sick, and the great
litigation bas for this reason come to a
stands! ill again. Despite the strenuous
opposition of her attorneys the fight be
tween Mrs. Craven and the representatives
of the bonanza king's estate on the pencil
deeds has been again postponed, this time
until Alarch 15.
It is W. M. Pierson who is the invalid,
and in addition to stopping the progress
ol th-e case temporarily his illness has set
tieJ a piece of legal etiquette.
Judge Siack heard affidavits of his part
ner, R. B. Mitchell, and Dr. Luke Robin
son yesterday morning, and learned that
Ficrson occupies the distinction ol being
thÂ« leading counsel in the galaxy of legal
talent that has been in the employ of the
Fair estate for the past two years.
In vain Mrs. Craven's attorneys fought
against lurther delay. They were ready
:\nd anxious to try out the big case at once.
It was useless that they remembered that
tli ere were almost a score of big lawyers
raking care of tiie Fair interests in addi
tion to -Pierson. Pel ma? narrated the re
peated excuses made by the attorneys who
aTe fiphling the pencil deeds. He recalled
'*" that the Fair people had advertised it far
â¢ and wide, that the case again<t the pencil i
deeds was so plain that it amounted 10 a I
"mathematical and ocular demonstra
tion." The other side had no appetite
for arithmetic.
The" proceedings yesterday were argu
l mentative on a motion on behalf of the
Pair estate to continue the case on ac
count of Pierson'a illness. The Craven
â¢ s.:dÂ» fought bitterly against the delay.
â¢'I will state," said Attorney Delmas.
after Mitchell had told Judge Slack of
Pierson's illness and urged it as the
'ground of delay, "that Mr. Mitchell com
municated with me on February 8 or 9 a
â¢ request that I should consent to a con
tinuance of the trial for one week on ac
count of tiie absence of his partner. Mr.
â  Pjerson, in New Yocfc. and who would not i
be b.ck untii March 1& This req -i-st I
positively declined to accede to, and so
informed Mr. Mitchell. On the same day
1 was served with a notice signed by the
attorneys for the plaintiffs ttigtihey would
. â¢ move the court at 2 o'clock of the same
day to re-set the case, or to continue it
until the 23d of February. I came to this
court for the purjio-eof opposing that mo
tion. Mr. Mitchell then appealed to me j
. personally, as a matter of courtesy to him j
ana to his firm, stating that Mr. Pierson
was absent in New York upon important
matters and could not possibly be back in
time to try the case, ami assured me that
if I consented to that continuance they
. â¢ would appiy for no further continuance ;
and he went so far as to state that if we
applied for a continuance he would op
"pose if.
'.'Upon that assurance I consented to a |
continuance for one week, and it was dis
tinctly understood and stated at thÂ» time
both by Mr. Pierson and myself and in
the. presence ot Mr. McKnerney that no
â¢. further ooutinuance would be applied for.
We consequently prepared for trial for the
L'3d of this month, .md were then ready
and desirous to go on with the trial of the
case. At that time we were met with
what seemed to m â¢ to be a violation of the
agreement entered into and by means of
which the continuance had bÂ»en secured,
or the consent lor the continuance had
been secured, by a motion for a continu
ance for one week on the eround of Mr.
Pierson's sickness Thecourt at that time
continued the cas* for one week, announc
ing, as I understood it, that counsel must
1 hen be prepared, as the court would grant
no further continuance. We have since
that time renewed our preparation for the
trial ol ;he case, and are, and will be
ready to go on at the time set for it, next
week.
â¢ Now, so far as Pierson has had the ex
clusive charge of this suit for the firm I
would state that Mr. R. B. Mitcnell, his
partner, has been present and actively
participated in every important proceed
ing that has taken place in this case, and
himself has personally taken the deposi
tions of the chief witnesses, or many of
â¢ thecliief witnesses for the defense, to
wit. Miss Margaret Craven, Mr. Stephen
Roberts and Mrs. Haskir.s, and others
that I could recall by taxing n:y memory
"but do :iot now remember. I will state
:urt:ior t bat lam informed and believe
that Mr. .MrEn-rney, now present in
court, and one of the counsel for the
plaintiffs, is ;uily prepared and has com
pleie knowledge of every essential fact and
of every detnil of every essential fact
necessary for the presentation of the case
ill the plaintiffs, and I would add to that,
which is Imriily necessary in this court,
thnt Mr. McEnerney, in point of legal
ability to ITT this case, is inferior to no
member of this or any other bar.
"I wiil state further that I am informed,
and the gentleman who informs mo is mv
assistant, Mr. Brittain, who probably isiii

court, that Mr. McEnerney requested to
know of him In the latter part of lasc
week, Or the oeginning of this week, after
the continuance had been granted by your
Honor, whether we would surely go on
with the trial of the case on the day it was
next set for; that they desired to know, as
they would apply for no further'continu
ance, and wished to be informed whether
we /ould. Mr. McEnerney was informed
that we were ready then, as we always
had been, to try the case whenever it was
called.
"I wili state further as a part of my
statement, before my friend commences,
that it is a matter of public notoriety that
has been given wide circulation in the
newspapers, that the lack of merit in this
case and the fraudulent character of the
legal instrument*, the deeds upon which
Mrs. Craven relies, is so plain that it
amounts to a mathematical and ocular
demonstration, and that being so, there
could be no great difficulty, and it would
require no great preparation and no very
great legal ability to demonstrate so plain
a proposition."
McEnerney in reply graciously admit
ted that Pierson was boss of the show on
his side of the house. He represented Ex
ecutor Goodfellow, while Pierson repre
sented Executors Angus and Crothers,
and it was a case of the majority con
trolling. He would appeal for delay on
the ground of pure and simule humanity.
"Now I will say to your Honor," said
Del mas in reply, "that I am happy to
state that the relations which have ex
isted between myself and the gentlemen
who represent the plaintiffs in this case
have been in.irKed throughout, 1 think 1
may safely say, on both sides with the
utmost courtesy, and have been exceed
ingly pleasant and agreeable, and I have
no doubt will continue so to the end, no
matter what may be the o'her animosities
that may be engendered by the tr.al of a
case of this kind.
"But we never have wished for delay.
We are under lire and accusations and
criminal prosecutions, and Grand Juries
invited to make manifest our guilt and so
forth. "We are ready to be tried. We are
anxious 10 be tried. We do not want to
be tried before a Grand Jury upon an ex
parte proceeding. We want to be tried in
court openly, where we can be heard as
well us the other side. And I do not
thinkâ your Honor certainly would not
have granted a continuance on account of
Mr. Pierson's absence, your Honor could
not have granted it if Mr. Pierson had ab
sented himself knowing that this case was
set for trial. Indeed, if your Honor
please, it had been set for trial by mutual
consent aud to suit the convenience of all
parties.
"It would have suited the convenience
of both Mr. Mitchell's firm and my own
to have tried it here in January, it did
not suit that of Mr. McEnerney, who had
other engagements. It was set by consent
for the 2d of February. Your Honor well
knows that with we attorneys somewhat
busy tiic preparation of a case of this kind
necessitates the suspension of other work,
the subordination of other engagements,
and that when counsel have made ti.eir
arrangements to try a case to have it
unhinged and set adrift is a great annoy
ance â a great disturb.vice to the whole
business of their office und their personal
convenience. Were I not entirely satis
tied that during the two weeks which are
asked for there will be nothing done in
this case thut cannot be done iully as well
by counsel now present as by unybody
else, it miijht be a different proposition.
"But what will there be done during
I those two weeks? The jury will be em
paneled â it will tats probably a week to
get a jury in a case that has attracted so
much attention ; it will take us a week
and more, doubtless, to put in our case.
Counsel are certainly competent to cross
examine our witnesses. Mr. McEneruey
certainly is; Mr. Mitchell certainly is.
And at the end of two weeks Mr. Pierson
can take his piace at the trial-table and
proceed without any inconvenience, with
out any loss to anybody.
"We wish to go to trial, if your Honor
please, before by this decimating process
i of criminal prosecution and Grand Jury
I indictments our witnesses have all been
j crippled and defamed. That is what we
wish. We wish them to appear here in
this court where they can be examined at
length. And if, as has been stated, their
guilt is so manifest that it is provable be
yond a reasonable doubt, so as to satisfy
the exigencies of even criminal law, what
difficulty is there in making their guilt
manifest in this court as well as any
other?"
Mitchell in reply said he had endeavored
Ito live up to his agreement. It was not
his fault that Pierson was sick. Me-
Enerney added a similar plea.
Here W. \\ . Foote proceeded to get in a
word, and it did not tend 10 throw any oil
on the troubled waters.
"This is a civil case," hep an Foote,
"pending before your Honor, but it is be
ing tried in other tribunals, as your Honor
i must well" know. The machinery of the
! Superior Court has been disjointed, as it
1 were, and been turned into a committing
magistrate's court, for what purpose I
know not, and I do not charge it upon
eiiher of these gentlemen, but for the pur
pose of trying t:;e civil case in that crim
inal proceeding. The detective lorce of
this City has been brought into that crim
inal case for tue purpose, as 1 believe, of
damaging us in this civil case. The Grand
Jury lias been invoked, and even now our
principal witness, who has the custody of
these deed*, is under subpena to produce
these deeds before the Grand Jury this
afternoon.
"It has been intimated time and time
again that these deeds would not be pro
duced here when called for in this civil
case. We do not know what will become
of them if every outside and officious
person is permitted to handle these
deeds, whether they wiil be lost or de
stroyed or mutilated. We desire to try
thi^case now, it your Honor please, now
when it is set, for the very reason that we
do not desire to be hampered further. It
has been stated, and we have generally
understood, that the purpose of these
criminal proceedings was to intimidate
witnesses whom we desire to produce.
"Your Honor must recognize, from your
experience as a man, that where witnesses
who swear to certain facts are dragged up
and prosecuted before the Superior Court
lor perjury, where they are held for per
jury and where that does not seem to be
sufficient, the Grand Jury is dragged into
the Supetior Court and instructed to do
certain things, that .some of our witnesses
might naturally be intimidated. We have
no chance in the Grand Jury room. It is
a secret tribunal, an inquisitorial tn
bunai. Our main witness, or at least one
of ibem, Mr. Roberts, will be there this
afternoon without the protection of coun
sei and with the power of the State op
posed to him.
"We want to try this case In your
Honor's court where we know we will get
justice In a civil proceeding, before twelve
jurors in that box, who will only bear
sworn testimony, and where we will have
an opportunity of protecting our wit
nesÂ»es. and we invite these gentlemen to
the conflict wh<ch they have sought, at the
time that they have named.
"I do not desire to do anything out of
the way to Mr. Pierson. Somebody else
might get sick if it were set next Monday.
It Mr. McEnerney were sick and Mr. Pier
son were well it might be a sort of kaleido
scopic proceeding, for it does not yet ap
pear by Mr. McEnerney's affidavit that he
is not the leading connsel. We do not
Know who is the leading counsel in this
case. Has my friend, Mr. Mitchell, been
acting ai a decoy and a dummy in this
case all the time? He has been here* upon
his feet upon every important proceeding
and when these depositions were taken.
Mr. McEnerney has acted well and ably
in this case ever since it was started.
Now we are met with the proposition,
snpported by the affidavit of Mr. Mitchell
and Mr. Pierson, which I do not pretend
to deny, that Mr. Pierson is the leading
counsei. and my vis inguished friend is
relegated to the background. It is hum
bug, and the motion ought not to be
granted."
There was more debate of a similar na
ture, which finally resulted in Jud c Slack
granting a postponement until March 15,
with an admonition to the Fair lawyers
that the case would have to proceed on
that day in any event.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1897.
OF ALL SORTS
AND CONDITIONS
King and Peasant to Dance
at the Mardi Gras
Ball.
Much Speculation as to W.'at
the Belles Are Going
to Wear.
Green w^y Cries " Rats" â Jouilln
Ma'cbes His Complexionâ Z.nda
Trous?rs for Brugu ere.
Interest in the Mardi Gras ball to be
held at the Hopkins Institute of Art on
Tuesday evening grows apace.
It is the sole absorbing topic of con
versation in beauty's boudoir, in the pro
fessional sanctum and the commercial and
mercantile office?.
The ladies are proving if not in theory
that in practice they can keep a secret.
Not even to her nearest and dearest has
one breathed even the slightest hint of
what her costume is to be. The natural
question, "What are you going to wear?"
only elicits the response, "1 really have
not decided yet â probably a domino."
But it won't be a domino. At the cos
tumers' they are busy from early morn to
late at night. They are making gowns for
Indian maidens, East Indian princesses,
for dainty, demure Puritans, Elizabeths,
Mary, Queen of Scots, and dozens of others
famous in the pages of history and fiction
and familiar through the agency of the
drama or the comic opera.
Then there are to be fairies and flowers
and birds and butterflies and representa
tives of the godesses of ancient Greece
and Rome.
The gentlemen who have tickets for the
ball in their vest pockets lairly bubble
over with enthusiasm, and buttonhole
each friend they me.-t to debate on the
beauty and the tit of their costumes.
A few have kept their intentions secret â
at least they think they have, which is
probably the same thing. It is known,
however, that a certain unctuous gentle
man of generous proportions will be re
splendent in a lavender Henry VIII cos
tume, and he will walk arm in arm with
the King of Cuba.
It is slid that Mayor Phelan will appear
in the gorgeous robes of the Lord Major
of London. That is only rumor, however,
but it is positive (the gentleman himself
is authority for the fact) that E 1 Green
way will linger a ribbon- bedecked pipe
and play soul-entrancing music, and that
the little boys will follow him and call
"Rats." Greenway is to be the '"Pied
Piper of Hamelin." His costume will be
as brilliant as a summer's sunset. His
trousers, reaching only to tie Knee, are of
red plush embroidered in gold. His heart
will beat beneath a white siik shirt gor
geous with Flemish embroidery. Across
his shoulders will be thrown a gray dol
man, falling in graceful folds almost to
the heels of his buff-strapped sandals. A
red plush vest embroidere I in gold, red
silk stockings and red and gold cap will
complete the piper's costume.
Uncle George Bromley is to be a Vene
tian Senator. The costume bas been
chosen on account of its beauty and its
warmth. Shaped like a huge coat, it
reaches to the heels enveloping ihe
wearer from neck to toe. It is of ruby
piush, embroidered in gold, with here
and there a suggestion of green to give it
light.
A. C. Hellman is to be a white prince.
In shining wnite satin he is to be arrayed ;
the only touch of color in the whole cos
tume will be the high red heels of his
white satin low-cut shoes. Around the
waist will be a gorgeous white sash tied in
an immense butterfly bow at the left side.
Hellman, as far as costume goes, will cer
tainly be a picturesque prince.
Peter Bruguiere is to encase his shapely
limbs in tbe "Prisoner of Zenda" costume.
It is an exact copy of the suit worn by
Hackettin the third act of tbe drama of
that name. It consists of a hunter's green
military jacket, skin-tight trousers and
top boots.
Gordon Ross is to be the prince's her
ald. His costume is a happy mingling
of the Spanish colons, yellow and black.
H.s apron is of black satin, embroidered
in gold, as is his cap and the broad six
teenth century yellow and blacK slashed
shoes he will wear.
Horace Platt will be an Oxford man.
In gown and mortar board he will follow
the prince's moving train. His gown is
of rich red brocaded silk, and the cap of
course matches it.
Solly Walters is to be a blue and red
jester.
E. A. Wills^e will wear a costume he
Orougtit witti him from South Africa and
which by the deft hand of the costumer
is beiiiK altered to fit the requirements of
Mnrasq .in of Girofle-Ghotta fame. The
coat and trousers ure of red plush em
broidered in gold. Shirt and stockings are
of white silk. The drapery that is flung
over the shoulders is of "striped Roman
silk. The hat is a large gray sombrero all
tasaeled in crimson.
Howard Taylor is to be his satanic
majesty and of course will be attired all in
bright, warm red.
Joullin had quite a time selecting: his
costume. The artist after much mature
consideration has come to the conclusion
that he can only wear gray or black. For
some time he hovered between the great
Marshal of France and the courtier of Eng
land. His final decision is a black velvet
Earl of Leicester costume.
A PABK BOULEVABD.
Grove Street to Be Kliminated From
the Official Map of tbe City.
The long expected cutting through of
Alamo square to make a direct driveway
from the City Hall to Golden Gate Park
wili, if the Hayes Valley Improvement
Club's plan be carried out, soon be real
ized.
Such expectations were fully ventilated
by a large attendance of the property
owners on the line of Grove street at a
meeting of the club at Mowry's Hall on
Wednesday night.
President Charles Alpers and Secretary
F. G. Fall of the improvement club had
sent out circular invitations to all those
to be benefited by this nroposed work,
and as a result an intelligent exchange of
Ideas and opinions were freely exchanged
at the meeting.
The question of grade on the summit of
Alamo square was discussed pro and con,
when to facilitate matters the following
wÂ«Â»re appointed a committee to obtain
plans and learn the probable expense at
tending the cutting: R. AlcLauehlin, E.
F. Reed and J. E. Peters. This body will
report its conclusions at the next meeting
of tbe club.
It was suggested that when the street
shall be cut through the name of
Grove street shall be eliminated from the
map and Park avenue substituted there
for, inasmuch as it will be a continuation
George T. Bromley as Doge of Venice,
Gordon Ross as the Prince's Herald,
Ned Grcenway as the Pied Piper of
llamclin and A. Â£. Hellman as the
White Prince.
of the Park avenue now running in front
of the City Hall.
It was considered that between $10,000
and $12,000 would be the probable ex
pense attending the improvement, pro
vided the Supervisors would grade t.e
sidewalk in front of the square.
The club elected the following delegates
to the Associated Improvement Club:
Phil Fay, J. Harry Scott. Charles Alpers,
Frederick Smith and C. Zwierlin.
Mathew Cavanagh was elected treasurer
without bonds.
The by-laws were amended providing
for monthly dues at 25 centÂ«.
A vote of thanks was tendered President
Alpers for his generosity in giving the
hall free of cost to the club.
JUDGE COOK'S KEYHOLE.
Nothing to Show That Burglary
Was Attempted.
Another sensation has been spoiled.
After the detectives and certain reporters
had got through with their wiid-eyed story
that somebody had been trying to burglar
ize Judge Carroll Cook's chambers for the
supposed purpose of saining possession of
thÂ«? exhibits in the Cooney perjury cases,
Judge Cook himself made an examination
of the door, and discovered that the
wooden plug near the lock was old timber
and had probably been in that place
a year.
There was nothing to show that any
effort had been made to feloniously enter
the rooms, and the incident was dismissed
by his Honor as a trivial matter.
It is true that the detectives never until
yesterday saw that wooden plug near the
keyhole in the door, but in partial expla
nation it may be stated that they never
looked there for it before.

THE CITY WILL
PAY FOR LUNCHES
Jurors Will Not Hunger
Nor Supervisors Be
Jailed.
Amusing Close of an Episode in
Which the Courts Won
Out Easily.
Penal Cole Provisions Proved to B2
an Unanswerable Argument on
Second Thought.
The Supervisors will not go to jail.
The jurors will not go hungry, nor will
they pay for their own meals. These two
matters were settled at one and tne same
time yesterday. The bills for meals to jurors
came into the hands of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors from
Judge Carroll Cook's department of the
Superior Court. The Supervisors, some
time ago, adopted a resolution to pay for
no more meals after February 1. Judge
Carroll Cook sent down bills all the name,
and also sent a communication to the
board.
So the issue was fully and fairly made
up. Last week the Judiciary Committee
refused to approve the bills, and the board
turned them over to the Finance Commit
tee.
"Move that we refer the matter to the
board as a committee of the whole," said
Dr. Rottanzi as chairman of the Finance
Committee.
This started up the discussion, which
took on many shapes. Dr. Rotianzi said
that dollar meals were too high and that
he favored standing by the action of the
board. The Penal Code was then consid
ered carefully. In that lurks foreshadow
ing of damp dungeons and meals which
cost the City only 10% cents per meal,
furnished to the Supervisors or others.
Also in that embodiment of legal wisdom
are provisions that jurors shall have shel
ter, food ami medicines.
"Suppose," Â«.aid Supervisor Haskins,
suggestively, "that we should cut down
the price for meals to 50 cents and ihat
jurors snould eat a dollar meal. Would
the restaurant-keeper take them into the
kitchen and make them wash dishes to
make up the balance?"
"Suppose we made a contract. We
coulfl send the jurors down in the Sheriff's
van," said another member.
After all the fun the bills were signed,
notwithstanding the vote of the board not
to approve them. This settles the matter
and a clash between the Supervisors and
the courts is averted.

Preparations in the Pavilion
for the Great Tug
of-War.
Long Pulls, Strong Pulls and
Pulls All Together o' Local
Athletes
Plan Adopted Which Will Permit
Each Team to Pull on a Rope
of I's Owa Choosing.
Carpenters under the supervision of T.
P. Macinnis are at work transforming the
interior of the Mechanics' Pavilion, in
which will take place the great test of
muscular endurance and strength to begin
to-night
The platform upon which the interna
tional giants will tug and pall for sunrem*
acy nas been planned by D. R. McNeiil,
who is originator of this sport in San
Francisco.
The platform stands in the center of the
main floor, running east and west, 120
feet in length, with a base of fourteen feet,
and six feet in height. This will give
sufficient e'evation to make the view clear
to all parts of the house. On the platform
one foot above the sides, where the cap
tains and referee will have their stations,
is the arÂ»a upon which the cleats are
nailed and upon which the rope will be
stretched.
The carriage with the indicators, which
will be ten feet in length, will be located
so that they will be visible in all parts of
the house.
An innovation has been introduced by
Mr. McNeiil. There will not be a contin
uous rope, as has been the case in earlier
contests. Each team will have the privi
lege of using its own rope. This is ar
ranged by placing an iron plate under the
carriage with two eyelets, one on either
end, in which the rope can be made fast.
This device does away with tampering
with the rope, by which one team would
have an advantage over the other.
On the sou:hside of the platform will
be an elevated stand for the ua, of the
members of the press and judges.
The distance over which the winning
team must pull to win has been reduced
from seven to five feet, covering ten cleats.
Heretofore seven feet or fourteen cleats
had to be covered in order to win.
The management will give special prizes
for individual pulls, with tbe object of se
lecting a team of the strongest men of all
nations represented in tlm State, to be
known as the California tug-of-war team.
It is the intention to nave tue learn travel
throughout this country and Europe and
finally appear at the Paris Exposition in
1900 and compete against tne worid, to
advertise California. A contrivance has
beÂ«Mi provided by which the force of an in
dividual pull will be registered, and the
man wno sends the indicator to the high
est notch will get $125. with less prizes for
the eight who follow him, thus picking
out from all the oomretitors the nine
most powerful men. These will be the
California giants to maKe a tour of all the
Eastern cities, finally bringing up in Pnr.s
in 1900 as one of the wonders ot tne Golden
State.
Festival of Seasons.
A festival of seasons will be held on March
2, 3, 4 end 5, at Grace M. E. Church, corner of

with the Brownie Band, Gleaners and country

Wednesday evening, the King's Daughters will
