SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 10. âThe
Perkins slate leaked out late to-night
and created commotion in the ranks of
the Perking following;, where it was
found that Colonel George Stone was to
wnlk into the ' auperintondency of the
Mint over the prostrate political corpse
of Senator Denlson of Alameda.
Senator Perkins seem* to have con
ceived a strong; antipathy toward the
representative men of his own county.
First it was Waymire who was thrown
down. Now it is Senator Deniaon.
Letters and tele grit from all parts
' of the State continue flowing in to the
legislators, saying that their constitu
ents are not for Perkins and that they
want a man of brains and energy like
Samuel M. Shortridge to represent this
great State in the United States Senate.
THE PERKINS SLATE.
Apportionment of Patronage as
Planned by the Man In
Washington.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 10.â There
was much tribulation in the ranks of the
faithful after the arrival of the last train
to-night, when it was learned that Sena
tor Perkins' slate had been made public
through an unfortunate leak on the part
of one of its custodians. The path of poli
tics sometimes meanders through dark
and narrow ways, and the slate is of itself
a map of those ways.
The friends of Eli Denison are furious.
They had speculated somewhat hereto
fore as to the reason why Colonel Stone
seemed so close to Billy Hamilton, man
ager for Senator Perkins, and why Colonel
Stone was spending his time ami breaking
his neck for Perkins, but the slate of
which the following is a copy, tells the
story :
For Superintendent of the
31intâ Colonel George Stone.
For Collector of the Port-
Colonel John P. Jackson.
For Surveyor of the Port â
Colonel Paris Kilnurn.
For 3faval Officer â Colonel
William 11. Hamilton.
For Collector of Internal
Revenueâ Colonel Daniel Cole.
For Postmaster â Colonel S.
W. Backus.
Every mother's son of them, from Alpha
to Omega, from the crown of his head to
the sole of his foot, a colonel, and Perkins
a colonel at thai ! All of them military
men for civil offices !

be placed above Senator Denison and the
rest. Tdey claim that they have done
ten times more for Senator Perkins ana
the party than the preferred coloneis, and
they are perspirinc in the neighborhood
of the collar about it.
The late trains brought up Samuel M.

Isaac Trumbo, Senators Mahoney and

bers and others, and the hotel lobby is
alive with political buzz.
SHORTRIDGE GAINS DAILY.
Men Who Feared to Antagonize
Perkins Are Now In Open
Revolt.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 10,-The
sentiment against the re-election of
Georee C. Perkins to the United States
Senate is hourly growing stronger, and as
a result Shortridge stock is perceptibly
advancing. The ballpt next Tuesday will
be a surprise to those people who have
accepted the talk of Perkins' strength as
truth. Men who were on the fence a few
days ago, fearinp to antagonize a candi
date who wa3 regarded as strong and
powerful, now speak their opposition
openly.
A time-honored Republican who Is not
slated for a Federal office said to-night:
"I have read Perkins' letter to Waymirej
and I declare that it is insulting. The idea
that Waymire should be excluded from
the cabinet because he is poor shows in
what light Perkins holds those who are
not rich. I predict that there will be a
poor man's ticket nominated for every
State office at the next general election.
The people will cast about for some effec
tive way of resenting this insult which
j Perkins has cast on the poor men of Cali
fornia.
"When the fight was on for President,
when Mnjur McKinJey needed roles, who
gave of their means to aid the Republican
cause? It is history known to men who
were in the thick of the light to carry this
State that Perkins contributed neither to

licans with the sinews of war C. N. Felton
offered to give $5000 if Perkins would con
tribute a like sum. Perkins pleaded pov
erty; said he had lost money in the steam
ship business and could not help the
party. It was then that John D. Spreckels
came forward with $5000.
"Perkins is making his fight to-iay on
promises of Federal patronage. The old
Federal ring has parceled out every
thing."
SUNDAY AT THE CAPITAL.
Members Find Time to Read Let-
ters Givinar the Drift of
Public Opinion.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 10.â After a
week of fog and damp, almost freezing
air, a Sacramento winter Sunday has
dawned upon the few visitors, left here in
a double sense, and has exchanged the
tule fogs for a cloudy sky and a light
breeze, so raw and cutting that even the
acclimated are hupping tbeir grates in
doors and telling th<- shivering stranger
that this is an exceptional season, and
that Sacramento has more sunny days
than Genoa, the Riviera, Athens, Algiers,
Marseilles, Los Angeles and Milpitas put
tosether. When the frozen victim who
has been dragged hither in the waka of
the legislative ship moans his doubts lie
is handed "The Bee Souvenir." which
gives columns of figures for the truth of
the felonious boast, and which contains
photographic pictures of orange and
banana trees in full bearing in the gardens
of the town in the depth of winter.
Against such proof as that of the cam
era, which is not like an editor and cannot
lie, what can the poor, shivering mortal
offer except bis pale gooseflesh. And if
the disgustel mortal linds walking difficult
by reason of his shoes carryinsr several
pounds of mud from the bituminized
pavements, which are the dirtiest and
muddiest in the world, he is referred to
the City Council, one member of which"
body declared right out in meeting that
river water flowing from a State prison or
a manufacturing town was the most
wholesome water in this wide, wide world j
to drink, and another member of" which j
declared that he had known cases where |
good . horses had . been poisoned by drink
ing water that had come from deep wells.
Some of â¢ the few legislators who did not
care to encounter the yaried seductions of
wicked San Francisco remained here and I
went to church and spent the remainder !
of the time reading letters and telegrams
in the well warmed and comfortable Sen- j
ate and * Assembly ' chambers. Those let- '
ters and telegrams were of a highly inter
esting character and iex&^iiitMn-yigot-J
ous language the laet ib&t the 'people did
not want Mr. Perkins re-elected to a posi
tion which he had shown his incapacity
to fill.- They said that it was time that
California should wake .up and take a
more " conspicuous and honored *. place
among the States of this Union, which
she could never do with men of small
mental caliber. It is many a long year
since California was proud of her repre
sentatives, and ,it is many a long year i
since her intellect, her statesmanship, her j
breadth of vision, her progressiveuess and j
her resistless energy were fittingly em
bodied in her 1 representatives in the
United States Senate. '
Since that time, long ago, of broad men
Califoruians have often had to blush for
the effigies which have sometimes repre
sented the State in the most august body
of statesmen in , the world. She has
blushed for shame at their incapacity, j
their narrow-mindedness, their selfish
ness, and. she has wept with chagrin for
their sins. , .
v So out of very shamefacedness the
Golden State is now raising a wail of pro
test against the perpetuation of what is
nothing "leas, than a crime against the
people, misrepresenting their intellect,
their learning, their eloquence, ' their
knowledge and their appreciation of true
statesmanship. â¢
'â  Her summer suns that know no cloud?,
her balmy airs mingling the refreshing
saltiness of the quiescent sea with the soft
and languorous odors of the orange and
the rose, the one ripening, the ; other
blooming side by side in the happy Cnrist
mastide, have ' created a new nation of
poets, orator?, artists and statesmen to fill j
up the great blanks left both in the old
and new worlds by the corroding tooth of
a decaying and a degenerate age. . ; And so
there has come to the thoughtful, the no
ble of the golden land, a yearning and a
regret, yearning for a better ambition in
the man who places the ballot of the free
man in the. box,. which is the only throne
we know or revere, and a regret that the j
fairest State in v the fair sisterhood should
be so cruelly caricatured in the Nation's
Capitol. '' â ': : ;> ~ : -. / ;"' ' '' :
People cannot help drawing a contrast
between the two., men now standing in the
focus of their vision above, all the. rest just
now in interest. " t They cannot help compar
ing the , learning, the manners, . the elo- I
quence, the courtesy, the cordiality and the
human warmth of hear tin the one and the
lack of these desirable qualities, or the
possession of them ; in the lesser' decree
by the other. â  They cannot help recalling
the energy,: the V unselfishness' and the
commanding influence that have not been
the characteristics of ''California represen
tatives in the Senate of the United States
for lo! these many years. It would not be
charitable to name the gentlemen who

Tardy though it may be of expression,
the sentiment is in the air that the time
has come for a'betterWdef, of things. i. It
reaches eta here on the perfumed wings of
the zephyrs that fly from the v orange
groves of 'the 3 sunny south and the foot
hills of J the North. It comes hither in
letters 'f and a rushes ; hither in tho ' captive

; :"\V ho * is there, leaving aside all question
of personal friendship, who does not com
pare the "^ capacity and the qualifications
of Samuel M. Shortridge with those of
George C. Perkins, and who does not say
that if Mr. Perkins represents the intel
lect and the statesmanship of California,
Mr. Shortridge would represent it more
truly and belter?
That is what is being done here to-day
in the Capitol building, in the hotels, in
the lobbies, in the saloons, on the side
walks, in the booses of friends and in ibe
family circle. There is only one result,
one opinion growing out of that compari
son, and that is that Mr. Sbortridge fairly
outclasses him on all points.
"Republics are ungrateful," is a savin *
as old as the big redwoods of California.
But it seems to be ever new here, and
| there are quite a large number of unfor
tunates who are saying it. If republics
ao not witbin the next two or three days
i cease to be ungrateful, and if they do not
display a keener appreciation of neglected
merit, the railroad ties for a radius of 100
miles of this place will be measured by a
grand arruy of patriots whose claims upon
the party "have been whistled down the
wind to prey at fortune."
Among the discontented, it may be said
rebellious, statesmen who have toiled for
the party by an incessant wagging of the
jaw are about twelve colored men who
have been here since New Year's day hop
ing against hope, and waiting most
patiently for the fulfillment of the prom
ises rashly made before election to le re
pented of at leisure afterward. Three
colnred men have beer, provided with
positions of trust and emolument, among
them 'Long John" Wilkins of San Fran
cisco, who was early in the session re
warded fora life of unswerving devotion
to the party by the dignified ana re
ponsible office of rear porter. The left
and the lorn sigh when the tall form of
'â¢Long John" looms up in the lobbies,
draped in a brand new overroat. and orna
mented with a pair of spectacles which
impart to him ati air of great wiÂ«dr,m, the
envy of his less lortunate colleagues.
The other night the weary waiters or
ganized a caucus in a corner of the office
of the Golden Eagle Hotel and passed a
verbal resolution to the effect that if their
claims were not recognizei very soon they
would withdraw their support from the
Grand Old Republican party and would
throw the whole weight of their influence
with the Democrats, who appear to be
come violently in love with the colored
man whenever that party is in a hopeless
minority and can't do anything for them.
It was stated at the caucus that Lieuten
ant-Governor Jeter had expressed the
opinion to one of tbeir number, Mr. Lafon,
that it was a burning shame and that he
would try to do something for them. The
caucus decided that if the colored men
were not given ten places they would go
over in a body, cast their fortunes with
the Democracy and ask it for a job.
"Long John" deprecates the action of the
colored men and says that it does not
speak well for the loyalty of any man
whon he allows himself to be governed by
selfish considerations.
James Kiddey, an old-time warhorse,
who made some very clever speeches dur
ing the last campaign on the subjects of
protection and the financial issue, is
among the ranks of the unappreciated and
unrewarded here. He says that it is hard
that a man like himseif, who did so much
for the party, should be left out in tne
cold, while men who did little or nothing
for the cause are enjoying the ease of mind
which accompanies a fat joD.
A whole lot of women, some of them
very good looking, have failed to tret any
thing to do in the way of clerkships and
'have gone home convinced that politics i.3
demoralizing. It is against all precedent
that a youn? and pretty woman should
not be able to Ret an appointment in a
California Legislature; but stranger things
than that happen in politics every day.
Major Don Jose Ramon Pico of the
classic shades of Berkeley is here again
looking after a claim which he has pre
sented for several sessions, and which
failed to pass at the last session because it
went too late to the Governor. The major
raised a company of soldiers in this State
and equipped them at his own expense
during the war. At that time he had
leagues of land and houses and cattle,
while he had a regiment of vaqueros in his
service. Since the close of the war he has
! become poor, and he asks the State to re
imburse him for the money expended by
bim in the time of the Nation's peril.
Another well-known San Franciscan is
domiciled here watching the Senatorial
tight. He is Sol Berliner, and he fills the
post of caretaker of the Shortridge head
quarters in the Golden Eagle Hotel. He
is said to be the best judge of i good cigar
whom Sacramento has ever seen.
WHY PERKINS IS LOSING.
Legislators Tlrlnar of the Methods
Pursued by "The Echo of
Steve White."
Since the adjournment of the Legislature
last Friday the Shortridge forces of the
Senatorial contest have gained a decided
advantage. No defections have taken
place and some gains of strength are re
ported. In the Per Kins camp the swagger
ing confidence manifested early last week
has given way to apprehension. It is pos
itively known tnat some of tho members
who were lured into the Perkins corral or
caucus at Sacramento will vote on the first
ballot for Samuel M. Shortridge.
Speaking of this attempted corraling of
Republicans at Sacramento an Oakland
Assemblyman saii yesterday: "In view
of Perkins' treachery in his dealings with
Judge Waymire I regard myself absolved
from all obligations imposed by the pre
tended caucus. Again, it has been made
clear to my mind that a caucus represent
ing less than the number required to elect
a United States Senator on joint ballot
has no binding force. Where Republicans
have attained the highest degree of intel
ligent independence the rule of King
Caucus is despised.
*'A caucus for the purpose of discussing
the merits of candidates is one thing and
a caucus called to bind men hand and
foot to the cause of a singie candidate is
quite another. In every State of the
Union Republicans of intelligence and
public SDint have emancipated thennelves
from the obnoxious slavery of the old-time
caucus system, which forced men to sur
render their convictions of right and
wrong at the bidding of a majority.
"I observe." continued the Assembly
man, "that Perkins is aptly named the
'Echo of Steve White.' Tnat's what he
is. The Democratic United States Sena
tor guides him and leads him in Wash
ington. Why cannot we have a straight
forward Repub ican of character, firmness
and intellect to represent California in the
United States Senate? In my judgment
the time is ripe for a change. If Perkins
fails to get elected on the first ballot, as I
believe he will, his followers will leave
him."
It transpires that in the letter which
Perkins wrote to Waymire, seeking to ex
plain his double-dealing in the indorse
ment of Horace Davis for the Cabinet,
Waymire was told in language that can
not well be misconstrued that Cabinet
offices were reserved for the rich. Way
mire was inferentially advised to look
for some other position or increase his
income.
The ex-Union veterans are decidedly
sensitive on this particular point. One
who served at the front through the war,
when Perkins was at home righting
against giving any mire recognition to
the negroes, expressed his indignation
freely :
"It is not enough," he said, "that the
rich should manage the trusts aud con
trol the industries of the land, but here
we have a United States Senator from
California saying to an old Union
veteran: 'You are too poor to live
in Washington and hold a position in
President McKinley's Cabinet?' It is my
opinion that Major McKinley will take
the measure of Perkins when Fedeial
patronage is to be given out. It's com
mon talk, you know â and no one disputes
it â that Perkins refused to contribute
money to the Republican State Central
Committee. While b.3 was holdine back
John D. Spreckels pat up $",000 for the
cause of protection and prosperity. Per
kins gave his jawbone in bi3 own behalf,
and so complicated the fight that Califor
nia would have been lost to the party had
it not been for the ability, generosity and
loyalty of John D. Spreckels, Major Frank
McLaughlin, Samuel M. Shortridge, Judge
Waymire and a host of other Republicans
who stand in to win tights."

SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 10.â To-day's
Mercury contained the following: Slate
Senator H. V. Morehouse returned home
from Sacramento yesterday for a two
days' visit. In the hot right for United
States Senator now being waged at the
Capital, Senator Morehouse is an enthusi
astic supporter of Samuel M. Shortridge,
and he is very hopeiui of the latter's ulti
mnte success.
"The chances of Samuel M. Shortridge,"
said Senator Morehouse yesterday after
noon, "are growing brighter every day.
The Perkins managers are maicing great
claims and lota of noise, but it is a case of
whistling to Keep up courage. The real
facts of the case are that they are alarmed
over the present status of affairs. There
is a great deal of feeling against Perkins at
tha Capital. His betrayal of his life-lone
friend, Judge Waymire, in the matter of
indorsement for a Cabinet position has
lost the present Republican United States
Senator many adherents.
"The claim of the Perkins managers
that they hod sixty Senators and Repre
tentatives in their caucus is baseless. They
bad just lifty-seven members all told. The
general sentiment is that unless such a
meeting haa enough members present to
carry oat its action it is not a caucus. As
there were not the necessary sixty-one
members present several who were in
the caucus do not consider themselves
bound to vote for Perkins and h.ive come
over to Shortridge.
"We have now fourteen votes sure for
Shortridge, and there is every indication
that we will have twenty on the first bal
lot next Tuesday. Perkins' only hope is
to spcure enough Democratic Senators
and Representatives to swell his vote to
the required sixty-one. It is my opinion
that this hope will be blasted, as I have
been informed that the Democratic mem
bers have held a conference and have
agreed to vote only for members of their
own party.
"All we have to do is to prevent the
election of Perkins on the first ballot,
when his vote will be at the maximum,
because a number of members were in
structed to suppoit him by the conven
tions that nominated them. On the sec
ond ballot the friends of Wavmire will
break away from Perkins and the vote of
Shortridge will ba materially increased.
The third ballot will in all probability
witness a breaking up of the Perkins
forces, as the instructed members, having
fulfilled their obligation, will then exer
cise their own choice. This will be the
t-reat opportunity for Shortringre, and I
believe that the efforts in his Dehalf will
be successful.

the merits of the candidate. The people
of Sacramento are taking a great interest
in the struggle, and as the demand for
The Call exceeds that of any other paper,
you can see whose fi-ht they favor. The
fitness Of Samuel M. Shortridge for the
place to which he aspires is generally
recognized, and his eiecion would be
gratifying to the people of the State at
large.
"I have known Mr. Shorlridge for
twenty-three years, and knowing as I do
his rare intellectual ability and sterling
character I shall deem it a hieh honor to
place him in nomination for United States
Senator to succeei George C. Perkins."
Interest in the Senatorial contest con
tinues to increase in this city, and many
hearty expressions of hope for the success
of Samuel M. Shortridge are made.
Speaking on the subject yesterday Mayor
Koch said: "Samuel M. Shortridge as
United States Senator would be of incal
culable benefit to this State and to Santa
Clara County in particular. He is an anle
man, a scholar and an indefatigable
worker in any cause he believes is right.
He would receive for this State due recog
nition from the Government, which has
not been given in the past. Th* repre
sentatives of this county should stand
Eolid for such a man as Samuel M. Short
ridge for United States' Senator, being one
of our own people."
Colonel T. R. Weaver, president of the
Board of Trade, said: "The election of S.
If. Shortruige as United States Senator
would, in my estimation, be a great benefit
to Santa Clara County as well as the State
at large. He is an able man, a hard
worker, and would make an excellent
Senator."
Dr. D. F. McGraw, president of the Santa
Clara County Republican League, said: "'I
consider it is time Santa Clara County is
recognized in the choice of United States
Senator. This county has always done its
best by the Republican party of this State,
but has never received proper recognit on.
If Samuei M. Shortridge i* elected Senator
it means that this county will be given
proper recognition. I consider him the
peer of any man in the United States
Senate to-day in ability, dignity and
s-cholarly attainments. And If he is
elected, as he should be, by the Republi
cans of California he wiil represent the
interests of his native State as they have
never been represented beiore. Besides
this, I think the Republican party owes
him this election. No man of the party
has been a more energetic worker in its
interest."
"I have known Samuel M. Shortridge
since boyhood, and his career to the pres
ent timo has been that of a progressive,
abie man, possessing eminently the quali
ties that make the most useful public
servant in high positions," said Dr. J. S.
Potts. "His integrity has never been ques
tioned any more than his ability. The
fact that he is not a wealthy man is a point
in his favor, and if he can be elected with
out the influence of great wealth and
without holding blocks of stock in any
great corporation, considerations that
have heretofore been indispensable in
Senatorial contests, it will be a great vic
tory for the people and mark a new and
brighter era in the history ot the State.
Heretofore the Western States, especially
California and Nevada, have notoriously
been held in reproach in the East on ac
count of the fact that a mouey con
sideration seemed to be ail that en
tered into the selection of men for
the high office of United States Sena
tor. The election of Mr. Shortria^e
would be an honor to California in many
ways- In fulfilling the duties of the office
he- would be broad as regards the interests
of the whole ertate, so that there would be
no possible cause for complaint in that re
gard, but at the same time he would have
special regard for the interest* of Santa
Clara County, where he was raised and
educated. In his career he has been above
reproach, and although yet a young man
he has reached an enviable position among
the eminent attorneys of the Slate. lam
personally acquainted with a large num
ber of the Senators and Assemblymen
from various portions cf the State, and I
can assure all my friends at Sacramento
that they will never have cause to regret
casting a vote for Samuel M. Short
ridge. The Democrats have no chance,
and they could not do better than to assist
in electing a conservative, able Republi
can, who could represent the people at
Washington in a manner to do honor to
all parties and classes. Every considera
tion demands the election of Samuel Al.
Shortridge as United States Senator."
"1 recognize the fact that Mr. fclhort
ridge is a ;;rand youn-i man and a great
orator, and it would be a fine thing for
Santa Clara County if lie could be elected
to the high office to which he aspires,"
said Banker David Henderson of Santa
C.ara. "The light seems to be an open
one now and there is no telling what
micht happen under such circumstances.
From some business dealings that I had
with him when he was a young man I
know that he has sterling integrity in his
makeup as well as gieat ability as an ora
tor and an attorney. Such qualities emi
nently lit a man for a great public trust."

PERKINS AIDS TO
EVADE THE LAWS
Chinese Can Land Any
where Below the Mexi
can Border.
The Senator's I fluence Helps to
Change the Exclusion
Regulations.
His Steamships Will Carry the Men
go's to a Point Whence They
Can Sneak Back.
Senator George C. Perkins, who is mafc
ing desperate but apparently futile efforts
to succeed himself in the councils of the
Nation, is gradually appearing in his true
colors as the champion of transactions
that love not the light.
His latest move was to make a success
ful attack on the Chinese exclusion regu
lations, which are considered the safe
guard of the commercial and moral inter
ests of California, and all because it put a
few Chinese dollars into toe pockets of
himself and the steamship company in
which he is interested.
When the Chinese exclusion act went
into effect with the amendments that
made it an effectual bar to the incursions
of Mongolian laborers, the Secretary of
the Treasury exercised his legal right in
adding certain regulations that were in
tended to make the law even more effi
cient.
The most important of these was to in
struct the Collector^ of the Port of San
Francisco that Chinese in transit from
loreign ports to points in Mexico must
not be siiipped to ports north of Salina
Cruz. This was done to prevent them
from landing at ports just below the
American line, whence they could in a
short time work their way into the United
States and thus defeat the exclusion act.
This regulation has been in effect for sev
eral years past and has kept the wily
Chinese from getting on to United States
soil from that direction.
The steamship lines in which Senator
Perkins is interested do not run as far
south as SaUna Cruz and have never had
a slice of the patronage of the Chinese
going into Mexico, and it has long been
Senator Perkin3' ambition to find some
way to circumvent the safeguards thrown
around the interests of California and
Caiii'ornians.
His opportunity came a few days ago,
when seven Chinese arrived by steamer
from Victoria in transit for Mexico. They
did not specify any port iv the southern
republic, but merely wanted to go to
Mexico, and Collector Wise, always on
the alert to prevent evasions of the ex
clusion laws, immediately scented a
rodent. He thought they were planning
to return to the United States and refused
to allow them to tranship to any other
point than Snlina Cruz. The Chinese ap
pealed to the Secretary of the Treasury
and Collector Wise also wrote defending
his position and asking instructions.
In the meantime Senator Perkins had
been appealed to by friends of the men,
and, spurred on by his own interests, he
immediately sent a long telegram to the
Secretary asking that the men be allowed
to tatte passage for Mazatlan or some near
by port.
Of course the men would travel by the
Perkins steamers, and many more, seeing
how easy .t was to get near the boundary,
would follow their example.
It was represented to the Secretary at
the time that the building of railroad lines
into Mexico had made it easy for Chinese
to disembark at points near the American
border, and that after all there was no
necessity of a regulation requiring the
Mongols to ship to Salina Cruz.
Tbe upshot of the matter was that the
Secretary sent instructions allowing the
seven Chinese to embark for any port
south of the border. It is probable that
hundreds mo>e will demand tbe same
rigbts, and that Senator Perkins will reap
a rich harvest from his little scheme to
override the wishes of the taxpayers of
California.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 10.â No lit
tle interest is being manifested in the
forthcoming national congress of mothers,
which will convene in this city on Feb

CHILEAN CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT.
Basis for a Satisfactory Settlement Be-
Hewed to Have at Last Been
Agreed Upon.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 10.-Secre
tary Olney and the Chilean Minister,
Senor Gana, have practically reached a
successful conclusion to the long neeotia
tions for a rehabilitation of the Chilean
claims commission, which ended its exist
ence by limitation nearly two years ago
without completing its labors. It is un
derstood that the commission will assem
ble in this city next October and consider
the remaining cases, of which seventeen
are American claims* against Chile, and
two, including that for the capture and
detention of the ltata, are supported by
Chile against the United Stales.
These constitute the sole causes for
friction between the two countries, which
have been notably cordial in their profes
sion of friendship for the past year, and it
â¢is bejieved tue settlement will dispose of
any lingering animosity which resulted
from the Baltimore and other incidents
which led the Chileans to the verge of war
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 1897.
with this country. The preseat visit of
Admiral Beardslee in the flagship Phila
delphia to Valparaiso is thought to have
contributed considerably to this result.
When the six months' existence of the
last commission, of which tie then Swiss
Minister, Alfred de Claparede, was presi
dent, came to an end after having disposed
of twenty-five cases every effort was
made by Secretary Gresham to induce
Chile to extend its term, but a Cabinet
crisis occurring in that country just at
that time it was found impossible to ac
compiish anything in that direction.
At the instance of this Government,
however, negotiations were resumed and
eventually Chile proposed an arrangement
for the pro rata settlement of the remain
ing cases by the payment of such amount
of the face of the remaining claims as the
aggregate amount awarded by the com
missioners on claims they had already set
tled bore to the face amount of the claims
left over. Chile pointed out that England.
France, Spain and other countries had
found this method satisfactory with their
claims, but the Administration insisted
that every claim had to be examined and
settled on its merits by a commission.
Cbiie then suggested a lump compromise,
and when this was also rejected, that Gov
ernment offered to agree to another com
mission, provided it sat at Santiago, as
the claimants were mostly Americans,
and on condition that the claim of the
North and South American Construction
Company should be ruled out.
Secietary Olney declined to consent to
either of these propositions and sought to
have the old commission rehabilitated as
far as John Goode. the American mem
ber, and Sonor Guna, tha Chilean mem
ber, were concerned, with a new president
in place of M. de Claparede, who had gone
home, and that the proceedings should
continue from the point at which they
were interrupted after twenty-five cases
had been adjudicated.
Fortunately ti year ago it was found pos
sibie to get rid of the North and South
American* Construction Company im
pediments, as, by a compromise. Senor
Gana paying Secretary Olney $150, 0U0, thiÂ«
was settled permanently. With this out
of the way it is understood that Chile has
at last consented to rehabilitate as far as
possible the old commission and nave it
complete its work next fall.
ROCKETS RISE OFF SHORE.
An Unknown Ocean Steamer Sending Up
Sgna/s of Distress Off the Nova
Scotia Co as .
HALIFAX, N. S., Jan. 10 A report re
ceived here late to-night states that an
unknown ocean steamer has been sending
up signals of distress off Whitehead, 100
mUes east of here.
When first discovered darkness was
coming on and she was about seven miles
distant, showing a flag calling for assist
ance, and seemed to be running in a west
erly course, keeping off shore.
After dart she discharged a number of
skyrockets. Thick snow squalls set in
about 7 o'clock, and nothing more has
been seen of her except an occasional
rocket.
When the signals were first observed the
schooner Hannah H. Elbridge and life
brat and several small boats started from
the shore toward the steamer. Up to 10:30
o'clock to-night the Elbridge or boats had
not returned.
An unconfirmed report here states that
the steame- belongs to the Furness line.
The Furness liner Damarari is eight days
overdue from Cardiff for this port with a
cargo of coal for the British naval authori
ties.
The steamer State of Georgia, from
Daitzic with a cargo of sugar, is also due
liere.
J. H. Hupill, the Halifax manager of
the Furness line, minks the ship in dis
tress is either the Damarnri or State of,
Georgia, unless it is some steamer bound
to a United State* port which has got out
of her course. Mr. Hu.zill is arranging
for a steamer to start for the eastern shore
as soon as possible.
The vess.-l is Btill reported signaling for
help and is in a dangerous position, as
hidden shoals and ledges ex'end for miles
along the coast from Whitehead.
At 11:15 o'clock to-night it was reported
from Whitehead that the lifeboat and
schooner Elbridge had retnrned without
finding the distressed steamer, owing to
the thick snowstorm, and had given up
the search.
A second schooner which went out re
turned with the same information. The
snow is falling heavily and the wind blow
ing from the southwest.
The keeper at Whitehead lighthouse
reports that the first signals he saw were
about 3:30 p. m., and they could be seen
until alter dark, when rockets were sent
up at Irequent intervals and continued un
til the snowstorm set in. The steamer
was schooner-rigged and bad dark-colored
funnels.
MONETARY CONVENTION.
Five Hundred Delegates Are Expected to
Aitend It at the Hoosier
Capitol.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 10.â The
monetary convention will open at 2 o'clock
next Tuesday afternoon in Tomlinson

The tickets bear the works, "Indianapolis
Monetary Convention, Tuesday, January
12, 1897."
The executive committee is trying to ar
range it so that all strangers coming into
town to attend the convention will be
taken care of. In responsa to numerous
letters from delegates the executive com
mittee has engaged* rooms at the leading
hotels. W. F. Golt, who has been ap
pointed serKeant-at-arms for the conven
tion, has appointed eleven assistants to

SHALL THEY BE

Appeal to Populists Raising
Financial and Party
Questions.
Popocrats the Kite and the
Democrats Are Called
the Tail.
An Ofiicial Call lor a National Con.
fereice of Forty leaders
atd WorJcers
BOSTON. Mass, Jan. 10.â George P.
Washburn, member of the People's party
National executive committee and chair
man of the Western headquarters during
the late campaign, has issued the follow
ing appeal to the Populists of the United
States:
We are to be congratulated upon the growth
of our party and the fact that in the recent
election nearly half the voters of the Union
indorsed much of our platform. Our party
alone Das a voting force larger than that
which elected Lincoln, and an able, effective
reform press of nearly 2000 papers. We hold
the balance of power in the United States Sen
ate and have four times as many Congressmen
as before.
We united with the silver forces In the re
cent campaignâ not because we believe free
coinage of silver is the solution of the finan
cial problem, but because it would better ex-
Isting conditions; would meet with the least
resistance and become the entering wedge for
our main issue, viz. : Full legal tender paper
money, issued and regulated by the Govern
ment alone. Having proved our loyalty at
the polls we are free to act separately on ad
vanced lines and to emphasize the real issues
our party was born to advocate. We cannot
in honor lay down our arms and cease our ac
tivity until the war for which we have enlisted
has ended in victory.
The Democratic party proposes to continue
the silver fight. The parties cannot exist on
the same issue. The greater absorbs the
smaller. Therefore if we remain mere camp
followers of another party disintegration will
result. Our party success alone forced the
Democrats to adopt the Chicago platform and
nominate a Popocrat for President. Converts
made by party regularity cannot be trusted
with the reforms of the future.
We ere not Democrats, and cannot be
classed as such. We simply united for a sin
gle campaign. The Democratic party is but
the rear guard of our own. We do not stand
for redemption money, but for a scientific dol
lar, kept invariable by proper regulation of
the money, volume.
The millions of converts to silver during the
recent campaign must advance. They will
not remain where they are. We inus* educate
them up to the main issue, and the time to do
it is now, not just before the Presidential elec
tion. We must also hold the Democratic party
to its present position or compel it to advance.
President Cleveland supplies us with fresh in
centive for renewed effort in his official de
mand for the retirement of the greenbacks and
the issue and control of paper money (except
coin certificates) by the banks. Senator Quay
says this should be made an issue by the Re
publicans, and advocates the substitution of
United States notes, payable in gold, for the
greenbacks.
We hare a living issue with both wings of
the gold forces, which brings our main ques
tion to the front: Shall the paper money of
the country be issued and regulated by the
people or by the banks? This will precipitate
a hot debate in Congress that will focus public
attention upon the relative merits of scientific
and redemption money, which will become
the Rbaorbing question ol the day, just as the
silver movement followed the silver debate a
year ago, and will aflord our sentlDels in
Congress an opportunity to measure the true
attitude of the silver Democratic and Repub
lican leaders on an issue vital to our party and
the welfare of 'he country, and determine to
what extent our recent allies can be depended
upon.
The proposed retirement of the greenbacks
and the discussion of the Pacific railroad
question will bring before Congress the two
strongest measures of our platform ; and what
ever the issues the other parties may adopt,
the logic of events will so force upon boih
Congress and the people the consideration of
these measures as to overshadow all others,
and win to our rauks thousands of voters from
both the Republican and Democratic parties.
Let us act with patriotism, courage and
sagacity. Let us lose no time. If any lack in
centive it will be fouud In the intense
suffering everywhere and in the increas
ing arrogance, lawlessness and heartlessness
of the turns and monopolies. Against their
power we put principle; against their money
we match manhood, and urge all Populists to
continue this contest during the next four
years, then hold an early National convention
and strike the keynote of the next Presiden
tial campaign, or, if desirable, establish an
honorable alliance on leading issues.
I would also suggest that a National confer
ence of party leaders and workers be held as
goon as practicable that we may have a full
and free expression of opinion regarding our
future work. We hope, therefore, that the re
form press will give the fullest possible expo
sition ol ttieir views on tuis important ques
tion, and our friends are invited ts write me,
or the National chairman, expressing their
ideas on the independent party action herein
proposed.
Shall we march to victory under our own
banner or conliuue as stragglers under an
other? '
AGED LADY ABDUCTED.
Kept a Prisoner and Taken Away by
Relatives, With the Idea of Getting
Hold of Her Property.
CHICAGO, 111, Jan. 10.â Mrs. E. W.
Wilson, the aged sister of C. C. P. HoldÂ«n,
a prominent and wealthy Chicagoan, was
abducted nearly three weeks apo, and no
trace of her whereabouts has been dis
covered. Mrs. Wilson is a woman of
wealth and 79 years of age. She holds a
great deal of property at Fort Madison,
lowa, where she has lived until a year ago.
Thirty years ago, at Fort Madison, Mrs.
Wilson took into her home a child named
Etta May, whose unnatural mother had
threatened to throw the little one into the
Mississippi River. Mrs. Wilson raised the
unfortunate child, but did not legally
adopt her. She was given a fine education
and every advantage.
When she was grown she mariied a
man named Frank Tmesdeil at Fort Mad
ison, lowa. Her husband and her three
children are now at Fort Madison. Rela
tives of Mrs. Wilson claim that Mr?.
True-dell has complete control over the
old lady, and charge the abduction to her.
For the purpose of getting Mrs. Wilson
away from the influence of her foster
daughter her relatives persuaded her to
come to Matteson, 111., where she could
live near her two brothers. About three
months ago she received a call at her new
home from Mrs. Truesdell. It was at
nL'ht, and she was accompanied by Hal
E. McNiel, who, it in said, has since as
sumed the name of E. M. Truesdell. They
came in a closed carriage. That night
they took Mrs. Wil on to Port Madison,
lowa. Before the ri-latives realized what
was beins; done Mrs. Wilson had dis
charged E. Johnson, the old and reliable
agent of her estate, and had put True-deli,
the husband of Etta May, into entire
charge.
Relatives immediately applied for the
appointment of a guardian for Mrs. W 11
--son. Edward A. Johnson, her former
agent, was made guardian, but before this
could be brought about Mrs. Wilson had
deeded her old homestead to Etta May
TruesdelJ. This vroperty was quickly sold
by Mrs. Truesdell, but she has received
only a small part of the purchase price
as yet.
Mr. Johnson took charge of Mrs. Wilson,
who was induced to return to her home at
Matteson. Two days after the old lady
bad arrived at her Illinois home Etta May
Truesdell put in an appearance there, ac
companied by a man wno claimed to be
an attorney. Mrs. Truesdell asked Dr.
Holden to allow Mrs. Wilson to go with
her to the city to witness her marriage to
Hal E. McNeil, as she explained this
proposition, by saying that she had se
cured a divorce irom Truesdell. Oid Mrs.
Wilson told Dr. Holden that if her foster
daughter Emma was to be married again
she fe!t that she ought to attend the cere
mony and permission was given.
This was December 18. Fearing fonl
play i)r. Holden reported the case to the
police, and after two weeks of search the
three peoDle were found at 26 Aberdeen
street on December 28. Here McNeil and
the Truesdell woman were livinc as Mr.
and Mrs. E. M. Truesdell, and Mr 3. Wil
son was kept a virtual prisoner. The
three were living together in a single
room with only a double bed for ten days.
Two or three nights old Mrs. Wilson had
been obliged to sleep sitting in an arm
chair with no extra covering to protect
her from the ni^ht air. Roomers had
heard her crying and begging piteously to
be sent home.
Mrs. Truesdell induced Mrs. Wilson to
remain one day longer, and when Dr.
Holden called f^r her the next day the
room was vacant. The police have re
newed their efforts.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Jan. 10.
âOfficial advices received here from Jer

trouble among the worshipers at the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
It appears that the Roman Catholics
were opposed to members of the Orthodox
Greek Church entering the church by a
certain door on the eve of January 6, the
day observed by the Orthodox Church as
Christmas. The latter insisted upon their
right to enter and the result was that the
two factions became involved in a serious

authorities intervened to restore order.
Some of the comoatants were badly in

Major McKinley said to a friend that

probable that both of these important

cepted by the end of the week.
Senator Sherman has had some com
munication with Major McKinley, and he
will go to Canton whenever the President
elect desires him to.* His visit will, ac
cording to present arrangements here,
be made about the middle of the week. It
is now pretty well established that Major
McKinley wants Senator Sherman to oe
Secretary of Sta'e, but it is by no means
certain that Mr. Sherman has made up his
mind to accept a Cabinet appointment.
His inclination is to remain in the Senate,
where the work is systematized and
familiar and where he can regulate the
amount and cmality of it to a very consid
erable extent.
The natural ana timely desire of M. A.
Hanna to go to the Senate may have much
to do with Mr. Sherman's appointment to
the Cabinet, if he accepts a portfolio. Mr.
Hanna has betn one of Mr. Sherman's
most valuable friends. He has done a
great deal for him in a political way, and
Mr. Sherman doubtless feels that he owes
his last election to the Senate in part to
the zeal and support of Mr. Hanna. Their
relations have been friendly and cio.-e for
years. If Mr. Sherman does not accept
the offer of a Cabinet position, the way to
the Senate will remain closed to Mr.
Hanna, for he would not contest the seat
with his personal and political friend of
long standing.
It is rumored to-night that Senator
Joseph 13. Foraker of Cincinnati will be
invited to visit Canton while Mr. Sherman
is there. Upon the action of Mr. Foraker
and his friends the Senatorial aspirations
of Chairman M. A. Hanna depend. Gov
ernor Bushnell will appoint Mr. Sher
man's successor for the unexpired term uf
two years if he goes into the Cabinet. He
is a devoted friend of Senator-elect For
aker, and it may be that it is feared that
he would not appoint Mr. Hanna to the
vacancy for the reason that they belong to
opposite factions of the party and have
been at odds in a political way for several
years.
The impression prevails among many
of the politicians that while Messrs. For
aker aud Bushnell are thoroughly friendly
to Major McKinley and desire to support
him loyally and efficiently, they do not
wish to build up Mr. Hanna's personal
prestige and power in the Ohio political
field. No promise or intimation of the
course he will pursue has been obtained
from Governor Bushnell, who is ill with
la grippe at his home in Springfield. The
belief is current in Ohio tnat unless Gov
ernor Bushnell will consent to the ap
pointment of Mr. Hanna to the Senate
the latter will himself accept a Cabinet
appointment. So the conferences at Can
ton this week involve she probable dispo
sition oi two Cabinet portfolios, a seat in
the United States Senate and the future
status of Mark Hanua in National poli
tics.
A week ago to-day Senator Cullom of
Illinois came to Cleveland to call on the
President-elect. He said to the corre
apondent of the United Associated Presses
in the course of a long conversation: "I
am not a Cabinet possibility. It seems to
me that it is my duty to remain in the
Senate."
Events have marched with celerity dur
ing the iast week, and political conditions
are changing daily. Notwithstanding the
fact that one week ago Senator Cullom
believed he could not accept a Cabinet
portfolio if it were offered to him, he is to
day a potent possibility.
Tna gossip about ex-Governor John D.
Long ol Massachusetts and the Cabinet
seems to have a pretty strong basis for its
existence. Major McKinley knows Gov
ernor Long well, and has always had a
high opinion of his character and abiJity.
The "availability of Judge Nathan Goff
for a Cabinet position daily becomes more
manifest, and if a Secretary of State is
chosen this week and a Secretary of the
Treasury the week following, Judge Goff
is likely to be the next possibility who
will become a reality. If be is a mem bar
of the Cabinet he will doubtless be Attor
ney-General or Secretary of War. He has
been a Cabinet officer, and is on the
United States bench.
Should Senator Sherman decide to re
main in the Senate three Eastern men
will be considered in reference to their
availability for appointment as Secretary
of State, They are Stewart L Woodiord
and Anurew D. White of New York and
Ex-Governor John D. Long of Massachu
setts. 0; iho New York men General
Woodiord is thought by those who are
speculating upon the Cabinet to have
the better chance, but this is a matter of
surmise.

The Depression Caused by
Disease Is Dispelled.
"niSEASES, ESPECIALLY THOSE OP

cept by a treatment that strikes directiy ?*
at the root of the trouble. The new, origi- .
nal and marvelous method ot treating dis- I

Medical Institute is one that never tails.
The salutary effects of â  the treatment on
any disease are at once perceived and a
speedy and permanent cure is invariably \

accomplished in the treatment and cure of
all diseases.
The Institute is splendidly equipped
with every device known to the scientific
world for administering medical electric-
ity, including large Static. Faradic and
Galvanic batteries, Electric . Beits, Body
Batteries and a great variety of other
electric appliances that are manufactured

Hair- -Raiting Story of Three â â 'mencarta
Who Hare Item to Cubi.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 10.â James
Magnire, "ccoaipanied by Jeremiah Bonds
of New York and Charles W. Alien of
Stanford, Conn., arrived on the Southern
express from Key West, Fla., on Satur
day end they tell a tale of adventures in
Cuba.
On the 10th of ia=t September the trio,
in company with William Barry, also of
New York, started for Cuba to join the
forces of the belligerents, and arrived in
-Havana on September 21.
Here they fell in with Jcsef Ruiz, a
Cuban patriot, who volunteered to guide
the quartet to the retreat of the Cuban
commanders. They headed for the Pinar
del Rio district, and when near Madrid j
were surprised and taken prisoners by
Spaniards, who decided to kill them. Re
cognizing the desperate situation they
decided to risk their lives in a vigorous
effort to escape.
Alter dark they loosened the ropes that
bound them, and grabbing rifles and ma- |
chetes they attempted to get away, but j
the Spaniards pursued, tiring a double j
volley. jPSS^I
Barry fell, shot through the heart, at
.the first fire, and Bond's right arm was
MTerfo-hited by a bullet. The surviving
â  .-outdistanced their pursuers. They
made every effort to get back and recover
Barry's body, but were unsuccessful.
After a tortuous and wearisome journey,
they arrived in the resion of San Cristo
bal. Here they arranged with an old man
to stop and rest at his house for a few
days. H s daughter betrayed them, and
on the morning of the second day they
v.ere awakened by a burly Spaniard in a
Spanish uniform.
Allen drew his revolver and fired. The
Spaniard fell, the ball having penetrated i
his rig.it eye and passed through his j
brain, causing almost instant .death.
Tney then toot to the loafTand from |
there sought refuge in a sued, which the '
Spaniards tried to burn, Making a great j
effort they got through the line of soldiers, I
who started in pursuit. For miles the
chase was kept up, but the quartet man
aired to keep ahead.
Weary, hungry and suffering intensely
from their wounds, they made their way
farther into the mountain* until they
came to a deserted cabin. No sign of life
was within or without. Here the four
recruits made their home for four days, â â 
living only on birds they could shoot and
the hard water found in an old well on the
premises.
On the fourth day they were surprised
by a body of Spanish patrollers. Sick and
weary, the men made no resistance and
surrendered. Their hands were tied be- !
hind their backs and they were compelled ;
to march for a distance of over ten miles,
when they were thrown into prison.
The next day they were forced to march
again until late in the afternoon, when
they were put in another prison, ana so
they were marched from prison to prison
until Havana was reached.
Here they were again thrown into pris- |
on. On December 23 the three Americans i
â  â â 'â :â â¢ brought before General Weyler. j
Th â â¢-.] were told that Ruiz, the young Cv- |
ban, had committed suicide by shooting
himself with a revolver which he snatched
from one of the guards. V
They discredit the suicide story and are
convinced that the younp Cuban was mur
dered. They were offered their liberty if !
they would sign a paper swearing allegi
ance to the Queen ol Spain and promising
on oat.i to do all they could against the
Cuban cause iv the United States. This
they agreed to do and the thrc3 were re
leased. , â

Captain. Myer*' Report of the ljfi*t Trip
of the OauntlcMS.
JACKSONVILLE, FtA., Jan. The
official report of Captain John W. Myers
of the steamer "Dauntless regarding â¢ the
last trip of the vessel was completed yes
terday and forwarded by the Collector of
Customs tne Secretary of the Treasury.
In tins report Captain Myers pves a de
tailed account of tlie trip. He tells all
about finding the men left at No Name
Kfy by the steamer Three Friends and of
taking the men off the key and transfer
ring them to another steamer. As tbe
report shows that the Dauntless was on
an errand of mercy rather than a filibus
tering expedition, it is very probable that
the vessel w:il not be libeled for any vio
lution of the neutrality or navigation
Stwi.
\W. A. Bisbee, the owner of the vessel,
jsaJixious to secure clearance for the ves
eel to Non vitas, Cuba, as he has a contract
to deliver a cargo of arms and ammuni
tion at that point. Nothing further' has
been heard of orders for the United States
dispatch-boat Dolphin to accompany the
Dauntless .whenever that Vessel may.'.be
granted clearance and leaves this port. ' ; :
The.'revenue cutter Bout well went down
to the bar early yesterday morning and
carried Captain Clover, commander of the
Dolphin, out to his vessel, The Dolphin
has not yet entered the St. Johns River
and she will not come in until the tides
begin to run a little higher.
The cruiser Newark is still anchored off
the bar. She has been there for nine days
and in that time no attempt has been
made by any vessel to carry out an expedi
tion of ally kind. In fact there is no boat in
this port that is available for this work,
as the Three Friends is in the hands of
the marshal, and the Dauntless is in the
custody of an officer of the Boutwell.
The investigation by the Cubans under
the direction of General Nunez and Hora
tio Rubens of the sinking of the Commo
dore has not yet been concluded and noth
ing has been done toward making the re

Say thÂ« Cuban Resolution Hat a Poor
Chonee for Returrection.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 10.â "The
chances for resurrection of the Cuban reso
lution are about as good as for the passage
of the Pacific funding bill," said Senator
White to-day; "that is to say, the chances
are very poor."
The California Senator is at present
deeply interested in both oft ese proposi
tions. It is understood that Senators White
and Teller had a conference yesterday to
try and devise ways and means to bring
up the Cuban resolution.
They are aboui convinced of the hope
lessness of it, however, for obstructionists
in the Senate will not permit it to be
broucht forward. Ii is tue opinion of Sen
ators White and Teller that at least part of
the opposition comes from friends of the
incoming administration. One of the
Senators said that in his opinion Presi
dent McKinley would adopt the policy
regarding Cuba now pursued by the
Cleveland administration.
Senator White believes this to be true
and he has talked to members of Congress
ana others who bare recently returned
from Canton. It is said upon excellent
authority that Major McKinley does not
desire the passage of the Cuban resolu
tion.

RACING STABLES BURNED.
The Noted Tiddleywinks and Thirteen
Other Hones BurnedâHeroic Fidel iff
of Tony Brown, a Jockey.
NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 10.â The extensive
racing stables of the Norfolk Driving Club
and Fair Association were burned to-day.
Thirteen of the racing horses, including
John Mariner's $10, 000 Tiddleywinits, were
cremated.
The fidelity of Tony Brown, hostler, to
this horse will probably cost him his life.
In attempting to lead the horse from the
burning building he was frightfully
burned about tho face and back and his
recovery is considered extremely doubtful.
The loss will be about $30,000, on which
there is barely $2600 insurance.
William Burnett, a colored watchman,
was at first supposed to have been burned
alive, but he was later seen in the city and
was arrested, charged with having fared
the building. A northeast gale which
prevailed at the time saved the large
grandstand from destruction.

The Nicaragua Canal Bill Believed
to Be Dead During This
Congress.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 10.â Voting
upon the Pacific railroad funding bill and
amendment* will occur in the House to
morrow. The vote is likely to be close,
i but it is believed the bill will be defeated.
For the remainder of the week appro
priation bills will probably have the right
of way. The managers of the House are
determined that no measures imposing
additional charges either upon the credit
or the revenues of the Government sball
receive consideration nt this session if
they can prevent it. The Nicaragua cnnal
bill and several other propositions in
volving financial responsibilities may
therefore, be considered dead, bo far as
this Congress is concerned.
On Saturday afternoon the House will
constructively listen to eulogies upon the
tate ex-Speaker Crisp of Georgia.
In the Senate to-morrov Mills of Texas
is booked for a speech on Cuba. His text
will be the resolution he introduced a few
days ago recognizing the independence of
the republic of Cuba, declaring it to be
the duty of the executive to act in har
mony with Congress in recognizing a new
State, and appropriating a sum sufficient
to pay a diplomatic representative to the
republic when the President shall have
appointed one. The extreme position
taken by Mr. Mills leads to the belief that
his speech may be, to some extent, sensa
tional and that bis criticism of the atti
tude*of Mr. Olney may be severe.
Senators are awaiting the return to the
city of Mr. Cameron, who is in charge of
the Cuban question. There does not ap
pear to be any desire just now to push the
recognition resolutions.
Proctor of Vermont has given notice
that to-morrow he will address the Senate
on bis resolution for a constitutional
amendment making the Presidential office
a six-year term and the occupant ineligi
ble for two terms in succession ; also
making the terms of members of Congress
three instead of two years.
Early in the week the attempt will be
made to secure a vote on the Oklahoma
free homestead bill, and when that is out
of the way the Senate's Pacific railroad
funding bill may be taken up, unless
the House shows such hostility to Pacific
railroad legislation as to make the at
tempt hopeless.

Conflict Jltttceen Jotca'm Executive and
Judicial Department*.
DES MOINES, lowa. Jan. 10.â Governor
Drake must commission John R. -Prime as
brigadier in command of the First Brigade
of the lowa National Guard or answer for
contempt of court. In case he is brought
up for contempt, the Governor's attorney
, has stated be will pardon himself, and the
interesting spectacle will be presented of
! the executive and judicial departments in
i direct conflict with each other.
Nearly a year ago Prime was elected by ;
the First Brigade as its commander.
Adjutant-General Wright had befriended
, James A. Guest, his opponent, and de-
I clined to admit Prime's election. ; He
ordered a new election and again Prime
won. Then the vote was so canvassed as
to throw out a large number oi Prime
votes. GaeÂ»t was declared elected and
was commissioned. Prime sued for 7 a
mandamus to compel the Governor to
commission him. The case has been
| pending several months, and yesterday
Judge Spurrier decided it. He holds that
Prime was elected, that only personal
spite actuated the adjutant and Governor
in refusing mm the commission, and
holds that the Governor must commission
him at once. .
Attorney-General Ramley Â« represented
the Governor at the trial. He declared
the Governor's authority as Commander
in-chief of the guard paramount to t c
I court's, and said he would not ob3y its
! orders; if committed for . contempt,* : he
would pardon himself.
r. The defense will appeal at once, and an
early ' hearing is expected. Prime will
commence a proceeding to- oust (iuest as
commander of the brigade, and some sen
sational features are expected, as the Gov
ernor is expected to refuse to obey the
court's orders. ,

EXPLORER PEARY LECTURES.
His Adventures in Greenland Told io a
Large Audience in the Btockiyn
Academy of Music.
NEW YORK.N. V., Jan. 10.â Lieutenant
Robert E. Peary, the Arctic explorer, for
nearly two hours last night entertained a
large audience at the Academy of Music
in Brooklyn with his new lecture, em
bodying his observations in his trip to
Greenland last summer. None of his pre
vious lectures have been more replete with
instructive and picturesque description of
the borne of the "Arctic Highlanders" and
the habits and manner of life.
From the beginning to the close Lieu
tenant Peary illustrated the scenes, inci
dents and people of the North with re
markably fine lantern slide pictures, many
ol them beautifully colored and all of
them, as he assured his audience, true to
lile with regard to the origin of the Green
land Eskimos.
Lieutenant Peary is inclined to adopt
the theory of President Markham of tne
Royal Geographical Society of Great Brit
ain â that they are the remnant of an an
cient Siberian trice, the Onkilon, which
was driven to the Arctic Ocean by the <
waves 01 the Tartar invasion, passed to'
the New Siberian islands ami thence to
the northern grant and archipelago.
He described the Arctic Highlanders as
resembling children in disposition and
temperament â simple, kindly, cheenul
and hospitable. In their ability to make
use to the fuliest exientof the few posi
bilities of their country they were, in his
opinion ahead of any other aboriginal
nicp. He could find no trace of any reii
gion among the people, although holding
the superstitions customary among sav
age race 3.
At the close of thÂ« lecture the staee cur
tain was raised and an Esquimau village
revealed with its twelve inhabitants with
their dogs and sleighs, movinc about in
their native costumes and encaged in
their usual occupations. The Esquimau
huts and kayaks and the other Arctic sur
roundings made a pretty scene.

MODESTO, Cal., Jan. 10.â A runaway
accident yesterday resulted in the death
of the son of one of this county's well
known residents.
Blakeley Wallis, 17 years of age, son of

freed from the implement.
The noise attracted the mother and two
sisters of young Wallis. They found him
under the scraper, with its blade resting
upon him.
No men bein~ present, they had to lift
the machine off his body. He retained
consciousness, and died about 6.30 o'clock

BERLIN, Germany. Jan. 10.â Count
Goluchowski, Austrian Minister of For
eign Affairs, will arrive in Berlin on Janu
ary 11. The ostensible object of his com
ing is to take part in a meeting of the
members of Ihe German order of the Red
Eiigle, of which he wears the decoration
of the Grand Cjoss, but it is known beyond
the possibilily of doubt that the purpose
of 1)13 visit is to confer with the Emperor
and Prince Hohenlohe. the Imperial Chan
cellor, upon matters affecting the posi
tion of Austria in the Dreibund.
The radical changes in the artillery arm
of the German military service, which it
is tue intention of the Government to
effect if 'he assent of the Reichstag to the
proposals for that purpose can be ob
tained, will necessitate the pursuit
of a similar policy in the army of
Austria-Hungary, involving an estimated
expenditure of at least 80,000,000 florins.
If, as the result of the conference of the
Emperor, Couat Gulochowski and Prince
Hohenlohe, the Kaiaer should advise si
multaneous reforms in the armies of the
powers signatory to the Dreibund it will
be a question as to how far in that direc
tion Austria will be able to assent, while
it will be a matter of still greater doubt as
to whether its ally will be able to meet
the financial demands which the reforms
required will entail.
Despite its importance from every point
of v iew, however, the question of new
armaments is a matter of minor con
sideration compared with the crisis
in the international relations of the
Dreibund powers arising from the policy
of Russia in regard to Turkey. Indeed
nobody, even the diplomats themselves,
knows wnat will be the result of the con
ferences of the Embassadors in Constanti
nople. Baron de Calice, the Austrian
Embassador to Turkey, who, by reason of
his precedence as dean of the diplomatic
corps, presides at the conference, does not
appear to send reports of the proceedings
of the meetings to Count Goluchowsti
which that statesman is justified in re
gardiirg as of a comforting character, and
it is understood that the Austr.au Gov
ernment desires a luller and more explicit
understandins with the German Emperor
as to what action Germany will take in
tne event of an outbreak requiring the
armed intervention of Austria.
The nomination by the Kussian Em
peror of M. Shishklu as the successor of
Prince Lobanoff in the office of Russian
Ministei of Foreign Affairs, with Count
Muravieff as his coadjutor, occupying the
position previously tilled by M. Shishkin,
has greatly retarded the outlook from the
Drelbund point of view. Count Muravieff
was at one time secretary of the Russian
Embassy in Berlin, and is known to be an
intense partisan of the French and a pro
nounced German opponent.
Commenting upon his appointment as
the active Russian Minister, the Yolks
Zeituug declares that it will drive the
wedge which will bring about a dual alli
ance, if such a thing can be accomplished.
Germany, ihe paper adds, will rind her
present support of the policy of Russia in
the East a great mistake and should by all
means turn toward England.
The St. Petersburg Novosti declares that
the settlement of the difficulties in Tur
key cannot imply an extension of the
Austrian empire. "The Balkan penin
sula," this inspired journal says, "must
be handed over to tne Balkan peoples.
The question concerning Asia Minor and
Egypt can be settled under a Franco-
Kussian and British entente and Con
stantinople made a tree port."
In view of the semi-official utterances
and the known circumstances it is clear
that the Austrian Government fear 3 the
further development of the situation and
is sending Count Goluchowski here to as
certain the exact situation and learn pre
cisely what Austria may reiy unon in the
event of certain conditions ot affairs.
The Sultan has sent Grumbkoff Pasha
to Berlin as the bearer of an autograph
letter to the Emperor expressing the
thanks of the Suitan for the attitude as
sumed toward him by the Kaiser in pre
venting encroachments upou his preroga
tives.
The combination of brokers against the
time-dealing clauses of the Stock and Prod
duce Exchange reform account will only
succeed it the Government allows the
tenor of the act to be ignored. The
produce exchanges, which have been dis
solved and whoso late members continue
both cash and time dealings under the
guise of free associations, cannot be
brought- back into business life by the
mere fiat of the Government, but the free
associations are mistaken in supposing
that the act cannot check either opera
tions in "futures" if the authorities use
their powers.
When the brokers' intention to drive
through the act first became known the
Nord Deutsche Zeitung published, an
official intimation that its provisions
applied to all speculative business, time
ami other dealings transacted outside as
weil as inside the bourses. The scheme
â which the brokers, banks and their clients
have devised for the evasion of the act,
and which is now in full operation, set the
law absolutely at naught. The Govern
ment must either undertake a persistent
ana wholesale system of prosecution or
submit to seeing the act become a dead
letter. The Agrarian press, in rather
hesitating terms, demands prosecution,
and the Government is undoubiedly
reluctant to act. Probably tee issue of
this legislative mistake, which is now
recognized by the moderates of the
Agrarian party as something of a blunder,
will be the early appearance in the
Keichstag of another bill rescinding the
obnoxious provisions of the present law.
An extraordinary story regarding the
partition of China among tue leading
European powers, which has been gravely
discussed In, the German press, originated
in Herr Eugen Wolf's letters from Tien
Tsin to the Tageblatt. Herr Wolf has
never lacked audacity as a correspondent.
Upon the slender basis of the Russo-
Chinese railway convention he built up a
new version of the often-heard-of and as
often contradicted "secret treaty," with a
fanciful superstructure of its results.
Chios is to be dealt with like Africa.
Russia's sphere is to extend to the Yellow
Kiver, the German sphere from the Yel
low Kiver to the \'an Tse Kiang; tbe Eng
lish indefinitely south of the Yun Tse
Kiang, and the French northward from
Yunnan, meeting the English sphere. The
partition was suggested rather as a com
mercial than apolitical division, in which,
it will be observed, the American interest
was ignored.
Not a shred of truth, not even of prob
ability, ju-stilies this romance. The Rus
sian Emuassador at Pekin, Count (Jassun,
who is credited with achieving a tremen
dous diplomatic triumph by first securing
the Russian sphere oi influence in the
north, has, according to St. Petersburg
advices, obtained nothing beyond a
diminution of frontier dues by one-third
as a cence.-sion in connection with the
Eastern Chinese Railway. It is question
able whether this privilege can be \vorkel
without iis being granted to all countries
having commercial treaties with China
containing the mostfavuied nation clause.

The members of the Reichstag who will
represent the sugar interests do not in
tend to endanger what they have got by
asking for more. They will oppose any
reduction in the bounty grants or altera
tion in the arrangement lor 1896-97, and
they have a majority ol the Keichsiag
wiiu them. /
The export of German raw sugar to the
Uniied States assumed enormous pro
portions m the past year. From January
to November last the totals were 12,397,191
double (or meter) huudred-weigut, as
against 473, 1Â£4 in 1395 and 075,057 in 1894.
The raw sugar exports to England during
these periods fell off largely.
All of the German States have ap
proved the sentiment expressed iv the
recent ea:ct ot the Emperor in regard to
dueling in the army and have adopted his
Majesty's suggestions in regard to the re
ferring of disputes to courts of honor in
stead of a resort to independent action on
tne part of the principals.
Th youthful Imperial Princes visited
and in their peculiar way inspected the
new Reichstag building on Tnesday. The
Youngsters were conducted by Councilor
Knark. Their visit was somewhat formal
at, its beginning, but when the boys
reached the spacious lobbies and later en
tered the hall in which the sittings of the
Reichstag were held they ran about lik^
{â¢choollaoys at play, as they really were.
When they were ushered into ihe session
hall and had its uses explained to them
the imperial children expressed their as
tonishment at its arrangement, which
required men of middle and advanced age
to sit at desks all in a line like schoolboys
and laughed heartily at the idea. Tue
boys were presented with photographs of
the session hall and oth^r parts of the
building, but paid little attention to
Counciior Knork's description of the
character of the great bui.dmg.
Tne North German Gazette, an Inspired

SONOMA CHURCH DEDICATION.
Impressive Ceremonies Conducted by
Archbishop Riordan, Assisted by the
Pastor and Visiting Divines.
SONOMA. Cal., Jan. 10.â The new
Church of St. Francis Solano, which has
just been completed on the site of the old
building, which was accidentally de
stroyed by lire some months ago, was
dedicated this morning by Archbishop
Riordan, assisted by Rev. Father Quill,
rector of the parish, and visiting clergy
men from San Francisco and Petalurna.
The ceremony was very impressive and
the music appropriate to the occasion.
Miss Caroline Hersey sang the Christmas
canticle, "Xoel."
The parish of St. Francis ranks among
the oldest in ISorthern California. As
early as 1823, it is said, Franciscan priests
were here as missionaries among the In
dians.
Shortly afterward the late General
Vailejo appeared on the scene, and due
largely to Iris efforts the old .Mission
Church was constructed. This church,
witli its long adobe convent, is still
standing, but it has long since
passed out of the bands of the priests,
and since it 3 abandonment twelve years
ago, when a new church was built in a
more populous part of the city, it has
been employed as a storeroom for hay
and grain.
The new church is a handsome struc
ture, of pure Gothic architecture, and is
in every way suited to the needs of a
large and growing congregation.

INDIAN UPRISING
AT CAPE MUDGE
Suppression of a " Potlach n
May Lead to Dire
Results.
The Son of a Defiant Chief Is
Carried Off by Whit?
0 ficials.
Whisky-Crszed Tribesmen Vow Ven
geance, and Settlers Fear
a Massacre.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 10.â Edward
Wilson of Gape Mudge, on the northeru
coast of this province, arrived in the city
last night to seek help of the Indian De
partment to avoid a threatened uprising
of the natives. The trouble is caused by
the determination of the Government to
put down the disgusting practice of "pot
laches." Theso potlach gatherings of tha
Indian? are held in winter after their re
turn from sealing and fishing and are rel
ics of old barbarian rites that the authori
ties had not interfered with until strongly
urged to do so by the missionaries.
At these feasts the young braves torture
themselves in various ways, and one fea
ture is the tearing up of a live dog with,
their teeth and devouring the reeking
flesh.
The Cape Mudee Indians refused to de
sist and Chief Moon recently issued in
vitations for a big potlach.
Constable Hanson of Cortez Island last
Tuesday arrested Chief Moon and his son,
and the tribesmen, wildly excited, flociced
down to the landing-place as the prison
ers were being taken away and rescued
the chief, the constable, with the assist
ance of some determined white men, man
aging to hustle the son on to a boat and
carry him away.
The Indians, furious at this interference
with their orgies, called a gathering of the
tribe and medicine men, and, though
some older heads counseled peace, the
younger bloods have spread the news
abroad among the coast tribes and they
are flocking to Cape Mudgo armed, deter
mined to hold a potlach in spite of every
thing.
White settlers on the coast near that
part are few, and grave fears are enter
tained that, once maddened with whisky,
whicn is smuggled in to them in spite of
the efforts to stamp out the traffic, the
Indians will break loose from all control
and a massacre of the whites result.
All warships are at present away from
Victoria, but there is a company of regu
lars at the fort and enough militia here
and in Vancouver to send to the scene if
the situation keeps a3 threatening as at
present. The flagship Imperieuse is to
ward the north of Vancouver Island now
and can be summoned in short order.
However, the provincial police force un
der Superintendent Hussey is very effi
cient and it is likely that a number oi
them well armed will be dispatched to
Cape Mudge as a first precaution before
the soldiers are called out.
It is not many years since a strong force
had to be sent to Skeena to auell a native
uprising there and since then the Indians
have been overawed and no trouble has
occurred until the present.
VALLEJO MINISTER'S MISSION.
Will Interview Roe, the Condemned Mur
derer, end Endeavor to Obtain
Material for a Sermon.
VALLEJO, Cal., Jan. 10. -Rev. W. L.
Gaston, pastor of the Cornell Baptist
Church, will visit the jail at Nana to-mor
row for the purpose of having a conversa
tion with the condemned murderer Row*,
who is to hang Friday next.
The pastor desire 3to obtain data for a
sermon to be delivered in his church at
this place next Sunday night.
Among the questions to be propounded
to the condemned man are: To what does
he attribute his downfall ; what drink had
to do with it; and whether he desires to
make any statement or leave any mes
sages behind?
Sheriff McKenzie, who has given per
mission to the pastor to interview the
man, has warned him not to disclose his
profession prior to the queries being pro
pounded, otherwise, like all others who
have endeavored to hold religious con
verse with him, he will meet with a cold
rebuff, as Rowe does not seem to care for
the company of any spiritual advisers.
It is now claimed that Rowe is one of
the two inhuman monsters that carried a
young girl into tbe brush near Winters a
few years ago, and after a brutal assault
left her bound hand and foot to die.

politics, is making his fight as the anti
church candidate and has a strong follow
ing, which has been augmented by the
virtual withdrawal of Judge Powers from
the contest and the issuance of an address
by Powers urging his supporters to vote
for Thatcher.
Rawlins is a leading lawyer, very popu
lar ana did veteran service in obtaining
Statehood for Utah. He is considered the
Btrougest in the race.
Henderson, although a Gentile, is re
ceiving some suiiport from the Mormon
church, but his advocacy of silver is not
strong enough to suit the views of the
people here, which will probably prove
fatal to his chances.
The feeling between the Thatcher and
the Rawlins factions is bitter, and if
neither has strength enough to be elected
Powers may come in as a compromise
candidate or it may go to a dark horse, of
whom there are several, notably Truman
and Harris.
THE IDAHO SESATORSHIB.
Uubois Men Expect to Win -dfler the
Tirat Few Bnllot*.
BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 10.â The first ballot
for United States Senator will be taken in
the Idaho Legislature on Tuesday, and
unless ail indications fail, it will result in
no choice.
A careiul canvass of the members indi
cates that eighteen Democrats will vole
for various Populists, sixteen of the twen
ty-three Populists will vote for Claggett,
and four for Angell. The twenty-eight
silver Republicans will go solidly for Da
bois and tbo one McKinley Republican
will vote for some gold man, but in case
his vote is necessary to defeat a Populist
he will throw it to Dubois.
After the first few ballots the Dubois
men expect enough Democrats to come
over to their side to give their candidate
the necessary thirty-six votes. On the
second ballot Johnson (D.) expects to re
ceive the full Democratic vote of eighteen
and some Populists.
The Populists have decided not to go
into caucus until after the first ballot is
taken, and then their efforts will be
directed to finding a candidate who will
unite the Democratic and Populist vote.

DEAD IN THE SLOUGH.
A Colusa County Rancher Wandered Away
from Home White Insana and
Was Drowned.
COLUSA, Cal., Jan. 10.â E. M. Houx,
the Colusa County rancher who, it will
be remembered, was taken to an asylum at
Livermore two months ago to be treated for
a nervous malady, and who escaped about
two weeks ago, was recaptured at Suisun
and taken home, was found dead this
afternoon in a slough near bis home, a few
miles west of Maxwell.
He was in Colusa the past week and was
detained by the officer* until a regular
keeper from the Livermore institution was
sent for to take care of him. He feared
being sent to an asylum and eluded his
attendant.
He was missing for two days when he
returned to the Colusa Hotel at night for
something to eat and was captured. His
hair and coat were covered with straw,
which showed that he had probably been
hiding in a barn near by.
His wife took him back to their home
where, still in charge of the keeper, he
seemed more contented and was doing
very well until last nieht. Then the old
tear of being returned to an asylum
possessed him and he again slipped away.
A search was begun and continued all
night. It was not until aoout 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon that his body was found
face downward in a slough.
It is thought that in attempting to cross
it he mired and was unable to get out.
The water was only about two feet deep
where he was found.

and Is Arrested at Greenwood
for Grand Larceny.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 10.â Last week
a man named Thomas Hudson, who has
been staying at a local lodging-house with
his wife, secured a horse from Samuel
Anderson of this city on the pretext that
he wanted to carry a load of potatoes to
Jamestown.
From E. Ball, who lives in the out
skirts of Stockton, he obtained a rig
and harness, saying that he intended to
peddle onions in the mountain towns and
would purchase the borrowed articles on
his return if they suited him.
That night Hudson ana his wife re
moved their belongings secretly from the
lodging-house in which they had been liv
ing and started for Greenwood, in Placer
County, wnere relatives of Mr*. Hudson
are said to live.
Anderson became suspicoius of Hudson
after hiring the horse to him, and learned
that he had not gone to Jamestown. The
matter was reported to Sheriff Cunning
ham, and a warrant was issued for Hud
son's arrest on a charge of errand larceny.
To-day he was> arrested at Greenwood by
a depnty sheriff of Placer County, and he
will be brought here to-morrow for trial.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 1897.
STOW LAKE IS
NOW A BIG HOLE
The Water Was Emptied
Into the Sand Last
Week.
Seventy-Five Men Engaged in
Cleaning the Bottom of
Debris and Weeds.
Large Quantities of Trout Found in
the Saallow Pools and Tern*
porarily Preserved.
________
The crowds that went to Stow Lake in
Golden Gate Park yesterday were aston
ished to find the lake gone. All they saw
was the hole. No tish, no boats, no water
in evidence, but instead a great deal of
ooze and water weeds and disgruntled
duck? and swans. The hole was not much
to look at. still it seemed to afford consid
erable amusement and wa3 the cause of
much curiosity.
All through the past week the park had
received a little "syphon" in its sand, and
that effected the surprising change yester
day.
It was a big undertaking that Superin
tendent McLaren laced a weeu ago to-day
when he put his men at work on the lake.
The supply of water running into the res
ervoir was shut off, and then three exhaust
pipes, each having a diameter of ei-ht
inches, were opened. Their discharge of
â water from the lake was subdivided and
distributed over the sandy hollow west of
Strawberry Hill. The water rushed through
with great force, but owing to its distribu
tion it scattered harmlessly over the sand.
To assist these pipes in emptying the
large body of water whiob has formed the
beautiful lake oncirc. ing Strawberry Hill
two treat syphons were introduced whers
they discharged one into the valley known
as the '49 camp and another one on (he
north side. The current from the syphons
tore up a deep rut of 100 feet lone in the
fine sand, but at no time dii a pool form ;
the water sank almost instantly, as if the
ground were a sponge with an insatiable
thirst.
Day and night for a week these pipes
discharged and lowered the level of the
lake. By Friday at noon only a little
water was left, and that in the lower level
0:1 the east side, which is a foot deeper
than at the other end.
On the dry portion several men were
started with scrapers and shovels. It was
their duty to scrape and gather the mud
and weeds. Saturday saw seventy- live
workmen in the bed of the lake. They
worked in groups, and as fast as t-he solt
slusu that discolored the water could be
gathered it was hauled away in wagons.
The bottom of the lake was lound to be
hard and solid as the day it w-as laid, and
carts Passed over it without cutting the
beaten ciay. This was an agreeable sur
prise for the superintendent, for the lake
is perhaps the first one successfully con
structed on "made" ground. Another
week will be given to cleaning it and then
the water will be pumped in till the lake
is full again.
When the water was very shallow in the
lowest spot a remarkable quantity of trout
was found there. The fish were from ail
sizes from "that length" down to little
bait, and there was more of them than
water to swim in. With a large net the
speckled trout were raised and moved to
the pool at the base of the waterfall.
There they will remain until the lake is
full, Out they are having a rather con
strained time of it with barely elbow
room for their fins. They all appeared to
be healthy and to have done well in their
artificial home.
It will take at least from seven to ten
days to fill the lake and about February
1 newly varnished and painted boats will
be ready to sail over its placid face and
the rebellious fowls can have their cus
tomary aquatic srort.
A SERMON ON SOCIALISM
Rev. A. J. Wells Begins a Series
of Unconventional Ad
dresses.
" Civilization May Hive to Contend for
Its Life With the Forces It
Hs Evolved"
The Rev. A. J. Wells, pastor of the
Second Unitarian Church, Twentieth and
Capp streets, preached an interesting and
altogether unconventional serrron last
night on "Socialism," the first one of a
series on the industrial situation. In the
course of his remarko he said :
"We have entered upon a new era in the
history of the world. For 2500 years the
eh;e. interest to the student of history has
been the struggle of the democratic idea.
Privileged classes, imperialism, the divine
right of kings has gone down. The dem
ocritic idea has emerged, but now that
the people have political freedom, what
will they do with it? Have the principles
of popular government been carried to
their logical conclusion? Socialist's say
no. We have political democracy and
religious democracy. The next step is
industrial democracy, and that is Social
ism. The social question is, and is to be,
the Question of our time.
"What produces the dissatisfaction with
the existing social order? It is first a re
action against individualism. The daily
press often classes socialists and anarch
ists together. Tbey are not alike. They
represent the extremes of social thought.
Anarchism is the abolition of all govern
ment, socialism is the doctrine that gov
ernment should control everything for
the common good; second, socialism is an
outgrowth produced by the contrasts ot
society. Wealth has never been so- dif
fused, the comforts of wealth nev6r so
general, wages never so good, yet the con
trasts were never so great. Our greatest
peril is the concentration of wealth, our
greatest need an equitable distribution of
wealth. Political economists say that the
benefits of the present civilization are not
impartially distributed, and it is not
strange that workingmen should agree
and be restiess. Then, again, the situa
tion is complicated by invention. Ma
chinery tends to heighten differences of
condition, to establish social classes and
to erect barriers between them.
"It does this by separating the employer
and employed. It does this by maK
nig the workingman himself a ma
chine. Statistics show that the man
ufacturing departments of our pop
ulation are inferior to the agri
cultural departments, the monotony of
much factory work tending to injure the
manhood oi the wageworker. The drift
of thing* makes operatives into an hered
itary class. Wife and children are often
compelled to assist in the struggle for
bread. The hard struggle perpetuates ig
norance, develops intemperate habits and
debases manhood. Children born of such
parents are feeble and repeat the history
of ihe peneration from which they sprang.
rierÂ« are ihe roots of socialism.
"The same law which tends to make a
hereditary class of operatives tends also
to create a class of capitalists and monop
olists. Then combination enables this
class to command the trade, and produc
tion is stopped long enough to advance
prices. Boaidi of trade make and un
make the prices of food. Students of so
ciology know that the death rate rises and
falls with the prices of food, but combina
tions can determine for a time the prices
of the very necessaries of life.
"When civilization thus tends to injure
multitudes by the very conditions of its
advance, dwarfing manhood by the tri
umph of inventive genius, when it tends
to develop despotic power, oppressive and
exasperating, it may fairly be questioned
whether such civilization produces right
and wise economic conditions.
"The time may come when modern civ
ilization will have to contend for its life
with the forces it nas evolved. In that
day will popular government be our
safety? No! Because ot our free institu
tions the battle will be first fought out
here.
"What is tho path to a more harmonious
social state? There is no answer that can
be put into a sentence; there is no easy
road to the world's social paradise. In re
ligion the notion of a church kingdomâ a
kingdom of the saintsâ must give way to
the kingdom of humanity. In trade the
practical maxims involved in the competi
tive civilization are self-defeating; they
cannot be applied to private business or
public policies without endangering the
stability* of society. 'What 13 not good for
the bee'is bad for the hive.' "

HIGHER WHEAT
HELPS PRODUCERS
Flour Goes Up and Bakers
Raise the Price
of Bread.
Restaurants Get Smaller Loaves
and They Make Com
plaint.
The recent great demand for California
wheat has caused a noticeable stimula
tion in tbe price of the product and all
things made therefrom.
Within tbe past month it has become
generally known that there are not to ex
ceed 4C0.000 tons of wheat in this State.
As a result the price has taken a great
jump in milling anu shipping grades.
Flour, feeling the stimulus, has gone
from J3 35 to $4 80. These figures are
for the ordinary grades, used by local
bakers. The quality that wu? bought for
low figures a few months a<jo is now
$1 15 higher per barrel, but the total raise
sii.ce the wheat first advanced has been
$1 55.
The immediate effect of tbe increased
price oi flour on local bakers has been to
cause a diminution of the loaves, likewise
in the size of roils, doughnuts and other
article-* rated under the designation of
bread stuffs.
Local restaurant proprietors complain
that they are getting decidedly the worst
of the new rates.
"We pay the same price for much
smaller loaves now," said a prominent
restaurateur; "so you see that the baker
eets the same prices for smaller measure*.
Tue German rolls we buy now Hre only
about half the size they were. We get a
funny assortment of doughnuts nowa
days. They give us a range of sizes in each
dozen, scaling them down. On each loaf
of bread they cut off from two to four
ouncs, and that m ans two oi three good
slices. This forces us to buy more bread,
because we cannot cut our customers short
or charge them more for their orders."
The proprietor of the Prost bakery, 328
Third street, was seen relative to the in
creased prices last nisjht. He said:
'â¢It is true that flour has gone up about
$1 55 â  barrel and we have been compelled
to make loaves two ounces smaller. If
the thing continues we will have to cut it
down two ounces more. The advance in
the price of flour has of course given the
producer more. Farmers get more for
their wheat, millers charge more for their
flour and we have to go to higher prices
for our bread."
Bakers met in mass-meeting at the
Turk-street Temple yesterday afternoon
to consider problems connected with their
business. Those assembled were chiefly
members of Unions Nos. 24 and 42. They
had expected a promised report from In
spector Cameron on the coudition of
bakeries.
As he was not there they made loud
complaint. He was particularly criticized
by William Postler, who 'said that be be
lieved it to be the duty of a public official
to serve those who got him appointed to a
position, especially as that official had
promised to come and make a report.
Resolutions were passed favoring the
bill now pending in the Lesislature to
compel bakers to keep their establish
ments clean, and for che protection of
employes trom employers who desire
them to work more than ten hours a day.
Speeches on these subjects were made
by Messrs. Rough, Seiler, Posiler, Ross
berg, Lynch and Warnecke, and it was re
solyed to do all possible to have the sani
tary measure become a law.
EPIPHANY SERMON. ~
Rev. Or. Spairiing Preaches on the
Psalmist'g Words.
Dr. Spalding of St. John's Episcopal
Church took for his text yesterday morn
ing the words of the psalmist, "The
heavens declare the glory of God and the
firmament showeth His handiwork. Day
unto day uttereth speech and niehtunto
night sheweth knowledge. There is no
speech nor language where their voice is
not heard."
This being Epiphany season, he preached
on the manifestation of Christ.
"We of to-day (like the heathens)
want a God whom we can see, and not a
phantom God. If we only look for him
we will see that he is revealed to us not
only in his Holy Word, but in all the
world of nature about us, in every leaf, in
every flower, stream, hill and mountain.
We have come to understand the laws and
working* of nature so well that many of
us have eliminated God altogether, and
forget that it is his almighty power that
is over it all. Children understand the
voiced of nature far better than they do
after their hearts become corrupted, and
often when one puts away childish things
he puts away that which is necessary to
enter the kingdom of heaven.
11 Christ took many of his teachings
from nature. David refers to it all
through his beautiful psalms. In nature
everything has its place and its work to
do. Let each of us remember this in our
daily duties, and do each of them to the
glory of God."
HE HAD A GAY TIME.
The Missing Clerk of William Price &
Co., Front Street, Arrested for
G:and Larceny.
Peter Borstorj, the clerk for William
Price & Co., 327 Front street, who disap
peared with money and checks belon ing
to the firm on January 4, was arrested Sat
urday night by Detective Ross Whitaker
and Policeman Fitzgerald and booked at
the City Prison yesterday ou a charge of
grand larceny.
BiTston is 19 years of age and had been
intrusted with the duty of depositing
money in the bank. January 4he got $290
in coin and three checks to deposit. O:iÂ«
of the checks was on the Anglo-California
Bank for $57, one on the Tallant Banking
Company for $145 and the third on the
Firs;. National iJauk for $91. He /ailed to
make the deposit and the case was reported
to the police.
Whitaker and Fitzgerald were detailed
to find him, and Saturday night they ar
rested him in a room at 201 Powell street.
The three checks were found upon him,
but he had recklessly squandered the $290.
He bought a gold watch for $35 and after
ward pawned it. When arrested tie was
dressed us a soldier. He met two soldiers
while he was spending the money, and got
one of them to exchange clothes with him
so that he could disguise himself.
Borston is the same boy who tried to
commit suicide on the steamer Walla
Walla about two months ago.
MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI.
Rev. William Ruder Says the I>eca
logun Was Not Miraculously In
spired.
Last night the Rev. William Rader, pas
tor of the Third Congregational Church,
preached the fourth of his series of special
sermons on the Bible. He stated that
these addresses would be studies of the
Bible in the light of the new knowledges.
The speaker paid a glowing tribute to
Moses. "The name of Moses marks the
close of an ane of mystery and the begin
ning of an age of law," tin said. "His i-*
the greaiest name of the ancient world."
The chiel events in the life of the great
law-giver were gone over, and then com
in,- to his main subject the pastor ex
plained his position as to the Decalogue to
be that while it possibly was of miracu
lous delivery he did not believe it was.
"The origin of the Commandments ia
slirouded in mystery," he continued.
'The picture of Muses on the mountain is
probably the grandest portrait in history.
Here is a man who has rocked the throne
of tne Pnaroahs standing on the summit
of a mountain framed in sullen thunder,
clothed in a garment of tire, having in
his hands the tablets of the law, the first
picture of an ideal man that has ben
caught with the camera of human
thought."

"WHY I AM A SOCIALIST"
Two Testimonies Last Night by
Rev. Mr. Bliss and Mr.
Wi'kins
The Serialization of Capital Must
Accompany tbe Socialization
of Land.
The principal speakers at last night's
meeting of the Socialist Labor party in
Pythian Castle Hall were the Rev. W. D.
P. Bliss and M. W. Wilkins, the editor of
"The New Charter," a party organ.
Mr. Wilkins described the process of
his conversion from populism to social
ism. He spoke of the former as in reality
a movement of tbe small capitalists and
proprietors, whose fervent prayer was
"God make me a millionaire." The cry of
free silver was designed to distract atten
tion from tbe true issues and to promote
dissension in the ranks of the proletariat.
The same cry, he assured his hearers,
would be raised inl9oo. The duty or all
true socialists, therefore, was to ignore it
and persistently proceed toward the estab
lishment of the co-operative common
wealth.
Mr. Bliss, following in some sort the ex
ample of Mr. Wilkins, also informed his
auditory of the causes which led to his ac
ceptance of socialistic theories.
As a young clergyman of a small parish
of Massachusetts he was at one time
firmly convinced that poverty was duo to
intemperance until lie had o casion to ob
serve that many temperate people were as
poor as, or poorer than many who were
drunkard?. The nationalization of tbe
liquor traffic, Mr. Bliss believed, would
tend to abolish intemperance by elimin
ating the element of profit which now en
courages thÂ« extension of that traffic. An
other factor in his conversion was Henry
George's "Progress and Poverty," But
Mr." Bliss discovered that God did notonly
teach the socialization of the land, but
tbe social zation of capital, without
which t.ie first could not effect any
permanent amelioration.
"Socialism." said Mr. Bliss, "is the op
posite of anarchism. It means tbe exten
sion of fraternal law and order and would
attain the co-operative common wealth by
the legal and political capture of present
institutions and their gradual evolut.on
into that co- >perative commonwealth.
The motto of anarchism, on the contrary,
is: l li you see a head, hit it.' Pnysical
force may destroy the kiner, but it will not
destroy the kingship. We must kill the
conditions which produce the plutocrat.
I sometimes think that if we mudt have a
sovereign I would rattier have one like the
gracious Queen of Great Britain tlian some
oi the hog kings of Chicago."
Mr. Buss urged, furthermore, that so
cialists should sound the note of frater
naiism rather than thai oi denunciation
and hatred. Question and general discus
sion closed the meeting.

held by the Redemptorists, Rev. Father
Weber and Rev. Father O'Shea, began
yesterday morning with special masses at

mays at 10:30.
The sermon was preached by Rev.
Father Weber from the work of the magi,
or wise men of the Eust, who saw the star
and spread the news of the coming of the

The services have been very successful
and the large new church has at all times

Tom Kelly hit to Van Norden and was
thrown out, ending the run-getiing. The
A hletics came to bat, but they could only
bunt the speeay ball, going out in one*
two-three oraer.
In the second inning the Violets scored
two more runs, giving them a lead of fiva
runs, but th:s was reduced in the
next inning. Sheoban was g.ven a Das*
on balls; Speilnian followed w.tli a fly to
mht tieid and gaineu first on errors,

thr- wjo Kennedy, forcing Van Nordsn
out, Kennedy throwing to first in time to
retire Gianni. Ford hit to third, but was
thrown out at first. This ended the ru:i
making of the athletic club, ns they did
not score after that. In the sixth thÂ«
Violets scored again, leaving tiie score 6
to 3.
ODea was ruled out of the game by
Umpire McDonald in the third inning for
interfering with Pueiffer.who was running
to third. Sheehan is charged with four
errors, but is only guilty of two, as tne
ground around tnird was in poor condi
tion/causing the ball to swerve.
Raymond pitched a tine game, but was
poorly supported.
Nex Sunday the Violets will play the
Santa Clara team, the proceeds to goto
charity.

OF CALIFORNIA
In general orders recently issuod from
the office of Adjutant-General Barrett it
appears that the organized strengtn of
t lie National Guard of California on the
Ist of October was as follows: Com
mander in Chief and staff, 25; division
staff, 17; three brizades and staff-, 57;
three signal corps KJ: four troops of cav
alry, 250; Naval B.ittalion approximately
(First Division not rpported at that date),
388; First Infantry, 952; Second Inlantry,
557; Fifth Infantry, 555; Sixth Infantry,
5Â»1; Seventh Infantry, 775; total, 4173.
Cadet Company, First Infantry, 52.
It having become officially known at
the office of the adjutant-general that
Captain F. EL Teale, commanding Com
pany C, Seventh Infantry, First Brigade,
has removed from the limits of his bri
gade and has absented himself therefrom
lor more than thirty days without per
mission he is deemed to have resigned
and his resignation is announced.
Captain John F. Connolly, First Lieu
tenant Thomas W. Sparrowe and Lieuten
ant Charles C. Hogan have been detailed
to serve as the regimental examining
board of the First Regiment Infantry,
Second Brigade, to serve until July 1,
current year.
There was a meeting of the officers of
the Second Brigade on last Friday night,
at which there were present iorty, who
were presided over by Brigadier-General
Warfield.
Thu brigadier-general took occasion to
make a declaration that a story published
in the iake journal to the effect mat he
intended to co beiore the Senate at Sacra
mento and prevent the confirmation of
Division - Commander N. T. James as
msjor-general was untrue, and that lie
was not trying to or had even thought of j
suggesting that the Senate do not confirm i
tlie nomination.
Daring the evening a great many mat
ters pertaining to the nvnch-talked-of pro-:
posed amendments to the existing laws
effecting the National Guard, including
those that have been suggested by the
Code Commissioners, were discussed, and
the fact that the Commissioners without
consulting with the workers in the guard
should mate a number of amendments
was somewhat severely commented on.
A res-tilt 01 the conference v.as that it
was deeded to instruct the legislative
committee, consisting of Colonel Macdon
ald, Colonel Fairbanks, Major Tilden and
Lieutenant Hel.er from the Second Brig
ade, to impress on the minds of the legis
la.ors that there is no change desired in
the organization of the guard as it now
stands and that it having been so recently
reorganized it ought to have a chance
to determine if the present system is for
the best interest of the guard and the
State or not.
Britadier-General Warfieid, comment
ing on the proposed legislation, said that
it was all nonsense to talk at this time
about the reorganization of the National
Guard. "Why," said he, "the men have
hardly realized the fact, that mere lias
been a reorganization and are not yet
familiar witn the new order of things
when up comes some who want to re
organize anew. I say give the men a
chance to see how the new arrangement
works. There is such a thing as too
much legislation, and they may go on and
amend and chance ana reorganize and
what will the re.su it be? I'll tell you â it
will be that the men will become dis
gusted and quit.
â¢ Then there will be no National Guard.
I* will be all legislated out of existence.
We are like the Southern Confederacy was
onceâ we want to be let alone. If the
legislator^ are very anxious to do some
thing for the guard let them provide
clothing, blankets, canteens, and urge
upon the United States Gove.-nment to
arm the troop with the Springfield mus
kets that have been discarded lor the
Kra<. r -Jorgensens. That is what we want,
something that wiH put the National
Guard on the footing that ought it to be
on."
A meeting of the National Guard Offi
cers' Association was calied for last Mon
day night lor the purpose ol discussing
matters that are of importance to the
guard, but only three ot the members re
uponded. If the officers who have the
welfare of the guard at heart cannot de
vote a few hours to discuss matters of
importance, it is no wonder that there
is growling all the time that the t-uard is i
not treated as it should be. The officers j
who can prevent such growling are the
ones who fail to give the necessary atten
tion to important matters.
During the past week the several local
companies held tneir hrst meeting atter
the December vacation. These mee:ings
were principally devoted to business, and
the drills will be resumed this week.
"They talk about reorganizing the
guard, ' said a private of the Second
Brigade, on Saturday. "They had better
let that alone fora wh.le, and pay some
attention to putting the existins companies
in this brigade at least in proper shape
and give them all that the law and the
regulations say they are entitled to. In
conversation with a member of tue signal
corps a day or two ago, he told me that
vnnre than a year ago bis company made a
requisition for forty bailers lor the horses,
but to use his own woids, 'they haven't
yet arriv'; and not havii g any halters
they are without link straps, winch are in
use to link four horses together when, in
the drill, the order to dismount iÂ« given
mid No. 4 has to mind his own and three
horses. As necessity is the mother of
invention, when that order is given now,
Nn. 4 has to grab the four sets of rein-] !
and it makes a very unhandy handful and i
it prevents him from handling the horses j
as he could if Lnk-straps were used. Tins !
tignalman toid me that for want of halters
they have to curry hayropes to f;isten their
horses, and if they dave none of these
they have to take off their shoe l.icets- to
use for hitching lines. There is also a
regulation that requires the members of
the corps tn be provided with coils of rope,
to enable them to stake tneir horses when
out on bivouac, but they have not got
them. The same neglect to provide what
ought to be provided runs along the entire
,iae of the brigade, and yet when an
inspection is held there is bat little dis
covered as to tha real needs of the guard."
It is underÂ«tood that there will shortly
be an investigation in relation to the affairs
of Captain Jenk's cavalry company, in
order to arrive at nil the facts of the debt
which this company has been carrying for
so long. *
Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph G. Geistine,
assistant adjutant-general of the Second
Brigade, has gone Eist for a few weeks.
Surgeon-General W. E. Hopkins ana F.
fie L. Carnugton, captain First Infantry,
U. S. A., specially detailed by the War
Department with the National Guard, are
no longer friendly, as far as National
Guard affairs go.. The cantain in his report
to Adjutant-General Barrett presented a
plan of reorganization of the guard which
has been pretty strongly commented upon
by many military men in and out of the
guard. Now comes the surgeon-general,
who in his reports to the adjutant-general
says: "I am much opposed to the regi
mental organization suggested by Captain
Carrington in his recent report. I resent
the fact that my old friend and comrade
in arms should have deemed it his duty to
make such an important and unqualified
statement without preliminary consulta
tion with me." Of course this refers to the
part of Captain Carrington's report in
which he says: "The medical department
(of the National Guard) needs reorganiza
tion, and proper legislation looking to it
should be invited at the earliest mo
ment. For State troops I think it is prob
ably better to maintain a regimental than
a general medical department."
ThÂ» Woodland Company.
WOODLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â The first
drUl of the year took place last Wednes
day eveniuz. About forty men were in
attendance. Close and extended order
diill were gone through in a very cred
itable manner, which goes to show that
the boys have not grown rusty during the
month's lay off. Everything in and
about thÂ« armory is in good shape. The
only thing lacking is a flag to run up on
the new pole. What the company needs
most is a suitable place for 300 and
500 yard ranges. The only place
available is in the tule land about four
miles east of town, and that is covered
with water at the present time. So we
don't know exactly what to do. The foot
ball team of the compiny played its first
game Christmas day with an aggregation
of Berkeley students ami was beaten to
the tune of 14 to 0. The boys are not dis
couraged though and are ready to nego
tiate for a game with a team from some
one of the ot er companies.
The company is going to give a grand
annual bail some time in February and
wants soldiers from everywhere to at
tend, be they militiamen or regulars.
Two new members v.ere admitted to the
company at the last meeting and several
applications are on the board ready to bj
acted on at the next meeting.
News From thu Seventh.
SANTA ANA, Cal , Jan. 9.â Wednesday
evening wat an eventful occasion with
Company L of the Seventh Keeiment,
N. G. C, of this city, the seventh anni
versary of the organization of the corn-
r>any being celebrated on that date with a
public drill and company banquet. The
armory parlors and Spurgeon's Hall,
which is immediately adjoining and used
! as a drillroom, were thrown open to the
200 invited guests- who assembled to enjoy
an evening with the soldiei-boys.
The company drill, which occupied
about an hour and a half, was a splendid
exhibition of military discipline and was
flatteringly received by tlie largo audience.
Captain Kin ley's command never ap
i peared to better advantage than on this
â  enjoyable birthday occasion.
Following the regular company manual
drill came a competitive drill In the school
of the soldier, in wliicn eight men par
| ticipated, Corporal John Abbey being
awarded the medal for the best drilled
soldier of the squad.
The visitors then spread through the
spacious anu comfortable quarters of the
company, becoming acquainted with the
commanding officer oi the regiment,
i Colonel John R. Berry, and Lieutenant-
I Colonel Shreiber, wlio were the visitors of
honor, and all being well entertained by
the contact with the local State soldiers.
At 10 o'clock the company marched to
the Hotel Brunswick, where, with a few
press representatives and ex-members ot
distinction, a splend d banquet was en
joyed, followed by hippy after-Gin tier
talks, which lasted far into the night. Cap
tain 8. H. Finley acted as toastmaster,
and responses were made by Colonel
Berry, Lieutenant-Colonel Schreiber. ex-
Major C. S. McKelvey. Major H. T. Mat
thews, ex-Captain Parke 8. Roper, Sur
geon C. D. Ball, ex-Color Sergeant E. S.
Wallace of the press corner, ex- Lieutenant
W. W, Burgher and Corporal C. W. Han
nab.
Following these speeches, which were
all of a pleasurable and soldierly vein,
Corporal Dresser arose and in a few well
chosen remarks presented Captain Finley
with a handsome chain and charm as a
token of the esteem in which he was held
by the company and its high appreciation
of bis efforts for ttie past two years as
commanding officer. The captain was
surprised and nonplused for a moment
at this turn of affairs, but soon recovered
himself and accepted the gift in a grace
ful speech.
The even ing was a great success through
out, and the seventh anniversary of Com
pany L will long be cherished in the
memory of those present. Colonel Berry
paid the boys many flattering tribute- 1 ,
particularly commending the company
lor its splendid snowing at the late emer
gency call, when sixty-two of its sixty
four members responded, the two absent
ones being out of town. The company
now numbers over seventy, but there are
only five men in its ranks of the original
Company F of the Ninth Regiment, which
was mustered in seven years a^o.
The rooms which have so long been
used as the armory and general quarters
are soon to be abandoned, the company
having leased a two-siory brick building
on West Fourth street, which will be
thoroughly litted up for those purposes.
The OldeHt National Guardsman.
In The Call yesterday was an account of
the military career of Sergeant C. 11. Kills of
Company A, Fifth Infantry Regiment of Cali
fornia, located at Oakland. It stated that
Sergeant Ellis has been an" active member of
the guard for thirty-six .years, having gone
into service in 1861. It was stated that ho
had done active service longer than any one
in the State- militia. To this Corporal Lou
Townsend of Company B, City Guard. First
Infanty Regiment, takes exceptions. Corporal
Townsend states that he and not Ellis has
done the longer service. He has been forty
three years continuously in the National
Guard, having enlisted in 1854. Corporal
'Jownsend is still greatly interested in rifle
practice and he holds a remarkably steady
gun. *

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 1897.
ARMY AND NAVY
OFFICERS PLEASED
Now There Is Talk of Send
ing a Football Team
North.
0 ficers and Privates May Con
test With Players at Van
couver Barracks.
Aa Effort to Ba Made to Bui!d Up
a Strong Eleven for Next
Season-
There is happiness in army and navy
circles over the victory of their football
players in Saturday's society game with
the University Club team. It is likely
that as a result of the match football will
become a regular annual pastime with the
young oflicers stationed here, as It has
long been with the undergraduates at the
universities. And next season a team
may go north.
The spirit has been aroused all right,
and the only obstacle will be the uncer
tainty and the paucity of good material
from which to build a team each year.
The location of naval officers is so unre
liable; the good football players among
them may be in port one day and ordered
to sea with their ship the nÂ«Â»xr. The pos
sibilities among the army officers are more
stable. The different posts about San
Francisco will have to furnish material
that may generally be counted on to be
here on the day of a game.
"There are probably about seventy-five
commisb'.oned officers from which to
choose an eleven," said Lieutenant Nolan
yesterday at the Presidio. "Toe Univer
sity Club team may be picked from hun
dreds of men, ail of whom have played
the game. Only a few of the officers have
played. We had but two extra men in
case of accident to our team yesterday.
"This Army and Navy team is, i be
lieve, the first combination of the Kind
that has ever been known in Ihe Uniie-1
States service. Those of us that had played
before had always met on the field as
rivals, representing West Point and An
j napolis.' It was a novel thing for us all
j to be on one team, and it proved a pleas
ant experience. Then, after the game we
wer' 1 ail dined at the Unfversity Club.
"The greatest encouragement is being
given to athletics in the army now. It
has been found to improve the enlisted
men and keep them out of dissipation by
Lieutenant King of the Seventh
Cavalry, the Fullback Who
Gained 603 Yards for the Army
and Navy Team in the Recent
Society Game*
demonstrating to them how much better
they feel for being in good athletic condi
tion.
"One thing we hope to have next year
is a strong football team made up of the
enlisted men. There is already some talk
of arranging a series of games between the
represeniatives i f the army here and those
in the Depurtnient of the Columbia. The
Vancouver barracks have had a good team
lor several year.". The officers play on the
team with the enlisted men up there. It
would probably be the same way here.
"One of the games would likeiy be played
here and one in Portland, while if a third
were necessary to decide the winner a
place could be decided upon for the final
game. We would like to wort this thing
up. The only objections would be the
difficulty probably of obtaining the con
sent of the commanders to a trip."
Lieutenant King, who was the star of
the game on Saturday, came here from
Fort Grant, Arizona, on a short leave of
absence, granted especially that he might
take part in the football match. He will
!eavÂ« the Presidio to-day for his station.
After Lieutenant Nolan, captain of the
Army and Navy team, had very liberally
permitted tlie introduction into the Uni
versity Club team of university veterans
that were not mernbeis of the club he then
arranged for Lieutenant King to come up
from Arizona. The original challenge
had, however, been from the' University
for a game between its members and the
officers of the army and navy stationed
here.
King was graduated from West Point
only last summer. He was then assigned
to the Seventh Cavalry stationed at pres
ent at Fort Grant in Ar.zotu. He is a
native of Massachusetts and was a mem
b?r of the West Point team during his
whole four years at the academy. He
captaine 1 the team the last two years.
His record as a kicker in the Army and
Navy and University Club match has
probably never been equaled in a game on
this const. He punted thirteen times for
a total gain of 524 yards or an average of
a littl over forty yards for each kick. He
was given the ball nineteen times and
gained a total of seventy-nine yards by
runs. Only once did he fail to gain and
that time lie was tackled behind the line
for a loss ol three yards.

The great ICO-man military rifb match
between teams from the First Regiment
N. Q. U. and the Hawaiian National Guard
took place yesterday â at least one-half of
it took place. The members of the Cali
fornia team assembled in full force at the
Shell Mound rifle range yesterday and it
is expected that the Hawaiians also gath
ered at their range near Honolulu. The
&cores made by the two teams will be ex
changed by the earliest steamers. The
conditions were that each team should
consist of 100 men who were to fire ten
shcta each at 200 yards off hand with
military muskets. The losing team is to
present the winners with a trophy valued
at $100.
it is feared that the California team
will have to purchase the trophy for the
islanders, for the men did not shoot in
their usual form on account of the very
cold weather. Besides, some of the best
men in the regiment were by some over
sight or mistake left out of the contest
and the poor shots pulled the average of
39.52. Such marksmen as CF. Waithum
of Company C. A. F. Ramm ot D, C. H.
Otten of I, S. Claussenius of B and H. B.
Taylor of B, all of whom are good for
from 40 to 4(5, failed to shoot in the team.
If the match be lost this misforluro is
responsible for it. As slated, ttie men
liud the elements to contend against, for
a cold, chilling wind that benumbed the
marksmen blew across the range all day
and whipped the buliets right and left,
up and down, all day and mado the men
wish for a" few hours of balmy islr.nd
climate. It would have been hard to
have had the event fall on a worse day.
The local marksmen were under the
direction of Louis Barrere, inspector of
rifle practice, and Major Hugh T. Sime.
Hawaiian Consul Wilder was present on
the range as the official representative of
the Honolulu marksmen. As the men
entered the range they were ob iged to
pass a combined emblem of the two re
publics, and although it was small many
raised their caps. This consisted of two
miniature flags of the United States and
Hawaii. Under these ware the words
"E Piuribus' 1 and "Aloha." A miniature
broom was placed between the two.
Up to noon the shooting was remark
ably poor. A. H. Kennedy got a cup of hot
coffee and broke the ice by going to 44. A
little later Lieutenant Seeley followed
buit, but Chris Meyer forged ahead ot both
with 44 on Creed moor. The latter stood
at the head until late in the day, when A.
E. Ehrenpfort made the top score of 45, as
follows : 455444545 5. The regiment
offered three cash prizes or medals, as the
men desired, to the three making the
highest scores in the team. These were
won by Ehrenpfort, Meyer and Kennedy.

In addition to the prizes offered by the
regiment for the three best scores. Captain
L. Siebe, proprietor of the range, offered
three medals to the marksmen making in
the match the greatest improvement bvc r
their practice scores. It will take several
days to figure out the winners of these
medals.
It is likely that the First Regiment will
have another 100-raan match on its hands,
for the Fifth Regiment men have declared
that they would issue a challenge if the
First men did not average over 42 points
in yesterday's shoot.
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club.
Tne Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club has
arranged one of the finest shooting pro
grammes for the present year ever pre
sented to the public on the Pacific Coast.
It has offered eighteen beauiiful medal?,
which includes eight class medals for
members only. Besides the ten re-entry
all-comers medals, it offers about a dozen
cash prizes ranging from $25 to $5, and
several valuable trophies, to be distributed
at the end of the year.
These are known as consolation prizes,
and those who almost win but fail to
i secure medals will be consoled by other
prizes The re-entry medals have been
donated by F. H. Bushnell, W. Glinde
rnnnn, Achille Roos, F. 0. Youutj, Gordon,
Blanding. Howard Carr and CaDtain L.
Siebe, all members of the club. It is not
the principle of this organization to beg
prizes for its members from the general
public.
So varied is the programme and so valu
able are the inducements that much
shooting is expected this year. The
Columbia Ciub has taken another step
that its members think is in the cause of
advancement. At its last meeting it was
decided to admit ladies into the club upon
an equality with the men and with all toe
rights and privileges that the most favored
of the male sex enjoy. About six or
eight ladies, all of whom are experts with
firearms, who are relatives of the men,
have signified their intention of Joining
itie club and competing with the men in
all of the matches. This is the first rifle
and pistol club in the United States, if
not in the world, which recognized the
equality of women in this manner.
It also added another class (third) to
its membership competition in order to
give the new members and. poorer shots
with pistol anu rifle a chance to progress
without getting discouraged by being out
classed by the more proficient.
The contests in the many matches yes
terday were spirited, and the following
scores were made on the new Columbia
target: *

His Balloon Burst.
Emil Markeburg, the aeronaut, had his third
lucky escape yesterday at the Chutes. This
time he encountered a rotten billoon, but by
quick action and good judgment s-aved his
life. As it was, he might have been dashed to
death against the ground but for the lact that
he struck the scenic railway in falling. When
the balloon whs let go its lower part burst
under his weight, and he saw the only way to
save himself was to cut loose, which he did at
the height of 100 feet, just above the railway.
He received no injuries.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Drop the fake caucus.
Get down to straight business.
Elect a Senator worthy of the office.
Sooner or later ability always arrives.
No one denies the merits of Samuel M.
Shortridge.
What has Senator Perkins ever done in
the Senate?
The office should go to the man who can
fill it worthily.
Merit may be mocked at by those who
lack it, but it wins.
Take the dummy off the track and go
forward to new things.
The Senator from California should be
able to speak for California.
The people of California expect a Sena
tor who will champion all tiie interests of
California.
Senator Perkins has been tried in the
SenatorshiD an d what does the triai bal
ance show?
In the great nrena of Nationii debate
California should have a champion able
to maintain her cause.
There are those who say that for merit
to aspire is ridiculous, but as a rule tney
are ridiculous themselves.
If the attempt oi the Examiner to
"worry" Senator Perkins into "selling a
ship"' is not ridiculous, what is it?
Why did the men who claim to have
been instructed for Per Kins go into a cau
cus to decide for whom they should vote?
Samuel 11. Shortridge is supported for
the Senate upon his merits ana not by
reviling, ridiculing and denouncing his
opponents.
Why does not the Examiner point with
pride to some of its candidate's merits,
achievements or services to the Republi
can party?
A man who has been tried in a particu
lar office and has fallen below the measure
of its auties is certainly not deserving of
re-election.
The fake about the necessity for Purkins
to "meet bribery with bribery" was evi
dently published by the Examiner for its
own benefit.
As the Examiner of yesterday had noth
ing to say about bribery, it is doubtful
whether Perkins has sold his ships or
burned them.
There are two essentials for right service
in high office, one is ability to perform the
work and the other is fidelity to every
duty it imposes.
The advocacy of a blackmailing sheet
may stain the canvass of Senator Perkins,
but that of Mr. Shortridge will remain
clean to the end.
Samuel M. Shortridge has advocated
and worked for the Republican party in
season and out of season and has merited
the honors of the party by arduous ser
vice in its behalf.
Judge Daly declares there can be no can
cus of a less number of persons than are
required to effect the purpose for which
they have gone into caucus. Wbu dis
putes that proposition?
Intelligent Republicans will not miss
tne significance of the fact that the chief
opponent of Mr. Shortridge is a Demo
cratic boodle organ, whose manager is
known as "Long preen."
Hiring a Democratic boodle sheet to as-
Bail tde honesty of Republican members
ol the Legislature may be a good way to
hide the defect of the candidate it advo
cates, but it does not advance his merit.
The Republicans of California should
send to the Senate a man who is capable
of defending in debate the great principles
of protection against the free trade Sena
tor whom the Democrats have sent there.
All forms of political machinery have
their uses, but they should tend to the
election of the man best fitted for the
office to which he aspires. When they
have nny other tendency they become
abuses.
According to friends of Senator Perkins,
the National capital is no place for any
but the rich, and yet every student of our
history knows it has not been millionaires
who have won most distinction there or
rendered most service to the Nation and
tne people.
No man in the State is more intelli
gently devoted to the great mining inter
ests of the country than Samuel M. Short
ridge, and when in the Senate he can be
counted on to promote the cause of the
miners by advocating the appointment of
a Secretary of Mines with a seat in the
Cabinet.
Having been trained in the public
schools of the State and having rendered
service to them as a teacher, no man 'in
California is in closer touch with the great
body of men and women who have been
edcucated in those schools than Samuel M .
Sbortridge. He shares their pride in Cali
fornia as well as their National patriotism,
and in the United States Senate will give
utterance to their sentiments and main
\l'iÂ» their weUare, â¢
ARE RICHES A REQUISITE?
In the letter which Senator Perkins wrote to James A. Waymire after the
treachery of the former to his old friend's earnest and honorable hope of being found
worthy and well supported for a Cabinet position, he expresses a thought which rich
men often hold, but seldom publish. It is the idea of Senator Perkins that a man of
limited means ought not to aspire to a Cabinet position, because the expense of main
taining himself with befitting style in the office would outrun Us salary.
In view of the fact that Mr. Waymire is not rich Mr. Perkins did not take his
aspiration seriously and had the amazing assurance to write and tell him so.
Has it, in fact, come to this pass in our Republic that Cabinet positions are oniy
for the rich and thattne door to such preferment must be opened with a golden key?
Can it be possible that Senator Perkins i 3 ri<*ht in his assertion that merit, however
great, and ability, however marked, must be joined with wealth in order to qualify
their possessor for a Cabinet position?
If Mr. Perkins is correct in his statement, and if poor men may not aspire to the
Cabinet, how changed for the worse is the condition of our country as compared to
those glorious days when Daniel Webster, a poor man, and Henry Clay, a poor man,
were deemed worthy to be the members of Cabinets, and by their surpassing talents
there displayed achieveu for onr Nation the highest honor and for themselves
the most enduring fame.
If Mr. Perkins is right in stating that custom has caused the expense of the office
to exceed its salary, he and the millionaires like him who set the pace of living in
Washington society at such an annual outlay that none but those of their own financial
measure can afford to aspire, to be a Cabinet officer are solely responsible lor such a con
dition. It is to be rememDered that the salary of Cabinet officer is $8000 a year, while
that of Senator is but $5000 a year. It follows that the suggestion of Mr. Perkins applies
with at least equal force to the one as to the other and that bis idea evidently is that
no poor man can be a Senator and that that office also has been sequestered for the
sole enjoyment of the ricn.
It is not surprising in the light of this revelation of Mr. Perkins' mind
that his managers at Sacramento nave cast ridicule at the aspirations of Mr.
Perkins' opponent, who has taken another view of the office and has esteemed brains,
talents, eloquence and energy as more essential qualities than wealth. Neither is it
to be marveled at that the Dsmocratic newspaper which is Mr. Perkins' lea.ding ex
ponent should so persistently obtrude the suggestion that a sack and a Senatorship
necessarily go hand in hand.
THE SUPREME ESSENTIAL.
In spite of all that may be said and claimed by the managers of Mr. Perkins
about the Dinding effect of ex-parte instructions or the compelling force of hasty and
insufficiently attended caucuses, or the lien which an incumbent acquires upon the
office of Senator, it is a truth too plain for denial that merit is the only consideration
of finally and absolutely controlling effect.
It will not be denied that under certain conditions the use of such political tactics
as ante-election instructions or properly conducted caucuses are permissible, and
that to a certain extent members of the Legislature may be bound thereby. The
measure of this binding force, however, is limited by the plain proposition that an
assertion of the claims of merit can never be foreclosed by any sort of tactics.
When the Legislature meets and enters upon that week of deliberation which the
Federal statute wisely interposes between its meeting and its choice of a Senator,
then is the time for candidates to come forward, and for a full and fair measurement
of the merits of each. The absoluie freedom of this consideration on the part of each
member of the Legislature ought not to be and, in fact, cannot rightfully be impeded
by anything having for its purpose a pre-judgment of this a 11- important issue.
Conventions may instruct and caucuses ma/ be attempted by the overzealous
for victory, but, after all, it is the legislator's highest duty to his State, to his party
and to his constituents to so vote that to (.he ablest and worthiest candidate the honor
or his cnoice must fall. The member of the present Legislature who, upon his return
to his home, is unable to say, honestly, clearly and conscientiously. â¢Â»! voted for the
best man for United Sates Senator," will hnd himself in a slough of disesteem among
all who know his duty, from which no excuse about ei-parte instructions and snap
caucuses wili suffice to extricate him.
II V what merit in office does
Senator Perkins deserve a re
election?
What work has he done for
the people ?
What service has he rendered
the >atiou '.*
What has he achieved for
California?
What has he accomplished
for the Republican party ?
What have been his efforts to
render service
What part has he taken in
debates in the Senate?
What labor has he performed
in committee-rooms?
What is his record ?
Why have not his supporters
made public some evidence of
his fitness for the office of
United States Senator from
California ?
PERTINENT INQUIRIES.
The resolutions adopted by the San Jose
Board of Trade on Friday evening in
regard to the improvement of Alviso
harbor are in the fullest sense pertinent
to the Senatorial contest now before the
Legislature. The people of San Jose have
long desired the General Government to
make certain improvements at Alviso, and
have worked earnestly to that end. They
have not found, however, the support from
our Senators which they were entitled to
expect, and as a consequence their local
efforts have hitherto been in vain.
The San Jose people do not resort to any
indirection in dealing with the matter,
nor hesitate to point out the .exact place
where the blame lies. One of the resolu
tions adopted by the Board of Trad 6
declares "the need of an able and energetic
representative in the United States Sen
ate â one familiar with the needs of this
and all other sections of the State, and
who will be prepared at nil times to
champion the right of the people against
any antagonistic influences."
The State Board ol Trade, the Chamber
of Commerce in this City and similar
bodies in all parts of the State might well
and appropriately indorse these resolu
tions. Almost every city of note in Cali
fornia has experienced the neglect of our
Senators in regard to its claims for public
improvements by the Government, and in
San Francisco and some others the neglect
has been carried to an extent which argue*
a total indifference to public duty.
It cannot be urged in defense of Senator
Perkins that he has been rendered forget
ful of local interests by reason of his de
votion to great National questions. He has
taken no part in the debates of the Senate
on large issues any more than on small
ones, and has been as indifferent to the
Nation at large as to his own State.
So complete a blank is the record of the
services of Senator Perkins at Washing
ton, that when it is asked what has he
done, the question is regarded as some
thing of an insult to his supporters. He
asks for re-election on anything except his
record. His advocates assert be has a fine
sense of humor, but they do not claim
that he has any sense of legislative duty.
Therefore all inquiries as to what he has
done in the office to entitle him to the
votes of legislators, are either evaded or
scoffed at.
However the advocates of Senator Per-
Kins may ridicuie the idea of merit having
anything to do with the selection of a Sen
ator, it is nevertheless the duty of legis
lators to inquire into the merits of candi
dates. A man who has been intrusted
with an important office must give some
account of his stewardship. Wna. has
Senator Perkins done in the Senate? In
what way has be employed such abilities
as he possesses?
As was saia by the San Jose Board of
Trade, there is need of an able, energetic
representative in the United States Senate.
If Senator Perkins is sucu a man he can
surely point to something he has done or
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 1897.
at least tried to do. A full report of the
proceedings of the Senate is kept for him
in the Congressional Record. Is there no
single line in that publication to which
his supporters can point with pride or at
least with satisfaction? lias he made no
effort whatever on behalf of California?
To these and similar questiona Republican
legislators should demand an answer. It
would be folly to re-elect a man who,
after having been tried in office, has
shown himself inferior to his opportuni
ties, ineffective in his work and recreant
to the trust repossd in him.
THE LEGISLATQEE.
As the Examiner of yesterday, while
continuing its assaults upon Mr. Short
ridce, was free from any charges of
bribery, corruption or dishonesty among
Republican members of the Legislature,
there is reason for the hope that this form
of tactics is to be abandoned and that
however personal and vituperative the
Perkins managers may be in their attacks
upon his unreplying opponent the Sena
torial contest will be conducted hereafter
without the vilification and slandering of
legislators.
As c matter of fact there was never ariy
slightest ground for the charges made by
the Examiner correspondent during last
week. If there was any attempt to
"worr>" Senator Perkins "into selling a
ship," then it was the lyin? writer who
did the worrying and the Examiner man
agement that was to protit by it. The
present Legislature has been in session
but a short time, but it has already given
evidence that it is one of the best that
ever assembled in the State. It has made
proof of a sincere regard for the welfare
of the taxpayers by cuttine down the
patronage of its own members and nas
been cotnmendably earnest and prompt
in the transaction of all business which
came before it.
There are doubtless some weak mem
bers in the Legislature, and there may be
some who are vicious, but if so they have
not yet shown themselves conspicuously.
On the contrary, the dominant element or
both the Assembly and the Senate has
proven itself to be composed of men of
high character and honest convictions.
Tne assertion of the Examiner, therefore,
ibat Senator Perkins must "meet bribery
with bribery" can be true only of the
ni eels of its own office, for no such neces
sity is imposed on any candidate by the
legislators.
The absence of any repetition of these
charges in the Examiner yesterday givA
reason, as we have said, for hoping they
are to be abandoned altogether. Cer
tainly when the Examiner drops them no
one else is likely to take them up. This
is a feature of the canvass on which the
public may well be congratulated. It is
not right that honest members of the
Legislature, sincerely aiming to serve the
State as best they can, should be made
the victims of every irresponsible and im
moral writer who may see fit to assail them.
Honesty, dignity and talent should not
be exposed to the shafts of envious and
malignant mediocrity without a most reso
lute protest on the part of the better ele
ments of society.
A contest for the high and responsible
honor of representing California in the
National Senate stiould be conducted by
all competitors on merit alone. The com
petitors, moreover, should grant to the
legislators who arÂ« to decide between
them the same immunity from slander
which they ask ior themselves. We do
not hold Senator Perkins at all responsible
for the charges made by his Democratic
orean last week, but we trust he or his
friends had something to do with silencing
it yesterday. Let us have no more of this
fake story that Republicans in the Legis
lature are on a level with Doodling fakers
and their Long green managers.
THE SENATORIAL CONTEST.
. r
San Francisco News Letter.
The contest now on in Sacramento over
the choice of the United States Senator
stiould attract the attention and interest
of the people of California to an unusual
degree on account of the elements which
enter it and the lines upon which it is be
ing conducted by the respective candi
dates. It has been some time sines talent,
ambition, youth, brains and eloquence
have engaged in a contest for the high
office of Senator against wealth, age and
mediocrity before the California Legisla
ture, and the spectacle of a comparatively
young man who possesses the former en
tering the lists with one who is generally
notable for the latter may well excite the
interest of every citizen.
The career of Samuel M. Shortridge in
California, which, through years of grad
ual growth in public esteem has finally lea
up to an assertion of his claims upon the
office of United States Senator, iJ- one
which should awaken admiration in tne
mind of every man who himself has
strong and noble ambitions for the attain
ment of honor and tho achievement of
success in life.
Mr. Shortridee came to California a
poor boy, compelled from his childhood
to labor for a livelihood and an educa
tion. He worked among the miners of
Nevada County until he could earn
enough money to go to school. He then
attended the public schools and passed
through all their gradations until he had
fitted himself to teach in the schools in
which he had been taught. He thus ob
tained the means which enabled him to
attend a law school and to gratify his first
ambition for a professional career.
The expanding of his natural talents
and acquired attainments during this
struggle for an education and preparation
for a calling awakened in his mind a new
and a nobler aspiration. He felt himself
capable of becoming an orator and began
te display a power of moving the minds
of men through his eloquent and thoucht
ful discussions of public affairs. . The pos
session of this talent in a marked degree
suggested to the mind of Mr. Shortridge
and to his many friends the idea that
there was a prot>er forum for their dis
play, and aroused his ambition to attain,
sooner or later, a seat in the United States
Senate.
For the past several years this ambition
has been one of the foremost objects of
the rising young lawyer's desire, ana he
has trained all of his faculties to fill the
office with honor and credit to himself and
to the people of California whenever they
should deem it fitting to place him there.
By deep studies of public questions and of
the art of eloquent expression; by wide
reading of the best literature of all a^es;
by close and thoughtful observation of the
current of public affairs, and by constant
exercises of his abilities as a public
speaker, Mr. Snortridge has so thoroughly
prepared himself to till the hi^h office of
United States Senator that no honest and
impartial judge of his attainments will
deny his eminent fitness for the place.
The many friends of Samuel M. Short
ridge, throughout the State of CaliforniA i
realize that the time has come when his
years of service to the Republican party
should have their proper recompense and
when his talents and matured powers of
thought and expression should be given a
proper sphere.
They believe that the time has come in
the Nation when its Senate should cease
to deserve the reproach of being a club of
millionaires and should become a council
of statesmen. They deem it especially
fitting that California, which has done
more than its share in bringing upon the
Senate the former reproach, should make
a present attempt to restore to it the latter
virtue. It is for this reason that the can
didacy of Samuel M. Shortridge for the
Senate is growing daily in favor and
strength before the State Legislature, and
is meeting with widespread approval
among those who possess a proper concep
tion of the kind of man a Senator should
be, and who believe that the State of Cali
fornia would honor itself by selecting one
of its foremost representatives in culture
and in eloquence to f.ll the place.
THE contest of Samuel ]H.
Shortridge for the Senate has
I>ecn clean. He has neither
vilified his opponents nor
nought the aid of those Mho
delight in vilification. He has
appreciated the dignity of the
high office to -which he aspires
and has so conducted himself
in seeking it as to prove him.
self deserving to attain it. He
has not asked the support of
the unworthy and has not re
ceived it. His friends have not
found it necessary to assail
other candidates in order to
promote his election. They
have not maligned honest men
nor accused legislators of seek
ing bribes. They ask the elec
tion of Mr. Shortridge to the
Senate because he has merited
the honor and because from
the record of his life they can
give assurance that when an
account is asked of his stew
ardship he will be able to show"
service done for his State and
for the Million, for his party
and for the people, which will
render him as honored in office
as he has been honorable in
seeking it.
COAST EXCHANGES.
In opening its fifty-ninth volume the Placer
ville Mountain Democrat takes occasion to re
mark, with some show of honest pride, that
"the press from which its holiday compliments
were first issued came around the Horn to
Monterey in 1848, and thence to Placerville in
1851. It was the beginning of what Is now,
aside from the metropolitan press, one of the
best equipped printing offices in Northern
California. The Democrat is thus the child and
champion of what was and Is the mother
county of the State. Coming down from the
early fifties to the outgoing nineties, with
pride of place intensified by precedence in
time, and not always sharing in the prosperity
it has promoted, it has been loyal and true to
its city and county."
The Sonora Union- Democrat says that the year
189U witnessed much industrial advance
ment in Tuolunine County. It was the most
prosperous year since the decline in mining
twenty-five years ago, and to the uncovering
of rich treasure beds during the past two
years can be attributed the unprecedented
growth of tlie county in population and in
business and building enterprise. "ThCÃrowth
has been a healthy, substantial one, not in
flated by boomers from boomland, but steadily
keeping pace with the actunl developments
and rich discoveries in our mines. 1 1 has been
a growth founded on meritâ by a knowledge
that the ore bodies beneath our territory are
of such character and magnitude that a thou
sand stamps can be kept continually dropping
with great profit for a century to come, and
then there would still remain an inexhausti
ble supply that cou;d be profitably worked,
and will be, with the advent of still cheaper
modes of reducing ore."
The Los Angeles Times' annual, issued Jan
uary 1, was a magnificent newspaper of forty
eight pages, with illuminated cover, replete
with matters of interest, historical, literary
und descriptive. It will be a most excellent
advertisement abroad for orange-land.
The SanJ Luis Oblspo Keasoner has begun its
fifth volume. It is a believer in the Popu
listic faith, but has the merit of iair-minded

tious in what. he says. It is a well-printed
paper and seems to be enjoying good patron
age.
Rena Shattuek has severed her connection
with the Pitalumicm, which passes into the

a remarkable success with her newspaper,
which has prospered because of its real merits.
The Castroville Enterprise has proved true to
its name by enlarging in order to meet the in
creasing demands of advertisers and to gratify
its readers with a wider and fuller scope of the
news.
The Bakersfleld Echo declares that "to the
Kern farmer the outlook certainly is most
promising. The recent rains have moistened
the ground sufficiently for plowing, and early
grasses are responding to nature's watering
with wonderful rapidity. The horticulturist
is also quite as fortunate. All kinds of trees
and shrubbery as well as vines are very prom
ising at this time. All bespeak for the Kern
County farmer, stockman and horticulturist a
season rich in possibilities if he but do his
work well and at the proper season; and in
doing this there is nothing like taking advan
tage of present opportunities."
The Sausalito News, in its issue of January
9, describes its little city by the sea very fully,
and in a manner to attract attention to the
advantages of the place. It shows Sausalito to
be one of the truly progressive towns of Cali
fornia.

The Virginia (Key.) Enterprise learns from
what is saia to be unquestionable author
lty that the plan to drain the American Flat
country and its many mines, in all of which
pay ore has been found when the water drove
the miners from their work, is assuming a
tangible form. It is rumored that capitalists
are about to examine this proposition, which
is one of the greatest that lies outdoors in the
State of Nevada. This proposition has been
often talked of, but until now there has been
no actual likelihood of the scheme being
undertaken. So far the promoters of the pres
ent project are unknown, but it has been
learned that those interested in American
Flat properties have been seen, and that the
project is in the hands of those who will see it
put through. The Enterprise sets forth the
alluring prospect which the American Flat
country holds for those who shall drain from
the ore bodies the floods of water which cover
them. A tunnel might be run eltner from the
Alta mine or from the Crown Pom t, connect
ing these mines with the Sutro tunnel. The
cost of such a project would be nominal when
compared with the possibilities which would
attend the enterprise.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
During the year just closed Britishshipyards
have built fifty-nine ships for the British and
foreign navies, aggregating 155,849 tons,
377,980 horsepower, and over $53,000,000 in
value.
A fine record was made at the Portsmouth
dockyard last month, when from Monday
morning to Saturday noon thirty-one armor
plates, averaging fifteen tons eacn, were put
in place on the hull of the battleship Caesar.
â During the steam trials of the Powerful the
temperature in the stokeholds ranged from
75 to 90 degrees. In other vessels fitted with
the ordinary Scotch or tank boiler, the heat is
never below 90, and has gone as high as 140
degrees.
AThe Turbiana, a torpedo-boat built atW'alls
cnd-on-Tyne to demonstrate the efficiency of
steam turbine engines, had a trial December
IS and- made the remarkable speed of -iÂ».tt
knots. Tiie boat is only 100 leet long, 9 ieet
beam, and displaces 42 tons.
The Entre Rio, torpedo boat destroyer, built
in England for the Argentine Government,
has arrived at Buenos Ay res, having made the
run from St. Vincent, a distance of 3700 miles,
without calling at any port for coal. This is
the longest run made by any torpedo craft.
Baa luck seems to follow recent French naval
construction. The battle-ship Carnot barely es
caped a serious accident through the timely
discovery of derangement of the steering gear.
Her boilers were also found to be damaged
and the ship was towed into Toulon for re
pairs. Almost at the same time the Charles
Marteal, battle-ship, while undergoing trials at
sea, struck a floating spar and damaged one of
her propellers, necessitating return to port.
Prince George, British battle-ship of 14,900
tons which recently completed her trial trips,
made 10.52 knots on 10.464 porsepower dur
ing the eighth natural draught trial, 15.3
knots with 12,253 horsepower under four
hours' forced draught, ana 14.76 on 6185
horsepower during a thirty hours' continu
ous run, to ascertain her coal consumption,
which was only 1.83 pounds per horsepower
per hour. Her battery, consisting of four 12
--inch, six 6-inch, eight 12-rounders ana eight
3-pounders (the three latter guns quick-firing),
can deliver a tire in broadside during five min
utesâl 6 rounds 12-inch, 150 rounds 6-inch,
400 rounds 12-pounders and 600 rounds of 3-
pounders â making a total weight of missiles of
35,200 pounds or nearly 153Â£ tons.
The entry of naval cadets in the British navy
is to be changed and goes into effect at once.
The object is to gradually raise the age of en
try and to shorten to some extent the period
of training oa the Britannia. Cadets will
hereafter be entered three times a year instead
of twice, as hitherto, and tne appointments
trill be dated from January 15, May 15 and
September 15, at which dates the limits of
aaes for 1897 will be: January 15 and May
15, 13' 2 to 15 years; September 15, 13%
lo 15J + . For the entry on January 15,
189 a, vie limits will be 14 to 15%. There are
lo be three terms of about thirteen weeks each
year, and the period of training on the Brit
annia will extend over four terms. The period
of service us naval cadet afloat is to be eight
months, making t lie time from entry to eligi
bility for promotion live years, against six
years in this country.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
John J. Pierson, the -gailery-gods 1 ideal vil
lain, is in town. What Is more, he is boofied
for a season at the Grand Opera-house, the
scene of a series of triumphs when Mr. Pierson
was the best-hated man in San Francisco.
Pierson is a man of fine physique A well
shaped head tops a pair of splendid square
shoulders. He has a determined face, with
piercing eyes, that enable him to do wicked
deeds with a directness and an apparent
fiendish delight that often had disastrous
results.
The Doys from the gallery got into the habit
of "laying for" Pierson at the stage door after
the show. They had not been able to exhaust
their wrath at his intense villainy in hisses
and hoarse yells in the theater, so they nllea
their pockets with stones, which they let fly at
him as he went into the street. When they
added old vegetables and mud to their offer
ings Pierson, who is the mildest-mannered
man imaginable, went out by a back door.
For a month all went well. Then they dis
covered his line of retreat, and one night the
unhappy actor was forced again to submit to
the nattering though undesired indications of
appreciation.
Nor was this all. He was given a week's
vacation and proceeded to enjoy it by doing a
little surf- fishing off the big rock just below
the Cliff House. He reveled in the peace of
the breakers for half an hour and enjoyed his
fishing immensely in blissfui ignorance of the
fact that some wandering street gamin had
recognized him and was summoning his avail
able friends. He was awakened to the fact
by the patter of some stones around him and
cries of :
"That's him, Take that, you villian,"
etc.
Plerson beat an inglorious retreat and
spent the rest of his vacation out of town. In
fact, he had grown accustomed to retreating,
for often before be had spoken a word he
would be gieeted with such violent hisses that
the play could not proceed.
Mr. Pierson is a good-looking young man.
He is singularly free from the unpleasant
mannerisms so often affected by stage folk.
For a season he played the leading part in
"Alabama." He has been playing leads
with A. Y. Pearson's company during the past
two seasons and created the part of Jason in
"The Land of the Midnight Sun" in which he
opens at the Grand.

A PERTINENT QUESTION.
Bakursfield Callfornian.
What do the Republican members of the
Legislature think of the Examiner's reiterated
insult to J them in * its " a a fly suggestion of ; a
"Me*" at me capital and of the likelihood, that
blackmail and bribery will go hand in baud in
determining their choice of a Senator?
This is the question The Call asks, in blade
type and it is a pertinent question too. There
is no more reason of charging Mr. Shortridge s
friends with using money in the Senatorial
campaign than there is in charging Perkins
friends with usinr; money in the >OTember
election. Perhaps not so mxich !

"CHANGE" ON STREETCARS.
Minneapolis Journal.
After eight years of litigation the New Yor*
Court of Appeals has decided that a streetcar
conductor cannot be required to change ass
bill, and that a $2 bill is the limit. The de
cision is based upon the reasonable theory
that to compel the conductor to change large
bills would oblige Him to carry a large amount
of money and virtually to engage in the busi
ness of Danking, which would distract his at
tention from a proper oversight of his cars
and passengers.
UNfiELEN.ING.
I walked with my friend of an earlier time.
Whose guidance I strive to heed;
Who checks my spirits that lightly climb
In praise of some modern deed,
'â¢There are no great men," he assures ne oft,
"Like those that we know of yore:
The senate and stage have completely Ooffed
The glories that one* they wore.
"The pictures they paint," sars my mentor, grim.
â¢'Are patches de void of art.
And the girls are do longer demure and trim
â¢ Like the girttt who ensnared my heart.
And the tales we read ud^ the songs we sing
Are reflections of other days;
The halos which genius, extinct, may fling
O'er posterity's books. and lays."
So I thought to beguile him with other themes,
' And I spoke of the lulu that shone
Where the West, aflame with the sun's last beams.
Proclaimed that the day had flown.

Its radiance brought, no joy.

POLICEMEN AS
SWEET WARBLERS
First Public -Appearance of
the Recently Formed
Choir.
Their Singing Exceeded the Most
Sanguine Expectations of
Their Friends.
Installation of Officers of the Widows'
and Orphans' Aid Association cf
the Department.
The fact was demonstrated yesterday
afternoon that in the Police Department
there are not only crack shots but crack
vocalists. The choir made their first pub
lic appearance and acquitted themselves
most creditably.
The occasion was the installation of offi
cers of the Widows'and Orphans' Aid Asso
ciation, which was held in Judge Joach
imsen's courtroom. The room was
Crowded with members of the association,
and several ladies and children were also
present.
Captain Wittman, the retiring presi
dent, in calling the meeting to order, said
the organization was one of the grandest
that mankind could take an Interest in.
It was organized for relief of the needy
and the widow and orphan, something
that must always be provided for. It bad
now been seventeen years in existence,
and during that period had paid out $119,
--900 to widows and orpnans of deceased
members. Id the past year alone it bad
paid out thirteen death benefits, amount
ing to over $14,000. The income for the
year bad been $7200, and the association
was still in good standing, having $17,000
in the treasury, with 570 members iv good
standing on the roll.
The dues were almost nominal, being
only $1 a month, and on death of a mem
ber his widow receives $1100. The captain
I was pleased to retire from office with the
association in such a splendid condition.
Now, that the choir had been formed, he
hoped that during the present year a
benefit would be got up lor the associa
tion, so as to increase the funds in the
i treasury.
Captain Wittman then installed the fol
lowing officers: President, Captan John
Spillane; vice-president, Lieutenant W.
j F. Burke; recording secretary, Charles
I Janes; financial secretary, Â£. H. Rankin;
j treasurer, Serjeant Jonn Duncan; trus
tees â Sergeants John W. iiotiit, Albert A.
Perrin and Abranain Houghialing, Cor
poral Henry Gleeson and Policeman O. C.
j Phillips. Each was greeted with applause
j und made bis litle speech of thanks.
"Now," said Captain Whitman, "iet me
! say that there has been an innovation dur-
I ing the past year in the formation of a
choir. The members have been practicing
a little under the direction of Professor
Ziliani' and l believe they are now ready
j to show what they can do."
Impresario W. J. J. Shaw announced
â  that the cnoir was ready. Professor Ziliani
i seated himself at the piano whicn had
i been provided for the occasion and the
j choir Btood up ready for business. Their
i names are: Sergeant M. O. Anderson, P.
i K. McGee, J. L. Murphy, W. W. Wilson,

Waist,, Corporal Henry Gleeson, Sergeant
! R. A. Marshall, L. Levingston, W. J. J.
â¢ Shaw. M. Anderson, G. is. Baldwin and J.
J. Cougblin.
The piece selected for the opening
chorus was "A Dream of Peace." It was
i rendered in excellent time and the voices
! blended most harmoniously. A wild
J burst of applause greeted the conclusion
of the piece.
Then followed solos of different mem
j bers of the choir. M. Anderson sang 'The
j Heart Bowed Down" most artistically.
j He is possessed oi a full, mellow voice and
; uses it with rare judgment. He was fol
: lowed by M. Samuels, who sang "Say au
revoir but not good-bye' in hne style,
the choir joining in the chorus. Captain
Wittman recited "The Conductor's Siory"
I with fine effect and then came the great
est surprise of all. S. H. Kankin, tne
popular financial secretary, sang a selec
tion from "Lucrezia Borgia" in Italian
and literally brought down tbe bouse.
When be finished mere was a general yell
of delight and Joud calls lor an encore, 'but
be modestly declined. His singing was a
revelation. The other solos were: "Rocked
in the Cradle of tbe Deep," by Sergeant
Marshall; "My Home, My Heart's First
Home," by J. Redmond; "Answer," by
T. P. Walsh, and "Our Jack's Come Home
To-day," by Corporal Gleeson, all being
rendered in splendid style. S. H. Rankin
also gave a humorous recitation, "My
Long Lost Breeches"
President Spiiiane then called upon
Justice of the Peace Barry and the follow
ing members for brief speeches: Ex-tap
tain Short, ex-Sergeant Coles, Sergeant

j made from manzanita wood, and the
1 president briefly responded with thank".
'' Most of tbe speakers said complimentary

James Lafayette Halsted. School Di
rector and one of San Francisco's
most prominent and highly respected
citizens, is dead.
For a little less than three weeks Mr.
I Halsted had been confined to bis bed, at
first with a slight indisposition, wtaicn his
'family believed would be temporary, but

positions witn marked ability.
He was bom in Oneida County, New
York, in 1831, and be would bave been 66
years of ape on the 13th inst. He received
a fair education, and for a short time en
gaged in scbnolteaching in bis native

curred in 1850. He started out with an
uncle to make the trio around tbe Horn,
but en route bis uncle died, ana James,
then only 18 years of age, was landed
alone in bau Francisco, dependent on his
own resources.
He remained in this City only a few
months and then struck ont for the mines
of Calaveras and Amarior counties. He
eventually located near ihe town of Vol
cano, in Amador County, and here he was
immediately made a School Director. In
his official capacity he employed M. M.
Estee as teacher.
While in Volcano Mr. Halstedmet Miss
Mary E. Brown, who had come across the
plains with her parents from their Eastern
Home. In November, 1853, they were mar
ried and the widow survives him.
A year after bis marriage Mr. Halsted
left the mines where he had been suffi
ciently successful to eive him a small
working capital and went to Santa Cruz.
There for twenty-five years he was en
gaged in the lumber business with the
Watsonville Mill and Lnmber Company,
Daring all this time he maintained a
lively interest in school matters and was
almost continually a director. For the
four years prior to 1882 he was president
of the Santa Cruz Board of Education.
The year previous to his assuming tnis
office he represented the district in which
Santa Crnz is located in the Assembly.
About the year 1874 Mr. Halsted, feel
ing that he had acquired sufficient wealth
for his needs, and yet being of too active a
temperament to retire, decided to study
Jaw as an avocation. After a brief course
of study he was duly admitted to the bar
and entered into practice with Congress
man Barbam. In 1882 he came to San
Francisco, and the law firm of Barbara,
Boiton & Halsted was formed. Tbis
firm dissolved after two or three years'
practice, and in 1886 he engaged with his
four sons in the undertaking business. He
was actively engaged in this business up
to the commencement of his last illness.
Mr. Halsted was twice elected a
member of the San Erancisco Board of
Education. He was first honored by the
Republican party in 18Â£5, and served one
term, tie was again elected last fall, and
the bandsome majority which he received
attests his popularity.

WATCHING FOR BUTLER.
Plans of the Police Department
to Receive the i.wan
hilda.
A System of Signals to Tell of H r
Approach Should She Arrive
at Night.
Chief Crowley is determined to leave
no stone unturned in order to catch Frank
Butler, the notorious Australian mur
derer. Yesterday afternoon the United
States revenue cutter Corwia sailed for a
cruise along tbe coast, and as she will be
on her way back to San Francisco about
tiie time tne Swanhilda is expected here,
an officer with the necessary duplicate
warrants went out on the cutter. Should
the Swanbilda be spoken at sea, the offi
cer will be put aboard and Butler will be
put in irons when the ship reaches port.
AH Chief Crowley's plans are well laid.
The officer on the Corwin was placed
there on tbe off chance, but according to
his arrangements with the towboat com
panies yesterday there is no possible
chance of the Swanhilda netting to an
anchorage without his knowing it. The
Chief and Sergeant Bonner went to the
{shipowners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company and the Spreckels Towboat
Company, and certain signals were agreed
upon.
If any of the company's tugs sight the
Swanhilda in the dark a certain number
of whistles will be blown and ti:e look-out
man at Point Lobos will at once notify the
Exchange, and the latter will inform Chief
Crowiey.
From the Chief's office the news will be
sent to Meiggs wharf, where the revenue
cutter Hartley will be in readiness night
and day. The police-boat will be lowered
and taken in tow by the Hartley. In the
Whitehall boat will be Sergeant Bonner
and Officer Ferguson, and at a moment's
notice their boat can be placed alongside
an incoming ship, and it would not take
long for such good boatmen as the two
officers to reach the deck.
When the Swanhilda is sighted the
proposition is to run the Hartley ont as
far as Point Bonita, if the weather be fair.
It a sea is on she will not go any furtin r
than >he fort and if it is blowing heavily
she will not venture further than Lime
Point.
"All the necessary precautions have
been taken," said Chief Crowiey yester
day. "It appears to me, however, that if
Butler is on board ibe Swanhilda when
that vessel is off the Farallones, he will
have no chance to l^ave her until she
ancuors in the bay. Of course, there is
always the 'attempt at suicide' to be
guarded against, and that contingency is
really why we are taking all these pre
cautions."
DAVIS CAUGHT AGAIN.
Detective Anthony Has Arrested the
San Jose Jallbreaker.
Detective A. Anthony, from a descrip
tion furnished the Police Department by
the Sheriff of San Jose, arrested George
Davis on Sacramento street yesterday
afternoon.
Davis is in receipt of a pension from the
Government for having served in the
navy during the late war, and in adaition
to this he has a penchant for picking up
things that do not belong to him. For
lhis act he was under a sentence of six
months' imprisonment in the San Jose
jail, from winch institution he escaped
last Wednesday and came to this City,
where be spent his last quartor's pension
in dissipation. His intoxicated condition
assisted the detective to recognize him. He

STORMS RAGING
ALONG THE COAST
Incoming Vessels Bring
Tales of Heavy Winds
and Waves.
Some Minor Accidents and the
Loss of a Man From the
North Bend.
A Water Front Cslebrity Wfco Had
to Huat for Carfare WifhVi
Knife and Scissors.
The storms that nearly wrecked the
American bark Fresno seem to prevail
along the coast. The bark Carrollton ar
iived yesterday with her cargo shilted, the
schooner North Bend lost a man overboard
during a heavy southeaster, the barken
tine Northwest fpcm Port BJakeley for
Newport had to put in here in distress
and tne whaleback City of Everett re
ported unusually heavy weather, which
kept the hull buried nearly all the time
and left nothing but the deckhouses out
of water.
The captain of the Carrollton reports
that on December 31 the vessel ran into
a strong southeast gale, which later on
shifted to southwest. The vessel iabored
heavily and the rudder was damaged.
The cargo shifted to port and for a time
the situation was precarious. Everything
came out all right with the exception of
tin.- list to port and the Carrollton brought
it in with her.
On January 3 the North Bend was in a
strong south breeze anu Captain Winkel
ordered reefs in what sail there was set.
While at work Fred Falk fell overboard.
The schooner was put about and in spite
of the heavy sea a boat was lowered, but
no trace of the "man overboard" could be
found. After the vain search the boat was
got aboard again and the schooner re
sumed her voyage.
The barkemine Northwest, from Port
Blakeley lor Newport, carried away her
rudder-bead on December 29, and her cap
tain decided 10 put in here for repairs.
The chances are that the cargo will be sent
south in another vessel and that the
Northwest will go on the drydock.
The ships Yoaemite and Occidental also
got in lust nitrtit, and the captains report
unusually heavy weather throughout the
entire trip.
The oarsmen about the water front want
to have a championship regatta in &an
Francisco on Washington's birthday. The
idea is to bring all the crack professionals
together and make a hanuicap out oi it.
Henry Peterson was approached yester
day, and agreed to enter it the race was
over a three-mile course. "The last time
I was in a handicap," said he yesterday,
"I had to give the last starter 20 seconds.
In ooiisequence I had to row my heart out
over a miie course in order to get any
where near first. Over a three-mile course
it would have been different."
A committee from the \veÂ«t Ends,
Dolphins, Ariels, South Ends and others
will go to Sacramento tliis week in order
to secure an|approt>riuiion for an inter
county regatta on February 22. Should
they succeed one oi the finest displays
ever witnessed on the bay will be given.
In anticipation of the event the naval
battalion has two crews in active train
ing and yesterday both of them were out
in barges. Tiiey made an excellent show
ing.
Mrs. Henry Peterson, wife of the cham
pion oarsman, got even with her lord and
master yesterday. Last Saturday ihe
champion played a practical joke on his
batter half and she vowed vengeance.
Henry was late yesterday morning and
tried to get into his coat in a hurry. He
found the sleeves sewed up. He looked at
his wife and laughingly said, "That's one
on me," and seizing another garment ran
up the hill for the car at the corner. He
boarded it, and just before he passed bis
own house on the down trip the conduc
tor asked for hi& fare. Henry dove down
to get the money, but couldn't get into
his pocket. His wite had seweu it up.
His wite and daughter viewed the whole
scene, but Peterson did not mind that so
much as having to stand the conductor off
until he could cut the sutches out.
Although this is midwinier cual is not
in demand. Ai the present time the supply
is more than abundant, and the mer
chants are taking full advantage of the
lay days on coal cargoes. At the present
lime ttiu British ships Langdale, Leicester
Castle and the wnaleback City of Everett
are taking turns under the Rosenfeld
bunkers. They have three different
ciasses of coal aboard and the consignees
are making storesMps out of them and
taking the coal as they want it.
The wrecker WiiiteJaw yesterday recov
ered the anchor lost by the bark Fresno
when she arrived last Saturday.
James McMahon & Sons are having a
hard time getting the bis gun intended
lor the fortification of Lime Point into
position. It has to be there by January
20 and is now only halt way up the hill. A
second gan? of men was sent over yester
day and the work will be pushed uight
and day until completion.
Two of t&re crew of the British warship
Pheasant deserted Jast Saturday night and
took with them a catamaran. The captain
is not so anxious about the sailors but he
does want the harbor poiice to recover, it
possible, his float.

WILL BE FORCED
ON THE STREET
Widow Morton and Her
Daughter Are in
Distress.
For Thirteen Years They Have
Occupied a Home on the
City's Property.
Only Ten Days in Which to Move
Their Belongings and Find
Another Habitation.
"If they would only give me just a few
months to try to prepare another habita
tion, then I wouldn't feel so broken
hearted at having to part with my little
home."
Those are the words uttered by the
Widow Morton yesterday afternoon, the
same little widow that has been given
ten days' notice to either move or have
herself and grown-up daughter, together
with their belongings, cast into the street. I
It would not take ten days to move the |
few pieces of household furniture that or
nament the Morton home. But where to
put that lurniture and where to go to find
another place mat they might call home,
there the difficulty lies, for the Mortons I
are poor, very, very poor.
Just thirteen years ago Mrs. Morton and i
her nusband, who was then living, paid
$200 for the little home that the widow |
will soon be forced to abandon.
It was a sort of ramshackle affair in
those days, but the thrifty little housewife
soon made the place habitable.
With strict economy a few dollars wdie
laid aside, and later they were all put into
the little house â a couple of rooms were
added â and things seemed to look brighter
to the members of that little household.
But six years ago the lather sickened
and died, and when grief entered that
home poverty seemed to take on a sterner
aspect. A pension of $8 a month was paid
to the widow, lor her husband had Deen a
Grand Army man, and for many a long
day thai $8 supported both mother ana
daughter. The latter was delicate and
couldn't wors, but she used to go down to
the wharves ana gather the siray bits of
lumber find the few pieces of coal dropped
from the carts, and in that way saved a
fuel Dill.
Then the mother secured employment
atcieiining out the kindergarten schools
and very often the food that she would
gather from the barrels in the schooi
yards for her chickens would be
snared by her and the daughter, for $8
a month does not permit a very luxuri
ous table.
She didn't retain her position in the
schools very long, for one day a friend of
herd was leit a widow, with three small
boys io support and liou~e rent to pay
and, Mrs. Morton realizing her friend's po
sition, offered her work, which was gladly
taken.
Just before the holidays great prepara
tions went on in the Morton household,
for the only daughter was to be marnea
on Christmas day, and the interior of the
home was papered and painted, a carpet
laid in the sitting-roomâ the only carpet
the house had ever boasted â and every
thing was made as nice as possible for
the son-in-law that was to make his home
with them.
And then, when contentment seemed to
come at last into that little home, sud
denly and as unexpectedly as a thunder
bolt from the skies came an order from
the Board of Supervisors inferming them
that their house rested upon tbe street
and mnst be removed within tea days.
The house is too old to be moved, and
to be torn down means such a loss to the
Morton family. As the widow said yester
day: '"I am nearly 70 years old, and after
years of hard struggling to be thrust out
of my home is more than terriDie, and I
Know my mind cannot bear the strain."
Then the poor woman who had met with
so many misiortunes and bowed to many
sorrows buried her face in her hands and

Knights of the Golden Banner.
Some time since the drill corps of the Knifhts of

knights have received a note from thÂ» cavalry
corps announcing its withdrawal of the challenge,
and that the knights accepted the note without v

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
nt station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and huudredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connec", pan\ g of equal air pressure; Iso-N
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiirh" means hiijh barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied b.v fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
â¢ Lows us, ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in thÂ» interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south alone- the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain pouth of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in ibe vicinity of Idaho, and
Iho pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 10. \
Very elaborate arrangements are being
made for the observance of Washington's
birthday by the Junior O.der of United
American Mechanics. Headquarters have
been opened at 855 Broadway, and the fol
lowing officers have been named : Presi
dent, C. W. Miller; secretary, H. Rief;
treÃsurer, D. R. Fortl ; executive commit
tee â Percy Heise, L. Hager. GÂ»orge Ran

Charle3 Tyrrell.
"We 1 already have guarantees from soci
eties that will insure a s;reat demonstra
tion," and Secretary Rief to-day. "There
will be no parade in San Francisco on that
day, and we will have all the people from
that side of the bay, as well as delegations
from Santa R>sa, San Jose, Stockton, Au
burn, Healdsbur*; and Sacramento.
"The Grand Army, ;he National Guard,
the Odd ir'eliows an i Masonic orders will
join, and there w.il be some very novel
and interesting features. On February 3
a grand ball wi.l be {riven to help the ex
penses of the narade, which will cost
about $2000.";
Ti:e ioliowing circular has been dis

COLLEGE OPENS AGAIN.
Many More l asebal Candidates and
Track 'Athlete* Than I. st Year.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 10â The spring
term of the State University will open
to-morrow morning. Students will regis
ter for courses during the day. Regular |
recitations will commence at once, with- |
out the delays which generally mart the !
opening of the fall term. The outlook
would indicate that the enrollment for the
remainder of the college year will be
about the same as for the term recently
closed. Those who wi 1 leave of their own j
accord and those whose names will be I
dropped from the roll will doubtless be '
counterbalanced by the new entrants.
With the opening of the term will come j
interest in athletics ami students' affairs I
in general. Baseball and track athletics )
Hi be on the - boom. The almost ' un- j
broken record of defeats :at baseball met I
by the Berkeley piayers at the. hands of J
the Palo Alto men, the overwhelming de- I
feat in the last football contest, and tue I
tying of the score in the track athletic meet !
last spring, has had a strong tendency to
cause the U. C. men to look to their
? laurels. The blue and gold will have a
| much better baseball team than last sea
son, and .the list of men who are in train
ing for the track an ' field events is larger
â¢ by fifteen than in 1896.
Anewsy-tem will b^ inaugurated for,
the choosing of track athletes. It will be
patterned very much after the methods in
use at Harvard. A short time before the >
intercollegiate . match, a standard of
records will be set up, and only those who
>qual or surpass them will be allowed to
inter the games with Stanford. The
:hosen lew will bi put into training
quarters and dieted, which is also an in
novation for Berkeley track athletes.
Anotner source of int-rest for the stu-
Jent body will be the two annual debates
with Stanford, the Te uiar intercollegiate
and the Carnot. Twice as many candi
dates will enter the preliminaries as last
year.
The vacancy in the department of arch
oeoloay caused by the death of Dr.
Qeorse M. R:cuardson wi.l be filled for the
present by Instructor Rockwell of the de
partment ol Latin.
Death of W. H. Kussell.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 10 âWilliam
H. Russell, a farmer in the San Joaqnin
Valley, died yesterday afternoon of heart
disease. He was a native of Missouri,
aeed 71 years. The remains have been
shipped to Linden for bural.
Sensations in >tore
OAKLAND. Cal., Jan. 10.â Edwards
Davis, Oakland's sensational preacher, be
gan last night at the Central Church in
Hamilton Hall a series of characteristic
sermons. Some time ago it was thought
that the poet-preacher had curtailed his
eccentricities because some in his congre
gation had protested against his "actors'
act" in the puipit. The natural bent of
the man was shown laÂ«t night when be
announced tDat his series of sensational
sermons would include tne following sub
jects: January 17, "A General Roa3t; Prot
estants and Romanists in Part;cu:ar."
January 24, "Can Christians Sin? Dance,
Play Cards, Attend Theaters?" January
31, "A Matrimonial Drama in Tnree Acts";
Courtship, Marriaga and Divorce." Fet
ruary 7, "The Advance of Modern
Tdought, and tne Retreat of the Sectarian
Church." February 14, "A Plea for the
Non-Churchman; Because of the Bent-
Backed Bicots."

HOTLY SCORED
THE MEDIUMS
Rev. Dr. F. R Farrand Says
They Spread Infidel
Teachings*.
Hs Classes the B st of Spiritu
alism as a Clever System
of Legerdemain.
The Clerical L-cturer Believes in
Mind- Reading and Tells What
H Knows.
Rev. F. R. Farrand delivered a lecture
at the Howard Presbyterian Church last
night on "The Evils of Spiritualism."
The speaker took the ground tnat the
Bible and spiritualism are essentials" an
tagonistic and that the study of spiritual
ism conduces to infidelity in spite of all
restraints.
"Tne great trouble with spiritualism is
that it lacks facts," said the speaker. "If
it were based on any real law of nature it
would not be a 'rathole revelation,' as Em
erson termed it. Why, if the spirits of
those we have known can return, do they
not cmc to all of us? Why should a few
mediums be the only ones who can hold
these communications?
"The great trouble is that the origina
tors of this so-called truth have been ex
posed. I refer No the Fox sisters. The>'
were not only' exposed, but they them
selves wen: about the country exposing
their own claims. It was the same thing
with the so-cal.ed great medium Daniel
Holmes."
The speaker challenged any me'lium to
produce anything of consequence in broad
daylight, and said their bt-st acts were
ricks i hat did not even rival the skill of
Herrmaun.
"Many of the alleged spiritual phenom
ena depend upon automatism," be said,
"and arise from mental suggestion."
The speaker thought that mind-reading
would account tor a great deal that now
passes for spiritualism. He said he him
self bad tried tbe experiment of blind foil
ing people and having them find hidden
knives, etc., in a manner truly marvelous.
He believed that much of spiritualism
could be accounted for In a similar man

WILLIS LOST HIS MONEY.

to the Calvary Baptist Church

ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 10.â W. F.Willis,
who committed suicide last night in the

Carson, Nov., asa carpenter. Just recently
he returned and visited his former home.
His wife was Miss Â£va Smith, a daughter
of Lyman Smith.
In speaking of the tragedy to-day Mrs.
Willis saiu : "An injusiice was done
Mr. Willis in saying that we parted on ac
count of his being jealous of me. He
never wai. lam the one that asked for
the separation, and when we parted I left
him. As to bis letters found after bis
death the 'strain' he referred to was the
the loss of money. He should have had
$150 on his person, but nothing can be
lound of it at present."
Mr. Smith stated that the second letter
was meant for him. He said: "Will
came to me and borrowed $5 Saturday,
promising to pay me on Monday, but he
was unable to do it I do not know bow
he lost his money, but undoubtedly the
loss of it caused him to take his life.

hair, threw her on tue floor and beat her.
She got to her feet, and as he again seized
her by the hair she grabbed a potato
masher and struck wildly at him.

and then she grabbed a hatchet and
struck him several times with it till he
was forced to give up the fight. Mrs.
Marks declares that she will apply for a
divorce.

There will have to be some politics
transacted very speedily during the next
seven weeks. So far, with the exception
ot the Popuiists, noihing has been done
that was not undone yesterday, when the
committee of twenty-one virtually sur
rendered their litle to office.
This action on their part neeis some ex-
Dlanation more than has been given. It
is not to be supposed thai men of the
standing of the committee would have
worked a whole month before they dis
covered that they had been duped. It is
an insult to their intelligence to presume
that they worked for four weeks before
they found out that they were toe Jaugh
ine stock of a few machine politicians.
While there may be some ground for
doubting the motive of tne Cny Central
Committee, there can be no dou bt as to the
ability of their apDointees to huve ful
filled the task allotted to them, viz.: that
of naming del- gates to a municipal con
vention.
IÂ« the motive for the committee resign
ing were really that they believ- d they
Had been misled me very best thing in
the world for tuem to do would have been
to go ahfead with their work and visit a
severe punishment on the heads of those
who Had been guilty of tricKery. They
had it in their f.ower to do so. The del
egates they would have named would
have appointed tuo next City Central
Committee and wouid thus Have bad tue
complete satisfaction of making the trick
prove a boomerang to the trickster. This
would certaiuly have been the case had
there beeu no other reason.
But there was another reason and a
powerful one, and Us existence is due to
the very effective and commendable work
of the leaders ot the committee of twenty
one. Quite recently â iv lactthe echoes of
the strne have not yet died away â those
same men, or ratner the wing of the Re
publican party tiiat they represent, suc
ceeded by a struggle, the details ot wb.ch
are well known, in establishing the prin
ciple that delegates to conventions should
be elected at primaries and sHouid not be
appointed by any political org nization.
This principle proved popular and at the
very next primary was indorsed.
As soon Â«< the committee of twenty-one
realized that it had made a mistake in
trying to ando its own good work it wisely
withdrew. A very conscientious man told
me to-day that this view is not the correct
one, but if not, then the members of the
committee of twenty-one are tHe most un
fortunate victims of circumstances that
are on record even in this "hatchery of
the unexpected."
Oaklar.d is congratulating herself this
week. On numerous occasions the city
has been regarded as the abiding-place of
political and religious cranks, freaks and
enthusiast*. Probably there has oeen some
little foundation for tnis reputation, but
at present >he occupies a rear sÂ«at. During
the past two weeks Berkeley and San
Francisco have each furnisued two sen
sations in the theological wor.d. and Oan
landers are considering why they have
been so graciously passed by.
In the biggest of the turee cities two
new churches have been startedâ one by a
youne man, the other by an older man â
end out in Berkeley Revs. Payne and
Robbin have huned the thunders of their
respective pulpi s at each otHer, and this
was quickly followed by a young man
from San Francisco and anoiher from the
South founding a new church also at the
Un -versify town.
While the experience of being ignored
is new, Oakland does not resent the slight.
The feeling among some members of
the Alameda delegation is that if Per
kins be not nominated for the Senate on
the first ballot next Tuesday, he wili not
succeed himself. 8* natcr Perkins has no'
acted tai ly by the Republican party of
Alameda County. He has evidently con
sidered that his home delegation was so
safe that be could ignore it with mpunity
and lias broken p^ed^es for wh.ch even
his most ar. ent supporters have not at
tempted to explain or apologize. Spite of
all talk about so-called "indorsement?,"
which, by tne way, when extracted person
ally from candidates prior to election, are
certainly closely allied to violations of the
Purity of Election .Law, the majority of
the legislative members Irom this county
express themselves as being perfectly in
dependent to vote next Tuesday. In fact
it is not contradicted that if two of the
members had pledged themselves in the
Senatorial matter they could not have
been elected. Perkins' actions in the Con
gressional fight and the Waymire matter
have cut deeply.
Some of the expressed candidates for
office next March have a hard task before
them. Tney are trying to carry morals
on one shoulder and politics on the other,
and if the necessary diplomacy be not
forthcoming, many will perish. The Sun
day-closing question has been revived,
and a shrewd uess would be that senti
ment on the matter i& about equally di
vided. The question will probably be
submitted to the people at the next elec
tion, and on the result the next Council
men will presumably act. Tins bein so,
the opponents of c osing wiii mite their
tight against both measure and men. The
issue is a very delicate one for politicians,
as the powerful cliurcu element and tHe
active Christian Endeavorers are on one
side and the majority of the commercial
element on the other. The candidate who
can gain the support of both deserves to
win, and he will. Stcabt W. Booth.

LADIES LEARNING
TO HYPHOTIZE
Leap Year Privilege Now
Extended Through
All the Years.
Grave Danger to Men While j
Intending to Be Only a
Brother to Her.
The Indiscriminate Teachin? of Hyp
notism as Now Practiced
in San Francisco.
Two yonng men of respectable appear
ance have rented a front room with an |
imposing bay-window on Howard street
and have established what the card on the ;
stairs announcesâ a school of hypnotism.
As one of the young men said yesterday,
they will teach this marvelous and dan
gerous power to any one "who has the '
price." According to this the most de- '
prayed person south of Market street is ;
jast as eligible to become a master of this :
strange phenomenon as the purest-minded j
man or woman.
"Can all persons be taught hypnotism?"
was asked by The Call reporter.
"About 80 per cent of ali people can [
learn to be hypnotists," said Mr. Bodge,
MM of the teachers. '-The remaining 20
per cent are prevented from learning by !
certain scarcely definable characteristics. :
The difficulty to overcome in teaching
hypnotism is to get the subject into a
passive condition. Some persons delude
themselves into thinking they are in that
state when their nervous atiention, to the :
contrary, is greatly strained. They watch
every move the teacher makes. It is very ,
hard then to hypnotize them. I have !
never been hypnotized. I was advised, if
I intended to teach it, never to allow my
self to be put in a hypnotic state. I can
tell by intuition and in a few moments
wueiher a person can be hypnotized or
not."
"Is there not danger to society in this
indiscriminate teaching of this power?"
"There is dancer in the evil use of it,
but we cannot control that. We exact i
j from the pupil a 'promise not to make a
bad use of it, bat, as a matter of fact, all ;
that amounts to is a promise. When
hypnotized a person is in a :alf-conscions \
s;ate. Put a wooden da. ger in the hand
of a subject and tell him to stab a certain \
person, he will not hesitato to do it, but j
we claim that if you give him a real dasr
ger and tell him to do the same thing, he
will not do it, that is if the man in his
heart, while in h:s normal conaition.wou d
do no murder. Ii would be the same with
a man who is strongly prejudiced against
intoxicating liquors. Though you bid
him to do it he would not drink. In the
same way we claim that no advantage could
be taken of a woman."
â¢'What reasons do your pupils give for
wanting to learn to hypnotize?"
"Various reasons, " replie i youne BodgÂ».
"Siime want to learn it for busines* rea
sons, some for pleasure and entertain
ment, some for the curative or alleviaiive
properties that there may be in it. That
man who was in here when you came,"
ne said, r?ferring to a middle-aged man
who had called to arrange for the taking
of his tirst lesson, 'says tie wants to use it
on his wife who is ill, and who will not
consent to let any one else hypnotize her.
Physicians are u^ing the power more and
more. A physician who cannot hypnotize
a patient is scarcely up to date.
"They claim that they are the only peo
ple who snould be allowed to use hypnot- !
ism. Ido not see it in that light. Why has j
not that man who wa here a little while \
aeo as much right to use it for the allevia- j
tion of pain in his wife as a physician?"
"D ) women learn hypnotism?"
"Quiie as easily as men. We have about ;
as many ladies, young and old, among our
pupils as men. The ladies u*e it for par- i
lor amusement, and we have one or two j
who are quite proficient. They can majce
a man think be is bis own grandmother."
With this power the new woman be
comes tLe possessor of powerful leap year ;
privileges during the lapse of this and the
centuries to come.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Much Property Being Of
fered at Tempting
Prices.
The Tendency of Property Values
Will Nd Doubt Be Upward
During the Year.
The Excitement and Fear Awakened
by the Presidential Election In
tensified Last Year's Dullness.
There is no properly In San Francisco being
sacrificed at the present time, but there is
much good property being offered here at
prices that will insure investors large returns
within a very few years; and the class of men
who are making investments attests the faith
that is lelt in San Francisco's fortune by those
who arc best able to study carefully the situa
tion here as It now exists.
The following is the opinion of Thomas Ma
gee on the future of the real-estate market:
"We doubt whether daring the mist thirty
years there was a m re unsatisfactory year in
real estate than 1890. .Prices were reduced
everywhere, except on Market street, between
Keurny and Jone-i. Previously, since the dull
ness began in May. L B9l, the best portions of
Pacific Heights, whicn is the best residence
property of .lie City, like the choicest prop
erty on .Market street, kept moving upward, in
the face 01 the otherwise universal full in
prices; but land on Pacific Feirhtn. even the |
very best of it, gave way in IS9CJ, not fre
quently or far, but still its price was weaker.
"As to other property generally,
wprehouse and factory property, it wus Im
possible to fix a price for it, it fell so fast. The
most striking illustration of this was tr.esale j
ot the gas company's property on Howard,]

First, Framont and Bealo, between Mission
md Howard. So many foundries and fac;ones
have within the past five years moved away
from there, and rents have been so reduced
that naturally the prices paid were very low.
The excitement and fear awaken* d by the
I're-ideiitial electiou greatly intensified thi
prevailing dullness, bales, for s:x -weeks or
two months prior to that event almost ceased
here as they did elsewhere.
"The real estate on t look is that prices of all
lots in dwelling regions That ate within con
venient reach oi cabie or electric curs will ti"t
fall lurther. The .tendency will be upward,
nlthoueh we look for little advance in prict s
of any kind of dwelling property, of eith. r the j
first, second or thlr i class this year. Trice- ol
the two laM<r Â»i:vis of property have fallen !
since May, 1891,25 to 40 i>er <â¢* :. Many j
new houses, costing $1,500 to $5,000 tach, '
have within that time been bolt in the dis
tricts where these reduct:ons occurred and sev
eral fast electric-cur lines hi,ve been built I
nu; ;o thc-in. These mds to progress and in
crease of improvements of course te^d ro a :
vancc price*, and they would have so advanced
lust year, but the pernicious effects of tne in
flation <>f 18S9 to 1891 have not yet been
wholly erased, and no immediate advance ot
prices" ran thereiore yet be looked fur.
"Business properties of any kind, present or i
prospective, paying anything nkeafoir net
inc< me w.ll ho <1 their own this year. The I
best business properties on Market street cer- )
tainly will, and the next best, near to Market
street, whether wholesale or retail, but es
pecially the latter, will not at all be likely to
show weaker prices. Reduced prices for the !
latter ciass of properties were exhibited at nn j
â action sale last year. O'<e of the parcels was i
on Koarny, north of Sutter; another on
Montgomery, oetwefn Busn and Sutter, nnd
ihe th;rd was on Market streeÂ§ itself south
west of First.
"Complaints of a dead real estate market I
and loud complaints of the existing dullness
of business will aid no one. Money and hard
work are needed to revive loth, and both
money and hsrd work have been expended
largely ai.d wisely on the Sun Joaqnin Vui; y
road. LarÂ£e dividends of City growth and
prosper. ty may soon be expected Irom that
road an well as fair dividends to its stockhold
ers. But very much more work and expendi
ture are needed to push the City ahead, to bring
piosperity and to keep up, as we only can,
with rivals who have been lavish in the ex
penditure of both. We hope and believe that
all the work ana money needed to keep San
Francisco in the Joreground will be 'orthcom- !
ing. The City's growth cannct be permanently j
retarded unless our own culpable supineness !
permits it."
If. H. Crira, one of the oldest real estate â 
brokers in San Francisco, and one who has j
seen many up* and downs in tne business as
regards the fluctuations of the realty market,
has rather decided opinions about real e-tate
matters". He inclines strongly to the be iei
that there is going to be a st<-ady denmnd for!
properly. The gentleman ass rts that quito a â 
large amount of private capital is mateiial
iz;ng either lor loans or investment in real
estate.
He says that idle money has become restless
nnd he leels confident that before long there
will be a great deal of money in this commun
ity at curreui rates of intere-st, which must |
have beneficial results ou real estate and local I
interests gen'-rallr. He claims that whiie â¢
business affairs have been somewhat out of i
joint f>r the past few yean, the community, i
hs a whole, is in better condition than -.vouia j
be generally exjected.

| on the raving with bitumen of Geary street,
I from Kearny to Stockton, and on Stockton
I street, from Geary to Market, will probably be
I delayed. The property-owners along the line

wiii take the location 6t a hospital out of the

SHORT HOURS OF LABOR.
Mr. Bliss Urges the Y. M. C. A
to Agitate in That
Direction.
Advocates a Saturday Half-Ho iday,
Which WoulJ Fill the Churches
on Sunday.
In the Y. M. C. A. Hall yesterday aft
ernoon Rev. W. D. P. Bliss addressed a
large audience on his favorite theme of
Christian socialism, also dealing in further
detail with the rminicipalization of public
utilities. â
General Secretary H. J. McCoy presided
and Rev. J. E. Scott and Rev. W. H.
Moreland were among those who occupied
seats upon the plutiorm.
Mr. B.iss pave to his remarks a more
local application than on previous occa
sions and in many cases cited the result
or personal observation in this City to
emphasize the subject under immediate
discussion. He stated apropos of the
congested state of the labor market that
a workingman of San Francisco had in
formed him that unskilled labor could be
obtained in unlimited quantities for board
and 10 cents a day. Machinery might al
most be regarded, under the competitive
system, as the foe of progress and the
home, since it was continually depriving
the skilied emDloye of his job.
The majority of young men, he was
sorry to tray, were airaid to marry and
establish homes of their own The dive
and social impurity inevitably resulted
fr< m stic.ti conditions.
"We must preach a co-operative civ
ilization," urged the sreaker. "We must
eitner have a combination of the few,
which develops greed, or of the many]
whch develops fraternity." The co
operative municipality was, he contend
ed, the most immediately practical means
of securing relorm. The Y. M. C. A., he
pointed oul. might well improve its 'op
portunities by standing foi the lessening
ot Sundar labor, and if the clergymen of
San Francisco desired to till their entireties
they should demand the Saturday balf
hoiiday. A short-hour movement was to
day an imperative necessity.
Shpot hours in the wo/kshop meant Jong
hours in the house, the library and the
church. The extension of municipal aciiv
ities would help materially to hasten these
conditions Mr. Bl:s*s also advocated the
nationalization of telegraphs and rail
roads. In this connection he referred to
the Western Union Company as a corpo
rntion which had "its hand upon the neck
of the United States."
"I believe," aaid he, with emphasis,
"that Uncle Sam should say 'Hands off !'
to the Western Union Telegraph Com
pan.vv"
"God help America," he fervently ex
claimed, "if we go much further inviting
ttie government of corporations, for corpo
rations and by corporations."
The conclusion of Mr. Bliss' address was
an earnest appeal to his hearers to labor
in the true spirit of Jesus Cnnst.

TWO SUDDEN
DISAPPEARANCES
They Cause a Great D&al of
Worrinmt in Two
Households.
JimmieTreadwell Has Been Away
From Home Since
Tuesday.
Young Mrs. J J Welch Has Been
Missing From the Sams
Time.
Jimmie Treadwell, the 19-year-old heir
to $1,500,000. has been gone from his resi
dence in tbis City since last Tuesday.
Since last Tuesday Mrs. J. J. Welch, a
divorcee of 19, afrend of the Treadwelb
and a fasc'saung yoang woman, has also
Ken gone, auu t.Js coincidence has
caused no end of worruufit in both
households.
Yesterday Jimmie turned up in San
MRS. J. J. WELCH (Formerly MINNIE SHONE), the Divorcee, Who Was Said to Have Eloped
With James Treadweil, the Heir to $1,500,000. The Latter, However, Denies the Story.
Jose, where his si-ter, Mrs. Nolan, had
gone to seek him, but pretty Mrs. Welch
has not been heard of, and the young
man stoutly denied knowing anything of
her whereabouts.
Altogether it is a most mixed-up af
fair, according to the story of those
most interested. IvanTreadwell, Jimmies
brother, says he knew of the two young
people '"skipping off" on Tuesday last,
he thougni possibly to be married, but he
is not willing to admit that. He says
any marriage between them would be
annulled anyway.
Mrs. Shone, mother of Mrs. Welch, said
she knew her daughter had left tlie City
with young Mr. Treadwdl last Tuesday,
and she believed tliey were married.
Ivan Treaciweti, when seen at his resi
dence, 517 Octavia street, yesterday, said:
"I learned of tht-ir skipping off last
Tuesday to San Jose, and I went to see
the girl's mother. From her I learned
that the marriage ceremony had taken
place. Well, peruaps it's a good thing, so
let it go at that.
"There is one thing that I do know, and
that is that our gmirdian. George Y. Bol
linger, will not countenance the marriage
because Jimmie is only 19 years old and is
nor yet of age. It will have to be an
nulled."
Mrs. Shone is the mother of the fortun
ate youns woman who is supposed to
have captured the heart and hand of the
prospective young millionaire. She lives
at 50. y z Larkin street, where a Call re
porter presented his respects yesterday
akernoon.
She was asked as to the details of the
engagement and ceremony.
She looked at the reporter as he spoke,
her eyes dimmed by ioyous tears. She
turned to other people present, exclaim
in;.' in perfect rapture:
"Minnie is married!"
"But, is sue married?" was asked.
"Vps; I know she is. When she left

SKINS ON F9E 1
here with Mr. Treadwell last Tuesday for
San Jose she was bright and happy. She
was not to make a long atay, and Ire
member how she told me not to worry if
she was away lonter than I expected.
She said to me: 'Mamma, do not be as
tonished if I get married. It may come
very suddenly, and 1 will not atk your
consent.'"
"At first 1 did not line the way she
spoke, and I told her she must not take
such a serious step without my advice.
'She laughed, kissed me and said:
"Dearie, you would not object to my
bettering" my position?' Of course, I
agr ed with her then.
"I am so happy Minnie is married. I
heard oi it before, but I was not sure of it."
'Minnie, 1 ' she said in a Jovely and
motherly way, looking at the photograph
of a pretty brunette she held in her band,
"was a sweet child. Sue married J. J.
Welch, an architect, when she w^s but 17
years old. They did not agree, and when
after one year they found out it was better
to separate, she allowed him to get a di
vorcÂ« on the ground of desertion. She
could have obtained the decree, but you
see there were lots of little things she did
not care to bring up in court, and sne let
him have the divorce.
"Since then her former husband, who
is a lovely man in an ordinary way, has
been a constant visitor to our home.
"Minnie made the acquaintance of
Ivan Treadwell after her divorce and she
kept steady company with iiim until on a
viMt to San Josa she met his brother
James. The young couple learned to like
each other and now the whole thing has
resulted in marriage."
JIMMIE SAYS "NO."
Denies That He Has Married
Mrs. Welch or Any One
Else.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 10.â James Tread-
well when seen here to-night denied the

plated matrimony. He said he could not
have procured a Jicense to marry as he is
not yet or age. Trea'dwell said he had
heard the reuorts that he had been mar
ried to a girl from San Francisco, but he
laughed at them, thinking it was some
joke that was started by some one in San
Jose.
"I am entirely innocent," he said.
"I was up in San Francisco last Tues
day and i returned on Wednesday, but I
did not bring back with me any woman
named Mrs. Welch. I met her in San
Francisco, but I do not know much about
her. I never saw her mother. I suppose
she might be missing, and some of her
people think she came here with me, but
they are mistaken about that. As I said
before, I am entirely innocent so far as
having anything to do with bringing a
woman to San Jose is concerned or of get
ting married to anybody."
Geor -e Y. Bollinger, the guardian of
James Treadwe'.l, when seen this evening
said he knew nothing about the marriage
of his ward. He had procured no license,
as he was not of age and could not get a
license without tho consent of his guard
ian. Mr. Bollinger said he had not given
his consent to any marriage and never
heard of the woman.
RUSSIA AND FRANCE.
A Reason Why Member* of the Local
Russian Colony Left the Russian
Chuich.
The following is a translation of a letter
published in last Saturday's issue of the
Franco-Californien, the organ of the
French people of (his City:
On Russian Christmas. January 6, members
of the colony, in view of the cordiality now
existing between Russia and France, re
quested Archbishop Nichoias'not to chant, as
he had announced ne would, a Te Deum in
celebration oi the departure of Napoleon from
Moscow in 1812.
The prelate uot only refused to grant the re
quest but in an allocution declared that if the
Emperor Nicholas during his recent visit to
Paris went to visit the tomb of Napoleon at the
Hotel dcs Invilades, tnai had nothing to do
with religion.
Following this declaration, the persofis who
bad addressed the request to the Archbishop
left the Russian church when the first notes
of the Te Deum were intoned. G. Walder,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 1897.
CAME IN BY THE
ALLEY WIDOW
An Unwelcome Guest Who
Unobtrusively Entered
the Berkshire.
He Took as Much ay He Could
of the Weldon Family's
Property.
The Temporary Absence of the Family
Gavi Him the- Opportunity He
Wished For.
\ .
The Berkshire Hotel, 711 Jones street,
was visited by a burglar last Saturday
evening, and from the systematic man
ner in which he acquitted himself it is
evident the visitor was proficient in the
art of bis profession.
Roy L. Weldon and his wife left their
rooms shortly after 8 o'clock for a walk
downtown, leaving the gas lit and the
door unlocked. Their son was in the
building and about the hallway, which is
on the first floor of the hotel.
Shortly after they left some acquaint
ance of the young man called to see him
and invited him to take a walk. He con
sented and went into his parents' room
for his overcoat, which was hanging on
the rack. On his entry to the room he
lound the place dark. He thought noth
ing of that, however, but seized his coat
and departed.
At 9 o'clock Miss Weldon had occasion
to visit her parents' rooms, and on at
tempting to enter she found the door
locked. This circumntance aroused her
suspicion, so she sent one of the men
through an alleyway that separates the
hotel trom the adjoining house to cam
admittance through the window. The
servant found the window had been
raised. He entered and unlocked the
door, and as soon as the gas was lighted
the handiwork of the professional burglar
was apparent.
While Miss Weldon was straightening
out the confusion which the burglars had
left her paren.s returned. They found
that one tin box, in which there had been
kept bankbooks, deeds, insurance policies
and other papers of value, had disap
peared, as also Mr. WelcU>n's gold watch
and chain, valued at $150, and three
purses containing quite a sum of money
in the aggregate. Tne total he could not
positively say. A handsome gold neck
lace and other pieces of valuable jewelry
belonging to Mrs. Weldon and her daugh
ter had also disappeared.
An examination ot t ie premises showed
that the burslar had gone into the alley
way and had entered through the window.
It is supposed he was in the room at the
time the young man went in after his coat.
The theft was reported to the police, and
Officers Dillon ana Crockett were put on
the case. From the nature of the theft
and circumstances connected with it sus
picion points to the fact that the thief
knew vrliere the family kept their valu
ables and that he was acquainted with
their habits.

Mrs. A. Schuller, Who Says Matrimony Is a Failure. Two Years
Ago She Was a Single Woman and Worth $15,000. Now
She Is Married and Selling Violets for a, Living.
MRS, SCHULLER
AND HER VIOLETS
She Sells Flowers at the
Door of Her Husband's
Office.
He Deserted Her, She Says,
After All Her Money
Was Gone.
A New Way of Bringing a Man lo
the Point of Supportiif
His Wife.
"These are all that stand between me
and starvation on the street, for I have no j
other friends."
The sneaker was Mrs. Schull.er, the wife )
of Andrew Sclinller, real estate and in
surance ngent. 508 Montgomery street, who
lives in Oakland. The "these" referred
to were several bunches of violets on a
little stand at the corner of Post and
Kearny streets yesterday. Above the
blue blossoms was a large card, upon
which was printed her name, "Mrs. A.
Schuller."
The violet-seller is separated from her
husband, and she has brought suit against
him for maintenance, alleging that he was
worth fully $20,000, but had quietly placed
his property out of his bands and had re
fused to support ncr or give her one cent.
She also stated that when she married
Andrew Schuller in 1894 she was a widow
worth $15,000 in real estate and that,
through the manipulations of Schuller,
she is now penniless.
The complaint which she swore to and
filed against her husband was a long one
and ii told a plaintive tale of cruelty,
fraud and even an attempt to murder her
by btuouing her in the neck with a pocket
knife.
Schuller replied to the complaint that
he was without money or property and
was dependent on charity for his support.
After her unsuccessful attempt to get
something out of Scbuller she hit
upon a plan to earn a living and at the
same time remind her husoana of his ob
ligation.
She procured her stock of violets and
took her stand last Saturday on Montgom
ery street just opposite fcchuller's office.
She did well at her new venture because
many of her husband's customers were her
old friends and they bought violets as
they passed her. When Scnuller went out
to his lunch his wife was standing there
with her violets, and when he returned to
his ofhee she was still at her post.
"When Andrew Schuller married me
two years aeo," said she yesterday, "he
told me he was worth $50,000. 1 owned a
house at Oak and Lyons streets in this
City and I was quite independent. Now I
am destitute and Andrew Schuiler has
turned me out on the streets. I have
nothing between me and starvation but
these violets."
HER PAINFUL MISTAKE.
MUs Amelia Manning Applies Carbolic
Acid to Her Face Instead of
Glycerine and Roge Water.
Amelia Manning, a young woman, liv
ing at 771 Howard street, made a mistake
yesterday afternoon that will not only
cause her suffering, but will disfigure her
for months.
She was dressing to go to the matinee
at the Orpheum, and on her table were a
a bottle containing a mixture of glycerine
and rose water and one containing car
bolic acid. She took the wrong bottle and
wiped her face with the carbolic acid. She
screamed with pain, and a hack was sum
moned and she was taken to the Receiving
Hospital.
When she reached there her face was
swollen to almost twice its natural s^ze.
Dr. Bunnell. promptly applied a counter
irritant.
Dr. Bunnell said the carbolic acid must
have been diluted, otherwise the inflam
mation would have been much greater. It
will take months before her cheeks will
resume their natural color.
PENTECOSTAL CONVENTION.
Rev. A. Coplin Speaks of the Sanctifl-
cation of the I)inciples.
Rev. A. Coplin of Oakland conducted
the first of a series of Sunday services,
which be designates a Pentecostal conven
tion, at Christian Assembly Hall, 1237%
Market street, yesterday afternoon and

which is designed to last two weeks, is
stated to be >( to gather around the person
of the glorified Lord and through the
smdy ol the Word, teaching' prayer, testi
mony and song, to come into our full in

With the Hoiy Ghost."
LEARNING LORE OF
THE GREAT GUNS
Something That Gunners of
United States Army
Must Know.
Notes of the fchool of Instruc
tion for the Education
of the Soldier.
Two 0 fleers iiimironed to App?ai
Before the Examining Board
for Promotion.
Tse military posts were comparatively
deserted last Saturday afternoon, and it
was all on account of the ball game that
the boys of the Army and Navy team
played at the Central Park grounds with
me team of the University Club.
Yesterday there was a happy smile on
every face at the Presidio from that of the
stern-faced general down to the raw re
cruit, and all were pleased because the
boys Irom the post bad won, and that by
such great odds.
There is still a large force of men at
wort tilling in the marsh lands north of
the parade ground at the Presidio and the
earth mounds that were built and for many
years stood to the west of the grounds
are disappearing. When the whole place
has been rilled in and brought to the
proper level the space will be converted
into a parade ground, and will be the
i largest and best ground at any post in the
i United States for military maneuverings.
During the present month and the
j month of February there will be a school
I of instruction for the men who mount the
I guns that have been placed in position for
coast defense. During the days when
there is no intelement weather there will
be outdoor instruction, but in rainy
weather the instructions will be indoors,
all with a view to make the officers and
men thoroughly familiar with their duties.
The course ot instruction during these
j months will comprise:
Gymnastic drill; parade and foot drill; ar
tillery drill (with local armaments at the posts
where the butteries are stationed); Instruc
tion by detachments with a view to qualify ing
as many men as possible for the duties of gun
ners, and making all the members of the bat
teries familiar with the nomenclature and
uses of the more important implements and
instruments employed In connection with
their duties.
Such instruction will be given by commis
sioned officers, under the supervision of the
commanding officers, in the manner best cal
culated to bring iheir commands to a high
average of proficiency, aiming rather at mak
ing as many men as possible competent to
discharge the ordinary duties of gunners,
under modern conditions, than at qualifying a
necessarily small number in the more difficult
subjects which constitute a special course.
The following are embraced in the re
quirements for gunners, witb a view to
make them as proficient as possible, and
with the idea that every man who hns to
do with one of the guns shall know as
much as possible about it:
Nomenclature and use of azimuth instru
ments, transits, plotting boards, setting up,
leveling, adjusting, taking and reading ob
servations and plotting sirae.
Nomenclature and use of quadrants and
sights, principles of construction, adjustments
for range, drift, movement of target, and dif
ference ot level.
Nomenclature and weight of guns, carriages,
projectiles and powder charges.
Laying of guns and mortars on stationary
and moving objects.
Service of local armament.
Fuses and ammunition, nature, care and
preparation.
Tracking drill, estimating and determining
the speed of vessels.
Judging distances to stationary and moving
objects, and use of stop-watch in connection
with judging distances.
Memorizing distances to all prominent land
marks.
Range tables, Including graphic tables as far
as they can be practically applied and readily
understood.
Nomenclature and use of anemometer, ther
mometer, barometer and psychrometer.
Use of drawing instruments.
Jadgiag and* determining velocity of wind,
causes affecting flight of projeoiiles, espe
cially those due to the wind and to improper
loading and drift.
Nomenclature and use of electric batteries,
machines and primers.
Mounting, dismounting and moving guns,
mechanical machines, gins, gun-liLs, jacks
and craitles.
Tackles, falls and slings.
Cordage, knots, etc.
This instruction will be given in the fore
noons of at least four days of each week.
Four days in tne week, weather and
condition of ttie ground permitting, there
are drills in the morning at the Presidio
by four troops of cavalry and two batter es
of light artillery. Those who are early,
risers and take an interest in matters
military can witness some very fine
maneuvers.
Lieutenant R. B. Turner, Sixth Infan
try, and Lieutenant J. A. Maney, Fif
teenth Infantry, have been ordered to
appear before the examining board for
promotion.

cers or enlisted men, will be given.
From January 6 to May 4 is designated as

SAYS WE WERE EGYPTIANS
Dr. J. A. Anderson Says Some of Us
Are Doubtless Reincarnations of
the Ancient Egyptians.
Last night, at the Academy of Sciences,
Dr. J. A. Anderson delivered an address
to the Theosophical Society, taking for his
subject, "Memories of Past Lives." .
The memories referred to were those
which are the spirit* holding on to some
of the experiences of previous incarna
tions. Our physical being, he said, has its
traces of its passage through many stages
in different livesâ from the brutes up to
the most finely organized human being.
Much that we have of passion and cvii
propensity can be explained In this way.
Likewise each man's intellect is the
product of experiences; not merely from
the cradle of his present life, but reaching
far back when the same mind was in other
bodies.
Man's moral and spiritual natures have
been built up to their present excellence
or depravity through a long cycle of
struggle to improve or of yielding to base
ness when the soul inhabited other bodies
and was Known by other names in cen
turies gone by.
It is only thus that the strange memo
ries that come ao startlingly can be ac
counted for. This is the explanation of
how the "adepts" gain their wonderful
power. By a pure and highly spiritual
existence through many incarnations the
adept accumulates the knowledge ac
quired through centuries of varied experi
ence and laborious research. He does not
lose so much of his attainments in re
births as do the souls which are not adepts.
. After the address there were a number
of questions asked by members of the
society and answered by other members.
In replying to one of these Dr. Anderson
said that some or us living on earth now
were ancient Egyptians. In the long cycle
of experiences through which we all pass
our souls were doubtless incarnated cen
turies ago on the banks of the Nile.
