SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 28.â As time goes on the indignation of members cf
the Assembly increases more and 'more over the charge made by the Examiner that
there was not a shadow of a doubt that membersof the Senate and Assembly had been
bribed. The members of the lower house realize 0 that the Senators have been nit
harder than they. .. . . .Â° , \â. ' â¢'â â¢'" -â¢". â¢*;â¢.!:* ' ': ;
The Caminetti bill passed the upper bouse by a majority, while it" went through
the Assembly by a unanimous vote. They Â° say th-at the libel is a very clumsy, fake : .
and they *sk whether any one would imagine tnat Aivinza -Hay ward or his friend,
George W. Baker, would be foolish enough to buy a unanimous vote on a bill when a
bare majority would be sufficient. The fact that the vote ia the Assembly was
unanimous is of itseif, they say, the best proof of the falsity of the charge. * They say ;
also that if there is "not the shadow of a doubt" in the mind of the Examiner thÂ»t
legislators were bribed, the Examiner should have mentioned the names of the guilty
oni's and not have smeared wiih the vileness of the charge the innocent as well as the
suilty. This is what makes the libel more atrocious, and this is what may induce the
Legisla'ure to amend the libel law so as to embrace within its iron grip the new jour
nalisra which is inflicting new disgrace upon California. o . - = .'
Charges of bribery and iawbreakine, say some of the members, come with .very,
bad grace, indeed, from a newspaper which nearly eveiy. week violates the law by ad
vertising lotteries and lottery drawings, and'they say fnrther that this latest.calnmny
may b_- the incentive for bringing up the manager? of the Examiner with a round tuni"
on criminal charges. Caminetti, leader of the Democratic minority and author of
the bill, fumed and chafed all day. . He spent most of h:s time in t&e State library
consulting authorities as to the merits of.'his bill, and preparing data for the question
of privilege to which he intends to rise to-morrow mornine , He proposes to ask the
Governor to set a time at which he 'may .have 5 a hearing, and he will \ notify the I
X; aiiiirjT to be represented at the hewiaij'by : its attoi^iflys and Id Â»SwÂ»w cause, tf tHey I
can, why the-bill should be termed a bad one. ;He proposes" to'sh'bw that it is good !
law, that a litigant whose house and home and â¢ very means of livelihood may < be at
stake has a rignt to be tried before a Judge as unbiased as each one of the jarie3 is i
required to be. The law provides that the defendant in a criminal trial may be tried
before an unprejudiced Judge, but it makes no provision for equal protection in civil
cases.
'If every Judge in a civil casÂ»," added Caminetti, "had the decency to transfer the
matter to some other department of the Superior Court when he knew that he would
bÂ» unfitted to sit as a juror, there woulo. be no necessity for the bill which I presented,
but experience has shown that some Judges are not decent Referring to the charge
of brib-ry, I will say that I had so much confidence in the justice of the Dill that I did
not ask a member to vote for it, and it passed unanimously. It is charged also that
this bill was gotten up to fit the Hale & Norcross suit. That is not true. While it
may have application in that as well as other case?, f will say that there never yet was
a bill framed that couid not be said to fit some particular case. The Judiciary Com
mittee, composed of lawyers â men of learning and standing in the community â passed
upon the bill and declared that|it was a just one. Ido not wish to say anything more
about this slander. What I have to ada will be uttered on the floor of the House, and
before tne Governor in the presence of the Examiner's attorneys, if they send any."
The indignation of the Assembly will be louJly voiced to-morrow. Whether it
will go so far as to exclude from the floor the representatives of the copyrighted fake
journal remains to be seen. Even bets are being offered on tne outside that the legis
lators are in too much fear of the unscrupulous sheet to go that far. But to-morrow
will determine that fact.
FAKERS MUST ANSWER.
Legislators Will Appoint a Commis

Throwers to Talk.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. Before I
many days Long Green Lawrence, man- !
r.eing faker of the monarch of the fakers, j
will have to 1 divulge the author of the j
fake which attempted to cast a cloud on |
the reputations of members of the Legis
lature, or be will have to communicate
with his friends through the bars of a
prison ceil.
Despite its cowardly attempt to avoid
Ihe responsiDility of having aspersed the
i characters of irreproachable legislators,
lie members leel it a duty to take *uch
laction as will compel tbe Examiner to j
V-'bstantiate its charges of bribery or take j
ftie consequences, and the consequences
will neither benight nor uncertain.
Senator Morehouse, who was, the only
member of the Senate on Saturday who i
apparently had the quick perception to j
comprehend in their full enormity the
serious charges mude by the "new jour
nal" faker and the courage to hurl back
the falsehoods contained therein in the |
teeth of the traducsr, feels that the honor â 
not only of each member sought to be I

der it proper that this Senate should
institute an inquiry respecting the said
charges, and the evidence, if any, upon which
they are tinned, and the person or persons who
circulated, gave or reported the stntements, if
any, upon which the article was based and the
author, editor, printer, writer or person who
wrote or earned to be written or published or
caused to be publisned the said charges, and
all the facts connected therewith or relating
thereto, to the end that the guilt may be ex
posed and punished, whether it be found to be
oa the quality of legislative bribery and cor
ruption or willful and malicious public slan
der. Be it, therefore,
Rerolved. That a committee of three be forth
with appointed and tint said committee be,
and H is hereby authorized and empowered to
do any and all things necessary to make a
full and complete investigation of the matters
contained herein above enumerated, and to
that end to employ all necessary clerical as
sistance, and that said committee be, and It
hereby is, authorized and empowered to Bend
for persons and rmpers, and to take ail neces
sary means to procure the attendance of wlt
nessei and testimony; and the members of
said commi ttee are. aud each of them is, here
by authorized to Administer oaths; and that
all the provisions of article 8, chapter 2, title
1, part 3, of the Political Code of this State,
relative to the attendance ana examim'ion of
witnesses beiore the Legis ature and commit
tees thereof apply to the committee ap
pointed under this resolution; and that the
Sergeant-at-Arms of tbe Senate is hereby auth
orized and directed to serve any and all sub
pena* and orders or other process that may be
issued by the chairman of said committee,
when directed to do so by the said chairman.
This resolution will give the committee
appointed all the powers of a court, even
that of inflicting penalties and punishing
contempt of court. An important prece
dent to the present situation is furnished
int'iecase of D. 0. McCarty, printed in
the Twenty-ninth California Report.
He had charged the Legislature with
bribery in connection with the election of
a United States Senator. He was called
beiore a committee to testify as to who
had paid money or received money in
connection with that matter. He refused
to answer and was sentenced to imprison
ment and lodged in fail* He had a writ of
habeas corpus sworn out in his behalf,
but the Supreme Court held he could not
be released, as the Legislature is the
actual Buprenie Court oi the Btate and
nigher in authority than the regularly
constituted supreme tribunal of the State.
Aiter calling attention to this case,
Senator More ouse, in an interview refer
ring to the Examiner's article, said:
"Here is a charge that members of the
Legislature had been bribed to vote for
this measure and that iv the Assembly
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNLNG, MARCH 1, 1897.
The Great 25-Mile Handicap Bicycle Road-Race Held Over the
San Leandra Triangle Yesterday.
$150 was paid , for each vote and -in r the
Senate from $350 to- $500. The charge is
emphatic : Thousands' of dollars, it *Â»yÂ»,
have been corruptly r paidâ not may ' have
'been* paid or supposed to nave been paid.
Conseauently \ 'â* this Legislature ,. cannot
stand by and. foe thus cunrgad, wit:> felony,
for that is what the crime woul i be. And (
rhey further state 'Sort* *vod gorttfwmnn r
has been toiling diligently at the capitol
as a distributor of bribes. 1 Then it says j
â¢Without ft shadow of doubt members cf
the Assembly and .members of the Senate
were Lribed- to i-upport the bil,' and also
'Several thousand dollars changed hands.' j
"It will thus be seen that the charge
made is positive and certain, and no hon
est man in either branch of the Legisla
ture can afford to permit so serious a
matter to pass unheeded. If it be true
that any member of the Senate or any
member of the Assembly has taken a bribe
for the passage of this measure then the
Legislature owes it to the people of the
State that such member be exposed and
prosecuted and convicted of his crime,
whoever he may be."
"On the other hand, should it be untrue
it is equally the duty of tbe Legislature
to probe tbe matter to tbe bottom so that
it may be shown to the world that news
papers bava no ru'ht to traduce reputable
men by undertaking to break down their
standing and character in the community,
and lor that reason I intend to introduce
a resolution in the S nate to-morrow
morning calling for an investigation com
mittee with lull power to act, such com
mittee to have power to send for wit
nesses and examine and cross-examine
them to learn tbe truth concerning this
matter, and to punish witnesses for con
tempt for not giving testimony concern
ing the matter.
'Â°1 believe that the members of the Sen
ate are honest, and I do not believe that
any of them have taken a bribe, or have
been approached in a criminal way upon
this matter, or any other during this ses
sion of the Legislature, and I therefore
believe that the other members of the
Senate all feel that they owe it to them
selves â and I believe we all owe it to tbe
State â to conclusively establish the fact
that we are nonest men and htÂ»ve been
discharging a public duty honestly and
faithfnlly.
"If tbe Examiner is right then it ought
to have the credit of exposing bribery and
corruption, and if it is wrong then it
ought to be, for its course and policy in
this matter, condemned. I shall move
and liodo mat the chair appoint on the
committee members who voted in the neg
ative on tlii-* bill."
It is understood that Morehouse will
have the support of the whole Senate on
his resolution asking for an investigation,
for should any Senator refuse toco-oper
ate in the matter such action might place
him under tbe ban of suspicion.

What is the matter with Assembly Bill
No. 273, now in tLe bands of the Gorer
nor, about which such a storm is attempt
ed to be raised by the Examiner?
Is it possible that a Legislature could be
assembled in California who would have
to be bribed to support a measure so em
inently just as this? From the statement
in the paper referred to, it would *eem
that this was a piece of unprecedented
legislation in ihe interest of some partic
ular case, and this intimation has sug
gested to Thb Call the propriety of ex
amining the statutes of other titates in
order to determine whether the proposed
bill was in the line of existing laws in the
older States or a new departure peculiar to
Calilornia.
Without having time to pursue the in
quiry through all the States, we find the
act amply supported by the statutes of
many States, some of which are to be
found below.
The bill introduced by Mr. Caminetti
re-enacts the existing law and makes this
amendment:
"No Justice, Judge or Justice of 4 the
Peace shall alt or set as snch in any action
or prpceecttne: -';* */.'*,.* r^t ''?' % Z-'y'- ''â

Judge; ; ! in either of which cases said Jus;-'
tice or Judge shall fo thwith secure the
services of some otljer Justice or Judge of
the same or an adjoinina; county to pre-*
side at the trial of 'said action; provided
that in actions in the Superior Court of
counties or cities and counties having
more : than one department said actions
shall be transferred to another department
thereof and tried therein in the same
manner as though originally assigned to
such department." i -, , Â
The < Dde of; Alabama, volume I, section
2645, provides: "Either parly to a civil
suit may, al any time before the trial,
move the court to change the venue, mak
ing an affidavit that, for cause set forth,
he cannot have a iair and impartial trial
in the county where the suit is pending.
The court may direct a change to the
nearest county free from proper exception
by either party, to be determined by affi
davits."
The revised statutes of Maine, page 696.
section 14, provide: "Any Judge of the
Supreme Judicial Court, whiie holding Â»
nisi prius term, on motion of either party
sha.l, for cause shown, order the transfer
of any civil action or criminal case pend
ing in said court to the docket thereof in
any othÂ«;r county lor trial, preserving all
attachments."
Annotated statutes of Colorado, 1891,
section 2624 "a", provide: "When a party
applies for change of venue on account of
the prejudice, interest or relationship of
the Judge, or that tne Judge has been of
counsel for i ither party.it shall be com
petent for the Judge so challenged to set
down the cause for trial on a day fixed,
not exceeding, however, ten days from
the date of application, and he may there
upon call upon one of the other Judges to
try said cause."
Revised Laws of Wisconsin, Volume 11,
page 1497, provide:
"Whenever an application shall be made
in any civil or criminal action or proceed
ing in any Circuit Court for a change of
the place of trial on the ground that the
prejudice of the Judge of the court in
which said action or proceeding is then
triable, such Judge in his discretion may
retain such action or procefding in the
same court without entry of an order to
change the place of trial until the last day
of the then current term, if the applica
tion was made at a term at which the ac
tion or proceeding is triable, or the next
term if it is made in vacation, and in the
meantime shall call upon some other Cir
cuit Judee or Judges to attend and hold
court during such current or next term
for the purpose of trying ali such actions
or proceedings In which application for
change of place ot trial has been made on
account of the prejudice of the Circuit
Judge."
Revised Laws of Indiana, Volume I,
section 416, provide:
"The court in term or the Judge thereof
in vacation shall change the venue of any
civil action upon the application of either
party made upon affidavit showing one or
more of tue following causes: â¢â¢â¢>.Â«
"7. When either party shall make and
file an affidavit of the bias, prejudice or
interest of the Judge before whom said
cause is pending."
Genernl lows of Minnesota, 1895, chap
ter 3C6, provide: "Whenever in any
civil action pending in any D.strict Court
of the State, any party to the action shall,
not less than six days before the first day
of the term at which said action is noticed
for trial, make and file with the presiding
Judcre and serve upon the opposite party,
or his attorney, an affidavit stating that
on account of prejudice or bias of such
presiding Judge, he has good reason to
believe, and does believe, that he cannot

have a fair and impartial trial of said
action, said presiding Judge shall forth
with procure the services of some other
Juice oft c same or another district to
preside at the trial of said action, and
said action shall be continued on the cal
endar until some other Judze can be se
cured lo preside at said trial."
Revised statutes of Wyoming. 1887, sec
tion 3400, provide: "Whenever either
party to a civil action in any D strict
Court of the territory shall file an affidavit
in tho case, atating one or more of the
following cames: * * * Thirdâ That
tbe person making the affidavit believes
that on account of the bias or prejudice
or interest of the presiding Judge he can
not obtain a fair trial * * â¦ the Court
Judge shall change the venue in such
acion. etc."
Hill's "Annotated Laws of Oregon,
1892," volume 1, page 167, section 45, pro
vide: "The court or Judge thereof may
change the place of trial on motion of
either party to the action when it appears
from the affidavit of such party * * *
that the Judge or the inhabitants of the
county are so prejudiced against the party
making the affidavit that be cannot ex
pect an impartial trial before said Judge
or in said county, as the case may be."
Statutes of Nevada, 1895, page 64, pro
vide: "* * * When from any cause the
Judge is disqualified from acting in tbe
action, except in any case when it shall
appear by the affidavit of either party to
tno action that the said party Cannot, by
reason of the interest, bias or prejudice of
the Judge, have a fair and impartial trial,
in which case the Judge sn designated in
such affidavit shall not further preside in
the case, but instead of ordering a change
of the place of trial to another county may
invite another Judge to preside in, bear
and decide such case."
The foregoing quotations from the laws
of other States, to which many of a simi
lar import might be added, conclusively
establish the fact that the Assembly bill
now assailed is strictly in line both in
lorm and substance with tne provisions of
these statutes, and seem to have been
taken almost bodily from the statutes of
Minnesota.
And what substantial objection can be
reasonably urged against this law? It
simply provides that a suitor in our courts
shall not be compelled to have a man sit
in judgment upon him when be makes
oatb that on account of the bias or preju
dice of such Judge be cannot receive a
/air and impartial trial.
But it is said that the law might effect
the Hale & Norcross litigation and that
in the event that the case is again sent
.back from the Supreme Court for a new
trial it might be removed from Judge
Hebbard's court. Even if this were true,
that ia no reason why all the litigants in
the State should be denied the benefits of
a substantial right, because in a remote
contingency, in a given case, it might op
erate as a hardship, and we are by no
means convinced that the reasoning is
logical in the given case.
It is certainly not to be believed that
Judge Hebbard in the Hale it Norcross, or
any other suit, would desire to preside at
the trial if either party to it would make
oath that by reason cf his prejudice they
did not believe they could receive justice
at his hands. Indeed no self-respecting
Judge woula go on with a trial, realizing
that he was under suspicion of partiality
in favor of one of the contending parties.
The decisions of other States having
this statute show also that there lias been
no abuse of the privilege thus afforded,
and it is therefore made Apparent that the
Legislature by its enactment through the
House by a unanimous vote, and the Sen
ate by a fair ' majority, were actuated
wholly and simply by the same motive
that controlled its enactment in other
States, "namely," to promote the ends of
justice.
Read what section 833 of the Code of
Civil Procedure says:
The rourt may, at my time before the trial,
on motion change the place of trial in the fol
lowing cases:
1. When it appears to the satisfaction of the
Justice before whom the action is pending, by
affiduvitol cither party, that such Justice is a
material witness for either party.
2. When either party makes and flies an affi
davit that he believes that he cannot have a
fair and impartial trial before such Justice

r The fifth annual twenty-five mile handi
cap road race of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs was run yesterday morning
over wbat is known as the San Leandro
triangle and, in points of .entrants, acci
denis and time made, was the most re
markable event of its Kiud ever held by â¢
the association. .. .: â  -
There were originally 103 entrants, ol
which number eighty-three actually
started and forty of them; met with mis*'
haps whicn threw them out of the race,
leaving but forty-three to finish, yet
seventeen of these came in under the best
previous -record for the course, made by
Charles S. Wells last year, 1:10:30 2-5.
The best time j of yesterday's race waa
made by popular Tony Delmas of San Jose,
who covered the distance in 1:09:341-5.
The winner turned up in E. A. Bozio of
the Imper Cycling- Club of 'this City,
who had a time handicap of five minutes, j
and whose net time was 1:10:27. â¢T*' 1 '
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
is an organization which has beeu in ex
istence about tive years in this State, and
is made up of twenty of the most prom
inent cycling clubs hereabouts, including
nearly all the San Francisco olubs and
those ot Oakland,' Alameda, Santa -Rosa,
Facrameuto, Ban Jose 'and elsewhere. On
hingiÂ»B?* birtlidc^:;Â»l^iali r saj\* y
U<H6 the various clubs belonging to the as
sociation have run a joint road race | over
the San Leandro course, and -yesterday's
event was the â¢â  one V for 1897, -postponed
from last Monday owing to the poor con
dition of the roads at that time. Besides
this annual race the association conducts
a 100-mile relay race in April, a twenty
mile team race in July and a ten-mile
handicap in October every year,' and valu
able prizes are â¢ always hung up for the
winners. .
The course over which the men rode
yesterday was not in as good condition
this year as formerly, on account of the
recent heavy rains. T.e riders also h?d
a strong wind to contend with on one side
of the triangle, though it helped them a
little on another side. Fora twenty-rive
mile road race the San Leandro triangle
presents many advantages and is an ideal
one for me purpose. The start is made
on the Hay wards road about a quarter of
a mile to the northeast of San Leandro.
The riders here have the base of the tri
angle, which they follow toward Hay
wards, turning 10 the right before reach
ing that town, which gives the perpendic
ular and takes them past San Lorenzo,
when they turn west on to the county
road from San Jose, givin? the hypothe
nuse, which brings them back to the place
of starting. The total distance thus made
is eipht and one-third miles, and by mat
ing tbe circuit three times the required
twenty-five miles are competed, and the
spectators have seen the start of the race.

watched the riders pass them twice, ana

The race was advertised to begin at 10
a. m., and this necessitated an early start
from this side, so that from 7 o'clock to
9 and after the ferry-boats bound lor Oak
land were crowded with cyclists of ail
ages and conditions, and with all manner
of wheeis, from an old err ok to the new
1897 model. There were ladies without
number, but it was particularly notice
able that few of them ventured the
bloomer costume, it having become thor
oughly obsolete in the East and practi
cally out of date everywhere, being re
placd by skirts of scarce folds and cur
tailed lengths, which seemed far more
appropriate and uecoming. Of course, the
ladies will have to cive up riding the
diamond-framed men's wheels by reason
of this change in raiment, but then that
'"cuts no ice" with them.
On account of the early hour of the start
not many gathered to see the men sent eff
as compared to the Immense throng that
congregated about the time the finish was
expected. The road was lined with peo
ple for a quarter of a mile on either side
of the tape, pushing and struggling with
each other for a coign of vantage, and
many a swaying tree limb overhanging
the road bore its load of human freight,
consisting of the small boys of San L?an
dro and the younger wheeling element of
this City and Oakland. Ropes were
stretched on either side of the road, wound
around an occasional tree trunk, to keep
the crowd back so that the men would
have a clear road to finish in. Some
worthy tied an end of one of these ropes
to a lamppost, and when the men first
came in sight and the people began to
surge forward for a better view this poor
lamppost was iiteraily "torn up by the
roots,' a3 one man remarked, and fell,
shattered, by the wt-yside. The people,
released from their bondage, started to
crowd forward upon the road, but a dozen
sturdy marshals stood them off until the
men had passed and averted what might
have been a serious mix-up.
Prior to yesterday's race it was gener
ally conceded that the prizes for fastest
time would fall to the scratch men, and it
so turned out, but no one seemed to care
to try pick the winner of the race from
the hundred odd handicap men, thoueh
some few prophecies were offered which
the result completely upÂ«et.
It was 20 minutes past 10 o'clock when
Starter George H. Stratton gave the word
to the limit man to go. He bad a 10-min
ute handicap, and before the next bunch,
which was given 8 minutes' start, was
ready to leave,, he was out of sight. But
the handicapper knew his business, for
they overtook him before he got once
around the circle, and he gave up the
struggle. The first man started alone, but
after that they were sent away in
bunches, four with 8 minutes' handicap,
ten with 7;i, eleven with 7, thirteen with
6, and so on down to the seven scratch
rten, who got away at exactly 10:30. They
were: H. W. tquires, Acme; I. R. Lind,
Imperial; G. W. Tantau and J. E. Wine,
Olympic; Tony Delnias, Garden City; C.
A. Kraft, Bay City, and G. M. Hauiin,
San Francisco Club.
And now comes the chapter of accidents.
The road was rough in some places, sandy
in others, and what with the uneven and
uncertain surface many a good man went
down. Take for instance the t cratch
bunch of seven. Before they had gone
the first round Lind, who was up front
with Delrnas and Wing setting pace, slid
and fell. The two alongside of him
escaped, but all the others crashed into
him, and in an instant alt their chances
I for the race were pone, for Wing- and D<l
-mas never stopped and were soon out of
.sight, win c the others had contusions to
bandage and broken wheels to mend and
were in a sorry plight. They all patched
things up as best they could, remounted
and rode into San Leandro, sore in mind
and body. Some got otter wheels, re
mounted and continued on for a time, but
soon got discouraged and gave up the
hppeiess stern chase.
And there are others to tell about.
Games of Alameda fell, punctured his tire
and rode it in as flat as a pancake. L. H.
Smith, in whom the Olympics set great
store and expected much, sot into a mix
up and was considerably bruisad. Hcl
inore and Ramsay of the same ciub went
down together, remounted and finished
strong, little if any hurt. T. A. Schleuter,
an Acme man, suffered some bad bruises
in a fall, as did also Thiel and Robinson
of the San Francisco Road Club. Francis
of this club fell and broke his wheel, but
managed to make itdountil he gotaround
where he could get another, when he was
off like the wind again and managed to
ride into sixth place. If not delayed by
this accident he miehfc have got first
position. Williams of the California Club
wiil know he's been in a road race by the
soreness he will feel for the next few days,
and Anderson of the Imperials had to
have lour stitches taken in a jagged cut
in his back where somebody's pedal dug
into him in a general mix-up. The Estu
dlllo House at San Leandro was like an
emergency hospital alter the race, and
arnica, cotton batting and other measures
for the temporary relief of the injured
were in such demand that, the supply of
the local drugstores was nearly ex
hausted.
There was also another set of complain
ants about the hotel after the race, those
who had ridden and had accidents to their
wheels which forced them to give up,
whereas otherwise they would have won
the race beyond any manner of doubt.
There were a number of this sect, and
they told their woes to all who would
listen. Hard luck stories were as plenti
ful as bees in a hive, and the fact that
they had got off free of personal injuries
such as many others suffered never
seemed to occur to the story tellers.
The finish of the race was very exciting.
The various bunches had passed the
crowds at the tape twice and were about
due for the last time. The officials were
getting in readiness to take the times and
positions, and all necks were eageriy
craned down the road. "There they
come," shouted an eacle-eyed lookout
from a near-by treetop, and a few seconds
after a cloud of dustâ that was all that
could be seen at a distance â swung into
view. It was a big cloud, too, and tne
timers knew it was bringing them trouble.
Soon forms were discernible, and Bozio of
the Imperials was seen sightly in the lead
of Davidson, Bay City. There were just
twenty men in that crowd, and every one
of t. era Mashed past the ju iges within a
space of five seconds. Ho* they ever
ciught the times and positions is one of
the mysteries known only to such old
hands at the game as George Weiniore,
Herman Hadenfe:dt, Thto Dodge and the
<--then who were officiating, but get them
they did, and hH the others who passed,
for man after man came in quick succes
sion, until nearly forty had gone by.
It was the finish between the scratch
men that the people most wanted to see,
however, though tliey knew that only
Delmss and Wing were left, for the story
of the spill on the first Jap had oeen
brought in and told and retold up and
down the line a score of times. When
they <ame in sight Delmas was leading,
ana try as be would Wing could never
pass him, though bis defeat was only uy
a few inches. Wing bad had a bard day's
racing at Santa Roaa the day before and
was not as fresh as D -lmas, but as it was
the latter showed wonderful speed and re
ceivid quite an cvation later on when the
timers announced that he had made the
best lime and established a new coast
record for the race.
The riding of T. A. Griffiths and E. J.
Smith, who secured third and fourth time
prizes, John Davidson, who got secona
place, and H. C. Ramsay and E. A. Hel
more, who finished eleventh and twellth,
respectively, is worthy of special mention.
Delmas won a gold split-second Swiss
watch for his victory, and Bozio. who got
first place, also gets a gold watch. x There
are twenty-nine prizes in all, aud all of
considerable value.
The following table wili show the posi
tions at the finish, handicaps and net
riding time of each man:
The American record for twenty-five
miles was not lowered in the race, nor did
they come dangerously near it. It stands
at 51 mm. 55 sec. and was made by A. B.
McDonneli at Buffalo, N. V., October 19,
1895, over the Corfu course, which was as
level as a billiard- table compared with the
rocky road the men had tv travel over
yesterday.
The fastest times made in the four pre
vious similar events of the association
over this course were:
February 22, â George A. Faulkner,
Acme Club Wheelmen, 1 hour 19 mm. 4 fee.
February 22. 1894â Emil Ulbrecht, Bay City
Wheelmen, 1 hour 20 mm. 7 2-5 see.
March 8, 1895â Walter F Foster, Olympic
Club Wheelmen, 1 hour 12 mm. 55 4-5 sec.
February 22, 189Gâ Charles S. Wells, Bay
City Wheelmen, 1 hour 10 mm. 30 2-5 sec.
So it will be noticed that since 1894 the
record has been lowered every time the
race has been ridden.
The possession for the time being of the
Olympic tropiij'i which is to be competed
for in erery event of the association until
some club wins it three times, was decided
by the race, and it goes to the Imperial
Club, which made seven r>ointa t y Bozio
winning first place. The Bay City Wheel
men made- six. Garden City Cyclers five,
and Olympic and Acme clubs three each.

SENATE HOLDS A
SUNDAY SESSION
The Unusual Event Crowds
the Galleries With
Spectators.
Consideration of Sundry Civil
Appropriation Biil h
Resumed.
A Number of Important Amendments
Adopted and the Measure Is
Finally P. sscd.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 28.-An
open session of the United states Senate
on Sunday afternoon is sucb a remarkable
and unusual occasion, and so much at va
riance with the religious sentiment of
the country, that crowds were attracted
to the norta wing of the Capitoi an hour
before 3 o'clock this afternoon, the time to
which the Senate bad at 2:30 o'clock taken
an adjournment. All classes of people
were in the crowd. Some were early
enough to obtain seats in that sec
tion of the galleries that is open to the
general public. Others who were holders
of tickets to reserved section.* presented
them and were admitted so long as any
space was left. Those who could not get
inside stationed themselves near the gal
lery doors, waiting their chancea, or wan
dering listlessly up and down the marble
stairways and spacious hall*;.
As to the Senators themselves, the day
seemed to make no difference to them.
They were present in about the usual
number. A vote taken soon after the pro
ceedings began showed that there wore
neariy seventy Senators in the hall, some
of them teing paired. Nor was there any no
ticeable distinction as to the men represent
ing the New England States and the men
representing sections of the country where
Sabbath observance is not so general or
strict, and business went on Just as it does
on week days, except that there was a
noticeable absence of Cuban agitation.
It was strictly a business session, and
consideration of the suivlry civil appro
priation bill was immediately resumed,
the question being on those committee
amendments which were passed over with
out action last night. The first appropri
ated $1,085,156 to pay the producers of
sugar the balance of their claims for
bounty undor tne McKinley law. On
this Vest (D.) of Missouri demanded the
ayes and noes, and it was agreed to, 37
to 12.
The next amendments were those mak
ing appropriations for the great liver and
harbor improvement under contracts au
thorized by former river and harbor bills,
the various amounts being generally re
duced by the committee about 25 per cent
from the figures fixed by the House.
Eight or nine pages of these amend
ments were disposed of without inucli do
bate, but ttiose appropriating $100,000 to
prevent the Mississippi River from break
ing into the Cuche Riv^r near-Cairo, 11*,,
provoked an extended discussion, during
which the whole subject of the improve
ment of the Mississippi River was gone
over.
Gorman (U.) of Maryland opposed the
amendment io make ibis appropriation
outright instead of trom the amount for
the improvement of ihe upper Mi<sis
sippi. on the ground that it would make
this bill a river and harbor biil. He char
acterized the sundry evil bill as the most
extravagant ever considered by either
hou-te of Coneres", carrying as it did over
$51,000,000â 517,000,000 of which was for
rivers and harbors â which was more than
the condition of the treasury warranted.
And he warned Senators not to further
overload it with amendments, intimating
that if it were it would meet tue veto of
the President
The amendment was adopted.
An item in relation to electric lighting
in the District of Columbia, to which Hill i
(1). ) uf New York was opposed, gave that
Senator an opportunity (or exoressin<r his
views in regard to v Sunday session of the
8 nate He had doubled the propriety of
meeting to-day to enact legislation for the
people of the United States. His atten
tion had been called to various -petitions
io the honorable Senator* asking for a
"rest day" for the District of Columbia
and he hud been disposed to acquiesce in
the sentiment expressed in those petitions.
He also remembered that the S-nator
from Michigan (McMillan), who had sug
gested that amendment, bad introduced a
bill to "protect the first day cf the week,
commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest
and worsnip in the District of Columbia."
That bill, if it had passed, was broad
enough to prevent any legislation on this
day. For these roasons he hesitated to
engage in a general debate. "But now
to be serious," he continued â
"Have not you been serious all the
time?" a Senator asked in low tones.
"That is a reflection on the remarks 1
have made," Mr. Hill replied, and he
went on with his statement.
The amendment was adopted.
Pettigrew (Sil.) of South Dakota op
posed the item of $5000 for continuing the
communication to investigate the Alaska
seal fisheries. He thought, it would be
betier for the United States to kill every
seal which landed on the islands and so
end the controversy, unless Great Britain
would operate with this Government in
protecting the seal herds. The proposi
tion to treat further with England on
these lines was a new disgrace. He ridi
culed the numerous commissions and arbi
tration conventions which bad been con
vened, particularly that to determine the
141 st degree of longitude.
Perkins (R. ) of California supported the
amendment. To adopt the suggestion of
the Senator from South Dakota, he said,
wonld be to perform the dog-in-the
manger act and say to Great Britain that
rather than let you kill the seal animals
at sea we will kill them all ourselves when
they land for breeding purposes. He sug
gested as a remedy that all females
should be branded, as this would destroy
their fur value, which led Mr. Pettigrew
to ask whether it was thought that the
seals, before being speared outside the
limit, would come up to the boat of the
hunters to exhibit their brands.
Mor an (D. ) of Alabama said that as he
had been a member of the commission
whose award seemed to have caused the
trouble, be had always felt a delicacy in
discussine the subject. He reviewed the
history of the question from the time the
United States acquired Alaska, an act
which excited the anger and jealousy of
Great Bri am.
At the very moment we gained posses
sion the Canadian raiders were turned
into Bering Sea and in the rim year de
stroyed 400,000 seals. Y'-ar by year the
difficulty increased, until iinally it became
necessary to take some definite steps for
the final settlement of the question. At
that time there were two parties in the
United Statesâ one demanding that the
United States plant itself squarely on its
right to protect the seals and to defend
that right by force of arms if necessary,
while the business party, or peace party,
favored arbitration. This policy pre
vailed, and, as in every arbitration with
European Governments, the United States
lost its case.
So it always would be arbitrating with
European powers. If this country had
planted itself firmly on its rignts to seize
all vessels encaged in pelagic sealing and
had maintained that rizht there would be
xio vessels now disturbing our seal rights.
He could not look complaisantly upon
the amendment to brand the females or io
kill the seals and be therefore supported
tbe committee amendment. He hoped
the incoming administration would have
sufficient fortitude to demand that Great
Britain should faithfully perform her duty
in the premises as outlined by the Paris
tribunal and execute her part of the
award. The American Nation was always
seeking shelter from foreign difficulties,
but he for one did not want British pro
tection. The amendment wan adopted.
The f >llow.ng, among other new amend
ments, were adopted: For the appoint
ment of a board of three commissioners
to revise and codify thecriminal and penal
laws of the United States; directing the
expenditure of $75,000 of a former appro
priation for the purchase of a site for a
public building at Salt Lake City, Utah ;
apiointing a committee to select a site
in the city of Washington for a memorial
building, to be erected by the Daughters
of the American Revolution; restoring to
the pubhc domain and opening to settlo
ment the lands in Wyoming, Utah, Colo
rado, Montana, Washington, Idaho and
South Dakota (some 21,000,000 acres) set
apart as a forest reservation by executive
proclamation on February 22; establish
ing brunch hyrographic offices at Duluth,
SaultSte. Marie and Buffalo; appropriat
ing $4500 to purchase the State fish hatch
ery ai Battle Creek, CaJ. ; appropriating
$50,000 lor a public buiidinn at Butte,
Alont.
Chandler (R.)of New Hampshire offered
an amendment to create a permanent cen
sus bureau, bin It was ruled out on a point
of order.
In the Senate to-night in the discussion
of the amendment to me sundry civil bill
restoring to the public domain some 21,
--000,000 acre* as a foiest reservation, Mr.
Uark, who offered the amendment, said
that the order was issued on t c recom
mendation of a class of scientists who
think more of forest trees than of roof
trees and more of the life of a tree than
the life of a man.
The order meant that settlers on the
reservation could not cut a stick of fire
wood, and that the sold mines on one of
the reservations in South Dakota would
have to close down for lack of timber. He
was awÂ»ro that the insertion of this
umendment in the bill would probably
lead to its veto, bat he for one was ready
to meet the Pre ident on this ground.
T lm order would mean the retarding of
development in the West, and the subject
was of more vital interest to the land laws
of the States of the West than the Sena
tors oftbe East had any conception of.
Carter of Montana, who was Commis
sioner of the General Land Office during
President Harrison's administration, sup
ported the amendment.
As an example of t lie injury wrought by
the order, he mentioned the case of the
great Anaconda mine near Butte, Mont.,
which required a carload of timber every
dny to prop up the levels and galleries of
the mine and protect the lives of the min
ers, and the land from which all this lim
ber was cut must come, in part at lea-<t,
from one of the forest reservations. An
other case in point was ttaatof the old and
famous Homestead mine in South Da
kota.
No one who was interested in this mat
ter had been consulted prior to the pro
mulgation of this order, and he believed
that the Presideut would not bÂ«Mtate to
rescind the order yjhen he thoroughly un
derstood the true conditions.
Cannon (R. ) of Utah also supported the
amendment and declared that not one of
tbe fourteen Senators from the Western
States affected had been consulted re
giirding the order.
Lindsay inquired whether the adoption
of an amendment excepting domestic and
mining timber from the operation of the
order would be satisfactory.
Cannon said be would prefer to have
the order stand as it is rather than have
it temporized.
The amejicimeni was supported by Sen
ators i Stewart. (Sjlverj|bf Nevada, Petti
gfew (Silver) of poufb Dakota, Wilson
(R.) of ; "Wasiiington, Dubois (Silver) of
Ida o and Mantle (R.) ol Montana, the
latter asserting that in his State there
were thousands and thousands of acres
included in this order on which there
was not a stick of timber.; r-
The amendment was then unanimously
adopted.
The sundry civil bill was (then passed
and at 11:07 the Senate adjourned until
to-morrow at 11a. m.

in a Sliort Time.
Washington, D. c, Feb. 28â
List week of the Fifty-fifth session in the
Senate will be given up to consideration
of bills, as they are in a more backward
state than for years. Six of ' the annual
budgets have bcome laws with the 'ap
proval of the President. The Indian and
the postottice, the latter of which was
passed at an early hour this morning, are
in conference. There are now before the
Senate the fortifications, District of
Columbia, sundry civil and naval bills.
The sundry civil bill was under discussion
this afternoon. ' The. naval an i District of
Columbia biils promise to De prolific in
debate, so that the Senate will be com
pelled to give closer attention to its work
during the few remaining days than it has
up to this time. The general deficiency
bill will be reported: from the committee
to-morrow. .- r --
If the bill is prolonged, as some of the
members appear to be content to have it,
there will be good grounds for the belief
that two of the bills will fail of consider
ation. The House will do nothing for the
next three days except to act on confer

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 28.â The
Californians are congratulating them
selves to-night over their success in secur
ing three important amendments to the
sundry civil appropriation bIU in 'â â  the
Senate to-day. The first was the sugar
bounty appropriation. The second was

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 28.â
Shortly after the Senate met at 3 o'clock
to-d ay the sugar bounty amendment was
reached in the sundry civil appropriation
bill. Senator Vest, who opposed the
amendment, demanded a yea and nay vote
upon its adoption. As the opponents of
the amendment made no speech in oppo
sition to its adoption the friends oi the
amendment deemed it unwise to pre
cipitate a discussion upon it, especially rs
they had behind them the committee
recommendations, so a vote upon the
proposition was had withont debate and
the bounty amendment was adopted by
more than two-thirds of the Senate voting
thereon.

CALIFORNIA MEMBERS CONFER.
Discusses Federal Patronageâ Major Mc-
Laughlin Wants Nothingâ Chances
of Some of the Aspirants.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 28.âSena
tor Perkins and Representatives Loud,
Barham and Hilborn, the only California
members of the present Congress who will
be members of the next, held a conference
to-day to consider applications for ap
pointment to the various Federal posi
tions. They met at, 10 o'clock at the office
of Senator Perkins and remained in ses
sion until 2 o'clock.
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
the California State Central Committee,
was present The delegation was unani
mous in its desire to tender Major Mc-
Laughlin some good Federal appoint
ment. They believed that his services to
the party entitled him to recognition, and
he niix-ht have secured an indorsement
for a foreign m s ion or consular position,
or mint superintendent or collector of
customs or internal revenue; in fact, he
might have chosen his office and tbe Cali
fornians would have recommended him
for it, but Major McLaughlin firmly de
clined to be considered an applicant lor
any appointment.
"I do not want any reward for my ser
vices. Ido not want any office and will
not accept any," he declared.
The applications of Calitornians for ap
pointment to tbe Mint superiutendency,
Collector of Customs, Collector of Inter
nal Revenue, Marshal, Surveyor, etc.,
were then considered, but no conclusions
were reached.
The name of Frank Coombs for reap
pointment as Minister to Japan was then
canvassed. It is understood that Repre
sentative Loud was firmly of tbe opinion
that no one who bad formerly been in tbe
service of the Government should be re
appointed. Nevertheless, The Call cor
respondent was assured to-night that the
delegation would unite on Mr. Coombs
for appointment to the Japan mission,
which he formerly held.
It seems that William B. Hamilton does
not care to be Naval Officer to succeed
Colonel John P. Irish. Neither does he
appearjto desire the Mint superintendency,
marshalsiup, collectorship of customs nor
that of internal revenue. Mr. Hamilton will
be content with some subordinate posi
tion. He does not seem to want an office
in which he would have patronage to be
stow. It is certain, however, that he will
be recommended for some good place, and
his gooa men.i, Senator Perkins, will see
that he gels it.
Colonel John P. Irish will be allowed to
servo the remainder of nis term as Naval
Officerâ over a year yet. George W. Stone
of San Francisco, who is with Representa
tive Bowers at the Congressional Hotel,
wants to be Superintendent of the Mint.
Joe Spear, who is at the Shoreham, is
ambitious to be Collector of Customs.
Major Mclaughlin and Mr. Hamilton
are at Willard/s.
BRYAN WILL TRY AGAIN.

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 28. â The
visit of William J. Bryan to this city has
brought out that iiom the hour of his
nomination at Chicago he has been con
sidered the National leader of the Demo
cratic party and that there is a disposition
to regard him as such from now on until
the campaign of 1900. It is certain that
Bryan's friends control the National Com- i
mittee and that they cannot be unseated
until the next National convention of the
party names their successors.
Bryan, it was ascertained yesterday, has
become greatly interested in the pros
pective battle this fall for Mayor oi
Greater New York. He believes that if
this battle is fought on the lines of the
Chicago platform the Republicans can be
defeated in the canvuas.
Bryan's visit brought out also the inter
esting information that the Brooklyn
Democrats are exceedingly jealous of
Tammany Hall. It is said for ihe Brook
lyn Democrats that they will not be swal
lowed up by Tammany Hail in the matter
of a candidate for Mayor of Greater New
York, but that Tammany will be forced to
appoint a conference committee so tnat a
r.undidate agreeable to all shall be selected.
Tammany and the Brooklyn Democrats
will foi low their ancient custom in muni
cipal contests of indorsing the platform
of the parcy adopted at Hie last Na'ional
convention. Tammany has always done
this, and so has the Kings County
machine, and it wasascertmned that there
will be no departure from the rule and
that the candidate of tua two organiza
tions, after he has been agreed upon in
conference, will be presented to voters of
tbe Greater New York on the Chicago plat
form.

WHAT CONGRESS
HAS NOT DONE
Will Be Held Remarkable
for the Little It Has
Accomplished.
Record* Breaker in the Number
of B.lls and Resolutions
Introduced.
Passess Seven Hundred Private Pen
sion Bills anl Appropriates Over
a BU!i n Dollars.
WASHINGTON, D. 0., Feb. 28.-The
Fifty-fourth Congress which will expire
on Thursday at noon will be held remark
able principally for what it has failed to
accomplish. In one respectâ in the nnm
cer of bill? and resolutions introducedâ it
was a record-breaker. In the House alone
over 10.4U0 bills and 3100 resolutions were
introduced and referred to various com
mittees. Only a fraction of these passed
the House and fewer atiil became laws.
The principal business of the Congress,
aside from the passage of the appropria
tion bills, was limited to the first session,
the net results of which were the enact
ment into laws of the bills creating the
commission to determine the true divi
sional line between Venezuela and British
Guiana; prohibiting prize fighting in the
Territories; permitting appointments in
tiie army and navy of former United
States officers who served in the rebellion;
making one year's residence in a Territory
necessary to obtain a divorce; incorporat
ing the National Society of the Daughters
of the Revolution; denning the penalty
for interference with railway trains and
persons riding thereon, and substituting
salaries for fe*s to United States Marshals
and District Attorneys.
Aside from the foregoing measures the
remaining bills(excepting theimmigration
bill and the' joint resolution for an inter
national monetary conference, passed at
the second session) were of no general
interest. Included in these were 700 pri
vate pension bills, an unprecedented
number.
In another respect the Fifty-fourth Con
gress was remarkable. This was its fail
ure to pass a single bill providing for pub
lic builriines. The House calendar con
tained 100 bills of this class, including the
Senate bill for a custom-house in New
\ork City. Speaker Heed, however, in
his determination to reduce the expen
ditures to the lowest limit consistent with
the necessities of the Government, set his
face sternly against all legislation of this
character. Notwithstanding this circum
stance this Congress is the third in the
history of the country which has ex
pended a billion dollars. If, it is claimed,
these appropriations be deducted from the
sum total. twragÃregate for the past two
years would be little in excess of one bil
lon dollars.
A number of important measures which
where reported to the House iast session
arvd were expected to receive favorable
consideration during the present session
were either defeated or were left on the
calendar. The Dill to settle the indebted
ness of the bona-aided railways to the
Government, which was a legacy from the
last session, suffered a crushing defeat in
January last. The substitute measure
prepared by Harrison of Alabama to ad-
Just these claims through the medium of
a Cabinet commission was not permitted
by tin- Committee on Rules to come be
fore the House, the House leaving it an
open question between the supporters and
the opponents of the measure what its
fate would have been. In the preceding
session upward of fifty resolutions bearine
upon the Cuban insurrection were intro
duced, although but one passed the House.
Daring the present session the Cuban
resolutions introduced have been few in
number.
|No effort was made at the present ses
sion to call up the bill admitting Arizona
and New Mexico as States. The sound
money men were opposed to the admis
sion of any Territories that would send
representativeo to Congress favorable to
free silver.
Among the bills which passed the
House but have not been acted upon in
the Senate are the Morse bill to prevent
the selling of liquor in the Capitol; the
Brosius bill, permitting the establishment
of National banks with a capital of $20,000
in towns of $4000 inhabitants, and the
Loud bill to reclassify second-class mail
matter.
The Ways and Means Committee gave a
series of hearings during the early weeks
of the session and the remainder of the
time was occupied by the Republican
members in formulating a new tariff bill.
This will follow the general lines of the
McKinley law of 1890 and will be reported
to the House at the beginning of the extra
session of the next Congress.
All of the contested election cases,
thirty-one in number, have bÂ«eu dis
posed of.
Much of the time of the Senate has been
consumed in the discussions of questions
relating to our foreign relations, and
while no positive action of any kind has
been taken, many columns of the Con
gressional Record have been filled with
speeches on these topics.
Cuban resolutions have been introduced
and pressed for action by the score, bat
beyond precipitating debate, nothing has
been accomplished.
A treaty with Japan ha 3 been ratified,
putting into immediate operation the
clause of the treaty of commerce and navi
gation negotiated two years ago.
The general treaty 6f arbitration with
Great Britain, after being fruitlessly con
sidered for two weeks, went over until the
next Â«ession. The Alaska boundary treaty
witn Gr at Britain has not even been, con
sidered in committee.
The Nicnraguan canal bill, which was
debated for several weeks, was on the
point of final passage with a comfortable
minority in front of it when the protest of
a Minister representing the Greater Cen
tral American Repub ie was received.

C'AXEA, Crete, Feb. '28.â The presence '
of foreign warships" . ff this port has not
had the effect of preventing rightinc be- j
tween the insurgents and the Turks, save ;
in the town itself, where a comparatively I
sm:ill force of sailors and marines were re- !
cently landed for the purpose of preserv- 1
ing order. A skirmish occurred to-day at j
CROWN^PRINCE CONSTANTINE, in Whoss Favor King
George of Greece May Abdicate the Throne
Malaxa, a short distance from Canea, in
which the Turks were worsted, althouch
they outnumbered the Christians. The !
tenting at Malaga aroÂ«e from a fruitless
attempt on the part of the Moslems, aided.
b>- a detachment of Turkish troops, to re
v:cti:3l the blockhoaÂ«e where the Turkish
-srrison has been blockaded for a number
i:' days. The Moslems made a sortie, bat
the insurgents were prepared far just such
a move ami attacked the party furiously,
finally driving them back. During the
tizhtinf; a heavy lire was directed upon the
Christians from the Turkish arsenal in
Canea. It had. however, very little effect,
snd she Christians still maintain the po- j
si ions held by them prior to the fight.
Further fighting has occurred in the
vicinity of Heraklion. As heretofore, the j
insurgents under Korkuras repulsed the j
Tor tee.
A Turkish warship in Suda Bay to-day
began the bombardment of a position oc
cupied by insurgents, but before she had i
done much firing her commander received
word from the representatives of the
foreign powers that he muse silence his j
puns or take the consequences. This is j
the ?econd time that the insurgents near |
Bnda Bay have been fired upon by a Turk- j
ish warship.
Tne Graft* Korahas, who at the head of j
r>ooo insureents has invested the town of j
UerakiiOQ, has given permission to the j
Turks to leave the place in order that they |
ma/ cultivate the lands adjacent tc the j
town. His action, however, is looked i
upon with suspicion by many Moslems, j
they believing that it is his intention to
benefit from the labors of the Turks by !
.-ejzing their crops when they are ripe. j
On the other band those who are ac- i
quainted with the character of Korahas
declare that he is a just and humane man,
and that his only object in permitting the
Turks to till the fields is to prevent suffer
ing from famine among the women and
children in the belcaguere i town.
Sevaral British und. ltalian oliicera re
cently visited the camp of Kjrahas, whera
they were treated with much courtesy.
They were astonished D 7 the excellent
discipline maintained amone the insur-

ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 28.â A number
of Cretan deputies, needed by the Bishop
of Ketimo. visiieu King George to-day
and presented :o him a memorial which
in effect declared th.it the establishment
of autonomous government in Crete would
not result in the pacification of the island.
Such a form of Government would only
p epaio tne way to fresh revolution and
endnnzor the peacÂ« of JEurope. The C re- I
tans, therefore, had irmly decided not :o
accept autonomy, but to continue their
struggle to realize union with Greece, |
which, the memorial added, even the j
Mussulmans were beginning to agree we a |
the only practical solution of tne situa
tion. %

CAXEA, Crete, Feb. 2S.â A new danger
threatens this unfonuviate inland, and if
)m is 10 be averted a speedy settlement of
I ii present d (Realties must be arrived at
'Every day the situation is becoming more
desperate, owing to the fact that tnrouch
o:;t the island the state of war prevents
any attention being paid to th' crops.
The towns which are besieced by the in
surgents are in a much worie condition
than thus- m the country districts.
In Heraklion alone, where there has
oeen a very la vat? Influx of refugees, the
outlook is very serious. There is now in
the town, counting the regular Moslem
population and the refugees, fully 25,003
persons.
Provisions are very scarce and a famine
Is imminent. Large numbers of the refu
gees are already dying from starvation,
and it was the knowledge of this fact that
led Koraha% the Greek leader, to issue vis
order to permit tne cultivation of fields
near the town. The lines of the besiegers
are absolutely impassable, as has been
proved by the faiiure of several sorties
thnt nave been made. The officials in the
town h tve telegraphed to Canea implor
ing the assistance of foreign warships in
raising the siege, but it is no* considered
likely that their supplication will receive
a favorable response, though provisions
may be sent to the starving. Korahns has
not yet cut off the water supply. Should
he carry this threat into execution the
condition of the besieged people would be
pitiable in tl>6 extreme.
Korahas, with part of his forces, is ad
vancing upon Hierapetra. He will pass
through the turbulent district of Lasithi,
and the populace there is certain to join
him. It is pretty certain that the garri
son at Hierapetra will have to capitulate
when the insurgents reach there unless
the foreign warships help the Turks.
O:\ March 3 the armistice of a week
aereed to between the Moslems and Chris
tians at Selino will expire. The position
of the Moslems there is very precarious.
The insurgents are so incense 1 over the
bombardment of Akrotiri that it is con
sidered doubtful whether they will listen
to the persuasion of Colonel Vassos, the
commaDder of the Greek army of occupa-
tion, who has promised to use his influ
ence to obtain tne release of the besieged
Moslems.
It has been learned that the righting at
Maiaxa resulted in the killing of eight
Turks and the woundins of many others.
The Christian losses, if any, are unknown.
The engagement caused the most intanse
excitement here, and prompted incen
diarism in the vicinity of .the town. Two
villages and several isolated houses were
destroyed.

German* Act in thn t retnn Irouble With
I hat f'irtc.
BERLIN, 'Germany, Feb. 28.â Whatever
may be thought or said outside of Ger
many as to the Kaiser's line of action in
I the Grreco-Cre an imbroglio, the dom
inant, if not the unanimous, opinion in
Germany i* that it has been consistent
with his whole eastern policy, and in
j spired by a desire to maintain peace. The
home papers which insinuate and the for
: eign papers which openly affirm that fam
| ily affairs have been any element in infill
; encing the Kaiser choose to ignore facts
j which ought by this time to be open to
j the world. There is no feud or ill-will
I now existing between the Kaiser and his
I sister, the Duchess of Sparta, wife of the
i Greek heir apparent. The unconcealed
; disfavor with which he treated herconver
j sion from the Lutheran to the Greek
I church is a matter of past history. The
! Emperor's mother wa? the medium of
; early reconciliation, and the harmony of
affection between the Kaiser and his
' favorite sister has long been restored.
! That the Kaiser sought, first of all, the
. support 01 Russia for his proposal to
blockade the Pirrcus should dispose of the
! report that family considerations weighed
! largely with the Czar.
The Kaiser can be expected to Know
1 how far the fact that King George is
j brother of the Dowager I zarina would af
j feet Russian policy. Tne history of our
â¢â  own time aff orris an illustration. When
! Prussia in JSCG despoiled tne Grand Duke
of Hesse-Darmstadt, brother of t!ie then
Czarina, the Czar, Alexander 11, declined
; to interfere privately or through diplo
, tnacy, and whea Prussia annexed Hol
| stein-Gottorp, lone associated with the
Russian dynasty, nothing was said from
St. Petersburg.
That the Dowager Czarina has perso'n
-1 ally interfered on bjehalfof King George
is beyond all probability. The telegram
of encouragement and sympathy from her
to the King w.hich has gone the rounds of
the European presi was a fabrication, and
events since have proved that Czar end
Kaiser alike are guided by motives in
which family relations plsy no important
part. The actual truth, so far as the
Kaiser has taken any lead upon the
Cretan difficulty, is that his arm has been
to prevent or at all hazards to postpone
the breaking up of Turkey aud to stop
Greece from entering upon a war which,
j unless accompanied by a general confla
gration in the Balkan peninsula, miÂ»ht
involve the devastation of Greece and the
I overthrow of King Goorge.
The Kaiser has been in consultation
with German oilicers who have served in
the reorganization of. tie Turkish army
and has obtained during the present crisis
reports from the German staff still con
nected with the Turkish forces. Their re
ports concur in stating that the position
of Greece, if assafled by land, is abso
lutely hopeless. The Turks are immeas
urably better prepared for an immediate
campaign on the Tilessalian frontier.
' The Porte seems to have anticipated a
possible outbreak of war with Greece and
got ready for it. Early in the month they
bad 20.000 troops around the base of Olym
pus and were prepared to direct that force
in two columns from the Olympus and
Elassona district!, upon Thessaiia. The
Turkish army is reinforced 10 45,000.
Against them the Greeks nave but a feeble
force between Larissaand Pbaralessa, and

ering to throw up some works around
Larissa which had long been projected
but persistently neglected. These Turk
ish frontier troops are well equipped with
artillery, the infantry are armed with the
Peabody- Martini rifle, ana they are well
led and, altogether, in good trim.
According to the opinion of the
German officers best able to calculate the
course of events the Turkish force by it
self would suffice to overrun the Greek
mainland. O; course a prolonged war. in
which the powers would stand aloof and
let Turkey once more conquer Greece, is
not to be thought of. The total war
strength of Greece would count for some
thin? only if Turkey had simultaneously
to suppress insurrection in Macedonia and
to meet in the field the combined forces of
6eiVia, Bulgaria and Montenegro. Even
then, if none of the powers intervened, the
military opinions here quoted believe that
the Turks ivoul 1 hold their own. The
combined strength of Greece and the
awful consequence of cuaining the tre
mendous forces of war and rapine in
Turkey were undoubtedly the weightiest
questions with the Kaiser.
King George may yet have to thnnk
German policy for the safety of himself
ami his Kingdom. In the Graeco-Cretan
negotiation?, proceeding at Stamboul laÂ«t
week, Baron Saurma yon Jeltsch has
taken no obtrusive pare.
The Sultan has sometimes been in direct
communication by wire with the Kaiser
and has consulted Baron Saurma, it is
said, on every important development.
The entente betweeu the Kaiser and the
Sultan, however, as far as it extends, has
has r.o element of hostility 10 Greece. The
Berlin Government supports the powers
in any Foluiion that will avert 'general
war. The creation of an autonomous Crete,
under a Greek prince wi>h the Suitan as
suzerain or with the Prince Mavrocor
datos as Governor, has had backing from
German diplomacy- It ought, however,
to be frankly stated that the union of the
island to Greece has not the entire ap
proval of Germany. It is feared and be
lieved that Crete, under Greek rule, would
continue to be the Beat of chronic insur
rection and disorder.
IN A DEN OF HORRORS.
A/most Incredib'e Story of Her Treatment
in L Ã¼ban Prisons fs Told by
Mrs. Rodriguez.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 23.â Last night's
steamer brought to this city another vic
tim of Spanish brutality, Mrs. Eva Adan
j Rodriguez, who, together with Conc-'P
cion Agramonte de Sanchez, Ga
briel de Vron, Maria A uilar and
Augu M. Silva, rJI of the finest families
on the island of Cuba, were arrested on
January 10 last and thrown into a dirty,
damp Spanish prison, among a lot of low,
abandoned women, witboui the slightest
charge having been preferred against
them. They were kept for twenty days
in a state of "incommunicado" when
they were marcheJ through the streets
with a number of criminals, some of
wnom were in chains, surrounded by an
armed guard to the depot and placed on
; a train bcund to Xuevitas and from there
to Hanava by steamer.
On the train they were confined in a car
filled with men, and were not allowed any
: conveniences, but instead they were al-
I lowed to pay for a few comforts. They
I arrived at Havana on February 4 last.
I Her case was called to the attention of
â  Consul-General I^ee, who .immediately
i communicated witu the acting Captain-
I General, Marquis Auuniada, and de
! mandea her release.
On arrivine at Havana she was taken to
the public j til and then to the House of
Refuge, a place set aside forlallen women.
This place was filled with women afflicted
with lo.ithsome diseases and -locked with
lice. Even the officials advised Mrs. Rcd
riguez to be careful and not come in con
tact with these poor wretches.
She was detained iv this den of horrors
for tiiirty-two hours, wuen she was re
leased on condition that she would not re
main in Havana. Immediately on her re
lease she sent for her two little daughters,
who had been left at Puerto Principe, and
! on their arrivat at Havana Mrs. Rod
' riguez requested Consul-Generai Leo 10 se
! cure her a passport from the Captain
j General. She is profuse in her thanks to
; General Lee for the aid he rendered her.
Her husband i<Â» now in command of the
insurgents in Havana province in the
place ol General Aguirre. The Insur
gents, she says, are about to concentrate
their forces in and around Havana. The
report of cane grinding on different
estates she declares are absolutely false.
An attempt was .made to grind on tlie
Calyo estate last week, but tne insurgents
burned them out.
SAXOUJLLT I-H.nsl.s ZEE.
Speaks of Him a* "a fJignifled, Jirave,
Xoble Anieriotl." â 
NEW YORK, N. V., March Iâ A dis
patcli to the Sun from Havana says: Be
fore General banguilly left for Key \Ve<t
Saturday, accompanied by his wife, his
son and bis adopted daughter, he ex
pressed himself to lriends on some phases
of caÂ«e.
lie said that the. news of his release
greatly surprised him. He was despond
ent as to the success of the diplomatic
efforts of Consul-Generai Lee and friends
in Washington to secure his liberty, and
was prepared to receive bad news about
his appeal to the Supreme Court at Mad
rid. Of Consul-Generai Lee Sanguilly
spoke in the Inchest praise.
"Up is a dignified, brave, noble Ameri
can. His efforts in behalf of the Ameri
cans in Cuba are beyond all praise. In
my case General Lee, from the time of his
landing in Cubit, showed the grea;est in
terest, and I am obliged to hint for his
personal kindness and his constant desire
to better my situation."
All the efforts of Sanpruilly's wife to ob
tain from General \Ve\ ler permission to
let Sanguilly have a walk of half un hour
daily in the fresh air while guarded by
soldiers was useless. She applied
os a last resource to Consul-Gen
eral Lee and General Lee called
on General Weyler, telling him that
Sanguitiy's health wes in danger by
reason of the unhealthfuines* of his posi
tion. Other prisoners, confined there for
non-political cause?, enjoy the privilege of
so breathing the fresh air.
Weyler net' oniy refuted the favcr to
Sanguilly, but he did still more. General
I^ee himself was deprived by order of the
captain-general of the right of entering
the cell of Sanguilly when he called at the
fortress.
The American Consul could not see the
American citizen except at a distance of
eieht paces through the grated window of
Sanguillv's dungeon nnd in the presence
of four armed soldiers who had instruc
tions o fire on either one of them at the
least suspicious. movement.
The condition of the Cuban prisoner* in
the forire s of IÂ»* Cabana Sanguilly de
scribed as horrible. His former coun -el,
Miguel Viondi, arrested under no evidenc
at aU, is confined in a dirty cell with
twenty more. They cannot go out a mia
uto to take the fresh air..

An Internat.onal Congress on Legis

â  '
BERLIN, GEE.MANY.Feb. 28â An inter
national conuress on legislation for the
working classes meets here in September
next. The programme for discussion as
now prepared has specific reference to
German- legislation, but includes also
questions relating to the workers of other
countries. . The congress will consider
first what useful changes in legislation to
the workers have occurred in each ; coun
try since the congress convened in Berlin
in IS9O, on tho initiative of the Kaiser.
Then follow general questions: "Ought
workmen to be submitted to a protective
regime, and how far is protection bene
ficial?" "Are international protective
measures for workmen beneficial?" "Are
intercational protective measures for
workmen possible and desirable?"
"Ought international bureaus for the col
lection and distribution of trades statistics
be established?" /",;
These, besides matters relating to pro
tection of miners, the duties of inspectors
of mines and factories and other cognate
subjects, will be considered.
The Berlin Fecht Club, under the presi
dency of United States Consul-General De
Kay, is forming a German Fechterbund
on lines simiiar to the fencing union or
eanized by De Kay in America some years
ago. The tirjt meeting of the bund will
be held on the 6th of March in thÂ» hall of
the Berlin Fecht C.'ub. Mr. DÂ« Kay will
deliver the opening aadress. Ofl the even

An American diplomat just returned
from Vienna speaks in glowine terms of
the '"Weisse Kreuse" ball which is the
culminating event of the Vienna season.
Tho costume-, he says, beat those dis
played at the Berlin imperial court, and,
of course, in Austrian opinion the historic
luster of the names of the wearers of these
cosily costumes outvies by many centuries
those met with in Berlin society. Countess
Goiuchowski wore aduche*se robe, small
corsage, draped with lace, trimmed with
black violets. Countess Budeni wore a
heavy while brocade robe, tne corsage cov
ered with diamonds and trimmed with
white roses. Baroness yon Biliuska was
atlired in a white moire broc.ide robe,
mousselino frills, trimmed with black vio
let?. Countess Aroni wore a white brocade
robe and corsage in violet?. The Princess
Schwarzenbere, ihe Princess Pallavicini,
the Countess Esterhazy, Countess Fugger
and Countess Kielniansegg rivaled each
other in the display of diamonds. Countess
Kielmanseeg woÂ« a 4 *3iamond corsage,
trimmed with while paradi.-e birds. Tlie
Baroness Etisen was distinguished in a
light green ducbesse robe, with a low cor
sage, consisting mostly of a branch of
white roses drawn over the shouider to
the point of the taille iront and back.
Sporting circles are still deepl}' con
cerned in the question: What is to be
done with the mare Lillie KneebeÂ«, alias
Bethel, which was confiscated by tlie
Prussian State after the arrest ot Bob
Kneebes, ths American trotting-horse
owner, on charges of "ringing. 11 and was
condemned to bo sold to cover the ex
penses of Kneebss' prosecution. A pro
test tias now been lodged by Kneebes' son
in-law against the enforce i saie of tne
mare by auction, his plea being that he is
the real owner of Bethel and that the
mare must be given up 10 him if the court
holds that it i 3 really Bethel which the
authorities have in their possession. The
question will be fought out in the Berlin
Civil Court. In the meantime Kneebes is
â  confined in the Ploetzensee prison and it
is generally hoped that he will De one of
the number who will be benefited by the
amnesty wnich vÂ» ill be granted to certain
prisoners upon the occasion of the cen
tenary of Emperor William I on March 22.
The German committees in St. Louis
Chicago and other cities in the United'
States have s>nt orders to Berlin to have
wrea'hs placed upon the monument to the
tirat Emperor William upon the occasion
of tne commemoration of the celebration
of tne hundredth anniversary of ins birth.
The American colony In Berlin are still
discussing the reception given by United
States Kmbassador Uhl and Mrs. Uhl on
Washing oil's birthday. The function
was a veritable crush, the guests some
times so completely tilling the spacious
hall forming the entrance to the Etnbassa
dor's residence tuat movement was im
possible, yet everything was conducted in
perfect order and without a single hitca.
At ihe banquet, which was held in the
Kaiserhof Hotel subsequent to the recep
tion, Mr. Uhi's spetcu in reply to the
toast to the memory of Washington was
repeatedly cheerfd, and the addie^s de
livered by J. Monagban, United States
Consul at Chemnitz, in which he touched
upon the An^lo- American arbitration
treaty, was frequently applauded.
Count Posauowsky-Wehner, Imperial
Minister of the Treasury, has ca.led a
meeting of persons interested in flour anil
grain nulling throughout Germany to dis
cuss tne troubles connected with the cus
toms treatment of grains and flour. This
steo seems to bo the beginning of an in
quiry preliminary to the revision of the
commercial treaties recently announced in
the Kcichstng.
Tne Foreign Office received a telegram
last evening irom Lord Salisbury <ouvey
ing the purport of the ultimatum to
Greece, which has been postponed by the
powers, and will be presented by them
jointly to the Hellenic Government. The
text of the agreement shows That a modi
fication of the proposals made by Russia
toproceed at once upon the application of
rigid coercive measures against Greece
nave te?n modified.
The Berlin ana Frankfort bourses closed
strong in tone yesterday. Home teciiri
ties and Austrian bank shares showed a
substantial advance for me week.
The convention between Rus-ia and
Japan, tne purpose of whicn is ja*t made
puolic, is ascertained to nave been signed
in Moscow by the late Prince Lobanoff,
Russian Minister of Fo eign Affairs, aim
Field Marshal Yamagata, the Jupanese
Envoy, upon ihe occasion of the latter's
visit to Russia la-t June as the repre
seniai.ve of the Emperor of Japan at the
ceremonies attending the coronation of
the (Jzar. The tenor of the agreement has
been known to the German Govern men!,
for a long time, and it is nrobabio that it
was also known to the British Govern
ment. The treaty is clearly a slap in the
face of England, which power Japan will
oppos-e ii Great Britain suould attempt to
siize Port Hamilton. By the lerrus of ihe
convention Japan retains cont/ol of th
telegraph lines in Korea with the excep
tion of the line which the Rnsjinn Gov
ernment is to construct to Seoul Tne
publication of the provisions of th" con
vention is associated with the prcjectPd
Korean loan, whica will ba gained by
Russia and Japan.
The costume festival which was given
at the Schloss last evening, surpassed in
grandeur any function of the kind ever
held in Berlin and exceeded in magni
ficence the most extravagant expectations.
The German binietallist leaders assert
that United States Senator Wolcott, who
recently visited Europe in the interest of
bimetallism, obtained an understanding
with France that that Government would
take part in an international monetary
conference. It is understood here that
Mr. Wolcott's negotiations with the British
officials in London concerned tne re
opening of the Indian mints, the holding
in the Bank of England issue department
the full amount of silver authorized by the
bank act and the raising of the legal ten
der standard of silver to Â£10.
A dispatch from Moscow says that the

Many Distinguished Persons Arrive to
Witness the Inauguration, but the
Rush /s Yet to Com 3.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 28.â The
inaugural crowds have not begun to ar
rive yet owing, it is explained, to the lim
iied time allowed by the railroads on ex
cursion tickets, and except for the sug
gestiveness of the holiday appearance
given the town by the decorations on pub
lic buildings, business houses, hotels and
residences and the reviewing stands there
is little to indicate that the Nation's great
quadrennial event is at hand. Around
some of the hotels, however, tnere is a
bustle tnat tells of the coming ceremonies.

CA.NTON, Ohio, Ffib. 2?.â Major Mc-
Kinley's last Sunday at his Canton home
before setting out for Washington to bs
inaugurated President of the United
States was marked by no unusual hap
penings. He wenc to the Methodist
Church, of which he was a member since
he was 17 years old. Major McKinley
drove to the church, and was accompanied
by Captain Hoestan and George E. Morse
of San Francisco. Snow was faliing rap
idly and almost obscured the Major's
figure as he walKed from ihe carriage to
the church.
Major McKinley joined with apparent
relish in the singing of the opening hymn,
"Jesus Reigns." Dr. C. E. Manchester,
the pastor, who was a member of Major
McKiniey's regiment during the war, said
In his prayer:
O Lord, bless our Nation; grant that pence
ana righteousness may prevail. We pray thee
that thy blessing may'b,- on the President ot
the United States In the closing days of his eil
rnimstratiou and that nothing may be uone
displeasing to thee. Let thy blessing rest
vi on thy servant who hns beeu chosen' to be
the chief executive of tins Nation. We pray
thee to go with him ;l give him moref aitii
in thee; may he be sustained by the prayers of
thy people, that he may carry out thy will.
We pray thee to manifest thyself to him and
to all of us.
Dr. Manchester found his text in the
third verse of the twenty-first chapter of
St. Matthew, "The Lord hath need." His
tneme was the higher life. In speaking of
home training he paid in a delicate, indi
recf way a beautiful tribute to Mother
McKinley. Li conclusion Dr. Manchester
said:
"llow shall wn preserve the peace of
nations? What are we to do for this great
iand of ours? There is one thought In all
our minds this morning as our dear
brother and friend goes out to take up the
duties that lie before him: Our prayers
that he do aright the great work set before
him."
B. F. McKinley of San Francisco, an
nncle of the President-elect, arrived in
Canton to-day. He will accompany the
Presidential party :o Washington.
All preparations forle!>vinÂ« Canton have
been made at the McKinley home. Mr.
and Mrs. Lafayette Williams ot Chicago,
who are to share the private car occupied
I by Mujor and Mrs. McKiniey, will arrive
I here to-morrow.
The Presidential train will consist of
1 seven car?, a combination baggage and
smoking car, a handsome new Pullman
for the newspaper correspondent", two
Pullmans, a private car for Mother Mc-
Kinley and her party and a second private
cur, which will be the last car on the train
j and will be occupied by the President
elect. The train will be preceded by one
bearinp tt;e Cleveland Troop, which is go
ing to do escort duty. There will be about
sixty-rive persons on Major McKinlev's
special train, most o; them beinpreiatives
or close friends of the Prosident-eiect.
The train conveying the President-elect
will leave Canton al 7 o'clock Monday
night and it is scheduled to arrive in
Washineton at llo'clock Tuesday. It will
no; be run at a hish rate of speed on ac
count of Major MoKi.iiey's venerable
mother and other ladies who will be pas
sengers on it. Safety and comfort will be
the end sought rainer than swiftnes?.
Major McKinley will probably say a few
j words of farewell to his friends and
I neigiibors before the train leaves Canton.
!â  He is to be escorted to tde train by several
] thousand Canton people ami the streeis
j alone the line of march will be brilliantly
! illumina'.ed.
Major und Mrs. McKinl^y took a drive
this afternoon. Thy are both in posses
sion of their usual health. In the even
ing a lew friend*) came in to say good-by.

entirely of Nevada silver emblematic of
the title tbe victor :s entitled to and of the
fact that the championship was' won in
Nevada.
1 will mince no more word*. Here is
the story in a nutshell : The Nevada Leg
islature is now in session. A r semblyman
Timothy Dempsey, who, by : '.e way, is
one of the most popular memhers of that
body and one of the most ardent sup
porters of the boxing bill, is going to in
troduce a bill in the Legislature within
the next few days asking for an appropri
ation of $3000 for. the iiurrose of having
made a gorgeous belt of silver, with dia
mond studding, to be presented to either
Corbett or Fitzsimmons, whichever
chances to be winner of the great battle.
The bill is being drawn up at the pres
ent time, and it provides that the Secre
tary of State shall deliver the belt on the
18th of March, along with a certificate and
affidavit notifying the world of the signifi
cance of the trophy. It is intended to
have on the rWt-a reproduction of the offi
cial seal of Nevada and a fac-simile' of
Governor Sadler's signature to and ap
proval of the measure.
"I have been thinking this matter over
for several days," said Representative
Dempsey, during a conversation this after
noon, "and I am now satisfied that no
more fitting and appropriate thing could
be done by the State of Nevada than to
follow up its sanction of boxing by pre
senting the winner of the big battle with a
belt, an official recognition of thÃ title he
has won. Itis my intention to ask for an
appropriation sufficiently large to turn out
a belt that the real champion of the world
will not be ashamed of â something he can
exhibit all over the world. The State of
Nevada has gone into this affair -vith its
eyes wide open and realizing just what
she is doinar. We have no fear that we
Will corrupt the morals of the rest of the
World.
"The effete East has |been tolerating
glove contests under the title of physical
culture contests for years and is doing so
to-day. In Nevada we have prohibited
exhibitions of this kind for a long time,
but we finally woke up to the fact that we
were not only shutting ourselves out of
many financial advantages enjoyed by the
Eastern States, but were depriving our
citizens of the pleasure of enjoying a clhsb
of sport that they most desired. But now,
when we open our gates,- we are abused
and ridiculed by thÂ« very States that pre
tend not to tolerate boxing, but permit
the bloodiest battles on the continent.
"We intend to be open and above board.
We not only intend to sanction boxing
contests outright, but we will foster them
to the extent of presenting an official
championship belt, emblematic of the
world's championship, to the winner of
the Corbett â¢ Fitzsimmons contest. The
bill calling for the necessary appropria
tion is now beine drawn up and I am to
introduce it myself. I have been talking
to the members of both branches of the
Legislature ana they approve of my
project in every particular.
"There is no ques.ion about ttie bill
passing. In fact, I really expect to see an
amendent introduce] which will change
my bill so as to provide world's champion
ship belts for the winners of e^ch of the
three battles which are to bs fought on
March Hi and 17. As I understand it, Dan
Etuart has announced toat the winner of
ihe Green-Smith contest will be pro
claimed the champion welter-weight of the
world, and thai either Hawkins or Flah
erty will be heralded as the champion
feather-weight. Of course, everybody
knows that the ficht- between Corbett and
Fitzslmmons is for the title of champion
of all champions. I would approve of an
amendment of this kind and vote for if,
but I consider that by introducing a bill
to provide a belt for the conqueror of the
big contest lam doing well enough for a
starter."
It is understood that, in addition to a
majority of ttie members of the Legisla
ture sicnifying their willingness to vote
fcr the bill, Governor Sadler has already
itiven his consent to sign the act if it
passes. The Governor will not admit this
to outsiders, giving as an explanation that
he never signs a bill of any kind until he
has seen and read it throusn thoroughly;
but iv his usuai characteristic and droll
manner he says he approves of the idea
of a Nevada ohampionsiiip belt.
"Why not?" echoed the Governor when
I spoke to him this afternoon, "Nevada
approves of the world's championship
contest, and why should we not present
the winner with something which he can
show to the world as proof that the title
belongs to him? Now I hope you will
excuse me from talking too much on the
subject at this early period, for I have Dot
been the bill as yet, neither do I know that
such s measure will bo passed. In the
event that it is presented to me, however,
I will give you an interview, and I will
not promise that it wilt be exclusive,
either, as I will not be ashamed to have the
whole world know what I do."
I learned tnis afternoon of a little inci
dent that will no doubt greatly interest
the friends of J;m Corbett. It appear
that since the arrival of Jeffries, the Los
Angeles giant, who is to act as one of Cor
bett's sparring partners, both he and the
big S.ui Franciscan have been somewhat
shy of eaci'i other. Jeffries i? a savaee
fighter and has taken seriously Gorbett's
command that in their practice work he
Ky on as though he meant it. In conse
quence Jam.es J. has had to do his level
best to keep from getting into trouble with
the. youngster, and their collisions have
been the rarest of treats.
. This afternoon Corbett and Jeff ries went
over to the handball court for a quiet little
go, and denied admission to the usual
crowd of visitors. This bout was a
"corker," and it was attended with a sen
sational finish. Corbstt, remembering his
experience yesterday with the Los Angeles
Goliah, sailed in to make a. spectacular af
fair of it. and be succeeded.
Straight lefts were exchanged after about
five minutes of dancing, and shifting and
then -they clinched. In the breakaway
Corbett caught Jeffries with a beautiful
clip on the right ear. Tnts riled the lad
from, the citru3 belt and he -dashed into
Corbett like a tigeri He landed with his
left full on the champion's forehead and
seat him with a crash against the side of
the building. Corbett was forthe nxoment
daze.i, but he shook himself together just
in time to slip away from Jeffries as the
latter came in a?aui.
Then Jeffries found out what it was to
monkey with the buzz-saw. .He followed
the lad with the pompadour but into-the
center of the court. and essayed to throw
in another left similar- to. the one which
sent the champion against the wail. This
time Jim w-as on ihe alert. He ducked
the blow, and, quick as a flash, â  sh=ot hi-T
right out for a cross-counter. The blow
caught Jeffries flush on the jaw and in
slantly his eyes rolled' and he rank to his
knees. He wa3 curling upon the floor
when Corbett anl Trainer Charley White
ran to his assistance and got him lo his
feev.
The young fellow recovered in about
three minutes and confessed that he had
been in a trance. â¢ . . .
Then they went at it again, with Jeffries'
more savage than ever, probably feeling
that he had a score to wipe out. He
hustled Corbett around In great shape
until the latter for self-protection, let 'fly a
hook that connected with the Los An
geles athlete's chin and sent him reeling
away. "That's the second stemwmder,''
said Jeffries when he had got h' : s wits
bac"k again, "go you ought to be satisfied
for the day. 1 '
"You are a!I right, my boy." said Cor
bett, patting bis trainer on i.he back; "you
gave rue tbe greatest crowding I ever had
in my life. You bare not .ing to be
ashamed of. lam proud of you and pro
pose to see you go away, up the ladder."
A'l was quiet and. rest out at the Fitz
simmons camp to-day. The Cornishman
did not work at all, it being his custom to
lay off on the Sabbath. He did not go to
church, however, and in this respect Cor
bet! had the best of him. Jim came into
town early in the morning â  with his
brother Joe and William A. Brady and at
tended the services at the Carson Catholic
church. ."â¢',..
For the first time since all the fighters
have gone into training I drove out to Em
pire to-day to see how George Green and
Dal Hawkins were getting along in their
preparatory work for their mills respec
tively with "Mysterious" Billy Smith and
Martin Flaherty. My candid opinion is
that they have picked out far better train
ing quarters than bava either Corbett or
Fitzuniraons. They are located at the
Wiggins roadside house, and have the use
of a large dance hall for a gymnasium, a
steam bath and tine roads for outdoor
work. More, than this the Carson River
ripples along oast the place scarce 100
yards away, and this affords them an op
portunity for swimming and boating. The
latter are advantages that neither Corbett
nor Fitzsimmons enjoysi Green is in
magnificent shape. He was weighed in
my presence to-day and tipped the beam,
stripped, at just 147 pounds. He says he
expects to go into the ring weighing about
145 or 146.
"I realize that I have a big contract on
my hands," said George, as he stopped for
a moment's breath during his bap-punch
ing exercise. "It is not that I have any
apprehension of Smith's ability to whip
me, but because I know him to be one of
me fou!-est fighters that ever got into a
ring. If he is hit hard he grabs his op
ponent around the legs and begins to
wrestle, and strike foul blows. I don't
think he means to do it, but he loses his
head when he is atruck and conducts him
self lifee a wild steer.
"I feel that it will be a savage fight, but
i I intend to win. Â£ propose to give him a
dose of his own medicine. I don't want
to fight foul, but I'll give him the rough
est reception be ever cot in the ring."
Hawtins Is looking well, too. He
weighed 130 pounds this afternoon, and
was as strong as a little lion.- Under the
articles of agreement he must meet Flah
erty at 128 pounds, so he lias only two
pounds to-reduce. He and Green put ud
some rattling bouts together and contin
ually try to "do" each other.
"Spider" Kelly, who is acting as Haw
kins' chief trainer has not had the gloves
on as yet with Green, but they have an
engagement to meet to-morrow morning.
' These lads area little shy of each other.
They once fought' for blood and Green
won, thus putting himself in direct line
for the welter-weight championship.
Kelly has been going up the ladder, too,
his latest and most important achieve
ment being the aefeat of Lon Agnew, the
phenomenal Eastern boxer. It is quite
natural therefore that these twp'lads
should be a little delicate about getting at
each other ngain with their respective
feelings ol envy, but they have shaken
hands and agreed to work together until
the 17th of March. After that, should
Green beat Smith, Kelly will challenge
the Sai Franciscan, and the latter has
promised to accept right off the reel.
Dan Stuart did not leave Carson for San
Francisco this evening, as was expected.
He was strong enough to walk around his
room, but his physicians advised him tliat
it would be dangerous for him to venture
out, so his trip had to be postponed until
Tuesday. J. G. Mansfield.

abide by his interpretation of the rules

Governor Sadler and Sheriff Kinney
have been quietly gathering about them

quired. The tax- payers are not grumbling
over the additional burden- thus placed
upon them, and the householders dispense

From the half-corn ;>leted plans of the

already been soid, and a number of sec

These sections will be reserved for

"I weigh 165 pounds stripped," declared
Corbett this afternoon. "That is the
.lightest I have been since I entered the
professional ranks. The boys say they
will put a few more pounds on my frame,
but I hardly think I need them. If Fitz

DESERTED FROM VANCOUVER.
Soldiers at the Barracks Be/isve That
Murderer Butler Once Lived
Among Them.
VANCOUVER, Wash., Feb. 28â The
many stories concerning the identity and
record of Frank Butler, alias Ashe, alias
Newman, the alleged Australian mur
derer, have been read with particular in
terest by a few citizens of this place who
were here during the eighties, when the
Twenty-first Infantry was stationed at
i Vancouver, barracks. It is believed by
| them, from the descriptions given of But
ler, that fee spent a few months during
1883 at Vancouver barracks as a member
of the Twenty-first Infantry band under
the nameof James Hartand then deserted.
Michael Boyhan ot this place is of the
belief that Butler and Hart are the same
person. He says that, as nearly as he can
recollect, Hart came and enlisted as a cor
net player in the band in Septembe-, 1883.
Particular attention was attracted to hiru
for : the reason that, within a few weeks
after his enlistment, a rumor became cur
rent in -the barracks and Hart' 6 favorite
haunts in tbe town that Hart was a de
serter from another regirueju under a dif
ferent name, arid- there was considerable
talk of having him' arrested as such. A
little later it was noticed that Hart ap
peared to become uneasy and to be suspi
cious of every one about him, and it came
to be the general belief that the rumors
had reached his ears.
Under these citcu'mstances .Hart's sud
den disappearance on the even-ing of the
second payday after his enlistment created
no surprise among those who knew him,
and only confirmed them iv their belief
in the desertion siory. .
According to Boyhan's story. Hart
spent a year or so in and. about Sprngue,
Wash., afier liis desertion from the Twer.
-ty-first-'lnfantry. There he was employed
as a musician in a private' theater.:- Hart
was in this city a few hours one day in
.the latter part of 1894 or .early in 1895, and
inquired for Boyhan, but did not see him.
After that he was lost trace of hero. He
is supposed" to have been on his way to
San Francisco at that time. .Boyhan says
that the'descriptions given of B-utler taliy
perfectly with Hart as he remembers him.
IDAHO'S LEGISLATIVE SCANDAL
Witness Beard Justifies Regarding the
Buying of Votes for Senator-
Elect Heitfeld.
BOISE, Idaho, Feb. 28.â The committee
appointed by the Legislature to' investi
gate the'eharges of bribery against Senator
Heitfeld, sits behind closad doors and
although it has examined a number of
witnesses, it is difficult to ascertain what
has been discovered. W. J. Beard was
regarded as the most important witness,
and lie testified that he overheard a con
versation to the <ffÂ»ct that Representative
Perkins ha i $10,000 to buy votes for
Heitfeld, and he afterward heard that
Perkins haa paid Representative Joines
$150 and that Repr&sentative Fuller had
also paid Joines money for his vote. The
witness said he taxed Joines witii havine
received the money and Joines at first
denied it, but afterward admitted that
such was the case. That was long before
Joines made the affidavit declaring that
he had. been paid money for his vote.
It was elicited that Heitfeld knew of the
charges before he left for Washington
and that Governor Steunenberg had
Ghown him Joines' affidavit. Representa
tive Fuller, who accompanied Heitfeld to
Washington as private s-ecretary, has been
'elegrapjied to by his friends here to come
back and face the charges.
The defense is proceeding on the theory
that Joines was bribed to make the affi
davit, and evidence is being collected to
present to the committee, tending to show
tiiat Joine-uppronched different members
of thp Legislature, saying there was money
in it for them it they would make affidavit
that they were bribed to vote for Heitfeld.

GLOBE-TROTTER AT SALINAS.
Austrian Fedestrian Who Intends io Visit
All the Countries of the
Earth. â 
SALINAS, Cal., Feb. 28â A bona fide
globe-trotter is liere for a time and is an
object of considerable curio^it}' and inter
est to thoie who frequent the Bardin
House, where he is staying. William
John Thaler is not a globe-trotter in the
customary meaning of the phrase â that
is, one who circles the sphere by the
utilization of steam or by riding or driv
ing the various animals of burden ia the
countries he visits. He is walking over
the world. His itinerary is rather unique,
for he intends circling each of the grand
divisions of land upon the globe, and will
take ship only in going irona one conti
nent to another.
Thaler is a native of Trieste, Austria,
and appears lo be about 40 years of age.
He is over 6 feet tall, and his athletic
build bespeaks tbe thorough pedestrian.
He is by profession an electrician, but
once, while working upon a line in Mon
treal, Canada, he fell lrora a scaffolding
and sustame I severe injuries, fracturing
his skull and losing the sight of one eye.
This necessitated his abandoning his elec
trical career, and he conceived the idea of
walking around the world in his own pe
culiar way.
He mapped out his coarse, which will
cover 33,322 miles, allowing himself seven
years to complete the journey, and
started from Montreal on May 13, 1895.
Thus far he has traveled about "OiJO miles
in v more or less direct line irum his
starting point and ha 3 consumed one
year and t n months of the allotted time.
He keeps a careful record of the incidents
of this tour in a little journal he carries
with him, and has already obtained 1500
signatures in the book, which are written
in twenty-two different language*.
' A notnble feature of ihis stage of the
journey is his trip across the Nevada
desert, during which he was without iood
for two days and had nothing but salt
water to drink. WJion lie arrived at
Wadsworth, Nev., he fired his revolver to
celebrate the fact that he had crossed the
desert. From heie he will a;o to Los An
geles, thence to old Mexico, back to Texas
and New Orleans, and then through the
Southern States ur> the Atlantic coast to
New York, where be wili board a steamer
for Europe. His route will then take him
through Africa, Asia, Australia and New
Zealand and then back to Portland, Or.
He expects to attend the world's expo
sition in Paris in 1900.
Thaler rinds no d.fficulty in getting all
the necessities and many comforts, even
though he started without a penny and
will not take money from any one he
meets en route. He says everyone seems
glad to supply him with fooil and lodging
for the privilege of signing their names in
his book. He wears a silver badge on his
vest, unon which is engraved in French
and Eimlisb, "William John Thaler
started from Montreal, Canada, to go
around the world on foot May 13, 1895.
Presented by J. N. Lapres, artist, 3(50
Denis street, Montreal." He says the
hobos he meets often take him for a de
tective because of the badge. Thaler
speaks four languages and thinks these
will be amply sufficient for his ueeds dur
ing the journey.
DROWNED NEAR TILLAMOOK.
Three Boys in a Rowtoat Borne by the
Tide Inio Breakers Off
the Bar.
TILLAMOOK, Or., Feb. 27.â A shocking
catastrophe occurred here to-aay, whereby
three boysâ Ernest Barnard, aeed 15; Cecil
Miller, aped 16, and George Leasia, aged
16 â lost their lives.
In a spirit of boyish bravado the youths
determined to go out in a small boat
and meet the steamer Chilkat coming over
the bar: The tide was much stronger
than the boys supposed and they were
carried -rapidly out and into the breakers,
wh re their boat was upset and the three
were drowned.
"The boat was inside the bar, and uear
the shore, rind the boys were clinging to it
and screaming at the top of their voices
for help," said Captain Dunham of the
steamer. ''I whistled the signal of dis
tress to draw the attention of some one on
shore and then turned the ship about and
went as near to the shore as I dared and
li wered one of my boats. By this time
the breakers had washed tv,o of the boys
off, and I saw no more of them. There
was a very strong current out, and the
largest boy continued to cling to the boat
and drifted out of the breakers.
"Then the steamer Elmore arrived at
the bar on her way out. I told the cap
tain what had happened and be immedi
ately cro.ssed the bar and steamed about,
hunting for the boys, and especially for
the one clinging to the boat, but he did
not find any of them. I recrossed the bar
to the ocean and looked about, but being
unable to tind either of the boys I steamed
off southward, the direction in which I
thought the boy clinging to the boat had
drifted. After going about half a mile I
sighted the boy on the boat about a quar
ter of a mile further south. I steamed on
toward him as rapidly as possible, but
when about 300 feet away from him an
unusually large wave upset the boat. The
boy threw up his hands and sank and I
saw him no more.."

Inland S a
. SALT LAKE, I3tah, Feb. 28.-The
rather frequent shocks of earthquake
which this section of the country has ex
perienced within the past lew months
have come to a head in the form of a
volcano, which has burst forth from the
Great Salt Lake a short distance south of
Promontory station on the Central Pacific
Railway.
The volcano is right in the lake, about a
mile and a quarter Irotn shore, and parties
residing in the neighborhood say that the
cloud of smoke rushes up into the air ao
high thiit it can be seen at a great distance
and the water in the vicinity boil 3 and
surges into a sea of foam.
The volcano is situated in the big arm
of the lake on tne west side of the long
range of mountains visible from Brigham
City.
The volcano has been in action for sev
eral days.
It began witb a small cloud and slight
disturbance of the water and has increased
in proportion until now it is a most for
midable-lookine phenomenon and has had
the effect of creating fear and consterna
tion among the country people in that
vicinity. It is not visible in this city, but
its presence is looked upon with some
uneasiness.
FATAL SHOOTING AT PETALUMA.
Boys at Play Enact a Burglary, and One
of Them Is Killed With a
Bullet.
PETALUMA, Cal., Feb. 2S.â For the
first time in years Petaluma is the scene
of a tragedy. One bright youne life has
gone out, while another will be shadowed
until death's hand cuts it short. It was
another case of "didn't know it wa3
loaded" that caused the death of Henry,
the 12-year-old son of J. H. L. Gerken*,
proprietor of the Western Hotel. Henry
Gerkens and Farley Temple, aged 15
year>, with three other boys were play
ing this afternoon in the hardware store
of C. Temple, the father of Farley. In
the play young Gerkens was supposed to
be a burglar, and in creeping up to effect
an entrance was met t>y the storekesper,
young Temple, who drew a pisto!, saying
"Look out Henry, I'll shoot you." He
pulled the trigger, bat the cartridge only
snapped. A second effort exploded the
cartridge, the bullet taking effect in young
Gerkens' throat, just missing the collar
bone. The young victim cried out three
times "I'm shot," and expired almost
immediately.
Youne Temple ran out of the store and
around to Main street and gave himself
up to Marshal Collins, and was at once
taken to the City Hall where he was
shortly charged with manslaughter and
releas d under $2000 .bonds, supplied by
J. M. Palmer ant J. V. Long. The pistol
he used was a 44-caliber bulldog and con
tained only one cartridge.
The father of the victim is very promi
nent in raternal circles, being Past Grand
Arch of the Druids of California and a
highly esteemed citizen.

"â NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
ThÂ« matter that is most agitating the
â uembers of the National Guard in all
parts of the State at this time is whether.
the Legislature will in the. few days that
it has still to live make an appropriation
to enable tlie solder boys to go to oamp.
The prospect for such a possibility ie hone
of the brightest, so it is likely Â»hat if any
ot the companies or regiments want to go
in the country as a body it will have to be
at company or regimental expense.
Camps oi instruction are much more de
sirable than campsites without any ap
propriation for camps, for. two years at
least. If the State secures camp sites of
what use will they be unless there is some
fund to enable the regiments to roach
them. There never has been a time -when
the guard could not get a desirable site
within a reasonable distance ot the regi
ment's headquarters, and that without
paying for the use of the same.
Possibly the legislators may see tbe ne
cessity of camps in preference to sites and
allow the purchase of tbe latter to lay
over for a time. If, however, the legis
lators do not desire to u.-e money for
camps they will earn the gratitude of the
members of the guard if they divert the
amount they would expend for sites into
the fund for tlie purchase of hats, coats,
blankets and overcoat*, which are sadly
needed, a. fact that was apparent to the
members of tbe legislative military com
mittees whexi they were in this City in
specting the First Regiment, Second
Brigade, on the '22d of Feuruary.
First Brigade.
SALINAS. Cal.. Feb. 27. â Monday,
February '22, was observed by Troop C and
celebra ed in a manner to recall the rcar
tial spirit of the father of our country. A
mounted drill took ulace during the fore
noon, in which about sixty- members of
the tr,oop participated.
Judging from the energy and dash witn
which some of the maneuvers were exe-.
cuted the boys must nave imagined they
were on Cuban soil and flanking Weyler's
army.
At the close of the mounted drill Mon
day noon, and after a bountiful repast on
hardtack, bologna and "soft" cider, about
tweuty-tive members of the troop started
for the top of Fremonts Peak, fifteen
miles distant, and had a snowball Laity.
It was the first experience among flying
balls, and some of them realized that balls
are dangerous, even though made of snow.
This was the first mounted drill for 1897.
The troop will likeiy be mounted in tbe
parade during the encampment of tue. (i.
A. R. here in Aoril.
Ihe Second Brigade.
The regimental parade and inspection
of the First Regiment on Washington's
birthday bron^nt our nearly 80 per cent of
tlie command. There were 733 men in
line, rank and rile. Taken as a whole, the
command made a line appearance and
crea;ed a good impression on the inspect
ing officers and members of the military
C'-mrnittees.
The regiment, however, would have pre
sented a much better appearance than it
did, had the men been provided witn
better leggins than they wore. Those
they had on are so short that they come
only half way up the calf of the leg.
and a consequence of this is that they will
not remain in place, but will sag down
toward the ankle- and present anything
but a neat appearance. The leggins used
by tne regular army reach above tlie calf
o? tne ieg and they remain stationary,
adding much to the appearance of th~
soldier.
One thing that was not to the credit of
the companies of the First was the unsol
dieriy manner of wearine the service hats.
bcrae of the companies seemed to be un
der the impression that as service uni
form does not call for the nicety tnat lull
dress does, any style of wearing the hat
would do, and they acted on that idea.
Some Dunched their hats up to a point
nod f'Ut four dents into it, and ttien wore
them in a devil-may-care style, and con
tinued that they appeared" "just- about
rigtit." But they did not, for it was a vio
lation of the regulations, which instead o'
adding to tne soldierly appearance of the
men gave them a decidedly unaoldierly
look. T Â« regulations call for an Al
pine hat and the presumption is that
tiie men shall wear the regulation hat as
it is furnished. Hal the officers in charge
on that day given the matier the atten
tion it reserved and refused ;o receive tne
men who transgressed the regulations aÂ«
to hats, there would not have been so
lurch unfavorable comment irom the citi
z us who watched the regiment march
along the avenue and down Market street.
But then there may be some excuse for
tlie men in being careless as to their hats
when they had an example set them by
their superior officers. The brigadier
gcneral wore a hat that was no: of the
(tray that the regulation calls for nor the
share. It was a handsome bat, built on
the Feiipraplan, but it was not a military
hat. Taen were members of the staff
who wore the regulation bat as to shape
and color, and there were others that had
iiats off colored and off shaped, and taken
ul together the headgear burdiy came up
to the standard. Then there was the cap
tain of Troop A, who wore a hat that
must have been tjuiit OB Â«>n entirely origi
nal model, for such a hat m never DÂ»-fore
b* n on the head of a representative of
tiie National Guard.
L :s probable that at the next meeting of
Hie board of oliicprs th? question of wear
in; hats will be discussed and that some
thing will be done to have the regulation
hat worn a<< it should tie.
L:is! Priday evening Companies D, A. Â£
nii'l I were out on Van Nes< dt'iiuo for
battalion d ri 1 in accordance with a plan
prepared some time since by Lieutenant-
Colonel Ihiboce. The battalion was under
the supervision of Major Bioxton, but
drilled by Captain Fitzpatricfc. The bat
talion was drilled in i variety of move
ments and much attention was paid to in
jtnictinj: the men in what is known as
lie riot drill. This mc vied the forming of
tireet column and the forming of square s.
This drill is one calculated to place the
men on the defensive and is considered by
military men one of the most useful for
city companies. Tbs battalion turned
out well and executed the several move
ments in good style.
Third Brigade
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 26.â 0n
Washington's Birthday the Signal Corps,
Third brigade, communicated all after
noon with Davisville by heliograph, cov
ering a distance of sixteen miles. The
weather was beautifully, clear and the
boys oniy regretted that they had not
sent the outside station farther away, as
Mount Diablo and toe Buttes were plainly
discernable Irom the "home" station on
the Capitoi dome at Sacramento. Lieuten
ant Martin had charge of the Sacramento
station, while Sergeant Bailey looked
after the squad at Davisville.
The fo. lowing evening (Tuesday)
signaling was successfully executed from
the Armory 10 the Capitol.
At a special meeting of the corps, held
Tuesday evening, the foil wing resolu
tions were unanimously passed:
Reso'vcd, That it be the sense of the Signal
Cori>s, Third Br:Ri de, National Ciua.rd of Calt
lornin, that vie are heartily in' sympathy with
: ttie Cuban League of the- Uiritod Situes ia tneir
j endeavor to eoifst r Ã¼blic'sympathy in mvor of
the people ol Cuba, who are battling for their
I independence.
Ret lived, That we further indorse the actions
I of said league in urging our Government to
I. exercise more vigilance â and force if neces
sary â to protect from Spanish brutality cili
! gens ol the United States who are arrested -in
I Cuba.
A; rotted, That two copies of these resolutions
I be transmitted to Colonel C. H. Hubbard,
[.Mayor of the cfty of Sacratnento; one for the
| Sacramento branch nf said league 1 , with t,fce
request lhat the othtr copy be forwarded 10
I headquarters oi the â  Cuban League of the
i I'nited States of America in New York City.
Sergeant Wntkins and Private LeitcL.
were delegated to present the above reso
tions to the Sacramento branch of th-e
I Cuban League, which was established the
| same evening, and, on reading the same,
i a vote of thanks was paused to the corpÂ«.
j Officers of other local companies were
I present at tlie meeting, and expressed
! .their con tidence that similar resolutions
would oe forthcoming from all other
â  National Guard organ zations.
Lieutenant Martin will take a tquad to
Newcastle on Sunday, ana open stations
betwe.-n there ana Sacramento at 10
o'clock- If the clear weather keeps up
j there is no doubt of success.
In a short while tne new Myer system
of signaling, at present used by the United
I States army and navy, will be put into
! effect for use in the signal corps of this
! State. The code presents many advan
tages over the old Morse system, espe
cially for heliograph work, notable amonir
which may be mentioned the entire ab
sence of tae "space ' in 'he various char
acters and of the long fl isli except when
U3ed as a "conventional" signal.
Sergeant Bauey has re-enlisted after
I much persuasion from the merabers.of
| tne corps, with whom he is a great fa
vorite. He offered to do so on the condi
tion that Lieutenant Martin would beat
his score at the target ranue last Sunday.
Result of the score was 44 to 42 in favor of
the lieutenant.
The held drii.l of companies X and G,
which took place on Was nigton's birth
day, was an unqaalihed success, and the
boys showed a more than marked imp
rovement in their company movements
and drill, at times showing ull the steadi
ness of the regulars, and greatly pleasing
their commander, Colonel (iiithrie. This
day's outing fully demonstrated ilie util
ity of the "non-com" school, and the vast
lmDrovement visible among the "non
coms" insured more ie,;ulariiy in the
movement? oi tne rank and file. The
school lor "non-coms" has become very
popular among the boys, and ha* devel
oped a great veal of gobd-natured rivalry
among ihem, as they are at all times at
tempting to dig up some -puzzling ques
tion on tactics, which invariably leads to
discussion, and in consequence a far bet
ter knowledge of the rules and regula
tions.
During the field drill it was found that
the ammunition used, "being reloaded
shells," would swell in firing and Decome
jambed 'in the guns, and two of the mem
bers were quite severely injured while ex
tracting tue shells by aid of their ramrods,
Sergeant Guth laying his index linger
open to the bone with the point of his
bayonet and Private Hill of Company G
splitting his thumb by the same means.
Troop B, cavalry, will go out for a field
day nexf Sunday, and expect to make an
extended jauiit through the surrounding
country, cam pins for meals by the w:iy
side. The troop will have a team shoot
two weeks from Sunday, the losing team
to entertain tne winners with a smoker.
The competing members have not as yet
been selected, but all the members are
practicing at every opportunity in order
to obtain places on the teams. Last Sun
day the highest score made with a carbine
Â«U 44, by Corporal Jennings! The high
est scores made at the butiÃ on Sunday
are as follows:
Company Eâ Captain Schoemater 34. Ser

hotly contested from beginning to end,
and the company was defeated By a score
of 4to 0. The signals of the home team
were give'i to the opposing team by some

from the headquarters of the Third Bri
gade. Company H. Sixth Infantry, paraded
for field day txercisei'on Washington's
birthday with forty-four men present.
Regimental orders directed that the com
pany be divided into two provisional com
panies, and a battalion drill and parade
and tuard mount be held. The first
platoon under Lieutenant Smith and the
second under Lieutenant Guthrie were
designated as the provisional companies
for the occasion. As Merced has no staff
officers', First Sergeant Harper was de
tached as acting t attalion adjutant, and
Corporal Muller as acting battalion ser
geant-major. The companies were
marched to the railroad reservation where
the battaion was formed and a few of the
battaion maneuvers were gone through.
An extended order drill followed and
the day's exercises were wound up with
batahon parade and the ceremony of
gaurd mount.
Corporal Daniel F. Griffen has been
promoted to be sergeant, and Privates
John F. Fentry and Tobias F. Bearwald to
be corporals. Private John A. Conway is
transferred to Company Dof Modesto, and

the corporals Private W. G. Kelley has
been detailed as a lance corporal until the
vacancy occurs.
Now that it is certain that the Sixth
Infantry will go into camp this fall, many
recruits are coming in, and it is noticeable
that the material is of tne very best. The
officers hope to have the new men in the
best of shape when tne encampment is
ordered.
Target practice has been suspended
since the first of the year, awaiting the
| completion of the new target range, when
the regular monthly shoots will bs re
sumed under the revised rules. Some di
ficulty is being experienced in securing
good grounds lor tha location of the ex
treme ranges.
The Tuesday evening tactical class under
L.eutenant Guthrie is being well attended,
and quite an enthusiasm v being aroused
by tue lieutenant, whose methods of in
struction are practical and the fruit of
â considerable study and thought After a
recitation of a lesson from the drill regu
lations the class is put through the execu
tion of commands and particular atten
tion paid to the smallest details of position
and disinnces. The evening is completed
with a general talk on military subject,
customs and requirements. By the use of
a model company and blocks representing
individual soldiers tue lieutenant gives a
practical illustration of every evolution,
which thoroughly impresses it on the
mind of the student.
A baseball nine has been organ zed
from among the memusrs of the company,
which will attempt to attain distinction
on the diamond. The men have not been
definitely placed as yet, and will not be
until a few practice games ere played.
Lieutenant Smith is the manager of the
nine. The club wouid welcome a chance
to play against other military nine's as
soon as the men have practiced a little.

ner has returned from San Dieeo, where
he attended the examination of L. A.
Cha-ndler for the position of lieutenant
and. T. M. Shaw for the position of lieu
tenant junior grade of Third Division at
fa at point. The men passed a sati-factory"
examination and toe report that will be
presented will undoubtedly secure them
their commissions.
The commander states that his visit wa>
hailed with pleasure by the men of the
division; that on Washington's birthday
they took part in the parade, turning out
fifty-eight men, and presented' as fine an
appearance as the uniforms they have
wouid permit. " .
A gentleman who was with the com
mander at : h- time of the parade and saw
the men of the battalion and returned a
few days since, said that if there is one
thing above all otners tnat the men ot ti.e
Navai Battalion at San Dietr.o needs more
than anything else it is uniforms.
The men wno tank part in the six-oared
boat race on ihe 22J at San Diego did well,
and they wouid" undoubtedly have gained
second place hÂ«d it not been for the fact
that they were fouled. As it was, the
men of the reserve demonstrated their
ability to handle a boat.
'ihe lir-t and the second division had a
battalion drill on the Sprockets wnarf last
Tuesday night.. There were eighty men
present, and they did remarkably well,
particularly the petty officers, who showed
that the lessons they have recently re
ceived ia the lyceum has been of great
service to thf>m. The men were drilled by
Lieutenant Dennis. W. E. Eliott, lieuten
ant, junior Krade, being the adjutant.

CLINIC FOR THE POOR.
College of Physicians and Surgeons
Open a Charitable Estab
lishment.
A free clinic has been established by the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, How
ard street, near Fourth.
The free outdoor clinic at the City and
County Hospital has had to be abandoned
for want of funds. This prompted the
management of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons to establish a free clinic for
the poor. Their wounds are ur^ssed free
of charge and the doctors connected with
the college are giving their services free.
For want of accommodation thÂ«* college
professors are obliged to send many a poor
sufferer away when he or she snould be
placed in a hospital bed and receive proper
medical or surgical treatment, and it is
hoped that some charitably disposed per
son or organization may endow a tew beds
for the treatment oi those absolutely
needy. _
Infant Smothered.
The Infant son of San Yuen Vow of 18 Pros
pect place was found dead in bed by his
mother yesterday morning. She stated to a
Coroner's deputy that she had fed the child at

under the bedclothing.

Grover Cleveland. He has blundered so

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?
It is now several years since the City of San Francisco awoke to the urgent neces
sity of having built for the use of Its increasing bnginess a new Government building
mainly devoted to the uses of a Postoffice. By a spasm of energy on the part of the
then members of the Senate and Congress a small appropriation was voted for the
acquisition of a site for the structure. The sharpest kind of competition speedily
arose among the owners and agents of available sites over the selection of the most
suitable one. After awhile the spot upon which tradition tells us that the future
Postoffice may possibly be erected was.chosen by the Commissioners in charge of that
preliminary step.
That was years ago. Since then our people have held several Congressional elec
tions and have chosen more than one Senator. What have they done to further this
most needed public work? What in particular has been the activity of our Demo
cratic Senator and the Democratic members of the House of Representatives from
California, who are presumed to have some degree of influence with the Democratic
administration at Washington? What have you been doing, Senator White,
during the past year to keep the supervising architect awake to his duty
in this respect? What energy have you shown. Judge Maauire, in nroddins the Post
master-General and his deputies up to a proper activity in the furtherance of this
needed work? What have the other Democrats, who, while elected from outside dis
tricts, represent the whole State of California, done to supplement the lagging zeal of
those whose especial care it should have been to push along this public necessity?
The people of San Francisco are entitled to have these questions answered by
their servants at Washington, and are also entitled to be justly indignant if the forth
coming answer is not satisfactory.
During the present week a change in the administration at Washington will
occur. A Republican President, Secretary of the Treasury and Postmaster-General
will be in power. In view of the long and apparently inexcusable delay in this
matter, it will not do for Senator White or Congressman Maguire to lie back and
justify inertia upon the plea that they are impotent with the new administration-
Neither will this plea longer avail Senator Perkins or Congressman Loud.
The people of Ban Francisco demand their Postoffice building, and are aroused to
a full knowledge of the fact that they have been delayed inexcusably in getting it by
the grossest official neglect somewhere. They intend now to ascertain who is
responsible for this neglect and to put a present end to delay. Itis to be seen whether
our own official servants at Washington intend to act in the matter in accord with
their duty and with our City's needs. If they do not San Francisco will apply, to the
Senators and Congressmen representing other and more fortunate States and cities,
who have had their Postoffice buildings of equal or greater size arid cost completed in
their own communities during the years that San Francisco has -not succeeded in
getting beyond the purchase of a site.
SPRING IS HEEE.
According to the almanac and the con
ventional divisions of our year spring be
gins to-day. Over in the East, where the
seasons are sharply divided by differ
ences of weather, the day will be univer
sally noted and a thousand poems will
wing their way from poets' hearts to ed
itors' wastebaskets. With us, where the
seasons blend into one another by such
slow and slight changes as to be almost
imperceptible, the day will hardly be
noted at ali. Nevertheless to California
as much as to any part of the country does
the coming of spring give reason to re
joice. It promises prosperity and brings
a thousand evidences that the promise
will be fulfilled.
In our gladness at the coming of spring
we shall not lay so much stress as they do
in the East upon the blooming of flowers.
These, though they are not poor, we have
always with us. Our sense of satisfaction
comes from other things. It is a pleasure
of course to see the fields radiant aealn iv
the golden glow of poppies, the orchards
almost luminous with blooms and the gar
dens taking on a richer luxuriance than
tney have known under the clouds of
winter, but these are not for us so great a
chanue from wintry scenes as they are in
the East, and of course do not affect us bo
acutely. In order to fully enjoy them we
have to add to them music, revelry and
mirth. Our spring is the seKson of carni
vals.
Not, however, even from the gorgeous fes- ;
tivals which are being prepared in aii sec
tions of the State does the fullest satisfac
tion come with the consciousness thut we !
have reached the beginning of spring.
This year the season is to bring us first of
all relief from Cleveland. After that by
swift degrees will come relief from Cleve- |
landism, depression and hard times. The
spring is to be a new uprising of a thou
sand activities which have long lain dor
mant, 01 dying, under the administration j
of debt, deficit and disaster. Far better ;
than the return of flowers will be the re- 1
turn of Industry. More cordial will be
the welcome given to enterprise, work and j
wages than any which will be accorded to
carnivals however gorgeous or festivals
however gay.
In the good things of the spring Califor- j
nia will share. We shall have our return
to the summer of prosperity after the long
winter of depression. We shall profit with
the rest of the country in all the benefits J
of the coming McKinley days. Spring is j
here. Three more days of Grover. Truly !
it is time to rejoice, whether it rain or
shine.
GREEK NATIONALITY.
It is safe to assert that whatever cour.-e
may be taken by the great, powers in deal
ing with the Cretan crisis and to what
ever terms Greece may be compelled to
submit for the time, thecontest now begun
will not end until the desire of all the
Greeks to be united into one nation is
realized and satisfied.
This is not the first time modern Greeks
have had to struggle against great odds
for a national existence. Early in the
century, when Europe, worn out by the
long Napoleonic wars, sought repose by
every means diplomacy conld deviae, the
Greeks of the mainland rose to assert their
independence of Turkish rule. Then as
now tne Governments of the great nations
saw danger to themselves in the struggle
and endeavored to suppress the patriots.
Then as now, however, the sympathies of
the people of all countries were with the
Greeks, and it was in vain the diplomats
attempted to silence the voice of human
ity and to baffle the popular desire to see
Greece resume her place among the
nations of the earth.
As Gladstone speaks for Greece to-day
so Byron more eliquent than Gladstone
himself spoke for her then. In America
Fitz-Greene Halleck added the influence
of his genius to that of Byron and roused
American sympathy with Greece to a
genuine fervor by that noble ode to Marco
Bozzaris, which is still treasured among
the best possessions of our poesy. For
more than tin years the Greeks fought for
national independence in much the same
way the Cubans are fighting now. In the
end the apathy of the Governments of the
nations was overcome*. Diplomacy was
forced to jjive way to public sentiment.
The great nations a-, last interfered on
behalf of the heroic patriots, and Greece
was free.
It would have been well for Europe had
the statesmen of that time been wise
enough to deal with the subject thor
oughly and unite all the Greeks in one
nation. They chose, however, tne other
course and gave to freedom as little as
they could. They left the Greek islands
and Macedonia in possession of the Turk,
and to-day Europe reaps the sad conse
quences of that fault of the statesmen of a
bygone age. It remains to be seen whether
the rulers of Europe at this time will be
wise enough to profit by the warning of
that mistake, or whether they will com*
mit the same blunder and for the sake of
temporary peace attempt once more to
compromise an issue which can never be
settled until it is settled right.
We have seen in the later years of this
century the Italians and the Germans
tight their way to national unity. The
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 1, 1897.
! Greeks now struggling in the same- cause
! are destined to win. Under, no circum
| stances will Crete be given back to Turkish
! rule, and sooner or later Macedonia will

I strength. That accomplished there will
then remain the Poles and the Irish to

A NOBLE GIFT.
Much of the complaint against vast ac
cumulations of wealth in individual hands
I would ceas3 if millionaires should follow
the example set by the Scandinavian,
1 Alfred Nobel, who recently died and be
; queathed a fortune of $10\000,003 to the
j benefit of humanity. The interest from
; this immense sura he directs shall an
| nually be distributed in five great prizes
| to the five men who have been among the
' foremost benefactors of their race.
There is a prize each for the most im
j portant discovery in physics, in chemistry
and in medicine, one lor the greatest liter
j ary work In an ideal sense and the riftb
I goes to him who shall have exerted the
j greatest or best action for the fraternity of
j tde people, for the suppression or the
diminution of armies and tor the promo
| tion of peace congresses.
These five prizes will amount to $60,000
each, and every year there will be a fresh
| chance for discoverers, authors and philan
thropists to win these fortunes. .It is the
most munificent system of rewards that
: has- ever been established. Four of these
| prizes are to be awarded by various Swel
ish academies and institutes and the fifth
by a committee appointed by t: c Nor
wegian Storthing, but it is the express
; will of the testator that nationality shall
; not be taken into account in the awards.
Alfred Nobel was a distinguished chem
ist and the inventor of dynamite. It
seems odd that he who placed in man's
hands the most terribly destructive of
war's munitions should have offered these
great annual prizss for those who put
forth the best efforts for war's suppression.
It is probable, however, the invention
itself may yet have a stronz influence in
putting an end to the battles the inventor
detested, and which he planned that nis
wealth should continue striving to over
come long after his death. Learning how
louse dynamite effectively may make
war mutually and suddenly extermina
tive that no nation will have the Molly to
engage in it.
It will be interesting to watch what ef
fect the stimulus of these large prizes will
have on genius. It is to be devoutly
hoped th^at mankind will greatly benefit
from the magnificent gift of this lover of
humanity. Perhaps the aÂ»cegate effect
both in stimulating genius and befriend
ing mankind might have been made
greater by dividing tffe sum into smaller
prizes so as to reach humbler toilers and
des?rvers. Many more hearts would thus
have been encouraged and made happy.
The five among -the world's most success
ful men who will succeed in capturing
these great prizes would, in almost every
case, have reaped an immense reward
without the addition' of Nobel's gift, and
the stimulus of it could add little toward
rousinc a capacity which was great
enough to reach out for the first rive
achievements of each year. However,
since the manner of distributing the gift
has passed forever beyond reconsidera
tion, let us hope that Providence will
direct the awards to some of those modest
scholars who seek no wealth from patent
rights, and who have no commercial
capacity to compel the world to pay them
what they deserve.

The Bhasta Courier, profiting by the wisdom
born of experience, makes Hie following re
flection on the cold-day clamor of some of its

century and has had 1000 men promise
to bring wood on subscription, Â»nd finally

Here is another original suggestion from
the Bodie Miner- Index: -It might be a good
plan ior the Secretary of the Navy to have aU
the rocks and reefs along tho coast lines of
this country legibly labeled lor the
protection of the United States cruisers.
The commanders seem to be unable otherwise
to assure themselves of the existence of such
things save by the crude and disastrous test

back to the Capitol, hitching his hone to the

Senate chamber to take the oath as President.
To have done this would have been in accord

had strongly condemned .as savoring of
monarchy all public ceremony at the swear

his 'own Inauguration arrived, however, the
case seems *' to ? hare -looked *.. different to
him. Whether it wns because ne was to be the

DR. HEMPHILL, Who Yesterday Denounced the European Powers
Which Are Tyrannizing Over Greece.
ARRAIGNED THE
GREAT POWERS
Dr. Hemphill on the Bom
bardment of the
Greeks.
Strong Words of the Pastor oi
Calvary Presbyterian
Church.
So-Called Christian Nations Termed
Pagan and Barbarian.âCon
gregation E ectrifieJ.
Dr. Hemphill of Calvary Presbyterian
Church poured hot shot into the Euro
pean powers for their efforts to prevent
Greece from occupying Crete in his ser
mon yesterday morning.
The announced topic, "A Noteworthy
Example of Christ's Cleansing Power,"
gave little intimation "of what was to
come, and the congregation was electrified
when the pastor arraiened the nations in
no measured terms for interfering with
the Greeks. He termed them "puny,
paean, barbarian powers of Europe," and
called upon the Lord to stay the slaughter
of Christians by the "unspeakable Turk."
"They are having troublous times over
there in Europe at present," he said, "and
the trouble is not ended. It is only be
gun. A trouble is never ended until it is
ended right. The great powers of Europe
think they have ended it by turning their
great guns on little Greece. God bless lit
tle Greece! May she make for herself a
new Thermopylae! The great powers
have not ended the trouble. They have
only begun it. The Christian sentiment
oi the world is greater than the greatest
guns of the great powers, and the Chris
tian sentiment of the world is against the
Turk. â¢ â ,
"The Turk is unspeakable. The Turk
is fanatical in bis hatred of all Christians
of every name. The Turk is a lustful
beast, The Turk it a bloody butcher. The
Turk is a moral leper.
"The Christian powers? The civilized
powers? The great powers? No; the puny,
pagan, barbarian powers. Why do I call
them so? Because for half a century and
more they have aided and abetted, and are
stiil aiding and abet;injr, the atrocious Turk
iv his bloody butcheries. Within the
memory of some here the Turk has butch
ered oO'OCO Greek Christians, 10,000 Nesto
rian Christians, 11,000 Maronite and Sy
rian Cnristiana and 15.000 Bulgarian
Christians. And within two years he has
butchered 75,000 Armenian Christians,
mostly men, leaving more than 300,000
women and children, mostly girls, to die
of disease and starvation, or become the
slaves of Turkish lust and rapacity. And
the grent Christian, civil zed powers of
Europe? No; the puny, pagan, barba
rian powers of Europe watch the bloody
butcheries and do nothing. And they do
nothing in the interests ot peace, they say.
"It is a great, dreadful lie. It is not in
the interests of peace, but in the interests
of their pockets. Turkey is a bankrupt
nation; me great powers are the credit
ors, and if Turkey were dismembered the
creditor nations would suffer loss. Their
present do-nothing policy is in the inter
est* of greed, and not in the interests of
peace. Have the great powers of Europe
iu'cii so fond of peace in the past that they
should now cry 'peace at any price?'
Peace! It is a false peace. It is saying
peace, peace, when tuera is no pence.
Sometimes the best and only way to
peace is through blood-red war. War is a
great evil, but ihere are worse things even
than war. The present iniquitous peace
in Europe is worse; and tt. ere never will
be peace in Europe until the leprous Turk
is driven out of it. Well, my comfort and
faith and hope and prayer is that what
the so-called Christian nations cannot
or will not do, Jesus Christ, the king of
nations, will do. He can cure the lepro
sies that afflict the body politic just as
ea3ilyas he cured the leprosy that afflicted
the body of the man whose case we have
been considering this morning, just as
easily as he can cure the leprosy of sin
that atthcts your soul and mine.
"He has yet to reckon with the Turk
for all the Christian blood he has shed.
He has yet to reckon with the Christian
nations of Europe for letting it be shed.
How long, O Lord, how long? Why
tarry the wheels of thy chariot? MaKe
speed to save thy slaughtered jteoole, for
their salvation comes not from the na
tions ot Europe who call themselves by
thy name."

Children Have a Fine Time at the
Chutet.
There was an hour or two of pleasant
weather yesterday, which made a visit to
the park and ocean bench a pleasure to
tne lew who went out. %
Curator Wilcomb of the park museum
baÃ returned from a trip to Southern Cali
fornia, where he has been collecting
Indian relics. They wiil be put on exlii
bition next week. There have been a
number of donations to the muÃenm dur
ing the past week. A number of opals
were given by S. Sonnenfeld of San Fran
cisco, some stuffed birds from Mrs. M. E.
Chauche of Oakland and some relics of
colonial days from Mrs. Ed E. Lee of Sa
lem. Mass.
The birds in the aviary were tuning up
for the opening of spring, and Monarch,
the grizzly bear, thought it warm enough
to take a bath in the big tub.
They had the usual sports out at the
Sutro baths. The boys' race was won by
F. Ciough. Tl:e 100-yard race was a tie
between Geddis, Redigan and Bell, ana
the obstacle race was won by F. Clough.
At the Chutes there was "a crowd of de
lighted children watchiner the perform
ances of Bristol's trained ponies. Tbe
star performer was the little muie, "Den
ver," who cleverly helps his master put
on his coat, and he can pull off the boss'
rubbers and put "them away in the closet.
When his master was sick in the city of
Denver the little mule used to go down to
the hotel to see him every day and walk
up the steps to his room, ilc can get
in a swing and swing himself in a way
that brings much applause.

TOOK A NEW VOW
OF TEMPERANCE
Annual Ceremony of the
League of the Cross
at St. Mary's.
The Cathedral Filled to the
Doors With Young
Soldiers.
A Beautiful CÂ»re;mÂ©ny That Was
IJeautiful'.y and Impressively
Observed..'. : .
To the rattle of aiums, with flagswav
ing,, between a mass of humanity on the
right and left, laavlng a wide avenue for.
them, an army of young- men marched,
with soldierly precision up ihe broad
steps of St. Mary's Cathedral, thro.Tigh the
portals and were los.t to the view of the
throng outside. For none but wearers of
the badge of the League of the .Cross
might enter. , . ; V ." V.
For almost an hour they filed itr, keep
ing step to the tnrab of the drums, lower
ing the Hags as they paÂ«s"ed through' the
high archway, and being then niar-Shaled'
down the aisles to the right and the left,
ami then down the broad central aisle,
â¢the older members.in their neat uniformsâ
: the cadets â beinj. grouped in. place's of
1 honoi, the still older members wearing
! their baoges,also grouped by themselves,
; and the juniors, the Ik tie fellows with
their high but impressionable spirits,
j' hieing also marshaled separately.
The body of the church being com
â  pletely filled, the inflowing tide of young;
men was turnecr at the outer doors into
the galleries until they were filled. There
it was then an immense cathedral filled,
, evary seat in it, with-young men reaay. to'
take the 03th of temperance. It was an
[ impressive spectacle 'in somber colors, for
there was not a woman within the walls.
Fvery entrance to rhe "Cathedral was be-
I sieged by friends of 'he ieague, hoping for
an opportunity to enter and witness the
benuti.ul ceremony, but so completely did I
the league itself occupy the space that the
doors had to be kept relentlessly closed
against them.
As the army of youths enter the male
J cnoir is chanting a hymn and the sonor
: ous tones of the organ subdue the rumble
i and throb of drums outside.
In tne center of the chancel and in irqnt
1 of the altar, which is already ablaze with.
! lights, the pulpit has been drawn and
â¢ Father O'Ryan, spiritual director of the
: Jeague, ascends. The church is now li.lled,
the last recruit has been allotted bit place
in the throng and the music of the hymn
and the organ dies down.
At a sign from the priest the great an
! dience falls upon its knees and out of the
j silence that follows the rush of noise
I which the slight movement created it
, repeats the simple apostrophe, following
I upon its utterance by the priest.
Then the audience rises and, standing,
1 joins as an immense chorus in the sinking,
of the beautiful hymn, "Veni Creator."
They kneel again while the priest reads
the famous "prayer for the church and
civil authoritips" which has been handed
down from "Washington's lriend. Arch
bishop CarrolL
The prayer beine completed the audi
ence again rises to join in a short hymn.
Durinir the sing-ing Father O'Kyan leaves
the pulpit, and as the last notes are sung
j Archbishop Riordan ascends to his place
i and standing awaits the pilence thai falls
in the cnurcn instantly upon the audience
teinjr seated. The b shop's address to the
, boys of the league is snort but impressive,
: spoken as a faitaer to his children.
"My young friends," he said, '"to see
you here in such number* and for such a
; purpose â to renew the vows you have
taken in years past â is indeed a spectacle
; that must g.advien the hearts of all who
may be. fortunate enough to witness it.
Thatso.many 9tand ready to pledge them
i se-ves against that license to the appeti c
; that is so alluring, but that invites and
j leads only toward ruin, is a sight that is
\ very good to see.
"I need not, my dear boys, tell yon of
I the principles of this organization. You
â  are members of it and you know what is
! expected of you. You will teac-h with the
I eloquence of your example that tem
-1 perance is itÃelf a redeemer from vice. 1
j need not tell you, for you hear it monthly
I at your meeting, thai intempernnce is
I among the most terrible of vices. W^re it
: dune away with it would banish nine
tenths of the evil of the world.
"It claims its victims from every walk
' of life, from high and low and from
I among the most brilliant minds of the
1 world, dragging them down to the lowest
I level. Sot that there is any great danger
I of youth in giving way to tin? vice, but
1 you must Know that we are all creatures
of babu, and once vice takes hold upon
us its hold is terrible.
"Suppose I i:ive you a piece of thread
I and ask you to break it. You do it with-
I out trouble. I tell you take another with
it. You find it more difficult. Andwben
I add one to another until you have ten
or twelve you lina that its strength is
g^reafr than yours. Â£0 it is with.'-'nbi.
\ou give way to temptation once, and
then again, and again, until it has a hold
upon you that is stronger than Is your
j power tt> resist.
"But with the yonug a great deal can
be done to meet and head off the monster.
I By association v7itb others who are fol
lowing the path of virtue they are
; strengthened; they emulate each other.
I Your association is a protest against the
j vice of intemperance. Of course, the
I church preacues constantly the necessity
j of temperance and calls upon i>s followers
I to waik in soberness, tha.. this tremendous
j evil may be uprooted. Your public
I demon-trat on is enough to get men to
I thinking that where so much is doi.e
I ag linst & special evil it is something 10 be
avoided. So, while you may individually
do little in the great work, you form a
mighty power when collected together.
"I: I were to suspend from the roof of
this cathedral a mass of iron and ask you
to move it by throwing a pellet of paper
j you might smile, but ii you attacked'it in a
body with a great number of pellets it
would, after a while, bepin to tremble and
move. So, united in your stana against
this tremendous pvil of intemperance you
cause it to tremble and shake from its
foundations.
"Now, my dear children, it is easy to
take a pledge once in a while. The trouble
is to keep it. Vice is constantly In your |
path with its temptations, ana it is well I
for us to gather together and renew the
pledge in this public manner once a year.
"You know what a banner is. It is the
j emblem of our ooun;ry. It is placed in
1 the hands of soldiers, who go forth to bat
jMe for their homes and country. So I
I would have you l>>ok upon your ting in
j the spirit of soldier-love and fidelity. If
I y>u maintain yourselves steadfast you
Will look back in your age with pleasure
to ti:ese meetings and will thank God that
he has preserved you from the evil of in
j temperance, and when, you come to die it
I will be us one of whom his country and his
church will be proud."-
The sermon beine finished the young
soldiers of .the League fell upon their
knees again ami the Bishop, began tlie j
â¢â¢Prayer of Consecration"â "Come, O
Holy (r host, fill the hearts of thy faithful
people, enkindle in them the lice of thy
! love" â and so, with the responses that
', came back with a great volume of sound,
giving. tolcn of how every soul joined in it.
8 anding again, the great aruiy is called
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 1, 1897.
upon to lift its right hand, and, following
the words as tuey are uttered by the
Bishop, take this solemn vow:
1 declare before Almighty God, and you,
most reverend father, and iv the presence of
this congregation, that I hereby solemnly re
new for the followiug year'the promise of tem
perance according to the rules of that branch
of the Lengue of the Cross of which 1 am a
member, and may God give me the grac.e to
keep this, niv pledge, in the name of the
Father, and of" the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Then they kneel again and continue the
prayer and its responses. . .
Then, tbe pulpit being pushed aside, re
vealing the broad altar, the beautiful cere
mony of the benediction of the moat holy
sacrament is performed to. set its seal upon
the vow.
Then the service is finished with the
Te Deum and the youihfdl army marches
out into the daylight again. The drums
beat, the flags are unfurled and the throng
of eager friends greet'thn soldiers in the
avenue;. They form in line battalion
front, and then swing into company front
and march in review before their com
mander, Colonel Suliivan, and his staff.
There were in the line exactly 2778 mem

AN ORPHAN HOME
DOUBLY BLESSED
Yesterday by Bishop
Nichols.
A Samaritan Mission Adjoining
a Res dence ior Parent
less Boys.
Dedicatory Services Participated In
by Clergy and the V.sted
Orphan Choir.
Yesterday witnessed tho accomplish
ment by Episcopalian church folk oi this
City of two worthy Christian undertak
ings, tbe useful results of which are de-
tined to be farther reaching than the
limits of the one sect. The new Good
Samaritan Missfon wfth its read ins-room,
billiard-room, gymnasium and chapel was
dedicated in tbe lore;;oon by the JBishon
of California, assi>ted by several clergy
men ; and th.c city banch Arrmiiage
Cnurch Orphanage and Orphan Home,
next door to the mission, near Second
i and Folsom streets, was formally
blessed by Bishop Nichols in the
afternoon, and with appropriate speeches
by his clerical associates in the charitable
work, was dedicated as a refuge and home
for parentiess little boys.
These two institutions, side by side, are
iniended to be practically one to the |
orphans, eighty of whom have been trans- I
ferred thither from the original home at i
San Mateo, where accommodations were
not sufficient to the needs of the ever in
creasing family of children, and where
very recently 100 of the litlle inmates
were down with the measles at one time,
causing puch an additional drain upon
the. limited funds that it became almost
imperative, us well as advantageous, to
establish a branch home here. and come
within the immediate reach of kindly in
terested persons and of bequests to City
charitable organizations.
The Qood Samaritan Mission, intended I
as a irce meeiing-piace tor men, as a .â¢â ort
of clubhouse and recreation -rooms lor re
spectable waee-earners, was opened with
religious ceremonies. At 7:30 a. m. the
holy eucharist was celebrated in the
pretty chapel on. the second floor, and
again at 10:45 A. M.
Bishop Nichols conducted the service.
Rev. E. J. Lyon ot St. Stephen's Church
spoke ironi the text, "And a Uood Samar
itan Went That Way," and. Rev. W. jL
Km read ihe morning prayer.
A vested choir composed of thirty little'
boys. from the orphanage and of twenty
little girls in the uniform of the Maria
Kip Orphanage whs an especially sitnili-'
cant anii picturesque feature of the first
religious ceremonies performed at the
new mission building. A well-arranged
musical programme, prepared by Miss
Brown, tbe organiat, was also an agree
able addition to the spirit of the occasion.
In the evening at 7:45 o'clock services |
were conducted by Rev. W. I. Kip, who
has charge oi the mission.
The dedication of the orphanace was
simple and couched in kindly phrases

sugcpstiveof the object of the institution â
â¢ a loving care of young boys who other

Among tha spectators that filled, the
two parlors of the orphanage was a.num
ber of pprsons who take a special interest
in the work of the orphanage.-.
- During his benediction on tbe orphan
age the Bishop said:
"Increase the knowledge and confirm
the fuith in a:l connected with this insti
tution established in thy name and for
thy glory. B ess all the children of the
orphanage and grant that as they grow in
age they may grow in grace. Lead them
in the knowledge and obedience of thy
holy word. Make them dutiful, pure,
truthful and devout. Defend them from
tempt.. tion and from sickness. Grant that
they may he here fitted for good citizen
ship and so faithfully serve thee in those
Btations of life to which it shall please
tiii-e to call them that they fail not to at
tain thy heavenly promises.
"Send down thy Llessings, we beseech
tbee, upon our friends and benefactors,
and so add to their number that the good
designs in this work may be sufficiently
carried into effect."
In his subsequent remark- Bishop
Nichols said: 'i believe that when thÂ»
church and the City wakes up to these
two institution 1 ' they wiil be a constant
pride; indeed they are now a pride. We
see, it seems tome, in these two institu
tions, the Good Samaritan Mission and
the orphanage, the work of God in placing
them side by siae, an exemplification of
what may come from simple and ever
cherished faith in a cau-e to be accom
plished, though its beginning be small in
deed.
"It is a reward of faith. Can there be
anyth:nLÂ» better to inspire future hopes in
such works than just 10 read the record of
the growth of these two institutions from
a little seed of faith planted years ago?"
Rev. W. I. Kip addressed the. boys in
terras of religious and paternal advice
calculated to inculcate studious, manly
and Christian principles. Rev. VViliiam
Brewer followed with some suggestions of
the benefits of the orphanage work looked
at from the point of municipal economy
and at love, a.nd told the boys that he
hoped the time would come when they as
business men imp tit look back and help to
make it possible for other p.arentl.as in
fants to be reared and schooled as they
had been. Â«

Unemployed.
The Larder Is Empty and Scores of
Sick and Destitu'e Families Are
Absolutely Starving-
In t'e vast hall formerly occupied by
the California Club at Howard and New
Montgomery streets, where dance parties
were once held every week, some 430 men
slept last night on tne burd boards with
the roof for covering and their coats for a
pillow.
It was in this hall, too, that the elite of
San Francisco's sporty inclined witnessed
Robert Fitzilmmons' debut in America,
and also tne lirst defeat of "Nonpareil"
Dempsey, paying a good week's wages in
either case for a few tuonientb' pastime. .
Now the hall that was made famous by
society belies us well as sports is the home
of the San Francisco unemployed.
There are 1500 of them in all enrolled
and waiting for honest employment. But
these people- must livÂ« >n tbe meantime.
The provisions that have been contributed
by a few downtown peop.e charitably in
clined have given out â¢ almost entirely.
Yesterday being Sunday the receiving
wagon, drawn about the streets last week
by a hundred men, did not make its ap
pearance, ana tnere are only two sacks of
potatoes. and some dried' apples for the
menu to-day.
Coal is needpd very much.- Without it
to-day the Â£re in the kitchen cannot be
lipnted.no matter what else may be con
tributed for the sustenance of the men.
Mrs. vVniting and M.iss Cary, two noble
women, called at headquarters yesfe'dav
morning, bringing 100 linm sandwicties
and a couple of dczen hard-boiled egg?.
These were greatly appreciated, but nun
dredsof hungry men. eyed with envy the
f. ruinate fellowsto wliom they fell in the
distribution.
.President S. A. Lefflngwell of tbe band
says'his feliowersare stout-hearted. â¢ They
are looking forward to the day when the
bouevard work will be given out. "But,"
said he, "that will not be ip-morrow, and
the immediate is what we most need.
Following the work on the boulevard we
nope to work on the new Postoflice. This
would be a boon indeed, givine, as it
would, employment to all of our people.
"One oi our greatest sorrows does not
appear on the iurface. We hove hundreds
of deserving poor men, women and chil
dren about the City. They are destitute,
and in many cases they . are ill. These
have to T>e cared for first. Since we have
been here, that is in the past week, we
have cared for 137 families out of tne pro
visions that were contributed to us. We
are no longer in a position to do this, as
we are utterly without funds and out of
food."
Mrs. Moore and Mri. Mciiee of the

'.-, The Labor Exchange was yeatcr lay
afternoon addressed by John 8. Clark,
State organizer of the society, and George
Cummins .or: the -Mechanics' ; Institute,
with live-minute speeches by other mem
bers of me society. , , ,;
* Mr. Clark spoke of the requisites of a
legitimate business life, which he held
grew out of the necessities ot the " people.
These requisites ' he named â¢ as: Firstâ
Something to produce I out of. For this
purpose he said the earth complied with
all the requirements. ' " ;>"â¢'â¢ - i
The second requisite he con'uderei the
producers, and these he showed by the
statistics of the unemployed, we had in
abundance." > "There 'iÂ« absolutely only
one other requirement,'.-'; 1 he said,'- Vsonie
thinj: to facilitate the exchange ot com
modities 'i after ; the v : have been , produced
from the earth." The i speaker then : ex
plained the lab >r idea theory of 'aVmoii*
etary system, which is the issuance of
checks representing actual commodities.
This, ; he v held, was , the v solution of the
third requisite. V; :.â ;;:;â¢'>â¢ : -' iV -'->Â«' : -- 'â¢-'â â â 
'it George dimming spoke of the fallacy of
the present so-called competitive system.
He argued that the ; labor-exchange idea
was the rational solution of the social
question.

The Oberon Concert Hall Turn* Crowds
Away.
E. A. Fischer, proprietor of the Oberon
family concert hall, built better than he
knew when he provided that retreat for
the music lovers of San Fraiicisco. Ever
sines the openine nieht the beautifully
finished hall has been filled to overflowing
by intelligent and appreciative audiences.
Hundreds were obliged to go away on
Saturday and last evening through lack
of seating facilities, and thos6 who found
accommodations applauded Herr Stark
und his orchestra warmly and frequently.
As a leader Herr Stark must be ac
knowledged b.)th talented and magnetic,
while his happy faculty in selecting pro
grammes that suit the popular taste haf
been strongly accentuated by the success
of last week's numbers. His violin work
has soul, sentiment and de.icate artistic
finish, and tbe tones of his instrument
sob and rollick, dream and exalt at the
magic touch of his fincfrs. Thio week's
three pronraram's, it i" announced, will
afford an imeresting and pleasing lesson
In judicious selection. A realistic inter
pretation of an Indian war dance will be
given this evening for the first time on the
I'acitic Coas 1 .

DR. ALGER'S SERMON.
Tho Ni>! cil Boston Divine and Author
Hpeaku HefoTe tho Berkeley
Unitarian Society.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 28.â Dr. Wil
liam R. Alger, the noted Boston divine
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
and author, who is to occupy the pulpit of
.the Berkeley â  Unitarian Society for the
present, preached his first sermon this
morning to a large audience. The topic
of his initial address was "The Causes
Why Men Fail in Life."
ltseemed to Dr. Alger that the prime
reason for the failures of men is that they
forget the teachings of the Bible nnd their
duty ;o their felow b-'ines. His whole
sermon may be summed up in these few
words.
ToÂ«laborate his text he. drew from his
tory, philosophy, from pure reason and
from incident-* of, every-day life. He said:
The victim of any sin "who is rrappy in his
vice will not try to extricate himself so long
as he does not see the error of his way, but
once stirred up to Â« realization of his condition
he will rise and shake c.ff his shackles of evil.
In every age tliere have been examples and
models of purity and sinlessness. If we allow
ourselves to settle complacently into a way of
sin and misery it is not because we have not
had a better example set for us in the past.
Power alone is not the standard of worth,
but fidelity also. The humblest man on earth
Ifhe does his best, will have as high a position
in the eyes of God as the most brilliant and
knowing man ihat ever lived to give forth his
wisdom.
Under the pressure of the world man is apt
to choose the way of vice and folly rather than
th^uayof wisdom.
There are multitudes of people' who & r e
satisfied with their position' in life; satisfjed
In being on h level with their neighbors,
while they should for their, best and highest
good, look forward to higher aspirations,- eveu
to infiuitudo. .
If we always remember -what we ought to
remember, we shall never go astray. Never
lament anything which is irretrievably lost.
How.many a premise and supplication to the
Ainiignty have gone up from beds of sickness
and disease, whico have been forgotten when
health was restored.
. .Every defect of memory in general depends
on one of three cause?; the first is a low condi
tion of the Ji ore an J cellular struc-tureof tlie
brain ; the second is the lack of a system < f co
ordination in the intellect; the third is au in
difference as 10 the aptitude of things.

A most remarkab c state el affair's ex

the well-known evangelist who was in
this city some time a^o, and who has a
large number of friends here. A few

that McAllister had commitfed suic at

for confirmation by Mrs. Jennie Were of
this city and sbe received the following

Yes It was Mr. McAllister who killed himself;
He stayed in Ogden qune a while and was up

Oeden. But if so they did not come to see
me. The next I heard of him was that he was
in Salt Lake Uitj actiug queerly af the Walker
Hotel. Afterward he came to Ojjden and sat
on tbe courthouse steps and cut his throat..
He wastaten to the hospital and his throat
was sewed up, and he was getting along nicely
when he took, his bands and tore., his throat
open again. :He was as crazy as possible, talli
ing of going to heaven on a lovely hill covered
with immense trees and peope sitting on the
â boughs. He did not 'know me and eald his

of JDavis' or McAllister's wife. Do you know
where she is living?
Mrs. Were knew where Mrs. McAllister
was staying, and has received a letter con-
I taming tha following:
Well, dear sister, they have gotout an evil
report this time." When 1 lirst read the story
from Oakland primed in the papers 1 was
filled with horror. When I thought that for

ANTI-SALOON CRUSADE.

From a dozen pulpits to-day the crusade
a ainst the saloon was actively carried on.
While over a .score of pastors touched on
tlie matter many devoted their whole ad
dress to the necessity for taking vigorous
action during the coming week.
The matter was placed belore tli^ vari
ous congregations in all its phases, and
probably during the day not less than
8000 people heard the closing of saloons
advocated.
The pastors who gavo the matter their
particular attent.on wre Rev. Drs. Ellin,
Coyle, Chapman, Kummer and Revs. S.
8. Palmer, .hunes Small, Philip Graif, C.
M. Hill and C. H. Hobart.
This af;ernooii there was a largely at
tended meeting at the Y. M. C. A. Hall
auditorium. Many of the pastors made
addresses, and the young men pledged
themselves to further the campaign by all
the means in their power.
C. H. Hobart. chairman of the commit
tee that appo:nled the campaign commit
tee of fourteen, clearly outlined the stand
of the anti-saloon party.
"We have arrived ai a period when we
have to fight," said he. 'â¢'lbis campaign
is not a political one; it is a moral one,
and it has been forced upon us. We have
been controlled and governed by the
saloon men long enough, ana now we
must liberate ourselves. Our city has
been rnled from the back rooms of saloons
and our rights have been trampled upon,
and now we are cowards if we do not light
back. We can get alon;; without jne sa
loons, and if the majority do not want
them they will have to tro."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 1, 1897.
WHO INFORMED
SENATOR FRYE?
Evidently Some Influence
Against Oakland at
Washington.
Merchants Gad Politics Are to
Have a Long Rest After
Monday. .
More Truths Than. Thosa From the
P.atform Uttered at Mr..
Henry's Banquet.
Oakland Office Pan Fkaxcisco Cam,,)
908 Broadway, Feb. '28. J
Those merchants who have been tight
ing for the improvement of the water
front were considerably surprised on Fri
day to see a- dispatch from Washington,
statinp that Sena.tor Frye had made the
.argument that the appropriation- for fin
ishing the harbor was jiot justified by the
accruing benefits to commerce. Senator
Frye's informant, whoever he is, certainly
knows nothing of Oakland harbor, or else
had a motive in misinforming the Sen
ator.
' Thie harbor has been bnt : partially deep
ened and there are- but few wharves, yet
in spite of these disadvantages more ship
pine has. attempted to come at times thah
could be accommodated. A few months
ago heavy investments were made at the
foot of Oak street and spacious wharves
and modern coal-bunkers were huilt.
They have b?en in active operaiion ever
since they were completed and contracts
are now been drawn for additional wharf
age. â¢ â¢ .
This same spirit will certainly animate
property-owners all along the front when
the harbor is completed, and with the de
velop-nienls at Coml Hollow, which un
doubtedly contemplate a terminal in this
city, there can be no argument advanced
that the appropriation for deepening the
channel will not be a useful and wise ex
penditure.
One week more of agony and merchants
and politicians can alike rejoice. For
several months every thing has been dis
organized by various political campaigns,
and the ordinary merchants as well'as the
active poliilcian see eighteen months of
peace after next Monday. Oakland is a
city of parts, and each part is sacred unto
ilseif. To unite them socially, religi
ously, poluicaliy'or commercially is a task
worthy the ambition of her best-citizens.
Many iiave tried : it and failed, and have
gone down with their failure.
â¢ At this particular time this disunion of
elements is more apparent than ever, and
.smart .indeed is the man who knoweth
where he standeth. During the coming,
â¢week the experience of a iar r e number of'
citizens will be positively painful. Al
though many care not a fig for politics
they are driven into positions where they
must take a hand one way or the other,
â¢and t-hey are continually ftudying how to'
extricate ttiem-elvea from the dilemma.
As a matter of 'act probably not one
hundred votes will De changed from the
present intention of the voters during the
whole ol next week, yet there will oe the
usual turmoil of speeches, lectures, secret
circulars and all the unhealthy excitement
so paralyzing to business that is attend
ant to a municipal campaign.
After the election all Oakland will thank
the Deity that politics and politicians have
adjourned.
There was a free-for-all banquet last
night at the Henry House. Xhe owner is
running as an independent candidate for
Mayor, which office he once filled very ac
ceptably before he was quite -*o rich as he
is now. The repast was served by ladies
and it was greatly enjuyed. Many score
of honest workingmen partook of the
good things and were sincere in thanking
Mr. Henry for his generosity. Then came
the campaign meeting, presided over by
Colonel J. P. McE;rjy-. late president of
the Army and Nivy Republican League.
He was assisted by Oregon Banners. Colo
nel Tom Pearson and C. Felix Lafon, who
made speeches.
Colonel Pearson, the colored . orator,
stated that be was- fond of Mr. Henry
"because he is a man easy to the approach
of all classes," and prophesied tnat he
would "receive a majority next Monday
that will astonish tho natives from
Siskiyou to San Dego." .
The bajquet was all right, so were the
speeches, but the â¢ two together were
deceptive. There was quite a crowd, but
not one-fourth will vote for A. C. Henry.
Several veterans were present, who are as
loyal- to Captain Thomas, the Republican
candidate, as his own lami y. The ban
quet drew a crowd, but tho comments in.
the audience differed widely from the
lemarks ut ered on the piatiorm, and t:je.
whole affair wil be remembered as one of
the greatest jokes of the campaign.

HOW SHALL THE
MONEY BE SPENT?
This Question Now Con
fronts the Faculty and Re
gents of the University.
Demands for Assistance Come
From All Departments, Es
pecially the Scientific.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 28.â Now that
the long anticipated and much needed ap
propriation for the State University haa
been made and the din of loud rejoicing
is dying away the regents and faculty are
confronted with the problem as to where
and how their new allowance shail be
spent to tho best advantage. In April,
when thÂ« lirst tax levy ol the year be
comes dv?, one-half of the additional rev
enue of $ 120,000 will be available, and then
in October, 'when the last payment comes
in, the remaining $60,000 will beat the dis
posal of tho university. Tie immediate
needs of the institution are so great that
it is a difficult matter to determine where
to begin and bow far to go in the expendi
ture of the money.
More instructors are necessa.ry, new
equipment is required, and os a conse
quence of these two needs new buildings
must be had in order to accommodate the
new teaching lores and the added ap
para.tus. To bring matter* to a focus
President Kellogg has issued a circular
requestiug each head, professor to submit
a statement of the actual needs of his de
partment as regards instruction room and
apparatus.
In reviewing the situation the president
has this to Â«uy :
In the first place, there needs to be a large
i-ncrease of the number of instructors! Tne
faculty was none too large in 1890. In 1896
it has not doubled, but the number of studeuts
has more than trebled. To have- kept'nace
with the growth- of the classes the teaching
staff should be at least one-half larger than it
is. This means that we ought to appoint some
fifty or more instructor's. If they received -but
if 1000 a year the increase would absorb $50,
--000. very nearly as much as the allotted half
cent will give us. But we want many men
wno roust receive more than $1000, as all
school boards must know which cannot get a
head-master for anything like that amount.
Fifty men will be appointed as an addition
to our lorce; we shall still be short-handed in
importrnt deDmtments of . Instruction. I
could name a dozen places that ought to be
filled, but which must go beggiug for many
years to .come.
A prosperous university Is always in need of
new instruction. The modern methods of in
struction are more and more exacting. Espe
cially is it true that the natural sciences de
mand more time, more space, a greater labor
atory equipment, and of Course more and more
expert instructors.
Half of the new appropriation is to go for
buildings and other permanent improvements.
The need of all these can be seen with haif a
glance. Our buildings have not increased for
the last six years. Iv 1890 they were well
filled? in 1897 they arc over and over and
over lull. The same space as before and three
times as many students.
We need many new classrooms right away.
The new instructors who do come in cannot
be accommodated in the rooms, that are now
"fuller than Tucker's gun." The young
women -are deplorably lacking in suitable
quarters. ' The gymnasium is altogether in
sufficient for alltheclastesin physical culture.
â  The military department has for years been
cal ins loudly for more space. The chemical,
physical, botanical And biological laboratories
are all overcrowded. Drawing and industrial
arc are miserab.y cramped. These are not
half of our Immediate needs.
But are wo riot promised fine buildings by
Mrs. Hearst and others? Very true, but their
plans rnnture slowly, and wo caunot wait for
their execution/ If a few fine buildings are
put up they will be specially devoted to a few
uses, and most of the departments willgtili be
left in the lurch.
Tho half cent- allotted for "permanent im
provements" will not t.uild' many buildings
worthy to take (heir places in the "grand
plan." But if will help us out of our worst
difficulties and carry us along till other gener
ous benefactors shall add their monumental
gifis.
Too much money? Ohl we want a great
deal more. But tuis is what we asked, and our '
thanks are due to the representatives of the
people who have so generously met the wants
of tneir university.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
A Slight Improvement Is
Noted in the Busi
ness.
Some Important Sales in City
and Country Property
Effected.
The Torrens Land System as Adpted
Throughout Australia, N w Z a
land and British Columbia.
More general and genial- demand for prop
erty has characterized the real estate market
during the past week or two thap has been the
cage for a similar period during several
months. This Is shown in the number of
transactions of greater or less magnitude, and
not only in this, but also in the improvement
o.f suburban locations Is a better feeling mani
fested. Last month business may properly be
considered good in the light of what has gone
before In the summer and au umn months,
and from present indications and reports the
future will furnish evidence of inherent
strength in the situation fuliy as conclusive.
The majority of transactions denote the pur
chases are made for a strictly pure investment, '
the market being almost devoid of the ele
ments of speculation, except perhaps for
property in certain locations bordering on the
extensions of recently constructed electrrc
roads. But there Is nothing, tangible upon
which-to base this assertion, which is only
the expressed opinion of the dealers in this
class of property.
The Torrens land bill now before the Assem
bly has created much adverse criticism among
real estate brokers. The majority of them,
however, believe that if the bill is passed it
will establish a system that will when once
in full operation put an end to all uncertainty
in regard to land titles. The lollowing Is a
brief description of the Torrens land system
of the transfers of realty.:
The registry of land according to the Tor
rens system, which has been adopted-tnrough
out Australia, New Zealand and British Co
lumbia, clears all fair and hot est titles, re
moves all existing clouds and gives the occu
pant wnose title passes the examination
indt-ieasible posbessio'u, and at the same line
rendering the futuro transfer or conveyance
of the land as bimpleend as ready as the trans
fer of a share of railway or factory stock now
is in this country, and reduces the cost of con
veyance to a very small sum.
in Australia the method of procedure is de
scribed as follows:
Under the Torrens land transfer system the
Government guarantees an indefeasible title.
One of the essential features ol this lend trans
fer is the creation of nn officer terme 1 Regis
trar of .Tit es, with judicial power to pass
finally and cojclusively upon lue title to land,
not only upon the. original application for
bringing it within the provisions of the act
but also upon subsequent transfer or trans'
mission of said property.
The person in whom the fee is claimed to be
vested m:iy, apply to have the land placed in
the registry of ti le's. These applications, to
gether with the deeds, evidences and abstracts
of title, accompanied hy plans ol the land, are
submitted for examination to v barrister and
to ii conveyancer, who are styled examiners of
titles, uho examine the titie ext ctly as they
would on' bebal of an linemlins,' purchn.-er,
if the title were not to.be registered. The re
port of the examination is then reported to
the Registrar, li the title is a good holding
the application is admitted and otherwise re
jected.
Ii there Is evidence of a title wanting, of
'which the owner can compel completion, no
tices correapoudlng in many respects to those
n quired by our Probate Couns ac served,
according to ihe nature of the case, on any
person l.ikely to be interested in law or equity
wtio has not joined in the application, n â  <"l
upon owners . and occu-iers of contiguous
lands. These notices set forth the purport of
the application, and intimate that unless ob
jections are made by lodging a caveat witMn
the time prescribed by the Registrar the land
will be brought under the provision of the act
and an rndef^asible title granted to the appli
cants. If within the time a caveat is lodged,
the action of th* Registrar is suspended until
the caveat is withdrawn or uutil a final judg
ment of the Supreme Court can be obtained
upon the question raised. The .notices are
given by publication and are complete and
final.
The certificates of title are 'lssued in dupli
cate. They set forth the nature of the estnte of
the applicant with a fee simple or a. limited
ownersnip; they notify by memorial? in
dorsed, ail lesser estates, leases, charges, ease
ments, rights or other interests current or
affecting tne land at that time.
Applicants are not put to the expense o?.put
ting the parapheDalia 6f acoirtof justice in
motion uiik-ss there ue some adverse claim to
be adjudicated upon.
It is claimed for this system that the wealth
of the country is added to by restoring
many blocks of land which might have b'-eu
deprived of tuis special value by technical de
fects and uncertainties attaching titles.
The rules in respect to the registration of
mortgages are also simple.

EXCITING RACING
ALONG THE FRONT
Whitehall Boatmen Have
a Spirited Contest
for Prizes.
â * : '
; The Gypsies Came Back From
â¢â¢â¢â¢ San Mateo, but Were Sent
;â¢:"'..â  ,;. ':â  to Oakland. - â¢â¢â¢ v
Sergeant Mahoney I? Determined to
Keep Them Off the Front and ;
â¢â¢â¢â¢ ' Out of San Francisco.
The sailing race between tbe boatmen
along the front yesterday was a very
pretty one as far as the first four white
hails were concerned. Dan Crowley, the
popular wharfinger at sections 1 and 2.0 i
the seawall, was judge, and he awarded
the first prize to Thomas Hayden, the
second to Dave Crowley Jr., and the third
toGus O'Connell, while James' Sennett
was fourth. Tbomas Lyons and John
.â¢/Fit z^e'rajd were beaten by over a mile,
â â  but then both the .men fieure&.on wiji
.': ning the last prize. Neither of tbe men
â¢. Ihbusslit they had a chance to beat the
â  : - four cracks, so each of them unbeknown
â¢'..to the other tied a tin can to tbe bo i torn
â¢ "-of liis boat.. The prize for the last boat is
, a'keg of beer, and at dark last night it
V .lookedas though fttzgerald would win it.
â¢ . .' ; The race irom/M-eiggs whart to Blossom
' .Rock buoy was a pretty one. Hayden
. .was around first, while Gus O'Connell and
; : janies Sennett passed around at the same
..moment. Senneit made far the better
-..turn, however; and was straightened
" .away on his course nearly five seconds
â¢ â ahead of .his rival. .From Blossom Rock
: to the presidio sboal all the boats made
â¢ . .good time, but on the beat back Hayden
â [â  fiiaihe'd a. .decided advantage and finally
â¢~. won' easily* â 
'â¢' ' â " :The fan^ral of .the late Sergeant Fitz
'â .'gibbon- of the harbor police takes place
â¢'â¢from 524 Fell street at 9:45 a. m. to-day.
.The pall-bearers will be Corporal Robert
. .â â¢CockraU,' Officers Ferguson, 1 Dower, Flem
ing, . uanohoe, Alahoney, . Mackey and
.; Cam tenon. All the men' will Oe in plain
' â¢â  cjotbes'.and there will' "be no uniformed
.â poiice' escort; as the relatives want the
.(.â¢.â proceedings to be a? simple as possible.
â¢ â  All t-hp laic sergeawt's papers were found
â â¢â â¢ in his Jocker in the Harbor police station
'â¢"â¢". by; Captain Dunleavy. In his will lie
.'. leaves ah his property, real and personal,
..to .liis two daughters, share and share
; 'alike. Owing, to the deoreciation in real
: .-estate it is thought that Sergeant Fitz
:.- < ibbon'is' not nearly as weajthy iÂ»s was at
' fi/st supposed. Those jvho ciaim to know
say thai-he died worth less than $20,Qu0.
â "â  : ; â â  The sure-thing gamblers did a smart
piecedf business on the front yesterday.
Tiiey were equipped with a piece of beard
..Von which squares were markeu. One
'â - square caiied lor half a dollar, another for
'â  ' 25 cen.ts, one for 10 ceni.3 and all the
other?, Save three, for a ci^ar. A revolv
ing wheel with a pointer attached showed
what prize was won, and in order to play
. â¢ the game 10 cents had to be put up.
:'â  A youni; watchmaker named Heinreich
Koh:i, employed by Snreve & Co., got in
terested in tue game and what wnh the
money he put up on thf machine and the
. side bet he made with the capper, he was
: out ?IS~ When all i.is money was gone ha
came to-.the couclusion that he had been
swindled and demanded restitution. The
â  runner of the machine and tne capper had
a conferenca and the former said he would
*have to go around tbe corner for a few
minutes, but on his return would do the
fair -thing. Wiien the few. minutes were
up the capper took the wheel off the book
and also 'disappeared around the corner,
leaving, the young jeweler with a table
and part of a box of cigars valued by Ser
gennt Mahoney at 25' cents to show for his
â  $18. At the Harbor police station he said
â¢'. He had been ei^ht years in San Francisco
â¢ .and the poiice are still wondering how
many years it wiil take a man to learn the
ways, of confidence men. Kohn had tears
in his eyes when he lold of the manner in
â  which he had been victimized, outall Ser
gean.t Mahoney could do for him was to
yend him to the police courts to procure a
John Doe warrant.
He gave a good description ot the men
and the police thins they know the
couple. The young man. took hia piece of
Itoard and box of cigars away with him,
as'ne.iusisted upon ha vine something to
sh,ow tor his $18 5.0 wJien he got home."
The gypsies' who were driven out of
Mill Valley and tuen out of SanÂ«alito are
having ji hard tinjp of it. They stole
everything in Mill Valley they could lay
their hands on and tore up the fences for
firewood. In Sausalito they were tol
erated for a. time but finally got orders to
move on. Then they came to San Fran
â  Cisco ana made ah attempt to get away on
the steamer Australia for Honolulu, but,
as they could not raise the necessary $500,
they had to stay behind and the HarDor
Police at once hustled them back to their
last resting place. At last Sausalito got
up in arm's and two constables Gathered
up t-he wanderers and made them pack
their belongings in their carta and, plac
ing bag and baegage on the Sausalito
ferry brought them to San Francisco.-
Then the Harbor Police again took a hand
â¢ in the matter and ordered the crowd to
move Out of the City as quickly as possible.
The who:e outfit was packed into eight
wagons and the. leader of mo ganc said
they were going to the Santa Clara Valley.
To make sure that they crossed the
boundary line a mounted policeman was
sent along to show them the way. They
were not long in San Mateo County be
fore the constable tooK them in charge
and escorted them back to San Francisco.
The constable in Sausalito heard of it
and he stood guard over the Sausalito.
and Tiburon ferries to see that they did
not get on any of the ferry boats running
to those points, so Sergeant Mahoney
was in a quandary. T.e gipsies still in
sisted that they wanted to reacn the
Banta Clara Valley, sothe|police put them
on the creek route steamer and shipped
them to the foot of Seventh and Broad
way. Sergeant Mahoney is now guessing
about the number of days that will elapse
before they are back on his hands again.
The handsome big modei of the crack
cruiser Charleston that has been in the
Merchants' Exchange for a number of
years is missing. It was wanted to help
out the California exhibit at the exposition
in the City of San Jose de Guatemala and
Captain Shotwell, manager of the Ex-
Change, finally agreed to let it go. After
Hie exposition it will be returned to its old
quarters in the west end of tbe meeting
room.
Jack Meyers had a narrow escape yester
day. He was taking $7 worth of pies out
to the battleship Oregx>n, and when step
ping into his Whitehall it capsized. He
was soon the center of fourteen dozen of
assorted delicacies, but when he attempted
to scramble into the boat she turned over
on -top of him. Finally ha made his
escape by diving, ana was hauled ashore
by Harry Harmwn, who, was to have gone
out in the boat with him. The crew oi
the Oregon had no pies for supper last
night, and the boatmen will have a lively
time of it explaining -matters when they
go out to-night.

REVIVALS.
Sunday Evening Sermons by Bey- Wil
liam liader at the Third Congre
gational Church.
Rev. W. Rader, preaching last evening
at the Third Congregational Church, said
in part:
The revival in politics Is sometimes called
revolution; in letters a renaissance, as in the
Elizabethan period; in nature.is called spring,
when new life seizes the hidden roots of things
and clothes the hllis in green ; in religion, it 'is
culled revival. In all these conditions is the
common principle of a new life entering into
the old conditions.
1 believe in a genuine revival .of genuine
religion. When truth becomes epidemic taen
are moved in the mass and s\yept along in the
deep currents of popular feeling. Revivals
hp.vfc broken up formalism, as at Pentecost
when God came down in power amonr the
people, and in England when the Oxtord
student*, under t^ e direction of the Wesleys,
shoojk the established cJiurcb. and in New
England, under Jonathan Edwards, when the
lea -Of formalism was broken by his fervor;"
They have been pioneers 01 a deeper spiritual
life.
The chief concern of the church should not
be for tnose who come to revival meetinp s,
but for those who do not. People always go
to revivals, and they are usually confined to a
definite class. The church must appeal to the
top of society as well as to the bottom. We
have fallen into the bed htibit of scolding thÂ«
skeptic, while we-dewte our attention to sav
ing the lost. We tliiiik of the doubter as being
wron; in his theology, an.l there is no man
whom we despise so much as a man who lias a
wrong opin.on. We need ministers and evan
gelists who are able to present in a rational
way Christianity to these people. Ttic pro
found scholar is as valuable aa the corrupt
harlot. ...
\te need a revival of righteousness, of po
litical, social and industrial character. The
real test of a revival of religion is not the
number gathered into the ctiurch, or (he num
ber who put their names upon cards, but the
contribution which is made to the honesty,
purity and integrity oi the community. Re
vivals must make men. more; honest in busi
ness, more pure, in society'aud more brotherly
if they are to maintain their place. We need
a revival 01 character. Religion is emotion
translated into manhood and womanhood.
Unless it is so translated, it is an ' unpolished
diamond.
Tnere are three things to be taught.in a re
vival; first, the authority and power of the
woid of God. This must "be set forth with in
telligence and common sense; second, the
divine nature and redemptive power of Jesus
Christ. The most important thing that is to be
explained to-day to the thinking world is the
meaning of salvation through Christ; third,
the sense of sin and the place sin has in human
life. ' â¢ â¢ '

Speedy Actlpn Important. ',' ;
Judge E. A. Belcher of the Superior
Courtâ Speedy action on the part -of those I
who have charge of this wort, is most im
portant. , The substructure ought to bo
put in at once so that it may havo time to
settle before the suporstructure is erected.
Every practical person must see the rea- j
son for this. There can.be ;no dispute in
regard. to the plans for the substructure,
and as it would require the expenditure of
a vast amount of -labor it could be pro
ceeded with while the plans for the upper I
portion of the buiiaing are being com-, '
pleted,. should that be deemed necessary. !
One of the weighty arguments offered in
favor of the location and one that' proved
victorious over all opposition was thac it
would afford excellent accommodation to
the public. For one thing the Federal
courts are now located in an out-of-the- j
way part of the City as regards the. : .'mass j
of the people' of the. City." In the- new !
Postoffice building they would be hioro
accessible, not only to lawyers, but to the I
public in general. When that change iÂ»
made all the courts will be close together
and the legal affairs of the community
will be in better and more convenient
shape. The Postofnce is now on Wash
ington street, and though we nave plenty
of elegant mailcars on our streets not one
of those mailcars can reach the main Post
cilice because there is no proper road. for
them to traverse in that direction. Â° o When,
the new PoÂ«toffice is finished every . mail
car in the City can be switched to it for
loading and unloading, thus greatly ac
celerating the transaction of toe business
of the postal authorities. , Â°'\ ..' ";Â»â¢â" â¢.â¢'.â¢â¢
It Is Hltfh Time.
Judge Frank H. Dunne of the Superior
Court said: "I think it high time that
the new Postoffice should be begun, at
least so tnat the people might hope for its
completion within a reasonable period.
We who are of the younger generation of
course expect to see the foundation com
pleted. But is it right to deny this pleas
ure to the pioneers also? I think not. It
seems to me tnat if anything is ever going
to be done now is the time to make a
start."
Ought to BÂ«gin at Once..
Deputy District Attorney A. P. Blackâ
First and ioremost, the work on the new
Postoffice onfjbt to begin at once in order
to give work to the army of unemployed
men who are looking for something to do.
The excaration of the lot would afford
employment to avast number of diggers
and shovolers and teamsters and the like.
I say this without feeding that anything I
may say will do much good, as 1 have
found that complaints of this kind are not
generally heeded at headquarters. The
trouble, I suppose, is that the red tape of
the departments at Washington has be
come entangled in some way ancj that no
man big enouch for the job has attempted
to untangle it. Our Congressmen and
Senators ought to be able to explain why
the work is thus delayed.
Entitled to Better Treatment.
Judge J. V. Coffey of the Superior
Court â Possibly ihecentlemen having this
Postoftice matter in charge have applied to
some court for a continuance. That is the
usual manner of procedure where un
necessary delay is desired by derelict
officers of the court or the Government.
The pernicious habit of putting off the
work that ought to be done at once has
undoubtedly been at the bottom of this
unreasonable postponement. 1 think San
Francisco is entitled to better treatment.
The work ought to be commenced im
mediately.
Must Be Some Explanation,' â¢
Supervisor Rivers â We do not get the
Postoffice. That is true, and there must
be some explanation. There should be
some way to reach the head of the trouble.
If no effort is made we will not have the
Postoftice for a long time. Therefore it is
necessary to make the effort without
further preliminaries or waste of time. . I
cannot imagine who has held back 'the
work 'solone.
â¢ â¦ 1
No Excuse for Delay.
Dr. D;B.. Plvraire said: "There is ev*Â»ry
reason way the building'of- this.structure
should be comraencedat once and flushed
to oompletion.. I understand that the ap
propriation is available, $nd there can be
no excuse for the dilatory tactics pursued
by the authorities at Washington. The
people have a right to expect prompt ac
tion en the Jpart of public officials. lam.
glad that:tns Call has taken ap this
matter in order that it may give citizens
an opportunity to voice their indignation
at the injustice that is being, perpetra ted.
MISS MAY ROBESON and FRANK NORRIS, Two of the i
Amateur Performers in the Society Comedy of "Ca^te,"
Which Has a Strange Story Connected With Its Preparation.
I do not know who is to .blame, but who
ever it is must bear the censure and criti
cism that belong to them for dereliction
of duty. I suppose ii is difficult to reach
such people as have the management of
governmental construction affairs; yet I
think that even they may be stirred up to
proper action by Jetting them know that
the people are impatient because their
rights are denied t em."
The Site Is Unsightly.
Judge Carroll Cook of the Superior
Court â We have had a Postoffice site so
long that it has become unsightly. Of
course, there can be no good reason for the
tardiness of the Government officials. The
contest over the location was altogether
improper. I know every inch of that
neighborhood; used to travel over it every
day when I was a schoolboy and lived out
on Mission street. That part of the coun
try never was a. swamp. It came down
pretty steep toward the little late in that
vicinity, and was solid ground; but that â 
is all fait. The ait 9 lvi- be-en accepted
and all legal opposition has been over
came. Now th*. people demand that the-
Government officers perform their duty.
I think this demand is reasonable, and it
seems to me that an expression of public
s'entirnentin this regard will be beneficial
in securing some action, I join the rest
of the people of this City in hoping so, at
least. â -:'â¢'â  â¢ -.' â  .
San Francisco In Earnest.
supervisor -iiackmao â Ihere is so much !
idleness here that the Government ought
to be able- to' find iii that an argument .for
speed in beginning wort 6n the new Post
office. â  The old- Postoffice is decidedly ont
of date and is something of a retic. All
the representative bodies of San F ranci/cd
should pass appropriate, resolutions, the
Board of Supervisors being first. The de
lay has been long and unreasonable.
There is no qjuestio.i that we are entitled
to protest. No"vr, let the protest be made
with so much vigor that . it will appear
that San Francisco is very much in
earnest. - .
"Build It at Once."
City and County. Auditor Broderick â
Build the Postomce at on'oe. That is tfte
proper thing to do. There are many rea
sons for immediate action and none
against. .Too much money has been in
vested by the Government in the site to
permit it to remain idle. Public senti
ment should uprise and'demand that the
building be constructed. Hundreds of
persons, skilled, and. unskilled, would be
employed on the building. We had bet
ter sell the site for a recreation ground or
make U a part if a Poatoffice fs not to be.
built upon it.
â â â¦ â¢ .
Should Kick Hard.
Deputy County Clerk William A. Deaneâ
The only thing so far as I can- see is for
the people to make a great. big. kick and
do all that is possible to draw attention to
our need for the new Poatoliice-. â¢'â  Some
people seem to think that it will not do
any good, but we can't tell till we try, as
Lord Bacon would say, for yoii know he
lays it down as a rule that there is a vast
difference between losing for the lack of
effort and losing after making an hone-t
attempt. In the second instance we have
wasted " only a small amount of human
labor, while in the former case we have
lost the vast possibilities that might have
grown out of a manly striving' for tne'en-.
forcementoi our rights. At any rate we
have had our say and that is some satis
faction.. â¢
Why It isDeserved.
Attorney William M. Fitz -.Maurice â
San Francisco is a very large contributor
to the revenuesof the Federal, treasury. I
think it is the third in ihe list of the ports
of entry, a-nd the' internal revenue coliec- .
tions are also extensive. Now, in. view of
these facts it is only reasonable for. toe
Government to use proper diliseftce in'
constructing the new Postpftice. The.
funds have been appropriated .'by- Con
gress, there is no dispute, about the site
and I think; work should' begin at once.
The money thus expended- would afford
relief to the unemployed-men of this com
munity and . through them jrould. per
meate all the channels of trade .'and bring
better times to everybody. ' '_â¢â ' !
â  View of a Detectlve. : â '. 'V I
Detective Seymourâ It is about time for.
the Government to begin operations on
the proposed Postoffice. . That would be a
good beginning for the promised era o{
prosperity, and- I am sure . it would be
hailed with delight by' the hundreds of
men here now who afe oat' of- employment

when she sees'her mifk andsoaked bread,
and she. has the reguJation shrill protest

."Nanny" is what the Maria Rip Or
phqnage people have decided to call fi.e
babe, hereafter. That charitable institu
tion over which Sister Anna presides has
secured the waif, and In lieu of any other
rrame the young miss lias been given the
one she uttered herself. '
Miss Nanny is accredited with twelv-e
mo.n:hs of sunshine and sorrow.and she is
the youngest pensioner In the institution.
Next to her comes Miss Hazel, who is her
senior by eight, months,, a sedate young
laay who. first welcomed the newcomer,
but who subsequently yelled a protest
when the little red-headed doll was faken
from her to soothe the weeping Nanny.
But if these young buds fail to agree there
are. ninety-three other children at the or*

Miss Lucy Brown and Miss May Brogi,

She is far more panitd to gentlemen than

that she has in her the promise of being a
clever member of her sex.
"Howcoulii a mother ever abandon such

STRANGE FATALITY

Peculiar Incidents of Some

The Comedy of "Caste" Has Its
Behind - the â¢ Scenes
Story. .
To-Night the Play Will; Be Presented
at the California to a Society
Audience.
â  â . â â^ â ,
Associated- with the society company of
amateurs that is to present "Caste"- to
night at the California Theater are some
remarkable incidents that approach ro
mance in. their strangeness.
When society folk, as- they intend to do,
:-b.ali have assembled in force before the
footlights to witness the performance,
they will have in the jer-sons of the differ
ent actors subjects for as much attention,
perhaps, as will be aroused by the char
acters and the development of the charm
ing little corned}' itself.
To the part ot the. hero of the piece a
-ml fatality has been attached. The first
one' who trained for it was Arthur Ma
thieu. A few weeks ago his father died
suddenly, andeven while the funeral ser
vices were being periormed oyer her hus
band Mrs. Mathieu passed away. The
son, thus strangely bereft ot both pa
rents at once, was lost to a happy com
pany, saddened through sympathy wiih
one of the jolliest andmost capable of its
members. â¢ ' â¢
Tnen, too, there will be the humorous
Cuartes Dickman, who is afready well
known to Bohemians as a clever enter
tainer and character artist. .He will d"o
i tie part of the inefficient' Eccies' father,
who is alwaysout of employment and usu
ally half drunu'lrom cboice.-
There is Frank Norris, who. in himself
is a unique character. Before he entered
the University of California he had pub
lished abook of his own verse, and during
his college days at Berkeley- he was.ideu
t !i-d with- different dramatic entertain-
ments given by Skull and Keys and by
society fo.lk- in Oakland and in this City.
He also wrote a good deal for' the cojlegrj
publications and .contributed a numoer
of short stories to San- .Francisco weeklies.
From. Berkeley he went --io Harvard'
University, where he' remained a- year.
Subsequently he was engaged in literary
work he,re for some time, until n* little over
a year ago,, when he visited Johannes
burp, South Africa, as specfal correspond
ent fqr several. Eastern papers-ahd one on.
this 'coast. During the trip he â  was
reported lost and beyond the nower of
anxious relatives in this City to locate him
by cable.' An early training in art in
Paris enahled him to illustrate his own
articles^ During the past year he has been
connected with the Wa-ve as a special
writer.- .
"Caste" is a comedy of .a melodramatic
nature. As its name' suggests; it lias to
do with situations, and complications re
sulting from iove.making between repre
sentatives of two ennrely differein ranks
'in English socierty.

ALL SING IN ITALIAN.
The Philharmonic Society Ap
plaudwd in "II Tro
. vatore."
A Very Enthusiastic Audience Rains
F.owers and Applausa on
the Performers.
"II Trovatore" has always been one of
the most successful operas in the reper
toire of the Italian Philharmonic Society,
and last night the .company revived this
ever green Verdi opera at the Baldwin
Theater. An enthusiastic following of
friends of the singers and fellow-members
of the Italian colony were present, and
flowers and applause were lavished on the
performers.
. Miss Ida Valeria had been especially
encaged fox the role of Leonora and her
absolute security both in the vocal score
and In the rjcena made her a tower of
strength to some. of her less tried and ex
perienced companions. She sansr with
her usual artistic verve and finish and her
work all through "II Trorntore" gave the
perlormance a professional cachet, which
had a good-deal to do with the enthusiasm
displayed Dy tiie audience. '
Siunor L. Giorgi, who formerly was
prirno tenore assclutoof the Philharmonic
Society, has been restored to that position,
and last night sarig the title role of the
unfortunate foundling, whose woei Verdi
has told to su.ch popular music. With all
his faults the Philharmonic audiences
love Giorgi still. They overlook bis little
aberrations from the true pitch, his littLe
harshnesses of tone here and there, for the
sake of his exuberant enthusiasm and the
utter abandonment with which lie throws
himself into his roles.
Signor Gior-i, in a suit of glistening
armor, with a white plume that Henry of
Navarre might have coveted, wns an in
spiring figure. He made love to Leonora,
kept the center of the stag* and bid deri
ance to the fell Count di Luna with the
spirit of a true primo tenore assoiuto, and
the--aii(liÂ« > nee appreciated me fact.and ap
plauded him to the echo.
â  Mrs. E. Cuneo McLean looked exceed
ingly picturesque as Azucena and ac ed
with the tragic intently ot an artist rather
than an amateur. In the jyric part 01 the
role she was hampered by the fact that her
voice is a light mezzo- Soprano rather than
a dramatic contralto, put her histrionic
skill caused her to triumph over this fact
it she had the voice as sne has the histri
onic ability Mrs. McLean could be a <Teat
artist. â¢
Sig-.ior C. Zapelli won applause for the
spirited way in which he threw himself
into the Count di Luna's rol*. C. Vitalini
sang very satisfactorily as Ferranuo, Uie
basso.
The choruses, which are so prominent a
feature of the Philharmonic Society's per
formances, were not quite up to tneir
usual efficiency. The attack, especially,
was not so good as usual ; the volume of
sound, however, w.as lull and resonant in
the anvil chorus, which had evidently
been well retiearsed. The choristeia did
very good .work.
Protessor A. Spadina conducted very
efficiently and succeeded in controlling his
orchesfra so that none of the leading-sing
ers were -overweighted by the orchestral
score.- The picturesque way in which "11
Trovatore" was mounted reflected great
Credit on the Atagp management.
