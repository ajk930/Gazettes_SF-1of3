President McKinley Turns
Over the Distribution to

WARD IINE SHIP FURNISHED
FR~E OF CHARGE.
The Spanish G wurnment Afraid to
Bring Up the Question of Re
mitting Customs Taxes.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 25.â After
discussing with the Cabinet the matter of
devising means for distributing relief to
suffering Americans in Cuba ;he Presi
dent took positive action this afternoon by
turnine the whole matter over to the com
missary department of the army under
directions of the Secretary of War.
Ttie general opinion was expressed at
the meeting that the appropriation would
not be sufficient to meet the demands any
lenptfi of time. a<l2oo \mericans need im
mediate relief, ana it is httely the Presi
dent will nave to ask for more money.
Ttio meeting ot the American consular
ollicers iÂ« to be held at Havana to-ruorrow
to consider the means of making an effec
tive campa : gn of relief, and the result of
tuis exchange of views will be telegraphed
to the State Depar meat.
Comnwary-General Sullivan had a
talk with Secretary Alger about purchas
ine food and other necessities, and will
set to work at once to carry out the Wishes
of the President. R. A. C Smith and
Colonel John J. McCoofc o' New York tc
day tendered to the Government one of
the Ward line vessels for use in transport
ing Hour and orovifeions 10 Cuba. The
generous offer was accepted at once. The
hip win carry food, clothing, medicines,
etc., and will tie used to convey destitute
Americans v,tio desire to leave the conn
try, bmith said the vessel would be at
the disposal of the State Department at
auy time.
Though assurances have been received
that Spain would co-operate in the distri
bution of supplies, it is now learned that
unties will probably be levied on them.
The question of remitting the duties had
not occurred to the Span ish Government,
whose idea was that the supplies would
b.- purchased in Cuba and not in the
United States, and be furnished to needy
American-, under the direction of Consul-
General FeÂ« at Havana and Consul Hyatt
at Santiago.
In both of these officials Spain has con
fidence, but other consular officers are
suspected of sympathy and even collu
sion with the insurgents, and the Madrid
and Havana authorities did not want
them to have a band in giving out the
supplies. They are afraid the pro-
Cuban Consuls would furnish aid mid
comfort to the enemy. Remittance of the
duties can be secured only by royal decree
or act of the Cones; but Spain is afraid to
resort to either oi these methods. To
bring up the iv the Cortes might
precipitate a fiery discussion oa the Cuban
question and the downfall o! the Canovas
Ministry. It is chimed by the Spanish
autnoruies that a royal decree would
surely result in an ii.terpellation of the
Government in the Cones and bring about
a similar state of affairs.
The new complicaaon may cause a fur
ther delay iv the re.ief measures. Com
missary-General Sullivan will purchase
supplies either in New Orleans or New
I'ork. Nothing will be bought in Cuba,
where prices of everything are very hieh.
BRUTAL BUTCHERIES.
Spaniards Raid a Cuban Hospita
and Put th-> Sick and De
fenseless to D ah.
HAVANA. CiÃA(via Key West, Fia.),
May L's. â Tn-e Spanish forces of San Qu*n
tin attacked a Cuhan hospital at Loma
Caideron, near Managua, province of
Havana. The sick and wounded Cubans
in the hospital w^re slain, also tw<i
women acting as nn-ses. One of the
nurses behaved very bravely and foueht
against the assailants to defend her life.
The other begged for nietcy, crying and
kneeling before the Â£t>i.niards. Both
were beheaded with machetes.
In the province of Havana the war is
assuming a more ferocious character.
Never before have the assaults by the
Spanish columns upon Cuban hospitals
aud defenseless pacilicos been so numer
ous.
The insurgent forces in the provinc?
number 5000 men, weii armed. Genen 1
Alejandro Rodriguez is c >mraan<t<>r-in
ehief, and under him are Generals Rafael
de Cardenas and Adolfo Castillo. Colonel
Nestor Aranpnerr- commands the cavalry
torces of Cardenas' bngaiie. Colonel Raoui
Araneo leads about 1000 infantry. AU
these forces are constantly harassing the
Spaniards, and 2000 regulars wt:o are
<>perating against them c.n't mt-.ke the
iriÃur?ents abandon trie sniail territory of
the Drovince. Tbe d ; sciplme and organi
zation of the Cubans is perfect. The
"pacification" of the province by Weyler
has bÂ«en made most ludicrous by recent
events.
A cable dispatch from Madrid cays that
Fenor Morel asked the Government for
proof of the reporied defeat of insurgents
in the Occident, and Canovas answered
that he could not produce any document
regarding the victory except official com
munications from W<*yl?r
"But Weyler's word," added Canovas
The San Francisco Call.
"is enough for me, and ought to be
enough lor all Spaniards." Ihe dispatch
adds that Morel also asked on what side
the sympathies of European nations were
enlisted in the Cuban war. Canovas re
plied that he positively knew Spain had
the sympathy of Europe, and for this rea
son the Government needed the advice of
foreign nations to establish reforms in
Cuba. The Prime Minister said also that
public opinion was in favor of reforms to
hysten the pacification of Cuba.
It is believed Morel's question is a mere
preliminary to a bitter campaign against
the Government in the Cortes if a minia
te rial crisis arises.
Famine is making ravages in the prov
ince of Maianzas. Both Spaniards and
Cubans are perishing. The city of Ma
tanzas itself is in dire distress. At Carde
nas, same province, the depreciation of
paper money has reached a ridiculous ex
treme. Ten dollars in paper is worth only
50 cents in silver.
The distribution of relief to American
citizens here will probably produce a con
flr-t with the Spanish Government if the
$60,000 voted by the American Congress is
really to be applied in lavor of the starv
ing Americans.
The Spanish army is hostile to the idea
of American Consuls distributing relief,
and this plan is locked upon by the Gov
ernment officials as involving interference
by the United States in Spain's affkirs.
They say ttiat the food and money should
be given to the Spanish authorities, who
would take care of the distribution.
Calhoun and Lee will probably return
Wednesday from Matanzas. It is gener
ally believed here that if Calhoun intends
to proceed farther east than Matanzas
Weyler will interpose objections.
LIBERALS REFUSE.
They Will Not Return to Parlia
ment Until Given Satisfaction
for the Insult.
MADRID, Spain, May 25.â 1n accord
ance wiih the request of the Government
supporters in the Cortez, the President of
the Chamber of Representatives to-day
visited Sagasta and asted him to influence
the return to Parliament of the Liberals,
wbo declined to attend sittings until they
receive satisfaction for the affront put
upon them by the Duke of Tetuan in box
ing the ears of Comas, the Liberal Sena
tor, after an altercation in the lobby of
the Corte*.
Sasasta thanked the President for bis
courtesy, but said he regretted that he
could not advise the Liberals to comply
wita his request. He added that the
differences of the Liberals were not with
the majority in the Cortes but with the
Government, which must first cive latis
faciion to the L'.beiais before they would
return to their legislative duties.
The Senate and house of Representa

The newspapers here consider the situa
tion very grave.

WASHINGTON*. D. C, May 25. â Briga
dier-General John R. Brooke was to-day
nominated by the President to be major
general. T c nomination was continued
immediately by the Senate.
It is many a long day since so many warships have been bunched in the bay at one time. Early yesterday morning there could be seen from Folsom-street wharf the old monitor Camanche, the gunboat
Bennington, the sloop-of-war Alert, the coast-defense steamers Monadnock and Monterey and the two new gunboats Wheeling and Marietta. .
The Alert was under way at the time, bound for Unalaska. On her arrival there she will take the Pinta in tow and bring her to San Francisco. The little warship has seen continuous service for
years, and on her arrival here will probably be placed in Rotten Row at Mare Island. On her return the Alert will be sent to Honolulu.
The Wheeling and Marietta were out for trial spins around the bay. Both vessels have so far exceeded the expectations of their builders, and the chances are that they will beat all vessels in their class
when it comes to an offkial trial.
The Monadnock and Monterey are just back from cruises up and down the coast, and will remain in port for some time to come, v/hile the Camanche will go to the Mare Island Navy-yard in a few
days for a thorough overhauling. She will be repainted and renovated throughout and on her return to her moorings Lieutenant-Commander Turner says she will look as spick and span as any warship in
the bay. B-fore going to the navy-yard the members of the battalion will go for a cruise around the bay on the old-timer.
The Bennington is awaiting orders. Jnst where she will be sent is not known, but the chances are that she will go to Honolulu. With all these warships in port, the Folsom-street landing has been
crowded daily. Launches and rowboats have been coming and going every hour, carrying visitors to the various vessels, and those, in conjunction with the men on shore leave, have made things very lively
around the south end of the water front.

CRISPI THREATENED
KING HUMBERT
Declared That Unless
the Scandal Ended Two
Would Be Exiled.
One Would Be His Majesty,
With Millions, and the
Other the E^-Premier.
Developments Connected With the
Scandal Crowing: Out of a Biff
Loan fur Election Expenses.
ROME, Italy, May 25. â Concerning the
connection of ex- Premier Crispi witn the
bank scandals, one of Crispi's intimate
friends gives the following account of bis
transactions:
"Shortly before the election of 1895
Crispi, with the assent of bis colleagues,
asked the jrfank of Naples for a loan of
400,000 lire for election expenses, the
money to be repaid from the secret service
funds. Shortly afterward came the
downfall of the Crispi Cabinet, at which
time only 220,000 lire of the loan bad been
repaid.
"Crispi at once informed the King of
his distressed condition. His Majesty
gave 120,000 lire toward paying the re
mainder of the indebtedness, and Baron
Blanc furnished the 60,000 necessary to
SAN FRANCISCO IS WELL PROTECTED.
make up the full amount. Thus Crispi
paid the bank completely.
"When the newspapers began the agita
tion he hurried to Rome and demanded an
audience with the King. He was received
by the Kins:, to whom he showed the re
ceipt of the bank for the money he had
repaid, and demanded that his Majesty
put an end to the campaign of injustice
against him. The ex- Premier decfared
that unless the campaign of prosecution
against him was ended he would defend
himself to the last, adding: 'In such a
case two persons go into exile â I as a
poor man, and you, sire, with your mil
linna ' "
The general impression is that the mat
ter wiil receive a speedy trial in the
courts, but it remains to be seen what
will be tne effects of the ex-Premier's in
terview with the K'ntr.
Crispi'a friend ni&imains that, in view
of tbe :nit:VitÂ«, a trial in the courts is
quite an impossibility.

WASHINGTON. D. C, May 25. â
Special TreaÂ»ury Agent Moore, stationed

against an increase in the duty on opium

was assessed at $12 the drug was smuggled

With a view to preventing brigandage

THREE DIED
DURING THE
TRIP NORTH
The Colon Is Placed in
Quarantine Pending
Investigation.
REPORT OF THE SHIP'S
SURGEON.
Says That in None of the Cases
Were There Symptoms of
Yellow Fever.
THE VESSEL AND PASSENGEES
FUMIGATED.
Some Cases of the Scourge In Cen
tral American Ports, but Not
Epidemic In Panama.
Another of the Pacific Mail Company's
steamers was sent into quarantine yester
day. There were three deaths during the
voyage, and owing to the yellow fever
scare the quarantine officers considered it
better to be sure than s.orry, so they de
cided to fumigate the ship, passengers and
everything connected with them before
allowing her to dock.
The Colon brought twenty-three cabin
and forty steerage passengers.
The United States Consul-General wrote
stating: "There are several ca^es of yel
low fever here (Panama) and a few deaths,
but the disease is not epidemic and tlie
scourge is no worse than it has ever
been." This communication, coupled
with the fact that Dr. Park had a slight
doubt as to the cause of death in one case,
decided Quarantine Officer Chalmcn to
act promptly.
The Colon sailed from Panama on May
1 and twenty-four hours later the passen
gers began to sicken and all three died
within ten days. Dr. Park of the steamer
makes a very fu'.l report of the cases, and
his statements as to the cause of death are
countersigned by Dr. C. Renz of the Mail
Company's steamer City of Para and Dr.
A. Marshall of Quezeltenaneo, in Guate
mala. In substance the report sets forth:
"Left Panama on the Ist inst., and next
day Gusiave Benderel, a native of Switz
erland, aged 75 years, was taken sick, and
on tbe 7th inst. he died. I diagnosed his
case as one of pernicious malarial fever,
complicated with Bright's disease. He
was conscious up to within a few hours of
his death. There was no vomit, no
diarrhea, and the body diJ not change
color. Dr. Renz of the City of Para and
Dr. Russell, a well-known physician of
Guatemala, were in consultation with me
and both came to the same conclusions at
myself.
"On the 3d inst. Fieder Peiger was
taken down, and I diagnosed his case as
one of pernicious malarial fever, compli
cated with pulmonary phthisis. His
svmptom3 were the sime as those of
Benderel, excepting that Peiger, who was
only 13 years old, suffered from severe
pains in the back of the nead. I was a
little doubtful as to the diagnosis, but
am positive it was not a case of yellow
fever. Peiger died seven days after he
was taken sick."
"J. T. Bennett, aged 35 years, also died
on the 10th inst. He had been working
in the mines in Central America and
wanted to reach San Francisco. I ex
amined him in Panama and found him
to be suftering from entero-coletis. Oa
my advice the company's agent refused
to sell him a ticket, as I considered him
dangerously ill. He slowed himself away,
however, and the second day ont was dis
covered and brought before thÂ» captain.
There was nothing for it but to bring him
along. I did everything possible for him
and when the consultation was held we
found he was also suffering from inter
mittent fever. He died on May 10. The
remains of all three were buried at sea.
In no instance were there any of the
symptoms of yellow fever, and we had no
yellow fever on board."
The cabin passengers by the Colon were :
Fred J. Elliot, Walter B. Scott, W. J.
Rogers. C. F. del Rio, L. Matthius, Fred
Wade, J. R. Wood. Miss Daisy Allen, '
Kose Linaros, Max Rtvlish. William Mar
tin and wife, Jose La Paros, Mrs. T.
Shiner, William Corwell, Will im W.
Pu!d, Leociarar Priciar, Ratal Volaica,
Richard Efran, Ernest White and three
Chinese for Honekoug.
After their baggage had been* fumigated
they were allowed to land. The tvÂ« Mil
len Griffiths brougnt tnem to the Mail
dock and will brine over the steeraee pas
sengers to-ciay. Then when the steamer
has been fumigated she will dock, and
then the Milien Griffiths wiil be fumi
gated.
In talking about the matter yesterday
Dr. Chalmers said :
"There is no yellow fever on Doard the
Colon, and the only reason for sending
her into quarantine was the prevalence of
the disease in the ports whence she came.
Besides this the ship's physician was

somewhat doubtful as to the ex.ict cause
of the death of the boy Peiger. In view
of these facts it was thought best to be on
the safe side. As to the boy, his case was
diagnosed as a consumptive affection and
pernicious fever, and his case presented
the gravest aspect. It was clearly no case
of yellow fever. Bennett was a sufferer
from the miasmic conditions of the Cen
tral American climate and was in no con
dition to travel. In conclusion let me
state that there is no need for the public
to fear that yellow fever can gain an ac
cess to this City Irom the steamship
Colon. In the first place we are satisfied
that there was no fever of that character
on board, and in the second place all pro
cautions have been taken that could possi
bly be required."
The United States quarantine officers
were so satisfied that there was no con
tagion aboard that they passed the vessel.
Dr. Chalmers was determined to be on the
safe side, however, and took the above
action.
A WRONGED WIFL'S VENGEANCE.
Fatally Shoots Her Husband and Wounds
the Woman Hs Was Imploring to
Elope With Hm.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 25.â Mrs. May
CampbeiJ, a jealous wife, concealed her
self in a closet iv the room of Maud De
vere, IS' Center street, this morning and
eagerly listened to her husband's profes
sions of love, the object of his affections
ceing the courtesan named. Wildly ex
cited by her spouse's protestations that
he was not married and his pleading with
the Devere woman to elope with him,
Mrs. Campbell sprang out of the closet
and emptied a 38-caliber revolver at the
guilty pair. Four of the shots were fired
at the husband and two at the courtesan.
One ball entered at tho point of Camp
bell's left jawbone ana plowed out at the
chin. Another entered his left breast,
right above the heart, passed through his
lung and came out of his back. He will
die. The Devere woman was shot in the
left knee. Mrs. Campbell surrendered to
the police.
Sitting in the prison van on her way to
the hospital to be identified a* tbe would
be murderess by her husband, Mrs. Camp
bell put the cause of the tragedy in this
way: "He tried to play a double game,
and I tripped him. He won't waste much
more love on other women."

weeks ago from Cincinnati and opened a
store at 1928 Market street.

clined the offer made by President Crespo
of Venezuela to act as the representative
of that country in the arbitration pro

President Cleveland said that although
he was greatly interested in the arbitra

proper for him to appear as counsel for
Venezuela in a case in which lie had fig

his formal declination to-day shows that
he has not changed his mind in this re

Had he accepted the position he would
have been counsel for Venezuela, and his

bitration treaty does not provide tor any
representative of Venezuela on the board
ot arbitration, which, it was provided, was
to consist of two members nominated by
the Judges of the Supreme j Court of the

Senate to-day the debate on the Dinpley
tariff bill commenced. While the gallery
was crowded with spectators interested in
protection, the attendance of Senators was
larger tnan at any time since the extra
session of Congress was called. No posi
tive agreement as to the time for taking
up the tariff bill bad been made, but it
was the general understanding that
Aldrich of Rhode Island would malte the
opening statement for the Repnblicans,
after the morning business had been dis
posed of. Such proved to be the order of
proceeding-.
The morning routine was opened by
Pasco of Florida, who presented the cre
dentials of the new Senator from Florida,
Steven K. Mallory, who wa^ sworn in.
Further conference on the Indian bill
was ordered. A resolution was agreed to
requesting of the President all corre
spondence relating tq the fur seals in Be
rin? Sea.
Perkins of California presented a resolu
tion reciting the refusal of the Russian
Charge d'Affaires at Washington to vise
i he passport of Adolph Kutner, an in
fluential Jewish banker of Fresno, Cal.,
who was about to visit Poland. The reso
lution refers to the "invidious distinctions
against certain American citizens" an i
the official action of Prince Lobanoff, the
Russian Premier, relative to the exclusion
of Jews from RuÂ»sia. It provides also
that this Government request Russia to
declare whether American cit zens are ex
cluded from Russia on account of their
religious faith, and if so that said imperial
Government of Russia be requested to re
move sucn prohibition and permit Ameri
cans of whatever religious faith to visit
Russia. Perkins spoke in favor of the
resolution, sayinjr the United States
should extend its protecting arm to every
citizen. Jew or Gentlie, wherever he might
co. The resolution was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
A resolution by Pettigrew was agreed to
a>king the President lor information rela
tive to the Union Pacific and Central Pa
cific railroads, the amount of dividends,
the execution of the Thurman act, etc.
Tiie resolution authorizing the Secre
tary of the Navy to employ any suitable
si'ip in the transportation of relief sup
plies to India was considered. Chandler
explained that this wn essential, as no
American ships were available.
' Morgan remarked that the Senate had
r-ached an era when it was necessary to
consult somebody at the other end of the
Capitol "as to whether a measure could go
through."
"Has ihe Senator," queried Morgan,
addressing Clinndler, "inquired whether
this benevolent resolution will be allowed
to receive consideration in thÂ« flonsef"
Chandler responded by asking if Morgan
bad any arrangements for passiug his
Cuban resolution in the House.
"The people are arranging that," re
sponded Morgan, "and either t!*e Senator
from New Hampshire who supported that
resolution and myself and thÂ« American
people and Almighty God will give way
on that, or else the Speaker of the House
of Representatives will give way."
Morgan spoke on the calamity and hu
miliation to which the United States was
subjected in having no American ships to
carry American benefaction. This dis
patch of grain to British India would con*
vince the British people that notwith
standing the defeat uf the arbitration
treaty, we intend to live with them on
terms of peace and amity. Morgan of
fered an amendment providing for nat
uralizing two Briiish-built ships to ca-rv
this grain. He declared the shipping
laws preventing the naturalizing of for
eign-built ships were responsible for the
humiliating condition of having no Amer
ican ships.
At 2 o'clock the tariff bill was taken up.
Vest gave notice that when the para
graphs were read be would move to strike
out the provisions relating to beer, manu
factured tobacco, snuff and cigarettes.
Aidnch opened the debate for the Re
publicans, beginning as follows:
The business of the entire country is in a
state of suspension awaiting the action of the
Senate upon the bill under consideration. I
be.ieve this anxiety to secure action upon
this important measure at tbe earliest possi
ble day is shared by every member of the Sen
ate. It is my purpose to keep the bill con
tinuously beiore the Senate, to the exclusion
of all other legislative business, until it is
finally disposed of, and in this I shall expect
the hearty co-opÂ«Tation of Senators on both
sides of the charnbjr. In the discussion mem
bers of the majority committee will content
themselves wiia such brief explanations as
may be found necessary to the various para
graphs as the; axe reached.
Aidrich proceeded to present in detail
tbe estimates ot the effect the bill would
have upon the revenue and to explain in a
general way the character of the amend
ments suggested. In explanation of the
sugar schedule Senator Aidrich spoke at
great length, in effect as follows:
In the sucÂ«r schedule E we have suggested a
change In rates and in the manner of assessing
the duties. .As the schedule is a very impor
tant one, it seem* proper that I should ex
plain definitely the effect of the provisions we
recommend. .; V;.", â ;-'â 
The â  annual consumption of sugar in the
United States is about 2,000,000 gross tons of
2240 pounds each, with a value baaed on for
eign prices approximating $90,000,000. If the
high duties proposed in cither the House or
Senate bill should be adopted, the annuat cost
"f sugar to consumers would be more than
$160 000,000. Of the consumption : of 1896,
40.000 tons, or 2 p*r cent, were beet sugar*.
produced In the United States, and 240,000
toas, or 12, per rent, were domettic cane
sugars, and- 157,000, or 8 per cent, were
sugars admitted irom the Hawaiian Islands
free of duty under our treaty with' the
Hawaiian Government. The 2,000,000 tons of
sugar consumed in the United State* consti
tuie nearly 30 per cent of the total consump
tion of the world, the total sugar crop of 1896
b' ing approximately 7,000,001) tons, of which
4,300,000, or Â«boutt>l^ per cent- of tho whole,
were beet sugars. ,
The pressing necessity for securing greatly
increased revenues seems to render a return to
a Republican policy ot free sugar adopted in
1390 an impossibility. The demand for reve
nue purposes and the belief that every reason
able effort should be made to encourage the
protection of beet sugar in the United States
jed a majority of the Finance Committee to
recommend toe high rates upon sugar which
are contained in ti.e bill now before the Sen
ate. â  â â -.â -â â â â¢.â¢â  : â .--,â â¢â â â¢â¢ ,/.-:. "â â¢;
It is believed by the friend* of the beet
sugar industry that we can successfully imi
tate the example of Germany in the rapid de
velopment of beet-sugar production.
: The bill, as it came to us from' the House of
Representatives, contains provisions which
levy a specific duty based upon poiariscopic
test upon imported sugar varying irom 1 cent
per pound at 75 degrees to 1% cent* per pound
on all sugars above No. 16 Dutch standard in
color and refined sugar. The effect of these
rates, as applied to the total | importations â¢at
the port of New York for the month of Janu
ary, 1897, is shown by a table which I submit
to the Senate, which has been prepared by the
customs officers in New York. Tne rates sug
gested show a range of ad valorem equivalent
from 78.2 to 144.3 per cent. A care ml ex
amination of the taoles will show that the

scale of rates adopted bears very un
equaly oH all low grade sugars. The
character and extent of tais discrimination
lea your committee to believe that the sched
ule should be modified. The committee de
termined, afier a careful examination ot the
whole subject, to recommend rates which
would be Iv their effect as high at least as the
House bill, but which would ba levied in a
manner that would make the ad valorem
equivalents more uniform. We believe that
the imposition of the hich specific rates upon
low-grade sugar testing 87 deg. or below
would have the effect of excluding them from
the markets of the United States. The total
amount ol these low grades produced is, as I
have ulready stated, unimportant a* com
pared with the total sugar crop, but their con
tinued importation inio the United States is
very important, when viewed from the stand
point of our trade and commerce with other
countries.
To exclude from the American market all
the low-grade cane sugars from the near-by
countries and sugars of a'l grades from dis
tant countries would confine American pur
chasers to beet sugar and to centrifusais irom
points nearest the United States, and send all
other sugars to free markets like Canada and
England. This policy would undoubtedly in
crease the print of the sugars from near-by
countries and necessarily add to the cost oi
sugar to consumers in the United States.
These are the reasons wtrch led your commit
tee to suggest an ad valorem rate of 75 per cent
on all sugars testing not above 87 degrees.
But this rate can only apply to a very small
portion of the sugars of the world, as from ob
vious causes ihe proportionate amountof such
sugars is constantly decreasing.
On the same sufjar? testing 87 degrees, very
much ihe larger portions, as 1 have already
staled, being ci'iitrifuguls testing about 96
degrees, we were confronted witli tne fact that
these rates would discriminate in favor of ihe
sugars of certain localities and values, against
tnose of others. The committee, after lull
consideration, reached the conclusion that
the essential elements of a certainty ol reve
nue and an adjustment of rates that would
lessen discriminations could beet be secured
by the adoption ot compound rates. The
committee, therefore, adopted the suggestion
which is contained iv the biil wo have report
ed to the Senate of imposing a soecinc duty,
which is equivalent to about 40 per cent ad
valorem, with an additional duty of 35 per
cent ad valorem on all sugar?. Irom 87 to 100
degrees, wltn 13-100 of a cent per pound addi
tional on all sugarg above No. 1(3 Dutch stand
ard iv color #nd in refined sugars.
More than 90 per eei.t oi the sugar which is
imported into the United States lias neretofore
been imported in a raw condition and has
been refined here and it is, therefore, of im
portance that we should consider carefully
the effect which the schedule proposed by the
Senate Committee wouid have upon ihe refin
ing industry. I assume that it Drill be ad
mitted i:i all quarters that this industry is en
titled to fair treatment. The fact that the
busities-s as conducted to-day is in compara
tively few hands aud thnt a large portion of
it is carried on by one company, while it fur- I
pishes a reason sor unusual care in the ad
justment of the rates in order that no u.dueJ
or unfair advantage shall be given to sugar ,
refiners, should not be allowed to furuisn a
pretext on the. preparation of a tariff bill con
structed upon protective lines for the destruc
tion of a great industry, la other words it is
important from every economic stand
point that we make it possible that the
refining of sugar can be successfully carried
on here nnd that the business shouid no: be
turned over by legislative discriminations to
German refiners.
It is therefore incumbent upon us to show
that no protection is given the refinlm- inter
ests by the proposed schedule beyond that
which is adequate for the continued existence
of the business in the United Suites. b"or tuts
purpose I have prepared a series of statements
which I submit for y >ur consideration, show
ing the actual difference between the rates
imposed by the schedule upon raw sagarsof
different grades and retiued.
The first of these tables to which I wi'lcall
your attention shows the rates imposed upon
each grade of sugar testing above 87 degrees
by the House bill snd Senate bill; it shows
further the actual differential on each grade
in both the House and Senate bills. This
table shows that the differential between
raw ana refined sugars by the Senate pro
position varies from 9.77 to 15.40 cents per
100 pounds, while the differential in the
liouse bill Â»aries from 1- -O to 17.35 cents
per 100 pounds. It wLI be seen tr >m an
examination of this table tii.it the differential
between granulated migar and 'JO degree cen
trifugalsâthis b.-ing by ;ar the mosi impor
tant class of raw sugars and in amount two
tnirds of the total imports of raw sugarâ is
9.87 tents per hundred pound : ; on 94 degree
Cftrlfugals ih" differential is 10.8 cents; on
89 degree MuscavaUoes lhedifferentiÂ«l is 14.6.
In order to show tliat the commit tee's propo
sition does not give undue advantage to
beet sugars as compared with cane sugars, the
following statement has been prepared t>y me
to show the differential between raw and re
fined beet sugar in comparison with the differ
ential of the .-ame sugars based on the r tttes
imposed by existing laws.

Senate bill 186.50 1b1.7J 14 797
A <lricn then submitted statements
showing the differentials under varying
values of sugar, and resumed:
Under the existing law German refined re
ceives .38 of a cent per pound export bounty.
The countervailing duty here is bu: 1-10 ol a
cent per pound. The Germau refiner, tnere
fore, receives a net boun ty of .28 of a cant per
pound. This enables h:m to sei his product
at a less price than the American refiner has
to pay for 1)0 degree centrifugals. It is this
kind of competition which is driving :he cane
sugir to the wall.
He then replied at length to a statement
by Hon. Whilliam L Wilson, in wcich
the latter estimated the rates imposed by
the Senate committee's report. Continu
ing, Aidrich said:
In the tables I have submitted no allusion
is made to the bounty provisions contained in
both ihe Senate and House proposals. The
adoption of tnesÃ or similar provisions for
countervailing duties s>-ems to be a necessity
if we are to develop the beet-suga* industry
In the United Btates. Otherwise it wih be
possible for any fore gn country, by extension
of its bounties, to neutralize entirely u.e effect
ot our protective duties.
In considering the important question
whether trie differential proposed by either
the House or the Senate biu is greater than it
should be, we are bound in fairness to take
into consideration existing conditions and the
changes which have biken place since ttie
enactment of the act of 1894. When tliat act
was under discussion in tne Senate the differ
ence ot German granulated and raw b.-ets, 83
per cent analysis, was .57 of a cent per pounu.
In March the difference was .33 oi a cent
per pound. The importations of refined sugars
into the United States amounted in 1891 to
4 000,000 pounds, and in 1892 to 14,000,000
pounds. The importations in 1890 amounted
to 187,000,000 pounds, while the importa
tions in the single month of April, 1897,
amounted to near y 32.000,000 pounds. Ger
man refiners have driven the sugar-refining
industry of Great Britain almost entirely out
of existence. They are, as I have already
stated, invading every sugar market ol the
world with their product. Most of the Gorman
granulated imported is the result of a con
tinuous process of refining. For months raw
beet sugar and German granulated ha>e sold
on absolute parity of value, taking into ac
count only the percentages of pure sugar con
tained in it. li we assume tne <ft>st of re
fining sugar in the United States to bo
approximately ) 2 cent per pound, and if Ger
man refined can be sold without loss on the
same basis with German raws, it must be evi
dent that the differential* suggested in the
Senate proposition are not only not excessive
but they aro quite likely In the near future to
prove inadequate to secure the continuance of
the business of s-ugar refining in the United
States. If the importations of German granu
lated should increase at tbe same ratio that
they have sinco the act of 1894 was adopted,
the Germans will certainly secure at nn early
day a large part of the American market. Tne
protection afforded by the differentials pro
posed by the Senate committee 18, f believe,
not only less by percentage but less with
reference to the aciual requirements of the
industry than that aflorded by rates imposed
upon any other important product by the
terms of tbe bill.
Pettigrrw gave notice of an amendment
to tbe tariff bill providing for the abroga
tion ol the Hawaiian reciprocity treaiy, as
follows:
"That the treaty concluded on Jnnuarv
13, 1575. and proclaimed on June 3, 1875,
and the convention extending the uuia
tion of said treaty, concluded December
6 1884, between the United States and the
King of the Hawaiian Islands, is hereby
abrogated, repealed and annulled."
Vest made a lengthy speech, in which
he said there was no disposition on his
part or on the part of his Democratic col
leagues to make factious opposition to the
passage of the pending measure. They
were fully apprised of the desperate condi
tion of the country. They knew how
many ruined homes, how many blasted
hopes now surround Congress. If pros
perity could come from any source, even
from political opponents, the Democrats
would welcome :t, and not only welcome
it but wou.il bless the moment in which
it came. He did not believe, however,
that the imposition of large taxes, either
by way of customs or internal revenue,
would lift the cloud which now resterJ on
the people. The curse of the country to
day was consolidation and boarding of
money in great financial centers. Every
dollar unnecessarily hoarded was a crime
against the ptople in their present ter
rible condition. He thought it unfortu
nate that tbe friends of tne measure bad
not seen proper to furnish an estimate of
tbe revenue which it would produce.
In a colloquy with Gallinger, Vest said:
"I will teU you what the matter is with
the farmers and producers. They are con
fronted with tbe agricultural products of
other countries, paid for in silver and
with labor paid for in silver, but paid for
at gold prices. We being on a goid stand
ard are competing with countries tnat are
on a silver standard."
Gallinger, interrupting, said: "Japan
has recently gone over to tbe goid stand
ard."
Stewart broke in: "Japan has been
bought up." [Laughter. J
Resuming, Vest admitted that nobody
could understand the various proposi
tions on tbe sugar schedule, and that on
the wool section his ReDublican friends
were hopelessly divided. In conclusion
he repeated that no factional opposition
would be offered to the measure; that the
Democratic Senators intended to discuss
it fainy, earnestly and j.istly. They did
not expect to pat unnecessary obstacles in
the way of its being enacted.
Cannon gave notice of his amendment
to pay an export bounty on wheat, flour,
rye, cotton, hops and tobacco and made a
short speech in explanation and advocacy.
At the close of Cannon's remarks the bill
went over until to-morrow, and after a
short executive session the Senate ad
journed.
DESERTED, HOB BED, MURDERED.
Shocking Fate of an Italian Resident ol
New Orleans Who Trusted a false
Friend.
NEW ORLEANS. La., May 25.âYester
day the body or C.arenio Delielio, a well- j
to-do Italian citizen of New Orleans, and a f
manufacturer of baskets, was found bob
bing up ana down in the river eiehteen
miles below New Orleans. Attached to
the neck was a rope, at the end of which
was a grindstone.
Tbe man had been struck on tbe head
with a clnb and then thrown into the
water with a grindstone to carry him
down. The rope was long enough, how
ever, to allow the body to float to the sur
face. Delielio was h&ppiiy married, hud ',
three daughters ana was an American
citizen. A few weeks ago he brought over
to America an old schoolmate ami com- |
panion named Francesco Cavcatero. He
gave Francesco quarters in bis house and I
lent him money. Ten days ago Delielio
awoke to find tbe following note on bis
table :
Your old fool: I have eloped with your
wife, your children and your money. You
need not follow, for you will never see them
again, She thinks me a better man than you.
Fkaxcesco.
The letter was true. The wife had taken
$300 and her girls and gone with the false
frend. Clarenzo sought a lawyer to insti- :
stute divorce proceedings and set the po- '
lice on the trail of the fugitives.
Sunday morning be received informa
tion from an I aiian that his family was
secreted in an Italian settlement above
New Orleans. Sunday was the last seen
ot him alive. Sunday night an Italian
lucger put off from the Willows and next
day the corpse of the murdered man, with
the grindstone tied to his neck, was found
where the lugger had passed. The mur
dered man, the police declare, was enticed
upon the lugger on the pretense that he
would be taken where his children were
and murdered ?orne time in the night by
h:red men. There is a suspicion that
Daliel^b's own money bought the services
of the men who killed him.
PRESBYTERIANS APPLAUD. ,
Pleased With a Ruling of Attorney- General \
McKsnnc â Interesting Report on
Fore gn Missions.
EAGLE LAKE, Ixd., May 26 âIn the
Presbyterian. General Assembly to-day <,
applause greeted the announcement that
t he grant for a Roman Catholic chapel at
West Point has been declared illegal by.
tbe Attorney-General, himself a member
of the Roman Catholic church.
The complaint of members of the Pres
bv.ery of New York against the Synod of
New York with regard to the licensure of i
students was withdrawn upon tbe answer
of the judicial committee that the action;
of previous assemblies applied to all Pres
byteries, who are thus "enjoined and in-'
structed" not to take under their care any :
students who are pursuing or purpose to
parMM their studies in seminaries not
approved by the general assembly. This
report of the judicial committee was
adopted without debate.
The regular order of the morning was
the reports on foreign missions, as follows:
The report showed that efforts bad been
made to curtail expenses as far as possi
ble, in view of the reduced receipts, but m
spite of such efforts an increased deficit
was reported. A large part of it was due
to the falling off in the item of legacies.
It was suggested that the extra effort to
extinguish the debt of the board had an
effect upon contributions to the cause of
foreign msnions. Special praise was
given to the work of the women's boards i
and to the young people's societies*. Men
tion was made of necessary retrenchment, i
but the basis of it was unspecified.
Six foreign missionaries died and eighty- )
three were sÂ«Â»nt out during the year, a large
proportion of whom, however, returned to j
former fields of labor.
Tne receinis were as follow?: From ;
churches, $270,479; women's boards, $299,- ;
115; Sabbath-schools and youn<? people's i
societies, $54,049; legacies, |89,549; mis- j
cellaueous sources. $95,549. Unused ap- j
propriation and the sale of properties on
the field increased the assets by $60,129.
The total expenditures were $936,061, or
which $57,621 was for administration and
printing.
The total debt amounted to $113,239.
which was reduced by receipts from the
anniversary fund to a net debt of $97,454.
The largest appropriations were made
for work as follows: China, $174,697: India,
$167 373; Japan, $78,145; South America, i
$Â«0.080; Syria, $59,065; Siam nnd Laos,
$71,114; Persia. $73,193; Africa, $41,385.
The board ha% securities to the amount
of $257,588, the interest of which is avail- ;
able .or current work. It also owns ss- :
curities of $38,102, upon which it has not;
yet reaiizÂ»d, and special funds aggregat- '
Ing $366,860, of which $135,455 belongs to !
the permanent fund.
The Presbyterian bnilding in New York
-tood the board in $929,885. of which $54,
--740 belongs to the interest account and
$14,203 represented taxes. Loans on i lie.
building aggregated $610,000, and $17,054
had been received irom rentals. The ,
gilts made toward the building amounted ;
to $270,893.
Th 9 selection of Charles W. Hand of
Brooklyn as treasurer of the board was i
announced.
The report of the standing committee
on foreiirn missions, reviewing the report
ot the board, was presented by John D.

Havemeyer in Court to
Answer Charges of
Contempt.
Senators as Witnesses Tell
What They Know About
the Case.
Broker Chapman Gets a Temporary
Outingâ Methods Adopted
by the Defense.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.-Tbe
trial of Henry 0. Havemeyer for declin
ing to answer certain questions propound
ed by tbe Senate investigating committee
began before Justice Bradley to-day. A
large number of Senators were summoned
to tell what they knew about the matter.
Among those who appeared were Senators
Davis, Murphy, Lodge, Gray nnd Lind
say. Natnaniel Wilson, John G. Johnson
of Philadelphia and John E. Parsons of
New York represented Havemeyer, who
wa-j seated back of his counsel. District
Attorney Davis was assisted by Lasker.
The jury was soon secured and Davis
opened the case by stating the well
known iacts of Havemeyer's refusal to
testify before the Senate committee.
R. L. Miller, stenographer before tbe
Senate committee, was examined by
Davis and read his notes of June 13 giv
ing the refusal of Havemeyer to answer
questions propounded by Senator Allen.
The reply was:
"While I am perfectly willing to answer
any material matters under the advice of
counsel I decline to answer about outside
matters. I also decline to answer about
!ocal contributions. I know of nothing
to tbe National campaign. There
exists no bargain of any nature and we
never claimed that the company wan en
titled to anything except what its merits
required."
Senator Gray of Delaware was on the
stand some time. Th^ Senator remem
bered that in substance the question dealt
with contributions of the trust to cam
paign funds. In reply to a question re
garding the reports of the committee to
the Senate, one of wnich was considered
in "executive" session, Gray said he could
not remember "anything that occurred
in executive session."
Counsel then became involved in an
argument over the questioning of Senator
Gray regarding the action of the Senate
on tbe matter. The desire of the defense,
apparently, was to show that the Senate
was made aware of the fact that Have
meyer had declined to answer questions
and that the Senate did not take any ac
tion on his refusal.
Judge Johnson made a little speech on
the subject, in the course of which he said
that they would show that tho report of
tiie committee had never been received
and that the committee was itUl in exist
ence. Mr. Johnson attempted to show by
witnesses that the question by Senator
Allen, which Havtjuieyer refused to
answer, was a question oropounued by
Allen himself against tbe objection of sev
eral members of tbe committee, and that
it was not a question of the general com
mittee, but of an individual member of
tbe committee.
Witnes* said he could not tell whether
any one had said in the committee-room
that Havemeyer might answer the ques
tion or not, as he saw fit.
Davis asked the Senator if he remem
bered the putting of the question to Have
meyer.
Gray said he could not remember just
what action the committee had taken, but,
although he personally was opposed to
tbe question, as chairman of the com
mittee he put the question to the witness
and must have done so at the action of
the committee.
During the hearing a little stir was
caused by the entrance of Broker Chap
man, who had been brought from the Dis
trict Jail to testify in the case. He walked
to the side of Mr. Havemeyer, snook
hands with him cordially, and then took
a seat near tbe D 3 rict Attorney. Chap
man is looking well, and his confinement
in jail has apparently had little effect on
nim.
Senator* Lindsay. Lodge and Davis
testified respecting the putting of the
question to) Havemever. Davis seemed to
remember more than some of the other
Senators. He told ttie story of the ap
pearance of Havemeyer before the com
mittee and his testimony. He said that
Havemeyer's examination was suspended
in order that he might look up data to
reply to Alien's questions and take the
advice of counsel.
When the committee reconvened Have
meyer decline l to answer the questions.
The Senator remembered the lact that
there bad been a discussion in committee
regarding the question and that the ma
jority indorsed it. The Senator thought
i tie record of the proceedings of ttie com

Captain and Cook on the

Long in Vain.
If the Man Did Not Reach a

PROVIDENCETOWN*. Mass.. May 25.â
The 100-ton schooner Josepn P. Johnson,
Captain Brien, lies at anchor in mid
stream with the ensign union down, for
the possble death of sixteen Portuguese
fishermen, who lelt her side on Friday
morning to make v set of trawla on the
western fishing banks.
The Portuguese population, numbering
2000 souls, is intensely excited over the
sad news. The streets and telegraph of
rice are besieged by throngs of weeping
islanders begging for information aud
praying for the safety of the missing men.
The Johnson's sixteen men made a set ot
trawls at 7 o'clock last Friday morning.
The weather was fine. Hardly had they
made the set when a dense fog ciosed
about them and hid them from the cap
tain's sight. He was on board, having
only the Â«k kto manaee the craft, which
was under saii, cruising in the neighbor
hood of the outspread dory fleet, and after
a short cruise on the port and starboard
tacks in quest of the boats he decided to
drop the anchor, so he might not acci
dentally get too far from his men. He
believed they would remain at the an
chored trawls until the fog should lift and
felt no uneasiness.
The crank foghorn was set in motion.

and the captain and cook hung over the
rail, pÂ«erine into the fog for the welcome
sight of the returning boats. After an
hour hal passed away and no sight of any
dory was obtained, anxiety replaced the
ca:m bemofore maintained. \
Darkness fell, and the schooner, with a J^
long string of cable ahead and with lights >*
at the masthead and stern in addition to
the usual rding lights, lay all night
wrapped in a dense fog blanket. With
daylight can,e the lifting of the fop;, and
the captain ran aloft with a glass, hoping
to gain a plimpse of the men. The ocean
lay outspread for miie-j within his vision,
but was baro of all craft. The men and
boats had disappeared somewhere in the
waste of waters. Down came the fog
again, and the two men once more turned
to their duty, heartsick with waiting.
The fog continued all of Friday and
Saturday, and a heavy squall of six hours'
duration came Saturday afternoon.
Sunday morning dawned bright and
clear, and again the glasses were directed
from aloft on the sea, but in vain. To
wait longer was useless. The two men
with the thought of their starving com
rades in mind commenced the task of get
ting tbe bis cratt under way. They had
great difficulty, but finally got the sails
up. The craft boomed into port at Ip. m.
to-day. For forty-eight hours not a mor
sel of food passed the lips of the worried
men, nor did they sleep fro^i the time tbe
dories left the vessel until anchor was
dropped in this harbor. The dories were
supplied with water, sails, compasses, but
no food.
II tbe flotilla made at once for Nova
Scotia, eighty railea away, the men are
probably safe. If they hung to the anchor
line or became scattered, much suffering
has succeeded. Fresh fish mast have been
taken from the gear, but being raw, would
prove loathsome. Captain Brien's grief
is pitiful.
'â¢God only knows the torture and anx
iety we have undergone," said Captain
Brier to a reporter to-night. The western
bank is out of the course of all lines of
steamers and there is no coast within -50
miles, so there is little hope of the recov
ery of the men.
The names of the missing are: Joseph

AND HIMSELF
Double Crime of Charles
Kemble Hillyard at
Brooklyn.
Leaves Communications to
Show the Father Was Dis
appointed in Life.
Was the Grand-Nephew of Charles
Kemble and a Second Cousin
of Algernon Sartorls.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 25.â Charles
Kemble Halyard, a grandnephew of
Charles Kemble, the great actor, and sec
ond cousin of Fannie Kembie and Al
gernon sartoris, who married Grant's
daughter Nellie, was found dead to-day,
lying by the side of his 13-year-old son,
"\\ ilham Kemble Hillyanl, at their home,
212 Greene avenue, Brooklyn. Both died
by tbe father's hand. No person knows
exacrly when :he act was committed, for
although theâ¢ were two pistol shots â one
of which probably followed the other with
only a few seconds between â no person in
the house among the neighbors heard
them.
The boy was a student at the Adelphi
Academy. The father was ostensibly a
lawyer. Last evening the father went to
his room and called to his son to Lurry up
to hirr.. They slept in the same room in
different beds. The servant at 8 o'clock
brought some apples to the room. The
boy was then in bed, but not asleep, and
the elder Hillyard was apparently all
right. They failed to appear at breakfast,
but the servant did not go to aroUÃe them
till the nfternoon, as they sometimes pre
ferred to lie in bed late.
Tue ooy wa? dead with a pmile on his
face and a bullet-hole through his head.
He was evidently shot while asleep. The
father's body, clad in a dressing-gown
over a nightshirt, lay across the toot
board, with a revolver near by.
Oq the center-table were a large num
ber of papers. The top paper told tbe
tale of a dioappointed man whose ambi
tions in life were all dead. It evidently
had been the work of many nights, for it
was not all written at one time. Some
parts were in ink and others in pencil.
Following are extracts:
"Suppose I should kill my boy and my
self, would it miikeany great difference to
anybody? His mother is dead, and Uncle
J .hn will be relieved cf the necessity of
taking care of him in case of my death.
A.* to the odium of this killing and sui
c de, what does it amount to? There
would be no flowers or friends or rever
ence. Willie would be at peace forever;
no future, no tears, no agonies, no tempta
tions, no Bins. He would be in Para
dise, and that would be all I ask.
For myself, what matter ceremony
or resret? 1 couldn't be in greater hell
than lam now in. I have no occupation ;
I am simply a shamming, wretcned idler.
lam tired of shamming. I want to go
somewhere; lam useless here. I cannot
earn a living. My iife is a dreadful fail
ure. 1 have studied for many years, bui
can make nothing out of it. Scientists do
not know the reason why Ido this. They
know nothing of my life. Farewell, world;
we part forever. This horrible idleness is
the cause â this hopeless longing, this
shamming employment, this unholy
wa~te of time."
Another letter referred to his property
interests. He left considerable property.
Hillvard belonged to the stock company
<f \Ya. lack's Theater a quarter of a cen
tury ago, and played eccentric parts.
Afterward he left the stage for the law.
About this time he met Anna Maria
Mem, whom he married. They were a
lodine couple, and Hillyard has been a
changed mau since her death some years
ago.
Hillyard was a Christian scientist. Be
side his table stood a large Bible on a
stand, he.d open at the fifth chapter of
St. Mathew â Christ's sermon on the
mount. Near the Bible, on the table, was
a scrap of paper, on wnicii was written in
pencil: ''What does he know of trouble â
an idle little child?" Then in ink: "I
bometimes doubt whether I am quite sane,
for I fell astray, and, like one in a dream,
came to no good."
rZUMOiSI* IV Ji/4 DEATH.
Vro'pereu* Chir.agoan Ui.it ractrd by Hit
fl'ifr'm hx'rarnaance.
CHICAGO, 111., May 2sâ William Mitt
man, a well-to-do citizen of this city,
threw himself Jrom the top of a very high
building this morning and was dashed to
death. There are a number of stories
afloat as to why Mittman committed sui
cide. At the present time it is hard to
verify any one in particular. His friends
refuse to say anything about it and his
relatives arÂ« equally non-committa!. His
wife has taken hit death very much to
heart and refuses to be comforted. One
of Mittman's talkative neighbors has
given the nearest solution to the suicide.
She says that it was the extravagance of
Mrs. Mittman which drove the husband to
hi! 1 death.
Mittman frequently remonstrated with
his wife, and toid her thai tne great ex
penditure in dress would ruin his business
unless the ouuay was stopped or modified
a little. Mrs. Mittman lauched at the
idea. She said to her husband that he
was wealthy and couid well afford the ex
pense of a new dre-ss occasionally.
"Oh, that's all right," Mittman was
heard to exclaim once. 'No matter how
wealthy I am, if you keep this tning up
I'll bÂ« a candidate for thÂ« poorhouse."
This phase of Mittman's character is
borne out by several other people, who
say that he was a crank on economy, and
at times would walk a mile to save car
fare or go days without having his shoes
shined.
"JAiLORS COSXIIiEST OF VICTORI,
Manufacturer* Submitting to Starving
Workmen *'Ut on Strike. ;
NAW YORK, N. V.. May 25.â The
striking tailors are sure of victory. ' Two
manufacturers this afternoon signed the
agreement sent them by the men and it is
said that others will follow suit. The men
say that the other manufacturers cannot
po9sib!y"nold.out much longer, as this is
the ; busy season and the demand for
clothes is ereat enough to make the man
ufacturers yield.
These tailors have constantly demanded
relief from the long, oppressive hours.
Once they won a victory and were prom
ised the relief, but no sooner was the vic
tory won than contractors put back the
hours to the old schedule. ..They de
manded a raise in wages and were refused
all along the line. They were pinched
down from month to month, and week to
wees.
Reductions of a few cents at a time were
code, and these workers, in the iron grasp
of their taskmasters, were forced to sub
mit. They had families â these men â and
thÂ°re were mouths to feed and wives and
children to clothe.
A year a.o a contractor paid 80 cents for
a coat; now he pays -10 cents. They have
worked on haif time, because so many of
them would otherwise be unemployed.
PILGRIMS TO AMERICA'S LOURDES.
The Halt, the Lme and the Bind Are
F.ocking in Vast Numbers to Hoy
Hill, Wisconsin.
HARTFORD, Wis , May 25.â The first
of tne pilgrimages to Holy Hill took place
to-day. It is already evident that the
number of visitors to the sacred spot will
be greater this year than ever bsfore. The
locality is one of great natural beauty,
and was entered from the Government in
the year 1855 by Father Huber, an Aus
trian priest, who prophesied that the
place would become one ot the most cele
brated in the landâ a place of worship
ami pilgnm.-ige where thousands would
come yearly to do homage to the Virgin
and her Son.
His prophecy has in a measure come
true, and many are the miraculous cures
lh:it are recorded in refutation of the
skeptical views of unbelievers. Ex-State
Senator Kroeper, a prominent dry-goods
merchant of Milwankee, states that his
niece, Mi.-s Clara Kroeger, was cured of
a dm-ase of the Â«yesknown as ophtnalraia
by a visit to Holy Hil!, the efforts of the
most iamous specialists having proved
unavailing.
This cure was effected several years ago,
and since that time there nas been no le
curre-ica of the disease. Another re
markable cure spokn of Dy Mr. Kroner
and which has been verified to the sat s
faciion of hundrÂ«di of people, was that of
a dauehter of Herman Verhalen, a resi
dent of the township of FranHlin, Mil
waukee County.
The young woman had become insane
and was pronounced incurable. A visit
to Holy Hill, however, effected a com
plete and permanent restoration of the
young woman's faculties. Hundreds of
similar occurrances are related, being snp
port d by apparently good evidence, and
tne effect of these cures has been to spread
the fame of Holy Hill throughout the
country.
The immense number of pilgrims who
visited the shrine to-day would seem to
indicate that the spot is destined to be
come a* famous a center of pilgrimage as
is Lourdes, the old world Mecca for devout
Catholics.
ALIGELIt'S TKVUBI.ES MUL.TZPLX.
Sold (second-Hand. furniture to Bin State
nt Fancy Price*. '
SPRINGFIELD, Mass., May 25.â The
investigation by the legislative commit
tee to learn the cause of the treasury de
ficit has resulted in the discovery, of
vouchers showing that ex-Governor Alt
geld and wife disposed of second-hand
goods to the State at prices which would
be regarded stiff for new furniture.
Anioncr the items â amounting altogether
10 $1458 â are a wliite mahogany table,
$125; mahogany tabes. $75; rug, $125;
fifteen pairs of lace curtains, $200: b-as-i
bedstead, $100, etc.
Chairman Anderson said that, contrary
to the rules of the Auditor's office, no re
ceipt was riled for a single one of the items
contained in the vouchers. The commit
tee has the very best evidence that most
of this furniture was second-hand.
Altgeld denies the charges and says:
"The attempt to drag Mrs. Aitgeld before
the public simply shows the contemptible
and pusillanimous character of some of
the rotten, whisky-drinking loafers who
are now in authority at Springfield." The
ex-Governor is evidently nervous and pi
cited. His hands trembled as he p:iced
up a. id down his parlors. Aitgeld de
clared his wife bought things from time
to time as the mansion needed them, both
in Springfield and In Chicago, and paid
for them wlih her own money. It was
for these that she asked remuneration.
While Governor be spent $5000 a year to
maintain the mansion and grounds, and
while he did not mind losing money him
Â«e fhe did not think she should lo;e. He
concluded by asseriinjr that practically he
made the State a present of the furniture.

ALCHEMIST VBtti VK> Â» DISCOVERY.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.-E. C.
Brice of Chicago, whose process of creat
ing gold and silver out of base metals was
declared ineffective by a commission of
Government assaje rs, is going to take his
formula to England for trial there. The
report of the commission was sent to the
Secretary of the Interior by Secretary
Gage to-day for guidance of the Patent
Office in acting on Brice's application for
a patent on his secret. The publication of
the story about Brice and his formula
brought forth this statement from i.iin
to-day in a local paper:
"The Commissioners insisted upon
using tartar emetic (salt of antimony),
which they were positiv-ly told not to use
and which they were told was inimical to
tbe process. They were a-ked to use a
special apparatus which would yield best
results, but refused for fear of an explo
sion, though they were assured that such
had been in successful use for some time.
Tbe Commissioners did not at any time
either complete the process or proceed
under it according to my instructions.
When they persisted in using* tartar
emetic and I protested against its use they
refused to proceed further."

Labourli'ra Slake* a Qualified Apology
to Dr. JH .rrit.
LONDON, Kara., May 25.â When the
Parliament committee on the Transvaal
matter resumed business to-day the chair
man read a letter from Henry Labouchere
withdrawing his aliega ions against and
apologizing to Dr. Rutherford Harris.
Laboucbere says the information came
from a eeuileman of high position, who
now refuses to testify.
Labouchere's charges were as follows:
"The main object of the raid was to an
nex the rich mining districts of the Trans
vaal to Rhodonia. It is obvious that the
first news of the raid would cause a fall
in shares. I am prepared to prove that a
syndicate was formed just prior to the
raid, including a leading director (Mr.
Harris was a director of the company as
well as its secretary at Cape Town) in and
one of the chief < fticials of the British
Chartered South Africa Company, for the
purpose of making large bear sales. The
seed thus having been sown for securing
a profit by the immediate fail and ulti
mate profit by buying when the raid was
successful, and a rich slice of the Trans
vaal had been added to the charter lai.ds,
steps were taken to carry out the con
spiracy."

Triumphs.
Annual Promenade Concert Ends a
Day of Pleasure at the
University.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
25. â An elaborate programme was carried
out to-day at the senior theatricals. The
entertainment opened with "A Proposal
Under Difficulties," a comedy written by
J. K. Bangs. The cast was as follows:
Yardsley F. B. Rlley
B*rlow George W. Bush
Miss Dorothy Andrews Miss G. Streeter
Jennie (a maid) Miss Hyde
Tbe parts were taken exceptionally well.
The rough work that usually mars ama
teur theatricals was missing, and the par
ticipants merited the applause they re
ceived.
J. J. Raffael, the Tivoli barytone, sang
a solo. Both Raffael and Charles I. Dil
lon "J9, who rendered a couple of coster
monger songs in his inimitable style, were
loudly applauded.
After a short intermission "The Silent
System," by Nat Goodwin and Maxine
Elliott, was presented. The students
were especially enthusiastic over the man
ner in which this clever marital sketch
was portrayed. Although the proper stage
equipments were lacking, the treat was
greatly enjoyed, and at its close the gym
nasium rang with applause.
Ferris llartni a delighted the student*
with his interpretation of "Lucky Jim"
and the "Circus Baby." Of course Hart
man knows how to get into touch with his
audience, and it was with difficulty that
he finally succeeded in withdrawing after
having responded 'o repeated encores.
The programme was concluded with an
interesting bit of play, "A Pair of Luna
tics." Miss Florence Jones '98 and George
Robinson '99 participated. Although a
mistake wa* made in allowing an amateur
sketch to follow the finished work of pro
fessionals the audience appreciated their
efforts and voted the senior theatrical a
decided success. H. Connick '97 managed
the affair.
Aluniai exercises consumed most of the
afternoon. Tne chapel was comfortably
filled at "2 o'clock with those who wished
to dear the literary exercises of the day.
C, B. Whittier '93 depicted in a carefully
prepared address a modern Utopia. Miss
Cora M. Palmer '95, who represented
Stanford in an intercollegiate debate,
spoKo of the influence of a university edu
cation on the religious sentiment" of stu
dents. Correspondence wiih over 100 stu-
dents who have attended Stanford at lf-a-tt
three years disclosed the fact that 83 per
cent had not had their religious views al
tered by a university education.
In the business meating which followed
the plan lor a brancn alumni association
was adopted. The object of this associa
tion is to feeep the Stanford Alumni asso
ciations wnerever they are forniod in
touch wiih Stanford University. Afler
the transation ci general business an elec
tion was held in which the following
officers wsre chosen: C. K. Field '95, presi
dent; L. J. Hinsdill '95, vice- president;
Miss Stoitenbera, '96. secretary; Professor
C. E. Cox '0.3, treasurer; executive com
mitteeâJ. F. Sheehan '95, C. B. Muttaer
'93 and Miss Siatmuller '95.
Having finished the work of the day the
alumni repaired to Encina dining-room,
where an elaborate repast was served.
TbÂ«Â» toast list was as follows: "To '97,"
C. K. Field, toastmaster; "Response," C.
S. Pope, president '97 clo**; "A suggrs
tion for the future," H. D. Sheldon '96;
"Change follows change," L. J. Hinsdnt
'95; "For sweet friendship's sake," Miss
H. St-idtmuUer '95; "The alumnus and
the university," President Jordan.
â¦â¢One of the most enjoyable events of
commencement week was the promenade
concert this evening. Tne young ladies
received their friend* at handsomely dec
orated booths in the quadrangle. Music
was rendered by a band and a delightful
evening spent Misses E. Jordan, Ray

SELLWOODS YOU/VG HERO.
Brave Attempt of a Twelve-Year-Old Boy
to Rescue a Companion From
Drowning.
PORTLAND, Or., May 25.â A true hero
is little Roy Hamilton of Sellwood. Al
though but 12 years of age he on Sunday
plunged into the waters of the river in
an endeavor to rescue a drowning com
panion, Charley Bays. That young Ham
ilton did not succeed in his effort was due
only to his strength failing him.
Standing on .the bank of a slough were a
half dozen boys watching Bays' move
ments, and envious of his possession of a
catamaranlike raft. Among them was
little Hamilton. Bays fell from the raft
and sank and Hamilton, throwing off his
jacket only, plunged into the water and
swam to the rescue. The little fellow is
an adept swimmer, and despite the dis
tance by the time he reached the raft
Bays was just going down ior the second
time.
Climbing aboard the flimsy structure
Hamilton besan tearing up the boards
iorming the deck and throwing the pieces
to Bays, The iatier was too far gone from
fright and the water lie had laken to pay
any attention to the life-saving supports
thrown witlnn hia graap.
Seeintr the drowning boy sinking for the
third time Hamlton dived overboard ior
him, managing to clutch his arm, but
Bays had become unconscious, ana the
heavy weight oi his body was more than
the young hero could sustain. He was
obliged to release his bold on the body
and come to the surface for breath.
PORTLAND GHOUL'S SANITY.
Theory That Magone's Mind Was Affected
Is Dismissed by the
Authorities.
PORTLAND, Ob.. May 25.â The theory
of insanity has vani hed in the case of
Dan D. Magone, the promoter of the Ladd
grave- robbery scheme, and the authori
ties have come to the conclusion that he
is a desperate, soured man, who will re
sort to anythiug to obtain money. Late
yesterday afternoon, when informed that
his three confederates had had an exami
nation before the Grand Jury, be said,
with much irritability:
"Well, 1 might just as well make a clean
breast of the affair and tell my story."
About four years ago, when Magone
was in better circumstances, be had a
tutor for his little daughter. One after
noon the two went out lor a walk, and the
young girl, attempting to cross a plank
over a creek flowing into the Tualatin
Biter, fell into the deep water. Tne tutor
went to hT rescn â¢ and both were
drowned. The child's body was soon re
covered ana iaia upon the bank, pending
tne arrival of her father. When he drove
up he leaped out of his carriage, and.
speechlessly pressing the inanimate foim
to his heart, re-entered the carriage with
the corpse and drove home. One of his
confederates, speakiuc of this sad episode,
MM:
"That, perhaps is the reason why Ma
gone objeeied to Lidd's body beitijr placed
in tne river, for he exclaimed, '.My God, I
wouldn't do that for my life." 1
AD VENTURES IN ALASKAN WILDS.
Two Thousand Mile Trip Made by a Swsd-
isfi Missionary in ihe Far
North.
SEATTLE, Wash, May 25. -David
Johnson, a Swedisn missionary, who has
been isolated for six years tn Western
Alaska, arrived at Juneau recently from a
trip of -000 miles of mountain riding be
hind a pair of reindeer. He brought the
mails from Point Hope on the Arctic
Ocean and the Port Clarence reindeer sta
tions, as well as the news from the mis
sion of the Far North. In narrating his
advpntures Johnson said:
"On New Year's day I left with the first
reindeer mail for Unalaklik and Bethel, a
Moravian mission station on the Kusko
wim. We bad two team? of reindeers
each. One of these teams was owned by
the native boy accompanying me. Most
of the time we drove the reindeer double
aud they did good work. We reached
Uualaklik on January 8. Then we pushed
on toward the Kuskowim and joined Mr.
Kjellmau, superintendent of me Teller
reindeer station, who with two Laplanders
and a small herd of reindeer was on a re
connoitering trip, looking for good feed
in;; grounds for the deer. We made St.
Michaels in one day. There we were snow
bound for eight days. Having no guide
we took our course by ihe compass with
the aid of such mapÃ as we hud, and oglit
riiiys later reached the Russian mission at
Beikosky. Our route lay over mountains
and across several rivers, but everywhere
there was an abundance of the boat kind
of moss for feeding the reindeer.
"After leaving Belkofsky we went to
Bethel, which Inission is in charge of J.
H. Kilbuctc. Two of the Betliel mission
offered to po with me to Fu>hamak. On
reaching Carmei, a Moravian mission
station, we found Mr. Schoechert all ready
to set out for Katmai, so, sending the boys
back the next morning, I set out with
him. We called at all the canneries, gath
ering up the mail.
''Our experience in crossing the moun
tains was a bitter one. When on top a
storm came shrieking down upon us from
the northeast. To retreat was as impossi
ble as to go forward. The only thing we
could do was to dig a bole in the snow and
put up our tent as best we could and
crouch down in it, waiting for the storm
to pass. Neglecting to take the dogs in,
they were found next morning very stiff,
while one was frozen to death. We then
took the do^s inside the t^nt ana on
them to thaw them out. The sixty-sven
hours that seven men of us and ten dogs
were huddle*! in there, shivering and
hungry, was an experience not soon to be
forgouen,
"W T hen the weather cleared we hurried
dowu tn Kaimai, where we arrived on
March 30. Thi3 finished my overland
journey. During the winter I had trav
eled about 2000 miles, half with deers and
half with divs. On April 19 the steamer
St. Paul crossed Sneiikoff Straits, from
Katmai to Ktdiak, where I took the
steamer Dora for Sitka.'

PHCBNIX, Ariz. May 25.â Attorney-
General Wilson left lor the north last
evening on a mission of belligerency to
ward Apache, Mojave and Navajo coun
ties. The Attorney-General considers
these counties in the light of insurgents
and rebels, because they have refused to
pay their pro raia of the tHx levied by the
last Legislature for the maintenance of
the Territorial University and Normal
School. Trie population of these counties
is largely Mormon.
The District Attorney of Apache County

the legislative enactment and declares
that his county will not pay any further
tribute to the Territorial Normal bchool.
It was in respanse to this letter that Wil

Wilson will at once institute proceed

WORDEN ATTEMPTS
TO END HIS LIFE
Tragedy in the Train-:
Wrecker's Cell at
Folsom.
The Condemned Man Slashes
His Arm With a Piece
of Glass.
Despairing of Executive Clemency,
Ha Had Resolved to Cheat
the Callows.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 25 â Salter
D. Worden. who is sentenced to lie hanged
on June 4 for the murder of Engineer
Clark and four United States soldiers,
killed through the wrecking of a railroad
train on ihe long trestle in Yolo County
during the strike of 1894. attempted to
cheat the gallows last night by commit
ting suicide in ids call at Folsom prison.
The attempt was made with a piece of
glass obtained by breaking a lamp chim
ney. In endeavoring to sever an artery in
his arm he made an ugly wound, cutting
several small veins, and he lost so much
blood that when found this morning be
was extremely weak. Tha thin glass had
broken Kgainst the muscles instead of
penetrating to the artery, and this saved
his life.
Evidently by means of the mysterious
system of telegraphy used by criminals in
penal institutions, Worden must have re
ceived notice that there was but little hope
of Governor Budd interfering in his case.
This morning he talked freely about his
attempted suicide, and expressed supreme
sorrow that he had not been aole to kill
himself. He had made all preparations
for his death, and had written and ad
dressed several letters.
To Warden Aull Worden said he had no
longer any hope of a reprieve. Governor
Budd had evidently made up his mind
not to interfere and he thought that the
"jig waÃ up." He did not want to be sub
jected to the disgrace of dying on the gal
iow> and thought he could save the State
some trouble and go hence in a way that
would be Iss3 ignominious than the hang
man's route.
In speaking of the affair Warden Aull
said it was the usual custom to put the
death watch on condemned men about
one week prior to the date of the execu
tion. They had been expecting that Gov
ernor Budd would, long before this, say
yes or no to Worden'a appiicati >n for a
commutation and the prison officials had
been uncertain what to do.
At last it appeared as though there was
to be no intenerence and when Worden
saw that preparations were shaping for
his execution he became exceedingly
nervous.
The death watch was put on this morn
ing and will remain with Worden to the
date of his execution or until such time
as the Governor may interfere.
BOARD THE GENERAL SIGUN.
Crew of the Cutter Parry Vainly Search
the Ureck for Bodies of the
Dead.
TORT TOWNSEND, Wash., May 25.â
The hope that some of the wrecked Gen
eral Siglin's seamen or passengers might
iiave escaped and found a refuge among
Indians on the far northern coast has
given way to the belief that none of those
aboard will eyer bÂ« heard from again. I
Many weeks have elapsed since the wreck
occurred, but no news of survivors has
been received at northern seaports.
Thfl revenue cutter Commodore Perry's
crew boarded the Siglin ten miles to the
westward of Queen Charlotte Island, and
the condition of the craft gave testimony
to the terrible experience the small vessel
had undergone in the unequal battle with
the elements. The masts had gone by the
board, while everything in sight showed
the effects of the gale*.
At the time the derelict was sighted by
the Perry the sea was smooth and calm
in the vicinity, and thus permittin? a
thorough examination. A boat from the
cutter was sent to the wreck and a thor
ough inspection of the hull made. Noth
ing remained aboard but some provisions
put up in packages too bulky to be washed
from the cabin.
Although the greater part of the craft
was submerged, a portion of lhe cabin was
out of water, and in the bright sunlight
it was possible to mate a tnorough and
careful inspection of the interior. There
were no bodies in the cabin. The force
of tbe waves nad carried away the doors
and skylights, through which it is more
than probable the unfortunes were washed
after being drowned like rat 3 with no pos
sibility of escape.
It is* probable that in this cabin tbe wife
and child of Agent Greenfield of the
American Commercial Company met
their death while the gallant ajrent was
on deck adding his efforts to the weak
attempt of the crew to keep the frail ship
before the wind.
The Perry reports the wreck drifting
rapidly in shore, and it will undoubtedly
bring up on the rrnrged beach of Queen
Charlotte Island. Whoever comes first
upon the wreck in that deserted section
will be richly rewarded, for within the
strong box of the cabin there is $2000 in
currency.
Knowledge of this fact leaked out re
cently, when there was talk of organizing
a company here to recover the wreck.
The undorwriters immediately wired that
in the event of the vessel being found
they would hold the finder responsible for
the amount aboard. This bad the effect
of putting a peremptory stop to all ar
rangements.
Xapa, Van Accused, of Murder.
WOODLAND, Cal., May 25.â John
Litz of Napa was arrested in this city to
day by Sheriff Griffin on suspicion of be
ing one of the murderers of L. Colburn, a
commercial man who was found dying in
ft box car on May 12 and who afterward
died in tlio county hospital. Persons in
Valiejo had seen Colburn ana a man
named Jnmes McPhee together. McPhee
was traced to Marysville and arrested.
He told the officers that Luz.was the man
they wanted, and Liiz was consequently
arrested and taken to Napa this evening.

EUREKA, Cal., May 25.â The second

Pomona's officers concede defeat by 7
minutes. The Humboldt passed Meiggs

PrKENIX, Ariz.. May 25.â Martin Gar

daughter to town this morning, paralyzed
by a spider bite. The poisonous insect
was a black spider. The child was asleep
in the early morning, when she was sud

ing pain over the right eye. In less than
ten minutes paralysis Jiad set :n, and in
ten minutes more had proceeded to al
most every limb and muscle in the body.
The only motion of her limbs was an in
voluntary twitching. She was unable
to speak or even to swallow.
Dr. Swetnam of Phoenix treated her,
and before she left town ;he paralysis had
gone completely, ana the only tracs of
the venomous insect's attack was aa ugly
puncture above the eye.

BISHOP NICHOLS
TO THE STUDENTS
Conference at Pacific
Grove Addressed by
the Divine.
"New Manhood in Christ
Jesus," the Subject of
His Discourse.
Earnest Advice for the Guidance
of Young: Men In Their Walks
of Life.
FACIFIC GROVE, Cat,., May 25.â This
has been a red-letter day in the annals of
the students' conference. Tne platform
speakers were both men of note and abil
ity, and the morning-session classes
seeiueJ unusually successful. Besides
this, the afternoon's baseball game
brought prominently to the fore the real
athletes who are here, some of whom are
Pacific Coast champions in their particu
lar line.
The morning's session was called to or
der by the chairman, and the first class,
the missionary institute, convened under
the leadership of Robert E. Lewis. The
general topic which he discussed was
"The Financial Problem of Missionary
Work." The stringency in funds, he said,
was a great obstacle in me way of sending
properly qualified men into missionary
work. The student volunteers gave a
large amount of the money which went in
this direction, havin? donated in the past
year $60,000. Mr. Lewis suggested the
further possibilities of subcription from
students by estimating the amount of
money expended by them in their college
atbleucs at about $15,000 for the institu
tions of the Pacific Coast. He also sug
gested means for increasing the amount
now beine given.
The first conierencs of presidents of col
lege associations of the convention was
held in ttie Epworth League reception
room. The important duties and respon
sibilities of men in the position of presi
dent of Â«n association were discussed at
some length by C. C. Michener. The
qualifications for this place he gave as
executive ability, good record as a student,
appreciation of the power of an associa
tion in a college, good business traits and
popularity.
F. L. Willis spoue at the same hour to
the assembled presidents or general sec
retaries of city association? upon social
qualifications necessary to success in their
special work.
The 10 o'clock platform meeting was
the event of the morning if not of the day
because of the fact that William Ford
Nichols, D.D., Bishop of the Episcopal
diocese of California, addressed the dele
gates and a large crowd of outsiders as
well. After a short song service and
opening prayer by Noel H. Jacks of Oak
laud Bishop Nichols was introduced.
The purpose of deepening the spiritual life
of college men, he began, involved the
treading upon holy ground. The main
riead under which he talked wa? 'New
Manhood in Christ Jesus." Aristotle, he
said, analyzed humanity as composed of
body and soul technically, but the New
Testament analysis being more profound
added another attribute as deeper â the
spirit.
Bishop Nichol3 went to the root of the
matter by translating the word from the
original Greek. Mima, the word meaning
spirit, is used oftener in the New Testa
ment scriptures 'ban psyche (soul), and
the two words differentiate the dominant
parts of the human being in the now and
the hereafter. The technical New Testa
ment soul (.psyche) is not presented as
the highest part of man's nature, but this
highest part is the spiritual life as dis
tinct from body and soul. A great quali
fication for this higher attribute is clean
liness â physically, intellectually and
spirituallyâ in study, in athletics, in man
ner of life.
There was an attribute of our spiritual
(rational) part, said tne .Bishop, which
corresponded to physical muscle, and it
needed exercise just as an athlete needed
training. Alone this line he told the
students to be careful ana resolute
in choosing their reading, to read biog
raphies of pood men, and so gradually
allow t c spiritual nature to work itself
toward the mystic model â "the measure
of the stature of the fullness ot Christ."
Most of the afternoon was taken np with
athletic exercises. Tne ball game be
tween two nines chosen from the dele
pates supplied plenty of sport, and the
preliminary games of the tennis tourna
ment were begun.
The life-work class conference this even
ing was condncted informally by Mr.
Willis. C. O. Michener delivered a short

Dr. E. R. Dille of San Francisco ad

which tlie public was invited in the main
auditorium of the church at 8 o'clock.
His ieciuro began with the qustion. "Who
and what was Jesus of Nazareth?" He
said :
In the New Testament we find four little
biographies about ;i person called Jesus, who

hn divine power, but who proved the miraoles
divine. This man was younger when he died
than Wiliiam J. Bryan is now. yet the worlU
has rung with bis fame for 1900 years. Great
epochs produce groat men. Out of the darkest

.Socially he was poor and unlearned. Buddha,
Confucius, ail great religmus teachers were

took all that was gool out of ail these sys

ALVISO CHANNEL IMPROVEMENTS.
Governor Budd Censured at a Sen Jose
Mass-M'etmg for Vaioing the
Appropriation.
SAN JOSE, Cal , May 25.â At a mass
meeting heid in Hales Hall to-night, called
in the interest of the improvement
of Alviso Channel, resolution-* were
adopted in which Governor Budd was
condemned for refusing to sign
the bill appropriating $25,000 for the
work, commending Congressman Load
for his efforts on behalf of the channel
and requesting the Board of Trade to con
tinue its efforts toward the improvement
of the channel.
The meetinc was called to order by
Robert Summers. Colonel X. R. Weaver,
president of the Board of Trade, presided
and J. P. Fay was elected secretary.
Speeches were made by Colonel Weaver,
Robert Summers, Major Coulter, James
A. Chase, A. T. Herrmann and Nicholas
Bowden. Ail spoke of the advantages to
be derived from the straightening and
dredging of the slough and urged unity
of action.
Bowden urged that nothing be said in
criticism of Governor Bndd for bis refusal
to sign the bill passed by the last Legisla
ture, claiming that be could not legally
hare done so, as it was a National high
way and money for its improvement
could be appropriated only by the United
States Congress.
"How came it then," asked A. X. Her-
Mann, "that he signed the bill appro
priating $300,000 fot the improvement of
the Sacramento and San Josquin rivers?
Is it not the State, and not the United
States, which declares the rivers to be
naviaabie?'
'â¢Yos," said Bowrlen. "but San Fran
cisco Bay is not a river."
"Nor "is Alviso Slough the San Fran
cisco Bay," retorted Hermann.
"It is an arm of the bay," said Bowden,
who proceeded to 9:\> r he'had no desire to
quarrel over the question and went on to
urge harmony and no criticism of Budd.
When the report of the committee on
resolutions was presented Major Coulter
attempted to have all reference to Budd
and Loud eliminated and was seconded
by Bowden, but the resolutions were
adopted as presented by the committee.
They are as foiiows:
Whereas, Tiie Board of Trade of San Jof>e,
Santa Clara County, has during the past eight
years persistently advocated the improvement
of Alviso Slough; and whereas, said Board of
Trade and kindred organizations of
surrounding counties have presented to
Congress carefully compiled statistics
showing the constantly increasing shipments
to and irom the port of Alviso. a;m also the
large yearly saving in freight charges to
shippers by way ol Alviso Chanuel;
ana whereas, the last Congress di
rected the resident engineer to make
a survey and estimate cost of said improve
ment; and whereas, said engineer with his
said report expressed his opinion adverse to
ttiig improvement, contrary to the statistics
filed by the commercial bodies of this county ;
therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the citizens of Santa Clara
County, in mass-meeting assembled, hereby
determine to continue our efforts toward se
curing an appropriation from the State or Na
tional Government lor needed Improvements
in Alviso Slough. ;
â  Resolved. That we recognize the excellent
service rendered at tho last State legislative
session by Assemblyman Arnerfch in securing
the passagejof a bill appropriating $25,000 for
this important improvement.
Resolved, That we deplore the action of Gov
ernor James H. Budd in vetoing said bill, par
ticularly as at the same legislative session the
Governor approved a bill appropriating
$300,000 for similar purposes on the San
Joaquln and Sacramento rivers.
Resolved, That we recognize the services of
Congressman Eugene F. Loud in securing
beacon-posts for the bay approach to Alviso
channel and his efforts in behalf of securing
an appropriation for its improvement.
Resolved, That thanks are due to the press
of San Jose and San Francisco, and also to the
Board of Trade of San Jose, for their persis
tent efforts in endeavoring to obtain appro
priations to make Alviso channel navigable.
Resolved, That we request the Board of
Trade of San Jose to continue its noble strug
gle for a suitable appropriation for these im
provements and to uree upon our Representa
tives in Washington the need of making the
port of Alviso easy of approach by vesselsXof
deep draught at all tides.
I Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
sent to Senators George C. Perkins and
.Stephen M. White and Congressman Eugene

Dr. Manly is of the opinion that Cavill

and that heart disease was the cause of
his demise.
At the Chutes in San Francisco Cavili
gave out in his race with Dana Thomp
son, and had t â¢ be pulled outof the water,
and the physicians believe that it was
his heart that failed him then.
His repeated feats of difficult swiminine.
requiring great expansion of the lungs,
were too great a strain on the heart and it
finally yielded.
It will be remembered that Cavili
gave exhibitions of cuest expansion, and
these in themselves had the effect of
weakening his heart.

one of the big canala of Miller & Lux's ir

side domain broke last night near Fire
baugli and the water bas flooded 2000

dollars. The grain belongel to J. J.
Lowery, who had rented the land from
Miller & Lux, and tue destruction of tbe
crop will fall seriously upon him.
It seems that tup bursting of the canal
bank was due to a su tden rise in the

NO COLOR LINE,
SAYS THE PASTOR
The Los Angeles Church
War Is Becoming
Bitter.
More Withdrawals From the
Central Baptist Congrega
tion Expected.
Prominent Members Fall In Their
Attempt to Bar Colored
Children.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., May 25â The
difference of opinion as to the propriety
of permitting colored children to mingle
with whites in th 3 Central Baptist Bun
day-school is of each a serious nature as
to preclude the possibility of the two fac
tions ever reuniting.
Rev. E. A. Copass, the pastor of the
church, adheres to his original position
that, as the gospel is or should be free,
there is no reason wby two well-dressed
and well-behaved colored children should
not have tbe privilege of the teachings
in his church. He says he knows it
woul I have been more politic to have
yielded to the demand of his parishoners
and turned the little biacks out, but as a
matter of principle he concluded to itand
by the freedom of the gospel and let the
dissatisfied members of his flock go their
ways.
The two Scarborough families which de
manded and received their letters are fail-
ing to have the objectionable children
turned out are natives of Mississippi and
retain the prejudices of the whites of that
section. They say they will not attend a
church or Sunday-school to which colored
people are given entry.
Byron Scarborough was assistant super
intendent of the Central Baptist Sunday
school, and his wife was a teacher, J. W.
Scarborough was a pillar in the church.
All have gone because the pickaninnies
stayed, and the defection was a serious
one to the congregation, especially as
quite a number of other members were in
sympathy with them, but have not yet
had the temerity to demand their letters
and sever their relations.
Pastor Copas is also a Southerner â a
native of Tennessee â but he intends to
make room in his Sunday-school for the
despised blacks.
Feeling runs high in the church, and
efforts are being made to calm the storm
before any more prominent members draw
out. In the meantime tne bones of con
tention â the little black children â will go
regularly to the Sunday-school of Rev. Mr.
Copas.

jiwhoritin fail to Intercept Adulterated
Liquor*.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. May 25.â The at
tempt of local authorities to intercept a
shipment of adulterated brandy from San
Francisco, bound east ward, failed to-day,
to their great discomfiture.
Health Officer Powers received a tele
gram from San Francisco warning him to
be on the lookout lor three carloads of
adulterated brandy and liquors from San
Francisco. This was all the informa
tion he got, but he soon informed himself
by investigation that the liquor was
lately condemned by the San Francisco
Board of Health and was under surveil
lance there. A few days ago it thsan
peared irom that City and the officials be
lieved that it was started for Los Angeles
and notified the office here.
There seems to have been some ques
tion as to the authority of the Health
Officer to seize the stuff while in transit
unless it was consigned to this point, but
it w: s determined to hold the brandy at
all odds, if it could be found. The heads
of the health and legal departments hur
ried to the depot, but they found turn tbe
troublesome brandy passed through tbe
city yesterday over the Southern Pacific.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 25.- If he
had not prevaiicated about his previous
sojourn in the Nevada penitentiary for
forging a railroad pass Captain M. M.

was exposed in court by Warden Sell ol
the Nevada prison to-ctav. He was sen
tenced to ray a fine of $500 and be com
mitted until he pays. As he has no prop

uncertain time unless the court orders his
release.

Every man has some nrr.Mtlon, some desire
to make a mark or be known as a success in a
given field. No one wants to be called a lias
been, "failure" or weak-kneed. Now, to make
a success in life, to be at the top, you must be
mentally and physically strong. If you have
a known weakness, if you lack nerve force, if
you are suffering from nervous debility, you
cannot bo a grand success. Your Hie will end
in failure.

A Well-Dressed Man
With Well-Dressed Children
' Is a pleasant
sight. The man who dresses well, regard-
less of any obstacle, has learned one se-
cret of success. He has learned that
money invested in clothing is money well
invested. He has learned that it pays.
Men who buy here have also learned
one secret of successâ they have learned
that they will get more for their money.
You want style, fit end wear in a spring
overcoatâ why pay more than $10.00 for it
when you can get it for that? .

Bortet That Wintered in California
Winning JPuraem Right Along.
California climate seems to have wonted
wonders both with the horse* that raced and
the jockeys who rode over the local tracks the
past winter, for they are cutting up big capers
on the tracks on the other side of the moun
tains. Slaughter, the right-hand bower of
Barney Schreiber, accused of being sleepy and
a moke the: better part of the season here, is
riding in race form at St. Louis, dividing the
jockey honors with Garner. The horses, too,
are in hot pursuit of the ; coin, being promi
nent at the end in nearly every race In which
they start. No doubt this fact will bring many
new stables ibis way next winter.
Garner piloted two winners at St. Louis yes
terdÂ«y and Saughter a lite number. Tommy
Murphy, riding at the same track, possesses a
happy faculty of landing short-priced ones in
.the place or on third- base. Murphy was out
this way last winter, but was the . recipient of
no flora*! offerings when he Jeit. .

ST. LOUIS, Mo.. May 25.â There is a big
baseball sensation in the germ. It is
stated on very good authority that a
proposition has been made to give up the
Cleveland franchise and transfer the
players to this city. .It is reported that the
public of Oieveland take very little in
terest in baseball and the maintenance of
a team there is a very expensive luxury.
Of course there are many cranks who fight
the plan of giving up the nine, and they
make all kinds of rash promises to keep
up the interest if the baseball. managers
will only retain the franchise. The base
ball cranks are eager over the prospect of
getting the Cleveland players, and they
are holding out all kinds of inducements
: tor them to come. â¢ . : "'â¢,; /â

DOG POISONER
ABROAD AGAIN
Several Canines Killed
in the Business
District.
Columbus J. Mogan Loses His
Valuable Chesapeake Bay
Dog "Hip."
A Reward Offered for the Arrest and
Conviction of the Man Who
Did the Deed.
The dog-poisoner is abroad again, deal
ing out death to canine pets, and tbis time
he has chosen the business portion of me
City as his stamping ground. A great
many merchants and their employes take
their hauling does to tneir stores, and
within the last week three of these have
been killed by poison on Battery and ban
some streets.
The latest victim of the rascal was
Coiumbus J. Mohan's handsome Chesa
peake Bay dog, "Hip," who, from his
affectionate disposition and fond ness of
playing with all who made overtures of
friendship to him, was well known in the
business quarter.
Mr. Mogan is employed by Rinaldo
Bros. & Co. at 300 Batiery street And Hip
was a familiar sight about the neighbor
hood of Sacramento and Battery streets
carrying an advertisement of the firm that
had been constructed particularly for his
use, in his mouth.
The dog followed his master to work for
the last time on Saturday. He was ob
served playing wiih a man a short dis
tance from the store and a Jittle later
came back apparently in good spirits.
In about an hour Hip began to show
signs of distress, and suspectintr, from the
experience of other owners, that 'he dog
had swallowed poison, Mr. Mcgm pro
cured remedies at once and tried ,o save
nig lavorite's lile.
The fatal drug bad obtained too strong
a bold on the dog's vitals, however, ami
late in the afternoon he went to the happy
hunting grounds.
Mr. Mogan was divided between sorrow
and anger, but the latter prevailed and he
has begun a systematic search for the man
wbodid thedasiardly work. O.her owners
who are mourning the loss of their dogs
have been consulted and a- a result of the
conference $5") reward will be paid eny
one who brings evidence enough to pro
cure the arrest and conviction of the pois
oner. The loss of Mr. Mogan's Chesa
peake has had the effect of keeping valu
able dogs out of the stores of merchants
in that vicinity and in their kennels at
home.
Hid was a thoroughly trained duck dog
and in addition was a bench show winner,
bavins taken a prize at last year's Kennel
Club exhibition. His owner would not
have sold him lor $100 and feels his los.i
Keenly.
Mr. Mean is an enthusiastic yachts
man and hud intended to forego bis trip
to Vailejo with the Corinthians on Sun
day as a result of his sorrow and is wish
ing now that he had. While the anchor
on the Eiia wa being hoisted on board
the fluke pinned his left leg against the
bulwarks of the boat, injuring him so
that he has been compelled to walk with
a cane ever nine*.

SATISFIED WITH THE WORK.
No Change in the Contract for Shoeing
Fire Department. Horse*.
The Fire Department Committee of the
Board of Supervisors took up the bid of
J. McCarthy for shoeing the horses of the
Fire Department yesterday.
A communication from the Fire Com
missioners waa read in which the state
ment was made that the department was
entirely satisfied with the manner in
which the work was being done by the
present contractor.
Chief Sullivan stated that ho wns satis
fied that the work was all right and that
$2 50 per horse pel month was as low as
the work could be performed and well
done. He stated that a few animal-*
might be done for $2 in a satisfactory
manner, but that no man could care for
the entire department in the manner re
qu red at tlia 1 price.
McCarthy was present and stated that
he could and would do the work in a sai is
factory manner at $'2 per horse. He ad
mitted that his price was sometimes
higher and that he generally charged as
much as he thought he cou:d get.
The whole matter was piaced on hie.
THE CRIME Of rORGERY,
A Sharper M>y Avoid Punishment If
He Knows the Law.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
judgment of the lower court in the case of
John Lundin, who was sentenced to serve
four years' imprisonment in San Quentin
for the crime of forgery, committed in this
City in December, 1895. To the informa
tion the defendant pleaded "not guilty,
once in jeopardy and former acquittal."
As stated, he was lound guilty. The Su
preme Court says "Under the previous
rulings of this court we are compelled to
say the evidence was insufficient to war
rant a conviction." It goes on to say :
In People vs. Whiteman, 114 Cal. 338, a case
involviug a like question, the court speaking
through Temple, J., said: '"There is no evi
dence thai the persons by whom the checks
purported to be drawn were ronl persons and
noue that, if they were real persons, defend
ant was not authorized to use their
mime. * * * To prove that an accused per
son signed the name of the name of another
10 an instrument and that he passed such in
strument as genuine does not prove the com
mission of the crime. It must still be shown
tnat it was a false instrument and this is not
proven'until it is shown that the person who
signed another's name did so without author
ity. Until this proof is made it is not shown
to be a false instrument and the defendant is
not put to bis proof at all."
The Supreme Court said that the lower
court's instructions contained aclrar expo
sition oi the law, but that the jury failed to
he governed by those instructions in ren
dering their verdict. For this reason a
new trial was ordered.

through he performance in the least time
will win the first prize.

and contestants are expected from allover
the State, from the East and from British
Columbia. Everything nas been done by
the . :li -ors of the ciub and the games
committee, in view of the worthy object
to which the proceeds will be devoted, to
make the annual gathering more than
usually attractive, and an immense crowd
is confidently expected on the grounds on
Saturday.
One of the most attractive features will
be the Burns cottage, which will contain
relics of tue bard kindly loaned for the
occasion by the owners.
There will be more than the usual num
ber of pipers, and Chief D. R. McNeil and
his able officers promise a stirring and en
joyable tune to all who attend the games.

A WHEELMAN'S AVENUE.
The Putting In Condition of First Ave
nue Opens a New Thoroughfare
to the Park.
First avenue, after years of delay, is
now being put in first-class condition
fro 11 the Presidio Reservation to the
Golden Gate Park.
With the exception of the block from
Jackson to Washington, which is being
paved with basalt blocks, the remainder
of the avenne, between the two points of
the reservation and the park, is being
bituminized and macadam zed in first
class condition. This avenue hlis c
long-felt want between those two pleasure
grounds. Now that the roadway and side
walks are being put in order the wheel
men have shown their appreciation of the
improvement by the constant use they
are making of the roadway.
In addition to tbiÂ«, several new build
ings Â»re in course of construction, which,
with other improvemems, are making the
Richmond district quite a settlement.
The contemplated removal of the City
Cemetery, on the western slopeof the bill,
facing the Richmond district, meets with
the unanimous approval of the property
owners of this section. The Point Lobos
Improvement Cub, that has been instru
mental in advancing the interest of this
district, heartily approves of the move
ment to close this cemetery. Therefore,
it remains to be seen that the Supervisor
will at no distant day be urged to pass the
necessary ordinance preventing further
interments in that place.

THE GOLD MINERS
MEET ONCE MORE
A Committed Appointed to
Confer With the Sacra
mento Committee.
The Miners Bops to Settle the
Debris Question Without
iDJuring' Any One.
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Miners' Association, Jacob H. Neff
president and Julian Sonntag secretary,
met last evening in the Union League {
Club.
The first matter of importance that came
up was the question of appointing dele
gates to the International Gold Miners'
Convention at Denver, July 7, 8 and 9, and
making an exhibit of ores and machinery
ihere.
Ir was decided that the time was too
abort for an exhibit, and as for represen
tation it was left to the president and sec
retary to find out further details of the
character of the convention and if good to
aj point five delegates, who should pay
their own expenses.
The Trans-Mississippi Congress, to
meet in Salt Lake, July 24, next came up
for cons deration. It was decided that
tne president appoint two delegates, whose ;
expensea should be paid.
The interest of ibe evening centered on
the contest between the Anti-Debris Asso
ciation and the ground and sluice miners ]
la Nevada County. On this subject there j
was pome lively debating, and nearly
every one of the committee toot a hand
in the discussion.
Tne resolutions of the committee of tne
Cbamber of Commerce at Sacramento on
the subject were read. The whole subject
of hydraulic, drift and quartz mining, and <
the relation of the farmers thereto, was
discussed at considerable length.
A committee of three was finally elected
to meet the Sacramento committee, with
the object of talking over the whole mat
ter amicably and coming to the bsst con
clusion possible, to the end that none of
the great industries of the State be in
jured.
President J. H. Neff of the California
Miners' Association was made ex officio
member o( the committee and chairman,
and the other members elected were 11 c.'
L. Ford and Andrew J. Carrigan.
It is hoped the trouble over debris min
ing may be settled by bringing the various
interests together and trying to harmonize
them.
The inhabitants of the United States
consume more than half the quinine pro
duced 'n the world.

The proposition was not received with

THE EEPTJBLIOAN PROGRAMME
The programme of action adopted by
the Republican caucus on th' tariff bill is
a wise one in cv ry respect. It provides
ample opportunity for individual Senators
to present the claims of the industries of
their constituents, while at the same time
maintaining party discipline, and further
more it gives promise of a much speedier
enactment of the bill than has b?en feared
for some time past.
Under tbis programme no set speeches
will be made by the Republican Senators.
They will content themselves with ex
plaining the various features of the meas
ure which may require explanation. Any
Republican who desire* to amend the bill
will submit his proposed amendment to a
committee which ha-i been c.iosen to con
sider it. If the committee rejects it the
proposer hns the privilege of appeal to the
Republican caucus. In this way the vote
of the whole Republican strength in the
Senate will bs brought to bear on every
issue, and the chances of carrying throueh
a genuinely protective measure will be
much incieased.
In carrying out this programme Senator
Aldricli announced in opening the debate
yesterday: "It is my purpose to keep the
bill continuously before the Senate to the
exclusion of all other legislative business
until it is finally disposed of, and in this
I shall expect the beany co-operation of
Senator.! on both sides of the chamber.''
By pushing the measure in this way it may
be possible to finish within two weeks and
to have the bill go intoeffect by the begin
ning of the next fiscal year.
True to his promise to confine himself
to explanations of disputed schedules
Senator Aldrich entered at once upon a
consideration of the sugar duties, about
which there has been ro much said and
written ever since the Finance Committee
reported the bill to the Senate. On that
subject the Senator spoke with the weight
of an established authority. He elabo
rately analyzed the whole of this compli
cated subj ct, pointed out that the bill as
reported does not give undue advantage
to beet sugars as compared with cane
sugars, and on the issue of the amoant of
protection given to refiners said: "The
protection afforded by the differentials
proposed by the Senate committee is, I
believe, not only less by percentage but
less with reference to the actual require
ments of the industry than that afforded
by rates proposed upon any other impor
tant product."
It is not to be expected that the explan
ation given by Senator Aldrich will silence
the controversy on the subject. The im
portant point is that the Senator did not
speak one moment longer than was neces
sary to make clear tliis feature of his bilL
Ho set the example of shortdirect speeches
and kept close to the programme adopted
by bi-Â» party. Tha outlook for a prompt
setilement of the issue which has so long
disturbed business is therefore encourag
ing, and if the Democrats do not commit
one of their usual blunders and begin to
filibuster and interpose obstacles we may
soon see a new tariff enacted arid the
country ready to go forward to other
things.
M'EJNLEY AND CUBA.
All reports from Washington are to the
effect that the action of the Republicans
of the House of Representatives in relu -
ing to consider the Morgan re-olution
recognizing the belligerency of the Cuban
patriots was not oue to any lack of sym
pathy with the struggling people of the
island, but solely to a desire to avoid any
thing like an attempt at forcing the hand
of the administration. It is well under
stood by the Republicans that the Presi
dent desires to secure for Cuba peace with
independence, and they intend to leave
him a free hand to accomplish that result.
Confidence in the intention and ability
of the President to carry out the pledge of
the National platform on ihe Cuban ques
tion is felt by all classes of Republicans.
Even the most ardent of Cuban sympa
thizers are not disturbed by the seeming
delay of tho administration. In a letter
read at the recent Cuban raass-meetini: in
Washington Senator Ctiandler expr ssed
the conviction of the stanch friends of
the patriots on the subject by saying:
There need be little fear that these pledges
will be viola:ed. President McKlnley willingly
recognizes the binding force of the platform
upon which he was elected, and will soon do
his part toward making Cuba free and Inde
pendent. He may proceed with what wM
seem to impatient spirits to be undue caution,
with the cries and groans ringing in his ears
of unarmed men, women and children
enduring inhuman cruelty and dastardly
muraer, but he will not fail to be faithful to
his pledges, and he will before long register
the decree which went forth in his triumphant
election, that Cuba should be taken from the
control of Spaia and made peaceful Rnc j
independent.
In this faith in a great party and its Presi
dent, let us rest patiently and most hopefu'.ly.
It is in that faith the Republicans of the
House are now waitina. They wiil do
nothing to complicate the situation or
render the duty of the President more
difficult. When he is prepared to act,
however, he can count on prompt support
from the House. The very strength by
which the majority bru?heJ aside Bailey's
attempts to force a consideration of the
Morgan resolution is a proof that it will
be able to act with vigor when the right
time comes.
SAH LUIS OBISPO.
Stimulated by the success of the San
Joaquin Valley Railroad, both as private
investment and public benefaction, the
people of San Luia Obispo County are
earnestly agitating a scheme for an east
and west railroad which shall afford the
southern counties of the San joaquin Val
ley an outlet to the sea via the city of
San Luis Obispo. The route which seems
to be considered most desirable would
have its eastern terminus at BaKersfield
and would traverse the great Carisa
Plains, thus opening up to rich possibili
ties a vast section of country thai is to-day
only a scries of immense sheep and cattle
ranges. With such a line, it is argued,
San Luis Obispo would become one of the
important seaport towns of California.
The Government is now building a
breakwater in San Luis Obispo Bay, and
those who are most enthusiastic over the
east and west railway idea prophesy the
speedy coming of the time when lines of
steamships shall be employed in commerce
between San Luis Obispo and foreign ports
direct, and when the southern counties of
the San Joaquin Valley, with their wealth
of products, shall enjoy the splendid ad
vantage of a seaport close to their doorâ
or, to be explicit, within a hundred miles
of the capital of Kern County, San Luis
Obispo being nearly due west from Bakers-
Held and almost midway between San
Fraucisco and Los Angeles.
There is certainly a future of rare
promise in store for San Luis Obispo
County. When the [Southern Pacific
Company closes the gap on the coast line
between Guadaloupo and Santa Barbara
it will share with the other counties on
the route the benefits derived from being
on a through line of travel, and the
virtues of its climate, mild and even, warm

mer, the healing properties of its ninner

ous mineral springs, the wonderful fer
tility of its soilâ a mine of vegetable goid
from which only the surface croppings
have b*en takenâ will then, upon proper
introduction to the outside world, receive
that attention and appreciation which
must beget for that portion of our State
an era of unparalleled prosperity.
While eagerly looking toward the fu
ture with its promised boons the people of
San Luis Obispo are preparing to welcome
the new era ir. a befitting manner. They
are steadily moving forward, and im
provements are to be observed there on
every nand. For instance, it may be
noted that in the county'seat several fine
brick blocks are contemplated or in course
of construction. Pisnio Beacn has re
cently changed hand-!, and rumor has it
that a magnificent caravansary will add
to the attractions of that seaside resort in
the coming year. The dairying industry
on the coast is being annually increased
In extent and value; new orchards and
vineyards are springing up throughout
tne interior of the county; and, if that
east and west railway should become a
reality, San Lais Obispo might realize the
highest anticipations ot the most hopeful
and sanguine of her people and take rank
among the leading counties of the State.
A CHINESE LEAGUE.
A circular has just been issued bearing
the title, ''First Voice of the Americanized
Chinese of the United States to the Pub
lic." It purports to be issued by "the
Chinese Equal Rights League of Amer
ica, 1 ' is dated at Chicago and signed by
Wong Chin Foo, president. The object
of the league is said to be the repeal of
the Chinese restriction law, and the cir
cular asks for moral, political and pecuni
ary aid from the American people gener
ally.
After describing the restriction law of
1882 as an outrage by which "the rights
and liberties of nearly a quarter of a
million lawful and industrious citizens of
the United States were swept away, arbi
trarily and unconditionally, for all time
to come," the circular says:
Fellow-citizens, we appeal to you to assist
us, both morally and financially, to restore to
the Americanized and American-born Chinese
of the United Statts their rights to citizen
ship ; we do not ask this for any other class of
Chinese in this country, and we have nbso
lutely no sympathy for those of our country
men who persist In their own civilization and
refuse to become Americanized, and whose
only aim is to earn money enough to return
to China ; with these we have nothing to do.
We are for the Americanized and American
born Chinese only, and ior their honor and
equal manhood we now appeal to you for jus
tice.
We feel greatly distressed to think that not
withstanding the love we. cherish in our nearts
for the home and country in which we livo,
but cannot legally call it our own, we are not
permitted to share with you in in glories and
responsibilities. We feel grieved and humili
ated every time we behold our colored breth
ren, even from the wilds of African jungles,
sit and eat from the National family table,
while we, the descendants of the oldest race on
earth, are not even alloueJ to pick np the
crumbs from under the table! We feel It. fel
low-citizens, and we weep in silence! Who
will help us? Where are the country's Wash
ingtons, Sumners, Beechers, Lincolns and
Grants?
It will be noted there is a good deal of
cunning in this appeal. The distinction
drawn between the "Americanized China
men" and those who have come litre sim
ply to niaxe money shows the smooth
blandness of Mongolian diplomacy. It
will not deceive any one on the Pacific
Coast, wher it is well known that a
Chinaman never becomes Americanized,
but it will have a persuasive effect in the
East and is likely to awaken there a sen
timent which mar prove troublesome un
leES promptly guarded against.
According to the circular it is the inten
tion of the le.igue to begin a campaign
this fall against the restriction law with
the object of presenting a petition for the
repeal of it at the next session of Con
pros*. It is announced that the league
has a contribution of $3000 to start with,
bat this it Jrankly declares is not a drop
in the bucket of wlnu will be needed in
the fight. The first step will be to hold
mass-meetings in the larger cities of ihe
Union, after which a National convention
will be called to perfect the organization
and prepare it for an incessant war against
the law.
Until something more is known of the
league than is disclosed by its 'first
voice" it will not be easy to decide whether
it ;- the i cginning of a dangerous agita
tion against Chinese restriction or only a
scheme to obtain contributions of money
on which the officials of the league can
live comfortably. The movement is at
any rate one which it will be worth our
while to watch, and it will be interestin
to see what Americans will Identify them
selves with it by contributing money or
taking part ii the proposed mass-meet
ings.

JOHN BULL CARICATURED

PEAN ARTISTS.
A collection by M. J. Grand-Carteret of cari

Westminster Gazette. They are collected from
all the .European couniriesâ Greece, France,

Denmark, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and
America. There is even one from Turkey, in
which the jubilant figure of the Sultan gives
undoubted testimony that the 'Westminster

country. The collection is an interesting one,
and may be described as a concert of p ! ctorial
and sKtirical comment on the events in Greece
and Crete. The concert of Europe comes in
for a good deal of ridicule from all quarters.
Eut the most interesting feature of the cari

Turkey on his shoulder and threatening little
Greece that if he comes a step nearer he will
knock his "blooming head" off. But perhaps
thii is not because our cousin across the her

BATTLE OF THE
BLUE AND BROWN
Another Attack Upon a
Wagon Train at Golf
Hill.
A Military Event Possessed oi
Many Attractive Realistic
Features.
A Captain Makes an Inquiry and Is
Informed That All Is Fair in Love
and Warâ To-Day's Ev.nts.
Yesterday forenoon there was in the
vicinity of the pumping plant at Moun
tain Lake at the foot of Golf Hill a repeti
tion of the field exercises of the previous
day by the infantry. Thera was more
realism yosterday tlian on the previous
day in that toe convoy, consisting of three
companies of infantry under command of
! Captain Louis P. Brant, were in the uni
form of blue, while the company that was
detailed to capture the wa^on train and
was under command of Second Lieutenant
Charles L. Bent was attired in brown
suits, and the contest was the blues
against the browns. Then in addition
there was a train of two wagons, and the
firing of blank cariridees by means of
which it became possible to note the ad
vantages that either side earned. The
movements were more deliberate and
more cautiously effected, and it was evi
dent tnat the lesson ot the previous duy
! had not been lost on the officers who were
in that engagement.
Tne train and convoy moved np the !
road that leads to Golf Hill, intending to
pass down the defile to a point west of the
pumping plant. As soon as the head of
the command reached a rise in the road
that gave a view of the open country a
halt was ordered, and, according to tac
tics, tne captain in command dismounted,
tooK a hurried survey of the ground and 1
surroundings, and then sent scouts to the :
front to reconnoiter. These moved in
three sections â one in the center, one on
the left and tne other on the right ot the
gully In which tue Browns mignt be con
! cealed. These with one exception moved
! as directeJ, the one exception beini; that
i they did not keep their distances, but that
â¢ was soon corrrected. After that small
patrols were sent oat as supports to the
scouts, and as these moved in line of
skirmishers the reserve of the convoy was !
; advanced with the wagons. In a lew mo- j
ments one oi tne scouts of the center dis
covered the Browns under cover of the
brush in which they were lying in wait
for the train to approach, and gave the
signal by raising his rifle, heiu horizon
tally, three times over his head. In the
meantime two couriers from the left >ec
tion rushed up to Captain Brant to adv;se
him veroully ot the discovery of the I
I Browns and of their location.
Upon this report the captain formed his
plan of action. He ordered a company to
the extreme right to take a position be
hind a row of pine trees, from which tho I
men could command a good view of the I
Brawns and at the same time be under ex- '
cellent siieUer. Then a portion of one com
pany, led by Second Lieutenant Dennis E. i
Nolan, marched to a small gully to be '
ready to make n center attack, whilu a skir
misu line moved through the open down
the left of the position, in which the
Browns were concealed. For a few
moments there was not a sound to indi
cate the positions of the men, but sud
denly ihere came from the direction of
Lieutenant Nolan's command a couple of
sharp reports, shots h'rea at a Brown, j
whose head popped up above the brush, j
Then came a volley from the right flank!
and a reply from t c Browns and another j
volley from the center. The right again i
engaged the Browns and tneskirniish line
on tne left gave signs of life by tiring a
round or two. About this time tha en
gagement was exceedingly realistic and
exciting, but as the ammunition was lim- |
ited to a very few rounds, the execution
by actual firing was not as effective as if
> each roan had been furnished ten rounds.
It lclt too much to the imagination in
order to carry out the further movements.
To a man on top of Golf Hill it looked
very much as if the Browns had got into
a trap in winch they would be annihilated
by superior numbers and that the Blues
had succeeded in slaughtering them or |
had forced them to retreat, and this was
emphasized wnen Lieutenant Nolan's
command made a rush across the lied
and leaped the fence into the enemy's
i pround. ' At that moment the reserve and j
the wagons passed <iown the defile ond j
reached the point of destination. When J
the men had been recalled Hiid were a-- i
gambled on the main road Cartaii J. J. j
o'ioiinell, the inspector, called upon Cap- i
tain Brant for an explanation of his I
method of attack. This he gave, and j
Lieutenant Bent told what he did with
tho Browns and explained that hi* com
mand was unaDle, for any Jengt , to cope
with tne large force which engaged ii on
all sides.
Then Captain Charles G. Starr of Com
pany F, w o was the umpire, was asked I
for his decision, and it wan quite brief. It I
was that while the Browns hart not rap- |
tured the tiain they had not been dis
lodged nor captured, tiioieuy upsetting the
opinion of the men on Golf Hill.
To this Captain O'Connell said, "Well,
bnt â well, the umpire has piven blade-'
cifion," and he was about to order the I
trooi>s to quarters, when Captain '
Brant asked why Lieutenant Bent had :
three dismounted troopers on his ground, I
and ai~o asked where their horses were. '
The lieutenant replied that the horses
were down in a guliy, and then tha cap
tain wanted to know further if the three
men In blue were no', placed there by the I
lieutenant as decoys to deceive the Blues
and then asked the inspector if that was
fair.
"Captain Brant," replied the inspector,
with Chestertieldian politeness, "you must
remember that in love and war everything
is fair, and if Lieutenant Bent could get
some men in blue to act as decoys it shows
that he has good strategic ideap." The
complimented lieutenant smiled and there
was a laugn along the line that was
checked only when the command was
given "fours right, march."
The outpost duty this morning will
cover a front of aDout 3000 yardsâ from
the gate at Central avenue to Lobos Creek.
The main line of resistance will be at the
stone wall which is being built from Cen
tral avenue west and forms the south line
of the Presidio reservation. The entire
force of the garri-on will be used to pro
tect the post from an enemy expected
from tue Â»outh. The maneuvers will be
exceedingly interesting.
COIN.NG A NEW LEGAL WORD
W. J. E. in Sew York Bun.
It is always interesting to follow the coin
ago of new words, especially when the defini
tion saves the use of many other words to
cover their meaning. The latest In legal
phraseology has recently been coined by Judge
Brmnnonofthe West Virginia Court of Ap
peals. It is the word ".'ellow-servantcy," and
was used by the Judge in an oplniou rendered
in Â»n action for damages by an employe
against a railway company. In the course of
his opinion Judie Brannon referred to -tnis
fubjrrct of feliow-servantcy (to coin a word to
express tuo idea in. one word). By fellow
servantcy we mean that whero tnete are two
servants or employes of a common master or
employe, and one of them Irom the negligent
aetof'ihe other receives it jury, the master
is uot liable for the same, becau-e when a ser
vant enters the service of a mas;er he assumes
and runs the ri-ks anddangers incident to th<>
service, and It is unreasonable rhat he should
call on the master to make gi od to him a.l
damages that may befall him Irom the acts of
any and of all f>llow-servants in the employ of
the master." Fellow-3erv mtcy will no doubt
find a place in future dictionaries.

the Hon. Mark A. Hanna, champion heavy

Queensberry rules. Mr. Fitziimmons does net
look half as much like the popular idea of a
prize-fighter as Mr. H.tnna. The latter i*
larger, broader and more erect, and lie looks
as if he might strike a more powerful blow if
he had the disposition. Mr. Fitzsimraors is (l

in conversation with a constituent.
As soon as Fitzsimnions' Dresence ly -.â :-..

Some very distinguished men had ]
business in the marble room iusi then. \\, sl
of them expressed their disappointment at

While waiting for Mr. Hanna's attention,
the page who was allowing Fttzsiminoi
|hiseseort around entertained them by ex
plaining the apparatus which the W

As soon as the gentlemÃii from Ohio was a'i

tor's cordial greeting. "We did them up,
didn't we? Both of us. You licked your man

In the number in the marble room were

"I lost a hat with the Senator," said Air.
Towne, "because you defeated i orbett."
'â¢Yes," said Mr. Mantle, "and he wrote in
thehat:'lf this does not fit you it will Fitz

will do a thing like that?"
"He ought to give me a chance to hit him
once." laughed the champion. At which sug

Spring storms first overturn
those trees which are not well
grounded Don't let these
enervating spring days find
you poorly prepared to resist
them. To have strong nerves,
rich blood, good appetite and
sound digestion is to be well
grounded. Scott's Emulsion
of Cod-liver Oil with Hypo-
phosphites will give all these,
because it nourishes the whole

Along the coast It has been nothing but
a succession of storms ana calms of late.
Up off the coast of Mendocino it would be
blowing a gale while off the Farallons it
would be a dead calm.
The bark Alden Besse was nine days
getting from the islands into port, while
the barkentine Eureka was twelve days
getting here from Puget Sound.
Captain : Potter of the Alden Besse re
ports that for three days, when off the
Farallons, he did not log three miles.
From that time on it was almost a drift
| ing match.
From the time the Eureka left Tncoma
j she encountered heavy weather, and on
the 21st inst. ran into a heavy gale. The
waves broke over her in all directions and
one of them carried away Second Mate
John Danielson. An attempt was made
| to save the man, but the sea was running
so high and the wind was so strong that
nothing could be done for the unfortun

TO LECTURE FOR DURRANT
Mrs. John Martin to Take the
Platform Next
Week.
She Wanted to Inspect the Emmanuel
Church Blfry in Order to
Be Well Posted.
Mrs. John Martin has signified her in
tention of taking the lecture platform in
behalf of Theodore Durrant. When at
the Emmanuel Church last Sunday she
asked P. D. Code, the superintendent of
the Sunday-school, to allow her to in
spect the library and the belfry where the
murders, were committed, . Superintend
ent Code, however, refused her permis
sion. She explained as the reason for her
request that she intended to deliver a pub
lic lecture on the Durrant case next week,
and wished to be thoroughly posted. In
her quest of information, Mrs. Martin has
also addressed Pastor Gibson, Miss Daisy
Wolfe and others.
Dr. Gibon has made no statement re
cently in reference to his intention to re
maining witli or leaving Emmanuel
Church. Secretary Lynch, who arrived
from the East a few days ago, does not
have to reiurn until late in the fall, and
be iias declared his intention of remain
ing as long as Dr. Gibson needs him. So
the pastor may indefinitely postpone his
resignation.
Governor Budd will be busy all day con
ferring with Durrant's attorneys, lie will
probably render his decision on the pe
tition for commutation of sentence on
Thursday, or Friday at the latest. At the
same time he will givs liis decision in the
Word en case.
Captain Lees is not seeking Governor
Budd in the matter, but is willing to
â fiord him any information in hit power.
Ho is perfectly satisfied to rest on the
official record of the case.
MBS. DIMOND'S PLANS
She Will Remain on the Stage 'and May
Stay Jti the City. .
Mrs. â . Carrie â  Dimond is ; pursuing ' her,
stage ambition with unabated interest in
spite of the fact that she was not quite
pleased with the management of her en
gagement in this City.. . :
"Tha stage i< tie only thing I see
ahead," said Mr-. Dimond yesterday, "an 1
1 am now compelled to earn n?y way, so I
intend to continue in my chosen profes
sion."
Mrs. Diraond has not ret decided
wi.etlicr she will go on the road or accept
a position in San Francisco, but she is in
clined to remain here.
"It is far easier to remain here, 1 ' said
she yesterday "than to count ties afoot
from some distant point back here again,
so I thinfc: I shall remain here. I have
nad several offers to remain in local thea
ters and I may remain right here,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 26, 1897.
ED STEVENS COMING HERE.
Edwin Stevens is coming to the Tivoli for an engagement of two months, com
mencing Monday, June 21. This will necessitate the postponing of the grand
opera season which was to have commenced in July. The news of Mr. Stevens'
engagement wili be hailed with delight by his many friends and admirers in this
City. H s last appearance here was mude with the Daly company at the Baldwin,
where his clever impersonation of the Russian general in "Countess Gucki" cre
ated a most favorable impression.
His greatest hit in New York was made in "The Ueisha," where he played the
principal comedy role for some months. Since his resignation from Daly's com
pany he has been the recipient of several very advantageous offers, one from a
London house, where he was a great favorite during the Dalys' stay there. He
has been most successful in the new operetta, "1993," recently produced in Phila
delphia.
T&e opera in which Mr. Stevens will make his reappearance at the Tivoli after
so manj- years' absence has not yet been decided on, but it will probably be some
thing brand new to San Francisco. During his engagement an elaborate produc
tion of "Wang" will be given.
IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER RATE WAR
The Shasta Route Makes |
a Further Cut in Port
land Fares.
The First-Class Rate Is Now
$15 and Is $10 by the
Steamer.
The 0 R. & N. Company Will Proba- j
bly Farthtr Reduce â Row Caused
by a Tcurist-Car.
It looks as though a rate war were im
minent, and that the people of tnis City
I and coast were going to see a hammer {
i and tongs battle with the Southern Paci
i tic on one hand, and the Oregon Railway i
I and Navigation Company on the other.
j This may not occur, but it now looks so,
and it would appear, too, that the volume j
of travel between San Francisco and
Portland, and inadvertently travel to
points beyond, would btÂ» greatly increased.
A few days a.50, as announced in Thk
Call, the Southern Pacific reduced its
rate for overland travel every fifth day
from ti is City o Portland from $-1 t<> $19
for first-clnss fares, and from $14 to $12 f^r
second clas". The road claimed that the j
Southern Pacific was at a disadvantage,
in that it wasn't getting its proper propor
tion of travel. The Oregon Railway and
Navigation rates were then $12 and $0 re
spectively.
When the latter company saw what the j
Southern Pacific had done, it promptly
reduced its rates to $10 and $> respectively.
Yesterday ths Southern Pacific Com-
I pany made a fourlh reduction. General
Passenger Agent Goodman had just re
turned ircm the transcontinental meeting
in Chicago, and no doubt when he de
bouched on the scene he thought I>p would
add his weight to Mr. Judah's efforts 10
make the situation more interesting. He
decided that beginning on Friday next
and remaining in fore* every five days
! thereafter the original f 2l rate should be
slashed to $15, and the $14 to $10. A big
placard was hung up in tne Southern Pa
cific ticket office in the Grand Hotel an
nouncing the further cut. Tue news
spread around the railroad and steamship
offices and was the general theme of con
versation. Mos everybody thought there
was a beautiiul fight on.
Assistant Passenger Agent Judah, who
was delegated as spjkesman for :he South
ern Pacific, spoke briefly about the situa
tion.
"The steamship company saw fit to
meet our reduction," he said, "and this
leaves us in the same condition we were
in before, and forces us to make a further
reduction to pet our share of the business
We do not desire to force an issue, but we
have got to be recognized.
"We have no idea what the steamer
people may do. There is still a wide dif
ferential in favor of the steamers, a?, lor
instance, their first and second class rates
are still $5 under the rail or land rate. As
to a rate war it all depends."
Mr. Ju :ah also announced another new
feature that caused lively comment in
traffic circleÂ». It is the putting on of a
daily tourist-car from Chicago via Sacra
mento to Portland, winch can be used by
passengers without change, and where a
special conductor and poner will hold
sway. Tiiis car is expected to catch lots
of travel and prove a great convenience,
and the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company doesn't seem to like it a bit.
"This will make the situation decidedly
sporty," said F. F. Connor, the agent of
the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany. "It Will just about compel us to
make arrangements with our connecting
lines and do the same thing ourselves.
We will use our own road from Portland
to Huntingion, and from there to Ogilen
can pool with the Oregon Short Lne;
from there to Denver we can use the Den
ver and Rio Granda Western and Dsnver
and Rio Grande; from Driver to Chicago
we can use either the Rock Island, the
Burlington, or one other road.
"As to the steamer busineos we now
have rates of $10 and $5, respectively, since
we made our reduction, and onr next cut
will probably b* to $5 and $2 50 unless ii
sboiiKi be thought belter to make it by
successive stages.
"The bituation presents many com
plications and I cannot yet say what we
will do, but the O. R. and N. Company
wi<l at least try to hold iis own and get its
share of tbe business. That's what it was
or^anizÂ»d for. It need be no surprise if
Mr. Huibert, tbe general agent in Port
land, telegraphs asking that another cat
be made,"
THE WRONG MAN
THROWN IN JAIL
Policeman Robl Alters a

Miss Gregoria Velasco, a dumpy-looking i
Mexican belle from the quarters where
tarnales are made, is hot on the trail of
one Manuel Cassino, whom she accuses of
Defraying her. She caused a warrant to
I be issued for his arrest last week, and the
i document was placed, in the hands of Po
j liceman P. W. Kobl for service. .:.
j All this was regular enough in its wax
if the policeman had known and attended
strictly to business; but as he did not
there is great {mashing of teeth and there
is a likelihood of "one of the finest" los
ing his star.
The story of this unfortunate affair came
I out yesterday morning in Judge Low's
j court when Manuel Casin was called
from the prisoner's dock to answer the
charge of betrayal. : ; J ;^
Casin is an aristocratic Spaniard, and
a fac:or ; in Central American politics.
After being arrested Monday afternoon on
Montgomery street he was stripped at the
! police station- of all hit jewelry ana
money, the value of which would have
amply paid his fail excepting the red-rape
regulations prohibiting such transactions.
As a consequence Casin, unabii to com
municate with his friends, remained in
'.he calaboose- all night, and was con
fronted with his accusers in the morning
in Judge Low's court.
Miss â  Gregoria Wlnsco and Manuel
Casin, her alleged betrayer, gazed upon
each other with positive amazement.
"I don't know that woman," asserted
Casin. â¢ ,
"That is not Cassino," declared the
woman. .
Judge Low was at a loss to know what
to do until ho listened to Policeman Jiobl's
tale. .:â â¢..:.â¢.. '.â .;.-â . - .â â â .-â â¢ ;â .â ,,-
He had been intrusted with a warrant
for the arrest of Manuel Cassino, and
Manuel Casin had been pointed out to

crepancy in the name, according to the
officer was but a clerical error, so he used
the rubber at the end of his pencil to cor
rect matters by wiping out an "a" in the
middle and an "o" at the end of the name
"Casino." .';' ' ; . ..
"This case is dismissed,'' Judge-Low
ordered. "Officer, you have arrested the
wrong man." : : â â â â :â¢ "-.-. -, â¢
The case will not be allowed to rest there,

not propose to crow very muc.i older be

MAX'S TRACING
WAS FOUND AWRY
The Expert Permits Mrs.
Craven to Score a Good
Point.
Comparisons of Writing That
Did Not Bear Out His
Sworn Evidence.
It Was a Long and Tedious S sucn in
Wbicii Cbirographical Oddities
Were Talked About.
Expert Max Gumpel bubbled over while
essaying to cast dark shadows on the va
lidity of the "pencil" will during yester
day morning's proceedings in the Fair-
Craven trial, and the retult was that a
heavy fall was taken out of him by Attor
ney W. W. Footo of the defense.
It hajinened that the excitable Max had
resorted to a new process of demonstra
tion and illustration in giving his evi
dence. He had put aside his microscopes
and other scopes and substituted in their
places a number of sheets of gelatine pa
per with which he proceeded, aided by his
acrobatic pen, to make tracings of certain
words in the disputed will in order to
show that they were duplicated in appear
ance often enough to warrant his opinion
that the will itself was a fabrication of
tracings. He picked out the word "be
queath," traced it, and then told the jury
that his tracing would fit to a nicety every
"biqueath" that appeared in the will. He
was getting along bwimmingly until he
fell into the hands of Mr. Foote, who had j
asked permission of the court to ask the
witness a question or two.
Mr. Fooie, It soon developed, had found
some "bequeaths" that the Gumpel trac
ing did not fit, and he took the expert
sharply to task for attempting to lead tlie
jury astray.
Gumpel became somewhat rattled and
insisted that it was a good tit.
â¢'Oh, it is>, is it? " said Mr. Foole. "Well,
we will see about that."
The attorney placed the tracing over
one of the words under discussion and
handed it to the jury. It was easily ob
served that there was half an inch of dif
i ference in the length of the two words, and
b utiittle similarity otherwise.
That was a hard one on Gnmpel, and
Mr. Foote smiled tr.umphantly.
Gumpe! consumed ttie remainder of the
forenoon session in attempting lo demon
strate on the blackboard tue truth of his
assertion that the "pencil" will was put
together slowly and with a hesitating
hand. He depended for the greater pan
of his opinion upon the alleged wsverine
of inn lines and absence of "pen pressure"
in proper placps.
Gumpel resorted to his gelatine paper
again when court reconvened for the
aiternoon 'ps*ion, this time, at the di
rection of Mr. Mitchell, makiiiT a tracing
of the word ''dollars" on tlie tifth line of
the will. The tracing was iilnc.-d in evi
dence and marked as an exhibit for the
plaintiff.*, after which the jury was given I
an opportunity to examine and see if the
! expert had executed an honest copy. Tlie
process of shifting tlie tractujx from one to
I anotherof the words "Moliars." appearing
in various places in the will, was then
gone through with, and the members of
itie jury were kept marching around in n
circle and in turn bending over Gumpei's
experimental table, so as to get a equiut
at his handiwork.
It was very like the scene one witnesses
at n funerel when the crief-stricKen
friends and relatives of the departed lile
j by the casket and tuka their farewell look
j at the marble-like features of the corpse.
By the time this had been repeated half
I a dozen or more times it was plain that
the twelve men, good and true, were get
ting weary of the performance and were
inclined to look upon it all as monkey
busines?, to borrow a favorite expression
irom the streets. It got so finally that
instead of studying Gumpsl's compar
sons carefully and suspiciously they
would content theniseives with just a
passing glance, and some of them even
slipped out of the rotating procession and
didn't 100K at Gumpel's gelatine at nil.
Another "dollars," appearing on the
second page of the will, was next traced
and the jurors' in6rryÂ«Ko-round was put in
motion again. Gumpel said that in his
judgment tnis particular word was an
other copy. By means of his ".-pyglass,"
as Mr. Foote always calls it, ho thought
he could detect evidences of the word
having been pieced together ami after
ward retouched.
The expert got mixed up with Mr. Foote
over this tracing.
The attorney had been making some
more comparisons himself and ha 1 lound
that Gumpel's tracing did not fit one of
the words "dollars" at all.
He lost no time in calling attention to
the discovery. Gumpel shifted the trac
ing sround and around in an effort to
remedy the discrepancy, but Mr. Foote
pushed him away from :he tabie and de
manded that the jury take another look
at the tracing and the original.
This ths court ordered done.
Gumpel wanted to explain and being
granted the privilege ?aid that the person
who executed the pencil will could have
traced part of the word at one time and
part at another. For this reason be said
the gelatine tracing would not jibe with it
unless it was shifted so as to make two
comparisons â that is, separate compari
sons of each half of the word.
"But you have sworn here that this
word is not a tracing at all; you hnve
sworn that it is a copy," declared Mr.
Foo;e.
Gumpel squared himself by acknowledg
ing that he meant "copy" instead of
"tracing," but he could not convince Mr.
Foote that his experiment with thtt word
â¢dollars" was ii any way a success or
that it would work with the jury.
At this juncture of the proceeding Asso
ciate Counsel Wheeler made a formal re
quest that the plaintiff be permitted to
make an elaborate experiment and demon*
stration in court for the purpose of lend
ing support 10 their claim that various
words in the will had been traced. What
he proposed to do was to have each juror
write his name ten times, and then have
Gumpel show with his gelatine that in no
case would any two of them be found

alike, as is alleged to be the case with
some of the words in the will.
"I shall permit no more time to be
wasted in experiments in this case, Mr.
Wheeler," said judge Slack, with an
emphasis and positiveness of tone that left
no room for an argument on the sulject.
Gumpel was allowed to run loose over
the will from this point on to the nour of
adjournment. He devoted most of his
time to picking out additional words
which, he claimed, had either been
pieced, retouched or traced. A good deal
of it was going over old ground, and ia all
was so dull and uninteresting tliat the
lobby was soon deserted, and only thos*
whose business kept them in the court
room remained to see the show out.
There was but one little stir of Jife be
fore the curtain fell, and that was an
other collision between Gumpel and his
Nemesis, Foote.
Ttie expert was demonstrating again on
the blackboard, when Mr. Foote discov
ered that t tie chalk copy of Fair's writing
was far from rpsembling the original.
"Look here!" said the attorney. "Do
you mesn to say that you have made an
honest cody of those words?"
"No. I was only illustrating â that's
all,'' reclied Gump<Â»l.
"IllostratinE â eh? Are you not trying
to fool somebody 1"
"I couldn't fool you," said Gumpel.
"No; you bet you couldn't. But you
might fool the jury. What I want to
know is what you did that for?"
"Oh, it wa* just carelessness," replied
the expert rather abashed.
"So it's carelessness now, is it?" said
the attorney sarcastically. "Well, has
there been any carelessness about your
other experiments here?"
Gumpel pleaded that there had not, and
then he was released lrom his uncom
fortable predicament.

The metal- roofers of this City have won

There is considerable interest in legal
circles over the Supreme Court's late de

Several phases of the law have not even ;
yet received thorough consideration, but
it is evident that the County Clerk's fees
have been largely curtailed. It iÂ» not cer
tain that there will not be a great many
demands for rebates in the case of ap

Under one of the provisions of the act
of March 28, 1895, the Clerk is empowered
to collect $1 on each thousand appraised
above tee sum of $3000. This provision
has been held void, and it is under it that
many thousands of dollars have been col
lected. It is as iollows:

The first event of the evening, a three-round contest between Ryan and Elmer,
will be called at 8 o'clock sharp, and if Elmer is as good a man as his friend* pro

It is not yet known whether there will
be many contests or demands for the fees
paid without warrant, nor is it by any
means certain that the fees paid without
protest can be colircted. The County
Clerk is not worrying bo much over the
prospect of having to refund as over the
curtailment of the revenues of the office.
It is difficult to estimate just how great
the losses will be to the City in the course
of a year, but they will be very larpe,
probably from $20,000 to $30,000 annually.

Building Still Continues Active With
Ssveral Important Contracts
Going to Record.
The dullness that comes with the sum
mer months in the real estate market is
beginning to make iiself apparent, and
agents are resining themselves to the fact
that but little business can be done until
people with money return from the coun
try prepared to invest. About the only
movement made in the marset during the
past week has been the continued activity
in the building line. A large number of
owners are infesting in all parts of the
City, and flats and residences are being
built by the dozen. The outside districts
all have their improvement clubs, which
are hard at work for the benefit of their
various sections. At Richmond, the south
side, in the valley of the Mission, at Pre
sidio and Ashbury Heights, and in all
other quarters the small property-owners
are united for improvement. The spirit
of progress animates the masj of small
holders and they are alive to the necessity
of improving streets, laying new sidewalks
and otherwise putting their property in good
condition.

INJURED BY
A BOY'S FIST
Flossie Brush Was Nearly
Killed by Russell
Hovell.
A Petty Childish Quarrel That
Almost Resulted in a
Fatality.
The Little Girl, Who Lives on Twenty
S xtb Street, Is Stff ring Frcm
P.Titonitis.
Little Florence Brush, a child not yet 7
years of age, living ac 4023 Twenty-sixth
street, is lying 'at death's door from the
effects of a blow received from Russell
Hovell, a schoolboy, whose parents reside
near the west end of Twenty-fourth street.
The affair was as peculiar as it was un
fortunate. Flossie, as she is familiarly
called, has b.Â»en attending the primary
department of the James L ; .ck Grammar
School. On Wednesday last she went to
school as usual, and in the afternoon a
childish quarrel arose between the little
girl and the Hovell boy, wno is about 9
years old.
From what can be learned the lad took
a pencil from the child and the teacher
told him to return it to the owner. The
latter claims that young Hovell did so, but
that ne returned it and kicked her npon
the leg and followed the kick by a aavage
blow with his fi*t in the abdomen. Both
produced an effect little looked for. It
seems that last February the girl was
severely scalded upon the leg and the
kick broke open the nearly healed sore.
The blow in the abdomen caused Flossie
great pain and for half an hour sbe sobbed
and cried. For all that the teacher, who
was a substitute for Miss Asher for the
day, kept the child at her desk until
sc.iool was dismissed at 2:30 o'clock.
Flossie reached the street, where she

Nearly Killed by a Little
Schoolmate's Fist.
fainted and had to be carried to her home
by the larger pupils. The rest of the
story was learned from the child's mother.
Mrs. Brush is the widow of George A.
Brush, the celebrated rrninerwho became
so prominent at the World's Fair for his
artist c productions. She said that her
little girl, who is a delicate, fragile child,
was in a dead fain t when she was brought
home. Upon recovering consciousness
she told how she was injured and said
that the boy Howell bad been in the habit
of teasing and maltreating her. As
the day passed the little one's sufferings
became intense and at times sbe was "out
of her head" and raving, begging piti
fully not to be sent back to school, as she
was afraid of the boy who had kicked
and struck her. On the followine morn
ing Dr. C. E. McPherson of 234 Harriett
strret was called in and be found Flossie
suffering with all the symptoms of peri
tonitis. The doctor stated that the kick
on the shin wa-t of itself sufficient to have
caused such a delicate child to have nerv
ous prostration, and for several days he
was apprehensive that the added injury in
the side wouid prove fatal.
Until last night the child was un
able to eit anything except one spoon
ful of icecream. Nourishment and stimu
lants were given scientifically. D'irinÂ«Â»
the entire six days Flossie has suffered*
most excruciaiiug pains, and only a small
part of the time has she bean conscious.
Dr. .McPherson stated last evening that
ihere is a possibility that her life may be
saved, as the fever in the abdomen seemed

from being out of danger.
Mrs. Asher, the regular teacher, called
upon the unfortunate family, bhe said
that the youngster who is accused of being
the cause of all the trouble denied having
abused the iittJe girl. No one seems to
know where the boy live?, as he has not
been at school since the result of the blow
became known. It is evident that Mrs.
Asher' s substitute did not think that the
blow was of much importance, for she has
not called to see how tho child is. So con
stantly has Mrs. Brush attended her
child, waiting on her night and day, that
she is completely prostrated, and neigh
bors have gone to her assistance. While
tho child is still in great danger, there is
still some ground for the hope that she

GASOLINE VESSELB.
They May Carry Pas*engerÂ§ Under Cer

John Bermiugham, Supeivising Inspec
tor of the First District, has addressed the
following circular to the United States
Local Inspectors at this port:
Gentlemen: Referring to my inntructions
daied WasuinKton, D. C, April 13, 1897, pro
hibiting gasoline vessels being allowed to
carry passengers, I have to state that same
were tiie result of a conference with the su
pervising Inspector-General ot Steam Vessels.
A later discussion of the matter caused a
contrary decision to be reached.
The above instructions ot April 13, 1897, are,
therefore, countermanded, and you are here
by informed that gasoline boats may be li
censed to carry passengersâ vide laÂ«t parH
graph of Department Circular No. 28,
February 18, 1897.
A short time ago orders were issued
prohibiting gasoline vessels from carrying
passengers. Under the provisions of the
foregoing orders they may take passen-
Kors, but they must do so under the re
strictions of the order-providing for bulk

ANOTHER FAST GUNBOAT.
â 
The Marietta, Sister Ship of the
Wheeling, Makes Good
Time.
Her Bailders Sure That She Will
Exceed Coasiderab y the Re*
quired Speed.
The progressive trial trip of the gunboat
Marietta, whose sister ship, the Wheel
ing, madÃ such good time on Monday, was
made yesterday. The vessel left the
Union Iron Works at 10 o'clock in charge
of Captain Goodall and having on board
Captain Sumner of the Monadnock, rep
resenting the Board of Inspection, and
Robert Forsyth of the Union Iron Works.
The Marietta proceeded to the meas
ured course near California City, where
yesterday's trial trip was held, and made
a number of double runs over tbe mile
course at various speeds, beginning at
seven or eight knots and increasing tne
speed each time. The object of ihe trial
was to determine the efficiency of the pro
pellers from the number of revolutions to
the mile at different speeds. All on board
were thorouehly satisfied with the gun
boat's performance, and the whole trial
trip passed off without a single mishap.
The official trip of the Marietta will
take place to-day. Tbe data obtained
in yesterday's trial will be used in deter
mining the gunboat's speed. No effort
will be made to run the boat at t;>p speed,
as the builders receive no bones ior a
speed greater than specified, and they do
not wish to subject the engines to unnec
essary strain.
The Union Iron Works people are per
fectly confident tnat she will more than
come up to the required speed of twelve
knots.

tion of the Various Departments
a d Colleges-
The expense budget of the State Uni
versity was the subject of a lons session
of the Board of Regents yesterday, at
which Governor Budd presided. With an
ii come of $416,222 88 for the coming year,
the scale of outlay was tiled at $415,900 78
by tie regents, leaving a balance of
$320 10. Last year there was a deficit of
$8430.
To keep this balance on the right side
of the ledger some fancy figuring was
done by the finance committee. To ac
complish this result it was necessary to
use the pruning-knife in many places.
The income of' the institution is $56,271
greater this year than last, thanks to the
last Legislature, but this additional ap
propriation must be utilized in permanent
improvements. Of tnis sum $40,000 has
already been appropriated for building
purposes. Last year the salary-roll was
$229,684, which is this year increased to i
$260, 754. Of this increase, $25,720 has been j
set aside to provide new men in the \
faculty, and $5320 is to be devoted to in- j

FOR TORTURING A BOY.
! Three M*n and a Police 0 ficer
Accused of Perjury by
J. Reynolds.
Johnson Is Re indie ted for Receiving
S'o'en Goodsâ Busy S=ss on of
tbe Gr.mJ Jury.
The Grand Jury yesterday went into
Judge Seawell's court and presented a
second or reindictment against Edward
Jobnson for receiving stolen goods. A few
weeks ago John Black and Jobnson were
in'licteu for stealing goods in British Co
lumbia and bringing the stolen proper y
to this City. J. N. E. Wilson, attorney
for the parties from whom the goods were
stolen, believed that the first indictment
might be defective so far as it related to
Johnson, and therefore the second was
obtained. On motion of Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Hosmer the court fixed
Johnson's bail at $10,000.
The Grand Ju:y beard Census Marshal
Wartiel and Alexander W. McPberson, a
Deputy Marshal, in regard to the time
charged for their services in talcing the
recent school census. It seems that Mr.
Wardell worked eight hours a day as
Marshal and then worked eight hours the
same day as clerk. His demand for forty
live days' service, amounts to $700. The
jury will consider the subject aÂ«ain next
Friday.
James Reynolds bad a story to toll to
the Grand Jury. The narrative, while not
altogether new, is decidedly interesting.
Fourteen months ago Reynolds' boy
Thomas', aged 17, wan strung up by the
neck in a barn on (be San Bruno road. It
is a-serted that the men concerned in the
torture of the boy were William Riordan,
Charles Herold and J. Lsopoid. The pun
ishment was inflicted to make the boy
conies* that be had stolen money from
Herold. Sucu Â« confession was extorted,
but t tie father claims that the boy was in
nocent, not knowing in his terror and
pain what he dlv confess. Whether
guilty or innocent the boy, on the testi
mony of these three men and Officer P.
McKenna, was sent to San Quentin.
James Reynolds, the father, told the
Grand Jury yesterday that he had in bis
possession convincing proof that Officer
McKenna and the men concerned in the
torture of the lad committed downright
perjury. The police officer swore belore
Judge Low and Judge Cook that he inter
viewed the boy in prison between the
hours of 8 and 10 p. m. of April 1, whereas
the record is clear that the boy was not at
that time In prison. The clficer further
swore that at that interview the boy con
fessed to stealing $50 of Herold's money.
James Reynolds has instituted civil
suit to recover $20,000 lrom the men who
tortured his son, and now seeks to have
them and the officer indicted for perjury.
One of the Judges is quoted as having
said that Officer McKenna made a mis
take in bis testimony, a< he could not
have talked witii the hoy at the time men
tioned in his testimony.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY *J6, 1897.
WEPT OVER THE
BOX OF ASHES
But Witness Curtis Shed
No Tears During the
Saloon Scene.
Proficients in Photography and
Handwriting Crop Up in the
Davis Case.
Indications That the JVel'-Worn Road
of "Expert Testimony" Will Be
Traveled Aga n.
Increased interest was manifested in the
Jacob Z. Davis will contest in Judge Cof
fey's court yesterday.
The proceedings were spirited from start
to finish, and the parties to the litigation
appeared more at ease. On the opening
day the claimants under the will, Mn.
Belle Curtis and Miss Lizzie Muir, were
somewhat agita'ed, but the nervous ten
sion was diminished as court proceed
ings became more familiar, and they were
able to join in the appreciation of the pas
sages of wit between Attorney Knight and
tbe witness on the stand.
In addition to tiie array of lawyers en
gaged in the case, a number of experts in
handwriting and photography were no
ticed hovering about the courtroom, indi
cating that the usual means of proof and
counterproof in regard to forgery or gen
uineness of the will in question will be re
sorted to in the trial now pending.
Charles M. Wilson, a hali-brother of
Mrs. Stead and Joseph P. Wilson, was
present iv court, having just arrived from
the East.
Tue issue of forgery will ba presented
squarely to the jury, tue contestants-
Catherine Stead and Joseph P. Wilson â
claiming a right to innerit, as niece and
nephew of the deceased, and asserting
that the $2,000,000 estate ought to be dis
tributed to them instead of to the persons
named in the will, said legatees being
nieces of the late wile of the testator.
In Monday's proceedings John M. Cur
ti-, nusb.md of one of the legatees, testi
fied to n ii'! ing the will iiere presented in a
copper box which contained the cremated
remains of Mrs. Davis, wife of the testa
tor. He explained that he was impe led
to look there for the will because search
in other directions had been fruitless, and
because Mr. Davis told his partner, Alex
ander Boyd, that he had made a will in
which lie had remembered the gins, mean
in? Mrs. Curtis and Miss Muir.
On the opening of court Jonn M. Curtis
resumed his testimony.
George A. Knight's first demand was for
the round-cornered copper nox containing
the ashe-i of the late Mrs. Jacob Z. Davi?,
and it was produced. It proved to be
9x6 inches in size and 4 inches deep.
With the box resting on the railing of
the bar in front of him Mr. Kuight
launched into an inquiry touching the re
lations of the late Mr. Davis to the State
Mining Bureau. Il was shown that Mr.
Davis was a frequent visitor to the office
of the State Mineralogist, und that Mr.
Curtis usually accompanied him. The
visits occurred in the atternoon and even
ing. Mr. Davis was creatly interested in
the State Mining Bureau. He said the
bureau had been robbed once and ha was
anxious about the Diace. HÂ« would go at
night to see whether the watchman was
on duty.
Mr. Davis made a donation of a valuable
collection of mineral specimens to u.e
State Mining Bureau. He was also a
member of the Academy of Sciences, the
Microscopical Society, the Socieiy for tbe
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
other organizations.
It was shown that Mr. Davis gave $10,000
to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, and that he waa
liberal to other public institutions. He
contributed a number of curiosiiies to the
museum Ht Go. den GÂ«te Park.
Mr. Curtis related that Mr. Davis had a
penchant for collecting curios, and bis
house now contains many articles of value
and beauty that he had gathered from dif
ferent parts of the world during bis
travels.
Information was next sought by Mr.
Knignt touching a status called "Re
becca," which cost $2500. Mr. Cunis said
he had seen the statue and regarded it as a
beautiful production, but he did not know
whether it was given to the Academy of
Sciences or tbe State Mining Burpau. He
did not know what became of the big crys
tal clobe that M r. Davis prized very highly.
When Mr. Knight asked whether Mr.
Davis had a "bobby" for gathering curi
osities, Mr. Curtis said he didn't know
whether he hail anything like that or not.
"Don't you know what the word 'hobby'
means?" asked Mr. Knight.
"No."
"Never hear it before?"
"Don't think I ever did.' 1
'â¢Well, if you never heard the word
'bobby' before, you are to be excused."
was Mr. Knight's closing remark, as he
turned to another subject.
A detailed history of the drawing of
plans for tbe Dunkard church was given.
Mr. Curtis said tie drew some plans for
Mr. Davis, but the Jatter did not tell him
about bis relationship to Rev. Ar bur
Mack, founder of the church. Mr. CurtiÃ
did not remember having provided for a
fireproof vault in tbe plans for the
cuurch, nor did he ever hear the decedent
-ay that be wished to have tbe relics of
bis ancestors placed there for safe keeping.
In reply to Mr. Knight the witness said
he had no pow -r of attorney or other au
thority for taking possession of the box
containing tbe asÂ»es of Mrs. Davis. He
did that at txie request of Mr. Boyd, sur
viving partner of the firm of Boyd & Davis.
An explanation of Mr. Curtis' testimony
of the day before, touching the depositing
of the will in the copper urn containing
Mrs. Davis' ashes, was taken up. Mr. Cur
tis said he did not actually see the will put
in the '; box, as he turned , aside to conceal
his emotion. '
"Did you weep very copiously asked
Mr. Knight. *
"Well.it didn't wet the floor," replied
the witness quietly.
"Why aid you shed tears?" . w.:
"Well, Mr. and Mrs. Davis had been
very kind tome and I was overcome by
my feelings." " -\. :â â â â :â¢ â '..<
"Now, isn't it true that you swore thai
you and Mr. Davis, after coming back from
the crematory â  with .Mrs. Davis' : ashes in
that copper box under your arm, went into
Newman's saloon for refreshments?" â  t : .
V '"Yes." ' " "'â  â .''";' ,'" %M'< \
. "Did you break down and burst into
tears while you were in a ginmill with
the sacred ashes or remains of Mrs. Davis
in your possession?" ,
"Ho." â - â¢ 'â â¢> â  â â 'â 'â â â â .. ! * â  '. ''
Attorney Campbell objected to the term
"einmill" and Mr. Knight said he would
withdraw ' ginmiU"' and call it a saloon.
â¢ Mr. Curtis confessed that it was a sa
loon that he visited. He went there lor
a sandwich. : . -- .Â». â  â¢ -J .'â¢ â¢
"But that isn't a restaurant, where peo
ple go for sandwiches, :is it?" persisted
Mr. Knight. â¢ .... iÂ»;V- ,
"No." 'â â â  - â  â  ''" " : ' : â  â â¢â  â¢ â¢ .
"Then isn't it a fact that|all you c*n|get
there is a side luncti or a little snack?"
"It's a pretty big snack."
"But, after all, it is a free lunch that
you get with your cocktail, isn't it?"
* "I don't think we took cocktailsâ l
didn't say so." --^ -~\
"Well, what did you take?"
Mr. Campbell interposed an objection,
which was sustained by the court, on the
ground that it was immaterial what Mr.
Davis and Mr. Curtis partook of in the
way of edibles or notables at that time.
Cross-examination by Mr. Campbell oc
cupied the greater part of the afternoon.
Mr. Curtis again told of the conversation
between the late Mr. Davis and Mr. Boyd,
as related to him by Mr. Boyd, which led
to the prolonged search for the will. The
situation whs thus described: Mr. Davis
and Mr. Boyd were sitting at their desks
in the same room, when Mr. Davis said:
"Mr. Boyd, I'm going East and 1 want to
get away as soon as possible."
Mr. Boyd said: "Have you made your
will?"
To this Mr. Davis replied: "Yes."
Then Mr. Boyd said: "I hope you have
not forgotten the cirls. "
The answer of Mr. Davis was: "I have
provided for them."
Air. Curtis said he dia not see the coffin
plate put in thecopper urn containing ihe
incinerated remains of Mrs. Davis. He
thought it was -p deposited by the em
ployes of the crematory. A' the time he
and Mr. Davis went to MontapuÂ«'s store
for the purpose of ordering the box Mr.
Davis said he wanted i. big enough to
contain his ashes as well as i lie ashes of
his wife; that he wanted to have his ashes
minglod with hers after his death.
This wish has not yet been complied
with, as Mr. Duvis' ashes are now in Phil
adelphia. It is supposed that they are in
the trraveynrii of the Dunkard chnrch,
Germantown, one of the suburbs of Phila
delphia.
The case will go on to-day, it will
probably last a month, as no trial in San
Francisco is worth hearing unless it occu
pies the attention of the court lor at least
four weeks.
CONTRACTORS WARNED.
Architect Shea May Take
Charge of Work on the
Hall of Justice.
Indignant Property-Owners Appear
Before the Building Ccmmittee
of the Supervisors.
Bateman Bros., contractors for the Hall
of Justice, have been given the alternative
of beginning active work on the building
at once or having the operations started
under the supervision of Architect Shea
and at their expense.
Th' matter came up before the Buildings
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday, John Shirley, George D. Shad
burne, Geortre Burton and ex- Supervisors
Rogers and Bodtish being present to pro
test against the present methods of thÂ«
contractors. Mr. Shadburne read the fol
lowing section of the contract in support
of his contention that the architect
should take charge of the construction at
once:
If at anytime during the currency of the
contract the contractor should not be making
proper and reasonable progress with the work,
or should be unnecessarily delaying the ssme,
either by susptnding the work, by neglecting
to provide suitable material or by not employ
ing a sufficient number of qualified workmen
on the same so as to insure ttie completion of
the contract within tne stipulated time, and
on the demands of the architect fail to pro
vide sufficient suitable matprials, or to em
ploy a sufficient number of efficient workmen
as rvquiru . by him, or should in any way ne
glect to proceed diligently with the work, the
architect shall b(> at liberty, alter giving the
contractor thrue days' notice of his intention
so to do, to provide such materials and em
ploy such workmen as he may consider neces
sary :o proceed with the work and the cost of
the same shall be charged to the contractor.
Chairman Kheehan stated that he wai
willing 10 have the architect take charge
of the work if the contractors did not show
due diligence by the next meeting day of
the committee.
M. C. Bateman of the contracting firm
was present and was given notice tiiat any
further delay would cause the architect to
take charge at once.
GENERAL DIAMOND'S
HIDDEN ROMANCE
Pretty Mrs. Theresa Abell
Claims Ten Thousand
Dollars,
She Says That She Was En
gaged to Marry Him and
Loaned Him Money,
Bat He Revoked the Assignment of
the Policy anl the Case Is
Now en Trial.
i
Judge Morrow was engaged yiaterday
in the trial of the case of the Perm Mutual
Life Insurance Company against the
Union Trust Company and Mrs. Theresa
Abell.
Mrs. Abell claims to be the affianced of
the late William Henry Dimond, and al
leges that $10,000 alleged to be due on ai:
endowment policy on his life should be
paid to her.
The insurance company is in doubt as
to whether she or the Union Trust Com
oany, representing the estate of the'de
ceased, is entitled to the money. Hence
the suit.
The deceased took out the policy on May
31, 1893, agreeing to pay $597 per year as
premium. On the Bth of June, 1893, he
made an assignment of the policy in favor
of Mrs. Theresa Abell, and on November
19, 1895, he revoked the assignment. Both
the assignment and the revocation were
made on blank forms, at the head of
each appearing the printed word "abso
lute."
Mrs. Abell allege? that the assignment
to her was therefore absolute, and that he
was therecy debarred from revoking it.
Counsel for the estate of the deceased con
tended that the assignment was not abso
lute, and thai the printed word at the
head of the blank should not be regarded.
Mrs. Abelt was not allowed to testify as
to the fact of her being engaged to marry
Dimond, he being dead, but George D.
Knowles swore that General Dimond told
him that Mrs. Theresa Abell and he were
engaged to be married.
Mrs. Abell testified that the policy was
assigned to her in consideration of love
and affection and of $2100 loaned by her
to the deceased.
The case will be taken up again on
June 3
TOOK HER PIANO.
Mrs. Schloh's Pistol Did >'Â«t Terrorize
the Officers of Sausalito
Yesterday.
Charles de V. Minnas, attorney for Mrs.
Schioh of Sausalito, has applied to County
Cierk Curry for certitied copies of the
bankruptcy proceedings in the case of
Schioh & Lumler, music-dealers, for the
purpose of beginning an act'ou lor ilam
aees against Kranich & Bach of New
York.
Kranich & Bach were creditors of
Scliloh & Lumler to the extent of about
$4000, and when ttie petition in insol
vency was filed they looked around to tind
something to hold as security for the
debt.
While Schloh & Lumler were doing
business as the Pacific Music Company
Mrs. Schloh bought a piano from them,
trading another instrument for it and
paying $70 to boot. Learning of this
transaction the Eastern creditors of the
firm went to the lady's borne yesterday
and demanded the return of the new in
strument.
Mrs. Schloh complains that when she
declined to deliver the piano, claiming it
as her own personal property, the persons
making the demand, assisted by the offi
cers of Sausalito Township, broke opec
her door, whereupon she drew a pistol,
which was wrenched from her band, after
irfaiofa the piano wat tafcen from the house.
Mr. Mnsaus declares that the proceed
ings were illegal and says he will proceed
to i lie full extent o: the law in vindicating
the righi^ of his client.
la Favor of a Suit.
The Finance and Judiciary Committee of the
Board of Supervisors decided yesterday to re
port favorably on the suijeesiion of the City
and County that theShlels Estate Company be
sued by the City for possession of certain Mis
sion Creek lands near the junction of Brannan
and Dore streets. The lands were held by
William Sbiels and at his death passed into
ttie hands of the company that it is proposed
to sue.

following, faithfully your family doc-
tor's advice, you are not getting well,
why do you not try | another course ?

written ,to Mrs. Pinkham, of Lynn,
Mass. stating â  her symptoms plainly

was promptly received. The follow-
would get well. I had female troubles
in their worst form, suffered untold

NfcTV YORK EXCHANGE.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 25.-The short Inter
est in the stock market confessed defeat in a
number of quarters to- ay and closed parties to
contracts in Sugar Refining; because of advices
from Wash on foreshadowinz fairly promDt
action upon the tariff bill and the probab.e adoo
no.i of the sugar srbedu es reported by the
Finance Committee. The bears on Jersey Central
were disconcerted by '.lie evidences of support of
thai stock, while in Chicago Gas the alacrity with I
which the Illinois Senate reversed its action of
last week by pa-slut: both the frontage and con- I
so.idation bills took Dearly every one by surprise !
The covering movement- "extended 10 Western
Union, resulting In a net advance of a point in I
the price of thu stock-, while nil the four etoi ks i
â  named, except Chicago Gas, closed about a I.' lit '
higner than yesterday. The list as a whole
showed a good deal of irregularity. Thi* wai be
cause of the improvement in prices to-day, nnd
a Idea to that of yesterday induced speculative
holders to realize profits by supply the Â»ecm
inely urgent demands of their opponents.
'â  â¢' In view of the narrowness of the market, this |
policy cannot be criticized from a speculative !
point of view. The fact remains, however, that a
more cheerful sentiment is beginning to prevail
en Wall stieei, largely because of the tariff pros
pect* referred to. tit-si railway earning* show
an improving tendency, and foreign trade sta
tistic, mc udlnc those of exports of general mer
chandise, show a gradual shifting of the merchan
dise movement In favor of the United Mta.es. The
total transactions were somewhat iarser than for

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MARKET.
. Tbe following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by K. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grain broker, 412 Pine street. s , , Â..
San Fbawcisco, May 25, 1897.
Chicago.
- Wheat opened fractionally lower than yester
day's dose on indifferent English rabies. The
feeling was bearish throughout It looked, as if
I the market was ready for a good break. This
I feeling was more or less checked by French mar
i kets, which were considerable higher. On this
I showing fairly good buying steadied the market,
I and for a time it looked as If the longs would force
;an advance. Their fooii . intentions were loit
when cosing Frenco cables quoted the market
lower and unsettled. â¢ -
Karly buyers began selling, causing a decline in
July /42, 70y 2 c, where the market closed, against
71 V 4Â©713/ 8 c at the opening. Crop conditions re
ported fro ii many sections lire line. The demand
for - pot wheat Is very poor. This is the strong
I card played by shorts, who are becoming very en
| thusiaitlc in their belief in low r prices.
It seems hard to get. outsiders to come Into the
market at -a . time when moneyed Interests are
favorable tv d pressed prices In order to buy from
producers as cheaply as possible. '
Ihe conditions in , nglaud and France are not
favorable to large crops, however. It will take
four to six weeks before actual results are known.
Ihe. , should our wheat be wanted, prices will
advance to a point in keeping with the situation.

WHEN GRANT VISITED JAPAN.
Moat Impoiiing Pageant of H in Tour Wan
in the Flowery X ingduin.
"There was no pageant in General
Grant's journey around the world more
imposing than the reception given by the
Mikado at Japan's capital,'' writes John
Russell Young in the Ladies' Home Jour
nal.
"The United States steamer Richmond,
bearing General Grant and his party,
steamed iuto Yokohama, the harbor of
Tokio, escorted by the Asliuelot and a
Japanese man-of-war, on July 3, 1879.
There was assembled a fleet of war
ships of other powers. At noon the
admiral's barge, flying General Gram's
flag as ex-Presideni, and conveying the
general and wife. Prince Dati, Minister
Bingham and Minister Yoshidx, slowly
pushed for the shore, and on the instant
every naval yes.-el manned yards and
fired the American National salute.
The day was as beautiful as days
of which we dream â a blue, cloudless
sky, a soothing, lapping sea. The sudden
transformation from this sleepy, lazy
silent summer day into the turbulence
and clangor of war, the roar of cannon,
the music â every band playing an Ameri
can air â the manned yards, the officers
on decK in full dress and saluting, the
barge as it passed, the cheers of
the multitude thronÃing the shore, fan
tastic day nreworks, the cannon smoke
banking into cloudi, the barge moving
with slow, steady stroke â all formed a
brilliant and extraordinary scene.
As the Admiralty steps were approached
there in waiting stood the Imperial
Princes, the Ministers and the high
officials of the realm, in the splendor of
their rank and Btation. As the general
stepped on shore the Japanese guns
thundered their greeting, 'he bands
played 'The Star-spangled Banner,' and
Mr. Iwakuru, the venerable Prime Min
ister, advanced, and takinz the gen
eral's hand, in the name of the
Emperor welcomed him to Japan. Reach
ing Tokio after an hour in the train the
city authorities met us with an address,
and the Mikado's state carriage, through
a continuous, double line of infantry
standing at 'present,' conveyed the gen
eral to the Imperial Palace of Enriok
wan."
Excessive tea-drinking Bhatters the
nervous sysiem, weakens the brain, in
jures the appetite, disturbs the digestive
organs and causes cold feet. So says a
physician.

WILL BE OBEYED
All Litigation Over the Big
Estate Is at an
End.
Oakland Will Soon Have a Large
Hospital for Men and
Women.
Bowdoin to G.t a Big B quest ani
Seventy Legatees to R.ceiva
Gi.'ts.
Oakland Office San Fkaxcisoo Call,!
3 Broadway, May 25. J
The Merritt litigation is ended. A de
cision was handed down by the United
Slates Supreme Court yesterday which
releases ail the complications that for
six years have surrounded the Merritt-
Garc ion estate. The action of tbe Su
pn me Court seta the property free io be
devoted to the uses intended by Dr. Sam
uel Merritt and Mrs. Catherine Garcelon.
The action that has brought this about
was a. dismissal of the appeal of James P.
Merriit and Harry P. Merritt from the
decision of the United States Circuit
Court, and it is acknowledged by Messrs
Rted & Nusbaumer, their attorneys, that
there is absolutely no further chance for
appeal or litigation.
Judge Staniy, the surviving trustee
under the deeds made by Mrs. Garcelon,
is now at liberty to pay off the bequests
made to her relatives and friends, amount
ing to about seventy people, and to con
vey to the trustees for the Samuel Merriit
Hospital and to the trustees of Buwdoin
Coliege the shares to which tney are en
titled. It is generally understood that
the hospital, which will be located in
Oakland, will receive $600,000, and the col
lege $400,000, but these a-niounis may be
increased.
The details of the litigation have been
published *xhausiivelv as they progressed
s; jce the death of Mrs. Garcelon in 1891,
about a year after the deat:i of Dr. Mer
ritt. The two nephews, James and Fred
erick Merritt, threatened a contest of the
will, by which Dr. Merritt left the greater
part of the estate to his sister. Mrs. Gar
celon, and the latter made a compromise
â¢with ttie nephews by which they re
ceived $125,000 in cash and real estnte
worth aboui $500,000. Harry P. Merritt,
a third nephew, came out from Maine and
be^an a contest of the will of Mrs. Garce
lon. Then the Bo^doin Col ege trustees
began suit in the United States Circuit
Court, which took the who.c matter of
the trust out of the hands of the State
court. The will contest in the Alameda
court was thrown out. James and Harry
then violated their agreement and eon
tes:ed the trust. Judge Hawley in the
Federal court ruled that the trust was
ruily legal.
An appeal was taken to the United
States Supreme Court, and in June, 1896.
the final decree in favor ol Bowdoin Col
lege was entered. Six months later James
and Harry Merritt filed their petition on
appeal on the question of jurisdiction.
The Supreme Court yesterday decided
that the lower court acted within its juris
diction, and this ends the litigation.
The trust deed for the establishment
and government of the hospital provided
that the first trustees should be Dr. Agard
and Dr. Pinkerton, both dead, and John
A. Stanlv, who survives. Dr. A. J. Rus
sell and Dr. P. L. Wheeler were appointed
in place of the decedents. The deed pro
vides that the hospital shall be forever
known as tno "Samuel Merritt Hospital,"
and also that the money shall be invested
in such a manner as to guarantee per
petuity of the charity. Two of the trus
tees must always be of the regular or
allopathic fcchool, and the other one may
be a business man, but all must be resi
dents of Oakland.
The hospital ii to be divided into four
wards to accommodate at least foriy pa
tients in all, two for female and two for
male patients, and must be of such archi

CLARRAGE WILL RECOVER
The Elmburst Ccnstab c Not to
Suffer Death for Doing
His Duty.
His Assailant's Wife Hhs Not Visited
Her Hu band and She Fears
His Re ease.
Oakland Office Bas Francisco Call,)
9UB Broadway, May 25. \
The physicians stated yesterday that
Constable Clarrage of Elmhurst is out of
danger and will recover. Although he is
over 60 years of age he is possessed of a
remarkably strong constitution, and has
been enabled to withstand injuries to
which many younger people would suc
cumb.
That lie was not killed instantly is
shown by the nature of his wounds to
have been nothing le?s than a miracle.
The doctors even declare that if the
charge of shot had been of a heavier size
it would have caused death. Now there
is general rejoicing in the little town be
cause Clarrage is a great favorite. The
expressions of indignation and anger
against McMahon, who would have mur
dered him, have te?n turned to feelings
of congratulation for the suffered. Dur
ing the two weeks he has been injured be
has been constantly attended by his many
friends, who out of gratitude for past
kindnesses consider Lt a privilege to min
ister to tbe old man's wants.
Mrs. McMahon, the wife of the man who
did the shooting, has not once visited her
husband in the County Jail. On the even
ing of the tragedy sbe told McMalion that
if he struck ber the door wasopen to him.
It now se-'ms that she has kept her word,
for he aid strike her and kicked her before
Clarrage attemp:ed 10 stop him, and it
was for doing his duty that the old Con
stable was shot.
Mrs. McMahon has expressed a fear to
tier friends that tier husbaud will be rn
leased on bail and that he will renew hi
aarsh treatment of ber. Sbe says that
she is not at all anxious to see him, and
neither has be expressed the least desire
to see liia wife.
McMahon has placed himself in the
hands of Attorney If. C. Chapman and
refuses to say anything about his case.
It is Known, however, that he will plead
self-defense.
His wife has stated that she has no desire
to live with him again and only wants to
be left alone with her child. 1 ere is.
however, tome property involved, and
there will likely be a lighi for it in the
court.

Oilbertson Held Responsible.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 25.â The latest
change in the stree;-railway combine is
the retirement of Assistant Superinten
dent Gilbert Robertson from the Grove
street system, which is controlled by the
Realty Syndicate Company. He relused
to make any s moment in regard to the
removal of Mr. Rudolph or the feeling of
the men as to who was responsible for
the order for the men to sign a temper
ance pledge. He thought that there had
been a misunderstanding as to his po
sition; he bein.' oniy an assistant to the
superintendent, had to obey his superior's
orders.
When questioned he denied that ho was
at all responsible for tho pledge, but
simply obeyed the superintendent when
told to print one, the terms being dic
tated.
Donated to the College.

of ihe Baptist faith and cause on this
coast during her life. Sne is now well
along in life, but attends services regu
larly. Her home is with the Rev. C. H.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 26, 1897.
BASSETT WANTS
COVELLIER'S SEAT
Confession That Involves
the Water Companies
Fight.
Admission That tbe Purity o
Elections Law Was
Vio ated.
During a Heated Argurasnt Much
Was Said That Is N w Greatly
Regretted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
908 Br.jauway, May 25. f
"Old Pard 1 ' Bassett may possibly "get
there." "There" is a seat in the Council
v. h;cti he filled for the past two years and
which he was prevemed from reoccupying
by Councilman Cuvelner.
The cause of Mr. Bassett'sglee is tbe fact
that Mr. Cuvellier is not a politician nor a
diplomatist. In t c heat of the discussion
last night o\e. - alternating tbe hydrants
Mr. Cuveliier was goaded to break his re
-oive which, if be had kept it, would have
saved him a lot of discomfiture.
It was all caused by this neat little
speech: "I did not intend to say a word,"
said Mr. Cuvellier, "but I will admit that
I have been goaded into making an expla
nation. I will confess that I broke one
plank in the Republican platform which
provided that all efficient RepubMcans
should be retained in office. I voted (or
White for wharfinger to succeed Rutuer
fon', but I could not help myself. Before
1 subscribed to tiiat platform I had prom
ised White to vote for him and I was tied
up. I will admit tiiat I was guilty in that
instance, but I do no: intend to break the
platiorm on this qu suon of alternating
hydrants."
"I am very sorry." said Mr. Girard,
"that Mr. Cuvellier is such a poor politi
cian as to admit that he violated the purity
of election law."
"Yes, I did," said Cuvellier, "and 1 am
sorry for it."
There are others, however, who do not
intend to let Mr. Cuvellier's sorrow end
the matter. One of them is "Old Pard"
Basseit
- Ii Cwvellier wishes to Bare himself a
lot of trouble," said Mr. Bassett to-day,
"he will resign, because his seat in my
opinion belongs to me. Every vote he
gives on any question is likely to cause
.roubie, and now that he has confessed to
what the law calls a felony, I consider
him to be disquaitied."
Mr. Cuvelher's position places the hy
drant fight in a very interesting situation.
It was parsed last night by eignt votps. It
has to go to the Mayor, and should he
veto it, eight voies are necessary to pass
it over his veto. Should Mr. I3as-ett suc
ceed in obtaining Mr. Cuvellier's seat, he
will cerrainly vote on the water question
differently from Cuvellier. This would re
duce the vote from eight to seven, which
would not be enough to sustain a possible
veto.
ROBBED A POLICEMAN.
Two Bold Highwaymen Surprise and
Secure the Revolver of a
Mounted Officer.
OAKLAND, Cal., M<y 25.â Policeman
J. B. Boyce was heid up last night shortly
after 9 o'clock, while rUing out Broadway,
and robbed of his revolver. He was
mounted on his horse at the time, riding
leisurely. He noticed two men on the
curb, near where he was riding, and as he
came abreast he was ordered to halt.
A shining Colt's revolver barrel aimed
at his breast caused him to stop. "I've
gotyou covered ; hands up, or you're adead
policeman 1" were the next words, in ciear,
cold tonea.
"None of that !" was the command, with
a dick of a cocKing revolver, as Boyce
made a move for his revolver. Up went
his hands at this.
"Have you any money?" demanded the
leader.
"Not a cent," answered Boycp.
"We didn't expect you had, but we
need a revolver badly. Fred [to his com
panion], take the gentleman's gun."
The officer's gun was taken by the other,
and he was told to get.
"We won't take your star, but you want
to get down the street as fast as your nag
will carry you; and dori't look around,
eithr, if you don't want a dose of your
own lead."
Boyce toot the advice offered and made
for the City Hall, where he reported to
the Chief. A scouting ; party at once
started out, but no trace of the party has
yet been found. ; ";."
Boyce has been on the force since March
2, 1887, and has the name of being one of
the bravest and best officers in the depart
ment. But with no possible . chance to
protect himself or right he was compelled
to surrender. ? The police are -now thor
oughly aroused, and the hold-ups and
robberies will probably cease for the time
being. ;.â ; "â  . "â ". â  : â¢;': ; .;' â  , i

LAUNDRY RESTRICTION S.
Oicar Meynel Will >ot Wnit for the
Passage of the Proposed Pro
hibitive Ordinance.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 25.â Oscar Mey
sei, whose proposition jo erect a Chinese
laundry on Sun Antonio avenue in the
residence portion of the town has aroused
bitter antagonism, says that he will stand
on his rights, and those rights are to put
up such a building aa he chooses on hie
own property.
He claims mat the proposed ordinance
requiring the consent of five property
owners in a blcck before any one can
erect a laundry, stable or cUicken-house
will be illegal and that a similar one in
Chico was knocked out by the Supreme
Court. He says the people might as well
say to him tuat be shall not start a bar
ber-shop unless they give their consent.
But he is not going to wait for the ordi
nance to be enacted.
The Board ot Trustees cannot meet next
Monday, as it is a legal holiday, and
under ihe new meeting ordinance they
cannot get together till next Wednesday.
By that time, Meysel says, his laundry
will be up, even it he has to hire extra
workmen to hmr/ it along. It the people
want a tight, he says, he is ready for them
and will give them a merry war. And it
cer;a:niy looks as though it would be a
merry war.
PETITION FROM PUTZKER.
The Professor Wants to Ride a
Wheel on the Side
walk.
He Asks ths Berkeley Trustees to
Ciange Their Bicycle Ordi- -
. nance. \
.BERKELEY. Cal., May 25.â Professor
Albin Putzker of the department of Ger
man at the university presented to the
Board of Trustees last night a petition
asking that the ordinance prohibiting bi
cyclists from riding on thÂ» sidewalks be
repealed.' Professor Putzker is an en
thusiastic bicyclist, and believes the Jaw
to be unreasonable. In his petition he
says:
"We should like a modification of the
ordinance which prohibits the use of bi
cycles on sidewalks in such a manner as
to allow the use of bicycles on sidewalks.
This is to te done , under proper restric
tion?, such as prevail in other cities. An
ordinance could be drawn which would be
better than any now in force elsewhere.
Riders might be compelled 10 go at a very
j slow rate when meeting pedestrians. Dis
mounting is often dangerous both to the
pedestrian and to the rider. The request
is made for the following reasons: . 1. Our
streets are new and not smooth, ; and
everywhere there jis much | gravel and
other material' injurious to wheels; car
tracks also offer serious obstructions.
2. The main thoroughfares are, most of
the time, so wet from sprinkling that it is
dangerous to ride on â  them, and, more
over, very unpleasant on account or the
mud thrown up by the wheel. 3. It is a
hardship to riders from neighboring cities
to find out at the risk of arrest that the
privilege granted elsewhere is not granted
in Berkeley. Thus excursionists, instead
of being attracted to come here, are re
pelled." - . .
Superintendent of Streets Chick thinks
that bicyclists should be compelled to ride
on the streets when macadamized. He
believes Professor Putzker to be right in
holding that bicyclists should not be ruled
off sidewalks â â : where the streets are \ not
suitable for riding. The board will con
sider the matter at its next meeting.

A WATEE SUIT.
Dr. Robinson's Proceeding Against the
Alameda Water Company.' . : ' -â¢â  -.- :â â >-â '[
ALA MED A, Cat-, â. May; 25.â A . good

in the suit brought by Dr. W. Robinson of
this city against the water company to

! fore Judge Hall yesterday by T. V. Cator

Maxwell and City Attorney Taylor, for de
lendant. It was contended on behalf of
plaintiff that the company could make
no charge against any customer except
the rale fixed by the City Trustee-*, and
i bat any expense for labor or materials in
making house connections must be added
to the investment in the plant. Tue Trus
tees bad fixed no rate for making connec

Juin r Boss in the San Diego water case

On the part of ; the defendant it was con
tended that the water company could not

or enlarge its plant at . all . that whatever
it was v required r. to | expend > annually ; in
maintaining and operating its plant was
a current expense whic* the company is

ARE BUILDING A
CITY OF TENTS
Seventh-Day Adventists to
Open a Camp at Bushrod
Park.
Delegates From Several States
Will Be in Attendance at
the Conference.
Several Denominational Insti'ution;
Will Also Share in the
Encampment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
9OH Broadway, May 25. f
The twenty-S'Xifa annual meeting of the
California Conference of the Seventh-day
Ailventists will be held this year at Bash*
rod Park June 3to 13. Extensive prepara
tions are being made for this annual
camp-nieetine, which the managers of the
convention expect to be one of the largest
ever held in the State.
Work on the camp ground was begun
on the 23d and over 100 tents have already
been pitched. The denominational trans
portation agent has succeeded in securing
reduced rates to the meeting over all roads
coming into Oakland lor those who desire
to attend.
Many of the speakers who will be at this
meeting have been in recent attendance at
a similar though more local meeting in
li.c city cf Fre-n >. It is anticipated that
there will be a large attendance this year
from Nevada, Southern California and the
north.
The last annual camp-meeting of this
denomination was held in A<ameda, and,
although the attendance was large, the
camp-rs do not consider the grounds
nearly as convenient as those at Bushrod
Park, which are particularly beautiful at
this season. The ia!l, symmetrical shade
trees add much to the general appearance
of the camp.
The grounds have been laid out like a
miniature city, with North, Central and
South avenues running from east to west,
and streets Jrom A to H running from
north to south, while every tent is num
bered. Looking down Central avenu â¢an
unobstructed view may be had of the bay,
Angel IsL.nd, Alcatraz, Fort Point, the
Golden Gaio and its sleeping guardian â
Mount Tarnaipais. Northward, in full
view, stand the university buildings, the
blind asylum and the Berkeley hills.
Alreaiiy a plentitul supply of water is
on the grounds, and electricity will ope
rate 100 incandescent lamps by which the
grounds will be lighted at night.

CHAIRMAN GIER RESIGNS
Willing to Do Anything to Help
the Success of Endeavor
Day.
Secretary Baker R undly Scored for
Trying to Create a Dissension
in the Committee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Bioadway, May 25. )
The peculiar argument made by Sec
retary C. F. Baker of the First Baptist
Church against Mr. Gier of the finance
committee of the July celebrations caused
that gentleman to send the following res
ignation to the Merchants' Exchange to
night:
Mr. Webb N. Pierce, Secretary of Fourth of July
Veltbration and Oakland Endeavor Dayâ Dear
Sir: 1 herewith renpecilully hand you my
resignation as chairman and member oi yc>ur
finance committee. lam heartily iv favor of
making both celebrations a grand success.
As my connection with the committee has be
come a matter of public discussion
which might tend to Create mi unpleasant
feeling and perhaps injure the success of
either or both celebrations, I ask you to accept
this my resignation. I have b?en highly
honored b> your joint committee, and shall
consider it my pleasure to quietly assist in the
interest of success. Yours very respectfully-,
Theo. Gier. i
At to-night's meeting of the exchange
it was stated that Mr. Baker was not rep
resenting the Christian Endeavor senti
ment, but was attempting to be
officious. The members of the ex
change said that the sentiment of
the Christian Endeavor was very
practical in this matter; that they re
alized that it was a celebration and recep
tion tendered to the thousands of visiting
delegates by the city of Oakland and that
it ill became one secretary to show such a
small spirit. _ ; .. ..' ', : "
Mr. Gier's resignation will not be pre
sented until the next meeting of the joint
committee, 'when it will be declined and
Mr. Gier will be asked to retain bis chair
manship. * , i ,-'.,".â¢'>'"

OAKLAND, Cal>, May 25.â The new as

street, < between .Broad way and Washing
ton, will not be accepted by SuDeriniend

do is the question. He sent samples of

composition and concludes with this para
graph: \ -i- J , :.; â  " â  .' < :./' _
This material as a whole is an asphaltum

the distillation of crude petroleum. We can
not recommend this as a good material for use
as a street pavement even after being softened
with fluxes. It is far inferior to the natural
bituminous rock found in many places on thin

be held in this City on July 7 Â».o 12, has just
issued its first transportation bulletin, which
contains eight page* of interesting matter. It

valuable data concerning railroad rates east

Committee on Promotion to like A 1
Arrangements for the Saturday
Night Meeting.
At the meeting of the Mission Park and
Zoological Garden Association yesterday
afternoon the following communication
was read by Secretary J. J. McEwen from
Professor D. S. Jordan:
May 24. 1897.
J. J. McEwen, 118 Montgomery atrettâ My Dear
Sik: I B,. ah be giad w speak ou Saturday
evening, the 29m, as requested. Sam Part
ridge offers to present and show tne lantern
scenes of the animals, winch will also be an
advantage. I shall speak exiemporaneously,
and ns wtmt I snail say wiil depend somewhat
on the audience and the features it would be
a litile hard to prepare a statement before
hand of the points. I shall be at the Palace
Hotel. Yours very truly,
David Starr Jordan.
T. V. O'Bri-n stated that in a conversa
tion with Mayor Phelan, that gentleman,
considering his official position as Mayor
of the City, rather inclined to the opinion
that it would n >c be proper for him to pre
side at the meeting on Saturday vening.
This declination was accepted for the rea
sons given, ana the committee decided to
have \V. M. Bunker perfoim that distin
guished duty, in the unavoidable absence
of President Shadburne.
This same gentleman moved that the
time i>ad arrived when it was proper to
present tJie application for an appropria
tion for the park, as also a request for bids
for a suitable site.
This motion was carried, with the pro
viso that Ueorge Center, chairman of the
promotion committee, collect the peti
tions left at the several newspaper offices
only and have them presented to the Su
pervisors on next Monday.
The following is the petition :
To the Honorable Mayor and Board of Super
visors of the city and County of Scm >"> anciscoâ
Gentlemen: The Mission Parit Association of
San Francisco and the undersigned residents
and taxpayers of the City respectfully request
your honorable body to moke a reasouable
appropriation In the uext tax levy for the pur
pose of providing a public part and zoological
garden, nni in the meantime that you invite
prorosah :or and .-elect a suitable site for the
same in the Mission district.
The question of tinance wap discussed
for 'he lovering of the incidental e.XDenses
of the committee. Several members Uived
into their pockets and drew out po!d
pieces for the purpose. But it was deemed
the better way to appoints finance coru
miitee, which was done by namine W. M.
Bunker, T. V. O'Bn.n, Dr. C. G. Kenyon.
Georjje Center tnd William Metzner to
that position.
A. B. Ma uire stated that the meeting
olSjid day evening at Twenty-first and
Howard streets was only the first ol a
series of like character to be held for the
purpose of a.onsiup public enthusiasm in
Invor of a park. Colonel John O'Byrne

opinion ill advised for numerous reasons.

Measure Introduced by Super
visor Haskius.
It ig evident that Supervisor Haskin '
anti-cigarette order will meet with con
siderable opposition when it comes up be
fore the board for considerat on, and the
rirst note was sounded yesterday, when
Supervisor Lacktuan declared at ttie
meeting of the Judiciary Committee that
he was opposed to. it, as savoring too
mu.ch of a blue law.
Supervisor Sheehan wanted to bear
from the advocates of the Â«,rder before
voting on it. Chairman Smith wanted
both >ides represented, so the matter was
laid over for a week.
It is understood that a majority of the

FREE TO EVERY MAN.
THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
FOR fltflimÃ OF Ml
WHICH (HEED HIM AFTKR EVERY-
THING ELSE FAILED,
Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly | wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than thÂ« most severe pain. There
is no let up to the ; mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
â uch a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
I am not a philanthropist, > nor do I pose m
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at ence could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how 1 can
| afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
[ worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
| time of happiness to most of us. Write to
Thomas Slater, box 2283, Kalamaioo, Mich.,
and the information will be mailed in a plain
sealed envelope. : â .â ;. -â

FREE MARKET OR
NO FREE MARKET?
Harbor Commissioners and
Farmers Will Hold a
Conference.
Two Hundred Representative
Grangers Have B?en Re
quested to Attend.
Tut of the Law Passed b/ the Last
Legislature Directing th-* Board
to Establish the Market
To-morrow the State Harbor Commis
sioners will confer with farmers and
fruit-growers on tbe subject of establish
ing a free market on the water front in
accordance with an act passed by the last
Legislature. A preliminary conference
was held last Wednesday, but the inter
ested producers had not been advised of
the meeting ; hence another meeting was
appointed.
Following is a copy of a communication
recently sent to 200 representative
farmers:
The matter of establishing a free market on
ihe water front in Ban Francisco was taken up
by the Board of State Harbor Commissioners
May 18 and tnesubj.'Ct laid over until Thurs
day. MiÂ»y 27, at 2 p.m., at the rooms of the
board, 10 Market street.
It is desirable to have representative farm
ers present at that meeting to express their
view: as to the be^t plans for carrying out the
law as passed by the lnst Legislature lor estab
lishing and maintaining a free market.
It seems necessary that producers should
take mii interest in this matter at once, and It
is hoped that you will be present, that some
initiative movement at least will be inaugu
rated before it is too late lo secure the benefit
contemplated iv the late act of the Legislature.
In response to the request of many
farmers tbe text of the law as follows is
again published:
An act to authorize the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners to establish and maintain
a free public market upon the water front

The High Schools of Santa Rosa, Clo

Al Lean, the trainer who so very suc
cessfully handled the athletes of the Uni
versity of California, has been engaged
to put the ti^ishine touches on the team
that will represent Ukiah in the great
struggle for athletic supremacy. Lean
writes to The Call from Ukiah that his
men are in tolerably good condition, but
that he found some of the boys over
trained when he arrived at Ukiah, and
that they are now taking a much-needed
rest.
.Certainly, if Lean had the proper time
to handle and coach the colts he would
have every athlete in the pink of condi
tion when they will enter the contests on
Saturday. He expects, however, to tee
Ukiab well in the lead at the finish of the
day's games. The following are the ath
letes who will represent the Ukiah High
School in the different athletic events: - .>. -.
100 yardsâ W. Estus and F. Estns; 220
yardsâ W. Estus and Holman ; 440 yards â
Finnic and Hoi man; 880 yardsâ Rogers
and Jr'innie; one mileâ Rogers and Finnic;
high jumpâ F. Estus and ;B. Thomas;
broad jumpâ Henley and Finlev; - 16
--pound shotâ W. Estu\ Lenz and Finley;

HONOR FOR
REV . FATHER
J.F.NUGENT
Pope Leo Grants St. Bren
dan's the Apostolic
Benediction.
RARELY GIVEN ON SUCH
OCCASIONS,
Procured by Firm Friends in
Rome for the Priest's Sil
ver Jubilee.
_________
NEARLY SIXTY PRIESTS AT THE
BAKQOET.
Several Beautiful Presents Received
by the Pastor â Two Large
Entertainments
From the Vatican palace at Rome comes
a message that marks an epoch in the life
history of Father J. F. Nugent, the popu
lar pastor of St. Brendan's parish â a mes-
Fat.c that carries peace and serenity and
joy to the parishioners in general and
tlieir pastor.
It is the apostolic benediction, delivered
by his Holiness Pope Leo XIII, extending
a blessing to Fattier Nugent, each mem
ber of li:s congregation and all who were
present at the solemn high mass, at the
conclusion of which it was read. The oc
casion which drew it forth was Father
Nugent's silver jubilee, celebrating the
. wenty-tifth anniversary of his ordination
to the priesthood.
Moreover, it is noteworthy from the fact
that never before in San Francisco has the
apostolic benediction been granted on the
occasion of a jubilee. It is one of the very
few occasion* that it has been granted to
be read in public, such having taken place
once besore in this City, but on a different
occasion.
Fatuer Xugent's studies were pursued
at ihe Amencaa College in Rome, where
he bus many powerful friends on account
of bis pleasing personality, and it was by
one of these mat the prayer for the bene
diction was made. This friend has not
seen tit to disclose his identity, but who
ever he be, he has kept a pretty sharp eye
on the friend of his student days, as the
presence of the benediction testifies.
Nor is (His the only occasion on which
Si. Brendan's and its pastor h:'S been
honored L>y the Pontiff. On August 27,
1887, he biessed a picture of Our LaUy o;
IV i petual Heip, and granted several in
dulgences to tnose who visited the church
on special occasions.
Father Nugent was ordained in the
church of St. John Lateran at Korne, May
U5, 1872, came to St. Brendan's in 1879, and
iyis been an earnest and aggressive worker
ttiere ever since.
About sixty priests were in the sanctu
ary to do mm honor yesterday, and the
churc.i was filled to overflowing with par
ishioners and visitors. The sacred struct
ure itself was ay the bride waiting for the
coming of the bridegroom, being profusely
and artistically decorated with St. Joseph
lilies and other exquisitely colored flowers.
At 10 a. m. solemn high mass was cele
brated, Haydn's mass in C being sung
with orchestral accompaniment. Rev.
J>nn F. Nugent officiated as celebrant,
Rev. Hus-ii McNamee of Santa Cruz as
deacon, Rev. M. Riordan as sub-deacon,
Rev. J. P. McCieary as master of ceremo
n.es, and as deacons of honor to hi* Grace
Arcnbi hop Riordan were Rev. M. King
and Rev. P. Stanlon.
The Archbishop delivered an eloquent
address, highly complimentary to Father
Nugent and his record in parochial work.
He hoped to be present on the day when
tin. worthy pastor would celebrate his
toiden jubilee.
A prominent feature of the ceremonies
was the attendance of the little childien
i-om the various scnools in the parish.
Tiieir bright faces fairly filled the galleries.
Under the care of the Sisters tney took
part in ihe ceremonies ot the day.
The music for the mass was arranged
by Miss Georgiana. The performers were
as foiiows:
P >ioistsâ Mrs. Clara McGowan Nunan, Mme.
Si ffdiii, Mifla Agnes Bui gen, James Lane and
b. J. bandy, Â»s>isied by the following:
Sopranosâ Mrs. .Steinmau, Miss Lillie Panbn.
Uu- Minnie Byrne, Miss Mary Hipping Miss
Maggie Ryan, Miss laa Hayes, Miss Katie
Hughes, Miss Ella. Walthour.
Contrniios â Mrs. Sutton, Miss Helen Ford,
M taa Wishinan.
Tenorsâ Dr. Bonino. J. Elliott, Henry Dinen.
Bassosâ br. Rottuuzi, Luke A.Flynn, P. .Don
ovan, P. Sheerin, William O'Brien.
Organistâ Miss Maggie Lennon.
At high noon there was a banquet in the
spacioue dinmg-hall ot Si. Brendan's
; school. In a congratulatory speech Arch
bi-bop Riordan slated that the highest
testimonial of a priest's worth is to be
found in the est em in which he is held
by his congregation. The large number
of brother priests uresent he also pointed
out as a siron^' testimonial.
In reply Father Nugent said that tne
aim of his Hie had been for the advance
ment of the GoÂ«q ci, and the knowledge
that he nucceedet in such measure and
that his parish had so prospered brought
in i ffable coi^ent. In conclusion, he
thanked all for their many testimonials
of appreciation.
A telegram was read from Bishop Mont
gomery, at Los Angeles, s ating that both
he and Fatner Peter C. Yorke regretted
their inability to be present on the glad
occasion, bin wishing St. Brendan's Bnd
its pastor well, and expressing the hope
(hat both would be present at his golden
jubilee.
Those present at the banquet were:
Archbishop Riordan, Very Rev. Father Pren

His brotaer priests made Father Nugent
a present oi a beautiful silver cualice set
in four gold medallions with a cross
studded with amethysts, hyacinths and
topazes. It was presented by Father
Cummins in an appropriate speech and
was used by Fatner JSugent yesterday in
the celebration of mas;.
Last Monday evening, the eve of his
silver jubilee, the ladies of ti.e parish pre
sented him with pyxes and a generous
stock of holy oils useu in church rites.

NO Wai CHEDULE.
Five Supervisor* Were Absent Last
Evening and There Wan No
Sleeting.
There was no prize-fight last night; yet,
strange to say, she Water Committee of
the Supervisors did not meet to fix the
schedule of water rates for the coming
fiscal year. The meeting of the committee
of the whole had been set for half-past 7
o'clock, and when 8 o'clock was reached
Mayor Fhelan, Drs. Rottanzi, Clinton and
Dodge and Messrs. Britt and Sheehan
were absent.
Seven faithful ones placed Mr. Smith in
the chair, an l after the roll had been
called an adjournment was ordered until
next Tuesday afternoon at half-past 2
o'clock.
Twenty-five minutes after the adjourn
ment the three doctors and Mr. Brut ap
peared at the rooms of the board and
found the lights out and the place in
darkness. Tney were indignant. Dr.
Dodge said that the member* had never
come to an evening meeting until 8:30,
and he was at a loss to know why the
seven members of the board were in such
a hurry to adjourn.

KERRIGAN'S
ANSWER TO
POTTER
A Scorching Retort to the
President of the
League.
CALIFORNIA DECLARED

Wheelmen Warned Not to Rely
Too Much on the Eastern
Man's Word.
POWER OF THE ASSOCIATED
CYCLISTS.
The Ex-Chief Consul Charges That
Potter Broke F.iith at the Last
National Assembly. ,
The charge* recently made by President
Potter of the League of American Wheel
men against tne recently resigned officers
of the North California Division of tne
league have brought forth a c tustic and
pointed reply from Frank H. Kerrigan,
ex-chief consul of the division, wtio re
signed to affiliate with the California As
sociated Cyclists.
T c reply is in the form of an address
to California wheelmen and is aimed to
correct any misapprehensions that might
arise from Potter's statements. Mr. Ker
rigan's manifesto is somewhat torrid in
its tone, but as it has been approved by
the chief advisers of the Associated Cyclists
it 14 undouDtedly a trae expression o; the
feelings of those who have withdrawn
from tn c league. The address is as fol
lows:
To Che Wheelmen of California: The ravings
of I'aresis I'otier have again desecrated the
columns of the L. A. W. Bulletin, and though
under other circumstances they would not
merit a repiy, in this case it is fitting they
should be answertd.
What a senseless effusion it is! How lacking
in dienity, manliness, honor and all that goes
to make up a broad-gauge roan of affairs such
as the head of any American National organi
zation should be! The document is signed by
Potter, and, since it reeks with misrepresenta
tions ad falsehood, it is doubtless of his own
construction.
The inference in the letter is that the mem
bers of the C. A. C. C. conspired together to
get the California division roadbooks and that
our esteemed Sheriff was a willing party to the ;
scheme and that the new organisation secured
the books. This is absurd and absolutely un
true.
When Potter talks about rascality, as he
does in hit letter, he probably does so as an
expert on the subject He knows too much
rascality for one manâ he ought to be incor
porated.
The head of the venerable old organization
concludes nis letter with one of his chief char
acteristicsâthat of pap giving. He says: "All
the members of the division for tlie year 1897
will have good reason to remember that fact."
That is but a bait. Why doesn't he come out
fairly and say precisely what ne is going to do
for them? He has already madÂ© Other and
more definite promises of this kind. What
are they worth? For instance, Potter, In his
wild search for a chief consul in this State,
offered the National League of American
Wheelmen meet of 1898 to California. The
laws of the League of American Wheelmen
don't vest in the president or any other man
the power of disposing of that white elephant.
It is disposed of by mail vote of the delegates
to the National assembly. Again, suspended
professional riders have b en promised by
Potter's representative here reinstatement if
they would abandon the colors of the local
organization and return to the fold of the
League of American Wheelmen. Potter
lias overreached himself, as he must
know he hRs no such power. He also
promised in writing to support the New "iork
delegation, which was clay in Potter's hands,
to the local option amendment, In which Cali
fornia was so vitally interested, at the lust Na
tional assembly. On the strength of that
promise he was elected president of the L. A.
W. , but the agreed support to the local option
amendment never materialized. Who takes
Potter at his word as an eel by the tail finds he
holds nothing. From the.Â«-e instances the
wheelmen of California can judge the worth
of Potter's word.
On the other hand, they may be assured of
the permanent y and bona tides of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs, of its ability to
look after their interests as wheelmen, and
they should identify themselves with it at
once. It is an organization that stands for
State pride, State energy and the advancement
of wheeling interests within our confines.
There never has been any reason, since the
formation and success of the C. A. C. C, some
five years ago, why the organization should
not have broadened its scope of usefulness and
afforded the wheelmen of California the bene
fits and protection of which this division was
guardian, except the solitary one of the
league's control of bicycle track racing. When,
after successive attempts, it became obvious
that the National assembly of the L. A. W., in
legislating for the pÃstime, was wholly out of
sympathy with it and would not take into
consideration the condition of a flairs in Cali
fornia and other divisions and make laws, to
some extent at any rnte, accordingly, the only
reason why Calif, rniashould remain an inte
gral part of the league disappeared and the C.
A. C. C. stepped into the breach and grafted
upon itseli the functions theretofore of the
division. Why should it not? All that had
ever been accomplished for the cyclists of Cali
fornia had been done wholly as tne result ot
our own energy and efforts, without any as
sistance from the National body, lhe divi
sion got out a roadbook each year since
1891 (except one year) at its own ex
pense of not less each time than $750,
its own handbook, secured reduced hoie
rates, provided a division attorney, paid sai
ary of its secretary-treasurer, its immense sta
tionery bills, the expenses of the members ot
its board of officers to meetings of the board,
and of its committees at Sacramento during
sessions of the Legislature, of its delegates
East to the convention and, aÂ« 1 have said, all
as the rÂ« suit of our own exertions and entirely
without the assistance o. iht> parent body.
Why, under the circumstances, can't affairs
whet l me in the State of California be guarded
as well by the Braie organization as by the
foreign one? Nay, why no;, better, since all
the money received from members is kept and
spent here, instead of se-'ding a dispropor
tionate part thereof East (65 cents out of eÂ»ch
dollar on the renewals), and particularly since
the entire stream of the energy of the workets
is poured into one organization and not diss Â»
pa ted as heretofore?

It Was the Worst Adulteration He
Ever Sawâ Dcck?ry Will Make
Arrests To-Day.
The necessity for the rigorous enforce
ment of the pure-food law was illustrated
last night by the poisoning of a family
consisting of a mother and two children
after eating part of the contents of a can
labeled raspberry jelly.
If the mixture, which was a cheap imi
tation of raspberry jelly, had been less
nauseous to the taste, the three innocent
persons who partook of it would have
died within the hour, but the stuff was so
vile that the mother and children could
eat but little of it, and to this fact is due
their escape.
Mrs. Desmond, a poor woman residing
at 135 c Temaha street, sent one- of her
children to the cash grocery of M. de Witt
& Co., at 521 Third street, for a can of
raspberry jelly. The child received a can
of the Columbus brand of raspberry jelly,
put up Dy Fontana & Co. or this City.
The mother spread the "jelly 1 ' thinly on
slices of bread, and sue and tier baby and
two of the older children ate of it.
They were immediately taken with vio
lent cramps aud vomiting. The mother,
who was in a delicate condition, fainted
away, and Dr. Alexander S. Tuchler, the
family physician, 1133 Polk street, was
hurriedly sent for.
When he arrived he found them
suffering with all the symptoms of poison,
but alter administering the proper anti
dotes the patients were soon brought out
of danger, although they remained very
sore from the effects oi the cramps and
the retching.
The matter was reported to the grocers,
and A. de Witt, a member of the firm,
made a statement to the effect that he
sold the can to the Desmond girl; that it
was labeled Columbus brand raspberry
jelly, and that the firm bought it from
Fontana & Co.
He ndded that when his brother was
buying the goods he asked a member of
t'.e tirm or the employe of the firm of
FoDtana & Co. whether the raspberry
jelly was "all right, " and the man replied
that it was. This was the first can that
tho speaker had sold personally, and he
had not heard any complaint except the
present one. After learning what had
happened at the Desmond residence be
cave orders to his clerks to put the re
mainder of the goods away, not to sell an
other can under any consideration and to
return the lot to Fontana & Co. in the
morning.
Dr. A. 8. Tuchler was interviewed also.
He said that the contents cf the can were
the vilest imitation and adulteration of
raspberry jelly ho ever saw. When the
family tasted it their mouths pucKttfed
up as though it were alum. He added
that it was owing to this fact that the
Desmondsdid not eat more and that they
were not fatally poisoned.
M. J. Fonlana, a member of the firm
which sold the goods to M. de Witt & Co.,
replied, when asked to make a statement,
that there was no statement to be made;
i lj nt there waa no such thing as poisoning
in the case. Mr. Fontana was asked
whether the jelly was made of raspberries
or whether it was an imitation. He re
plied that he "supposed" that it was
raspberry jelly.
He added that all hermetically sealed
goods, no matter of what kind, should be
at once emptied out of the vessel contain
ing them, and should be eaten and not
put away.
Chief Food Inspector Dockery an
nounced last n ght that this morning he
would arrest the parties who sold the vile
compound.
