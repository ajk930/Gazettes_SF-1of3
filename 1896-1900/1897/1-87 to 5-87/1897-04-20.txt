lUPKS SUCCEED IN CAPIURING
MILOUNA PASS.
This Is Considered the Key of La
rlssa, and Many Greek Positions
Are in Danger,
[CopyrigHted by the New York Sun.]
LONDON, Etta., April 19.â Although
scarcely more ihan forty-eight hours hare
elapsed since the declaration of war a cri
sis seems to be close at hand in the fast
and furious campaign between the Greek
and Turkish armies.
The bewildering succession of events
along the whole line of the frontier dem
onstrates first of all that war hereafter
will be a matter of days instead of months.
The situation at present, roughly speak
ing, is this:
On the west coast and frontier of Epirus
the Greeks are carrying everything before |
them ami making a victorious invasion of i
the enemy's country. The Turks on the
other hand have captured Milouna Pass,
which is considered the key of Larissa,
and the Greek position there and other
points in Thessaly are in the gravest dan- i
ger. It is impossible to deny that Turk
ish successes of yesterday and to-dey in
volve great peril to the Greek cause. The
loss of Larissa means an open road to j
Volo, Â«Tentnalfy to Athens, and unless I
the Turkish advance is speedily checked
the Greeks will have little to hope for. It [
is already argued in London that Greece
must retrieve to-day's disaster by some
Buch desperate venture as attempting j
to force the Dardanelles. All accounts !
agree that the Turks are fighting every- !
â where like demons, and the Greeks, al- 1
though outnumbered at most points, are '
behaving with no less valor and fury.
It is important before describing the
military events of the day to indicate the
bearine of the situation toward the '
mighty eventuality â universal war â I
which Salisbury and Balfour have been i
telline the world for months would surely 'â 
come if what we are now witnessing
should happen. Not one of these men or
any of their followers now pretend that |
this alarm was justified, or that the war i
will probably spread beyond the two i
countries involved.
The point principally debated by Eu
rope to-day is, Hcs war been permitted to
break out by the connivance of one or
more power-, or has ii come despite the
best efforts of concert by Europe to
preserve the peace? The best judgment
still is that Emperor William is chiefly
responsible for the Sultan's declaration of
war, after he had become convinced that
the powers were unwilling to act or to
continue to aci as full allies against
Greece. It is geuerally expected that all
the powers will tate a position of genuine
neutrality in a few days.
The London Gazette to-morrow will an
nounce the usual neutral attitude of Great
Britain.
In regard to Crete itself the situation is
peculiar, and there is no indication what
the powers will do. It is an undoubted
fact that the greatest peril to European
peace would lie in Greek success in the
present conflict. It is admitted in the
opinions telegraphed to London to-night,
even from Vienna and herlin, that the
failure of the Turks in the war with
Greece would mean the immediate doom
of the Ottoman Empire. That alone is
recognized as the probable cause of a gen
eral war. It is likewise admitted that
Europe will not allow the defeat of Greece
to result in any territorial penalties.
It is unnecessary to explain further why
SECRETARY SHERMAN'S POLICY IS "HANDS OFF."
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.â Officials of the administration are more concerned over the
war than they were yesterday. They are worried over the idea the United States Government may
be brought into trouble through the request for the exercise of its friendly offices. Secretary Sherman
wants to pursue a policy of "hands off," and if Minister Terriil can get some other foreign Minister at
Constantinople to see that the Greeks in Turkey are protected during the fifteen days given them to
get back to Greece he will please his own Government mightily.
This afternoon Secretary Sherman went over to the White House and had a talk with the President,
presumably on this point. When he returned he said he had nothing to say about friendly offices or a
neutrality proclamation. The State Department officials hope the question of right of asylum will not
come up during the continuance of hostilities, as far as this Government is concerned. They are afraid,
however, there will arise great barbarities, bringing the question to the fore. The department issued
a statement to-day explaining the contents of Terrill's first dispatch, in which there is nothing new.
The second dispatch is still undeciphered.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
tho "peace-a!-any-price" people of Europe
are praying for the success of the Turks.
A final test of practical value to the con
cert of Europe will probabiy come in a
few days. It is trying to localize the
struggle. The chief question is whether
they will be able to bring its ponderous
power to bear in time to prevent the
struggle going too far. Those who be
lieve the present action was aue to a dead
lock of the powers take a gloomy view.
Those who are confident the present
blood-letting was tacitly agreed upon as a
necessary outiet to the pent-up passions
of the East apprehend no disaster for Eu
rope at large. It is impossible to indicate
which judgment is the soundest.
MILOUNA PASS LOST.
But the Greeks Maintain Other
Positions and Kill a Vast
Number of Turks.
LONDON, Esq., April 19.â An official
dispatch was received at the Foreign
Office this afternoon saying the Turkish
troops have carried Milouna Pass and are
now on the direct road to Larissa, head
quarters of the Greek army. A dispatch
from Elassona dated midnight last night
says the Turks have captured Milouna
Pass and carried two Greek blockhouses
at the point of the bayonet.
Fighting was hot throughout, every foot
of the Turkish advance being desperately
contested. A number of telegrams were
received at the Foreign Office in the
course of the afternoon, most of which
show that fighting is still in progress and
that the Greeks are being beaten ait along
the line. These dispatches doubtless refer
to the frontier of Thessaly as the scÂ«ne of
conflict. All the foreign Embassadors
called at the Foreign Office to-day.
A dispatch to the Morning Post from
Elassona filed at 10 o'clock to-nieht gives
a description of the prolonged struggle in
Milouna Pass and adds, "I think the
Turks will be in Larissa to-morrow.''
ATHENS, Greece, April 19.â Advices
from Larissa say that after the capture of
Milouna Pass the Greeks fell back
precipitately, but re-formed and were
largely re-enforced. A late dispatch says
the Turks were finally repulsed at Re
veni.
Crown Prince Constantine, commander
in-chief of the Greek forces, has left the
headquarters at Larissa and gone to Tur
navo, whence he will go to Reveni. The
Greek brigade, which is advancing upon
Dumasi. is already in Turkish territory
and only an hour and a half's march
from the city.
General Mavromichalis' division is ad
vancing for the purpose of cutting off the
Turks, who are reported retreating in dis
order. Fighting has progressed at Bong
ban 6 nee yesterday morning. The
Greeks captured two Turkish posts, but
they were afterward retaken by the Turks.
The Greek battery stationed on Turkish
ground began bombarding Vigla, a Turk
ish stronghold. TbÂ« Turks replied with
heavy cannonading and continue to hold
their ground, despite the loss of a large

number. The Greeks are being re-en
forced and likely will capture the town.
Edhem Pasha's plan was to capture
Reveni and then enter tbe plain of
Larissa, cutting off the retreat of the
Greeks with cavalry, thus capturing the
city of Larissa without opposition. The
Greets, after repulsing the at'acfe, pur
sued iho Turks as far as DuroasL.
It is reported that 7000 Turks were killed
or wounded.
LARISSA, Greece, April 19.â This after
noon the Greek troops hitherto held in
reserve were ordered to the front to
strengthen the regiments which fell back
after the reverses at Kourtsiovali and
Milouna Pass. The greater part of the
Mastrapa brigade has gone to Mati to
assist in holding the pass there. The re
mainder, in conjunction with the Dimo
poulo brigade, is sustaining the attack
between Bonghari and Turnavo.
The Greeks still hold their positions at
Nezeros and Reveni Pass. The Greek
force at the latter plnce numbers 14,000.
LATEST FROM THE FRONT.
Dispatches From the Turkish Side
Say Edhem Pasha Holds
MMouna Pass.
LONDON', Exo., April 20.â N0 news has
been received in London from any source
in the vicinity of the critical position in
Milouna Pas;, of later date than 9 o'clock
last night.
Dispatches from the Turkish side at
that hour credited Edhem Pasha with
possession of the paÂ»s and all command
ine points. Dispatches from Athens,
dated Monday afternoon, assert the
Greeks have recaptured two or three
positions, but no details are given.
Latest dispatches from both sides agreed
that a decisive battle would be fought
Monday, but up to 5 o'clock this (Tues
day) morning not a word concerning any
engagement of the kind has been re
ceived.
GREECE MAKES PROTEST.
Neutrality Violated by a Contlnu-
ance of the Blockade of the
Cretan Ports.
ATHENS, Greece. April 19.â Skouzes,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, has made an
official reply to the Turkish note in which
he rebuts the charge that Greece is re
sponsible for the war. He declares ihat
during the last few days preceding the
declaration the Turkish army repeatedly
committed aggressive acts.
The Government has sent a note to the
powers protesting that inasmuch as Greece
and Turkey are at war the continuance of
the blockade of Crete is a violation of
neutrality.
LONDON, Ex.;., April 19.â The opinion
is expressed by the authorities at the
Foreign Office that in view of the fact that
war has been declared it will be necessary
to remove the blockade of Crete. The
liaUau , â â ', irÂ» Cretan waters has been
ordered to proceed to Salonica.
The Times, diecussing editorially the
Greek invitation to tbe powers to with
draw their forces from Crete, says il
Greece meditates the recall of Colonel
Yasso?, commander of the Greek army of
occupation in Crete, so lie may co-operate
in the defense of his country, the powers
might strain a point and let him out, but
the Greek Government should say so.
Until she does the powers are not likely
to modify their action in Crate.
CHEFIK IS CONFIDENT.
The Consul-Ceneral Says It Is
Only a Question of a Short Time
Whpn Turkey Will Win.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 19.-Chefik
Bey, the Turkish Consul-Genera!, smoked
innumerable cigarettes and shrugged his
shoulders as he talked about the war to
day. When asked about the result, he
blew a rine of smoke in the air, saying:
"It is nothing â mere child's play. Lit
tle Greece, two, three millionsâ Turkey,
thirty-five millions. It may be two days,
two weeks, two months. We will win.
The Turks are great fighters. The Koran
tells us that, those who die in battle go
straight to paradise. They fight hard.
You Dave here but one California; Turkey
nas a dozen. We get grain from Asia
Minor and export it to England, France
and Italy. We want no American grain."
"What effect will the war have upon
the Greek residents in Turkey? May not
the exciten.ent lead to massacres?'"
"So long as they are quiet the people of
the Hellenes will be let alone, but if they
atir up trouble we will kill them like the
Armenians. We let them alone and allow
them their religion and they plot; they
go for our homes and we kill, we kill."
The Greek Consul-General said:
"I regard the capture of Preveza as
raoet important. We will hold the key to
Epirus. From Preveza and Arta is a good
highway leading to Janina, the
capital of Epirus, and the advance upon
that town wi<l bring about a general up
rising of the inhabitants, who are Greeks,
and may end in outflanking the Turkish
troops."
WHEAT PRICES RISE.
War News Gives a Blcr Scare to the
Bears In the Pit of the New
York Exchange.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 19â War
news KÂ»ve a biÂ« scare to-day to the boars
in the wheat pit of the Produce Exchange.
They knew they would have to climb to
cover short contracts. At 10:29 the wheat
pit was jammed, but still one minute later
the air was rent with the yells of buyers
and the floor was a football match. The
hands of the big dial which recorded the
openinjr fluctuations in May futures spun
round from ~~}4 cents, where they rested
Saturday, and aid not stop until they in
dicated 83;^ cents. Tne3' stayed there
only a second; then they traveled back
and forth a half cent every half minute.
The !od price was 83% cents, recorded at
10:40. It represented a net advance ol (5%
cents over the close of Saturday. For
eigners whose markets were closed sent
orders for execution, but many of these
orders were to sell. This, with the dis
position among the local bulls to take
prohts, resulted in a reaction, and from
83% cents there was a tumble in lets than
live minutes to 82 cents. The tendency to
sell gradually became general. Before
noon sales were made ai 80% cents. In
the final dealings prices .â¢â¢Â»!;. m steadied,
with the close- for May at 81^ cents. In
the day's business in wheat futures2l,29o,

LOCAL WAR AT OMAHA.
Serlout Riot Follows the Reading
of Bulletins of the Latest
War News.
OMAHA, Neb, April 19.â A riot broke
out in the Greek quarter oi Omaha this
afternoon, and when the patrol wagons
crowded with police arrived on the scene
a number of Greeks, Turks, Syrians and
Arabians were suffering from Knife
thrusts and clubs, while the narrow
streets of the miserable little place in
which these nationalities are huadled to
gether was a withering mass of screaming,
fighting humanity. Those wounded are
Joseph t>aoa, Ollie Abbott, Hubbub Ye
kem, Assad Meyour and Gena Nassar.
Seven arrests were made. The police
soon had the district quiet.
The trouble grew out of the excitement
incipient to the receipt of the afternoon
papers containing war news from the Ori
ent. The women and children on both
sides indulged in the right. The wounded
are not dangerously hurt, except t>aba,
who is badly stabbed. He was delegated
to read the war news to the riotous crowd
which had assembled for that purpose,
when some enthusiastic Turk took of
fense, which precipitated the general bat
tle. The feeling over the war between
Turkey ana Greece is intense among the
colonists of these countries in Omaha and
many are taking advantage of the dis
turbed condition to wreak vengeance for
personal quarrels.
To Witness the Warfare.
WASHINGTON, I>. C, April 19.âSec
retary Alger received a request to-day
from Captain George F. Scriven. military
attache of the United States embassy at
Home, for permission to join the Turkish
army and witness the maneuvers. The
request will probably be granted. It is
abo likely Captain Joseph H. Dorst, mili
tary attache of the legation at Vienna,
will be directed to join the Greek army.

GREEKS GAIN VICTORIES ON THE WEST COAST.
ATHENS, GREECE, April 19.â Terrible havoc was caused by the Greek guns in the bombard
ment of the city of Prevesa, on the north of the Gulf of Arta, yesterday. Fully three-quarters of
the city is in ruins. The fleet resumed the bombardment at daybreak to-day, but the land force has
not yet made an attack upon the city. The firing was resumed at daylight this morning at various
points along the frontier with varying results.
Official information was received this forenoon that Colonel Manos, with 25,000 men, has crossed
the river Arachthus and is marching into Epirus. The Turkish advance posts within his line were
captured. Several thousand insurgents crossed the frontier into Epirus and are seeking to incite the
discontented inhabitants to rebellion.
Just east of Janina the frontier line, descending the southern slope of Mount Peristeri, strikes
the head of the Arta or Arachthus River and follows it down to the Gulf of Arta, cutting off a good
part of old Epirus to the Greeks.
Syrako, where Colonel Manos crossed with his troops, is on the Turkish side of
the river, between fifteen and twenty miles by the road from Janina, and on the road via Ghardiki
to Trikkala. From Syrako roads lead north and south along the river and west to the main road be
tween Janina and Prevesa, which it strikes about four miles north of the fortress of Philipadhia, in
the Xero-Vuni Mountains. This position practically controls this whole section, with the roads lead
ing from Janina to Arta, Prevesa, Parga and other points on the coast to the south.

Did Great Britain Acquiesce?
LONDON, Eng., April 1!).--There are
several indications that the course of
events in the East was fully expected, if
not acquiesced in, by the British Govern
ment. Salisbury had a long interview
with the Queen at Cimez yesterday, but
has not hastened to return to London.
There is no unusual activity at the War
Office or Admiralty to-day. Reports from
Paris, Berlin, Vienna and Roiueshow that
affairs of state in each capital are undis
turbed by the breaking out of the war.
Greeks Ordered to Leave Crete.
CANEA, Crete. April 19. â Placards
bearing tne s-ignalure of the Governor of
Crete have been issued, notilying the
Greeks to leave the island in fifteen days,
in accordance with the orders of the Porte.
This is regarded as annulling the scheme
of the powers for the establishment of an
autonomous government.
AN EXPEDITION ANNIHILATED.

PART?, France, April 19.â A dispatch
to the Temps states that an Italian expe

Abyssinian general commanding at Baro
requested Major Botteeo to halt until the
expedition be authorized by the Negus to
proceed. The Italians fired on messengers
bearing a flag of truce and killed them.
In the light which ensued only two of the
Italians escaped.

sardine-box in â¢ which was inclosed this
message:

FEAST OF DELIGHTS FOR ALL

To-Nlght the Civil Authorities Will
Surrender to Her Gracious
Majesty.
LOS ANGELES, Gal., April 19.â Like a
svarm of droning locusts the sob and
shriek of the fiesta whistle rises upon the
stricken night air from every street and
byway, appalling the transient and giving
cneerf ul token to the native that his great
annual festival has begun. There is no
other thing in the world so sad and so
terrifying by turns as the fiesta whistle,
to v,-hicn it has been given to yearly herald
this season of most unbounded joyousness.
To-day and to-night are preliminary.
The streets are already alive with
strangers, the hotel clerk has already
taken on that distressed look that indi
cates congestion and is the harbinger of
the small cot in the hallways %nd the
pwflors.
There is no doubt at all that the fiesta of
'i>7 will rise distinctly above its predecess
ors as an event in every way â a successful
event. The programme prepared, the
i elaborate details of every feature of it, the
| splendor of the spectacle, the imposing
i arrangements for viewing it and the dre-e
i and decoration of the city were all put
1 forth on a scale of magninoeuce to which
| the attempts of former years have been
i but stepping-stones leading or showing
j the way. The tribunes that formerly were
! temporary structures desieued to be torn
away immediately upon the close of the
gay queen's short reign have been ar
| ranged and constructed as fixtures, to be
i lha scene of her gellant display year after
! year. And the place and arraugements
! verve the purpose nobly. They are built
lat a !ar<.-e open space at Grand Avenue
I and Twelfth street, neither too far away
i from nor too close to the center of the
city. They are made to accommodate
15,000 people within the view of tbe queen
I and her retinue.
The arrangement is that of an oval,
open at the Twelfth-street end. At the
further end is the throne, and sweeping
round on the right and on tho left from
that elevated and favored position, under
Queen Francesca's eye, may be gnthered
the multitude. The opening at Twelfth
street is just wide enongh to admit of the
entrance and exit of the ereat parade. The
plan is that it thftU enter, make the com
plete circuit of the great oval and then
make its exit nt the same point and wind
away back to the city in another direc
tion. By tnis plan a noble spectacle may
be presented before the eye? of the Queen,
her retinue and all those enjoying seata
in the tribunes, for not less than half a,
mile of the procession will he immediately
within the inclosure. The prancing cabal
leros will thus not merely pass before the
Queen in the brief interval of half a block,
as under the previous arrangement, but
they may be watched as they make their
long approach toward the throne, and
then, swinging past it in the shorter
curve of the oval, retire down the equally
long stretch of the other side. So with
all the splendor and horror of the Chinese
pageant with its 500-foot dragon.
Heavy rollers were being run over the
wide amphitheater within the tribunes
to-day, making a level track for the
marchers. The finishing touches were
being put to the throne. There is plenty
of time to get it all into perfect order, as
the show does not concentrate there until
Wednesday afternoon.
To-niijlit the committee on decorations
has benun its hi- task of dressing up the
city. It has an army at work. It has
waited until the last moment in order
that the decorations may be quite fresh2
with the opening oi the festivities and the
chances of injury reduced to a minimum.
This Is the one thing amone the many
that experience has taught the decorators.
Everything was prepared and held in
readiness to be put into place with the
utmost expedition, and to-morrow even
ing will see all that district lying within
tlie boundaries of First and Seventh
streets, Spring and Broadway, swathed in
the wine, olive and orange that form the
nests, colors, ablaza at night with the
same colors flashed from incandescent
light?, ... d all relieved by a perfect forest
of ferns, and swinging at frequent inter
vals the broad folds of the stars and
stripes.
The work to-night is under the super
vision of Frank Wiggins, chairman of the
decoration committee. The general plan
contemplates the draping ot Main street
with the festival colors, so that it shall
wear the appearance of a long arch extend
ing from the plaza to Seventh street. The
bunting will be suspended from the trolley
wires and swung to the poles on Doth sides
of the street. Spring street to Seventh
will be all a-flutter with V-shaped Japanese
flags in the tri-color, swung from the
trohey wires. The flags are of satin,
edged with gold fringe. Broadway will be
treated similarly. Palms ana evergreens
spread from or twine about the teleeraph
and trolley poles. Swung also from the
trolley wires of all these streets, as well
as the side streets in the same area, are
tr;-colored incandescent lamps. On Main
street there are be>ides three electric V
sbaped arches of tri-colored lights. On
First, Second and Tnird streets are double
arches in similar lights, and again at
Broadway and T; ird another. All the
side streets, First to Fifth and from Broad
way to Spring, are dressed in tri-colored
bunting, with fans and pennants from the
troiiey wires and frequent American flags
of from twenty to forty feet spread.
The tribunes will be trimmed in white
with pennants swung on poles from the
back of the seats, giving a lively and
beautiful setting for the throng of people.
At the entrance to the tribunes will be
placed two immense tri-colored flags and
one American liag. A yellow canopy will
be spread above the throne, the base of
which will be green, with spreading palms.
Two larsre fiesta flags will swing from
each side of the lower steps. The sup
ports of tne throne will be covered with
green smilax.
The groundwork in the pavilion will be
of yellow, with a profusion of Chinese
lanterns, the supports tn yellow, trimmed
with ivy. The throne in the ballroom will
be covered with red silk.
At the athletic grounds the fiesta colors
will lind expression in pennants attached
to poles back of the bleachers, the grand
stand being trimmed with pennants and
the American flag. A special throne wiil
be built here also, trimmed with red satin
and gold.
Westlake Park, the scene of the water
rarnival, will be arched with incandescent
light.-.
The great carnival wi'l open to-morrow
evening with special ceremonies at the
Pavilion. At the tribunes there will be a
penes of Indian dances. Her Majesty
bavins* been put in the possession of the
keys of the city the evening before, wil;
nt sunrise on Wednpsday be saluted. On
the afternoon of tnat day the grand street
rarade will take place, a cavalcade of
caballeros and a special contingent of
Chinese, with their terrible writhing
dragon and gorgeous Oriental costumes
constituting characteristic features. In
the evening a grand concert will be given.
Thnrsdav afternoon will be given over to
athletic sports, and in the evening an illu
minated pageant.
On Friday there will be the beautiful
floral parade, and in the evening the
water carnival and fireworks at the park.
Saturday will be Children's day, with
patriotic exercises and a flag-raising, and
in trie evening the gay season will reach
its climax and conclusion in the great
revel of the maskers.
GARCIA WINS A BATTLE
Inflicts Heavy Loss on the
Spanish and Marches on
Manzanillo.
Shocking: Massacre of Wounded
Cubans by a Force of Guer-
rlllas.
HAVANA, Ciba, April 19. â General
Garcia is marching with 5000 men to at
tack the important town of Holguin, in
the province of Santiago, Cuba. The
Spaniards have tried to check hia ad
vance and a big battle has been fought
near Guamo. The Spaniards were com
manded by General Key. Advised of the
approach of the Spaniards, Garcia awaited
them on the Guamo road, placing seven
mines of aynamite in tbeir path. The
mines exploded prematurely, blowing up
only the vanguard of Rey's column, but
the explosion created a panic among the
Spaniards, who retreated in confusion.
Garcia then attacked the enemy witn ar
tillery and cavalry, and after a sharp
right, in which the Spanish loss was very
large, Rey withdrew, entering the town of
Guamo demoralized. Garcia, instead of
attacking Guamo, proceeded toward Man
sanillo.
There is great excitement in Havana
about the report of Garcia s advance on
Manzanillo. Weyler has given orders
that the garrison of Manzanillo be re
enforced with 20X) men.
Most shocking illustrations of savage
warfare by the Spaniards occurred on
Tuesday in this province between tne vil
lages of Guancas and Jesus Maria. Lieu
tenant-Colonel Harrera, at the head of a
puerrilla force of 200 men, surprised a
Cuban hospital in which about 100
wounded were being treated. All out
three of the inmates were killed by tne
invaders, who did not even spare two old
women acting as nurses. One of the pa
tients escaped by creeping, covered with
blood, to neighboring forests, and tells of
the rcassacr,e in a letter. He says:
'The Cuban guards, believing the hos
pital secure from attack, left only ten
men lor its protection. They did their
best to save us, but the Spaniards hacked
them to pieces with machetes. Driven
out from their couches, my poor fellow
sufferers hudd'ed in the middle of the
room and cried for mercy. The Spaniards
answered these cries with insults, ma
cheted some and thrust bayonets into the
bodies of others. Many died fighting
with hands and teeth. Lieutenant Men
doza, who only a week ago suffered the
amputation of a leg, grasped by the hair a
Spanish soldier, and while another ran
him through with a bayonet, he bit the
first in the throat, covering him with
blood, both falling together to the
ground."

NEW ORLEANS IS
IN GREAT PERIL
Levee Break at Carroll
ton Would Flood
the City.
The Dire Calamity May Be Ex
pected at Any Mo
ment.
Utah Is Alao Threatened With Dis
asterâFatal Snowsldes In
the Mountains.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 19 âThere
has been very great danger here to-day.
The levee at Carrollton is the point tnst is
feared the most. The watchers this after
noon discovered that the water had soft
ened me base of the levee and that it was
oozing througn. A break at that point
would place the highest parts of New Or
leans under six feet of water.
People say now that the break may be
expected at any moment. In case the
levee does give way preparations will be
made to sound the fire alarm, and ail tha
city bells will be rung.
People have been warned to seek safety
in the nearest substantial high building*.
The news from Madison Parish shows
that the water is spreading rapidly, inun
dating several villages. It is reported
tiiat fully 10,000 people are in great need.
The destruction of property and livestock
will be enormous.
The Biggs break is fast covering the low
lands, Hooding the Bayou Vidal and a
greater part of the lands in the southern
portion of the parish. The water has
reached Tallulab, eighteen miles west of
Delta, which is on the river bank. Delta
is about depopulated, only enough t>er
sons remaining to look after the flooded
houses.
The scare here over the Carrolltown
levee had somewhat subsided to-nieht.
The levee stands at the upper end of New
Orleans, ana a break would flood the
greater portion of the city. Much water
has been running through it since the
river rose, and since last week it has
shown signs of breaking. A large force is
busily at work strengthening the levee to
night.
NATCHEZ, Miss., April 19.- In the Mi3
sissiupi delta the situation continues to
slowly improve. The waters are reced
ing. The work of relief is being system
atically carried on. The river at Mem
phis is still falling, a recession of one-tenth
of a foot in the past twenty-four hours
being reported by the weather bureau last
night.
The first break on the Concordia Parish
front occurred yesterday when the Glas
cock levee broke, about twenty-three
miles below IN'atcnez. The water spread
over the lowlanus adjacent. The catas
trophe was not unexpected, and the stock
had all been removed. To-night a crev
asse is reported nearly 1000 feet wide.
ThÂ° city is fast filling with flood refugees.
VICKSBURG, Mi*~., April If). â Tue
breaK in the Rsid levee, a mile below the
Biggs break, is reported to be 300 feet
wide. Four steamers liave arrived, bring
ing 300 sufferers.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., April lfl.â The
Missouri is steadily rising. Though a
iar>;e area of bottom lands is under water
no serious damage bas been done so far.
A few poor families, numbering probably
fifty persons, have been washed out of
their homes, and are In need of food, but
their wants will probably be met to-mor
row by the locnl authorities. Tbese fami
lies are living in tents or under board
sheds that have been hastily thrown to
gether.
In Omaha the damage by the flood is
estimated at $200,000.
Those who know say that there is plenty
of snow yet in the mountains which, when
melted, w:ll increase tue high waters.
The people here ara seriously alarmed
over the outlook. They say it is the worst
situation they have ever seen.
SALT LAKE, UTAH, April 19.â The
warm weather has caused such rapid
melting of the unprecedentedly heavy
snow which fell in the mountains during
the winter that the valleys are now
threatened by extensive floods. Streams
are already overflowing and the lower
portions of this city are flooded. The
snow in the mountains is hundreds of
feet deep in many places and with cou
tinued warm weather disastrous floods
are inevitable. Enormous snowslides
have occurred in several districts, and at
Brigham City an avalanche buried six
men, three of whom, Fred J. Wolsianptcr,
W. J. Turner of Ogden and Ed Mau of
Plain City, were killed.
JJV THE t-Ll'H t,ME COURT.
An Important Ruling Relating to the
Statute of JAmitattont.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.-The
Supreme Court has decided to examine
for itself a cuse involving a iiJe insurance
policy for $100,000, which was suppo-ed to
have been settled by a decision of the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Guy C. Phinney, a resident of S -attle, took
out a policy in the Mutual Insurance Com
pany of New York, the annual premium
being about $3000, which he agreed to pay
in advance. At the end of the first year
he could not pay the premium and later
surrendered tno policy, which was can
celed. 'Jhree years later he died, and
some one informed his widow, Neihe Phin
ney, that the policy had never been legally
canceled because a certain notice had not
been sent by the company to Phinney.
She sueJ to recover the amount of the
policy, and in the Circuit Court for Wash
ington got judgment upon a jury verdict
for about $97,500. The company sued out
a writ ol error to the Circuit Court of Ap
peal?, but the majority of the Judges dis
missed the writ pecau c it bore no mark
indicating that it lind been filed in the
clerk'? office, although tiie clerk testified
tliÂ« writ had so been filed.
Liberal interpretation has been given
the operation of the statute of limitations
by the Supreme Court. Clarence R. Great
house, formally Consul-General of the
United States at Yokohama, sued in the
Court of Claims to recover $1858 fees which
he ba'J collected and paid over to the Gov
ernment when the law allowed him to
keep them. The Attorney-General, de
fendins the suit, set up the btatute of lim
itations. The court construed the statute
to give a man three years in which to in
siitute the action after disability includ
ing absence over the sea and the minority
had ceased, and gave GrÂ«athouse judg
ment for the amount claimed. This in
terpretation wasafliimed by the Supreme
Court. This cass is important as a test
upon which depended a number of ac
tions against the Government.

Broker Chapman's Sen

Power of tha Senate and House
Defined by the Supreme
Courr.
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 19.â BroKer
Chapman will have to go to jail for thirty
days and pay a fine of $100. Tim was the
decision of the Supreme Court to-day in
criminal proceedings, defended through
out with extraordinary pertinacity by
two of the foremost lawyers of the coun
try, wherein they were defeated at every
turn. The decision of the court, which Is
unanimous, is an announcement to every
citizen that he is subject to a subpena of
either House of Congress, through its
committee?, and if he fails to answer any
question the committee may ask hÂ« is
liable to prosecution and punishment.
Chapman was subpenaed by the Senate
committee appointed to investigate
rumors that the rates of the Wilson tariff
bill had been influenced by the dealings
of Senators In stock of the suear trust.
When asked whether any Senators had
dealt with his firm. Chapman declined to
answer. Besides Chapman, Havemeyer
and Scarles, of the trust, John McCart
ney, a" Washington broker, and E. J. Ed
ward and John A. Shriver, correspond
ents, also declined to answer questions.
The Attorney for the District secured in
dictments against each, and Chapman's
was selected as a test case. His lawyers
exhausted every resource known to law,
reviving after the lapse of nearly a cen
tury the writ of prohibition to prevent a
criminal court of the District from trying
the case. But it was all in vain.
The defense contended that the ques
tion- asked by the committee were not
authorized under the constitution, and
that the law under which he was indicted
was unconstitutional. The purpose of the
law, as stated in the title of the original
act, was "to more effectually enforce the
attendance of witnesses on tbe summons
ol either house and compel them to
testify." To secure this it was provided
that witnesses thus summoned who re
fused to answer "any questions pertinent
to the inquiry" should be punished.
â¢'According to the preamble and resolu
tions in this case," said the court, "the
integrity and purity of members of the
Senate had been questioned in a manner
calculated to destroy public confidence in
that body. It had the power to compel
witnesses to answer questions pertinent
thereto and pursuit of such inquiry in
this instance was not, in our Judgment, in
violation ol the security against unreason
able searches provided by the fourth
amendment."

Bow San frond* co Hill Be JffeeUd V
the I'ropnntd talk Schedule.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.â
Californians, led by Senator Perkins, are
keeping up their strong fight for an ade
quate protective tariff on California prod
ucts and are now hopeful of Mien.
The Call correspondent learned to-day
that the Senate sub-comxniitee encaged
on the Dingley bill decided to adopt sub
stantially the schedule on silk goods as
passed by the House. Â»
This will strike a heavy blow at the
commercial interests of New York and
San Francisco. It will practically destroy
our trade with Japan and throw out of
business a large number of firms in both
cities engaged in this trade, since it will
exclude the silts of both China and Japan
from our markets.
But that is a small matter compared
with the further enrichment of the great
siik - manu.actuiMij' hrms of Cheney
Brothers of Connecticut and one or two
large manufacturers in Paterson, who
make or wish to makp, silk goods similar
to the silks of the Orient.
It is said that a self-constituted com
mittee, consisting oi W, F. Cheney; Mr.
Huber, a P.itterson manufacturer; Honey
haus A Curtis and Pas-evant <fc Co., im
porters; A. Fleightman, importer and
also manufacturer of silks, in company
with V.ce-Piesiaent Hobart, were mainly
instrumental in securing the approval of
the measure by both the House and Sen
ate committees.
It is aiso said that the specific rates
adopted are equal to from 100 per cent to
150 per cent on Chinese and Japanese
goods and on poods made oi silk and cot
ton, as well as those made of spun silk,
which include all the cheap qualities
worn Dy tne common people. At the
si me time the costly dress goods of Lyons,
such as are imported by those importers
who are members of the promotion com
mittee, are allowed to enter at rates not
exceeding 59 per cent.
It is easily seen how acceptable such a
schedule must be to manufacturers, who
wiil thus be rid of all foreign competiti n,
and to importers, whose foreign trade this
has not endangered.

Charles Nordstrom, a Swedish subject, re
siding in the State of Washington, was to
be hanged Friday of this weeK for the
murder of one Mason, having been six
times sentenced to death for the crime,
but tbe end is not yet. An order was en
tered by tbe Supreme Court to-day sus
pending tbe execution until it can pass
upon the issue raised by his attorney,
Congressman Lewis, that, as a subject of
Sweden, the Supreme Court must pass
upon his case before the State authorities
can execute the death sentence.
Le^is was engaged in the case by the
Swedish authorities after Nordstrom had
been found guilty and sentenced. He
has fought tbe case through all the State
courts and through the Federal courts,
having once before been in the Supreme
Court, which then found no Federal ques

SECRETARY WILSON IS STUBBORN
Opposes the Move tor the Rescinding of
Cleveland's Forest Reservation
Oder.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.-GrÂ«at
pressure is beine brought to bear upon
President McKinley to induce him to re
scind Cleveland's forest reservation order.
Western Congressmen are up :n arms
against the order, which they regard as
detrimental to the agricultural interests of
their sections, but Secretary Wilson disa
grees with them. He has announced that
he intends to do everything possible dur
ing his administration to protect the for
ests and vigorously continue the policy of
his predecessor, Morton, in behalf of tree
planting. Specialists in tree culture are
much concerned over the rapid diminu
tion of coniferous woods now available
for timber in the United States. They
say that at the present rate of consump
tion this building timber will be ex
hausted in forty years.
Secretary Wilson stated to-day that he
had already instructed an agent of the
department to forward to this country
seed for planting trees successfully grown
in the arid portions of Austra'ia and
Russia. His idea is to utilize the millions
of acres lying idle for growing wood and
introduce upon this land trees that will
thrive under similar conditions in foreign
countries. The Secretary will devote him
self industriously to the problem of in
creasing the timber supply. Efforts to
protect the forests against lire have
already been begun in Minnesota and
Maine. The Secretary thinks the farmers
of the West would take a deep interest in
forestry if they understood fully how de
pendent they are upon the timber regions.
SPECIAL EMBASSADOR FOSTER.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.â Ex-
Secretary of State Foster, recently se

a plan in conjunction with Charles Ham
lin of Massachusetts for the protection of
seals in Bering Sea, has been appointed
by the President special embassador to
negotiate, conclude and sign an agreement
with Great Britain to secure joint action
for preventing the destruction of the seal
herds in Bering Sea. Hamlin's official
title is that of agent of this Government.
He will leave Washington shortly for San
Francisco ana will go thence to tho seal
islands to make a personal investigation.
Both Foster and Hamlin have been
Dusily engaged in reading reports at the
State Department about protecting seals
and in acquainting themselves with the
diplomatic correspondence on the subject.
it cannot be learned whether any nego

IN ARMY CIRCLES
Captain Romeyn's Cas
tigation of Lieuten
ant O'Brien.
The Latter Resented a Reflec
tion Upon His Wife's
Character.
Romeyn Refused to Retract and
Vigorously Replied to an
Insult.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 19.â 0n
the heels of the Commander Mullan naval
episoae comes a sensation from Atlanta,
1 Ga., which is exciting army circles. It
involves Lieutenant O'Brien, well known
at the Presidio of San Francisco.
Several weeks ago Captain Romeyn
knocked the lieutenant down on the pa
rade-ground at Fort McPherson, Ga.
O'Brien then preferred charges against
Koraeyn, and this caused such a stir in
army circles that the department sent
Colonel Thomas W. Barr from Governors
Island, N. V., to the seat of war to inves
tigate the cause of the trouble.
Colonel Barr found so much more than
he expected that on his return to Gover
nors Island a court was promptly ap
pointed to try the accused man. Every
possible influence was brought to bear
upon Lieutenant O'Brien to inJuce him
tc abandon his charges, but they availed
nothing. Tue evidence to be presented
not only concerns scandal in official
life here, but actually reaches back to tne
doings of Lieutenant O'Brien in Japan,
where he was sent by this Government to
observe the progress of the war between
that country and China.
It appears that upon Lieutenant
O'Brien's return from Japan he brought
to Fort McPherson his young and very
pretty wife. On March 1 last a wealthy
young Atlanta man named Bennett told
Captain Komeyn that he was going to
Washington to the inauguration and that
Mr*. O'Brien was going to accompany
him. Captain Romeyn urged him not to
do so. lie said that it would result in a
scandal, for thn ladies at the fort were
already suspicious of Mrs. O'Brien's con
duct.
Now it happened that the wealthy
young Bennett had another sweetheart at
Fort McPberson and this story reached
her ears. In a jealous mooJ she told
other iadie* at the fort. Lieutenant
O'Brien then felt called upon to resent
trie statement attributed to Captain Ro
meyn, namely, that Mrs. O'Brien's repu
tation was not above reproach.
Lieutenant O'Brien wrote a sharp note
to Captain Romeyn demanding that he
make public retraction of the remarks at
tributed to him, and Romeyn replied
with equal sharpness that he would re
tract nothing. The next day on parade
O'Brien began in a very dramatic way to
denounce Romeyn as a Hur and a slan
derer. He had hardly said ten words
when Ronieyn's fi<t struck: him in the
jasr a>:d he retired from active participa
tion in t:,e argument
Romeyn was arrested by Major Porter,
but after twenty minutes' confinement in
his own house was released. Fearine
another chysical encounter the friends of
both men kept them apart, and O'Brien
filed at Governors Island the charges
which brought Colonel Barr immediately
to Atlanta. These charges alleged con
duct unbecoming an officer and a gentle
man on the part of Captain Romeyn, and
three counts involved were specific:
First, that he warned yountr Bennett not
to be seen in company with Mrs. O'Brien;
second, that he asserted that the officers
of the post would not permit their fam
ilies to associate with Mrs. O'Brien, and
third, that in the presence of the troops
he knocked down a fellow-officer.
Captain Komeyn's defense will be the
substantiation of the position he has al
ready assumed Â»>.nd the assertion that he
acted throughout the part of a gentleman
and an officer. That this involves the
proving of the reflection he has cast on
Mrs. O'Brien makes the case the only one
of the sort, it is said, that the army
officials in this country have ever been
called upon to try.
That Captain Romeyn will make coun
ter-charges of some sort against Lieuten
ant O'Brien is positively asserted by his
friends, but their nature is not Known, ex
cept that they concern his general con
duct as an officer and reach back to his
visit to Japan, when he figured con
spicuously before the public as the alleged
inventor of the Port Arthur massacre and
the especial object of dislike of the Mi
kado.
Mrs. O'Brien is very wÂ«ll known in
Washington, where she has spent most of
her life. Her father is Captain Kendall,
one of the best-known and influential offi
cers of the army, now with the Sixth In
fantry. It is said he had a great deal to
do with getting young O'Brien's appoint
ment as ihis country's war representative
in the Far East.

Army and Navy Register says: "We have
received a Dumber of inquiries as to the

any changes in ;he near future. The con

walked up Broadway the cynosure of all

fact that Corbett was in town, shrugged
his shoulders and said, "Huh." To a
party of friends Filzsimnions said of
Sharkey:
"I wouldn't give him another fight it he
was the only lighter on earth and I was
itching to meet some one. Wait until
Maher meets him. Peter will make
mincemeat out of him."
Corbett, looking thin, arrived from
Philadelphia to-day with McVey, his spar
ring partner, and Joe Eagan. Corbett
said he was fairly defeated at Carson. Of
Fitzsimmons he said:
"I don't want to hound the man, but I
can't be convinced that he is the better
man. If he will tight me again 1 will
show the public that I am the better man,
and if he consents and beats me again I
will take off my hat and say he is my su
perior at every stage of the game."
Corbet', further said that he fought
Fitzsimmons according to his own ideas.
He says it is likely that he will be com

is serious in his intention 10 ignore him.

Goddard seems to be the only genuine

Five Miners Near
Ogden.
Two Who Were at Work in a
Blacksmith-Shop Are
Killed.
One of the Others Almost Suffo
cated Before Reached by
Rescuers.
OGDEN, Utah, April 19.â Two men were
killed and three imprisoned this morninz
by a snowslide at thcGar6e!d mine, about
twenty-rive miles from this city. The
killed were Fred Wolhaupter of Ogden,
superintendent of the mine, and Edward
Maw, a miner of Plain City. Utah.
The tunnel, engine-house and black
smith-shop are situated at the north side
of a gorge to the right of Gibbs Canyon,
about six miles from Brieham Cite, and
the place was selected by expert engi
neers as absolutely free from the danger
of landslides. Tne tunnel faces the south,
and the slide started from near the top of
the opposite side of the gorge. The mass
ofica and snow gained such an impetus
coming down the declivity that when it
struck the bottom of the canyon it was
forced up the side upon which was located
the t-unnel entrance and buildings and
crushed the blacksmith-shop like an egg
shell.
Wolhanpter and Maw were sharpening
drills at the time and were crushed to
death. Wolhaupter's body was recovered
at noon and Maw's at 5 o'clock.
The other men, William Turner, David
Russel and John Dalton, were working In
the tunnel. Turner had just come out
with a car when he saw the slide coming
down the other side. He made a run and
gained the engine-bouse before the ava
lanche was upon it and during all the day
was supposed to have been caught on the
outside, as his car was found in the slide.
At 5 o'clock a tapping sound was heard
and after an hour's work the engine-house
was reached and he was rescued, almost
suffocated. He will recover. The two in
the tunnel were rescued early and helped
to recover the bodies of the dead.
Wolhauptor was well known in Ogden
and leaves a widow and one child. Maw
is survived by a widow and seven children.
CARSHOPS FOR RENSON.
The Anzona Town Expects to Become
Division Headquaners of the
Southern Pacfic.
BENSON, Ariz., April 19â It is under
stood that the formal transfer to the
Southern Pacific of the New Mexico and
Arizona and Sonora railways will be made
on May 15, after toe absorption of the At
lantic and Pacific by the Santa Fe. This
will give the Huntington roai an outlet
to the sea at tiuaymas, which port is to be
made a stopping point for steamers of the
Pacific Mail line, which is as much a
Huntington line as is the Southern Pacific
itself.
Particularly affecting Benson is the
statement by officials of the railway that
following the amalgamation of t.ne two
interests the headquarters for the railway
division of Arizono and New Mexico will
be removed from Tucson hither, this be
ing the junction point for the two lines.
This would bring, as well, the railroad
shops, through which about $30,000 per
month is now disbursed in Tucson. Even
larger shops and fully 50 per cen.. added
expenditure will be entailed through the
operation of the Mexican branch.
It is believed the consolidation will also
mean the abandonment of the Arizona
and Southeastern track from Fairbank to
Benson. This stretch of twenty-five miles
was built by the Copper Queen Company
of Bisbee owing to a disagreement witn
the Santa Fe over freight rates from Fair
bank, wnere the mine's railway termi
nated, to the S 'iitiiern Paciiic connection
at this point. With a Southern Pacifc
line paralleling it this road will be made
practically useless.

Alleged Persecution of a Young Woman
Because She Wedded a R eh
Man's Son.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. April 19â The
arrest of Edna Lester and her appearance
in the Police Court to this city to-day to
answer to a charge of vagrancy has
brought to light a rather sensational story,
inasmuch as it is claimed that the young
woman is being persecuted at the in
stance of a wealthy Los Angeles banker
named Hart It is claimed that Hart's
son, becoming infatuated with the Lester
woman, left his family on heraccount and
has accompanied her to various places,
where invariably ths couple have beea ar
rested at the request ol Hart pero on
charges of vagrancy.
Some weeks ago 'young Hart was ar

leave tow.i with a six months' sentence
over his head in cioe of his return. He
was adv'sed to return to his father, but
instead of doing so he went to a neichbor
injz town. It is said that the father is
now attempting to have him again ar
rested on a charge of vagrancy, and that
proceedings will be pressed against the
young woman, which will probably result
in a term in the County JaiL
EUREKA'S BANK FAILURE.

EUREKA, Cal., April 19.â The failure
of the Randall Bank has been the one

declaring him to have caused the failure
seem abandoned. It is stated now that
his accounts with the bank are all right
and that had he arrived before Saturday
the crash might have been averted for
several days, but would have come eventu

FINDS AN HEIRESS
AT MENIAL TOIL
Wealthy Mrs. Green of
Alabama Locates
Her Niece.
Long Search Over the Coast
Ends in an Astoria
Laundry.
Former Alameda Girl to Inherit a
Quarter of a Million
Dollars.
PORTLAND. Or., April 19.â 0n the 7th
inst. Mrs. Annetta Green, an elderly
wealthy woman, hailing from Alabama,
came to Portland in search of her niece,
Miss Helen Ua Stapleton, whom she had
never seen, but who, if found, she would
make an heiress to the snug fortune
of $250,000. Mrs. Green at the time of her
visit stated to Detective Welsh that Miss
Stapleton was the only surviving child of
her sister, both of her parents being dead.
Miss Stapieton's father died in San Fran
cisco in 18S2 and three mouths or so ago
Mrs. Green received a letter from her
niece stating that the latter's mother also
was dead; but as the Alabama lady had
lost the letter she was unable to say
whether it was dated from Portland, San
Francisco or Seattle. The detective was
unable to locate Miss Stapleton here.
After leaving Portland the resolute old
lady again visited Tacoma, on the strength
of a premonition only, she said, but there
was no Helen Stapleton in that town.
On Monday last while returning to Port
land she met on the train Cyrus G. Eames
ana his wife, of Oakland. Cal., both born
and reared in Alabama. Mr. Eames heard
Mrs. Green speaking to another old lady
of her mission here, and he and Mrs.
Eames, having known the Stapletons, at
once introduced themselves to the old
lady.
It appears that Mrs. Eames' mother and
Mrs. Stapletou became warm friends after
coming to California, and while Mrs.
Eames is several yrars the senior of Miss
Stapleton the friendship existing between
their respective mothers was transmitted
to them and they maintained a corre
spondence. The Stapletonsâ mother and
daughterâ during the past few years had
grown so poor and seemingly friendless
that despite their education they hired
out as domestics rather than be beholden
to any of their old California friends or
their only relative, Mrs. Green, for any
assistance. This part of the story was
disclosed by Mrs. Stapletou to her aunt
Mrs. Green added that Mrs. Eames had
a letter from Miss Helen about two weeks
alter ihe latter's mother's death, stating
that she was going to Salem to accept a
position there, and at last accounts she
was still there.
Last Tuesday night the indomitable old
lady boarded a southbound train for the
Capitol City, never dreaming that her
niece had been force 1 to descend to severe
manual labor. Mrs. Green in two days
made the rounds of business places where
yuung women are employed. On Thurs
day evening she casually and thought
lessly made a coniidante of a chamber
maid in her hotel. That was another
lucky stroke for her, for that chamber
maid happened to have been employed in
the laundry where Mrs. Green found her
niece the following morning, ironing
away for dear life.
Both are now here en route for San
Francisco.
SHUT OUT FROM THE YUKON.
Hundreds of Gold-Seekers Find Their
Progress Blocked by Unfavorable
Weather.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 19.â The
steamship Al-ki, wh en arrived in port
iliis alternoon from Alaska, brought the
first information as to the progress made
by the throng of miners sailing from
Seattle for the Yukon gold fields the
latter part of March and the lirst ten days
of Avril. About two weeks ago 300 of
these gold-hunters crossed the divide
from Dyea, and they are now going down
the chain of lakes toward the Yukon.
They were fortunate in having set out
frnm tne sea so early, for there are now
reported to be from 1200 to 1500 men en
camped on this side, being unable, owing
to the unfavorable condition of the
weather, to get across. Over 600 are at
Sheep Camp, the rest beine about equally
distributed between Dyea ami Juneau.
Rather an unusual state of affairs exists
in regard to the condition of the range of
mountains between Dyea and t * lakes.
Even thus early the snow has melted and
softened to such an extent that the min
ers find it practically impossible to travel
over it without breaking through with
their dogs and sleds. Hardly ever has
ibis been the situation so early in the
spring, and unless there is enough of a
freeze to crust the snow again those on
this aide will no doubt experience many
unexpected hardships before crossing the
range.

COLUSA, Cal., April 19.â The town of

lars, who succeeded in getting away with
a.'iout $300 worth of cutlery from the
Hardware-store of L. O. Johnson, after ex
changing several shots witn Constable J.
O. Brewen.
At about 10 o'clock a tamale-vender saw
the two men emer the side door of the
store. As he knew that no one slept in
the building he surmised that they were
burglars and sent a boy after an officer.
Deputy Constable Brewen, in company
with a friend, went to the store. Consta
ble Brewen tried the side door and found
it was unlocked. He thought he heard
some one on tne inside, so he requested
his friend to go uptown afier help, saying
he would stand guard at the door until ha
returned.
Uis friend had gone only a short dis
tance when one of the robbers thrust a
six-shooter out of the door, and, with the
weapon almost against Brewen'a face,
fired, the ball just grazing the officer's
head.
Brewen ran around the corner of the
building, and as he ran four more shots
were sent after him. None of them took
effect. Soon two men emerged from the
side door and started on a run across lots,
one of them carrying a sack of booty on
his shoulder. Officer Brewen fired twice
at them, Dut in the darkness his aim was
wild. The burglars have not yet Dean
captured.
Wnen the interior of the store was ex
amined, it was found that a hole bad been
drilled into the safe preparatory to blow

TRAGEDY AT AUURAS.
Mrs. Mayo, Having Lost Her Child Through
a Divorce Decree, Shoots
Herself.
REDDING, Cal., April 19.â As a result
of a divorce recently granted in San Fran
cisco and a subsequent controversy over
the possession of a child Mrs. Mayo of Al
turas attempted suicide last Thursday by
firing a bullet into ncr breast just above
the heart and at last reports was hovering
close to death. To t ht. physician cailed to
attend her the grief-crazed woman in
pleading tones begged that she be left to
die, as she had nothing to live for now
that her child wastpkon from her.
Four years ago Mrs. Mayo separated
from her husband in San Francisco. Since
then she has lived most of the time with
her father, J. J. Wheeler of Lake City.
Some time ago Mayo applied for a divorce
in San Francisco, and as his application
was not contested by his wife the decree
was granted and tie ceased to support her
or her child.
On Saturday night. April 10, Mayo ar
rived in Alturas, and on Monday morning
went to the school, expecting to find his
boy, but was there told that he was in
Lakeview. Mayo left for LaKeview, and
his divorced wife learning of his inten
tions late in the evening followed in a
buggy, arriving but an hour after Mayo.
Mayo got possession of the child, avoided
his former wife and reached Alturas on
his return in time to board the stage for
Redding the next morning.
Mrs. Mayo's grief on discovering: that
her son had been taken away from her
was great, but she gave no indicatiot: of
her intention to take her own life. No
one anticipated a tragedy until the report
of a pistol rang out on Thursday morning
from her apartments in the Combs House,
Mayo claimed while in Alturas that the
courts below had awarded him the child
at the time he got a decree of divorce.
Alturas people say that he had not seen
the boy since infancy and had never in
quired about him or contributed to his
support.

COLONEL FINIGAN'S
PRISON DINNERS
How the Rich Man Fares
While in Marin's
Jail.
Permitted to Leave His Cell
to Partake of Wine
Suppers.
Judge Angeiotti Orders an Investi
gation of the Sheriff's
Conduct.
SAN RAFAEL. Cal., April 19.â The
proceedings in the Finigan divorce case
were of a decidedly interesting character
this morning. Sueriff Henry Harrison of
Alarm was before the court to show cause
why he should not be adjured guilty of
contempt for violating the order made by
Superior Judge If. IL Angeiotti to confine
Millionaire Peter A. Finigan in tne County
Jail until he paid $7.i0 alimony and costs to
his wife, pending the action for divorce
instituted by Mr?. Emily B. Finigan.
When the case came up for hearing T.
J. Crowley, one of the attorneys for Mrs.
Finigan, and upon whose affidavit Judge
Angelotti cited the Sheriff for contempt,
read the charges, which he said were a
matter of public notoriety. Although
Finigan had been ordered confined in the
prison the Sheriff had not, Crowley in
sisted, compiled with the order, and the
millionaire wns free to go in and out of
the jail to get French dinners at a hotel
across the roai from the courthouse.
District Attorney E. B. Martiu slli made
a statement on behalt of Sheriff Harrison.
He said that while he did appear as attor
ney for Mr. Harrison the Sheriff nad re
quested him to state in his behalf that he
was extremely sorry that theÂ«e things had
happened; that Bince last Friday, when
the matter had been brought to bis atten
tion, he had locked the millionaire in a
cell in the basement of the Courthouse
and thereafter the wealthy prisoner had
been constantly under lock and key. The
Sheriff, iie continued, had no inten
tion of violating the order of the court,
ami in the future Finigan would be
closely confined. Mr. Martinelli then
apoloeized to tbe court on behalf of the
Sheriff, and said that Mr. Harrison would
abide by its decision.
Attorney Crowley addressed the court
and said that he was glad the Sheriff had
admitted the facts. While he had no per
sonal feelings in the matter he believed
that the order ot the court should be
complied with. It was a fact tnat Mr.
Finigan had boasted that he would never
pay the alimony, and that he was enjoy
ing himself in the prison. He could have
French dinners sent to him, yet ne would
not pay the $750 alimony to his wife. The
lawyer said thai if it wan necessarylhe
could prove that Colcnel Finijzan had eft
tbe County Jail entirely aud had gone off
with his friends; that the doors were not
barred against him, and he was not given
a cell in the County Jail, but was occupy
ing a room in the basement of the Court
house.
Judge Ar.gelotti said this was one of
the most serious charges that could be
brought against a county officer. It was
so serious that he would like a thorough
investigation of the charges, and wanted
the Sheriff's deputies examined and also
others who could throw light on the
subject.
Ii was decided to postpone the hearing
until next Monday afternoon, when the
Kneriff could be represented by an attor-
ney.
When seen to-day Sheriff Harrison said
that he intended to light the case; that
Kinigan had been and was then con
fined in the County Jail proper, and that
it was not a room that he occupied, but
a cell with iron bars on the window and
an iron door such as was on any of the cells
in the prison. The same cell had been
occupied by murderers and ottier crimi
nale, aDd it was the one in which Lac
Doon, the Chinaman who afterward com
mitted suicide by hanging himself, was
confined for a time. The Sheriff dis
claims any intention of trifling with the
court and now Las Colonel Finigan
firmly locked up.
The millionaire does not complain. He
does not think the new order of things
will mean liis conlinemcut in the haunted
cell. For fourteen days he has lived in
prison and his health is in no way im
paired. His daughters visit him regu
larly every day and he takes a great inter
est in the affairs of the prison. AVhen a
nsw prisoner is brought in he learns all
about him and spends luuch of his time
in reading. He has the daily papers and
copies of the weeklies. When asked when
he expects to gain his lreedom again he
says that there is plenty of time; hiÃ at
torneys will look after his interests and
they tell him not to worry, bnt be patient.

Colonel Irish was introduced at the
afternoon session. In part he said:
The banking and currency legislation of this
I country since 1862 is the result of emercen
j cles, met by hasty action. These emergencies
have been of various kinds. Some of tLem
arose in the war and the readjustments which
followed. The most serious errors, however,
have their radius In emergencies purely par'.i
sau. Ol these the compromises of the several
refunding acts are examples.
The net result of haste and compromise is a
syhiem of financial legislation unbecoming a
modern commercial uation. Our Sat onal
banking svMem has been outgrown as a
means of distributing the surplus capita! ot
the country with fair equality, and is, by law,
compelled to be an instrumentality for con
tractm* the currency at the very time when it
should be expanded. The vice of the s> stem,
however, by no means closes the eyes of
thoughtful men to its virtues. Ita bill
holders sleep 11, safety wnile banks fail and the
record of liquidations shows a less percentage
of ioss to creditors than under any otber sys
tem we have had. Wisdom dictates tl.at we
discard the vices of the system and expand its
virtues into a scheme that will align with
scientific principles and give to a great people
a* good banking facilities: as any in the world.
â \Ye are familiar with the empirical proposi
tions in nuance which have held pub. ic at
tention and have seemed to attract nearly a
m> jority of our people. Ttie student of cur
reut affairs who passes over the-e propositions !
without proloundly investigating them snubs
his duly. Our countrymen never act without
a reason. Wo are not a willful or Insincere
people. We make no complaint without
cause and if we listen with favor to an map*
plicable remedy, it is because a Detter has not
r>een proposed. The member of Congress from
lowa uttered aery pinched out of the peop.e
by necessity, when he declared that "we need
a more and a fittener currency." That he was
ignorant and a demagogue was evident when
he proposed to expand the currency bf mak
ing any and every man's note of haud a legal
tender and irredeemable. That the people
feit the necessity to which he gave voice was
proved by two elections to Congress in spite
ol Hie appalling folly of the remedy he sug
gested.
The topular proposition to warehouse per
ishable products and receive lor them cur
rency certificates, while infirm as a remedy, is
valuable as a symptom of the inadequacy of
our banking system as a just distributor of
surplus capital. Rising in the scale toward a
legitimate system is the opposition to return
to (State banks of issue. Tiiose all have a com
mon origin in a necessity iel t by the people.
The monetary conference held in lnuianapo
lis on the 12th of last January w>is a conspicu
ous recognition of this necessity, it was a
convention of borrowers, not bankers. About
thirty States were there.
With interest at 1' 2 ' per cent in New York
City and 10 in Texns it is evident that our
ratan.i ot distribution are faulty. The farmer
is a business mnn. It is aa oid saying, anj
wise, that every good business man can oiteh
use more money than he has. Tiie merchant
or manufacturer, in close toucu with the
financial centers, has ready acee.-s to surplus
capital and can use his credit cheaply uu<l
conveniently. The greater the conpe-ition of
capital at the center the cheaper his use of it.
But at the lime when his opportunities are
greatest those of the farmer or planu-r are the
least. He, too, must use his crulit. Tr.e spara
between stediime and harvest must have pro
visions. He must carry a floating debt like
riie merchant Â«nd manufneturer, but he is de
prived oi the facilities to which they have ac
cess.
It is said, with more than a shadow of truth,
that a farm cannot stand 10 per cent interest'
As n matter of fact they do timid much more
Denied the cheap and ready use of credit the
planters of tobacco, rice and cotton in the
South, the wheat and corn fanners, farmers
who raise hogs and cattle in the Middle States
and our ranchers in the Went by compulsion
make wasteful and inconvenient use of their
credit. They are carried by the country store
keeper whose experience warn* him to in
demnify himse.f by an average advance of 28
per cent iv prices and interest on the running
account. His losses are not smalt; he is not
speedily enriched, but Is ujunlly with his
debtor me victim of an unbusinesslike system
whicu has a cause thatsnouid be removed.
It leads finally to an accumulated credit that
must .' c disposed of by a mortgage which rep
resents 25 i>er cent more than va.ue received
and bears from twice to four times the interest
that should be paid upon a business accom
modation. In this way unbusinoss-like meth
o is are cultivated amongst the producers, and
their complaint that they work for somebody
else is so Ur justnicd as to deserve our sym
pathy and our effort to remove. Under im
preved distribution that large class of business
men who are neither merchants, manufac
turers, nor professional men would have ac
cess to the use of their crelit upon equally
favorable terms. They would be trailed in
more exact business methods, would be less
often misled into speculation by the dream of
recoupment, and, above ail, would ficl them
selves at least a pm of the great business com
munity, equal citizens of the commonwealth
of trade and enterprise, and not hewers of
woou and drawers of water. And when the
pied piper of the tune of the demagogue ap
peared they would not follow to destruction
like the gaping children of Hameiln.
Bui these are not the only bufforers from tne
torment.- of our inadequate currency and
banking systems. We have the second larg
est foreign trade in the world, and carry it on
under conditions of peculiar difficulty. 1/ an
American merchant burs a cargo in Yoko
hama, Hongkong. Singapore, Calcutta, the
lonian Isles, Valparaiso or Rio be settles for
it in L mdon, aud its value is expressed in
English money. That is to say that the inex
orable law of trade selects for the clearing
house of the world's commerce the nation
that has the most scientific and stable system
of currency and banking. Our merchant iv
effect deposits the price of his cargo iv Lon
don to the credit of the seller. In its linal
analysis commerce is the exchange. For
every cargo that leaves a country finally a
cargo comes back in exchange. The nature of
trade is thai the invoice and bill of exchange
tske, at least one way, the same route. The
seller iv ,Tapin, OhmÂ«, the Straits, India or
Brazil of wuom we bougut, having owr depoe.it
to his credit in London, uses it, directly or in
directly, to exchange lor the compiemeniary
cargo which completes the exchauge of com
modities.
These conditions germinated in England
wnen Patterson founded the Bank of England
and Locke and XewtOn as a royal commi6*lon
smote a mixed and unstable" currency and
brought out of chaos order and system and
stability the most admirable.
1 am sura it is a worthy and patriotic amDi
tion that thli Republic shall achieve equally
vy striving to attain a currency system in
which mÂ»y be safely expressed the va.ue of
evory article of commerce, wherever pro
duci-d.
Vehave by far the greatest sea coast and
navigable river mileage of nny country on the
plane:. The seas are our highway and every
busy city that sits on every coast acd shore is
our commercial field. When our currency and
banking are revised and reformed and foreign
invoices follow bills of exchange to New York
a.nd not to London we will no longer lose hnlf
our commercial force in making a vacuum in
trade lor auother to fill.
Mr. Irish said it was these considera
tions that brought the bnsiness men, rep
resenting every section of the United
States, together at Indianapolis. Men of
ail sorts of beliefs on the financial ques
tion were there â free-silver men, bimetal'
lists and void men â but all were united in
the one belief tnat a plan for a better dis
tribution of the currency must be de
vised; something must be done to render
it more flexible. Against his protest he
had been named on the committee to
carry the matter to Washington. They
had been given a patient and sympathetic
hearing by the Congressional committees.
The President received them cordially
and listened for two hours.
''We found him standing directly in
line with his position as stated in his in
augural address," said Mr. Irish, "and we
rece ved his assurances that, upon the
conclusion of tne tar.ff legislation now oc
cupying the attention of Congress, he
would bring th.s matter forward in a
spec al message. We then had an audi
ence with Secretary of the Treasury Gage.
We found him even mote eager to secure
some legislation to this end than we were." |
In conclusion Mr. Irish expressed a i
strong contidence that good results would
be shortly forthcoming. He said that the
financiers of the East spoke in the nigheet
terms of respect for the wisdom and busi
ness sense and boneaty of tiie people of
California, especially as expressed in the
recent election.
The balance of the afternoon was con
sumed in a discussion of ihe propriety of
instituting a reform in the matter of Hold
ing instead of returning the checks of
depositors and correspondents. It was
decided to authorize the incoming execu
tive committee to correspond with the
National Bankers' Association on the sub
ject.
At the session to-morrow morning J. J.
Valentine of the Wells-Fargo Bank will
read an important papor on "Bimetal
lism." The officers for the ensuing year
will be chosen, the committee on resolu
tions will report and the convention will
adjourn.
STILL SHE COURTS DEATH
The Morbid Cravjng of a
Woman in the Prime
of Life.
Sadie Robinson Saved From Asphyx
iation Says She Will Ultimately
Kill Herself.
Mrs. Sadie Robinson, the wife of Daniel
Robinson, a barkeeper, attempted to com
mit suicid* <?arly yesterday morning at
her home, l|o3 Dupont street, by inhaiing
illuminating gas. When her husband re
turned from work he found tier in a coma
tose condition and bad her conveyed to
the Receiving Hospital, where she is still
suffering from the effects of her rash act.
Tiie case is a queer one and puzzles the
physicians in attendance.
Mrs. Robinson declares between times,
when she is not too drowav, that she is not
jeaions of her husband "J>an," who is
'trie best man on earth." He gives her
nil the money she carea to spend and has
provided her with a 1000 horue.
The woman is hardly I*6 years of age,
good-looking and physically healthy.
Still she said yesterday:
"I have me blues and I am desDondent.
I know no reason why I should be so, but
T propose to set rid of that feeling as soon
as I can. 1 will commit suicide as sure as
lam lying here on this cot right now. I
will not try tto do it with gas, because tbat
way 13 too slow. I will use something
that will act more speedily next time."
There has beou a death in iirs. Robin
son's family recently â tbat of a pet
nieceâ and her husband believes that it
has something to do with his wife's mor
bid condition.
JAMES COAKLEY'S DEATH.
Consumption Kndi the Career of a
Well-Known Reporter.
The many friends of James Coakley, the
well-known newspaper man and all-round
genial lellow, will be pained to learn of
liia death, which took place at Los An
geles yesterday morning.
The deceased had been connected with
the Evening Bulletin for a number of
yea rs, doinfr what is known as the "water
iront" detail, where he made for himself
a host of friends by his honest and frank
and courteous manner; so much so that
on his aeparture to the Bunny south in
James Coaklcy*
search of health which never came the
vessel that bore him out of the harbor was
saluted by the steam wnistleÃ of every
local craft on the line of the departing
boat.
After severing his connection with the
Bulletin he went to ValliMo, and with H.
F. Stahl started the Vallejo Evening
Isews, a bright, clear, sheet, which pros
pered under his able managemeat. in
addition to being an all-round journalist
lie was an expert tyue-setter, and those
who "held cases" with him in the com
posinr-room speak of him with kindness
and affection.
Stockton Dtji-nm Fremu.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 19.â The base
ball game between the teams from Fresno
and Stockton attracted a lars*a crowd to
the diarnend at Good water Grove Sunday
afternoon. Ibc-ig pitched a great Ranie
for Stockton and did not let the visitors
score many hits. ThÂ« batting honors
were divided between Locuhed and Sic-

some splendid fielding and in this respect
far outclassed the local men. The score

The California Society to
Make Important
Changes.
Colonel William R. Parnell for
Secretary, Vice C. Weltfi,
Resigned.
Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott of the Oik
land B-anch Likely to Be His
Assistant.
When the California Eociety for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children meets
on May 4 several important changes will
probably be made in the personnel of its
executive officers.
In the first place Secretary Charles
Welch's resignation will take effect. He
made this fact public a week ago, and in
lest than two days no less than forty ap
plications were made by those who
MRS. LYDIA PRESCOTT, Who Will Probably Be Transferred
From Oakland to the Assistant Secretaryship of the Local
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
wished to step into his shoes, assume his
responsibilities and draw bis salary of
$125 per month.
Tnen again there is an assistant secre
taryship to be filled, caused by the decapi
tation of Frank Holbrook, who soon after
became the secretary of a new society,
formed for the same purpose. The old or
ganization has carefully considered the
many applications, and as near as can be
learned its directors have made their de
cision.
Secretary Welch's successor will no
doubt be Colonel W. R. Parnoll of 2C23
Broadway. His assistant will be Mrs.
Lydia A. Prescott, who for a year has
been at the head of the Oakland branch of
the society. Her successor will likely be
Colonel 11. A. lUmpfel.
Brevet-Colonel William R. Parnell is a
retiied United States army officer. He
entered the volunteer service in New York
In August, 18G1, and rose in the ranks so
rapidly that in December, 1861, he was
promoted to the position of captain. Dur
ing the late war he participated in a large
number of battles and engagements under
the most prominent generals.
During the Gettysburg campaign he was
wounded and taken prisoner, but escaped.
Colonel Parnell ulso served in several of
the Indian wars, and his gallant conduct
carried him close to the top rounds of the
ladder of fame in United States army
annals.
Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott is already well
known on tnis coast as well as tnroucu
out the entire country. She has always
been prominency encased in progressive
end humane work. In thÂ«Â» literary world
she is also well known, being the author
of a number of widely read volumes. Her
labors in behalf of the little ones of Ala
mr-d.i County have endeared her to the
hearts of all who know her.
GRADY IS SET FREE.
Justice Carroll A: quits Him of
the Charge oi May
hem.
Shafer, Who Lost His Ear, Will Bring
the Matter B fora the Grand
Jury.
True to his declaration that he would
permit no arguments in the case of the
people agÃinst W. D. Grady, and that he
would decide it upon the testimony pre
sented last Saturday, Justice Carroll
handed down a written decision yester
day in Police Court 3 acquitting the ex-
Senator from Fresno on a charge of may
hem.
Grady was accused of biting off the ear
of William Shafer, a waiter in the Orphe
um Annex in January last during a
drunken riot.
The court reviewed the case, showing
taat the three witnesses for the prosecu
tion who declared they saw the biting
contradicted themselves and each other
as to the details leading up to the main
act.
They were also contradicted by erery
witness for the defense, none of whom
saw the Senator's teetn close on the
waiter's ear, and all of whom disagreed
with the witnesses on the other su\e as to
whftber Grady had hold of Bhafer and
scuffled in the miiidie of the floor or up
acainst the wall.
William Bhafer, whose ear was bitten
oft and who has a painful recollection of
when, whnre and how v was done, dops
not propose to abide by Justice Carroll's
judgment, but says that he will present
the case to the Grand Jury for investiga
tion. ,

TUENER KEAERESTED.
Hii Bond Found to Be Faulty After
He Had Been Released.
J. F. Turner, charced with grand lar
ceny, in whose case the iuiy disagreed
and who was released on $8003 bait yes
terday, was rearrested last evening and
taken to the County Jail. It developed
after his release that there was some
technical irregularity about the bond, and
Judce Wallace at once issued a warrant
for him and placed it in Sheriff Whelan's
bands for service. Bonds do not co into
the Sheriff's hands, he being required to
release prisoners on proper notice that
bail has been furnished. Turner will be
held until he furnishes new bail or the
first one is straightened out.
PILED TOO LATE.
Decision Tbat a Suit Is Not Comineuced
I'ntil Service Is Had.
Judge Morrow of the United States Dis
trict Court yesterday delivered a decision
j dismissing 'he bill in equity to set aside
I certain timber-land patents in the case of
I the United States against the American
j Lumber and Central Trust ComDanv.
The suit was hied Feoruary 3, 18C6, but
I the special order for ex-territorial service
necessary to be obtained was not filed un
til March 5, IS(W. This was two days
â¢ after the five years' limitation had ex-
I pired. The decision settles the question
I as to the time when suits of this kind
must be beeun in order to avoid the opera
tion of the statute of limitations, the
filing of the suit not being effected until

More Evtnts Tc-Day.
There was a ereater crowd of people fac
ing the parade ground at the Presidio yes
terday atternoon at 1:30 o'clock than ever
attended this section of the military reser
vation before. Three sides of the grounds
were marked by a rope fence, within which
were none but the officers having charge
of the grand military tournament and
those who were to laKe part in the con
u-ts. In the grand stand, on the bleach
ers at either end and outside of the ropes
there were not less than 7000 persons,
nearly one-half of the number being
ladie: â to say uothiag of children by the
hundreds.
The grand stand was handsomely deco
rated with American flags and the three
colors representing the three branches
of the service â red for artillery, white
for infantry and yellow for cavalry.
The ground set apart for the contestants
was marked at the corners with small
American fla^s. Withai the lines were

were soldiers on guard dut}- to prevent
any one not authorized to pass lrom going
through the! ne -, Then there were gath
ered here and there groups' of contestants
rÂ»ady to answer the summons to come to
the scraich. Tne Crowcia, toe people in
tiie stands and the officers and men formed
a magnificent picture.
The management of the grounds was
very creditable and Â«nows what the pres
ence of ti.e military has to do with the
preservation of perfect order.
Promptly at half-past one the First In
fantry baud played an overture, a"d as
the echoes of the last notes were being
sent back from tne bills on the south of
the grounds the mea were called for the
first event, which was a 100-yard dash
with six entries â two of the participants
be:ng Sergeant Puckett, "the pride of
Company G," First Infantry, and Ram?s
o: Company E, Third Artillery, the two
beÂ«t runners in the department. It was a
crouching start, and the men pot off well
together. Puckett soon gained on all, but
before hait the distance was run Rumes
en: the lend and kept it to the nnish.
Time, 10 3-5 seconds; Puckett second. The
record for that distadce i- 93-5 seconds.
Throwing the 16-pound hammer fol
lowed^ There were five panic pants.
There was much enthusiasm when Rol
lins of Company G, First Infantry, scored
102>i feet. He was declared the' winner,
was Hikox of Company H. Third Artillery,
second, and Williams of Company O, First
Iniantry. third. The. world's record for
this event is J43%.
Then there was a bicycle race, 440 yards,
with rive itarters. Roberts oi Battery E,
Th.rd Artillery, who was a great favorite
with the people of the posts, forged nhead
in the first twenty-rive yards, and kept the
lead :o tue finisb, making the distance in
8:08 2-5. His performance was erected
with wild at plause. Fernandez of Com
pany X, Fourth Cavalry, came in second,
and Newman of Company F, Third Artil
lery, third.
Ihe next event was a cartridge race.
Five men mounted stood at scratch,
placed their unloaded revolvers on the
ground, then rode to the farthest of fire
points, where each end man picked up a
cartridge, returned to the starting point,
dismounted, placed the cartridge in a
chamber of his revolver and then re
turned after the fourth cartridge, and so
on untl the five had been picked up.
Each fired one shot on remounting. This
was a good display of horsemanship ana
required mounting and dismounting, i
>!i iner of Company B, Fourth Cavalry,
won in 2:24 1-5, Kelly of Company X,
Fourt . Caeuiry. second and, Fon shell of
Company F, Third Artillery, third.
In the 220-yard race, which followed, |
Puckett fell and wat disabled almost at i
â he s art. The winner was Rames, in
24 4-6 seconds, Woodruff of Company H, i
First Iniantry. second. The world's rec- i
orJ lor :his event is 21 1-5 seconds.
Tbe running b.ph jump was long and
tedious, rod a number of men fell out
aft. r four or five trials. Roberts won with
a record of 5 feet 2 inches, Harrison o:
Cirr.pp.ny I, Fourth Cavalry, second,
Denne third.
The len-hnrdle race, 3 feet 6 inches,
was an exciting event and well contested,
the panic. pants displaying much agility.
In tlie first neat Cameron of Company D,
Thirl Arti:iery, won in 19 1-5 seconds, and
in the secon i Carter of Company D, First
Infantry, won in 18 4 5 seconds. The final
iieat will be run to-uay.
In tbe eighth event, the spare-wheel
race, ratlin* a wheel over a distance of 100
yards, there was but one contestant,
Mueller of Company F. Thiro. Artillery.
He made a poor ttart, but soon recovered
himself and covered the distance in 22 2-5.
The b:oausword contest was a very ex
citing event. Tiie men were mounted and
used wooden ewords. In the first heat
Haberkarnm of Company I, Fourth Cav
nlry, and Souvleskioi Company X, Fourth
Cavalry, were the contestants'. The last
named was the most expert, and scored
eight points to his opponent's one. In the
second heat Ratcbford of Company C and
Weber of Company F, Fourth Cavalry,
were the contestants. Ihe last named,
who dist.iayed much skill in the use of
weapons, scoren eijjht to one. The win
ners, Souvioski and Weber, will have to
contest to-day wiih Davis of Company B.
The rnn, hop, step and jump was won
by Cameron ot Company D, Third Artil
lery, 37 feet. Kelly of Company A, First
lnfantry, was second, and Kramer ot Com*
pany B, First Infantry, th.rd.
Burke ot Company A, First infantry,
and LÂ«ng uf Company D, sum* regiment,
were the contestants in a contest called
hasty entrenchment. The men equipped
for marching ?.Â«re given five minutes :n
which to dig a trench and use the tartb
for protection from the enemy. They
dag tbe trenches in hard ground, using
their bayonets for that purpose, and with
their tin plats threw op the earth. Both
men worked hard, Lang with the greater
portion of his equipment on, while Burke
removed all of his. The latter was de
clared tbe winner.
Then came the mounted gymnastics in
which Fezer of Company B, Harmon of
Company land Fernandez oi Company X,
Fourth Cavalry, took pan. The men,
minus roata ami hats, roJe bareback
hor ea and performed a number of evolu
tions which were equal to any given by
the most experienced riders in the circus
ring. The nurses as well as the men were
well trained and some of me feats were
really wonderful. For instance, one rider
Jed a borne and while they were going at
a lively trait one of the men ran alongside
of the led horse, leai>ed and landed on the
other horse behind the rider on the ridden
horse. The vanou*- leais were loudly and
dcerydly applauded. Atone time Fer
nandez fell from his horse and under him.

Company C, First Infantry, was third.
Alter the race Raines reeled and fell in a
faint to the ground. He was picked up
Dy his comrades, kindly cared for and in
a few minutes he recovered. The world's
record :or this distance is :47% seconds.
The fourteenth and ;ast event was the
tug-of-war. The first tug was won by the
team lrom Battery A, Third Artillery, at
AJcatraz, which at the end of rive minutes
pulled tnerope over one and one-half.
The second tug was won by the team

A l'annsl Dr aired
ALAMEDA, Cm., April 19.â Now that
it has been definitely decided there will be
no - joint bridge across the estuary the
tun ii*l proposition again comes up, and
there is a strong feeling among many in
the city that a tunnel should be built
rather than a second bridge. At present
delays are frequent and annoying, caused
by the opening of the draw to permit ves
sels to pass, and as traffic increases on the
estuary these delays mast become worse
and more frequent. It will be impossible
to obtain the land necessary for ap
proaches to a tunnel any cheaper than
now or to build such a structure at any
less expanse than at present. With a a tun
nel the difficulty would be solved for all
time and traffic on the estuary as well as
across it would be unimpeded.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 20, 1897.
FRUiT MEN WANT
A SAFE TARIFF
Major McLaughlin and
John D. Spreckels
Aiding Them.
Telegrams and Letters Sent to
Washington Urging Needs
of Calitornia.
k Great Home Industry in Peril of
Being Injured by Foreign
Competition
The chairman of the Republican State
Committee, Major Frank McLaughlin, as
the result of telegraph;c correspondence,
had George Frost, president of the Cali
fornia ritru -/rowers' tariff committee,
and Frank A. Miller of Riverside visit this
City a few days since for consultation on
the tariff bill now before tbe United State*
Senate Finance Committee, and with a
view 10 assisting the iruit-growers of this
State in obtaining desired tariff legisla
tion. Senator Perkins is earnestly labor
ing in their behalf, and quite a number of
telegrams have been forwarded to Wash
ington urging the importance of the pro
posed legislation.
In a telegram to Senator Morrili, chair
man of the Senate Finance Committee,
Major McLaugnlin says:
Tne efforts being mnae in the interest! of
foreign fruit-crow ers should not be permitted
to i-revail against that great and growing in
dustry in California, in which mauy millions
of dollars are involved. The business inter
ests of this State imperatively demand no re
duction from the House schedule on raisins,
Zame currants ana citrus iruits. The latter
requires 1 cent per pound protection. I ap
peal to you to aid Senator Perkins.
John D. Spreckels, as a member of the
National Republican Committee, tele
graphed to Senator Allison as follows:
I believe you will make a mistake in at
tempting to return citrus fruits to a meniure
ment bmÂ«. The industry here is much tie
pres.-ed and the reque-4 lor 1 cent per pound
will not put our growers ou an equality with
foreigners.
Telegrams have also been sent to Senat
ors Alii rich, Platt of Connecticut, Wolcott
and others to assist the California fruit
growers.
In a letter to Major McLaughlin the
secretary of the California Citrus-growers'
Tariff Committee, Frank Wiggins of Los
Angeles, says:
We are endeavoring to bring every pressure
to bear on the representatives in thÂ«- United
States Senate toward procuring proper tariff
on California fruits.
We are especially Interested in this sectiou
to nave a tariff Disced on citrus fruit* of 1
cent per pound. The Ways and Means Com
mute.; of the House recommended a rate of
% ot a cent per pound.
We have representatives in Washington who
are working to have the amount railed to the
1 cent rate, and In opposiion to Â« 1 this every
foreign dealer and importer, backed up by
mauy Eastern capitalists, ar.- working to re
duce the rate to its old standard, jhich would
be equal to % of a cent per pound.
They are aiso fighting ihe pound proposi
tion, ciaimh.g that it in unfair.* The mere fact
of this opposition is sufficient to convince any
thinking man it is the only proper way to Im
pose a tariff that would be benencial to us and
prevent frauds upon the Government.
The following memorandum has also
been issued:
The House of Representatives has adopted a
duty of three-four trig of a cent per pound on
citrus fruit.
The representatives of the citrus fruit
growers, now at WHShington, and the Los An
geles Chamber of Commerce are asking that
the tariff be made 1 cent per pound
Many foreign countries, like Russia. Austria,
Sweden aud othersâ where no citrus fruit is
raisedâ have placed a h gher duty on oranges
than the American gtower asks in order to
enable iilni to compete with the foreigu ship

The importers of New York, principally
Italians and Spaniards, have organized to Ue

to influence our Congress. The Italian Minis
ter at Washington, it is reported, under in
struction of his Government has invited the
Importers to come to Washington where they
now constitute a .obby.
Tue industry needs a protection of 1 cent
per pound in order to exist. Picase write to
your lriends In Congress, and Senate, urging
them to support the measure set forth above.
ADULTERATED JELLY.
Judge Senwell Decidea That One Who
Sold Bogus Food Producta
MiiMt <â¢<> to Jail.
Sellers of adulterated food received a
shock yesterday. The case of Louis
Hartter. charged with selling adulterated
currant jelly, was beard by Judge Seaweil
on a writ of habeas corpus.
The point made in tbe writ was that the
offense charged was an indictable misde
meanor, and that Police Judge Campbell,
who heard tbe case, bad no authority to
try it, as under the law tbe costs assessed
against the defendant might be in excess
of $1000â a state of facts which would take
tbe case out of the Police Court jurisdic
tion.
In deciding the rase Jndge Sea well found
that the statute failed to provide any ma
chinery for determining the costs and ex-
Den-es of inspection and analysis. The
order of the court in tlie matter would
not take the form of punishment for vio
lation of the law, but merely that of a
judgment for co j ts.
Judge Seawell held that part of tbe
statute void for uncertainty, and sus
tained tbe remainder of the statute. He
thereiore remanded Hartter to the cus
tody of the Sheriff, and the defendant
will either have to pay a tine or go to jail.

GEORGIA CAYVAN
IN A NEW PLAY
W. R. Walkes Has Little
Sympathy for the New
Woman.
The Alcazar Proves That Tom
Taylor Still Has Power
to Please.
An Actress-Aut oress at the Grand
Op.Ta-Houseâ Minstrelsy at
the Baldwin.
\V. R. Wai fees 'evidently intended to
point three morals when he wrote "Mary
Pennington. Spinster," which Miss
Georgia Cay van produced for tbe first time
in San Francisco at the Columbia Theater
last night. Tbe morals are tbat however
erudite a woman may be she is totally un
fit to manage any business undertaking,
that if ladies take the initiative in matri
monial affairs and pop the question
nothing but misfortune can come of it,
and that a 'Varsity education rather ham
pers a woman than otherwise in the race
of life, for it unfits her for giving full rein
to the affatr* of the heart, which W. K.
\VaikeÂ« evdently considers the begin
ning, tbe middle and the end oi a femi
nine existence.
The plot of "Mary Pennington,
Spinster," is rather too light and flimsy
to bear the burden of these morals, and
the consequence is that the interest
of the audience languishes before the end
of the piav.
Mary Pennington is a lady of great
learning, who carries on the business en
terprises of her late father, with the
assistance of a junior partner and of an
elderly friend, Dr. Timothy Hale, who
plays Mentor to the Telemaque of every
one he comes across.
Without having any intention of being
humorous, Mary has the sort of ideas on
woman's rights that ti.e new woman is
represented by comic papers as posiess
liir. For instance, she dismisses ail the
men from her mill and hires women in
-.heir places. The junior partner protests
in vain against a course that threatens
financial ruin, but Mary persists, being
one of those people who are very "set in
their ways."
There would not be any play at all if it
were not for Dr. Timothy Hale. He in
vites Mary to become engaged to the
junior partner, to "cement the business
interests." He also invites Prudence
1 lentil-, Mary's learned young cousin, to
give lessons in topic to a very uncultured
young man named Algy Bloom fie Id, who
knows so little about ancient British his
tory that he thinks Queen Boadecea was
some part of an Easier oonnet.
Haying set the ball of two courtships
rolling, Dr. Hale awaits developments.
Mary propose* to Geoffrey and is accepted.
Prudence and Algy give every outward
â¢in. i visible sign that they are going to fall
in iove over the logic, and Lady Maitland,
a scheming widow, shows tbat she, too,
loves Geoffrey. This is all in the first act.
and the blast* theater-goer has little dif
ficulty in divining how the rest of the play
wili run.
Miss Georgia Cayrnn acted thÂ« role of
Mary Penninglon very frankly and charm*
lii.jy, indeed she made almost more out
of the part than w<ts in it. Mis- Mary
Jerrold was a de.iu'htfu.l little Prudence.
Her scenes with the illiterate Geoffrey are
the autnor's happiest efforts, tor they are
both amusincand original. George Wood
ward played Dr. Hale with plenty of
spirit and dry humor, and Charles Thropp
took g od care oi Ally's role.
Orrin Johnson made what he could of
the junior partner's role, but Ann Suth
erland was a trifle cruieas Lady Maitland.

Spinster," is the best part of the play,
though the comedy part of the dialogue is
si arming all through. Some of the rÂ»
rriHrks are decidedly original, as when Dr.
Haie describw a gossippin;* community
by saying, "This towu is a nest of tea
drinking hornets."
The Alcazar.
It was nothing short of a happy inspiration
that led the A.czar to stnge Tom Taylor's
comedy, "The Overland Route."
Although its author has been buried this
many a day, the play is up to date wrf s. 11
good to please lor years to come.
The title is rather misleading. Nearly all
the action taxes place aboard ship; const
quently, "Overland Route" gives one much to
puzzle over and consider.
Tne old comedy calls for a rather long cast,
and brings to the front the best there is in
Belasco'a stock company. George Osbourue as
Loribond, the Singapore merchant, iv his
rcane-up brought to mind visions ot wnat
'â Uncle* George Bromley will look like when
he really grows old. His acting was as gocd
as hU make up, and that is not giving the
gentleman fair praise.
Mrs. F. M. Bates, who, by the way, reap
peared iast evening after a rather protracted
absence from the stage oi this oozy theater,
was accorded a warm welcome by her many
iriends and admirers. She piayed Mri. Lori-
Dond with a true commanding spirit, and
mace an excel:ent contrast to Miss lielgarde's
sprightly Mrs. Sebright.
The rest of the cast was in good hands.
Powers m.ide an excellent Sir Solomon Fraser
and Gordon Foster a dashing Tom Dexter.
The old comedy is the best that ihe Alcazar
has done for some time, and is a fit offering
lor the joyous Easier week.
Grand Opera-House.
"The Brand of Cain" is the name of the ro
mantic play given at the Grand this week.
Miss Mamie Sheridan Wolford, a rather clever
little woman, made her initial appearance at
the Grand and Droinbes to establish herself as
a favorite. Ker part is that of nn Irish servant
whose chief wi-sion in life is to save the hero
aud heroine trom hornbte death?. This she
does in a most diverting way. .-he and Nat
Willis have all the comedy tnere is in tho
play.
trod Butler plays a dunl role, the usual
thing, a gcod and a bad brother, iv an effec
tive manner, ana surely the stage has no
other such a "dyed in the wool" villuin as
John V trson. Landers Stevens playb the
"good old man," who, as usual, is doomed to
death in the early part of the story, but he
makes a most wonderful escape and lives to
accuse the wrong man of the crime. Lorena
Aitwt'od has but little to do, but such aa it is
she doei it well.
The Orpheum.
Madam Annina Orlandi and Signor Achile
Albert), late of ihe Mapleson grand opera
company and the Sjalchi concert organization,
are the star attractions in the very excellent
programme the Orpheum Is offering i;s patrons
this week.
Alberti is the possessor of a clear tru<* bary
tone voice, ana his Romanza from "Faust"
arouitid the audience to enthusiastic applause.
Mme. Orlandi in some way appealed to the
risibilities of the gallery, who saw fit to ac
company her cadenzas with a running string
of laughter. The orchestra, however, com
pensated by unstinted appiause. Marzelo and
Miilay. clever acrobats and burlesque wres
tlers, Herr Graus and his trick bauoon and
doukey. are among the new features on
the programme.
Tivoll Op Ta-House.
"The Lily of Killarney" opened Its second

MERCHANTS WANT
THE CITY'S AID
Business on Lighted Streets
Has Increased Ten
Per Cent
The Supervisors Will Be Asked
to Carry on the Good
Work.
At the R quest of the Improvement
Cinbs the Merchants' Associa
tion Will Act.
One of the important questions now
being considered by the various i.nprove
ment cluhs is that of providing for the
continued existence of the electric street
lights, the expense of which has been
borne by the merchants doing business oa
the stive's so improved.
Polk street being the first of the streets
illuminated will as a matter of course be
one of the first who-e six months' con
tract with the electric light company will
expire. This will occur on the Ist of
May, and the question now uppermost in.
the minds of the merchants on the street
is "What is to be done?"
This is partially answered by each and
all who have subscribed to the light found
that, come what may, Polk street cannot
be permitted to relapse into the condition,
of the dark ages, out of which it was taken
six months ago.
By judicious management the executive
committee of this club will be enabled to
keep the street lighted during the month,
of May out of the surplus saved during
the past six months. Something, how
ever, must be done to keep the lights
burning daring the month of June.
Then comes the issue of the day, not
only with the PolK-street bat all the im
provement clubs m the City which have
lighted streets as a feature of their im
provements. A combined effort will be
made by all the clubs, through the Mer
chants' Association, to induce the Super
visors to provide in the annual appropria
tion sufficient funds to have all the streets
now lighted at the private expense of the
merchants and property-owners hereafter
illtiminnted at the expense of the tax*
payers of the whole City.
The executive committee of the Polk
street Club recently extendei invitations
to all the other clubs in the City to meet
(or the purpose of discussing a mode of
procedure to accomplish thi3 purpose, but
owing 10 a clerical error in the notice of
the call no meeting was had.
Since that time, however, the general
op:nion of the clubs has been expressed
that the matter could be dealt with by the
Merchants' Association representing the
clubs before the Supervisors.
From the same clubs comes the unani
mous opinion that the electric lights on
the streets have been beneficial from a
business point of view.
Several merchants on Polt street say
that business has improved 25 per cent
during the past six months.
Third street â one of the last to get
the electric current turned on â is still
m<re boastful of an increase in business.
Bernard Katschinski of the Philadel
phia Shoesture, speaking for th- Third
street merchants, said he was tree to ad
mit that the business oa that street has
improved over 50 per cent since the street
was lighted up, and he is still more hope
ful of this street being second to
none in the City as soon as the newspaper
buildings now in course of construction
are finished. After that he tays he will
spend $10,000 in improvements on his
store, and other property-owners will
follow suit on the improvement line.
Consequenily the Third-street mer
chants nre in favor of having the lights
continued at the general expense of the
taxpayers. â  . ; j

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Colonel Vassos will now have to leave
Crete or lose the fun, and the choice is
not an easy one.
Sympathr is almost universally on the
Eiue of the Greeks, but the betting seems
to favor the Turk-;.
It is an easy prediction that the worse
sjell3 of the present war are going to be
found in names of the battlefields.
" *
Los Angeles will have more beauty this j
week than ever before. Quite a number j
of San Francisco girls are going to La j
Fiesta.
It will be easy for Los Angeles to see
herself double this week, lor the rapture
of the tiesta will maka her a city beside I
herself.
Now that the Greeks have entered npon
a campaign with Skouzes as War Minis
ter, let us hope they will not come out of
it with excuses.
The war in the Levant will probably free
our raisin-growers from the competition
of Zinie currants, and to that extant
Fresi-.o is in luck as;ain.
The war between Greece and Turkey
will not concern as much. Our duty is to
keep up the work on Balboa avenue and
yrovide employment for labor.
It matters little whether the Greeks or
the Turks were the aggressors. The im
portant question now is which of the two
Will show itself most aggressive.
The gold standard Democratic papers of
the East are almost unanimous in refer
ring to the celebration of Jefferson's birth
day by the Bryanites as a "desecration of
the day."
There seems good assurance of an alli
ance between Germany and Russia, but
whether t is an agreement for a mutual j
Btand-off or to whip somebody else is not j
so certain.
It would be interesting to know whether
Bismarck was riled by Gladstone's letter
denouncing the Kaiser as a "youthful
despot," or whether he put it In his pipe
and smoked it
The scheme by which Cleveland under
took to secure positions for life to all his
cuckoo office-holders may be defeated yet.
There is such a thing as taking a trick of
that kind by trumping it.
Every treaty we have arranged with
England in recent years seems to be full
of blow-holes, and the best thing the ad- i
ministration can do is to throw them all \
in the waste-basket and make a new lot.
The only effect of the retroactive clause
of the Dingley bill that can be surely
counted on is that it will lead the new
tariff straight from the President to the
Supreme Court as quickly as can be.
If the Servians, Macedonians and Al
banians join with the Greeks Turkey will
be carved and distributed before next
Thanksgiving, and an immemorial joke
on that anniversary will be lost to the
American people.
According to a recent report the money
gifts to Yato du r ing the last decade have
averaged $400,000 a year, and atill the
president iÂ« asking for more. Asa little
learning is dangerous he wishes money
enough to supply it in bulk.
If the report is true that when asked
his opinion of the Democracy of David
Bennett Hill Mr. Bryan "relapsed into
8 lence," it is to be hoped somebody will
aÂ«k him the same question from this time
on until the country has a rest.
It is believed that one of the reasons
why Speaker Reed declines to appoint the
committees of the House is that the pres
ent situation gives him a means for con- j
trolling the unruly members. Every man j
who has enough leadership to aspire to
the chairmanship of a committee looks to
the Speaker for the appointment, and in
the meantime behaves himself.
The proposal in Kansas to tax "inor
dinate wealth" has raised a discussion
over the meaning of the term. A degree
of riches which might be inordinate in
one locality would, hardly be a compe
tence to keep up with the procession in
another. Taking the United States &â¢> a
whole no man's wealth can be called
inordinate bo long as there is a millinery -
Etore in every town and a new Easter
every year.
To the leaders of the Democratic party
Ihe New York Sun says: "Too much
Bryan, gentlemen, from this time on will
mean too few Democratic votes at the
next election." The warning was doubt
less well meant, but as it is better for the
country to have too much Bryan rather
than too much Democracy, it is gratifying
to know it will have no more effect on
Democracy than the buzz of a gad-fly on
the ears of a donkey.
Senator Allison having been asked
when the tariff bill would probably be
adopted is reported as having replied: "I
rhonld say. the middle of June would be
ns early as could be expected. The first of
July may come before it is a law." It
will be seen Irora this that but for the
retroactive clause the speculators would
have had a great deal of time to import
large stocks of foreign goods nnder low
duties and thus provide themselves with
h-s fronts at the expenao oi ike ireaiurj.
THE WAR IN EUROPE.
The conflict between Greece and TurKey has been so long before the world that
j the formal declaration of war occasioned no surprise and has had hardly any effect
upon the stock market. Such influence us it may have had was foreseen long ago,
and has been amply discounted by the able and far-seeing financiers who manage the
great bulk of the world's business.
In this country the effects will hardly be even noticeable. As Secretary Sherman
has pointed out, our trade with Greece and Turkey combined constitutes but a very
>mall fraction of our foreign commerce. Neither country exports or imports any of
the ereat staple products of the American people, and it is doubtful if the war will
have any great effect even ui<ou the wheat market, which is more susceptible to war
influences than any other.
It is well understood, however, that the noimal continuance of commerce is de
pendent wholly upon the ability of the great nations to keep the war localized in the
Levant and avoid on their own part any complication with it. To this end the diplo
macy of the statesmen will now be directed, and from the present outlook it seems
altogether probable that they will be successful in doing so.
The elements of danger are the personal characteristic* of the two rulers whom Mr.
Gladstone called the "youthful despots" of Europe. If the ambitions of either the
Czar or the Kaiser should be excited by the progress of events there is no telling what
j a day might bring forth. Fortunately neither of them is such an absolute rnler in
fact as he is assumed to bo by the law of hi: country. The Czar is an autocrat in name
only. .Russia is realJy governed by a bureaucracy which acts in the name of the Czar,
and which, being supported by the nobility and the church, has frequently shown'
itself powerful enough to withstand much stronger and more resolute men than the
present Czar has ever Deen reputed to be. Much the same condition prevails in Ger
many, and, even if the Kai'er were eager for war, it is by no means certain that he
could obtain from his Ministers, his Parliament and his people a sufficient support to
encage in it.
According to the latest reports from Europe the Governments of Russia and Ger
many are perfectly willing to leave the Turks and the Greeks to right out their quar
rels by themselves, so lone as the other Balkan states are not involved in it. There
fore, unless the GreeK agitators can succeed In inducing the Macedonians, Albanians
and Servians to assist them in attacking Turkey, the war will orobably be confined
wholly to the two nations already engaged, and will not be long continued nor of
much effect upon the commercial and industrial interests of the rest of the world. Its
chief result will be politicul. It wiil bs another step made in the direction of a final
settlement of the long-vexed Turkish problem, and can hardly fail to hasten the
coming of the end of the Ottoman empire in Europe.
THE LOS ANGELES FIESTA.
The Los Angeles fleÂ«ta has now become
one of the notable features of California
life, and serves to attract annually a large
number of visitors to the State. It has
not yet become so noted as the carnival at
New Orleans, but is rapidly approaching
a close rivalry with that great festival and
promises within a few years to surpass it
in magnitude, in brilliancy and in popu
larity.
An occasion of this kind, which serves
so well to advance the welfare of the State,
is a matter of no little importance. It is
something more than a pleasant pastime
and a week's frolic. It takes the nature
of a ceremony, serving as an education in
artistic development and in the art of life.
It makes known throughout the world the
geniality of our climate, the profusion of
our flowers, the wealth and culture of our
people and the open-doored hospitality of
our homes. It gives to California a repute
and a prestige among the States of the
Union, which add to its attiactiveness to
all who have strongly developed social in
stincts and the means to exercise them.
It serves, therefore, to promote the gen
eral interests of the community, and de
serves a liberal patronage from all parts
of the State.
The fiesta this year has a particular I
claim on the people of San Francisco, !
from the fact that when a carnival in this I
City was talked of some of the leading |
men in Los Angeles arranged to bring i
large excursions from Sout crn California !
to take part in it. That the intention was '
not fulfilled is due In nowise to Loi An- i
geles. The kindness which prompted it
and the State patriotism manifested in it ';
remain as obligations for us to iepay.
We should fulfill to Los Aneeles that
which her people promised to us. Our j
society should show itself there, and add
what it can to the beauty and the gayety
of the festival. We should help the enter
prising people of the south to make their
display worthy of a National reputation , ,
being well assured that all the benefit to j
be derived from it will not be confined to j
that portion of the commouwealth, t.ut
that we, in common with the rest of Cali- i
fornia, w.li reap a portion of it as well as
of the pleasure which the fiesta will afford |
to all who witness its beauty and take
part in its eayeties.
EASTWARD EMIGRATION.
In a recent interview with George Alfred
Townsend Senator Allison stated that the
tendency of immigration from lowa is
now eastward instead of westward. Young
men who leave that State to seek homes
go to Chicago instetd of going further
west, as they did in former years. In fact,
as he said, the reflpx wave which General
Sherman prophesied has begun and immi
gration is now rolling eastward.
In giving an explanation for this course
on tt c part of the youne men of lowa the
Senator is quoted as saying:
"They formerly went to Dakota, Colo
rado and beyond the Rocky Mountains.
Many of them saved or convcrte-1 their
farms and homes into money and went
to J*os Angeles or to Seatile or elsewhere,
and they almost all lo^t their money.
When I talked to you in this room fi teen
or twenty years ago the young lawyers
were moving to Dakota, to Yankton, to
Nebraska; they are returning and settling
to the east of the Missouri."
That this statement is accurate cannot
be questioned. Senator Allison is an able
and trained observer of the social condi
tions and tendencies of the people of his
section of the Union and speaks as an
established authority. Nor can it be
doubted that he is right in the reasons he
has given for the changed courso of em -
gration. Neither is it difficult to under
stand the situation and realize exac ly
how the cause has produced its effect.
Among the thousands of young men
from the East who come to the Pacific
Coast and the greater West generally there
were many who found profitable employ
ment, made successful ventures and set
tled themselves permanently in the new
land. Those who failed returned home.
The effect of this on pubic opinion in the
older States might have been calculated
from the start. The successful settlers in
the West were far away from their old
homes and were soon forgotten. The un
successful ones were at home, continually
talking to their friends and neighbors,
and each one by a natural impulse en
deavored to account for his failure by de
nouncing the land, the cities and the
States in which the failure occurred. As
a natural result the better features, ad
vantages and inducements of the greater
West were lost sight of, while its draw
backs and its defects were incessantly re
peated and magnified in the ears of the
people.
It will take the Pacific Coast some time
to overcome the evil effscts of the bygone
booms. That it will ultimately do so,
however, cannoi be doubted. We must,
however, expect to see our progress in the
future laid upon lines materially different
from those on which progress has been
conducted in the past. The drift of
American population now is toward cities.
The factory draws better than the larm.
The workshop is more attractive than the
town lot. The people wish employment
and tend to those centers where employ
meat is most likely to be found. The
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 20, 1897.
wave of emigration will turn westward
again as soon as we develop on the Pacific
Coast a diversified industry. The reflex
movement toward the East can hardly be
more than a recoil of the wave. It is as
true to-day as it was yesterday that "the
star of empire westward holds its way."
WALL STREET OPINIONS.
The financial editor of the New York
Timrs recently summed up the conditions
of the stock market in that city by say
ing: "Wall street tries to be hopeful,
wants to be confident, but is nervous.
Hesitancy is the chief of current security
mark?t characteristics. Bad features dis
closed get more attention than develop
ments which are encouragine."
The uncertainty of the situation and
the existence of this nervous feeling led
the writer to a study ot the subject in
order to determine how far the feeling is
well founded. In making- this study he
did not confine himself to his own obser
vations, or draw his conclusions solely by
his own reasoning, but sought interviews
with men prominent in financial circles
and obtained from them opinions which
confirmed his own idea that the depression
in Wail street is due more to a pessimistic
condition of mind than to anything in the
actual situation oi affairs.
Ex-Governor Roswe 11 P. Flower is quoted
as taking a hopeful view of the situation
and anticipates an upward movement of
the stock market in the near future. He
is quoted as sayine: "In the whole situa
tion there is nothing of any very grave
nature â nothing which even appears to be
a lasting Darrier to business improvement.
It is true there are at present a number of
adverse factors, but none of them are of
any lasting importance or are of sufficient
maenitude to be placed among the real
underlying conditions."
James H. Benedict, one of the veteran
and cool-headed observers of Wall street,
whose experience has extended through
many years and whose interests have
been continually large, is not only hope
ful but confident. "Wall street," he said,
"has for some time past been drifting into
a state of professional pessimism. It has
been fashionable to be scared. In worry
ing over discouraging features we hnve
formed a habit of ignoring what is good â
tremendously and dominantly goodâ in
the balance-sheet."
The conclusion of Mr. Benedict, as stated
by himself, is: "Not one fair-minded
man who lakes up the subject reasonably
and is moderate and intelligent in his
calculations can fail to ge: any other re
sult from investigating National condi
tions than a result which will induce con
fidence, and even enthusiasm."
There can bs no question that the finan
cial, industrial and commercial classes in
the United States are affected more or
less by the uncertainty which prevails as
to the result of the tariff legislation now
under way at Washington. Until the
tariff bill has been enacted, and it is
definitely known what duties are to be
imposed upon Imported articles, capital
will hesitate about entering upon any new
ventures. This seems to be the main ob
stacle In the way of an immediate revival
of business. Fortunately that obstacle
will soon be removed. Leaden of Con
gress are sanguine that the bill will be
adopted not later than the middle of June,
and then the natural forces of the country
which are already tending toward im
proved conditions will have full scope to
work out their results and re-establisD a
general prosperity throughout the coun
try.

AMERICAN VEET fcUGAR.
Bnte to Supplant the Foreign Product
and Mm*m Million*.
St. I.ouls Globe-Demo- rat.
A payment of about $100,000,000 annually
to foreign countries for a product adapted to
our own soil and climate is plainly, an indus
trial error. Within Â»he last ten years atten
tion has been directed to this wasteful method
of conducting business, and signs are multi
plying that the proper remedies will be ap
plied. Last year. every "pound of wheat and
flour exported was required to, pay for the
sugar imported. Our exports 01 cotton were
only double the value of the sugar imported.
The value of till exports of live and dressed
beef, beef . products ana lard just â¢ about i bal
anced that of the sucar bought abroad. It Is
now Known beyond question that the sugar
beet can be grown, in many of our States and
of a quality unsurpassed - where. Sugar
cane also is -adapted" to a larger area in this
country than is â¢ generally supposed Â» but

time iigo Germany proposed to gradually ex
wnguisn the sugar bounty, but the popular
pressure against this step has been too strong
to be resisted. The German export bounty on
sugar is i early half a cent a pound, and France

Keep even. Supplying sugar to tiie world must
oe a profitable business. Our own averaee
rasa payment for foreign >ugar of about $274,
-000 every day in the year is proof enough tnat
mere is n great deal of money iv it from one
customer alone. This stream of treasure
should be diverted to our own farmers and

Heavy exporter of sugar

ana iÂ»yÂ« increased from 500 tons to 40,000
Jons. Tiiis is not much, but it is a beginning,
one important point to be kept In mind is
tnat *n American consumes two or three times
as much sugar as a German or Frenchman.
Sugar Here is considered a necessity, not a
luxury, and our abundant and varied*crops of
fruit require its free us:-. The culture of the
sugar beet will be quickly mastered by our
larmer*. It is an intensive form of horticul
ture. Slipshod methods on large areas will
not answer in this case, but for that matter
they are not successful with any crop. Some
thing of the high farming of the market gar

profitable and our farmers are looking for har

the sugar-beet factories will return good divi

"THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL."
Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest.
Old English Money Law.
Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: It is a fond delusion perhaps to suppose that
readers of The Call make allowance for extreme condensation of statement, which restricted
space necessitates, but where two columns would be requisite for a full consideration when I
discuss certain financial problems. In the present instance, for example, it would require a
full column ot' the unall type In which my contributions to The Call appear to report the
celebrated case of "Mixed Moneys," decided during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, in 1601. as
reported by Sir John Davies, and yet I shall attampt to state the chief ieatures of the case and
the poin'.s raised and decided by the highest judicial authority of England, for that decision
stands to-day as the law of tne British empire alter the lapse 0f'296 years.
In the quaint style of ihat day, Sir John Davies thus status the case: "Queen Elizabeth, in
orac r to pay the royal army, which was maintained in this kingdom (Ireland) several years to
suppress the rebellion oi Tyrone, caused a great quantity of mixed money, wiih the usual
stamp of the arms of the crown and inscription of her royal title, to be coin'a in the Tower of
London, and transmitted this money into mis kingdom, with a proclamation bearing date 24
May, in the 43 1 year of her reign, by "Mcli Her Majesty declared and established this mixed
1 money, immediately r.fier the said proclamation, to be the lawful and current money of the
kineuom of Ireland, and expressly commanded that this money should De used, accepted and
reputed by all her subjects, and others, using any trafflck or commerce within this kingdom, as
lawful money: and that if any person or persons should refuse to receive this mixed money,
according to tne denomination or valuation thereof, viz., shillings for shillings, sixpenny pieces
for sixpenny pieces, etc., being tendered for payment of any wages, fees, stipends, debts, etc.,
they should be punished as contemners of her royal prerogative and commandment."
Here I must break into the report of Sir John to ask special consideration by gold standard
men to the succeeding sentence, immediately following, without a break, the last words of the
foregoing paragraph: "And to the intent that this mixed money [something worse tnan
silver in our day] should I aye the better course pnd circulation, it was lurther declared by
the same proclamation that after the 10th day cf June [or seventeen days after the date of
proclamation] immediately following, ail other money which had been current within this
kingdom beiore the said proclamation shojila be cr ed down and annulled and esteemed as
bullion, and not as lawful and current money of this kingdom ." Silver advocates did not ask
in the lute campaign to have gold "cried nown" and "esteemed as bullion."
Now conies the case Gilbert against Brett under this law, which is thu9 reported by Sir
John: "la April, before the proclamation was published, when the pure coin of England was
current within this kingdom, [Ireland] one Brett ot Drogheda, merchant, having bought cer
tain wares of one Gilbert in London, became bound to the said Gilbert in an ol ligntion of Â£200
on condition that he should pay 'o the said Gi.bert. his executors or assigns Â£100 steninÂ»
current and lawful money of England, [a sort t f United States gold coin contract] at the tomb
of i.n:\ Strongbow in Christ Churcn, Dublin, at a certain dny to come; at which day and place
Brett made a tender of Â£100 in the mixed money of the new standard, in performance of the
obligation," which was reiused, and then followed the suit to test the validity of the new law
The issue, as stated by Sir John, was "whether this tender wiis sufficient to save the for
feiture of the obligation, or whether the said Brett should now, noon the change or alteration
of money within this kingdom, be compelled to pay the said Â£100 iv other or better coin than
the mixed money according to the rate or valuation of it at tne time of the tender which was
the question at the Council table, wnere the said Gilbert, who was a merchant of London, ex
hibited his petition against the said Brett for the speedy recovery of his debt aforesaid And
inasmuch as this case related to the kingdom in general and was also of great importance in
consideration and reason of state Sir George Carew, then Lord Deputy and also Treasurer re
quirad the chief Judges (being of the Privy Council) to confer ou and consider this caso and
return to him" their decision.
The decision of "the Chief Judges" has come down to us, as repor ed by Plr John Davies. in
these words: "Upon conference and consideration on all the points of the said proclamation
the Judges resolved that the tender of the one hundred pound in the mixed money at the day
and place aforesaid, was good and sufficient in law to save the forfeiture of ihe said obligation,
and that the said Brett should not be obliged at any time after to pay other money in dis> har?e
of the debt than this m xed money, according to the rate and valuation that it had at the time
of the tender; ana this resolution [decision] was certified by them to the Lord Deputy end the
certificate entered in the council Look "
Jn the Ueht of this oecislon, upholding the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth and the ex
ercise of her royal prerogative in demonetizing the "pure coins" of the realm and ratatitattng
the debased or "mixed money" in Â»heir place and making them full legai tender for all dues
and debts, brushing aside specific contracts as legal cobwebs, when the welfare of t lie country
was at stake and seining these issues for the last 298 years in England, what shall we say of
tne tremendous unroar made by the goldbugs of our times over the proposal to restore silver
to its old place under the constitution and require the issuance of ail paper raonev by trie
Government alone, as the fantastic demands ot crazy repudiationists? While these cod
men so lavishly prais-e the financial system of England they must accept this "mixed money"
decision with it.
Sir John follows his report nbove cited with these words: "And in this case divers points
were considered and resolved" or decided, which he reports to the number of six including
Â«e verm subdivisions. These six "points" of law, still in force in England, must be re-erved
for another time, for they are vastly important to us to-day in the study of the viral issue now
demanding national decision. JOSEPH ASBURY JOHNSON

Baking
Powders
Analyzed
" Royal," a cream of
tartar powder of
superior purity
and strength.
The following extracts from
Certificates of analyses of the
Royal Baking Powder, made
from time to time, are very help-
ful to those who wish to be cer-
tain as to what baking powder
to select in order to get a pure
article, free from alum or any
form of adulteration.
Your committee have made a
very careful examination of the
Royal Baking Powder, and are
satisfied that it fulfils all the re-
quirements which the public can
make of a baking powder. For
purity and care in preparation it
equals any in the market, and
our test shows that it has greater
leavening power than any other
of which we have any knowledge.
W. B. RISING,
Prof. Chemistry, University of California,
State Analyst.
By analyses which I person-
ally have had made, it is clearly r
demonstrated and proven that
the Royal Baking Powder is
pure and wholesome, and that
it stands, as far as strength and
purity are concerned, at the head
of the baking powders of the
United States. The Royal is
composed of absolutely pure,
harmless and wholesome ingre-
dients of the highest grade and
character. v'^TL. vsy- 1 !
/GRANVILLE McGOWAN, M. D.
Health Officer, Los Angeles.
The best baking powder made
is, as shown by analysis, the
Royal. Its leavening strength
has been found superior to other
baking powders, and, as far as I
know, it is the only powder which
will raise large bread perfectly.
CYRUS EDSON, M.D.,
Com'r of Health, N. Y. City.
Chicago, March 1, 1887.
As the result of my tests, I
find the Royal Baking Powder
superior to all the others in every
respect It is entirely free from
all adulteration and unwhole-
some impurity, and in baking it
gives off a greater volume of
leavening gas than any other
powder. It is therefore not only
the purest, but also the strongest
powder with which I am ac-
quainted.
WALTER S. HAINES, M. D.,
Prof, ef Chemistry, Rush Medical CclUgt,
Consulting Chemist,
Chicago Board of Health.
I have analyzed all the prin-
cipal brands of baking powder
sold in this State. Royal has
the highest leavening power,
and is composed of pure â  and
wholesome ; ingredients. No
other gave results so satisfactory.
FLOYD DAVIS, ;
lowa State Chemist.
I have made a large number
of analyses of Royal Baking
Powder, and have found it to
be an absolutely pure cream of '
tartar powder, entirely free from
ammonia and all adulterations

THE LAST OF A
FAMOUS CLIPPER
She Was Once a Warship
and Then a Merchant
man.
Commodore Vaocbrbilt Built Her
at a Cost of a Mil
lion.
When She Sailed Through the Golden
Gate She Was Known as tte
Three Brothers-
The old-time clipper Three Brothers
has come to her last notch. At one time
a warship, then one of the largest and
fastest clippers in the American mercan
tile marine, she was finally sold to an
English firm and passed under tne English
flag. Months ago she outgrew her nseful-
ness and is now serving as a coal bulk for
the English Government at Malta.
When the civil war was raging and the
Alabama wa* creating havoc among the
Federal merchantmen the big vessel was
built and equipped by Commodore Van
derbilt at an expenditure of $1,000,00.)
and turned over as a present to the Gov
ernment. At that time she was a side
wiieeler and did rood service. When the
i Merrimac was being built in the South
, and the Monitor in the North a proposal
was made to the Secretary of the Navy to
i send three warships South to make a com
bined rush at the Merrimac and attempt
to turn her over. One of the men-of-war
designated was the Vanderbiit, but before
the atteniDt could be made the Monitor
w.-.s built and ready to meet her rival.
After the war the Vauderbiit was sold
to Ueorge Howes & Brothers of this City
for $42,000. They tGok the machinery out
and sold it for more than they paid for
the steamer, and taking off her paddles
made her into a three-ma9ted ship, nam
ing her the Three Brothers, after George.
Henry and Jab?z Howes. Her first trip
out of the Golden Gate was in October,
1573, and Captain Cummincs was in com
mand. Her cargo consisted of over 5000
tons of wheat, aud every vessel in port
! was decorated in honor of her departure.
W. A. Coulter, the marine artist, made a
magnificent picture of the scene, and it
now decorates the walls of the Merchants 1
Exchange. Mr. Coulter followed the
Three Brothers to sea on a tug, and the
accompanying cut is from a sketch he
made just after the vessel got under way.
The Three Brothers was in the Cali
fornia trade for quite a time, and on every
i trip she made the run in less than 100
days. Then she was sold to an English
rirm, and now she is rotting to pieces as a
coal hulk in the service of the English
navy.
Captain George Cummings, who com-
I manded the Three, Brothers all of the time
I that she carried the American flag, now
I lives at East Oakland.
"She was built by Commodore Vander
-1 bilt ior a yacht," said the veteran captain,
"and then Vanderbiit attempted to secure
the carrying of the mail between Nstt
York and Liverpool. In this he was de
feated by the Collins line. He then set up
an opposition line to Havre.
"When the war broke out in 1861 Van
derbiit presented the Three Brothers to
the United States Government. She was
fitted out as a privateer to capture the
Alabama, and how I wish she had caught
, the latter, l was then the captain of the
I Youns America aud the Alabama over-
I hauled us in the Strait of Sunda. After
â  putting our crew to sea in small boats they
burned her. My wi:e and two-year-old
! son were with me on tha| trip.
"After the war the Three Brothers was
docked in New York, calked, overhauled,
metaled and sent around the Horn to San
Francisco. She lay at Mare Islana six
! years, and the only work she had to do in
; that time was to take Queen Emma to the
1 islands.
"In 1870 she was sold to George Howe
& Co., and fitted as a sailing vessel at an
1 enormous expense. I was in Liverpool at
the time he purchased her, and left the
Young America to come to Son Francisco
and superintend the refitting of her.
"In October, 1873, we sailed for Havre
with a cargo of wheat, Mr. Howe accom
panying us. The voyage was mÂ«dÂ« in 10S
j days. Mr. Howe remained in Europe
I when I returned to New York with the
j vessel. On arriving there weinviied Com
-1 modore Vanderbiit to visit his old yacht,
but he was unable iv do so. One of the
boys and he*r builder, with one or two
others, took lunch with us, however.
"The Three Brothers never made any
remarkably quick time nor had any acci
dents whatever. I owned one-sixteenth
of her with Howe, but I am glad it was
no more for we lost on every voyage. We
were offered Â£4 10s and refuned it in
; Liverpool and afterward accepted Â£3 Is.
: Lawlor'B Asenry told us that he was
ready to offer Â£4 15s. but he knew it was
useless. She carried 10,000 yards of sail.
"In 187U she was sold in Liverpool at
auction for a mere trifle, virtually given
* away. She is now a coal hulk at Gibral
tar, the strongest old vessel ever built I
had a four-master model of her made and
raffled it off for $2UOO. A man named Mid- I
dleton, holding twenty-two chances, took
i the prize. He .-old it to Macdonough,
who in turn gave it to the Golden Gate
Park Museum. It will pay any one to
take a look at it."
Captain Cummings has a Inrce ;.ainting
of the Three Brothers l>y Walters of
Liverpool, for which he paid $250, hanging
in his residence. No visitor calls wituoat
admiring the vessel as well as the work of
art.
ARRIVAL OF THE ORIZABA.
Captain yon Helms Says There Are
No Chancres Along the Mex
ican Coast.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Orizaba arrived from Mexican ports
yesterday. Captain yon Helms says there
is no truth in the reports about Mount
Orizaba being in eruption, nor were there
any changes in the harbors or coast line,
except at Altata. At the latter point tue
bar had silted up, but the river Culiacan
had forced a fresh entrance, and the only
difficulty was that a pilot bad to be em
ployed and a detour made in order to
reach the town-hip. On the new bar there
is a depth of four fathoms.
Near'y forty Japanese bound for Mex
ico were taken from tbe steamer Gaelic
and put aboard the City of Para yesterday.
They are bound for tbe new colony and
evidently expect trouble. Each Jap is
armed with a sword and revolver and
thirty Winchesters are to follow them.
I hey are ex-soldieri and are bound to
show tight if interfered with. Another
contingent now on the City of Peking will
follow them.
Another bucket fell from the Dunsmuir
coal bunkers yesterday. On this occasion
no one was hurt ana the only loss was a
ton of coal.
The British ship Howth, Captain Mar
tin, arrived yesterday after r. fair passage.

HUNTINGTON LEFT
FOR THE GAP
Will Inspect the Proposed
Route of the Coast
Line.
May Order Work to Begin
Short. y Alter His Return
From the Trip.
Great Advantages in Time and Oper
ating Ezp nsrs Expected
10 Result.
Within the next week President Hunt
in;;ton of the Southern Pacific Company
will probabiy decide when the worK of
clo-ing the gap on the coast division be
tween Surf and Eilwood is to begin. He
left yesterday morning for a trip of in
spection of the country which is to be
opened up by the oroposed extension, and
will be gone about a week. He is accom
panied by 11. Â£. Huntington.
The distance thai remains to be bu It on
t ins line in order to make it a through
route to Los Angeles is about sixty miles.
It will be one of the most expensive
pieces of railroad construction for the dis
tance in the State, and it is this fact that
has prevented the company from com
pleting the line earlier. Among other
t!nn:s, it will require no less than twenty
seven iron bridges across the numerous
gulches that, abound in that section, and
the wort will consist very largely of cut
ting and filling, always more or lets ex
pensive in railroad construction.
It is estimated that the cost of building
the link of sixty miles will be between
$2,500,000 and |3,c00,000, or between $40,000
and $00,000 a mile, while the average cost
of railroad building on level ground is
%bout $20,000 a mile.
But despite this heavy cost of construc
tion, the enterprise wiU Le a profitable
one to the comnany, lor the reason that it
will greatly shorten the time between San
Francisco and Los Angeles and all points
south, though it will not lessen the actual
distance between San Francisco and Los
Angeles. It is 482 miles over the South
ern Pacific Kailroud from this City to the
metropolis of the southern part of the
State, and by the proposed coast line it
will be 488, or six miles more.
The greut advantage of the route via
San Luis Obispoand Sinta Barbara lies in
the absence of any steep grades. Their
presence on the regular Southern Pacific
Railroad greatly tiffecti tee time that is
made on the road, and thereby increases
the cost of operation. At the present
time it tafces the Southern Pacific over
land train about twenty-two and a half
hours to make the trip from this City to
Lob Anj?eleÂ«. When this train goes yiu
Santa Barbara the time will not exceed
seventeen hours, thus saving five hours;
and the same economy in time will be
abown on the Los Angeles express, which
now makes the run in twenty and a half
hours.
The point most largely benefited by
the new order of things when it is insti
tuted will be Santa Barbara. The short
est time between that point and Ban Fran
cisco is now about twenty-three and a half
hours, whicu, when the gap is dosed and
trains are run through to Santa Barbara
from San ; Francisco, will be reduced to
thirteen hours, or to nearly half the time.
I Should â¢ Mr. Han tington - decide ' favora
bly on the proposition of beginning work
on the Rap, it is possible to close it and
have trains in operation over it by tne Ist
of October, His decision will probably be
made known shortly after his return to
this City. __ _____ _______ \- :

REMEMBERED THE
DAY OF LEXINGTON
Exercises by the Sons of
the American Revo
lution.
Horace Davis and J. R. Robinson,
Sen of a Revolutionary Sol
dier, Made Addresses
The Lidijs of Sequoia Chapter Cee
brate With an Elaborate
Barquet
The Sons of the American Revolution
last night celebrated the anniversary of
the battie of L?xington in a manner so
enthusiastic as to put the younger genera
tion to the blush.
The society hÂ»ld a brief business session
and vo'.e d to present a United States flag
to the children oi the Ladies' Relief and
Proteciion Society. The society voted
also to parade on Memorial day, May 30,
as the guests of George H. Thomas Post,
O. A. EL
John R. Robinson, General S. W. Backus
and I mac Upham were ap pointed a com
mittee to act with the committee ap
pointed by the Board of Supervisors to
make arrangements for the celebration of
the coming Fourth of July.
Hurace Davis nia'ie un address in honor
of the occasion. Tersely and graphically
he described the raid of General Gage and
ils repulse by the loyal colonist?, includ
ing the brave and patriotic volunteers
trom historic Lexington.
The paper of the evening was by Colonel
A. I). Cutler. It was read by Jo^n R.
Robinson, and very appropriate was the
selection of the reader, for Mr. Robinson
is a son of a Kevolutionary toldier and is
82 years and 9 months old. His readinc
was marked by lorce and expression and
he was frequently interrupted trith, ap
plause.
Speaking of the Puritans Colonel Cutler
said in his paper:
The game spirit of intolerance and obstinacy
that is now common to New England people
distinguished them then, mid was doubtle&R
the ioundation cf much of '.heir trouble. They
inherited it, however, irom the mother coun
try. If George 111 had granted them the free
Use of ten and revenue stamps we might be
now peaceful subjects of Mrs. iiuelDh, wearing
our trousers turned up at all times without
criticism, and marrying our daughters to
princelings and dulcelets with Impunity. As
it was the King allowed the treedistilla.ionof
rum, to which may be aitiibuted much of our
Puritan success with the aboridne. Wh.le it
may be agreed with John t.lioit, ''o that you
had converted some before you had :.lain
any," it is nevertheless true that most of the
grim old Puritans had more liking lor an In
dian dead thau alive and couverud. Anyhow
the pan Ira book, rum bottle aDd gun went
along togetherâ a trinity of forces that ulti
mately sett>ed boih tne Indians and New Eng
tand.
Of the glory of modern Lexington the
paper speaks of follows:
In 1821 her committee of six reported a sys
tem of Staie schools thÂ«t was finally adopted
by the Legislature of Massachusetts and has
been practically in force to the present time,
and ou which has been patterned most of the
school systems of the Middle, Western and Pa
cific States. The first normal school was es
tablished there In 1837, and therefrom and
on the same general basis has sprung atl u.e
normal scnouin of the coun try.
The steam railroad came to the town in
1840, gas in the seventies, and public water
works and electricity in due time. To-day she
i* a beautiful oid town, quiet and restful,
moved to her deepest depths only occasionaily
by quarterly town meetings, where the accu
mulated local grievances are ventilated tail
sought to a finish.

(1) he doesn't know that you really
want the other kind ; ;

(3) he makes more money on cheap

DISASTROUS DAY
FOR FAVOURITES
All of the Short- Priced
Ones Bowled Over
at Ingleside.
Rosormonde Beaten Out for the
Corrigan Stake by
Michael.
Joe Figgott Successful in Two Close
Finishesâ Tim Murphy Won
at Odds at 20 to 1.
Ingleside track reopened yesterday for
its final meeting o! this racing season, and
the result was mo-t disastrous for favored
ones in the betting. While no really
"good things" were sent through, one or
two of the winners were quite extensively
played. Itwashopei that Pet Dunne's
Good Times, which went to ,the post at
evens for the final race, might save the day
for the favorites, but the big lumbering
colt developed about as much speed as a
Kansas grasshopper with one leg in
splints.
The card was a very ordinary one, and
the attendance scarcely up to the average.
S'Xteen pencilers marked up odds in the
ring and were never be?ieged with "rafts
of coin." The weather was cool and the
track good, but not fast.
The Corrigan stake for two-vearolds, at
five furlongs, saw ten racy-looking youne
etars appear with the colors up. It was
a handicap affair, and Rosormonde, wiln
Clawson and 102 pounds in the saddle,
wa? a pronounced favorite In the betting,
goin^ to the post Bto 5. Away first, Claw-
Bon made a wide turn into the stretch,
with the aristocratic miss, allowing
M.cnael. with Coadv up. to come through
ou the rail, and in a hard drive found hira
seif beaten out half a length in l:01?Â£
Front de Boeaf, with Willie Martin to do
the piloting, run a Buri>r:singiy good race,
finishing third, Japped on thp two 'eaders.
The winner, which packed 116)4 pounds,
is a sturdy-looking chestnut coit. by imp.
Islington from Jessie C. dam of the speedy
Circe. He is owned by \V. M. Murry of
Sacramento, and has shown great game
ness in all of his races.
Lady Diamond, the 6 to 5 favorite for
the opening seven-furlong purse affair,
displayed about as much speed as a tin
can rolling up hill and finished beyond
first and second money. Turning into the
stretch, the 10 to 1 shot Manchester, rid
den by Hennessy, drew away from his
company and won with ease from the 30 to
1 outsider, blue Bell.
White & Clarke turned the six-fnrlong
selling sprint that followed over with
their old roan veteran, Tim Murr>hy. The
ring laid 15 to 1 against the old fellow and
always at the saddle-girth of Perhaps he
downed that geiding a nose on the wire in
I:lssÂ£. Third money went to Mollie R.
Lizz.e H, who receded from 8 to 5 to 13 to
5, finished well up at the end.
The fourth race, run over a mile and a
sixteenth, decided under selling condi
tions, resulted in the overthrow of the hot
3 to 5 favorite Rev del Tierra, ridden by
Clawson. The youngste- managed to get
a clear head down the back^tretch and
turned into the straight for home with
his mount looking a winner. At the fur
long pole both San Marco and The Bache
lor drew up on the leaiier and soon had
him in trouble. Simmered down to a
.rive between the two last-named horses,
Piggott, on The Bachelor, uutimi-hed
Isoru and cot i is horse over the line a
long no^e before Pnn Marco in 1:50 flat.
The winner was 6 to 1 in the books
throughout the betting.
Refugee was played down from threes
to 5 to 2 to win the six-furlong sprint that
came next, but came out stiff and sore and
ended up third. Caliente, aga;nst which
9 to 2 was laid, won in a drive by one

Good start. Won driving. Winner, E. J. Baldwin* b. g,, by
lime,
length, with Marjorie snatching the place
from tne favorite.
Good Times either was minus or did not
wish to extend himself in the concluding
mile run, and brought up a bad third. In
a punishing drive Piggott, on Bernardillo,
led Lode Star out by a short head in
I:43}*.
KOTKS.
Walter J did not appear to be unusually
fractious while at the po*t in the Emery
ville races, and it might not be out of the
way for Ingleside to accept his entry. His
owner is not wealthy, but should be given
a chance to earn bread and buiter, never
theless.
Jim Neil came very near landing a good
bet with Perhaps, and the brown gelding
was one of the really "live ones" which
started in the second race.
Mike Hennessy iv seen to good advan
tage in the saddle these days. He piloted
two winners in vrry clever fashion yester
day, and Burns & Water house evidently
made no mistake when they signed the
veteran. ' Â L
Joe Pipgoit seems to have regained his
old winning form.. In a close decision
Joe's number is usually hoisted on the top.
Pat Murphy was Jouled the last hundred
yards by Oaliente, but Slaughter pulled
the roan horse up so hard the la<-t few
jumps that he failed to finish among the
rirst three. Had he been second. Slaugh
ter's claim of foul aeainst the winner
would probably have been sustained.

SHOW WINDOWS
TO BE CURTAILED
Must Not Be Extended
Over the Public
Sidewalks.
Mayor Phelan Vetoes a Permit
acd Expresses His Ideas
on the Matter.
Hall of Justice Progressing â Gates
May Be Ordered lor Rail
road Crossings-
Mayor Phelan has decided that the
time to check the narrowing of the eide
walks of the City by allowing shopkeepers
to extend their show-windows over the
same has come, and Ho intends to make a
determined crusade against the granting
of any more permits.
He started the ball rolling yesterday at
the meeting of t c Board of Supervisors
by vetoing resolution No. 1622, granting
J. L. Haskell permission to extend his
show-windows twelve inches over the
sidewalk at 1118 and 1120 Marfcet street.
The message reads as follows:
Such special privileges have been heretofore
granted by ihe Beard of Supervisors at the re
, quesi of property-owners, and thus become
j not special privileges, but a general privilege,
because if you grant the i.rivileee to one
there is no good reason why it should Le re
\ fused to another. The evil has grown by rea
son of the fact that oue property-owner ex
tends his show-window over the sidewalk,
thus compelling his neighbor to do the fame,
; and so on progressively until all the show
windows are prÂ»jected.
It the privilege was not granted in the first
: instance, every property-owner would be com*
polled to occupy Ins own land. He could pro
duce the same effect on his own line by mak
ing embrasures instead of projections, and the
public would not be the sufferers. As it is
now, one foot is taken < ff the sidewalk and
given to the property-owner, thus narrowing
the channel over whiih people pre compelled
to pass, inconveniencing ami crowding them
into the roadway. Such au absorption of the
sidewalk is certainly in derogation of the
rights of the citiz-u io its free Riid lull use.
General order 15St> oi the Board ot Super
visor limits the u>e of the public sidewalk for
private purposes to the privilege of gaining
access to one's property, as by a basement
entrance, but the projection of a snow-win
dow is not made for any necessary purpose
and Is clearly an encroachment upon the pub
lic stieet.
The owners of property, furthermore, are
short-'-lghted in thus reducing the width of
the sidewalk on business thoroughfares, be
cause so crowded do they become ou certain
days and evenings ot the week, and on occa
sions oi umisual gathering*, that not o ly are
the public inconvenienced but customers are
driven away t> reason of the compact bodies
of people moving in one direction or another
over Â»c diminished sidewalk.
My eriticiMii applies to the principal thor
oughtares rather than to the outlying dis
trict*, where, however, the same principle is
involved, but not the same necessity lor im
mediate action.
T.ese special privileges are revocable by the
board, and where they become conspicuous
nuisances it may be necessary !or your honor
able body io revoke some of the privileges
already grunted; but inasmuch as projecting
show-windows have been almost invariably
pui in o.d structurt-x. it may be ihat the con
struction ol new buil anus in the near iuture
will remedy the ev:l, and to this end such
special pr;v. leges should hereafter be denied.
Respectfully, Jamks I). Phelan. Mayor.
Supervisor Rottanzi offered a resolution
that was referred to the Street Commit
tee providing that individuals, companies
or corporations operating streetcar tracks
in this City must pave the space between
the rails ana the poriion wh.ch by law
they are cumre led to fceeD in order *ith
the same c arac.er of pavement that is
used in the remainder of the street, except
for ei;;ht inches on each side of the track*,
which may t.e paved with Oasa.t blocks.
The Committee on Public Buildings re
ported that the architect and Superintend
ent of Construction of tne Hall of Justice
had reported that a larger force ol men
tban formerly was at worlt on the build
ing, but that the work could be pushed
more rapidly. The committee al-o re-
ported that the building must be con
structed with the tame variety of stone
that is being used in the new ferry build
ing, and that the sub-contract to furnish
the stone had been let to I. Â£5. Delano of
the Rocklin Marble Company.
Bateman Brothers have been notified
that the present morgue building will be
vacated in about two week*, and that as
the temporary quarters have been rented
for six mon;h.-i every effort should be
made to erect tie new building within
that time.
A communication was received from the
Richmond District Improvement Associa
tion asking that the Sutro Railroad Com
pany be compelled to run iti cars within
the limit of speed required by the muni
cipal ordinance*. The petition was signed
by George 11. Fletcher, president oi the or
ganization, and stated that tue cars of the
company were run so fast as to endanger
the live-, not only of those pationizing the
line but ".hose compelled to use crossings
over wtiich it passes. The recent accident
in which a number of j>ersorÃ were in
jured was attributed to the speed of the
cars.
A resolution was adopted transferring
$3000 from the funds of tlie Almshouse to
those of the City and County riospittd in
order to prevent a shortage in the re
sources of the latter institution. The
funds of the hospital were overdrawn
when the present board went into office,
and since then a sewer system costing
$4000 has been paid for out of the funds,
leaving them in a bad shape unless re
plenished in Kome-manner.
A resolution permitting the South San
Francisco Gun Club to conduct trar*-Â«uoot
ine on a tract of land owned by Thomas
Funning, half a mile inside the County
line, two miles from the Mission road, was
passed to print.
Supervisor Clinton offered a resolution
that was referred to the Street Committee
directing the Southern Pacific Company
to erect gates where its tracks cross pub
lic streets at the following locations:
King and Fourth streets, Townseod and
Fourth streets, Townsend and Fifth streets
Townsend and Eighth Btreejfc Harrison and
Eighth streets. Harrison ana Twenty-Brut
streets, Valencia and Twenty-fifth streets, Illi
nois and Nnpa streets, ord SÂ»u Jose road and
Circular avwnue, Ocean House road and
Southern Pacific Rai.road crossing, old San
Jose road and Plymouth avenue.
In support of his resolution the Super
visor slated that he had asked the Super
intendent of Streets for the locations of
the railroad crossings ot this, City and had
received a lift of .fony-four. The ones
mentioned were classed as dangerous. Dr.
Clinton stated that it was necessary for
the preservation of human life to imve
gales at the crossings mentioned, and
that the absence of such barriers had
already cost several people their lives.
D strict Attorney Barnes sent in a com
munication stating that the services of
Attorney J. J. Dunne, whose appointment
as special counsel and demand for services
were vetoed by the Mayor, are necessary
for the proper conduct of ms office.

VARICOCELE.
THIS VERY COMMON AILMENT IS POSl-
tively cured by a treatment original with
Doctor Sweany, which -ati:.cki the seat of
the disease aud restores a healthfol condition-
to the veins and nerves, thus eunbiing them
by their contraction to give a proper circula-
tion of the blood through the vuins, thereby
Kradually^reaucing their swollen condition.
The pain disappears, they return to their
original healthy condition and appearance,
and a varico-e condition cannot continue, re-
turn or form after you have once been properly
cured by his treatment, which does not inter-
lere with any rpgulÃr habits or employment,
and may be used without knowledge or sus-
picion of any other person.
Snfferers from this disease, the time to cure
it is when it first manifesto itself. Neglected,
varicocele soon assumes a condition where
nothing short of an operation will avail. It
is therefore important that these cases re-
ceive early attention. Describe your case
fully and Dr. Sweany will tell you candidly
whether or not you cÂ»u be cured without an
operation.

FOOD COFFEE.
Americans and Their Money.
A late issue of the farmers' Union has
an editorial upon "Ciffee and Its Effect
on Health ant Public Interest." The
paper strongly urees upon the notice of its
readers the fact th.it America is draiued
of m.ilions of dollars annually to send to
foreign countries for a product that is one
of the prime causes of the increase in
nervous diseases in America to-day, and
states that a well informed physician on
stomach and nerve ailments has, after a
year's experiment, produced a delicious
beverage from American cereals, wheat,
etc., which has the exact color of high-
grade Java coffee and turns to the rich
golden brown of Mocha when cream is
added.
It is said to be less acrid and bitter than
the lower gradc-s of coffee, but has much
the mellow piquancy of the more expen-
sive crades of Java and the Arabian berry.
This grain beverage never produces the
unpleasant effect on heart or stomacb ana
liver that is all too frequently the case
with imported coff Â»c, and while it looks
and tastos like coffee the originator ex-
presses the wish that it be known as Pos-
tum Cereal, a food drink, and not as an
imitation of any other beverage â coffee,
tea, chocolate, etc. Tbe beverage is said
to become very popular with those who
find ii hard to digest coffee, and the chil-
dren can be served with ii as a liquid food,
pure and nourishing, while to them
it appears like berry coffee. Postum, it
seems, will go about three times as far as
30-cent coffee, and it is interesting to
know that the company at Battle Creek,
Mich., is working up quantitiea of wheat
and otHer American cereal? in its produc-
tion, and that the money thus expended
goes directly to the support of our Ameri-
can farmers. It is said to have found
great lavor with the wealthy classes for its
ab lity to "make red blood," and with
those who count the cost oi food because
of the economy and a marked improve-
ment in general health when used. The
gain to Am â¢ rica by its general adoption
should be great.
There is but or:e genuine original Pos-
tum Cereal coffee, with a multitude of im-
tations offereu as "just as good."

FAIR CASE
Actual Proceedings in the
Trial Now Under
Way.
MANY OF THE TALESMEN
CHALLENGED.
Some Were Prejudiced, While
Others Were Too
Willing.
BOTH SIDES WITHHOLD THEIR
SELECTIONS.
A Grand Array of Legal Talent in
Court, A ! l Alert end Primed
for Battle.
The trial of what is doubtless the chief
issue in the great struggle over the mil
lions left by the late ez-Senator James G.
Fairâ the issue involving Mrs. Nettie
< ravens' interests in the vast estate â began
before Superior Judge black yesterday
morning, with the important preliminary
work of the impaneling of a jury.
Judge Slack had moved his quarters
a^ain, using this time the courtroom of
Department 8, instead of his own, which
is now in the hands of a force of workmen.
It is understood, however, that as soon as
convenient, he will again hold his sessions
in the Supervisors' commodious chambers.
There was an immense attendance at
yesterday's session, indicating that the
public has lost none of its interest in this
celebrat-d contest.
The number of the attorneys retained
to represent the several interests involved
is so great they occupied the major por
tion of the space inside the railing, leav
ing little room there for visitors. Mrs.
Craven, accompanied by her daughter,
Margaret, was on hand early, and took a
seat immediately in front of tne jury-box
along with her legal champions, D. M.
Delma?, W. W. Foote, Judge Denson and
Mr. Brittain. ISome distance back from
tnese notable? were arrayed the attorneys
for the Fair children and attorneys repre
senting other interests involved, ail of
whom have combined to fight Mrs. Cra
ven's claims. Amone these were: Messrs.
Pierson, Knight, McEnerney, Mitchell,
Heggertv, Lloyd and Wheeler.
The particular issue that the jury now
being selected is to hear was the first
matter referred to when Judge Slack took
his seat yesterday morning and court had
been formally declared to be in session.
it was through a question asked by Mr.
I>elmas. That gentleman wanted the
court to elucidate on the pointâ that is, to
kDOw just what sort of a showing they
were supDOsed to make in court.
Judge Slack said he had thought that a
matter already understood.
"Your Honor's decision that we should
try the equitable i-sues is clear enough to
us," said Mr. Delmas, "but what we
would like to know now is just what issue
is to be tried. We want to know if vre are
to try the complaint of Miss Vir.inia Fair
in intervention as well as the other
issues."
"Not except bo far as the equitable
issues herein contained are concerned,"
replied the c^urt.
All hands then joined in the discussion
and it was finally settled by me court di
recting that the case be proceeded -with.
Twelve taletmen were then placed in
the jury-box, and Mr. Pierson ad<lre3sed
thÂ«m. He said the case before them arose
upon an equitable issue 10 a cross com- j
plaint in ejectment. The property in
volved comprised a piece upon the corner
oi Pine and Sansome streets and another
on the corner of Twelfth and Mission
s'reets, both of which were claimed by
Mrs. Craven under deeds of gift from the
tat â¢ Senator Fair. It was tne validity of
these deeds, he said, that was being dii
puted.
Mr. Pierson was about to bee in the ex- !
nniination of jurors when Mr. Delmas in- !
terrupted with the announcement that to I
bis side belonged the ai'irmaiive â that he
had the right to open and close. This pre
cipitated a short argument, which ended
in a ruling from the bencu against Mr.
Delmns' position.
ri. Borkheim was the rirtt member of
the panel examined as to his qualifica
>;ons to terve as a juror. In response to
Mr. Pier-ou's inquiries be proclaimed
himself to be a lair-minded man, and
thought be could try this case nicely.
Then Mr. Foote took hold of him, and
found out that Mr. Borkheim had exhib
ited suilicient interest in the Fair case to
a:iend n.e preliminary examination of
NoiarvJ. J. Cooriey. He declared, how
ever, that it was only curiosity thut look
him there, and that what h*- heard had
influenced him in no way at all.
Being Dressed on another proposition
the talesman acknowledged that he was
not pood at reading other oeople's hand
writing, but if taken aa a juror tie would
"do the best he could" when it came to
passine upon tbe disputed deeds.
Mr. Foote made short work of the gen
tleman when he handed nira a photo
graphic copy of the deeds held by Mrs.
Craven and asked him to read them.
Borkheim struggled with them manfully,
but had to give it up as a bad job. He
could not read them at all, so he was ex
cused by both sides by mutual consent.
At this juncture the court took the cus
tomary noon recess.
B. F. Garratt, the foundryman, was
taken in hand by Mr. Pierson when court
reconvened for the afternoon session, and
promptly gave it out that he was not
qualified to serve as a good juror.
He sa;d he had found himself greatly
interested in the romantic story of Sena
tor Fair's life and death and the struggle
for h s millions. He c.ad read nearly
everything printed in the newspapers
about the case and had expressed gome
very emphatic opinions botu at home and
at the foundry.
"Was that opinion such that evidence
would be required to remove it?" asked
Mr. Pierson. "
"I think so, as I still retain that opin
ion," replied the talesman.
Mr. Foote asked Mr. Garratt a few
questions, but they were of the pur
lunctory sort, as he was satisfied that the
foundryman would not do. Mr. Garratt
was challenged and Judge Slack sent him
away.
Rudolph Samson, an importer of Japan
ese goods, said in response to Mr. Tier
son's long string of questions that he
knew none of the parties connected with
the case. When Mr. Foote tooK hold of
him he confessed readily that he hud
formed an opinion so strong that he could
not rid himself of it, and therefore could
not be a:i impartial juror.
Mr. Foote's challenge had the effect of
severing the talesman from further con
nection with the trial.
Kichard C. Matteson, a Larkin-street
grocer, couldn't say that ho knew any
body concerned in the great case, and told
Mr. Footr he had read very little about
Senator Fair's estate â in fast, had not
botnercd himself about it at all and did
not want to. Naturally, then, he was
wholly unprejudiced and said he guessed
he would ruaKe a good juror. He knew of
no reason why he shouldn't. He had
never expressed an opinion about the Fair
case, neither had he ever heard anybody
express one.
There was nothing to do but to pass Mr.
Matteson. Unless he meets with a
peremptory challenge from either side he
will serve as one of the twelve wise men
who will finally pa3s upon the evidence.
H. B. Burlingame's responses to Mr.
Pierson's queries were affirmative only in
two instances. He had met Mrs. Craven
some lour years ago, when his son was a
pupil at her school, and was also ac
quainted with one of the gentlemen men
tioned by Mr. Pierson. To Mr. Foote he
! said he had read considerable about the
I case, but was quite sure he had not
I formed any definite opinion as to the
i merits cf any of the claim*, cor had he
ever expre>ted himself on the subject.
| He, too, was passed.
William A. Brown had read a good d-al
! about the case and had talked with people
I who professed to Know something about
it. Upon this he had formed an opinion
j that he was surs disqualified him from
| serving. No umount of questioning on
| the part of Mr. Pierson would gei him to
I say tuat he could cast his opinion aside,
so he was challenged by that attorney
! and was excused.
; â  The examination of Louis J. O'Farrell
elicited the information that he could
j boast of no particular acquaintanceship
j with any of the people interested m the
I litigation. He knew some of the attor
, neya and litigants by sig^it only. But he
had read a good deal about tue d.velop
ment of the case and the trial of J. J.
Cooney, bin had not formed any clear-cut
â  opinion. Mr. O'Farreli thought he would
j make a fair, unbiased juror.
Mr. Foote had a few important ques
tions to ask the talesman, and wneu he
did he found out that tbe law firm of
â¢ Knight & Heggertv had transacted busi
ness lor his brother, J. J. O'Farrell, the
: real estate dealer, who not long since
1 went into bankrupty. The talesman was
working lor his brother at that time. He
! declared, however, that personally he hai
! never had any dealings of consequence
i with the attorneys mentioned and was
certain he had never discussed the Fair
case with them. He also admitted an ac
quaintanceship with Attorney Heller, but
had not talked with him cither. Mr.
i O'Farreil w<is passed.
i Harrie C. Biggs of the California Ma
i chine Company had read all about the
case, and nad formed an opinion that it
would take very strong evidence to sbake.
He was promptly challenged and allowed
to return to his busine-s.
For similar reasons Patrick Boland was
Leading Characters of the Opening Day of the Great Fair Trial.

excused. He did not believe he could rid
himself of the opinion he had formed.
Owen McHugh was another who-e mind
was in such a condition that he would not
do for a juror.
Sigmund Shoenberg, who deals in
tailors' iindings, had an opinion, too,
based upon what he had read and heard,
but it was not so pronounced and tixea
that evidence ruignt not change it. The
attorneys for the Fair children were anx
ious to retain Mr. Siioenberg on the panel,
and foucht against Mr. Foote's challenge.
The court decided, however, that the
talesman had clearly shown himself to be I
biased and allowed ihe challenge.
One of the most interesting examina
tions of the afternoon was that of S. G.
Hoag, a publisher of periodicals. Mr.
Hoae knew most of the attorneys in the
caseâ some by sight and others personal
ly â and also knew Judge Cooney. He
met the latter at a Republican meeting
during Hie last campaign.
"Do you know Mr. Dei mas, too?" asked
Mr. Pierson.
"(>h yes, quite well."
"How Ion;;''"
"Oh, ever since I met him at that cele
brated Stockton convention."
Mr. Foote inaugurated the good-natured
laugh that followed this remark and Mr.
Delmas joined in, too.
"Wore you a delegate to that conven
tion ?" asked Mr. Pierson.
"No, but 1 was pretty close in."
Mr. Hoag acknowledged frankly that he
i had kept wll posted on the Fair case by
| readiiiE the newspapers. He had formed
opinions, too, but they were so varying in
their nature that he scarcely knew where
| he stood at present.
"You see," he said, "I would read an
article one day and have an opinion or
impression until I would read something
else, and then 1 would have another. That
is the way it has been with ma right
along."
"Well, how do you stand now?" asked
Mr. Foote, smilingly.
"Give it up," replied Mr. Hoag, with a
hopeless shrug of his shoulders.
Both sides seemed to lite this talesman
andhe was passed without a challenge.
William Z. Tiffany, who is employed in
the auditing department of the Southern
Pacific Company, said he had conceived
quite an opinion and thought evidence
would be required to remove it. But the
attorneys on both sides rather fancied
Mr. Tiffany's appearances and passed him
for later consideration.
James P. Ford, a plumber, seemed to
fill the bill as regards the freedom of his
mind from prejudice, and was not too
well acquainted with the attorneys on
either side nor with any of the parties
vitally concerned in the outcome ot the
trial. He, too, was passed.
Levi Lasky, who said he owned exten
sive mining proiertias in Inyo County,
ciaimed he knew very little about the
Fair case. This was becau>e his inability
to bee well prevented him from reading
much in the papers. In answer to Mr.
Foote'i- questions, however, he said he did
not- think this would interfere with his
ability to servi.- as a juror. He tboueht he
could make a critical examination of any
documents that might be submitted to the
jury.
Mr. Foote jarred the miner by asKing
him point blank if it was not a fact that
he was anxious to get on ths jury.
Lasky sputtered for a moment and then
admitted that he was like Barkis in that
respect â he was willin'.
"Do you know what is meant by a pre
ponderance of evidence?" asked Mr. Foote.
"Oh yes, of course." replied Lasky.
"Well, what is it?"
The talesman got into a fearful mudd Ie
: and the spectators laughed uproariously
I at nis discomfiture. Judge Slack put an
; end to the would-be juror's misery by dis
missin.' him peremptorily.
isaacS. Rosenbauru, an insurance agent,
' coniessed to an acquaintance with Mrs.
j Craven, which had been formed through
, the artendance of one of his daughters at
â  her school. It was Hot a very intimate
! acquaintance, however. Besides Dr. Marc
j Leving ton and Attorney Foote he knew
; none of the people connected with the
'. case. He had read a good deal abo.it the
Fair estate compl cations, hut had formed
j absolutely no lasunc opinion. He thought
; he could try the case fairly and give an
impartial verdict, ao he was passed by
both sides.
The examination of If. J. Harrigan re
sulted in his being passed. He said he
| did not know any of the people in the
case. He had read what the newspapers
had printed about the Cooney case, but
had not formed any opinion.
This ended the proceedings for the day
and tbe examination uf talesmen will go
on again this morning.

Judge J. C. B. Hebbard. The room was

the community to go through with a long
and in some respects a vexatious trial.
He thought it was within the sound dis- j
cretion of the court to hear the objections ;
to the indictment in order to save the
public treasury from an unnecessary bur
| den.
Attorney Juiins Kahn, on behalf of the
prosecution, insisted that the defendant
j bad made the offer of a demurrer too late.
j He urged a trial en the ismes framed.
JudgÂ«* Dain^erfieid sided with the attor
neys for the prosecntion. He said, how
ever, that if the District Attorney is
doubtful in regard to the soundness of the
indictment now is the time for him to
speak.
District Attorney Barnes responded tbat
Prominent Figures at the "Jt'tsA of Editor Marriott in Judge
Daingerfield's Court.
he drew the indictment and felt great con
fidence in it.
Mr. Shortridge asked if there was not a
point in the indictment which caused him
to pause and doubt.
After a slight hesitation Mr. Barnes
said he supposed counsel referred to the
question as to whether the editorial in
question is really hbelous per se.
Attorney. Kahn made a brief reply, and
the court overruled the defendant's mo
tion.
The names of the jurors in the box were
then read as follows: Charles W. Welch, |
Thomas G. Taylor, R. H. Woods. Cuarles j
, Kane, Adam Wazner, John C. Anderson, |
A. If. Lawyer, Henry Klindt, James F,
, Doriand, K. Gampitz, John J. Engler.
District Attoruey Barnes read the indict
! ment, wbiefa sets forth the fact that last
October Mr. Marriott pubii-hed in his
paper, the ban Francisco News Letter, an
I editorial, of which the following is a copy :
A WORTHY .IfDr.F. FOKSn. iTIt!
In another part of tne News Letter appears
i an article signed by a committee oi thu Peo-
I pie's Home Savings Bank depositors, showing !
I adequate causj why Judge Hebbard should '
i not be re-elected. Tue statements made in i
: this terrible document will cause every honest
man to shrink from voting for a creature who
is therein clearly jirovcn to be an enemy of j
numerous widows and orphans, and morally |
liable for the loss of their little savings. Is j
, that the sort of a man to re-elect Judge? Not '
| fo. ln;elligent men will learn well the lesson j
| that article teaches, and will see to it that he
I is removed from tne liigh position he dis
. Braces. If tools are io be elected to the Judi- ;
car , the honest men had better get out of i
; the City. But it will be more natural for us to
relegate the tools to tho oblivion they so richly
I merit.
The publication of this article, Mr.
Barnes explained, could not in any event
be regarded as anything more serious
than a misdemeanor. If it could be shown
that the publication was unjustifiable in a
legal way then a conviction of misde
meanor wouid be asked for by the prose
cution.
The article referred to as having ap
peared -'in another part of the News Let
ter" was issued by authority of the com- !
mittee uf the People's Home Savings |
Bank and read as follows:
AN APPEAL TO VOTEHF".
Your attention is called to the fact that an
unfair and therefore unfit personâ J. C. B.
Htbbardâ solicits your ballot lor the position
! of Superior Jud<reat the approaching election.
: NSe cannot longer remain silent, since a &en-
I national paper has repeatedly misrepresented
lacts during the past lew weeks, by stating
that opposition to Hebbard came from persons
who wanted to loot the People's Home Savings
B>nk, when the truth is that those who object I
to him are the unfortunate depositors, who I
suffered by the looting.
Briefly, the truth is as follows: In May, 1894,
depositors in the Insolvent People's Home Sav
ings Bank organized und appointed a eom
miitee to look after their interests. Their fiist
efforts were directed toward securing a satis
factory board of directors. The exisiiug board
had been prohibited from meeting for any
purpose whatever by Judae Hebbard. Tne
committee secured the promise of a majority
of the board to resign. Judge Hebbard agreed '
that they might meet for the purpose 01 re- i
signing. The next day the Judge had changed ,
his mind. Why? Bet-nuse the men oi charac- I
ter se.ected by the depositors f' r the vacancies !
were not satisfactory to Hebbard's bosom
friend, the notorious James Aiva Watt, who de
sired to be tlie attorney nnd real manager of '
the bank. The appointment of a receiver fol- |
lowed. Any fair-minded man would suppose '
that when the savings of thousands of
widows and orphans were being dissi
ptted. an upright judge would apcoini I
a corporation of trust nnd responsibility, |
or a man of probity and ability to look
after their interests. Wuut did llebbard do?'
He appointed as receiver an incompetent, irre- I
sponsihlc political parasite, In the person of
John F. Sheenan.so that his friend Watt be
came the Httorncy and act.ye manager of the
bant. This action of Hebbard was overruled
by the Supreme Court, when he immediately
reappointtd Shechan on another similar ap
plication.
During the seven months following Watt so
manjp ila;ed ailnirsasto secure control of a
majority of the bank's stock, when Hebbard |
graciously dischnrges the' receiver and his |
bondsmen without a proper accounting to the j
court. A board of directors selected by Watt '
was then elected, aud Shechan nnd WÂ«tt con
tinued in office as manager and attorney re
spectively, tuiu a blanket resolution passed
by the board approving the acts of
the receiver. During the eisht months
of the illegal receivership the sum oi $42,
--995 41 was disbursed. Receiver Sheenau and
Attorney Wati each appropriated hs his salary
the sum oi $500 per month. In addition large
sums were squandered in lees and junketing
trips. No less an authority thnn the Attorney-
General of the if:ate hits declared that tlie re
ceiver wns not lega-ly entitled to one cent of
compensation for such services.
In view of these facts the severnl thousand
depositors in the People's Home Savings Bank
believe that Judge Heboard more than any

San Francisco, October 16, 189 G.
This was indorsed in large types with
the Jenend : "What the representatives of
the swindled depositors of the People's
J Home Savings Bank think of J. C. B.
I Hebbard. Substantial reasons why be
j should not be re-elected Superior Court
Judge of the City and County of San
Francisco."
Charles S. Welch waa the first talesman
submitted to examination as to his quali
fication to act as a juror. Mr. Barnes was
anxious to know if Mr. Welch knew Mr.
Hiiortriilge or C. B. Darwin or William
Beatty, who are associated in the case for
; the defendant.
Being reassured on that important point
Mr. Kahti ;>â  Ke<l the gentleman what he
', uioutrht about me privilege of a candidate
for office to be protected against adverse
criticism by the public press. Mr. Welch |
j said he thought writers ought to be given j
â  some latitude. He believed in the free- :
| dom of the press in a general way, but
. thought that there should be no license
I granted to publish outrageous statements.
Mr. Shortridge took nenriy au hour to
! ascertain tbe feeling of Mr. Welch in re
j gard :o libel cases in general, and particu- !
l lariy whether he thought that candidates
; for positions on the bench of the Superior
j Court shoul.l be treated more reverently
man candidates for any other office.
This special inquiry was objected to by
Mr. Kahn, and was ruled out.
Again Mr. Shortridge inquired whether
the proposed juror believed that any di
vinity hedges about a Juiijre. When an
objection was made to this Judge Dainger
field smiled and intimated that he would
like to know the gentleman's views on
that question, so it was drawn out that
Mr. Welch thinks that all citizens and
candidates outrtit to be treated substan
tially alike. He could not subscribe to
the theory that there is any divinity that
should protecc a Judee from criticism.
He ought to be passed on by voters just
as other mortals are weighed and con*ii
ere<l when ihey are candidates for office.
"If a litigant should think that he has
been treated unfairly Dya Judee, and that
the decision has been prejudicial to his
interests, do you think in such a case a
litigant nas a right to criticize the Jud_;e
verbally or in publication?" asked Air.
Sbortr dee.
No objection was made t.o this inquiry,
and the gentleman gave it as his idea that
a litigant ou^ht to b â  permitted to make
such criticism, within the bounds oi rea
son, bui it was impossible to get him to
define the limit of such boundary.
So the inquiry proceeded in a sprightly
manner throughout the day.
In the afternoon Deputy District Attor
ney Walter Hinttle appeared to assist in
the prosecution, taking his seat beside
Judge Hebbard, who occupied a place at
the labie reserved for the attorneys for the
urosecution, and took notes of questions
and answer?, occasionally offering words
of rounsei and advice to ihe lawyers.
"Do you know Alvinza Hayw;ird,;James
Cross, administrator of the Hooart estate.
T. H. McCarthy, E. F. Kendal , Thomas
8. Williams Jr. and the oiher persons
who were indicted on a charge of libeling
Judge Hebbard?" was one of Mr. Kahn s
stereotyped questions.
On the other hand Mr. Shortridge want
ed to know if Attorney W. T. Baggett,
"who was mixed up in some kuni ot a
Haie & Norcross litigation," was known to
the prospective juror. Following this up
the same question was asKed in regard to
Attorney H. \V. Hutton, Attorney Henry
E High ton, Attorney James Alva Watt,
General John F. Sheenan, Colonel Georee
Stone, ex-City Counselor John A. Durs'.
ex-Attorney-Generai W. H. H. Hart, W.
M. Fox, Attorney Henry Eickhoff and
half a dozen more gentlemen, who were
by inference joined in the number of
those who are seeking to press the prose
cution in this case.
Incidentally It was developed that
jurors hold to the opinion that news
papers have a rizht and ought to be
privileged to criticize can lidates for posi
tions on the judtciul bench.
Ten jurors were examined and passed
for future consideration and action by
counsel. Proceedings will be resumed at
10 o'clock this morning.

decline in 1 razil Coffee in New York appears to
have been checked, temporarily at least, on the
14th inst when No. 7 spo; Hloi reacted from itie
lowest quoted price of 714 c and sustained an ad
vance of '/2 C l " a days. The effect nere has been to
impart some variable feeling of confidence In the
situation as a whole, but more directly calling the
I attention of buyers to the relative cheapness of
I >alvadors, which have through a com tuna. lon of
I circumstances followed the general <!â¢< line of Cof
i fee more closely than any other variety. While
no actual advance has occurred in this description,
all offerings to be had 011 the basis ot the existing
auotatlon of 12Va c were taken yesterday and to
day to the extent of nearly IOjU bags. At the
close the market is firmly held at 12yjc, but wltu

of <>uaiemalus and Costa Klcas than lias been

ginning of the depression have prices for these

Oakland Orru R San ?rancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 19. j
Captain Harvey Williams of the Oak
land Cycline Club is preparing a petition
to the Western Cycling League asking
that colored cycling clubs be given recog
nition on this coast.
For more than tlireo years Captain Wil
liams has been engaged in trying to brim;
about this move. Before the split in the
Rational Association his efforts were
treated with indifference and his petition
â¢was voted clown. Now, however, that the

coast wheelmen have shown that they
wi.'l act independently when occasion
'arises the coiored cyclists think the time
appropriate for renewing the prosecution
of their wort.
The question of admitting the colored
wheelmen into the league has received
additional interest because of the passage
by the Legislature of the new civil rights
bill. The attempt of a man named Potts
to demand recognition fr m a barber Is
condemned by leading Afro-Americans,
who declare that it interferes with their
work while seeking legitimate recogni
tion.
"We have had great difficulty in trying
to obtain recognition from the larjje
leagues," said Captain Williams to-day.
"Our work has been preatly Hindered by
fuch carrying-on as that of a man named
Potts, whose rir;ht name, by the way, is
Pott. We coioreit people who claim to be
intelligent have uo sympathy whatever
with such work. Among ourselves we
will not recognize everybody, and it is but
natural that white people should do the
same. We do not want to obtrude our
pelves where we are not wanted, and, on
the other band, we do not want to be
Blighted.
"It seems to be the prevailing im
pression that if we are admitted to the
Coast League we shall remand the
right to enter in all their races, and tv
make it possible for us to do just what
this fellow Potts nas done. This is not
Â«>ur motive nor our desire. There are sev
eral colored cyclist clubs on the coast, and
many o! them hold good records. At the
present time we nave no recognition what
ever and our events are not recorded
What we ask is that the Coast League
shall recognize our standing as clubland
that our records be preserve I, and alÂ«o
that it will be necessary for us to obtair
permits to hold race*, with the sanciion of
the league. This, it seems to me, is only
* reasonable demand. The coast cyclists
have already seceded from the National
League, because of the prohibiting of Sun
day racing, and we wish tney would go
nne step more ahead of the National
League and grant us the recognition we
DBk."

"PROMOTED TO GLORY"
Mrs. Sergeant-Major Brown Ends
Life's Battle at an
Early Age.
While on Salvation Army Duty She
Contracted a Co d Which De
veloped Consumption.
Oakland Office Ban Fbaxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, ADril 19. f
Mrs. Addie Brown, wifo of Sergeant-
Major Brown of the Salvation Army, was,
in the language of her comrades, "pro
moted to glory" this morning.
For more than a month the (jeatli of
Sister Brown has been hourly expected,
but with a remarkable vitality she has
been able to stave off the final moment.
Fidelity to duty was the cause of her
early death.
IfcTwo years ago while conducting meet
ings at Haywards Mrs. Brown contracted
a cold, which developed into consump
tion. Savers! months ago a trip East was
undertaken for the purpose of trying to
restore her health, hut the^relief was only
temporary and on her return she com
menced to decline.
The deceased was not yet 32 years of
oge and has been an active and earnest
worker in the army for nearly a dozen
years. She leaves a husband and two
children â one a boy of 8, the other a little
girl but little over a year o <i.
Soon after the army commenced woric
in this city Servant-Major and Mrs.
Brown joined the rank?, and they have
never swerved in their allegiarce to Its
ring. Mr. Brown is the man who origin
ated the army work at San Quen tin which
has Mnce attained such marked success
and popularity.
To-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock at the
aimy barracks, where the deceased sister
was well known as a pianist and singer,
funeral services will be conducted by the
officers.

yuÂ« Broadway, April 19. f
A brand-new plan of advertising th s
county is being considered by those hav
ing in charge the entertainment of the
Christian Endeavor delegates at the com
ing convention.
Ex-Councilman W. E. Barnard and J.
C. Bullock, a leading member of the Wast
Oakland Improvement Club, are of the
opinion thai the greatest benefit that can
be derived by the presence of so many
Eastern people I. ere is to take them into
Aiameda County homes and entertain
them during their stay.
Next Friday night the celebration com
mittee will meet and the plan will be con
sidered. It is as follows: To canvass the
city of Oakland and surrounding towns
for the purro-e of finding out how many
citizens will entertain free one delegate
for ihe week from the 7th to the 14ih of
July. Thi^, it i? urged, will not be a
hardship (in any one and cannot fail to
create a permanent impression of this
county ou the visitors.
It is cv.Mi proposed to provide the dele
gates with ferry tickets so tUat they will
be able to cross to this side of the bay and
enjoy a whole week at little or no expense
to themselves.
At the next meeting of the West Oak
land Improvement flub the raalter will
aiso be brought up. Tnat club ha* been
doing very efficient work of late especially
in the matter of causing the objection
â blÂ« Wen Oakland marsh to be trans
formed into a public pane, and its mem
bers are sanguine concerning anything
that will ;end to build up their end *oi the
city.
Laree quantities of the book entitled
"Furts and Figures of Alaraeda County,"
10,000 copies of which were purchased by
the Supervisors for gratutious distribu
tion, have been forwarded to Christian
Endeavor centers in the East, 38 it is con
sidered that this will pave the way for the
dtlegates to receive a permanent favor
able impression of this side of the bay.
The book is beautifully illustrated and
finely printed and is entirely devoid of
advertising matter. The distribution is
now being conducted by the Merchants'
Exchange.

THAT ATHLETIC ROW.
The Stanford Statements Have
Aroused Much Indig
nation.
Their Position Slated 07 the Track
Captain ani Manager of the
Berke'ey TV am
BERKELEY, Cal.. April 19.â A final
statement of California's position in the
controversy with Stanfor t has been made
t>y Track Captain Brown and Manager
Barnes, reviewing the points at issue
from the commencement of the discus
sion. Before compilation of the state
ment, a meeting of ail the athletes was
Held in North Hall, with Professor Ed
ward C. Bacon.
It was decided that the men should
keep In training until Wednesday even
ing, to be ready if Stanford should agree
to arbitrate the points -it issue. It was
also settled that Berkeley will not send a
team East. The professors thought It
beneath the dignity of a great university
to follow the cardinal men across the
Rockies for an athletic cunteit.
A great deal of bitterness has been
aroused by some remarks from Palo Alto
reflecting upon the motives of the Berke
ley athletic management As the latter
has only asked for arbitration and stands
ready to abide by the decision of nn
bias*d judge*, such remarks are indic
nantly received and are regarded as un
cai.ed lor. By way of reply some of the
more hotheaded collegians aver that
Manager Brown of Palo Alto by avoiding
a contest with Berkeley is escaping from
the embarrassing prospect of aending to
compete on Eastern fields a team de
feated at home.
Followine is the statement of the case
by the Berkeley manager and captain :
The manager and captain of the truck team
of the University Club firstly, finally and
briefly, herewith give to the public the rea
sons for the failure to have an intercollegiate
field day :
The track manngers of the two teams failed
to agree upon two points: first, the time and
place of hsviug the bicycle race; second the
manner of scoring the points.
It seemed impossible to come to an agree
men. so the University of California manaeer
deslrcrtto have the questions at Issue settled
by arbitration. The managers of the two
teams, together with the chairmen of the two
laculty committees on Intercollegiate ath
leiics, met at the University Club.
Negotiations came to naught because the
manager of the Stanford team flatly refused
to allow the questions to be arbitrated Thero
upon the manager and chairman of the fat
uity committee of California declared that
without arbitration tliero could be no contest
The California team will remain in training
until Wednesday evening, April 21. which is
the latest date when any reconsideration may
be had. Iv no event will the contest take
place unless the matters at Issue are arbl
tr&t6G.
l'be reasons for the stand taken by Cali
fornia areas follows:
Firstâ ln iho matter of the bicycle race
Both managers agreed to have this race on the
Velodrome track, but Stanford's manaeor
wanted It on the same afternoon aa the Held
day, whi.e the California manager wanted to
nave Jton the afternoon before, aa an adver
tltement and matter of convenience, and of
fered to pay all the extra expen-es of thÂ«
Stanford men. Failing to agree Stanford with
drew its consent to the Velodrome track and
insisted that it be held on .he O.vmpic cinder
track. The Olympic track has bl-en found to
be exceeiingly dangerous for fast ridine
Secondâ As to the mmter of scoring" Tha
agreement between California and Stanford
provide* that the rules of the Amateur Ath
lotic Union of the L'nited States shall irovern
all contests. The ruk-i at the time of the adon
tl u on Â°i w li Â»c â¢Kf/ement prescribed that scoring
should be five for first, three for second and
one for third place.
At the meeting of the two lntercollcÃiate
commiiu-es in February last, which conned
of three represiMiiatives from each university
tne matter Â«.l scoring was britfly tonsiderei
and four of the Â»ix members declared in iavor
of five, tlirce and one. The matter was not
put to a vote, iiowever, because it was t^oueht
that the r le of the A. A. U. covered tne
point At h last two field dyg the captains
agreed to fl\Â», two and one and did so without
any authority. At previous field days the
scoring had been five, three, one .
The manager of the California team, not
finding provision lor scoring in the rules of
the A. A. U.. telegraphed 10 Mr. McMillan
president of the union, and received the fol
lowing reply: . ...â

ALAMEDA, Cal, April 19.â Anotb-r
indication of the trend of improvement in
tnis ci'y toward the west is furnished by
the proposition of the Presbyterian
church to seek another site. At present
it is located at the corner of Versailles and
Central avenues, where it has been for
years. When the building was erected
there it was deemed probable that the
center of population would remain in
that portion of the city for year.-. But it
proved differently, and the steady trend
has been westward until now it has be
come nlmost imperative that a- move
ehoulfi be made by the church in order to
accommodate the greatest number of at
tendants. Several pieces of property have
been examined and options taken. As
soon as the present site can be sold a new
building wiil be undertaken. It is ex
pected tbat a structure of suitable size can
be erected for about $20,000, but nothing
will be done until a sale is made.

Miss Emma May Loring is not jet quite

thing had occurred â yet, anything â than
that. I suspected this on Saturday. It is
not tbe first time my girl has don* this

is my thanks."
Mr?. Loring stated that on October 11,

Samuel K. Hassinger, one of the oldest
pioneers of the State, who died somewhat

Mr. Hassinger located in Stockton for a

which proved very profitable. In 1857 he
was elected Justice of the Peace of that
town, and five years later he went to San
Franc'sco and opened business as a con
tractor, coming to this side of tne bay in
1&67, since which time he has permanently
resided in this city.
Seventy-one years ago he was born in
Newark, Del., and on bis father's farm
passed the first twenty-three years of his
life. Some members of his family still
reside theie, but on this coast no one sur
vives him but his wife, who has been for a
few years in an insane asylum.
Every politician in Oakland knows Sam
Hassinger. He has been an active Re
publican worker since the party was or
ganized, and has never shown aiiy desire
to be rewarded with office. He on one oc
casion was induced to accept the position
of saniiary commissioner of the Health
Office, but afier eighteen months he re
signed and never again took office.
Since the separation from his wife on
account of her mental derangement Mr.
llaÂ«Mnger has been very moody and has
taken but little interest in public affairs.
He married when comparatively young,
and for the whole of a Jong life their do
mestic affairs were always smooth and
na rP7i a nd the enforced estrangement
contributed to bis death.
In this city he has built many large
blocks, the most prominent being the Ma
sonic Temple, Irom which ha will be
buried on Wednesday afternoon, having
long been a member of that body. Some
years ago he was possessed of considera
able realty, but recently it ha; slipped
through his fingers, and now he is net
known to own anything but a moderate
bank account.
The dpcased has no children, and his
closest friend, Peter Baker, does not think
he has left any will. This, however, is of
minor importance, as, after the payment
of his funeral expenses, there will be only
a small sum left to be used for the bentnt
of the widow.

Van Patten Nonsuited.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 19.â The suit
brought by H. B. Van Patten apainst sev
oral prominent members of the Brooklyn
Presoyterian Church for fa.se imprison
ment came to a sudden end to-nipht.
Van Patten was Dut on the stand and
was a very poor witness in hia
own beijalf. When the prosecution closed
a motion for nonsuit was made by Attor
ney H. A. Melvin for the defence.
,Slr. Melvin stated that it was very plain
tne defendants had acted from upright
and pure inui.ve-. He argued that the
plaintiff was manifestly not doing right
by bis children, and the defendants
simply did what any true men and women
would do.
Judge Greene took the same view and
quickly granted th<Â» nonsuit.

Charles Hellmnn Come* From St. Louis
to Secure a Vindication.
Charles Hellman arrived from St. Louis
Mo., yesterday morning, and went iml
mediately to police headquarters, where
he surrendered himself, as two warrants
charging him with perjury were out for
his arrest.
The warrants were r.worn to in Judge
Low's cour 1 , on February IG, by John
Pearson, 516 Precita avenue. It was al
leged that iiellman in swearing before
Charles H. Phillips, a notary public, on
December 24 last, that the allegations in
a complaint for divorce from his wile, on
the ground of willful desertion, were true,
committed perjury. The allegation on
which the charge is based is tnat for over
a year prior to the tiling of the complaint
he and his wife had not been living to
gether, whereas in fact they had been liv-
I ing together up to one month prior to the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 20, 1897.
filing of the complaint.
The second charge is for testifying to
the same effect before F. W. Lawlor, a
Court Commissioner of the Superior
Court, in the suit for divorce on Jan
uary 12.
Hellman was taken before Judge Low,
and told the Judge that he came to Cali
fornia last year and obtained a divorce
from his wif<>. At the time tie owned a
lot here which he sold for $500 an-i gave
t*ie money to his divorced wife. As soon
as he gained the decree be returned to St.
Louis, and as soon as he heard there were
warrants out for his arrest he came here to
vindicaie himself". The Judge released
him on his own recognizance.
AID FOR THE AVENUE.
Albert Gerbantlng'H Spirited Speech to
the Produce Exchange and
the Response.
Albert Gerberding, president of the
Produce Exchange, called his fellow mem
bers to order at 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, and addressed them in a style that
excited their enthusiasm in favor of the
Balboa avenue enterprise. The speech
was magnetic and instantly effective. He
appreciated the anxiety of members to
reach May and December options, but de
sired to direct a thought to the 'men who
were in the December of life and seeking
for employment. He knew that the by
laws of the exchange did not countenance
the expenditure of exchange money with
out due notice at the meeting, but he ap
pealed to the sense of generosity and pub
lic spirit of individual members for con
tributions to the avenue fund. He men
tioned that John McCord, a fellow mem
ber, was superintendent of the work, and
that the City was getting five dollars of
benefit /or every dollar expended. More
money was needed at once to advance the
work.
The president's remarks elicited so
much enthusiasm that Moses Blum
headed the gifts to the avenue fund with a
contribution of $2;?. Others followed so
rapidly that they were tumbling over one
another to get recognition from the chair.
Carey Friedlander, the secretary, had all
he could do to keep up with the pace of
responses.
The following subscriptions to the fund
were recorded :

When the crowd heard the announce
ment oi $100 from the Port Costa mills
there was an instant shout of approval.
Henry Crocker was â¢ cheered when his
contribution of $50 was announced.
A motion was made that a committee
should be appointed to wait on members
who were not present to give them an
opportunity to enlarge the sum. The
president requested that the committee
should be named by the audience. The
meeting appointed as the committee A.
Gerberding, J. Newman, E. B. Cutter, E.

The sum of $645 was raised in a few
minutes yesterday. The contribution will
be increased until the amount reaches

WILL SPrIED.
Nuptials of Mis* Minnie Bradbury
and Isaac Hi'iliard Pope
Yesterday.
Besides the occurrence of at least one
happy wedding, two notable enga.ements
were made public yesterday, and for once
society was unable to wisely wag its head
and whisper, "I told you so." In fact
tue 400 were entirely unpre pared for the
pleasant news, and Dame Rumor had
never in her wildest or moat reckless
moods even hinted, at the coupling of the
names of Joseph D. Grant and Miss
Macleay or of Miss Adeline Mills and
Chester Holcomb,
Mr. Grant is one of the wealthiest of
San Francisco's eligible young men
and for many years past has at once
been the delight and despair of doting
mothers and match-making chaperones.
Miss Macleay, the young la<ly of his
choice, is a Portland belle and beauty.
She is the daughter of Donald Macleay, a
retired merchant of Portland, a member
of the old iirm of Corbett & Macieay, who
were the first of the prominent mercantile
firms lo win a wide commercial reputation
on the Pacific Coast.
In appearance she is slightly above the
average height, a chataine, with large
blue eyes and exquisite complexion. She
was educated in England, where, up to
two years ago, she had lived continuously
since the death of her mother, wuich oc
curred when she was but a child.
She returned to the home of her father
in Portland two years ago, and since that
time has been prominently identified in
Portland not only as a society woman, but
as a leader in local charitable work.
Joseph D. Grant is one of the best known
young men on this coast. He is a partner
in the firm of Murpny, Grant & Co., one

ROMANCE OF TWO CITIES.
Miss Dlckenson of San Francisco
and Mr. Speed of Nashville
Unite Their Claims.
A romantic marriage, which was a great
surprise to the young lady's friends, took
place in this City yesterday. One of the
contracting persons was Miss Thama
Dickenson of this City, daughter of Dr.
Dickenson of Santa Rosa, and grand
daughter of Dr. JohnÃon, one of the pio
neers of San Jose, who was owner of an
immense area of land in the Pan Joaquin
Valley, and was a relative of ihe late Gov
ernor Burnett.
The groom was William K. Speed of
Nashville, Term., a distant cousin of the
bride. It seems the young people met for
the first time last fall, while conferring as
joint heirs in regard to a great estate that
their attorneys assure them they will have
no difficult}' in getting.
Part of the property consists of real
estate in St. Louie, worth many millions of
dollars. The gigantic Union depot, the
greatest in the world, constructed of solid
granite and covering many acres, i& on a
part 01 this land.
There is a large amount of other prop
erty in the big Missouri city, as well as in
other pans of the country. The young
people made common cause, with no
thought of love, but the unexpected hap
pened and almost within a few days the
engagement was made. They were united
in marriage yesterday at the residence of
Arch bishop Riordan. The ceremony was
performed by the Rev. Father Mulligan.
Only immediate relatives were present.
The parlors were handsomely decorated
with Easter lilies.
Mr. Speed is a grandson of the late Dr.
Joseph Nash McDowell of St. .Louie. Mo.
The happy couple left on the overland
train immediately afier the ceremony on
an extended honeymoon trip and are not
expected in California until late in the
summer. The Nashville Centennial will
be included in the travels of Mr. and Mrs.
Speed.

PLACE FOR FIVE
THOUSAND URNS
A Classic Temple for the
Ashes of the
Dead.
It Will Be Erected by the Odd
Fellows Near Their
Crematory.
Cahill & Condon Have Made Plans
lor a Beautiful Struct
ure.
On Sunday the board of directors of the
I. O. O. F. Cemetery Association adopted
plans for their new columbarium. The
plans were prepared by Cahill & Condon,
architects, wlio were directed to proceed
with the details for immediate con
struction. The structure will be original
and unique in design and will cost about
$150,000.
The ground pian of the columbarium
shows a circular building, carrying the
outer dome intersected at the four cardi
nal points by rectangular wings. Between
these four wings are four quadrants formed
by outer walls, concentric with the inner
wall, but running up only as high as two
stories. Inside of the main circular wall
is a series of eight piers, carrying with
them two galleries or arcades on their
outer periphery and leaving on the inner
circumference a spacious rotunda, clear
from the floor to the lantern dome. In
this way the building becomes divided in
to well-denned portions â ceutral rotunda,
main galleries, wings and quadrants.
Standing on the mosaic floor under the
mellowing light of the great stained glass
window in the dome overhead, no one
will be conscious of the vast number of
niches in the galleries and wings around
him to be at some time stored with the
ashes of thousands of the dead. This im
pression is much enhanced by the use of
heroic materials. On the gallery parapets
stationary urns will be set, forming a part
of the architectural scheme of the ro
tunda. These will be of alabaster and
bronze, while the mortuary tablets below
will be of white Italian marble. The main
stairway will be of marble and bronze and
the entire floor of colored marble mosaic.
The niches wiJl be of cement, varying in
size, and ranging along the brick wall,
one above another, in not more than live
rows. The niches will be framed in light
bronze, with doors In front, or they may
be Jelt open or covered with marble slabs
to suit the taste of the purchaser. It will
be possible to buy groups of niches of any
number required and have them ail cov
ered with one comprehensive tablet, on
which may be engraved any device or in
scription "the owner chooses. There will
be great variety in the size and position of
niche space. Where available, space has
been reserved on the exterior of the build
ing, in the front pilasters, in the vestibule,
and in the columns of the rotunda. These
spaces will be disposed of at higher rates,
according to their isolation and promi
nence.
The whole exterior of the building will
be tinished in artificial stone of the light
est color possible. The desien is Italian
renaissance in character, and similar in
feeling ana motive to the crematorium,
which wa3 designed by Architect Cahlli.
The whole interior, including the galle
ries, arcade, rotunda and roof trusses, will
be constructed of light steelwork, espe
cially designed by Daniel E. Condon, the
well-known expert on building construc
tion and the designer of all steelwork
forming the skeleton of the City Hall
tower dome.
A DESPEKATE STRUGGLE.
At 1230 Marfcet street yesterday was a scene
never to be forgotten. Police were at a loss
how to handle the immense mob. which tried
all day to get into tne Paragon Cloak and
Suit Company. From the way goods have gone
this sale will last a lew days only. *
PENNY PUECHASING WIND-UP.
Indignant Victims Maka Thin es Lively
for Mrs. Assinann.
Three hundred indignant women, in
person or represented by husbands or
brothers, eathered last night in tbe resi
dence of Mrs. Assmann.at 910 Washington
street, to behold the winding up of Penny
Purchasing Clubs A, B and C, and inci
dentally to wind themselves ud for bein s
duped.
Mr. Gildea presided as chairman of the
meeting and appointed Messrs. Wall,
Gearhard and Colonel Busli as acorn
f"Â«ttee to investigate the affairs of the
club. \\all declined after stating his
reason tnat h6 was going to sue Mrs.
Assmann to recover the money paid to her
by his wife.
Mrs. Assmann refused lo deliver up her
books, on the plea that they were not
ready, and her victims readily agreed to
accept 25 cents on every doilar they rut
in. It was said that Mrs Assmann col
lected $3000 trom her victims, and that she
had only $700 left to pay them off last
night.

REMODELING THE CODE.
The Commissioners Sleet and Will
First Take Up Election
Statutes.
T. W. H. Shanahan, A. Caminetti and
Mr. Bulla of Los Angeles, the three Code
Commissioners lately appointed by Gov
ernor Budd, met yesterday and formu
lated a plan of procedure. They agreed
to take up the Political Code first for
amendment and revision. Each member
will, as Mr. Shanahan said last night,
carefully examine into and consider what
should be done, and at me meetings
which will occur once a month will sub
mit them.
They will remold, amend and expunge
as seems requi>ite. The Tolitical Code,
as Mr. Sbanuhan explains, is in a bat
jumble. Decisions and conflicting stat
utes have accumulated, and now unity
and harmony are to be brought oat of the
whole. If when the Legislature meets it
has confidence in the recommendations of
the commission it can act at once and
simplify its political Jaws.
The commission appointed a secretary
and will keep right at work.
LIQUOR MEN AT WAR.
Wholesalers aud Rntailers DUtgree
About Warehouses.
There is consternation amone retail
liquor dealers and a pretty s;ood prospect
of hard feeling against the wholesalers of
this City, because there is a movement
among wholesalers to have the Govern
ment abolish its bonded warehouses here.
"Forty-nine wholesalors have signed a
petition to the Internal Revenue Com
missioner of tue United States, "said John
VV. Morgan yesterday, "wherein they ask
that the bonded warehouses in San Fran
cisco be closed. Their plea is that the
warehouses are being uÂ«ed by merchants
and liquor dealers as storehouses, greatly
to the detriment of the Goverment. They
are making a concerted effort to close
them. They would then have the trade
at their mercy, everj'thing coming their
way.' 1
The contention of the retailers is that
the present system is all right, as it en
ables the retailer to buy his own spirits
and sell "straight poods," whereas it is
claimed the closing of the warehouses
would leave retailers wholly at the mercy
of the wholesale trade.
