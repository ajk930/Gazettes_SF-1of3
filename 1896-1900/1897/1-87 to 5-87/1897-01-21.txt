/ A GEEAT SENSATION IN THE
\ OLD BAILEY.
Hard Blow to Scotland Yardâ Much
Credit Is Due an American
Attorney.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 20.â The trial of
Edward J. Ivory, the alleged dynamiter,
which began last Monday, ended to-day
by the complete collapse of the Govern
ment's case and the discharge of the pris
oner.
When Justice Hawkins took his seat in
â¢. the Criminal Court, Old Bailey, Solicitor-
General Findley, who has been conduct
ing the prosecution, addressed the court,
saying that the prosecuting authorities in
the case had made the discovery that the
explosives which were found in Antwerp
â¢ were purchased after the date of the al
leged conspiracy, as far as Ivory was con
cerned therein, and there was no evidence
to snow that he was concerned in the pur
chase of the explosives. Therefore, he
said, that portion of the case could not be
sustained, aud it was not customary to
proceed with the trial of a case udou
minor charges after the principal charge
had been withdrawn.
Justice Hawkins concurred in the re
marks of the Solicitor-General and di
rected the jury to find a verdict of not
guilty, which was done.
The Judge, continuing his remarks,
commended the police for their able and i
impartial conduct in the case, and the
prisoner, having been formally discharged,
iefi the dock a free man and joined his ,
friends.
Inspector Melville, chief ot the Scotland j
Yard police, who was mainly instrumental
in bringing about the arrest of Ivory,
Tynan, Kearney and Haines, was the first :
to congratulate the defendant after his re- '
lease. Taking Ivory by the hand In- |
spector Melville expressed the hope that j
the now free man would lay to heart the i
warning given to him by the Judge to ;
keep out of bad eomp.ny in the future,
to which Ivory replied, "You can bet
your bottom dollar I wilL"
Ivory told a representative of the
United Associated Presses that be was
' going to Dublin and from there to
America. He declined to talk about his
case, but said tbat he had not suffered in
any respect during bis confinement in
jail, though he had lost fifty pounds in
weight.
After the discharge of Ivory a represen
tative of the United Associated Presses
had an interview with John F. Mclntyre,
the former Assistant District Attorney of j
There Is Nothing Small About Matt Arnerich, the Popular Assemblyman From
. '..â  Santa Clara* - - - '
The San Francisco Call
the county of New York, who came to as
sist in Ivory's defense. Mr. Mclntyre
said that when he arrived in London he
found that the British counsel retained
for .the defense were disposed to put in a
plea of guilty, bnt be bad advised against
such a course, saying tbat there was no
evidence to justify Ivory's conviction.
Mr. Mclntyre highly commended the
fairness of Sir R. D. Findlay, the solicitor
general, in adopting the same view as
that held by Ivory's advisers. Mr. Mc
lntyre allowed the reporter to understand
that the case was still a mystery.
"The evidence given by Mr. Goll, the
proprietor of the hotel in Antwerp at
â  which Kearney' and Haines stopped," Mr.
Mclntyre said, "showed that a stranger
j bad driven to the hotel and delivered a
I warning to Kearney and Haines on Sep
tember 11, two days before they were ar
! rested in Rotterdam. I believe that the
i stranger was an agent of the police and
i that the collapse of the Government's case
! is due to him. '
"The general opinion seems to be," con
tinued Mr. Mclntyre, "that Tynan and
Kearney were in league with the polite
and that nothing serious was intended by
the police, who allowed the men to po
about as they chose. It is mv belief and
that of many others that the police did
not intend to arrest any of the men, but
an overzealous detective at Boulogne gave
them away by exposing tbe identity of
Tynan."
The general drift of comment upon the
collapse of the case in London this after
noon is that the whole thing was a politi
cal "fake."

NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. Â£o.â The news
of the discharge of Ivory came as a sur
prise to Irishmen here, for even the pris
i oner had looked upon the matter as a cut
j and dried affair. William Lyman', presi
j dent of the Irish National Alliance, who
specially engaged John F. Mclntyre in the
defense of Ivory, when seen today said:
"The withdrawal of the prosecution is
i the biggest blow that Scotland Yard bas
i ever received. The English public has
| vow bad its eyes opened and it can figure
j up for itself now many other unfortunate
so-called dynamiters, who were convicted
; on perjured testimony or were driven mad,
I like Dr. Gallagher and Whitehead, were
j innocent. I thought they would have
p railroaded Ivory in order to make good
- their pretenses before the English people.
They would have done so, but they knew
! Ivory's defense was one that could not be
: got over.
"This is the first time that any defense
has ever been attempted by an Irish-
American arrested in England. The
policy has been to leave them to their
fate, in the belief that it would be impos
sible to obtain justice from an English
jury. lam glad of the result, as it will do
a lot of good. . Â;.*."
"Publicopinion in England has changed.
The people there are sick of Scotland Yard
j plots, and I can only account for the with
j drawal of the case on the assumption that
! the prosecution knew the jurors would
; not act blindly as in former times. , ,
â¢ "I may say now that the prosecution
did everything in its power to have Ivory
1 plead guilty, saying that be would receive
' a nominal sentence or have sentence sus
: pended. Tbey tried plot after plot to con
nect the Irish National League with a
j dynamite policy, in order to discredit it.
j In that, as well as inducing IvoryÂ» an in
nocent man, to plead guilty, they failed.
'â¢What will they do now with their in
former, Jones? The only thing I am
sorry for since this fiasco is that Ivory did
not get an opportunity to show that
scoundrel up in his true colors. But think
how Jones must have gulled Scotland
Yard. Why, Ivory had witnesses ready to
prove that Jones, ever since he started
from this country at the bidding of Scot
land Yard, tried to induce men in Dublin
to work up dynamite plots. â  Witnesses
went over from here to show that he had
I attempted the same thing, and had been
J expelled from one club for doing so."
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, JANUARY 21, 1897.
SPEAKER COOMBS Looks Up a Few Points During Recess.
DUCKWORTH IS
ASKED TO RESIGN
Sensational Sequel to the
Legislative Payroll
Scandal.
i â¢
Republican Assemblymen Meet
in Caucus and Resolve
Upon Action.
Friends of the Clerk Will Fight for
Him in the Lower House -
To-Day.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20.â leg
islative scandal left too long a trail of
fire and made a report too loud to be un
seen and unheard by the people of the
State. It is very hard for a person of deli
cate sense of smell to appear unconscious
of a sickening odor, and the Assembly bas
about made up its mind to investigate the
source of the odor. If there are any rot
ten eggs in the balls of legislation, either
in Denmark or in California, the members
will search for the stolen nest and remove
it. It is believed that a goodly number of
Assemblymen have the odor on their
clothes, tinctured with the essence of par
ticeps criminis.'but they think that an ex
ample should be made in order that a
repetition of the offense two years hence
may be avoided.
Chief Clerk Duckworth was the subject
of a caucus held this afternoon by the
Republicans in the Assembly, but he was
not invited to appear. The Assembly re
solved itself into a legislative grand jury,
and after a heated discussion decided to
request Mr. Duckworth to tender hia
resignation. A committee was appointed
to wait on him and convey the decision of
the caucus, and this committee was in
effect a personified threat that he must
resign or be ousted.
It had been found that several persons
had been placed on the payroll who bad
not appeared, at Sacramento at all, and
tbe fact that the temporary organization
this year cost $2000 more than it did last
year was the burden of the debate. It
was conceded that Mr. Duckworth had
appointed the greater part of those at
taches at the request of members of the
Assembly, and that after the organization
of the Assembly had ' been completed the
Assembly itself had voted to pay them for
a week's service.
Another scandal . cropped up in the
caucus. It is said tthatt t several attaches
on the temporary roll who are now on the
permanent roll had drawn double mile
age, and when this was broached in the
caucus there was a storm of indignation.
The meeting was of the unanimous mind
that the extra mileage should be returned
or else the offending attaches should be
discharged.
This evening Mr. Duckworth made the
following statement to a Call corre
spondent:
"The roll was made up at the request of
members of the Legislature for every
name that appears except in one or two
instances. The journal of January 4 says
'that I banded in the temporary roll and
not even one dollar appears opposite their
names. The names appear on the roll
without any liability against the State.
The journal of January 5 says that the As
sembly on that day elected fifty-seven per
manent employes to serve through the
session and to perform the duties that
were Biipp>oÃ'd to be performed by tnose
on the temporary roll. The journal of
January 6 says that the Committee on
Mileage and Temporary Officers submitted
its report and that it was recommitted to
the committee for further consideration.
"The journal of January 7 contains the
report of the Committee on Mileage and
Temporary Attaches and consists of two
resolutions. The first provided for the
mileage of members, and the second for
the payment of mileage and per diem to
the temporary employes. Both were con
sidered at length by the house, and Mr.
Bridgford moved to strike out all the
mileage on the temporary roll except for
statutory officers.
'*; "Mr. Belsbaw moved as a substitute
that the mileage, of Joseph Brooks, Ed J.
Smith, F. H. Lombard, William Levison,
A. A. Friedlander and J. Cramer be
stricken from tbe report. ln each instance
the mileage allowed by the. committee
amounted jto $16 80. Mr.'Belshaw's sub-
stitute was accepted ; by Mr.'Bridgford and
was voted down by the House. The report
of , the committee as . originally -submitted
was 1 then ' adopted by the House, prac
tically by unanimous vote.
"From the two resolutions presented by
the Committee' on Mileage, two payrolls
were made up by the sergeant-at-arms,
one for the mileage of members, the other
for the pay of the temporary attaches.
The payroll" for the mileage was rejected
by Speaker Coombs upon the ground that
he did : not consider _it correct. The
secondâ that for the attaches â was ap
proved by him, and thereupon warrants
were issued by the Controller in favor of
all those on tne roll. It goes without say
ing that in" this proceeding I had abso
lutely no part.
"At the proper time I shall vindicate
myself. The ' committee that requested
my resignation was composed of three
Republicans, two of whom had appoint
ments made; for, them on the temporary
roll at their special request. The caucus
at which it decided to request my resigna
tion was held behind closed doors, and I
was not aware that it was being held nor
of the nature of the charges against me, if
any were preferred. , ;. Â
"I stated to the committee when it

LABOR'S FRIENDS
AT THE CAPITOL
Senate Committee Acts on
Bills for the Relief of
Workingmen.
Insure Reasonable Hours, a Fair
Wage and Certainty of
Recompense.
Measures Intended to Protect the Em
ploye Against .the Loss of
" His Earnings.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20.âEvery
thing was pleasant sailing at the meeting
of the Senate Committee on Labor and
Capital to-night. Every bill up for con
sideration was either favorably passed
upon or definite action was deferred. x The ,
two measures relating to employment
agents, which raised such a breeze before
the Assembly committee, were laid over,
and will not come up before the Senate
committee again until next week.
The members of the Senate committee
who were present at the meeting to-night
were disposed to show every consideration
to the interests of the laboring man.
Those present were Senators Morehouse
(chairman), Stratton, Henderson and
Simpson. The laborers' interests were
represented by Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald, Deputy Labor Commissioner Dam,
Walter McArthur and L. J. Rose of the
San Francisco Painters' Union.
With a little discussion the measure fix
ing the minimum compensation for labor
on ali work performed under the authority
of any public official at $2 per day and pro
viding that a stipulation to this effect be
made a part of all contracts to which the
Slate or any municipal corporation is a
party was agreed to.
The next bill taken up was that pro
viding for the proper sanitary condition
of bakeries, hotels and public restaurants,
and the health of the employes therein,
and providing for the appointment of a
bakehouse inspector. Senator Stratton
expressed himself ;as in favor of ; the bill,
with the exception of the section provid
ing for the appointment of a bakehouse
inspector. ' He explained his objection on
the ground that this carried an appropria
tion. . He thought the police or other local
officers could perform the duties of in
spector; in connection with their other
duties. â¢
Walter McArthur, on being asked why
this suggestion could not be adopted,
stated that it required a man with a special
knowledge of bakes hops, such as a practi
cal baker, to properly appreciate the true
condition of a bakeshop. Senator Simp
son thought, the provision relatine to the
construction: and maintenance of bake
shops were too much in detail. He |
thought a general provision for the proper,
sanitary condition of bakeshops would be
sufficient. Labor : Commissioner Fitzger
ald stated the section was patterned after
the New York law, on the same subject.'
Chairman Morehouse agreed with Senator
Simpson. He said he would not vote for
the bill in its present shape,' and certainly
hot for any measure creating additional
inspectors. Further consideration of the
bill was deferred. v. *.- : :â¢ '
There was no objection to the bill de
signed to prevent collusion between em
ployers of labor and employment agents,
and it was agreed to recommend its pas
sage... > .'... .;..;. ; t.- i
The bill to secure the payment of the
claims of material men, mechanics or
laborers employed by contractors upon
State, municipal or other pubic work
was considered. Simpson ' did ; not like
the section making , such claims a legal
claim against -the . State, .'i county, city,
town or district by the officers of which
the contract was awarded. v Stratton sug
gested that the officer making the contract
be made liable, instead of the State, city,
county, town or district. The bill ; was
> amended in this respect, and : the commit
tee agreed to report it favorably. ;
The bill to protect citizens in their civil
rights, advocated by the colored citizens
of the State, was unanimously agreed to.
When the eight-hour law came up
Stratton thought the provision \ prohibit
ing any one from working more than eight
hours might create a hardship, so long as
the rate per day was not fixed bylaw.
McAftbur argued tbe matter, showing the
need of such a provision to prevent the
selfish-minded from taking advantage of
his fellow-laborer, and . the committee
finally agreed to report it favorably. *
Favorable action was taken on the
measure regulating the hour 3of labor of
persons employed in bakeries to ten hours
a day. A similar course was taken on the
bill providing that only citizens of the
United States should be employed upon
public works within the State.'
In order to await the action of the As
sembly committee on the bill providing
for the prompt payment of the wages of
laborers in lawful money of the United
States, action was postponed. The bill
relating to keepers of intelligence offices,
submitted by the representatives of em
ployment agencies, was passed by, to be
considered with the measure submitted by
the labor unions to define the duties and
liabilities of employment agents.

. fornia Lawmakers.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 15.âJudg
ing from a batch of bills already intro
duced in the Assembly the interests of the
laborer in California will be well guarded.
Many abuses under which working people
now suffer will be remedied if the bills
become law, and there is every indication
that they will be passed, for this Legisla
ture is Republican in politics, and the Re
publican party has ever been the friend of
the laboring man. 'J ,.-! ..* ."
Assembly bill No. 47, by Sanford of Men
docino, provides as follows:
Section 1. It shall be unlawful tor any cor

from his usual employment at the time of
the payment of the wages so earned by
him. All assignments of future wages

DENIES NOT
Says That He May Be in
President McKinley's
Cabinet.
THE MATTER NOT DEFI
NITELY SETTLED.
Possible Connection With the
Official Family Was
Discussed.
SOME , ANECDOTES OF THE
McKINLEYS.
Nat ; onal Committeeman. John IX
Spreekels and T. H. Caswell to
Help Inaugurate.
Hon. Joseph McKenna, Judge of the
United States Circuit Court, arrived in
this City last evening direct from Canton,
Ohio, where he has been in conference
with Major McKinley, President-elect.
His coming was not announced, it being
his desire to return as quietly and as un
ostentatiously as be departed. He was
successful in this. Half an hour after the
overland passengers arrived on this sid_
of the bay Judge McKenna was at his
home at 22G4 FranKlin street. While
there were many calls upon the telephone
in his residence yesterday, and while
during the past few days many persons
have telephoned congratulations, Judge
McKenna managed to enjoy undisturbed
the domesticity of his charming house
bold last evening.
"I have been to Canton," said Judge
McKenna to a Call reporter; "that is
well known. I have talked with the
President-elect concerning the Cabinet
and concerning my taking a position
therein. But I wish to say that some
statements have been made in tbe news
papers concerning me that are not just so."
"Is it true that you have been invited to
accept a position in the Cabinet of Presi
dent McKinley, and that you have decided
to do so?"
r -' Â©thing has been decided," was the
response.
. "But were you not invited to visit Can
ton in reference to your acceptance of the
position alluded to?''
"That is putting the matter to broadly."
"But what is there to the report about
the Cabinet in connection with yourself?"
"I am afraid tho newspapers have stated
it to strongly. My visit to Canton Pas
been given too much significance. Ido
not deny that I may enter President Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet, but from that to the
fact of entering there are some obstacles,
and it may not be at all. It is difficult to
express, and be correctly understood, the
freedom which has been left with Major
McKinley and me."
'â¢Concerning the obstacles, Judge, it has
been more than hinted that one obstacle
to your accepting a Cabiret position
might be the possibility of your appoint
ment.to a seat on the bench of the Su
preme Court of the United States to suc
ceed Justice Stephen J. Field upon his re
tirement."
"Now," said Judge McKenna decidedly,
"there is nothing at all to that story.
When I mention impediments it is not to
be understood that my going into the
Supreme Court is a condition. The im
pediments are entirely personal which
may prevent my going into the Cabinetâ
if the position should be finally tendered
to me."
Further than this Judge McKenna did
not care to talk about any connection be
tween himself and the Cabinet of the
President-elect. He had other matters of
interest to talk about and described some
of the characteristics of Major McKinley's
family in anecdotes concerning them.
"I brought from Canton pleasant
memories," he said, "which I would not
give up for the sake of the premiership in
the administration. In this I do not
allude merely to the personal courtesies
of the visit, but to something better than
that the instruction and sentiment of it.
"I had the freedom of Major McKinley's
house and observed or participated in
what transpired as I pleased or was in
vited. Major McKinley sent his carriage
for me as early as 9 o'clock, and at that
hour he j already had other visitors, gen
tlemen from the South, who discussed the
perplexing problems of that section.
"From that time .until 5 o'clock in the
, afternoon the stream of incoming visitors
was continuous â tbe curious, the ambi
tious, the interested, the patriotic all
came. One mother brought her boy that he
might look at the President-elect. Senators
and members-elect of the House of Repre
sentatives and a delegation irom Texas
who presented the request of their State
for representation in the Cabinet were
there.'; \'\':'j'.,:[:
"They were all received with an atten
tive and charming courtesy, each measur
ing the time of his own stay, which under
the circumstances was surely noteworthy.
The Major showed no impatience, no in
attention even, and each visitor departed
only wnen he himself desired to. If the
demands of state permit a similar courtesy
in the White House, Major McKinley will
be the most popular of Presidents. .
'The result of this was that the day pro
ceeded smoothly. There was no hurry, no
friction, and wo sat down to dinner at 7
o'clock as if the day bad been passed in
repose and pleasure, instead of incessant
business and care.
,"1 had some conversation with Major
McKinley touching the subject of bis ad
ministration. He is deeply impressed
with his, coming duties and feelingly ex
pressed his sense of their responsibilities.
At dinner the conversation turned on past
days at the White House under other ad
ministrations. Mrs. McKinley was iv
good health during ; the Hayes â  adminis
tration and was Mrs. Hayes, almo.t con2
slant companion, and she spoke of her
with admiration; spoke of .her dignity and
sweet womanliness and-of her courage to
do right.
" 'To do the right,' the Major said,
musingly, and then added, clearly, but
with feeling: 'Judge, as the time ap
proaches I feel more and more the great
ness and solemnity of my responsibilities.
I am impressed with them at times.'
"Hesitating a little, he continued: 'The
distress which is in this great land at the
present time makes my heart ache. May
God give me the grace and power to con
tribute to its relief.'
"Pausing a while he continued: 'The
Republicans believe in our party.- We
know that it is sincere. It must be more.
It must v be wise. Wo are convinced its
policies are best. If we fail it will be just
that the party be pushed aside for a bet
ter. But I cannot believe that we shall
fail.' "
Judge McKenna told a striking story
concerning Major McKinley's mother, as
follows:
"At 5 o'clock the Major and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley and myself took a short ride and
then called on his mother. She is a well
preserved old lady, gentle in manner, in-
Hi vent, interested in everything. She
is of that strong, reverential and religious
nature that refers the things of the
earth to the disposition of the Divine
Power, and it is easy to see from whom
the Major derives the quality of devotion
to the duty of the hour which has made
him what he is.
'â¢There were other visitors there. Some
one spoke of the Major as President.
" 'Not yet,' bis mother said; 'in the
providence of God on the 4th of March we
hope.' "
Judge McKenna told these stories illus
trating the devotional side of the great
man who led the Republican hosts to vic
tory and of Major McKinley's venerable
mother with evident pleasure. Of his own
attitude Judge McKenna had only one
more remark to make and this came out
in response to a question.
"I was not a candidate for a Cabinet
position when I went to Canton," he said,
"nor am I a candidate for such a position
now."

Spreekels and T. H. Caswell
Will Take Part.
John D. Spreekels, Republican National
Committeeman, and Thomas H. Caswell,
Sovereign Grand Commander of the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of
Free Masons, will journey together to
Washington to attend the inauguration of
President McKinley. acting as members of
the reception committee, of which Gen
eral Nelson- A. Miles is chairman. The
invitation reads as follows:
Washington, D. C, Jan. 14, 1897.
Dear Sir: 1 have the honor to advise you that
you have been appointed a member of the re
ception committee (of which General Nelson
A. Miles is chairman} of the inaugural cere
monies of March 4, 1897. Please advise me
whether you will accept said appointment.
Yours very truly, - C. J. Bell,
Chairman Inaugural Committee.

had no means of knowing whether those
members had notified them or not.
"Wesley Dixon, who has been men
tioned as not having been in Sacramento
at all during the temporary organization,
was appointed by me at the request of
County Clerk Jordan of Alameda, who re
quested the appointment on behalf of
Assemblyman Wright."
The matter will come before the As
sembly early to-morrow morning, and
Mr. Duckworth's friends will make a fight
for him. Among these is Assemblyman
Leon E. Jones of San Francisco, who says
that he will support Clerk Duckworth to
morrow.
"The Assembly participated in the mis
take, if there was any," he said, "and it
should not try to shift the burden of the
blame on the shoulders of the chief clerk."
Assemblymen Coombs, Cutter and Dib
ble had an extended conference late to
night in the Assembly chamber on the
matter. Mr. Dibble declined to talk
about the affair, and said that the ques
tion of Duckworth's resignaiion would
come up the first thing in the morning.
The Democratic minority had a caucus
to-night and decided to stand in with
eleven Republican friends of Mr. Duck
worth to allow him to speak in his de
fense to-morrow. They hope that by so
doing they will stir the scandal from its
lowest depths and make political capital
out of it. They hope, also, that Mr. Duck
worth will say bitter things and will read
a list of Assemblymen at whose request
he made appointments on the temporary
roll.
The opinion of more conservative mem
bers is that if Mr. Duckworth should at
tempt to drag others down with him, his
political career will be ended. He will be
afforded every opportunity of making a
defense so far as his part in the appoint
ments is concerned, but if be prefers to
show his teeth, they say he will bite only
himself

.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20.â

play an important part in elections in
this State if Assemblyman Strain's bill,
No. 101, should become a law. The bill is
intended to prevent stuffing of the regis
ter and repeating by having each voter
photographed, not for the rogues* gallery,
but for the information of the election
officers. It will prevent a stuffer from
voting in some one else's name, for his
"mug" must fit the Paris panel, and if he
does not match the tintype he will be
arrested and prosecuted for violating the
purity of election law.
The bill provides that Boards of Super
visors of each of the counties or cities and
counties of the State shall have power to
prevent fraudulent voting by requiring
that photographs be taken of all electors
who make application for the entry of
their names upon the great register of
such county or city and county ; provided
that the taking of such photographs be
done by contract at a public expense that
shall not exceed 5 cents for two photo
graphs of each elector.
The board, in ordering the photographs
of electors to be taken, may make such
order applicable to such county or city
and couniy as a whole or may limit its
operations to incorporated cities or towns
having not less than 10,000 inhabitants.
The Board of Supervisors may provide a
room or apartment or erect a booth for
taking the photographs of electors, but
the person or persons to whom the con
tract for taking the photographs is
awarded shall furnish all instruments and
all material and all labor required in the
prosecution of the wort of taking the
photographs.
The photographs of the electors shall be
taken on adhesive paper or tissue, and
shall be placed by the County Clerk in
books for use in the different election pre
cincts. One of the photographs taken of
each elector shall be placed in a book, in
which the photographs shall be arranged
in the alphabetical order of the names of
the electors in the precinct. Underthe
photograph of each elector the name and
number of the elector shall be written as
such name, and number appear on the
precinct register. A second, photograph
of each elector in each precinct shall be
placed in a book in which the photographs
shall be arranged according to the names
of the streets and according to the numer
ical order of the rooms in the houses.
Under such photograph' the name and
number of the elector shall be written.
The Board of Supervisors may direct the
Couniy Clerk to canvass any one or more
houses in any election precinct, with the
book of photographs of the electors of such
precinct. The photographs of electors
registered from any house may be shown
to the owner, or occupant, or landlord, or
tenant, or manager, or clerk of such house,
and such owner, or occupant, or landlord,
or tenant, or manager, or clerk, or other
person having control of such house may
be questioned as to the residence of. such
electors in said house. Any person hav
ing control in any house who shall refuse
to give information, or who shall willfully
give false information in regard to the
residence of electors in such house when
questioned , by an officer, shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor, and may be fined $500 or
imprisoned for six months.
No elector shall bl allowed to cast his
ballot at the polls until his photograph is
examined. At the cose of the polls the
book of photographs shall be returned to
the County Clerk, and by him shall be
preserved for a period of not less than four
years. On trials for election frauds these
books of photographs shall be admitted as
evidence. In all counties and cities and

this act upon Boards of Supervisors and
County Clerks shall be exercised and per

JJV THE UPPER HOUSE.
Measures Passed Upon by- Comtnilteea of
the Senate.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20.â Two
radical departures from the customs of the
past were decided upon at, the caucus of
the Republican Senators this afternoon.
They considered" the matter of nomina
tions for library trustees, five of whom are
to be voted for by the Legislature on Feb
ruary 3. It was decided to ask the Assem
bly to meet for the purpose of matting
nominations on Monday next. During
tlie discussion of candidates it was de
cided that each should be. pledged to ap
point none but Republicans to positions
in the State Library, from the librarian
down. '.r""~*
Then came the matter of creating a
new standing committee, to be known
as the San Francisco delegation. Such
a committee bas been a regular part
of the Assembly organization, but has not
heretofore been officially recognized by
tbe^enate. It was decided to create such
a committ-e with" power to appoint a
clerk. All bills relating to San Francisco
affairs will be referred to this committee.
State Printer Johnston appeared before
the Senate Finance Committee and made
so able an argument in behalf of the es
tablishment under liis charge that by an
almost unanimous voto the committee de
cided to report in favor of a $75,000 appro
priation for the State printing office. The
measure as it passed the Assembly pro
vides for but $30,000, although the Assem
bly Committee reported in favor of $75,
--000. The committee also reported favor
ably the bill appropriating $10,000 for a
California exhibit at the Guatemala ex
hibition, and a similar measure for the
same amount in connection with the
Nashville exposition.
Braunhart'sbillin reference to arbitrary,
assessments was acted upon favorably by
the Judiciary Committee to-day.
At the session of the County Govern
ment Committee this afternoon the po
lice pension bill, designed to permit of
the retirement of Chief Crowley, received'
favorable action. Sergeant Birdsall ap
peared on behalf of the Police Depart
ment, and as an argument in support of
the measure suggested that its passage
would create a number of vacancies, the
tilling of some of which would bo at the
disposal of^ members of the committee.
His tempting generosity was declined
with thanks. The same committee agreed
to report favorably the bill asked for by
the citizens, which provided tnat all work
for State buildings should be advertised
for separately instead of the building as a
whole. The original cumbersome bill was
referred to Senator Stratton, who drafted
a short and comprehensive measure of
about twenty lines, covering the whole
subject.
TILT BE 2 WE -V SENATORS.
San X rancisco Polic- Courts the Subject
of Dissensions. . ;';.,% .-â 'â â¢
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20.â Two of
the San FranciÃCO Senators enlivened the
proceedings in the upper house this morn
ing, the subject of their dissensions being
the Police Courts of San Francisco. Sen
ator Bert's bill extending the term of the
Police Judees to four years came up for
second reading, and went through with
out objection. Subsequently Braunhart,
who was absent when the bill was passed
to second reading, came iD, and on his mo
tion, seconded by Bert, the action of the
Senate with reference to the bill was re
considered. Braunhart then offered as a
substitute his bill on the same subject.
This also extends the term to four years,
reduces the number of Police Courts to
three, gives the appointment of the Judges
to tbe Mayor, requires tbat the Judges
shall have been licensed to practice by the
Supreme Court, and that they shall have
practiced for at least tive years before ap
pointment. It further provides that only
attorneys licensed by the Supreme Court
shall practice in such Police Courts, and
that the warrant and bond clerk shall
"keep his office always open, day and
night, for the transaction of business,"
but abolishes the power of the clerks to
issue bonds and order the release of pris
oners. It provides for the appointment
by the Judge of a stenographer for each
court at a salary of $150. â _- 1,.',- :.,'*-," .
Braunhart moved that both bills be re
referred to the Judiciary Committee, and
this brought Bert to his feel. He opposed
this course and asked that the matter be
placed before the Senate at once. His
motion prevailed, and Braunhart then
moved tbat the matter be made a special
order for Friday morning, immediately
after the reading of the journal, as he was
not at this time prepared to. argue the
merits of his bill. It was .so .ordered.

NEW YORK, N.Y., Jan. 20.-Edward
Lauternach arrived in this city from
Canton, Ohio, to-day. He told a reporter
for the United Associated Presses that
his trip to Canton was for the purpose of
impressing upon Mr. McKinley the im
portance of appointing as a member of
his Cabinet a man representing the pre
vailing sentiment of the Republican party
in this State.
"I went," continued Mr. L.uterbach.
" as tbe representative of Mr. Piatt and
the Republican managers 'of the legisla
ture. The names I suggested for either of
the three places ; in the Cabinet which
have not as yet been announced as filled,
namely navy, postmaster-generalship and
Attorney-General, were J. Sloat Fassett
of Elmira, S. E. Payne of Auburn, and
Stuart L. Woodford of Brooklyn."
Mr. Lauterbach said i he had quite a
lengthy chat with the President-elect, and
came away with the impression that Mr.
McKinley* was favorably inclined toward
recognizing * the claims of â  the regular
Republicans of New York State.

HOME RULE FOR
ALL COUNTIES
Stratton's Bill Favorably
Considered in Senate
Committee.
Gives Each County the Right
to Regulate Its Own
Affairs.
Designed to End the Perennial Con*
troversies Brought Before the
%, Legislature.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20.âFavor
able action was taken by the Senate Com
mittee on Constitutional Amendments to
night which is the first step toward county
home rule. _ he measure which the com
mittee agreed to report is revolutionary in
its scope. If finally passed and approved
, every county in this State will â  have the
privilege of adopting a charter of its own,
of regulating its local elections and fixing
the terms of its officers and their compen
sation. It will do away entirely with the
cumbersome classification system, and
will effectually, it is believe i, put a stop
to the perennial controversies brought be
fore the Legislature , relative to salaries
and fees of county officials and the em
pioyment of deputies. It amends article
11 of the constitution by inserting a new
section, to be known as 7J_Â«
The measure is known as Senate con
stitutional amendment No. 10 and was in
troduced by Senator Stratton. In speak
ing for the measure before the committee"
he stated that no less than fifty news
papers throughout the State, representing
nearly as many counties, were in favor of
the amendment. The measure received
the 'unanimous vote of the committee.
Its full text follows:
The inhabitants of any county may frame a
county government act for their own govern
ment relating to the matters hereinafter speci
fied end consistent with and subject to the
constitution and laws of this Stale by causing
a board of freeholders, who " have been
for at least five years qualified electors
of such county, to be elected by the
qualified electors of such county at any
general or special election, .whose duty it
shall be, within ninety days after such elec
tion, to prepare and propose a county govern
ment act for such county, which shall hs
signed In duplicate by the members of such
board, or a majority of them, and returned
one copy thereof to the Board of Supervisors ot
such county, and the other copy to be sent to
the Recorder of Deeds of the county. Such
proposed county government act shall then be
published in two daily papers, then in one
only, for at least twenty days, and
within not less than thirty days
after such publication it shall be submitted
to the qualified electors of each county, at a
general or special election, and if a majority
of such qualified electors voting thereat shall
ratify the same, it shall thereafter be submit
ted to the Legislature for its rejection or ap
proval, as a whole, without power of altera
tion or amendment, and if approved by a
majority of the members elected, to each
House, it shall be the county government act
of such county, and shall in such case become
the organic law thereof, and supersede any
existing county government act, and all
amendments thereof, and all special laws in
consistent with such county government act.
A copy of such county government act, cer
tified by the president of the Board of Super
visors or chief executive officer of such county,
and authenticated by the seal of such county,
setting forth the submission of such county
government act to the electors, and its ratifi
cation by them, shall be made in duplicate
and deposited, one in the office of the Secretary
of State, the other, after being recorded in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds, in the county
among the archives of the county.
All courts shall take judicial notice thereof.
The county government act so ratified may
be amended at intervals of not less than two
years, by proposals therefor, submitted by the
legislative authority of the county, to the
qualified electors thereof, at a general or
special i lection held at least forty days after, the
publication of such proposals for twenty days
in a daily newspaper of general circulation in
such county, and ratified by at least three
fifths of the qualified electors voting thereat,
and approved by the Legislature as herein
provided for the approval of the county gov
ernment act. In submitting any such county
government act, any alternative article or
proposition may be presented for the choice
of the voters and may be voted on separately
without prejudice to others.
It shall be competent in all county govern
ment acts framed under the authority given
by this section, to provide for the manner in
which, the times at which and the terms for
which the several township and county offi
cers, other than Judges of the Superior Court,
shall be elected or appointed, for their com
pensation, for their respective duties, for
the number of deputies that each
shall have and for the compensation
payable to each of such deputies, for the
manner in which, the.times in which and the
terms for which the members of all boards of
election shall be elected or appointed, and
for the constitution, regulation, compensation
and government of such boards and of their
clerks and attaches; ana also to prescribe the
method by which elections by the people shall
be conducted, whether by ballot or other
wise, provided that secrecy in voting be pre
served. '". !
Whenever any county has, ln the manner and
method herein pointed out, adopted any
county government act, and the same shall
have been approved- by the Legislature as
aforesaid, the directions of sections 4 and 5
of this article, providing for the uniformity of
a system of county governments. throughout
the State, and likewise providing for the elec
tion and. appointment of officers, and the
regulation of their compensation, shall not
apply. Said county government act shall,
however, at all times be subject to general
laws enacted by the Legislature; but it shall
be witnin the power of the Legislature to ex
empt all or any of the counties so adopting
their own .county government acts from the
operation of general laws relating to any of
the matters provided for' in such county
government acts.
STATE TAX FOR BBBKELEX.

session of the Senate Finance and Build
ing Committees and the Assembly Ways
ami Means and Build ing Committees to
hear arguments on the bill asking an ad
ditional 1-cent State tax for the State
University at Berkeley.
Half of the revenue to be thus raised is
to be used to provide temporary structures
in which to ; shelter that portion of the
1554 students now at Berkeley who live in
tents and to provide instructors for them,
and the remaining half-cent lax is to be

BULLA'S R IE IF AJ" BIXjJL.
Introduced on B-half of the Los Angeles
w_ .-.;. . . Consolidated Company. -,v--p.
SACRAMENTO,' Cal.. Jan. 20.â With
a view toward enhancing the value and
thereby facilitating the sale of the street
railway properties owned and controlled
by the Los Angeles Consolidated Railway
Company of Los Angeles, Senator Bulla
introduced an amendment to the Civil
Code which prohibits two lines of street
railways operated under different man
agements from occupying the same street,
streets or tracks for more than five blocks.
The present law reads "five consecutive
blocks," and this gives a competing rail
way the privilege of using the tracks of
another company for any distance, so long
as no more than five consecutive blocks
are utilized on any portion of the road.
Senator Bulla explained that the LO3
Angeles Consolidated Railway Company
recently had a desirable offer for the pur
chase of all its properties from an African
syndicate, and that the existence of the
law which be is seeking to amend pre
vented the sale. ,â '%__!.'
It was pointed out by one of the San
Francisco delegation that tile adoption of
this amendment, whatever its benefit to
Los Angeles might be, would be a very
desirable protective measure for the
Market-street Railway Company of San
Francisco.

The selection of William E. Mason of

The correspondent of the United Asso

thority to-night the President-elect has
not chosen his Secretary of the Treasury
and the position is still out. Edwin Con
ger of lowa, a former member of Congress,
and Minister to Brazil under the Harrison
administration, when he called on the
President-elect, said lowa would like to
have a Cabinet position, and the appoint
ment of James Wilson to be Secretary of
Agriculture is probable. 1 Mr. Wilson is a
practical farmer, and owns and manages
several tine and profitable farms. He is
one of the foremost educators in the
science of agriculture in the country, and

San Francisco, Cal., Jan. 14, 1897.
I, Charles Schill, aged 30, residing at 262
Eighth street, desire to testify to the benefit
and cure that I have experienced by treat-
ment at the STATE ELECTRO-MEDICAL. IN-
STITUTE, corner of Powell, Market and Eddy
streets. â¢-. v; : :"'.;' '
For four years I have been ailing with ner-
vous debility and heart and stomach trouble,
which greatly. hindered me in my work as a
teamster, the business I have pursued for the
past seven years in San Francisco. I suffered
with pain and oppression of the chest and
stomach, shortness of breath, flatulent dyspep-
sia and palpitation of the heart, and alter ex-
ertion would feel weak and nervous. On
January 4. 1897, I app ied for treatment at
the INSTITUTE, where Dr. W. K. Vance made
a careful physical examination, found that my
heart and stomach were both disordered. I
was placed under treatment and at once began
to Improve rapidly and feel like a new man.
The doctor applied electricity and prescribed
certain electric fluids for internal use, also
magnetic oil for external application. These
remedies combined have had a magical effect,
and now, on January 14, I can truthfully say
that my health is fully restored. I am VERY
THANKFUL FOR SUCH A RAPID CURE,
which enables me to pursue my daily work
withont experiencing any exhaustion or wear-
iness. I may add that I derive decided bene-
fit from wearing an Electrical waist appliance
prescribed by Dr. Vance.

A SPANISH TRAIN
Seventeen Officers Are
Made Prisoners and One
Is Hanged.
The Unlucky One a Native of
the Island and a Traitor to
the Cause.
Sharp Lookout for General Fondelieu,
Whose Head Must Pay for His
Many Crimes.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 20.â Passengers
by the steamer Olivette to-night report
that the insurgents near Arranguren last
Saturday night stopped the train bound
from Regla to Guanabacoa and made
prisoners of seventeen Spanish officers,
one of which was a Cuban. They carried
them to Jaruco, where they hanged the
Cuban, and after three days liberated the
Spaniards.
' . The Spaniards are loud in their praise
" of the treatment accorded them by their
captors, whom they claim treated them
as guests and not as prisoners.
The insurgents were on the lookout for
General Fondelieu, the assassin who was
reported to be a passenger on that train.
They were, however, disappointed, as he
had passed the day before. The insur
gents will make short shrift of this officer
if be should fall into their hands, on ac
count of the many murders he has com
mitted recently in Guanabacoa.
Weyler left Havana yesterday to join
the Spanish column operating near Ha
vana.
Eighty-five pacifico* were made prison
ers in Guanabacoa yesterday,

CUB AM WOMEX MALTREATEB.
Shocking Methods Adopted by Weyler in
His Besperation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 20.â Sun
special from Washington says: Senor
Quesada, Charge d'Affaires of the Cuban
legation in this city, says he has received
authoritative information that General
Weyler is foilowin. the tactics that he
employed in the last Cuban war, when he
inflicted all sorts of indignities upon
Cubans. Senor Quesada asserts that
Weyler has the idea that by seizing and
throwing into prison the female relatives
of Cuban leaders he can compel tho-e
leaders to sue for peace. Acting under
his orders, Avecilla, the Governor of
Puerto Principe, has arrested four of the
most prominent ladies in Cuba. Quesada
said this afternoon:
"These ladies, who are the peers of any
women on earth, were dragged through
the streets of Puerto Principe by Spanish
soldiers a3 if they were common crimi
nals, and were thrown into prison. There '
is not a bole in tbe lowest slums of an ;
American city half so filthy or vile as a |
Spanish prison. The ladies were placed '
in an apartment with disorderly women,
who bad evidently been arrested in ad
vance for the purpose of making the in- j
dignity visited upon the ladies all the j
more outrageous.
"From this you can see what Wej |
means by his alleged policy of pacification. j
And this outrage is, we are informed, only
the beginning of a general arrest of every
decent woman in the Cuban cities cow
under Spanish control who is either a rel
ative of a Cuban patriot or who is known
or suspected or suspected of cherishing
sympathy for the Cuban cause.
"Can any one imagine for a moment," i
continued Quesada, "that men with a \
drop of honorable blood in their veins j
will submit to any proposals or overtures j
from a nation liKe Spain, which makes war I
upon her women? Instead of bringing
our leaders submissive to Spain's feet, j
Weyler's present policy will make them j
all the more earnest and vigorous in their I
efforts for freedom.
"And our women would rise themselves '
and denounce our leaders were they to al
low the indignities visited upon them to
weaken the determination to wrest their
homes and liberties from Spanish control.
I hope American men who have mothers
and wives and sisters will ponder and
think over these terrible things and con
i sider whether such a thing should be al
lowed at the very doors of the country."
When questioned as to the blowing up i
of the Spanish gunboat Relampago, Senor j
Quesada said: "That is the best answer j
yet given to ali the rumors regarding j
propositions for home rule that have been j
alleged to emanate from the Cuban lead- 1
ers." . .
CAN OVmIS MAI BESI GX.
Bitcouragsd at If'eylsr's Failure to
Crush the Revolution.
LONDON, Esq.. Jan. 20.â Tbe Daily
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Paris saying that it is reported there
that Senor Canavos del Castillo, the Span
ish Premier, has stated to his friends that
if General Weyler does not succeed in
crushing the revolution in Cuba by the
time the rainy season sets in he (Canovas)
will resign.
Ttie writer of the dispatch adds that
negotiations were being carried on be
tween Washington and Spain for a settle

dismayed by a dispatch from Washington
intimating that Secretary Olney had not
time to settle the war and would leave it
for the administration of President Mc-
Kinley.
HEXRY BEL.GtDti'B DEATH.
Due to Exposure and < ruel Treatment
in f Ã¼ban Prisons".
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 20.-The
death of Henry Deleado, which is an
nounced in a Havana dispatch received at
the State Department at Washington to
day, was primarily due to exposure me
diately after he landed in Cuba. He
tramped nearly 300 miles through the
billy country around Pinar del Rio and
became so thoroughly exhausted that he
was ta_en down with fever.
He sought refuge in one of the huts
which the insurgents used as held hos
pitals, where he was captured by the
Spaniards under command of General
Melguizo. The Spanish general gave or
ders that the correspondent should be
killed on the spot, as two of his com
panions had been. He discovered the
"identity of the sick man, and fearing
further complications with the United
States Governmentâ as he was the same
soldier who assaulted the venerable Jose
Delgado, which has resulted in a claim
against the Spanish Governmentâ the
prisoner's life was spared.
He was sent to Havana with word that
he might possibly be Piero Delgado, one
of Maceo's lieutenants, for wbom a reward
of $5000 had been offered: The young man
was sent to San Ambrosia Hospital, where
he developed an abscess of the liver, and it
was decided that the operation of -laparot
omy would have to be performed as a
last resort to save his life. The operation
was performed, and thou Delgado sur
vived several days, he succumbed as a
result of the fever.
Mr. Delgado was born in this city and
lived nearly all bis life here in Brooklyn.
He was educated in ihe Carlisle Institute.
He married Miss Granger of Hudson, N.
V., some years ago. His widow is now in
New York. They have one child. C. B.
Grone, a brother-in-law of Delgado, will
see that the body is embalmed and sent to
New York.
_I.\KJ.V. OF IHE RELAMPAGO.
Cubans Rejoicing Over the Bestruction
of the Spanish Gunboat.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 20.â Glad tid
ing to Cubans in this city were those
which yesterday announced the sinking
of the Spanish gunboat Relampago by
means of a torpedo while the ship was
hurrying to the assistance of the garrison
of Fort Guamo, on the Cuato River, the
most important inland waterway of the
island.
Three weeks ago a letter was received
in tnis city in wbich the writer said that
the delay in beginning war upon Spain's
patrol fleet was due to the blunder of
those who shipped the wire and the
generator of electricity to be used in ex
ploding torpedoes. The mistake had
been rectified, and that the material
reached its destination safely is proved by
the destruction of the Relampago on
Saturday of last week.
A gentleman who knows the electrician
who accomplished the first marine victory
for Cuba libre said last night:
"The man under whose supervision the
insurgents have begun war on Spain's
gunboats is thoroughly proficient in elec
trical engineering, and I believe this new
departure will result in the loss of many
more of Spain's gunboats."
"Do you believe that torpedoes can be
placed in waters adjacent to Havana?"
"That will not be attempted. The field
of operations is sufficiently broad without
attempting what would be foolish. The
torpedo service will devote its energy ex
clusively to rivers navigated by the Span
ish gunboats and to the unprotected an
chorages to which they retreat at night.
There are more than forty war vessels of
different kinds in Cuban waters. They
are seldom in Havana harbor. They will
be easy game when once our torpedo ser
vice has become in a degree perfected. I
shall be disappointed If we do not hear of
other successful attacks upon Spain's fleet
within the coming fortnight,"
SMALLPOX AmM> MALARIA.
Alarming Conditions in Cuba That
Manm-ss Thi*. Country.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 20.â Advices
to the Sun from Havana say: There are
2063 cases of smallpox in Havana. At
Guanajay, in Pinar del Rey province,
which has only 10,000 inhabitants, there
are 4067 cases. Smallpox and malaria are
also ravaging the country, and it may be
safely said that the sanitary condition of
Cuba is far a greater danger to the United
States than the much-feared bubonic
plague of India. Cuba is close to our
' coasts and there is daily communication
I between tbe island and the mainland.
At the end of March the depressing
warm weather begins here, and then
diseases of a contagious nature spread
twice as fast as during the winter. Cuba
is now a focus of diseases and may become
a source of danger to the whole world.
The smallpox was introduced here by
the 200,000 soldiers from Spain. The
J Spanish common people are not cleanly
in their habits, and, moreover, they come
to Cuba crowded by thousands in tne
j dirty steamers of the Campania Trans-
Atlantica, in which no well-bred Ameri
can would travel if he could possibly help
it. Under sucn conditions, these soldiers
land in this city, where there is no .ewer
age system.
There is no hope of improvement in
this state of things under Spanish domi
nation. The municipal laws do not allow
the city councils to take any steps in the
matter without authorization from the
captain general, who must affix his signa
ture to any loan raised for sanitary works,
and, furthermore, the municipalities are
all in the hands of Spaniards, most of
whom have not the least notion of hy
gienic requirements.
CALIFORNIA'S SYMPATHY.
Two Joint Resolutions Reported to the
Legislature.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 20.â The
following joint resolution was to-day re
ported by the Assembly Committee on
Federal Relations:
Fesolred, That while we extend our warmest
sympathy to the Cubans in their heroic strug
gle for independence we deem it inopportune
at this time to offer advica to the Federal Gov
ernment as to the treatment of a grave Na
tional question, but have full confidence that
the National administration will deal with It
in a manner which will not only secure the
desired end, but reflect honor and credit on
the United States.
Assemblyman Dryden reported a sub
stitute as a minority report as follows:
Whereas, The inhabitants of Cuba have for
years been struggling to achieve national in
dependence and to secure the free exercise of
those inalienable rights to which all men are
entitled unaer the laws of God and nature:
and, whereas, under the principles which un
derlie the doctrine of human rights we recog
nize our duty as American citizens to extend
sympathy and aid, if need b_, to all
who oppose despotic oppression and strive to
establish a republican form of government
in the western hemisphere; and, whereas, the
methods of warfare which have been and now
are being carried on for the suppression of the
Cubans are contrnry to the established usage
of war and a stigma upon the Christian civili
zation of the nineteenth century: therefore,
be it ' ::'J::.J\'-' .J-^-"-:, â 
Resolved. By the Assembly of the State of
California, the Senate concurring therein, that
we favor the recognition by the Government
of the United States of the rights of the Cubans
as belligerents.
Resolved, That the chief cleric of this Assem
bly transmit copies of these resolutions to the
Senators and Representatives in Congress
from the State of California.
Both resolutions were ordered trans
mitted to the printer.
Corbett Finds a Giant.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â James J. Corbett,

by Pettigrew (Si!.) of South Dakota, to
Hill's request and the bill was taken up
and passed:
The bill as passed appoints five citizens
of New York City as building commis
sioners at $5000 a year. The building is to
be on the present Custom-house site. The
Secretary of the Treasury is to lease suit
able premises for the temporary custom
bouse, $250,000 being appropriated for
rental for the first year. The entire cost
of the building is not to exceed $5,000,000.
Morgan's bill as to the default on the
part of the Pacific roads was permitted to
go over without action.
The resolution heretofore offered by
Pettigrew (SU.) of South Dakota, calling
on the Secretary of State for a copy of the
proceedings of the commission on the
divisional line between Venezuela and
Guiana, was called up and Pettigrew dis
cussed it. At the conclusion of Petti
grew's speech it was referred to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.
Tbs Senate joint resolution as to the
laying of electric subways in the District
of Columbia, on which Hill (D.) of New
York had spoken at leDgth yesterday, was
taken up, and Faulkner (D.) of West Vir
ginia, a member of the District commit
tee, addressed the Senate, defending the
action of the committee and denying tne
charges made against it yesterday by
Hill. There were several short and rather
angry dialogues between Senators Faulk
ncr and Hill in the course oi Faulkner's
speech.
At 2 o'clock the presiding officer laid be
fore the Senate the unfinished business
the Nicaragua canal billâ and Turpie (D.)
of Indiana resumed bis speech in opposi
tion to it. He likened the provisions of
the bill to the case of bogus mortgages
and to the successful looting of credulous
people by such means. The operation
proposed in the pending bill, be said, dif
fered from the bogus mortgage -case only
in the fact that the canal company on the
face of the bill submitted to the Senate
had no title to the lands : which it
proposed to surrender; that it had no in
terest in them and that it could not trans
fer them to any one. The company asked
Congress, with its eyes open and knowing
that the security was straw, to give it a
hundred million dollars, guaranteeing
payment by a lien on securities that were
utterly without value on "Peter Funk"
securities.
Turpie asserted that through the failure
of the company to complete within three
years ' the connecting link known
as tbe Managua canal it bad al
ready forfeited everything, had already
surrendered everything; that it had either
voluntarily or negligently given up and
abandoned its concession. It Had not
even pretended to construct the Managua
canal. No act of Congress could release
the company from its obligation under
the. cession. It was an unreasonable de
mand, an irrational request, a thoroughly
lunatic proposition, that Congress should
guarantee the performance ol the work, or
should enter upon its construction, with
out having an estimate of the cost of the
three principal items necessary to its
prosecution â the Managua canal and the
construction of two harbors.
After .â¢'peaking for two hours, Turpie
closed his remarks for the day, but de
clined to promise that he would "finish his
speech to-morrow, and the bill went over.
Chandler (R. ) of New Hampshire asked
and obtained unanimous consent to nave
the bill for representation of the United
States at an international monetary con
ference with foreign countries taken up
after the morning hour on Tuesday next.
The District appropriation bill and the
i provision ac to the library of Congress was
acted upon. The first amendment offered
by the committee was an appropriation of
$5000 for the salary of the librarian, who
is to be appointed by the President, and
by and with the advice and consent of tne
Senate, and providing that the librarian
shall make rules and regulations for the
government of the library to be approved
by the L brary Committee. The admend
ment was approved.
Another important amendment by the
committee was the insertion of an item
appointing a custodian of the building
and grounds at a salary of $5000 and appro
priating $46,440 for the custody and care
of the building and grounds. Other
amendments -in relation lo the library
were agreed to, and after Call (D.) of
Florida had argued against the policy of
leaving to the President the appointment
of the librarian and superintendent, the
bill was passed.
, A joint resolution, authorizing the
Smithsonian Institution to participate in
the exhibition of gas apparatus in Madi
son-square Garden, New York City, from
January 27 to February _.6, offered by
Bryce (D. of Ohio, was parsed, and the
Senate at 5 o'clock adjourned.
SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
Interesting Debate Over the lost-Tucker
Contest for a Seal.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 20.â The
Speaker laid before the House to-day a
bill authorizing the Cairo and Tennessee
River Railroad Company to build a bridge
across the Cumberland and Tennessee
rivers in Kentucky, with Senate amend
ments, which were concurred in.
Under the call of committees,' the Sen
ate resolution authorizing the Secretary
of War to pension. telegraph operators in
the army during the war, or giving repre
sentativesof deceased operators'certificates
setting forth their term and condition of
service was considered and passed. -,'.'"
The House bill to reduce from, 10 to 15
cents per folio of 100 words the fees of the
Land Office for taking depositions in con
tests, and reducing the fees of land offices
in the Pacific and Rocky Mountain States
to the same as are paid officers of the same
classes in other States (which are now 50
per cent higher), was passed. The same
ill practically was passed at tbe last'ses
sion, and was vetoed by the President. \
Tbe House then proceeded to the con
f
sideration of the contested election ca c
of Yost vs. Tucker for the seat in the
Fifty- fourth Congress from the Tenth dis
trict of Virginia. The majority of the
committee reported in favor of Tucker.
Walker (R.) of Pennsylvania and Bur
rows (D.) of Michigan dissented and
recommended the seating of Yost. The
question at issue was as to the counting
of certain imperfectly marked ballots.
The election was the first one held under
the Walton Australian ballot law of Vir
ginia. *
Codding (R.) cf Pennsylvania made the
first spepcn in favor of the committee's
report. Codding was followed by the con
testant. Representative-elect Yost, who in
concluding a fervent appeal for justice
said: ' *'â¢'.'.
"The stigma of foul elections has dis
graced and debased the South for years;
its 1 yearly influence has, paralyzed the
public consci.nc; but now, thank God,
in Virginia at least, the shock of this
election has roused the people from their
stupor. 7 â¢ \1;
"The fear of negro rule has disappeared;
but despite the scourge of public opinion
the guilty, tricksters still dare to bring
their infamy to the doors of Congress. If
you accept the result of their machina
tions you prove their methods and give
them" fresh license."
Jenkins (R.) of Wisconsin said that he
and threu other Republican members of
the Election Committee had come to the
conclusion that the contestee (Tucker)
was entitled, to retain his seat, and this
conclusion he , intended to defend and
maintain even if afterward he was called
a Massachusetts mugwump. [Laughter.]
Grosvenor (R.) ol Ohio } spoke for Yost.
He argued that the House was not to be
circumscribed in the exercise of its right
to inquire into the election of its members
by a State statute. He stated that the
case was full of fraud, despite the state
ments to the contrary, and he appealed to
members not to sustain it by their votes.
If they did they should never again prate
of the lack of purity of elections in the
South. His speech was frequently inter
rupted by applause on the part of his Re
publican colleagues.
Daniel (R.) of New. York, chairman of
Elections Committee 1, made a strictly
legal argument to sustain the conclusions
of the minority of the committee that the
House was justified in using the ballot to
determine the intention of the voter, not
withstanding the requirements of the
State law. ,
. ;At the conclusion of Daniel's speech the
election case was temporarily set aside,
and Hull (R.) of lowa reported a partial
agreement oi the conferees on the army
appropriation bill. It was agreed to, and
the House insisted upon its disagreement
to the Senate amendments still in dis
pute.
,It was agreed that a vote on the con
tested election case betaken at 4:30 o'clock
to-morrow.
â  At 5:05 the House adjourned until to
morrow.
SENDS BUT FOUR NOTES.
Secretary Olney's Response to the Senate's
Demand for Arbitration Treaty
Correspondence.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 20.â 1n his
confidential message to the Senate trans
mitting the correspondence in connection
with the general treaty of arbitration,
Secretary Olney sends but four notes, and
he says that this is all the correspondence
; between the United States and â¢ Great
Britain relating to the general treaty of
arbitration. He adds also that no corre
spondence "in regard to the treaty has
taken place with other powers.". '.J'\-Jf.
Although the correspondence was sent
to the Senate with the seal of secrecy and
is carefully guarded by the committee, it
can be authoritatively stated that there is
no need for Mr. Olney's solicitude in this
respect. Every one of the four notes trans
mitted to the Senate has been given to the
public in these dispatches, at least iv sub
stance. . .'â ' . '.-'-J ...
'Â.' The first of the quartet is Lord Salis
bury's note to Sir Julian Pauncefote of
March 5, 1896.. in which, in connection
with the Venezuelan question, he reopens
the subject of a foreign treaty and sub
mits six beads for a treaty.
Then follows Mr. Olney's note of April
11, 1896, in reply to which he rejects arti
cles IV and V of the proposed treaty, and
substitutes a "new article IV, which in its
essential. points agrees with that article
in the treaty before the Senate.
On May 18 Lord Salisbury, replying to
Sir Julian, ?ays after some reference to
Venezuela and other questions that might
be brought under a general treaty of arbi
tration:
In this view I am plaesed toobserve that I
agree with Mr. Olney, because I hold that in
discussing the safeguards by which a general
system of arbitration should be sanctioned it
is important -to bear in mind that any system
adopted between our two nations ought to be
such as can in principle be applied if neces
sary to their relations with other civilized
countries. .
Touching upon that article ot the treaty
with respect to the mode of dealing with
territorial claims, it was apparent in tbis
note that the two Governments were still
apart. - Mr. Olney insisted that every
claim ,to territory against another
should go, as o ' right, before a
tribunal of arbitration, save in -certain
cases, solemnly declared by the Legisla
ture of each, country to involve the
National honor and integrity, and such
dispute shall be final and irrevocably de
cided without reservation of any further
powers to either party to interfere.
IMPORTANT TO MARINERS.
The President Signs a Bill of the Utmost
Interest to Masters and Pilots in
Large Harbors.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 20.âPresi
dent Cleveland to-day signed a bill which
is of the utmost interest to masters of all
vessels in large harbors. It is the bill pro
viding that all vessels requiring engineers
and pilots above fifteen tons burden, car
rying ; freight or passengers for hire and
propelled by gas, fluid, naphtha, or elec
tric motors, shall be made subject to all
Federal laws relating to the inspection of
hulls and boilers and providing that all
vessels shall bo made to conform to
all Federal laws relating to the regulations
of steam vessels passing each other, and
to such further relations regarding fog
signals, lights, steering and sailing rules
as the Board of Supervising Inspectors of
Steam Vessels shall deem neces_rry.
This new law will be welcomed by the
masters and pilots of all vessels coming
into or leaving large ports like San Fran
cisco. ', Heretofore steam or naphtha
.launches, such as this bill now affects,
have been practically "free launches"
entirely exempt from all duties or laws,
and subject apparently to the whim of the
man who was in command. They were
constant sources of danger both to' them
selves and to larger vessels which they
met, and pilots and masters have for a
long time been endeavoring to bring
about some legislation which will fasten
upon these - little craft responsibilities
equal to those now borne by large vessels.
The law goes into eff?ct at once.
SIGNIFYING THE FLAG.

ALBANY, N.T.; Jan. 20.â The Senate

mittee -of three Senators and four As

HAWAII'S HOPE
IS IN CONGRESS
Monthly Meetings of the
Annexation Club at
Honolulu.
i _________
Immediate Assistance Not Ex
pected From President
McKinley.
Contract Labor to Be Abolished in
Hawaiiâ Population of Honolulu
Is About 30,000.
HONOLULU. Hawaii, Jan. 13.â The
first of a series of meetings under tbe
auspices of the Annexation Club was held
in tne drill-shed last evening. . Important
speeches bearing on the annexation ques
tion were made by Hon. Henry E. Cooper,
Minister of Foreign Affairs; L. A. Thurs
ton, ex- Hawaiian Minister at Washing
ton ; Senator McCandless and Representa
tive Robertson of the Hawaiian Legisla
ture; P. C. Jones, ex-Minister of Finance,
and others.
President Dole, Attorney-General Smith
and all the leading Government officials
were present, . together with about 400
leading men of the city.
The gathering was in no sense a mass
meeting, but only a called meeting of the
club, which has about 2000 names on its
membership roll. Minister Cooper said:
The attitude of the Government has been
and still is annexation to the United States of
America. ,
While in the United* States recently I had
the opportunity- of hearing much that is en
couraging to those who believe in annexation.
First of all, it is not likely that the question
will become a party issue; the proposition will
be advocated by Republicans and Democrats
alike, while opponents will be found in the
ranks of both parties. The question is likely
to be heard upon its merits. There seems no
desire to recede from the Senate- resolution of
1893. 839-E
i The division of opinion comes upon the
question of annexation or the maintenance of
the present status. The lines seem to be more
sharply drawn upon this question than ever
before. Â«â .Â» r .
The fact that we have shown ourselves
capable of self-government has strengthened
our position to a large extent. Although the
danger has been that some might consider it
best to let well enough alone, yet the more
general vie is that the question should not
be left any longer in abeyance and has finally
settled in favor of annexation.
While many of the opponents of annexation
in the United States have based their opposi
tion upon the policy of the Government here
tofore, thai no territory should be acquired
which is not a part of the American conti
nent, many now say that they consider that
an exception to this rule should be made in
the case of Hawaii. The reason lor this Is that
Hawaii has become too important a factor in
controlling the commerce of the Pacific to be
left where it might go under the control of
another power. ,"-r ';.â¢
The occupation of Pearl Harbor is considered
by those who favor a progressive foreign,
policy to be essential. Annexation is now a
question of business, not of sentiment. :'"' r '
It is most likely that' a special j session of
Congress will be called soon after the inaug
uration of the new President and annexation
brought forward.
Senator McCandless made an important
announcement, which foreshadows im
portant legislation. He said:
Sugar men oppose annexation on account of
contract labor. I wish to say as a member of
the Hawaiian Senate, gentlemen, that in the
next session of that body the contract law will
be repealed, and from that time we will have
free labor on the plan of American institutions
and American industries. [Tremendous ap
plause.] When this has been accomplished I
do not see how any sugar man can oppose
annexation. The question has been asked,
"What will annexation do for the Hawaiian?"
This much: The Hawaiians have never been
taught what Americans term self-respect, and
what is called by the modern schoolmaster
"character-building." The Hawaiians are
treated as children to-day, precisely as they
were three-quarters of a century ago. We meet
them and if the man strikes our. fancy and
asks for it we will give him a quarter, and he
goes off and buys a me'ki. No man who has
learned what self-respect is will receive money
unless he has earned it or gives an equivalent.
The Hawaiian is not to be blamed for this; he
bas never yet been taught differently, but with
the infusion of new blood which will follow
annexation the rising generation will learn it
by contact.
President Hon. L. A. Thurston said:
If any one class in this. country needs an
nexation it is the sugar- planters. The United
States treasury is in need ot $30,000,000 to
meet an annual deficit. Protection to sugar is
bound to be in the tariff. A bounty will uot
do, because it takes money out of the treasury,
The sugar-planter in Hawaii to-day is like a
man driving along the brink of a precipice.
We had a reciprocity treaty which expired in
1894. It has benn liable ever since to termi
nate at one year's notice from either side.
According to the report of the superin
tendent of the census, made public to
day, the population of Honolulu by na
tionalities is: Americans 2074, British 1308,
Germans 578. French 69, Norwegians 179,
Portuguese 3833, other races 366, Japanese
2381. Chinese 7693, South Sea Islanders

Captain Howison of the Oregon About to
Be Made a Rear Admiralâ His
Probab c Successor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 20.-A Herald
special from Washington says: Nine offi
cers who are now in command of ships
will be detached within the next few
months ano given shore duty. The most
important command that will become
vacant is the battle-ship Oregon. Captain
H. L. Howison, who now commands
her, is No. 1 on the list of captains and will
be promoted to flag rank when Rear Ad
miral J. G. Walker retires in March.
He will be detached a few days before
his promotion. It has not vet been de
cided where he will then be stationed.
His friends are anxious that he should
succeed Rear Admiral Beardslee in com
mand of Pacific station, but Commodore
George Dewey, it is understood, has prac
tically beeu promised that assignment,
and Commodore Howison will probably
have to take a shore station until a sea
billet becomes vacant. The officer most
prominently mentioned to succeed Cap
tain Howison in command of the Oregon
is Captain A. S. Barker.

'-â -* â â â 
. AMITE CITY, La.. Jan. 20.â Three ne
gro murderers, John Johnson, Arch
Joiner and Gus Williams, were taken from
jail and lynched by a mob in this place
about 3 o'clock this mornine.
Johnson and Joiner, according to thÂ«
confession of the former, were guilty of
the murder of five members of the Cotton
family some time ago. Williams was
awaiting trial for murdering his wife.
Early in the night, when it became
known that John Johnson and Arch
Joiner, charged with the Cotton family
murders, would be lynched, groups of
strangers from every section of this and
adjoining parishes began to arrive. They
held low conversations on the street cor*
ner-. The night was a most miserable
one, rainy and gloomy.
About 9 o'clock there were perhaps 250
people on the street, when suddenly some
150 men on horses galloped up to the jail,
and having found the deputy who had
charge, forced him to open the jail door
and also open the steel cages. They then
took from the cages the three colored
men. The mob made no hostile demon
strations. After procuring their men they
held a short consultation and decided to
bang Gus Williams to an oak tree near
the negro church, on the outer edge of
town. A rope was quickly adjusted over
a large limb with one end around Wil
liams' neck. Williams was made to get'
on a horse. The horse was struck with a
whip and jumped from under Williams.
His neck was broken and his body was
jerked down.
Williams disposed of, the crowd started
on the long march to John Cotton's
house, where the murders were com
mitted. The distance traveled was twelve
miles, through a heavy rain. There were
nearly 200 in the crowd during the march.
Arch Joiner prayed a great deal, but
Johnson was quiet and sullen.
After four hours the * Cotton residence
was reached, and all dismounted. Joiner
made a desperate break for liberty, but
was captured before he had gone very far.
Joiner and Johnson began cursing each
other, and asked permission from the
crowd to settle their dispute in prize-ring
style, which was granted.
The fight lasted about five minutes.
Johnson, although the smaller man, had
considerably the test of the fight when
they separated.
They were then taken into the Cotton
house and efforts were made to get a full
confession from them. John Johnston
stuck to bis former statement tbat Arch
Joiner was the man who committed the
murders.
. Joiner stoutly maintained bis innocence
for a while, but finally confessed that he
killed Mrs. John Cotton, Miss Agnes Mil
ler and Miss Lizzie Miller. A discussion
then arose as to the best way to dispose of
the murderers.
Some were in favor of burning them,
and tires were made for that purpose; but
better judgment prevailed, and it was
finally decided to hang tbem. This was
done, and their bodies riddled with bul
lets. It was Arch Joiner's earnest request
tbat he be shot to death, and this was de
cided upon as the mode of death to be
meted out to Joiner; but at the last
moment, after the fire had been started, it
was urged that he be banged, as Gus Wil
liams had been. They were taken a half
mile from the Cotton residence and.
strung up. They both implicated two
other negroes. All is quiet now.

Populists Switch to a New Candidate,
But Fail to Gain N*ed-d
Accessi ns
BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 20.â The Populists
in the State Legislature switched again
to-day and cast their votes for a new can
didateâJ. W. Ballentine. Two ballots
were taken. On the first Ballentine (Pop.)
received 28 and on the second 26. Dubois
received 26 on botb. J. C. Rogers (Pop.)
received 13 votes on the first ballot, cast
by Democrats, and on the second they
left Rogers and went to Lewis (Pop.), who
got 14. â¢
It is claimed to-night that R. Z. John
son, the Democratic candidate, will with
draw in favor of Dubois. The "pull"
among the Democratic leaders outside of
the Legislature is very strong for Dubois,
but so far it has been unable to make an
impression. Governor Steunenburg is
credited with being the most powerful
factor in preventing accessions to the
Dubois column.
URN EM GAI THREE VOTES.
But lwo Washington Legislators Cast !
Ballots for .Squire.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 20.â Three bal
lots were taken in joint session for United
States Senator, with no choice and with
but little change from yesterday. Squire
does not show, his expected strength. He
got but two votes to-day. Turner, free
silver Republican, gained three votesâ one
from the Democrats and two Irom the
Populists. It is claimed several more will
come to him to-morrow. Cline shows fur
ther strength. The vote to-day was:
Baker 5. Cline 15, Davis 9, Daniels 12,
Denny 26, Squire _, Turner 21, Winsor 9,
scattering 10.
The Turner men are trying to secure a
caucus, but the Populists are afraid of it.
The call issued on Monday for a caucus,
requiring seventy-five names, is not mate
rializing. The Populists claim to have
forty-two signers pledged to support only
a middle-of-the-road Populist, which
would prevent Turner's election, but this
number is not enough for the election of a
Populist, as fifty-seven are required for a
choice.
Bribery Charges at Salem.
SALEM, Or., Jan. 20.â House met
this evening, but gave no sign of settling
its differences. Efforts were made during
the day to bring about a : reconciliation,
but without any visible effect. The oppo
sition forces declare that concessions must
come from the "regulars," and that if
Bourne is elected Speaker everything
afterward will be smooth sailing.* The
members' pay ceased on Friday last. Ugly,
charges of attempts at bribery are rile to
day, and while they are believed to hs
true in a measure, they cannot be sub
stantiated. Many look, forward to an
organization to-morrow morning.

SANTA ROSA PEOPLE WEAR*.
Old Water Question Comes Up Again in
an Amended Complaint.
SANTA ROSA. Cat.., Jan. 20. ---The in
terminable and vexations water question
bobs up serenely again to-day in an
amended complaint of seventy-one type
written pages, with Mark L. McDon
ald as plaintiff and the city as
a corporation with about half of its in
habitants individually, as defendants.
This complaint, as usual, wants the water
bonds declared void and the contract an
nulled. MB_P_BP_CPtB
It also asks that the bonds be recalled
and resold, or if not recovered that the
water works be valued by the
court and that judgment for the
difference between the actual value
and the amount paid be entered against
the individual delendants and in favor of
the city ; also tbat the city be required to
enter a separate appearance and plead in
its own behalf.
That the citizens and taxpayers of this
long-suffering municipality are heartily
tired of this sensational litigation goes
without saying, and strenuous efforts will
be made to stop any further steps in this
direction. ______________________
CHILD BURNED TO DEATH

Flames.
A Death From Asphyxiation Caused
by a Defedive Gas Fixtureâ Other
Cases for the Coroner.
The death by fire of little Katie Kear
ney, the three-year-old daughter of John
Kearney, was reported to the Coroner early
yesterday morning. The child lived with
its parents at their home, 23 Freelon
street.
About 5 o'clock Tuesday afternoon the j
child was playing about the kitchen ]
while the evening meal was being pre- i
pared. While the attention of the
mother was attracted elsewhere the child j
approached the fire and her dress became j
ignited. ' The mother succeeded in ex- !
tinguishing the flames, but not until tbey
had inflicted injuries that proved fatal. j
The entire body of the little one was i
terribly burned. " A physician who was j
summoned could only soothe the pain a \
little during the few hours -that the child i
lived. The, Coroner held no inquest, as it i
| was clearly a case of accidental death. \ : â¢ j
Martin Kerr was discovered dead- in his j
I bed at 662 Harrison street at 8 o'clock yes
terday morning. Death resulted from as- !
phyxiation. On retiring, the deceased had
turned out the gas and turned it on again, j
the little plug mat prevents the key from !
turning round having lallen out. The de- |
ceased was 64 years of age and unmarried. ;
Kerr was in the habit of using candles, be- |
cause of his fear of death from the use of ;
j:as. Last evening lie found that he had
no candle and told the landlady that
rather than go out again he would use the !
gas
David Morrissey, a fireman, 48 years of \
' age, was found dead yesterday morning at
Bartel place and Broadway, within hall a j
block of his borne, 335 Broadway. He re- [
turned yesterday irom a trip on the i
steamer Willamette. He .left his home
at 7:30 Tuesday evening, saying to his j
wife that he would be home early. He is i
said to have had considerable money on j
bis person that was missing when the |
body was found, and his wife believes that j
he met with foul play. No marks of vio- j
lence were found on the body.
PIUTES ON DECK.

The Piute Indians have arrived, and
when they get the kinks out of their limbs
they will be ready to show Mr. St. Sure
and his great Alert team what they pro
pose to' do for the people of San Francisco.
The long ride made them a little stiff, but
a few hours of Piute Indian baseball prac
tice at Central Park will no doubt make
them as good as new.
In their practice yesterday morning I
they only threw the ball around, to tim- |
ber up their arms, but the pace was very j
fast lor men just opening un after a vaca- i
tion. The battery is entirely new to the I
rest of the team, having been brought !
from the Indian reservation." The agent
who came with them says the pitcher is
very fast and will prove a great puzzler to
many of tbe batsmen of this Ciiy.
They seem to have no care for their
arms by the way tbev handled them- j
selves. When Captain Roberts was spoken
to in regard to this prodigality of effort
he said it would not hurt any of them
however hard they worked. As a curios
ity they are expected to be a drawing
card, for every time they appear on the
street a cortege is sure to follow. Here is

inquire into the management of the troop.

HUMANE SOCIETIES
AT THE CAPITAL
Various Proposed * Bills to
Be Formulated Into

Sentiment for Making the Dock

Felony.
-
The Convention Disapproved of Con
solidating Children's and
Animals' Societies.
.. SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 20. â The
convention of the humane societies of the
State met in this city to-day, representa
tives from twelve different counties being
present. The meeting was called to order
by G. H. Smith, and J. A. Woodson deliv
ered the address of welcome.
C. R. Holbrook, president of the San
Francisco Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, was elected president.
There were 5 present: C. R. Holbrook,
Frank B. (jtibson and Martin J. Stevens,
of the San Francisco Animal Society ; Mrs.
David B. Withington of thu Children
and Animal societies of San Diego, Wil
liam Harvey of the Fresno society, Sen
ator Boyce of the Santa Barbara Animal
Society, Mrs. Lydia A. . Prescott of
Oakland, of the California Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children; B. R. Banning of the
Oakland Animal Society, Mrs. Jennie
T. Loomis of the San Joaquin societies,
Mrs. F. R. Shatter tf the San Jose socie
ties, George H. Smith, J. A. Woodson, R.
M. Clarken. lsador Schad, W. D. Law
ton, Dan -Miller, J. W. Beebe and
wife, B. T. Trefy, ot the Sacramento
societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, and Mrs. Tufts, Mrs. Felter,
Mrs. Parsons,. Mrs. George Smith, Mrs.
Ferris, Mrs. C. R. Smith, Mrs. Hubbard,
Mrs. Cushman and Messrs. Simon and
Erlewine, of the 1 Sacramento Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children;
Rev. Mr. Daniels, Adjutant-General Bar
rett and Marsden Manson.
Mr. Gibson of San Francisco stated that
the purpose of the convention was for con
certing measures for forwarding the aims
of the society, and that he had prepared a
bill to be presented to the Legislature,
and understood tbat others present had
i measures to present, and moved that a
committee be appointed by the president
and secretary to compare the various
bills and formulate from thera one to be
presented to the Legislature. The follow
ing were selected for that purpose: Messrs.
Gibson, Woodson, Clarken. Loomis, Hol
brook, Shatter, Boyce, George Smith,
Simons, Senator Prescott, Mrs. Withing
ton and Mrs. Banning. ;;,Y
Smith of Sacramento was in favor of
consolidating the societies for the preven
tion of cruelty to animals and of
prevention of cruelty to children, and also
to effect a State organization.
The idea of consolidation, however, did
not meet with the approval of the
majority, and the idea was abandoned.
Li In speaking of. the subject Mrs. Preston
of Oakland said that the identification of
children's work 'with the cruelty to ani
mal society. had been a total failure in
Eastern cities. She also said thai in Oak
land the fact that the secretary of the
children's society was also Poundraaster
reflected badly upon the society itself.
Mr. Woodson called attention to that
; section of Jaw allowing liquor to be sold to
children with the consent of the parents,
! and it was agreed to endeavor to have the
j section repealed and have one introduced
| instead making it a misdemeanor for a
I parent to take a child into a saloon or
j place where liquor is sold.
Mr. Woodson then stated that $2000 is
i needed to prosecute the work of the Hu
i mane Society. He also said that the Sac
[ ramento society had done what no other
i society in tbe State has done, and that
was to send a procuress to the State prison.
Adjutant-General Barrett appeared and
said he had been requested by the Gov
ernor to attend the meeting and extend
the executive's regrets that he was unable
to attend, and also that be would do all in
i his power to forward the aims of the so
ciety.
; Woodson claimed that a scheme was on
foot to have the law prohibiting rat and
do.' fights repealed during the latter part
of the legislative session and suggested
that measures be taken to defeat this
action. He also thought it advisable to
present as few bills as possible, as they
would pass more readily. Considerable
discussion arose on the subject of for
feitures, and Gibson of San Francisco said
that while the law gave to the society the
fines.it did not include the forfeiture., and
that violators took advantage of this in
order to defeat the society. -'4Pfl_Â§
He was not favor of too many , bills be
ing brought to the attention of the Legis
lature, but was in favor of having this
matter of forfeitures being given to the
society made one of the few. Numerous
other matters were discussed and the con
vention adjurned until evening in order to
allow the committee on laws to make its
report. On reconvening the report was
submitted.
. The first clause directed Constables and
officers to make arrests, they heretofore
having only been empowered to bo do.
Section 16, relating to old, maimed and
diseased animals, allowing them to be
killed by officers, or taken care of at the
expense of their owners, is to be amended
by striking out the" words "old, maimed
and diseased," leaving the word "ani
mals." Ei_____pw69l
This was done in order to cover similar
cases to that of 'White Hat" McCarty,
who, it was stated, refused to care for
horses which were starving to death.
A clause was recommended empowering
officers to breafe into barns in order to
succor distressed animals, a clause giving
all forfeitures as Well 'as tines to the so
ciety and one allowing Boards of Super
visors to set- aside a sum not to exceed
$100 per month for the benefit of the so
ciety. Mr. darken of Sacramento said
the last amendment was the bill passed
by the last Legislature and which the Gov
ernor forgot, to sign.'
â¢Also a clause' making it a misdemeanor
to dock a horse's tail. Attorney Beckwith
of Sacramento was in favor of making it a
felon y, as he said it was only the rich who
curtailed their animals' iiy brush, and a
tine would' perhaps have but few terrors
for many!
The next amendment was sat on de
cidedly, It was to compel any one to kill
an agr-d or infirm animal at the option of
any officer's demand. '
Mrs. Preston of Oakland thought this
measure*' too arbitrary. There are many
people, she said; who are willing to pro
vide for aged household pets and oti.er
animals for the good they have done in
the past, and should any officer have &â 
grudge against any one he could, under
the:, provisions of .this amendment, order
the death of perhaps a valued favorite on
slight pretense. â¢ .
The amendments for the children's so
ciety were then presented, providing for
appointment of badge officers, and giving
them authority, to make arrests and call
for help as other officers do. Carried. :
An amendment not allowing minor
children in saloons even when accom
panied by their parents was also consid
ered with favor.
... A.pew committee of five, consisting of
Misses Beckwith, Clarken and Gibson and
Mesdames Prescott and Loomis, was then
appointed to draft all amendments for
presentntion to the Legislature. -
Mr. Woodsou then introduced two reso
lutions, one favoring good road p: and the
work as being prosecuted by the Bureau
of Highways, and the other authorizing
the secretary to acknowledge to Governor
Budd the receipt of bis communication of
sympathy with the labors of the society as
presented by General' Barrett, and to
render to him the thank's of "the conven
tion and solicit his profound consideration
of such bills as might be passed by the
Legislature by request of the sooiety.
The matter of State organization was
taken up, and it was agreed to appoint an
executive committee to consist of Presi
dent Holbrook, ; Vice-Presidents Charles
Sonutae, Gibson. Senator , Boyce and
Vice-Presidents Mrs. Loomis, -Shatter and
Withington, who were' to appoint an
advisory committee to consist of , one
member from every - humane society
throughout the State, the executive com
mittee to be empowered to call future con
ventions and regulate the place j of
meeting.
An adjournment was then taken until 9
o'clock to-morrow.
SAN JOSE'S SPORTING PALACE.
Broken Up Before It Opensâ Efforts of
Billy Dacey to Please the People
Not Appreciated.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 20.â Billy Dacey,
a pugilist who came here from Los An
geles about a week ago, attempted to open
up a saloon to be known as the Sporting
Palace, on the Alameda, near the narrow
gauge depot, last night, with a number of
glove contests between local pug. lists,
but the appearance of the owner of the
building with a number of deputy Sheriffs
caused the fights to be declare off.
â  Several (Jays ago Dacey made arrange
ments to secure a half interest in the Al
bion Saloon from William McCune. The
name of the place was changed to the
Sporting Palace, contracts were let for
painting the saloon front a bright carmine
and making other improvements, and it
.was the intention of the proprietor to run
a "redhot" sporting place. â¢
When everything was in readiness for
the opening last night John Mansfield, the
owner of the building, appeared and ob
jected to Dacey running such a place. The
crowd dispersed, and after threatening to
break up things generally Dacey sneaked
off and has left town.
WERNER MENKE FAILS.
A Large Winery Succumbs to Bull
Timet and' Creditors.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 20.-Werner W.
Menke, who conducts a lar.e winery on
the Alameda, near Santa Clara, to-day
made a voluntary assignment to -'Sheriff
Lyndon for the benefit of his creditors.
The property turned over to the Sheriff
consists of several acres of land and a
winery and a stock of wines valued, at
about $15,000. His indebtedness will
reach nearly $40,000, of which only a small
amount is secured. The principal
creditors are First National Bank of San

San Francisco, $2119; August Piktzhold,
San Francisco, $2310; H. Menke, Ger
many, $12,656. xV-rV, , - - .
Dull times and excessive interest pay
ments are the causes ot the failure.

FRESNO INSURANCE AGENTS.
Organize for Mutual Profit and to Pre
vent Competition by San Francisco
Insurance Brokers.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 20. --The local in
surance agents have organized in accord
with the general movement in all parts of
the State to stop the war that has been
going on for some time between the com
panies. ,
By organizing the agents believe tbat
â¢they can control matters, and it is their
purpose to establish a uniform system of
rates and also increase them, not to any
considerable extent, however. ;
The association was completed to-night
and the fo'lowing officers' were elected:
President, G. C. Grimes; vice-president,
F. M. Chittenden; secretary, Jacob Clark;
treasurer. W. P. Nelson executive com
mitteeâB. F. Shepherd, W. T. Mattihgly
and F. J. Ha ber. X ' , * ; 'â¢'
â  The agents believe that they can pre
vent rate-cutting as far as the local held is
concerned, and then place the rates at a
tiguro that will put some profit in the
business.. They claim : that under the
present state of affairs they are not mak
ing expenses. '.-... %â ,;,
It is also proposed to put a stop to " the
insurance of property in' this county by
brokers in San Francisco. The local
aeents say that fully one-third of, the.in-;
surance business of this. county is done
through the San Francisco aeents.
By asserting their power as an organiza
tion the local brokers believe they can in
fluence the companies to let all business
in this county go through their hands.
The Fresno organization will now pro- :
ceed to try to organize all the agents in the
valley into county associations. Jâ - â¢

THEFT LEGALIZED
BY THIS DECISION
Peculiar Ruling Affecting
Mortgaged Liens Upon
Dwellings.
The Mortgagee Cannot Recover
Houses Stolen : From ? the
Premises.
Incumbrance Said to B_ Removed
Permanently by , the Act of
â¢ Severance.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 20.â Owing
to a decision here to-day by Judge Allen
of the Superior Court relating to mort
gaged liens" upon dwellings which have
strayed away or been stolen from the
premises whereon they were mortgaged,
house-stealing is likely to become the pre
vailing fad in th part of the State. .
Leonard Griffin moved a house at Straw
berry Park, which had been part of mort
gaged premises, and the receiver has been
trying to get the house back on the prop
erty from which it was taken. ' Judge Al
len this morning denied the citation, and
the result is that the louse and the laud
have permanently parted company.
The court stated that no order could be
made affecting property not a part of the
mortgaged premises. By the act of sever
ance, he said, the dwelling-house was dis
incnmbered of tbe mortgage lien. When
so severed it became the .personal prop
erty of the defendant, Leonard Griffin.
He stated, further, that in law it mattered
not whether Griffin still retained the own
ership, as it bad become a part of the
really of Amy Sandford, Griffin's sister,
onto whose land he moved tbe house. The
.plaintiff bad no right, be held, to proceed
against other property until he had ex
hausted his mortgage security.
Griffin appeared before Justice Young
this morning and was arraigned upon the
criminal charge brought against him, in
wbich he is accused of stealing tbe house,
and his examination will be held later.
RUYS RANDSBURG LAND.
Lot on the Main Street of the Mining
Town Passes Into a Woman's
Possession.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 20.â The
jawbone of the Southern California real
estate agent, so long silent, sedate and
somber, has found a splendid field for re
newed activity. This new territory for
"the man with the iron jaw" is the famous
mining town of Randsburg on the Majave
desert. The biggest real estate transac
tion yet recorded in Randsburg was
effected yesterday, and strange to say the
person who had the nerve to invest $1250
; in a lot on Main street was a woman, and
a single woman at that. Now all ber
friends look wise and say they advised her
to do it. The lot fronts on the Rand,
nearly oppssite the St. Elmo Hotel, and
has a frontage of 47^ feet. It is now oc
cupied oy two restaurants, a saloon and a
cigar-store, and is renting for $170 a
month.
The buyer was Miss A. N. Harrington,
who came in on the stage one of those
snowy days last week. Miss Harrington
is also putting up a lodging-house just
south of the Elite Theater and intends to
remain.

SUICIDE AT SAN DIEGO.
James Hawley, a Soldier, incurable and
Despondent, Sat Down Before a Mir
ror and Shot Himself.
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Jan. James
Hawley, a discharged soldier, committed
suicide this morning in bis room at a
lodging-house on Third and E streets.
About 11 o'clock the landlady heard the
report of a pistol, and on the. window
being broken open Hawley's body was
found lying, bleeding, on the floor. At
his left side was a 32-caliber revolver, with
one chamber discharged.
He had placed the muzzle of the revol
ver to his mouth and fired, the powder
blackening his face and the shot almost
blowing the back of his head off. Death
was instantaneous.
In front of a small mirror was a chair,
in which he evidently sat as he fired the
shot." When broken open the room was
full of smoke. The windows were closed
down and he had removed his coat and
shoes. It was also found that he had
taken a dose of laudanum.
Hawley was about 30 years of age, and
a native of Canada, where he has two
sisters. He had served in the barracks
here about two years, and was discharged
a few weeks ago from the hospital as in
curable, being afflicted witb paralysis.
He had applied for a pension and losing
hope of success decided upon death.
Within an hour after his suicide a letter
was received at the hospital from Washing
stating that his application for a pension
had been placed on file.
TRAGEDY AT OGDEN.

Made by a Man Be fie ved to Be
"Healer" Schlatter.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 20.â special
to the Herald from O.den, Utah, says:
Francis Schlatter or his double is in the
city jail in a precarious condition. He
attempted suicide last night and has
Erobably succeeded. . About 7:45 o'clock
c went into the lunchroom of the Union
Pacific Hotel, drank a cup of coffee, and
went out on the platform. Soon after
ward he opened a pocket-knife and cut
his throat, severing the winopipe and
most of the arteries, but missing the
jugular vein. He was removed -to the
city jail and a physician was called. The
man urged the doctor to let him alone,
as he wanted to die. He talked in a
rambling manner, and once asked for a
revolver that he might end bis suffering.
His resemblance to Schlatter the "healer"
impressed all present, bis hair and beard
being lone, black and wavy. Being in a
semi-delirious state, it is impossible to
learn his name. The physician says the
man will die. ny-iiJW: >

HOW HE MADE MONEY.
Osmond Kelley Find* Himself Behind
Prison Kara on a Charge of
Embezzlement.
Osmond E. Kelly was booked at the
City Prison yesterday by Detective Ross
"Whitaker and Policeman "W. Coleman, on
two charges of misdemeanor embezzle
ment. The complaining witness is H. B.
Stedman, who has a music store at 769
Market street.
, Kelly \ went to Stedman's store on
January 12 and said he wanted to purchase
a mandolin. Ho represented himself as a
brother bf D. V. Kelly of the firm of Kelly
& Liebes', 120 Kearny street. He selected
an instrument costing $35, and asked to be
permitted to take it home, as he would
like to try it before concluding the pur
chase. Permission was granted, and he
went straight to a pawnshop and got $6 50
on the mandolin.
â  Next day he returned to the store and
said he waited a more expensive mando
(\_. He promised to return the first one
â¢fter he had tried the other. He got one
iTorth' $55, ' and also pawned it for $3 50.
As he did not return the instruments,
. Stedman reported the matter to the police,
and Detective Whitaker and Policeman
Coleman were detailed on the case. They
soon recovered the two mandolins and got
a * description of the man who pawned
them.
Complaints bad been received at police
headquarters about a man who had been
obtaining money and goods by represent
ing himself as the brother of D. V. Kelly,
and it was suspected that the same man
was the operator in each case.
Rev. Father Byrnes of St. Mary's
Cathedral was victimized to the extent of
$10. George L. Beck, druggist, 827 Larkin
street, is out $5 worth of drugs, and a
druggist on Folk and O'Farrell streets is
also a victim.
Kelly was located at 919 O'Farrell street,
but when the officers went there Tuesday
theywere informed that he had left a few
hours before. A sewing-machine was de
livered at the house for Kelly shortly
after his departure, and a messeneer had
called with a type-writing machine, but
refused to leave it unless the money was
paid, so it was not delivered. Kelly was
located yesterday and was promptly ar
rested.
Keily was arrested about eighteen
months- ago for defrauding servant girls.
He and an old woman calling herself MrÂ«.
Kelly had an employment office in the
Flood building and got deposits from
girls wanting siiuations. They got notes
to different houses, but on calling there
found there was no vacancy. Complaint
was made to the police and Kelly and the
old woman were arrested. They got out
of the difficulty by refunding the money.
Keily went to Los Angeles and returned
about six weeks ago. The police believe
that he has victimized a large num of
people who have not yet been beard from.
TO MARK THE VICTORY.
Prospective Reception in the Pavilion
, to Winning State Mark.
---J men.
a', is probable that the officers of the
First Regiment, Second Brigade, N. G. C,
will arrange an event to celebrate the vic
tory of the California team of marksmen
over the Hawaiian team.
The matter was discussed at a meeting
of the board of officers held last. Thursday
night, and it was suggested that there
should be some kind of an entertainment
to be given to the winning team and
friends of the regiment in honor of the
success. Several propositions were pre
sen ted, and it is likely that there will be a
reception in tho evening at the Pavilion
by the regiment -an exhibition drill or
review an.i then a dance. These matters
were discussed with a conditional "if the
California boys win," and at a meeting at
a luture date not yet fixed a plan will be
agreed. upon.
Captain Michael J. Burke of Troop C,
cavalry, came up from Salinas yesterday
to take part in the inquiry to bo made

WILL DEFEAT THE BILL.
The South wick. Convict Goods Measure
â Not Likely Ever to Be :
Reached.
There Is considerable apprehension on
the part of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association tÂ£at the Congressional
bill that is intended to put a stop to the
transportation of convict- goods
from one State to another and compelling
tbe branding of such goods so that people
will know what they are buying, will
never be passed by Congress. The local
organization has done all in its power to
have the matter taken up in earnest at
Washington, and while the entire Pacific
Coast delegation is in favor of the measure
it is still likely to fall- by the wayside.
The Chamber of Commerce took up the
question and gave its hearty indorsement
to the bill. ::.;::-;.
Not only are the Pacific Coast manufac
turers keenly alive to the importance of
the proposed law, but New York has
fallen into line and at its State prison all
machinery for the manufacture of goods
competing with free labor has been aban
eoned and such work as is being done is
performed by band. It is a New York
Congressman, George N. fiouthwick, who
introduced the bill in question, and he
even is fearful of its passage, as indicated
by the.annexed letter received yesterday
by the President of the Manufacturers'
Association: Â V "
House oe Representatives,"
Washington, January 15, 1897. J
Julian Sonntag, Esq., San Francisco, Cat.â MY
Dear Sir: House bill No. 0116. relative to con
vict-made goods and intestate commerce in
same, is prevented from passing the House, in
my opinion, only because the LaDor Commit
tee cannot secure from the Speaker recogni
tion. Privileged committees and privileged
matters monopolize the time of the House.
This condition is truly distressing, but it
confronts us nevertheless. Evidently the rules
of the House are devised to prevent rather
than facilitate legislation of the character of
this bill. Truly yours,
George N. Southwich. |
WHAT IS A .fUNERAL?
Novel Point Raised in the Case of a
Shipwrecked Sailor.
Justice Carroll at the City Hall has a
question to consider which is somewhat
novel, lt is this, What constitutes a
funeral? Timothy Linehan went to sea
and was drowned in a shipwreck. He was
a member of Pohonachee Tribe No. 10 of
the Improved Order of Red Men. Suit
has been brought to recover $100,. the
amount of funeral expenses as prescribed
ii. the by-laws of the order to which he
belonged. As he was shipwrecked there
were, necessarily, no funeral services at
sea. Was there any funeral on shore? ;.-
Ex-Judge Lauterbach appeared before
Justice Carroll yesterday to argue that
there has been no funeral. "How can there
be a funeral without the presence of a
corpse?" be asked. He then argued that,
in any event, the heirs of Linehan were
not-entitled to recover for several reasons.
The first was that there has been no fu
neral* the second was that under the by
laws of the order a suit at law was barred ;
then it was also argued that because the
matter had not been appealed to the
Grand Council the heirs had not ex
hausted out of court their means of re
covery.
Elizabeth Linehan brought the suit.
Her attorney argued that there really had
been a funeral on shore. A requiem mass
was heid, and this he construed to bo a
funeral.
The facts were agreed upon, and the de
cision of the Jaw point was lett to the
Justice as to whether a requ em mass may
be legally held to be a funeral.
Methodist Missionary Matters.
An all-day missionary meeting, attended by
several representative women from | each of
the Methodist churches in and about this City,
was held Tuesday in the parlors of the Califor
nia-street Methodist Church. There were be
tween thirty and forty w6men present. A
large number of letters from foreign mission
aries Were read and discussed with a view to
obtaining and later spreading; interesting
news from the Christian workers aoroad.
Part of the time was .rent in prayer. Mrs.
Kolla V. Watt presided. Luncheon was served
in the church basement. - .

BUTTE TEAM SUSPENDED.
Amateur Association Demands Poises
â  lon of Charity Game Re
ceipt*.
The disposition of the gate receipts of
the Butte-Olympic football game for char
ity is still a matter of contention. Noth
ing has yet been done with the money,
some $1150, which is in possession of Pres
ident Newhali cf the Olympic Club. A
Ion)-, animated meeting of the Pacific
Amateur Association was held last night,
when several representatives of the Olym
pic football team and Mr. Fitzgerald
of the Keliance Club, as a representative
for Butte, appeared and presented their
side of the case.
Then to further emphasize and define
its position, the association adopted the
following resolution :
â  Resolved, That the game played on January
1, 1897, between the Butte and Olympic foot
ball teams was for charity and that the pro
ceeds, less the expenses of tne grounds, labor
and advertising, were to be entrusted to the
board of managers of the Pacific Amateur As
sociation, and that the same be placed in the
custody of C. J. Bosworth, as trustee for the
Pacific Amateur Association.
A committee consisting of Reinhardt of
the University of California, "Rothkopf
and Swett was appointed from the board
of managers of the amateur association to
examine further into the merits of the
case and to report back to the main body.
All concerned agreed that the proposition
had been, as maintained, by the president
ofthe association, a game for charity with
expenses allowed only lor grounds and
advertising, but as a matter of equity and
financial hardship the Olympic Club rep
representative asked for a considerate
interpretation of the off-hand agreement
made dusing the urgency of arranging for
a game of some sort. The Olympic rep
resntative said that the football season
meant a loss of from $1000 to $15C0 to the
club.
A ban was placed on the Butte players.
who Pad persisted in lining up with the
two professionals. They were declared
indefinitely suspended from amateur
standing, the Olympic Club and the
Dolphin Rowing Club alone voting in the
negative, p primarily, though, _ President
Humphrey: of ; the association voted no
on the ground that the Butte men are de
serving of more serious classification.
..The Acme Club's suspension was re
ferred to a special meeting, as it was mid
night when the matter came up.

ON SCYLLA TO
AVOID CHARYBDIS
Judge Paterson Criticizes
a Judicial Reform ,
Measure.
He Thinks v Three Appellate
Courts Means a Clash of
.'., Decisions. '
Some Sledge-Hammer Comments on a
Court of Disciplineâ Evils to
Bj Avoided.
The proposed . constitutional amend
ment for judicial reform, which has the
support of the California Bar Association, '
is coming in for a deal of criticism at the
hands of many eminent . legal practi
tioners. i,
Tbe clauses relating to tbe formation of
a court of discipline and three appellate
courts, especially, are made to sizzle on
the gridiron of criticism. \ "i
Not that it is denied at all tbat there is
urgent need of reformation in judicial af
fairs. That - does not seem to constitute
tbe bone of contention. It is, in fact,
freely admitted.
The method of reform, however, cats a
good broad figure. Judge Van R. Pater
son, whose opinions on points of law al
ways are given careful consideration, i.
one of those who disapprove of the meas
ure championed by the Bar Association.
His opinions, given in an Interview yes
terday, are as follows:
"We are all aiming at the same object,
namely, the relief of the Supreme Court
and a more speedy determination of cases
appealed. We do not agree as to whic â¢
one ofthe several schemes proposed is the
most likely to receive the approval of the
voters at the polls. -'-"â¢'.<>..;"".
"My objections to the measure which
meets with the most favor in the Bar
Association are mainly threefold.
"First, there is to be a court of dis
cipline, that is to say, a body oi persons
clothed with authority to discipline mem
bers of the bar, and all the Judges, in
cluding the Justices of our Supreme
Court. Who are to discipline the mem
bers of this strange and powerful court we
do not know. Of course, there will be no
such persons, and the power to blast for
ever the reputations of our Judges and
Justices, it seems, is to be placed in the
bands of a tribunal Known only in mili
tary affairs.
"How sucb a measure and such a tribu
nal would tend to bring about a more in
dependent, fearless and honest adminis
tration of the law I confess I am unable to
see. If tbe court were to be 1 organized
for the discipline solely of members of the
bar it would not be so objectionable,
although to a great many it would seem
dangerous to place the reputation and the
right to earn a livelihood even in the
hands of rival practitioners.
"But such a tribunal, if desired, can be
provided for by a simple act of the Legis
lature without any constitutional amend
ment. That body, has full control over
the qualifications and discipline of . the
I bar.
V "Secondly, the - system' proposed pro
vides for three appellate courts. .This
will result in either one or both of
two. evils: a clash of decisions, whicb
always leads, to great dissatisfaction
among members of the bar and litigants,
who lose their cases because unfortunate
enougb not to be in some other district,
and additional burdens upon the- Su
preme Court iv trying to avoid or correct
such clashing.
"Third, I object to the measure pro
posed for the reason that, in my judg
ment, regardless of its merits, no scheme
providing for three new courts and the
imposition of the additional burden
upon the taxpayers of the State will
receive the approval of a majority of
the electors. The cry seems to be for re
trenchment, and unless we can provide
and offer the people an amendment which
we can demonstrate to them will not, if
adopted, materially increase tbe expenses
of the State government it will be de
feated at the polls."
"Have you any plan in view by which
these objectionable features could be
avoided?"
-'â  "I think I have.
"First, I would have no man or set of
men acting as monitors and holding dis
ciplinary rods over Judges of our courts,
either trial or appellate. I would have
them act as the framers of our Govern
ment intended they should act under no
obligation, save their oaths of office, indi
vidual honor and integrity.
"If we cannot get independent, fearless
and honest administration of tbe law from
our judicial departments under these con
ditions, we cannot get it at all, and our
form of government is a dead failure, for
the judicial department is the most power
ful <>f the three.
"Secondly, I would have one appellate
court composed of three or five Judges,
with' direction and authority to bold
sessions at such times and places
as the Legislature might provide. This
would bring the court near to the
same three sections of the State

that are now visited by our Supreme Court
twice in each year, and would iv a large
measure accomplish one of the principal
things aimed at in the plans which pro
vide for three district courts of appeal.
"In order to avoid a clash of decision I
would give that court jurisdiction to hear
and determine all criminal cases (except
capital cases or those involving capital
punishment), actions of forcible entry and
detainer, cases of nuisance, divorce,
maintenance, quo warranto, election con
tests, eminent domain, and in all actions
at law for the enforcement of obligations
not arising out of contract; also, author
ity to issue writs of procedendo, certiorari
and prohibition to tha Superior Courts' in
cases where it has appellate jurisdiction;
also, authority to issue writs of habeas
corpus to any part of the State.
"Such a court would lake from the Su
preme Court enough to leave the latter
able to handle the Balance of the appeals
from the Superior Courts. * There would
be very few instances in which the deci
sions of the court could clash with the de
cisions of the Supreme Court.
"Whatever clashing there might be
would arise chiefly cut of matters of prac
tice, but whatever difficulties might other
wise arise could be avoided by a provision
requiring the appellate court to follow
the rule of decision in all matters passed
upon by the Supreme Court.
"Thirdly, such a court, even if com
posed ,of five Judges, would cost but very
little more than the present commission
of the Supreme Court, and it would do
very much more effective work because its
decisions would be final. ".."/. ~1%7"j : :

forcefully, that there should be an appeal

"Such a court can be provided for by a
simple amendment to the constitution,
adding additional sections to those now
within that instrument and without
eliminating any therefrom. The plan
now before the Bar Association is so
lengthy that it will not be generally read,
and those who do not read proposed
amendments I think are very apt to vote
against them."

The memorial adopted at the mass
meeting on Tuesday urging upon Congress

THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
The memorial adopted at the mass
meeting of businessmen in this City on
Tuesday requesting Congress' to enact the
Nicaragua canal bill now pending was
undoubtedly an expression of the prevail
ing sentiment of the people of California.
The time has come when some beginning
should be made in this important work,
and the speediest way to begin is by the
adoption of the 'bill which is now before
Congress.
That there are features in the bill to
which objection might be made is beyond
question. It is certain, however, that it
would be impossible to devise a measure
which would be satisfactory in all of its
deta.ls to everybody. The main issue is
the simple one of promoting the construc
tion of the canal as promptly as possible
under conditions which would place it and
maintain it under the control of the
United States Government. These essen
tial points seem to be well secured by the
pending bill, and this being so there 13 no
reason why it should not be supported by
ail who really desire to see the completion
of the work.
Senator Turpie .of Indiana in speaking
against the bill in .he Senate declared
himself in favor of the construction of the
canal, but asserted he was opposed to
letting it go into the hands of a private
corporation. This was an unfair state
ment of the true nature of the proposed,
bill. A sufficient guarantee is provided in
the measure for Government control to
make it certain that the corporation which
is to nominally build it would be in every
respect subordinate to the Government.
Senator Morgan in presenting the bill,
stated that every detail of it had received
the unanimous approval of the Nicaragua
Canal Committee in the Senate, and this
statement being undisputed is clearly a
satislactory guarantee that the objections
made by Senator Turpie are not valid.
If we are to have the canal at all we
must agree upon some method of con
structing it. Nothing can be gained by
wrangling over the details involved. The
construction of the. work by the Govern
ment directly is virtually impossible, lt
is not certain that a majority of the mem
bers of both houses of Congress would
favor such a plan and it is practically sure
that Nicaragua would object to it. The
one way to obtain a' speedy beginning of
the work is to enact the bill now before
the Senate and since the essential point is
the construction cf the canal there ought
to be no serious objections to adopting the
only means of obtaining it.
The interests of Caiiiornia in the canal
are great, but they are not greater than
those of other sections of the country.
The whole Union would be benefited by
the opening of this new waterway be
tween the Atlantic and Pa ciHc coasts. It
should be constructed by the aid of our
Government in order, as the -memorial
states, that it "shall remain under tbe
control of the United States Government
an American canal under American con
trol." If we can achieve that much we
will have gained all that is essential to
National welfare in the construction of
the great work, and it is to be hoped there
fore that Congress will cordially respond
to the request of the memorial. "
THE ARBITRATION TREATY.
In his address before the House of Lords
on Tuesday Lord Salisbury, in alluding to
the proposed treaty of arbitration with
the United States, said he could not speak
fully on the subject because the agree
ment bad not yet been ratified. He de
clared, however, that he felt at liberty to
say that the British people must not
think that they are living "in the millen
nial dispensation." The only conclusion
to be drawn from his remarks, therefore,
is that Lord Salisbury is not an enthusiast
on arbitration and that he does not take
the sanguine views of the subject which
are so common among people who have
had less experience in dealing with inter
national questions.
Lord Salisbury was wise in reminding
Parliament that the agreement had not
yet been ratified. There are increasing
evidences that it will have a good deal of
opposition in the Senate, and may be ma
terially amended before it is adopted.
While the people of the United States ap
prove of the general principle of arbitra
tion, they are not likely to enter into an
agreement for permanent arbitration until
they see clearly the end to which such an
agreement would lead tbem. It has been
suggested that the proposed treaty would
involve us in something like "an entan
gling alliance" with Great Britain, and to
that of course no American statesman
who has a due regard for the precedents
of the Republic will consent.
Lord Salisbury stated that the relations
of England to the United States are full
of small differences which are sometimes
exaggerated and cause irritation and en
mity. He thought that the formation of
a tribunal of arbitration would serve to
take these questions out of the domain of
politics and to that extent would tend to
the maintenance of friendliness between
the two countries. - He also declared that
another advantage to be derived from the
treaty would be tbat. a Minister dealing
with a subject involving the honor of his
country would have in. the Court of Arbi
tration a shield from the attacks of "jin
goes," since, as he says, it would be im
possible for the opponents of a Minister to
say he had trifled with the honor of his
country when be had submitted the mat
j ter to the decision of an impartial tribunal.
There can be no question of the gen
! eral correctness of these statements. The
I proposed treaty will not be the beginning
of the millennium. It will not be th 6 final
solution of all problems between England
and America. It will, however, be helpful
in settling those minor disputes which are
continually recurring. This view will
doubtless be taken by the Senate when the
subject comes up for settlement. We are
not going to enter into an entangling al
liance with England, but we can make
some agreement with her that will be for
the benefit of both countries. If Secretary
Olney has gone too far it will be the duty
of the Senate to amend the proposed

THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
The speech from the throne at the open
ing of the session of the British Parlia
ment has Jong since become very little
more than an idle ceremony. Her Ma
jesty's Ministers who frame the speech
for her make use of it merely to outline
the business to which they will call upon
Parliament to attend. It is not until .the
bills dealing With this business are actu
ally introduced that the public is made
thoroughly acquainted with the course
which the administration intends to
pursue.
In the speech delivered on Tuesday her
Majesty's Ministers give very little infor
mation concerning their course of action.
All that can be gathered from the address
is that the march into Upper E^ypt is to
be sustained and the country annexed to
Egypt and placed under British protec
tion ; the depressed condition of the sugar
industry in the West Indies is to be con
sidered- and possibly some measures may
be devised to protect it* the House of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 1897.
Commons will be called on* to continue
liberal expenditures for national defense;
a measure will be introduced to promote
primary education by securing the main
tenance of voluntary schools; a bill will'
be offered \ making better t provision for
compensation to working people who suf
fer from accidents; attention will be paid
to the water supply of London, to agricul
ture in. the kingdom and to the disposi
tion of goods manufactured in prisons in
other countries; the Irish problem will
receive attention, and efforts will be made
to relieve that country of some of. the ills
fpfora which it now suffers. fJ
This is certainly a broad and long pro
gramme of work. It is notable from the
fact that home affairs are treated as of
much more importance than the foreign
difficulties in which the empire is in
volved. There can be little question that
the bills which will be most earnestly de
bated in Parliament will be those relating;
to education, agriculture, compensation
for worKingmen injured by accident and
the promised relief for "Ireland. Such a'
programme would not have been so
strange had it come from a Liberal Min
istry, but it is a striking evidence of the
changed condition of public sentiment in
England that a high Tory administration
should direct itself to remedying the evils
of workingmen and farmers at home in
stead of seeking prestige by a brilliant
display of British power abroad.
Until the bills providing the proposed
relief are introduced it will be impossible
to intelligently criticize the policy of the
administration, lhe bills may provide
for efficient remedies for the evils which
exist, and on the other hand they may be
nothing more than .temporary expedients
intended to silence the cries of the clam
orers. It is not yet known. which of these
is to te expected. Not much has hitherto
been done for farmers, for workingmen
and for Ireland by the Tories, but this is
no prool that something may not be done
by the present administration. j. .'*"*.Â£;â¢; :J''
* Agricultural distress in Great Britain
affects the great land-owners as well as
farmers, and ever since, the days of Lord
Randolph Churchill there has been such a
thing In England as a Tory democracy,
devoted to the welfare of . the common
people. The influences resulting from
these may determine Lord Salisbury to be
almost as radical in his measures of relief
as could have been expected from a Liberal
Ministry. The world will nave to wait
therefore for the introduction of the bills
before it can determine how far the Salis
bury government deserves the support of
the British people.
MINES AND MINING.
No industry of California has more im
portant interests at stake in legislation
this winter than that of the miners. Botb
in the State Legislature and in Congress
measures are pending which will affect
the mining interests in many ways, and it
behooves the people and the press to give
every assistance possible to the miners in
obtaining the desired legislation which is
needed to advance the welfare of their in
dustry.
The mining men themselves are show
ing commendable vigor and unity of pur
pose in promoting the adoption of meas
ures they desire. The executive commit
tee of the mining association is doing pood
work in this direction, and in addition. to
urging the enactment by Congress of a
bill providing or a commission to deter
mine the mineral or non-mineral nature
of land ia railroad grants, is having pre
pared for submission to the State Legisla
ture a number of measures which it is
believed will be of great benefit to the
mining industry.
In this connection it is gratifying to
note that Senator Perkins is preparing a
bill providing lor the establishment of a
Secretary of Mines and Mining of Cabinet
rank. The California Senator will have
the support of Senators from all the West
ern States and a considerable number from
among the Representatives of the larger
mining States of the East. There is, there
lore, some grounds for the expectation
that if the bill be pushed forward with
vigor it will find sufficient approval in
both houses of Congress to become a law.
This would be a great advantage to the
miners, inasmuch as it would give their
industry a representative in the Cabinet
and would lead to the settlement of many
of those vexed problems of mining law
which are now so detrimental to the in
dustry.
In order that the advocates of the ap
pointment of the proposed Secretary
should have the full benefit of public sen
timent in its favor that sentiment should
now manifest . itself as speedily as possi
ble through the press and through the
voice of the boards of trade, chambers of
commerce and similar bodies, as well as
of associations of miners.
From the Great West there should go a
unanimous declaration from all the States
and Territories in favor of the measure.
Much benefit will, no doubt, be conferred
upon the miners by the enactment of the
bills which they are now urging, but all
of these combined would not be so advan
tageous as the accomplishment of the
appointment of a Secretary of Mines and
Mining. Such an official is necessary and
such an official we can get if we work
for it. â¢:â¢

ance of "Lohengrin" which he directed in
Rome. Mancineili is not at all disturbed to
hear himself accused of not understanding
modern music, especially Wagner. He takes
lt all philosophically, and docs not indulge in
any of tho recrimination which has character
ized the disputes among the lyric artists.
Taken all round, though, this is the champion
season for strile in New fork operatic circles.
The European musical papers express great
indignation over the misfortunes which have
befallen an Italian barytone named Pacini at
Caracas. According to the cabled accounts
this singer has been arrested at Caracas on the
demand of his empre.arlo because he refused
to give an encore to an aria which the public
applauded, on the pretext that he was suffer
ing from a slight indisposition and did not
care to sing more than be could help. Le
Mcnestrel says: "It seems that the inhab
itants of the republic of Venezuela use toward
recalcitrant artists the same treatment that
was employed in France under the ancient
monarchy and under the first empire. One
could understand the conduct ot the'autbori
ties at Caracas If the artist had proved refrac
tory and had refused bis assistance at
a representation which, had been previously
announced, but the question was simply one of
an encore, and according to all the rules of
optra and of jurisprudence, the singer had a
perfect right to refuse to give one. In a thea
ter the public only has a right to demand the
full performance of the work announced, and
the repetition of any piece is very often ruin
ous to the dramatic interpretation of the
opera, and in the eye of enlightened amateurs
Is an intolerable abuse. In any case the public
has no right to force the artists to give en
cores, and in almost all the big theaters in
Germany rigorous rules command the singers
to refrain from yielding to the popular de
mand for encores. It is then the height of in
justice and barbarism to imprison a singer
for refusing to repeat a piece. The cables in
form us that Signor Pacini has been con
demned to fifteen days for injury to the cor
poration of the town of Caracas, wbich subsi
dizes the theater."
A comical adventure recently happened to
Herr Bultz, leading barytone of the Royal
Opera of Berlin. He announced a concert in
a fairly important town belonging to the an
cient kingdom of Hanover, and the very even
ing on which he was to appear received, an
urgent invitation to repair immediately to
the office of the Chief of Police. Naturally he
went instead to the hall, where the audience
was expecting him, and very shortly afterward
he was waited on by the Chief of Police, who
asked him curtly for bis singer's diploma.
"What's that?" asked the artist, a little con
fused, and the guardian of -the law explained
that before being allowed to sing he must pro
duce a certificate, setting forth his talents, as
the town bad already been several times de
ceived by soi-disant pianists and singers,, who
wero not what they pretended to be. After
declaring vigorously that he was really a
singer to the court, and showing his decora
tions, Herr Bulsz was finally permitted to
sing and prove to the Chief of Police, who
watched his exploits with an anxious coun
tenance, that he was not an impostor.
For the last twenty years Boito has been an
nouncing that he is working on an opera,
"Nero," of which nobody so far has ever heard
a single note. Recently the Italian papers
have begun to joke on .the subject, and one
editor gravely announces that the first scene
of the first tableau of the first act of "Nero" is
now completed, and that only the orchestral
score has to be written. . At a performance
given at the Victor Emanuel Theater at An
con'a for tbe benefit of the art school the chief
attraction consisted of a parody of Boito's
"Nero." "How?"'asks one newspaper, "is it
possible to parody an opera whose very exist
ence no one is in a position to affirm?" "That
is very simple," replies a contemporary; "just
lift the curtain for a moment on a scene show
ing nothing but a few clouds, and then lower
it again, in silence. That would give the
spectators a very good idea of Boito's 'Nero.' "
For the last few years there has existed at
Lemburg, the capital of Gallcia, in Austria, a
Jewish theater, in: which all the pieces are

an unpublished opera In five acts entitled
"Ychouda-ben-Halevy," the words by Auer
bach and the music by Wolf thai. Thehcroof
this opera is not the composer of "La Juive,"
as one would be tempted to. believe from its
title, but a celebrated Jewish poet who lived
ln Spain several centuries ago and to whom
are due Hebraic verses of great merit, among
others the superb "Melodies of Jerusalem,"
some of which are interlaced in the text of the
opera in question. The Austrian journals
state that this first genuine Jewish opera has
bad a great success. '''-Z\ '?â  â¢-â -'â¢'vC 'â .'.'â

THE THREE CHUMS.
Yesterday was a great day for Senator White and Representative Maguire of California, says
the Washington Post of the 12th inst. Both were active and indeiatigable opponents of thdy
Pacific railioad fundfng bill, and Senator White had a seat by the Congressman while the vote
was being taken. .>', Â .. . ._ >
In this, as in almost all other political affairs, the Senator and the Congressman have been
together. Their relations amount to a singular coincidence. They were both reared in the
same county and on the same farm in California, and both have been bosom friends ever
since. Governor Budd, another ofthe most prominent men in the State, is a chum of both
Senator and Congressman, and the trio are inseparable. They are in the same political combi
nations and form an invincible team. They are all about the same size, and until Mr. Maguire
shaved off his beard be looked like Senator White. His wife mado him dispense with his
whiskers because, she said, too many people took him for the Senator.
When Mr. Maguire made his speech against the funding bill last week, Senator White sat by
his side. "Give the road , Jim," said the Senator. At the same time a page handed the
Congressman a bundle of telegrams. - They were from Governor Budd. "Give them , Jim,"
said the Governor. â¢ '; : . â  â  â  ' j : .

GUARDING AN
ENVOY'S BIER
The Remains of Minister
Willis Arrive on the
Australia.
His Widow Requested That the
Ceremonies Be as Simple
as Possible.
Soldiers From the Presidio Formed a
Corps of Honor as Soon as r th.
Steamer Arrived.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia came into port yesterday with all
her flags at half-mast and her yards cock
billed.. On board were the remains of
Albert S. Willis, late Minister Pleni
potentiary and Envoy Extraordinary from
the United States to Hawaii. When the
vessel docked at Pacific-street wharf a
detail of soldiers from the Presidio took
charge of the casket, and during the day a
soldier stood watch over the remains. In
the evening the casket was removed to the
ferries, and at Oakland was placed on the
Sunset Limited, en route for Louisville, Ky.
HONOLULU. Hawaii, Jan. 13.â The re
mains of the late United States Minister
Albert S. Willis are Deing taken to San
Francisco by the steamer Australia. They
were taken from the vault in Nuuanu
Cemetery this afternoon and placed on
board by the undertaker. There was no
display except an escort from the United
Statessteamer Alert, but Minister Cooper
of the Foreign Office was present on the
steamer to receive them and attend to
their disposition.
Mrs Willis, her son, and Miss Dulaney,
her sister, accomoanv the remains to
Louisville, where the final interment will
take place. A large number of friends of
the deceased were present at the wharf to
pay the last tribute of respect to the de
ceased, and the usual band concert at the
wharf on the departure of the steamer was
dispensed with by order of the Minister of
Foreign Affairs.
All the newspapers of the city have
united in savin.- nice things of the dead
diplomat, the following editorial notice
from the Evening Bulletin being given as
a sample:
. Should Hawaii be called upon to mourn
the death of one of its native sons in
highest official life it could give no more
no.able or sincere expression of honor and
respect than the tribute paid to the late
United States Minister Willis. In official
detailtbe funeral exercises of yesterday
were among the most impressive ever
witnessed in the country; but all this
would be as nothing if it were not every
where apparent that the honest senti
ment of the people was being voiced.* Our
citizens have expressed, better than
tongue or Den can portray, their appre
ciation of the estimable character of the
1 le American Minister. As the represen
tative of the American Republic, as the
dean of the diplomatic corps, as a man
among men, a remarkable national tribute
has been offered, beautiful in its unselfish
spontaneity, and shrouded with a grand
eur that comes from universal action in
which the petty affairs of life are forgot
ten in tho contemplation of character
built upon high motives.
Mrs. Willis has received a large number
of letters of condolence from the Govern
ment, members of the diplomatic and
Consular corps, and the many friends
which she has made during her residence
in Hawaii. An oil portrait of Minister
Willis, painted by the celebrated artist,
Fed Yates, on an order from Mrs. Irwin,
and presented by her to Mrs. Willis, will
be shipped to Louisville to-day. it was
painted from a photograph, with sugges
tions from Mrs. Irwin as to coloring. The
likeness is that of Mr. Willis when he first
came to Hawaii, and is excellent.
William G. Irwin has always been a
close friend of Minister Willi-, and an ad
mirer of his qualities as a statesman, and
W. G. Irwin & Co., representatives of J.
D. Spreekels & Co., have extended to Mrs.
"Willis and her family the courtesies of tho
Oceanic Steamship Company, and as a
tribute of the deep respect he holds for the
family and the memory of the late Min
ister Mr. Irwin has proffered them the use
of accommodations for .themselves and
the remains to San Francisco.
The officers of the Australia prepared a
special room for the reception of the re
mains. It was draped the stars and
' stripes and the Hawaiian flag, and day
i and night a light was kept burning at tbe
; bead of the casket. One of the crew was
! constantly on watch and a chair was
j placed near the bier for the accommoda-
I tion of Mrs, Willis or a son. Directly
i the Australia docked a soldier relieved
| the sailor on watch, ana from that on the
j military authorities were in control. Ser
geant Walsbury and three privates formed
I the "guard of honor."
According to military ethics the dead
Minister was entitled to a guard com
posed of four troops of cavalry, four com
panies of infantry and four batteries of
artillery, but at the urgent request of Mrs.
Willis very little display was made. About
3:30 p. m.* fifteen non-commissioned offi-
cers came in from the Presidio and re
lieved the men on watch.
Later on four troops of cavalry arrived
and a start was made for the ferries. The
casket, draped in the American flag, was
placed on a gun-carriage and the cortege
was headed for th. ferries. There the
cavalry were dismissed, but several of the
infantry accompanied the body and will
serve as the guard of honor until the
State line is reached. Mrs. Willis is
thoroughly prostrated and has to be
assisted in all her movements. Her son
and her sister are constantly in attend
ance upon her and do everything in their
power far the stricken woman.
United States Appraiser Tucker, acting
under instructions from Washington, will
accompany the remains to Louisville. Ky.,
as the official representative of the Presi

WOULD ABOLISH
BATTLER TEST
The Affiliated Improve
ment Clubs Approve of
Red Rock.
Will Fight Bills for an Increase
of Fire Department
Wages. ;:
Favor Two-and-a-Half Cent Car Fare
and Recomm nl Passage of
the Bill.
The abolition of the rattler test for
City paving rock, the reduction of street
car fares to 2J_[ cents and the strenuous
objection to tbe increase of wages in the
Hre Department were all strongly favored
las. night by the Affiliated Improvement
Clubs of the City, assembled in regular
meeting at B'nai B'rith Hall.
' Eighty delegates were present and John
11. Grady acted as chairman
Judge Van Reynegom of the committee
| on laws reported concerning two bills in
j particular now before the Legislature.
j They had received the indorsement of a
! majority of the laws committee and he
: hoped that the assemblage, would also
indorse them. One was to restore the veto
power to the Mayor and giving the Mayor
| power to approve water rates. The other
is a bill regarding actions to quiet title to
real estate property, in other words to put
a stop to suits like those against the occu
i pants of the Noe grant in this City.
No action was taken upon them.
By far the greater part of the long scs
i sion was, however, taken up by a lively
two-sided fight, with the defenders of the
i rattler test on the one side and the f rlen ds
I of hard roc*, of any kind on the other side.
â  The result was practically a decisive vie
i tory for red rock as a paving material
| heretofore debarred by the test.
Secretary Schwartz, as chairman of the
I carnival committee, reported that noth
; ing serious seemed to impede the pro
| posed Carnival of the Golden Gate for
; April next.
In regard to the talked-of reduction in
streetcar fares it was reported that Hunt
ington had said explicitly that if streetcar
fares were reduced to 2% cents the rail
â  road company would discontinue the is-
I suance of transfers.
He had also declared that no effort
would be made to oppose the measure in
tbo Legislature. Further, he had as
serted that the street railway system is
â¦paying now only 6 per cent on the invest
ment." The railroad would fight the re
duction in the courts, for to-day he
claimed that San Francisco has a more
efficient railway system than any other
city in the country.
These sentiments were no sooner re
ported that James W. Boland moved that
the Associated rmprovememt Clubs at
once put themselves on record as favoring
the proposed reduced rate, notify the Leg
islature and ask to have the bill passed.
Ex-Supervisor Thomas F. Haggerty de
clared himself as decidedly opposed to the
bill. : â¢ .v.... . ; :-; : .:â â ;â â -
He said that it was one of those periodic
follies that crop up now and then and die
because of their folly. The speaker said no
one would accuse him â  of favoring the
railroad when lour years ago he fought it
with Sutro face to face. The passage of
the bill would be beneficial to the City,
but it would not pass, as lawyers could
testify. * ...
, Dan O'Leary said that the bill would
not pass as a legal measure. * .
M. J. Burleigh, speaking as a represent
ative of the outskirts of the City, asserted
that i he knows that years ago for as much 1
a* a year passengers were carried on the
Mission-street line for 3 cents, and that
it paid, and at & time when the cost of
running a street railroad was twice what
it is at present. He thought the bill
should be indorsed as an expression of
what the citizens consider right, whether
practicable at present or not. 'â â '-'. "â [' â 
;.tlt became a little difficult to maintain
quiet, and the chairman bad no gavel.
Some one brought in a big club from the
anteroom and presented it to the chair
amid much laughter. *..".'>
l A resolution to the Legislature was then
made and carried, advocating the passa.e
of the bill. for. reduced car fares with a
small but important change in the word
ing of the bill. "Or connecting line," in
reference to transfers was changed to "and
connecting line."
The so-called rattler-test ordinance for
proving the durability of paving rocks
came up for particular criticism. . .*.*â¢"."
Ex-Supervisor James Denman explained
why he had voted for the establishment
of the rattler-test ordinance. He had per
sonally cut into pavements during his
term of office and had taken samples into
the board. In most cases he had found
red mud purporting to be red rock as a
foundation for the bituminous â  rock.
"Don't," he said, "let us go back to pave
ments that were rejected twenty years
ago; for that is what the repeal of the rat
tler-test ordinance would mean â red mud
for red rock."
J. W. Boland was up with a resolution
by the special committee and 'backed it
fiercely. He strongly favored the aboli
tion of the rattler test.and the adoption of
a measure stipulating that rock red, blue
or gray â shall be hard, sharp, clean, free
from dirt or foreign substances and broken
to "a uniform size. In connection with
this measure he favored special inspectors
of paving chosen for each block by a
majority of the property-owners on lhat
particular block.
An artisan engaged in concrete work
for years gave his experience to prove
that hint rock is preferable to the 'blue
rock, which alone can pass the rattler test.
He caused much merriment by asserting
that a bag of doughnuts submitted to the
rattler test would lose le.s per cent than
the blue rock itself.
Joseph * Shearer, with vigorous argu
ment, unique figures of speech and in
imitable gestures, went into the question
and spoke in favor of good red rock, at the
same time declaring that the so-called red
mud is better than the blue rock that has
a monopoly by reason of the rattler test.
. He cited many cases of new buildings,

State Affiliated Colleges, where red rock
had been used by architects in preference
to blue rock. *
Thomas F. Haggerty declared that in
the past rotten pavements had been the
direct result of rotten inspectors, not of
tests.
Nathan Crocker, himself an interested
party, though not a delegate to thÂ« meet
ing, was given the privilege of the floor to
explain tbe merits of good red rock.
At the conclusion of his discourse the
resolution to abolish the rattler test was
put to vote and was carried by a very
large majority.
The monopoly enjoyed by bituminous
rock as a paving material was brought up
with a view lo permitting other material
to compete, but the lateness of the hour
caused the matter to be deferred for de
bate to some more favorable time.
As a spirited conclusion to the meeting,
a strong sentiment was expressed against
the proposed increase in wages in the
City Fire Department, and a special com
mittee consisting of George L Center. W.
L. Williamson and Frank W./McEwen
was delegated to go to Sacramento and

Lively Meeting of the

Â«_
The Election of Deacon Smith
> Verbally Opposed by One
Member. .
Strong Language Causes a Demon
strationâThe Pastor's Resig
nation Accepted. '
That Christian meekness of spirit which
should properly characterize the delibera
tions of all church assemblies was not the
only sentiment displayed, at last night's
adjourned meeting of the Plymouth Con
gregational Church. Mr.- Waymer, a
member of long standing, opposed the re
election of Stephen E. Smith as deacon,
and expressed that opposition in lan
guage of a distinctly unparliamentary
character. ,
The pastor of the church, Rev. W. D.
Williams, presided as moderator, and
there was a large attendance. The elec
tion of deacons having been named as. the
first order of business, Deacon Bufford
j proceeded to nominate Stephen S. Smith,
! voicing at the same time his pained sur
j prise that a movement having for its ob
ject the defeat of Deacons Smith and Gar
field should ever have been promoted.
He spoke at some length and in terms of
the highest eulogy concerning Deacon
Smith's services to Plymouth Church and
his long and honorable tenure of nearly
every arduous office in its gift. . Many
other well-known members of the congre
gation echoed Deacon Bufford's words.
It was in the midst of Bradford's eulogy
that Mr. Waymer introduced the element
of verbal discord. The former had just
observed that the opposition to Mr.
p Smith's election must be due to misunder
standing. Mr. Waymer rose at this june-
I ture and curtly informed Brother Brad
j ford that he (Waymer) had been a mem-
I ber of the church for eighteen years and
yet had seen fit to vote against Mr. Smith.
: 1 Later in the evening, having secured the
I floor, he expressed himself more plainly.
It was remarkable, he said in effect, that
anybody should take the trouble to assure
the meeting of friendly sentiments toward
Mr. Smith when these were so obvious, lt
â¢ would be quite superfluous, he added, to
assure the meeting of the virtues of some
one known to be a thief and an outlaw.
A storm of hisses interrupted Way
mer, and the moderator called him to or
der, 'm, '
A ballot was subsequently taken, with
the result that Deacons Smith and Gar
field were re-elected by 156 and 153 votes
respectively. The congregation received
the announcement with prolonged ap
plause. .
Deacon C. J. Snow was elected clerk and
treasurer, and the- following were ap
pointed members of the standing comit
tee: Judge Sawyer, W. B. Shephard,
Mrs. Garfield, Mrs. S. B. Smith ana .Mrs.;
Fiddes. Messrs. 8. P. Cole, F. A. Hyde
and S. F. Bufford .were 1 unanimously ap
pointed members of the music committee.
Under the head of new business the pas
tor again presented bis resignation in the
appended letter, which, in v accordance
with the desire of the writer, was regret
fully accepted, though it was afterward
decided to appoint a committee of five
to draft resolutions respecting the same:

Brethren: Permit me once again to present

be accepted at this meeting. ;

NINE ARE DRAWING
ALL THE FUND
Peculiar Condition of the
School Pension Treas
ury.
No Other Teacher Can Be R
tired Under the Existing *
Conditions.
Mayor Phelan, Probing. Into the Sub
ject cf Pensions, Made a Start
ling Discovery.
A surprise awaits the 560 schoolteachers
who, by the payment of 1 per cent of their
income into the teachers' pension fund,
have presumably provided for retirement
at some future lime should they elect to
do so.- The fact is that seven teachers
who have already been retired upon a
pension take up, all the income of the
fund, with the exception of $50 per quar
ter. Hence, unless the rate of pension to
be received shall be reduced, or tne oer
centage per capita to be paid in by the
teachers shall 03 largely increased,, or
some other method be devised to aug
ment the fund, not over nine teachers
can at any one time draw a pension.
Mayor Phelan, who has been actively
and industriously investigating into the
City and County's affairs, discovered this
condition oi the teachers'. pension fund
while attending a meeting of the Commis
sioners having in hand the administration
of the lund. The commission consists of
the Mayor, the City and County Treasurer
and the Superintendent of Public Schools.
The Treasurer has the custody of the
fund. At the last meeting of the Com
missioners tha list of pensioners was in
creased to nine. Previously there were
seven names on the list. Five of the pen
sioners were drawing $150 per quarter and
two were drawing $135. These pensions
aggregate $1020 per quarter.
Mayor Phelan learned to his surprise
from Treasurer Widber that the present
quarterly income payable to pensions is
only $1170. It is easy to see that this will
leave for the two teachers who have just
been added to the pension list only $150 in
total, or at the rate of $75 per quarter
each, if all the remainder, after paying
the seven previous pensioners, shall be
evenly divided between them. No other
teacher can possibly be pensioned while
the nine now on the list draw from it, un
less there is a change in the existing ar
rangement one way or another.
Mayor Phelan is greatly interested in
the condition of the fund, "I think," he
said, that as a matter of justice all the
teachers who are concerned in this mat
ter should learn all the facts as early as
possible and that they should fully under
stand the matter, that no cause for an un
pleasant surprise may remain. I will con
fess that I was astonished to learn the
facts, and I have no doubt that the teach
ers will be equally and very unpleasantly
surprised."
Some inquiry develops the fact that
there is no legal provision for the invest
ment of the pension fund. The quarterly
moneys are paid by tne teachers into the
City and County treasury and there they
remain to be immediately available for
the payment of pensions as they may be
voted. Under the. terms of the law pro
viding for the pension fund the teachers
have no voice in determining the number
of pensioners who may be placed upon
the pension list. That is determined by
the commissioners of the fund, who are all
City and County officers.
Legislation is "pending' at Sacramento
which may, have a beneficial effect. The
teachers will unquestionably take a lively
interest in any measure affecting the
pension fund that may be urged upon the
State Legislature, especially so by reason

A general view of the port of Newcastle, N. S. W., during the great colliery "strike. Many of the vessels now in port were tied up at that time, and among them

ported by the Carrier-

It Is Believed, However, That

Outbound.
Gallant Rescue of a Woun.ed Sailor
by the Mate of the Levi
G- Enrgess.
Interest in the arrival of the Swanhilda
is still unabated and Meiggs wharf is
thronged every day with people who hope
against hope that when the vessel gets in
they will see Frank Butler, the man ac
cused of murder, landed from her. Chief
Officer Lawless of the steamer Australia,
which got in yesterday, reports that on
the 19th inst., at 4 p.m., they sighted a
four-masted vessel heading for San Fran
cisco that answered the description of the
Swanhilda. At that time she was 140
miles southwest of San Francisco, and
given anything life a favorable wind she
should get in to-day.
Opinion seems to be divided as to
whether the vessel sighted is the Olive
bank or the Swanhilda.
Both are four-masted vessels, bark rigged
on the jigger mast, and both are due from
Newcastle, Australia. Both the ships and
a dozen others now in port were tied up at
the same time in Newcastle, N. S. W.,
during the great colliery strike, so the
British ship captains are as much inter
ested in the arrival of the Swanhilda as
the general public. The general opinion
among them, however, is that Butler will
not be found aboard' when the vessel ar
rives. ~;Js .:*--> y .'â 
The homing pigeon which brought the
missive relating the sighting of the four
masted ship supposed to be the Swan
hilda, off the Farallon Islands late Tues
day afternoon, reached the lofts of A. Car
lisle in Berkeley at 11 a: m." yesterday morn
ing. The vessel was sighted at 4:45 in
The Message Borne by the Carrier Pigeon From the Farallon Islands.
the afternoon, which was too late to dis
patch a bird. as they do not work well by
night, and so the sending of the message
was delayed until' the morning. Miss
Doud loosed the swift-winged carrier at
8:35 yesterday morning.
At the time he was released the weather
was clear, but an east wind was blowing,
which prevented rapid flight. The time
the bird was on.the wing was two hours
and twenty-five minutes, or an hour longer
than the record held by another of Mr.
Carlisle's homers. The loss of time is ex*
plained by the unfavorable winds and the
inexperience of the keepers at the Far
alloncs in. training the birds. One bird,
at least, and sometimes two, comes regu
larly every day from the islands, bearing
messages from Miss Doud to Mrs. Carlisle.
Another, relating to the supposed sight
ing of the Swanhilda, which bears the
supposed murderous Butler, is expected at
any moment. So complete is the system
invented by Mr. Carlisle for announcing
the arrival of a bird that as soon as it
reaches tbe cote the fact is made known ,
in his residence by the rinsing of an elec
tric bell. â ;._â ' V 'â ':â â  â â¢. _a___bs
It is believed, however, that the vessel
was outbound, as the last master re
ported was too far out to have got in by
this time. gggjg
Among the arrivals by the Australia
was George C. Beckley, who will superin
tend the completion, of the Helene,
launched . from the Union . Iron ".Works
yards last Monday for the Wilder Steam
ship Company of Honolulu. Before start
ing for San Francisco Mr. Beckley was
presented with a purse and the money
will be used by the recipient in the pur
chase of a flag for the new "boat. While
here Mr. Beckley will contract for the
building of another steel steamer which
will be at least fifty feet longer than the
largest **_ssel owned by the company and
will have a speed of at least 15 Jcnots.
This will make four steamers that will
bave been built in San Francisco for
Hawaiian firms during the past twelve
months.
The Australia brought up the first con
signment of taro flour ever brought to
this country.' She has 204 r sacks for Wil
liam Hires of Chicago. The people of that
city will have a chance to .ample regular
Hawaiian poi in the near future. The offi
cers of the steamer are wondering just
what use will be made of the flour, as poi,
is an article of diet which requires a cul
tivate d palate to '.horoughlyaporeciate it.

Carlson had an arm and a leg broken,
and would undoubtedly have drowned
had not Ornquist jumped overboard after
him. The BurgeÂ«a sailed for Puget Sound
last Tuesday. While nt work on the
royal-yard Carlson lost his footing and
fell, In his descent he struck tbe braces
and broke his arm and leg. He was
thrown into the sea, and being powerless

John M. Cunningham's will was filed
for probate yesterday. The document
bequeaths $5000 to Luther Wagoner, $5 to
Clara Cunningham, daughter of testator,
and provides for the payment of $1000 a
year to his mother, Sarah' E. Cunning
ham, during her life, and makes Mrs.
Ciara E. Cunningbam, the widow,
residuary legatee and executrix without
bonds. ~S ?;.__ \-' ,..:"
The will explains that no special pro
vision was made for the cbildren of the
decedent because he trusted their care
and education to their mother. The
proving of the will has been set for the
Sth of next month in Judge Slack's court.
The value of the estate is not stated in
the petition for probate, but it is known
to be of considerable magnitude. The
will is dated August 29, 1891.

MINES MAY BE
LOCATED SIMPLY
The California Miner's Asso
ciation Frames a New ,
Law-
Describes How Mineral Claims
May Henceforth Be .
Taken Up. c
"~ ~~ . â 
Will Abolish Old District Recording.
Posting of Notices on New
Properties,
The California State Miners' Association
has taken in hand a matter that will be of
deep interest to eyery > mine-owner or
claim-owner and to every prospective or
future locator of mining claims in the
State. At present many claims are lo
cated under district and Federal laws, but
the Federal laws themselves contemplate
local or rather State legislation. Califor
nia has never taken advantage of this
privilege, and the Miners' Association is
now seeking to avail itself of that privilege.
At one of the last meetings of that body
the matter of framing an act prescribing
the manner of locating mining claims,
recording notices of location, amending
defective locations, etc., was referred to the
committee on tbe revision of mining laws.
This committee is composed of able lawyers
and practical mining men, and consists of
Judge Curtis H. Lindsey, Senator T. L.
Ford. C. W. Cross, Frederick Searles, Ross
E. Brown, W. S. Keyes, A. H. Ricketts
and J. F. Halloran. After much labor
these gentlemen, have prepared an act
which was adopted last evening by the
majority of tbe committee. This week it
will be submiteed to the executive com
mittee of the association. If approved
by the executive committee the act will
be sent to Sacramento on Monday, to be
presented to the Legislature for enact
ment. This supplemental act to the Fed
eral laws reads as follows:
An act prescribing the manner of locating
mining claims and millsites upon the public
domain of the United States, recording notices

tions and providing for the deposit of district
records with County Recorders.

Little Boy Acrobats.
The attention of Secretary Walsh of the So
ciety for the Prevention of : Cruelty to Chil
dren was called to the fact that two .lads,
members of an acrobatic company now per
forming at the Orpheum, wero under the age
permitted under the Stato law for such exhibi
tions. The lads are 16 and 14 years of age and
they appear with the Frantz family. "Inquiry
developed the fact that their names are Fred
and Walter Harab and that they are sons of
John Lamb of Birmingham, England. In De
cember, .1894," the father apprenticed the
youngsters to the Frantz family, who are to
teach the boys 'to: become professional acro
bats. Frantz, upon learning that he would
violate the State law by permitting the little
fellows to perform, stated that he would not
let them go on, as there are pletny in the
troupe without them. ' â â ','â ".

Third street is to be the next to follow
in the line of light. Business men and
property-owners from Townsend street to
Market are working to the desired end,
and it is expected that in. a few days a
sufficient number, of subscriptions will
have been secured. Indeed, there have
been secured already almost enough to
string the lamps from Mission street to
Townsend. The link to be supplied is
the short one from Mission street to Mar
ket, and these will probably add their sig
natures to-day.
The passion for "more light" is epi
demic and irresistible. With the lighting
of Kearny street came the natural desire
of business men on Third street to see
the string of dazzlers stretch "on and on"
past their places of business. The con
summation is about to be reached.

OLYMPIC GUN CLUB.
It Will Not Give a Bench Show Until
the Pacific Kennel Club
Disband*.
The officers of the Olympic Gun Glub
met last evening at its handsomely fur
nished clubroom, 1309 Van Ness avenue,
and discussed â  the proposition of holding
a bench show this year in this City.
A committee from the Pacific Kennel
Club reported that the directors of the
Pacific Kennel Club concluded not to give
a bench show this year, but in the event
of the Olympic Gun Club deciding to give
a show under its auspices the members
of the Pacific Kennel Club would sup
port it. ;'.-j"; 'â '.'â¢
After considerable discussion the Olym
pic Gun Club decided that it would not
give a show as long as the Pacific Kennel
Club was in existence, as it had no desire
to conflict with the supposed good inten
tions of the old club.
On next Wednesday evening a meeting
of the Gun Club will be held to hear the
final report of the committee which' was
appointed purposely to procure the views
of the members of the Pacific Kennel
Club, and if a majority of those members
decide that :. the Pacific Kennel Club
should disband, then the Olympic Gun
Club will go ahead and give a show, as
no stumbling- block will then be in its
road to offset a venture which it has every
reason to believe will. eventually result in
a grand success.

The Board of Education
Faces an Enormous
Deficit-
Must Either Stop for One Month
or Reduce Salaries of ;
Employes-
What Happened at a Secret Ssssion
on the Financial Report Last
Evening.
It has come to this at lastâ the public
schools of San Francisco must close for a
month before the next summer vacation,
for the reason that there is not enough
money appropriated to keep them open.
'_ Or it may be another equally drastic
alternative in economyâ the salaries of all
employes must be reduced in a ratio to
be determined according to the various
amounts received by teachers. Nobody
is to be spared in the School Department
if this measure be accepted, but this is to
depend on the willingness of teachers.
. Anyhow, as the question now looms up
before the Board of Education and the
employes, it is said to be simply whether
teachers choose to do no work for no pay
for one month or to work for reduced
salaries for six months. For in either
event they will be no better off financially
at the end of this six months' term end
ing June 30, 1897.
Beyond this bold stroke in financiering
there will be no expenditures for printing,
for repairs or for supplies until after
July 1 next.
Other matters are in view, all tending
toward the same end. So far, however, it
cannot be said that any definite conclu
sion has been reached in this direction;
though, indeed, the nnassigned teachers
may be refused salary except for the time
they are actually employed in leeching,

The Board of Education came face to
face with the subject last night, and met
it bravely in a secret session that lasted
until nearly midnight. Every member of
the board was present at the meeting, or
at least they were all seen to enter and
leave the council chamber.
School Director Samuel L. Waller, chair
man of the finance committee, presented
an interesting report on the condition of
things, which the board regarded as de
cidedly blue.
The report engaged the attention of the
meeting to the exclusion of every other
subject. It was full of figures of course,
but one line stood out in strong relief at
the end: "Total estimated deficiency to
July 1, 1897, $90,245 45." The estimate of
available lunus wus $500,000, on which to
keep the schools going from January 1 tb
July 1. The estimate for salaries of teach
ers for that time was $450,007 55; janitors.'
salaries, $-5,506 40; oflice salaries, $4055;
shop salaries $3615.
The expenditures estimated for rent
was $750, school census $5000, gas and elec
tric lights $2700, fuel $2180, postage $15".
The total overdraft on January 1, 1897, was
$41,308 50, in addition to which was the
half month's salary retained in Novem
ber, 1896, amounting to $37,973 10. These
two items represent the excess of expend
itures made by the last Board of Educa
tion.
The estimated deficit for the present
half year was placed at $35,272 45, and the
estimate of the deficit in the State appor
tionment and amount received $17,000.
The total estimated deficit was $90,245 55.
. These figures make no promiou ior
buildings, repairs, supplies or printing.
In thelast six months of 1896 the printing
bills amounted to $894 supplies $14,
--83169 buildings ana grounds $26,554 96,
and the special fund for five mouths was
$70,471 84.
Atter discussing the report in every de
tail the board came to the conclusion that
either the schools should be closed for one
month or salaries reduced as the only ap
parent way out of the dilemma. ...
An* with this conviction in the mind of
each member the meeting adjourned until
next Wednesday evening, when action
will be taken on the matter.
The law makes no provision for the pay
ment of salaries for time in which the
schools may be closed, but teachers must
be paid during vacation. So the idle
month will be an additional rest this
season. _____________________

Decree of Court.

Judge Slack of the Superior Court yes
terday banded down a decision declaring
that Lillian A. Ashley has no right to re
cover damages from E. J. Baldwin on the
Charge of betrayal. She asked* the court
to award her $ICO,OOO worth of Baldwin's
property, alleging that the great wealth of
the proprietor of the Baldwin Hotel and
â¢ the Santa Anita rancho made him amply
able to respond in the sum demanded.
â While Judge Slack gave judgment for
the defendant he availed himself of the
opportunity to severely criticize the de
fendant and to point out that he had no
i sense of the shameful humiliation to
which his conduct had subjected him.
Touching the circumstances of the hear
ing of the case Judge Slack says:
The task of the court has been an exceed
ingly unpleasant one. The trial was pro
tracted and full of disagreeable incidents. A
vast amount of evidence, oral and docu
mentary, was presented. Much of the testi
mony on both sides is in itseli not to be relied
upon, but requires corroboration to be be
. lieved. If is possible, however, to separate the
â¢ truth from the fabrications, and to reach what
â¢is believed to be a correct conclusion. The
wealth of the defendant and the poverty of
the plaintiff, with the consequent advantage
on the one side and the disadvantage on the
other, have been so frequently pressed upon
the attention of the court during the progress
of the case that the position of the parties
may be somewhat equalized by resting the
decision upon the plaintiff's own testimony
and her written admissions contained in her
numerous letters. So far as counsel are con
cerned neither side can be said to have had an
advantage, and the plaintiff, were she as
wealthy as the defendant, could not have se
cured the services of a more zealous advocate,
whose loyalty to his unfortunate client can

MISS TAI FLIES
WITH A TRAGEDIAN
The Thrilling Story of a
Love Episode in
Chinatown.
Elopement of a Sacramento-
Street Belle With an ,
Actor and $q6.
How a Stage Hero Found F ver With
a Ycung Wife While H?r
Husband Was Away.
Tbe story of how the affections of Chang
. Tai Hai. alias Lucy, alias Miss Tai, were
alienated from Wong Mcc Hee, her hus
band, where once they were centered, will j
be told before the Grand Jury at its next j
session. The purpose is to recover to I
Wong Mcc Hee, at least, the person of the
tickle young woman together with the
value of $121 belonging to the deserted
husband. It is not even hoped that the
processes of law will ever be able to secure
to Hee in any great degree of their one
time ardor the affections of Miss Tai.
It is feared they have flown forever. But
in order to regain as much as may be a
requisition must first be secured from the
Hawaiian Government, to the protection
of which Miss Tai fled in company with
I_eong Ah Him, alias Ah Chew, a China
town actor, so long ago as the 23d of last
July.
It is supposed that the eloping couple
. have tired of one another by this time and
that Miss Tai may be willing to return to j
her busb -nd. At any rate the Hawaiian
Government will not recognize the demand
of a Police Court Judge for the return of
an individual to the jurisdiction of the
United States, but it will recognize an in
dictment by a Grand Jury. For this rea- I
son Barclay Henley, as counsel for Wong
Mcc Hee, will bring a list of witnesses
â¢ before that body next week and have them
tell the unhappy tale of the undoing of
Hee and TaL
This is tbe tale: Wong Mcc Hee iÂ« an
- industrious Chinaman, who works when >
/ he has a job, and when he has no job he
works industriously seeking one. Chang
l Tai Hai, alias Lucy, alias Miss Tai, is the
v wife of Hee, of whom he is or was very
fond. He took much pride in seeing her
promenade up and down the streets of
Qhinatown dressed in bright-colored
satins, her hair combed in heavy braids
â¢and shining with oil, while her feet were
encased in shoes so small that she baited
and hobbled quite like a lady.
... With all his pride in his young wife j
Wong Mcc Hee was as saving as he was j
industrious, for he dreamed of a day when
they would together take passage in the
steerage of a trans-Pacilic steamer for the
Flowery Kingdom, there to ride in rick
shas and live in tone, with the upper
classes. . '.
To that end he had stowed away in a
secret drawer in the Bxlo subterranean ceil
at 808 Sacramento street that Hee and Tai
called their house bit by bit of silver until i
there was within $4 of being a round $100. |
Last summer Wong Mcc .Hee had a job I
in Alameda and every morning he took j
the early boat and did not return to his
home until evening. Miss Tai was, there
fore, much alone, or would have been had
she remained at home. But she dia not.
When she felt lonesome she would put on
her whitest Blockings and her prettiest
finery, spending much time over her
" toilet, and would then go abroad, promen
ading on Dapont and Jackson streets.
One day she went to me theater to while
away an afternoon and there Leong Ah
Him, alias Ah Chew, who is an actor, a
tragedian, saw her in one of the boxes and
the peace of mind and the prop', rty of
Wong Hee were doomed. .
l The tragedian looked hard at Miss Tai
I and her. heart beat rapidly. After that
1 she came to tbe theater almost daily, and
\no doubt Leong Ah Him, who appeared
on the bills as Ah Chew, soon secured for
her a pass. But that is. mere conjecture
and has therefore no place in .this story.
But this; is true that they soon became
lovers, Leong Ah Him, hen not re
hearsing or playing his part on the stage
. â and being certain that Wong Mcc Hee
â ftas attending to his labors in Alameda â
for the purpose of the decision, has not been
an unequal one. "-;>â >> â¢
. Crittenden was attorney for Miss Ashley
and Messrs. Lloyd and Wood and Henry
E. High ton appeared for Baldwin.
The story of Miss Ashley's life is taken
up and considered by the court. She ap
pears to have lived quietly from her birth,
in 1868, until in 18S6 she left her native
place, Turnbridge, Vt., and went to Bos
ton, Mass., for a visit. Then she met
John Osborn, became acquainted with
him on the cars without an introduction,
bad her photograph taken with bim, her
arm resting on his shoulder; accepted
jewelry from him, dined with him and
went with him to the theater. Speaking
of 03born and Miss Ashley the court says:
Exactly what transpired between them then
and afterward cannot be determined, because
it largely depends upon statements by the
one and denied by the other. Osborn swears
to intimacy with the plaintiff at several places ;
in Boston.' which the plaintiff denies. What
Osborn says In this particular may be dis
missed with the remark, thai a creature who
is so low in the scale of hnmanity as to volun
teer such testimony of his own moral
obliquity, incriminating an unfortunate ,
woman, and to consent to come from Oregon
to give it at a stipend of $5 per day. Is, unless
corroborated, utterly unworthy of belie!. The
testimony of both parties, however, does show
that their relations were of a somewhat free
character.
After discrediting and passing censure
on Witnesses O'Keefe. Wood and Barnes,
all residents cf Boston, the court con
cludes that there is enough evidence to
show that Miss Ashley's life was not
without blemishes daring her stay in Bos
ton, and several of her letters are quoted
to show that this conclusion is well
founded. These letters were variously ad
dressedâto horsemen and sporting gen
i tlemen..
Colonel H. C. Chamblin's testimony is
(declared to "bear the stamp of truthful
! ness," and he is exonerated from blame or
i complicity in tbe matter.
Miss A.hlev's confession of her relations
I with Colonel Albert A. Pope of Boston,
i Mass., was then taken up by the court,
and it was found that this was established
by her own testimony in open court, j
Judge Slack was of the "opinion that thes.
relations were voluntary on her part: that
he paid her $150 on the occasion of their
first meeting in the Albemarle Hotel in
Boston, and that he subsequently gave
her sums of money aggregating about
$3250, finally obtaining from her a release
of all claims against him. He bought her
a little home in Pasadena, Cai., for $2000.
His Honor, with a touch of weariness,
remarked that Miss Ashley's letters to
Baldwin "are too lone to be reproduced
in full," notwithstanding the fact that he
| devoted about 12,000 words to the decision;
but he quotes from the correspondence in
a way to show the general tenor of her
thoughts. At the outset she appears to
think well of the proposition of being !
"adopted in a nice sort of a way" by him;
but subsequently she drops into the labit
of calling mm "Lucky" Baldwin and her
missives contain many suggestive pass
ages that would be likely to give offense
to persons less prudish than even the
master of Santa Anito rancho is in the
| decision said to be. The court finds that
! there never was a genuine proposition for
[ Baldwin to legally adopt her, an adult
was constantly by the side of Miss Tai.
She took him to her home and showed
him the secret drawer and the $96. It
was enough. Leong Ah Him spoke
swiftly and fervently, painting a picture
of pleasure that would be hers if Miss
Tai flew with him and became the bride
or mistress of the great actor. Ah Chew.
They looked up thesailns dates of vessels.
On the evening of the 23d of Jnly Wong
Mcc Hee came home from Alameda weary
from his day's labor. Tai did not wel
come him as usual, nor was the bowl of
hot rice awaiting him. The Bxlo felt like
desolation. Tai did not answer him when
he called. Then he suddenly recalled
some suspicious circumstances, of which
there had been a thousand, that his un
suspecting industry and patience and de
votion had not noticed. With his heart
beating as rapidly as had that of Tai that
day in the spring when she sat in the box
and the tragedian had allowed his eye to
rest on tier pretty face for a distinct in
stant, Wong Hee opened the secret drawer
and found it empty. Ah! then there was
a great stir in Chinatown. Wong rushed
into the street crying the names of all the
calendar of crime-.. His queue swashed
this way and that like a loose hawser in
a storm, his wooden shoes clattered over
the cobbles as he rushed from the side
walk to the street and back again, open
ing and slamming shut the doors oi the
merchants, yelling all the while murder
and thief so that no one understood him,
and as only a mad Chinaman will.
Wong Mcc Hee was counseled to seek a
lawyer, and he did. Inquiries were sent
on foot to discover the whereabouts of the
couple, and these have been successful.
Barclay Henley marched at the head of a
procession of Chinamen who can tell this
story in the waiting-room of the Grand
Jury, yesterday, but the investigation of
Judge Campbell was taking up so much
time that he was advised to come back
next Friday. He wishes to have Ah
Chew indicted for alienating the affections
of Miss Tai, so that they (Miss Tat and the
tragedian) may be trought back â they
and the $.96 and the beaver coat and the
bracelet. B___fiS_J<3_l

Lewis, and she will make her presence known in the theatrical world under the
pseudonym of Juliet Crosley. She ia--tbe daughter of a Suisun capitalist and is
iust 20 years or age. Miss Lewis is very prominent in local society circles. She
was born in New York City, and came to California when only a child. She was
educated in the public schools and graduated with high honors from the Van Ness
Seminary in 1894. Since a child she has expressed a desire to go on the stage, but
her parents objected, so she took up teaching and. instructed the youthful idea
how to shoot in the primary department of the seminary during 1895 and a part of
1896. During tho time that she was teaching. Miss Lewis studied under Mr..
Frances Edgerton and also with Frederick Belasco. During a few weeks' visit in

She is an artist of no mean ability, sings well and has done meritorious literary
work for some leading Eastern magazines. She is also an accomplished linguist

wants to gain that experience which comes only by joining a stock company.

woman who was a perfect stranger to him
and whose photograph he had never seen.
.In one letter/dated at Richmond, Va.,
Miss Ashley tells Baldwin that she took
chloral and tried to drown herself. She
wrote : ________
I have not been myself at all, because am
cared for as a little child, not capable
of taking care of myself, and no wonder I
drank chloral last April and tried to drown
myself. You would do the same or more, If
you were only a girl surrounded by a lot of old
"gone-by" society ladles, who lecture you to
death by their tongues if they ever saw a gen
tleman speak to you. Now a spirited girl like
I objects to being always kept down this way,
and never have a gentleman friend, so this
time I just ran away, and my sole object was
to run right to your arms and ask peace and
protection. But my money gave out, and I.
could not go on without the ducats, so have
waited for you so patiently as my only hope
from being taken back to Boston. Telesrrams
will fly, and I am already found. Oh, if only
could telegraph me the money to come to you
I would be in San Francisco as fast as steam
could fetch me.
Baldwin first called on Miss Ashley at
Winchester October 5, 1891, and she ac
companied him to Boston on his way home.
In a subsequent letter she asked to be
helped to California, and added:
I will give you a pretty little secret of the
schoolgirls now in rage, and that is silk under
clothes. All a girl's underwear, â  beginning
with the stockings up to the petticoat and cor
set waist, are dainty silK trimmed with silk
cobweb lace: all pretty pale evening shades,
blue, pink, yellow, etc. They are home-made,
and 1 know just how. All I lack is the mate
rial to do with. Suppose some nice California
gentleman I know (E. J. B.) sent it to, me, or
the money to buy it. Oh, what supreme de
light. *..*.-* With a world of love to you, I
am as ever, Lilly.
The defendant never answered this
letter.
Touching the allegation that Baldwin
followed Miss Ashley the court says: v
The letters show the plaintiff's pursuit of the
defendant rather than the converse. The cor
respondence here ceased ior a time, for the
evident reason that the plaintiff had become
enamored of .Pope.
After a short acquaintance Pope wanted
her to travel and offered hei $200 a month
to go to California or Australia.
Baldwin's letters are sparingly quoted
by the court. They are not happily
phrased, though possibly less suggestive
ihan the woman's missives.
Continuing the history of the case Judge
Slack says:
On March 2, 1893, the plaintiff*, accepting |
the defendant's invitation, came to San Fran
cisco, the defendant meeting her and she ac- â¢
companying him to the Baldwin Hotel, a hotel I
owned by him, where he registered hor as
"Mr?. Ash ton," evidently hy an understanding |
between them. The plaintiff was at this time j
a mature and robust woman 25 years.of age.' j
Seven months before she had submitted her- j
self to the embraces of Pope, for whom she ]
then and afterward, to use her own words, \
had an undying love. Less than a month had \
passed since she left Boston with money given
ncr by this man lor the purpose of concealing
their guilty relations. How can it be c. aimed
in the face of such indisputable proof thai she
was an innocent girl unaccustomed to the
i ways of th.Â« world, allured to her ruin by the
i defendant? What did she expect of the
deiendant when she should meet him, and
what did he expect of her?
In discussing the testimony of Baldwin
relating to the occurrences at the Baldwin
i Hotel, the court says:
THEY STARTED TO
FIGHT THE WORLD
Little Paul and Johnnie
Peyser Were on the
Warpath.
They Abandoned , Their Home
Â§ Here and Were Captured
in San Rafael.
Const.be J hn Maher, Who Stopped
Them, Was Himself P aced
Under Ari\ st.
Little Paul and John Peyser of 206 Mc-
Allister street slept in their comfortable
cots last night, carefully guarded by both
mamma and papa Peyser. What these
little urchins have not made their parents
suffer during the past couple of days
would go to complete volumes written
about Dante's "Inferno."
Paul is the big one of the two, being just
six years older than Johnny, who is hut 8
years of age, and who is the itreatest ad
mirer Paul may ever have.
Paul attends the. public schools and is
frequently under the ban of demerits. It
was not that he cured so much about
this, but that his teacher presented him
with a telltale card on Friday afternoon
No more disgusting testimony than the ac
count of the aged defendant of what took
place on this and other occasions, disclosing
a totally depraved nature, could ever have
been more unblushingly uttered. The con
duct of the plaintiff was without a mitigating
circumstance, but that of the defendant also
deserves the severest condemnation. The de
fendant was at this time a man nearly 66
years of age. He had been married several
times and had grown-up daughters. His then
wife, to whom he had been married' about
nine years, was living with him in a residence
a short distance from the Baldwin Hotel. His
illicit relations during the later years of his
life with at least half a dozen women, evi
dence of which, in one way or another, crept
into the case, he did not attempt to deny. He
has no sense of shame whatever. T .v: ;'â > .â â¢".
In 1893 Miss Ashley went to Boston,
settled with Pope and returned to Cali
fornia, where she gave birth to a child, of
which, in the judgment of the court, E. J.
Baldwin is the father.
Judge Slack sums up the testimony in
this way: . , ' , i
In the face of the foregoing evidence, gath
ered iv the main from the plaintiff herself, is
there any doubt what conclusion ought to be
reached in this case? Was tn*_ro any betrayal
of confidence necessary to exist in. order to
make out a cause of action for- seduction?
What are the auswers'ot the plaintiff and what
are the arguments upon which she claims to
be entitle. 1 to a judgment for damages for
seduction? Simply these: That she was chaste
for a period of seven months prior to her inter
course with the defendant, and that on who
invites a woman to his hotel guarantees her
immunity from evil. How was she supported
during those seven months? Who furnished
the means tor her to come to California, and
why and at whose instance aid she come here
at all? Let these questions be answered by a
usal of the foregoing.
The concluding word., of the court are :
It is difficult to say which of the parties is
the more to blameâ the plaintiff for prosecut
ing this action or the defendant fot de lend
ing it. It is foul on both sides without measure.
The deieudant must be treed witnout punish
ment, not because he is innocent, but because
the plaintiff is guilty. A final blow, severe
but just, must regretfully and with pity be
given the unfortunate plaintiff, and she must
go forth burdened with the offspring which
the defendant, by all the laws of morality but
not of mankind, is bound to support. Let
judgment be entered for the defendant.
Notice of appeal has been given the ap
plication lor a new trial, being based on
alleged errors occurring at the trial, but
principally, it is said, because of the ruliug
by the court which denied Miss Ashley
the services of a jury in the case because
of her inability to pay the fees of the jury
men. The fee bill of 1895 is not clearly
worded, and it is held by some of the
Judges of the Superior Court that a liti
gant is entitled to the services of a jury at
the public expense as much as he is enti
| tled to the services of a Judga whose sal- j
I ary is paid by the community at large. |
i The new fee bill does not make any dis
j tinction in regard to the jurors, and Judge
Slack's ruling; that the party demanding a i
I jury shall advance the fees therefor, sub
ject to recovering the money fj-om the op
posite side as costs if successful in the
suit, is based on the provisions of the
code in regard to the settlement of cot
b lis in civil cases. This point has never
been passed on by the Supreme Court, and
the decision in regard to it may play an
important part in the future prosecution of
Miss Ashley's suit against Baldwin.
that he must take to his horne â the offi
cial record of his misbehavior.
Paul could bear almost anything but
this, so he qnietly tore up the bit of paste
bo:* rd and kept his own counsel.
On Sunday he enlisted the attention of
little. Johnny, telling him of the worlds
they could conquer could they only get
away from mamma and papa for a little
while. They would take away a light
bundle of clothes to keep tbem warm dur
ing the winter, and they would likewise
take with them the little parlor rifle papa
has in the bedroom closet. N
Well, Johnny listened to Paul. He was
convinced bis big brother must be right
and Monday morning, instead of going to
school, the lads went out to face tha world.
They strayed toward the ferry and em
barked on the first boat that would make
them believe that they were "pirates of
the Spanish main."
It was tne ferry to Tiburon and the two
well-dressed, ' pretty boys, behaving as
they did, like play toy cowboys, holding
up the pa.Â«sengers with an empty rifle
for they had lorgotten to take cartridges
with them â created the impression that
they were some spoiled urchins whose
parents were on the upper deck.
T.ey got off the train at San Rafael and
began their same cowboy antics.
"Where are you going?" asked Constable
Johnny Maber. jJli'llliiiPlllilll
"Throw up your hands!" exclaimed
Paul in answer.
Maher grabbed the two little runaways
and they both began to cry.
Tbey soon told their stories and Maher
took them to his. home to rest for the
night.
Yesterday morning Maher brought the
lads home to this City, where weeping
parents forgave them for past errors.
But the peculiar phase of this entire
affair is that Johnny Maher, kind-hearted
and conscientious, ran himself into an
ugly predicament when he reached here.

The question of precedence between the
State and Federal quarantine officers has
at last come to a head, tor months there
has been friction, but Dr. Chalmers in.
variably gave way, until now he considers
patience has ceased to be a virtue.
Last night the Umatilla arrived from
Puget Sound ports, and the United States
quarantine officers boarded her off Fort
Point. After inspecting her bills of health
the physician took sixteen Japanese from
the steerage, and, putting them aboard the
quarantine steamer Sternberg, landed
them on Angel Island for further inspec
tion. Later on Dr. Chalmers, as the rep
resentative of the State, boarded the
steamer, and finding there were no Japan
ese aboard, and that the captain's report
showed that no deaths had occurred dur
ing the voyage, he refused to allow the
passengers to land. Then there was a
deadlock, Captain Hunter pointed out
that a duly accredited United States offi
cer had removed the Japanese, and that
to ho:_ the other passengers would work
a hardship. Quarantine Officer Chalmers
finally agreed to lay the matter before J.
M. Williamson, M.D., chairman of the
quarantine committee of the Board of
Health, and he and the captain went to
his office. Finally Captain Hunter was
granted a certificate, with the following
note attached:
The accompanying certificate is granted
tinder protest and as a matter of courtesy to
the detained passengers and to the captain of
the steamship Umatilla, who accepted the
statement of the Federal Quarantine Officer
that the Federal certificate alone would en
title him to dock. The action of the Federal
Quarantine Officer in removing the sixteen
Japanese passengers to quarantine before they
were inspected by the State Quarantine Officer
Is in direct violation of the laws of this State,
and will call for a protest from the Board of
Health against such action in the future. The
action of the captain of tne steamship Uma
tilla in permitting th" passengers to be re
moved before their inspection' by the State
Quarantine Oflicer is also in violation of the
law, and for that reason -the vessel was de
tained.
It will be the intention of the Board of
Health to resist all such unwarranted assump
tion of authority on the part of the Federal
officials, and shipmasters who proceed to dock
without the Statu Quarantine Officer's certifi
cate will be dealt with according to the pro
visions of the. Political Code of tho State of
California, section 3014.
John M. Williamson, M.D.,
Chairman Quarantine Committee.
As the case stands at present a deadlock
is imminent arid shipping will suffer.
The next steamer that conies in and has
not her full passenger list or the missing
accounted for by some other reason than
"removed by the United Stales quarantine
officer" will not be allowed to dock. Dr.
Chalmers will refuse to tive her a bill of
health and the captain will land his pas
sengers at his peril. Then, on the other
hand, he has to face ail the powers
placed in the hands of a duly accredited
officer of the United States quarantine
service and thus be placed between two
fires. __OP__
The Umatilla got in about 6 p. m. and
it was nearly three hours later before any
of the passengers were allowed to land.
"The whole matter simply amounted to
this," said Dr. Chalmers last night. "The
Umatilla arrived from Puget Sound ports
about sundown, and tbe Federal quar
antine â¢ officer boarded her off Fort
Point. There were sixteen Japanese
aboard, and these he took away with
him on the lug. With these people
missing how could I give a clean
bill of health? I refused to do so,
and told the captain his passengers could
not iand. I then reported the matter to
Dr. Williamson, and he finally decided to
pass the vessel. A Japanese was taken off
the Victoria steamer on the last trip and
I overlooked the mutter, but in future
masters of vessels will be compelled to
comply with the laws of the State of Cali
fornia."
Masters of vessels are worked up con
siderably over the whole matter. With
two sets of authorities to please they are
in a quandary as to which to obey. When
the Monowai arrived Iron Australia, Dr.
Chalmers passed her, but Dr. Rosenau
detained the vessel for several hour., and
then he passed the steerage passengers in
short order. In fact, he was not ten min
utes all told on the steamer. In the case
ofthe Orizaba, whic.i arrived from Mexico
last Sunday, the steerage passengers were
detained for nearly ten hours, awaiting
the pleasure of the United States quaran
tine officer. As matters stand at present,'
captains of foreign vessels are between
the devil and the deeDsea.and steerage
passengers have to suffer in consequence
The matter was token up at the meeting
of the Board of Health last night, and it
was decided to consult the Washington
authorities in order to prevent further
trouble. ; Â
According to the recent census the pop
ulation of Greece is 2,418,000 souls, or an
increase of 230,000 over the figures oi 1889.

days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of i
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect Xkjii s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "Inch" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weatherand rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. Whin the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
ihe pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected In summer and colder
weathor in winter. The reverse of these conditions

NEW TOKK MARKETS.
.Financial.
NEW YOBK, N. V.. Jan. 20.â There was a
further falling off in the volume of business at the
stock Kxchange to-day and the market was de
pressed by the receipt of lower quotations from
London and the Continent. According to cable
advices the foreign markets were weakened by
the arrival at Hamburg of a steamer with a case
of bubonic plague on board. The bears here tried
to make capital from tbis and hammered the list
vigorously at intervals. They met with little suc
cess, however, outside of coal slocks. Susque
hanna and Wester i preferred suddenly broke 3*^
points to 22 i/i on the announcement that a deci
sion had been rendered against the company at
. stroudsburg. Pa., in its litigation with the Dela
ware, Lackawanna and Western.
Jersey Central at the same time yielded 3%.
Delaware and Hudson % and Susquehanna and
Western common 2% per cent. The general list
was irregular and In the mail lower. Tne decline
was equal to %to 1%, Manhattan leading. The
dealings, however, were small a.d confined largely
to room traders. The leading commission houses
reported a liberal decrease In outside orders. In
the law trading Susquehanna and Western pre
ferred rallied about 2 points and the rest of the
list recovered VsÂ® 6 from the low point. Among
the st eciallies Illinois steel broke 4 to 38 on the
circulation of unfavorable rumors in regard to the
finances of the company.
. .Late in the .lay ii was announced that the com
pany had effec ed a loan of $1,000,000 for one
year with the United suites Trust company of
this city, which it is asserted will enable it to
pay off its floating debt obligations. The fa.t that
the company has had to shut down Its steel rail
department, however, was used against the stock.
The selling of the a. tive Issues, such us Sugar,'
Chicago Gas, the (-rangers and Louis vile and
Nashville was chiefly for short account and a lair
borrowing demand pre val.
Speculation closed about steiftiy in tone. Net
chang '8 show declines of % to 2% per cent in
the usually active shares and %Â«.1% in the
coals. .
ln the specialties Illinois Steel dropped 4 to 68.
Total sales were 154,874, Including 29.600 shares
of sugar, 14,900 St. Paul, 14,600 Chicago Gas,
13,1.0 Burlington and 9200 Heading.

111 <.(> MARKETS. '
CHICAGO, li^,. Jan. 20.â Reported sales of
j 200,000 busbels*of wheat nt St. Louis for export
I had a temporary stimulating effect on prices of
that grain in this market this morning. The open
ing was firm on Liverpool's failure to fully recog
nize our break yesterday; then the report from St.
Louis helped values, but when a doubt as to lie
accuracy of the business claimed was expressed
prices hedged off, lower quotations than yester
day's closing being made. Business was mostly of
a local character, although some selling orders
from abroad were said to be on the market. Be
ceipts at Chicago were 29 cars, ana 92,984 bushels
wer- withdrawn from store.
'Ihe Northwest had 212 cars, against 213 last
â¢ Wednesday and 265 a year ago. A report that
two or three million acres of the Russian crop
wat winter killed helped prices for a time, but the
j bearish sentiment prevailed subsequently. Ex
i port clearance" amounted to 321,611 bushels.
i Closing Paris cables were higher for flour and un
i changed for wheat. Antwerp was unchanged
and Berlin slightly lower. A b'lge at the close
1 was due to reports of more cash business at St.
Bonis. May wnsat opened at from 79% cto
7934 c, sold between 79% c and 8-.i_Â®BJ3_c,

to 89V.C, closing about 88',_Â®89l
CoBNâ The lone of the corn market varied little
if any at all from that of wheat. In the morning
early it was firmer, prices were up. but the
strength vanished and recessions ware then ln
order. Receipts were 211 cars and 81.326 bushels
were taken from store. Liverpool cables were
quiet and unchanged. Exports were heavy at
600,918 bushels. A rally occurred at the dose in
sympathy with whea . being the controlling fac
tor. May corn opened at 2 11,4 c, sold between
243/ c and 24'224Vic, closing at 245/ c. Vs' 1 ? I.'-'1 .'-'

morrow 215 cars.
OATSâ The oats market was distinctly a sympa
thetic one. tbe advances and declines of wheat and
corn being faithfully reproduced. Receipts were
183 cars and .94 6 bushels were withdrawn from
store. Tnere were no export clearances. May oats
closed unchanged from yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts f r to-morrow 175 cars.

AND CHARACTER
Arrest of W. B. Gay oi
Alameda on a Charge
of Bigamy.
Warrant Sworn to by a Woman
Who Says She Is
His Wife.
Her Peculiar Story Told to Justic
Morris in Court Yes
terday.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 20.â W. B. Gay
is locked in tbe City Prison charged with
bigamy. Mrs. Nellie Gay, his wife from
Pueblo, Colo., who claims to be wife num
ber three, appeared this morning before
Justice Morris and related her experience.
The Justice made a flying trip to the
District Attorney's oflice and then tele
phoned to Chief of Police Rogers to
take Gay into custody. Officer Gunn vis
ited Gay's residence at 2301 Alameda
avenue, and placed the young man under
arrest. He made no statement but ac
companied the officer without comment.
Later the present Mrs. Gay called at the
station and visited him. "When seen this
afternoon she refused positively to say a
word. She is staying at the home of Mrs.
Lucy Knight, who is a distant relative,
bne did not appear to be very much con
cerned as to the outcome of the case.
. Mrs. Gay from Pueblo wept bitterly
when she signed the complaint, and de
clared that she loved the man better than
her life, but she could not permit him to
ruin any more lives than he already bad.
In telling her story Mrs. Gay said:
I had been a wiaow for a period of seven
rears after the death of my first husband. After
knowing Mr. Gay for nearly a year 1 married
him. He had loved and petted my daughter
Sadie so that I thought there never wou id be
the least trouble^ Imagine my surprise when
within six hours of our marriage he told me
he was the boss of the house, and he -bused
little Sadie shamefully. I lived witn him tor
five months, and then left him because he
kicked the child.
He left for the West, and I was soon taken
to the hospital. While there he wrote me and
told how he loved me and wanted me to come
to nim. He knew I was destitute and could
not go anywhere. Drs. Berry and Rice wrote
to him to send me funds, and then I never saw
or heard of him until to-day.
When 1 found out what he was I began an
investigation. He was born at Summit Sta
tion, N. J. I wrote to '.he Postmaster, who
told me that he lived with his first wife just
Eix weeks. The noble grand oi the Odd Fel
lows judge w rote that he beat her so tbat she
leit him. I accused him of 'hi., and he said
he was divorced alter denying the marriage
until he found I knew ail. He married the
second lime before his first wife was dead.
This union brought forth three childrenâ Ora,
Claude and Mamie. His house burned down
and he left them without a cent and went to
Syracuse. Here he took up with a third
woman, Mamie Holmes, and lived with her
for three years. The noble grand stated that
he abused and choked her until he was placed
in jail. This broke his poor old father up,
and he is now a sufferer from a stroke of
paralysis, said to have been brought on by the
boy's misdoing. This is all in writing and can
be produced at the proper time.
My name before marriage was Mellie Edeau
and my first husband was an Odd Fellow and
Woodman of the World, while I was a Rebekah
and a member of the Woodmen grove. I am
also a mernb?r of the Christian church of
Pueblo and am willing to have my life ex
amined into. He will tell any and everything,
I presume, as he has ol his other wive-. He
told me once t at he wohld tell that he be
came acquainted with me through a newspa
per advertisement, and married me after
knowing me less than a month, but I can
Drove that to be false. I stall certainty punish
him for his iii treatment of my daughter and
me. When I confronted him at the nouse this
afternoon he threw up his hands ana ex
claimed, "Oh Mellie, Mellie, my wife!"
I answered with, "Oh, here is your forsaken
wife tracing you to your den." He acted as if
to' strike me, but I stepped back and said,
"Don't dare strike me, lam protected." Then
he looked to see it any one was around and
begged me to nave a quiet talk. He denied
being married and Â«aid he would explain all.
I declined the offer and asked the young
woman with him if bhe was going to stay with
him. She declared mat she would. On leav
ing he asked me if I loved him, and declared
that he loved me. I spurned him and told
hlm not to mention love to me.

fatal illness, and then rested.
"A hen court adjourned there was a
dramatic little scene. Dr. Sharpe and
Huldah, the dead girl's sister, greeted
enci. other very warmly and. the girl and

-.overs Year* Ago.
.. OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 20.â Many years
ago Mrs. Wagner and Harry Roberts were
lovers in an Eastern viila_e. As school
children they were sweethearts. But
their ways led them apart and they did

of Majors who was hanged some years
ago, and later married John .Wanner,

wife.
Given Ten Tears.
OAKLAND, Cal. Jan. Louis A.
Mublner was sentenced to-day to ten
years at St. Quentin for the murder of
Jennie Lewis in August of 1893. The case
went to the Supreme Court because Judge
Frick refused to accept the verdict of
manslaughter, on the ground that the evi
dence justified a verdict of murder in the
lirst degree. The Supreme Court decided
tbat the verdict of the jury must b3 (sus
tained. ' ; * ,!.;.""
â¢ When asked if he knew of anything why
he should not be sentenced, Muhlner re
plied: "No, sir; but I would preier to go

BUTTERS HAS RETURNED
He Says He Has Lots of English
and German Backing for
His Schemes.
Has Gather* d Much Valuable Infor-
mation Among the Mines in
S uth Africa.
OAKLAND. Cal., Jan. 20. â Charles
Butters returned to Oakland from his
South African trip to-night. On his way
from the East he was joined by his
brother and his wife and by some other
members of the surveying party, and on
their arrival at their home at Piedmont
they were tendered a reception which was
attended by nearly a hundred guests.
"You have heard all about our experi
ence in that Government hotel at Johan
nesburg," said Mr. Butters, laughing. "It
was not very pleasant, but Captain Mem,
who is also a resident of Oakland now, has
told you all about it. However, we ob
tained valuable information about the
mines, and since my return to America
we have been engaged in a very important
task.
"We believe that there are untold quan
tities of low-grade ores in Colorado, Utah
and California that can be. worked at
a profit if capital can be obtained to put
up the necessary plant. We ate convinced
that our system of making thee low
grade ores pay has solved the difficult}',
and our syndicate has unlimited British
and German backing.
"We have just made a very extended
survey of mining districts in Utah and
Colorado, and we are convinced that we
can revolutionize the industry so far as
low-grade ores are concerned^ We have
no experimenting to do, as all tnat has
b en done, and we are prepared to com
mence work. We shall probably buy up
large territories that produce ore that has
hitherto not been paying, and as soon as
we commence operations it will be on a
large scale.
"Our field of operations is unlimited as
the mines in South Africa and Australia
can be worked in addition to those in this
country." . .' :.>.-â 
Mr. Butters will remain here for some
weeks and will then leave on another short
tour. .'>".pigÃP
Mr. Butters is one of the seven Ameri
cans who, with John Hays Hammond,
were arrested by the Boer Government be
cause of their affiliation with the reform
movement in tie Transvaal last year at
the time of Dr. Jamison's raid. Butters
was released May 20, l^ned $1000 and
obliged to give a bond not to interfere in
the political affairs of the Boer Govern
ment for three years. He introduced in
that country for the Rand Central Ore Re
duction Company, of which he" is the
managing director, a new electrical pro
cess for the treatment of refractory ores.

THE SAN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 1897.
BLOCK SYSTEM
NOT INFALLIBLE
It Should Have Prevented
the Collision Tuesday
Night.
Fireman Cornish and the In
jured Lady Passenger Will
Recover.
If the Signals Worked Engineer
Carroll of the Sunset Did Not â¢
Â» See Them.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 20. J
The investigation made to-day into the
cause of last night's collision between tbe
Sunset limited and Berkeley local proved
one of two things. Either the block sys
tem which is laid from the pier to Six
teen street is not infallible, as it is sup
posed to be, or else Engineer Carroll of the
Sunset aid not obey the signal.
Tower Man Meyers declares that the
system is in good working order and
worked all right last night, while Carroll
says that he did not see the danger signal,
which certainly must have been snowing
while the Berkeley train was standing on
the main line. The block system is very
simple and is considered to make rear-end
collisions impossible. Every few hundred
feet is a block and as a train passes along
the signals work automatically â thus, if
the Berkeley train had come to a stand
still at block 8, the danger signal would
still be showing at block 6in its rear. As
a train goes ahead the danger signal falls
and another one appears in the next
block. Consequently a danger signal must
certainly have been seen by Engineer Car
roll when he was far enough astern of the
Berkeley local to have prevented a colli
sion. - -3S*_Â£B __pÂ£_HÃ-l
This is the view taken by trainmen and
which the engineer comradicts. Mr.
Wilder has heard all sides of the case to
day, but has done nothing as yet to indi
cate what verdict he has arrived at in the
premises. ' . , ;â¢ ; V -.
Fireman Cornish, who jumped from his
eneine when he saw the collision was un
avoidable, was resting easily at Fabiola
to-day. One arm is broken . and be is
severely injured about the stomach. But
it is believed he will recover. Mrs.
Lnuritzen, who was in the rear of the
local train, is suffering severely from in
juries to the snine, but her condilionisnot
critical.
The wrecked car was removed early this
moraine and there was no irregularity in
the Berkeley service on account of the
accident.
There has as yet been no reason given
satisfactory to the railroad officials why
Towerman Meyers held the Berkeley local
on the main line instead of giving it the
signal to go ahead. -
Mr. Wilder went to San Francisco to-day
to consult at the bead office of the railroad
company, and under all the circumstances
it is considered likely that both the
engineer and the towerman will be held
partly responsible.

â¢ BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 20. v " The senior
class at the State University met to-day
to devise ways and . means of ' paying I off

Devices.
Disastrous Comb-nation of In

The Sheriff Siz s His Business and
There Is No Trace of the ;
logeniom Greek.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 20.â Where is
C. Demetrak? is a question that many
Berkeleyans are asking just now, for the
well-known Greek appears to have shaken
the dust of the university town from bis
feet for good.
Demetrak conducted a leading produce
store on Shattuck avenue, the door of
which now bears a Sheriff's lock. - Inci
dentally the merchant dabbled in quite a
variety of otber enterprises, tbe most in
teresting of which was the construction of
an airship, in which a number of bis
friends took much concern. Now both
inventor and ship have disappeared, and
those who were watching the Greek's ex
periments are wondering what was the
final result.
Demetrak spent many Sundays in test
ing his device for flying. He would rise
early in the morning, pack his machine
in a wagon and drive far out into the
Contra Costa hills, where there are no
houses, and then spend hours in experi
menting: ' Just what the energetic Greek's
plan was is not known, but it is said that
light gases were employed as a means of
raising his vessel above the ground.
Demetrak claimed that he had already
partially succeeded in tests of his ma
chine, and he confidently expected to be
making trips through the atmosphere in
the very near future.
Another of his enterprises that attracted
wide attention was that of entering the
aged sprinter, Theodorianitis, in a foot
race against any one of bis age, orover 50,
from San Francisco to San Jose.
Demetrak's Berkeley store was sold by
him to Geor.e Fundas, who was his chief
clerk. Immediately after the transfer
came several attachments on tne stock for
debts alleged to be owed by Demetrak.
The new proprietor was allowed to keep
the place open for a few days and then it
was closed. Now Fundas is king for a
way of getting recourse. He claims to have
ground, for a suit against the Sheriff tor
injury to his business.
C. Demetrak is the president of the
Heliemi Benevolent Society of California.
His whereabouts at the present time is a
matter of much concern to many people of
the college town, where he is widely
known. He has not ben seen about the
classic shades of Berkeley since a week
ago last Friday evening.

The first number has been issued of the
Missionary, Extension Record, a monthly
publication .which will seek to record the
work carried 'on by the evangelical
churches of the coast or by members of
the churches. . 7.
The movement of missionary extension
was organized on ., this coast in 1894, the
first features being lectures. > It has grown
and broadened until it ! now includes a
training school in, San Francisco, a sum
mer school at Glenwood in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, a Prayer Circle, Reading
Circle, .Volunteer .Band; and Lecture
Bureau. Over a year ago it was thought

WIRT'S ACTION DISMISSED.
He Cannot Oust Two of the Police
Commissioners.
The State Supreme Court has sat down
upon .N, S. Wirt, an attorney, who made
an attempt to oust Police Commissioners
Alvord and Tobin from their positions.
Several weeks ago Wirt filled In the Su
preme Court, .in the name of The People
by N. S. Wirt, an application for a writ of
mandamus to compel Governor Budd to
appoint two Police Commissioners to fill
the places of Commissioners Alvord and
Tobin. The Supreme Court yesterday dis
missed the application and threw the case
out of court in this fashion:
This is an application or notice for a per
emptory writ of mandate to the Governor of
California to appoint two Police Commission
ers for the City and County of San Francisco.
The Attorney-General moves to dismiss the
proceeding upon the ground that the relator
has received no authority to sue in tho name
of the people of the State, and that be is not
himself a party beneficially interested in any
sense thai distinguishes him from other
citizens of the State, .The grounds of the
motion are conceded, and the motion must b.
granted.

THREE WINNING
FIRST CHOICES
Quite Surprising to Race
goers at Emeryville
Track.
In the Stake Event Arrezzo Was
Beaten Out a Head by
Sly.
Mt. McGregor II Made the Running
in the Handicap and Disposed of
; St. Lee Cleverly.
1
One of the most surprising features of
the present two weeks' racing spell at
Oakland track was the win yesterday of j
three of the six favorites served up to a!
confiding public. Early during the meet
form became entangled with some of the
neighboring barb-wire fences and a satis
factory adjustment of affairs seems well
nigh impossible. While no cases of par
alysis were reported, the victory of the
three first choices ye-terday afternoon was |
so startling and sudden that the book- I
makers, in most instances, welcomed their
advent past the wire in advance of their
fields, they were so lightly played. The j
attendance, both in the betting ring and
grand stand, was quite up to the average. j
The California stake for maiden three- i
year-olds at six furlongs, worth $700 to i
the winner, was the hi.hest priced feature
of the card and saw Sly, Arrezzo and j
Hannetta finish heads on the wire, in
the order named. Arrezzo, with "Willie
Martin up, was a3to 2 favorite and could i
the wire have been moved ten yards j
further, would have won.
In the mile and a sixteenth handicap,
St. Lee was asked to concede too much
weight to tbe Burns & Waterhouse entry,
ML McGregor 11, and the latter starling
favorite in the ring at odds of 2 to 1, made
all the running and won ridden out by
over two lengths in the fast time of 1:47^.
Wheel of Fortune was a good third.
Double Quick, a 10 to 1 shot, delighted
the backers of first and second choices by
taking the opening ssven-iuriong run very
easily from Ricardo, a 25 to 1 outsider.
Kowalsky, the 4 to 5 choice, finished back
in the ruck.
The conditions of the second event, a
five and a half furlong spin, allowed Cas
par to tumble in witn 104 pounds in the
saddle, and starting a 7 to 10 choice the
youngster did not experience much diffi
culty in beating out Quicksilver, the sec
ond choice, ridden by Johnny Weber.
The handicap hurdle affair over one and
a quarter miles resulted in a rather tame
victory for Three Forks. The crack
jumper receding in the betting from 8 to
5 to twos, shouldered his 165 pounds and
made a show of his field, covering the
distance in 2:l7}^. Tuxedo was third, two
lengths in front of Fi FL
And what a rare racing morsel was the
last race ofthe day â a scrimmage at seven
furlongs! McLi ht, with H. Shields in
the saddle, was plunged on at odds of
even money and 7to 10, but failed to get
within the money at the end. In a furi
ous drive Spencer astride Charles A got
through the bunch opposite the paddock

Johnny Weber, who rode Quicksilver,
broke a stirrup in the stretch, which
augured against bis chances.
Ricardo, who seems to be able to run
one good race semi-annually, came very
near landing the opening event at the
juicy odds of 25 to 1. The beauty of it if,
the stable generally seems to know when
the gelding is going to furnish one of these
good runs.
Kowalsky warmed up like a stake horse
and a ton of coin went into the books on
Wade McLemore's horse. Slaughter
seems to have lost his riding form com
pletely, and should walk around on the
grass in the infield for a time. The talent
is rapidly getting soured on him. . .
Ba-quil, slow to get in motion, was com
ing fast at the finish of the second race,
and over a longer distance should make
his company hustle.
Harold Lindsay had been showing some
fast trials at ln.lesioe and Tom Griffin
had bores ot landing the stake event with
the colt. He maue a good showing, but
this of course doe. no* pay for oats and
hay." â¢' â¢
Gene Leigh says Arrezzo is a hard luck
youngster and he let him run for the
stake alone yesterday. . Not detracting in
the least from the excellent performance
of Sly, it certainly looks as though Ar
rezzo ran the best race, ail things consid
ered, and if ten yards further that colt
would bave won.
Patsy Freeman had high hopes of win
ning with Hannetta and -was not far
wrong in his prognostication. At the
paddock she looked all over a winner, but
faltered the last fifty yards.
The stable evidently aid not lose much
money on Wheel of Fortune, as 5 to 1 was
always obtainable against her in the bet
ting."

DISOHAEGES TOE DEUNKS.
Captain Robinson' Will Not Recognize
Them When Presented by Attorneys.
John Craichi, a milkman, was arrested
on Pacific street yesterday afternoon by
Policeman J. N. McGee for being drunk.
He was taken to the California-street
station and later to the City Prison.
About 7 o'clock last night Attorney
Martin Quinlan called Cratcbi out of his
cell. They talked for a few minutes ana
then Quinlan left. Cratchi told Captain
Robinson that Quinlan had shown him an
order of discharge and wanted $5 to take
him out. Cratchi refused to give him the
money and then Quinlan came down to $3.
This was also refused and then Qninlan
put the order of discharge in bis pocket.
Captain Robinson at once gave instruc
tions that no more orders or discharge for
drunks should be recognized when pre
sented by attorneys.
THE SATS' FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 1897.
GENTLEMEN DRIVERS
WANT SHELTER
Assemblyman Dennery In
troduces a Bill in the
Legislature
Providing for the Erection of a
Rendezvous in Golden
Gate Park.
A Speed Track and N.;thin? But the
Ocean Brecz? to Cool Out the
Costly Animals-
The gentlemen reinsmen of this City
feel that in the past they have been neg
lected by the Park Commission, and yes
terday there was introduced a bill in the
Assembly at Sacramento by Assemblyman
Leon L. Dennery that is expected to pro
vide a rendezvous for the owners of high
priced horseflesh, where their foaming
steeda can be cooled out and they them
selves can swap stories of wondrou3 trials
down the speeutrack.
Some time in the past a monster peti
tion was laid before the Park Commission
ers, with the Golden Gate Driving Associ
ation as its sponsors. The membership
of the association is large, including on
its roll some of the wealthiest local horse
! men. In it was plainly stated the griev
ances of the possessors of the pacers and
I the trotters.
While a splendid track had been con
structed through the park to the ocean
beach for the cyclers and a cyclers' rest
erected for the comfort of wheelmen at
the beach itself, the horse folks were com
pelled to pull their chargers up at the end
of the speed track, with the chilling winds
from the ocean benumbing their animals,
and in some instances working their ruin,
simply for lack of a place of shelter. -
The fact was set forth in the petition
that the park speedtrack was constructed
at a cost of nearly $30,000 entirely, through
private subscription, many of the subscrib
ers of which were members of the Golden
Gate Association.
A palatial structure "Vas not asked for
and i while the Commin.ioners were in
sympathy with the horsemen were dila
tory in taking action. It was proposed at
one lime to move the old Casino building
to the lower end of the sj,eed course, bat
this scheme was dropped as not feasible.
The opinion was then expressed that it
was just possible that the laws governing
the public parks would not permit of a
building or' buildings to be erected for
lovers of the roadster, though eminent
legal authority consulted construed the
law as favorable to the cause.
In an interview last evening W. ,S.
Leake, secretary of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, stated that tbere was little
doubt but that the bill introduced by Mr.
Dennery and which would be presented to
the Senate to-day by Edward I. Wolfe
would become a law. Mr. Leake returned
from Sacramento last evening and said the
general tenor of opinion among the
assembled politicians at the State Capitol
was in favor of it.
The plaint ol the driving horse-owners
is considered a just one, and it Is hoped
they will receive the recognition they are
entitled to. Many splendid specimens of
horseflÂ»sh are quartered in the different
stables throu hout the city "eating their
heads off, " as their owners say-. And all
this simply for lark of a cozy refuge in the
park, where, safe from the winds, an idle
hour could be passed ia watching the
speed trials and "talking horse." Many
thousands of dollars are represented in
horseflesh in this City and a resort "of
some sort in the park would lend fresh
impetus to the sport. This would be felt
by breeders throughout the country, who
are now complaining. that the day of the
horse is past and are fast getting out of
the business. Golden Gate Pc*rk and the
ocean boulevard are unrivaled for driving
purposes and it is a discrace to the City
tbat in the past man's noblest animal bas
received such slight consideration.
YOUNG ATHLETES TO CONTEST.
Rival Classes of Polytechnic High
School Will Build a Cinder Track.
The boys of the Polytechnic High School
are going to have a athletic cinder track
of their own. Next Saturday afternoon
the junior and middle classes of the
school will give an athletic exhibition at
Central Park for the purpose of raising by
nominal gate charges some money needed
to perfect the track upon which the boys
themselves have long worked diligently
after school hours. -,
The track is on the grounds of the old
Girl's High School on Bush street, near
Larkin.
The two classes will oppose each other
in a baseball game and in a football game.

QUEER TACTICS
OF THE POLICE
A Peculiar Resort to Get
Evidence Against
Cooney.
Captain Lees Unearths an Early
' Morning Witness in th*e
Case.
Bracing Up Some Parts of the Weak
Frosecntion of the Young
Notary.
The proceedings in the case of perjury
the Fair children and Captain Lees are
desperately striving to make against l
Notary Cooney were marked by hut one â 
interesting incident yesterday. Lees and
his detective force had found a new but
unimportant witness in one James G.
Whiteside, who was hurried to the court
room to fill a link in the weak chain of
testimony. Whiteside was a former clerk
in the stationery-store of H. S. Crocker &
Co. He was found early in the morning
by Detective Reynolds and brought to
Captain Lees, who by means of a dummy
legal blank induced him to say that ne
remembered inserting in a notarial cer
tificate nearly two years ago the words,
"to me," although he admitted that it was
customary lor General John H. Dickinson
to make all corrections in the legal sta
tionery of the firm.
Just now Whiteside is out of work. Ac
cording to his story be lives at 3451 J_ Mis
sion street. It was the purpose of Lees to
establish in his theory that the certificates
ol Cooney on the pencil deeds were printed
in 1886, that the stationery firm had not
printed any of this form of blank since
1891 until 1895.
Clerk Stanford, who had charge of the
legal blank department, in his story of
the day before "remembered that the cer
tificates had been amended as required by
law in August, 1895, by the insertion of
these two words, but was unable to say
that he had written them on the copy for
the printers. The change might possibly
have occurred during his absence, so Stan
ford thought, and Whiteside conveniently,
after having been reminded by means of a
fac-simile of the copy in which Captain
Lees himself had written tho words in
question, filled in the gap.
It was on August 7, 1895. that White
side, in Stanford's absence, made the
amendment in the form of the certificate.
A notary had called at the store to buy
some blanks, and pointed out thai the
form was slightly defective.
"Who was that notary?" queried At
torney Reddy.
"1 don't remember," was the reply.
"You can't remembar; how is that?"
"It was some notary who dropped into
the store?"
Five thousand certificates were printed
from the revised form, said Whiteside,
and the strange notary was duly supplied.
"Well, couldn't you tell his name from
the books?"
"I simply made an entry in the cash
books of the sale."
"By the way." said Reddy, taking anew
tack, "who asked you to come here?"
"Captain Lees," was the reply, after a
pause. "I was .Ã¼bpenaert last night and
went to Captain Lees' office this morning.
He heid up a written blank certificate
-â ith the words 'to me' written on it, and
asked me if I remembered writing these j
words on a form in Crocker's store in 1895. !
I did when I saw the paper."
"Did he ask you about other blanks?"
"Ye?."
Reddy put Whiteside through an ex- j
tended questioning. Once he caught him
gazing peculiarly and appealingly at the j
chief of detectives and reprimanded him
sharply.
It was the custom of Attorney Dickinson
to draft the form'- and correct the copy of
all legal blanks, Whiteside admitted." In
the case of the certificate printed in Au
gust, 1595, Whiteside made the corrections,
after consulting Dickinson. This unusual
proceeding On the part of a minor clerk
attracted Reddy's curiosity.
"Wasn't it Dickinson's custom to add
any words to a form that needed correc
tion?"
"Yes."
"He didn't do it in this case?" was the
caustic query.
'No," replied Whiteside, with another
glance at Captain Lees.
"You ever been a witness before?"
"No."
"How long have you known Lees?"
"Never met him until this morning,"
and the young man was dismissed after
Reddy had got specimens of his hand
writing.
Whiteside's testimony was of little im
portance after all except to show the ex
traordinary efforts tbe police are now
taking in the case after nearly two years
of inactivity.
Simon H. Wade, the foreman of the
Crocker printing department, identified
copy lor various batches of legal blanks.
Notarial certificates containingjthe words
"tome," according to Wade, were not
printed previously to 1895 by Crocker.
Wade also recalled that Cooney had 500
certificates with bis name attached.
Wade's cross-examination promises to de
velop some interesting inconsistencies,
and will take plac" Monday.
Notary Charles W. Smith was called to
formally identify the depositions Cooney
made before him. Deputy County Clerk
Piper told how they had been filed in his
office, and Judge Charles W. Slack ap
pealed to give his consent to the breaking
of the seals. This closed the work of the
morning and an adjournment was taken
until Monday.

Lawrence Sutton, en old man, was found in

LOW RATES FOR
PURPLE AND GOLD
Thousands of Christian
Endeavorers Coming to
This City.
Mechanics' and Woodward's
Pavilions Engaged tor
the Convention.
Delegations From Foreign Countries-
Work of the Local Committee
of Arrangements.
The Transcontinental Passenger Asso
ciation in session at Chicago yesterday
agreed on a rate for the sixteenth annual
international Christian Endeavor conven
! tion, which will be held in San Francisco
from July 7 to 12 .next . The Christian
Endeavor Society num bars 2,836,740. The
I number that will come to this City to at
| tend the 1897 convention will number
j away up in tne thousands.
One-half excursion rates have been
granted from Missouri River points,
which are Omaha, Council Bluffs, Kansas
j City, Mineola and Houston. This is $45
! for the round trip from those points to
| San Francisco. The tickets at the reduced
round-trip rate will be on sale June 22, 23,
j29 and 30. and July 1, 2 and 3. The going
Rev. Mr. Clark Is President of the United Society of Christian
Endeavor and Mr. Littlefield Is Chairman of the Press
Committee, Christian Endeavor Convention of 1897.
j limit is July 9. by which date members of
! the society must arrive in San Francisco.
i The tickets have stop-over, privileges in
; each direction, and the date of expiration
| of the tickets is August 15.
The Transcontinental Association also
j decided to recommend to the Western
I Passenger Association, which fixes rates
! east of the Missouri River, a round-triD
| rate for members of the convention of $50
i from Chicago and $16 50 from St. Louis
j and Memphis.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
insisted upon this rate, which is consid
ered a very fair o*)p. General Passenger
Agent T. H. Goodman said . yesterday
afternoon:
"We have been after a rate like this
for several years. It has been said that
but for us we would have had this conven
tion before. The fact is that we have all
along insisted in the Tranrontineutal As
sociation for a low rate. We secured it
this time by intimating that we would
| make it ourselves, in alliance With some
other line at the Missouri River, if it was
not granted."
Assistant General Passenger Agent
Horsburgii said: â¢ "This favorable action
by the Transcontinental Association will
I insure a large attendance of delegates, and
I the coming to California of a large num
ber of young people of the better class
j wbose future has not yet been deter
i mined, many of whom, if properly im
j pressed, will finally settle in this State.
The ticKet 5 * will be placed on sale early
enough to give people a chance to spend
their summer vacation in California.
From June 22 to August 15 is about one
week short of two months. . '-'y
It is estimated that tbe convention will
draw about 20,000 young people to San
Francisco from the East, besides those
who will come for the pleasure of the trip
and to see the many attractions of Cali
fornia.
The Mechanics' Pavilion and Wood
ward's Pavilion have been engaged by the
local committee of arrangements as places
of meeting for the . convention, as it is
estimated that neither of the two build
ings alone will accommodate the crowd.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 1897.
1 The interior of the Mechanics' Pavilion
will be considerably changed for the con
vention, as it is impossible now to seat
more than 5000 people so that they can all
hear. Another building will be built in
p side Mechanics' Pavilion. About $22,500
has already been raised for the conven
i tion. It is desired to raise the sum to
; $25,000. There will be different pro
â  grammes in each building.
The local committee of arrangements is
well along with the work. Visiting dele
gations will be met at trainsand boats by
delegations of the local Christian En
deavor societies, wearing 'he colors of the
society,, purple and gold. The City will be
decorated with those colors, and the con
vention will also have the benefit of the
Fourth of July decorations, which will not
have been removed by the 7th.
Rev. Francis Clark, president of the
United Christian Endeavor Society, is now
in Europe. George B. Littlefield, chair
| man of the local press committee, says a
letter has recently been received from
President Clark saying there will be a
considerable attendance from abroad to
the San Francisco convention.
There will be two special gavels for the
convention. One is a hammer used by
William Cary, the noted shoemaker mis
sionary, when he followed his trade, and
! the other will be furnished by a Christian
j Endeavor Society of India.
A grand parade will be given on the
! first or second day of the convention.
Trans-Pacific steamship lines, it is un-
I derstood, will make a special rate for mis
: sionaries in China, Japan and other Ori
! ental countries desiring to attend the con
vention. ;'.-vt

Judge Dunne of the Superior Court had all
he could do to manage Dr. Arthur "Martin,
who yesterday presented a writ of habeas cor
pus for the purpose of securing possession of
his two children. 'Or. . Martin - began to be
boisterous nnd threatening, but he was finally
controlled by the firmness of the court. "I
must have those children," exclaimed Dr.
Martin. "If I cannot get relief from- the
courts I will take the law into my own hands
and use force to get them." In order to give
Dr. Martin time for reflection the case was
continued until Monday afternoon at 2
o'clock.
SHE IS- NOT MARRIED YET-
Lulu Gwinn Made an Effort Yesterday
to Wed Frederick Fox. .
Judge Coffey has refused to hear the
application for guardianship of Mrs.
Mary Chamberlain over the minor,
"Lulu," or Cecilia Gwinn" which, she
says, is her real name. r
The girl has been convicted of vagrancy
and immoral conduct of aggravated de
gree, and was committed ten days ago to
the Magdalen Asylum by Police Judge
Campbell. *
The girl is under age, and unless she
obtains a guardian cannot' marry one
Frederick For, a stoker on the Tillamook,
who seeks her hand. ' '
Judge Coffey stated he desired to not
mix civil and criminal cases if he could
help it. He would consider the case,
however, on Saturday, if, Judge Campbell
would continue his investigation in the
matter and ascertain whether. the secur
ing of a guardianship and a subsequent
marriage were for the purpose of reclaim
ing the girl or of avoiding justice. ,

TRIBULATIONS
OF AN HEIR
Young Mr. Hall Solicited
to Aid Authors and
Inventors.
An Oregon Lady Would Found

hearts.
The Graphic Vision of a Dramatic
Author With a P. ay of Twenty-
Eight Scenes
"1 wonder if he's an inventor."
'â¢Perhaps be has anew method for turn
ing soap into gold."
' "If be only had long hair he might be a
playwright." , 'â i*L' i ',
"Well, whatever scheme he has on deck
he appears harmless, anyway."
These and a chorus of like remarks
greeted a casual visitor as he stepped into
the mail order department of the Em
porium and asked for Ira Jarman Hall
yesterday. They were delivered by a
group of merry, laughing girls, who were
all attention and exchanging sly winks
immediately upon hearing the magic
name of Hall.
Mr. Hall is the young fellow whose
wealthy father in England has just dis
covered that he has a fourth son, and is
now on his way to California to lay claim
to him. The whole story was published
exclusively in The Call of a month ago.
Since that lime young Hall has learned
that the path of one receiving recognition
from a father worth. $-0,000,000 is not
strewn with roses. His very existence
has been made a misery by people with
schemes needing financial assistance in
order to attain perfection, and people
with philanthropic ideas miles ahe ad of
their age.
Hardly had the doors of the Emporium
been opened on the day after the publica
tion of the story when a funny-looking
little German appeared post-haste and in
quired for Hali. He found him, and
thereupon unfolded a tale wonderful to
bear. It loses none of its entertaining
features by repetition.
In broken English the visitor explained
that he lived on Third street and was a
test medium. He had just written a
thrilling play that would insure not only
a fortune to himself, but to any one who
would render him the pecuniary assist
ance necessary to put it on the market.
The sum required was just $2000, and Hall
was the very man to be given the lucky
chance.' -JJ^^pi-^^v'-^-^kiJ-
The author of the play was referred to
Sign-Artist . Cohen, with the explanation
that he was Hall's legal adviser and would
hear the story. With the play, a huge
roll of manuscript, under his arm, the au
thor climbed the stairs to Cohen's apart
ment, and in tho presence of a small army
of employes proceeded to explain the
literary value of his production.
"It is a wild, lurid melodrama," he
poured forth in excited tones, "and con
tains five acts and twenty-eight scenes,
and is entitled 'Labolfski, the Counter
feiter.' Ah, gentlemen, the scenes are
wonderful." - - .
An examination cf the article in ques
tion showed that it was a tale of Russian
counterfeiters, in which certain New York
rogues played leading parts. : The villains
talked of Russian and American money at
the same time and all of them in two dif
ferent languages.
One sublime scene represents a crock
running across the stage. Three counter
feiters got into a' fight in -a. small skiff
white crossing the rivulet and were
stopped by a kick in the side delivered by
Labollski.
: Another priceless dramatic gem repre
sented a woman in the act of dying and
while in the death agony 1 being cheered
by the song of a buffoon, "She'll Be an
Angel By and By." - . â¢- ;
These scenes "formed only; two of the
valuable features" of the play, and only
$2000 was needed to "boom" it. In aoout
fifteen or twenty years the writer would fall
heir to $50,000 and would reimburse Hall, if
it were not a success. .He nas about worn
out his shoes in - countless trips to consult
with "legal adviser", Cohen since that
time. -'â¢':'â¢;.", 'â .
On the occasion of one visit the man
witn a play went into a trance, franti
cally scratched his hair into picturesque
profusion and exclaimed :
. "What do I see? Ah,' l see in the misty
distance a room. ; It contains a vast safe.
"Your father stands at the safe. He
opens it. It is full of money.
"See! He takes from it a marriage cer
tificate and a record of the lamily births.
Now he discovers that one son is missing.
"Ha says that he will -go in search ot
â him, and take him to; bis bosom. It is
grand 1 It is beautiful !"
This was only the beginning of the
heir's tribulations. People wishing assist
ance have simply stormed the young man
in his citadel from that day to this. Nor
was he worried only by personal visits.
The daily mails have been full of solici
tations for aid. The first letter came from
a lady in Santa Rosa.
Sue wanted to know if a package con
taining a few thousand dollars were not
lying around with her name on it. If he
would send it to her she would repay him
in the future, providing he was unmar
ried.
Then came a letter from a Healdsburg
beauty. She believed with a pathos
touching to realize that she had met the
heir at some time or other, but if she were
mistaken was perfectly willing to make
up for it by getting acquainted as soon as
he could come to see her.
Then came a letter from Marshtield, Or.
The author was also a woman. She be
lieved so strongly that she must write it
that he should found an institution where
uumarried working girls could take their
sweethearts oh Sunday and enjoy a tete
a-tete, instead of having to take a car ride
or walk the streets.
It would become a place worthy of the
founder if.it only had a good matron to
preside over its destinies. Incidentally,
the lady thought she would make a ma
tron of no small ability herself.
A young lady in this City indited Hall a
letter, couched in provincial English, ex
plaining that she had a watch "in soak"
for $6, and would like him to redeem the
pawnticket. If he would, she was willing
to honor him with her acquaintance.
Another caller had a wonderful recipe,
for turning a cake of soap into virgin gold.
He needed just 15 cents to get some cop
per and he would return and perform the
trick for an audience. His modest de
mand created so much sympathy that he
was given a very small time in which to
make his exit.
Another man had a model for an air
| snip that completely solved the problem
,of aerial navigation. And vet another had
{ a proposition for coaxing hairs to come
i forth as a protection to bald heads. They
! came singly and in droves, and their
{ schemes are as various as those of the
. original Colonel Sellers or one of his
j proselytes.
That is why Hall cannot be found by
' visitors, and is as dumb as an oyster to all
; inquiries about his future prospects.
That is why the casual visitor afforded
i so much merriment to the young ladies
I when he inquired for Hall.
That is also why he was referred to
! "Legal Adviser" Cohen to unfold his talc
i of woe.
CHASED AND CAPTURED.
Emmet Brannan, an Ex-Convict, Booked
on a Charge of Assault With a
Deadly Weapon.
A pickpocket has for the past two or
three weeks been stealing purses from
ladies who were attending the auction
sales in the Chicago store on Market
street, near McAllister. About ten days
ago he was pursued by several of the
clerks, but managed to escape by running
into a barn on Stevenson street and
doubling on his pursuers.
A. B. Levy, the proprietor, suspected
Brannan, and when he saw him in the
store Tuesday he instructed his clerks to
watch him. Brannan returned yesterday
afternoon and was chased out of the store.
Levy ran after him and was followed by a
crowd.
Brannan ran along Stevenson street and
got entangled in a cul-de-sac. Levy was
close behind him and Brannan pulled out
a knife and threatened to kill him if he
did not leave him alone. Levy jumped
aside and Brannan dashed past him and
ran back on Stevenson street and down
Seventh. Policeman W. T. Hooper was
walking along Seventh street and seeing
Brannan hotly pursued by the crowd he
caught hold of him and held him till
Lsvy reached them.
Brannan was taKen to police headquar
ters and after Levy had told his story he
was ordered locked up on a char.c of
assault with a deadly weapon.
Brannan served a term of five years for
robbery, and Detective Bainbridge said he
was now out on â¢ bonds awaiting his trial
in . the . Stiper.'or i Court on a charge of
pocket- pick ing.
Police Tribunal.
The Police Commissioners met last night,
when Policemen James J. McEntee and George
1 racy were each fined $_0 . for failing to try
doors on their beat and not discovering that a
burglary had been committed.
Policeman George W. Meyer was fined $50
for dereliction of duty. It was reported to him
that the Sieba shoe factory, on Stevenson
street, was to be entered by burglars, and he
failed to notify tne captain of the fact.
