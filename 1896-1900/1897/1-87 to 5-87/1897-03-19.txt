Constantinople that the blockade of the

ATHENS. Greece, Sdarch 18.â In the
Boule to-day M. Skouzes, Minister of For
eign Affairs, announced that the foreign
admirals in Cretan waters had issued a
proclamation stating that a blockade o f
Crete would begin at 8 o'clock on the
KISSAMO KASTELLI, in Northwest Crete, Now Besieged and Surrounded by the Christian Insurgents.
morning of March 21â Sunday next.
After that time no Greek vessels would be
J owed to enter the ports of the island,
id the vessels of other nations desiring
in enter must first obtain permission from
the admirals.
The announcement was received calmly.
The Chnmberand the people generally are
resigned to this action on the part of the
i owers, believing that the attempted im
position of autonomy on the Cretans will
prove futile and that the island will ulti
mately fall to Greece.
A number of prominent Cretans, who
are now in Athei>Â«, state that their prop
erty has been destroyed by Moslems and
t!iat they will nevr return to tbe island.
They could never have the slight* st confi
dence in the novel regime that is proposed
by the powers, and Deiieve that an autono
mous Government imposed by force of
arms would never be sell-sustained and
that the end of it would l c worse than the
first. The Greelc troops in the island are
in a position, so far as supplies are con
cerned, to boUi out for an indefinite
period notwithstanding a blockade.
As soon as tne Greek Government
learned tLat it was the intention of ihe
power? to blockade the island large quan
; n.es oi provisions, munitions of war,
medicinosand all supplies necessary for
;,n army in the field were hurried forward.
During the past week great quantities of
h se supplies bave been successfully
transferred to the troops.

The news of the sinking of a Greek

Cretan waters caused the greatest excite
ment and indignation here, which was not

tempered by the information that the crew
of the vessel escaped.
The newspapers voice the opinion o'.
. the public when they denounce the action
of the warship as a crime against civiliza
tion by the nations who claim to lead the
i world in humanity. The bitterest denun
! ciation is heard on every band of all who
j had to do with 'he sinking of the vessel.
LONDON, Eng., March 18â The St.
! James Gazette asserts that the blockade
j of the coasis of Crete by the warships o!
| the powers will begin next Sunday morn
ing, and that the foreign almy-als have
I requested Greece to withdraw her war

otherwise force would be employed to
compel her to do so.
TOULON, France, March 18.â The

VIENNA, Avstria, .' March . 18.â The
Government has. received vices that the
Austrian gunboat Sebenico has sunk a
Greek schooner with a C3rj:o of munitions
of war and a number of Cretan insurgents
on board. The Sebenico, under the orders
of the British admiral commanding the
British squadron in Cretan water-, was
patroling off Cape Dia, Crete, when tbe
schooner hoTÂ« in sight.
The schooner was hailed by the gunboat
j auJ the insurgents on board in reply
opened tire upon tbe Sebenico, whereupon
the latter turned her guns on the schooner
and sank her. The crew of the schooner
swam ashore. None of tbe crew was in
jured.
LONDON, Eng., March 18.- A dispatch
from Rome, which the Daily News will
publish to-morrow, states that Greece will
protest against tbe firing upon and sink
ing of the schooner.
Phe will claim that the action of the
Austrian warship wa3 arbitrary, the place
where she sank the schooner not being di
rectly under tbe protection of the powers,
and will also protest that the warship was
not warranted in firing upon the vessel,
as there was no blockade established at
the time.
Tbe dispatch adds that the incident Is
regarded in Rome as being significant, in
asmucn as it is consider d proof that the
concert of the powers is perfect.
This bad the effect of causing a rise in
prices at tlie bourse. It is reported that
the insurgents refuse to accept autonomy
nnd demand that Crete be annexed by
Greece.
OANEA, Crete. March 18.â It is learned
here that the schooner sur.k by the Aus
trian warship Sebenico was landing stores
when she was approached by the warship.
The latter sent boats to intercept the
schooner's boats and forbid them to ap
proach nearer to the shore. There were a
large number of insurgents about the
place where the schooner intended to land
her cargo, and when they: saw the boats
from the warship they divined what their
intention was and poured a lively fusil
lade in their direction with rifles and can
non.
The boats, however, were out of range

of the euns on shore and no one was hurt.
Accounts differ as to whether the schooner
tired or not, but a majority of them con
cur in stating that she did.
At any rate the SÂ» betiico quickly trained
her guns on the insurgents ashore and
very quickly silenced their fire. At the
same time other of her guns were fired at
the schooner, which sank shortly there
after.
The Austrians are tilled with the great
est resentment at what they term the in
solence ol the Greeks in daring to fire
upon the Austrian flag.
Four more of the crew of the Russian
turret-ship Sisoi Veliky, who were injured
by the explosion of one of the great guns
of the .ship near Suda Bay on Monday,
have succumbed to their Injuries. This
makes the total number of deaths thus far
caused by the explosion twenty-five.
The British warship Barileur has sailed
hence for Kissamo, some twenty - five
miles to the westward. It is supposed
that she has been ordered there for the
purpose of embarking the Turkish garri
son, numbering 300 men, who have been
besieged by the insurgents for several
days. It is stated that the Turkish posi
tion at Ki-fsamo is surrounded by ' 2000
rebels.
XOKMAK AT IHE TROUT.
Saw llif Greek* Arm trilling to Die for
Their Country.
LONDON, Eng., March 18.â The Chron
icle will to-morrow state that is special
commissioner, Henry Norman, has re
turned to Athens from Thessaly. He re
cords that the Greek officers in command
of the troops on the lrontier are calmly
determined,
They bave no optimistic illusions re
paidine the Turkish forces which may ot
any moment be pitted against them.
They fully realize that if it comes to war
the forces of Crete may suffvr defeat.
They do not display the slightest sign of |
bravado, but are prepared to sacrifice
their lives at the behest of their country.
Hitherto, Norman says , the feeling of
the Greeks toward the powers has been
that of surpri.se and pain that they should
attempt to defeat the aspirations of
Greece, but is now one of bitter resent
ment and anger. He advises the German
cruiser Kaiserin Augusta to avoid the
vicinity 01 the Greek fleet in the ev^nt of
hostilities occurring, which, he says, a
blockade of tbe Greek ports will certainly
precipitate.
A Turkish torpedo-boat and a torpedo
bnnt deÂ«troyer, which are believ d to be
officered by Germans, are off one of the
northern islands of Greece. A Greek fleet
is watching them, and if events warrant
their capture the German officers will re
ceive short shrift.
Mr. Norman asserts that the Greek and
Turkish armies on the frontier are nearly
equal in numbers.
The Greeks bave a slight advantage in
infantry, but the Turks have a material
advantage in artillery, though they are
iacking in horses. Some of their guns are
drawn by oxen.
The Athens correspondent of the Tele
graph says that t tie blockade of Crete
began yesterday. All the torpedo boats
attached to the fleet are watched. The
Greeks are clever blocfcade runners, and
it is possible that they will continue to
land provisions, etc., especially in rough
weather.
Telegraph offices at Retimo and Candia
refuse to accept cipher messages from the
Greek Consuls for transmission.
CANEA, Crete, March 18. â Sharp
lighting occurred yesterday and to-day
between the Turks and insurgents outside
of Retimo. Yesterday five men were
killed and eleven wounded and to-day
five men were killed.

LONDON, Esq., March 18.â Under â¢ the
title "The Eastern Crisis" a sixteen-page
pamphlet by Mr. Gladstone will be issued
to-morrow. The pamp ; let is -in the form ;
of a letter from Mr. Gladstone, addressed '
to the Duke of Westminster, in wuich the
ex-Premier proceeds to say: ; *; ri :
, "Events in crowds have been occurring
in the east at short intervals for the past
two years of such a nature as to stir our
common humanity to its innermost re
cesses and to lodge an appeal from official
to â  personal confidence. Until the most
recent days these transaction's have seemed
to awaken no echo sate yi^ England, but
now light has flatbed Vj-ou /i^ettern
E rope;- â â '; aVi d%an j Â«Â«%y t con;-. v ices, t?*9 5 1 ha t
nations as â  well as cabinets are concerned
has taken a strong hold upon the public
mind. Later massacres in Armenia have
occurred upon a scale of intensity and' in
adveisity of their wickedness beyond all
modern if not all historical experience.
All this has been done under tho eyes of
the six great powers, who are represented
at tlie Porte by EmbasÂ«adors, and through
their feeble verbiage a sufficient counter
poise to instruments of death, shame and
torture, provided that in framing it they
all chimed in wUhone another."
The letter then eoes on to review the
Eastern question since 1876. Mr. Glad
done rccails tne fact that bis Ministry in
1880 organ 17-pd a European concert to pro
cure the fulfillment of the treaty of 1878 in
regard to Montenegro and Greece. The
forces of mural support had been ex
hausted and a rquadron of warships of
the six powers had been assembled on the
Montenegrin or Alsatian coast. It was
sodn found that several rowers in "a con
cert of Europe" meant toy demonstra
tions which were not intended to pass for
reality.
"ftVe did not waste any time to galvan
ize the corpse into life," Mr. Gladstone
continued, "but framed a plan lor the
seizure of an important port of the Sul
tan's dominions. We found as our prin
cipal support the wise and brave Alexan
der II who then reigned in Russia. The
effect was perfect. There was no war in
Europe, though this bugbear would '
doubtless have been used had our pro
ceedings passed beyond privacy. Our
plan became known to tne Sultan, and
without a single difficulty Montenegro
obtained considerable extension and Thes
saly was added to Greece later. It was
time to speak with freedom. At this mo
ment two great states with a European
population of 150,000,000 are under the
government of two young men, each bear
ing the title of Emperor, but who in one
case is wholly without knowledge and ex
per.ence, in truth limited enough as to
have excited much astonishment and
some consternation when an inkling of
them has been g yen to the world. In tne
concert of the powers these powers fight
steadily against freedom, but why is our
Government pinned to their aprons?"
Mr. Gladstone then reviews the history
oi Greece and Crete and says: "We have
before us a David facing six Golinths."
He argues that Ottoman rule in Crete is a
thing of yesterday, but Crete was a part
of Greece and Cretan people were part
Greek people 3000 years ago. "Nor have
their moral and human ties ever broken
or relaxed," he said, "and years and cen
turies will come when this bad dream of
Ottoman dominion has passed from
Europe that the union will still subsist.
"Greece by her bold action," Mr. Glad
stone continues, "has conferred a great
service upon PJurope. She has made it
impossible to palt?r over this question as
we paltered in Armenia. The unions of
the nations are in various stages of their
training, but I do not believe it is the
European people whose judgment will
tolerate the punishment of Greece for
good deeds she recently performed. Cer
tainly it would not be the French, who so
largely contribute to the kingdom, nor
will it be Italians, who are so mindful of
what their fathers have undergone, and
least of all the English, who, if the road
were open to them by the dissolution of
Parliament, would show how they are
minded by turning up a Parliament
wuich upon this question would speak
with unanimity."
AHIiIEH BI COMXOMSRS.
British Stntentnen SÂ«ek Information
K'intitKi to the Blockade.
LONDON, Exg., March 18.â In the
House of Commons to-day Sir Charles
Dilke, Liberal, asKed whether a blockade
of the ports of Crete had been declared by
the powers, and whether Germany had
declined to employ her forces in the in
terior of the island.
John Morley, Liberal, asked whether
Greece had been invited to accede to the
terms of the identical note of the powers
before the blockade of the ports of Crete
was instituted.
A. J. Balfour, First Lori of the Treas
ury, reported that the British Minister at
Athens, E. H. Egretan, had been notified
to notify the Government of Greece that a
blockade of Cretan ports would be insti
tuted.
In reply to Sir Charles Dilke's other
question, Balfour said he had no informa
tion that Germnay had declined to send
troops to Crete. Germany thoroughly
agreed with the policy of the powers.
Mr. Morley asked if this technical noti
fication was what M. Meline, the French
Premier, referred to in his recent speech
in the French Chamber of Deputies.
Mr. Balfour said: "I don't know. I
must say it is not satisfactory to answer
questions put by gentlemen who embar
rass the Government as much as they can
by questions inside and speeches out
side of the Honse." [Loud cheering by
Conservatives.]
Sir William Harcourt, amid Liberal
cheers, protested against Mr. Balfour's

again asked M. Meiine, and he stated that
Greece would be invited to accede to the
terms of the note ol the powers, and that
the ports of Crete would not be blockaded
nor the number of European troops in the
island increased until Greece had been

done." [L beral cheers and great excite

Successful Launching of

GREAT CROWDS CHEER
THE EVENT.
The Vessels on Urikincj the
Water Come Together With
Slight Damage.
TWO LADIES CHEISTEN THE
WARRIORS.
The Union Iron Works Entertain the
Christening Party Daring
the Day.
Two more fighting ships dropped from
the land into the sea yesterday morning,
there to become members of the white
squadron ana to stand for the honor of
America and Americans.
The launching of the gunboats Wheel
ing and Marietta took place from the slips
of the Union Iron Works on the minuta
for which it had been arranged. Every
detail of the plans carried perfectly, ex
cept that when the big boats struck the
water they came together for no reason
that the managers could explain or un
derstand except that they were disposed
to be neighborly. The result was almost
disastrous, but, fortunately, passed with,
only an ugly scratching of the new paint
and the breaking of the davits on tne
Marietta. The Wheeling â her stem
caught on the stern of her sister ship
rolled over on her side, causing a slight
panic among the party on board and cries
of alarm from tho:-e on shore. However,
as the boats parted the Wheeling righted
in fine style, but carrying a scar to marlc
the meeting-place.
A great crowd gathered to witness the
inspiring spectacle. It. fo:med a heavy
fringe about the slips in the yards of the
Union Iron Works, covered trie ships
that were docked there, as well as every
point and pinnacle about the place. It
formed the favored group that held tick
ets ot admission from the Union Iron
Work 3. Along the shore beyond the high
fence of the shipyard s'. retched the line of
the uninvited, a much greater crowd, who
had really a boner if a little more distant
view. For tliey were in position from the
Potrero road to watch tne sliips at broad
side leap from their place on the stays
down the smooth patn prepared for them
into the sea.
Then there were those who came by
water. The bay was fairly crowded with
craft of every design, from the big side
wheeler down through all the variations
of tugs, yachts and -mall sailing vessels to
the single scull. The larger craft were
crowded with men and women, and all of
them had their flags flying, and some were
otherwise decorated. The water in front
of the ships where the two boats stood up
on tbe ways ready for the plunge was pa
trolled by a tag and kept clear of tha
eager crowd of sight-seeing craft
Presently the tug Sea King made its
way through the crowd and ran directly
up to the slip. It was evidently a pri
leged cnaracter. As it tied up a pany of
ladies and gentlemen climbed ashore. It
was the christening party, led by Miss
Lucle S. Brown of Wheeling and Mrs. H.
Clifford More of Naples, this State, former
ly of Marietta, and who was to represent
her native city for the occasion. They
made their way directly to the stand raised
for the ceremony at tl:e nose of the respect

bottles of champagne and give the boats
their name.
All was in readiness. Irving M. Scott
and Henry T. Scott were on hand, quiet
and well-satisfied spectators of this climax
of their work. Other officials of the worts
stepped about, giving orders for the final
details.
General Forsyth was present, represent
ing tlie army, and Lieutenants Milton and
Lopez, navnl representatives from the
works, and Naval Constructors Capp and
Snow, Lieutenant Braunersreuther, for
merly of Wheeling and now stationed
here, also Captains Rogers and Giilette.
With Miss Lucie Brown were her sis
ters â Abby and Manau from Wheeling â
and F. W. Baaman and wife, Leroy J.
McNeely, Washington correspondent of
the W T heeling N ws, who was largely in
strumental in having the name of his city
chosen for the new boat, was also of the
party.
At exactly six minutes to 11 o'clock the
word was given to let her go. There was
a crash of timber as the stay* were hauled
away. Two bottles of wine tied up in blue
ribbons were released and the corked tops
struck the nose of each vessel, anil as the
released wine sprang over the planks Miss
Brown cried : "I christen you Wheeling."
"I christen you Marietta," cried Mrs.
More.
AÂ» though the dead timbers felt the
thrill of lite ard liberty, a shiver ran
through them, a low cry rarae up lrom
underneath, they moved, hesitated, and
then rushed down the steep into the sea.
The great crowd that had. been holding
its breath in suspense broke into a cheer
that seemed like the roar of the ocean.
The tugs and all the steam vessels sent up
a shriek of their whistles, while those on
board and on shore who were provided
with flags waved them enthusiastically.
Meanwhile the two boats that, sera
rated by but a few feet hadcrown together,
iron rib by iron rib, plank by plank, from
a thousand separate pieces into two
shapely creatures of the sea, release!
after eighteen months and sent into their
native element, turned toward each other
as if to kiss â war vessels that they are.
The rudders had been fastened so that
â¢when they struck the water they should
move away from each other, but the Wind
or current or some other influence coun
teracted the plan and the Wheeling was
tipped over a little, the davits of the Mari
etta were broken and both vessels were
scratched baaty. However, no serious
damage was done.
The boats were yulled back to the slips
and the great crowd gradually dispersed.
Tboss of ttiem who bad the entree of the
works wandered about at will during a
great part of the afternoon.
Officers of the Union Iron Works enter
tained the christening party with a din
ner at the works.

Hughes was shot and killed while tryinp
to enter toe residence of Frank Dunn in
this city. The men who shot him were
detectives who were guarding the house.
Some time ago the police were notified
that an attempt would- be made at an early
date to" kidnap . Dunn's little daughter.
Dunn is wealthy, ana it was the intension
of the kidnapers 10 hold the child until a

when the attempt to steal the child was
to be made, but men were at once sent 10

.Last night Detectives Ellison and Proc

morning they saw a man approach the
fence, and after looking cauuously around
try to enter the house. The detectives
tried to capture him and ordered him to
fturrender, but instead ofdoing so he drew

! sending an extended special message to
; the Legislature, in which he recommends
! the appointment of a joint executive com-
I mittee to recanvass lhe November rote
and not declare the result. The action of
the Governor, which will be speedily rat
! itiea by both houses, indicates that the
i restraining order of Judge Hall is to be
' ignored so far as the Legislature itself is

G vernor Holcomb proceeds on the as
j sumption that neither the legislators nor
I himself are in contempt oi court, and
1 while his message is rather partisan, he
j advances strong reasons why his reeom
i mendations should be carried out.
The seizure of the ballot-boxes last
j night makes it possible for the Legislature
' to begin the count as soon as the proper
committees are appointed.
The presence of a Deputy Sheriff in the
Capitol this afiernoon trying to gain ad
mission to the Governor's office, which
was locked, gave rise to tbe rumor that he
had a warrant for the arrest of tbe chiei
executive, but he subsequently denied
that such was his mission.
Judge Hall bus not yet taken any action

NEW YORK, N. V., March 18.â It is
now believed that seventy-eight persons
in all were lost by the foundering of the
French line s earner Ville de St. Nazaire
off Hatteras, although a summary of the
list of the passengers and crew who were
on the vessel when she left here show that
there were but eleven passengers in all,
and that the crew list numbered seventy
one men. Of these, four are known to be
saved.
The officers, crew and passengers were,
with one or two exceptions, residents of
foreign ports. Of the total number on
board, sixty were colored. The only vm ite
persons on board besides the engineers
were the officers.

Aujiiitine Ferget, the French line agent
at this port, made the following: statement
of the disaster as he had learned it from
Captain Berry's disconnected remarks:
"The St. Nazaire encountered a tempest
wlien forty-eight hours out from New
York for Port au Prince. Tbe steamship
had made about 120 miles from this port
and was off Cape Hatteras.
"Heavy seas swept the ship continually
from Sunday afternoon until midnight.
Water poured down the hatches and put
out the tires in the er.gine-room, leaving
us helpless. Captain Jacqueneau ordered
out the boats, seeing no other hope. Four
boats were launched, only to be crushed
against the ship. In a momentary lull
the other four boats were launched in the
lee of the wreck and all on board crowded
into them.
"The boat in which Captain Berry
jumped contained thirty-seven persons all
told, including a woman and four chil
dren. Berry took command nnd ordered
signal lights carried for the other boa's
toiollow. The four boats parted company,
however, almost at once, and Berry never
saw a trace of tbe other three after leav
ing thÂ« ship. Everybody worked hard to
I keep the boat's head to the waves and all
suffered most intensely through the first
night. Some froze to death and others
jumped overboard. Of tbe last four day*;
of the terrible experience Captain Berry
has only a bazy recollection."
Mate Collins of tbe schooner Hilda was
interviewed on board that yes-ie! to-day.
In telling of the rescue of the survivors of
the wreck of the steamer St. Nazaire, heÂ»
said that never in his long experience on
the sea had he seen such an awful sight as
was presented by tbe small boat and its
occupants when the Hilda came along
side. The four men yet alive' were trying
to stand erect, but their legs refused to
support them and time and again they
sank to the bottom of tbe boat, where four
of their companions were lying cold in
death. Noi.one of them hnd the strength
necessary to catch the line thrown to
them and nnt one could utter a word
plainly enough to be understood.
The small boat containing the survivors,
he continued, was lighted at 2 p. m. Sun
day. The schooner, which was then
about ten miles off shore in the neighbor
hood of tbe Fenwicn Islands, was brought
around and directed toward tbe boat. A
very high sea was running at tbe time and
it took almost an hour to reach her.
After some maneuvering the Hilda was
brought so close to the small boat that
her crew could see its interior. Half
standing, half kneeling, in her were four
men, hollow-cheeked and wild-eyed. Their
lips, swollen and parched, moved slowly,
but not a sound came forth other than a
iisp like that coming from the lips of a
dying man. Their tongues, covered with
sores and clotted blood, protruded from
oetween their teetb, too muc.i swollen to
be longer retained in their mouths.
The eyes protruded as if the men were
being choked. In the stern of the boat
sat a roan half dressed and apparently
laughing. His mouth and eyes were wide
open, and as the boat rose and fell he
seemed to nod nls head to the men of the
Hilda, who leaned over her side, halt
afraid to go into the tossing craft. Gn
the bottom of the boat lay three other
men. They rolled about a* the waves
passed, but none of them rose. They were
dead. So was the man who sat in the
stern with that ghastly smile on his face
dead of exposure and starvation. The
four live men were insane, and weak as
men could get who had gone for a week
with almost nothing to eat and no water.
They were alive and that was all.
The men on the Hilda tnrew aline to
them, and while it fell over their shoulders
none of them bad the strength to hold it
or to tie it around their bodies. Bo far as
they depended upon their own efforts
safety might have been a thousand miles
away.
Repeatedly a line was thrown to them
and repeatedly it trailed across their faces
while they knelt there in the boat, mov
ing their lips as if they were laughing,
yet unable to move their arms or close
their stiffened fingers.
Finding that the men in the boat were
helpless two of the Hilda's crew climbed
down her sides, and when a wave lifted
the boat within reach stepped aboard.
One of the four men, attracting tbeir at
tention by groans, managed to carry his
hand to his mouth and pointed down his
throat. Quickly the four men were passed
up to the Hilda's deck.
Then the rescuers turned their atten
tion to the men in the stern and the three
lying on the bottom. They were all dead.
The bodies were removed in a few min
utes, but none toa quickly. The small
boat, hurled against the Hilda's sides by
the waves, was splintered so it began to
leak, and as the two men from the Hilda
left it tilled and sank.
The dead were sewed in canvas bags and
buried in the sea.
Then the Hilda's crew turned their
attention to the four survivors. Exposure
to the salt water had blistered their skin
in great blotches and their hands were
raw from pulling at the oars. A little
coffee was given to them and all four were
put to bed. They quickly went to sleep
and by the next morning were greatly
improved.
PENSION FOR A CIVILIAN.
Congress io Be Asked to Qrant an An
nuity to a Faithful Servant of
the Government
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 18.â At
the request of several naval officers, the
most active of whom is Admiral Jouett,
Senator McMilhn will introduce a bill
granting a pension of $20 a month to Wil
liam P. Moraii, who was for sixty-nine
consecutive years in -the naval service.
Last summer the old man, now 87 years
of age, was forced to resign, not being able
longer to properly perform the duties of
his office. For more than forty years
Moran signed the commission of every ca
det appointed to Annapolis and of every
officer of the nnvv. At the time of his en
forced retirement, therefore, there was no
officer in active service whose commission
did not bear the signature of William P.
Moran.
But there being no retired list for super
annuated civilians, no provision could be
made for him, and Congress is asked to
bestow a slight recognition of bis long
and faithful service. Admiral Jouett and
others renumber the day when Moran
was one of the thirteen clerks in the Nhvv
Department, and that at a time when
there were more vessels on the roster than
there are to-day.
He was in the Government service
nearer three-quarters than half a century,
having entered the navy in 1827, and
made several voyages as captain's clerk.
Afterward be was stationed at the Nor
folk Navy yard- Alter making several
crui-es on the Vamia.ia, attached io tae
Brazilian station, ami on the St. Louis, at
tached to the West Indian fleet, he came
home ifittheofd Pennsylvania in October,
1841, nnrttwa* appointed to a clerkship in ,
the Navjy Dei arinitMit. In spite of his
long term of office, Mr. Morau is still hale
and strong.
HOT SHOT FIRED AT ARMOR.
Carnegie-Harveyized Steel Plates Are
Put to a Crucial Test at
Indian Head.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 18.â A
Carnegie-Harveyized plate, representing a
600-ton lot of side armor of the Kearsarge,
Hept out two projectiles from a ten-inch
rifle at Indian Head to-day in a remark
able manner.
The plate was of the tapering pattern,
its thickness being U\% inches at the top
and running off to to% at the bottom.
The first shot strucK it with a veiocitv
of 1380 feet i>er second, and after getting
its nose only two inohes into the metal
bounded out, leaving the plate uninjured
The second projectile was started with
the maximum velocity ot 1850 feet per sec
ond and whs intended to penetrate the
late or sma,sh it in the effort. It imbed*
ded itself to the depth of seven inches,
and the plate remaining intact passed the
ordeal ilia nihcently. The lot will be
promptly accepted.

ST. LOUIb, Mo., March 18.â Alarming
reports of an increase of the volume of
water in the lower rivers are received here.
Rain bas fallen over a large section of
the lower Mississippi basin for twenty-four
hoars, and at many points where levees
hold back the flood by only a few inched
margin there will surely be disastrous
breaks.
In Southwestern Missouri and Northern
Arkansas the country is overflowed and
many lives a,re reported lost. Memphis
reports a number of deaths by drowning
in the overflow in Arkansas.
The relief committee there reported
that 1800 people, many of them negroes,
had been taken from the Arkansas flats.
Six islands north of Memphis are only to
be located by the trees showing above the
water.
There have been prompt responses to
the appeals for aid sent out by the Mem
phis relief committee. It is feared that
the Hood of 1883 will be repeated.
This morning a break was reported at
Old Town, twelve miles below Modoc.
While this would entail disaster there it
would mean the salvation of the country
for 200 miles north. A break is also re
ported at Bagnell's Landing, Miss., four
teen miles below Friar's Point. This
will surely submerge the cotton lands of
Cuahoma County.
The flood has .already done great dam
age. Steamboat men here say that the
crisis poinc is reached, and that unless
there is subsidence within twenty-four
hours the gravest consequences will fol

In spite of the break in the river gorge
the situntion late to-night is growing

808 JR. THE PRIDE OF THE
GREAT FIGHTER.
F; z immrns Coming H?re, and Will
L iter Go to New York and Re
k tire From the Ring.
CARSON, Nev., March 18 âAs soon as
the Corn^shman left his dressing-room in
the arena after yesterday's battle he es
corted his wife to their small, dusty, one
horse buggy and drove her home. Of
course, he was pleased at the applause of
the crowd and the cheers tnat followed
him, but he only waved his cap and
smiled a little. He did not appear any
happier than the ordinary man who finds
ass hill in the street. He drove away
talking with his wife, who was all smiles
and enthusiasm. There is a woman with
the true Spartan spirit. Seeing her in
the carriage with Bob, one could not help
thinking of the day when she will send
her son, Bob Fitzsimmons Jr., into the
nnz w ith strict orders not to leave it until
ho had'done his man. That she was her
husband's best second at the ringside is
already a matter of history.
The low rambling white house the Fitz
sirumons family occupies at Cook's ranch
is a modes' structure. From without it is
an prdinary Nevada cattleman's home,
with a bit of gross and garden at the door
nnd hectped by rows of cottonwood trees.
Within the hou-e is the typical home of
the village blacksmith who is making a
fair living from his trade and who has
neither the inclination nor the money Jor
luxurie?. The rooms are furnished with
the severest simplicity. They all open
into one anoih?r without any intervening
hallways. Fuzsimnions' training has, of
course, given the house a topsy-turvy ap
pearance.
Tiie new champion very cnrefally tied
his horse in honest farmer fashion, helppd
his iri/eout <>f the bugyy and waJked into
I the hon-e with her. A farmer whose red
ox has won the prize for fatne^s at a back
county fair would show more signs of joy
m an this long, lanky, silent man. The
nursegirl camo bustling into the dinine
rooiu wi.th Master Bob Fitz-immons in
her arms. The youngster looks about
eighteen months old.
â¢â¢Hey, you old stiff," cried Fitz, bis blue
eyes dancintr merrily Â«s he poked a long
freckled finger against the little chap's
body, ticking him in relatively the same
spot where his crunching fist had laid
Oor'oett low less than an hour before. He
kissed his little son and patted him on
the head.
''Uey, is dinner ready?"' he asked his
C!iin'e.*Â» cook. "I'm hungry now."
Down they sat to a modest meal, this pair
of Spartans, laugi.ingand chatting as tuey
talked of the battle. During the after
noon the long-legged man played around
the ranch like a schoolboy on vacation,
romped with the baby and taiked to his
wife about the pretty little house they
wonld buy iti New York as soon as they
should Jay by a little money â for a pretty
little hoUÃ'i in New York is their aim now
that Bob has announced his retirement
from the ring. Supper was at 6 o'clock.
Shortly after it was finished this farmer
like champion drove to town. He showed
himself in tne streets and was caped at
and pointed out by the crowd. His right
hand was bandaged and his puffed and
swollen lower lip was incased in court
plasier. Otherwise he looked about as
usual, certainly not in the least distressed.
Fit-z soon tired of the noisy town, for
the'streets were filied with drunken men
and he was anxious to get back to his
wife. He could not tind Yarrum, his iri
g'antic black dog, and drove home with
out him.
Imagine how this newly made cham
pion spent the evening of his victory. He
Â« down in his bedroom, which is the
* lor oi the house at Cook's ranch, and
played checkers with Dan Hickpy, one of
his trainers. There was no champagne
or'd'nnking of any kind. The north wind
howled through the Jrin:e of the cotton-
â¢wood trees, the wooden house shook
hu?Uy. A fierce gust assailed it and snow
was .flying in an atmosphere which at
noon was hot enough for the gladiators to
fight in nude, save for breochclouts.
Within doors no one heeded the storm.
The little nursegirl was singing young
Fitz to sleep, Mrs. Fitzumroons was here
and there about the room, singing and
stopping occasionally to pat the pink,
sunburned ba!dhead of her husband, and
the pusrilist himself waÂ» bent over the
checkerboard hzbting Hickey -with care
ful moves and as much fervor as he had
shown in fi^iitine Corbett.
When the lanky man had won his game
he marched up to the small black organ,
which ornaments the parlor, and began
to sing. Mrs. Fuzsimmons played accom
paniment. The tall pugilist's voice is not
the most melodious thing in the world,
but the enthusiasm of his singing is some
thing to wonder at. Fitzvimmons sang
thnt popular and pathetic ballad, "Just
Tell 'Em That You Saw Me." He im
proved it somewhat by changing the sec
ond line to "And that I knocked him out."
J?ut he Boon tired of this and began to
<tt"g Â» hymn. Everybody in the house
yit the sleeping baby and the Chinese
cnok j ined in this. Trainer Jack Stelz
ner's singing was especially robust.
The champion's little blue eyes were
twinkling like the points of an arc. He
was gamboling about the room as ploy
f&'ly as a young calf, and with his ap
tTocchine knees somewhat suggesting
t cheerful animal's legs. Suddenly he
P e S*n to sing a song that had been com
posed in honor of the occasion by his
wresiler, Emil Roeber. It ran:
Onr Champion Bob's a corker,
He's not a man's that's slow.
He wns born in Cornwall
I'd have you all to know.
Your Corbetts and your SulHvans,
Your Choynskis and your Mahers,
They nre all back numbers
Beside our Chtimpion Bob.
There are two feet too mnny in the last
lino of this ditty, but they are there to
stay. There is only one verse in the sonc,
but it is enough to tell the story. Any
one who thinks the punching Fitzsiru
mons received did him any serious injury
should have heard him chant that song.
Ttie queer featuro about his singing was
that tie seemed to be singing about some
other person than himself. Silf conscious
ness was as far absent as anything that re-
I sembkd boasting.
Early to bed and early to rise '.a the
rule in the Fitzsinimons household. The
family ate breakfast gay;y and lounged
about for an hour. The blacksmith cham
pion took young Bob in his arms, kis-sed
him and tossed him in the air. "Hoy,
you big stiff, 1 ' he cried, "do you think. you
could jjnock me cvi? ' He made a sud
den left-hand jab at the youngster and
stopped his hat â tnat ponderous and
ireckled triphammer â just as it grazed the
baby's pink cheeK. There is a wonderful
resemblance between the boy and his
iather. The features and coloring are
identical. Young Bob has his father's
glittering blue eyes and his auburn curls.
The youngster has a funny way of
doubling his tiny fists and drawing him
seif up as if on yuard when anything of
fends him. He is a healthy, hearty boy,
and one can already picture him ia the
ring as his father's successor.
"1 think that one of those hot batbs at
the penitentiary would De great," Fitz
s.mmons remarked. "So do I," cried his
wife. Within a lew minutes tho horse
was hitched to the bugj;y and away they
drove along the sandy, muddy roed
winding in and out over the sagebrush
hills. Stelzner and Hickey followed. A
fierce snowstorm was driving in their
faces, but they did not notice it. When
the big man entered the prison he was
surrounded by a half dozen clerks and
keepers, who shook his hand (his injured
right) very gently and congratulated him
on his victory.
"Oh, it is easy," was his simple reply.
"I'm out of the ring now, fellows. Yes,
that's right; I'm through with fighting. "
When the big fellow was stripped for the
bati. all the clerks and keepers who could
get near enough took a long and careful
survey of him. The only signs of injury
they could see besides ihose already men
tioned was a big discolored patch on the
left side of the body, about the lowest
ribs. There was a little swelling and the
contusions were blended in one mass of
color in which black and bluo prevailed.
Th"S9 showed where Corbett landed
many of his short half-arm right-hand
i jolts. "Does it hurt, Fitz? " asked one of
i the bystanders. "No; he didn't hart me,"
| saia the big fellow with a grin that snowed
i his even milk-white teeth.
While the champion was being rubbed
down his wife took a hot bath. She said
afterward that she thought it was good
j for the complexion. Tnis was by way of
joke, for Mrs. Fi'Zsimtnons, whom thous
*ands remember as Rose Julian, has a
i complexion of purest p-nk and white, in-
I dieating excellent health.
Fitz-immons and his wife drove home
and ate dinner. The reporter drove out
to the ranch about this time ana found
them at the tabie. The new champion
had finished a big ste:ik and a mound of
mea.y potatoes, for â which Nevada is
famous, and he was drinkin-j. Think of
the history of any other champion pugilist
you ever heard of anil then try to guess
with what rare vintage this world-beater
was washing down his meal.
He was drinking coffee, with milk and
sugar in it, out of a big. thick, cheap cup
that held half a pint. He invited his
caller to sit down and eat with him. His
invitation was not a bit of policy, for the
man knows as mucn about astronomy as
he doej about diplomacy. He soon fin
ished his meal and came into the parlor
where his caller was waiting. On a bed
near by lay a brown rive-ounce boxing
glove, its thumb reddened with Fitzsim
mons' own blood.
"Yes; that's the one I knocked Corbett
out with," be said in reply to a question.
"It was a swing that landed between the
heart ar.el the pit oi the stomach. It's the
same blow that I knocked Sharkey out
with."
"Did Corbett talk to you at any time in
the fight?" was asked.
'â¢No; but I talked to him," said the
champion. "I told him when we came
out for the thirteenth round: 'Hey, Jim,
this is the unlucky thirteenth for you.
I'm going to knock you out.' He didn't
say anything to me. I finished him in
the next round."
"There's no cut on the side of my head,"
F.tzsimmonÃ continued, showing both
side*. "I cut my ear wrestling with Itoe
ber a few days ago, and Corbett knocked
the cut open again with a swing."
Fltzsimmons showed his right hand.
The tlmmb was badly swollen and wrapped
in bandaging, and the knuckle at the base
of the first linger was. swelled up and
puffed.
"I knocked up that thumb in tie first
round," said the champion. "I swung
my rig'at for his jaw, but he ducked and
I struck the thumb against the back of
his head."
The only other mark of battle on the
big man not yet mentioned was a small
dis-coloration far under the left eye and a
tiny ont on the right side of the upper lip.
Fitzsimmons b>gan opening his mail,
which i.c said ha had forgotten to look at
yesterday. There were mascots enough
in the letters to supply a Â«-mall army
corps. The champion used his right band
with a great deal of difficulty.
Among the letters was one from Ithaca
inclosing a red pennant bearing the word
"Cornell" in white letters; also one dated
at Philadelphia and inclosinc a small bine
and red flag. The writer of the letter
wished Fitzsimmons success, and told him
him the flag had been used on the foot
ball field when the University of Pennsyl
vania team won a big victory last fail.
Filzsimmons lounged about the house
all day, playing with his baby and the
great dog Yarum. Once in a great while
there was alireak in his undemonstrative
nature. He would rush up, grab his wife
around the waist and whirl her around
the room. But these outbursts were not
frequent.
Filzsimmons expects to go to San Fran
cisco to-morrow and then to tour the
country. J. G. Mansfield.

Madden tried hard to get a match for
Stevo O'Donnell, but failed. Jeffries, the

in Corbett's training, is matched against
Theodore Van Bu-kirt of the San Fran

The good fortune which attended Dan
A. Stuart nnd .ill concerned in the great
championship battle yesterday was never
better demonstrated than it was this
morning, when the storm which the
weather deities kindly kept bottled up be
hind the western Sierras on St. Patrick's
day was let loose with full force. But
nearly all the sports had descried the
town, and those that remained were glad
enough to stay indoors and fight the bat
tle over again.
A number of sensational rumors which
were telegraphed to the effect that Fitz
simmons was dangerously ill, caused a
little excitement in the town. When
they became current there was a scurry
ing for vehicles to transport inquiries to
Cook's ranch, and the jaded livery horses
were robbed of an hour's rest by these ig
norant vaporings. When Fitzsimmons'
quarters were reached and the visitors'
mission made known, the champion and
his family expressed their indignation
freely at the croel canards.
The fact is that Fitzummons at no time
after he stepped out of the ring suffered
any physical pain beyond that caused by
a slight fracture of his right thumb joint
which he received in the second or third
round 01 the battle.

complexion ana a white linen bandage
wrapped around his thumb were tl.e only
external evidence of the confi ct. Fitz
simmons drove along leaving Julian and
Roeber as his representative* at the cele
bration of victory. The champion re
tired to rest shortly before midnight. He
suffered from musculur nervousness dur
ing tbe night and frequently woke up
with a startling twitch. When he arose
in the morning his joints ached a trifle,
but a hot mineral, bath in the springs at
the penitentiary quickly set him to rights
and a rub down left him completely re
freshed. He dined with Warden Hender
son and sprint a quiet afternoon playing
with Bob junior. Martin Julian was de
puted to answer the congratulatory cor
respondence, a task which kept him glued
to the telegraph counter for hours.
Stakeholder Al Smith turned over the
purse and sidebets to Julian this morning
in Dan Stuart's office. William A. Brady,
Secretary Wheelock and s few reporters
were present when the transfer was made
After the checks were handed over to
Julian, Brady renewed his offer made last
evening to back Corbett apainst Fitz-iim
mons for $20,000. Julian's reply wa s
evasive. He intimated that Fitzsimmons
would retire from the fistic arena, ana
judging by expressions uttered by the
Champion, it is not improbable that this
will be the case. All along Fitzsimmons
has asserted that this was the last time
that he would undergo the ordeal of train
ing.
FitzsimmonB 1 reply to Corbett after they
had shaken hands in Bob's corner yester
day indicated that the Australian was
thinkinc of retiring. "You're licked me
fair and square," said Jim. "Now I want
you to give me another chance." The
champion replied coldly: "I will not
fight you again."

OGDEN, Utah, March 18.â The "Par

Southern Pacific train brought two full
trainloads of returning sports from Car

interviewed at the depot by a representa

there was a wide diversity of opinion on
the outcome of the fight. The consensus
of opinion, however, was that tbe best
man won. Fitzsimmons simply outfought
the California champion, and the fight
demonstrated that a scientific boxer lias
no chance with a scientific fighter.

any fight at all. There are thirty middle
weights who could have whipped him.
He was dead so far as punching is con
cerned. Why, out of the 19G blows which
he landed on Fitzsimmons he only cut the
Cornishman's lip. Fitzsimmons did
fairly well and showed he knew how to
tight, but from a pugilistic point of view
the battle was not a great one."
Considinc echoed Gallagher's state
ments. He said: "Fitzsimmons had a
snap. Corbett could not hit hard enough
to hurt, and it was only his ability to get
away tbat saved hii/i long before the end
came. Corbett did not hurt Fiiz3immons
at nil. In the sixth round, when Corbeti
repeatedly put both mitts en Fitzsimmons'
jaw, everybody looked ior a knockout,
out Jim did not have the steam. Fitz
siramons went to his knees and the crowd
thought Corbett knocked him down. It
was no such thing. Fiizsimmons slipped
and clung to Corbett to save going to the
floor.
"As he rested on one knee for seven
seconds he winked at the men in his cor
ner, and when he got up he was as fresh
as at the beginning.
"If Sullivan fights Fitzsimmons it will
be a good tight. John L.'.-< methods are
similar to those of the Cornisnman, and if
they ever come together it will be a hot
slushing match."
Professor John Donaldson of Cleveland,
Ohio, a former trainer and warm friend of
Corbett, is of the opinion that Jim was
handled wrong both in training and in
the ring. He says Corbett was not in good
form and did not in any way demonstrate
that he was the same Corbett that defeated
Sullivan and Mitchell.
Vere Davics, brother of Parson Davies,
ventured the opinion that it was a great
fight and that Fitzsimmons is the better
man. Fitzsimmons proved tbat he was
no accident and Corbett demonstrated
that fancy boxing will not win a cham
pionship battle.
M.de Friest of Albany says that while
it was a good fight it was not a great one.
Corbett appeared to the uninitiated to
have the best of it all the way through,
bat while he rained blows all over Fitz
simraons his grand-stand boxing did no
barm. F.tzsimmons slipped in the sixth
round and Corbett got the credit of a
knockdown that he did not earn. De
Friest will back Sullivan against Fitzsim
mons for any amount.
Major Winthrop, president of the Lon
don Athletic Club, say* it was the greatest
tight of the cntury. He refused to stay
and si o the smaller tights so as not to spoil
the grand impression the championship
battle left with him.
Dave Lowensohn of Chicago said: "Cor
bett put up a Â«arne and scientific fight,
| but he lacked btsam. You can train a
I thoroughbred norse down to a rine edge,
but even tneii h- can't kick as hard as a
mule. Corbett fought well, but the re
puted cleverness wa3 not sufficient to
keep FitzÂ«immons away. The Cornish
man fore d the thing, and with ali bis
hitiinc Con.ttt coul<l not keep him away.
The iiest man nun, and he can do it every
time."
Tlie party left for ihe East over the Ilio
Graiwle Western at 11 o'clock N>-night.
Sullivan will got <.ff a* Bt. Louis, where
he opens with his theatrical company in a
Sunday afternoon matinee.

THUS CRUMBLE
ALL THE FAKES
Legislators Laugh as the
Coyote Bribsry Yarn
Fails.
Sleuths of Hearst's Lccal Sewer
of Scandal Tried in Vain to
Make a Story.
Testimony Before Investigators Shows
That Power Is Innocent of the
Allegations.
. SACRAMENTO. Cal.. March 18.â
George McCalvey, the ex-Deputy Secre
tary of State, who, for reasons wnich may
be surmised by those who know him best,
besought his friend Assemblyman Power
of San Francisco to confess to an Exami
ner reporter that he and several of his
colleagues had been bribed, was before the
investigating committee this afiernoon
and corroborated the statement of Re
porter Moran of the Examiner as to the
questions used by them to induce Power
to say something which would sound well
In the fake journal. He denied that ho
had received or had been promised any
money by the Examiner for his services,
or that he had been hired by that paper.
Attorney Morganstern represented
Power in the examination. "Why did
you advise Power to confess?" he asked.
"Because I thought he was cornered or
would be cornered, but Power denied very
emphatically that he had received any
money," responded McCalvey.
"Did you have any reason to believe
from Mr. Power's statement," asked Mr.
Morganstern, "that he had received any
promise of reward or money for his vote,
or to change his vote on that bill?"
"No, sir."
McCalvey testified that Power and Pack
ard were not concealed b. hind the green
baize screen at the main entrance, but
that Packard was leaning against one of
the pillars at the side of the big doors, and
Power was standing in front of him, both
in plain view of a score or more of people
in the lobby.
W. A. Ryan of the Chronicle told the
committee that he had gone with Packard
and Eagan (Packard's Iriend) to the Cali
fornia State Bank, where Cashier Gerber
informed him that he did not know Pack
ard, that no money had been drawn from
the bant by Packard or any one else, or
that any money had been received or order
for the payment of money from Biodgett
or any one else at Bakersfield.
Then they went to the Western Union
Telegraph office, where Packard author
ized the young lady in attendance to pro
duce any telegrams passing between him
self or any one else, and the young lady
replied after a search that there were no
such telegrams there. He had not seen
the telegram or a copy of it which ap
peared in the Examiner and the Chroni
cle, but its purport had been told him by
an Assemblyman who would not consent
to the use of his name.
On further inquiry the fact was elicited
that this Assemblyman had said to Mr.
Ryan that he had heard some one say that
he heard some one else say that th re was
a rumor that a telegram had been sent
statine that "S3OOO would save Bert on re-
consideration." This was the extent of
the information imparted to the Chronicle
reporter by the long-eared Assemblyman,
upon whem no libel can be committed, be
cause he chooses to remain anonymous.
Jdr. Morgsnstern asked the committee
to force the reporter to disclose the iden
tity of the scandal-monger, but the com
mittee did not care as the matter was
simply wild rumor and the gossip of a few
grannies in the Assembly.
The testimony of Mr. Ryan was a blow
at the head of the fatte, but the blow at
the heart of the fake was administered by
Cashier Gerbor of the California Sta;e
Bank, who swore that he did not know
Packard; that he had not received any
orders from Kern County or elsewhere to
pay Packard any money whatever, or from
any one to pay any one else any money in
connection with the coyote bill.
It will be remembered that both the Ex
aminer and the Chronicle asserted that
after Packard left the Assembly chamber
he went to tht Western Union office and
sent a dispatch about coyotes, the buzz
ing of the wires having sounded in the
ears of the Examiner Sherlock Holmes
like the yelping of coyotes.
Then they said that Packard went to
Gerber's bank and drew $3000, which he
probably distributed to Assemblymen,
with the exception of the half dozen vir
tuous legislators who told their sus
picions not to a policeman or to the
poundkeeper, but to the Examiner sleuth.
The day's evidence left ihe Examiner
not a leg to stand upon and convicted it
of having deliberately and maliciously
fakeci a libel for the purpose oi having a
sensation.
Secretary of State Brown testified that
be did not know that Packard or McCal
vey had any coyote scalp claims before
the State Board of Examiners.
Senator Voorheis of Amador was asked
as to the conversation testified to by
Wright of Alameda. The Senator said
that Wright remarked that he had voted
for the bill and he was very sorry for hav
ing done it, ar.d he was going to vote for
a reconsideration the next day. The wit
ness might have said that he hoped there
would not be another scandal.
Assemblyman Godfrey voted no, but
chanced his vole at the earnest solicita
tion of Emmons. "Emmoiii always stood
in with ray bills and I thought I would
return the favor," added Godfrey.
E. F. Moran of the Examiner was re
called and swore that Andy Lawrence
gave him instructions to interview Power
and that Lawrence said that if Power
was pushed hard be would contess to hav
ing been bribed. Lawrence told Moran
on that occasion that he had in his pos
session a telegram which showed evidence
that there had been bribery. He did not
show the telegram or state its contents.
Mr. Morganstern examined the witness
at some length in the attempt to show
that Moran had frequently "put up" for
the drinfesfor Power in order to get Power
drunk so that he mignt talk freely for the
Examiner. Moran denied the implica
tion, but admitted having called for Ihe
drinks witn gentlemanly frequency.
Assemblyman Lacy testified that As
semblyman Harris had asked him whether
he had got his "piece" out of the coyote
bill.
The committee laughed at this and ad
journed until 9 o'clock to-morrow morn,

Tha matter came up on the final pas
sage of Seawell's Senate bill 196. "I call
your attention to the fact," said Mr.
Dibble, â¢'that this bill is passed at the in

In concluding his remarks Mr. Dibble

LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 18.â The
Smiths and Buchanans, after a series of
family rows and interminable divorce lltl

matrimonial entanglements.
Judge Allen found a way to divorce A.
F Smith from Mary Smith today. Mr.
Buchanan and Mrs. Smith have not only
been the offenders, but the aggressors in
Iha divorce proceedings. The husband
secured his divorco on a cross-complaint.
Tiie two families lived together and
Buchanan ai:d Mrs. Smith renewed
"youthful friendship." The friendship
did not suit Mrs. Buchanan and Mr.
Smith, and it at laÂ«t resulted in a trip by
Mrs. Buchanan to New Mexico.
She had gone but, a few days when Mrs.
Smith and Mr. Buchanan called upon an
attorney and two divorce suits were
launched, one D 7 Buchanan aj>ainst his
wife, and the ether by Mrs. Smith against
her husband. The alleged ground in each

Recent Development* Renew Interest in
the Terrible Crime.
â¢ LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 18.â New
interest has been aroused in the terrible
tragedy which occurred near Santa Bar
bara last July, when â  Mrs. â  Mary Lang
Richardson and her daughter, Ethel, were
brutally murdered at their villa in Monte
cito. The citizens of Santa Barbara are
endeavoring to have Governor Build offer
a reward for the accomplices of Cyrus
Barnard. . . '
It was supposed that in his death the
sole perpetrator of the crime bad gone to
his account, but recent developments nave
led to a different belief, hence the action
of the Santa Barbara people.
While there is no doubt in the minds of
people generally that Barnard was guilty,
still the investigations that have been
made since the tragedy indicate that some
one else was with him. r . .
Barnard was slight of build, and the
evidences of the terrific struggle that the
women had with their murderers preclude
the idea that he was alone. Besides,, the
double set of footprints around the house,
found the morning after the murder, have
not been satisfactorily explained on the
theory that Barnard was single-handed in
the crime. '-'. -' '

VALENTINE'S WORK
IN THE ASSEMBLY
Has Passed Upon Many
Important Bills During
the Session.
Kept Busy as Chairman of the
Municipal Corporations
Committee.
Scores of Measures Carefully Consid.
ered by the M mb r From
Los Angeles.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 18.â L. H.
Valentine, chairmun of the Municipal
Corporations Committee, has handled
many important bills. Among them is
Assembly bill 22: "To provide a system of
street improvement bonds to represent
assessments for the cost of street work and
improvements within municipsliiies, and
also for the payment of such bonds."
As originally passed in 1893. this act
provided that in case of default in the pay
ment of any installment of principal or
interest the whole amount thereof should
become immediately due and payable, and
be sold in the same manner a 9 property is
sold for delinquent taxes. At that time'
the law for delinquent tax sales provided
that the property could be sold to indi
viduals; but subseauently, in 1895, it was
changed in th:s regard, so that the Stale
alone could purchase at tax ?ales. This
change in the latter law ipso facto
Assemblyman L. H .Valentine.
changed the bond law in like manner, and
enabled the State alone to be the pur
chaser in case of delinquent sale. Tne
purpose of this bill, No. 22, is to provide
a method of sale to individuals o
erty for delinquent payments under such
bonds, and so to restore the law in this
regard to what it was before the change
of the tfcx law. Toe committee made
several important amendments, and re
ported the bill favorably as amended.
Assembly bill No. 151. "To provide the
mode of changing grades of public streets,
lanes, alley?, courts and places wiihin
municipalities in the State of California."
The purpose of this bill is plainly stated
in the title. In 1893 a bill effecting the
same purpose wa- passed and became a
law, but was subsequently declared un
constitutional by the courts. The com
mittee gave iong and careful consideration
to this bill and altered it in many particu
lars, and feels well satisfied that as re
ported back by the committee it furnishes
a plain, simple and inexpensive method
of changing the grades of streets, and pro
tects the owners of properly to be nffucted
by the proposed change to the fullest pos
sible extent. The bill was ardently sup
ported before the committee by numerous
property-owner!", and also improvement
clubs and associations from San Fran
cisco, and is very satistactory also to the
city of Los Angeles.
Assembly bill No. 182 authorizes any
city and city and county of this State to
take its census. It was considered and
:avorab;y reported by this committee and
has sincp become a law. The purpose <>t
this bill is to enable cities to take their
census without waiting until the FeJeral
census. Under the Federal laws cities of
75,000 inhabitants are entitled to a certain
number ol letter-carriers who receive a
specified salary per year. Los Angeles in
this respect still stands in the eyes of the
Federal authorities as a city having a
population of 50,000, when in fact she has
over 75,000. Cities having a population of
75,000 are entitled to an increased number
of letter-carriers, each of whom receives
$150 per year more than those in cities
having only 50,000, and by taking a new
census Los Angeles will be rated as a city
of 75,000 and more and will be entitled to
an increased number of letter-carriers,
each of whom will receive an increased
salary. This bill was drawn by Post
master Matthews of Los Aneeles for the
express purpose of increasing the number
of letter-carriers of the city of Los An
geles.
The committee introduced as a substi
tute to Assembly bill 266 an act providing
a relief fund for injured and disabled fire
men of the volunteer fire departments in
incorporated cities and towns. By the
provisions of this substitute a relief fund
is created, out of which any member of
the department who shall become sick or
injured while in the actual discliorp;e of
his duties shall be entitled to $10 per
week benefits for a period not to
exceed twelve consecutive weeks for any
one injury or disability, and in case of
permanent injury the board of directors
may pay him an amount not to exceed
$50 per annum. This bill was urgently
supported by advocates from fire depart
ments of Â« numDer ot the interior cities of
this State.
Assembly bill 862, an act amending the
act for tlie organization, incorporation
and government of municipal corpora
tions so as to permit cities of the sixth
class to purchase, lease or consiruct water
works, an electric plant and all machinery,
conductors and appliances necessary there
for, and to supply the inhabitants thereof
with water, heat, light and power, was re
ported favorably by the committee .and
has passed both houses. This bill is de
signed especially to enable the city of

HONESTY PAYS IN PORTLAND.
Lucky Chance That Suddenly Raises John
Cardigan Frcm Poverty to .
Affluence.
PORTLAND, Or., March 18.â Coming
out of the Washington-street entrance of
Olds & King's store late yesterday aiter
noon a lady unconsciously dropped her
purse from her handbag on the sidewalK,
and entering a private carriage she was
driven away.
It was the good luck of John Cardigan,
a laborer, who with his family lives in
Goose Hollow, to pas 3 along just at that
time and he picked up the purse, but be
fore be could return it to the owner the
carriage had reached Sixth street. Like
the honest man he proved himself, he did
not stop to examine the contents of the
purse, but followed the carriage tilt lie at
tracted the attention of the coachman on
Park street, when he delivered the find to
the owner. \
The lady kindly thanked Cardigan for
his honesty and rewarded him by giving
him the entire contents of the putse,
amounting to a $5 trold piece and a few
nickel?. Further she atked him for his
address and occupation, adding that he
would hear from her husband.
Cardigan has a wife ami three children,
and ha- not bad a day's work in the
pi3t four month*. Of this he apprised
the generous lady in answer to some of
her questions, which presumably im
pelled her to say that her husband would
look him up.
She is the wife of one of the wealthiest
men here â one who appreciates honorable
qualities in his fellowman â hence Cardi
gan's St. Patrick's day is likely to Drove
the dawn of undreamed-of luck in his
career.
This afternoon he was appointed super
intendent of a farm owned by the lady's
husband in Clackaraas County, with a
good salary and a comfortable home and
provision for his family.

WILD MAN'S FATAL WORK.
Dave Psnnington Wounds Three People and
Then Blows the Top of H>s
Head Off.
ODEBOLT, lowa. March 18.â This after
noon Dave Pennincton, a worthless char
acter who has been loafing around Ode
bolt all winter, loaded a shotgun and
started out to kill a number of people who j
had incurred !:is enmity.
His first nunt was A. F. Walter, against
whom he had a grudge, but Walter saw
him coming and hid. Then Pennington
went to the house of Hiram Johnson, a
plasterer, and fired at Mrs. Johnson, se
riously wounding her in the shoulder and
back. He next emptied both barrels into
Luther Traver, an old resident, killing
him Instantly. Then he pointed the pun
at Mrs. Frank BtolJ, a neighbor, who went
to her door on hearing the noise. She ran
into the house, closing the door behind
her, but Pennington fired through the
Uoor, fatally wounding tbe woman in the
abdomen.
All this took place in fifteen minntes.
The neighbors gave the alarm and Pen
nington retreated slowly across some va
cant lots, loading his gun as he went.
Constable Flathers and Marshal Strath
corn followed him. Penniugton called to
Flathers and dared him to shoot. The
officer hesitated and then Pennington ex
claimed: "Well, if you haven't the oerve
to shoot, I have."
Then ha placed the muzzle of the gun
to bis forehead and blew the top of his
nead off, scattering his brains and pieces
of bis skull fifty feet around him.
Pennington was undoubtedly insane.
He was a hard character, but not a drink
ing man, and resented comments that
had been made by his victims of his rela
tions with a married woman of the neigh
borhood.
The town is in gloom over the tragedy.
Mr. Traver, Mr. Stoll and Mr*, Johnson
are all highly respected peoDle. It is
thought that Mr. Stoll cannot recover, but
Mrs. Johnson may.

AT CARSON CITY
Windy Smith Bores a Hole
in His Friend Jack
Bradford.
Result of a Frivolous Dispute
and a Keual to Take
a Drink
The Tragedy Had Many Humorous
Phasesâ Sheriff Kinney Prevents
a Lynching
â¢jCARSON, Nev., March 18.â The st>orts
who are left in Carson have been discuss
ing all day lone the incidents attending
the first sun play made in the valley for
nearly a year. This occurrence startled
the promenaders on Seymour avenue just
before midnight.
The participants in the shooting â or
rather tne participant, for there was only
oneâ was "Windy" Smith of Randsburg,
â¢Cal. The man who did not participate
was Jack Bradford of Butte City, Mont.
It appears that they had been friends for
a great many years, but they got into an
argument about the gold that has been
taken' out of the Comstock lode. Smith
contended that nearly ?900,000,000 had
been realized, while Bradlord refused to
believe that one-ball oi that amount had
been taken out.
"Well, I don't think you know any
thing about mining anyway," said Smith
in a good-natured way; "you are a kind
of a lobster."
"Well, we won't quarrel over the matter
of a few hundred millions," said Brad
ford ; let's go and take a drink."
"I wouldn't drink with a lobster like
you," said Smith.
Some harsh words followed and all of a
Â«udden Bradford, who is a 6-footer. pro
:eeded to deal out to Smith quite as much
punishment as Fnzsimmons gave Corbett.
'he men wrestled about on the sidewalk
in fr.ont of the Magnolia saloon, and as
soon as Smith could get one hand free he
drew from his belt a big 44-caliber revolver
find placing it against Bradford's body,
tired and then took to his heels. Tne bul
let punctured the abdominal coil in sev
eral places and came out through Brad
ford's back. Hestagserei for a moment,
byt did not fall. Enteryig the saloon he
sank into a chair, where he remained for
some moments groaning.
"Lay me down on tiie floor," he said to
the barkeeper, "and give me a little fire
-wnter."
They lifted him from the chair and
carried him into the back room, where a
,big faro game was in progress. Some of
the piayers stopped lone enough to cast a
glance in the direction of the mortally
wounded Montana man and asked what
ailed him, but in other respects his en
trance to the gambling-bail did iiot attract
any more attention than if he had waited
in and announced his intention of betting
$50 on ill e high card. .Bradford writhed
wici j>ain\ bfit before the physicians ar
nved tie said to one ot the barkeepers:
"I don'i care at all about being croaked,
bui tne idea of being croaked by a four
flusher like Windy Smith is the roughest
deal I can think of."
"I guess we had better take hid boots
off; don't you think so?" remarked a by
stander. "It is a custom he have out
here.' 1
"All right, take them off," said Brad
ford ; "I don't want to die with them on."
With about as much ceremony as though
they were banding the fallen man a plug
of tobacco, the barkeeper toofc off his
boots, and then Bradford seemed to feel
better.
Sheriff Kinney and several of hi 3 depu
ties found "Windy" Smith playing against
a chuck-a-lucK game in Chinatown. He
did not make the slightest resistance, but
announced the fact that he was $8 loser
and would like to get even.
"I shot that fellow in self-defense,"
sa id Windy, "lam glad I didn't shoot
him last night, or 1 would have missed the
figtit."
When Bradford's friends, who came up
from Butte City to the fight in a special
car, heard of h:s hard luck they left tr.eir
Pullman, and made a wild dash lorthe
scene of the tragedy. They all knew
"Windy" Emith, and not a man in the
party seemed to have an exalted idea of
bin.
When the Montana delegation "lined
up in front of the jail Sheriff Kinney,
who has had some experience in standing
off lynching-bees, suspected that there
was trouole brewing.
"Boyf," he said, addressing the friends
of Bradford, "I am a man of very lew
words. I'm going to take the bull by the
horns and tell you fellows right now that
nothing goes if you have any intentions
of holding a necktie social. '"Windy"
Smith i<< in here, ana he is gome to stay
iiere until we send him to ihe peniten
tiary. If he is guilty ihe citizens of this
county will be present at his official cash
ing-in."
"The Sheriff i 3 a good fellow, boys,"
eaid one of xut Butte men, "and I euess
the be-t thing we can do is to see that
poor old Bradford is taken care of during
ni-s last hours. We will take him up a
bottle of liquor and some chewing to
bacco. 1 '
Sc> the party marched up to tne Bngss
House, where the physic. ans were making
preparations to perform an operation.
"Hello, mates," said Bradford. "I
guess I am done lor, but it's awful tough
luck to have a duck hire 'Windy' Smith
croak you. You lads can't understand
how badly my feeiincs are hurt, bu: I
know that if they don't string 'Windy' up
in Nevada 1 know that some of my pards
who are in ibis room will take good care
to provi-ie a first-class funeral for him
elsewhere."
"You can bet on that." came in a chorus
from the roueh miners. "We will at
tend lo him, Jack, never fear."
jactc's friends remained with him until
aftor the operation, but he had not re
gained consciousness up to a late hour to
night, and the surgeons said that there
was absolutely no chance for him to live
through the night.
FRESNO'S MISSING MAN.
Judg3 Spencer H. Hill's Disappearance
Gives Rise to a Story of
- : Embezzlement.
FRESNO. Cal., March 18.â The where
abouts of Judpe Spencer H. Hill, a pio
neer settler of Fresno County and a resi
dent of this city ever since it was estab
lished, are unknown. The last heard of
hi.ni was when lie was in Portland, Or.,
about three months ago. According to
The best accounts he has levanted and
does not dare to return home and face the
prosecution that would be instituted
against him. About rive years Â»go George
McCuilougb, an old-time Jriend of Judge
Hill, became an inv.ilid and intrusted the
care of bis property to him. By various
misrepresentations the faithless friend
succeeded in evading the giving of an ac
counting and McCuliough now finds that
he is practically penniless. The amounts
that Judce Hill has madeaway with while
acting as ngent will aggregate several
thousand dollars, although no definite
figure can be ascertained.
A couple of months aco McCullough
sent Hill to Oregon to sell some land for
him. Tne agent sold the land bui has not
returned, aitnough it is now several weeks
pa -a the appointed time. It is believed
that he is spending McCullough's money.
Judce Hill was for many years the
School Superintendent of this county and
Justice of the Peace in tn s city for a
number of terms. He was prominent in
the early history of tne county and has al
ways borne a reputation asainst which
not a word could be said. Whisky is th a
cause of his downfall. He is now over 70
years of ace.
NEWS OF SAN JOSE.
Boy Train-Wreckers Examined â One Ds-
charged, the Other Will Probably
Be Sent to WhUtier.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 18.â John and
Peter Cirave^na, the Italian boys who at
tempted to wreck a train near Murphy
station by putting dynamite on the track,
were examined on a charge of train
wrecking before Justice Beverly at Mount
ain View to-day. The boys are aged 12
and 14 yeais respectively.
The examination lasted but a couple of
hours and was merely formal, as the boys
had already made a confession of the
crime to District Attorney Herrington.
The elder of the two boys said he pu' the
dynamite on the track to see how high it
would make the engine jump.
On motion of the Di-trict Attorney the
charge against Peter Ciravegna, the
younges: lad, was dismissed, as it was
shown he had nothing to do with placing
the dynamite on the track and was an un
willing witness to the act. The charge
I against John Ciraveena was taken under
! hdvisement by Justice Beverly until
I March 31.
It is understood the boy's father will
have him committed to the Whittier Re
form School, and it ihis is done the charge
of train-wrecking will be dismissed, as
there was no SDecitic intent on the part of
the boys to wreck the train.
Train- wrecking is a capital offense, pun
ishable by life imprisonment or death.

the charge of robbery. The victim is an
Italian laborer named Dominick Tenti.
Tenti left Harrison last Friday evening in
company with the Voik brothers, walsing
along the railroad track toward his cabin,
about a mile from town. Later in the
nignt some parties passing that way found
Tenti lying across the rails in an uncon
scious condition. He was badly injured
about t lie head, where he had been struck
numerous blow-*.
The fingers of both of his hands were
baulv Irozen. When he was brought to
later in his cabin he said that the Yolk
brothers were the perpetrators of the act;
that they had robbed him of $50 and laid
him across the rails so that a passing train
would run over him and thus cover up
their crime.
Sheriff Pease stated that when he left
Harrison Tenti was not expected to sur
vive. At the request ol a magistrate the
accused men were taken before their vic
tim and were positively identified by him.
Upon the advice of the attending physi
cian an ante-mortera statement of the in
jured man wa- taken.
The YolK brothers, when seen nt the
County Jail, were non-committal, assi rt
ing that they had nothing to say what
ever. They would neither affirm nor
deny that they were in any way implicated
iv the matter.

Ex- CaÃhier Peter* la Likely to Escape
; Punishment.
TACOMA, Wash., March 18. âThrough
sickness Cashier Peters of the Colum
bia National Bank to-day succeeded in se
curing a second postponement of his trial.
Tlio indictments against him charge em
bezzlement, falsifications of records, etc.
Last year he was first tried and the jury
disagreed. Two weeks ago he failed to ap
pear in the Federal court for trial, alleg
ing sickness. 1 Judge Gilbert , appointed
severr.l doctors to examine him. Two re
ported him not dangerously ill, as alleged,
and the court refused â¢ postponement of
the trial until next ; winter. To-day Pe
ters was suddenly taken worse, and after
careful examination by four pnysicsans
Judge Gilbert granted a postponement
until next November. In legal circles it
is believed that Peters will never again be
tried, because of: the great difficulty ex
perienced in securine the attendance of

FAMILY TRAGEDY
P. H. Dallidet Jr. Fatally
Shot by His Brother,
John B.
Prominence of the Parties Causes
General Regret in the
Community.
The Wounded Man Was in the Rial-
Estate Business â His Assailant
Is in Prison.
SAN LUIS OBISPO. Cal., March 18.â
P. H. Daliidet, a well-known and promi
nent citizen, was tbe victim of a lamenta
ble tragedy this afternoon. He is badly
wounded and will probably die. Two
shots were beard near bis father's borne
and. several people rushed to tbe scene.
He was found in an unconscious condition
on the walk in the yard near tbe bouse. â¢
A physician was summoned, and ex
amination showed) that be bad received
two br.d wounds from a shotgun fired at
close range from the rear. Tbe first charge
entered near the Jeft sboulder, while the
other penetrated his left side near the
kidneys. The shots were fired in rapid
succession, and he bad tried to make bis
escape, but was not over ten feet away
when struck the second time. He recov
ered consciousness soon alter, but his con
dition is very critical and he is not ex
pected to live.
It was soon found out that ?ne wounded
man's brother, John B. Dallidet, bad done
tbe deed, and his rash act was the result
of family differences. The assailant was
t -ikeii into custody by Sheriff Ballou, and
will be held to await tbe result of bis
brother's injuries. The family is highly
respected, being residents of this city for
many years, and great sympathy is ex
pressed over the unfortunate affair. The
wounded man is known throughout tbe
State, and at one time was a partner of C.
H. Phillips In this city in the land busi
ness. He owned a great deal of land in
this county, but has met with reverses
of late, anu when the shots were fired it
was thought be bad committed suicide.
The report of the shooting wben first cir
culated ~A'aÂ« hardly believed, owing to tbe
prominence of the parties who are known
10 be of a peaceable disposition.
Bad biood had existed between the
brothers for *onie time, growing out of the
financial affairs of P. H. Dallidet Jr., who
has greatly crippled the family resources
on account of his poor financiering in real
estate speculation.
lor so me time past P. H. Dallidet Jr.
had visited his father's honia frequently,
and upon such visits had made Himself
exceedingly obnoxious by the abuse of his
father, his brothers, John and Paul, and
ins two sisters. When at home he always
carried a gun, and often threatened to
kill particular members of the family.
To-day ne visited his home and Was in
very bad humor, his abuse of his father,
who refused him financial assistance, be
ing unusually violent.
John Dallidet is much grieved over the
affair, and intimates that be was in a pos.
tion where he had to protect himself.
His brother bad frequently abused the
father at different times, and to-day was
more abusive than ever, and John had
told him. to cease chiding the old man or
he would be compelled to take a hand in
the matter and protect his parent. To
John's remarks the man who is now
wounded answered by applying some
abusive language to him in the French
tongue.
He bad made a move as if to take a pis
tol irom his hip-pccket, when John,
thinking that his brotuer was about to
shoot him, picked up a breech-loading
shotgun and tired, with the result stated.
There was some great provocation in the
matter, as the prisoner is a man who
moves in the best society and is highly
spoken of by all who know him. The
Dallidets are the owners of a large winery
and vineyard, besides considerable busi
ness property In this city.

T c people who were engaged in the

A bill introduced into the Senate for the

Blizzards are blowing in the Northeast
and rivers are flooding the country in the

The investigating committee of the
Senate and that of the Assembly agree in
leporting there is no evidence whatever
to support the charge of bribery in con
nection with Assembly bill 273. That
ends the episode in the Legislature and
nothing remains of it but the jail pro*

The New York Legislatnie is wrestling
with a proposition to revise the marriage
laws of the State, and some of the re

sort of an issue we may run up against in

The announcement that the Governor,
the Controller and representatives of the

devise a plan for reducing the tax levy to
40 cents on the $100 Ifl encouraging. The
people dedire just that thing, and if the
conferees can accomplish it they will win
golden opinions from all sorts of people.
The arbitration treaty as amended by
the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions is a very different thing from the
Olney treaty, and will find much more
favor with the people. It reserves to the
Senate a right to a voice in deciding what
questions shall be submitted to arbitra
tion, and is in every respect a much more
American document than the former one.
THE CAUSE OF CUBA.
The dispatches of yesterday from Wash
ington announce that a Cabinet meeting
had been held to consider the case of the
Dauntless, now under surveillance by the
Government oih'cials at Jacksonville.
Upon the solution of this case depends
the decision of the new administration
with regard to its Cuban policy, and the
conference therefore was of no little im
portance to the country ut large.
While no decision was arrived at in tbe
particular case it is gratifyine to know
that the new administration has so
promptly given consideration 10 the prob
lems arising from the situation in Cuba.
It is to be hoped the Government will see
its way clear to taking a position which
will materially aid the cause of the Cuban
patriots without violating any of tbo
duties which international Jaw imposes
upon the United States.
It is worthy of note that aince the new
administration came into oftice the Span
ish officials in Cuba have been careful
not to oppress or wrcng any American
citizen in the island. No issue has arisen
which would give to Secretary Sherman
an opportunity to show his zeal in pro
tecting our citizens abroad. This careful
ness on the part of Weyler may be due to
the fact that ne recognizes in the new ad
ministration a force quite different from
that of Grover Cleveland, and is wise
enough to give it no occasion for inter
ference.
It will be remembered that in his inaug
ural addres* President McKinley declared,
"It will be our aim to pursue a firm and
dignified foreign Dolicy which snail be
just, impartial, ever watchful of our Na
tional honor, and always insisting npon
the enforcement of the lawful rights of
American citizens everywhere." It is evi
dent that these diplomatic words hÂ»ve
been understood in their true meaning by
the Spanish authorities, and that we shall
hear no more of those complaints of ill
treatment of Americans in Cuba which
were so frequent under the Cleveland
recime.
In all that McKinley has raid about our
non-interference with the domestic con
cerns of other nations the people are as
fully agreed as tney are in support of his
declaration oi an intent to maintain the
rights of Americans abroad. Neverthe
less they do not regard the affairs of Cuba
as altogether foreign. It is an American
island, and of right ought to be under the
protection of the American continental
system. Public sentiment on the subject
will be fully manifest at the mass-meet
ing to be held in this City to-morrow
evening, and that sentiment, while declar
ing emphatically for the protection of
American citizens in Cuba, will be hardly
less strong in expressing itself in favor of
the cause of the patriots and the inde
pendence of the island.
THE AEBITRATION TREATY.
As was expected the Committee on For
eign Relations has decided to make several
important amendments to the propesed
arbitration treaty with Great Britain be
fore reporting it to the Senate. These
amendments are of a character which will
render the treaty much more in accord
ance with public opinion and will go far
toward making it acceptable to tha people.
According to reports from Washington
the committee has decided to strike out
all the objectionable features in the Oiney
agreement. The designation of King
Oscar of Sweden and Norway as umpire
has been removed and so also has been
ali reference to the Supreme Court of the
United States as members of the arbitra
tion triounaL In place of members of the
court the amended treaty will provide
that our representatives among the arbi
trators shall consist of "jurists of repute,"
to be appointed by the President.
The most notable amendment is one
which reserves to the Senate equally with
the President the power of deciding what
questions shall be submitted to arbitra
tion. This change materially affec.s the
whole nature of the trenty and puts it in
accord with our form of government.
Under the Olney plan the President
would have had absolute control of all our
relations with Great Britain and could
have submitted any question whatever to
arbitration without the consent or even
the knowledge of the Senate. That clause
would have virtually set aside the consti
tution, which provides that the Senate as
well as the President shall have control of
our foreign relations. The amendment
therefore is one which is certain to be
adopted and which in itself will go far
toward relieving the treaty as first pro
posed of its most objectionable features.
It is probable the first important work
to be undertafcea by the Senate will be
the consideiation of this treaty, and as it
is favored by the administration, its adop
tion may be expected. It will be, how
ever, an altogether different treaty from
that proposed by Mr. Cleveland, and may be
clearly accounted among the accomplish
ments of the McKinley administration.
The Cleveland treaty would undoubtedly
have been defeated. That which is pro
posed will not only win the approval of
the Senate, but will have the commenda
tion of the whole people, and will be one
of the first good results to the country of
the substitution of a statesman in place
of a dogmatic theorist in the Presidency.
ADULTERATED JELLIES.
The announcement that the Board
of Health has discovered that a large
proportion of the jellies sold in our
stores are adulterated wiil be no sur
prise to intelligent people. It has
long been known that such was the
case, and the only new information con
tained in the report of the board is the
statement that a considerable number of
these adulterations have been found to be
dangerous as lood.
It b one of the strange developments of
modern commerce that in a land like
California, where frufPis so abundant,
such adulterations can be profitably sold.
We let thousands of tons of fruit go to
waste every year in our orchards or our
marketplaces and yet import from abroad
pretended fruit products which are not
only adulterated, but are absolutely in
jurious to the health of the people.
According to the analysis of the ohem
ist of the Board of Health the purchaser
of currant jelly may get a harmless mix
ture of apple and currant jelly, or a harm
ful mixture of apple jelly and starch col
ored with aniline dye, or a dangerous
mixture in which coal-tar colors and
aceticacidare mixed. Of thirty-three sam
ples of jelly purchased in various parts of
the City, ten were found to be so adul
terated as to be dangerous as food, and a
number of others were sufficiently doc
tored to render their sale as currant jelly
a fraud upon the public.
Sooner or later the people of the United
States will have to adopt radical and dras
tic measures in dealing with the adultera
tion of l'oods. Modern science has now
advanced ao far in the mastery of chem
ical compounds that swindlers who make
use of science can be effectually com
bated only by persons who have an equally
scientific knowledge of food products. It
is impossible for the average citizen to
have the skill required to analyze ttie food
which he buys in the open mancet, nor is

it desirable that be should be compelled
to do so. This is one of the tasks which
may be rightly imposed upon the Govern
ment and it should be undertaken not
merely by municipalities, but by ihe Na
tion.
We produce in the United States abun
dant supplies of good food for all our peo
ple, and it is a reflection upon our intelli
gence that we permit such food to go to
waste for lack of a market while adul
terated and dangerous counterfeit articles
are sold in our stores and consumed iv
our homes.
EECIPROOITY.
Under the new tariff the reciprocity pro
visions will be much larger than those
under the McKinley tariff of 1890. Not
only have ail the reciprocity features of
the former act been rally restored, but the
policy has been extended by adding to
sugar, tea, coffee and hides as articles of
which to make reciprocal agreements such
articles os champagne, brandy, wines,
artificial and natural mineral waters,
arsrols and si.k laces.
While the addition of these new articles
to the list of coods on which the Govern
ment has the right to reduce duty in order
to promote commercial relations with for
eign countries will materially aid the
administration in arranging reciprocity
treaties, it will be seen there is some dan*
ger in them to California. Our people are
materially interested in tbe maintenance
of protective duties on champagne,
brandy, wines and mineral waters. It
would be an injury to some of the most
important industries of this State if these
articles were placed on tbe free list in
order to facilitate tbe commerce of our
Eastern cities.
Under the new tariff, as it stands, ample
duties are placed on champagne, wines
and brandies. These duties, however, are
none too large to maintain the prosperity
of the grape-growing industry in Cali
fornia against the competition of older
vineyards and cheaper labor in Europe.
There would be a distinct loss to us in
these industries in any and every treaty
of reciprocity which would permit the free
entry of foreign wines and brandy to com
pete with the home industry.
The subject is oue to which the attention
of the grape-growers and wine and brandy
producers of the State should be called.
The Republicans of California are ai
favorable to reciprocity treaties as those of
any other State in the Union, but there is
no reason why California industries
should be sacrificed to promote the trade
of the East. It will be the duty of the
California delegation in Congress to guard
carefully against any injury to the State
on this score. Reciprocity treaties which
will allow the free entry of wines and
brandies should not be negotiated with
any nation which is a large producer of
those articles. If due protection is given,
California can produoe all the wine that
the people of the United States need, and
no treaty should be arranged mat will
interfere with the development of the
industry. ,
TAX REDUCTION.
The announcement tbat the Governor,
the Controller and representatives of the
Finance and the Ways and Means com
mittees of the Senate and Assembly are
engaged in an earnest endeavor to reduce
the appropriations of the Legislature to
such an extent that all expenditures may
be provided for by a tax levy not exceed
ing 40 cents on the $100 is in the highest
I degree gratifying to the people. It ii to
be hoped these efforts will not Le in vain,
and that such reductions may be made
| without imperiling the service of any of
! the institutions of the State or involving a
deficiency which wiiltentail excessive tax
ation later on.
It is beyond question that many of the
appropriations made during this session
can be reduced without materially injur
ing any institution or depriving the State
of any necessary public improvement. It
will be the duty of the Governor and the
conferees of the two houses of the Legis
lature to decide where these reductions
can be made. It in upon their judgment
that the people mast rely for protection
from waste and extravagance, and for-
innately the earnestness with which they
seem to have undertaken the task prom
ises good results.
The need of economy at this time is
everywhere recognized. The long de
pression resulting from the experiments
with a Democratic tariff has carried a
sense of want into every household and
comparative destitution to many families.
That depression still weighs upon the
people, and while there is now every
prospect of a revival of industry and a
return of prosperity it will not dolor the
Legislature to lorestall it by any taxation
not absolutely necessary to provide for
the maintenance of the State govern
ment. It will be with close interest,
therefore, that the people will watch the
proceedings now undertaken to reduce the
rate of taxation, and if it is effected to
anything like the extent desired, the mem
bers of this Legislature, upon their re
turn home, will receive a degree of com
mendation and approval from their con
stituents which has been unknown in the
politics of California for many years.

on the rocks off the south point of Santa
Margarita Island, in Magdalena Bay, at 5:15

are termed the first variety, those having a

having the greatest curvature the third va

variety, multiply the difference between the
head diameter and the bung diameter (inside
measurement) by the decimal .55 and add the
product to t'ue head diameter, the sum
being the mean diameter. For the
second variety multiply the difference
between the two diameters ay the decimal .03,
lidding the product to the nead diameter; for
the third variety multiply by the decimal
.70, and, as above, adding the product to the
head. Having thus found the mean diameter,
to find the capacity multiply the square of
tne mean diameter, in inches, by the decimal
.0034, which Is substantially the same as di

FRATERNAL FELLOWSHIP.
The Manner in Which Keystone Lodge,
Knight* of Honor, Entertained the
Grand .Representative*.
The entertainment, banquet and ball given
by the members of Keystone Lodge No. 2107,
Knights ol Honor, to the representatives to
tne Grand Lodge last Tuesday night was a
combination of functions, the like of which
has never been equaled in the order.
The entertainment was in Â£1 Dorado Hall,
in the Alcazar building, in the presence of v
large number of persons, who were there by
invitation, it being a purely invitational
affair. There were the grand officers, grana
representatives, members of the lodge, with
their wives, daughters and lady friends, and a
limited number of invlied guests. The first,
event was a short address of welcome by Fred"
Raabe, the purveyor ol the talent, alter
whicn Miss Margaret Davis, a young
native daughter yet in the lower teens,
who has developed a wonaerful ability in
instrumental music, gave Rubenstein's
"Valse Caprice" on the piano witu a precision
and .-locution that cafieU forth many words
of praise from professionals who were in the
hall. Grand D.ctator Archibald delivered a
short address, reviewing the work of the
Kn:ghts and paid a compliment to Keystone {
Lodge, fcaying that it is the one tnut has been j
Hi.-, most active in the jurisdiction. MUs
Grace L?ster entertained the audience with
"Love's Morning," a vocal solo. The Rnisch
sisters gave a piuiio duet which was well re
ceived. Then that prince of gooi lellows,
Alired WUkie, sang "Sally in Our Alley." and
his rendition was so acceptable that tv was
forced to give an encore. Sheriff R. I. Win- lan,
who is always a favorite wherever he vol
unteer?, sang several popular songs and was
loudly applauded. Miss Maguerite Stone, with a
great deai of lorce and with good effect, re
cited "Summer Dreams," ouu of Eugene
Field's last poems. By permission of the
management of the Orpheum the bellringers
and Mr. Prescott, the ventriloquist and imi
tator, gave evidences of their skill, and these
were very taking numbers. Miss .Cathrine
the Tivoli Opera-house, by permis
sion of the management, sang with tine effect
"Parlaite Amour," and was forced to give an
encore. James Donahue was vociferously ap
plauded lor his rendition of "Don't You Tell
Her That You Love Her" and -'Your Baby's
Come to Town." The entertainment was
brought to a close with recitations by Frank
B, Clayton, who gave "At the Opera," anc 1
Walter A. Belasco. who gave '-The Prisoner's
Plea for Little Tim." These geutlemen ap
peared by the courtesy of Messrs. Belascu and
La Faille of the Aicazar.
Fred Raabe, past dictator of Keystone
Lodge, was master of ceremonies, and he acted
his part weli. He then turned the audience
over to the care of C. H. Holcomb, who con
ducted it to the banquet In Social Hall, on the
upper floor. Thi r.- all feasted on the good
things laid before them and listened to an elo
quent address by Past Grand Dictator William
Henry Barnes, who pointed with pride to a
banner tnat occupied a conspicuous place in
the hall bearing the inscription, "Banner
Lodge, K. of X 1.," itud which has lor a long
time been held by Keystone. The hall was
cleared for dancing, which was kept up until
a late hour. During the evening icecream was
served to the ladles in a hall adjoining the
dance hall.
Progressive Endowment Guild.
San Francisco Chapter No. 328 of the Pro
gressive Endowment Guild held a very enthu
siastic and interesting meeting in ft. George's
Hall last Wednesday evening, when two can

It is proposed to establish a central
home in San Francisco with branches here
and elsewhere; to maintain the same at
minimum cost for the use of stockholders
and others, providing them with places
for eating and sleeping and with other
reasonable comforts of life, including
batbs, reading and lecture rooms, gymna

and female, when worthy, and to relieve
the deserving needy when in sickness or
want; to take and let contracts with per
sons and corporations for any kind of
labor, skilled or unskilled, and to do such
labor directly by the employment of its
stockholders or any other convenient man

As the result of only three days' work
on the boulevard the hill on the City lot
has been more than half cut through, and
on the Bide adjoining the Almsbouse road
the ground has been cleared and eraded
along its entire length. About 60 feet

As soon as Robert Fitzs'.mmona reaches
San Francisco from tneacenoof bis recent
triumph he will be approached by a depu
tation of the unemployed, whien will psJc
him to give a sparring exhibition for the
benefit of the armory organi#ation.
This brilliant suggestion was offered by
a member of sporting proclivities at last
niebt's meetinc, and 'he organization at
once determined to put it into execution.
Tlie meeting turned temporarily from
this brignt prospect to impeach four mem
bers on the charge of appropriating the
proceeds of the sale of concert tickets.
The culprits were unable to defend them
selves in a satisfactory manner and were
summarily ejecte t into outer darkness.
Another gentleman, "ashy, slow-spoken
man/ wanted the organization to furnish
him with the wherewithal to redeem his
trunks from the cluicbes of an obdurate
and unsympathetic landlady, but this
modest proposal did not evoke any enthu
siasm.
Chairman Lemngwell informed the
meeting that the certificate of incorpora
tion would arrive Saturday forenoon, by
which time they hoped to be in new quar
ters.
The executive committee was author
ized to draft the necessary regulations
and by-laws, to be submitt d to the or
ganization for approval upon the arrival
of the certificate.

OPERATIC COMEDY
AND TRAGEDY
French Singers Give a
Double Bill at the
California.
"Les Ncces de Jeannette" Does
Not Weary With Its
Dialogue.
Masca;ni's "Cavalleria Rusticana"
Brings Out Some GodJ Singing.
Albers' Fins Work-
The French operatic organization at the
California Theater combined two entirely
different kinds of bills last night. The
first part.of the programme consisted of
Michael Carres' and V.ctor Masses frothy
little operetta, 'Lea JSoces de Jeannette,"
and the second part of the Dill was Mas
cagnie's musical melodrama, "La Caval
leria Rustieana."
"Les Noces de Jeannotte" pleased the
audience better than "Mi<s HelyeU" did
on Saturday, probably because there is
more singing and consequently less dia
logue. Jeannette is a young peasant girl
who is about to marry a man in her own
rank of life nanv d Jean. At the eleventh
hour jean thinks better of his proposed
marriage, looks on the wine when it is red,
and when he finds that he has been
tricked into signing the murrii-ge con
tract by the wily Jeannette he breaics all
the furniture in his very modest little
home.
Jeannette is not daunted, however.
While Jean is sleeping off the effects of
the win- in the hayloft she has the house
refurnished regardles3 of expense, cooks
her recreant lgrd a nice omelet and makes
him so comfortable on his awakening that
he agrees to love her and live happy ever
afterward.
M. Freiche was a clever Jean, and sus
tained the dialogue entirely on his own
shoulders, for Mme. Berthet as Jeannette
scarcely raised her speaking voice above
the ordinary conversational tone of a lady
talking in a drawing-room, and the con
sequence was that the dialogue had to be
gathered almost entirely trom Freiche's
side of the conversation.
In compensation for this carelessness in
the dialo^ueJMnie. Berthei sang so charm
ingly that sbe may be said to have carried
off a large sliare of the honors of the per
lormance. The aria in which she sang,
with a flute accompaniment, was exquis
itely renaereJ. There were a couple oi
minor roles satisfactorily taken by Grevin
and Lelong.
After the operetta tha audience had to
endure an almost interminable wait before
the curtain went up on the "Cavalleria
Rusticana." It would be hard to say why
the wait was infl.cted on the public, for
the settings of Maspagni's opera wen* of
such a meager description that the stage
could have been Â»et in a few minutes.
The overture to "La Cavcl'eria Rusti
cana" was brilliantly played under the
direction of M. Nicosias, and Massart
sang the incidental tenor aria well. Ail
through the opera the orchestra did ex
ceptionally good wort, and it goes with
out saying that the intermezzo was en
cored, for to encore the intermezzo has
become a tradition.
Mme. Foedor, the Santuzza, sang well
and occasionally grew tragic in her act
ine, but she was not so impressive as two
other Sar.tuzzas who have been heard here.
Emma Juck was altogether more artistic
in her conception of the role and Thea
Djrre was more powerfully dramatic.
Although Foeuor acted well she did not
seem able to s-hake off entirely the tradi
tions of the older school in which the
singers never forget the hearers. The re
cital of her wrongs was addressed more to
the house than to Mamma Lucia, and
some of her pleadings w;th Turndu were
addressed almost as much to the specta
tors as to the recreant lover. Foedor sang
well, however, and in some parts of her
role she acted very artistically.
The dramatic music of Turridu's role
suited Massart excellently, but he was
not dramatic enough in his acting. Henri
Albers, the silver- voiced baryione, made
a brilliant success of the thankless role of
Airio, and Andree Savine was a charm
ingly coquettish Lola. Fremeau was a
good Lucia, and the mixed choruses were
sung with a splendid volume of voice.
The following artists will appear in "La
Juive" on Saturday: Messieurs Prevost,
Aibers, Deo, Freiche, Chateau, Ritly ; Mcs
dames Foedor, Berthet, riori-, EcK.
GRIEVANCES OF LABOR.
Too Many Non- Union Men Work
ing on the Big Public
Buildings.
The Boulevard Committee Condemned
for Underpaying for the Work
on the Ro id.
Tbe committee appointed by the Build
ing Trades Council to investigate the
â work being done on public buildings pre
sented its report at iast evening's meeting,
which in substance was as follows:'
William Stiles of the International
Bricklayers' Union, which is not affiliated
with the local union, has the brickwork
on tbe new Hall of Justice on Kearny
and AYashington streets.
He will hire all of his bricklayers and
hodcarriers outside of the local unions.
A visit was made upon Supervisor Shee
lian of the Public Buildings Committee.
He promised to do all in his power to
hnve the contractors on|the Hall of Justice
hire union men.
Secretary Smith of the Rae Building
and Contracting Company at work on the
Affiliated Colleges and Mission Higfl
School, explained that he had no desire
to dispose of the union men; in fact, he
preferred their services, but circumstances
and friends had compeJled him to take on
non-union laborers to run wheelbarrows.
He desires, i.owever, to have all union
men in his employ.;
The committee saw Chairman Burns of
the Buildings and Grounds Committee of
the Board of Education in retard to the
High School job. He promised to do all
in his power to straighten out any diffi
culties between the union and the con
i tractors and to see that the men work only
| eighi hours a day.
The committee, with a member of the
Marble-cutters' and Finishers' Union,
called upon the Supervisors relative 10 the
matter cf the maible worn in the City
Hail tower.
The meeting was very unsatisfactory, as
tbe City Hall Commissioners state that
they are satisfied with the reports of the
superintendent and architect, and advised
tue complainants to make sworn state
ments as to the work complained of.
However, tbe Commissioner! promised to
look over the work as soon as the Mayor
cÂ»n meet with the others.
A conference will be held between La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald and Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald relative toenforo

ing the eight-hour law on all work on
public buildings. This ended the report.
A resolution was passed by the council
condemning the boulevard committee for
compelling the unemployed to labor for a
dollar a day.
The reason given was that such an
action would reduce the standard of ail
labor and lower the already too low rate
of wages. Several delegates asserted that
the boulevard will be of no use to any but
the wealthy, who can ride thereon. The
work to be done should be performed in
the public parks, where the laboring classes
would receive the benefit.

CHARGED WITH CRUELTY
Patrick Furlong Under Arrest
for Torturing a Bull
do^.
L^ft to Die by Slow Degrees, but
Finally Bâ¢â  (en to D ath
With C nbs.
One of the ni^st vicious cases of cruelty
to animals, if true as charged, ever pre
sented to the attention of the local society
(or the prevention of such acts resulted
yesterday in the arrest of Patrick Fur
long, proprietor of the "Irish Tavern," on
I street, between Ninth and Tenth ave
nues, south of the park. The arrest was
made by Officers Hooper and McCurrie of
the society, on tbe sworn complaint of R.
A. Tuttle, a commercial traveler, who
lives in that vicinity.
In his complaint Tuttle alleges that last
Sunday Furlong took a bulldog that came
from a contractor's camp near by and was
in the habit of hanging round hi 3 place,
tied it to a fence across the way and pro
ceeded to empty his revolver into the poor
brute.
While doing so, Tuttle alleges, he would
give vent to such expressions as "Now,
watch me hit him in the heaii," "See a
piece fly from his ear," ''Wonder if I can't
break a bind le^ ? '
Each shot that took effect caused the
poor beast to jump and tug frantically at
the rope, moaning and howling pitifully
the while. So horrible was the s-pectacle
that Tuttle's wife, w o happened to see it,
was overcome by the shock and fainted.
After emptying his revolver and failing
to kill the dog, though he inflicted several
wounds, the complaint alleges that Fur
long left it in agony and went into his
saloon. Shortly afterward a number of
men from the contractor's camp came
along with clubs and literally beat the
tormented doe to deatn.
Furlong admitted the act of cruelty to
the arresting officers, but claimed that the
dog was vicious and better off out of the
way.

"Alpha Beta." Yet it was not. long ere
both of these had fallen from : their high
estate, the one being known far and wide
as "The Goat and the Compasses," with a
prancing beast and mathematical instru-

An exceedingly popular hostelry at a

Boulogne Mouth in honor of a British
victory gained at the mouth of Boulogne
harbor in the reign of Henry VIII, but
the waterscape or battle scene having
after awhile become effaced by time and
weatber from the signboard some stupid
honiface thought he was doing the proper
thing when he nad painted on enormous
mouth with a jocose little bull beneath.
From that day on ihe place figured as the
Bull's Mouth.
The time was when artists of note
scorned not to try their 'prentice hand at
the painting of si.'ns, and many a Royal
Academician gave the public a lion or a
unicorn, a magpie or a cockatrice, the last
fabulous animal, suppo^d to have been
hatched from a cock's egg by a toa<l, being
for some unknown reason quite a favorite,
and represented as a serpent with a
rooster's head. Among these painters
wero Charles Calton, one of the original
Royal Academician;); Samuel Wade, who
delighted in figures of Falstaff and other
Shakespeprian characters; Hogarth and
Richard Wilson; while the vintner's inn

HITMAN NATUKE.
Several Phases Illustrated by an Inci
dent In an lowa Town.
From Council Bluffs, lowa, comes a
story that illustrates several phases of
human nature. In that city, the other
day, a man who is very poor and who is
likeiy to remain so, owing to the fact that
an accident has deprived him of both his
arms, found a large roll of greenbacks.
The money lay in a gutter and the tinder
could almost bear it beg him to pick it up.
This, on account of his misfortune, he
could not do, so he quietly kicked the
treasure into the shadow of a building and
tried to think out a safe method of trai.s
lerring it to his lamentably empty pocket.
Possibly a deduction as to Western
views regarding property rights might be
drawn by a cynic from the circumstance
that the man does not se*m to have
thought of returning the money to its
owner, through the police or o;h rwise,
wnile he declared afterward that he did
not ask the assistance of any one of sev
eral persons who paseea by for fear lest
the stranger should rescue the money for
liiinself and not for the helpless discov
erer. At last a small bootblack sauntered
by. and the man concluded to take
chance?. With a fine pretense of having
just dropped the b 11s, the man gruffly or
dered the youngster to assist him. The
boy comprehended the situation at a
glance, seized the little fortune, took to
his heels, and, easily distancing hi* angry
pursuer, vanished lermatienily lrom the
scene. â New York Times.

St. Peter's Church to Be
Reopened for Ssr
vice.
The M sses Will Be Specially
Interesting on Sunday
Next.
CLurcb. Has B'en Entire y Raoovated
anl Presents a Most Beauti
ful Appearance.
Sunday will see the reopening of St
Peter's Church, on Alabama street, be
tween Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth.
The stiucture has been closed while ex
terior alterations were being made.
The decorations follow tne style of the
groined arches of the (atliedral of Milan,
Italy. The architecture of the church is
VIEW OF THE INTERIOR.
German Gothic, the lines being very
graceful.
The tree â  rcc naves are painted in imita
tion of carved stucco work, an ornamenta-
tion of graceful forms painted so as to ap
pear really carved. There will not be a
square foot of the immense surface re
maining plain.
Such ornamentation, multiplied by the
succession of archivoits, produces the
effect that white lace does against a dark
background. The background of this
tracing is of the traditional Gothic â blue,
while the ornaments are of a warm stucco
color. Above the sanctuary the back
ground will be in gilt instead of blue.
A hoiizontal molding, partly in relief
and partly painted, ties alt the capitals
and separates the side-windows from tho
arch below, thus forming a series of
triangles. In each one of these a "tri
lobe" in relief has been set to receive
portraits of saints painted on a gold
ground. These were executed in Rome.
There are twenty-eitrht of them, and
they embrace the following: St. Anne,
mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary; St.
Joachim, her father; St. John the Baptist;
St. Paul thÂ« Apostle, St. Mary Magdalen;
St. Luke, St. Mark, St. Agnes, St. Cecelia,
St. Theresa, St. Gertrude, St. Rose of Lima,
St. Aloysius, St. Elizabeth, Si. Augustine,
St. Angela, Bt. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ber
nard, St. Emectius, St. Vincent de Paul,
St. Patrick, St. Bridget, St. Lawrence
O'Toole, St. Finbar, St. Malachy, St. Jar
lath, St. Columcilla and St. Cormac.
A vide border in Gothic colors will run
the whole length of the vi.urcb at the
same level of the capitals. Tha main
feature or the mural decorations will be
in the sanctuary. Above the three win
dows will be painted a ribbon, following
the form of the tops of the windows and
ending at each side with Hying tips.
There are biblical quotations in gilt let
ters on these ribbous. The window-sills
are richly decorated. Under the sills is a
border five feet wide in imitation of relief.
In thin border there are twelve Gothic
forms, containing the portraits of the
twelve apostles, painted on a gold ground.
On each side of the altar will be full
size i portraits of St. Peter and tit. Joseph.
The main aliar is done in white and cold.
The woodwork of the interior will be
entirely revarnished, making the whole
interior new:
The services for Sunday will be as fol

There were six special trnins started. One of

others were composed of Pullmans. Of the

Will Folcw
The adjourned meeting of the stock
nol iers of the Hale & Noroross Silver
Mining Company for the election of a new
board of directors was held yesterday
afternoon in room 11 of the Stock Ex
chanpe building. It was largely attended
and 88,966 shares of stock were repre
sented. Of this amount 56,241 shares were
represented by the stock itself and the
balance by proxies.
The total amount of sU-ck of the com
pany is 112,000 shares. Therefore, 56.001
shares compose a majority, and more than
a majority were thus voted.
At the meeting hold the day before there
was not a majority of the stock itself rep
resented, ana the president, M. W. Fox,
adjourned the meeting without day.
The stockholders, however, refusing to
abide by this decision, reconvened with
G. W. Gray son in the chair and adjourned
over until yesterday. In the meantime
the additional stock to the amount named;
comprising more ' ! than a majority, was
secured, the election held and a new board
was named and chosen without contest as

Municipal Time at Glasgow.
One of the most interesting of Glasgow
enterprises is what may be described as
municipal time for the entire city. Some
i years ago the experiment was tried of
placing municipal clock 3in prominent
positions all over Glasgow and regulating
them by synchronization. The present
scheme is much more elaborate, "and is
nothing less than the establishment of a
system of standard time by means of
electrically controlled clocks regulated
every second from the stellar clock at the
observatory. A regulating clock:, di
rectly conirolled from the observatory,
has been placed in the city chambers, and
j tiiis in turn controls three circuits of pub
lic clocks at various points in the city. In
the meantime, only about a dozen clocks
have been provided ; but if the trial proves
successful the corporation intends to erect
from 200 to 300 eishteen-inch dials, thus
providing a reliable system of standard
time for ail parts of the city. This exten
sion of the circuit will involve the laying
of sixty-one miles of wire. It is hoped,
also, to include timekeeping in private
houses.â Westminster Gazette.

BROKE UP IN
A BIG ROW
Mrs. Cohen's Penny Pur
chasing Clubs Suddenly
Suspend.
A Number of Angry Investors
Threaten to Do Her
Bodily Harm.
The Meeting Adjourned by a -qu c!
of Police Turn ing off All cf
the L : ghts
/
There was a lively row in the Zlnkand
building last evening, caused by the fail
ure of Mrs. Cohen's Penny Purchasing
Club.
Nearly 500 irate women and a dozen
men had possession of the premises, and
Mrs. Cohen would no doubt have fared
badly had not Sergeant James Donovan
and a squad of officers arrived on the
scene. The lights on the second floor
were put out and the angry investors were
driven to the sidewalk.
Mrs. Cohen's plan of operation was sim
ilar to that of like institutions. Drawings
were held in seven clubs of 100 members
each every Saturday night, and the lucky
ones secured the $25 cards or tickets. All
of the others paid at the rate of a penny
for each number of the ticket drawn.
Many were out $25 and $30. The iucky
winners were given orders for goods to
ihe value of $25.
A few days ago Mrs. Cohen sent out
notices to her 700 patrons who live in Ban
Francisco, Oakland and Alameda, notify
ing them that tuere was no more money
in the fund, and if they would meet her
last evening she would make arrange
ments to reimburse all who were out of
pocket.
They were all present, and as the meet
ing progressed matters became decide ily
tropical, until it was necessary to call the
police.
Mmy of the most angry women wanted
a en-nee to do Mrs. Cohen bodih' harm,
and then it was that tbe police adjourned
the meeting by turning off the lights and
running the investors into the street.
Mrs. Cohen did not dare to face the
crowd, so with the aid of a special police
man she escaped into Stevenson street.
The watchman took her into the base
ment and got her out vn the back street
by way of the sidewalk elevator.
It was not until the crowd on Market
street heard of her escape that it dis
persed.
Before doing so a committee of five was
appointed to hire a ball when plans for
future action will be discussed. The meet
ing will t>e held on Monday evening.
Soimt New Things.
A new razor-strop rolls up on a spring
drum when not in use and can be screwed
to the under side of a shelf or stand out of
the way.
Interchangeable slats for blinds or shut
ters are fastened 10 the side'of the blind
by a plaie held by screws, so that it can
be easily removed when the slat is broken.
Remarkable strainers for discliarge
spouts in wash-babitis, etc.. rest on a fl.tnge
in the pipe, ana can be pulied out when
the pi{>e becomes clogged by means of a
knob placed in the center of tbe plate.
A recently designed "hog catcher" for
use in slaUEUter-hou>es consists of a num
ber of curved steel bars so arranged as to
automatically grip ihe hog around the
body and throw him on his side by the
action of levers. The catcher then raises
the nog to the operating table and holds
it fast until it is killed.
To facilitate the rapid slicing of bread
a recently patented bread-box is fitted with
an automatic step-by-slep feeder, operated
by the action of turning the cutter blade
around by the crank attached thereto,
the blade increasing in diameter to a cer
tain point, when it aeain decreases in time
to allow the loaf to slide forward for cut
ting the next slice.

CALIFORNIA PROMISED AN ABUNDANT HARVEST
Reports Received by " The Call " From Many Counties of the State Indicate an
Unprecedented Yield of Fruit and Grainâ lncreased Acreage
Planted for This Year's Reaping*
There is every Indication that the farmers and fruit-growers of California will be
most amply repaid for their labors in plantin and cultivating the crop for this season
and that they will reap a most abundant harve3t.
A protracted cold spell has been beneficial to both fruits and cereals, and if the
weather continues favorable to the farming and horticultural industries Californians
engaged In these pursuits will be greatly enriched.
The Call has canvassed the State thoroughly in regard to the forthcoming crops
of grain and fruit and tbe result is most gratifying.
There are a few counties in which the rains have set b*ck growth, but a few days
of sunny weather may make these all right.
The Call recently sent out to its correspondents in various towns and counties of
the State the following letter:
"Please forward to The Call by fast mail after receipt of this letter a careful esti
mate of thn prospects of the grain and frirt crops.
"Give the probable yield of wheat, barley and hay, and state whether the fruit
promises to b\ of good quality or otherwise.
"If frcst should intervene before the receipt of this letter tell what its efiect is likely
to be. In short, endeavor to give In a few words an intelligent idea of the outlook, so
f at when the reports from oil sections are g- thered and published in The Call the
result will be of real value to al! interested in the prosperity of the State."
In response to this lettei The Call representatives in the various counties lnter
â  viewed the authorities on grain and fruit crops, and from the information each corre
spondent received from the best posted men on these subjects he based a prediction
as to the outcome 01 the comiiisr harvest.
It will be gratifying to Californians to note that a greater acreage has been
planted in grain. The grain production of the State, except in a few counties, has for
years been unequal to the consumption, and it has been necessary for Californians to
import cereals from the grain-growing fields beyond the Rocky Mountains. This
detriment to the prosperity of husbandry promises to soon be overcome. In one
county alone, as the reports published below show, 3000 additional acres were planted
in grain this year.
All the orchardists have to fear is a late frost. The fruit trees at the present are
in excellent condition. Cold weather has kept them back from bursting into bloom
too early in the season, and t:;ey are now hardy and strong; and givo a promise of an
abundant yield.
With the prospect of an excellent crop and good prices for their products, the
farmers and fruit-growers of California have a bright prospect before them this
present season.
The statement of the local weather office regarding the rainfall, and reports from
correspondents of many counties in Cali.ornia, are given below.

BUTTE COUNTY.
CHICO, March 18.â The prospects of the
present ernin crop, especially wheat, is
not at all flattering in this vicinity. The
greater portion of our grain lands is
adobe, and continuous rains through Jan
nary, February and in the first part of
March, combined with the cold and frost,
have played sad havoc withall tljesummer
fallow and early winter grain sown.
That which was not drowned was decayed
before sprouting. Some of the late winter
sown grain may yield the average annual
crop if the weather remains favorable, but
oven with this there will be only from a
third to a half crop, or from only six to
eight bags yield per acre.
Many of the farmers are now sowing
what ground that could not be put to
wheat to barley, and indications tend to
show a favorable yield of barley as the
weather has turned very favorable.
It is now thought that there will be a
heavy cut of hay this season, as some
lands are foul, as they were last year.
As to the outlook for an abundant yiel.l
of fruit it was never better than at present.
Tlie low temperature during January and
February retarded ihe advancement of
tne fruit-buds by at least tliree or four
week*, but tlie present warm weather lias
brought the trees out beautifully with
well-matured capules. The a mond, apri
cot anil plum trees are heavily laden, and
fchonld there be no frost of any severity
within the next few weeks there will be
an enoimous crop of inte fruit.
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
MUKPHYS, Cal., March 18.â Owing to
the high altitude the fruit trees of this
section have not as yet bloomed and the
buds are barely swelling. A few almonds
have put forth their blossoms, but they
invariably fall before the frosts. It would
be a safe prediction to say that if by the
cold weather the b.ossoms are beld back
for eight or ten days yet there will be a
good crop in this section the coming sea
son.
Growing grain is in a fair condition. It
is well-rooted and of trcod color. This in
dicates a good yield. The acreage to
grain is somewhat larger lhan usual
owing to the clearing and sowing of new
ground m different ranc.ies. Wheat, bar
ley and oats are all cut and cured for hay
in thi-< precinct, it bein<r essentially a
teaming community. There are hun
dreds of mules an>J horses used hi- re
which are to be fÂ«"< from D-cember io May
of each year. Hay ranges from $16 to
Â£20 per ton.
COLU3A COUNTY.
ji,COLUSA, Cai-., Marcli 18.â Never in the
history of Colusa County has the prospects
f' r a larce grain crop been more Hatter
ing. In the first place a third more acreage
has been put in grain than has been
planted for several years. Large tracts of
land had been summer-fallowed, and
plowing this was so delayed by the winter
rains, and had to be done for the spring
sowing. Farmers have sowed a large
acreage within the past three weeks, and
are still planting in some portions of the
county.
Piantinar of wheat was greatly encour
aged by t:ie good price that prevailed dur
ing the past season. Barley has been
largely planted, and hay will be bountiful.
All these are doiner finely, and the pros
pects for a heavy crop are even be Uer than
they were a week ago.
The frnit crop has every prospect of
being a heavy one. Frost lias done no
inj-.ir>% and the trees are literally ioaaed
with buds and b.ossoms. Those orchards
around Colusa are particularly tine.
From Williams, Arbnckle and College
City the report is that a fourth more cram
than ever before will be gathered and a
third more of orcnard product?. The
rai-in raisers of the Arbuckle and College
City localities are making preparations to
handle a large crop. The Maxwell dis
trict reports the best* of grain prospects,
and the outlook for the whole county is
cheering. The rains have ceased and the
sunshine is bringine life into vegetation.
EL DORADO COUNTY.
GEORGETOWN, Cal., March 18 â Iv
the section known as the Georgetown
Divide, lying between the middle and
south forks of the American fliver. El
Dorado County, very little grnin is raised,
except that which is cut for hay, of which
a considerable amounl is harvested each
year.
About the average acreage was sown
during the past fall and early winter, and
the climat:c conditions to the present
time point to the average yield. It is a
little early as yet at this attitude (2700
feet) to predict with any certainty wnat
ihe yield will be, as much depends upon
the later rains, which in this locality usu
ally continue through the month of April,
and even into May.
The cold weather now prevailing and
the recent fall of snow, which reached a
depth of sixteen inches, r,as had a ten
dency to check the swelling of fruit buds,
and present indications point to a favora
be season for all varieties. fc-houla Inte
frosts not prevail the yield of all kinds of
fruit will be heavy, as most var c ies have
had a rest since the season of 1895 owing
to the disastrous late frosts last year.
HUMBOLDT COUNTY.
EUREKA, Cal., March 18.â There is
every indication that the fruit and grain
crop in this county will be fully up to if
not above the averagu yield.
From statist*cj prepared by the secre
tary of the Humboldt Chamber of Com
merce it id estimated that the apple
product this year will reach 60,000 boxes;
product of dried fruit, about 100,000
pounds; grain, principally barley. 20,000
sacks.
Cold, rainy weather retards the budding
of fruit trees, which do not yet show signs
of lile. Last year the fruit trees blos
somed in February, and a stormy March
proved disastrous to fruit-growers.
The production of grain is gradually
decreasing, as farmers find dairying more
profitable, and aram lands are (being
rapidly turned into pastures.
KERN COUNTY.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., March 18.-The
prospect for a bountiful grain crop in
Kern County i flattering. Inquiry among
the larniers discloses the fact that it is
the most promising season for several
years vavt, and also that the acreage is
much larger than evir before.
A conservative esiimHte would place the
area sown at about 75 000 acres. A great
deal of this is on what is known at: dry
land, above irrigation, and this portion of
the crop is pnrticuiarlv tine, much of it
beint a ready in boot. "This is the results
oi the spiendid rains that have fallen in
this county during the present season.
The crop in estimated to be about two
weeks earlier than last season. The hay
crop is equally a-sunng.
Rfgaru'ing the fruit crop it is yet too
earW to speculate on its outlook. The
upricots and almonds arÂ« in full b!oom.
The other var'eties are still m their winter
state. The orchardists claim that the
blooming period is i wo weeks behind time.
LOS ANGELES COUNTY.
LOS ANGELES, (al., March 18.â Tlie
ab"ndanci of rain thronphont Southern
California dur ng the season has fallen at
?uch opportune intervals that none of it
has been wasted. In conaequence, the
ground is moistened to a treat depth,
assuring tine pasturage d urine tne sum hut

Mo batter opportunity was ever offered
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1897.
the farmer for making sowings of immense
acreage to wheat and barley. Tbe oppor
tunity has been well improved with, the
result that a far larger area than ever
before has been put to the-e cereals. The
ratio of increased acreage being as 2 to 1
in favor of wheat.
Antelope Valley supplies an exception
to this rule; for want of seed wheat, tbe
acreage has been greatly reduced. Tile
farmers of San Fernando and Simi valley,
the two sections of this couniy where
wheat is exclusively grown, have about
doubled their acreage. The yield promises
to be the greatest ever known.
The unusually cold weather during
March has retarded the bloom on apricot
tn-es, which are now full of bloÃSoros with
assurances of a full crop. The peach crop
is equally promising. And, although the
soason storage crop has just been moved,
an abundance of bloom gives assurance of
a large early crop for next year. A hail
storm of great severity to-day in the
neighborhood of Whittier is said to have
injured the apricot crop of that locality.
Linnets have done trreat lamage to the
almond crop in Antelope Valley, and still

the yield will be far larger than ever
before.
Alfalfa is the most luxuriant and
abundant ever known in the history of the
county.
POMONA, Cal., March 18.â Never in
the history of Pomona Valley has there
been such promise of abundant crops of
grain and fruit at at present. A common
remark here now is mat this winter sea
son has been most favorable in rain, sun
siiineand freedom from blighting frosts
ever known in this locality. The only
danger that may come now to the agricul
tural productions of Pomona Valley this
year will be frost at about the time of the
blossoming of prune, peach, pear, olive
and orarnre trees, but there is little or no
thought of probability of that now.
Conservative estimated nut the quantity
of apricot? that will be grown in Pomona
Valinv In 1897 at 3000 tons. The same au
thorities believe that about 2200 tons of
prunes wili be produced in Pomona Val
ley ; also about 1800 tons of peaches.
There is no estimate obtainable yet as
to the quantity oi the wheat and barley
crops in Pomona Valley, for the grain i?
markete l at different points and it is hard
to get satisfactory estimates.
PASADENA, Cal., March 18.â The
general outlook for the production of hay,
grain and fruit in Southern California and
this locality for 1897 has never been ex
celled In the recollection of the olde-t in
habitant Early warm rains induced the
farmers to plow and plant early, and itÂ«
result is a great acreage planted to wheat,
oats, rye and barley. ' The bay and grain
crop wi.l be enormous and native grasses
abumiant.
Orange and deciduous fruit trees are
now putting forth tboir spring erowtb,
they not having been in the least injured
by a slight frost of two weeks ago. The
yieid of apricots, peaches, prunes and
oranges this coming year is now beyond
calculation, b aciiberries, strawberrieÃ
and other small fruits give evidence now
of great thrift.
Generally indications are good for a
most wonderful yield of everything in the
way of grata, frnits and vegetables.
MADERA COUNTY.
MADERA, Cal., March 18.â The grain
crops throughout Madeta County never
looked more promising at this season of
the year than now. The good price paid
last year has stimulated production, and
this year the acreage exceeds by a third
that of any former year, the increase being
principally in w eat.
The cool weather has had a tendency to
dieck the growth, but with the great
amount of m isture in the ground and a
few warm dayÃ, wh eh are sure to come,
this is not looked upon with any degree of
alarm.
The outlook for fruits of all kinds is
most promising. It is not thought that
the recent froÂ«tÂ» hÂ«ve affected anything,
unless it is the almonds, of which but few
are prown here.
Farmers and fruit-growers all express
the opinion that no more favorable season
has been seen here in many year-.
MENDOCINO COUNTY.
UKIAH, March 18 âThe consensus of
opinion among agriculturists and fruit
growers of this county is to the effect that
the present year will be very favorable to
those industries.
Over 36 inches of rain has fallen this
season and feed is excellent. The late
cold storms were very severe on young
si.ick, however, and the season is back
ward. Hop-growers are very sanguine
over the outlook for beer blossoms. The
surplus held over is very small, which
means good prices for this year's crops.
The late frosts have slightly injured
early peaches, but otherwise fruit pros
pects are excellent.
The area to be sown to cram this year
will be greater than usual. All things
considered the outlook is for â¢ very pros*
perous year.
The rainfall during the season of 1896
wa* 4126 inches. For this season thus far
it has been 36 43 inches. Tho average
rainfall for the last twenty years has been
35.18 inches.
MARIN COUNTY.
BAN RAFAEL, Cal, March 18.â In
cereals ami hay Marin County cuts no fig
ure in tab cm of export. The cattle on her
hills take all she raises, and it goes to
market only in cubes ot butter and cans
ol milk. Her wheat and barley fields are
all cut for hay, except a very little which
is threshed for home use. Indeed, the
county draws largely from the outside,
not only for grain but for hay, Sonoma,
Soiano and the San Joaquin Valley con
tributing to its supply.
The amount of the home product this
season is iv doubt. Rain and frost con
tinued through February and created an
ticipations of a splendid yield, but when
the wet and cold lasted through a tnird
of March it was too late to pet in seed in
low land, and a shadow fell upon the pros
pect. On high ground the roots ar<* stur
dy, and average weather for six weeks to
come will bring fort a splendid growth.
We look for an average growth but no
more.
Much the same conditions prevail in
fruit culture. It was thought that Febru
ary s low temperature would bold back
the blossoms and save them from the
dreaded frosts which are liable to come in
April. But they have been so severe and
long-continued already that damage to
fruit has resulted, and Novato, which is
one of the great fruit centers, has dropped
her hopes of an extra yield of apples,
peaches, apricots, etc., and will be satis
fied with a moderate crop.
Exceptionally favorable weather from
this date may chan.e the outt omÂ» consid
erably, but at present no very flattering
prospect appears.
MERCED COUNTY.
MERCED, CaiÂ», March 18.â The oat
look for a particularly large wheat crop is
much more promising this year than for
many years past A large acreage has
been sown, and the weather so ar has
been in the highest degree favorable for
growing grain.
Experienced grain men decline at this
time to make an estimate of the probable
yield of cereals in the county, although it
is probably entirely safe to place it at at
least 20,000 toes in the vicinity of Merced.
The lruit promises a heavy crop of god
quality. The trees are now loaded down
with buds, but the birds are doing some
huvoc in the orchnnla.
NAPA COUNTY.
NA.PA, Cal., March 18.â The prospects
brighten for an abundani harvest of fruitÃ
and of cram. The farmers are rejoicing,
for the indications are that the harvest of
cereals and fruits will be larger this year
than it has been for many years.
The climatic conditions have been most
favorable. There has been no long and
severe storms and, on the other hand,
tnere has been no excessive droughts.
Last year there was much warm weather
during the month of February and this
caused the fruit buds to start. March was
cold and severe frosts fell. The buds were
injured and the fruit crop was materially
lessened. This year it has been to the con
trary. February and the early part of
March have been cold aad stormy. Be
cause of this the budding of ti;e fruit trees
is two weeks later. This has been of ma
terial advantage to the farmer, lor now no
danger from frosts is anticipated by any
one.
The indications are that the wheat crop
will be unusually large. The fields of
growing wheat have a good color and are
free from wads. Owing to tl c high prices
there is more acreage 01 wheat this year
than usual. The crops for baney and for
hay are also promising.
ST. HELENA, Cal., March 18. -As far
as can be ioid at tfce present dale the out-
Jook ior grain and fruit in this vicinity is
very encouraging. The yield of grain
promises to be very large and of the best
quality.
The fruit crop is expected to be large
and of good quality if late frost* do not
occur to damag- the bloss ins. The pre
vailing cold weath r i as a tendency to
deJay the blossoms from coming out so
early, and consequently lessens their lia
bility to be destroypd by the late frosis
should they occur. The almond blossoms
â re out, but it cannot be told if they have
been damaged by the frost until the buds
have formed.
ORANGE COUNTY.
SANTA ANA, March 18.â The outlook
for grain and iruit crops in Orange County
this year is better than for many years
past. The rainfall to date has been 11
inches, which was very evenly distributed
through all the months since November,
and in such mild showers that no damage
has resulted.
Over 50,000 acres of barley will be sown
in the county this year, tho yield from
which, at a conservative estimate, should
be 1,000.000 sacks. Several thousand acres
of wheat hiive also been sown..
The hay crop w;ll be very large, 20,000
tons being a low estimate of the yield.
While it is yet early to predict with any
degree of certainty upon the deciduous
fruit crop, from present indications it will
be the largest in the hi-tory of the county.
Apricots and peaches are already in
bloom, and there is now but little danger
from frost, from which the county has
escaped without injury thus far. Thou
sands of new walnut and orange tree-< are
coming into bearing, so that an eiiomiou
yield of i he c important crors is expected.
About 6000 acres will ba planted to sugar
bee>s in tne county this season, the prod
uct to be n-ea at the new sugar factory
now being completed at Alamitos.
PLACER COUNTY.
AUBURN, March 18.â The outlook for
the Piacer County farmer and fruit
grower at the present writing is most en
couraging.
Not in the past ten years has there been
as much grain sown. The usual amount
of summer-fallow hns been added to by
the sowing of an immense amount of new
acreage, stimulated no doubt by the infla
tion in the wheat market last mil. Fully
125,000 acres, mostly in wheat, has oeen
sown in tnis county, and nothing short of
severe nor h winds can avert a biz yield.
The fruit crop outlook is excellent. Last
year the warm wea her in February
broueht out the buds, and in consequence
the snowstorm in March killed many of
them. So far this reason nothing tias ai>
peared to give the lruit-grower any un
easiness. Although the weather has been
pleasant most of the time it has not been
warm enough to advance the buds, and as
the cold weather la past there is every in
dication of a bit crop all along the line,
with the possible exception of almonds,
and they are so few that they are of little
consequence.
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 18.â
The condition of the grain crop Is
good, as the soil was favorable to seeding,
owing to tbe ra n 3 having fallen
sufficiently to enable the planting. The
planting of grain wa-< from November 1,
1896, to January 1, 1897. but the average
date of planting was D cember 1. 1896
The present growth is healthy and in
except of the last two years and is what
would be considered a good stand. Wheat
will average eighteen bushels per acre,
which is above the average. Hay will
average two and a half tons to the acre
and barley will average from thirty to
thirty-rive bushels to the acre, barley
has been planted in an increase above the
average about 10 pet cent.
In regard to tbe fruit crop, it having had
plenty of rain, the indications are favorable
for alargeyi-ld. But owing to the weather
having been cool the fruit bmls have been
neld back. Bin warm rains and plenty of
sunshine will insure an extra good crop
for this season.
SAN MATEO COUNTY.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal.. March 18.â The
outlook for a prosperous farming season
throughout San Mateo County was never
brighter than at the present time, and un
less something unforeseen intervenes be
tween now and the farming season proper
the farmers will realize an abundant
harvest.
The prospects for a large crop of hay
and grain are even better than tnat of last
year. The heavy rains which we have ex
erienced of late hay had rather a bene
ficial than an evil effect, except in the
very low lands, where the crops have been
urowned out, and in those places it will
probably be necessary to sow tfiem again.
The fruit crop ts nardly far enough ad
vanced to say definitely as to the possible
yield. On some of the trees of the late
yielding fruits there are as yet no signs of
Duds, while on the earlier iruit trees buds
have already appeared. Though the frosts
have not been sufficiently severe to cause
much damage, yet there are places where
It* effects have been felt.
Unless we have heavy frosts later in the
season it is sale to say that the crop will be
much larger than mat of last year.
iIENLO PARK, March 18.â The out
look ior an abundant harvest in this val
ley is not very promising. In the low
lands t. c r cent heavy rains have washed
out the growin grain, while on the foot
hills crops havo not thai healthy appear
ance usually seen at iiiis time of the year.
â \Yarm weather and late showers will
help the growing grain very maierially,
but even with these influences the farmers
do not expect an average yield. The Hes
sian fly i. as made its appearance here for
the lust three years and destroys the wheat
stalks and makes the raising of wheat al
most impossible. Barley is also attacked
by this insect and while it is not so severe
as on wheat the yield will not any more
than satisiy home consumption.
The prospects for a heavy iruit crop are
goou, and if late frosts do not appear the
yield will be larger than in any previous
year.
SANTA CLARA COUNTY.
GILROY, Cal., March 18.â Fruit pros
pects were never more promising than
at present in the history of tbe valley.
The present frosty mornings check the
early blossoming of buds, though apricots
and almonds are in full bloom.
The gram is up and a beautiful crop is
expected by the farmers. Barley is the
principal crop here. The late heavy rains
did slight damage to grain on low places.
The acreage planted to fruit and vines
has been increased the past season, ana
many new orchards will bear their first
fruit.
The rainfall to the present date is 18.26
inches, and a month of sunshineisall that
is needed to make this the banner year for
crops of all kinds.
SAN DIEGO COUNTY.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 18 âShould
no unforseen disaster occur within the
next three weeks the season of 1896-97 will
pass into history as the most lavorable,
agriculturally speaking, within recent
years in not only the San Diego Bay
region but throughout the 4000 square
miles of arable territory in this county.
There have been no frosts of consequence.
Pasturage was never so eood before and
the cattle and sheep are uniformly sleek
and fat. Most of the grain area lies in
Santa Maria, Escondldo and aajacent val
leys ana on the lower mesas.
The acreage which will be harvested for
grp.in this year is roughly estimated at
25,0u0 acresâ Â£o per cent over any pre
v.ous year â 15,000 acres in barley, esti
mated to yield 17 sacks per acre, and 10,
--000 acres in wheat to yield 11 sacks aver
age, making a total of 255,000 sacks of
barley and 110,000 sacks of wheat. This
is at lenst a 50 per cent greater yield than
this couniy ha* ever bad before.
Almost all g. am rai ed in the bay region
will be cut as usual for hay, and the crop
will be phenomenal. New hay is already
coming in. San Diego and Escondldo
this season will ship a total of 100 cars of
oranges and 325 cars of lemons approxi
mate.yâaboui 40 per cent greater" t an
any previous year. Some aprico. trees are
already in bloom and the deciduous fruit
Hnd raisin ou look was never more prom
ising. Tbe apple crop of the Julian belt
is estimated at 100.000 boxes.
SOLANO COUNTY.
BENICIA. Cal., March 18.â The long
continueu cold weather this year has had
the effect of retarding all kinds of crops,
both cereal ana iruit.
A large portion of the low lands will be
very Jate in its yield. Benicia district will
nave about ihe same acreage this year as
last, but the crop has been planter for
grain instead of buy. At least o^e-fourth
ul the land will be in wheat and about
one-fifth in barley, leaving about onp-ri.m
in hay. The Daiance is pasture lÃnd and
orchards. Some of ihe almond orchards
wili be damaged by the frosts, but no
other Kind ol fruit nas been as yet, and if
we get no more frosm there will be more
than nn average crop of fruits, espec.ally
of grapes.
The iarmera and fruit men all anticipate
a R.'od crop.
SHASTA COUNTY.
ANDERSON, Cai,., March 18.â The
grain land in this territory comprises
about 2000 acres and is devoted principally
to the raising of hay, which is in greater
demand and commands better prices than
grain. The conditions are yery favorab
for a profitable yield.
Within the boundaries of the Reading
grant are the river or bottom lands wh.cn
are d voted to the raising of almonds,
French prunes, peacbe3 and | e;irs. Thesa
orchards are in small holdings, ranging
from :en to 250 acre Tacts and aggregate
abi'Ut 3000 acres. Never before have the
trees sei &o heavily in buds.
The uplands are devoted principally to
the raising of peaches and grapes, the
land being more adapted to these varieties
o! fruits than to any other kind. These
holdings run from 25 to 50 acres each and
aggregate about 20U0 acres. Two years
ago there was shipped from this town
about fifty cars of green and seventy-five
of dned fruit, valued at about $75 000.
Tnis ye-ir under lavorable circumatances
the f'uit crop will be from $125,000 to
$150,000.
SAN JOAQUiN COUNTY.
LODI, Cal,, March 18.â Prospects for
crops of all kinds were never better than
at present Both farmers and fruit
growers are rejoicing over the turn in af
fairs.
An unusually large acreage of wheat
and barley has been planted, anl the
crops are turning out almost beyond ex
pectation thus lar. Bora* complaint
comes from the black or adobe lands rs~
KioD, where rains kept the plowers off the
land of that particular formation.
The hay output will be enormous, judg
ing from the outlook now.
Fruit will be extremely plentiful. Dur
ing the past three years the crop has been
poor, but this year promises to outdo any
within recrnt times. Tho great LangforJ
Colony orchard men say that the fruit
crop there will be far heavier than in
any other year since the orchards were
planted. Peaches, almonds and cherries
are expected to give the greatest yields.
Apricots will do nothing exceptional. It
is too ear y yet to make an estimate re
garding grape*, figs and next orange crop,
but growers expect a yield.
Potato men have planted more than
ever before. Frost thus :ar has done no
harm, although it is of nightly occurrence.
SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 18 â
Everything indicates that the crops of
this county will be exceptionally large
and excellent. The rainfall for the sea
son now aggregates about 15 inches, and
has come in such gentie shower* that the
ground has received the fall beneh't of it.
The yield of alialfa and barley will be
enormous.
The prospects for deciduous fruits of all
kinds couid not be better. Apples, peaches,
figs, apnco.s, cherries, alinunds and nec
tarines all bid fair to bring excellent re
turns to the growers. Nurseryman report
large sales of stock and of toe best varie
ties ana growth. The fruit acreage of the
county will be greatly increased by this
year's planting. The Anglo-American
Canaigre Company is preparing 8000 acres
of land four miles irom this city for the
planting of canaigre. The slight Irosts in
ihis county have done no damage what
ever to fruit or crops.
SAN BENITO COUNTY.
HOLLISTER, Cal., March 18. â The
present season promises more favorable
crop prospects than have been presented
for twelve years. Rains came early, and
at such favorable intervals that crops were
seeded in good season. The area of r.ew
land seeded to wheat wiil exceed 3000
acies. Frost has not injured grain in any
way.
The probable yield of the county will be:
Wneat, 90,000 tons; bailey, 30,000 tons;
hay, 24,000 tons. Crops are growing vig
orously, and promise an abundant har
vest.
The fruit crop, without damaging frost 3,
will be exceedingly lar^e and ot good qual
ity. Two thousand acres of new orchard*
will come into bearing this year. They
are mostly in apricots and prunes. The
yield of the former will be immense. The
farmers of this county are well satisfied
with the outlook.
SISKIYOU COUNTY.
YREKA, Cal., March 18.â Crops will be
large and line this summer. More ground
has been plowed than ever before, es
pecially on the high and dry lands, owing
to the advantage of continued rains,
amounting to a total of nearly 17 inches,
which ib far above the average for the
winter months.
The fruit crop will also be better than
usual.
Frost has no effect on crops here until
after the last of April, our season for bud
ding of trees being about six weeks later
than in tne sea-level valleys.
SONOMA COUNTY.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., March 18.â ThÂ«
balmy weather of the past few days has
had a magical effect on vegetation of all
kinds. Buds and blooms are bursting
forth on all sides and waving fields of
grain are hastening on 10 luxurious ma
turity. The season is from two to four
weeks later than usual. The rainfall to
dale is 39.30 inches. Grain of all kinds
has a splendid stand. The growth has
been slow and steady, with, no heavy
frosts to check it. - Cloverdale Township
will this year proiuc Ã¼bout 6000 ions of
hay. No estimates can be gven on wheat
and barley, as there is very little thrashed
here.
Fruit buds have been held back, and as
the danger from heavy frosts is about
over the indications are very favorab c for
an enormous yield. Almonds ana early
peaches are past full bloom and the truit
is forming splendid y. Orange and lemon
trees are full of new buds as well a^ the
ripe fruit in many instances. Grapevines
arc vet in a dormant condition.
The prospe cts at this time for larger and
better crops of all kinds are more ;avorabla
than taey hay been in many years.
SEBAS'IOPOL, Cal., March 18 âThe
outlook lor hay and fruit in ail sections of
Analey Township is very encouraging.
The late heavy rain somewhat impeded
the growth of grain on low lanu, but
while tuecrop may be short it is of excel
lent quality and f irmers areaiready look
ing forward to $10 per ton for hay next
summer.
The fruit-growers of Analey Township
also fpel jubi.ant over ihe prospects be
fore them. There have been a lew severe
frosts in this section, but the effect has
not been serious, as the fruit buus are not
yet far enough advanced to be injured by
the cold spell.
PETALUMA, Cal., March 18.â Land
surrounding Petalurca is consideied too
valuable tor nay and grain crops entirely
and, owing to the lon^'-c urinued rain,
there has not been as much wheat or bar
ley aown ibis season as usual. Therewill be a heavier crop of hay than ordi
narily. - - â¢ â¢â â¢â -- â - - - â¢-â¢- -â -â 
The fruit crop is most promising. The
almond trees, always the first to blossom,
are now in bloom. The other fruit trees
have not shown leaf buds as yet, and ao
were uninjured by the frosts.
.TULARE COUNTY.
TULARE, Cal., March 18.â The pros
pects lor an aDundant crop of pram, hay
antf fruits never looked so promising as at
the present time. The most generous and
equally distributed rainfall for many
years makes a large crop an absolute cer
tainty.
To date 850 inches of rain has fallen,
and should we fail to get another drop we
would reap much more than an average
crop, fciid as for fruit â barring late frosts â
we shall have the largest yield in the his
tory of this county.
Occasional light frosts have fallen, but
bo far no damage ha* been done, and in
fact the continued cool weather is re
garded as favorable to the fruit. The
ground is thoroughly wet and a few warm
clays would cause all fruits and veeetaion
to grow very rapidly. Old residents of
Tulare declare tljev never saw such rich
promise of a bountiful harvest since 1884.
An immense acreage of wheat has been
sown, and without exception it all looks
well. The fruit yield ot 1897 will exreed
that ol any year since this became a fruit
} roducing section.
TEHAIYIA COUNTY.
K-ED BLUFF, Cal., March ISâ Grain
in 'iehama County never looted belter
"tiian it does at present ns a whole, though
some little grain on the bottom Has been
injured from 100 much moisture.
The area planted is slightly in excess of
recent years nnd the crop promises to
be heavier on au average. But little will
le cut for hay where the yield is lit to
make grain. But little barley has been
planted.
There is promise of an exceedingly
heavy crop of fruits. Almonds and ap;i
coifi are well formed. Peaches and prunes
are more backward. In iact, all fruu
treesare backward this season, and It i*
lot thought now that they will be in any
linger of frost. No frost has as yet
iffected them.
YUBA AND SUTTER.
MARYSVILLE. Cal., March 18âCare
ful inquiry regarding the probable yield
â of grain in Yuba and Sutter counties in
1897 develops the fact that for the first
time in many years a failure tnu-<t be re
corded. Owing to unusual ra;ns, which
extended into the sowing season, the acre
age given to cereals will be the smallest
lor many years.
Asyetihe outcome of the barley crop
is problematical. Should the latter part
of March bring a spell of clear weather
many acres will bo sown to barley with
Ihe prospects good for a very fair yield.
But the total yield of cereals will hardly
exceed 25 per cent of last year's crop. The
hay crop may lare better, but that, too,
wilf be short by about 50 per cent.
If there are no severe frosts the fruit
crop will be up to. the average and of fair
quality.
WHÂ£ATLAND, Cal., March 18.âPres
ent conditions are favorable lor the
fairaer. Hop men are busy plowing and
pruning. Yards are In good condition
and prospects are for the usual fui! crop.
Growing grain is in exceilent condition.
The wheat acreage will not be as large as
was expected, because it has been impos
sible for farmers to plow and sow during
the past six weeks.
The barley crop wil! be short.
A good fruit crop is indicated. The
almond trees are full of blossoms and
other fruit trees show plenty of buds.
YOLO COUNTY.
WINTERS, Cat.., March 18.â A very
large acreage of grain has been sown in
Yolo County and without exception
it is looking well. Fall-sown wheat
is in especially tine condition and
tire yield, with favorable weather for two
month?, is sure to be above the average.
Rain, however, has held some of the farm
era who are sowing spring grain back and
the yield may not be as good as it other
wise would. It is estimated, however,
that it will be fa" ahead of last year.
Hay, and in fact all held crops, in tnls
county promise more than an average
yif Id. Very little tillable land is idle, there
Deing a strong demand for every acre that
can be rented.
Except frosts intervene the fruit crop
will be heavy. Orchardists report that
t ho apricot and peach buds are not as
plentiful thi3 season as in other seasons,
but that insure* large fruit and good quali
ty. The pear crop will be heavy. Many new
orchards in the vicinity of Winters and
in the Oapay Valley are coming into bear
ing this season and Yolo County will have
rich returns from her fruit if prices are
fair.
Most of the pruning in the vicinity of
Winters is done aud many treei are in
b'ossom. Small fruit also promises well
nnJ, in all probability, will yield a good
crop. __^_____^__

Billy Magrane's 0 d Gelding
Baron Won at OJds of

Thorpe Got Billy Ayers Past the Wire
Firstâ M jor Cu< kls in Win
ning Form Again.
Horseracing was a secondary considera
tion at Emeryville yes'.erday. The re
turning pilgrims from Carson were be
sie ed on all sides with questions as to
whether the best man won, and for the
time being tips were away below par.
However, the ring managed now and
then to scare up a little excitement, man
aging to about make expenses.
The rain laid the dust, leaving the
track just a trifle slow. Favorites were
successful at three essays.
The longest priced winner of the after
noon was Billy Magrane's old gelding,
Baron. He was one of twelve starters in
the t ird event, a mile purse affair, and
backed from 10 to 7 to 1, fought it out all
the way with Una Colorado, another out
sider, eventually getting the verdict by a
head through "Skeets" Martin's superior
riding. Peter the Second, the G to 5 fa
voriie, got up in time to take the show.
The first race at five and a half furlongs
was split, the best of the sprinters going
to muke up the declared-oft fourth race.
Seven cheap "dogs" furnished the excite
ment. Zamloch, with sto 2 about him,
was made a slight choice over Sea Spray
and Blue Bell. Thorpe on Billy Ayer-, a
6 to 1 shot, took the lead from Blue Bell
before much of the ground had been cov
ered and hard ridden at the end, Charley
kept his mount in front long enough to
lead Sea Spray out a neck in I:lU*Â£.
The Burns & Waterbouse colt managed
to striKe another soft berth in .he s x
furlong telling sprint that followed, al
though Thorpe took matters eatily, and
hid to hustle h.s mount along at the end.
Tne colt was a 7 to 10 choice and won out
a head before St. Dntaff, against which
12 to 1 was laid. Rienzi, which lead to
the stretch, was third.
Taking the place of the declared-off
fourth race was a five and a half furlong
selling dash wit > Major Cook, Toano,
Candor, Miss Ross, Amelia Fonsu and S:r
R chard as starters Major Cook, with
Tod Sloan up, was made a;i S to 5 favorite
and experienced no dflkulty in winning
as he pieased from Candor, a 12 to 1
chance, ridden by Charley Thorpe. Ame
lia Fonso was third.
The crotchety and uncertain Joan upset
calculations In the seven-furlong run next
decided. Backed from sixes to 4to 1, she
passed both Apto and the even money
choice Grandezia in the run home, pass
ing the judges full seven lenctlis in frout
of the favorite. The heavily played
Claudiana came on at the end, securing
third money.
L.beral scratching reduced the number
of starters in the final six and a half fur
long sprint to seven. Backed from evens
down to 7 to 10, Applause always held her
field sale and won well in hand, two
lengths in advance of the sec nd choice,
Caliente. The poorly ridden Mldlo was
third.
NOTES.
H. Martin has signed a contract to ride
for Dave Gideon the coming season.
"Skeets" can outride and outfinish all
riders of the S.oan type, and ought to
make his mark in the East.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 19, 1897.
ride on the even-money favorite, Grande
zia. It may not have been the best ride
ever seen on a racecourse, but there have
been many others equally as bad if not
more gauzy that passed unnoticed. Take,
for instance, the exhibition furnished by
Slaughter astride M.dlo. That came in
for no judicial frown. The one is compar
atively a green boy in the saddle, while
Slaughter is accounted one of the crack
Western lightweights. Many \ other
"efforts" could be enumerated mat hud a
threadbare look, but the jockeys hud a
reputation, tue\r employers were men of
wealth and position and they were set
down as mistakes, possibly, or errors of
judgment. ,
On board the wrecked steamer Sunol
were two mares owned b/ B. C. Hollyâ
Melanie and May Elklns, which had been
bred to Libertine and were being returned
to Mr. Holly's Vallejo ranch. Melanie
was arowned, but the. less valuable of the
pair was picked up by a passing tug.
Pittsburg Phil was fortunate to pick
the last race one, two, and, as he backed
his opinion quite extensively, quit the day
a handsome winner.
Eddie Greany was about the tracK, and
some of the uppercuts he smote the air
in explaining to listening friends how
Fitz sent in that heart blow created a
draught through the grand stand.
The tip on Devault was a warm one,
causing his price to rapidly fall from 10 to
i. He showed speed, but was not ridden
to the best advantage by J. Shields.

ELUSIVE DEFENDANTS,
The Matthai Sitter*, !:<>Â«Â»â ; Â«ml Loulie,
Outwit Process-Servers.
Benjamin F. Bergin is having a hard
time cettine in his suit against Ross Mat
thai and Louise Matthai, who live at 3928
Seventeenth street, in this City.
Mr. Bergin demands $300 from the
ladies, but they refuse to pay, and when
he sent an officer to serve the summons
that functionary was informed that the
sisters Matthai were not at home.
Watching the premises day and night
did no good, lor when h.e was in front they
went out and in through the rear door,
and after he tooK up a position in the
ailey they used the lront door for egress
and ingress.
Another man was hired to assist, and
then the fair defendants avail"! them
selves of a side door. Hence Benjamin
despaired of obtaining personal service,
and bas applied for an order of court which
will permit him to make service by publi
cation.
THE SUNOL HEAR
THE MAIL DOCK.
She Was Towed There Last
Night by the Tug Red
mond.
It Was Impossible to Beach the
Steamer on the Mission Mud
Flats.
Reports H . ye It That all tbe Bu lion
Has Disappeared From tbe Iron
Tank-
Very little was done with the wrecked
steamer Sunol yesterday. During the
night she was towed to the Mail dock and
an attempt was made to put her alongside
the new wharf. A sandbank was in the
way, however, and the big stern-wheeler'd
hog chains and deckhouse caught and
there was no moving her. The officers of
the Pacific Mail Company were very an
gry over the matter yesterday as the City
of Sydney is to be moved from Lombard
street to the Mail dock to-day and the
Sunol, in a manner, blocks tbe way. With
a fair amount of care, however, the wort
of putting the Sydney into her berth should
not be a difficult one.
When it was found that the steamer
jvas afloat the tug Redmond was engaged
to tow her to the Mission mud flats. When
an attempt was made to beach her it was
iound that the tug was drawing too much
water and could not land the derelict high
and dry. An attempt was made to beach
her in China basin, but that also failed.
Finally the tug headed for the new ad
dition to the Mail dock and tbe bunol
went aground. Bhe could not be moved,
so the tug lelt her, and to-day the wrecker
Whitelaw will make an attempt to put
her on an even Keel.
During the day a direr was sent down to
put some chains in position in onier to
have everything in readiness lor work on
the morning tiue. White down he made
an examination of the bull, and the people
around the iuail dock and ti.o men on the
Whitelaw assert that according to his re
port all the contents of the iron tank was
gone, while the safe with the specie in it
was intact. It is said that there were 1500
lead bricks in the tank, all consigned to
the Selby Smelting Works, and each
brick was valued at $- ; 5.
When asked about the matter, A. Â£.
Pryor, general manager of the PipÂ«r-Aden-
Gondall Company, said:
"No one can fell what was lost or what
was saved. The diver was down to make
fast the tackle, but considering that the
water was very muddy he could not have
seen very much. The actual extent of the
loss wiii not te known until the Sunol is
on Â«n even keel."
The Grace Barton went out on the
Vallejo trip in piace of the Sunol and took
quite a number of passencers. Captain
Richardson went out as master, vice Cap
tain Dye, wiio will remain ashore in the
meantime. In his report to the Inspectors
of Hulls and Boilers Captain Dye states
that when he found the Olympic wascom
ine down on nim he put his helm hard
aport, but tnat the vessel would not
answer. Then he rang the signal for full
speed astern, but before ;lie Bunol could
gather sternway the Olympic crashed into
her.
All the members of the Piper-Aden-
Goudall Ccmpany are very grateful to tne
officers anu men of the revenue-cutter
i.'u-h. The captain of the cutler stood by
uuring the whole trouble and only lefl the
scene of the disaster when assured by
Harry Goodall that he could be of no more
as istaiice.
There was no insurance on the Sunol, so
the entire loss will fall on the owners.
They are not given to complainine, how
ever, and every one of them is making the
best of a bad case.
Luckily they purchased and practically
rebuilt the (Jr ice Barton a few months
ago, so that their business will not suffer
in the slightest.
AN ALASKAN EXPEDITION.
Fifty Men Who Will Again Tempt
Fortune In the Frozen North.
Another expedition into the wilds of
Alaska in search of wealth and fame is
being got ready. At the head of it is P.
Newman of Oakland and A. McNevin of
the McNevin Brothers' School of Naviga
tion in this City. The schooner Altair,
now in Oakland Creek, is to be purchased
und tbe membership is to be limited to
li.ty able-bodied men.
The conditions are that each man shall
put up $210 and in return he will be guar
anteed a trip to Alaska and back again
and six months' board and lodging. A
considerable quantity of trade articles will
be taken up anil money is expected to be
made iv that way. The schooner will first
of all go to Prince Williams Sound and all
who desire can land and will co prospect
ing. They will be well provisioned from
the general store and instructed aa to
when the Altairwill be back for them.
The schooner will proceed to Cooks In
let, and from thence on a trading cruise.
On the way oack the men nt Cooks Inlet
and Prince Williams Sound will be picked
up. On arriving here tbe vessel and trade
will be sold, and the proceeds divided pro
rata.
Tim promoters are most sanguine of the
success of the scheme, and one thing is
certain that any ons wt goes into it has
not much to lose, as he will get a trip to
Alaska and back and six months' board
and lodgings for the money named.
Two new ste.iners sailed from Washing
ton-street wharf yesterday afternoon.
Tue Humboidt left for Eureka at 2:30 p. m.
on her maiden trip, and at 5:05 p. H. was
off Point Reyes, a remarkably lino show
ing lor a new vessel.
Tue Grace Barton left at 4 p. m. for Val
lejo, and for a vessel that never had a trial
trip she did very well. Captain Richard
son took out the Barton, and Capiain
Bonifield the Hum bold r.
The barkentine Willie R. Hume, Cap
tain Brown, is now out tifty-three days
from Shanghai, and considerable anxiety
is felt over her non-arrival. Bhe is prob
ably delayed by the Head winds that have
blown steady lor several weeks.
The Harbor Commissioners received a
communication from the Postmaster-
General yesterday stating that Uncle
Sam would be willing to pay $9600 a year
for pontofilce facilities in the new terry
building. The work of constructing the
hydraulic appliances on the Second-street
bridge was let to the Vulcan Iron Works
for |1790. The execuuvo committee of
the Carnival of the Golden Gate asked for
space in the grain-sheds to build floats for
use in the procession on the bay. They
want the space from the last day of this
month until May 1. Th â¢ matter was re
lerred to the chief wharfinger.

WORKING FOR A CHARTER.
The Merchants' Association Pe
tition the Legislature and
Governor.
One Asked to Pass Senate Amend
ment No. 35 and the Other to Sign
Assembly Bill 983.
The Merchants' Association is bound
that San Francisco shall have a new char
ter, and the recent defeat at the polls has
served simply to make it more eager than
ever to make a charter that will contain
no objectionable features.
Accordingly the following communica
tions with regard to bills bearing UDon
the charter question were sent to the
Legislature and to Governor Budd:
Pan Francisco, Cal., March 17, 1897.
To the Honomb c Members of the Senate and
Assembly of the State of Californiaâ Gentlemen :
The Merchants' Association of Ban Francisco
earnestly requests your favorable action upon
Senate constitutional amendment 35, amend
ing article XI of the constitution of the Slate
by Adding a new section thereto to be known
as No. 5%, relating to consolidated city and
county governments.
' This amendment to the constitution is abso
lutely essen to the proper operation of the
government of Sin i anclsc . It will extri
cate this City from its dual capacity of. both a
City and a County. This uncertain condition
has confused the iaws governing this munici
pality, and unless thus altered will result in
serious complications.; r -:-' Â»- :<
Senate constitutional amendment 35 has
bad the unanimous indorsement of the Board
of Supervisors of this City and County as well
as of the Merchants' Association, and we sin
cerely hope that you will submit it to the
electors of the State. Very respect, ully yours,
. â  â¢, Merchants' Association.
"â¢-; â â  si 'l F. W. Dohkjiann, President. .
\ J. Richard Freud. Secretary.
/, San Francisco, Csl., Mfirch 18,1897.
"â  lion. James 11. Budd, Governor of the State cf
California, Sacrament), Cat.â Dear Sir: Assem
bly bill No. !â¢->;> as pasted by the Senate aud
Assembly is ot great importance to San Fran
cisco, li will materially lessen the otherwise
heavy expense of holding special elections to
elect boards of freeholders and to vote upon
proposed charters.;
San Francisco ims made four futile attempts
to secure a freeholders' charter uudur the pres
ent constitution of California. This experi
ence has cost the City about $100,000.
Within the next two years there will in all
probability be another special election for
freeholders and upon a City charter. This bill
will save much unnecessary expense to the
municipality. It has had the unanimous in
dorsement of the Board of Supervisors of this
City and County as well as the Merchants' As
sociation and we respectfully request that it
may receive your sanction and become a law.
Very truly yours, Merchants' Association.
PERFECTING MANY PLANS.
Carnival People Hard at Work Arrang

collegiate musical contest in the evening
at one of the theaters. The University

ized to receive tenders of bids from con
tractors for the exclusive privilege of
erecting the grand stands and tribunes on
the line of march oi parade--. Specifica

attention at present, and it is the best fea
tures of these maneuvers that are to be
presented during the carnival.

Delay Now and It May Cost You
Years of Suffering and Agony.
â â  The fame of the new Electro* Medical cure has spread all over the world like wild-

Many such have applied at the Institute and have been Riven immediate relief and
finally permanently cured. The reader may meet any number of these people who
have be-n restored to health by the new Electro-Medical cure after other treatments
had failed. These patients are the bent evidence of the beneficent work that is being
daily accomplished, and tne only thing that has given it the support of the medical

A DOCTOR'S ADVICE.
Under no circumstances should the Electro-Medical Cure be confounded with the ordinary
electric treatment as applied by common batteries or with such crude magnetic appliances as
electric belts and the like. The Electro-Medical Cure is different in fundamental principle,
different in application and different in effect. It is adapted to the old and the young, the
nervous, bilious, lymphatic ; in fact, to each and every condition of the human system. By
this discovery medicine is not distributed indiscriminately throughout the system, but is
passed directly to the diseased parts. -
The expense of static batteries and more advanced delicate and costly electrical mechanism
prevents the larger proportion of the medical fraternity from purchasing them. Herein the
State Electro-Medical Institute excel?, as it possesses the finest electrical plant in the word.
Their use of these ar>p iances in the administration of medicine, or what is known to the
scientific world as the Electro-Medical Cure, Is the result of expensive and exhaustive experi-
mental research. \1 he X-Ray has proved itself, in the hands of specialists of the Institute, of
inestimable value in determining the location and character of disease.

FRANCE HAS NOT YET PUT DOWN
THE INSURRECTION IN TAHITI
The Messager de Tahiti Gives the French Casualties
as Seven Persons Killed and Fifteen
Wounded.
LOSS OF REBELS NOT
KNOWN.
When Driven From One Posi
tion They Immediately
Took Up Another.
HARASSING THE FJRENCH
SOLDIERS.
Lurking in the Bus 1 ! They Were
â¢ Constantly Making Suddm Des
cents on tbe Trcops
The barkentine Tropic Bird arrived
from Tahiti yesterday after a fair run of
thirty days. Captain Jackson was a very
sick man while the vessel was in Papeete,
but is now hale and hearty again. He
says that the Bird never folded her wings
during the entire trii>, and when the re
cent northwester was raging she logged
over 280 knots a day for three consecutive
days, a splendid showing for a sailing
vessel.
Two days before the Tropic Bird sailed |
the gunboat Duguay-Trouin arrived Irom j
the seat of war in Raiatea end Tahao. i
She reported the rebels as being steadily
driven back, but nevertheless more men
and ammunition were required and the j
gunboat bad come ior them.
The French flag, which had been torn :
down at the commencement of the rebel- :
lion, had been replaced, but the natives i
were still in force and seemed determined |
to hold out to the bitter end. Up to Feb- j
ruary 5 last Le Messager de Tahiti gave :
the list of casualties on the French side as ;
seven killed and fifteen wounded.
The Messager d? Tahiti says: "Charles
Gfisostoni, corporal of the detachment
from Noumea, was seen in the hospital
last Sunday. While marching at the
head of his section a discharge made by
the rebels from a ditch in which they were
hiding wounded him in the ankle, another
bullet perforated his pocket-book and a
spear went through iiis hand."
The wounds of about a dozen others are
then described, and without saying so, the
paper indicates that the French had to re
liie.
Rene le Savut was speared by the
natives, and his ammunition beiiiir gone
and having lost his bayonet, he made a
club out ot his rifls and fought like a
Trojan. He was captured, but his com
rades charged back and overcame the
Raiateans ana rescued their companion.
His clothes were in shred?, and beside tne
spear wound he was struck several times
by bullets and he may die.
After the battle an examination was
made of the bullets fired by the natives.
It was found that they were all siugs of
lead whi(sb had been molded in the sand,
and caused in consequence an ugly, jaeged
wound. A translation from the columns
of Le Messager de Tahiti is as ioilows:
After the bloody encounter of Teraotoa,
when the dead were buried and the wounded
tuccored, the column commanded by M.
Chocheprat continued to adv.ixic>-*, vxpioriug
alternately the valleys oi the western islands
and destroying thf traces oi tne rebels.
The reoels were fleeing and in their retreat
were firing right und ten. Their bullets, how
ever, rarely reached their mark. Between
times Kaiateans came in groups, accompanied
by their wives and children, and surrendered
their arms. The column commanded by M.
I)tunel met with similar experience.
"On the 6ih thocheprai's column reached
the valley of the Opoa, whore they mot a
rather iHrge dittchmentof rebels, in the inidsi
of which wns xCraupo. A lively battle fol
; wed, in whicn tiie rebel chief Otan, bad.y
wounded, was taken captive. He died a woek
later.
A moment later It looked as though Teraupo
was to share the same fate, when he and his
followers took shelter behind the women cud
the children.
Order wrs immediately given by the officers
to cease firing. The indignation of the Mi
dlers was extreme, and Teraupo owes his pres
ervation lo the length of his limbs. After the
(ith the rebels, with vivid recollections of
Toraoiou, fled to all parts, aud surrenders were
mÂ«ny an<t frequent.

chose to surrender, saying, "Farani niArtai"
(Frenchman is eood). A garrison hns been es
mb.ished at dTiurou.
The commander of the Duguay-Trouin, to
whom, tiit: d^pased Qusen ot Avera had pre
viously civc;i ill ih<- guns, received also from
bur cx-Maj'Sty Ihe flag of the I'rotectorate in
exch inije lor the French flag, which she had
immediately raised, et the same time making !
a written declaration of loyally to France.
Itwas immediately noted ihat this mani
festation was lÂ»ut a ruse, for in the house of
the ex-queen were four red vests and other
rebel equipments.
The deieat of the natives at Tahaa on Janu
ary 18 mot with no results, as the inhabitants
<>i Hie ii.ft.nds daily manifested their hoitilitv
by insulting the French flag: and tiring on the
passing boats. It \v:-.s decided on the 14th
10 reduce- the island to submission.
Commandant Daniel was put in charge. The
infantry of the marines and v section of vol
uuteers were placed at the outposts.
On the 15th after a general review by Com
maiidner Bayle the troops embarked on the
Duguay-Trouin. to the creat as toniMhment of
the population, who. naturally ignorant of the
project, were anxiously inquiring whether the
iroops were not abandoning the tight and pre
paring to re-enter Papeete.
Toward 2a. m., ia the pouring rain, a con
tingent of forces composed principally of
murines, reached the shores of Tahaa, at the
jif?reed point, occupying the isthmusembraced
by the bays of Apu and Hamore. The move
ment, v.hich was to be accomplished without
light and in profound silence, was punctually
executed.
At daybreak the attacking column landed at
Port Toanafo, at the southern jj#ut of the
island, preparing to charge on the enemy by a
flank movement. Thus surrounded, the ad
versary hastily abandoned the vilinge, the
troops taking possession atabout 9:30, just as
the rebels were aDout to tit dowu to their moru-
ing roeai.
Continuing to fight while retreating the
rebels retired In the direction of the isthmus
with the evident intention of reaching the
plain where resistance would be easier work,
j t was there that they were awaited and they
found themselves entirely cut oil' by a cordon
of iroops.
Disconcerted, they retreated toward Mount
Furewra. Finally, judging resistance useless,
they showed the flag of truce, and on the
morning of the 17th capitulated.
As the result of this encounter the rebels
lost three men and three were wounded. Not
one of the French troops received even a
scratch. On tho 18th, while Commander
Jiayle was entering the western coast of Nora
de l'lle de Tunas, his men were attacked by a
troop of rebels who were hidden in the thicket
at Mamora.
An officer of the staff of the Mayor, Com
mander If. Ryckleynck, answered the shots of
ihe adversaries. About thirty shots were
fired, killing one man and wounding another.
The ?9th the cordon at the isthmus was
broken and the column invaded the field,
which wbh thoroughly explored. About fifteen
captives were taken and the rest or the popu
lation was reduced to complete submission.
Tahaa thus being completely subjugated,
the troops were put aboard the Duguav-Trouin
again and were landed at Uturoa. Tnis was
decided upon as the basis of operations for
the future. The natives were not subjugated,
however When Lieutenant Gadiot aud fi:ty
men were marchine along the beach â  nt
Tevaiton, they were tired upon by the natives
from tbe brush. The soldiers chareed, but
could not find a;;y trace of the men. The
French lost one sergeant and three soldier*,
while traces of blood on the eronnd showed
that the rebels must also have suffered.
From the men on the Tropic Bird it was
learned that the lighting was regular bush
warfare and that the rebels were fairly
holding their own. if driven from one
point they tooK up their quarters In an
other and awaited another opportunity to
descend upon the troops. All the volun
teers and the reserve had been ordered
our, and were to leave for the scene of ac
tion at once on the gunboat. Troops have
been brought from New Caledonia ana a
most vigorous attempt is to be made to
put down the rebellion once and forever.
The next mailboat from Tahiti should
bring some stirring news.
WORDS FROM CARSON.
A Remarkable Feat With Four
Hundred Thousand of Them.
One of the great features of the big
event at Carson was tne stupendous task
performed by the Western Union Tele
graph Company.
On the day of the fight about 400,000
words of press reports, besides the great
number of messages at commercial rates,
were tiled in the improvised office at Car
son, and the bulk of this vast quantity of
matter was filed after 6 p..m. and intended
for publication all over the country the
next morning.
"Four hundred thousand words" will
not convey any definite conception of
quantity to many people, but the job was
the biggest one by far in the history of
prize-fighting, and hts been rivaled by Na
tional conventions only.
To handle this business the telegraph
company had at the start one wire from
Reno to Carson. The entire plant was
practically rebuilt and eight new wires
were strung, the cost being $20,000.
Quadruplex circuits and Wheatstone
multiplex systems were put in and forty
operators provided. W. J. Martin, super
intendent of the San Francisco office,
arranged the electrical facilities and
Superintendent Jaynes took personal
charge.
Nearly 100 press correspondents rushed
in their respective reports together, but
news was spread at the rate of 30,000
words an hour, and though it was three
hours later in New York every Eastern
as well as every coast paper was served in
time, winning many voluntary cjmpli
nients Irom leading journals. The eight
wires will rest in wait for another Carson
carnival.

CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 18.â Scott
Jackson and Aionzo Wallinj, sentenced to
j hang for the murder of Pearl Bryan, in
Covington, Ky., to-night submitted their
"confessions" to the persons with whom
they had "exclusively" arranged for their
presentation to the public through the
! press to-morrow.
Governor Bradley of Kentucky, upon
I hearing that the alleged confessions were
ready insisted on considering the matter
at once. Jackson's confession covers six
j pages and Wallina's three. They do not
I deny beinu implicated in the causing of
the death of Pearl Bryan, but cla>m that
her death was accidental and not intended
by them at all. They say death resulted
from an overdose of an opiate adminis
tered preparatory tv an intended criminal
operation. A third person is mentioned.
It is said Governor Bradley will not res
pite either man as their "confessions"
to-night directly contradict their sworn
statements during tneir trials.
The third person mentioned is said to
be a professional man who has almost
from the date of the murder been an in
mate of a public institution undergoing
treatment. There is no attempt made to
locate the missing head of the victim,
which they claim was carried away by the
person. The decapitation of course was
to prevent identification.
TO IMPROVE GERMANY'S NAVY.
Proposal Made by Emperor William for
Extra Naval Credits Debated in
ihe Reichstag.
BERLIN, Germany, March 18. â The
Government's proposals for extra naval
credits were debated in the Reichstag to
day.
Dr. Lieber, the leader of the Centrists,
made a speech in justification of the ac
tion of the Reichstag budget committee in
rejecting the Government's demands for
additional credits for the construction of
new cruisers and torpedo-boats, and Prince
Hohenlohe, the High Imperial Chancelor,
read a report declaring that the increases
in the navy asked for by the Government
were necessary, and that tho Government
felt sure that the majority of the members
of the Reichstag would concur ia this
view.
What the Government now demanded,
the Chancellor said, was the minimum
yum required to guard the vital interests
ot Germany on sea and land. Prince
Hohculohe's remarks expressine confi
dence that the majority would concur in
his view were received with silence, but hia
reference to guarding tbe vital interests of
Germany was applauded by the members
of the Right
Herr Marschall yon Bieberstein, Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, offered the Chan
cellor in a speech support of the Govern
ment's proposals. Freiherr Marschall
condemned the action of the budget com
mittee as extremely unwise, although he
wou.d not offer the suggestion thai it was
unpatriotic. The cruisers which the Gov
ernment had wished to construct, he said,
were badly needed to protect the trade ot
Germuny and the German missions to
open up China, as well as to retain the
adherence of Germans abroad to the
fatherland. [Cheers.]
Vice-Admiral Holmann, the head of the
imperial admiralty, then gave an opinion
as a naval expert of the needs of the
marine service. Herr yon Cardoff, free
Conservative, advocated the granting of
tbe extra credits in the form demanded by
the Government.
Herr Mueller stated that the party of
the Center was united in favor of rejecting
the sums demanded for new cruisers and
declared that he considered this fact as
settling the fate of the Government's pro
posal.

Father Antony Maraschi, one of the
oldest and most distinguished members of
the Society of Jesus, died yesierday morn
ing at St. Ignatius College. His death,
tl-ough by no means unexpected in
view of his extreme age of nearly four
score years and his arduous life, was
rather sudden. As late as Monday last
he pursued his customary duties and at 5

brated his last mass. He showed himsfilr
devoted to the end and did not cease to
minister to the needs of the Bick and
dying until bis failing health absolutely
compelled him to do so. .
He was fully cognizant of the approach
of death and received the last sacraments
in a spirit of perfect resignation. No im
mediate cause of death was named other
than the weakness due to accumulating
years.
The remains were conveyed to the Gen
tlemen's Sodality yesterday afternoon and
will be removed thence by the 10:30 train
on Saturday for interment in the cemetery
of the order at Santa Clara. A requiem
mas* will be solemnized at 9 o'clock the
same morning.
Father Maraschi was In many respects
one of the most distinguished and able
members of the Jesuit order on che Pacitic
Coast, and to his remarkable executive
ability and financial acumen the present
importance of St. Ignatius College may be
directly attributed. He relinquished his
position as the principal of tuat institu
tion many years ago. He always retained
the manaeeinent of the funds and exer
cised a general supervision of all depart
ments. He was also a director of the La
dies* Sodality connected with the church.
Father Maranchi was born at Oleggio, in
the diocese of Novaro, Italy, in Septem
ber, 1820, and studied philosopLy and
theology at the seminary ot Novaro. In
1848 the revolutionary uprisings through
out Europe led to the expulsion of the
Jesuiis lrom many countries and the
temporary disorganization of the order.
The subject of this sketch came to Amer

NEW TO-DAT.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF ELECTRIC BELTS ON THE
1 market. Some of them generate a current that can be noticed when
placed on the body, but many of them do not. Some that are sold
under high-sounding names have no more electric power than a piece of
string around the waist. These are the kind which are sold at $i and
$2. Others that do generate a sensible current are so made that it is
impossible to control the current, which burns and blisters so that no
one can wear them. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is different from all
these. Its battery is scientifically constructed, perfectly insulated, and
as the current enters the body in a steady, warming stream it is made
mild or strong at will by a regulating thumb-screw, which places the
power of the Belt under complete direction of the wearer. No other
electric appliance made for body wear has this advantage, which is
partly the reason for the great popularity of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
This, however, is coupled with a powerful current, which is guaranteed
to last for one year, and a new belt is given when one wears out within
that time. No other electric belt in the country will last one year. It
is well made and applied under the personal direction of Dr. Sanden, a
physician of 30 years' experience.
The value of electricity as a cure for nervous and chronic complaints,
weakness, debility, lame back, rheumatism, etc., is conceded by the
medical profession, hence Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is the cheapest
and surest cure known for these complaints. Read Dr. Sanden's book
"Three Classes of Men. " A pocket edition will be sent, closely sealed,

notable sermon.
In 1853 he established the first church
and schoql of St. Ignatius on the site of
the present Emporium buildine, where he
soon began to give evidence of those
qualities as a financier which subse
quently earned the respect of the City's
keenest business men. That portion ot
Market street was virtually beyond the
City limits in those days, and the land in
the vicinity was mainly composed of bar
ren sandhills. Father Maraschi, however,
foresaw the future possibilities of this
property, and wished to purchase the lots
irotn Fourth to Fifth street along Jessie,
for a few hundred dollars, but was opposed
by Father Congiato, then superior of the
order in California and Oregon, and an
old man of 80.
The college â popularly known as Mar
aschi's school â was incorporated April 30,
1859, and a prospectus issued in 1861 shows
that there were then 144 students in at
tendance, since increased to lully 500.
Maraschi. was president, treasurer, prefect
of studies, professor of ancient and mod
ern languages, mathematics and book
keeping. Oi that first faculty only two
survive, viz. : Father F. Raffcs and J.
Egan.
In 1862 the brick building, : which re
placed the earlier wooden structure on
Market street, was erected.
In 1880 the splendid buildings on Hayes
street and Van Ness avenue were con
structed, and here again Father Maraschi
negotiated the purcnose of the property
and supervised most of the business de
tails connected with tne work.
The deceased throughout his life showed
a stern devotion to duty and a contempt
lor physical comforts, which are invari
:iby associated with the character of
Loyola's followers. He carried his aus
terities to the extreme of never sleeping in
a bed and passed his nights in an arm
chair, protected only by his cassock, of
which he rarely divested himself, and an
old cloak. He did this in order that he
might be ever ready to answer tha call of
those who needed his priestly ministra
tions, which were in constant requisition.
Every morning, without exception, he
was accustomed to rise before 4 o'clock,
and to celebrate mass in the sacristy at 5.
The rest oi the day would be devoted to
the performance of his parochial duties.
His judgment in all matters, both re
ligious and secular, was regarded by his
numerous admirers as almost infallible,
and the appeals for his advice and assist
ance were incessant.
Thousands to whom his characteristic
face and diminutive figure were familiar,
as well as those who knew him person
ally, will experience a pang of keen regret
when they hear of his demise.

Petition for Ho: brook To Stay in the
Society fcr the Prevention of
Crnelty to Children
Trouble in the local Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children has about
come to the focusing point. A strong ef
fort will be made, not only to retaia Frank
Holbrook as a special officer, but to have
Secretary C. P. Welch discharged.
E. B. Holbrook, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal?,
acting in a private capacity, will send to
day to Director Gi.bert Palache, one of the
directors, a request that a special meeting
be called to investigate charge- made
against Welch in the form of affidavits,
duly sworn to ana nineteen in number.
Tuey impugn Secretary Welch as re
cards ability to bold bis position, charge
him with mismanagement* and being the
possessoi of an ungovernable temper, and
insulting many compelled to come in con
tact with him in official business.
There are various other charges, and
among those who prefer them are Sister
Julia of the Sheltering Arms and Mrs.
John Pettee, both of whom have shown
their aversion to the secretary hitherto.
Accompanying the communication sent
to Palacbe will be the affidavits in the
case, and a petition, signed by Superior
and Police Court Judges, captains, lieu
tenants and sereeants of police, and other
persons of influence, asking that the posi
tion now heid by HolDrook be not abol
ished on the Ist of April.
FAIR'S BEIRS WANT MONEY.
Petitions for Partial Distribution Filed
in Judge Slack's Court,
In the matter of the estate of James G.
Fair, deceased, several petitions for par
tial distribution were presented in Judge
Slack's department of the Superior Conrt
yesterday.
The amounts asked for are: James S.
Angus, $10,000; Herbert Clarke, $2000;
Wesley E. Crothers, $22,727 27; Charles G.
Stewart, $3000; James Fair, nephew of the
ceceased, $6250; Gustave L. Bresse, $14,800.
The petitions are almost identical in
form, though they are presented by differ
ent lawyers. They concluded with the
statement that the estate oi James G.
Fair is but little indebted and that the
sums asked for may be allowed and paid
out without loss to the creditors of the
estate.
In each case bonds are offered to guar
antee the estate against loss or damage.

termined that all such cases brought into his
court should bi* pros cuted.

Important Letter Frcm AÂ»rnt Town
send of the Bureau of Foreign
Crmmerc â¢.
1 Japan is about to adopt the gold stand
kid. The fluctuations in the money mar
. J&t due to thÂ«.free coinage of silver have
< proved too troublesome for that progres
sive country and she has determined to
take summary measures to improve her
, financial condition.
All this is learned from a letter which
reached here on the steamer i'eru yester
day from W. H. Townsend, the special
representative of t the San Francisco
Bureau of Foreign Commerce, created by
the Chamber of Commerce, the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade and the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association. To
make the change the Chinese indemnity
fund will be used, and even now negotia
tions are' pending for a loan from the
Rothschilds. . -
. The letter, which contains many other 1
items of interest, reads as follows: . .
â  â¢'â¢' Yokohama, Feb. 22, 1897. .
William X. Bunker Esq., and Member* Bureau
â¢ Foreign Commerce, San Francisco, fa.âGentlem
en; Since my last report the condition of
affairs here financially has improved very con-'
siderably, and this has been caused by the
proposition to adopt a- gold standard lor
Japan.
ih*Cablnet Ministers have been discussing
the question, and have decided to present a
bill at once to the Diet with the recommenda
tion that-it be passed promptly. This is causing
no end of discussion in both the foreign end
.vernacular press, and the general opinion,
â¢ particularly among the latter, is that the
movement will benefit Japan.
. â  -It is not proposed to make the present silver
yen or dollar equal in value to the American
"gold dollar, but to coin gold wi-l issue gold:
nc'iea upon aoaut the present value of tho
Mexican silver dollar, or possibly to set a
standard of value for both metals on the basis
â  of 32 to 1, and discontinue the free coinage of
. silver. â¢ â¢
. â¢ Jat-p.n has still a balance coming to her out
01 the Chinese indemnity fund, which is pay
. able in gold in London, and instead of using
'all this gold to pay for ironclads and other
foreign goods to be purchased aoroad, she pro
poses to use it as a basis lor making the
, . change. '
Bite has a comparatively small bonded in- j
debtedness Â«ow, which is parable in sliver and.
1 held by tier own people. - * More ; money is re-!
. Iquired than the balance of the Chinese in- I
laemn'ty fund , allof which is practically spent, ,
fand.a -further 60,000,000 yen must be bor
rowed to provide funds for all the bills con
tracted and to carry out the improvements
contemplated.-
Negotiations have been pending for some 1
time with the Rothschilds through their I
agent here, and it is said that they are will
nig to ti.k; up the whole of such a loan pro- J
vided the bonds are made payable in gold.
Japan is a wonderfully progressive country
and is going ahead by leaps mid bounds, but
: sh. ; is spending vast sums on her navy and in
maintaining- an army, and great improve
. ments are contemplated in various other di
rections.
â She needs extensive harbor improvements,

Since the question -of adopting the gold

' went (silver) bonds have risen in value from
97 to above par, and shares of all kinds, wbicu
were fearfully depressed at close of last year,
are moving upward. AH of this is having its
â  effect on general business, and as I stated at
the outset the general financial condition is
much Improved. â¢
Tfiera is no doubt that the adoption of a
' gold standard will benefit the import busi
â¢ ness, as it will give confidence to every, one
having goods to hell to Japan and probably
lessen the difference in exchange, so that im
'. ported articles will probably be cheaper.
. Whether it will be detrimental to the exports
of the country is the principal danger to â  be
considered; many think it will to the diver
countries of the Orient, but these take only 10
per cent of the total value of goods exported.
On the otr.er hand, will it injure the lea, rice

MILITAET BALLOONS.
One Qver a Mile Illpli I>Â«-mol by a
. Camion Sliot.'V
When the military balloon is spoken of
â¢ by an extort it is not usually the repre
sentative of the balloon's which are essen
tially familiar to every person who has
* !-â¢.â¢!! an ascension, nor is it always one of
We ''dirigible" airships that are now built
11 d used for military purposes in France,
<*.â  rmany and some other countries. f The
fact, is'that the military officer knows that
neither of these productions of the science
* of aeronautics is sufficiently perfect to in
: sure the realization or . the best results
when it is called into requisition. Even
o under normal conditions, to depend" on
". them would be to risk too much on a
c ' method of reconnoitering which ;- is ; ex
' ceedini:lyimpÂ«rfoct. Balloons have been
used by an army which is on a campaign,
and with satisfactory results. But when
they have returned to the eartli with no
news, occasions often noted in the history
of military operations. â¢. rpat discourage
ment has overtaken the officers who have
employed them. Accordingly there is a
demand for an ideal balloon for military
purposes. .
But the common or "indineible air
ship has riot yet been replaced with 0113
which can be so generally used. The
"dirigible" gasbag cannot ba sent upon a
desired course except in calm weather.
Experts are thus thrust DacK on the
common kind, which is now pretty well
understood and which can be moved,
within narrow limits, at the will of the
aeronaut. The flying machine is still to
come fonh from its nest in the laboratory
or the workshop. Compelled then, as the
military aeronauts are, to study up their
possible opportunities under such restric
tions, they must give their attention to
the iner.ns by which the free or the cap
tive or the "dirigible" balloon ca,n be
made the most serviceable. But at the
same time they ore forced to provide
against the danger which threatens the
airship from missiles sent after it.
Just as there is a contest always goinp
on between armor and projectiles, so
another is proceeding between balloons
and held ordnance. Some noteworthy re
sults have already been achieved, as has
been pointed out, by reconnoitering from
balloon cars. Achievements have also
followed the efforts to "wing" the airships,
and one of them, chronicled only.last week
requires comment.
The experiment took place at Shoebury
ness, where there is a school of gunnery
for the British army. The ordnance offi
cers who conducted it had already demon-
Elated that a balloon might be hit and
"collapsed by a small shot at an altitude
of a mile, but they had been unable 10
effect the destruction of the airship witn
out the expenditure of many rounds. The
best gunners previous to last week had
reached the target at a little less than a
mile high, out only at the nineteenth shot.
Last week a captive balloon was sent up
2010 yards. The gunners were not in
formed as to the altitude, and when
ordered to tire were required to discover
the range. The first shot proved that they
had the range. They were using nfieen
pound field pieces, nevertheless, and so
hud to allow for a reasonable trajectory
and deviation. At ihe fourth discharge
the balloon was struck. With the sev ntii
the globe collapsed. The military officers
were bo well pleased that they procseded
at once to claim that military ballooning,
except to carry dispatches, had received a
fatal setback. Their proposition has
naturally disturbed the advocates of
balloon reconnoitering, and is now being
discussed pro and con with some heat botu
in England and on the Continent.
Ii is unnecessary to conclude that either
the artillerists or the aeronauts take the
correct view of this experiment. The cir
cumstance that an airship has been dem
onstrated to have no immunity from de
struction at a distance of over a rciie from
the earth is, however, of no little signifi
cance. In this case the target was sta
tionary, but even if it had not been the
gunners would have been able to throw
shot all about it. A "dirigible 1 " balloon,
moving at its greatest speed, which is from
fifteen to twenty miles an hour, would
have oeen subject to the saint misfortune.
Yet t>ie military experts are all demand
ing, since they cannot have a ppr;ect fly
ine:-machine, that the war balloon be
connected with the earth by a telephone
wire. Such a means of communicating
with the man in the car above implies the
stationary character of the gasbag to a
great degree. But in these days when,
on account of the long-range capacity ol
all weapons, armies are not often brought
to close quarters, the aerial reconnoiter
ing party will not always, if generally,
succeed in making valuable observations
unless the airship rises to a great height.
Until a balloon reaches a lofty altitude
it can therefore make little progress in
discovering the movements of ths enemy.
Moreover, it is unsafe for its occupants as
long as it is within at least a mile and an
eighth of the ground. When it is higher,
if the onemy can turn heavy field ordnance
upon it, it is less unsafe, but not out of
danger. If it is set free, unless the wind
is right, or unless it is "dirigible," in
which latter case there must be especially
favorable weather, it is still sure to become
a target for gunners in the other army.
The use of smokeless powder also in
creases the danger, since it will be impos
sible for the party in the car to know
whether they are being moved within the
range of fire until it is pernaps too late to
get put of it in safety. When, too, the
enemy may use a simitar means to secure
information, the prospect of deriving ad
vantage from the utilization of ;his very
advanced method of reconnoitering is ren
dered small, unless a perfect, an ideal,
balloon or dying machine is discovered.â

A LETTER FROM JOHN BROWN.

Rev. Luther Humphreyâ My Dear Friend:
Your kind letter of the 13 th lust, is now before
me. So far as my knowledge goes as to our

the '.anding of Peter Brown from the May

prisonment or to the gallows. But my dear
old friend, let not that fact alone grieve you.
You cannot have forgotten how and where
our grandfather (Captain John Brown) fell in
1776; and that he too might have perlsned on
the scHffoid had circumstances been but very
little different. The fact that a man dies un
der the hand of an executioner (or otherwise)
has but little to do with his true character, as
I suppose. John Rogers perished at the state
a great and good man, as I suppose, but his
bjr.H? so does not prove that any other man
who has died in the same way was good or ;
otherwise. - â¢ â  ' = .
Whether I have any reÂ« son to "be of good
cheer" (or not) 111 view of my end, I can ne- '
sure you that 1 feel so, and that I am totally I
blinded if I do not really experience that
strengthening and consolation you so fatlh-
: fully implore in my. behalf. ' God of: our
fathers, reward your fidelity. I feel neither
mortified, degraded, nor in the least ashamed
of my imprisonment, my chain, or my near
j prospect of death by hanging. I feel: assured
I "that not one hair shad fall from my head
without my heavenly Father." I also feel
I that I have long been endeavoring to hold
exactly 'such a fast as God hes chosen." , Bee
' 'he passage In Isaiah which you have quoted.
; No part of my life has been more happily

humbly trust that no part has been spent to
better purpose. I would, not say this boast
ingly. but "thanks bs _ ; unto God . who
giveth us the victory: through infinite grace."
I should be Sixty years old were I to live till

City in Which to Hold the
Next Convention.
Nearly all of the morning session of the
United States Mail Railway Service Con
vention was taken up yesterday with
the reading of memorials to the departed
members of the association. Forty- four
memorials were read, showing the mortu
ary list to have been increased just that
number in the past eighteen months.
The death in this city of J. P. Coleraan,
a member of Division 8, was announced,
and the members of the convention were
invited to attend the funeral ceremonies
this morning from the late residence of
the deceased, at 133 Clara street, at 8:30

UNCLE SAM'S LOANS.
Ono of tho Early Ones of the Govern
ment Was Payable iv Tobacco.
Two curious facts are brought into
prominence by Register Tillman in his re
cent report, says a correspondent of the
New York Tribune. They are that the
first loan made by the United States was
made payable in tobacco, and that Secre
tary Alexander Hamilton negotiated a
loan in the absence of any law authorizing i
him to do so. The loan made payable in
tobacco was authorized by a resolution of
the Continental Congress on December
23. 1777.
The length of the loan was indefinite
and the amount authorized was $10,000.
--000. The amount issued was $181,500.
which sola at par, with interest at 5 per
cent. This was received on June 4,1777,
from the Farmers' General of France.
The purpose to whicii the loau was ap
plied was tlie puichase of "supplies and
to aid in the building of cruisers to prose
cute the war of the revolution." The in
terest on $153,082 89, the balance of this
loan, ceased on December 31, 1795, when it
was merged into the general account of
the French debt. In those days tobacco
passed as currency between the colonies.
In 1879 Secretary Hamilton found the
treasury without funds. On bis own re
sponsibility hÂ« negotiated a loan of $191,
--608 81. It sold at par, with C per cent in
terest Tup first issue of this loan was on
September 13, 1789, and June 8. 1790, was
named as the day of final redemption, and
the duties of imports and tonnages werÂ«
set aside to meet it. The money was ob
tained from the Bank of New York and
the Bank of North America. The Secre
tary said: "Obvious consideration dic
tated the propriety in future cases of mak-
JOHN M. RUTHER, the New President.
ing previous loans as the public exigen
cies may call for, denning their extent
and giving special authority to make
them.'*
A third loan followed, under the act of
Congress of March 26, 179 C. It was nego
tiated by President Washington, and the
amount issued was $55,000. The contract
for the loan provided lor its payment on
terms similar to those of the preceding
loan of the Bank of New York, the reve
nues derived from duties on imports and
tonnage beinjf pledged for its redemption.
The money was needed for the compensa
tion of the members and employes of
Congress, the payment of the salaries of
the civil list, etc., and of arrears of inter
est on the Dutch loans. There was in the
treasury nt the time a juiii not exceeding
$50,000. Other loans folowed in quick
succps-ion, and their history, as related in
Rogistrai Tillman's report, contains valu
able information for students of Govern
ment finances.

SHERIFF WHELAN
Two Examiner Fakers
Spend a Day in His
Offics.
Long Green Lawrence and L. L
Levings Surrender Them
selves.
Released Ysterday Afternoon by
Judge Morrcw on a Writ of
Habeas Corpus.
â¢
Long Green Lawrence and his subor
dinate, L. L. Livings, spent yesterday in
the custody of Sheriff Whelan, though
they were not locked up in the County
Jail. They appeared at the Sheriff's
office at the City Hall in the morning,
according to the agreement made on the
previous evening, and Mr. Whelan noti
fied the Sheriff of Sacramento County that
the men were in his charge.
About 2 o'clock /esterday alternoon,
after the two men had spent the day in
Mr. Whelan'a private office, the Sacra
mento deputy arrived and the prisoners
were turned over to him.
Lawrence asked that the trip to Sacra
mento be delayed until hia attorneys, who
were at work on habeas corpus proceed
ings before the United States courts, could
be Heard from, but the deputy refused to
promise any delay beyond 4 o'clock, the
hour when the train started. H-j took
Lawrence and Levinjcs to lunch and later
to the otlice of their attorney.
Early yesterday Charles j. Heggerty of
Kniiht <fc Heggerty appeared before Fed
eral Judge Morrow with a petition tor a
writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Law
rence and Ltvint'S, who he stated were
illegally restrained of their liberty by
Sheriff Johnson of Sacramento County
and by L. F. Blackburn, sergeant-at-arms
ol the State Senate.
The petition was very long and recited
nearly all of the contempt proceeding
down to the time of the decision rendered
by the State Supreme Court, and many
reasons were set forth to show that the
imprisonment was illegal and that the
Senate had exceeded its power and juris
diction. As one instance the document
states:
That said alleged contempt was not com
mitted in the Immediate view and presence of
said Senate, and that no affidavit of the facts
cons'ituting; the alleged contempt wrs ever
mad? io or was before said Senate, and no affi
davit whatever was presented to said Senate of
the facts constituting said contempt.
One of the principal claims set up was
that the incarceration was in violation of
the fourteenth amendment of the consti
tution of the United States.
The writ wus issued by Judge Morrow,
and made returnable forthwith.
A little before 4 o'clock Deputy Sheriff
Hinters, who bad been directed by the
United States Marshil to produce the
bodies of hia prisoners in court, appeared
before Judge Morrow witn Lawrence and
Levings. The proceedings were short.
Upon the showing that the writ bad been
properly returned Judge Morrow said tnat
he would hear the crso at 10 o'clock this
morning, and ha ordered that the appli
cants be releÂ»sed upon furnishing bail in
the sum of $1000 oncn, which waa uoae.
A BAOÂ£ OP MEN WITH TAILS.
Discovery of a French Traveler in n
Forest In Indo- China.
Paul d'Enjoy, a French anthropologist,
tells in a recent number of L'Anthropolo
gie about a race of men with ta:ls which
he has reason to believe exists, or has ex
isted within recent times, in the. Indo-
Chinesn peninsula. While exploring the
forest in that part ot French Annam lying
between latitude 11 deg. and 12 deg. north
and longitude 104 deg. and 10G deg. east
the Frenchman came upon an old savage,
who was first seen up a tree gathering
honey. When the navage saw the Euro
pean party approaching he hastened
down the tree by seizing the bark with his
prehensile feet and the limbs with his
bands, so that at first sicht he was tatcen
for a monkey. M. D'Enjoy surroundea
the savage with a ring of coolies, and the
prisoner vainly endeavored to escape by
butting his captors with his head.
The explorer came upon the home of bis
captive, a long tunnel in a great heap oi
dead leaves. Others of the tribe occupy
ing the hut lied at the approach of the
strangers, leaving behind in their strange
house a few polifhed stones, bamboo pipes,
copper bracelets and pearl necklaces.
Tdese articles M. D'Enjoy believes to biive
been obtained by the savages from the
Annamites, with whom the former carry
on an irregular trade.
The captive is described by the French
man as having a well-marked caudal ap
pendage and ankle hones with processes
that suggested a cock's spurs. The savane
managed to say by the aid of the Anna
mites of the expedition, who were aston
ished at his tail and called him a monkey,
that according to tradition all of the tribe
once tiad tails, and that through inter
marraipe with tailless neighbors mo*t
members of tbe tribe are now also tailless.
This was about all that was learned
from the savage, for soon after he was
captured he poisoned one of tbe coolies
and escaped, and it was necessary to
hurry oat of the forest in order to save
tbe coolie's life. M. D'Enjoy, however, ia

almost willing to believe that the ances
tors of his temporary captive really had
tails, and were midway between savage
man and the- ape. The tribe is known by
many names in the several languages of
its more civilized neighbors, and is hated
by ail as a race of brutish savagery. The
tribe is called Moi by the Annamites, and
some Annamite neighbors of the Moi,
subjects of France, are noted as having
prehensile feet, perhaps from intermar
riage with the Moi. The Chinese call
these Annamites of the prehensile feet
Giao Chi, which means "detached great
toe."
M. D'Enjoy has reason to reject the
classification of the Moi as an offshoot of
the Dyaks, a classification made by a
French anthropologist, after an examina
tion of Moi skulk. These skulls, M.
D'Enjov believes, could have been those
of only the partly civilized Moi of mixed
blood. The skull of the Moi, if pure
blood, would, he thinks, tell a different
tale.
The Moi now occupy a forest area of
Incto-China. though M. D'Enjoy believes
that they once occupied the whole indo-
China peninsula. They are exceedingly
shy of strangers and, if closely pursued,
they defend themselves with poisoned
arrows shot with unerring aim. A wound
from one of these arrows is almost sure
death. Besides thi?, the miasmas of the
region they inhabit are especially danger
ous to unacclimated travelers. It is the'
habit of the more civilised neighbors of
the Moi to slay them at every chance,
much as the Apache 3 are slain in Mexico
by any rancher ihat falls in with them.
M. D'Enjoy believes that if the mystery
of the Moi is not soon penetrated the
whole tribe may be destroyed before any
thing further can be learned of them and
their possible tails.
A FAMOUS TIEE HOBSE.
The Favorite of the New York Depart
ment Badly Hurt.
Baby, the greatest favorite and the
most famous horse among all those of the
tire department, ha 3 been sent to the
horse hospital.
Ue was as gentle as a kitten, quick as a
cat, erudite as a lawyer and as full of
tricks as Herrmann, the magician. He
was not only the pet of Hook and Ladder
Company 10, on Fulton street, but ol the
entire population of the city suuta of
Hubert street.
His number on the horse list was 624,
and he came into the department Novem
ber 25, 1889. He was broken into the busi
ness as a flro horse by Captain Dinns of
No. 10, and has latterly been driven by
George Burns. He is a dappled gray, 16
hands high, and was picked up at the horse
market at Bull's Head Taverh. He soon
showed not only a remarkable apitude fax
the work be was destined for, but an ex
ceedingly affectionate nature, and a quicK
ness to learn that endeared him to all who
came in contact with him. He was a
privileged character, and for several years
was not even tied in bis stall, but left free
to wander about the hook-and-ladder
house at his own will. He was never be
hindhand w en the alarm bell sounded,
and was always in place under the yoke at
the Higrnal. and as impatient to reach the
fire as his captain or driver.
On Wednesday night, in response to a
call from station box 32, corner of Green
wich and Albany streets. Baby was in the
rush, a.xi was pulling his share of the
truckload on the keen gallop, but in turn
ing a corner he slipped and fell. When
they finally got him to his feet again bis
friends found he was seriously injured.
They took him out of the harness and led
him slowly and painfully back to the
house. Ti>ey nursed him tenderly, bath
ing the injured hip witft hot water and
liniment. Dat he did not mend. The
veterinary surgeons decided that Baby
must go to the hospital, and expressed the
feat that he might be incapacitated for
future service.
When removed in the ambulance yes
terday, th- animal seemed to realize he
was mortally hurt, and was to be taken
away irom the borne he loved. He

moaned like a human being, while his
eyes looked in a mute appeal to h so d
friends. The partinc waÂ« too much for
some of the tiremen, and they broke down
and cried like children.
George Burns, the driver, said yester
day: "It will be hard to ?et another horse
like Baby. I like the other horses well,
enough, but I'd rather see 'em ali drop
dead t;>an lose Baby. Why, that horse
knew mure than most of us fellows in tha
department. \Ve never kept him tied,
and sometimes he would go up to the cor
ner of Broadway and Fulton street ana
tackle the candy and fruit sand tbere
and help himself to all he wanted. We
Paul the bill without a grumble. He
would come out in the night watch and
lick our faces like an affectionate dog, and
try to chew the buttons off our coats. He
would have got up on our laps like a pet
cat if we would let him. All of us had a
piece of sugar or an apple in our pockets
for Baby when we came in.
"I'm alraid he is too badly hurt ever to
come back to ns. My only consolation is
that I was not driving him when be fell."

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS
â¢ HIDES AND SKINSâ B. Bumner & Co.'s cir
cular says: "Hides and Leather continue about
the same, , but there â  Is an improvement in the
lighter grades or Hides.. Light steers and cows
have advanced In conseauence of higher prices in
the East. There seems to be a general impression
that the market in Hides i and Leather will show
more activity in the course of a short time. The
Leather market does no show any special im
provement and tanners in consequence are work
ing very small quantities. Dry. Hides 'continue
about the same, but with a sum I advance in
values. Dry Kips rule about 2c less than dry
Hides. Wool and sheep skins are about the same,
but there is a tendency toward an Improvement In

One of the most superstiuous members
of the theatrical proiession is Mrs. Icing
try. She declares that whenever she has
met with a failure it has always been
brought about by some malign influence.
Her dMssint-room, wherever she may be
acting, is always well supplied with horse
shoes and other emblems o' good tuck,
and she regards it as an unpardonable of
fenseâpunishable even by dismissal if the
offender is an employeâ 10 bring anything
into the theater supDOsed to be unlucky.

Alameda County Interested
in Having a District
Fair.
Director Kent Is Confident That
the Bill Just Passed Will
B? Signed.
Livermore .Is V^ry Anxious for a
Chance to Ex ib.i Products of

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broaaway, March 18. f
W. M. Kent, who was one of the direc
tors of the old district fair board, is very
enthusiastic over the proposition of
having a fair in Oakland this summer.
Now that the bill appropriating $10,000
to a district fair in Alameda County has
HÂ» H. PITCHER of the Livermore League of Progress.
passed both houses, there is a feeling of
confidence that the bill will receive the
signiture of The Governor. The approDria
tion was vetoed by Governor Budd two
year- ago, because he stated that the
sanction of the State was timply being
used". for the purpose of supiorting a
couple ot weeks of indifferent racing.
This objection no longer holds good, for
1. H. Williams Jr. has already promised
to attend to the racing and to hang up
the usual gocd purses at Emeryville, so
that nrst-clas* sport will be assured. This
will enable the directors to devote the
whole of the appropriation to the exhibi
tion leatures oi the fair.
Referring to the fair to-dcy Mr. Kent
said: "There is every reason why the
Governor should si?n the bill, for it
Couples with the rtistr ct fair the appropn
tion for the State exhibit. The $10,000
thus available must ia.-t for two year.-,
$-3060 to be used each time. In the past
but $3500 was allowed, which was never
enough.
"We have not had a fair since three years
from last August. Then it was held in
f?an Francisco. Now the Ingleside track
n the only place avai able, so it is certain
to be located in Oakland."
Wi V. Witcher, president of the Mer
chants' Exchange, and J. P. Taylor, presi
dent of the Board of Trade, both assure
hearty support from their respective or
ganizations.
Up in Livermore H. H. Pitcher, presi
dent of the League of Progress, is already
canvassing support for a good representa
tion from that neichborhood.
"This part of the county is very anxious
for a chanre to show what it can produce,"
said Mr. Pitcher to-day. "A district fair
in Oakland is just what is needed to stir
people up. Tuere is altopeti.er too little in
common between the different cities and
towns in this county, and we want some
thing on wnich we can nil unite. A big
fair would draw a large crowd from San
Francisco and adjoining counties an<i will
circulate a great deal of money. We sin
cerely hope that Governor Budd will *cc
bis way clear to sign the bill."

CAUSED BY A CANDLE.
John O'Brien's Narrow Eacipo From
Death, and. His Daughter's
Story Â«>f the A (lair.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â The
storits of the circumsiarioes connected
with the burning of John O'Brien early
this week are very confiiciing. He is still
alive, although in a very critical condi
tion. He is a cook, and has been em
ployed in Petaiuma until recently. On
Saturday he came to Oakland to visit his
daughter, Mrs. Carrie Ingram, 313 Eltv
enth street.
Shortly after retiring, at an early hour
Monday tEtorning, screams from his room
brought Mrs. Ingram and her daughter to
his assistance. He was iound on the floor
wrapped in flames. These were extin
guished and a physician c:illed, who cared
for tl c sufferer. A story grained circula
tion that O'Brien had been robbed, oil
thrown over him and set tire to while ha
was asleep. Robbery was given as the
cause.
"To think that any such accusations
should be made b.-vafcs my heart," sobbed
Mrs. Ingram. "Not a bit of oil was on
the bed except what tiie doctor used hi
dressing the wounds. Father had un-
drensed and when ready for bed he put the
light on the floor to look for sonic money
that had slipped out of his pocket. The
candle caught his shirt, and his side and
arm were ba'ilv burned. He would un
doubtedly have been burned to a crisp had
we not readied him.
'"Not a word of truth is in the robbery
story. Father has very little, but is a
great hand to brag about his mines. I
never knew him to have one."
The burns are beveie and may yet result
in hi; deatb.
MAY HAVE TWO JUDGES.
Indications That the Police Court May
Be a Bone of Conten
tion.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â It is as
serted by thoÃe wlio profess to know that
Judge Fred V. Wood surrendered the
Police Court bench yesterday in order to
put Justice Allen in the position of a con
testant instead of Wood. This is to be ac
complished by the appointment of Wood
j to the position by Mayor-elect Thomas
when he assumes office next monti.. He
will then demand tne position, and if it
be not surrendered he will proceed to hold
court, and Allen will be compelled to fieht
to have the powers recognize him.
The courts have held that tner* can be
two Police Judges, as there are in Los An
geles, and it may result in two being in
powÂ«r in this city. Both Justices are paid
the sameâ s2oo0 â but the Police Judge has
the greater prestige with a clerk atid
stenographer to appoint. Hence the
rivalry.
Warren Still Absent.
OAKLAND, Cat.., March 18.â Deputy
Sheriff Sam Heller failed to find Chtia
Warren at hi? home, near Berryman sta
tion, yesterday when he went afer him
rrith a writ of habeas corpus to secure the

i'iven to Deputy Siienff Al White, who
as-erts that he wili camp on the formers'
trail till he finds him.

Bitten by a Spits.
OAKLAND, Cal .March 18.â Eddie Gil
leapie, aged 12, was bitten by a Spitz dog
to-day. Ihe animal's teeth tore the jad's
hand, making it necessary to sew it. The
dog was not angry but simply snapped.

prove dangerous. Eddie is the sou of a
mill engineer.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â The Grand

of petting a light sentence. The authori
ties have been looking for him for seven
years.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1897.
DR. KNOX MAY
BE PRESIDENT
The New Board of Educa
tion Will Ofganizs in
a Few Days.
Superintendent McClymonds Says
the iich ol Directors Have an
Important Dity.
If Professcr Burri l's Statements Be
Trua h? New Board Shoull
A just M itters
Oakland Office !sa>? Francisco Call,)
808 Broadway, March 18. )
One weeK from next Monday the Board
of Education will meet and organize. It
is very probable that Dr. Myra Knox will
be chosen for president, and should slie
decline it is not possible to tell who may
be elected.
The most important business to come
before the new board is the election of a
Superintendent of Schools, who, under
the law. liolds office for four years. At
various times during tne last eight years
in which Superintendent McClymonds
has been in office there has been more or
less talk of other candidates, but they
have never survived the first meeting of
successive new boards.
At this time there is some opposition
shown by Professor Burnll of the high
school, who recently published a long
letter making serious charges against the
system pursued in the grammar school*,
which lie attributed directly to the unfit
ness of the School Superintendent.
As Professor Burriil has been at the head
of a department 111 the High School lor
ten years, his pointed statements created
quite a sensation. Superintendent Mo
tlymonds lias hitherto been silent, but to
day he made the following statement:
This letter of Professor Burrill's is not a
mailer that I feel I can d.scuss with propriety.
It too nearly concerns m â¢ personally. I have
ot course, reail it carefuiiy, and tiie matter
rests with the Board ot Education. In the
new board the majority have already seen
serv;oe as kCho-il directors, and should know
jus: how the scnoo s are b.'ing conducted. If
they are not satistied, it is their duly to make
ch-ipgres. Professor Burriil will not drtw me
imp an open controversy, for I believe thit
this question is simply one lor the School
Board, and nobody else.
I realize that the subject is one of great im
portance. Proiessor burritl is a candidate to
succeed me. He is also in a mca ure under
me as a teacher in the High Sclko. This
places me in n ver â¢â¢ eipbarrassinu losition. I
have no doubt he is sincere and means what
he says, but I shall not ask him for an explan-

atlon. Everything that is done in this connec
tion must come from the board. I see it hint
ed that on account of this opposition he lias
imperiled his po-ition in the Hiith Bcnooi.
That is not true. He hies a right to aspire to
be Superintendent of Schools, and tor all I
know he may be my successor. I have not
solid ted the support of a slnele member of the
new board, find although I know that one or
two favor me I cannot say with certainty that
I shall De my own successor. This matter,
however, will no doubt be judiciously attend
ed to by the new board.

The Great Debate.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Marcn 18.â The date
for the ir.tercoi!e>.iate debating coniest
has not yet been definitely decided upon,
because "of the desire of Stanford tochan c
it from April 17, which was originally
agreed upon, until some time later. It
>eems probable that it will be held a week
later. It lias been customary hitnerto to
hold che dtbate on the evening following
the annual intercollegiate tieldday, but
for some apparemly unknown reason the
Palo Al:o boys wi>h the contest to be
held v week later.

LIQUOR MEN DESPONDENT.
The Anti-Salonn Leaguo Claim* a Ma

ALAMEDA, Cal., March 18.â From
present appearances the liquor dealers
will not take so active a part in the com
ing campaign as was at first believed
would be tho case. "Whether this is be
cause they have canvassed the question
and think that the no-license movement
will win or for other reasons is not known.
At any rate they show considerable
apathy, and the Anti-Saloon League is
correspondingly elated. They believe
ihat in the majorny of precincs they will
win the dÂ»y, ami that in but one or two,
if so many, will the people - r i ve a majority
in favor of the saloon.
A Strange Order.
ALAMEDA, Cal , March 18. âGreen
Majors of this place is the jittorney in a
Justice Court case involving the trifling
amount of $10. The case came un in Jus
tice Clift's court in Oakland, and for good
and sufficient reasons an application for a
change of venup was made. Tne law says
plainly that under such circumstances
the change shall be male "to the nearest
court," neverthelrss the Justice ordered
the case sent to L vermore for trial, the
court therp being the remotest one in the
county. His objection to sending the
case to an Alameda Justice was that Mr.
Majors lived in this city, and he also ob
jected to sending it to East Oakland bs
ian-e on* of the other attorneys lived
there. Now the attorneys are asking
wnnt is the use of having any law on the
subject anyhow.
<'Â»c Candidate Missing.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 18.â All the
candidates for city offices have filed their
pc ltitms with the City Cierk with a single
exception, that of R. B. Tappan for City
Attorney. There are severr.l days yet in
which this important preliminary can be
carried our. The last petition filed was
that of General R. H. AJagill, who pro
poses to run independently for Library

JAY EATON
HAS ARRIVED
The Champion Indoor Bi
cycle Rider Is
Here.
He Will Ride at the Ccming
Bicycle Race Meet at the
Pavilion.
Everything in Reaiiness for the
Op ning of the B g Track
Tournamint.
One of America's greatest bicycle rulers
is now in this City. He arrived yester
day afternoon, direct from Chicago. He
is Jay Eaton, a champion among cham
pions, especially :it indoor riding, and the
jjreat three weeks' indoor tournament
which is to open to-morrow night at the
Mechanics' Pavilion was the medium that
induced him to oome to this City.
Eaton lias not a peer among indoor
riders. He commenced hi 3 bicycle racing
career two years ago, but his most won
derful worlc was done during 1890, mostly
indoors. During last year he won lifty-one
first?, twelve seconds and twelve thirds.
This Is a wonderful record, but the
amount of hia winnings for last year is
still more to be wondered at He won
exactly #5280, or as much aa Eddie Bald
won. and three times as mucii as any
other indoor rider carried off.
The Call's cycling editor talked with
him for some time Jast night and found
him a very pleasaoi conversationalist.
He is 27 years of age and has been besides
a crack bicycle racer, one of the best
sprinters in the country. He is an excep
tion to the general rule, which is that
footracers seldom become irood bicycle
riders. Wtien in condition he weighs
about 155 pounds, and in his street
clothes does nut look the athlete which ho
appears in his racing suit. He is an ex
ceptionally well-built young fellow and
ihe development oi his thigh muscles is
truiy wonder ul.
He will ride during the entire indoor
meet and wt.l be a great attraction. He
and Becker are old-time rivals, and they
will come together on the lirst night of
the tournament in the five-mile invitation
race for professionals. The race will be a
hot o ip, and as Becker is riding like a
streak a wonderful race can be looked for.
The following is a list of the handicaps
and heats lor the iirst night's racing, with
the exception of the rive-mile club cup
race, which has not been arranged yet:
One mile, amateur handicap, first heatâ P.

third heatâ Fioyd Macfar.aud, Harry Terriil,
George Bovee and Howard Freeman; fourth
beatâ A.lan Jones C. S. Wells, W. E. Backer
and Dun Whitman.
Arrangements nave been made whereby
pools wII oe -did on the races. This has
never been done in this City before, and
no* is a good time to try the experiment.
If this can be done, so that there will be
no trickery, it will doubtless add increased
in'erost to the sport; but of course every
possible cauiion must be taken to prevent
the throwing of races and other things

Effect of the Rivalry of Neiv Photo-
graphic Froces^ea.
The new methods of producing illustra
tions by various photographic "processes"
am excellent in many respects, and are
preferable perhaps to all the oiri methods
when cheapness rather than quality is in
sisted upon. Very fine effects are secured,
in fact, by "process worK." To the great
majority of people the pictures in the
batter class of magazines are perfectly
satisfactory, being vastly superior to the
cheap wood cuts which they displace.
But "as a fine art" wood engravinc, ac
cording to Mr. W. B. Gardner â as quoted
by the Popular Science Monthlyâ still
holds the field and hus an assured future.
It is, he holds, "far and away" superior
to nny process "in its marvelous versatility
of technique, which enables the engraver
to translate not only tht> value, but the
very individual touch of each artist from
whose picture he may be engraving.
"All processes dependent upon photog
raphy are bound to go wrong in the ren
dering of 'values,' since photography has
not yet been brought to such a state of
perfection as to master the difficulties of
exact color translation. In fact, pho
tography is utterly inadequate to the
most s'.mp'e wash drawings in black and
white." Wood engraving in a mechanical
way has had its dny. but as a reproduc
tive fine art it is held to be unapproach
able. "It has not been touched," says
Mr. Gardner, with enthusiasm, ''and
never will be touched by any process yet
invented."
The shortcomings of the photograph
are conceded aiid tne "process engraving' 1
must necessarily share its defects. There
is much difference, of course, between a
good photograph and a bad one â aimost
as much as between a good wood cnt and
a bÂ«d one. But of the best photographic
portrait one o ten hears the remark
made: "A fine picture, but not a lit like
him !"
A dozen different photographs of the
same person may present half a dozen
different faces, each very unlike the
O her. Where colors are lo be reproduced
the results are ttill more false, owing to
the fact that thn several colors act upon
the sensitive film with widely different
degrees oi intensity. Moreover, the per
spective sometimes goes wrong, with the re
sult that neither in values nor lines is
the Photograph to be trusted. An artist's
hand may correct some of its deficiencies,
but to the educated eye many still remain.
"Nothing," says Mr. Uanlner, "does or ever
can compare with the work done through
tin- sensitive medium of the eye and hand
of man. In tact, I consider wood en
graving fir better than any or all the re
productive art*, as it stands quits alone in
its wonderful adaptability, for any variety
of texture one likes can* be produced on
the boxwood biock. This cannot be said
for either etching, mezzo-tint, steel or
copper, great as the musters have been
who have worKed upon one or the orher
of these material*." Each of these mate
rials has its merits, but wood is best.
"The crowning advantage," says the
writer, ''is that the engraver is anableJ to
work in both black and white line. Noth
ing is out of the rangeof imitation." The
skillful artist can render differences in
texture. Fiesb, silk, satin, woo -i, steel,
glass, marble, furs, atmospheric effects
and foliage of all kindsâ all these the
wood engraver can fai hfuliy represent.
What is of like imponance, he can render
the difference between oil and water
colors. New and cheap processes have
not, therefore, displaced the artistic en
graver, though it may have taKen work
from tne les* skillful. This is what might
have been expected in view of the failure
of photography to 1 oust the better class of
portrait painters. No mechanical process
can equal the working of the human hand
guided by genius. Till the camera can
feel and think, as well as see, it must
remain inferior to man in the production
of first-class works of art.â Baltimore Sun.
POUND BY OAK POETESS.
Articles Left in sleepers by Absent-
Blinded . Passengers.
Some curious things are picked up by
sleeping-car porters, and a goodly propor
tion of them are turned over to persons
in authority, to be restored to their own
ers if called for. The "found" bureau of
the Wagner Palace Car Company in this
ciiy often affoidsan interesting study. An
innumerable variety of ticketed articles
there displayed bears ocular testimony to
the freaks of absent-mindedness. There
are pathetic as wall as amusing sugges
tions in these lost articles, for some of
them are obviously mementos of teneer
associations. A baby's tiny worsted shoe,
for instance, found in a sleeping berth
where no baby had been, tells its own
touching li : .tt<Â» story.
E ich article as >oon as it is handed to
tiie custodian of the "found" bureau is
made into a neat parcel and marked with
the day and liour of rinding, name of the
j-ieeping-car, number of tne .rain and the
name of the finder. Most of these mil
laid personal effects are found uiider the
seats or in tiie lavatories of the cars.
Fully two-thirds of the women's belong
ings which are p ck- d up by sleepiug-car
1 oners are toilet articles or jewelry left in
the lavatories.
It was only a few days ago that a Was
ner porter found two valuable finger-rings
in a washbowl. They had been sucked
into the escape pipe iogeiher an^ fortu
nately became wedged there so that they
were not carried away by the outflowing
waver. The owner oi the rings said when
they were re scored to her thin >tie was
"sura i hat Â».ue h;id put them in her
satchel," and seemed quite indignant at
the temerity of the porter in in-isting thai
be nad found t hem in a wnshbowl.
Uniure'ias, canes and shawl-straps con
stitute a majority of the "fin is" in s eep
ing-cars. Tney are ssldoni reclaimed,
although kept by the company's cu>to
dian for a year. Some of the oddities in
the Wagner bureau's collection may be
enumerated as follows: One white satin
slipper, a woman's bead and lace boi.net,
cbating dish, pair o: trousers, two hair
switch*?, one set of false teeth, silver can
dlestick and wax candle, one tine linen
nightrooe, package of perfumed letters
tied with pink ribbons, an ear-trumpet,
on- crutch, and three or lour caged oirds.
Â©Once in a great wh le a pocket-book con
taining money is turned in at the "found"
bureau. Such "Sow 1 are quickly called
for. The loss of money is usually discov
ered bejore tne loser leaves tiie car, conse
quently, if it has been misluid on that
particular car, it is searched for then and
there. Passengers usually feel for their
money the first thing alter awaking in the
morning, and, finding that ail right,
apparently do not tax their minds with
anvthine else. Occasionally, however,
men who carry their money loosely in
their pockets lose it by pulling it out with
a pair of gloves, a handkerchief or a note
book. Not k>ng ago the conductor of a
sleeping-car which had just been emptied
of its passengers in tiie Grand Central sta
tion found $40j in bills Jving on the plat

TOLD OP A BLIND STUDENT.
Attainments Thai Seem Hardly I'ossible
to One Without Sight.
The career of James P. Hamilton, a
blind student at the University of Michi
gan, is in niaav respects a remarkable
one. At on cany age, through an ncci
dcnt, the sight of both 01 his eyes was de
stroyed, and since then he has fought a
surce-shii battle in Me against great odds.
He is the son of the Key. James Hamilton
of Grand Rapids, Mich. He was born at
Hi Rapids, in the same S.ate, October 19,
1872. When 3 years old he fell and struck
the points of a pair of shears into one
eye, and from symptthetic affection and
poor treatment he lost the bight of
both eyes. When he was aboui 10
years old he entered the Michigan
School for the Blind at Lansing, and re
mained there until he was graduated in
the literary course. He also learned the
trades of broom-making and piano-tuning.
He then made a trip to Europe, paying
his own way by mon>y earned at piano
tuning. While in Europe he studied both
French and German, and now he is able
to speak these languages fluently. He
traveled over the most interesting por
tions of the Old World, and he says the
trip was very beneficial in many ways.
On bis re. urn from his trip abroad he
entered Albion College, and from there be
entered the university at Ann Arbor,
where be expects to take tne classical
course. In the summer of 1895 he was
married, and he and bis wife spent the
year in Italy and Greece in study. In
Greece especially be was an object of great
interest. In that country the blind do
nothing but beg, and nothing more is ex
pected of them, and Mr. Hamilton with
his attainments was much admired.
He and his wife were invited to dine with
numerous members of the nobility, and
were sent for by the Que-n. Mr. Hamil
ton is not only an expert piano-tuner, but
is a musician of merit and has testimon
ials from the leading conservatories of
America and the Old World. Every lec
ture that he attends he takes note- of the
subject and his mind is so trained that tie
can remember an ordinary lecture of an
hour's lenih so as to reproduce it from
Ms notes upon returning home. He
writes with the Braille system. With
this he writes about twenty words a min
ute, while on the typewriter for ordinary
correspondence he writes from seventy
to eighty words a minute.

POETICAL COMPETITIONS.
How the Chinese Pass the Time at m
Social Party.
Tcheng-Ki-Tone says in his booK, "The
Chinaman at Home": "Instead of shoot
ing or playing lawn tennis or croquet, our
literary folk as soon as a certain number
of them have a little time to spare, meet
together in turn T at: each other's houses
and give themselves up to poetical tour
naments." This is done in all parts of
China,' out especially, in the province of
Fukien. : ; :
As aoon as the players â¢ are ready a vase
is passed round, and out of it each draws
a sip o; paper, on which is written a word
denoting what part ho. is to take. He
may be examiner, copying clerk or com
petitor. â¢ When this formality is over one
of the examiners takes up a book and
opens it at random. . . â â -.".
Another examiner calls a number, lay
nine. The first examiner reads the ninth
line of tbe page at which he has opened,
and from this line a phrase or word it
chosen as the subject of composition.
Then a second vase is . paced upon the
i table, to which a ball is attached. A thread
hang-* from the bell, and at the end of the
thread is nung a lighted stick of incense.
In about half an hour the stick burns out,
the thread ignites and as it snaps a weight
drops, which at the same instant rings the
bell and closes the lid of the vase. The
time is up, and no more verses can be put
into the urn. rfllMMilfr&BÃHilMÃÃifoqfffs
. Now the clerks pour the manuscripts
out of the urn, copy them all out on the
same sheet of paper, to secure anonymity,
and to submit them to the examiners.
Tue examiners- compare them, decide
upon the best and second . best, and one
of the examiners mounts a kind of desk
and reads or intones the best I one. | Each
candidate may write or drop' into the urn
as many poems as he pleases before the
boll rinps, but has to pay a small lee for
each entry, the money being spent for
paper,, ink and prizes. A second trial
follows immediately, and the two winners
of the first trial are made examiners in
he second one. This may go on lor an
entire afternoon, and in the evening a din

DYSPEPSIA PROOF.
The Â£lklmog Defy All Laws of Hygiene
and Still They Thrive.
Much is said about Ameri' an dyspepsia,
but there is one native race of America
that is certainly not greatly troubled by
the modern curse, say- Popular Science
News. Tae sturdy little Eskimos defy all
the laws of hygiene and thrive. The Es
kimo, like the ordinary dweller in America,
eats until he is saiistieu, but there is this
difference, that he never is satisfied while
a shred of he least remains unconsumed.
His capacity is limited by the supply, and
by that only.
He cannot mnKe any mistake about the
manner of cooking ni-> foo<l, for as a rule
he does not cook it, nor so far as the blub
ber or (at of the Arctic animal :s concerned
about ma metu-'ii ol eating it, for he
simply does not eat it: he cuts it into
long strips an inch wide and an' inch
thick, and then lowers the strips down bis
tiiroat as one ruigLt lower a rope into a
well.
And after all that he does not suffer
from Indigestion. He can make a sooi
moai off the flesh and skin of the walrus,
provision so hard and gritty thai in cut
tine up th> animal the Knife mast be con
tinually sharpened.
The teeth o: a little Eskimo child will
meet in a bit of walrus skin as the teeth
ol American child would meet in the
fL-sh of an apple, and then when the bide
of the walrus is from ball to one and a
half inches in thickness and bears consid
erable rÂ°-etn bl:iMce to the skin ot an ele
pnani. Tae Eskimo child will bite it and
â¢ â¢igest it, too, and never Know what dys
pepsia mean?.
What Lightning Can Do.
Lightning has Deen known to photo
graph objects on the humaa skin â a
phenomenon known as the "lightning
print." Among recorded cases is that of
a sailor, who, while mending his shirt at
the fuot of ttie mast, was struck by light
ning and killed. Wnen the dead body
was undressed '.he imago of a horseshoe
wa - p.ainiy visible upon the uack, the
exact representation of a horseshoe nailed
to ihe ship's mast. Another Bailor, struck
in the same way, had the name of hia
ship marked distinctly on his breast.
Cows, crosses, trees, birds and other ob
jects are said by a writer in an English
magazine to have been photographed in
the same manner. A remarkable story is
told about six sheep killed by lightning
nearÃaib. When the skins of the sheep
were taken off "a fac-simtle of a portion
of the surrounding scenery w*s visible on
the inner surace of each skin."
The only photograph of a lightning
print which has been published repre
sents the arm of a boy who was struck by
lightning in Berwickshire on June 9,
1833. Tne tree he was leaning against
vas struck and the Doy thrown across the
road. When picked np the "impression
of the yew-tree branches was found
plainly marked on his skin."
Theet'fect of l:ghtmng on wearin^aD
paret is very curious and is accounted for
by the supposition that the current trav
els aloiu- the damp surface of the skin,
driving the moisture inio vapor, which,
on account of its expansion, ilowa the
clothes to tatters. Two workmen were
eating dinner under a tree, when a fla-h
cam', severely burning one and stunning
the other. When the stunned man camn
to he felt no pain, but due vered that his
irousers were burning; thai his kpife had
been knocked out of his hand and that .he
steel buckles had been torn from his
shoes. ' He put the fire out and managed
to crawl to the road for assistance.
Professor Tyndall had a story of a lady
who, shutting a window during a storm,
had the gold bracelet on her arm destroyed
by a flash of lightning, which left her quite
unhurt but with a blue mark around her
wrist. Tiie blue mark was oxide ol gold â
all that was left of her bracklet.
As much of Â£400,000 is annually spent
in England on the i uichase of human

n good crop of white hair, this color being
the nir>st niftVult to procure.

A QUESTION OF
TRADEMARK
Such Is the Complaint of
a Munich Corpora
tion.
Charges Filed Against the San
Francisco Brewery
Syndicate.
Damages in the Sum cf $50,000 ani
a Perp tual iDJuncion
Demanded.
A complaint has been filed by thÂ«
"A.ktienbrauerie zum Lowenbrau in
Munchen" against the San Francisco
Breweries (Limited) for $50,000 damages,
it being alleged that the local concern has
unlawfully imitated the product of the
plaintiff, selling the same to the public as
the genuine articleâ a certain beverage
called Lowenbrau, which being translated
means "Lion beer."
The papers in the cause set forth that
the plaintiff is a resident of the city of
Munich, kingdom of Bavaria; that it con
ducts all its business in Munich and has
never had any business agency or repre
sentative in the State of California, in any
of the Pacific Coast States of ihe United
States, and was ignorant and unaware of
the fraudulent practices of the defendant
here mentioned until cine months ago;
that since receiving information of the
fraud, with intent to stop such unlawful
acts if possible, the plaintiff has been en
deavoring through its employes and busi
ness correspondents in various parts of the
country to obtain evidence of such fraud
ulent acts; that said acts are being con
cealed by the defendants, ana that by rea
son of said concealment the plaintiff was
compelled to spend about seven months
in procuring evidence sufficient to verify
the allegations of the plaintiff herein set
forth, and that on securing the necessary
information the present action was
brought with all convenient dispatch.
Alter reciting the c c matters, the plain
tiff, by Attorneys Loewy & Gutsch and
J. M. Nougues, asks for a judgment of
court perpetually enjoining tlie defendant
from exporting, se-ling or offering for
sale, under tho denomination of "Lowen
brau" or "Lowenbrau Munchan," any
beer or beverage manufactured by the
defendant or any other person or firm
other than plaintiff herein; from coun- |
ter;eiting, duplicating or imitating in any j
way whatever the plaintiff's trade mark 1
and applying such counterfeit in any j
manner to any beer or beverage other |
tiian the genuine "Lowenbrau"; from 1
using or applying to any bottle or other j
vessels containing any beer or beverago
o:her than the genuine "Liwenbrau"
any marks or labels so closely resembling
the plaintiff's trademarks or labels as to
be apt to lead the public into the belief
that such mark or labels are those used
by the plaintiff ; from packing any spuri
ous product in bottles, boxes, etc., Â«uch as
are used for packing the genuine "Lowen
brau," or doing anything to deceive the
public into the belief that said spurious
product is the genuine "Lowenbrau."
In addition to demanding $50,000 dim
ages and perpetual injunction, the plain
tiff asks that the defendant 1 enquired to
account to the plaintiff for and to Day j
over to the plaintiff all the profits which j
the defendant may have derived from the
manuiacture ot said bogus beer under the
name of "Lowenbrau" or under said imi
tation trademark or labels.
On reading and filing of the complaint
and tee approval of a bond for $1000, .Pre
siding Judge Seaweil issued a temporary
restraining order enjoining the defendant
and its employes from doing any of the
acts complained of. On the 2d of next
month the defendants are required to
show cause why the injunction asked for
should not be granted.
THE SYMPHONY CONCERT

Miss Gertrud â  Au d-ihoms and Hugo
Manslelct Do Excellent
Wrrk
The Snn Francisco Symphony Society's
fourth concert was a decided success. A
large and fashionable audience was pres
ent, despite the gloomy and unsettled
state of the weather, and from beginning
to end every one was well pleased.
M:Â«s Gertrude Auld-Thomas sang Myer
beer' â  ".-hadow Dmce from Dinorah"
in he. usual delightful manner, receiving
a perfect ttorm ot applause. Raff's Piano
Concerto la C, played by Hugo Mansfeldt,
was well received. Suite "Les Erinneys,"
by Jlassenet, was perhaps the most beauti
ful number on the programme. The sec
ond movement, "Scene Relijrieuse," with
the 'cello obligato by Lmi.s Heine, and the
"Danse Grecque" of the fourth number,
were enihu iustically encored. tscUumann's
"Overture Genoveva" and TrentJsen's
"Norwegian Artists' Carnival" completed
tiie programme.
The next concert, which will be given
May 1, will be devoted to Wapner. There
will be tbe quintet from "Die Meister

AEEESTED FOR MtJRDEB.
Hoty Si Yik Charged With Killing 1.0
How J.aat December.
On the 28:h ol December the body of
Lo How was found hanging by a cord to'
a raiter in a email vacant siabla in the
rear of 826 Stockton street near the build
ing: of the Chinese Consul. At first it was
believed that How had committed suicide,
t:u upon the body being examined at the
Morgue a larcre bullet hole was found back
of tbe right ear showing t!iat he bad been
murdered. An investigation by the
police brought lo light the fact that a few
nights before there had been a terrible
row among che Chinese who lived in the
house in front of the stable. During the
trouble How was murdered and his body
thrown into the back yard and then sus
pended to the rafter.
* The dead man's bedding and effects
were burned on the sidewalk, and before
the crime was discovered the house was
vacated. The murder has remained a
invstery to the police. The case was not
abandoned, for Officer J. W. Capels and
How's cousin, Young Chang, have been
Fteadily at work trying to eet on the track
of the murderers. The first result was
obiaintd yesterday. Ciiang swore to a
warrant charging Hoey Si Yik with
murder. He is said to have been one of
the persons who were present and partici
pÂ«.ed in tie fight on or about Ohri-tma-i
night in which How lost his life. Yik was
arrested yesieriiav by Officer Cartels. It
is likely that several arresis will follow.
THE QUACKENBUSH FIGHT.
In the Frobnte Court Tho Lady De
mands Half of Her Contract Hus
band's 5750.000 Kstate.
Mrs. Nancy Abbott Qiackenbush, by
her attorneys, Rodgers & Fateraon, has
filed a contest to 4he probate of the will of
Thomas M. QuacKenbusti, deceased. The
estate involve i is worth $750,000.
Mrs. Qunckenbush bases tier contest for
half of the property on the ground that
she is the surviving widow of the deced
ent, and declares that when he signed n
paper purporting to devise his estate to
hisdaugiiter, Mrs. Esther E. Swortcguer,
he was not of sound and disposing mind,
and was not mentally competent to exe
cute a valid will.
Alle.-ation is further made that at the
time of the allpjed execution of the will
the deceased was under tne influence of
Mrs. Swortfiguer, who is named as execu
trix and principal devisee; that be waa
coerced by her, and by threats, menace
and frauJ| compelled to sign the said al
leged will.
Some time a^o Mrs. QuacKen bush sued
the late Mr. Quackenbush for $500 a
month as permanent support, claiming to
be his wife by virtue of a contract mat
riage.
Several emertÃ in handwriting exam
ined the contract presented by Mrs.
Quackenbush and declared that it was a
labricated paper, testifying that the sig
nature was genuine, but that the original
writing was an order for goodÂ», and that
after such writing had been erased Mr&.
Quacfcenbnsh had written in what pur
ported to be a marriage contract.
Atter hearing all the teÂ«timony Judge
Seaweil held that the expert! were mis
taken ; that the signature of Quackenbush
was genuine and that he knew what he
was signing, but that Mn. Quackenbush
had no legal standing as a wife, for the
reason that there had been no assumption
ol marital rights and duties of the Darties,
as required by tne luw of California.
Through the new suit the entire matter
will be gone over again in Judee black's
court. In tlie meantime preparations are
being made by Mrs. Quackenbush's law
yers to appeal to thÂ»Â» Supreme Court
against Judge Seaweli's decision in re
gard to the marriare contract.

What San Francisco thinks of Cubans,
cut off from the rest of the world, strug
gling, outraged, yet persistently and loy
ally fighting for freedom, will be expressed
to-morrow night in sentiments indorsed by
her representative citizens assembled in
mass-m eting at Metropolitan Temple and
presided over by the Mayor of this City.
The foregoing are the honorary vice
presidents named lor the occasion.
The greatest enthusiasm is being mani
fested by those primarily in sympathy
with Cuba's cause, and others, actuated
simply by an innate love of liberty, are
heartily and eagerly looking forward to
to-morrow evening.
Exponents of American patriotism and
oratory combined will be there to paint in
graphic wording the conditions that main
tain in Spain's rebellious isle â the hard
ships, the indignities, the ever-present
spirit of patriotism that will not be sup
pressed, the self-sacrificing determination
comparable only to that which over a

A laree part of the population of San j
Francisco put in a good deal of time yes- '
terday <liscus?ine the tight of fights that
has passed into history.
His Greatness was still in Carson pet
ting his wife, baby and butchered lips in
his simple, homely way, and the visible
fragments of the tight that reached town
before night consisted only of one James
J. Corbett, a young man of much skill as
a boxer, and a few well-known citizens,
largely well respected ones, who had seen
the thrilling strangle.
â¢Yes, there was something in additional ;
that was fresh from the famous pHie sta- !
dium of the silver State. In afternoon !
Market-stre*et windows displayed relics to j
Six glittering eyes of passers-by. There j
was one of the ring posts to be seen and j
there were two yards of the rope to which
Corbett clunky and there In plain view 'â 
was a black, rust.* relic that was labeled, j
"the knife that cut this rope at the ring
side.', 1 * " ,"
The public attentou given to t!ie fight
was retrospect. v- ami reflective. Gusliing
rountains of w;s iom and philosophy
opened. Everybody read the newspaper
accounts, everybody gave some expression
of both opinion and sentiment, and an
immense number ot people exhibited a
stock of hindsight.
The first arrivals, aside from Corbett
and the three or four who returned with
iiim night before last, were those who
went on Harry Curoett's special. This
arrived about 4 o'clock, bringing Harry
Corbett, Seconds Delaney and Woods and
me rest o! Corb'.-tt'a eniuurajje. The rest,
or most of them, cot in on the lato even
ing overland ir.un. Every man who had
seen the fight naturally became the center
'â¢â¢" interest wherever he paused ana in
dulged his natural impulse to ten how the
Ik-.d was won :i nil lost and what he saw.

There was the great Bai Masterson, late
of Dodge City and now of Denver, ho whose
terrifying name is translated "law and

against Corbett tiiai time and who backed
Corbett both times, celebrated both l< s

hundred years ago eventually won for the
unpopulous little American colonies recog
nition and separation from an oppressive
distant mother country. There will be
speeches by such men as District Attorney
William S. Barnes, Samuel M. Shortridge,
W. W. Focte, Colonel T. V. Eddy and
W. H. Jordan. Various personalities and
styles of oratory and treatment of the
theme of Cuba Li6re promise a particu
larly interesting series of patriotic and
entertaining speeches.
But those who will go only in anticipa
tion of a forensic treat must needs arrive
early to find seats with the hundreds that
' will crowd the big hall to participate in a
demonstration that will show to little
, Cuba and the world that freedom's winds
: fresh from the Pacific do not blow in vain
through the Golden Gate upon a sympa
thetic people conscious of the troublous
I early times attendant upon the birth of
j freedom in this country.
' There will be bonfires without, and
their acquaintance were largely in evi
dence.
But Fitzsimmons was not here to be I
cheered and followed about the streets by I
crowds to add triumphal proceedings of
any sort to the goings-on about town and
10 somehow add a permeating zest to the
day af.er the fight. Fltzsimmons will
reach the City this morning with his wife,
c-ild. brother-in-law Julian and the rest
of his party. They bave ensaged rooms
at the Baidwin, and that hostelry will be
the lodestone of to-day.
Corbett ate his breakfast in his com
fortable bed, and it suited his private
notion to rise about noon. This event did
not seem at> important as it had been. A
few friends helped brighten the early
afternoon in his rooms at the St. Nicholas,
and about 3 o'clock a carriage wheeled
him away.
Five o'clock found him in Harry Cor
bett's saloon with his brothers, trainer*
and some of his intimate sporting friend?.
He smiled often, sometimes at hearty and
encouraging slaps on the back, and
chatted over the champagne that sparkled
frequently where there was no hilarity.
Tney were paying bets at Corbett's
place and a large and picturesque crowd
of wise men were patiently drifting in one
iong line from tnesidewalK to the cashier's
window far at the iear. The motley strinc
representtd all walks in life, but by the
habiliments and the faces the great ma
jority of tickets were small ones and
thankfully clutched.
'â¢Here, now, if any of youse take tickets
to cash out o' turn I'll stop yez at the
window and send yez to the foot of the
line," warned the young marshal who
formed the line and vigorously plowed
the gangway.
They looked much at the green belt
worn at Carson by Corbett and now above
the bar, and they crowd â  d in a suffocating
way to get a glimpse of Corbett, but there
were no cheers. Corbett looked as well
and as natty as ever, and his face dis
played no matks. Atter a while a carri
age roiled him back to his hotel. The
City was full of his friends who were sad
dened or regretful at his defeat, and every
Jriend whomet him with warm greeting
spoke of thai unlucky acc:dent, and of the
liict that uespi'.e it he was the real cham
pion still.
T.Dere were persistent rumors early in
tneday, Â«i there had been in the after
noon and evening before, that Harry Cor
brtt was poing io "welch" â that in his
confidence in Jim he lind bet money
staked with h:m, and would not be able to
pay ail bets at his poolroom.
The rumor was unfounded and tickets
were cashed promptly ami exoeditionsly
ut Oorb;-it's poolrooms. Harry paid bets
I at Carson day before yesterday and trans*
; ferred the rest of his Carson business here.
: Bets were paid for several hours evening
! i;elore last at his Ellis-street place and
about 11 o'clock yesterday forenoon the
: pavmem of straight tickets was resumed,
to be; continued until all were paid. Late
in ihe afiernoon the payment of Paris
mutuais was ai>o begun.
Harry Corbett stated yesterday that
I bets amounting to about $107, 000 tiad been
placed with him and of this sum $10,000
represented combination Deis. It was his
! ju Igment that the total wagers in this
City on the tight amounted to about
| $150,000.
Harry Corbett does not tell what he b*>t
on Jim further than to vouchsaie the in
: formation that it was his "loose money,"
and for how much Jim backed himself is
likewise without, official report. P. J.
Corbett, the lather, declares that his
| wagers amounted to just $40.
By how much Fiizsimnious is richer and
Torbett poorer by waat happened on St.
Patrick's day w1! not be known for a
euod while, because it oil depends on the
kinetoscope business. Filzsimmons has
ttie $15,000 purse and whatever he may
have won on himself, and he ana Corbett
have an interest in the kinetoscope en
terprise. The figures and terms of the
deal are not public property, but coma
people, who say they know, say that FiU
simmons and Corbett are each to get 15
per cent of the kinetoscope earnings, Dan
Stuart another percentage and the com
pany the rest.
The kinetoscope enterprise promises to
be * brilliant financial success and to
make a mint of money for somebody.

within the hall martial music and martial

Near the platform will be seated the
women of the Cuban League Auxiliary
and their friends.
Upon the rostrum with Mayor Phelan
and the speakers will be seated the hon
orary vice-presidents of the evening, men
chosen from among , bankers, lawyers,
merchants, representative trades unions
and various professions calculated to form
a body thoroughly representative of San
Francisco.
According to the remarks of the of
ficers of the Cuban League peo
ple have now ceased to be occu
pied with thoughts of Carson and can
turn again to a more distant fight with its
more noble purpose. They can now
gather together and in crystallized senti
ments strike an unwarlike but sympa
thetic and helpful blow for Cuba that
must be free.
The day was perfect and the pictures will
bs so, and the world will be tilled wiiii
their exhibitions. Many are curious to
know when they will be along and how
much it will cost to see the fight.
It was learned yesterday that it will
probably be a month before the pano
rama will be ready for the public. The
long negatives are now being rushed to
New York for development and then for
reproJuction in a great quantity. They
will not at first be shown in the ordinary
kinetoscope, but will be displayed every
where by the_ magniscope, which will pro
ject the iuovine scene of battle on screens
on a liie-size scale.
The fight will be reproduced tnus in
halls at stated hours, each production be
ing one entertainment. The company
will sell rights to State* and P. Bacigalupi
is after the Caliiornia right with the ex
pectation of paving about |20,000 for it.
Corbett attended the Orpaeum Theater
last evening and when he appeared with
his wife during the second intermission
he received quite an ovation from the
audience. That great entertainment at
the Pavilion that was too early advertised
for last, evening and which was to have
been Corbett's triumphal reception here
simpiy and quietly was lost in the shuffle.
Tbfe Pavilion had been engaged by Alf
Eliingliouse of the California Theater by
William A. Brady's order, but no deposit
was put up and in the hour of defeat the
affair lapsed without help or notice.
FitZÃimmons has a great histrionic
career open to hfm now. He has already
received several flattering offers from
theatrical managers, one of which has
been telegraphed from Tennessee.
OAKLAND SPORTS RETURN.
Ex-Champion Van Court's Opinion
of the Bit? Fight
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 18. j
The Oakland delegation from Carson ar
rived home this morning. They were all
satisfied with the square sport tbey wit
nessed, but many regretted that they had
not put their money on the other man.
Euuene Van Court, who was formerly
champion amateur boxer and wrestler of
the coast, who was a great Corbett man,
had this- to say to-day: ''The light was
won by Mr-*. Fitzsimruons. Whenever
Fitzsi.nnions went 10 his corner Im wile,
who was only a few feet away, .spoke a few
words to him, and every time they seemed
to make a new man of him. After the
seventh round, in which Fltzsimmons
was very nearly whipped, he fought only
for Mrs. Fltzsimmons. Had it not been
for her presence I beiieve Bob would have
given up in despair and have been easily
Knocked out in the eighth round. Before
leaving Carson Fitzsimmons admitted
that he believed he wus a beaten man
in the sixth round.
"It was a great fight, and undoubtedly
Corbett is the cleverer of the two men. It
was a chance blow that Fitzsimmons
wanted and the chance came. I stilt be
lieve that there is no one to-day superior
to Corbett."
Cbarlev Mautalen, who was in charge of
the special from Oakland, said everybody
wa satisfied that t hey had seen the great
est battled the age." "There is not the
slightest question," he said, "but that
Corbeit is by lar the better man. All the
Oakhuiders 'iad a good time, though some
of them did not como home with as much
money as they expected. The trip was
well worth taking and the fight could not
nave been more scientific."
George McDonald, the well-known fire
man of engine 1, was a Fnzsimmons man,
and he came home with enough coin to
enable him to retire for several weeks.
Alt i.ousjh the majority of Oakland visitors
only paid for $5 seats, they were occupy
ing $40 chairs before the affair was over.
When once the excitement started no
deputy sheriff- on earth could have pre
vented the crowd from surging from the
rear of the arena to the many vacant
seats near the rine. In this regard tha
local delegation certainly got the worth of
their money.
A.cx. Hirschberp, n rabid Corbett man,
put up quite* little money at the rinÂ°

J. H. LONG DISBARRED.
Judge Wallace Wanted to Punish
Nicholas Brennan's Attorney for
I>eaertlng Him.
Judge Wallace made an order yesterday
directing that Attorney J. H. Long be
debarred from practicing his profession in
Department 6 of the Superior Court, over
which the jurist named presides.
Nicholas firennan, charged with extor
tion and placing a iemale in a house of
ill repute, was called on to proceed with
his trinl. It was explained tp the court
that Brennan was not ready to go ahead,
as his attorney, Mr. Long, hart deserted
him at the eleventh hour; that Long bad
been paid $~0 and wanted $.30 mure; that
Brennan was not able to pay the sum de
manded and Long had left him in the
lurch.
Judge Wallace said he was sorry he
could not reach the derelict attorney in
some way, as he was deserving of severe
punishment. He deemed it a duty to pro
vide against a recurrence of such a dis
graceful episode in his court, and in
structed Clerk Salomon to note a minute
order that Long should not hereafter be
permitted to practice law in that depart
ment.
Brennan's trial was postponed, in order
to give him a chance to hire a lawyer to
conduct his defense.

The stage that runs between San Quen

SAVED BY HIS
ATTORNEY'S SKILL
Lee Ah Lucy Owes His
Neck to Attorney
J. Â£. Richards.
A Practical Victory Won in a
Compromise Verdict of
Manslaughter.
He Was Accustd of Murdering Ong
Ah Churg Last N vemberâ The
Case Hard Fcugbt.
By the intricate mechanism of the law,
aided and abetted by the forensic elo
quence of Attorney John E Richards, Lee
Ah Lucy stands to-day convicted of man
slaughter. Lucy is thankful for this, as
any client should be under the circum
stances â not that he was convicted of
manslaughter, of course, but that he
escaped banging.
Lucy was charged with the murder of
Ong Ah Chung, which occurred shortly
after midnight on October 6, 1896. The
trial has been in progress in Judge
Dunne's court for ten days and was a
j buttle royal.
Tne i rosecution was represented by
Deputy D strict Attorney Hinkle, M. M.
Foote and Judge C. B. Darwin, the de
fense by John E. Richards.
Day before yesierday Attorney Foote
strove in every way to convince the jury
that the defendant was guilty of Chung's
murder. He succeeded, for everybody be
lieved the jury was won over.
At about 3 v v., immediately after
Foote had finished, Richards stepped to
the fore and began his argument.
He began colloquially in a low but
distinct voice. It is doubtful if he had
ever seen one of those jurors before the
trial began, but he seemed to know them
all. It was not long till the astute attor
ney had gained his pointâ that jury was
interested.
The monotony was broken and be was
free to arctic. One by one the points
made by the prosecution were placed
under tbo microscope of logic and dis
sected, and as be proceeded the grim
looks of <leteraii nation on the laces of the
jury began to solteu and finally to cloud.
It waa plain to see that there were a few
points they bad overlooked.
Le<) Ah Lucy was seen by three Chinese
witnesses to shoot dowu the street; was
beard to mention the name of Chans as
be did so; wa* seen to hand his pistol to
a comrade, who vanished across the street,
and then he was eea to run, throwing a
fully load d pistol into a basement as he
did so. But were those witnesses friendly ?
It was proved by the attorney that they
belonged to a rival laction, men who
would swear a rival's life away for a song.
And why carry two pistols? Sever had
the police in all their experience known a
highbinder to carry two pistols.
So it went on. As the attorney finished
bis argument he rose to a burst of elo
quence that increased the cloud of doubt
that obscured the minds of the jnry on the
most important points, and the deed was
done.
Slowly Judge Darwin arose tr> bis feet,
and addressing the court stated that there
were a few things in Attorney Richards'
argument he Had not thought of, and

would like until trie next day to consider.
The court refused to grant more than a
ten minutes' recess.
When court attain convened, Attorney
Richards requested, in behalf of the jury
and opposing counsel, that the case be
laid over till the next day. Judge Duune
agreed.
Yesterday Judge Darwin argued for an
hour and a half, and then the court gave
his instructions to the jury. It was the
most important criminal case over which
Judge Dunne has yet presided, and he
was very careful in his instructions, which
were full but fair.
The jury on the first ballot stood six for
conviction of murder and six for acquittal.
After st-veral ballots they at lengtn com
promised on a veidictof manslaughter,
the very lowest decree of homicide, and
March 27 was fixed as the time for sen
tence.
This was a virtual triumph for the de
fense, and even thf jurymen, in congratu
lating Attorney Richards on his argu
ment, stated that they would have voted
for murder in the first degree if he bad
not succeeded in rfiisine: such doubts that
they could not conscientiously do so.
So Lucy has t;ood reason to be a thank
ful Chinaman.
