LONDON. Eug., March 27.â The Sun
â will tomorrow publish a dispatch from
Athens saying the Crown Prince Con-
Btantine finally started for the frontier of
Thessaiy tail evening. There was a
pathetic parting between himself and the
mem born of his family, they aeeming to
fully realize the import of the undertak
ing. The fact that he was to leave to
assume command of the Greek forces
which are now confronting the Turks on
Ihe frontier became known to the public
come time previous to his departure. The
streets in the vicinity of the palace were
jammed with people, who frantically ac
claimed the Crown Prince when he ap
peared. The .wildest eiaiiusiasni was
everywhere displayed, and the crowds
shouted for war until they were hoarse.
CAtfKA, Crete, March 27.âNotwith
standing the s-upport famished the Turks
by the, foreign fleets, the Christian insur
gents have captured all the strategic posi
tions around ihis city except the town of
Outsonnaria, which commands the spring
that supplies Canea with water. Special
efforts w;Il be made to prevent the capture
of Ouisonnarla, for if it should fall into
the bands of the insurgents they would,
by being able to cut off the water supply,
be practically masters of Canea.
Cabnonadmg was heard throughout the
day in tLe direction of Ahkianu, where is
situated the camp of Colonel Vassos, the
commander of the Greet army of occupa
tion. The firing added to the fears of the
Moslems here, who thought that the
insurgents and Greek troops bad combined
and wauld make an attack upon Canea.
The Moslem refugees have little faith in
the ability of the powers to save them
pbouict such an attack ba made, but there
is really scarcely any danger that the
Greek troops will advance nearer to the
town than they are now. No explanation
of the tiring has been given.
MUCH MISCHIEF AHEAD.

LONDON, Esq., March 27.â Prime Min

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
ing, will stay in the south of France sev- 1
eral weelts. There he will guide Great
Britain's diplomacy in silence, having
neither the Cabinet to consult nor the
opinion of the country to consider. Con- j
servatives and Liberals alike are fretting j
under the prolonged reticence of Lord
Salisbury in di closing his Eastern policy.
The Radicals are very indignant and are
trying to raise a popular agitation, which,
if Parliament were approaching Ha natnra
term, wouM work no end of mischief to
the Government. It may be no fault of
Lord Salisbury that be does not explain
his policy clearly to the British public.
Prudence may excuse his silence, but on
all sides it is felt that his persistent ignor
ing of the demands of members of the
House of Commons for information as to j
bow Great Britain exactly stands toward .
the European powers is largely due to his
known contempt for popular opinion when
Le thinks he can afford to show it.
Safe in the confidence reposed in him
by his majority in both houses, he can
jut up his colleagues in the lower house I
to evade questions or decline to answer,
&nd to balk debate on points which are
cf the most momentous interest to the
country.
It has been often stated that even Cab
inet Ministers are not in Lord Salisbury's
confidence. He is understood to consult
Vitb or communicate to Balfour, Sir
Michael Hicfcs-Beach, Chamberlain and
the Duke of Devonshire all important
steps he may dacide upon. But even thi
ianer Cabinet has little or no power in
shaping his policy.
There probably never was a Prime Mm
ister or Foreign Secretary in English Par
liamentary history who so entirely playec
"off his own bat" and who staked the in
terest of his country with so little defer
ence to the opinions of bis Cabinet.
The dissatisfaction in Parliament onl;
partly reflects the discontent throughou
ti;e country. More and more the tide of
sentiment is rising in favor of Greece,
which is even in pronounced Unionist
papers declared to have been treated
with scant respect, justice and human
ity. The general discontent has
been intensified daring the current
week by the prospective mixed occupation
of Crete turning out be not the pacific
mode of settlement which the diplomatic
jugglers promised it would be; and by the
persistence of Greece in asserting herself
against the Porte and the powers. The
occupancy threatens to be a very mixed
affair, with no common plan of operations
disliked and misunderstood by the Creta
population and carried out by the troops
the best portion of whom detest their work
Asthepioc*sj of pacification develop
the prospect may brighten up. But on
of the first measures proposed to giv
Crete a chance of internal peace â the con
stitution of an autonomy underacomoe
tent chiefâ is not within sight. The few
reliable press correspondents who are wir
mx from Canea and other points concu
in stating that autonomy means to th
Cretan Christians the root and branch
extirpation of the Moslems and amon
their notables a free Acquisition of mor
land.
Massacre and spoliation are described a
the first principles of Cretan patriotism
among Moslems and Christiana alike
though it muat be acknowledged that dis
plays of this sort of patriotism have here
tofore been a special privilege of th
Moslem population, upheld by Turkis
bayonets.
The Paris Journal dcs Debats to-da
publishes a letter from an officer of th
French squadron which shows, if true
an awful condition of affairs. This offi
cer declares that the facts he set fort
in his letter are vouched for by the sur
geons of the cruiser, who are performing
duties ashore.
He declares that many Moslem children
of tender age have been violated by so
called Christians, that boys have been
frightfully mutilated and babies slashed
with sabers. He adds that in war the
Cretan Christians resembled wiid beasts.

I than it has the statesmen of the other
European Governments. The lead of
i English, and French opinion is so
distinctly in favor of appointing a
| Greek Prince to administer Cretan affairs,
| that neither lord Salisbury nor the
I French Minister can risk defying it.
{ Russia has aims of its own apart from
i justice to Greece or the pacitication of
I Crete. 60, while the proposals of Eng-
I land have successiveiy bad reference te
the nomination of Prince George oi
Greece and to Prince Mavrocordato and
I those of France to either of these or to
Prince Waldemar of Denmark, Russia,
( with its imperial supporters in Ger
many and Austria, has put forward
i first Boso Petrovitch and next Prince
\ Danilo, both Montenegrins in the actual
;. pay of the Czar.
Undoubtedly the selection of a Greek
prince as Governor would help to appen.se
; the Cretans. There are now 4U,0000f iheia
! under arms, capable under Greek officers
I of offering desperate resistance to a mucli
I greater number of troops than can be em
ployed under the mixed occupation. If
the Cretans feel obliged to lij:ht the occu
pation will end in a bloody fiasco, and
with Greece at bay against the Turks on
the frontier the European mess will be
come worse than ever.
The news from the scene of trouble in
Southeastern Europe is very unsatisfac
tory in character and is full of contradic
tions. It is reported that the powers
have agreed to blockade t l<e Greek coast,
and that King George of Greece has an
nounced that iuch a blockade will be the
signal for 1 ffensive operations by the
Greefc troops. Germany is reported to
have withdrawn from the combination of
powers, and Russia is said to be dissatis
tied. In the meantime the forces of
Greece and Turkey on the frontier are
being strengthened, and there seems little
chance of a neutral zone being agreed on.

Complication* of the Power* Only Aid
Kins George* Cause. -
NEW YORK, N. V., March 28.-A
special cable to the Herald from tit. Peters
burg sayÂ«: â¢
The Greeks are overflowing with joy at
every one of the further complications
which follow the efforts of the powers to
establish order in Crete, and reports are
made that this sentiment of exultation has
given rise to a strong feeling that Greece has
been encouraged in her refusal to aid the
powers by their overindulgence, and in
consequence a policy of greater severity
will soon be forthcoming, even if ' one
power were to fall out or the concert. â¢
The Is'ovce Vremya, which now repre
sents fairly Russia's fixed policy, says:
"The blockade of Greece must be has
tened, even 11 England stands aloof. All
means are good to bring good sense home
to the Greeks.
"The only danger is in a conflict be
tween the Greeks ana Turks. We must
let the Greeks know they must renounce
that desperate step and give up ambitions
for which they started the Cretan agita
tion."
AID FOR GREECE.
King: George's Friends Among the
Sultan's Subjects.
The condition ol affairs in European
Turkey is such as may well cause the
greatest anxiety on the part of those dip
lomats who are bent on averting tno
threatened strife, and for (he present at
least preserving the integrity of the Turk
ish empire.
When in 1869 the Bultan threatened
Greece with war unless she withheld her
sympathy and support from the Cretans,
then engaged in a struggle for liberty and
annexation with Greece, the latter coun
try was comparatively we tic, and to at
tempt to cope with the overwhelming
odds without the support of one or more
of the other European countries would
have been but to invite invasion and a
repetition ot the scenes of barbarity and
destruction that characterized the war of
independence from which she hid yet
hardly iecovered,and would probnbly have
involved her independence itseli. When ]

the representatives of the great powers of
Europe therefore in the conference at
Paris January, 186y, declared that in case
of war between Turkey and Greece
their respective countries would remain
simple spectators and preserve a strict
neutrality between the two, Greece bad
nothing left to do but submit to the de
mands of the Porte to leave Crete to the
further mercy of EurODean diplomacy and
Turkish pleasure and bide the will of
providence.
The eighteen years that have intervened
since then, however, have wrought great
changes in the power and resources of the
two countries, and in a struggle between
them the odds would not be so very great
and probably in fivor of the Greeks,
backed as they would be by the sym
pathies of the peoples of Europe if not by
their Governments.
Since 1869 the resources of Turkey have
decreased, while those of Greece have
steadily grown. In 1869 Turkey in Europe
included more than three time* its present
area and population, the various events
culminating in the war ol 1877-78 with
Russia, and the result of that war took
from the Sultan two- thirds of his
European domain, with a like proportion
of his subjects, and his rule in Europe is
now confined to an area of about 64 000
square miles, with a population oi less
than five millions.
In 1869 Greece bad a population of
1,300,000 only, and her northern boundary
ran coincident with the southern bound

EX-MAYOR SUTRO GIVES THE
6IAD HAND.
And Mayor Phelan, Arthur Rodgers,
President Kellogg and O.hers Add
Their Congratulations.
Under a leaden sky in a drizzle of rain,
with auil gray clouds drifting in over the
Golden Gate, with the white teeth of the
surf gnashing at the foot of Point Bonita,
the cornerstone of the Affiliated Colleges
of the University of California was laid
yesterday afternoon.
It was "the gray day" beloved of the
artistic soul, and from the college site lay
a panorama of entrancing loveliness which
can nowhere else be found at the feet of
any of the other great or email cities of
the United States.
The masses of cypress, pine and euca
lyptus woods hiding the smooth roadways
of Golden Gate Park spread attractively
in the foreground, with Strawberry Hill
in the west, coliseum-crowned, and be
yond lay the Goiden Gale and the leaden
colored waters of the Pacific, over which
loomed through the Hying mist the
scarred blue peak of Tamalpais and green
hills of the Marincoast.
Because of the rain not many people
came to the site. Even Governor "Bndd,
who takes so great interest in tbe univer
sity, remained away and sent the Lieu
tenant-Governor to represent him, which
be did humorously and modestly, and was
cheered for it by the boys. They seemed to
take a great liking to Â»he practical-looking
man from Santa Cruz and gave him the
college yell lustily.
The Ancient and Honorable Order of
Masons, many of whom were ancient in
years, braved the rain and marched l>oUl
iy up the steep slopes from tbe Haight
street entrance to the parK to the college
site, made gay win streamers of blue
and sold and with flags of all the na
[ tions, making rainbows on the dark green
background of cypress and pine.
The ceremonies were interspersed with
music by tlie band and Binding by the
Masonic Choir, composed of Samuel D.
Mayer. J. R. Ogilvie, J. F. Fleming and
J. G. Jones. The Grand Lodge of Masons
gathered around tbe cornerstone, and.
conducting the Masonic ceremonies were:
William T. Lucas, grand master; Thomas
Mint Jr., deputy rranci master; F. N,

After prayer by Right Rev. William F.
Nichols, D.D., Martin Kellogg, president
of the university, spoke as follows:
A university cannot be fully organized with
out pioiessioiial schools. It exists for study,
but studies must give preparation for life.
Higher education usually lends to an active
liio wor*. Tiie majority of students enter the
proicssions.
There are nowadays many new professions,
Im the oid ones still hold their place of
honor. Theology cannot be taught, in a State
university, but law and medicine can be
taught and should be taught. Their special
studies should be of a hirh character.
Tne University of California tans been ready
to welcome atti iated professional colleges of
law and medicine; the latter profession hav
ing also thrown off other branches of medical
and surgical science. The uuiversity has not
confined its welcome to these; it has a place
in its family for art and specialized science, as
at Mount Hamilton, and the higher practical
applications of science 10 the business world
and to public life. But tha university claims
a foremost place for law and for meaicine,
both in its original branch of science and in
its later established branches.
Years ago an effort was made to provide our
colleges of law, ot medicine, of dentistry and
of xiharmacy with a suitable common home.
Each of these was vigorous and- growing, but
unable to secure the best accommodations.
A request for aid was made to the State Legis
lature. Twice it received favorable treatment
from the two houses, but was not welcomed at
the executive threshoid. Two years ago thin
request wax repeated and an appropriation of
$250, 000 received the signature df Governor
Budd.
Still, a site wns needed, and there was a
further delay. Then came the offer of Adolph
Sutro. which fixed the location of tnese col
leges on this commanding and beautiful site.
The gladness with which this noble Rift was
welcomed Is shown in the vote of thanks to
Mr. Sutro passed at a meeting of the Board of
Regents held May 19, 1896. / ;
Mr. KellocÃ then read the resolution,
and in conclusion said: - ..--,'
And so we are here to-day to lay. the corner
stone of a building for- which we have long
waited; one oS a group 01 buildings accommo
dating five ot these professional colleges. It
is an occasion for great and high satisfaction
on the part of us all. . 'â '.'â .'.
Long may these buildings stand as a monu
ment to the beneficence of the State and of the
donor iof this fine site. Long may the facul
ties of these colleges see accomplished practi
tioners ' go ; forth from . these , halls to take an
honorable and useful part in active life. ' : .
-To the ancient: and honorable order which
has laid the cornerstone of so many temples of
(science and art and industry," and which has
kindly volunteered to officiate here to-day, we
now turn for the proper and distinctive cere
monies of this occasion.
1 The cornerstone was then laid with Ma
sonic ceremonies, Dr. Cole handling the
trowel with the skill of an expert. ; On the
front of the stone was carved the following:
inscription:
: Erected by the State â  ,:
â  . . For the University of California, :
,: . ,:, ' MDCCCXCVIL : :
Mayor Phelan was then introduced and
spoke as follows: .. . ,
; San Francisco is not insensible to the sig
nificance of this occasion. The people ;of â¢ the
State, 9 represented ; in . . the . Legislature, : have
generously provided for the erection of bullc
ings to house the Affiliated Colleges of the
University of California In this City. The
colleges : .: have been â¢ , : ., domiciled : among
us for many years. Some were established

PRICE FIVE CEJSTS.
the bounty of our citizensâ Toland, Hust
ings and Sutro; others were made necessary
by the progress of the professions and the in
creasing numbers who knocked at the door of
knowledge.
To bring these schools together and dignify
and strengthen tne higher education by the
erection uf a suitable temple for its service
and pursuit was tbe gracious duty of tba
State, which watches over the university like
a fostering mother.
As the State lakes a pride in its university,
so should it take a pride in its metropolis, it
is the aim aud object of San Francisco to be
worthy of that distinction. SidtÂ» by side with
the development of California's ' matchless
material resources the development ot the
true resources of civilization must go on.
This work is the peculiar function of a great
city â the hive of intellectual activity. A me
tropolis should be, and it is, the meeting
place of the many who seek those things
which the presence of a large population en
courages, and even makes possible, as, in their
highest sense, an, science and literature, mu
sic and the drama; and there they find col
leges, libraries, museums, hospitals and
courts for illustration and instruction. A
metropolis is the finished work of all the arts.
Concentration in these matters is necessary
to promote the highest efficiency ana secure
the best results. That concentration must be
somewhere, and the State to-day says to San
Francisco, â¢'Prove worthy of my trust."
The quest Of knowledge is thus facilitated,
and the commingling of many minds, by which
we freely give and freely r eceive, takes off
their rough edge*, broadens by contact and
creates an atmosphere of liberality in thought
and action. That is the mission ol city and
university alike.
And now as England looks with patriotic
pride to London town, Germany to Its imperial
capital and France to the beautiful city of
Paris, as being tne centers of their civilization
aud their heralds to the world, so should Cali
fornia uphold every worthy effort of Ssn Fran
cisco to provide the world's delights, advan
tages and opportunities, and to possess all tbe
facilities made poss-ible by modern progress
here at home, by the waters of the Pacific, tor
the use and enjoyment of the people of our
State.
If that be accomplished California, richly
endowed as she is by nature, will be a truer
and better mother to her children, and, by
gratitude and loyalty, the laeaof home will be
nieraciicubly engrafted in the minds of thegene
rations which are to loilow. Here they will
stay, ana if they go forth it will be to teach.
Ex-Mayor Sutro, who was introduced as
the next speaker, was received with a
round of cheers. He spoke as follows:
I This is a memorable occasion for the inhab
itants of the City of : Sau Francisco ; we see
assembled here the representatives of the in
telligence, the progress and the advancement
of our own generation and the harbingers of
those who will come after us for centuries.
- This spot is favored by nature. It is situated
in the geographical center of the Clcy of San
Francisco: just about three miles lrom the
ocean, three miles to the north shore, three
miles to the Day, and three miles to the County
line. â  - â¢
Spread out before us we behold as beautiful
and lovely a landscape as one could imagine;
at our very feet Golden Gate Park, with its
green lawns, rising trees and winding paths,
while strains of music float softly through
the air.
To the westward the grand' Pacific Ocean
with its steamers and Bailing crait coming
from and going to all parts of the globe, to the
north the Golden Gate with its fortifications,
and in the background Maria County with its
romantic hills, Tamalpais looming up above
them all; to the east we see the settled pan
of San Francisco, with its mass of cheerful
looking dwellings, its mansions, the massive
business structures and steeples rising up in
every direction.

the future center of knowledge and learning

In the absence of Governor Budd, Lieu
tenant-Governor Jeter was intioduced.
He was well received, and his humorous
remarks were interrupted by applause.
He said:
When I left my home this morning iv the
beautiful city of Sauia Cruz, where the sun
shine is perpetual and wnere nature w-8s
wearing her mosi pleasing and winning smile,
I felt at that time that she was rejoicing over
the occasion that is now being celebrated
here. As I approeched the sreat city oJ Ban
Francisco I found that nature was more and
more affected, and hero we find that she is so
much overjoyed that the tears are running
down her cheeks.
1 feel that 1 am a sort of affiliated structure
myself on this occasion. 1 had intended to
tome here as a matter of pleasure and of pride
as a citizen of California. I also expected to
be here as a matter ot duty, as an ex-officio
member of the Board oi Kegents, but 1 iind
myself here simply as an apology, aad regret
to'fcave to regret that the Governor cannot be
present. I didn't discover this fact until after
tho hour vi 1 o'clock this afternoon, and I had
not then partaken of any lunch. I have not
yet done so, but I wish to assure you mat the
Governor oi this great State is with you in
hear:, in sentiment and in spirit to-day.
His engagements were such that he could
not be personalty present, but he has shown
himseli in sympathy with every movementfor
the advancement oi the educational interests
of California and with the University of Cali
fornia, of which tie Is an early graduate, and
ai all times he has aided substantially iv es
tablishing and helpiug to build up tne schools
oi this Stateâ the public schools and the uni
versity.
1 was pleased to discover, as I waited from
the railroad cars up here, that there was such
a lar^e representation oi students of the uni
versity here and a total absence of any pul
monary trouble. I doubt not tuat the very
best results will follow this undertaking.
Now, having made my apology, 1 think I
have lully performed all ihaÂ» wus expected of
me, and theretore will leave others to rejoice
with you and with all others at th^ mood in
which nature is on this auspicious occasion.
Arthur Rodgers wa3 the next speaker.
He said:
This is a historic day. It is one for profound
satisfaction to the people of this State ; oi dis

From the point ot view of the regents this
occasion is one of much meau :g. Tneirpohcy
in directing tne expansion of the university
has been greatly influenced by the situation
and resources of our Sta;e, as well as by tlie
intelligence, enterprise and character of our
people. By lincageand social and politicalchar-
KCter we belong to the Atlantic; b>- geography
we became denizens of the Pacific, whose ex
panding conquest we have oniy begun; and by
<oniuu-ree we are related to the whole world.
Mountain and desert and seaenviron us; our
history and traditions, our industries and re
sources isolate us from the rest oi our country
and our ancestral homes.
This isolation leads to a more comprehen
sive view of all the educational institutions oi
our state. It affords & favorable opportunity
for a survey of our educational, landscape.
Looking over our fctate we see above the com
mon schools about one hundred public high
schools and forty private academies and thirty
colleces and proiessioual schoo.s besides the
unive s;ty. Some plan which will secare the
greatest efficiency and co-operation of these
various schools will be evolved, and more
than a beginning has been made. At present
our university not only provides opportunity
for the learning and. investigation which
other great universities afford, no: only aids
in the solution oi the industrial, practical and
distinctive problems of our commonwealth,
but it also sects to unite in harmonious effort
all the educational institutio is of our State.
Already hnlf of the public high f-chools and
academies which take me pupils as prepared
in the common and gran, mar schools are asso
ciated with the university. Their courses of
htudy and standards ot teaching are ex mined
and approved 07 the university professors
and their graduates aamitted to the university
without further examination. The plan pro
posed by Governor Budd that the several nor
mal schools of the Stale adapt their in
struction so as to lead their aspiring students
into the university at once makes these ad
mirable State schools a part ot the university.
During the past tweuiy years one by oue
here and there various profest-ional schools
have been affiliated with the university. Each
in its own halls and in varying progress has
grown strongly end for several years has been
groping toward organic union with the
others, and now these six or se7en separate
colleges are to be associated here with a
broMder standard and intenser enthusiasm.
A new university is fouuded. The completest
j.p f-ss:onal university on thia continent is
started on its career.*
Besides the several affiliated institutions
here represented others are now seeking such
union with the University. The Affiliated
colleges thus iar admitted are located in San
Francisco, but location should not be essential
to such affiliation. By co-operation, courses
of lectures could be given in rotation in
Berkeley, Chico and San Francisco; libr ries
and appaxHtus could be leaned so as to be of
most benefit; unnecessary duplicate investi
patlons and investments could be avoided.
We appreciate the excellence of the work and
influence of many of the other independent
collegiate inititutions in the State. Iv time
they will recognize the high mibsion of the
5-tate Unlveri.it>- in organ:zing all her educa
tional forces and will seek closer afhliatlon
with us, whether they are situated in ix>s
Angeles, Napa or Santa Clara.
But some of the pretended colleges of th"
State do not deserve this rank. They should
be compelled to assume their true grade of
academy or high schools. Whea our people
appreciate betier what a college should be
and the economic and stimulating advantages
of a harmonious system of education they wilt
by law prohibit the assumption of coltegiato
or other advanced educations rank by any
institution until so accredited by the Univer
sity of the State.
Notwithstanding some incongruities we now
have the completest system of State schools in
this country, but when all our advanced
schools shall be ranked according to merit,
and when to the affiliations already made
there shall be added in fraternal zeal the
worthy private institutions of the collegiate
gredo we will feel that the University goes to
every home and interest, and that she is the
alma mater not only ot her actual students,
but of all the people of the future California.
The exercises were concluded by a hymn

First Open Cut Made by the Missouri
Pacific -Road.
CHICAGO, 111., March 17.â The first
open fiat cat rates since the anti-associa
tion decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States was made by the Missouri
Pacific Railroad. It made a rate of 33%
cents on eggs in car lots from all Kansas
points to St. Louis, subject to the Mis
souri River minimums.
This is a proportional rate on through
business east of the Western trunk-line
termini and to intermediate points there
of. The tariff rates are raised from 35 to
75 cents per 100 pounds. It is understood
that the Western lines will publish an
equalizing tariff as soon as the Missouri
Pacific's rate, which is effective next Mon
day, is made known. r ihe effect of this
cut will be to send 300 000 cases of eggs
ior stornge from Chicago houses to cities
east of Pittsburg and Buffalo.
The cause of this cut is the withdrawal
of roads from the freight associations, and
the effect will be to demoralize the whole
Western freight ra*,e situation next week.
Chicago roads have secured from the
Interstate Commerce Commission the sus
pension of the long ana short haul clauses
of the act sd far as passenger business
from Canadian points to the Koote
nai cold fields in British Columbia
is concerned, because Canadian Pacific
road put into effect a reduction of from
$4 to $8 from points in Eastern Canada to
the gold fields. This suspension means
that the Canadian cut will now be met via
Chicago.

SLOW PROGRESS
WITH THE BILL
Five More Pages of the
Dingley Measure Dis
posed Of.
Wide Range of the Discussion
Taken Coveriug Varied
Propositions.
Seme Democratic Members of the
House Have Decided to Vote
for Protection-
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.â The
House in the committee of whole pro
ceeded even mora slowly in its considera
tion of the tariff bill to-day than ypster
day, having disposed of but five and a half
papes, against eight and a half the day
before. Tlie dilatory method of handling
the bill provoked Johnson (R. ) of Indiana
to protest against the irrelevant discus
sion, which impeded progress and in
which the members of the Committee of
Ways and Means in charge of the bill in
dulged as well as the Democrats, and to
ask Chairman Dingley if a change couhl
not be made which would result in more
rapid work. When the House entered
upon its work this morning there was not
a quorum present, as revealed by a vote.
After a wait of fifteen minutes ten mem
bers appeared.
The discussion to-day took a wide range,
covering the propositions that the for
eigner pays the tax under a protective
tariff; that a duty on hoga would be more
beneficial to the farmer than all the duties
in the agricultural schedule; that pig iron
can be produced in Alabama and Tennes
see in competition with the North and
foreign countries with a smaller duty than
$i a ton. although no motion was made to
reduce it, so that trusts are in the main
beneficial to the consumer. A3 a result of
the day's work a few immaterial changes
were made in the chemical and earthen
ware schedules proposed by the Commit
tee on Ways and Means, and at 4:15 the
House adjourned until Monday nest at
10 a. m.
The necessity o'. the continued presenco
of a quorum of the committee of the whole
was ueiiK.'iistra:tii at the beginning of to
day's session of the House.
To the first paragraph that was read
after the House had gone into committee
on the tariff bJI, Richardson (D.) 01 Ten
nessee mcvea an amendment reducing the
duty on wiimng from 1 cent to U cent.
On the division the vote was â ayes 14,
noes 37, and on the announcement Rich
ardson made the point of no quorum.
Chairman Sherman counted slowly and
in ten minutes wai enahleJ to announce
101 members present and ttiat lixtiard
son's amendment had been rejected. Ti:e
duty ou acetate of lead (wnite and in
colors) was increased % cent a pound â
to 4 cents from o}4 cents.
Richardson caned attention to the in
crease cf rates proposed in tfca pending
bill on the articles in the chemical sched
ules, and in reply to Docsery (D.) of Mis
souri said the duties in the Diu^ley bill
were absolutely greater ti.an iv the Me-
Kinley bill. He gave in detail the aver
age Per centum of duties on the several
schedules â fourteen in numberâ showing,
as he claimed, an increase all along the
line.
Dingley, responding to Richardson, said
bis speech showed how a juggling with
figure* could be made to show au ap
parent increase of dutie.-, when in fact
there was an actual decrease. Lxeeptupon
earthenware, glass, toDncco, sugar and
silks, the duties in the pending bill were
less than those in the McKinley bill, and
in many other pchedules the duties were
the same as those of the present bill.
Dockery said that a bill that increased
the taxation upon the people $113,000,000
and imposed an average rate of 5703 per
cent, while the Wilton bill was but 39 04
per cent and the McKinley bill 49.58 per
cent, was likely to cause the people to call
attention to it frequently and forcibly.
Hopkins (R.) of Illinois â The bill pro
poses to incre-ise the revpnne of the Gov
ernment $113,000,000, not by the taxation of
the people, becausu we beiieve the bulk of
that sum will come from the toreigner who
pay the taxs. [Loud Democratic langhter.]
And if the gentlemen had taken as long
to study the question as they have to per
fect the guffaw they would know it to be
true.
Replying to a question Hopkins said the
reason why no duty was pui on hides was
because they were a by-product. No one
raised cattle for the hides, but Jor the meat
products; ana the country could not pos
sibly produce enough hides or mors than
a small percentage to mcci the demands
of trade. They had been on the free Jist
since 1873 and the consensus of opinion
was that there shouid not be a change.
Simpson (Pup.) of Kansas said that if a
dutj* was imposed on hides it would do
the farmer more good !han the duty on
any article in the agricultural schedule.
He discussed briefly the proposition that
the foreigner pays the tax and suggested
that the experience of the people wouid be
that the foreigner wouid object and would
refuse to do it. In conclusion he said:
"Iv mv boyhood days I read of the labors
of the early Republicans in behalf of hu
manity and human rights. Among the
prominent leaders of the party then was
the venerable ex-SDeaker of this House
from Pennsylvania (Grow), and I rejoiced
in his labors in defense of human liberty;
and it is one of toe regrets of my life that
coming to this House I find bin. here, in
his old and declining days, the defender
of the trusts and combines, whose pur
pose it is to enslave the American
people, white and black. [Applause.]
It shows the decadence in that party
that he stands on the floor of the House
the defender of every organized band of
plunderers in the United States." [Ap
plause.]
Payne (R.) of New York replied to
Simpson's remarks regarding bides. The
whole situation as to bides was this;
Nearly all the hides imported into the
United States came from hot countries
where nature has provided the animals a
defense against insects and other pests in
the shape of thick hides and thin bair.
They are brought in for tanning into sole
leather ana do not come intp competition
with the hides of the cattle in Kansas. In
the cold climate of the United States
nature protects the cattle with thick hair
and thin hides and they are used for the
uppers of boots and shoes. Adcty on im
ported hides would not profit the farmers
of the United States a penny's worth.
A general debate on the cost of produc
ing pie iron in the North and South and
tne necessity of continuing the duty of $4
a ton followed upon statements by
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama and Cox (D.) of
Tennessee, that the duty was not essential
to the successful production of pig iron
in these States.
Dalzell (K.) of Pennsylvania areued
that it was to the advantage of the South
ern btate3 to maintain the duty, notwith
standing the advantages they possessed
in cheap labor, convict and negro, and
the close proximity of stone, coal and iron
deposits. The shipments abroad, which
had been spoken of, were, he said, from
accumulated stocks for which the pro
ducers were glad to find a market any
where.
In ?ne course of further debate McMil

YOUTHS WILL MOURN FOR OLIVER OPTIC
BOSTON, Map?., March 27â William T. Adams (Oliver Optic) died shortly after
9 o'clock this morning. Mr. Adams had been sick for a lons time with heart trouble.
He was 75 years old. For more than thirty years he lived and worked at his home in
Boston, except when taking his summer trips abroad or through this country. He
was the first amons the world's writers of stories for children â in fact, he was the
pioneer story-writer in juvenile fiction. As "Oliver Optic" he was known to every
child in this country who reads story-books. He was a most prolific writer. At the
age of 73 he had written 126 book 3 and more than 1000 newspaper stories.
driven Pittsburg out of the pigiron mar
ket, and that it would make things hot for
ihe North in the matter of cotton manu
factures, "And we won't ask the United
titates to hold us up while we're doing it,"
he added, amid applause.
Johnson (R.) ot Indiana called atten
tion to the irrelevent character of the de
bate. The committee would have consid
ered but forty-tive of the 183 pages of the
Dill by the time set for taking the vote on
its passages.
D.ngley said the criticisms of Johnson
were well founded, but that the gentle
men on the other side persisted in mak
ing assaults upon the bill at every point,
and it must be expected that some re
sponse would be made.
For the Democrats Dockery (D.) of
MisaotHi asserted^ with great vigor that
it could not be expected that they would
sit still while a bill of this magnitude and
importance was being considered and not
make all legitimate assaults against its
provisions.
Chlorate of soda was inserted in the bill
on motion by Payne (R.) of New York, at
3 cents a pound.
Mahany (R.) of New York moved to in
crease the duty on lime from 5 to 6 cents,
the rate in the McKinley law. It was an
tagonized by Lentz (D.) of Ohio.
Dingiev's motion to cut off further de
bate on the amendment was opposed by
the Democrats, who were not satisfied by
a viito by division, but insisted upon
tellers, 'ihe motion was agreed t0â 123 to
91. Mahany's amendment was rejected.
On motion by Dingley pearl-hardening,
for paper-makers, was included with
piaster of pans at $1 50 a ton.
At 4:15 p. m. the committee rose and the
House adjourned until Monday.
Democrat* Want Protection.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 27. -It
was stated on the floor of the House that
there will be some Democratic votes cast
for the tariff bill when it comes up tor
passage Wednesday next. Among those
reported to be in its favor are three of the
Louisiana delegation and one Texas mem
ber (Slayden of the San Antonio district).
Explaining his position Mr. Slayden said
to-day: "The tariff is a business matter.
I can see no good reason why the people
of my district should not share in its ad
vantages. They were greatly outraged
by the tree raw-material policy of the
Cleveland administration, which they con
sidered legislation iv favor of the manu
facturers and against ths producers. In
1894 the Assessors in Texas collected taxes
upoa 4,691,008 sheep, in 1896 unon 2,140,
--889.
"If this continues we shall soon be com
pelled to buy all our woolen clothes
abroad, and in the event of war our condi
tion might become really deplorable. 1
plainly promised the people of ray dis
trict that if they elected me I would vote
for free silver and against lree wool and
hides, and I shall cast both votes when
the opportuuity presents itself."
To Cnncrl Taper Monet/.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.-
Walker (R. ) of Massachusetts, by request,
to-day introduced in the House a hill di
recting the Secretary of the Treasury to
call in and cancel the paper money "now
injuring the prosperity of the country."
The notes to be canceled include all
legal tenders, treasury notes and silver
certificates. In order to accomplish the
retirement, bonds bearing interest at the
rate of 2% per cent per annum are to be
issued. The bill also authorizes the Sec
retary to sell "as bullion at its market
value" all the silver bullion now in the
treasury. He also introduced by request
a bill modifying the banking laws. It re
lieves banning associations from deposit
in^ bonds to secure circulation; provides
for the issue to banks of circulating notes
not to exceed the paid-up capital of the
banks and requires reserves to be kept in
specie, half in gold.
PLANS FOR PEACE IN CUBA.
Meanwhile Filibusters Are Landing Boat-
loads of War Material tor the
Insurgents.
LONDON, Eng.. March 27.â A dispatch
to the Central News from Madrid says that
negotiations for the conclusion of peace
are in progress between the Government
of Spain and the Cuban insurgent leaders,
with favorable prospects.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 27.â The
filibustering steamer Laurada arrived at
the Uolaware Breakwater this evening,
after having, it Is said, landed the most
important expedition sent from this
country to Cuba.
It was shortly after dark when she
slipped past the United States revenue
cutter Hamilton, and immediately disap
peared in the darkness up the bay. The
Hamilton had been watching at the
breakwater for the steamer for some time,
and shortly after the Laurada had passed
in she got under way, but it was impossi
ble to tell in the darkness which course
she took.
Although making no signals, the Lau
rada came near enough to the observation
station at the breakwater to be identified.
She had been off the cape all day, but was
evidently afraid of the Hamilton, and
waited until darkness enabled her to slip
by unobserved.
The Laurada left Baltimore on February
27 for Philadelphia, and when near Cape
Henry four boats were taken on board to
be used in landing the war material.
Three tlayi afterward she met the
schooner Derma T. Briggs of Stonincton,
Conn., and the tteam lighter Jennie H,
from New York, loaded with war ma
terial, which was transferred to the
Laurada twelve mile? off Barnegat. The
ve-sel's prow was then turned toward the
West Indies.
The expedition was in charge of General
Roloff, the insurgent Minister of War.
There were forty others on the Laurada
when she left, and iv her hold were stowed
7000 rifles, 1,700,000 rounds of ammunition,
25 tonÃ of stick dynamite and a large sup
ply of food and medicine.
The expedition was fitted out by the
Cuban Junta for General Garcia and
landed in the province of Santiago de
Cuba, where a large force had been sent to
meet and convey the supplies to thÂ« head
quarters of the army in the interior.
Among those on board the Laurada is
Mrs. Hugnes, the wife of the commander.
Two detectives are also said to be on
board, having been sent from New York,
and who are said to have kept a dai.y log
of the vessel's movements. They are said
to have gone in the guise of firemen.
B4ITLE WXIH IASCRGBXTS.
Re-en forcftnenta Aid Filibuster* in De
f*atinri tspani-lt Joreea.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 28.â A
Herald special irom Key West, FJa., says:
It is stated on the best authority that a
filibustering expedition which sailed from
this vicinity last week effected a landing
on the north coast of Cuba, west of
Havana, near Mariel. According to ru
mors which are current^ here startling cir
cumstances attended the lauding.
~ The Spaniards, it is said, had been in
formed that such an expedition would
land from the steamer Bermuda, and
strong force was placed in ambush on the
northern coast near the point where it
was supposed that the party would at
tempt to reach the shore.
The place at which the expedition really
landed was in fact but a short distance
from the reported ambush of the Span
iards, and U soon as the Cubans came
ashore with their arms and ammunition
they were met by a sharp tire and at
tack, before which they were powerless.
Several of the Cubans, according to the
rumor, were killed and the munitions of
war were seized. Later, the rumor states,
a large body of Cubans came to the rescue
of the newly-landed men and boldly at
tacked the victorious Spaniards troops, the
result being that the Spaniards in turn
were pat to flight, the warlike cargo re
maining in the bands of the Cubans.
The Spaniards had also, it is stated,
sent several gunboats to that part of the
coast and wbeii the filibustering vessel
sailed she was cha-ed and fired upon, but,
according to the report, was uninjured.
RISE OF THE MISSISSIPPI.
In Some Places Along the Levees the
Situation Is Becoming Extremely
Critical.
QUINCY, 111., March 27.â The flood
situation here H extremely alarming.
The Mississippi River continues to rise,
and, to add to the seriousness of the case,
the Government bureau predicts that
tliere will be more of arise to-morrow,
and no one doubts that the prediction
will be fulfilled.
People living in the unprotected low
lands have been driven out. They had
ample warning, however, and removed
their stock and household goods to safe
ground before the water reached them.
The river at this point is now about
seven miles wide, completely covering the
lowlands on the Missouri aide.
In the lower districts thsre is much stir.
A large fores of men is working heroically
to strengthen the weak places of the
levees, but it is feared that the work will
be for naught, as the river promises to go
over the levee to-morrow.
ST. PAUL, MIHK., March 27.â The
Mississippi River at St. Paul lacks but
four-tenths of a foot of the danger point,
ten feet, to-night. The ice went out at
4:30 this afternoon. The indications to
night are that the river wiii leave its banks
in the next four hours.
A further rise of about four feet is ex
pected here, which will drive about 7000
people from their homes on the West Side
and Bohemian Flats. Water is running
into the basements of several manufactur
ing establishment? and stopping the ma
cninery. It has been thawing heavily,
and the prospects are for another big thaw
to-morrow.
Overcome by the dan.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 27â Two
women ana a man were found in their
rooms at Flaniey's Hotel, on Hudson
street, this afternoon. They had been

and the man was unconscious. He was
removed to St. Vincent's Hospital. The
three registered at t.e hotel last night as

UNEXPECTED SPEED
OF THE WILMINGTON
Builders Exceed Require
ment and Will Get a
Big Bonus.
On the 0 ficial Trial Trip the
Vessel Goes Over Fifteen
Knots an Hour.
This Insures the Newport N.W3 Cm
pany Ex ra Compensation of
About $40,000
NEW LONDON. Conn., March 27.â The
new gunboat Wilmincton on her official
trial trip over the Government course on
Long Island Sound made a speed a trifle
over fifteen knots an hour. Her require
ment was thirteen knots, and the ship
thus earns a bonus of $40,000 for her build
ers, the Newpori News Snip-building and
Drydock Company. The conditions of the
-trial were favorable, and it is possible that
the official computation may make the
spe*d 15.25 knots or a bonus of $45,000.
The Wilmington was constructed by the
Newport News Ship-building and Dry
dock Company, and is designed especially
for river service. She is 250 feet 8% inches
long on the water line and 251 feet 10
inches over all, with a maximum beam of
44 feet and a depth from the flat keel to
the top of the beams of the upper deck of
2o feet 2 inches.
At a draught of nine feet her displace
ment is 1390 tons. She will have a large
military mast, with two military tops.
There will be a conning tower oft the mast
jun below the military top, thus enabling
her captain at a height of forty-five feet
above her water line to direct her move
ments. Her berthine capacity is suffi
cient for many additional men besides her
crew.
Her machinery consists of triple expan
sion twin-screw engines, having cylinders
H l /i, 22 and 33?^ inches in diameter and
eignteen inches stroke. The total coal
bunker capacity i 3 about 280 tons.
To facilitate landing the large body of
men she has ships' boats of an unusual
size, her steam-cutter and sailing-launch
each being thirty ieot long.
She is provided with a searchlight, to be
placed on her military mast, but she has
no torpedo-tubes.
The arrangement of thÂ« battery will be
ns follows: Four 4-inch guns, mounted in
pairs, tyro forward and two aft, those aft
being mounted on the main deck, those
forward on the forecastle deckâ aH pro
tected by gun-3hields; four 4 inch guns,
mounted in armored spousonson the gun
deck, two on each side, amidships; two
6-pounders, mounted in armored spon
sons, on the eun-deck; two 6-pounders,
mounted forward on the forecastle deck;
four 1-pounders, two beside the Bridge
and two in the lower tops; two Gatling
guns in the upper top. All of the guns
will be of the rapid-fire type.
CUBAN FORGtRS CAPTURED.
Bold Rascals Secure a Small Fortune
Before Their Operations Are
Checked.
NEW YORK, N.Y.. March 27.â A special
to the San Irom Havana says: Tne police i
have discovered here another gang ef I
swindlers, audacious as the one which last j
year forged the signature of Hidalgo &
Co. of Havana on v draft of August Bel- i
mont & Co. of Xtevt York and swindled j
several other foreign banks with corre- j
spondents in Cuba. The two principals of
the last gang, now under arrest, are Span- |
iards â Sevasiion Bernal y Alonzoand An- j
tonio Marti Herrara, both of Valencia.
Both men carried on their frauds for a
long time from Madrid, Barcelona and
other important towns of the peninsula,
and are said to have defrauded many per
sons in France, England and the United
States. Last year they came to Havana
with some of their associates and here
they have obtained criminally more than
$300,000. Their way of operating was ex
ceedingly clever.
Knowing by name many persons of
Spanish or Cuban descent living abroad
and foreigners married to Spanish or Cu
ban women, they obtained full informa
tion regarding the d s:ant relatives of
these persons.
Then they addressed letters to the pro
posed victims, notifying them that certain
of their distant relatives had died, leaving
large legacies to the persons addressed.
The letters appeared to have been
signed by a notary public, who inclosed
certified copies of the wills on Spanish
legal paper. The signatures of the no
taries were certified apparently by the
Havana Consul-General of the nation to
which the person was addressed. In each
case the seal of the consulate was forged
to make the proof of the genuineness
seem conclusive.
Bernal conceived the plan and Marti,
who is a wonderful penman, was in charge
of the forging of seals and signatures. At
the house of Marti in Guanabacoa, tne
town across the bay where he was arrest
ed, the police found a lot of legal paper,
seals of all the .Spanish courts in Cuba
and of all the important consulates, and
forged signatures of nearly all the magis
trates and public notaries in Havana.
Bernal and Marti were discovered
through information mada in Santiago de
Cuba with the Chief of Police, Senor Tru
jilio, who after long investigations asked
that they be arrested in Havana.

plague in those countries. His ' report
says:
During the latter part of February a
temporary laboratory was constructed on
Swinburne iMand for the purpose of in
vestigating the plague bacteria, and if
possible producing a plague antitoxine.
The work began February 17 and the
laboratory was stocked witn animals for
the purpose of examination. On February
_H a horse was inoculated with ihe cul
ture of plague bacillus. This was repeated
on March 9. In order to dÂ»termine how
early the serum might have acquired
antitoxic properties, about one pint of
blood was drawn from the horse March
15 for experimental purposes, and irora
this half a pint of eerum was secured.

About one cubic centimeter was injected
into white mice. Alter fifteen hours these
mice were inoculated with actual culture
of the plague bacillus, which experiments
had proved to be fatal to the mice within
twenty-four hours, showing its efficiency.
The animals which had been previously
injected with serum remained alive.
Tests made to ascertain the curative
powers of this serum have not been so
satisfactory, though in most cases it pro

TORTURED BY TWO ROBBERS.
David Jonas, an Aged Farmer of Ne-
braska, Dies From ins Effects of
Terrible Cruellies.
BEATRICE, Nebr., March 27.â David
Jones, an ased iarnier who lived near
Wymore, died to-day from injuries in
flicted one week ago by robbers. Jonea
was 71 years old, a bachelor and Jived
alone. He was qnite wealthy and was
popularly supposed to keep large sums of
money about his place. About 8 o'clock
one night, as he was preparing to retire,
two masked men entered his house.
One knocked him down with a blow on
the head. When he had portly regained
consciousness he was made to show where
he kept his money. He took them up
stairs and showed them $4, declaring it
was all he had. They then tied him to a
bed, wrapped his feet in cloths, and, after
saturating them with coal oil, set them on
tire. He still protested, and a bundle of
clothes was laid on his bare stomach and
sec on fire. Tailing in their purpose, more
of the oiled clothes were placed on the
back of his neck and burned. The men
tnen left.
About daylight Jones managed to get
free, crawled to the barn, got a horse and
rode to his Bister:, a half-mile distant,
where he lell from the animal unconscious.
He was only able to give a slight des
cription of hii assailants. An inquest was
held this afternoon, which has resulted in
a clew, which is hoped will lead to the
arrest of the guilty parties, in which event
the now thoroughly aroused community
declare there will be lynching. There is
a strong public demand for the county to
offer a large reward for the apprehension
of the murderers.

KASER'S POLICY
Germai Opinion Does Not
Favor the Coercion of
Greece.
Newspapers Denounce the Brutal
Act of Invervention in
Cretan Affairs.
In Expectation That Naval Credits
Will Be Rfjfcted William Orders
Two New Cruisers.
BERLIN, Germany, March 27.â The
current of German opinion has set in
â trongly against wnat it known as the
"Kaiser's policy" regarding Greece, not
in the columns of the Liberal press alone,
but in those of newspapers which have
hitherto been giving their support to the
policy of intervention in Crete by the
united powers. The journals have taken
a new tack and are now deploring the
part which the united squadrons of the
powers are playing and are likely to play
in Cretan waters. An example of this
newspaper opinion is shown in an article
in the National Zeitung, commenting
upon the official announcement of the
r hare taken in the naval concert by Ger
uany's cruiser, the Augusta Victoria, in
bombarding the Cretan insurgents, which
characterizes the affair as an unheard-of
disgrace, adding that nothine more is
needed to prove that the intervention of
the powers is futile.
The Vossisciie Zeitung, in an article on
the same subject, says: This senseless
and brutal act of intervention on the part
of the powers in Crete may well be the
last that Germany takes part in. Nobody
could witness tue departure of more Ger
man shir>s and German troops for Cretan
waters without grave misgivings and
anxiety. The German navy can leave
such a task without jealousy to other
nations.
The paper concludes its article by say
ing: "The first step to be taken is the
immediate withdrawal of the Turkish
troops from Crete. That public senti
ment will influence the Kaiser is outside
the bounds of probability, but if the
Government speakers in the Reichstag
try to influence that body as they did in
to-day's debate on the navy debates by
adducing the paucity of the German
share in the naval demonstrations of the
powers :n the East as compared -with the
flee; s of other nations, then their arguments
will fail Hat as they did to-day in face of thÂ«
fact that Germany prefers not to co-oper
ate with the other powers in any measures
of coercion of Greece."
The. rejection of the Government de
mantfs in regard to the navy credits by
the Reichstag is a foregone conclusion,
but there is no public excitement over the
matter. In connection with tne rejection
of the credits the old stories are being re
vived that Prince Hohenlohe, the Impe
rial Chancellor, is desirous of being re
lieved of the cares of office, pie ding ad
vanced age and the inormitiei thereof,
and 11. iÂ»'said that if Prince Hohenlohe re
tires Marschafl'von Bieberstein, Minister
of Foreign Affairs, will resign also.
The Emperor is in expectation that the
Reichstag will reject the naval credit pro
posals and is concluding an arrangement
with the KrupDs for the construction of
two cruisers after plans furnished by the
Government under an agreement that if
tne Reichstag shall refuse to grant the
credits necessary to pay for them when
the estimates for 1898 are submitted the
Krupps will be allowed to sell the snips to
any foreign power wishing to purchase
tnem. In the meantime the Krupps are
to have a year's credit at the imperial
treasury.
The importance of the vote in the
Reichstag yesterday in favor of paying
salaries or fees to members of that body is
likely. to be misconstrued. Already the
Reichstag has nine times affirmed the
principle of payment of salaries or fees to
members of that chamber, and as often
hfts the Bundesrath vetoed the measure,
and the same fate certainly awaits the
resolution that was adopted yesterday pro
viding that the State pay fees and travel
ing expenses to members of the lower
body. The motion was offered by Herr
Richter. the Radical leader, but it found
supporters in all of the groups.
Tne columns of the newspapers are
â¢till given up to criticism of the William I.
centenary fetes, which were held on Mon
day. Tuesday and Wednesday. Apart
from the semi-official organs many of the
papers protest against the excessive glori
rication of the old Kaiser. The Vossische
Zeitung advises that the phrase "William
the Great" be left to the verdict of future
generations.
The illness with which Prince Bismarck
is afflicted is not serious, and is due to a
chili which seized him while walking in
the park. Count Herbert Bismarck, the
e*-<3hancell6r's eldest aon. left Friedrichs
ruhe yesterday.

OTTAWA, Ont., March 27.â Members
of Parliament from every quarter of the
Dominion continue to report a decided
feeling of exasperation in their con
stituents in regard to the attitude of the
governing party in the United States and
the announcement of a tariff bill that will
reduce materially the duties on goods im
ported mainly from Great Britain and re
tain the present duties on those goods
coming from the United States. A promi
nent Liberal member irom Ontario who
has heretofore been solicitous for closer
relation* witn the United States sayi that
his constituents are very pronounced in
favor of a retaliatory tariff and an alien
labor law as against the United States,
with a discriminating tariff in the interest
of British manufactures.

HOT DISMAYED BY
THE NEW TARIFFS
British Manufacturers Say
They Expected Higher
Duties.
German Makers of Cutlery
Will Suffer More Than
the English.
Elaborate Preparations for the Open-
Air Celebration of the Dia
mond Jubilee.
LONDON, Eire., March 27.â Collating
opinions from various centers interested
in the incidents of the McKmley tariff
the representative here of the Unitea As
sociated Presses finds in no quarter any
thing aptiroaching the dismay which fell
upon the British traders when me tariff
of 1890 was announced. The new tariff
has been scanned, of course, with the
greatest interest, bui almost with confi
dence. It conveyed no shock or surprise.
Indeed, reports rather indicate an agree
able relaxation of the tension which ex
isted pending the publication of the
main proposals.
W. H. Herlby, M. P. for Blackburn, one
of tne largest cotton-spinners in Lan
cashire, says that the changes will not af
fect cotton industries in any material way.
The current opinion in Liverpool and
Manchester is the same.
Sheffield reports that the cutlery trade
will not be "in a much worse position
than under the Wilson act." One of the
principal cutlery manufacturers goes so
far as to say that the new bill ia a step in
the direction of the bringing about of a
more honest system of business; that the
object of the American manufacturers
was obviously to stop the tremendous
competition they experienced from the
Germans, who, through a system of low
valuations, really defeated the object of
the present tariff bill. America was thus
flooded with cheap German-made goods.
The revision would chiefly affect the low
priced goods, and, while affecting ciieap
Sheffield products in common with the
German, would place Sheffield in a good
position for meeting German cheap com
petition.
Another large cutlery firm says it may
bother tbe Germans, who cultivate a trade
with America in the cheapest and nasty
goods. Generally speaking, he holds tnat
it will make no practical difference to the
Sheffield trade.
Leeds resorts that the new tariff will De
prohibitive as far as some classes of woolen
fabrics exported to the United States are
concerned. Worsteds will be hit heavily,
and so Bradford and Huddersfield will not
suffer much. But stringent as the tariff
is it does not take the Leeds manufac
turers by surprise. Leeds expected as
much, and the manufacturers are rather
gratihed than otherwise by a relief from
uncertainty. The tenor of the reports
from Birmingham, Glasgow and Dundee
is similar. It should be added that every
center records a run of orders from the
United States to be delivered before re
vised duties go into operation.
What pressure sportingmen in Parlia
ment can bring to bear upon the Govern
ment to support a bill for legalizing bet
ting in the ring has been tried without
success.
The licensing of bookmakers commends
itself to many members who see no harm
in legal recognition of a practice which
may be called national. But no Govern
ment could stand the hurricane of re
proach which would arise from the solemn
body of electors, whose influence when
aroused decides the fate of governments.
A bill will be introduced by private mem
bers and will get strong support, but no
minister will venture to support it in Ins
ministerial capacity, and if the measure
gets co a second reading its rejection is
certain. The bookmakers' shop is sum
marily closed and probably forever. If
the anti-betting league follows up its vic
tory betting as now practiced by nearly
all classes will become impossible.
A new London daily paper, something
on the line of the New York Herald'a
London venture, is projected and will ap
pear early in April.
The builders are well on with their
work at St. Panl'a for the open-air thanks
giving meeting of the Queen's diamond
jubilee. As yet the piles of scaffolding
conceal the intended improvements. Un
less the roof is used for coigns of vantage
in sight-seeing very few of the public will
see any of the ceremony. There are
singularly few windows in the vicinity
from which it would be possible to get a
full view of the Queen at the service. The
space around Queen Anne's statue will De
occupied by distinguished guests.
When the present activity of the ad
miralty has subsided Mr. Goschen intends
to return favorably to the consideration of
_ the dispatch of another exploring expedi
tion to the Antarctic Ocean.
Everybody now recognizes that such an
undertaking would have the best chances
of success if carried on with the active
assistance of the admiralty, assisted by
scientific experts. It is quite likely that a
suitable ship will be com missioned shortly
for the purpose.
The next expenses clause of the Ama
teur Athletic Association's law is still a
source of heartburning to disqualified
amateurs and to stricter "gentlemen ath
letes." The proposed rules legalizes the
funding of an actual out-of-pocket hotel
and traveling expenses to men who may
be taking part in competitions at a dis
tance, and even then the payment must
be made presumably by the club sending
the competitor and not by the clnb pro
moting the sports. Whatever else the
rule is the association is sure that it is not
the thin edge of a wedge toward breaking
up amateur statutes.
The farewell dinner to Sir Alfred
Milnes, the new Governor of Cape ColonyV
to-night presented a notable burying of
the hatchet among rivals In public life.
Round the same friendly table at the Cafe
Monico were Chamberlain, Mr. Balfour,
Lord Rosebery, Bir William Harcourt,
the Marquis of Lansdowne, Viscount
Peel, Sir John Morley and others. Mr.
Asquith, an old college friena of Sir
Alfred Milnes, presided. Time has healed
the bitterness of the home-rule battles
with most men, but between Mr. Cham
berlain and Lord Rosebery and the latter
and Sir William Harcourt there have as
yet been only the stiffest courtesies and
bitter-sweet public allusions.

GILROY'S HONORED DEAD.
Touching Eulogy Pronounced at the Grave
of the Late Ex-Congressman
Tully.
GILROY, Cai,., March 27. -When the
body of ex-Congressman Pleasant B. Tully
was laid at rest yesterday in the Masonic
and Odd Fellows' Cemetery, a. touching
eulogy was pronounced at the gravj by
George T. Dunlap, an old-time friend of
the deceased. It was a splendid portrayal
of the character of Mr. Tully, and one in
which every person at the graveside ac
quiesced. Mr. Dunlap said:
I have consented to do what the dead would
have gladly done lor me. While the sun In
heaven low in the west and softly
kissed good-ni?ht by the passing dayâ fit
emblem of departing lifeâ the vital
spark of our much loved friend
and brotner took its flight ns gently
as a summer's wind, and full of ripened years
and quiet resignation lie fell into that silent
slumber which we know at least Is perfect rest.
And now we gather here to pay the last sad
rites to one whose presence In our
midst has, been as familiar as yonder
mountain peak. The labors of his long
and useful life now ended are every
where interwoven with the history of this
Community. To this fair spot he came when
it was but a wilderness. Before the engine's
shriek was ever heard, or tree and vine had
ever grown and blossomed, he builded here a
home, and around Its sacred hearthstone
(which was the heaven of his life) he watcned
hi* children grow.
Without family, without wealth, -without
aid, he began the battle of life alone. Nature
had blessed him with a heritage richer than
all the mines of earthâ a splendid mind,
& cheerful heart â and with a sublime
faith in the ultimate adjustment of all.
things natural and temporal he pa
tiently pursued the pathway of life. He
was the soul of mirth, zealous of truth, anxious
to be just, willing to be advised and never
withholding advice. Conscious of the fact
that the problem of life must be solved by
each, for himself, he steadfastly followed
the convictions of his own mind and
heart, turning neither to the right
hand nor to the le!t, â willing if neÂ«d be
to wait, that time should disclose the just
ness of his course. In his profession he was
the peer of any of his time. He comprehended
the purpose and scope of government and law :
as a statesmen he was laithful to all public
trusts; he loved nis country and his
people, Â»nd in recognition of his loy
alty and fitness this State, which he had
he:ped to pioneer and build, honored
him with a seat In the Capitol of the Nation,
from which, he returned to his home and hiÂ§
people with his honor and his name unsullied ;
and when the history of the times in which
he lived is told the mention of his name upon
ts pages will never bring a blush of shame to
he faces of the loved ones he has left behind.
He was a student of all forms of faith aDd
fact; he understood the limitations of human
knowledge, that the mental eye of man can
never penetrate beyond the horizon of
the finite. From an intellectual eminence o
more than ordinary height he surveyed the
realms of thought. The poets and the scholars,
like the stars, were his companions. He saw

IZZET BEY, TURKEY'S MOST POWERFUL SUBJECT.
Izzet Bey, the Sultan's right hand, is the most powerful subject in the Empire of the
Turk, and one of the most masterful diplomats in all Europe. It is believed that his hand
has been behind all the complications in the east that have been troubling the peace of
Europe for the past two or three years. Abdul Hamid's mind is said not to be as strong ss
it once was, and izzct has taken advantage of this weakness to play the game of politics to
suit his own notions. Embassadors to Turkey say he is as clever as most European states
men. But his cleverness does not mitigate tho heartlessness, cruelty and absolute
unscrupulousness which are known to possess him. Izzet came into tho full fruit of his
power early in October of 1895, when Said Pasha, the Brand vixier, fell into disgrace. Said
was compelled to flee to the British embassy for his life. Izzet was then in the Sultan's
eye as a good man. He had persuaded Abdul Hamid that the concert of Europe mainly
existed in the articlas of newspapers and in the imaginations of simple folk. He had
occupied the post of Minister 01 Justice, and his dealings with foreigners had shown such
flagrantly corrupt methods and such vile injustice that the Sultan was forced to remove
him at the demand, almost, of the French Embassador. This, notwithstanding the fact
that Izzet affected a great love for the French, and that his three sons are now being
educated in Parisian schools. When Said Pasha fell the Sultan was free to select Izzet as
his vizier, and the wily Arab has managed to absorb to himself all the imperial functions
with the exception only of the grand affairs of state, and his influence is readily recognized
in most of these. The result has been that he and his master have very prettily outplayed
the combined diplomatic forces of civilized Europe for a year or more.

purpose of everything that is. Confident
of the integrity of eternal truth he bravely
nccepted the inevitable. Knowing that the
end of life is as natural as the beginning he
stepped down to the brink of this silent,
painless tomb, feeling no care except for
those he leaves to mourn.
Keep green his memory then, my friends
and brothers, for with all his share of human
frailty there was so much of sentiment and
love and wealth of mind that we may well be
lieve and know tho world is better because he
lived.
AID SENT FROM SEATTLE.
Steamer Dispatched to Pick Up the
Wrecked Willapa's Passengers and
Carry Them to Juneau.
SEATTLE, "Wash., March 27.â Eight
passengers and twelve of the crew of the
wrecked steamship Willapa arrived on the
steamer Rosalia to-day at Victoria. Purser
Laforge said that the vessel would be a
total loss. C. B. Roberts is still at the
scene of the wreck.
The Alaska Steamship Company has en
gaged tl;e steamer Edith to pick up the
Willapa's passengers at Bella Coola and
take them on to Juneau.
NANAIMO, B. C, March 27.â The
steamer William was enshrouded in a
snowstorm on Friday, March 19, when it
drifted upon the rocks. It was bound for
Alaskan ports from Seattle and had on
board a full cargo of freight and passen
ger?. The scene of the wreck is one of
the most dangerous localities on the
northern coast.
It is eight miles from Bella Coola and
betwsen two islets known as Dalplatz and
Grassie. The Willapa's engines were not
working at the time and the vessel was
barely in motion.
The shock when the steamer's timbers
crunched against the jagged rocks was in
consequence so slight that many of the
passengers never left their bunks until ad
vised of their predicament.
Captain Roberts was at the wheel and
Pilot Jenson.'who had been in charge,
had just retired when the accident oc
curred. All took the affair very coolly and
for some time believed the steamer would
free itself.
So firmly convinced of this were they
that no attempt was made to send any
one ashore until about 10 o'clock. Pilot
Jenson started for Bella Coola with the
only two women who were aboard.
Pilot Jenson returned from Bella Coola
with a number of Indian canoes to assist
in the work, and at 11 o'clock all the pas
sengers were on shore.
â¢ At the time of tbe accident the tide was
falling rapidly, and at the extreme lowest
stage the steamer lay over on its star
board bilge, resting heavily witi its big
load on some pointed rocks.
By 11 o'clock the flood tide almost com
pletely covered the wreck. Tne crew
worked with mignt and main to save as
much of the cargo as possible, and while
the tide wa3 low piled stacks of it upon
the steamer's upper decks, to take it
cshore when the water was high.
Miners' supplies composed the bulk of
the freight, the property of one pros
pector alone who had outhtted^or a three
years' stay in Alaska being valued at
$1200. J'he only livestock aboard were six
horses, which had to be shot, as there was
no way of getting them ashore.

LOS ANGELES DECISION.
Hotel-Keepers Declared Not Liable for
Property Lost in Fires by
Guests.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 27.â A
suit of great importance to hotelmen and
lodging-house-keepers has iust been de
cided here. It involves the rights of
guests to recover the value of personal
property, such as wearing apparel and
jawelry, which may have been destroyed
by fire while they were occupants of the
building, and the property was in the
safekeeping of the landlord,
The case was tried in Judge Allen's de
partment of the Superior Court, able
counsel having been employed by both
sides. The action was brought by George
T. Harris, who sought to recover $1500
from Walter Raymond. Harris sued be
cause his clothes, diamonds and jewelry
were lost in the Raymond Hotel fire two
years aeo. Judge Allen's decision was in
favor of Raymond.
The plaintiff's contention was that
Landlord Raymond had not provided his
hotel with the necessary safeguards against
the destruction by tire of his guests' prop
erty, and for that reason should pay tha
value of such property lost to its owner.
Raymond showed that he had made
provision against the destuction of the
building, but owing to the great headway
the fire attained before it was discovered
little or nothing could be done to avert
the disaster, the hotel being outside of the
fire limits of Pasadena.

FOR WAR

an area of some 15,000 square miles only.
The same conferenceâ that of Berlin in
1878â that stripped TurKey of her north
ern provinces gave to Greece a good part of
Thessaly and Epirus.making her area 25,000
square miles and adding a population of
nearly half a million, which with the nat
ural increase, will give King George a
total of nearly two and a quarter millions
of subjects at the present time, lint these
are not all he can with a certainty count
upon in case of war. The whole iEgean
seaboard, as well as the eastern shores of
the Black Sea, is occupied by Greeks, who,
though nominally the subjects of the Sul
tan, are at heart loyal to King George,
hoping and praying for the time when all
the Greek communities will be united into
one, as of old, and under the scepter of a
Christian King of the Hellenes.
This common hope for ths future, a
common language, common traditions
and a common religion, bare mads the
Greeks a nation in spite of the treaties
and tolerances on the part of the great
Christian powers that have kept two and a
half millions of them under the rule of the
Turk for nearly a century after the logic
of events had proved that it could not
sustain itself unaided on European soil.
Mutual jealousy and misdirected diplo
macy have made the powers of Europe
responsible for the long years of oppres
sion and cruelty that these people have
been made to suffer at the hands of their
Moslem masters.
Those who are determined upon a con
tinuance of this policy may well fear the
results of King George's manly persist
ency. Once begun, the war will end in
proving that all the time, talent and treas
ure expended on the Eastern question
have not been able to stay the natural
course of events. King George's allies
within the dominions of the Sultan will
not be confined to the Greeks there resi
dent, and the Sultan at the same time wiil
have but little loyal support against him
from his subjects. Though not Greeks by
race, the larger part of the rest ol
the people are Greek in religion, and
incited by the success of their brethren
and former ec-slaves of the Sultaa in Ser
via, Bulgaria and other countries, are
only too ready to strike a blow for the
Cross as against the Crescent and at the
same time for their own freedom from the
rule of the Asiatic Osmanli.
The Sultan's European subjects of the
Turkish race, some 1,200,000 in number
all told, live for the most part in the east
ern portion of Rounielia intermixed with
the Greeks and Slavs. Nearly a fourth of
thorn are to be found in Constantinople
and the vicinity. There are also some
scattered communities about Salonica,
Servia, Monastic and other towns of Mace
donia. Besides these and the Greeks the
majority of the rest of the people are
Slavs by race and Greek Catholic in relig
ion, acknowledging the ecclesiastical jur
isdiction of tbe Patriarch of the Greek
church at Athens. In Albania there are
. â . â Â«â
about 1,000,000 of inhabitants, mostly
Skipetars and ZinzareV of the Greeco-
Latin race. In the southern part, includ
ing nearly all of EpirusÂ»tliey are nearly
all Greeks, aa is also the else with Turkish
Thessaly.
The lp.rger part of the people of Upper
Albania are Mussulmans, iescendants â â â¢! ,
ancestors who embraced that faith for the
purpose of furthering their vorldly inter
ests, though they are not bigoted nor
fanatical. A large proportion of the Sul
tan's soldiery are Albanians, who would
fight for nim as long as they wire paid or
allowed to plunder; but the grtat mass of
the people would be indifferett to a con
test between the Turk and Gr*?k unless
forced to take part, which they vould do
against either, indifferently in tie direc
tion promising the most plunder.
On the other hand, Greece is a nation of
Greeks. There are no Turks amonÂ» them,
the last community among them having
taken their departure from the country
some years since. With a united and en
thusiastic people at home King George's
army can cross the frontier and be sure of
finding a welcome from the great ma
jority of the inhaoitantsâ their brothers
in race and religion and in hatred of
Turkish oppression.
Over 68 per cent of the whole number of
English criminals are unab c to read.

he had consump-

tion was considered a necessarily fatal dis-
ease. It was considered incurable. As soon
as it developed enough so that a physician
could decide that it.was really consumption,
the patient was considered as good as dead.
Years ago', Dr. Pierce found out that con-
sumption was not incurable, that it was not
necessarily fatal. He not only found this
out, but he found out a way to cure con-
Bumption. He introduced his "Golden
Medical Discovery." The "Discovery"
will cure 9$ per cent, of all cases of con-
sumption if it is, taken according to direc-
tions. Consumption is a disease of. the
blood. It is caused by impoverishment of
the blood, and by the existence of disease-
germs in the system. If the body is per-
fectly strong and healthy, and the 'blood
perfectly pure, germs are easily thrown off.
If the body is weak, if the tissues are in-
capable of much resistance, the germs find
a resting place and develop. â  That's the
way consumption begins.
The " Golden Medical Discovery "
searches out the 'germs, forces them out
of the system and cures consumption and
other kindred diseases of the throat, bron-
chia and lungs. No doubt about it, no ques-
tion about it. It has done it in hundreds
and thousands of cases. The "Discovery"
is sold at drug stores.

HONORS TO SANTA
CLARA'S SENATOR
Enthusiastic Reception to
Hon. H. V. Morehouse
at San Jose.
Hale's Hall Too Small to House
AH Who Gather to Cheer
the Statesman-
Rounds of Applause Greet His Reply
to Attacks Upon His Course
at Sacramento.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 27.â The re
ception tend arcd to Senator H. V. Wore
honse in this city this evening was one of
the most enthusiastic ever accorded a pol
itician in Santa Clara County. A large
crowd, representing all political parties '
and including many ladies, braved a j
heavy rainstorm to gather in Hale's Hall, '
and hundreds who could not be accommo- i
dated with seats remained standing in i
order to hear the discourse of the eloquent j
speaker. The Fifth Regiment band, I
which was in attendance, entertained the j
gathering until the arrival of the guest of
honor, and his entrance was the signal
for a round of deafening applause.
Senator Morehouse was introduced to
the audience by Louis O'Neal, who nomi
nated him in convention for the oftice to
which he was elected. Mr. O'Neal ts- \
ferred to the magnificent manner in j
which Senator Morehouse had shown j
himself worthy of the conridence which
the public had placed in his honor, integ
rity, statesmanship and courage, and |
stated that by bis course in the Senate he '
had won for himself an enviable place in
the estimation of the people of the whole
State.
When Senator Morehouse arose he was
greeted with deafening applause, which |
lasted for some time. When order was
restored the speaker said:
Ladies and Gentlemen : I am very glad in- j
deed to be again permitted to appear before i
my own people and to have this opportunity j
of addressing tht-m. Ever since my return
from Sacramento I have been the recipieut of
kind greetings, the warm pressure of honest
nands and the hearty congratulations, which !
show that my humble efforts meet the ap
proval of my constituency.
I have dove my auty. I know it and lam
sure that you know it. I did not expect any j
such meeting as this. I expected simply to j
pass 1 oack into my business, well knowing that \
I had done my duty faithfully and honestly j
and believing that my own people, who know I
me well, would give their unqualified appro- j
bation over my course. But I find that you j
are not satisfied only to bid me welcome but !
that that welcome should be a spontaneous
outburst ot good feeling.
Now, to begin at the beginning: I told you
in the labt campaign that if I was elected I
would prove to the State that Santa Clara
County was on the map of the State. 1 have
done so. The whole State has heard from me.
True, the San Francisco Examiner has sought
by innuendo and falsehood, by scurrility and
abuse, to defame me, yet its attacks have only I
drawn my friends nearer. When I reached j
the State capital the first thing done was for |
the Republican members of the Senate to or- j
ganize a caucus. What did that caucus do?
It first took the list of attaches of the previous !
Senate and the payroll and cv t off all unncces- j
sary attaches and reduced salaries to the ex.
tent of savins the State $343 per day, or a
total saving of .â¢Â£26,448 for the session.
I speak of this only to show you that this
Senate had the good of the peonle at heart
We Kept that pledge.
I next bent my energies to obtain the needed
legislation for my own county. Take th c
State Normal School: I got for it, with the as
sistance of my colleagues la both branches of
the Legislature, the requisite appropriations
to maintain and carry on that grand home of I
learning. Nor is that all. I got an appropria- {
tlon, now in the hands of the Governor, of I
Â£10,000 to build a gymnasium on the normal !
grounds, so that the young ladles and gentle
men attending this great State school might
have a home for physical development. Nor j
did we stop there. "We got put In the general ;
appropriation bill an item of $5000 lor keep- '
ing tne normal grounds in repair, that the
lawns might be cared for end the parterres of
flowers might be kept, and the * walks im
proved and the trees trimmed. Thus for the
next two yean we may hope to see the San
Jose State Normal School a seat of learning
adding honor and glory to our city and
county.
Nor did we stop there. We passed a bill
granting to the city of San Jose the right ana
power to build the high school on the normal
grounds, thus Ravine to the public the neces
sity of paying $20,000 for a lot of land, and
building a $55,000 schoolhouse; so that now
our School Trustees will erect an imposing i
and handsome structure, costing $75,000. I
Then, out on the Normal lot, as people pass
by. they will behold temples of . learning ami
beautiful grounds and shaded walks, and our
City will be what it is destined to becomeâ
Athena of the Pacific Coast. This I promised
you during the campaign, and I have kept my
word.
Nor is that all. You had an election during
my absence and adopted, a new charter. The
records of the Senate will show that I intro
duced Senate concurrent resolution 7, and
that now to-day this city is no longer carrying
on business under a charter created years ago,
but is working under a new charter, giving j
the powers necessary to meet tho growth of 1
this beautiful and intelligent and prosperous ;
city.
iMoristhat all. We obtained for the"State
Insane Asylum at Agnews all the usual and .
necessary appropriations to keep that great i
institution for the care of .the unfortunate in
sane. And further, we got un appropriation of
$22,000 to build cottages and enlarge the ca
pacity and efficiency of that institution.
Nor did we stop there. Out at Evergreen we '
found a home under the control of the Ladies
of the Relief Corp* of the Grand- Army. Â» This
Institution, not being a State institution, could
not, under recent decisifms. obtain State aid;
co, at the request oi Mrs. Dr. Record of this
Cityâ ore of those grand and noble women
whose hearts beat in sympathy for the poor I
â¢nd suffering widow of the soldiers and Bailors
who gave their lives Indefenseof ourcountry's
honor end perpetuityâ l Undertook, Kith the
assistance of Mrs. C. Ma*on Kiune of San Fran
cisco and Mrs. Cora A. Merrill of Oakland, to
draft a law changing this Evergreen home to a
State institution. We succeeded. ,
The law was passed and with a 0,000 ap- i
propriation for future maintenance and ;
Â¥3000 to meet any present deficiency. That !
alone was an act which Is an honor not only
to your representatives at Htcramento, but a
glory to Santa Clara County, and a blessing
which shall rest like a Jinlonf glinting sifu
thine upon the heads of Mrs. Dr. Secord, Mrs.
C. Mason Kinne and Mrs. Cora A. Merritt.
Nor aid I stop there in my efforts for the
soldler3 of my country. .-: Go to Yonntville, In
Napa County, and there the Soldiers' Home,
sow for the first time a State institution,
although, not in my county, owes to a very
large extent its success at my hands. Nay, all
the time my heart end voice and hours of toil
were given to aid and care for loose brave old
defenders of my country's flag.
Nor did I stop there. Go ask your Grand
Army Post here, and they wIW tell you that it
was through my efforts the petty charge of 25
cents forswearing, to pensions ana making
affidavits was stricken from the fee bill and
cut out of the county government act. -
Was that all? Nay. it was I who got a soo oo
appropriation fora Hamburg exposition, that
thÂ« fruit product of this county might find a
market in Europe. True, I did not do all these
things alone. , I was simply intrusted with the
duty, and the grand, noble, brave and honest
members Of this' Legislature stood by me, as I [
stood by hundreds of other measures to aid
them. ' -'â  !.â â¢>.* â  - ... ' R.i% .-â 
But, again,- when I, wax a candidate ray po
litical adversaries and personal enemies
fcoucht to defeat me with the cry of "railroad
attorney." .It was said that I was in favor of
the funding bill; and yet look at tho records
and there you . will find an Assembly joint
resolution requesting our representatives in
! Congress to vote against and oppose this meas
i ure., How did I vote? Just as I promisedâ
j against the funding bill. 1
Nor is that all. Wo want a waterwey to San
I Francisco. We want the Alviso Slough dredged
aud opened, and steamers â coining and going,
bringing and carrying out the freight of this
city and county. it was said that the railroad
company was against this measure, and yet
had it not been lor my voice and vote upon the
floor of the Senate the bill could not have
passed; and behold I, who am charged by the
snail-brained politician, who never has and
who never will do any thine for his county or
I country, with being a railroad hireling, gave
a $25,000 appropriation to the Governor for
nnproval, to dredge this channel and lay the
foundation lor an artery of commerce. Had I j
opposed it it could never have become a law;
with my support it stands a law so far as a
Legislature can make it.
These are some of the things which I have
a=s sted in accomplishing. I refer to them
only because they arc local and directly affect
our personal interest. True, in speaking of
them lam compelled to use the personal pro
noun "I," not that I would detract from the
ability, earnestness, honesty and labor of Hon.
F. ('. Franuk, whose fidelity to your interests
and whose integrity and uprightness made
him one of the bÂ«Â»st ana mos. useful members
of the Senate. Nor would I disparage ;he
work and care, the honesty and ability of Mat
America, Jack Kelsey and J. J. McLaurin ot
the Assembly, for these men were true to the
trust imposed in them and assiduously did
their duty with promptness and an eye single
to the interests of this county. They each
made records worthy of themselves and hon
oraole to the county". I speak of myself be
cause 1 am the one attacked not only by the
Examiner but by those little sheets to which
theiExaminer has sent out marked copies with
a request that they say something which the
Examiner may copy, to make people believe
that the slanders oi that vile sheet meet pub
lic opinion. â¢ .
Now. I believe in newspapers. I believe In
that high-minded, noble class of paper* which
I try to elevate the public morals, educate, set
forth lie "many great and grand things of our
; country and our civilization. The responsi
| bilities of the press are very great. -The news
; paper which takes the standard of truth
â¢ and right, and strives not only to furnish the
I news of the day from all over the world, but
j has constantly in view the uplifting of hu-
I manity, the promotion of the best interests of
i the country, becomes a factor or has influence
i in molding the thought and progress and
I greatness of the nation that no one but God
can estimate. But when a newspaper has no
other objector aim' than to appeal to vice,
licentiousness and crime, and seeks to live not
on honor, put revels in dishonor, then the
time has come when an educated and honest
public sentiment should drive such a paper
out of the market.
Let us see the truth. There was pending in
the Legislature a bill known as AssÂ«mblvbill
j No. 273, a bill framed to change section 170 of
j the Code of Civil Procedure of this State. It
i contained only the provisions now applicable,
I to Justice's Courts, and gave a litigant a right
to file an affidavit that he could not get a fair
and impartial trial by reason of the bias or
prejudice of the Judge; and upon filing such
I affidavit the Judge, if there were more than
one in the county, should send the cause to
some other Judge in the county, or if only one
Judge in the county then to some other Judge
or call on some other Judge to try the case.
' This was the effect of the bill. It passed the
Assembly and came to the Senate. Upon its
{ coming up for the third reading, on February
23, I moved to deny it a tnird reading. The
I motion was lost. 1 opposed the bill on two
grounds: first that I wanted it to apply to
criminal as well as civil cases, and because
j the affidavit ought to set forth the facts
j wherein the bias or the prejudice of the Judge
j consisted. But, it was claimed by the Sena-
I tors favoring the law thai it did so provide,
and that 1 was mistaken as to my construc
tion of the proposed bill. Thereupon a mo
tion was made that the vote be postponed
| until the next day. . Upon the next dayâ the
24th day or Februaryâ the final vote was
taken, and having no interest, directly or in
directly, in the bill, upon the request of Sena
tor Langiord of San Joaquin and W. F. Herrin,
my personal friend, by telegram, I voted for
| the oil. No one was there lobbying fi,r or
j against the bill. No man approached me
! other than 1 have just stated, but. with the
j purest of motives and purpose I cast my vote
I for the measure.
Now note the result: On Saturday, the 27th
' of February, without any reason or truth, the
I San Francisco Examiner came out and charged
1 as follows:
Bribery in aid of thieveryâ Thousands of dollars
corruptly paid members of the Legislature to influ
ence their voteâ Without a shadow of doubt mem
bers of the Assembly and members of the Senate
were bribed to support the billâ The price paid for
each vote bought in the lower house was .$l5Oâ Iq
the Senate a vote brought all the way from $350 to
$500.
Now, as I had voted for the bill I was neces
sarily included in this charge. -, I could not sit
still and bear the burden of thus 1 , being
i charged a felon. I arose from my seat and de
! nounced the article as far as I was concerned
' asÂ« lie, and the author thereot as a liar. And It
' was, and is, a lie. And the author thereof was,
I and is, a liar. â¢
What should I do? What should an honor
i able Senate do?, would you have done?
i Would you have sat in your seat and
let a falsehood like this pass by? No. No man
who was innocent could dare kit still and have
this lying sheet brand felon and coward upon
his forehead. Only a guilty man would per
mit this libel to stand unchallenged. 1 chal
lenged the article then and there. There was
no mistake in my utterance. The next day the
Examiner said:
The Legislature determined to know tbe truthâ
The innocent bent on bringing venal members to
book.â Explanation Monday morulnj. '
And then, in the body of the article, said :
In the Senate today Mr MorebouM defined his
| position in the matter by an cmi hatlc assertion of
] his own honest intention in vo'.lng for the meas-
I tire, and denying the truth of charges that had
t never been made against Mm.
It will be thus seen that only the next day
the Examiner acquits, me fully. I then had
i no light against the Examiner and it had no
fight against me.
But what should I do? Should I and all of
j the other members of the Senate stand quietly
by and have the body, or any member of the
j body, thus charged and not prove the truth?
I No. Then, on the Monday followingâ that is,
the Ist of March â I introduced a resolution
demanding an investigation, and had a com
mittee appointed with full powers.- We wanted
the truth. If there was a member of our body
guilty or taking bribes I wantedâ the Senate
wantedâ to know that man, bo we could expel
him. The Examiner said it was so. To the
Examiner, then, we must look for our proof,
and as it .said "beyond a shadow of a doubt,"
we supposed that that paper could and would
furnish us the fscts. Wo had no grievance
against the Examiner, for if it had written and
i published the truth then it deserved the high
i est commendation, We were ready, not to
j condemn it, but to praise it.
But behold the result. We subpenaed its
) editor and its reporters. They had nothing.
They knew nothing. The truth is that that
paper had willfully and deliberately lied. We
called before the committee' and put under
oath every member of the Legislature, and not
one had ever b3en approached, or knew of
any money being paid, or had been paid any
sum whatever, or knew of any one having
been paid, or of any person having money, or
any lobby for or against the bill. We put on
the stand the men who wrote the article,. and
I the editor who supervised its publication, and
I they knew nothing. They could not give a
. fact. They knew that the article was false,
and that they published the same because
they hud probably sold the columns of that
i paper to defeat thÂ« measure before the Gov
! ernor by falsely charging the members of the
Legislature.
Like curs at bay the vile slanderers when
put to the proof hid behind a refusal to an
swer, and the Senate under its biwful powers
! committed them for contempt Ihey took out
a writ of habess corpus before Judge Hushes
in the Superior Court and were again com
mitted to jail. Again they applied to the Su
preme Court of the State for another writ and
j again by the unanimous decision of that
j learned court they are remanded to jail. Now
I like hounds, as they are, they skulk and hide
away from the Sheriff until ft writ is 'issued
by Judge Morrow of the United States District
Court, and they are again remanded. Again
they appeal to the higher court so that time
may pans and the Legislature adjourn, for
they have learned from their attorneys that
the Senate's power terminates with the ses
-1 sion. All the ' way : * through with cowardice,"
i fraud and falsehood this dastardly and lying
' sheet h&s skulked and lied and slandered. . -
Why, then, after acquitting me doss it at
tuck? Because A. M. Lawrence camr> to me
and wanted me to. introduce In the Senate a
resolution turning over the whole investiga
tion to the Examiner, and because 1 would not
j do so and because I choose to push the inves
| gation to the end, and by so doing expose its
i lalsohood and libel to the public, I am se
| lected as tbe target lor its venomous and ma
| licious nttaok*. , ' ' -. â¢ .â â â â . - râ¢.
Have I done wrong? Nay; but the wrong Is
not in me nor in the Legislature, but in this
I lying sheet, whose vile and corrupt reporter
i and the vile and cursed A. M. Lawrence would
â  and did charge what they, and each of them,
know to be faiae. "
The wrong is not in punishing these men
for . contempt, for if they had any truth to
utter they could speak. Why should they sit
with Closed mouths? Because the informa
tion was confidential, they say. If confiden
tial, why then publish it? Are published
communications confidential?' What must be
the honor of a man who will publisn a lie to
ruin and injure and defame? Wfiat honor has
a man who will publish a falsehood, charging
a man with crime and then refuting to give
I that man the source of his information?
The fact is that the Examiner has no infor
mation. This Legislature wag making an hon
est record. i There was no lobby i.d no bribery
or attempt at bribery, and this vile and sen
sational sheetâ a curse to humanity, a disgrace
to our State and civilization, a menace only to
decency and respectabilityâ this purveyor of
falsehood and moral disease, finding that this
Legislature would adjourn with the grandest
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 28, 1897.
record for uprightnesg and honor ever made in
tbis Biate, deliberately determined to make an
attack and then stand by Its falsehood, in the
hope that its falsehood and poison would lodge
in the miuds of the people.
But, alas! the spell broke. Throughout Sac
ramento and the whole State to-night this
demon of shame and crime stands convicted
as a liar and poltroon. It has prostituted
journalism to the basest of use?. It has
tsou-ht to defame individuals because they
are houest and dared stand up and present
truth and right. Its purpose is tc destroy all
men who dare oppose them. But an inno
cent and houest man can fare them. Its at
tacks cannot harm. It has lied ko ion? and
so often that no one can be found outside of
an insane asylum who believes anything seen
In its columns. Its doom is written. It 3
power is gone. lathis matter it stands con
victed and no man needs fear it. Only a man's
enemies will read, except to loath and de
spise it. No paper in the State of any re
spectability supports it, and daily I am told
the people are ceasing to patronize It.
It lives only upon calumny and extortion.
It is laying the foundation for legislation
which will curb it, and has made certain the
election of any nominee whom it opposes In
tne future.
Take again the coyote scalp bill. Now I
voted against that bill. But what is there
wrong in it 7 I voted against it because we
had passed a resolution for a constitutional
amendment crenting a court of claims, and
1 believed that the poopic would adopt that
amendment, and, it bo, then every claim
against the State- could be established by
logul proof in a court of justice, and when so
established no question coul.l arise ts to the
right of the Legislature to make rh appropria
tion to pay such judgment. But the bill
known as the coyote scalp bill does not pay
out one dollar.
Every claim must be proved to the satisfac
tion of the Board of Examiners, which con
sists of the Governor, Secretary of State and
Attorney-General. They are to take the proof
aud when they are satisfied that the claim is
just and honest, and not until then, a claim
can be paid.
Thus the bill is an honest one. It only pro
vides a fund out of which honest clnims can
bo paid, but does not pay any dishonest
claims.
Why does not the Examiner state this? It
attacks men who voted ior it because they are
Republicans, but does not say anything about
the many Democrats who voted for it, even
including the Li-utenant-Uovernor. Is this
honest or fair? Who is Tactard? A man who
i< indicted by the Grand Jury of Kern County.
He sent dispatches. Did any one reply? No.
Is it not sirango that there is no reply dis
patch? Was there any money? If bo, who had
it? AVhÃtman took it? Wno got up the dis
patch scheme? Who was interested in it? No
one Diit Packard and the Examiner.
The truth is lhat the only corruption seen or
known about the Legislature was tho San
Francisco Examiner and its hired pals. I
heard nothing ot the corruption about the
coy ote-scaip bill. I do not believe that such
men as Hon. F. C. Franck, Hon. D. L. With
ington and Lieutenant-Governor Jeter and the
others in the Senate who voted for the bill are
dishonest met:.
Ido not know Packard. I did not see him;
but this I lirmly believe, that Packard was the
hired tool of the San Francisco Examiner,
whom it employed to si-ud out telegrnnn to
give that infamous paper a sensation so as to
relieve it from iis conviction of falsehood.
I do not believe that the penitentiary con
tains within its walls a greater and more as
tute scoundrel than A. M. Lawrence of the Ex
aminer. That paper hires men to lie, and
wheu they will not lie then the dÂ«ta furnished
by the reporters is shaped in the ollice into
falsehood. A reporter told me to-day that it
often happened that when articles wers sent
to the Examiner by its reporters tlie reporters
could not afterward tell their own writing be
cause some one having charge in the home
office would change truth into falsehood.
The fact is tnut the Examiner is the hyena of
moderu journalism, a wild jackal living
off filth and disease, in whose columns
everything that is nasty and corrupt aud
licentious and unholy finds place. It exists
only to defame, and has an existence only be
cause of the moral cowardice of public men.
But the day dawns. The people are awaken
ing to the truth, and before many years the
public sentiment of California will be so
strong, so great. 60 terrible and so mighty
that laws will be passed making it a felony to
publish such a paper, and uo honest or decent
citizen will take it or permit it to enter his
household. Of course It will attack me, be
cause I have dared to "beard the lion in his
den"; because I have dnred to clutch this vilo
thing by the throat and show to tho State its
ialbenood and it 3 calumny. Let it attack, and
while I am not great I find that it has never
failed to defame the great, whether living or
dead.
They are the same hyena class who repeat
edly denounced the matchless AbrahHm Lin
coln from 1800 uown to the time of his un
timely death, and then sought to blacken his
memory. They are the same gang of cow
ardly character assassins who called Roscoe
Coupling a. murderer aud hounded him with
relentless malice till he died. They are tho
ghouls who tattooed that maichlet.3 statesman,
James G. Blame, and then dug into his grave
and fed with fiendish glee upon his bones.
They are the same hellish demons who char
acterized Ulysses S. Grant as a drunkard and
scoundrel while he was in toe field risking his
life to preserve the Union.
They are the same pack of wolves which
slandered McKinley and published obscene
pictures of Mark Hanna. They have no de
cency or honeity and profess none. The time
was when they could injure and harm, but the
day has passed and I do not fear them â and
why? Because I know I am right, and be
cause I know I have the warm and honest sup
port of my own people, than whom no truer
people can be found. Therefore, 1 rest content
because, knowing the rectitude of my own Hie,
i have no fear lhat falsehood can hurt me.
And now, thanking you for your kindness,
yonr congratulations, your love and your
friendship, I bid you goodnight.
Senator Morehonse held the undivided
attention of his large audience for an hour
and a quarter. During this time he was
repeatedly interrupted by applause. The
speaker was in excellent voice, and at the
close of his remarks was greeted with
three rousing cheers. A large portion of
tbe audiencj came forward to shake hands
with the Senator after the meeting closed.
MORTGAGE SALE PREVENTED.
Property of. the Shasta Lumber Company
Aot J)iaposed OJ.
SAN JOSE. Cal., March 27.â A sale of
the property of the Shasta Lumber Com
pany which was to have been made to
day was postponed by reason of a re
straining order issued by Judge I. origan
against the San Jose Safe Deposit Bank of
Savings at the instance of Weils, Fargo &
Co.
A suit is also filed against the bank by
Wells, Far^o & Co. in which it is asked to
have a decree of court setting aside the
trust deed of the property held by the
bank in tne name of E. McLaughlin and
John E. Auzerais.
it is stated that the trust deed was
executed to secure loans to the Shasta
Lumber Company, which now amount
to $87,000. The Commercial and Savings
Bank has a second lien on the property,
in the form of a mortgage for $190,000,
and Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Bank holds the
third Men, in the shape of a trust deed for
$160,000. It is ailegea that the first trust
deed is void because it was not executed
by a proper authorization of the board of
directors, and, further, that an agreement
was made that the mortgagor should pay
tbe mortgage tax, which is contrary to the
provisions of the constitution.
Hearing of the matter will come np next
Friday.

MILL VALLEY'S
LIQUOR SCARE
The Temperance Town to
Have a Drugstore
Saloon.
Lease of Quarters on the Mnn
Street for a Term of
Years.
A Doctor to Prescribe "Sarsaparila
With a Stick" for Thirsty
Citiz ns.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 27.-A
clever scheme by which the clause In the
deeds of the Tamalpais Land and Water
Company, pronibitinc: the sale of intoxica
ting liquors in Mill Valley, i< to be cir
cumvented, has just come to li:htand is
to be sprung in a short time. Apartments
have been leased in a building on Throck
morton avenue, where one Maier is to
open a drug-store.
A Dr. C'aldwell has been employed to
take charge of the store and will occupy a
private room, where he is to sisn pre
scriptions, so that the thirsty citizens of
Mill Valley can get a drink of whisky
without violating the strict letter of the
law as laid down in the deeds oi the Land
ana Water Company. This company has
sold all land in Mill Valley with the
understanding that no person should sell
or in any way dispose of intoxicating
liquors for a certain term of years, which
expires in 1905.
The penalty is the forfeiture of the
property by the person violating the
agreement. This clause the company has
been particular to enforce, and a number
ofprosecutions have resulted.
The prohibitory clause in the deeds was
the cause of the establishment of a saloon
town near Mill Valley.
This place was named East Mill Valley,
but it nas become known as "Jagville."
Owing to its distance from Mill Valley
proper â about half a mile â it has never
taken well, so liquor has been sold on the
sly in Mill Valley.
The lease which Maier has obtained to
run his "drugstore" in for three years,
and Dr. Caldwell has made arrangement*
to take up â < is residence here.
What action the directors oi' the Tjira.il
paiÃ Land and Water Company will take
cannot be learned at this time, but it is
s-aid that the company will employ every
means in its power to enforce the clause in
its deeds.
The doctor's prescriptions are to be
printed on small slips, -and all he will be
compelled to<lo wi'.f betonll in the thirsty
citizens' names, sign tbe prescription and
the bearer will b& entitled to one glass of
"medicated sarsaparilla with a stick."
The drug clerk will fill the prescription at
the counter.
AÂ» many men's blood becomes heated
on a warm day, beer will be kept on hend
to correct the evil. It is expected that
many new complaints and alarming com
plications witl develop after the opening
of the store^
ARIZONA'S POLITICAL FEUD.
Forma/ Charges Against Governor Frank
lin Filed With the Interior
Department.
PHCENIX,' Aniz., March 27.â Uharges
of inebriety and misrepresenting the peo
ple of the Territory have been filed with
the new Secretary of the Interior against
Governor Franklin.
They are being prosecuted by Joel A.
Alexander, the Democratic boss of the
Territory, and by several other prominent
Democrats, and a secret agent of tbe In
terior Department has been here for the
pan wcei; and has just returned to Wash
ington with a muss of evidence.
The charges grew out of the Cuban
mass-meeting held here some time ago,
wherein Franiilin was denounced em
phatically for declaring that Arizona
would furnish "not a "man" to go to the
lront in case of war with Spain. After
the meeting Governor Franklin denounced
its Instigators, and there has been lots of
bard feeling between the executive and
the local leaders of his party ever since,
culminating recently in the censure of the
Governor by the Assembly.
When seen to-day Governor Franklin
said he bad received uo official copy of
the charr.es and did not know what they
were. He said he had made Anemies by
his stand against the ''infamous prison
contract" and against refunding the Pima
County warrants?.
He seemed to think these enemies were
responsible for the charges.
A Washington dispatch to the Arizona
Republican says the charges against
Franklin will be investigated before his
successor is appointed.
HIGH BINDERS AT STOCKTON.
Seek to Obtain the Re/ease of a Mongo-
lian Charged With Highway
Rcbbery.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 27.â The po
lice are to-night looking after a number
of highbinders who arrived this morning
and during the day from San Francisco,
and wiio are now located in the local
Chinatown.
They have made no demonstration as
yet, and it is believed that they are here
solely for the purpose of trying to square
the case against Mock Yee Wah, a San
Francisco highbinder, who is now in jail
on a charge of highway robbery.
Over a month ago Mock Yee Wnh and
three companions robbed tbe Chinese
laundry at LoCKeford.
They were captured by Deputy Sheriffs
Black and Wall before they* reached
Stockton. They had the purse taken
from the Lockeford Mongolian with them.
Mock Yee Wah was identified as a San
Francisco highbinder who was out on
bail on a charge of assault to murder in
thÂ« metropolis.
His countrymen succeeded in frighten
ing ao badly the man who was robbed that
he was placed in jail in order to hold him
as a witness. The highbinders are now
bending their efforts to secur.- the release
of Wah and his companions, but they can
do nothing with the authorities here.

ECHO OF THE CARSON FIGHT.
Neil I Da Haven Denies That Ha Said the
Men Contracted to Battle at Least
Ten Rounds.
CARSON, New, March 27-â The story in
a San Franciico dally to-day relative to
the bargain the fighters are alleged to
have made with the kinetoscope people,
whereby there wa3 to have been no knock*
out within ten rounds, is disposed of in
the following:
To the Editor of the Appeal : I wish to make a
reply to the utatemeiu made by the telegraph
ic correspondent of the Chronicle in the iisuo
of March JO. Ho quotes me as saying that
there was an agreinent between the tighten
and the kinetoscope people that they were to
tilth t at least ten rounds. His statement is
absolutely untrue. Mr. O'Brien, the corre
spondent, came to me on several occasions
ami stated that he had heard that there was
such Â« burgaln and warned to know what I
knew about it.
1 told him repeatedly that I knew nothing
of such v bargain made by any one and did
not believe a word of it. I told him not to
take notice of such rumors, f or if he d:d it
would keep him busy, as a new rumor was
started by some lunatic every hour. He cimo
azain and again to me and tried his best to
make me give some indorsement to the talk
about the fighters beinÂ« fixed.
I soon formed the opinion tbat he was sent
to me by Ratham, the Chronicle man, who
wss doing all he could to queer the fight, and
I was particularly oarelul not to make any
statement regarding the matter, except to
deny any belief in the rumors which I con
sidered came from the came source where so
many fakes came fromâ the man the Chronicle
had in town and whom Mr. O'Brien was assist
inp. Neill de Hayek.

Club at Mm Lout*.
CHICAGO, 111., March 27.â A special
to the Trioune from St. Louis says: Con
fidently expecting that Governor Stephens
will s-.en the horse-breeders' bill, which
incidentally permits the licensing of prize

Louis was incorporated to-day with a cap
ital stock of $100,000. Many St. Louis
men are interested, ana if necessity re
quired it could incorporate for $1,000,000.
The availability of St. Louis as a central
point, easily accessible from all sections
of the country, and the further fact that
Missouri will enjoy considerable of a mo
nopoly in a pugilistic way, should the
Breeders' bill be signed, are the considera
tions which led to the formation oi the
club.
No big attraction in athletics will be
neglected by the club. The first attrac
tion which will be secured and the one
which will Initiate the new clnb will be a
contest between Sharkey and Maber, who
have been matched to light some time
soon.
The new club will offer a big pnrse for
the men to meet here, and if necessity re
quires will outbid any other athletic club
in the country.
A New York club has offered $6COO for
the match and the ieast the St. Louis club
would offer is $10,000. The new club pro
poses to have a battle between the leading
lightweights of the world on the same
night of the Maher-Sharkey affair.

"Afraid - of - a - Cold."
The wise man at this time of the year
gives much thought to overcoats, over-
shoes and umbrellas and other things,
which insure safety in spite of changes in
the weather. Among other things is a
vial, of Humphreys' "77" for Colds, in the
pocket.
They find that other preventive meas-
ures may be forgottenâ that mistakes may
be made about the weatherâ that expos*
ure is often unavoidable, but "77" in the
pocket meets ail emergencies.
A certain proportion of the people are
always afraid of catching Cold or Grip.
The usual line of treatment prescribed by
them is, that easily spoken injunction:
"take care of themselves." Circumstances
are not always favorable for following this
good adviceâ something more is wanted
and It is found in "77." It is the only
thing that these "afraid-of-a-cold" people
can find that will prevent Colds and Grip.
"77 " always breaks up stubborn Colds
that "hang on."

The rain did not tend to keep people
away from the bicycle races last night,
the meet drawing the largest crowd of the
week. Since the management dropped
the amateur short-distance races from its
nightly programme the attendance has
been better. The , professionals furnish
the best sport and the pubhc likes their
riding better.
An accident in the final of the five-mile
club cup race spoiled what might huve
been a highly interesting finish. The
contestants were Kenna, Gooch, Russ and
Wing. Wing fell and Russ ran into him,
leaving only the other two to fight it out,
Kenna winning as he pleased.
Neither Wells, Becker nor the Terrill
brothers si-owed to advantage during the
night. It waa an off night with them,
surely, but with some light training ana a
good rest to-morrow they will be in
splendid shape for next week's racing.
It toot three preliminary beats to bring
the field in the five-mile open professional
race down to Stevens of lowa, Jones,
0 yrupic. Jay Eaton of Chicago and Fiovd
McFariand of ban Jose. The .final was
paced hv a tandem team made up of Mor
ris ami Sullivan. The order behind the
tandem was Stevens, Jones, Eaton, Mc-
Far and. The latter soon Wi-nt to tha
front, however, and Stevens let him .'all
in in front o' him. The time fur the tirst
mile was 2:11 3-5. Two mile- were ndrfen
in 4:25 1-5, :hree in 6:394-5, fourin 8:50 4-5.
Then the pace began to increase, ana iÂ»t
the end of the lourth lap tha tan iem
dropped ' ut. Eaton then jtimppd to '-lie
front, McFarland closely following. Mc-
Farand soon passetl him, with Jones
tacked on, and Stevens cut on the iaside,
anvt this was the over in which they fin
ished. It was one oi the best races of th
meet, the time for the five miles being
10:57 1-5.
Alter the preliminaries and semi-finals
of ihe iidii-miie open race bad been run
the iield was narrowed uown to Jay Eaton
of Chicago, Mom* of Texas, Mcjfariand

start the order w*s Morris, McFarland,
Eaton, Allen. McFarJaua moved up
iront on tne second lap ana Eaton on ihe
third. Eatou's sprint for home lasted the
ionpe-t and he won out, though witn lit
tie to spare, McFar.aud getting second
place, Morris third.
The of the five-mile rlub
cup race were run off last night. Tue
;emi-tinals were mile heats, the first bee
ing contested by E. F. Russ, O.yrnpib
Wheelmen; C. I). G>>och, Reliance Ciuy
Wheeimen, and F. G. Ltcey, Bay Cur.
Wheelmen. Russ was an easy winneK
Goods second. In the mber were J. R.
Wing, O:ymuic Club Wheelmen; J. A.
Kenna, Bay Ciiy Wheelmen, and R, A.
Coulter, California Cycling Ciub. Kenna
won as easily as Russ had, Wing running
second.
This brought Rtiss, Gooch, Kenna and
W-.tij; into the finai. Tuey were pacea by
Griffiths (Bay City) ana X.lord (Reliance)
on a tÂ«n ienj. At ihe start Rosa was the
first to fall in behind the tandem. Kenna
and Wir.g immediately inn ahend and fell
back, Kenn% catching on to the tandem
on tt.e inside as it passed. Wing tried the
same :nck and was successful, but Kenna
went out a<:ain after the tanderu and sot
it, and for a lime the others were content
to remain where they were, the order be
ins Kenna, RusÂ«, Good), Wing. Then
Wing went uu again and cau^:a the in
side, forcing Kenna out. Tnis last change
came near causing a bad upset and the
tandem team quit for a lap, yelling to the
referee to mate Wing ana Kenna quit
iheir fooling or they would not pace.
The reteree warned the men to be care
ful, and then the tandem went at it again,
the men catching on behind in the follow
ing order: Kenna, Russ, Gooch, Wing.
On the fourth mile Kuss and Wing fell,
from whose fault it was hard to teil, and
before they could remount the others had
gained two laps on them. After that it
was practically all over, for when the
sprint came Kenna had things ail his own
way.
It seemed too bad that the accident hap
pened, as it spoiled what might have been
a magnificent finishing ride between iour
of the best amateurs on the coast. The
time by miies wa* 2:10 4-5, 4:291-5
7:00 2-5, 9:44 1-5. 11:491-5.

POPULAR TRIBUTE
TO W. M. CUTTER
Sutter and Yuba County
Citizens Honor Their
Assemblyman.
His Course in the Legislature
Heartily Indorsed at a
Mass-Meeting.
The L waiaker Presented With a Can
celed Mcrtgag9 Against
His Home.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., March 27.â The
weather to-night was exceedingly stormy
and very uninviting, but the MarysviHe
Theater was well filled with friends and
adherents of Hon. W. M. Cutter, the rep
resentative iv the Assembly from Yuba
and Sutter counties, who had gathered to
do him honor and extend a substantial
testimonial of the high esteem in which
he is held by his constituents. This came
in the form of the mortgage on his home.
The instrument had been taken up and
paid by citizans, and to-night Mr. Cutter
was apprised that his property was free
from incumbrance aud given the canceled
mortgage.
The stage had been handsomely dec
orated with poppies and after the band
had played several selections the audience
was seated. Mayor Ellis and a number of
others occupying seats on the stage. The
Mayor read a list of tne vice-presidents
and then introduced Judge E. A. Davies
as the presentation speaker.
The tribute of Judge Davies to the
worth of Mr. Cutter as a citizen and as a
legislator was eloquent and sincere. In
concluding he tenderei Mr. Cutter the
canceled note and mortgage that had
stood against his residence, amounting to
$912 50. When Judge Davie? closed there
was much applause.
It was very evident that Mr. Cutter was
surprised at the form the testimonial bad
taken, and the first few words of his re
ply were hardly audible. Mr. Cutter re
sponded substantially as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen â
Friends Ali: For once in my life I am em
barrassed for words to express my feelings,
overpowered as I am by tins more than cor
dial reception. As your representative in the
Assembly, I have endeavored to do my full
duty, and the fact thai my effort have met
witn your indorsement is reward sufficient.
Tnut you should have tuoueht it lining to
supplement that indorsement by such a valu
able testimonial of your appreciation and re
gard was entirely unexpected by me, and
something thnt I migat have preferred
omitted; but, coming as it does with such
spontaneous good wih, I accept in the spirit
la which I kuow it is given, and thank, you
from my heart.
The lot of a legislator is not altogether an
enviable one. If he has tbe courage of bis
convict ons and cares to do what he believes
to be right, he is certain of newspaper abuse
and misrepresentation because of political
reasons, personal spite or to print a sensa
tional paragraph; but so far as I am con
cerned, so long as J can bend the knee before
ruy Maker with clearest conscience, 1 care
naught fur what any one may write or say or
think of me. It is well to have the good
opinion of your fellow-men, but it is better to
deserve it.
It has become the custom to speak of each
Legislature as worse than all preceding. Even
the legislature of which the editor of the
Kxaminer and the editor of the Democrat
were members was so characterized,
singular as it may seem. All of them are
wasteful, all are extravagant, all pass infamous
l>il is. if the press is to be believed; and yet.
when the statutes of each session are printed,
tbe charge is rarely found to be sustained.
The Chronicle calls the dredger bill and the
mining biil intamous bills, but that view is
not shared by the people of the Sacramento
Val'.ey or trie people of the mining counties.
In their estimation these bills are absolutely
tssential to our preservation of future pros
perity. It is beiieved that they will inaugu
rate a new era, and ih*t in coming years this
city of my home and love, which has so great
ly honored me on this and other occasions,
will rise to that position and iliirnity to which
her locatiou entitles her, and the citizens of
this aud our almost twin county oi Sutter, the
gar lun spot of the State, secure from the dan
gers that now threaten them, will enjoy that
prosperity which by natural right should be
theirs.
if in my humble way I have been able to do
anything toward bringing this about, I am
more, far more than repaid for the mental
strain and i>hysical effort. To know in addi
tion that what 1 have done meets your hearty
approbation is all that was needed to give me
content. Again I thauk you.
Mr. Cutter's remarks were loudly ap
plauded. They were followed by music
and several addresses by prominent local
neoplo of all political beliefs. Tbe sin
cerity of the greeting extended to Mr.
Cutter is a matter in which he and his
friends will take pride as long as their
memory serves them.
CHAMPION'S TROUBLES.
A Warrant Was Issued by Judge
Kerrigan for the Arrest
of "Fitz."
"Say, don't give me any snch josh as
that. Don't you think that I have had
enough of this sort of thing already? I'll
make some fellow sick yet."
These were the words used by Cham
pion Fitzsimmons last evening when be
was asked by a Call representative if he
had a visit from a Deputy Sheriff.
It appears that when Fitzsimmons and
â¢his manager, Martin Julian, were "rusti
cating in Carson, tbe latter, according to
the representatives of the People's Pal
ace, telegraphed his aeent in this City,
who is a man named Haller, to engage
the People's Palace for the evening of Sat
urday, the 20th inst., as the champion
would s ow there, in conjunction with a
vaudeville entertainment, which was to
precede the fistic exhibition.
Jul an, it is said, could not keep his ap
pointment and ho telegraphed his agent
from Carson on the day before the even
ing arranged for tbe exhibition to cancel
the engagement, as it would be impossible
for him to be in this City to attend to tbe
show.
William Lang Jr., who is doing busi
ness for Arthur Meadows, a collector,
swore out a warrant yesterday afternoon
in Justice Kerrigan's court for the arrest
of Filzsimmons and Julian on the ground
that they were about to leave this Stata
and thereby defraud their creditors.
The warrant was issued accordingly by
Justice Kerrii?nn and given to Deputy
Sheriff Dick O'Connor to senrt on the de
fendants. The.ideputy and William Lanf
Jr. repaired to "the ferry and watched tbe
outgoing boats which connected with tbe
overland trains at the Oakland depot.
But neither "Filz" nor Julian put in an
appearance. The deputy and the collec
tor then journeyed to thi Baldwin Hotel,
where the champion pugilist and his man
ager are domiciled, and at 9 o'clock last
evening the officer met Julian and Fitz-
Bimrnons, both of whom were notified that
he (the officer) was id possession of a war
rant for their arrest.
â¢ Meadows stated that Fitzsimmons and
Julian are indebted to tbe People's Palace
Company in the sum of $240â viz. : $200 for
the lease of the place of amusement and
$40 for theatrical talent.

The Scow Schooners in t?e Pay Had a Hari T.ms of It Yesterday Afternoon. "What With a Mild Southeaster and a Strong
Ebb Tide They Could Make No Headway and Many of the Captains Anchored in Despair.
IN THE STRESS OF
A SOUTHEASTER
Scow Schooners Battle
With the Wind and
Ebh Tide.
Many of the Captains Brought
Their Vessels to Anchor
in Despair.
The Oregon and" Petrel Would Not
Venture Oat, bat Anchored
off Sausalifo.
The scow schooners had a lively time of
it in the bay yesterday afternoon. Nearly
all of them were making their way down
the river and the southeaster and the
strong ebb tide, when it caught them off
Alcatraz, carried the i vessels away out
of their course. There were scows laden
with coal for steamers in the stream,
scows laden with ballast for British ships
en route to coast ports to load for Eng
land and scows laden with bay for the hay
wharf. Some of them came to anchor and
others backed and filled in a vain attempt
to weather Lombard-street wharf. It was
not until the tide turned that any of
them was able to make headway against
the southeast breeze.
The Amarapoora was one of the tramp
iteamers that caused considerable trouble
lo the scow schooners. Two of them went
out to her with coal, but after they eot
alongside they were told the blac*. iia
monds were not wanted, as the steamer
was going on tbe drydock. In t ha case
tbe coal-iaden boats had to beat back to
the wharf and tie up until the steamer is
ready to take tbe coal. The Amarapoora
is to go from here to Astoria to load wheat
and thence to Puget Sound to take on a
deckload of lumber, after which she will
sail for Australia.
While in Central American waters she
got very foul and her bottom is covered
with barnacles. In order to gftt her in con
dition for a long sea voyage sbe is to be
put on the Hunters Point drydocir. and
thoroughly overhauled. In the meantime
somebody will have to pay for the scows
that went out to her coal-laden and bad
to return to the wharf without discharg
ing.
The officers of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company and the merchants of isau
Francisco are again at outs. The latter
have hitherto been given from three days
to a week to get their goods off the Mail
dock, but now the only grace given them
is twenty-four hours, and if the goods are
not moved by that tir ie tliey are placed
in a United btates warehouseat the own
ers' expense. There has been considera
ble friction over the matter of late, but as
the Mail Company's wharf is bonded the
merchants have no recourse, and Just
simply pay up ttie assessments and say
nothing.
The steam schooner Green wood is hav
ing her boilers taken out at Folsom-street
wharf. New ones will bo put in, and at
tbe same time she will receive a thorough
overhauling.
"Where is the smart little schooner
Moonlight?" is the question asked daily
by men along the water front. She lett
here forty-two days ago for Seattle to fit
out for a fishing cruise. She has not been
heard from since and the worst is feared.
She was well provisioned on leaving San
Francisco, and miry have gone direct to
the fishing grounds instead of making a
stop in Puget Sound.
The schooner Arago will probably get
away to-day for the cod banks if tbe storm
is over. She will be the first of the Lynde
<fe Hough fleet to get away, and as sh; will
have an experienced crew aboard the
cf ten should be a erood one.
Captain J. A. Dollard of the wrecker
Whitelaw met witn a serious accident
yesterday. After picking up one of the
trucks that went overboard when the
steamer Sunol capsized the vessel was
headed for section 2 of the seawall and
the men proceeded ashore to enjoy a well
earned rest. There was a hole in the
wharf, and Captain Dolbeer put bis foot
in it, the reult being that his left leg was
broken in two places. He was removed
to his borne at 218 Chattanooga street,
wbore tbe broken limb was set, and be is
now resting comfortably. There is some
talk a bout an action for damages, but as
section 2 of the seawall is an inclosed
wharf and State property it is asserted
that no action can lie against the Harbor
Commissioners.
The boatmen at Meiggs wharf and Val
lejo and Folsom streets assert that the
great race will take place to-day, rain or
shine. There are over a dozen entries, ao
the winner may be sure of at least a $50
prize. The contest between W. M. Fitz
gerald and Dave Crowley Sr. will also take
place, so the usnnl Sunday crowd should
witness some ffood racing this afternoon
from Powell-street wharf.
There is trouble brewing between the
wharfingers, collectors and laborers on the
water front and the treasurer of the Har
bor Commissioners. The former are nearly
always broke before the month is half
spent, and in consequence haye to resort
to the warrant system. Max Goldberer
has had control of the entire patronage of
1 he water front, and his ratf hns been and
is 5 per cent a month. H. D. Kowe, how
ever, stepped in and offered to do the dis
counting for 2 per cent a month, and got
considerable patronage. One of the labor
ers, however, discounted hi 3 warrant with
both men, and when it came to pay day,
altiioueh both brokers had their warrants
in, Goldberg was givÂ«Â»n the preference and
got the cash, while Rowe is oat and in
jured.
In consequence he has withdrawn from
the business, and the wharfingers, collec
tors and laborers are indignant, one and
all asserting that ''there ia something
rotten in the State of Denmark."
The battle-ship Oregon ana the gunboat
Petrel were to have gone to sea yesterday.
They both eot under way, but came to an
anchor in Richardsons Bay. The bar waÂ«
breaking and a heavy storm reported off
the Oregon coast, so both captains decided
to remain in port. The Oreeon is bound

Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
The grandest invontion of the age for weak men ; the surest and easiest cure for all nervous and
chronic disaases. Its wonderful power is directed to the seat of the nervous system, through which
its vitalizing strength penetrates into all parts of the body, carrying new life to every function which â¢.
has been weakened by.excesses or dissipation, restoring energy to the brain and power to the muscles.
Dr. Sanden is a physician of the highest standing among the medical profession, having
devoted thirty years of his life to the practice of medicine, and has given it up now for several
years so that he may devote his knowledge exclusively, to this better, more effective means of
rescuing the sick and weary from despair. He has given to the world this remarkable creation of
his brain â the Dr. Sanden Electric Belt â and personally supervises its use in all cases, so that in
not one single instance may it fail to do all that he claims for it. He is an expert in medicine and
an expert in electricity, and every one of his patients receives his personal attention until the final
happy result is reachedâ a permanent restoration to health and strength.
THIS GREAT BOON IS YOURS.
In using Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt the patient is assured of two very necessary points â that
he has the very best, most scientific, strongest and most durable Electric Belt that can be made,
and with it the personal attention of a regular physician until cured. It is impossible to imagine a
more effective means of fighting disease. All medical men sanction the use of electricity, and Dr.
Sanden, by his personal attention to his patients, makes his Belt do the work which has baffled the .
skill of medical experts of all countries.
SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT.
The following are extracts from letters recently received :â â â¢â ..-.
. '"i feel altogether a different man. I have worn your Belt thirty days, and if I improve as much the next month
I shall be a well man. . My emissions are stopped, and I feel so bright and fresh that I am more than pleased with
the Belt" â¢'; . J. D. GIPSON, Shasta, Cal.
' "When I first put your Belt on, four months ago, I could not walk, I was so badly paralyzed. Now 1 can walk
a mile without even a crutch or a cane. lam improving all the time, and expect to be entirely cured soon."
GEORGE H. BLISS, box 191, Reno, Nev.
" Your Belt has done me a great deal of good. I have not had an ache or a pain since I.commenced to wear it.
My wife has had rheumatism for years, and it has done her lots of good. There is no question about the merits of
â¢ your Belt. 1 would not take $50 for mine. GEORGE MADSELL, box 91, Milpitas, Cal. \
"I purchased your Belt for weakness and pain in the back. By its use my sexual powers are completely
restored and the pain is all gone. I would not part with my Belt for anything if I could not get another." â¢
" â  â¢ CHARLES FORREST, 310 Twelfth street, San Francisco, Cal.
"I am feeling fine and in great spirits. My trouble is all gone and I am getting stronger every day "
C. A. FISCHER, Santa Clara, Cal.
.-â¢ - <,â  "I am much improved in every respect, and have confidence in myself that I never in my life before thought of
having. I used to be always thinking of my trouble, and imagined that everybody else knew about my weakness
Now. I feel stronger than any one. I can feel the current from the Belt warming up my body and putting new life into
all the parts. 1 can never be too grateful to you." - V : y .E. M. SNODGRASS, Albion, Idaho.
DR. SANDEN INVITES YOU TO CALL.
It is a pleasure to Dr. Sanden to talk with a non-believer in the power of his Belt, for in this
way many are convinced by scientific proofs who would go on from year to year suffering from a
curable disease. He will examine every patient free of charge, and state honestly whether a cure
is possible. He can gain nothing by misleading a sufferer,' as his best advertisement is the good he
has done ; and he will take no case where his belt is powerless to cure. He therefore invites a call
or a letter from .all who are sick or weak, so that by personal study of the case he may lead his patient
to renewed health and happiness. If you cannot call personally send for his famous book Three
Classes of Men," which is full of clean, wholesome facts, and has the letters of hundreds of prominent
men in all sections of the State who have been cured by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt Call or address

MRS, SCHEPPLER FOUND.
She Will Return to the Home of Her
Parents.
Mrs.Bessie Scheppler, who mysteriously
disappeared three days after becoming a
bride, has been located by her husband
and her parents, and will return to the
home of the latter in the Mission.
She declares that she left her husband's
home and protection because her marriage
was distasteful to her, and that she had
been persuaded into it by the pressure
brought to bear on her by her mother.
Wnen she had been duly installed in her
new home, she says, the idea of killing
herself came to her. Tke rest of the story
is then best told in her own words:
"While I was looking out of my window
an expressman happened along, and on
the impulse of th<- moment I hailed him.
My trunk was ready, as I had not un
packed it. I gave him the address of the
friend with whom I hare been staying,
threw on my coat and tat, jumped on a
car and wax there as soon as the trunk.''
She signified her intention of returning
to her parents' home without delay. To
this, her husband slates, he will make no
objection, and her parents will welcome
her back with open arms.
Airs. Scheppler declares she will never
live with her husband. The latter says he
will not seek a reconciliation, but if his
bride 19 willing to return he will g.'adly
receive her.

BUT THREE RACES
Losing Tickets Were Lib
erally Strewn About
at Ingleside.
Mr. Skinner Tcok the Gentle
men's Race With Flashlight
in C'ever Style.
Tlorp?, Astride Recreation, Downed
The Cheat, With Sloan Up, a No,e
for the Ul man Stakes.
The inclemency of the weather kept
many race-goers away from Ingleside
track yesterday. The card was a vers
ordinary one, and this fact perhaps fig
ured extensively in keeping many lovers
of racing indoors. Of the seven events
ran favorites captured but three.
One of the features of thÂ« card was a
race for gentlemen riders over a mile,
which served to display the superior iad
dle-work of Frank Skinner, who piloted
Flashlight, the 9 to 10 favorite, with the
skill of a professional. Getting his mount
away from the post first, Mr. Skinner
opened up several lengths of daylight be
tween himself and the other four starters,
winning with ridiculous ease from Atti'
cus, ridden by Lieutenant Haines. The
latter rode a very clever race, beating the
pecund choice, Yankee Doodle, with Mr.
Archibald in the saddle, by a length for
the place, driving. To the rider of the
winning horse was presented a very hand
some gilver cup, offered by the association.
The Ullman stake for two-year-olds at
four and a half furlongs, with a held ot
seven starting, seemed to furnish one of
the prettiest finishes of the meeting be
tween Recreation and The Cheat. The
former, bidden by Thorpe, was a 3 to 2
cl.oice in the betting, with 16 to 5 offered
against The Cheat. The latter was away
first and it narrowed down to a duel
through the stretch. Thorpe, on Recrea
tion, outfinished Sloan, gaining the Ter
diet by a nose in the fast time oi :55. Sir
William was an ordinary third.
A mile purse event opened the after
noon's sport. Morte Fonse closed a slight
choice over Marjone and Adolph
Spreckels. Morte Fonse was away poorly
and failed to get inside the coin. In a
drive Adolph Spreckels beat Hazard out
half a length in I:43}^. Mamie Scott, a
15 to 1 shot, was third.
The erratic Peril landed the next race,
a six-furlong selling sprint, starting an
even-money choice. She made all the
running, winning at the end very cleverly
irom Reel. Pertiaps, the second cfcoice,
was third.
Trainer Frank Brown was again in hard
luck With Yemen. Starting equal favorite
in the bettine on the third event, over six
furlones. with Applause, the aced SDrinter
was headed ali tne way by CseÂ«arian and
beaten out less than a length in 1:14^.
The winner opened an 8 to 5 favorite, re
cedine to 3 to 1.
Not at all surprising, the hurdle-race
over one an J a half miles resulted in the
crowd being dumped. Tuxedo was a
beariiy played 4 to 5 favorite, but Arundel
made him quit early in the game. The
Intter horse was in turn easily teaten at
the end by J 0 C, ridden by McMahon, a
sto 1 cbance in the betting. Herman, the
"lobster" horse, was third.
All calculations went astray in the sixth
event, a seven-furlong purse run. The
Eastern crowd backed Satyr down from 8
to 5 to 6 to 5 for a good thin?, and he
faiieel altogether to connect. The 11 to 5
6econd choice Vincitor was also unable to
negotiate the route, ending up in third
place. Taking tfle lead from Altivo when
half the distance had been covered Geprge
Palmer led the rest of the way, finishing

winner was 6 to 1 in the betting.
NOTES.
Georee E. Smith (Pittsburg Phil) left
for the East yesterday, loser to the extent
of about $15,000 since his return from the
scene of Corbett's downfall.
Judging from the race run by Morte
Fonse he is not a Saturday horse. A
member of the wise ones who got aboard
early was said to have tried to "off his
bets' before the horses went to the post,
though for what reason wai not stated.
For the second time Adolph Spreckels
carrying Ed Corrigan's colors was
"boosted." After winning the openinc
race he was bid up $400 over his entered
selling of $400 by George berry.
W. Martin put up a very timid ride on
Hazard. He acted like a jockey that was
afraid Pat Dunne's horse might beat out
the Corrigan entry.
After the races the judges suspended
Maynard, the jockey who had the mount
on Auteuil in the jumpine rac , and
ordered the horse taKen from the track.
They announced that they thought that
neither the ]oÂ«key nor the owners were
out to win. Auteuil was heavily played.
Berkoloy Won Â»t BaÂ«e ball.
For the sake of a very slim and sedate little
crowd that strolled into Central Park yester-
I day afternoon to see a baseball match between
; the Univrsity of California ami Santa Clara
| College a contest early stopped by the rain
; was resumed and dragged to the end of the
fifth inning as an exhibition game. The regu
lar match was called oHf after two innings hnd
been played and tluÂ» score was 2 to 2. Then
j Kelly, t^anta Clara's pitcher, who had promised
much by striking out four men, retired from
EUTLER AND HIS DOUBLE.
I the field and allowed any old thing to have a
] try at twirling the muddy, uncontrolable ball
lat the Berkeley batters. Kaarsberg pitched
throughout lor the university. He seemed to
have some speed, fair control and almost im
perceptible curves, but, like Fitzslmmons, he
oould be hit. Both sides did some heavy
batting. Santa Clara's errors and the ap
parent negligence of her catcher were re-
I sponsible for a number of Berkeley runs. The
| final score, including the two innings of
serious playing, was University of California
11, Santa Clara College 4. The deferred match
will probably be played some day next week.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 28, 1897.
TWO DROMIOS
IN REAL LIFE
John J. Reardon, Laborer,
and Butler, the Mur
derer.
A Most Extraordinary Resem
blance Between the Two
M n
Chief Crowley, Captain Lees and
0 hers Am z d When They
Saw Reardon.
People who have read Shakespeare's
"Comedy of Errors" will remember the
two Dromios, who resembled each other
so greatly that they were always mistaken
the one for the othpr.
Yesterday thÂ« police had a practical
illustration of the two Dromios, and De
tective Bainbridge ana Corporal Geimann
had no end of fun in watching the startled
look that came into the faces of those
whom they encountered.
John J. Reardon, a laborer from Clover
dale, would be arrested on s:ght by any
one looking for Butler, the murderer, now
in the County Jail waiting to be token
back to Australia to stand trial for his
horrible, crimes.
To use a common expression Reardon is
a "dead ringer" for Butler. He was ar
rested Friday nizht on Drumra street, as
he was very drunk, and was taken to the
Harbor police station. Yesterduy morn
ing he was taken along with other drunks
to the City Prison, and when Bainbridge
and Geimann saw him they were amazed.
'I am surely not dreamine," sain Bain
bridqeashe rubbed his eyes and looked
at Reardon. "If that isn't Butler it's his
twin brother."
"Where did you come from?" asked
Geimann.
"I came from Cloverdnle," replied Rear
don, and the tones of his voice were
identical with Butler's. "I got drunk hist
nigh 1 , lost my blankeis and my cbat and
here 1 am."
"Did you ever hear of Butler, the Aus
tralian murderer?"
"Butler?" queried Reardon. "No, I
never heard of him. Who is he?"
"This is the most extraordinary resem
blance 1 ever saw between two men," said
Bainbridge, musingly, "and if I didn't
know that Butler was" in the County Jail 1
would swear that he was standing before
me."
Reardon is the same height and build
as Butler. He has the same dark hair and
swaitny complexion, the tame darK mus
tache, the same little side whiskers de
scending each side :or about an inch and
a halt' below each ear, the same eyes and
eyebrows, the i-anie nose with its pecu
liarly shaped end, the same mouth, the
same smile, and strange to say wore a low
crowned stiff dicer, just the same as But
ler wore when arrested. He said he
bought it in Clorerdale.
Reardon was without his coat and wore
a vest nnd airty blue overalls.
After the drunks had been disposed of
in Judge Campbell's court, Reardon was
taken by liainbridge and Geimann 10
Captain Lees' office. When the captain
looked at him he nearly fell off his chair.
"Where did you get him and bow did he
get out of the County Jail?" asked the
captain in one breath. HeJaugheJ heart
ily when it was explained to him that it
was not Butler, and called in Chief Crow
ley. The Chief was as much amazed at
the remarkable resemblance to Butler,
and said in all his experience he had never
seen ili<> like of it.
Some o! the aelectives hailed Reardon
as Butler, and to keep up the deception
Geimann told them Butler had been re
leased on a writ of habeas corpus, and had
got drunk and been arrested.
Reardon took the whole affair good
naturedly, and willingly allowed himself
to be photographed.
"Ten years ago," he said, "1 used to
work on the water front, but got tired of
it and went into the country and have
been working on ranches since then. I
have been working recently at Cioverdal-,
and tnoucht I would take a trip to the
City, so I packed up my blankets and
things and came on yesterday morning.
"I put up in a boarding-house on the
water front, and got too much whisky in
me. I don't know where the boarding
house is, but the police are to help me
find it.
"How old am I? Well, 1 look like 40,
don't I? But you will haraly believe me
when I tell you I was born in 1834 in Ire
land. I came to New York when 1 was
young and fought through the war. Then
I drifted here and t here, and finally came
to the coast. 1 didn't expect to cause
such a sensation when I got here yester
day, and I would like to see this man
Butler."
When Reardon was arrested he gave his
age as 40, and he looks more like it than 63,
as there is not a gray huir in his head,
and be is a? straight and agile as Butler.

INJURY TO
THE STATE
One Bad Effect of the Local
Pure-Food Cru
sade.
Many Local Grocers Ciaiin That
the Board of Health Is
Not Fair.
They Say Producers Should Bj Prose
cuted and Not Those Who Buy
in Gocd Faith.
The retail erooers of this City are very
deeply annoyed at the action of the Board
of Health in causing the arrest of many
who have the reputation of dealing only
in first-class goods. They believe that
the ordinance passed in the interests of
pure lad had but one main point in
view â the prevention of sale of goods
containing injurious substitutes for the
genuine article. There are many prepared
food products, they claim, which in order
to properly preserve and give a body to
are combined- with other food products
equally wholesome and no cheaper.
For example, orange and lemon jellies.
It is well known that the only way to
make these delicacies is by flavoring pure
apple jelly with lemon or orange. The
grocers declare that to make an arrest be
cause the base of orange or lemon jelly is
found to be apple would be a gross injus
tice, and would drive the manufacturers of
tnese jellies out of business. The same ar
gument they declare applies to dozens of
the other prepared goods equally pure
and wholesome. Another complaint is
that tne arrests are frequently of mem
bers of firms who do all in their power to
carry only the best that money can buy.
This course by the Board of Health is
sure to produce bad results, as it will
drive respectable local manufacturers out
of business entirely.
The members of the firm of Goldberg,
Bowen & Co. are greatly annoyed that one
of their number, Jacob Goldberg, should
have been arrestea (or selling impure or
adulterated food. George W. Whitney,
one of tho firm, in speaking of the arrest
of Mr. Goldberg, made the following state
ment: *'Our firm desires to carry only
first-class goods, no matter what the cost.
This is what our patrons want and this
is what they must have. So you see there
is no reason for us to carry adulterated
goods.
"Several days ago several men came in
and purchased several samples of the
jellies. One of these brand* is made in
Los Angeles, the other in San Jose and
the third in New York. These samples
were taken to the Board of Health expert
chemist, W. T. Wenzell, who a little later
declared tbat the jellies made in Ban Jo*e
and New York were pure, but that the
one (currant jelly) made in I,os Angeles
was adulterated with apple jelly, and was
one part currant and three parts apple
jelly. Upon this showing Mr. Goldberir
was subjected to the humiliation of beine
nrri-stt-d, dragged off to jail and he will
have to stand trial like a common law
breaker; and for what? Because Chemist
Wenzel arrived at the conclusion that
there was apple in the currant jelly.
"We at once wired to the manufacturer
at Los Angeles, W. 11. Bernard, of what
had happened. We got an answer from
Mr. Bernard, who assured us tbat there
was no apple in the composition of the
article mentioned. He wrote on the follow
ing day and in the letter he stated most
emphatically that the jelly is mode of
fresb fruit, currants, cane suzar and
water. No other article, ingredient or
alteration, not even coloring matter. The
statement of the Bernard-Dsnsmore Com
pany 1* eood with us and with all who
have had dealings with the firm.
"What are we to do in such a case as
this? There does not seem to be any re
dress for the mortification of Mr. Gold
berg, or for the reparation of the injury
done to our firm. Does the Boara of
Health contemplate that every grocer in
the City shall have a private chemist
whose duty should De to examine every
shipment of gouds received? I am as
much in favor of pure food and pure-fooii
laws as any one in the community, and 1
am in favor of punishing those who know
ingly violate the laws. But those who
violate the laws are those who put poison
ous and injurious adulterations into their
goods, the manufacturers, I mean.
"Why don't they arrest the producers
of such goods and make them suffer if
need be? It would be a far better way
than by arresting those who in good faith
purchase what they expect to be iirst-class
goods for a gocd trade. If their inspec
tors find impure goods on the shelves oi
the grocers it would be a much better way
to call the attention of the grocers to the
fact and let them get rid of the objection
able articles, instead of running our most
reputable citizens off to jail like so many
petty thieves.
"As to the goods in question, those that
were the etiuse of Mr. Goldberg's arrest,
we have submitted the same lot to Chem-
iÂ«t Price, whose reputation is well-known.
We are waiting to see if he can had any
injurious Mibstances. If lie does I wager
tiiiit conies from the Los Angeles water
and not from the fresh fruit or the sugar."
Mr. Whitney states that the pure-food
crusade, as it is being carried on by the
Board of Health, is working a great injury
to one of tne most promising industries of
the State. He lays that everything should
be done to encourage f ruitjpacking and can
ning. Yet the reports go abroad, ali over
the world, that San Francisco grocers are
being arrested by the dozens for selling
impure and adulterated goods.
The natural supposition ia that Snn
Francisco dealers handle California goods
principally, and this idea will oe most
heartily encouraged by Eastern canners.
Thus the trade with California in these
goods will be shut off speedily and effec
tually. As a result the canners will have
to go out of business and thousands of
dollars' worth of fruit in hundreds of
orchards go to rot for want of a market.
In the meantime California will have to
eat the product of Eastern canneries.
CONFERENCE POSTPONED.
Three Members of the Board of
Health Unab'e to Meet the
Grocerymen.
A large number of retail grocers, headed
by John Nobmgno, the secretary of their
organization, assembled at the rooms of
the Board of Health yesterday in expecta
tion of a conference with the board re
garding the arrest of grocery aipn for sell*
ing adulterated food articles.
They were much disappointed when
Garret McEnerney, the attorney of the
board, decided that inasmuch as a quorum
was not present no meeting could be held.
Dr. Morse sent word that he was ill, an
other doctor said ttiat one of bis children
was ill and a third was unable to be pres
ent because his wife was fcr from well.
Mayor Fbelan was attending the laying of
ttie'cornerstone of the Affiliated Colleges.
It was decided to defer the conference to
some future date.
The grocerymen want the manfaclurers
of adulterated goods arrested instead of
themselves.
Muat Produce Price.
United States District Judge Morrow has
stated that he will not stand any more aou
sense in the Price case. Warren E. Price was
convicted of sending obscene matter through
the United States mails and sentenced to
eighteen mouths' imprisonment and to pay a
fine of $500. Reserved four months of the
time, and was men released on $5000 bonds
pending an appeal of his case 10 the United
States Supreme Court The latter tribunal has
afiirmed the judgment of the District Court,
but Price ha-i been Blow about delivering him
self into custody again. Yesterday Judge
Morrow ordered Uie two sureties on Price's
bondâ Henry F. Burua and Mrs. M. V.
Thomasâ and the attorney to produce Price
in court on penalty of the forfeiture of the
bond on next Saturday.

A DOCTOR'S ADVICE.
Under no circumstances should the Electro-Medical cure be confounded with the ordinary
electric treatment as applied by common batteries or with such etude magnetic appliance* as
electiic belts and the like. â  The Electro-Medical Care is different in fundamental principle,
different iv application and different in effect. It Is adapted to the old ana the young, the
nervous, bilious, lymphatic : In fact, to each and every condition of the human system. By
this discovery medicine is not distributed indiscriminately throughout the system, bat it
passed directly to the diseased parts.
The expense of static batteries and more advanced delicate and costly electrical mechanism
Tents the larger proportion of the medical fraternity from purchasing them. Herein the
Bute Electro-Medical Institute excels, as it possesses the finest electrical plant in the word.
Their use of these arip'.iauces in the administration of medicine, or what is known to the
scientific world as the Electro-Medical Cure, is the result of expensive and exhaustive experi-
mental research. The X-Ray has proved itself, in the hands of specialists of the Institute, it
Inestimable value in determining the location and character of disease. *

One of Worth's latest creations will be pleasant to j
ths ladies of San Francisco who hare beautiful arms
free from pimples, blotches and old ssrsaparill* trade-
marks. The latest fad in the big- eve shows the fore-
arm entirely. The sleores aru just as larg-s, if not

the elbow to the wrist the arm is bare. Here is a fit
illustration of the sleeve and arm : .
There Is no doubt that this new fashion win â¢Â©"a be
in vogue, and from the humblest to the most arrogant,
from the delicate to its extreme opposite, all' fashion-
able people will be wearing these pretty sleeves.
Spring' is at hand. Good housewives are preparing
to clean their houses, shrewd merchants are redecora-

is sending the Juices up trees, and all people who are
careful will take a spring medicine. Now, the ladles j
who us* Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla will be sure to
have no pimples, will be sure to have no blotches, will
be sure to have no red spots on their arms, while those
who take a Sarsapuilla containing potash and mineral

A Fonl Stomach ; and Ha Appetite.
Edvrin W. Joy Co. , 269 Stevition $trtet. City
Oksti.-micn: Many years ago my bowels bothered mi
considerably. I neglected them, thinking, as many
men do, that I was strong: and healthy, and could
easily throw the trouble off. However, the more I
neglected myself the worse I grew, until what was eos-
tlveness became, a foul stomach. I lost my appetite,
grew thin, and what had been very simple became a
very severe and complicated case. â¢ | j : :-\ - . \
For some years I tried doctor after doctor, but with
no good results.'- At times I would think I was gain-
ing, but'alas! it was but an illusion, and as time went
on I grew, worse and worse, until my food consisted of 'â 
water and a few hardtack biscuits during, the day. I
had about given up all hope of ever receiving any
help for my disease, and had quite made up my mind
that for the few years of life left that ray cross was to
be that I should journey on life's rough way a starv-
ing, complaining, sleepless, disagreeable dyspeptic, a
trial to my friends and a nuisance to myself.
About this time I came across'one of "your little
pamphlets, and resolved to give your home remedy,
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, a trial. So I bought a
bottle and began to take it. The medicine began to i
operate and benefit ', me; ; roy bowels gradual^- grew :
regular and I began to make flesh. After about three j
months I was a new manâ quite as well as I have ever i
been in my life. This was over three years ago. S-: I j
still continue to keep your valuable medicine in the j
house, and I take *it once in a while to keep the sys- |
tern in good working order,' and to regulate the !
bowels. â¢ , â '

I callod on Mrs. C. J. . Prudbomrce of 134

i lady i* well known in this city and has a host ;
:of mends. When I stated that it was my pur- j

I Dublic she demurred at first, stating she did not |
: like to have her name in the papers. Just then ,
j she had a caller, a friend, a lady. . '
The customary salutation was given and the
expression rushed forth: " Why, how well yon
look, Mrs. Pi" There was rmy opportunity. !
Her friend admitted it was certainly a remark- j
able recovery, and then Mrs. Pradhemme was
pleased to gay:
Before I begun using: Joy's Sarsaparilla I ;
was emaciated, always tired, never being able :
ito get a good night's rest. Every one said I j
looked sick, and I know I felt sick. I had no |
! appetite. I was utterly listless.' I could not
\ attend to the most trivial hounw affair without
feeling irritated. Now, I did not become a well
i woman all of a sudden. I took your medicine
â  | about a week, and while I felt relieved from
. 'â  the first, yet I did not pet real good and strong
i ; cntil after I had taken the second bottle. -
I " After the second bottle I looked as the pic-
i ; tuns shows. lam mdood grateful to yon for j
1 j your visit, and I think Joy's Vegetable Sar- j
1 I sapor ilia the best medicine known. . It is cer-
tainly a very fine laxative." , . . , \
' After leaving Mrs. C. J. Prudhomrae I talked |
; with a lady well acquainted with the recovered
one. The, (rood woman was in raptures and .
spoke plainly. , She said: "I don't believe in.
j patent medicines, but Joy's Vegetable j Sarsa-
i parilla is no patent medicine. It is a good
\ family remedy. I believe it would be good for ;
â¢ every woman to take Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
i parilla when she felt out of sorts. I know
'â¢ j how badly Mrs. Prudhomme looked, and I can j
1 i well realize how she must have felt. .. .7--^

Why You Are Tired.
Why You Have Neuralgia.
Why You Are Anemic.
Why You Are Nervous.
Why Your Head Aches.
These conditions are the results of an improperly
nourished system. You are tired because you can't
eat heartilyâ because your food does not digest prop-
erly. Lack of nerve food causes you to have neuralgia.
Neuralgia makes you nervous. You are anemic be-
cause your blood is poor. Your head aches because
you are tired, because you are anemic, because you
have neuralgia, because you are nervous. You are
tired because your general system is depleted and ii â

agreeable conditions are manifested while you are in

Your system is not nourished when you have a foul

liver is torpid. Your system is not nourished when
your bowels are constipated. Your system can't bo

NEW TREATY
Three - Cornered Alliance
With Asano's New
Steamer Line.
A MUTUAL PROMISE NOT
TO DISCRIMINATE.
The S. P. Will Put the New
Line on a Plane With the
Pacific Mail.
PROBABLE AMITY BETWEEN
THE HEW AND OLD.
President of the Southern Pacific
Denies Any Wish to Assail
His Associates.
The Southern Pacific has got out of the
â¢nay of the new Japanese steamer line be
r'ween San Francisco and China and Japan
md so have the allied old trans-Pacific
â ompaniesâ the Pacific Mail and Occiden
tal and Oriental.
This move to one side vras made
yesterday at an Important conference
between S. Asano. the president of
the new seventeen-knot competitor for
the Oriental carrying trade, and Colonel
C. F. Crocker, J. C. Stubbs and others cf
the yellow building who run the existing
transportation line that leaches from
Hongkong to New York.
Colonel Crocker, betides being vice-presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Company, is
president of the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company and is the active
manager of the affairs of that company
and the Pacific Mail. Mr. Stubbs" func
tions ns general traffic manager are ex
ercised oa the sea as well as on the land.
Mr. Asano. had a brief and satisfactory
talic with Collis P. Huntington, and then
a more extended one with Colonel Crocker
and his lieutenants.
The assurance given Mr. Asano that the
Southern Pacific power would not be ov
posed to the success of tne Toyo Risen
Kabushiki or Oriental Steamship Coni
nany was expected, but it was the first
time ;hat it liarf been definitely given.
When this Japanese millionaire first
came to the coast a few months ago seek
in? the most advantageous terminal for
this new Richmond of the sea he made in
quiries of tne Southern Pacific powers
about tne traffic arrangements he could
effect with them if San Francisco %vera
made the American terminus. But tne
Southern Pacific people, knowing that He
would discuss the enterprise with ot.'ier
transcontinental companies, and not
wishing to give him levers to use on
rivals, simply told him, iv effect, that
they desired to have his line come to San
Francisco, and tnat when he was ready to
come to San Francisco they would talk
b:;Â»!nsss wit!) hita in a satisfactory way.
As a railroad company the Southern Pa
cific people were naturally anxious to se
cure the additional transcontinental busi
ness.which a new line of steamers to the

v.asso sudden that not a muscle of the
body quivered. Tbe horrifying scene was

turned faint-at the dreadful spectacle.
COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON Welcomes the New Japanese Steamer Line and Declares His Kind Intentions.
Orient would bring this way. On the
other hand the railroad people are the
principal owners of the two trans-Pacific
steamer lines, whose business it was theirs
to protect and the poss-ssion of which
! gave the Southern Pacific long hauls on
so great an amount of teas, silks, etc.
That is the situatipn of the railroad peo
ple, as a great new subsidized steamship
line comes to the front ambitiously and
I enters their transportation field. They
realize that as iar as the steamship busi
ress is concerned peace is better than war
anyway when the enemy would be a com
pany of larce capital, big subsidies ami
cheap operation and that the railroad
would get the business on land, however
it was divided on tho water, while the ad
ditional business the new company might
wrest from other rivals would feed the
railroad coffers.
So it was that the rulers of the steam
ship companies and the railroad gave Mr.
Asano s line a kindly welcome yesterday
and bade him be cheerful and kind him
self.
The new line will not have its steamers
ready until a year from May 1, so that the
j understanding reached yesterday was
j only a preliminary and general one, bat it
was nevertheless a definite and important
advance in the new enterprise which will
mean much to the maritime commerce of
this port.
Mr. Asano state I what was first stated
publicly in The Call of Thursdayâ that
| San Francisco had been finally and defin
itely determined upon as the American
terminus of the line. He was assured
through his secretary and interpreter, Mr.
Kobayashi, that the railroad comuany
was interested in having this City made
the terminus, and he was told that as to
traffic arrangements the Southern Pacific
would extend the same advantages as
those enjoyed by the Pacific Mail and the
Occidentafand Oriental.
The basis of the working relations be
tween iheaa steamship companies and the
railroad was outlined and assurance was
given that the new line would be placed
on an equality with them, and not dis
criminated against.
| 111 health, no wort, no home and gen
eral despondency merging into suicidal
mania were the direct and remote causes
of Bohn's frightful death. For the past
j twenty-five years the man has been cm
i ployed by J. Serres, the proprietor of the
lodging-house at 771 Howard street, cor
ner of Fourth. Of late the old man Â»has
not been very useful and was even a nui
sance in ttie kitchen, where he was em
ployee as a dishwasher ana handy man.
On the stli inst. Serres decided that he
did not want the old man around any
more and he sent him away.
This was too mnch for Bohn. and with
What little money he had left he went to
a lodging-house at 138 Fourth street and
hired a room. Luter in the night the
landlady of ti.e place discovered tnat the
transient lodger was trying to end his life.
He had attached a rubber tub? to the gas
jet and the other end he placed in his
mouth. He wss inhaling the deadly gas
when discovered. The landlady had the
old fellow tairen to the Receiving Hospi
tal, where temporary relief was given,
after which he was sent to the City and
! County Hospital.
A few days ago Bohn was discharged
from the hospital. Penniless and borne
j less he went back to his old employer,
j who gave the aged servant a small room
!in the top of the building. This room
opened out upon the roof, which, of
course, made the distance to the sidewalk
fnliy five stones. During the forenoon
but little was seen of Bohn.
The first intimation of the tragedy was
i a shriek from Mrs. Gertrude Haze, who
was !n a store on the opposite side of the
street at 772 Howard street. She saw the
body while it was in its downward flight.
The arms and le<Â»s were extended and fly
ing in space. A second later there was a
sickening crash on the stone wait. Only,
I the lower half of the face remained whole.
j The rest of t c bead was scattered over a
space of twenty feet. â¢ An examination
of the body by tee Coroner's deputies
showed that it did not contain a whole
bone and the flesh was mashed to | a pulp.
Deceased is said to have a wife and two
sons living in Oakland.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 28, 1897.
The further understanding was reached
that the new line should effect some ami
cable arrangement with the old companies
by which sailings should alternate and the
peace of rates and business be preserved.
Wiih this general understanding the de
tails will be worked ont in due time.
Mr. Asano has given very thorough
study to the possibilities of business for
the new line, as well as to the compara
tive advantages of Pacific Coast ports for
terminal purposes, and the decision for
the future which now appears is the re
sult.
The three new 6000-ton steamers
which Mr. Asano recently contracted for
in England will be of about the size and
capacity of the China, be handsomely
fitted and will have a speed of seventeen
knots. The service will be well calculated
to invite patronage.
The line will hare other advantages,
however, on which its success will be
mainly calculated.
"No American or English steamship
company can keep to the ocean in compe
tition with it," is what Captain W. L.
Merry, secretary of the Chamber of Com
merce, said yesterday about it.
Tiat liberal subsidy offered by the Jap
anese Government for the fostering of
Japan's maritime creatness i 3 the chief
thing to look at. Captain Merry has well
informed Litnself about the Japanese sub
sidy law, and he recently compiled a
statement which Senator White used on
the floor of Congress. Mr. Merry has cal
culated the subsidy which the new line
will receive as follows:
On each 5000- ton foreign-buiit steamer
with an average speed of fifteen knots,
there will be a lonnace payment of $1250
per 1000 miles. The round trip between
Yokohama and Ban Francisco is about
9000 miles, giving a tonnage premium per
trip of $11,250. A extra premium of 10
per cent on each 500 tons over 1000 tons
yielas $9000. A speed premium of 20 per
cent additional for each knot over ten
knots adds $11,250, making $31,500. An
ambiguous pa-aage in the law seems to
allow an additional speed premium, which
would make the total subsidy per trip
BRIDES FOR A
SMALL DOWER
Market Rates for Chinese
Women Said to Be
Cut Down
By the System Pursued in the
Presbyterian Mission in
This City.
Bridegrooms Must Pay Seventy-Five
Dollars for a Wife, if They
# Can Aff rd It.
A rumor has been current in Chinatown
for some time to the effect that the Pres
byterian Chinese Mission, over which
Miss Culbertson presides, is supported by
dowries given by Chinamen who marry
female inmates of the institution.
A Chinese woman ordinarily costs all
the way from $700 to several thousand
dollars, in proportion to her beauty and
her accomplishments, which fact is cited
by those who are spreading the rumor as
tending to prove that the Presbyterian
Mission is a chenpener of rates in the
slave market.
The rumor says that when a Chinaman
! desires to marry and finds the price too
' high in the open market he goes to the
1 Presbyterian mission, where "he catcheo
; gal wifee" for a money consideration paid
j to Mi&s Culoertson.
That lady was interviewed by a Call
; reporter last night. She is confined to her
i room by sickness and was very much sur-
I prised to hear of the rumor. She ex
plained the matter by saying that a
i Chinaman who marries a pjirl In the mis
| sion is expected to pay a year's board for
her, which amounts to $75. This sura is
exacted from tho^e oiuy who are able to
| pay, and is the maximum sura required
of any one, no matter how many years
the woman may have been an inmate of
the homo. p
All the expenses of the home, including
! board, washing, repairs, etc., am unt to
I only $100, exclusive of salan>f>. The total
i cost, including salaries, is $195 a month.
This money is supplied by the Foreign
Board of Missions, whose headquarters are
in New YorK City, and to whom Miss Cul
bertson sends aJI the receipts of the home,
inclndlng the $75 marriage fee and all
other donations or earnings. Every year
the ladies in charge of the several missions
are called upon by the board to make a
statement of the total amount of money
they wish to use during rhe coming year,
and if there is sufficient money in the
fund the board allows it; otherwise only
ns much as can be spared is tent, and then
the greatest economy is observed.
Miss Culbertson added that rarely as
many hs twelve marriages take place dur
ing the year of girls in the home, and the
grooms in oil cases do not pay the $75, so
that the receipts from that source are not
considerable.
"Some comment has been made," said
Miss Culbertson, "on the fact that we
have established no borne for boys. The
$40,500. At eight round trips per year the
annual subsidy would be $324,000.
This subsidy appears to be smaller than
will be earned by the line, as the steamers
are announced to have more tonnage and
speed than Captain Merry has assumed.
This advantage is something for ocean
carriers of other flags than that of the
rising sun to gravely consider. The Japa
nese line will have a further advantage of
cheaper wages and cheaper supplies.
The Toyo Kisen Kabushiki is greedily
watching the Suez business between New
York, Europe and the Orient, and that is
one of its fields of conquest. The silks
and the teas which are diverted from the
Suez route thitherward will give that
much more to the through commerce of
this port. In this carrying trade the
Southern Pacific, with its Sunset route,
and the Morgan line of steamships from
New Orleans to New York can offers more
advantageous connection than can its
rivals.
"Mr. ABano 1 has had two conferences
with President Craig and myself," says
Captain Merry, "but all we know is that
San Francisco will be the terminus of the
new line and that he will be ready for
operation in about a year. We have told
Mr. Asano that ihe Chamber of Com
merce would do all it could to secure the
company proper wharf facilities, and no
other aid has been asked of us. The
operation ot this new line must add to the
maritime commerce of this port by its
ability to bring more business this way.
It will undoubtedly tend to establish
closer commercial relations between Ban
Francisco and Japan and steadily increase
our business there."
President Huntington expressed regret
ihat in the course of the interview he had
granted on Friday some of his expres
sions should have l*en, as he claims, in
advertently misunderstood. Ue explained
this yesterday by stating that he had not
meant to be understood as flinging de
nance at any of his associates in the South
ern Pacific Company, but simply as stat
ing that he was confident of being re
elected president of the corporation.

we could not afford to open such a home,
and in fact there is no necessity for it.
"ltshould be remembered that Chinese
boys are well cared for by their parents,
and are not treated as inferiors, as are the
girls. Neither are they Kidnaped or sold
into slavery. This home, of course, would
not be a suitable place for beys."
There are thirty-six Chinese women and

NOW THE POLICE
LOOK FOR MORGAN
The Missing Attorney
Charged With Felony
Embezzlement.
As a Forlorn Hope the Creditors
Are Searching for
Property.
A Story That Morgan Was Domiciled
at a Local Sanitarium Proves
a Canard
Should E. M. Morgan, the attorney who
recently disappeared mysteriously from
town, elect to return he will lind himself
confronted with something more serious
than a horde of angry and deceived
creditors.
The case of Morgan took a new turn
yesterday, when a warrant, sworn to by
Mrs. E. Shaw of 118 Ellis street, and
charging the missing counselor with
felony embezzlement, was issued froiff tne
Police Court for that individual's arrest.
The State Prison, therefore, is a possi
bility for the man who for many months
was to all appearances enjoying as good a
practice as any attorney in the City.
Like most of those who are now bewail
ing the exit of Morgan, Mrs. Shaw also
intrusted her collections to him. Her
loss is only $150, but she believes that this
is not too insignificant to warrant punish
ment fcr ils taking and hesitated not to
call for Morgan's arrest. It is understood
that numerous othor warrants will do
forthcoming Monday.
There seems now to be little prospect
that Morgan will be found right
away, for the impression seems to be that
he has by this time put one of the border
lines of the State between himself and his
pursuers. There was a story extant yes
terday to the effect that Morgan had not
left the State at all, but on tne contrary
bad been taken quite ill and wa3 domiciled
in a well-known sanitarium. True enough
a Mr. Morgan was found at this dace, but
it was not the much-wanted Lawyer
Morgan.
The story of Mrs. Curtiss probably car
ries with it the foremost element of mis
placed confidence, in connection with
Morgan's affairs, yet told. Mrs Curtiss
was one of his clients. He secured a di
vorce for her some time ngo, ana with the
decree went an allowance of $1000 as ali
mony. The latter amount Morgan is said
to have withheld from the lady upon the
pretext that he would invest it for her.
She recently asked him for an accounting,
and she says he confessed that he bad
used the money. H6 promised to make
the amount good, however, but when she
called again he had already taken night.
The books and papers which Morgan
removed from his office to his home just
before taking his departure are now in
the hands of his creditors. Their only
hope is that these may di-ciose the fact
that he owns some property â but they
acknowledge that even this is a decidedly
forlorn hope. So far as can be learned at
present Morgan's shortage will amount to
between $6000 and $7000.
Dr. Mattner says Morgan owes him
$1500, and Edward Wingate, a Nevadau,
hewails the loss of $1200 more. With the
exception of Mrs. Cnrtiss' claim it is said
by those who claim to have some idea as
to Morgan's business that all of the other
unpaid bills will ranee from $10 to $400
each. Most of these are bills that were
put into Morgan's hands for collection
and are supposed to have been collected,
but not accounted for.
Commencement Exerciser.
The commencement exercises of the educa
tional department of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association for the winter term will take
place at tho association auditorium. Mason
and Kllisstreets, next Thursday evening, April
1, ai 8 o'clock. The departments in German,
Spanish, bookkeeping, elocution, vocal music,
stenography, mechanical and freehand draw
ing and electricity will be represented. A
short address will be delivered by Professor
A. Putzker of the University of California, and

be distributed and specimens of class work
will be on exhibition. Cards of admission
are complimentary and may be secured at the
association office or irom any member of the
educational department. The past season has
been very successful.
Agents Go North.
The six weeks' investigation into the affairs
of the Custom-house has been concluded by
Treasury Agents More, West and Cnllum. The
latter goes north to-day, and Mr. West will
follow sioou. Major More is stationed at this
port. The departure of the two special agents
for the north is said to be for the purpose of
investigating the reports that large quanti
ties of opium have" recently been smuggled
across the Canadian frontier into the United
States.

BUT SIX VOTES
The First Election Contest
Does Not Alter the
Ultimate Result.
Co' burn Defeated for Councilman
by the Narrow Margin
of Nine.
Many Peculiar Ins'ances of Marking
the Ballots Were Noticed During
the Recount
Oaklaxd Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 27. \
Nearly every candidate at the recent
election was in Judge Hall's courtroom
this morning when the election contest
came up between J. S. Colbarn and Ja mes
Henneberry, Councilman-elect from the
F.rst Ward.
Colburn contested on various grounds,
staling that on account of his name being
similar to that of another canaidate named
Carroll he lost enough votes to have over
come the narrow majority of Henneberry,
â¢which was but T&f teen votes.
Attorney Fitzgerald represented Mr.
Henneberry, and in bis argument stated
â¢^Â£.&t the complaint should be overruled,
V as the contestant did not state
j:ae number of votes he claimed to have
lost through carelessness of the officials.
Judge Hall did not agree with him, and
for a little time Attorney Button, who
represented Co! burn, Attorney Fitzgerald
James Henneberry Gains Two.
and the Judge had an argument on the
aiiegea informalities in the complaint.
Finally Judge Hall decided that the best
way to settle the whole affair was by re
counting the votes of tne First Ward, and
he so ordered.
While the votes of the different council
men from tne ward were Deinc called off
about a dozen politicians kept snap tallies
fo r other candidates.
When the bandies of ballots were pro
duced by City Clerk Tom pkins, there was a
stir in the courtroom wnich plainly indi
cated that there were present some who
evidently expected to find the result of
the election turned completely around by
the recount. "Scrap-iron Clark," who
missed being a counci:man-at-large by a
few thousand votes, looked on with all
the eagerness of a man who expected to
find that he had been defrauded of enough
votes in the official count to enable him to
un s eat George J. Earl or Billy Heitman.
The attorneys carefully registered every
possible objection to any ballot that did
** Scrapiron " Qarkc Looked Ofl.
not favor their candidate and these bal
lots were carefully laid a^ide by the order
of the Judge, who stated that when the
recount was finished if there were sufficient
disputed ballots to affect either candidate
they would be taken up and passed upon
one' at a time. It is not often that the
public have en opportunity of inspecting
k ballots alter they arc deposited in the ba -
I lot-box, and the many mistakes made
r show that there are msny voters in Oat
land who do not thoroughly understand
the Australian ballot system. One bahot

was objected to because every candidate
was properly marked with the exception
of It. J.'Egan for Library Trustee. Against
this candidats's name the voter had made
a big cross with a lead pencil.
On another ticket tbe voter had care
fully niaKed the red crosses immediately
after the names of tbe candidates, in
stead of in the little square marked on
the ballot for the purpose.
The Third Precinct of the Fi rat Ward
was taken up and completed and when
all the objections had been ruled upon
the vote stood lleuneberry 139, Colburn
121. By a strange coincidence these
figures showed that each candidate lost
exactly two votes by the recount, so that
tbe majority of Henneberry was not
affected in the least.
Id the next precinct some enthusiastic

anti-ealoonist spoiled his ballot by mark
ing red crosses three times abreast of the
anti-closing proposition, and somebody

cis is once more ambitious. Hav
r pride tickled by being elected
as the place for holding the
ncil of the Young Men's Insti
s State, it is now desirous of se
curing the Grand Lodge of the Foresters
next year.
R. Reed and Frank B. Hooson were
elected delegates las>t night to the annual
camp which meets on May 4 at Marys
ville. As it is a general practice to hare
this camp hela in different parts of the
State, so as to equalize somewhat the dia
tances which delegates have to travel, it is
considered a feasible proposition to make
a bid to obtain the next annual gathering
at Hay wards.
The town has proved what it can do
with a large gathering, and the delegates
to the Young Men's Institute convention
last year all agree that in no place bad
they bten better treated or received more
agreeable accommodations.
Having this record on which to fall
back the delegates to the Foresters' camp
intend lo make the best use of it and to
work to bring the delegates into this
county next year.
F. B. Hooson was one of the'Y. M. I.
delegates ti.at succeeded at Vallejo in
having Haywards chosen for the Grand
Council ana he will make the best use of
bis past experience.
"Hay wards has always been too mod
est," said Mr. Reed last, night, "but we
are now beginning to wake up. Before
the electric railroad from Oakland brought
us several hours nearer to that city, we
perhaps had no business to make our
selves heard. We certainiy were in no
position to handle a big crowd expedi
tiously or economically.
"Now, however, this is all changed and
we want the Foresters of California to
come to our city and we will guarantee
that they shall carry away with them the
opinion that Haywards is iv no way be
hind any other city of her size in the
march of progress. We shall go to Marys

McCHESNEY MAY
MAKE A CHANGE
Would Like to Be Secre
tary of the University
Regents. ;
The Veteran High-School Prin
cipal Says He Will Not
Make a Fight. ; >
Much Interest Shown by the Faco'.ty !
in the Probability of a
Change.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
' . 908 Broadway,' March 27. ,' .
Principal McCuesney of the High School
is a candidate for secretary of ho Board
of Regents, and as it is believed that lie
has some support, including that â¢of |
Regent J. West Martin, the fact that h? j
may leave the â¢" High School has caused
interest in educational circles.
Professor JlcChesney Has been at the
head of the High School since it was or
ganized, and in the event of his severing
his connection with the School Depart
ment there are many who aspire to suc
ceed him.
Since the death of Secretary Bonte the
Board of Regents has left his place va
cant, but it is Riven out that at the next
meeting of the Board of Regents in April
a successor will be appointed. There are
many candidates, and as the position has
attached to it a salary of $3000 per annum
no one will win without a struggle. It
was not known till to-day that Professor
McChesney has been quietly '[ making an
effort to obtain this position.
When asked about the matter he Baid:
'I am n candidate and lam not. I mean
by this trAt I would like to have the posi
tion, and have expressed my desire. I
cannot, however, get cut and make a cam
paign or do any politics because such
practices do not coincide with my nature.
I will not co around buttonholing tlie
Regents, but at the same time I should
like their support. If the position be
offered me or if I can obtain it with the
minimum amount of effort then of course
I wouiu welcome it. I do not intend to
do a whole lot of work or to overcome any
opposition that may be put forward by
other candidates. I Know I have some
support, but I cannot tell how much. Of
couri-e it appointed I should have to leave
the High School, as the secretary of tbe
Board of Regents has a very responsible
position and needs to devote all his time
to it.
"At this time, however, I cannot say
what may be the result. Next month the
board will appoint a successor Jo the late
Mr. Bonte, and I will admit that I hope I
shall be tbe next secretary of the Board ol
Regents."
In a few words Mr. McChesney will not
seek the office, as he is too far ndvanced in
years to do any active canvassing on his
own account, but if the office snould seek
him he will be more than willing to ac
cept it.
In the event of his election by the
Board of Regents there would bea va
cancy in the High School, and several of
the professors on tbe faculty would like
:o succeed Mr. McChesney. During the
past few years, about June, when the an
nual election of teachers of the Oakland
School Department is held, there has been
a little opposition manifested toward t c
re-election of the old principal, but it ha 3
never amounted to anything. Should the
position be vacant there will, of course, be
a scramble for the place when the annual
election of teachers takes place at the first
meeting of the School Board next June.
THAT TICKET TANGLE.
It Still Remains us Much of n Muddle
as Ever â A Definite Decision Prom
ised for Monday Morning.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 27.â The mud
dle about the tickets for the municipal
election remains much in tne same con
dition as yesterday, and is apparently no
nearer solution. Tlie fact is, the Austra
lian ballot law does not contemplate the
nomination of candidates by otlier than
re uiar party conventions or by petition.
Consequently, when, as in this city, par
tisanship is sunk and the nominations are
made by organizations in which party
lines are not drawn, the law does not pro
vide means for meeting such an erner- j
tencv. The nominations were made by a !
meeting calling itself a Non-Partisan con- i
vention, by ano:hor called the Good Gov- I
ernment Club, by means of the postal j
primary and also by petition. But in no
ca?e were any of these bodies conventions

WAYMIRE HAS GONE EAST
He Will Visit the President
and May Get a
Plum.
Politicians Are Speculating Abou
the Judg 's Sudden cni Unex
pected Departure.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
Q'JS Broadway, March 27. f
Judge Yv'aym ire's family v,-ere surprised
to-night when they were asked regarding
his mission to the East. They did not
know that his departure had been made
public. Miss Waymire admitted that her
father had left suddenly, bat said she was
not informed of the cause.
"My father left to-day for the East,"
the snid, "but I am not at liberty to state
what it was that caused his sudden de
parture. I believe it was private business.
I really cannot say whether he was called
East by President McKinlev or not. I
I know that he expects to be absent about
; three weeks, and that he wil see the P.-es
| ident before he returns. He might have
1 pone Eusi with the intention of calling at
| WftÂ«hing;on, but I cannot say positive! v."
When the politicians of Oakland heard
j that Judge Waymire had suddenly left
for the East they looked askance, and re
called the tact that Judge McKenna snd
' denly left for Canton a few weess ago and
jis now a Cabinet officer. Since the elec
i tioft of a United States Senator at Sacra
| rnento it has always b-en thought that
there was something good in store for the
j Alameda Assemblyman, and curiosity is
now greatly excited.
It would not cause any surprise if the
news should come in a few days that
1 Jud c Waymire had received the promise
of one of the prominent Federal appoint
ments for which candidates are now
Choked by n Bean.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 27.â An in

He put one in his mout U while he was sit

A NEW AND POWERFUL BODY
TO BE FOBMED.'
Associated Cycling Clubs to Bo the
Basis of the Organization
in This State. â¢
Chief Consul Frank H. Kerrigan of
North California Division League of
American "Wheelmen has tendered his
resignation as an official of the great i
cycling organization, thus firing the first |
gun in the secession movement that will j
eventually involve nil of the league mem- j
bers in the division mentioned.
The trouble is of long standing, but
first came to a head when Mr. Kerrigan
went East as the delegate of the North
California Division of the annual meeting
ot the league. The California representa- I
tives fought vigorously the proposition to
refuse sanction for Sunday racing and an
nounced that, the large majority of league j
members in this State would withdraw if I
they could not race as they desired. They
were laughed at and the Sunday racing
voted down.
On Judge Kerrigan's return to this City
meetings were held and a majority of the
larce ciuba piedzed themselves to with
draw when the membership of their mem
bers expired. It was then decided to
form a new organization on this coast
with the California Associated Cycling
Ciubs as a basis, ana ignore the league en
tirely if it d:d not see lit to recognize the
California wheeling interest in its new
form.
With this end in view a resolution was
adopted at a meeting of the bosrd of
governors of the California Associated
"Cycling Clubs, held on the 19th inst.,
authorizing changes in the constitution oi
the body that would make it. in all intents
and purposes the successor of the league.
Chief Consul Kerrigan's resignation was
sent to Stanley G. Scovern, the secretary
treasurer of North California Division,
last evening, and read? as lollows:
San Francisco, March 27, 1897.
Stanley G. Scoveni, Secretary-Treasurer of the
A. Cal. Div., League of American Whee'mcnâ
Dear Sir: 1 here'oy tender my resignation as
chiei consul of the North California Division
of the League of American Wheelmen.
In explauation of niy action in this behalf
I believe it fitting that I should outline the
reasons which have brought me to the con
clusion that this is the only courae I can con
sistently take.
As the hÂ«-nd of a cycling organization in
this State tatini? money from its members in
the form of annual dues, it seems to me that 1
should be in a position to say *o each contrib
uting member: "Our organization is doing
the best work possible for you and for cycling
interests in this State, aud is expending the
money you furnish it to your greatest advan
tege." If I reach the conclusion that I am
not in a position to say this, if I come to be
lieve that with the same annual dues, wiih
the same expenditure of money, a cycling or
ganization can be formed in this Stale that will
and can do more good for cycling and for the
State, then 1 consider that 1 should be occupy
NEW TO-DAY.
SCIENCE AND DISCOVERY.
CONSUMPTION CAN BE CURED.
Convincing Free Offer to "Call" Readers of An
Eminent New York City Chemist and Scientist. ,
1 tfP'u I "
/
(Scene in the Slocum Laboratory. The Doctor illustrating the power of his New System of Medicine to Medical Men and Students. )
JCotbing could be fairer than the een-
erous offer of the honored and distin-
guished chemist, T. A. Slocum of New
York City.
The lact has been established that he
has discovered a reliable and absolute
cure for consumption, aim all bronchial, '
throat, lung and chest diseases, stubborn
pougliÃ, catarrhal affections, general de-
(jliHÂ« and weakness, loss of flesh and all
renditions of wasting away; and to make
i:s wonderful merits known he wi'l send
f J2JIEE FREE BOTTLES (all different)
pf his newly discovered remedies 10 any
jifflietori reader of The Call who wiU
writs for them.
Already his "new scientific system of
medicine" has permanently cured tnou-
baiidÂ» of apparently hopeless cases by its
me a false position in remaining chief consul
of the North California Division.
And I have reached that conclusion, not
hastily, but after a careful consideration of
the conditions that surround us here in Cali
fornia and a personal comparison with those
of the Eastern State*.
The North California division now numbers
some liiOO members. It ali these should re
new their membership for tr,e coming year
they wouid pay iuii) lhe Lcaeue Â«>f American
Wheelmen the sum ot $1000. Of this sum
$1040 would be seni to the Enswrn office nt
the league for its support and $500 retained
for the support of cycling interests in Cali
fornia.
We sent East last year from February 1,
1890, to January 31, 1597, of money received
lrom members $10tÂ»!Â» 25, and for money re
ceived for sanctions for race meets over the
sum of $300 net.
in return for this money what do we (ret?
The League Bulletin is really the only prac
tical and tangible reÂ«ult, which io tho National
body is a mere nominal expense. Of course,
there is the general work of the league for the
improvement of roads and highways, but the
effects of that branch of its work doi;'t begin
to reach to this western oorder, and we have
not felt them. Work in those lines must be
done locally, with our own legislatures, our
own Board of Supe rvisors, und by and through
our owu efforts. That has been the way what
ever has been done lms b_-en accomplished in
the past and I see no reason to expect more ef
ficient aid irom the National body in the fu
ture. ,
California is a State far removed from the
center of government of the league. The Con
ditions here are vastly different from those
that exist m the New England States. Aud
yet, irom our very remoteness, it nas proved
impossible to bring the governing body of the
c pie to an understanding of these diffur
loe wbole trouble with the National organi
zation may be summed up broadly in the
words, "It has outgrown itself." Its existing
constitution was not patterned on lines fitted
lor the organic law of an association of Slate
divisions us numerous, as widely separated, as
diverse in needs, habits, temperament and
characteristics as it now contains.
If we are ever to have a lasting and success
ful National organization it must take for its
model our own Federal constitution â that is,
lay down the broad principles oi the objects of
the body and the lew general characteristics
needed to give uniformity to the organization ;
but leave to the various .State divisions the
right to legislate upon matters of local or tem
porary import, upon matters dependent on
local conditions ami environment.
This is not the spirit of the constitution of
our National organization. It is not the spirit
of the majority of the members who compose
its governing body. Tne desire seems to be
to control every detail of the destiny of each
State division;' to legislate ior localities and
people they have never seen, and do not under
stand, and this, too, even against the expressed
wish of the divisions they are seeking to con-
trol.
On the floor of the National Assembly and
through the press of the United States a de
monstration has been lately made to the Na
tional Assembly oi the needs of the Western
and Southern uivisions in the matter of ex
tension of racing privileges. Because a ma
jority of delegates, coming from me New Eng
land States, felt that their localities would not be
benefited by such an extension of racing privi
lege, whicn' proposed privilege they need never
have exercised, tne meMore that was proposed
was voted down and the Southern and Western
divisions were denied the privilege of local
legislation on a subject, lrom its very nature,
local.
I mention this instance merely as an exam
ple oi the narrow policy that concentrates the
legislative power in the National body in such
a way as to impede the progress iinl retard
the development oi those State divisions where
progress and advance is most possible.
1 need not mention here tnat I have always
been in tne past an earnest advocate of the
league and its work (though with the feeling
always that greater returns couid be afforded
us), and this was for the reason that I felt the
necessity, n cycling was to live, of some power
strong enough to control the racing side of
the sport. For a time the league seemed
capable of doing thisâ seemed to be doing itâ
despite the fact that the control of racing was
not originally contemplated in the scheme of
its organization. Bui at the recent meeting at
Albany it became unmistakably apparent
that a body composed as the governing board
of the It-ague is couid not long continue to
give proper attention to this branch of the
pastime. The apathy, the entire lack of ap
preciation of the importarce ot racing to the
general prosperity of ilie league, was painfully
in evidence.
Even the very head of the league, Isaac C.
Potter, a year ago took an open stand in oppo
sition to racing, and, although he receded
somewhat as a matter of political policy from
that position during his candidacy for presi
dent this year, still it will be noted that every
amendment to the constitution proposed with
the Idea of broadening and extending racing
privileges was defeated by the following of
ilie present administration. To any wheelman
of Caiiiornia this will indicate sufficiently an
import -i nt reason for tbe bringing into exist
ence of another organization.
But this is not all. Upon tha head of the
National organization depends Its successiul
conduct as v National body. Ii the president
oi the league is a man who is tricky, who has
attained his position on broken pledget, by
deceit and misrepresentation, 1 cannot bring
myself to leel that he will manage league
affairs for th- best interests ol the wheelmen
and I will not serve in any capacity under the
leadership o: such a m*n.
That Mr. Potter is such a man I have abso
lute proof. His treachery to California on
the floor of the National assembly, his Judas
kiss to President Elliott prior 10 trie election,
the disreputable Massachusetts trade, wtiicn
timely use, and it seems a necessary and
humane duty, therefore, to brine such
facts to the attention of all invalids, that
they may be benefited thereby.
He considers it not only his professional
duty, but his religious dutyâ a fluty which
he owes to suffering humanity â to donate
his infallible cure to alt afflicted.
Chemistry and science are daHy aston-
ishing tiie world with new wonders. It is
no longer safe to say thai anything may
not be achieved. The researches and ex-
periments of this great chemist, patiently
carried on for years, have culminated in
results as beneficial to humanity ns can
be claimed for any modern genius or
philosopher.

resulted in the refusal of Gideon to again ac
cept, the chairmanship of the racing board,
are lamiliar instances <>f treachery to the
wheelmen of Amend indulged In by the New
York delegation frora Potter up.
It has seemed plain to me, therefore, that
the league division here has reached the limit
of its usefulness. It only remains to be shown
that a cycling organization can be formed in
California that could do more for the wheel
men of the State than is done by the league.
I believe that it is perfectly feasible for the
California Associated Cycling Clubs to so ex
tend its scope as to assume all tne functions
of the Northern California division. The As
sociated Clubs have met with nnilorm success
in everything they have undertaken. They
have established amicable relations between
the several clubs of the State, and to-day cou
siitute the authorized body for the expression
of the opinion of the organized wheelmen
upon any subject. They have taken road
ing into their charge, and have done for that
branch of cycling all ibat tne league has done
for racing on the track.
What, then, is to prevent the California As
sociated Cycling Ciubs from absorbing and
taking advantage of tbe energy that in the
past has made this division of the league what
it is?
Potentially, California is one of the greatest
cvclingStat.es of the Union. In no city of the
.Eastern States is there greater enthusiasm,
greater energj in ail branches of wheeling
work than right here in California. And it is
safe to say that in no Stat^ is tho number of
riders greater in proporiion to the popula
tion. Our road-racing events are unexcelled.
We havo established more records on the
track during the past two seasons than any
other State. The goodfcllowsnip and fraternal
!>â >â¢! in-: that exists among wheelmen here has
been the frequent subject of comment from
visitors from without our borders. During
the past year we have initiated and encour
aged an agitation lor the improvement of
highways that culmiuated in the passage by
the present Legislature ot a bill appropriating
more than $000,000 lor the purpose. We have
secured the passage of ttie bicycle baggage
bill. Surely it is beyond question that we
have in this s:aie material iur the formation
of a local organization that can do more for
California than is possible ior any hampered
branch ot a National body.
i am aware that with some of the members
of the California Associated Cycling Clubs it
might be a matter of hesitancy toengraitupon
that body the numerous functions now per
formed by the Lengue Division. But in this
connection it must be borne in mind that no
radical changes in its organic law would be
necessitated, and to its present corps of effi
cient workers could bo added those who have
heretofore devoted themselves to the advance
ment of the league.
To establish a system of hotels and local
consuls, to afford legal protection to its mem
bers, to facilitate touring, to l urnish informa
tion concerning roads and stopping places, to
continue the agitation for the betterment oi
highways, to secure needed legislation from
our Legislatures and Boards oi Supervisorsâ
this is the work beiore us. All tnis has been
done by the L.-ague Division. But, let me ask
you, has it not beeu done by the efforts of the
wneelmen of our State? What aid has beeu
afforded by the National organization ? In
dued, tbe matter seems simple, me course is
plain. It has become tbe duty of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling clubs to step into the
brc:ic:i and save cycling lor us here.
I have gone thus fully into my reasons for
this resignation that tliere may be no misun
derstanding as to what has induced it. lam
well aware of the tendency on the part of peo
ple to nscribe an action oi tuis Kind to per
sonal pique or disappointment. Bull believe
a readiug of this letter will convince any one
that no such element has entered into the
present result. I have but to recall the man
ner in which we humiliated not ourse.ves, but
tne wheelmen of California before those who
had succeeded by the means ludicuted in get
ting into control when we went to New York
after the National Assembly had adjourned
and strove in every way to effect some com
promise with Potter, aud were even denied a
hearing.
I cannot close this communication without
taking occasion to thank Frank W. Fuller for
his abie and energetic assistance to us in the
National Assembly. Mr. Fuller left his busi
ness at New York, went to Albany and re
mained there throughout the session, all at
his own expense, and did splendid work for
us. He certainly deserves the gratitude of
every California wheelman.
I also wish to thank tbe members of our
local board of officers, and of the committees,
both of tbe present year and the past, ior the
earnest work they have done aud the results
they have accomplished, aud to express tne
hope that rhev will devote to the organization
which will take the place of the league
division here the same energy and enthusi
asm. Yours very respectfully,
Frank H. Kerrigan.
Vice-Consul Henry H. Wynne will take
Judge Kerrigan's place as consul as long
as toe division exists, which is not ex
pected to be a great while, inasmuch as a
majority of the members will withdraw
when the time expires.
It is expected that not more than 500
out of the ifJOO members now in the divis
ion will remain at the end of ninety days.
Others will withdraw as iheir member
ships run out, and within six months
there will not be enough member- left to
support the division.
A meeting of the board of governors of
the Californian Associated Cycling Clubs

A MERRY WAR
AMONG DOG MEN.
The St. Bernard Club Dis
qualified From Bench
Shows.
It Refused to Recognize the
New San Francisco Kennel
Club.
Allegations of Underhanded Methods
to G) B fore the N tional
Body.
Strife is rampant in dopdom.
Tbe blue-blood canines themselves are
not snarling nor irrowiing, but it happens
to be their masters who have clinched and
who are cudgeling eacn other unmerci
fully.
This war has been smoldering for some
tinio past, but it did not reach the crisis
until yesterday, when a telegram was re
ceived from Secretary A. P. Vred'en burgh
of the American Kennel Club announcing
that the St. Bernard Olub of this City had
been formally suspended from affiliation
with the National body, and hail also been
disqualified for an indefinite period from
participating in auy bench shows given
under the sanction of the American Ken
nel Club.
This was a stunner for the St. Bernard
ureeders, but not altogether unexpected,
for to this particular dog story there hangs
a tale.
It dates back several months, to a time
when the old Pacific Kennel Club of this
City â the only one then existing here â
decided, afier having passed through a
veritable maelstrom of trouble and tribu
lation, to go out of existence. It had
given many successful bench shows, and
financially was standing on both feet, but
the fact that dog snows are like baby
shows, inasmuch as only the blue-ribbon
winners will admit that the judges are
wise and the dub honest, left many ene
mies in the organization's wake, and the
members finally determined to disband in
disgust. They were loyal to the dog, how
ever, and rather than see 1897 pass over
without a bench show ma .c a proposition
to the Olympic Gun Club. This was to
the effect that the latier undertake to give
this year's exhibition.
Shouid the Olympics assent the Pacifies
would agree to turn over all of their costly
paraphernalia to their successor,lend every
assistance within their power and in ad
dition surrender the residue in their treas
ury â amounting to something over $300.
The Olympic men thought the matter
over carefully and finally concluded that
they could see their way clear, with all of
the promised assistance and the encourag
ment accorded them, to undertake the
task, and so informed the retiring Pucirics.
There were certain formalities that had to
be observed before the gun men could
launch forth into t c dog show business,
the most important of these being the re
quireinent that the organization should
join the American Kennel Club and se
cure its sanction for tiiis year s show.
The way -seemed open for this, and to
help matters along the Pacific Club for
warded an open-hearted indorsement of
the project and of tne Oiyoapic Gun Club
to New York.
Then a snag was encountered.
It appears that there is here what is
known as the Pacific Advisory Board of
the American Kennel Club, and it also
happens th.it this board is made up
principally of the Fame men who, the Pa
cific members claim, nagged them into
abolishing their club and getting out of
dogdoui. However this may be, the ad
visory board, bended by H. T. Payne, Dr.
d'Eveiyn and others, took it upon itself to
pass resolutions condemning the Olympic
Gun Club's ambition, proclaiming that
the latter organization was here looked
upon "with distrust and disrepute," and
declaring that it should not be permitted
to engage in a bench show. Here are the
resolutions complete:
Whereas, The death of the Pacific Kennel
Club opens the door lor me organization of a
iirst-ciass dog show ns--octation, composed ol a
better element than has heretofore beeu con
nected v.m the mtwugjmeut of kennel exhi
bitions in San Francisco; and whereas, the
Olyinp.c Gun Club, an organization to wnich
dog shows will be only a secondary considera
tion, Is a seceding faction from the lareest
and most popular athletic and social club in
the State, and is held by said athletic cluh in
disrepute and distrust; and whereas, .should
the said Olympic Gun Club become a member
of the American Kennel Club Its dog shows
would be under the control ot' the same men
whose efforts have not been employed 10 bet
ter '.he welfare of kennel mutters â in fact, be
ing detrimental instead of beneficialâthere
fore be it
Resolved, That in the opinion of this board
it would be a stroke of bad policy on the part
of the American Kennel Club to grant a fran
chise to the said Olympic Gun Club, or to any
other organization whose v. ry object and pur
poses would necessitate the making of dog
shows r secondary und minor fpr.ture.
Resolved, Tim ihe American Kennel Club be
mid it is hereby requested by the Pacific Ad
visory Boardâ iv the fulfillment ol what it
deems to be its dutyâ to refuse admission to
the Olympic Gun Club, in order that a kennel
club pure and simple may be organized and ad
mitted to membership, and the holding of
annual dog shows placed in the hands of an
organization whose best efforts will be exerted
in the advancement of the kennel in teresti of
San Francisco and the whole coast.
Resolved, That the secretary of this board be
instructed to forward at once a copy of these
resolutions to the American Kennel Club.
Attest: H. T. Paynk,
Secretary Pacific Advisory Board.
These resolutions were at once forwarded
to the American Kennel Club, and only
through ihat medium became public. The
Olympic Gun Club, which, as is known by
a<l sporting ruen here, is composed of some
of San Francisco's most representative and
respected men, emanating from the most
dignified professions and callings grew
highly incensed whon the wording of the
resolutions reached it, and demanded a
hearing and a vindication at the bands of
the National body. This, the members
say, was denied them, and they accuse
Secretary Vredenburgh of being in collu
sion with Payne and d'Evelyn and of con
niving to heap tuis alleged injustice upon
them.
Following upon the heels of the appear
ance of the resolutions at the National
headquarters in New York came the for
mation here of the San Francisco Kennel
Club, and the Olympic men say its com
position was that of the antagonistic ad
visory board, and of the men who had
worried the Pacific Ulubout of existence.
To make a long story short, the new or
ganization's claims were presented to the
National body by Secretary Vreden burgh
in such a manner that it wad granted a
petition for a bench show, whereas the
Olympic Gun Club was not only ignored,
but in addition denied membership. And
this, as might be expected, Had anything
bat the effect of assuaging tne feelings of
the indignant Olympics and ex-Pacih'cs.
The St. Bernard Club, which is and al
ways has been one of the most important
and most desired exhibitors at the local
bench shows, was one of the first to take
umbrage at ti.e alleced underhanded
metnods by which the Olympics sufferi-d
indignity and by whicn the San Fran
cisco club came into existence, anu it
promptly announced that its members
would not exhibit a do? at the coming
sanctioned show. Realizing that this ac
tion would seriously handicap the pro
jected exhibition the Advisory Board-San
Francisco Club combination set about to
coerce tne St. Bernards into going into
the show, the first step being to notify
them that their suspension would be
recommended unless they acquiesced. But
the St. Bernards were stubborn ami de
clared they would not exhibit, suspension
or no suspension.
The advisory board's recommendation
then journt yea to New York, and yester
day's disnatch from Vredenburgh is the
sequel. This means that the St. Bernard
Club cannot appear now at any bench
show which receives its sanction from the
American Kennel Clvb â in other words,
tbnt it is an outlaw.
The war is going to be a merry one. The
Ft. Bernards, the Olympics and the ci-
Pacih'cs intend to carry it right into the
camp of the National body and declare
that before they are through thpy will
show up in an unenviable lieht Vreden
burgh, Payne, d'Evelyn and numerous
others.
GBOIZINGER BACKS DOWN.
Consent* to the Entry of Judgment In
t'avor of C. Wesley -Heed.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger has filed
a stipulation in Judge Seawell'it court, in
which he argue* that judgment may be
entered as prayed for by Attorney C.
Wesley Reed in uispstitioa for a review.
The litigation out of which this compli
cation arose has attracted considerable
public attention.
J. a. Reid, by his attorney C. Wesley
Reed, sued Pauline Se:ig for the recovery
of some furiiituro which she had obtained
on a lease for $143, and. according to Mr.
Reed's statement, judgment was given for
the full amount.
Subsequently it developed that Bier it
Regenaburger h;id lent money to Mrs.
fcelie on the furniture, and when Mr. Reed
lookeU up the record he alleges that the
figures had bÂ°en changed from $143 to $22.
Mr. Reed alleged that this c unsie was
made in the interest of Bier & Regens
burger. He made the following state
ment in his affidavit:
AffiaÂ»t further states that it is currently said
by tiiose liimiliar with the practices of the
Justices' Court that the said G. (J. Groezinger
is under heavy obligations to me said Bier &
Regensburger in a political way; that thu said
Bier &. Kegensburger have many cÂ«st-s to try
in said court, and that in every way possible
thu said Urnezinger Rids them in their litigii
tion; that affiant charges the said Groezinger
with changing the sa!d docket In order to favor
tne said lrieuds. Bier & Regensburger; that
the said Groezinger has mÂ«de many contradic
tory statements siu.ee making tne said change.
Justice Groezinger offered an explana
tion by saying that Mr. Reed had deceived
him when he presented the decreo for
signing. To this Mr. Keed replied by
snowing that the figures had been written
by Justice Groezinger and that he had
made several interlineations.
While the case was pending in Judsre
Seawell's court the matter was taken up
for consideration by the Graud Jury. It
is thought that Justice Groezinger's action
will nut a stop to further proceedings, as
Mr. Heed will obtain judgment for the
full amount demanded and Justice Groe
zinger will pay costs of court.
CHANGES IN THE POLICE.
Policeman Sbadrach Campbell
Promoted to Be Ser
geant.
Eight New Patrolmen Sworn In by
Chief Crow cv and the New
Station Occupied.
Policeman Shadrach Campbell has been
promoted to be Sergeant, and has been as
signed for duty in the Mission district.
The promotion was a genuine surprise
to Campbell, who is one of the most popu
lar and efficient men in the department.
When the men assembled at the Central
station Friday evening Captain Witman
asked Campbell to step forward. He read
an order from the Chief promoting Camp
bell to be sergeant, and warmly congratu
lated him, telling him that the promotion
was earned solely from merit, and that
nothing had given him greater pleasure
daring the fifteen years he had been con
nected with the department.
After the Captain had finished there
was a burst of applause from the men,
which continued for a m inn te or two, and
Campbell was so taken aback by liis un
expected good fortune' that lor the first
lime in his life his tongue failed him and
he could not utter a word.
The new sergeant joined the department
on January 10, 1887, and since then has
done splendid service, making many im
portant arrests, iiu was olten detailed
for detective duty, his coolness, pood
judgment, shrewdness and bravery always
making him invaluable for such work.
Several vacancies have occurred in the
department recently from various causes,
and yesterday Chief Crowley swore in
eight new men, as follows: Henry C.
Jones, native of California, clerk, 26 years
of age; Robert I. Graham, California, car
penter, 27; Cornelius Cregan, Ireland,
railroad uun, 30; assigned to Captain
Wittman's division. Charles Peterson,
California, boaiman, 29; William J. Smith,
Massachusetts, plumber, 32; John J. Till
man, Calilornia, special officer. 28; as
signed to Captain Spillane'* division.
Michael J. Griffin, Massachusetts, clerk,
33; Miles J. Filben, California, machinist,
27; assigned to Captain Gillen's division.
The new police station on O'Farrell
street, near Devisadero, was occupied for
the first time at noon yesterday, with
Sergeant Mooney in charge. The men in
the district, which includes from Steiner
street, between Waller and Broauway,
west to the beach, will in luture report on
and off there.

known to the world at large as was that of
â the recluse of Walden Pond to the con
â  lemptuous world about him.
For something over two years Thoreau
dwelt by Walden Pond and kept his
famous and fascinating record of the wild
life about him. but for more than thirteen
years John Muir dwelt, solitary, among
the fastnesses of the high Sierras, beside
the great glaciers that have been the study
of his lifetime. Away to thÂ« northwest,
in tbe mountains of Alaska, stands the
little hut whore he dwelt for some years
and made his observations of Muir
Glacier; and here and there, on Whitney,
Hood, Shasta and Lyell, are other cabins,
none of them more than the merest camps
for a night, where the hero of science
made his lonely awelling-p!ace.
"There is something uncontrollable in
every man that makes him do the thing
he supremely desires, even when his judg
ment disapproves," John Muir said once,
when asked wliy he elected to spend some
of the best years of his life in places where
not even the Indians wandering through
the mountains dared venture.
Certainly this something uncontrollable
ruled bis destiny and compelled him to
the pursuit of his supreme desire. He
wanted to know something about the mar
velous ice formations of the Pacific Coast
mountain ranges. So he studied them
until Agassiz said of him that "he prob
ably knew more about glaciers than auy
other man in the world."
I spent a charming day with Mr. Mnir
and his family on the Martinez ranch not
long ago. Tue famous mountaineer does
not look the hardy, daring, even reckless
explorer that he Has been. He is of
medium height, slender, even delicate, in
appearance, with laughing blue eyes and
curling hair, now thickly sprinkled with |
pray. He is a moaei farmer, and the i
casual observer might spend a day with |
him and see only the leisurely, wealthy
country gentleman of scholarly taste,
with a predilection for scientific study, a
little inclined to indolence, perhaps â an
inclination which the genial Californian
climate fosters In her children. But there
is scarcely a perilous, albeit inaccessible,
peak of the high Sierras that Mr. Muir
has not scaled, carrying no blankets,
sleeping in snowy rifts and icy caves, liv
ing upon dry bread and the chilly waters
of tbe melting glaciers month after

donations of pubhc- spirited citizens and
in the increasing interest taken by the
people at Jarge in tbe affairs of the institu
tion, substantial ev.dence of the spread to
this coast of the spirit which has led to
the foundation in the East of such noble
monuments of high education as the uni
versities of Johns Hopkins and Chicago.
It is evident that California does not pro
pose to lag behind tbe older States in the
development of modern university life,
and that neither money nor endeavor will
be lacking to secure on the Pacific Coast
the evolution of the high ideals which are
the test of a lofty civilization. Professor
Joseph Le Conte expressed a simple truth
I when he said that tbe best minds were as
one on the vital necessity of realizing at
Berkeley the true idea of a university, and
on the duty which devolves on its faculty
to prepare its graduates for leadership in
the world of thought and the world of
action.
Four years ago President David|Stajr Jor
dan, now of Stanford, delivered the oration
on Charter day at the University of .Berke
ley. In that address he struck the key
note of modern high education, in the
sentence: "The very essence of republi
canism is popular education." Not the
education of the past, which was barren
and old fogyish, and in tbe course of which
musty old men in libraries tried to make
young men as dry and dreary as them
selves ; nor the education of Europe, which
turned out gentlemen and clergymen
garbed in a patcbwork of superficial at
tainments; but the ideal education of to
day, which takes the common man and
trains him to be wise and gentle and
noble. This cannot be done by books or
lectures; it must be accomplished through
the noble influence of self-culture, in a
congenial atmosphere which makes for
right living, right thinking and right
acting.
In this State public opinion has al
ways been feeble, and consequently the
standard of patriotism has been low.
Scholars have been afraid to combat
fraud. We have inherited tbe weaknesses
and crimes of the motner country, and
have not acquired strength enough to
throw them off. It is the business of a
great university to grow a race of kings of
men, who shall be clear-sighted enoueb
to discern the truth, and brave enough
to express it at all costs. They must not
be of the breed of Mr. Facing-both-ways.
They must realize that it is their business
to solve public problems as they arise, |
every year or 90 for a week at a time, but j
always hurrying bacK as soon aa possible
to his beloved mountains and the glaciers
that claimed him for their own.
The Sierra range is about 500 miles long,
seventy miles wide and from 7000 to 15,
--000 feet high. Lke all tbe mountain
ranges of California, seen from the plains,
tliey look bare, brown and uninteresting,
giving no hint of the mighty forests, the
deep, mysterious canyons, the great lakes
and rivers hidden away among their vast
nesses. Yet all these are there by the
thousands, and to Mr. Muir the trails of
wolf and mountain sheep and all the
teeming wild life of the range are as
familiar as Front and East streets are to
San Francisco merchants. The great can
yons of the range, according to Mr. Muir,
have all, without exception, been cut by
glacial action, and away up among the
peaks glaciers are still at work grading
the mountains and making new passes
that may yet be highways of traffic along
which Macaulay's intelligent New Zea
lander may ride in a horseless carriage
when he visits California.
"I must get back to the mountains
soon," Mr. Muir said to me, on the day 1
! spent at the ranch. "It would be awful
to die down here on the level. I'm not
thinking of dying yet, but when I do leave
here it must be from the peaks." It re
minded me cf something he has some
where said in print, "These mountain
mansions are decent, delightful, even di
vine places to die in compared with the
doleful chambers of civilization."
"You must have Dad some narrow es
capes, Mr, Muir," I said, "in your years
of climbing icy peaks." He smiled. "I
was climbing Ritter once," he began,
"when, for the only time in my whole life,
Imy nerves failed me. I had been going
I on all fours for hours and I had no ax to
cut my way. I had breakfasted houis be
fore on bread and tea, and was faint and
exhausted. It was in the dead of winter.
1 should never have attempted that trip
before midsummer, but I was hungry to
get to tne top of the north spurs. Ritter
is some 13,000 feet high, and surrounded
by glaciers and canyons thousands of feet
deep. I was up probably 12,000 feet,
when suddenly foot arid hand hold failed
me. There was no going back ; there w.;s
no going forward. I lay sprawled there
on the ice absolutely unable to move. I
never expected to get out of that place. I
simply hung there and waited until the
second should come for me to drop. I
suppose it was a sheer slide of 5000 feet
once one started."
I waited breathless for the continua
tion of the narrative, but apparently the
bardv mountaineer thought he had told
enough, for after a long silence he sud
and to solve them in the right way; else
they will not stay solved. There is a right
and a wrong in all questions; it is the
business of higher education to find the
right and to stick to it. Some one once
said that 15 per cent of the acts in our
statute-book were rank violations of the
laws of social and economic science; ii de
volves upon our universities so to edu
cate those who lead the people that such
errors shall not be repeated.
Their past p.pathy is largely responsible
for the alleged failure of republican insti
tutions. What does it benefit a man to
understand the Greek digamma and the
rules of conic sections if the Legislature
he helps to elect is tbe servant of arrogant
monopolists, ignorant demagogues and
reckless agitators; if the San Francisco
delegation represents not the citizens, but
simple ignorance and greed; if questions
of public policy are settled not by the rule
of right or wrong, but by considerations
of party ascendency, and personal ambi
tion ?
The president of one of the youngest
and most progressive of our universities
lately said that the honest citizen asked
nothing of le r islation except that it keep
out of his way. He wants no guardian
ship nor coddling. He can pay as he
goes. He wants no free lunches nor any
thing else for nothing. He scorns to be
one of a nation of deadheads. Those are
the principles which the university of the
future will impress on its graduates.
Throughout all time the university has
shaped the civilization of its period and
its country. Oxford and Paris engendered
the spirit of an age in which culture was
the monopoly of the nobility and the
church. Against Spanish oppression the
Dutch raised the impregnable barrier of
the University of Leyden. So in this
country Coit Tyler of Cornell lately ob
served, with perfect truth, that the men
of the early American collegesâ Harvard,
Yale, Princeton, Columbia aad William
and Maryâ made succbbs in the Revolu
tionary War possible. In our aay the
enemies with which society has to contend
are not robber barons, nor fanatical reli
gionists, nor foreign tyrants, but fallacies
in political economy and social science;
and once more it devolves upon the univer
sities to point out the path of truth and
honor; to teach the people the duty of tol
erance toward thosa whose skins are not
of the same color as theirs, toward others
whose opinions differ from those they
hold, and to make the people feel the
shame of embracing falsehood and fraud
because they promise place and profit.
Of course, the fulfillment of so noble a
task an this depends upon the quality of
the minds which are the leaders of

thought in the universities. A university
lives through its professors. Of none of
them should it be possible to say that he
has anything mean or cheap or paltry
about him. His mind should be a crystal
globule and his heart should be steel.
He should be a natural-born leader of
men, like Azassiz, Asa Gray or Andrew
Dickson White. The ideal professor was
Louis Agassiz, the uavant who, when bL-t
3on, Alexander, informed him that he
proposed to marry, smilingly observed
that he hoped the event would not inter
rupt his studies.
The professor of the past was once de
scribed as a pump, who, when his piston
was set going, pumped second-hand in
formation out of a reservoir by his side,
and poured it into little pitchers which
held their little mouths open for its recep
tion. This was the teacher who believed
that the common school should stick to
the three R's and the university to tbe
thvee studies whicb complete a liberal
education â Greek, Latin and mathematics.
Contrast this worthy's scheme of educa
tion with the tripos proposed by the ven
erable Joe Le Conte, leading the modern
student through mathematics and its
branches, then through art, language,
history and philosophy to the crowning
science of sociology. Professor Le Conte
does not let go his pupil's hand till he
has landed him on ttie serene heights
where Herbert Spencer reigns; baton the
way he does not disdain a little flirtation
now and then with the studies wbich the
old university professor called the "side
fixin's" of a liberal education.
Higher education is in its infancy; able
minds are groping for substitutes for the
moribund form of the old systems. The
four-year curriculum is a back number.
At Chicago they are dispensing with fresh
men and sophs, juniors and seniors, and
the example will probably be contagious.
As to degrees and diplomas, when a man
writes B.A. or M. A. after his name every
one knows that he is an Englishman, and
a very young Englishman at that. The
"double first" and the "senior wrangler"
and "the prize-medalist" and the "num
ber one" and "number two" are passing
into history. Men wore such handles to
their names when they felt it necessary to
give the world public notice that they
were not what they seemed, but were
really smart fellows and fine scholars.
The American graduate of the future will
not require to file a certificate of his merit.
It will show for itself.
Now acd then a man is met who has
succeeded in life without having enjoyed
the advantage of a university education,
and who disparages such a preparation for
battle with the world. That such person!

are rare is demonstrated by the increased
and ever increasing number of young men
and young women who seek admission to
Berkeley. In fact, it needs no argument
to prove that a lew years spent at
a university are not only beneficial
but are indispensable for those who
do not mean to be hewers of wood
and drawers of water. Every community
is ruled by a few men ; the brightest, the
bravest, the most cultured, the most hon
orable, the most universally respected.
Where shall we find such men except in
the ranks of university graduates? It is
only at a university that young minds in
the receptive stage can be brought into
contact with the ablest intellects of the
past and of the present, and can obtain by
attrition with each other the high grain
and polish which command the obedience
though they may arouse the envy of the
mob. It is only at a university that young
men find their level, and, an the boys say,
get the nonsense knocked out of them. It
is only in such institutions that whatever
is noblest in a young man is brought out,
and that he is forced by competition to do
nis level best.
Graduates of the saloon and the corner
grocery sneer at college professors and
college students, taking comfort out of an
alleged saying of Horace Greeley, that be
would rather have the opinion of an illit
erate Kentucky farmer on a question of
politics than tbit of a college pro
fessor in Western New York. Mr. Greeley,
however, stocked bis Tribune not with il
literate farmers, but with university grad
uates, and his. own English was pure and
undefiled. Every man who has read his
tory or observed life will testify that
the opinion of the majority of men is
generally wrong. The voice of the people
is not the voice of God ; quite the contrary.
It is the masses who embrace popular de
lusions and go crazy over 16 to 1, or other
vagaries. It is the time-serving dema
gogue who aids and abets them in their
folly from base and corrupt motives ;
the stalwart right for the truth, which so
often saves nations from the consequences
of an ignoble policy, is fought by the few,
who probably acquired their Knowledge
at a university.
But, say the masses, we can't ail send
our sons and daughters to Berkeley. Of
course not. The narrow precincts of that
alma mater would be inconveniently
crowded if you could. And though there
are very few young men and young
women who would not be benefited by a
few months' or years' study at the uni
versity, there are undoubtedly, as the old
saying ran, some 50-cent boys udou whom
a $2000 education would be wasted. But
the father who assumes that his boy is a
50-cent boy before his mind has fully
opened takes an awful responsibility.
Some of the ablest men the world has
known were said to be marrels of
stupidity at school. No one had then
come along with the key which opened
the lock of their soul. Was it Brutus who

BERKELEY'S PHILOSOPHICAL UNION
SWSLHE prominence to which the Philo-
B Â°Dhical Union of the University of
jlfo California has attained is attested
by the fact that Professors Royce and
Watson and Dr. Harris could be secured
to address it. Indeed, Dr. Harris says
that it is a unique organization, compris
ing a larger number of intelligent students
of philosophy, who are able to enter into
subtle and profound discussions touching
important questions in their science, than
any other philosophical club in the world.
It has had from the time of its organ
> ization up to the present some 370 mem
bers on its roll, and of these several have
advanced to positions of importance in
the universities of our country. Of its
charter members Dr. C. M. BaKewell, ! 89,
is instructor of Greek philosophy in Har
vard University; Dr. G. M. Stratton, '88,
having studied with distinguished success
under Professor Wundt, and having ob
tained his Ph.D. snmraa cum laude from
the University of Leipsic, now occupies a
position in the department of philosophy
in the University of California, and Dr. S.
E. Mezes, '84, and for four years a gradu
ate student in the same department, is
now the head of the school of philosophy
in the University of Texas.
On account of the reputation of the
union, it will be of interest to the public
to know something of its history. In
1889 it occurred to Professor Howison,
who had then been teaching in the Uni
versity of California for five years, that it
would be pleasant to have a reunion oi
students who, during those years, had
worited in his department. It would be a
means of bringing them together socially
and of reviving among the graduates from
the department their interest in philoso
phy. Accordingly he invited them to
meet the professors of the university
with their families, and other persons of
distinction, at a supper to be given in
North Hall during commencement week.
There were about 200 guests in all, 150 of
whom were students. Addresses were de
livered by friends of the cause and short
papers were read by students.
So great was the interest arising out of
that reunion that on that day fifty of the
students, graduates and undergraduates
organized themselves into the "Philosoph
ical Union of the University of Califor
nia," determining to perpetuate the ben
etit received by this coming together.
They elected Professor Howison president
and adopted a constitution, the preamble
of which reads as follows:
"We, the undersigned graduates and
other members of the department of phil
osophy in the University of California,
convinced of the supreme interest and im
port of philosophical studies for human
Hanging dream-like and eyrie,
Under the morning star,
do not make a man garrulous; but on
that long spring afternoon he sat and
spun stories that were like tales out of
dreamland. He told of climbing for
weeks along the course of a glacier â not
ing its movement, studying its action â
carrying on his back a sack of bread, in
his pocket some matches and a packet of
tea. These were his stores. A little
melted snow or ice boiled in a tin cup
made his tea, and on this fare he did such
work, endured such hardships as fell to
the lot ot few men. "Bread and books
are ail a man needs," he said, as he deftly
severed the ]Qints of a plump, brown
turkey at table. "Have some more of the
dressing?" and he fell to telling of a
Christmas morning he spent on the top of
a Sierra ridge, where half a hundred birds
nocked about him to share his holiday
meal of dry bread and water. "I never
carried a gun," he said, "and 1 suppose
they would not have known one, anyway,
but they were tame as bouse doves. I
could gather an audience any morning by
whistling. The birds would fly round and
round my head, poising ou their out
stretched wings, and drink in every note."
I asked him if it was really true, a state
ment of his I had somewhere seen, to the
effect that he had found all wild creatures
seeming to possess a curious dislike for
the air of "Old Hundred." "True as
preaching," he cried. "I've tried it hun
dreds of times. I remember once a Doug
lass squirrel came bothering about camp,
and I couldn't frighten him off. Money
couldn't have hired me to kill the little
chap, but he would raid my bread-pack
before ray very eyes and sit and chatter
nonsense at me right over my head. He
liked to hear me whistle, and would lis
ten, keeping time witn hid little red bead,
as long as I had breath to make a sound.
At last I remembered former experiences
with birds and small creatures, and i be
gan to whistle 'Old Hundred.' Upon
my word, I hadn't reached the second line
before that feUow's heels twinkled in the
air, and be was gone like a flash," and the
glacial student chuckled over tbe memory.
Mr. Muir's thirteen years of close ob
servation of the glacial phenomena
have yielded him a vast amount of
knowledge regarding the formation of
the many lakes and rivers held within the
Sierra's fastnesses. His theories regard
ing these are original and interesting.
According to him every lake in the Sierras
is a glacier lake. They have been formed by
tbe slowly melting glaciers. They have dis
appeared, from time to time, as the great
ice-current has receded. Some have met
with accidental death, so to spealr, be
neath avalanches, and the basins of others
life in all its aspects, individual or social,
private or public, ana desiring, therefore,
to promote them among ourselves and
among others, especially in the communi
ties on the Pacific Coast, hereby unite in
an organization, pledging ourselves to ad
vance this object by every right means
in our power and adopting the following
constitution."
This constitution states the object of
the union Jo be: "The improvement of
the members in the knowledge of phil
osophy; the increase of its control over
their aims and conduct; the formation of
a definite bond among them, and the
strengthening of their sympathy, par
ticularly in regard to their common pur
suit of philosophy; the awakening of in
terest in philosophy, and th 3 dissemina
tion of it, among all persons on whom
they can exert an influence; and, in par
ticular, the maintenance, at the seat of
the university, of a central association for
philosophical study and discussion."
The society was to meet once a month
and to carry on systematic work in philos
ophy. The first year was spent in the
study of Plato's "Apoiogy," "Crito."
"Enthyphro" and "Phaedo"; two papers
were read each evening, and the discus
sions were finally summed up by Pro
fessor Howison. The next subject studied
was the "Theory of Knowledge," to which
the topics of the preceding year naturally
led. Two years were spent on this funda
mental branch of philosophical study, and
the whole history of philosophy was
traversed in so far as it bears on the ques
tion whether there is knowledge that
transcends actual experience or whether
all knowledge is merely the result of ex
perience. The work of the year was
effectually re-enforced by a short series of
lectures by W. R. Alger of Boston, ending
with one on "Immortality," which was a
most impressive address. The two fol
lowing years (1892-94) were spent in study
ing John Fiske'a "Destiny of Man" and
"Idea of God." Mr. Fiske himself was
consulted, and wrote letters expressing
his interest in the discussion.
By this time it had become apparent
that for a really successful prosecution of
the studies proposed it was needful that
the authors studied should come before
the union in person and express their
views more fully than could be done in
books; especially as the work of each
year developed important criticisms that
called for answer; and none could deal
with such criticisms so well as the au
thors criticized.
In 1894-95, Professor Royce's book, "The
Religious Aspect of Philosophy," was
studied, and Professor Royce himself
came out in August, 1805, in response to
that will gladden the eyes of explorers
centuries hence are now forming bsneath
mighty glaciers. His discussions on the
subject are full of fascinating suggestion.
Half the literary industry on Mr. Muir's
part that enabled Thoreau to give the
world lasting volumes of record concern
ing the wood-life about Walden Pond
would put us in possession of data of un
questioned value concerning the chain of
great mountains he has ranged so freely.
He showed me a small mountain â or, at
all events, a foothill â of manuscript
notes taken during his wanderings, from
which he promises one day to make a
book, but thus far one small volume of
desultory sketches is all the world has
profited from his unique explorations.
Newest Thing in
Money-Sweating
One of the most puzzled men in town is
a Montgomery-street restaurant-keeper
who recently tooK in a $20 gold piece
which fiJled all the ordinary requirements
of genuineness so far as a superficial test
could reveal the true facts. But a few
days ago a banker stepped into his place
and saw the $20 piece which the restaur
ant man had received only a short time
before. The banker had a queer look in
his eyes as he took the coin and rapped it
sharply with his knife and the restaurant
keeper had a stranger expression as he
saw his supposed $20 piece break into two
pieces.
"How is this?" he demanded.
The banker answered : "It is the same
old game. I had one of those pieces my
self, and since that I have tested gold
pieces of the $20 denomination very care
fully. If that had been genuine my test
would not have broken it."
Then the restaurant-keeper and the
banker carefully examined it together.
The outside of the gold piece waa all right,
seemingly, when the dissevered parts
were placed together. The milling seemed
to be up to the standard. The weight was
correct.
But the inside of the piece was half
filled with a composition which was not
the customary gold and alloy. Still
closer examination revealed that the gold
had been sawed through with exquisite
care and sEiil just inside of the milling.
Then the milling had been removed and
from the interior of the piece some of the
gold had been extracted and the baser
composition was made to take the place of
the more precious metal. Then, with
equal deftness and skill, the milling had
been replaced and soldered in some way
and the trick was done.
the union's invitation, and delivered a
series of lectures, notably the public ad
dress in the Harmon Gymnasium on
"Tbe Conception of God," calling fortn
replies from Professors Mezes, Le Conte
and Howison.
The next year. Professor Watson's
"Comte, Mill and Spencer" occupied the
union, and the author came out to am
plify his views and to reply to criticisms,
delivering five lectures, which culminated
in one on "The Greek and Christian Ideals
of Life. "
This year a book by Dr. W. T. Harris,
entitled "Hegel's Logic," is the object of
study, and the union has already had a
visit from him, during which he ad
dressed the society on the main topic of
the book, namely, "The Existence and
Nature of God."
This brief sketch of the work hitherto
done serves to give some idea of the scope
and character of the work projected. The
study of each year will result in a volume
to be published by the Macmillan Com
pany of New York and .London, which, it
is hoped, will be a contribution of perma
nent value to philosophy. One of the
volumes has already appeared, that by
Professor Watson, bearing tbe title,
"Christianity and Idealism." A part of
the aim in these discussions and publica
tions is to place properly before the world
the philosophical theories contributed to
the history of thought by Professor Howi
son, and to present them in the light
afforded by discussions with qualified rep
resentatives of other doctrines.
The members of the union are carefully
selected, although it is not expected that
each member will be an expert in
philosophy. Many persons generally
interested in the work and desirous of
helping to support a society with such
aims have attached themselves to it, so
that the members may b- divided into
two classes, those directly engaged in
philosophical study and those who,
although not themselves so engaged, wish
to help maintain an organization that
reflects credit and honor upon our State;
for the union is becoming known in
Europe, as well as throughout the East,
for the high character of the work done,
and is undoubtedly one of the most
effective agents in showing to the learned
world our State University in its true
iigiit.

Jones, the leader of the mutiny, in irons. The remainder of the crew started to
rush to their leader's aid, but were stopped by Vanderholt, who, with pistol in
hand, declared that he would kill the first man who interfered with the captain.
Caring the threatening pistol, Simon Toole, an Irish sailor, rushed Into the melee
and stabbed the captain. At the same time Vanderholt fired, but the bullet killed
Mate Tweed instead of Tooie, for whom it was intended. Then a sailor named
Maul killed Vanderholt with a belaying pin. All these horrible events transpired
before the horrified eyes of the daughter of the owner of the ship, who found her
self in agonizing helplessness with, her dead at sea la a vessel manned by half,
drunken, murderous madmen.
CHAPTER Vlâ Coxtinced.
In a few minutes the two bodies made their last plunge amid the
silence of the seamen. Some of whom, nevertheless, continued to smoke,
and the babbles which flashed to the surface were as lasting a memorial
of the dead twain's resting place as any gravestone which could have been
erected ashore fur dogs to smell to.
A light air from the southwest was coming over tbe burnished heave
in a delicate blue film, with feelers and crawlers of tbe draught tarnishing
the water in front of tbe breeze line in catspaws.
"Shall we stick this vessel's head north?" said the boatswain, and now
all hands came together in the eangway, close beside the bulwark rail,
whence the bodies had s ped ; there was to be a discussion over every sug
gestion.
"If we go north, where's it to carry us to?" said Gordon.
"Out of this beat, anyhow," answered the boatswain.
"We ought to make up uur minds," said the cook, with an uneasy look
at the sea. "We're just that sort of craft which is sure to excite notice.
'Hallo,' they sings out, 'a yacht all this way down here I' and they cornea
sheering alongside to hail and take a look."
"I'm not for going any further to the southard," said the boatswain
doggedly.
After a great deal of talk, during which the galley was repeatedly
visitea for pipe lights, they agreed to head tbe vessel north, if for no other
reason than that of temperature. So the helm was put hard up and the
little vessel wore. When the ropes bad been coiled down and the decks
cleared tbe boatswain called Gordon and Scott (who by this hour was re
lieved at the helm). These two men seemed the most respectable of the
clanâ perhaps the fittest for the mission tiie boatswain had now in bis
mind.
"Mates," said be, dropping his words between hard sacks at an inch
of sooty pipe, "there's a difficulty in the cabin that's got to be made an
end of. The Dutchman must be buried. Now the three of us had better
go below with sailcloth ana twine and stitch him up to the satisfaction of
bis daughter. I'd give this hand," said be, holding up a paw as Dig as a
boxing-glove, "if be hadn't been killed. He had meant to set his dinner
off our junk and pork to-day. It was the captain kept him in ignorance
of our condition."
"He'd have shot as many of us as there was balls is his pistol," said
Scott.
"You're right," said the boatswain, as though he found something to
rally him in that thought. "Let's get what's wanted, my lads, and make
an end."
The dead was alone when they entered the cabin. The ghastly hue of
the blow that bad killed him was fading. One hand lay upon his brow
and he seemed in thought.
"Quick, now," says the boatswain, "while the lady's out of sight."
They emptied his pockets, putting everything they found upon the
table, then quickly fell to swathing and stitching. In tne midst of this
work Gordon violently star tea and cried out, muttering "Gor! bow she
tooK me!" Miss Vanderholt stood near him. She was painfully
white, and her eyes were swollen almost to concealment. Yet any
one capable of interpreting human expression must have found a subtle
token of resolution in her features, shadowy marks of firmness, as
though the countenance was struggling to take its presentment irom the
spirit. This might be visible sooner to the eye of sympathy than to the
vision of the head.
"Are you going to bury him?" she exclaimed in a low, trembling
voice.
"Yes, Miss," said the boatswain, rearing himself and backing and
looking at her.
"Is there no one who can read a prayer from the service over him?"
said the girl.
The men looked at one another, shaking their beads, and then the
boatswain said : "Tell 'e what, lads, we'll stitch the poor gentleman up
ready and leave him a bit, while the lady says a prayer by bis side. It'll
do him more good than any prayer tnat's a-going to come from us,
whether we reads it or whether we imagines it"
Miss Vanderholt took a step to her father and kissed him, then, weep
ing silently, went to the foremost end of the cabin and stood waiting.
CHAPTER V.
CAPTAIN PARBY.
On the night of December 20, in the same year of the mutiny of the
Mowbray, a large full-rigged ship homeward bound was on the north ol
the equator stealing silently throueh the dusk. The hour was about 9:30.
The moon rode high and shone gloriously, and the edge of the plain ocean
came in two sweeps of ebony to the clasp cf splendor under the satellite.
The ship lifted a cloud of sail to the stars. The night wind wag
lightly breathing and every cloth was<sleep, stirless as alabaster moldings,
curving from each yardarm and clim -ing with the- whiteness of the moon
into three spires.
This ship was the Alfred, but noi the famous Thames East Tndiaman
of that name. She was about 1600 tins, with an abundant crew, a cap
tain and four mates. She was carryjag a valuable cargo and a number
of passengers from India to London *and once only had she halted, a
Simons Bay where sbe put a lieutenant of marines and fifteen men
ashore, and then proceeded, after filing up with fresh water. She was at
flush-deck ship, and when you stoocbat the wheel your eye ran along a
spacious length of deck, rounding w J th the exquisite art of the shipwright
into flaring bows, wbich sank into t*ae true clipper lines high above the
keen and coppered forefoot.
A number of ladies and gentleman sat and moved ''about the decks.
The awnines were furled and the mconsbine glistened upon these people
and sparkled in the jewelry of ladle's and silvered the whiskers of gentle*

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 28, 1897.
BY CLARK RUSSELL*
men. On the weather aide of the long quarterdeck walked the com
mander of the ship, Captain Harrington. A lady's hand was tacked
under bis arm. and he frequently looked to windward whiie he talked.
To leeward paced the mate, and a little distance forward, in the deep
shadow of the main rigging, stood a group of midshipmen.
Right aft upon the taffrail sat three gentlemen. One smoked a pipe,
the others cheroots. Captain Barrington permitted his guests, aa he,
with facetious politeness, callea his passengers, to smoke upon the
quarterdeck after five bells in the first watch. A considerable surface of
grating stretched betwixt these three gentlemen and the wheel. The
wheel was something forward of the grating, and the helmsman, there
lore, absorbed in the business of keeping the ship to her course, could
bear little more than the rumble of the tones of the gentlemen who con
versed on the taffrail.
"I say, Parry," said one of the gentlemen, who was indeed no less a
personage than the surgeon of the ship, casting his eyes up at the moon
and tasting his tobacco with slow enjoyment in the discharge of each
little cloud of it, "did it ever occur to you to consider that all the great
processes of this world â that all creation in shortâ is based on circles?"
"Why do you address yourself tome?" asked Captain Parry. "What
do I know about circles?"
"Behold yonder moon." continued the doctor pointing to the stem of
his pipe to the luminary beautiful with her greenish tinge so marvelously
clear that you might then realize if you never did before the miracle of her
self-poised flight through the domain of violet ether. "She is a circle,' ' said
the doctor. "So is the sun. So are the stars. The flight of our system
through space, if not a circle, is nearly soâ enough to justify my theory
that when the great haud launched creation the design was one of
circles."
"Oh, blow that," said one of the gentlemen. "Parry, hand us a che
root."
"The breeze seems scanting," said Captain Parry. "If this voyage
goes on lasting I shall b9 like the sailor who, when he was washed ashore
on a desert island in his shirt, complained that he certainly did feel the
want of a few necessaries."
"A man going home to get married ought not to be becalmed," said
the doctor.
"How do you like the idea of being married?" said the third gentle
men, who was one Lieutenant Piercy.
Captain Parry viewed the beautiful moon in silence.
"Until I got married myself," said the doctor, "I used to express mar
riage by what I consider an excellent image. A man marrying is like
unto a ship that grounds on a bar and beats over, where she lies, unable
to get out ; so other ships passing behold her riding, royal-yards across
and the bar thick under the bows."
Captain Parry continued to view the moon.
"A man for comfort," said Piercy, "should marry a roomy womanâ
Some Three Points on the Bow of the Ship Lay a Schooner, All Her Sails Showing.
you know what I mean, a woman who'll give him plenty of geographical
and intellectual room to move in. He's still contained in her, d'ye see,
still in sympathy, still sacramen tally one, yet he's got plenty of room,"
he drawled. "I remember some idiots who berthed a number of horses on
board ship, and allowed no room for the toss of their heads. It's room
that a chap wants in marriage."
"Isn't that something white ahead there?" said Parry, pointing into
the starry visionary distance right over the bow. The others seemed to
look.
"Something white should be a ghost," said Piercy. "I wonder if
ghosts walk the sea as they do the churchyards?'
"The most terrifying ghost that, to my mind, ever appeared," said the
doctor, "must have been the spirit of the Prince of Saxony, lie came in
complete steel, suddenly, upon his unhappy relative, who had idly pro*
nounced his name, and said: 'Karl, Karl, was wollst dv mitmich?' It
it the German or the idea of a ghost asking what you want with him that
makes this question awful?"
"The worst of all ghosts/ said Captain Parry, who had been strain
ing his eyes at the elusive gleam ahead, "are tha phantasies of the sick
â¢ye."
"Right," aaid the doctor.
"When I was ill some years ago, in India, I had been reading BoiÂ»
well's 'Life of Johnson,' and every night at a certain hour the figure of
Dr. Johnson would sit upon the mantelpiece and play the spinet, I knew
the old cock hadn't a note of music in his soul. His bead wagged like a
simmering cauliflower. I was in a mortal funk while he played, but was
too weak to throw anything at him. When the vision first appeared I
thought it might have been a large bottle. The mantelpiece was cleared,
and still old Sam came and played upon the spinet for five nights
running."
"The most inconvenient of all ghosts is the living ghost," said Lien,
tenant Piercy. "Ad Irish sergeant told me that before he lett Ireland he
seat an uncle five pounds. On returning, after fourteen years, he called
upon his nude and asked him for the money. 'Oon, surt,' said the man,
'haven't I spent the double of it in masses for yez?' "
"Talking of ghosts," said tbe doctor, "what do you say, gentlemen,
to this psychological touch? A young man, call him Brown, after yearn
of deliberation, seriously considers that he has been born into the wrong
family. He is wholly out of sympathy with his relations. He is superior
to them. He Joves music, tbe fine arts, literature and so on. His sisters
are commonplace; his father drops his b's. Tbe young man, feeling con
vinced that a serious mistake has happened, goes fortn to look out for his
own family. He finds them at last, a cultivated circle of people, and they
all seem to know that he belongs to them. Strangely enough, young
Brown meets in this family with one of tbe sons, a young fellow of his
own ageâ call him Jones. Jones laments to Brown that he is entirely out
of sympathy with his family. They are superior to him. He likes vulgar
sonss, the music-ball, the diverting company of hostlers and billiard
makers. He objects to young ladies. He prefers shopgirls. The point
is clear," said the doctor. "These young men were born into the wrong
families. Brown hinted to Jones that he would meet with the ri&ht par
ties at the Browns', and Jones was received by the Browns with tftat in.
stinctive perception of bis claims as a member of tbe family which cbsr
aclerized the meeting between Brown and the Joneses."
Here the chief officer came right aft and looked into the binnacle.
As tbe cheeks are sucked in, so the Bails hollowed to the sudden empti
ness of the atmosphere along with tbe slight floating roll of tbe whole
fabric. A low thunder fore and aft broke from the masts.
"I'm sick of that noise," exclaimed Lieutenant Piercy. "The cock
roacnes dance to it The kitchen offal that the cook threw overboard yes
terday delights in it and dwells alongside a loving listener. I say, Mr-
Mulready," he called to the mate, "when are you going to give us a whole
gale over the taffrail, something that shall come roaring down upon the
ship in a cloudless thunder of wind?"
"Ha, sir, when?" answered the mate, a dry man.
Captain Parry, with a slight yawn, stood up, stretched his arms<
stepped across the grating and sprang upon tbe deck, then stood looking
over the bulwark rail at tbe distant icy gleam on the bow.
"The heat seems to have baked the life out of Parry," said Lieutenant
Piercy, "or is it that his spirits sink as he approaches home, knowing what
lies before him?"
"A man should feel himself a poor creature," exclaimed the doctor,
"when be understands that a fit of despondency, a mood of unspeakable
depression, reaching even unto tears, may be caused not by tbe affec
tions â oh, no â but by a little piece of celery or half a pickled walnut."
"I am thirsty," said Piercy. "Gome below, doctor, and have a drink."
Four bells were struck. The ladies disappeared. Five bells, then
most of the gentlemen vanished. Six bells, and now the ship seemed
clothed in sleep and silence. At intervals faint catspaws stirred, none of
which was neglected by the mate of tbe watch, who, regardless of the
smothered curses of the seamen, hoarsely roared orders for tbe braces to
be manned. Thus stealthily the ship floated through that midnight sea
flooded with moonshine.
Then came the dawn, the resurrection of the day, trailing its ghastly
shroud across the face of tbe eastern sky. The watch of the mate came
round again at eieht bells (4 o'clock), and when the day broke it found
him on the deck standing at the rail and peering ahead.
"Bring me tbe glass," said be to a midshipman.
Some three points on tbe bow of tbe ship lay a schooner. SbÂ» had all
cloths showing, saving her little topgallant sail and royal. She was cer
tainly not under command, and yet did not seem derelict. Mr. Mulready
leveled tbe ship's glass. What was she? Scarcely a yacht, yet of yacht
like finish and delicacy. The faint breeze trembled in her moon-white
canvas. She lay head to wind, and tbe long pulse of the ocean swell, in
lifting and sinking her, exposed her sheatbing in flashes and submitted
to the eye of Mr. Mulready the handsomest sea-going model he bad ever
looked at.
Something wrong there, thought he, carefully covering her with bis
class and intently examining her for any signs of life, for smoke in the
caboose chimney, for a head peering in sickness over the bulwark rail.
Abont a mile and a half separated the two vessels, and it had taken the
Alfred nearly tbe nigbt long to measure the space betwixt tbe gleam over
the bows and the spot of waters whence it had first been sighted by Cap
tain Parry.
The chief mate could do nothing without tbe captain, but while the crew
were washing down the decks, often pausing for a breath or two in their
scrubbing to glance at the graceful, helpless, lonely fabric that was now
drawing abeam, Captain Barrington stepped through the companion
hatch. His sight immediately went to the achoonei.
"What vessel have we there?" he ezolaimed, and be picked up the
telescope that lay upon the skylight. "She is abandoned, sir," said he
to his chief mate.
"She looks too beautiful for ill lack," answered the mate. "The man
who molded her knew his art."
"What's she doing all this way down here?" said Captain Barrington,
talking with tbe telescope at his eye. "She's a gentleman's pleasure
boat Haii she been sacked and her crew and her pleasure party mur
dered ? Brace tbe foretopsail aback. I'll send a boat aboard."
The ship came to a stand with a lazy sigh of the light breeze in her
canvas, tbe yards of the fore creaking on parrel and trass as they came
round to the drag of hauling sailors. A boat was manned, lowered and
dispatched in charge of the third officer, an intelligent young gentleman
of the name of Blundell.
"Thoroughly overhaul her," the captain bad said. "If she is derelict
bring away the logbook and papers," and as tbe boat swept toward the
schooner tbe skipper turned to Mr. Mulready and ezolaimed :
"If she be abandoned I'll put a crew aboard, and we'll sail home to
gether. There is value in that little ship, sir. and she is too handsome a
craft to be allowed to wash about down bare."
Some of tbe male passengers arrived for their customary bath in tba
head. Do not believe the bathroom of the metal palace of this day com.
parable as a luzury to the old head pump. You stripped, yon sprang on
to a grating betwixt the beadooards, and an ordinary seaman went to
work. The gushing blue brine sank to your marrow. It gushed in cold
sweetness through and through you. You gazed down and saw the clear
blue profound out of which the sparkling coil that hissed over your
body was being drawn. It was the one delight of the tropics, the one joy
that happily sometimes checked the profanities in the passengers' mouths
when they came on deck and found the ship motionless.
One of the tirst to come on deck to taste tbe sweetness of tba head
pump was Captain Parry. The instant be rose through the hatch his eye
caught sight of the schooner. He stood awhile sttring; some one coming
up behind him forced him to mov â¢ out of the *a ten. He stepped out,
still with his eye glued to the schooner, and advancing that his vision
might clear the quarter-boat, be came again to a stand, staring.
He was a tall, well-built young man. about 2B years of age; close A
shaven and dark, and there was something Roman and heroic in the cast,*
of his countenance. He was airily clothed for the bain, ana watched the >^
schooner with a towel or two dangling in his graÂ«p.
By this time the boat bnd reached the side of the aDparently abanÂ«
doned vessel, and the third officer might, with the naked eye, easily have
been seen to spring aboard, foilowed by a seaman. He stood awhile, tak
ing a view of the decks, and then disappeared.
"Captain Barrington," exclaimed Captain Parry, wheeling suddenly
upon the skipper of the ship as he approached him, "is anything known
of that vessel ?"
"I have just sent a boat to board her," answered the captain.
"Will you allow me to use that glass?"
He took the telescope from the captain's hands, and resting the tubes
on the bulwark rail, gazed thirstily. There was something of astonish
ment indeed of amazement in his faco when he turned to Captain Bar
rington.
"I don't think J. can be mistaken," he exclaimed in a low voice, talk
ing to the captain but looking at the schooner.
"It is the same figurehead, exactly the same rig, the same size, so far
as tne eye can measure her at this distance. She has a deckbou3e for her
sailors and her paintwork is the same. It will be extraordinary "
be fetched his breath in a half gasp.
"Do you know that vessel, d'ye say, Captain Parry !" asked old Bar
rington, looking with curioeity and interest at the fine young fellow.
"I would swear that she is the Mowbray," answered Captain Parry,
picking up the glass afresh and continuing to talk. "She was purchased
by Mr. Vanderholt, who made a yacht of her, and when I was lasi in Eng
land I went on a short cruise in her. along witn Mr. Vanderholt and his
daughter, the lady to whomâ to whom â good God! the longer I look the
mora lam satisfied. No name is painted on her. You will nnd her name
in the boets. What under heaven brings her here, lying abandoned?
Yes, ob, yes! I'd pick her out if she were in a fleet of 500 sail."
"It may be as you say," exclaimed Captain Barrington. "It is a very
remarkable meeting. But we can be sure cl nothing until the third offi
cer returns."
A few passengers, attracted by this conversation, had drawn close.
You heard murmurs of excitement. A voyage at sea in the old days of
tacks and sheets was a tedious affair in spite of flirtation, cards, the sim
ple diversions of the dance on the quarterdeck, the heaving of the quoit,
the bets on the run. Even a floating bottle was a something to cause a
stir. It broke the dull continuity of the day. A sail was a godsend. And^_
here now, after many weeks of tedious ocean travel, here now and su!- W
aenly uprose, all at once, coming down abeam out of the darkness of thÂ» V
midnight, so to speak, an ocean mystery that would be fraught with an "
inexpressible significance if Captain Parry's conjecture proved accurate.
To this gentleman for whom the hetd pump had magically ceased to
have existence, the time of waiting and suspense was frantically long.
Lieutenant Piercy came and stood beside him.
"But supposing it is the Mowbray ?" said the young officer, "her pres
ence in this sea needn't concern your friends. The vessel may have been
sold. They may have been carrying her to some distant port. If it is
fever the dead will bÂ« found. If mutinyâ" Here Lieutenant Piercy
stopped, puzzled.
"She's certainly abandoned." said Piercy, "or something living would
have shown itself by this time."
â¢'Why the deuce doesn't that Blundell return?" muttered Parry in an
agony of impatience.
But â¢ yen as he* spoke the figure of the mate was observed to drop over
the schooner's side into the boat. The oars swept ihe brine into steam.
The boat hissed alongside and the third mate stepped on Doard. All the
people of the saloon or cabin had by this time heard the news; they knew
that an abandoned schooner, which was an ocean mystery, lay close by,
and they had made great haste to dress themselves, insomuch that a large
number of them were on deck. They elbowed round the third mate and
tbe commander and Captain Parry to hear the ship's officer's report.
"She is tbe Mowbray, of and irom London. I can't tind any papers.
Here's her logbook, sir. The last entry is in a female hand. The vessel
was apparently on a pleasure cruise."
"Let me look at teat book," said Captain Parry.
He turned tbe pages till be came to the last entry, then began to
read, now and then swaying himself, then making a step in recoil. All
saw by his face and his motions, by his strange gestures, by the wild
looks he would sometimes cast from tbe page to the schooner, that what
he read was carrying tbe bitterness of death to his heart. Meanwhile the
captain was questioning the third officer.
"There's nothing alive on board?"
"Nothine, sir; I searched every whe re."
"No dead bodies?'
"None, sir."
"Did you discover nothing to enable us to make a guess at what's ba
some of her peo le?"
"Everything is in its place, sir. The logbook was left conspicuously
open on the table of the cabin that had doubtless been occupied by the
captain."
â¢â¢Will you kindly accompany me below. Captain Barrington?" said
Captain Parry, who was so extremely agitated and distressed that he could
barely utter the words.
The passengers made room. Every face bore marks of pity and as
tonishment. They had heard that tbe last entry was in a female hand,
and they had also heard, in fact they could see, that yonder schooner was
abandoned. k
Captain Parry followed the commander of tbe ship down the com- m
panion steps into a bright, handsomely furnished salon; thence they f
passed into an after cabin, tbe door of which Captain Barrington shut. A
large, old-fasbioned stern-window provided a spacious view of the sea.
The light came off the water in a cloud of splendor and glowed and
throbbed upon the nautical brass instruments upon the table, and sparkled
in a glazed framed likeness of Mrs. Barrington.
"The entry here," exclaimed Captain Parry, trembling with excite
ment and tbe twenty contending passions within him, "is in the hand
writing of the young lady to whom I am â to whom I was â to whom 1 am
to be married on my arrival m England. She is Mas Violet Vanderholt.
You perceive," he said, pointing with a shaking forefinger, "that she
writes her name. T c story she tells is of a diabolical mutiny. It took
place on December 15. This entry is dated the 18th. To-day is the 20th.
The Mowbray has, therefore, been abandoned two days only.'perhaps not
a day, tor though this last entry is dated the 18th the crew need not neces
sarily have abandoned the schooner till yesterday, or even this morning."
"It is certain," said Captain Barrington, "that the hands, together
with tbe young lady, were on board the schooner on the 18th."
"Quite certain, sir. But here is her story. Pray read it aloud to me.
I did not fully master it."
Captain Parry, with a shaking hand, gave the logbook to his com
panion. It was of the usual form of logbook, with & good wide space for
-'remarks" on tbe right-hand side of each page. Captain Barrington, a
white-haired man of 55, w th scarlet cheeks, glanced over a few of the
earlier entries. He saw that the log had been kept down to December 14.
Afterward the entry was in a female handâ strong, sure, but somewhat
small.
"I have ascertained that none of the men can read. lam writing an
account of what has befallen us in this book, hoping, since the men talk
of leaving her and taking me with them, that this yacht may be met with
and this logbook discovered. I heartily pray any into whose bands this
book may fall that he will publish my narrative to tbe world, so that my
father's fate and my own may be known to Captain George Parry, H. E.
I. U.s service, to whom I am engaged to be married."
The commanuer looked at Parry with brows arched by astonishment
and sailorly concern. The officer brought his hands together in a con
vulsive gesture and turned his ayes with a look of despair upon the sea
framed in the window.
"My father was Mr. Montagu Vanderholt, a well-known Cape mer
chant. We resided at Terrace, Hyde Park, London. I. Violet Van
derholt, am his only daughter. He thought that a sea trip would do him
good. He asked me to accompany him. I was his only companion, and
we set sail from the Thames November 1 in this year. The master was
Captain Glew. He treated the crew harshly and excited their hate, though
he was cautious in his behavior when I was on deck, so that I never could
say he spoke to a man barbarously. But the dreadful tragedy of this
voyage waft occasioned by the bad food supplied to the sailors. This was
undoubtedly Captain Glew's fault. He had been commissioned to victual
the vessel and was responsible for her stores, and 1 fear he knew that what
he bought was not wholesome for men to eat, though the charges my poor
father was at should have given the men the very best quality of food. .
They complained to Glew, but not to my father. Captain Glew never I
hinted that the men were murmuring, and the mutiny sprang upon us _k
with dreadful suddenness. ' \
"The captain and the mate seized tbe boatswain, and a man stabbed
th&captain iv tbe side and mortally wounded him. My father dragged
me beiow. and rushed on deck and I suppose tried to cow the men by
presenting tne weapon. They did not heed him and he fared, and as 1
have since been told and must believe shot the mate, Mr. 1 weed, acci
dentally throuah the head. Mr. Vanderholt was killed by an iron bar
flung with murderous violence. They afterward feigned that this bar was
thrown with the intention of dashing the pistol from my father s hand.
This ts all that I have to relate. . ,â.. .
"I am writing this at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 18th. I cannot
imagine what the men intend. I asked the boatswain, who has treated
me with great civility throughout, to tell me what they meant to do. This
very morning 1 repeated the question. He answered he could not say.
The men were undecided. Some were for going away m the boat and
taking their cbances ot being picked up, and some for remaining in i the
vessel. I gathered from his manner that these were few. What are they
io do with the schooner if they stick to her? Tuey might, indeed, wreeff
her off some island, where they could represent themselves as shipwrecked
men. I know that they regard me as a witness against them, and that
my life is in great danger, and the mercHui God alone knows what is to
become of me. It is nearlyâ"
Here the entry ended.
The commander of the bhip looked at Captain Parry.
â¢'The hand of Providence is in this," said the scarlet-faced man, very
soberly and seriously. , Â»wÂ«
"They cannot be far off," exclaimed Captain Parry, stepping to the
stern window with an air of distraction and staring out at the sea.
"It it> a clock calm," said the commander, "and if anything wntcn
moves by canvas has received the crew we may presume that she lies as
helpless as we, not far distant." Â â. . . _
"But what excuse could they make," said Csptam Parry, to be trans
ferred from so stanch a little ship as the Mowbray?" n
"They might say that they were without a navigator.
"Wouidn't another vessel put a navigator on board so fine a craft and
send her home sooner than leave her to go to pieces down here? In that
case we should not have found her here." .
"There's nothing to be done at sea, sir. by arguing and speculating,
said Captain Barrington, still preserving his very serious manner, as /
though indeed he had found somethine to awe him in the c rcumstance M
of a girl writing, so to speak, in the heart of tbe Atlantic with particular V
reference to her lover, and that lover reading her words there. "It is as
likely as not," he continued, "that they have gone away in the long boat. .
It is clear from the narrative that tue majority were in lavor of that meas
ure. These are quiet waters, and tbe men have reason to hope that they ;

Six rather dilapidated-looking hens and
a razeed rooster were soon tenants of the |
chicken-house in the . back yard, on the
-gate of which Mr. Wiggins ostentatiously
fastened a huge padlock. A Milesian lady
who was moving further into town was
their former owner, and she gave them a
first-class character.

Faithfully and generously Mr. Wiggins
fed his new acquisitions and anxiously but
vainly he looked for the egg's which were
to reward him. ' His wife made no com
ments and serenely ordered her eggs of
the grocer as usual, but Mr. Wiggins waa
perplexed and unhappy. ;
Something was certainly wrong with
bis bens, and he studied over the matter
for several days. Saturday he came home

was in every one's way on the cars and
almost occasioned a personal encounter

explanations her husband bore it into the
seclusion of his exclusive domain. Soon
after he came in for the coal shovel and
hod, and was observed to be industriously
scraping and scratching around out in the
street before the house.
1. Later squawks of frantic ; excitement,
horrified surprise and wild dismay came
from the poultry-yard, and Mrs. Wiggins,
peering through the palings, beheld her
lord and master, very red in the face, hold

firmly by the lees while he rubbed her
vigorously with handfuls of. road dust,
-with which he bad filled the little tin tub.

Monday Mr. Wiggins brought home
thirteen eggs in a small basset.

rather than clinging to the trunks, as
most of these birds do. They are not so
industrious as their fellows, or, at any
rate, they do not seem to be so
out here, and the acorns and outs
we find buried in the roofs and even In
the walls of our houses and in the trunks
of trees are not put there by the flickers.
In fact these handsome birds are very
largely insectivorous. They search the
boughs of trees diligently for insects, and
even bore into decayed wood after their
prey, but their favorite game is ants.
They will linger by the hour about an
antuill picking off the D.isy toilers as they
come and go. They do not catch the in
sects In their bills, as the flycatchers do
their prey, bat run out their tongues,
wrapping them around the shining black
bodies, and so gather them in, as a cow
reaps the green grass.
The sparrows and flycatchers are al
ready busy with building operations and
the air is musical with pretty cries and
snatches of song.
In the midst of all this busyness I came
this morning upon the only idler in the
tnrongâ the white-crowned sparrow. Per
haps I ought not to call him idle. The
word applies but imperfectly to a bird of
his dignity and earnestness. This soli
tary bird is the only one of his kind that
I have seen thus far this season; yet he
does not seem a recluse, even though his
whilom companions, the white-throated
sparrows, have apparently departed. He
has rattier the air of electing to dwell
apart and contemplate life. There are a
good many bachelors among birds, though
possibly no voluntary ones, and he may
be one of these. He sat singing softly on
a low branch this morning and I caught a
glimpse of him as I paused at a dividing
of the way.
I love a place where a path divides.
When one is out for an early prowl there
is always an instant of delicious uncer
tainty as to which way to take. I usually
hesitate at this particular point, though I
know that a iittle further down the di
verging ways merge again at a tiny bridge.
Turning to the left I may creep through a
low-growing tangle of chaparral, willows
and sweetbrier, from which, at this
season, half a dozen buds are sure to
dart, and come out at a pretty woodsy
snuggery where a rustic seat invites to
rest and meditation ; or, I may Keep to the

a great bed of iris is growing, and where I

angry owner.
Mr. Wiggins, variously decorated with
dirt, feathers and broken eggs, sat down
on the back steps until he had recovered
his breath and the prospective mother of
his chickens her equanimity; then he
arose, grimly determined, and cut down
the small rope upon which Mrs. Wiggins
dried her dish towels.
"There's only five of 'em left," he said,
"but she's got to hatch eveiy one of 'era
or I'll know the reason why. The mem
bers of my family may, and often do, set
me at defiance, but when it comes to a
mere hen, and a young hen at that, I in
tend to be master!"
And he went into the chicken-yard and
closed the gate.
The next morning Mr. Wiggins rose
early and betook himself to the* chicken
house with a iiandful of corn, some soaked
bread, a spoonful of mush and a glasÃ
saucedish of water on a small tray.
"That pullet shall have every atten

to business. 1 cm afford to be kind now

Variety, and happy little lizards sunning
themselves on the rocks. The warm
weather has brought these pretty crea
tures out in great m umbers.
But this morning the sight of the white
crowned sparrow decided me. I turned
to the left and threw myself down upon
the soft grass, crushing out the musky fra
grance of the'fileree, and the wholesome,
pungent scent of the wormwood, as I did
so, and lay watching him and listening to
his faint rather sad song.
How almost inevitably we associate
human emotions with the songs of the
birds. The melodious carol of the gold
finch suggests nothing so much as the
sincerity and innocence of childhood. We
never catch in ita liquid trill the full, rich
note of tender maturity that sounds in the
voice of the meadow lark, or the triumph
ant, ringing joyousness that pours from
the throat of the black-headed grosbeuk
as be shouts defiance to bis rivals from
o me tall treetop. I saw and heard a wren
singing a few days ago, perched upon a
dead twig that swayed in the wind, and
the song was a veritable lyric of spring.
The little fellow sang all over, his tiny
throat swelling as though it would burst,
his wings lifting and trembling, his whole
body quivering witb the rapture of his
welcome to the sunlight and warmth and
the vivid, gold-touched green world that
surged all about him. It was such a
spontaneous, fervid performance, ao brim
ful of the essential quality of spring that
my nerves grew tense with sympathetic
excitement as I watched him.
Who can listen to the song of the thrush
without such a feeling of the beauty and
the depth of life as swells the throat and
fills the soul with yearning toward long
forgoiten good? It is a wonderful per
formance, fetarting with a low, half
hesitant measure, as though the singer
were trying whether life itself would bear
him up; ascending in clear certainty until
it pauses for an instant on a high, wild,
pure note that seems to touch heaven
itself; then down it sweeps with an out
pouring of transparent melody, to fall, a
rain of silvery notes, like a tiny cataract
into a little pool of silence.
It is a song that has its own measure of
serene joyousness, but blended with it is
a tragic note, a high prophetic strain,
that makes its appeal more directly to
man's soul than does any other sound in
sylvan nature. Is it because the thrush is
the bird of quiet and solitude, singing,
lonely, in deep canyons and woods? We
can hardly think of the creature as feeling
loneliness, and yet what quality in its
nature gi7es its song such penetrating
power and invests the bird itself with
such an air of serenity and visible, simple
dignity?
How can we know ? It is in hours of
loneliness when we hunger roost for hu
man companionship, the sympathy of our
kind, that the soul learns its own strength
and that other wisdon., that is in itself a
power to still, the knowledge of its own
weakness. Is the power of the hermit
thrush born as well of such knowledge ?
It is not really necessary that we should
know. The main thing is to listen to his
song simply, without reading into it too
much of "the painful riddle of the earth,"
which is af ; er all a man-made riddle.

writhed %o perseveringly that she had
smashed every precious egg left in her
charge. Moreover, she had managed to
entangle her obstinate head in such a
way that she hung over the edge of the
nest with her neck stretched to three
times its usual length and her wings and
legs drooping pathetically â stone dead.
"What you want," said old Jones, when
told of this misadventure, "is a trained
hen â one that's well broke to her busi
ness. It takes time to train 'em, fer
they're the stubbornest creturs living,
and an amatoor like you hasn't got the
patience, but I've got one thai I edicated
myself, and she'll get on brickbats if you
want she should, and I won't charge ye
but $3 fer her, as we ain't got no use for
her just now."
The "trained" hen was purchased at
once, and old Jones brought her over and
installed her on a new lot of four-bit
apiece eggs.
He gazed at the Wiggins hens critically,
for they were a sickly looking lot, in spite
of their owner's constant care.
"Them bens needs gravel," he said with
decision. "You've been feeding 'em high
on grain, but they needs gravel, and they
needs it bad!"
A load of gravel was dumped into the
yard the very next day, and Mr. Wiggins
eagerly watched for signs of improvement
in the health of his livestock, but they
throve even less than before. They spent
their time at first hanging about the gate,

staggering about forlornly or lying down
resignedly in secluded corners.

asked that astute party, after a deliberate
survey of the premises, and the evidently
dying hens, . and Mr. Wiggins pointed to
the gravel pile.
"Just what you told me to," he said,
"and 1 had it put in here so that they

"I'll give him to the unemployed to
help oat their Sunday dinner," decided
Mr. Wiggins, "and start fair with a
brand-new lot."
Bat previous to buying his new flock he
determined to dean up his chicken-house,
courses the fighting blood of an intrepid
race.
The colonel had not been in the City an
hour before he had been accosted by at
least a dozen mon with the salutation:
"Hello, Bruff, what are you doing
here?"
All of his friends call him "Bruff" be
cause he wants them to. He has won the
distinction of being called colonel, as it is
applied in the South, several times over,
but Bruffey is thoroughly democratic ana
wants to be called "Bruff," and that set-
ties it
Colonel Bruffey is one of the staff of the
Atlanta Constitution, the paper which
Henry W. Grady made famous.
A friend of Bruffey 's in San Francisco,
who worked with him in the South,
speaking of him said : ''Among all those
engaged in tne newspaper profession in
the Southern States to-day, there is none
who has had a more varied career than
| which was, he found, full of hen fleas and
lice. Kerosene, he was told, was death to
these vermin, and so on Sunday he took a
five-gallon keg of cheap oil, a large
sponge and a broom out into his hennery
and proceeded to swash about energeti
cally. He washed the roosts, the nests,
the walls and the floor, and gave his set
ting hen a liberal soaking. Then, being
tired with bis unwonted labors, he leaned
against the door-jamb and surveying the
scene of his exertions with satisfied eyes,
proceeded to light his pipe.
The next moment Mrs. Wiggins, gazing
placidly out of the back window, saw ber
husband hurled violently across the yard,
closely pursued by a sheet of red flame, a
blazim* bunch of feathers which had an
instant before been a live and expostu
lating hen, and the chicken-house
roof.
The engine-house was on the next cor
ner, so the Wiggins cottage was, by sharp
work, saved from destruction, but Mr.
Wiggins' whiskers were singed, his hands
scorched and his accommodations for
chickens utterly destroyed.
"The next time you want to turn nay
premises into an asylum for a lot of can
tankerous, idiotic bens, Susan," he said,
after the excitement was over and peace
restored, "you just give me timely warn
ing, and I'll start for Cuba, or Crete, or
some other safe and quiet spot, at once.
You may like the measly things, as you
were brought up with 'em, but I'll die in

Bruffey. When it came to gettinsr news
quick and fast from any accessible dis
tance, Bruffey was Grady's favorite lieu
tenant during those days when the fam
ous journalist was paralyzing the then
slow-going South by getting out a rapid
newspaper.
"He has plunged through the night on a
wild engine, rushing at a breakneck speed
over terrible Southern roads, where pas
sengers in ordinary trains would often
hold their breath in fear, to be the first
reporter at some scene of important news,
because Grady had sent bim.
"The atmosphere of a newspaper office
is like unto the breath to his nostrils to
Bruffey. He entered into a matrimonial
alliance with the profession a quarter of a
century ago, and never since that time has
he found a bride to wean him away from
the work he learned to love so well under
the tutelage of Henry Grady."
"When I, first met Mr. Grady," said
Colonel Bruffey to a Sunday Call reporter,
"be was doing space work on the Atlanta
Constitution, and I was one of its report
ers. Fortune nad not. favored him then
and his great abilities were yet unknown,
and in those days he knew no more about
.where his next meal was coming from
than many of the boys do now, but then
he was the same happy-hearted, liberal
minded, true, stanch man that the world
has declared him to have been since his
death.
"Certainly Mr. Grady," Colonel Bruf
fey continued, "was the first Southern
man to sound the tocsin of peace and to
seek to restore a feeling of good-fellow
ship. In all my newspaper life 1 have
never found a man possessed of more per
sonal magnetism than Henry Grady.
"Time and again I have heard him com
pliment bis men for work they had dona
in such a way that were it possible for
every word to be turned into gold, the
exchange would not have been made.
But Grady's gone now and all the old
boys miss him," and the colonel turned
his head to wipe away a silent tear.
In addition to having been the trie ml of
the illustrious Grady, Bruffey is a wcrra
personal friend of Joel Chandler Han is,
whose "Uncle Remus" stories have de
lighted children and charmed those of
older growth in all the civilized nations of
the earth, and of Frank L. Stanton, the
Southern poet, whose charming verses of
the South are quoted from San Frnncisco
to Boston and in England and European
countries.
They all work together, these three.
Mr. Harris is the chief editorial writer on
the Constitution, while Mr. Stanton, with
wonderful versatility, writes a br.ghr,
witty column of verse and piose daily for
the same paper. All three were warm
personal friends of Grady and this tie
brings them into close communion.

A Siamesed
Willow Tree
The many poets who have sung in vary
ing strains about the willow tree probably
never have imagined such a queer willow
tree as A. Carlisle of this City has induced
to grow upon land which he owns at
Berkeley. In fact, this singular willow
tree began existance as two willow trees,
tiny little saplings, as slender and pliable
as rushes that grow by the brookside.
They were planted by Mr. Carlisle, a space
of about three feet apart, and when they
had reached a height of some feet he bent
the tops of the saplings together and se
cured them so that they could not ba
separated without breaking them.
They were tbus formed into an arch, or
perhaps something more like the shape
of a lyre, the name of which has long been
associated in song with tuneful mention
of "a weeping willow tree." Mr. Carlisle
said nothing about his experiment to any
one for a time. His purpose was to see
whether he could make two trees assume
one identity aDd have two sets of roots
giving strength to one upright irunk. He
was, in a word, trying to repeat in tree
growth that singular freak in human life
which has gone into history as the Siam
ese twins, the account of whom has much
interested Mr. Carlisle.
After the trees had become accnstomei
to the unusual shape in which they were
growing they showed no tendency to pull
apart. Then by careful pruning they were
made to actually unite and, as might be
expected, from the union of the energy of
the two shoots of much vitality were de
veloped. The shoots which started out
horizontally were lopped off. One shoot
which crew vertically was permitted tÂ©
remain and into that w?nt all the sus
tenance which could be infiltrated, all tne
sustenance that two independent and vig
orous sets of distinct roots were able to
withdraw from the soil.
To stimulate the growth the roots wera
watered. Soon the arched trunks, which
bad become one trunk under skillful ma
nipulation, became as large around as a
man's arm. The upright trunk, with the
strength of double any of its rivals, also
rapidly thickened, and is now stout and
thick.
At the height of a few feet the upright
trunk was permitted to branch out freely.
The question now is whether this one tree
has one, two or three trunks. One set of
roots gave rise to the upright trunk. Two
sets of roots are keeping it green and
thrifty.

EVENTS OF THE WEEK IN SOCIETY

wjfjv season has made the past week, so

luncheons nor cozy dinners which have here
tofore been popular during Lent, and the
outcome for the immediate future is no less
discouraging.

"Browning clubs," "sewing circles" "athletic

&MINERS
â¢ IYfTA - Legislature in the history of the
lABS State ever "passed as many bills re-
A[lsil Jating to mining affairs as did the one
wbk :i has just adjourned. In fact, the legis
lation effected this year is the first of much
value and of a comprehensive nature which
has found its way into the Call ornia statutes.
It li a somewhat remarkable fact that the
chief mining State of the Union had before
this year passed fewer laws relating to mining,
for the encouragement and protection of the
great industry, than any other mining State.
The late Legislature did much ; for the
miners. This was a result of the organized
and united efforts of lending mining men, of
the new life which has been infused Into the
industry, and of a general disposition to en
courage and foster it. For.the first time in a
generation the hostility of the agriculturists
of the valley had disappeared, and there was
the gratifying spectacle of the men of the
mountains Â«nd of the -valleys' working har
moniously for their mutual benefit. The re
cent rapid development- of the mining re
sources of Southern California was another
source of the larger interest in mining affairs
and the larger support which mining meas
ures could command. The Legislature dis
played'unanimously a disposition to give the
miners what they asked, and it did so. This
was especially easy because the miners asked
no new appropriations of money and nothing
at the expense of any other Interest. The
most important legislation was a result of the
efforts oi the Miners' Association, which pre
sented a series of wetl-considered bills and
kept them, alive on the files. This is but
another evidence of the value of that strong
organization. - ,
The bill which attracted the most public
notice was the one, now a law, which reat>
proprinted aud made available for expendi
ture the $250,000 appropriated four years ago
for the restraint of debris in the mountain
tiibutaries oi the Sacramento .by means of
dams on condition that the United States ex
pend a like sum. The Government appropria
tion is ready for expenditure under the direc
tion of Government engineers. The State ap
propriation is lying in the treasury, having
already been raised by taxation. The law
provides for its expenditure, with proper safe
guards, by the State Debris Commissioner,
who shall agree with the Government engi
neers composing the California Debris Com
mission as to plans for restraining works and
approve the payment of one-half the cost of
.such works out of the State appropriation.
The expenditure of $500,000 will thus follow
at once.
The "dredger" law, appropriating $300,000
for dredging the Sacramento River, was not a
mining measure, but is so closely allied to the
.hydraulic, minine interests as to be indirectly
one. The bill was passed with the reciprocal
co-operation of the miners, and it is expected
th::t the dredging work and the attendant
study of the deposits of alluvium in the Sac
ramento and its tributaries will show that
they are largely due to the natural erosion
consequent on civilization and not wholly due
to hydraulic mining. This would naturally
â till further lessen the opposition to hydraulic
mining and further stimulate the redevelop
ment of this great branch of mining.
The act regulating the location of mining
claims is one of the most important of the new
mining laws. It is a strange fact that this is
the first law relating to mining locations
passed in this State. The Federal law of min
iiig locations on public lands is rather general
in its scope and comemplates supplementary
legislation by the States. All of the other
mining States have long ago maae the needed
supplementary enactments, and several States
have this year passed new laws on the subject,
most of them, it is asserted by some, better
than the new California measure. The mat-
ters upon which this supplementary legisla
tion is needed are the precise manner of mark
ine claims, posting notices, recording, assess
ment work and so onâ all of which are
important to the legality of mining claims,
and concerning which so much disputing,
confusion, litigation, claim-jumping and so on
arise.
The new law prescribes the manner of lo
cating claims upon the public domain, requir
ing at the point of discovery a substantial
monument, and thereon a preliminary notice
containing certain tilings and the recording
of snch notice with the County Recorder.
Within sixty days there shall be filed a certifi
cate of location containing, among other
things: "A description of the claim, defining
tbe exterior boundaries as they are marked
upon the ground, and such additional de
scription by reference to some natural ob
jects or permanep t monument as will identity
the claim." The requirements of the de
scription in the posted notice are similarly
general. The law is unsatisfactory and much
criticized because it lacks the Important fea
ture of particularly prescribing the manner of
marking claims. It prescribes, for instance,
but, one monument instead of several monu
ments or stakes, and there is left room for
errors, disputes and a continuation of the con
sequent confuiton, litigation and claim jnmp
ing.
The most valuable feature of the law is a re
quirement that the locator mus t do $50 worth
of work within sixty days after discovery.
Heretofore the locator has had from one to
two years to do the $100 worth of assessment
work required by the Federal statute. If the
locator fails to do this work within the sixty
days he cannot relocate the claim. Hereto
fore a man had been able to hold fifty claims
for nearly two years without doing any assess
ment work and then relocate them, thus
easily evading the Intent of the statute.
County recorders are made the sole custodians
of mining records. The law will be in effect
sixty days after its passage.
Another important act is one extending the
mechanics' lien law to mining properties, thus
giving adequate protection to the rights of the
working miner.
Protection is extended to owners of mining
property by an amendatory act making it
grand 1 arceny to steal ores and other valuable
things from mines and other mining proper
ties, the additional protection being given in
additional specifications of property. The old
law prohibiting mine-robbing did not cover
sufficient ground.
The destruction or alteration of mine mark-
Ings is made a felony.
The law requiring the secretary and super
intendent of a mining company to file weekly
statements is made applicable oniy to com
panies whose stock la listed on a public ex
change, and the statements are to be monthly.
The law as passed in the days of stock specu
lation had become needlessly burdensome
and gave opportunities for blackmail.
Other acts of less general interest relate to
tbe sale of corporate mining property, mining
locations on school sections and to locations
on unclaimed townslte properties.
Mining: Miscellany.
Two more promising young California min
ing engineers have found London employers
at flattering salaries. H. C. Hoover, a gradu
ate of the college of mines of theSUte Uni
vcrsUy, who has been connected with the
United Slates Geological Survey, and who for
two years has been an assistant to Louis Janin,
the noted mining engineer, left last week for
London, under engagement with an English
syndicate. He wiii go to West Australia to
examine extensive mineral lands. His ap
pointment, at $5000 a year, was made on Mr.
Janln's recomtieiidation. L. P. Golustone,
formerly of the Mining Bureau and a mining
superintendent at GrasÃ Valley, left lor West
Australia on the last steamer, under engage
ment to another London syndicate, at $7500 a
year. He also owes his position to Mr. Jamu's
recommendation.
Tiie practice of leasing mines to practical
miners who have little or no capital, which Is
growing rapidly in Colorado, 13 stimulating
the demand for miners and increosing the goid
product and the general prosperity. Thou
sands of miners are their own employers,
taking chances on profits and in many cases
making good wages where companies would
ia.ll. Miners individually or in small associa
tions operate mines on this plan and employ
oilier miners at standard wages. This is not
so frequently done to this State, thougn there
are plenty of opportunities. A few months
ago a man with a little knowledge of mining
left the re*t of the unemployed in Sin Fran
cisco and went to Calaveras County, where he
began tunneling gravel from a drift deposit
and washing it, under an arrangement with
the owners of the land. Now he employs
about twenty men, paying wages to the men
and a percentage to the owners, and regularly
pocketing profits.

i John M. Rademaker of San Francisco, who Is
; known in the mining world in connection

of an invention which is an interesting at-
I tempt at an improved method of reducing
cement gold bearing gravel. As such gravel
: is now crushed in stamp mills or by other
comparatively expensive process its success
will be watched by many who are interested
in drift mining. This cement gravel mill is a
cylinder fifteen feet long, the sides of which
are half-inch longitudinal steel bars with
j quarter-inch spaces. Inside two rows of auto
' matic hammers weighing seventeen pounds
I each are arranged in two rows of spiral ar
j rangement. As the cylinder revolves gravel is
fed through a hopper along witii a jetof water.
The cylinder is inclined, and as it revolves
the material is worked along, being constantly
struck by the gravity-hammers. Reduced ma
terial goes through the interstices to a sluice,
and boulders pass out at the end. The steel
cylinder weighs 7200 pounds, is on roller
bearings end the incline is adjustable. The
inventor expacts to handle from 100 to 500
tons per day. according to the gravel, with a
five horse power.

The Wilmerding School-
Site Question Under
Discussion.
University Regents and a Citi
zens' Committee in Con
ference.
Committees appointed by the Mer
chants' Association and the Regents of the
university met at Mayor Fhelan's
office yesterday to confer on the subject of
a site for the Wilmerding School of In
dustrial Arts.
The committee selected by the associa
tion consisted of William Alvord, A. 8.
Baldwin, A. Bouvier, James Britton,
John Center, Charles F. Crocker, Henry
J. Crocker, Horace Davis, Wendell Eas
ton, L. R. Ellert, 0. F. Fargo, James L.
Flood, Hugo D. Keil, Thomas J. Lamb,
Joseph Leggett, E. J. McCutchen, James D.
Phelan, E. B. Pond, Irving M. Bcott, Van
derlynn Stow, Levi Btrauss and Adolpb
Sutro.
The committee of Regents consisted of
Messrs Phelps, Rodgers, Slack and
Denicke.
At the last meeting of the Board of
Regents John Bndd, a brother of the
Governor, gave notice that he would in
troduce a resolution at the'next gathering
to rescind the action making San Fran
cisco the site of the school, and it was to
anticipate this action and iiead it off if
possible that yesterday's meeting was
held.
It was determined to leave no stone un
turned to hava tne school located here,
and to this end (he following resolution
was prepared and adopted:
Whereas, The Board of Regents of the Uni
versity of California has located the Wilraer
dlng School of Industrial Arts In San Fran
cisco; and whereas, it is the desire of the
citizens of San Francisco to assist the Regents
in Micfe-sfuily carrying out the wisiies of the
donor, therefore be it
Jteso red. That & committee of four citizens
be appointed by the Mayor to formulate plans,
in co-operattou with the committee of the
Board of Regents, for securing and tendering
a site and report to this body.
The efforts ot Stockton to get the insti
tution are not thought to carry much
weight, as the RegÂ«nt on whom Mr. Budu
relies to aid him in rescinding the action
is a San Francisco man, not in favor of
Stockton, but rather of Berkeley. In view
of the fact that the faculty of the univer
sity does not desire the Wilmerding School
located there, opposition to the college
town is quite likely to develop to even a
greater degree than it now exists and leave
San Francisco still with a clear field.
Tbo eiving of a site by the citizens of
San Francisco places this Oity on an
equal footing in this respect with the
other towns that are bidding for the
school, and Mr. Wilmerding's unques
tioned preference for San Francisco will
doubtless win the day.
Mayor Phelan appointed the following
committee, to which be was added as an
ex-officio member: Messrs. Irving M.
Scon (chairman). F. W. Dohrmanu, Ed
ward B. Pond and A. S. Baldwin. The
committee decided to hold an early meet*
ing and report back to the main body.

Qerveral DraysoK or\ the LaWs of
Whist
The following letter, recently received from
Major-Genera ! Drayson, late R.A., F.R A.S.,
on the proposed changes in the lawn govern
ing the gumeof whist, will no doubt be read
with great interest by all whist-players in this
country. When our present code of laws was
adopted at the third congress held in Chicago
in 1893 many suggestions offered by General
Drayson in one of his publications, "The Art
of Practical Whist," which came from the
press in 1879, were embodied In them, but for
some unknown reason he never was men
tioned as the originator. There Is no man in
the whist world to-day who has introduced so
many good ideas in the game as be, and we
know of no oue whose opinion will have
greater weight, and lor tnat reason we Invited
him to offer suggestions for improvement on
our code.
We give the fall text of his letter:
20 ashburton Road, j
Southsea, England, i
To P. J. Tortney, Chairman Bevision of the
Laws of Whistâ Dkae Sir: In reply to your
invitation that I should submit any sugges
tion on the above subject, I can state that I
have very few remarks to make and for the
following reasons:
Firstâ ln my book, "'The Art of Practical
Whist," published in 1879, pages 24, 25 and
26, I called attention to the grave defect in
me English laws relative to a player lowering
his hand so that his partner could see every
card and yet no penalty could be inflicted.
Eleven years afterward this law was altered
in the American code. (See law 20, sections 3
and 4.)
Secondâ At page 39 of the same book I re
mark: "The longer I play wbist the more I
regret that rule 91 exists, and that it is at all
possible to see the curds of a trick turned and
quitted."
This suggestion has been adopted in tho I
American laws. (See law 37.)
Thirdâ ln case 19, pave 203, of the same book
I called attention to the injustice of two part
ners who each huld 13 card* not being al
lowed to score on that hand if one ot the ad
versaries held 12 and tUe other adversary 14
lards, and I suggested that additional legisla
tion was desirable in such a case. Law 19,
American rode, has deal t with this case much
in the manner I suggested.
Fourthâ At page 38 of the same book I called
attention to the fact that when a penalty can
be enacted, such as calling a lead, the player on
the right of the leader ought to be the one to
enact the penalty.
This has been adopted as a law by the Amer
ican code. (See law 24.)
This is of coarse gratiiying to me to find that
although these suggestions have been ignored
in England, they have been adopted in Amer
ica.
In Whist of June and November, 1895. I
ventured to offer one or two suggestions rela
tive to slight alterations in the American
law*
Firstâ As the value of the game is deter
mined by deducting the loser's score from 7
(law 1), the penalty for a revoke may be nil.
For example: North and South are at the
â core of 5, Eait and West, at 6. North and
South win two by cards and game; East and
West have revoked. By rule 30 two tricks ,
can be tranlerred from East and West to
North ana South, but this makes no difference
iv the value of the gÂ»me, r.s North and South
were came without the aid of the revoke,
hence no penalty can be inflicted on East and
West for their revoke.
It seems to me that the following slight
alteration in law 30 would meet such a cate.
Law 30:
"The penalty for revoking is the transfer of
two tricks from the revoking side to their
adversaries or deducting two irom the score
of the revoking players," etc.
By law 20, section 1:
"Every card forced upon the table otherwise

WHIST
than in the regular course of play (can be
callea)."
If a player, therefore, places his cards face
upward on the table the whole of his cards
can be called, though he only expose the top
card.
Tnis is the English law, and it is most un
just to inflict so severe a penalty for such an
offense.
I venture to suggest the following as a
remedy for this injustice:
"If a player places his cards face upward on
the table the card or cards exposed can be
called, and in addition one extra card for each
card exposed, the extra card being that im
mediately below the exposed card or cards."
By law 11, English code:
"If an erroneous score be proved, sucn mis
take can be corrected prior to the conclusion
of the game in which it occurred, and such
game is not concluded until the trump card of
the following deal has been turned up."
I cannot find in the American laws any
reference as to when an erroneous score can
or cannot be corrected. It might be as well to
insert such a law.
In the event of such a law being introduced,
say thet after the game is finished the score
cannot be corrected, and more than one game
is to be played by the same partners, we might
encounter this difficulty. Suppose N. S. at the
score of 4. They win two by cards, but by
mistake count three, and hence game. N.
commences to deal for the s u cond game, but
E. then remembers that N. S. won only two by
cards and are not game; he stops N. in his
deal and points out the error in the score,
which N. s. admit and express regret N.
continues dealing, but misdeals. N. claims
law 17, section 6, that he must deal again, as
he was interrupted during his deal.
Might it not be well to embody law SO,
English code, to law 17, section 6, American
code, viz. :
"It the adversaries interrupt a dealer while
dealing, eitner by questioning the score or
asserting that it is not his deal, and fail to es
tablish such claim, should a misdeal occur he
may ilca 1 again."
I venture to offer these few suggestions as I
believe cases must occur where their applica
tion may be of benefit, and having found that
suggestions I made iv 1879 were adopted by
the framers of American whist laws eleven
years afterward, I trust that my remarks may
not be considered presumptuous. Yours very
truly, A. W. Dbayson.

Ur\kir\d arvd Urvcalled-For Criticism.
The whist editor of the Evening Telegraph
of Philadelphia has been going out of his
way In order to keep up his fault-finding and
nonsensical kicking over tbe action of the
executive committee of the American Whist
League, or that portion of the committee that
â pent their time and money to go to Nashville
to attend the midwinter meeting. -Part of the
business that was transacted at this meeting
was the adoption of the report of the tourna
ment committee's programme of whist play
for the seventh congress. In June last the
same editor stated at Manhattan Beach that
the plan of play for the Hamilton tropny was
"an ideal one" ; and yet this year the same
plan has been adopted, with a little improve
ment of having all the teams play in one sec
tion, instead of dividing it into four, and by so
doing permitting every club that enters to
meet every other club in a match of ten to
twenty deals, and now he says "It is the
worst plan ever invented." How ludicrous
would it appear if the whist editor of the Tele
graph was conducting a case in court and
should petition his Honor for a stay of execu
tion before the Jury had rendered its verdict.
This Is not only what he has doi>eâ f or no offi
cial announcement- has, up to the present
writing, been made of what took place at
Nashville â but he asks those that could not or
would not go to mutiny, aud undo if possible
the work of those that did. This is a nice
spirit to entertain.
The editor of Whist, Mr. Cassius M. Paine, is
one of the executive committee who comes
under the ban of the Telegraph. Mr. Paine
was at Nashville and knew what was done,
but showed good common-sense in waiting for
the official report to come irom the secretary
of the league before announcing it in Whist,
but this much he did say: "The action of the
committee will give more opportunity for
play and less opportunity for fatigue, and is
the first step toward a radical and necessary
reform which has been too long neglected."

The Dcs Moines (Iowa) Leader in its Sunday

article, ana second to none in this country.
The whist editor in making his bow to the
whist-players of that State says;
The aim of the whist department of the
Leader Is to supply Central Whist Association
news, the general news of the game and print
illustrative and unusual hands. It does not
assume to be authoritative, but will try to be
consistent in all opinions expressed. We in
vite our readers to send communications,
interesting problems and instructive hands.
Tue following item is from the Leader:
"Whist enthusiasm is certainly at its height
in St. Paul. Recently Judge Bunn was de
tained In court, preventing him from leaving
St. Paul in time to reach Detroit before the
contest for A. W. L. trophy. The St. Paul
club on hearing this immediately tendered
Jndge Bunn a special engine and coach with a
guarantee from the railroad company that
they would land him in Detroit In time lor
the game."

Since neither party in the Senate is in

As Congressman Champ Clark of Mis

Lord Salisbury's plan of establishing a

Mr. Humington has made sure of his
welcome home by bringing with him the

This wili be accounted as good news all

The efforts of some Chicago men to get
President McKinley to go to that city and
take an active part in the municipal cam

Every morning the Senators gravely bo

candidly tell what they said during the
discussion. Thus the dignity of diplo

the Senators get their names in the papers
just as usual.
The Secretary of the Navy has directed
that there shall be assembled at the
Golden Gate carnival as many of the war

we shall, therefore, have a naval display

fact it will be the biggest carnival of the
year in every respect and the reputation
of it will be National.
An Ohio girl who was balked in an at*

Speaker Reed told a com mil tee of the
Indianapolis monetary conference that
until the tariff bill has been enacted Con

The decision of the Supreme Court ad
verse to railway traffic associations may
yet turn out to be one of the most far
reaching and important decisions ever
made by that high tribunal. It confirms
the validity of anti-trust laws and opens
the way for effective dealing with such
combinations by legislative enactment |
The consequences are certain to be great
and may even amount to a virtual revolu

doing business on a large scale.
The Board of Health is doing good work
in suppressing the sale of adulterated '
foods in this City, but it should be careful
to do it in the right way. It will be a
waste of time and energy to make war
against .harmless combinations of apple
and currant jelly no matter under what
name they are sold, so long as there re
main any injurious adulterations unex
posed and unprevented. The board should
direct Its effort* to prevent the importa
tion of pernicious, iraudulent and coun
terfeit food products which come into
competition with the pure foods of the
State. There is enough to be done in that
line to employ all its capacity for work
without beginning a harassing attack on
reputable merchants simply because a
chemist thinks he has discovered apple
jelly in a package marked currant. Even
good work can be deprived of half its effi
cacy ii performed in the wrong way.
A TRADITION SHATTERED.
Last Monday the Supreme Court of the
United States handed down a decision in
the case of the Trans-Missouri Freight
Association, virtually affirming the .in
validity of all railroad trusts or combines
throughout the United States. The de
cision was written by Justice Peckham
and concurred in by all but four of his
associates, the diFsenters being Justices
Field, Gray, Shiras and White, led by the
latter. Day before yesterday Justice
White entered a minority dissenting
opinion.
It took the trusts some little time to
realize what had happened to them. The
stupendous significance of that single
utterance from the highest tribunal in the
land rather sailed over their heads and
did but little damage to their seasoned
air of complacency when it first issued
from the judicial chambers. It was only
on its return trip that it settled down to
their level and confronted them face to
face like a terrible menacing confliction.
Then they began to rub their eyes and
ask themselves in startled gasps what on
earth the Supreme Court had done to
them while they were not looking. It is
something distinctly new for the law to
abate its studious consideration for trusts
and combinations of wealth and put an
actual check to their profitable habit of
going wrong.
The preying of associated capital upon
the general public has become almost a
tradition, and as such ha 3 enjoyed the
due reverence of governmental authori
ties, who are taught to love anything that
is systematicâ which the trnst Imposi
tions certainly have been. But this radi
cal departure of the Supreme Court has
done much to convince the gentlemen of
trustful predilections that the tradition
theory has been little more than a delu
sion and a snare.
The result of this decision will be to seg
regate the various railroad companies
and set them apart from each ether on
individual bases. Each company must
hereafter make its own rates of fares and
freights, instead of pooling all together
and naviiig the prices fixed by a general
traffic association. This will probably
pave the way to competition and lower
rates all along the line.
It i 3 further declared that not only rail
roads but all institutions which lend
themselves to combinations for the pur
pose of maintaining a uniform scale of
prices will be affected by the innovation,
assuming that it is an innovation to have
an already existent law sustained after it
has long been abused and denied by
custom. Considerable apprehension and
uneasiness ate felt by lumber trusts and
others. They fear that they may no
longer be permitted to swell their divi
dends by a concerted and false inflation of
prices. Kerosene, for example, may come
down to what it i<j worth, compelling the
Standard Oil kings to cut short the mil
lion-dollar dowries which they had in
contemplation for the next European
noblemen who ma 7 wed their daughters.
Then, of a truth, the millennium will be
hard by.
GOING TOO fAR.
A really important crisis was reached
when the "powers" of Europe, on the 20th
inst., decided to blockade Crete. A few
days later the fort of Mnlaxa, occupied
by Turkish troops, was seized by a com
pany of Cretan insurgent?, and the Turks
were forced to vacate, leaving their vic
torious foes in charge. Thereupon the
European warships, which had hung by
uncertain whether to interfere or not,
notified ihe Cretans to consider the taken
forts in charge of the "powers," as they
were afraid to trust the Christian inhabi
tants thereof to the mercy of troops in
war. This sudden attack of solicitude for
Christianity seized the precious "powers"
immediately after an army of Christians had
driven an army of Turks out of command of
the forts and had taken command of them
and their Christian inhabitant? them
selves â whereat we are doubtless to as
sume that the Christian "powers" are
concerned for the salety of Christians
only when the latter aro under the rule of
Christians, and not when they are under
the rule oi Turks.
That brilliant bit of logic is a fair sam
ple of the spirit which Is moving the
"powers" so unreasonably against King
George at every point They are now
blockading him so as to be constantly at
hand to interfere in behalf of Turkey
whenever the chance may arise, as it
arose Thuisday. They are defending the
Turks, aiding ana abetting them in every
possible manner. Yet King George
swears before high heaven that he will
never give up, that he will disrupt the
Turkish empire, and perchance involve
all Europe in an interminable war, unless
he attains his purpose. The "powers,"
ridiculed at home and despised abroad,
seem rather more dogged than purpose
ful. They act as though they had unwit
tingly bitten off a piece .of actual war, un
der the impression that it was merely the
every-day "talk" of war which they had
been vaingloriously accustomed to feed
ing upon daily, and afterward were for
bidden by pride to back out of eating it.
It may prove better for their ultimate
dignity, however, if they back out now,
before future events make it harder for
them to do so.
FUTURE OF SOUTH AFRICA.
The information tbat Dr. Jameson has
given before the South African Parliamen
tary Commission of the condition of affairs
that made revolt against the Boer Govern
ment desirable, coupled with the report
that the most capable and powerful man
in the Dark Continent, President Paul
Kruger, is in favor of a confederation of
the States there into.a free republic, sug
gests the probability that another great
nation will soon take its place in modern
history.
President Kruger, whose astute states
manship nas outwitted the diplomacy of
England, is strongly opposed to any union
which would make the federation a part of
the British empire, but to combine the
states into a new independent nation is
altogether a different question, and he
would gladly assist in its consummation.
It is plain from the history of the baffled
raid, which is being elowly drawn out
from authentic sources, that a change in
the political system is needed in that big
country, which has now become a sort of
new world awaiting development. The
Uillanders of the Rand are ripe for revolt.
Their cry of oppression is founded on the
fact thai they are taxed without represen
tation. They pay the great bulk ot the
revenue that supports the Boer Govern
ment, bat they have no voice in its policy.
While the present government of the
Transvaal seems, thereio-e, to be bad for
the English settlers, the condition of the
country over which England has supreme
power also requires a change of govern
ment According to the criticism of some
of their own countrymen the English rule
over the natives has been harsh and un
just The revolt of the Matabeles was
aroused by tyrannical regulations; the
negroes In the region controlled by the
South African Company are practically
enslaved by labor-enforcement. laws and
the demand made upon the natives for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 28, 1897.
tribute in cattle amounts to ruinous con
fiscation. Government by a commercial
company, is not considered by residents
and students of the situation there as con
ducive to the general prosperity of the
people.
This being the condition of affairs, the
founding of a great republic in South
Africa would be an achievement worth the
ambition of a great statesman. It would
pot an end to jealousies and possibilities
of war between the states. The English
mining population could then get tUeir
coveted representation in the Transvaal,
and the Dutch would he freed from the
apprehension of danger from the over
grown British empire. The two races
could harmonize in efforts to rapidly de
velop the vast unused resources of the
country, to populate the wide wastes of
the Dark Continent and transform it to a
land of light
THE TURKISH ARMY.
In view of the complications in the
East the value of Turkey's offensive
power again becomes of vital interest.
Whatever else may be said of Turkey it is
certain that if war comes she will prove
no mean antagonist. In addition to the
number of troops she could put into the
field, there is the blind enthusiastic fanat
icism of the Prophet's followers to be
reckoned with. This will go far toward
offsetting any military deficiencies she
may possess.
The total strength of the combatant
forces of the Turkish empire is upward of
700,000. The array ib organized on the
modern territorial system, as in France
and Germany, the empire being divided
for the pnrpose into six military districts,
while Western and Southwestern Arabia
form a seventn district, but drawing its
recruits from Turkey proper.
Tne nomad Kurds and Arabs, although
subject to service, are not recruited.
Christians are allowed to pay an exemp
tion tax, the result beiirj that the army
consists almost entirely of Turks. Liabil
ity to service begins at 20 and ends at 40.
Of this twenty years six are passed in the
Nizam, or regular army, eight in the
Kedif. corresponding to the German Land
wehr, and six in the Mustahfuz, or Land*
sturm. About 140,000 Moslems yearly be
come liable to service. Of these some
50.000 pass into the Nizam, where they
serve four years with the colors and then
remain on the reserve for two years. At
the end of this time they pass into the
RediL
Each of the six territorial districts con
tains an army corps of two infantry divi
sions, a cavalry division and other troops
of the Nizam. The second line, orKedif,
is organized into twenty-two divisions,
spread over the six districts.
The artillery ha 3 recently besn reorgan
ized and now has about 1400 guns, mostly
new pattern Kfupps. The infantry large
bore rifles are being converted into small
caliber (.3012 in.) so as to take the same
ammunition as the Mausers, which were
introduced in 1890 and of which a large
number are on hand. The question of an
adequate supply of horses for the cavalry
and artillery wiil doubtless cause great
embarrassment in case of war.
It is reported that Turkey has already
begun to mobilize her army. The mobili
zation of the forces of a state and their
subsequent concentration at the threat
ened point form the opening act of the
modern war drama. No matter how well
prepared Turkey may be on paper, if she
fails to rapidly mobilize and concentrate
her forces she will lose the initiative, and
with it possibly the power of carrying the
war into the enemy's country. On this
initiative there may easily depend the
outcome of the war. This truth was
forcibly brought out in the Franco-Ger
man war.
Owing tolacuof proper railroad facili
ties and other modes of communication in
Turkey, it is not probable that mobiliza
tion can be rapidly effected, arid some
time will elapse before she can concentrate
much of a force on her Grecian frontier,
while several months would probably be
required for concentration in a distant
part of the empire. No decisive results
can then be anticipated under some weeks
at least.
IMPORTANT RAILROAD ITEM.
Probably the most important utterance
which Mr. C. P. Huntington has made
since nis return to California this time is
the statement that the proposed railroad
connection of San Luis Obispo with Santa
Barbara and other coast cities to the south
ward would be completed within the
present year.
Already the line has progressed south
ward from San Luis Obispo to a few miles
the other side of Tuugair, and northward
from Santa Barbara as far as El wood.
The pap to be spanned is not very wide.
The benefit which will result to the
country down that way from this pro
vision of increased transportation facilities
is inestimable. The whole region in and
around San Luis Obispo County is extra
ordinarily fertile.
The chief cause of hard times there
abouts, the producers aver, has been a
lack of means by which to convey their
products to market. Great quantities of
surplus fruits and vegetation have been
amassed during certain favorable seasons,
and the best that the growers could do
with them has been to trade them around
among each other or to the stores in Paso
Rubles, 'Jem pie ton, San Luis and other
neighboring towns in return for manu
factured articles. This primitive ex
pedient raay soon be outgrown, as the
prospect appears from Mr. Hunlingtoa's
statement; and when it is so a new era of
prosperity ought to open for San Luis and
her neighbors.
PROTECTION TO TORPEDOES.
The United States Government, profit
ing by past study and observation, has
decided that its new torpedo-boats, which
are now being constructed at Bath, Me.,
shall be protected by armor plates at the
expense of sevoral knots of speed, which
the extra weight wiil prevent. With the
possibility of auaiuinn thirty knots per
hour in sight the naval authorities will
smother their modern inclinations with a
sigh and content themselves with a speed
of twen,ty-five knots. The slower vessel
will sacrifice speed to the desirable object
of remaining intact during the heat of
battle.
It will be recalled that the torpedo-boat
which made itself seem almost practical
as an engine of war by destroying the
Chinese ship Ting Yuen in the late Japan-
ese-Chineseengagement was denied a com
plete realization of that proud distinction
by getting itself destroyed in the experi
ment.
Thus one of the nearest approaches to
an actual demonstration of the torpedo
boat's superiority over a tugboat in war
was deteated by a misfortune â the mis
fortune consisting of a scatter-gun pro
jected over the side of its sinking oppo
nent.
Hitherto these remarkable little boat*
have been built with scarcely any regard
for their safety under tire. The very
thinnest coat of metal has been deemed
sufficient protection for their boilers or
for any other parts of them. Now, bow
ever, the American builders are awaken
ing to the folly of this and are gome here
after to insure the small craft a reasonable
protection at the cost of some little speed.
It would appear that lue old adage about
staying to fight Instead of running away is
Id a fair way to being recognized in actuaJ
modern warfare, if, indeed, the bare
suggestion of such a move do not tend
forthwith to discourage modern warfare.

SOME AMERICANS ABROAD.
BY A.N B2C - ATTACHE.
Compared with other countries, the
United States is a perfect giant in size.
But immense as are its possibilities and
area, it is apparently not big enougu for
some of its natives, who, regarding its
limits as being of too restricted a char
acter, seek what they look upon as a wider
field abroad. And thus it happens that
in almost every capital and nearly every
court of the civilized and uncivilized
world there am to be found American
men and women playing a role of suf
ficient importance to necessitats the
reckoning with their individuality and
their influence. Sometimes the latter
is exercised for good, while in a few
instances its effects have been of a
contrary character, but in either case
it has been sufficiently powerful to
require it to be taken into account.
It would occupy too much space and
time to describe the means by which this
influence is achieved and maintained. A
good deal, if not most, of it may be briefly
ascribed to the fact that to the reputation
for honesty and frank dealing which the
Enel sh-speaking races throughout the
universe enjoy among other nationalities
the Americans unite a keenness and quick
ness of intellect, a species of mental smart
ness, if I may be permitted to use the ex
pression, which pertains far more to the
countrymen of Machiavelli and to the
Orientals than to the Anglo-Saxons.
This talent whicn Americans possess
of raising themselves above the common
place and for making their individu
ality felt in foreign countries, baa been
been brought home to my mind dur
ing the past week by the death at Wash
ington of that gallant soldier. Colonel Alexan
der Macomb Mason, a trusted and loyal ad
viser and friend of three Egyptian Khedives
in succession. A grandson of that General
Macomb who died as commander-in-chief of
the United States army, Mason took part as
a naval officer in the Civil War, and after its
termination saw active service in Chile and
Cuba before making his way to Cairo, where,
along with a number of other American
officers, he was employed by Khedive Ismail
to reorganize the Egyptian army *nd navy.
It was while thus engaged that he was
brought into contact with General Gordon,
and that he should have succeeded in winning
the friendship, the confidence and the re
gard of such a man as this most ec
centric but brilliant and heroic English
officer, speaks volumes in favor of Mason.
What specially endeared him to Gordon was
his singular modesty, his discretion, and
above all his ability to bold his tongue.
Mason was one of the most quiet and un
assuming men that it has ever been my fate to
encounter, and it was not until I had known
him several months â being in almost daily
intercourse with himâ that I learned through
others of his splendid record in the Soudan,
where he made the first survey of Lake Albert
Nyanza and where he co-oDerated with Gor
don in the organization of that once so pros
perous equatorial empire of the Khedive.
Gordon was one of the most difficult men to
get along with, and there were days when he
was so excitable and irritable as to be abso
lutely unfit for human intercourse. No
one realized this belter than he did
himself, and being very fond of Mason
and unwilling to quarrel with him, he made
en arrangement which was as characteristic of
the one man as it was ot the other. It was
agreed that whenever Gordon felt his fits of
irritability and exasperation coming on he
should hangout of his window or above his
door, a huge bottle-ax, which he picked up in
the Soudan, and that whenever this danger
signal should be hung out Mason should give
him a wide berth. Xhe agreement worked
splendidly. Mason never betook himself to
Gordon's residence without looking up for the
battle-ax, and' if the later was in sight noth
ing in the world, not even the most pressing i
official business, could induce him to intrude
upon the privacy of his chief. Mason had the
singular faculty of inspiring iv everybody
with whom he was brought into contact the
same degree of confidence that he enjoyed on
the part of Gordon. There is no place in the
world where there is such an amouut of in
trigue as at Cairo, where everybody is more or
less engaged in the praiseworthy task of trip
ping up his neighbor and his friend. Animosi
ties rage there with an intensity born of the
heat of the neighboring desert, and generally
speaking the man who endeavors to steer a
middle course and 10 avoid committing him
self either ou the one side or the other ends
by incurrng the suspicion and the ill will of
both. Mason, however, was an exception to
this rule. Everbody liked him and every
body trusted him, and thus it happened
that although he had been loyal to
Ismail, he stood equally hleh in favor with
his son and successor, Tewlik, and that in
suite of his having played a prominent part in
the incidents that occurred prior to England's
occupation of Egypt, he was requested by the
British Government iv 1835 to act jointly
with the late Admiral Sir William Hewett in
a special embassy to King John of Abyssinia.
It was a mission of great personal risk, es
pecially at that particular juncture, and had
it not been for the fact of Mr. Gladstone being
in office and so averse to every
thing connected with Egypt that he
would not hear its very name mentioned
either m Cabinet councils or In societyâ it hav
ing the same effect upon him as a red flag
upon a bullâ some token of royal recognition
would have undoubtedly been conferred by the
Queen upon the English admiral and his Egyp
to-Amerlcan colleague. Mason, I may add, like
wise played a conspicuous role in all those
negotiations which led to the transfer of
Massowah and of other Red Sea ports to Italy
jointly by England and by Egypt, and I doubt
if there has ever been any one not an English
citizen or a servant of the Queen who has
been initiated to such an extent in the diplo
matic and state secrets of Great Britain as
Colonel Mason.
Never was a more modest and unobtrusive
man than this square-jawed, taciturn and yet
genial-faced and warm-hearted American,
whose services to tbe cause of geographical
science at tbe headwaters of the Nile entitle
him to a prominent place among the African
explorers. Over and over again was promo
tion to the rank of Pasha pressed upon him,
not merely by Khedive Tewfik, but aUo by his
successor, the English authorities. Lord Cro
mer, first and foremost, warmly recommended
him for the distinction. Yet he invariably re
fused, alleging as an excuse that he had no
hankering lor titular distinction, and that
while his means were sufficient to maintain
him as a Bey or colonel, they were inadequate
for a full-fledged Pasha or general. For Mason,
I must explain, in spite of the unrivaled op
portunities which he had enjoyed in the
Soudan, as in Lower Egypt, tor enriching him
self, had remained a poor manâ no smail
credit for Â» public official in a country where
tbe very air that one breathes is tainted with
the most gross dishonesty and corruption,
where principles are conspicuous only for
their absence and integrity is derided. In one
word, Mason was an American of whom every
one of his countrymen had reason to be
proud, and who, never at any moment forget
ting the country of his birth and bis citizen
ship thereof, caused the name ot the United
States to be honored and respected in coun
tries where it had, up to that time, been un
known.
Counterparts of Mason are to be found
figuring in the modern history of many an
other foreign nation. Thus the Chinese have
the reputation of being the most ungrateful
people In the world and of being averse to
recognizing anything done in their behalf by
a foreigner. Yet, although more than a quar
ter of a century has elapsed since the death of
Anson Buriingame, his name remains re
spected and even revered throughout the vast
Celestial empire. Neither the Mandarins, nor
yet the people, forget that it was mainly
through his efforts in their behalf that
their country first obtained proper treat
ment and consideration by Western nations,
and that to him belongs the credit of having
first established diplomatic intercourse be
tween what is known as the -'Middle King
dom" and the civilized powers of the world.
As Iw as ay experience is cooceraod, the
Japanese are far less grateful for PMttawi
thnn the Chinese, and are, moreover, so firmly
imbued with the conviction that they are
clever enough to be able to dispense with for
eign advice even in matters relating to foreign
sciences, arts and manufactures that they con
sign as far as possible to oblivion the names
of those who assisted them in emerging from
their former chrysalis stage into their present
state ot gay and giddy butterflydom. Â»nd who
served them as nurses and mentors when cast
ing aside the swaddling clothes in which
mummy like they had been enveloped for
thousands of years they first attempted
falteringly to walk according to Western
fashion, and in the paths of our civilization.
That is why one hears so little nowadays of
the American General Williams to whom the
present financial organization of Japan is
mainly due, ana who succeeded (without pe
cuniary benefit for himself) in negotiating
abroad a 7 per cent loan for the Japanese
Government at a time when owing to the
prejudices against the land of the Kising Sun,
and the disbelief in the permanency of serious
ness of its Western innovation 10 or 12 per
cent would not have appeared to be an exces
sive interest lo demand.
Moreover, if the Japanese troops showed
themselves to such advantage in their last
war with China, it was in a part at any rate
due to the teachings and advice of another
American, General Legendre, who was all
powerful in Japanese military matters at
Tokio in the early seventies, and the foreign
coadjutor and adviser of General Saigo in his
victorious campaign against Formosa in
1874.
Of an entirely different order, less reputable
but equally powerful, if not more so, was the
role played in Holland and in Paris by the
famous Mmc Musard, an American lady, a na
tive of Pennsylvania, who until a year or two
before her death was justly regarded in Eu
rope as the Egeriaof old King William of Hol
land. It was thanks to her and to her alone
that the war between France and Germany of
1870 did not break out three years previously
in connection with the Luxemburg contro
versy. King William was in 1867 on the point
of disposing ol his grand duchy of Luxemburg
to France, prompted thereto by his hatred of
Prussia and his friendship for Napoleon 111.
Luxemburg was at the time garrisoned by
Prussian troops, this by virtue of a former
military convention, dating from the time
when the grand duchy formed part of the
German "Bund" or confederation. Had
this sale o( Luxemburg to France been com
pletedâKing William and Emperor Napoleon
did not propose to let any one know of it un
til it was announced as an accomplished fact â
war would have Inevitably ensued between
France and Prussia. For on the one hand Na
poleon would have gone too far to retreat, with
outa loss of prestige dangerous to the existence
and solidity of his throne, while on the other
hand Prussia would assuredly have declined
to withdraw, without a bloody struggle, her
troops from a fortress of such immense strategi
cal importance as was Luxemburg in those
days, in order to hand it over to a power with
which it was certain looner or later to be at
war. By gome means or other the dissolute
and drunken Prince of Orange, then living at
Paris, obtained an Inkling of what was going
on. Sober enough to realize the imprudence,
from a Dutch point of view, of what was going
to take place, and sufficiently sensible to per
ceive that it must inevitably land France and
Prussia in a war with one another â a war
which: would interfere sadly with his life of
pleasure on the banks of the Seine; aware
too, that his father, with whom he was at dag
gers drawn, would merely drive him from his
presence with curses If he attempted to remon
strate with him about the matter, hastened
to Mme. Musard and appealed to her to use
her iuflueuce with the King to withdraw from
the deal before it was too late. This she en
deavored to do; but finding that, in spite of
all herareuments. the King remained irreso
lute, and fearing lust, unbeknown to
her, he would carry through bis pro
ject, she warned the celebrated Mme.
Favia (afterward Countess Henckel yon Don
nersmark) of what was on the cards, aud before
many hours had elapsed Count BlstnarcK had
been placed in possessiou of all the facts of the
case. Had Prussia boon prepared at that mo
ment for war with France Bismarck would
have said nothing, but have awaited events.
But Prussia was not ready. She had not then
completed her military conventions with the
southern States of Germany, so the Count
caused the Prussian Embassador at Berlin to
notify the French Government that if the eale
was carried into effect it would be regarded at
Berlin as a casus belli. The French Cabinet,
which had until then been in complete igno
rance of the whole matterâ lor Napoleon was
very Bccretive â brought Bismarck's message
to the Emperor's notice, aud the ultimate re
sult of the affair was that a conference of the
great powers waa summoned in London to de
vise an agreement, according to the terms of
which the Prussian garrison at Luxemburg
was withdrawn, the fortifications razed to the
ground and the neutrality of the grand duchy
assured under terms which precluded the
possibility of its ever becoming the
property of either France or Ger
many. I may add that had Bismarck
notified the Emperor instead of his Miniater
of Foreign Affairs of his objections to the
deal, the whole thing would have been hushed,
up without anybody knowing anything
about it. But, as it was, the affair became
public through the indiscretion of the offi
cials of the Qua! d'Orsay, and the important
part played by Mm e. Musard became known.
For had not the American Egeria of King
William of Holland intervened to prevent the
sale of Luxemburg in 1867 nothing could
have prevented the war between France and
Germany breaking out then and there.
Without making more than a passing refer
ence to the fact that a couple of American
gentlemen had acquired so much Influence
over the late King of Wurtemberg as to
bring about a Ministerial crisis in 1888, and
very nearly the deposition of the King, the
difficulty being oaly settled by the exile of
the two foreigners from the country, I would
draw attention to the role played not
merely in English society, but also
in British political life, by Lady Ran
dolph Churchill, a New York girl to whom
her brilliant husband owed so much of his
success as a statesman: to William Waldorf
Astor, who, by a judicious use of his wealth
and of the journalistic properties which he
has acquired, is becoming one of the powers
with which English Parliamentary parties
have to reckon ; to the Countess Gianottl and
the Princess Brancaccio, both of them Ameri
can women who through Queen Marguerite,
whose ladies-in-waiting they are, and through
their husbands, who are among the principal
dignitaries of the Italian court, exercise much
iufluenco over King Eumberi, and last, but
by no means least, to Dr. Thomas Evans at
Paris, who, during his forty years of profes
sional attendance upon the teeth of European
royalty, has, to my personal knowledge, been
intrusted with many a confidential message
and delicate negotiation, being often asked by
one reigning family to repeat what he hid
heard to other patients of sovereign rank whlie
holding them at the mercy of his skillful for
ceps. There are so many things that cannot
be transmitted through the ordinary official
and diplomatic channels, and yet which have
often a most important bearing upon the
course of events.

A WOMAN'S COCRIEK â By William Joseph
Teoman. atone & Kimball. New York. Price
$ 1 25. For sale by William Doxey, Palace
Hotel, Ciiy.
The famous forty conspiracy of 1696, which
had for its object the assassination of William
111 of Eugland aud the replacing of James II
on the throne, is the kernel of tiiis historical
tale. Around this central fact are grouped a
number of interesting incidents of adventure
and love wherein history mingles with ro
mance. The descriptions of some of the men
and women prominent in that period are viv
idly done and give history a stronger hold
upon our memories. The book has attracted
Considerable notice in England.
The author has produced two books before
this, both of which received high praise. The
first wns "Kinsr Wiliiam the Third," which
one of the prominent literary papers com
mended as having all the attractiveness of Sir
Walter Scott's historical novels. His second
venture was a book of poems, which so good
an authority as Gladstone indorsed by writing
f.that he was very sensible of the gifts displayed
in it. Mr. Yeoman is a lawyer, but divides
his time with literature. Until recently he
\ was writing leaders for the Liverpool Daily
Courier, and he is a frequent contributor to
other journals and magazines in England,
lie is an athlete, and to this and to the fnct
that he spent most of his boyhood iv an out
door life on the Scottish border an>l in Wales
Is doubtless to be attributed the style of nar
rative which he delights to telL Feats of
strength and courage and wild adventures
with highwaymen, duelling and such have an
evident fascination for him, and he has the
art to communicate this to his reader. A good
index to his feelings in this matter may De,
perhaps, found in the following words from
his book: "Yet I must not be taken to cry
down feats of arms and the like. God forbid I
It will b9 an ill day for our country when ncr
sons are all clerks, and might of limb aud
valor only to be read of in the works of the
Bcribes."
The title is derived from Sir John Tolbot's
having been sent by his sister as a courier to
warn her lover that he was suspected of plot
ting against the King's life, and as a result of
this quest all the stirring events, of the tale
follow. Sir John himself suspects that his
sister's betrothed is a traitor to the king he
loves and honors, but because of his affection
for his sister he persists in his disagreeable
and dangerous undertaking, and he thus gets
an insight into the whole villainous plot. The
book contains some surprises and it is best not
to risk spoiling the reader's interest and pleas
ure in perusing the exciting narrative by giv
ing too full an outline of it here.
Among the prominent personages described
are the Duke of Shrewsbury, Lord Marl
borough, Sarah Jennings, Prince George of
Hesse, King William and Catherine Sedley,
Countess of Dorchester, who was the mistress
of King James IL There is a description of
the litterateurs; at Will's coffee-house, and
among them Dryden. In style the book has
the strength of simplicity, and its perusal will
be found both entertaining and valuable as
fixing history more vividly in the memory.
The following description of King William
the Third Is a good example of what the
writer can do: "I now had a good opportun
ity of observing the workings of this wonder
ful man's willâ and of witnessing the power of
control he was reputed to poÂ»sess over emo
tions naturally strong and passions which
most people would have found absolutely un
governable-
' Never did I behold him to greater advan
tage, and never did I realize more how the in
dividual was merged in the monarch than on
this occasion.
"Instead of a frail, sensitive, ailing crea
ture â a puny invalidâ l saw before me a calm,
cold, impassive machine â a thing of adamant,
impervious to sentiment, and apparently do
void of the usual feelings of fear anJ rage
which are supposed to dominate our kind.
Cool, calculating and reserved in manner, he
sat there âcontrasting strangely with the
feverish anxiety and excitement of those
about him.
"And as I watched my blood rushed wildly,
and my pulses throbbed aloud with admira
tion. For I experienced his dominating in
fiuence, and knew how much he towered
above us all."

by A. M. Kobertaon, Post street. City.
A thoroughly good story, translated into Eng
lish reading so smoothly and strongly that we
feel confident it has lost little in its transfer
from another language, is this novel by a Rus
sian, illustrative of life in Ho y Russia and the
traits characteristic of its people. The green
book from which the title of the story is
taken is a sort of register supposed to be kept
by the Russians who are conspiring revolution;
and which contains a record of the confer
ences In every distant province and lists of the
names of conspirators. The scene is laid
mainly in St Petersburg and in the time oi
the reign of Alexander I. A Russian po*t
named Pushkin is beloved by the prima
donna, Zeneida Ilmarine, but inasmuch as she
is the chief conspirator she drives him away
from her to keep his life from dauger. At the
command of the Tsar he engages himself to
Sophie Narishkin, the TsaKs illegitimate
daughter. With the surroundings of such a
country of deep secrets and severe condemna
tion. 1 !, and with love, patriotism, ambition and
terror making the various motives for his
characters, it is easy to imagine that this able
â writer has built a thrilling tale.

SPEAKING TROPICALLY.
TELK HAPPY HYPOCRITK, By Max Beer
bohm. John Lane, the Bodley -Head. Xew
York and London. Price, 35 cents. .
This truly brilliant little allegory, which is
John Lane, ilie Bodley Head. .New
id London. Trice, 35 cents,
ily brilliant little allegory, which is
called "A Fairy Tale for Tired Men," is worth
reading for its wit aloue, and eliminating the
wit, the exquisitely beautiful seriousness
which the author half conceals with a sem
blance of the most careless levity, would mace
the artistic booklet a rare bit of master work
manship. Add to these two excellencies the
wonderfully taught lesson of life the figura
tive story conveys with such refreshingly
unique grace, and the trinity of charms con
densed into so small a space . makes a surpass
ing treat for heart and brain. If it is not large
enough to be called a literary feast, it is cer
tainly a most delicious literary lunch. We are
told in a humorous way that excels in airy
I lightness of how the dissolute Lord George
Hell masks his evil face for love of Jenny
Mere, and saying ''Lord George Hell is dead,"
signs his name to the marriage certificate as
Lord George Heaven.
In the art of telling a. fairy tale for grown
folks Max Beerbohm has here reached a per
fection which deserves a crown of roses, and
he takes the cake and champagne of life for
| ever if he continues such meritorious story
telling and gets his deserts. If the effect of
literature on life is potent as it should be, this
parable put before the world with superlative
cleverness and grace may well start many an
other Lord George Hell on the way to becom
ing another Lord George Heaven; and many
another sweet Jenny Mere, after inspiring a
transformation in her lover, may find therein
a happy suggestion that perhaps she can con
tinue to love on even after the mask of her
happy hypocrite is torn away and the confi
dence of , love hides nothing. Many are the
ways in which the heart Is reached, and this
witty tale may be read by some who would
never heed a sermon.
BY A CALIFORNIAN POET.
In the current Scribner's the Californiftn
poet, Charles Edwin Markham, has a notable
piece of work which he calls "A Look Into the
Gulf."
It is an unusual and powerful piece of poetic
Imagery, such as thi9 writer often gives. In
it he has made Semiramis, the ancient Queen
of Nineveh, stand for the picture of all hfo
built up upon the desire of self, gone to pieces
in the awful wreck of time, yet beating on
after death in the terrible fulfillment of Its
choice in life.
"A LOOK INTO THE GULF."
I looked one night, and ihe c Semiramis,
With all her mourning doves about her head,
Sat rocking on an ancient road to hell,
withered and eyeless, chanting to the moon
Snatches of song thÂ°y sang to her of old
fpon the lighted roofs of Nineveh.
And then her voice rang out with rattling letgh :
" The bugles they are crying back againâ
Busies that broke the nights of Babylon.
And then went crying on through Nineveh.
Sturm back, ye trembling messengers of 111,
I rush out with my hair unbound to quell
Insurgent cities. Let the Iron tread
Of armies shace th? earth. Jx>olc, lofty towers:
Assyria goes by upon the wind."
And so she babbles by the ancient road,
While cities turned to dust upon the earth
Rlae through her whirling brain to live again â
Babbles all riijcnt, and when her voice Is dead
Her weary lips beat on without a sound.

STORY OF REGRETTED ERROR.
KITTY THE RAG-By Rita. R. F. Renno <t Co.,
New York. Price, $1 25.
Rita has given an elaborate portrayal of the
effect of a single false step upon a proud and
noble being. There are some passages in the
book which approach too closely the grandilo
quent and thus lose much force upon the feel
ings of the reader.
"Kitty the Rag" is a clever character study.
The priest in the s:ory gives^a brief outline of
such a nature when he said* to her: "I know
that want, that restless craving for something
better, easier, sensuous and self-satisfying.
You have the woman soul. Pray heaven it
may not leÃd you into error as it has led so
many." Some of the sermonizing is done
with considerable beauty ot language.

BAD BOY'S ADVENTURES.
THE OEORGIE PAPERSâ By George E. Booram.
Illustrated by himself. Published by the J. 8.

It is an excellent antidote for the blues and a
splendid book on which to spend a bad hour

ABOUT BOOKBINDING.
If the statement were made at random that
the book-printing houses and binderies of
New York have the capacity to produce 100,
--000 first-class library volumes per week, it
would be taken as an extravagance. It would
be within the truth, nevertheless. Another
100,000 of ordinary schoolbook?, or the
cheaply made volumes for department-store
trade, could be added to these figures, and
still there would be no interference with the
regular output of briefs, tracts, patent medi
cine almanacs and the like, which scarcely
line under the head of book printing, says the
New York Times. â¢
The trade or art of bookmnking has devel
oped to rapidly and reached such stupendous
proportions that there is no such thing as
keening a statistical record of it. Compared
to newspaper making, it is still slow business,
but the binderies of the United States have
reached a point where they are able to pro
duce every book that is required for the trade
of the American continent, good, bad and in
different.
Book publishers are looking forward to the
time when importations will cease, except, of
course, in the matter of special editions, an
tiquated or rare volumes. They are demon
strating every day that they can meet the
highest requirements of the domestic trade,
both as regards quality and number. If books
are produced more cheaply anywhere in the
world than here, it is because labor is paid
less. It Is not because there are better
equipped establishments abroad than in this
country.
Binding is the slow part of the bookmaklng
trade. . It has appeared to come toward per
fection much more leisurely than printing.
Even with the latest improvements in ma
chinery a great deal of the work has to be
done by hand. Another explanation is thnt
the woric in a bindery has to go through cer
tain processes which machinery cannot
hurry. The drying, pressing and turning and
the fitting of backs are comparatively Blow
operations at best. Where different colors are
used on the covers & day or more must be al
lowed for one to dry before the next is put on.
In comparison with the speed of printing, the
binding of books is a slow process; yet in the
aggregate of a week's production the result Is
surprisingly large.
American penius Is to be credited with the
modern bookbinding machinery, but England
has ; always ; stood 5 first in" the : superiority of
hand bindingâ perhaps does to-dayâ bnt she
has had to come to the United States . for ma
chinery with which to keep her bindery equip
merits, abreast with the developments of the
time. In : : this : particular, >â  as ;In the pro
duction of printing presses,;- America leads
the lj world. :It is often > commented on
as a peculiar Â« fact that Germany, which
' invented printing, lags : behind ; France,
England and the United States in the produc
tion of books; thai is, in artistic covers and
good bin ling., France has been at the front
in the matter of taste and finish, but has
never equaled 'â ' England )in ; the' strength and
general excellence of binding. Neither coun
try equals the ; United : States , in s the T develop
ment of facilities. It is not too *; much to say
that for speed and general effectiveness the
United States leads all nations. â¢â '; :; .
:, : ; There are over 100 bobkbinderies In New
York, i and nearly > half the number are
equipped with appliances for the highest class
of; work. The capacity of â  these i binderies Vis
wonderful. ,; There " is - an : Instance â¢ on *J record
where a New York publishing-houseâ and not
the ' largestâ took ;an ! order on 'r Monday lor a
cloth-covered 12mo volume of ; 350 pages and
actually shipped 2000 copies of the book on
the following Wednesday. The type ;. was i set
(by machinery) for the entiro 350 pages before
work stopped â¢â ! Monday -â , night. ft Electrotype
plates were made so rapidly that on Tuesday
morning several printing presses were set in
motion. In the meantime covers were being
made in the bindery and by Wednesday morn-
Ing the binders had the book in hand. Two
thousand volumes were completed
WILLIAM JOSEPH YEOMAN.
and the edition of 10,000 was entirely out of
the way bjfore Saturday night. While the
type-setting and presswork seem remarkable,
the craftsmen understand that the bindery is
entitled to the greatest praise.
The largest bindery here has a capacity of
10,000 books per day. When an establish
ment reaches a production of 1000 or more
books per day it means that the folding and
sewing are done entirely by machinery. It is
possible to attain any speed that may be de
sired in the production ot books whore a plain
paper cover is calleJ for. Cloth covering comes
next. In the manipulation of leather bind
ing more time is required. For the better
class of library books it is seldom k question
of speed, but always one of skilled workman
ship, good material and careful handling in
all departments.
Cloth binding is a modern product. It was
made necessary by the growing demand for
medium-priced booksâ something better than
paper but less expensive than leather. The
use of cloth admits of speed and places a very
serviceable quality of book within the reach
of persons oi moderate means.
The extensive use of machinery in the book
binding of the present day : involves capital,
whereas under the old method of handwork
the outlay in this department of '. bookmaking
was trifling compared to the cost of type and
printing machinery.
It takes a good many thousand- dollars to fit
up a bindery in these times, and the old
fashioned workman, though "i possessed of
amazing skill, is driven out by houses .Which
are competing for business., Perhaps it would
be , more accurate to \ say .- that he is driven to
take shelter in the big concerns which have
the means to add high-priced mechanical ap
pliances to his talent. â¢ â  .
. The New York publishers , say that the im
portation of books is declining year by year.
It is not difficult to see that it will cease,
practically speaking, in the near future. Po
litical .economists : in this country, the ' book
men say, must find immense satisfaction in
the fact which has been demonstrated that
the binderies of ? the Uultea ;' States :â ' already
have the capacity to produce all the books
that are required on this continent.
NOVELISTS' CHARACTERS. !
The trouble that novelists have with the
proper names of their characters is aptly
illustrated by a story of Hall Came when at
work on "The Christian", (Appleton's). ' While
visiting the .'country ; home: of his 1 publisher
he I made a 4 call /at â !''. ex- President . Cleve
land's cottage, ; â not . far from which .is 'a
small buryiug-ground 7 of v the colonial . days.
. Cai went ; in Â»' for the ; purpose of seeing if
he could not : find a name suitable for the
hero of ' his new book, which was In an ad
vanced ;; stage, but } the leading character
of I which M: had not * been ; christened. :. On i a
dilapidated ~ : tombstone ;, he 'â¢ found the name
â¢/Storm,'", which he â¢ remembered having once
before i seen in an English graveyard, and
instantly the hero was named ;â¢,' John Storm."
The' story has a sequel which is almost too
Realistic to be other than apocryphal, but, as It
is told, a few days after Cameâ  ; had settled 'on
j the name he was in Hamilton] Canada, when
the door ol the carriage In which he was seated
was abruptly opened by a stalwart man, who,
seeing fi he bad 1 made a mistake, closed it
with a bang.-? "By an uncontrollable impulse"
Came ; : asked his f name, and i was < promptly
told "John Storm." ; 5; Whether tne ) story be
true or false does not matter much, but if jj the
former, Cnine is not the only novelist who had
the good or * ill â¢ fortune, as the event proved
of meeting in the flesh people whose names he
had utilized â - without ? perhaps the faintest
knowledge of their existence.' 5 Dickens } took
no end ** of * pains J in" the ' selection of ) his
names, endeavoring * not â â  only-, to r. ; secure
such names 'as exactly }fl ted the > characters
he ; had sketched, but ai&o to J choose 'i those
which f? had no J. living J representative/I. ;a In
spite of i his caution, however, 1 ! he was ) occa
sionally taken to *; task .H6r t what the owner
of ; the name regarded jas an unwarrantable
liberty with his cognomen: >; Not long after the
appearance "of "'Nicholas J Nlckleby,*/ i a family
of Nicklebys was discovered in London, and a
Lis iv moaiiis tei Â» s ea tleaÂ»a bjr tae aÂ«ae ox
Skweers wrote to the novelist from a country
district of England to protest against the use
of his name, which he had recognized even in
the disguised spelling of the story-teller. So
odd were some of the names fitted by Dickens
to his creations, that |It has frequently j been
supposed the names as much as the characters
were of his own devising. s Sometimes: they
were, but after a number of very respectable
Chuzzlewits . rose up in wrath at their name
being taken in vain the creation theory was
practically- abandoned. To -'a ; far. greater cx
i ten ; than among.; the . English writers, 4 . the
French novelists and dramatists are compelled
to manufacture their names, for the French
laws strictly forbid the employment, either on
stage or in story, of the name of a living indi
vidual who objects to its use in that way. The
French author jis ; therefore i obliged ; in ~i self
defense to rely on his | imagination, and even
when doing so he runs the risk of getting into
trouble, for only a few years ago a French play,
in which the leading character was a convict
who was designated by his prison number, fell
under J the ban of â  the censor, who compelled
the author and manager to change the number
of the felon, because an ex-convict, who while
serving his term had been known by that num
ber, objected to its use as. personally offensive
to . himself. This may seem like ' straining . a
point, but in France law is law,* and even an
ex-convict has rights which novelists and
dramatists are bound to respect The fathers
of dramatic composition could bring public
men on the stage by name and satirize their
actions, mimic â  their language and even copy
th 'ir '-i peculiarities of ' countenance, attitude
and gait, but the sons must be careful. . Bal
zac . manufactured the "â  greater part of : bis
names, but | even I that fact did not save him
from trouble, and Ihe was jon j more j than one
occasion annoyed by finding that .he had
unwittingly made a name and created a char
acter, both of which fitted, as though made to
order, some irascible lellow-Gaul. The Chuz
zlewits and | the Nicklebys and the Fagans of
I London relished no more than the C lcons of
Athens the use of their names by imaginative
writers, and it is quite likely that after Came
hears from the Storm family he will wish he
had : gone i further back ' into antiquity for a
name to bestow on his hero. .

MARK TWAIN'S EARLY LIFE.
Amid surroundings, says Charles Miner
Thompson in his article on Mark Twain in the
April Atlantic, which were curiously Ameri
can, if not especially apt to nourish literary",
genius, Mark Twain, "a Kood-hearted boy," says
his mother, but one who, although "a great
boy for history," could never be persuaded to
go ;to school, bpen t { a boyhood which, it ap
pears, - was ', "a series : of . mischievous adven
ture," Wliuu ac wm 12 jews eia hji taiaec
died and the circumstances of his mother were
such that he had to go to work as printer's ap
prentice in the office of the Hannibal Weekly
Courier. "I can see," he said once at a
printers' banquet in New York, "that print
ing office of prehistoric times yet, with its
horse bills on the walls; its 'd' boxes clogged
with tallow, because we always stood the
candle in the 'k' box nights; its towel, which
was never considered soiled until it could
standalone." For three years i.c worked in
this delectable establishment, and then, at
the ; age â¢ of ; 15, ran away from home ap
parently without a penny of money: Until he
was 20 or thereabouts . he - seemed to have
wandered through the eastern half of the
country as 'a* tramp printer. . Then, suddenly
changing S his vocation, he became â a * pilot
on- the :"â : Mississippi > River. Five years
later, the railroads and â  the \ Civil : War
having made piloting an . impossible oc
cupation, he enlisted as a 'three months'
volunteer >in the : Confederate ;' army, ; and
was captured, but \ succeeded . in ' >. escaping
from : the tobacco warehouse <; in : St. Louis,
where he was . held \ prisoner. He fled to the
West, the West of i Bret HaTte, swarming with
adventurers, with whom | the , fashionable or
naments of the day were "an eight-inch re
volver, an Arkansas toothpick and jack
boots." As miner, journalist and lecturer he
led a rough and -impecunious life in Nevada i
and California, until in 1867 he published his
first . story, . "The ; Jumping Frog of Cala
veras," and sailed by way of Panama
to r New York. A r little later he found
the ;* opportunity ;to go to .Europe and
the Holy Land as a newspaper correspondent,
and so obtained the material for his "Inno
cents Abroad." After many difficulties 4 and
with much',- misgiving, the; book was : finally
published. The next morning Mark Twain,
then 34 years old, awoke like Byron 'to find
himseli famous. '^:^ : . - .'

The Century is about to print a new short
serial story by Mary Hartwell Catherwood,
"The Days of Jeanne d'Arc," the result of a
very careful study of the history of the maiden
warrior of France, and of Â» pilgrimage to the
places she made famous. The story has been
in the bands of the editors of the Century for
some time, but its publication wns delayed on
account of the recent appearance of Mark
Twain's novel on the same subject in Harper's
Magazine. Mrs. Catherwood is said to treat
Joan of Arc in a fresh way, and the story is
thought to be her very best work. In the
April Century, which contains the first chap
ters, will appear two new portraits of Joan of
Arc, which have been discovered recently in
Alsace.
Ex-President Hnrrison, whose articles in the
Ladies' Home Journal are creating such wide
spread interest, will write about "The Social
Life of the President" in the April issue of
that magazine. The ex-President will tell of
the dinners, receptions, etc., mat are given by
the chief executive and detail the great social
demands made upon him. He also gives a
peep into the White House dining-room Â«nd
silver closet and notes the beauty oi the ter
vice used for state dinners, which was bought
at second hand. It is said that he also pays
heed to the oft-repeated question, "How much
of his salary can a President lay aside?"
A new edition of Lever's novels is an
nounced. During nis last visit to England,
says the Athenaeum, the author intended to
revise his novels, with the aid of his daughter,
Mrs. Neville, but the task was interrupted by
his death. The text throughout is now being
most carefully seen to. The publishers have
secured the original b'CO plates etched b/
"P:>iz" and George Cruik>hank for the first
edition. In addition several of the later
volumes are illustrated with wood engraving!
by Luke Flldis and other ar.istg, all of which
will be iucluded in this edition. A few of the
thirty-six volumes were originally published
without illustrations nml for these arrange
ments have been m.icte under which Gordon
Browne will contribute a series of drawings.
The interesiing prefaces written by Lever
snortly before his death will be included. The
Messrs. Constable of Edinburgh have had a
bold, clear type specially cast lur the work.
The following books are to be published by
the Centnry Company early in April: "Prison
ers of Conscience," by Amelia E. Barr, to
which the author has added very considerably
since its appearance as a short serial In the
Century Magazine; "The Btand-by," a novel
of the day, by Edmund P. Dole of Hawaii;
"One Man Who Was Content" and other
stories, by Mrs. Schuyler Van ttensselaer; "Na
ture In a City Yard," by Charles M. Skinner, a
book which is said to be "one that Thoreau
might have written if transported from
Waulen Pond to the marie soil of a Brooklyn
back yard"; "For the Country," a collection of
poems by Richard Watson Gilder on patriotic
subjects, voicing the soldier sentiment since
the war and upholding the idea of good citi.

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
Â§T WOULD be difficult to explain why
the spring fashions have been so late
in making their advent this season,
but even now the great dressmakers are
slow in issuing their hats. At first this
delay caused many of the lessor lumin
ar.es to pause in anxious anticipation of
great changes, but after all no great novel
lies are to be introduced in the cut of our
frocks, only modifications of what we
have already. However, although our
skirts are some of them to remain plain,
or ornamented cnlv with flat trimming
when tue fabric used is sufficiently heavy,
ruches, flounces or plisses appearing only
in mulls, organdies, etc, our bodices are
to be simply marvels of richness,
and the art of making these shirred,
tucked and trimmed affairs successfully is
entirely beyond the powers of ;the ordi
nary dressmaker. They are to fit closely
in the back and round the waist, and are
made round or with a slisrnt point on the
shoulders, and in front they are full and
fussy. Sleeves are to be long and plain,
with a very moderate bouffant at the top,
which falls softly on the upper part of the
arm, or a small crosaway flounce or some

In .Men's Siloes Three .New Styles Will Be Seen This Season
In conformity with the comfortable
suits of Bcotch tweed, loose-woven home-
spun and other rough material, the well-
to-do man will this season wear shoes
whose shapes will bring comfort to him,
although they will not in tbemselvos be
remarkable for tneir symmetry.
There will be three styles of toe in
Toque for every-day wear and any one of
toe m will be eminently proper with any
of the correct styles of every-day suits de-
scribed in the last issue of The Stjnday
Caxl. The three styles to be worn will be
'â¢the coin," "the bulldog" and "the me-
dium square." These will lead the fash-
ion, but, of course, the square box toe will
be allowable this season, as it has in oth-
ers, for elderly men and any one else who
conscientiously believes that a square-
toed shoe Is necessary to his comfort.
There are so many sufferers from corns
in this world that man has become amia-
ble in regard to the shape of the boots his

ornament or motif.
Gray ana red are enjoying a great vogue
in Paris, and embroideries and trimmings
are to be had in the most gorgeous and
exquisite designs imaginable.
Short capes or pelerines and small
dressy scarfs are being shown by the
ultra-exclusive bouses, and the newest,
most fashionable cloth for the"handsomest
dresses is satin cloth, which is also al
luded to as satin de lain. It is a solid,
soft, shining fabric.
.Hats and Bonnets.
I presume we have alt been to &ix open
ings at least recently, but fÂ°w of us have
brought away any very general ideas as
to what the fashions are to be for the
coming months, and the reason is easily
explained. There are ?o many styles that
as yet we cannot arrive at any positive
conclusions. Tnat toques and turbans
will be in evidence is an assured fact,
and much red straw as well as cerise is
being employed. Such hats are most
effective when trimmed with black tulle
and shaded geraniums. Toques are to
have crowns in proportion, and hats are
[ neighbor wears, although he may be se-
j vere in his strictures of the same neighbor
if he should appear at his club or else-
where in a coat of unfashionable cut.
And so into one year and out another, in
season and out of season, the square-toed
shoe is permissible, in ail styles of uppers
and colors, forouting wear or for full dress.
But "the coin" will undoubtedly be the
popular shoe. It derives its name from
the fact that in its widths it is rounded off
like the semicircle of one of Uncle Saru's
coin?. There are "10-cent coins," "two-
bit coins" and "four-bit coins," accord-
ing to the designations given the different
widths in this style of shoe. No matter
what the width of the toe, however, it is
rounded off in the shape of a piece of
money, and the uncomfurtable-looking
"toothpick" will not be iv vogue this
season.
"The bulldog" was probably so named
on account of its ugliness. Its stanches t

being shown with smaller brims. Dressy
toques come in niou- seline de soie. These
are tne latest, but tulle and lace are like
wise used. Some almost as smart are
covered with very small flowers, for
example, a "geranium toque, with the
varied shades of red or pink, or mingled
varieties, witb the left side smartly
aigretted, would always be a 'perfect
love.' There are violets, cyclamens, but
ton roses and forget-me-nots to choose
from, with their beautiful foliage, which,
if nature makes unweildy, an interposes
and fits v for the occasion."
Indeed our headgear is daring in con
ception and delightful in form, color and
texture; but no one who is au fuit pre
tends that "the ultra-smart" Paris hat has
reached onr shores, for we all Know, if we
are posted on Paris customs, that the
choicest models â the real inspirations â
are reserved for the brilliant assemblages
at the spring races â at Chantilly, at
Auteuil and Longchamps. Where, except
at the Grand Prix de Paris, can such
a gathering of exquisitely dressed women
be seen the world over? The English
Derby is a fine sight, but it is quite
patrons cannot ascribe to it any degree of
beauty as far as symmetry of outline
goes, but it has an appearance of comfort
and solidity about it that commends it.
It is especially adapted to rough wear.
The "square-toe medium" is cut on the
same order as "the coin," except that
the toe of the shoe, instead of being
rounded off, is cut square across.
These shoes will be worn In ox blood,
wine and chocolate colors principally,
although, as in the case of the broad
square toe, there will be a demand for the
ever dressy black. They will all be
laced. But few low-cut shoes art* worn in
San Francisco, but any one who wishes to
wear a low-cut shoe in accordance with
the styles mentioned can do so with per-
fect equanimity, for such shoes will be
worn in the East.
The proper thing for full dress will be a
"coin" or "medium square toe" shoe, but-
toned or made in gaiter fashion.
eclipsed by the finer one across the chan
nel.
Among the millinery triumphs just re
ported note a hat of vegetable fiber, dyed
a rich purple, trimmed with hundreds of
purple violets that nestle in the tucked
purple chiffon. Another delightfully be
coming to a piquant oval face is composed
entirely of cream lace and has three
broad brims, one above the other, bound
with black velvet, and over the left side
droops a long, biack plume, but on the
right is a huge biactc osprey standing
erect.
Truly worthy of an archly beautiful
face is an immense poke bonnet of Tuscan
straw, with rosettes and striugsof wnite
moire and a panocbe of white ostrich
plumes, and a draped curtain of point
d'Alencon finishes the left side of the
brim.
In tbe front of this most picturesque
poke is a bunch of pale pink and blush
roses on one side and a trio of tiny white
tips on the other â a charming reproduc
tion of the early Victorian fashion.
Quite stunning is a Parisian confection
of black drawn net, which has the brim
In gloves for men the old reliable
"Dent," with a heavy piquet stitch, in
red, tan or brown, will be the correct
thing. A dogskin, with one clasp, should
be worn for driving or bicycling.
The cycling suits which Dame Fashion
has decreed that devotees of the wheel
who respect her dictates shall wear this
season are handsomer than anything the
factors have made heretofore for a bi-
cyclist's dress. The suit should be made
either of a cheviot, Irish homespun or
a tweed, in solid colors or in fancy plaids
with overchecks. One of the prettiest
suis made for a San Francisco rider this
season is of herringbone tweed, which
makes up for this dress beautifully.
To be strictly correct the coat of the
cycling Buit should be cut like the ordi-
nary four-button cutaway sack, with four
orthree outside pockets, with pointed or
rounded revers. If a waistcoat is wornâ
and that woald be better form- -it should

almost concealed by a wreath of very
beautiful shaded pansies. Toward tbe
front is a good-sized wing-shaped bow of
open gold embroidery on invisible black
net. These wings are mixed up in a large
bow of grenadine gauze shaded from
mauvre to violet.
Most of us would also admire a hat,
likewise of tulle, at the back of which is a
sort of crested diadem of black gauze
striped with tiny steel spangles. On each
side of the brim is a smaller crest of the
same. Tbe middle or crown h made of two
large flat roses, and in front is an aigrette
of two roses with their leaves.
A Rembrandt of moderate size is in
black and white, tbe brim being of black
lace over white lace. The brim is turned
up at the left side, and under this, repos
ing on the hair, is quite a lar ge cluster of
tbe most exquisite roses, and at the back,
on tbe outside, are two large loops of the
combined laces, and at the right side is a
handsome cluster of fine black tips; "the
crown is like a small beret of back gauze,
with a stripe of bright straw." This latter
is a decided novelty.
The regular sailor shapes are shown in
Panama straws, much beautified. 1 saw
one last week which had standing at
either sMe, rather toward the front,
bunches of shaded Lady Washington gera
niums, in tones of red. A dark-green rib
bon encircled the brim; price $18, quite an
absurd figure. Another in place of tbe
geraniums had bunches of cherries and
currants and a green ribbon. It was
equally expensive.
Such hats are really intended for school
girls, although young women look well in
them. A grassy green chapeau encircled
with some black crinkly chiffon had two
sprightly tips with two rath-r handsome
jeweled pins at the base. Price $25.
I do not grudge $20 for a French summer
hat, but $15 is quite sufficient to give for a
pretty tasteful little affair for every-day
wear, unless one has a very ample allow
ance.
A queer turban, undoubtedly from
Paris direct, is of tomato red chiffon on
which are sewn at intervals o/ about
every three inches narrow rows of black
velvet. It looks as though a great circu
lar piece of the stuff had been so treated
wbich had been then sewn around a cir
cular frame after which it had been caueht
down here and there so as to hold it in
place. Â«
If I wished such a turban I should take
another look at the costly importation
and experiment, as the best authorities
declare that these turbans can readily
be made by any woman in the least clever
about hats.
Embroidered crowns and brims will be
in vogue; most of them will be done in
jet and steel. Some hats of silk-edged
grenadine have brim, lined ueneath
with rufflings of tulle.
Vivid colors predominate, as not only
cerise and red but violet, blue and scarlet
are being tried on the public. However,
there is no doubt but that more subdued
tones will prevail later.
I have just received news concerning
the costumes and hats worn on the opening
day of the Auteuil races. It is but a crumb
be double-breasted and made of the same
material as the coat and the knickerbock-
ers. The latter should be loosely fitting
to the knee, but not baggy. The legs
should end with a stiff box-cloth band of
either two, three or- four buttons.
Golf stockings will still be allowable,
but the best-dressed bicyclists will not
wear the horrible abominations this sea-
son. Piain ribbed hose in solid colors
will be worn by those riders who hearken
to fashion's voice, and the knickerbockers
will be buttoned over them. A well-fittinr
shoe of fashionable cut and in any of the
fashionable colors should be worn. The
cap should be made of the same material
as the suit. A Madras shirt and a turned-
down white coliar, with link cuffs to
match the shirt, and a club tie should
complete the attire. ->.
This dress will prove to be much more
pleasing than tne blousy suits that cyclists
have heretofore worn.
of information. The correspondent says: "I
noticed many costumes in which all the
colors of the rainbow seemed to have given
themselves rendezvous, with hatt to
match."
The new ribbons that will figure in
many a chapean are very like silken
gauze and many varieties in grass linen
effects are admired, especially those
adorned with Scotch plaids on delicately
tinted grounds. These have a dominate
note of color and some are scattered over
with polka dots or sprays of minute
flowers. Such ribbons have a delightful
summer air about them, bat naturally
they can never take the place of the silk
ones, and it is evident that moire ribbons
are to continue in nigh favor and they
will be the ones used on all the smartest
hats and gowns until the fall.
I advise you all to go to the openings
that will be held beiore long, as some
very choice hats will be received, I have
not the least doubt, and then even the
most conservative of us will joyfully part
with a goodly pile of ducats if tempted by
a lovely chic bit of a hat.
Papasois.
This season we may chronicle the ad
vent of at least half a dozen chic and
dainty parasols. Several of them are de
lightfully odd, but some attract on ac
count of their e'egant simplicity, and it
is noted that again, during the spring and
' summer, black and white is to be tne most
popular combination.
I have just read a description of the
novel "Sunburst Parasols," which I quote
for your benefit. They are "made of ac
cordion pleated silk or satin, frequently
covered with white accordion pleated
tulle. A delicate gray taffeta silk has an
artistic bunch of roses and finished with
a large bow of taffeta ribbon profusely or
namented with rosebuds. The most dainty
parasols are of white silk with accordion
pleated chiffon in billowy cloud effect"
Very costly and beautiful is a parasol of
the richest white silk, over which are ap
plied scattered bunches of black lace. A

miles off the west coast of Africa, where
the Atlantic depths are a storehouse for
the surplus heat of summer, the Peak of
Teneriffe pierces the atmosphere at a
height of 12,198 feet.
SThis natural vantage ground was chosen
in 1856 by Professor Piazzi Emyth, the
late Astronomer Royal of Scotland, for

arrange for numerous imall channels di
verging from the main canal, which might
take their departure at exactly opposite
sides of the main waterway and bo appear
as crossing the main canal at angles de
termined by the object to be accom
plished. When an irrigating system like
this was completed it would be found,
naturally enough, that during the sum
mer, or growine season, the land border
ing the canals would become verdan^ and
where an intersection of one or more
canals occurred there would be formed at
sucb places oases. There would be
nothing extraordinary in the construc
tion of such A system nor in its effects
upon the hitherto desert area in the mat
ter of changing the appearance of tile sur
face by reason of vegetable growths; the
labor and its results would be perfectly
natural.
If the readers of The Call will take the
trouble to look at the zenith about 8 or 9
o'clock on a clear nigbt just now, they
will perceive a reddish looking star, some
what larger than those surrounding it,
shining with a brilliant light. The star is
the planet Mars, and its surface when
viewed through a large telescope exhibits
precisely what would be seen by an ob
server looking from a great distance at the
desert of Sahara, were that desert invested

Beiore many years the scientific world
save practical recognition to the value of
this experiment, and as early as 1872 Pro
fessor Davidson took observations in the
Sierras and Professor Young in the Kocky
Mountains for a comparison of high and
low altitudes in the Western States.
While the selected stations in both cases
showed increased transparency with an
increase of altitude, it was more frequently
combined with steadiness in the Sierra
Mountains. This difference was of hiph
importance, as clear, thin air increases
the brightness of a heavenly body two
fold or more, but as steadiness is neces
sary for true vision a brilliant distortion
is misleading. The observations of Pro
fessor Holden in 1873 and afterward also
showed that the desirable combination is
not frequently found at the high altitudes
of Colorado, and Dr. Henry Draper's ac
count of the Utah mountains confirms the
testimony in favor of the westerly range.
The observatories that were built within
tee last twenty year?, including the Lick,
have reaped vhe benefit of these early in
vestigations, and the most daring climbs
of scientific star-gazing, which have
to discuss the astronomical elements of
Mars. That particular knowledge 13 not
essential to the purpose of the present
article, and, besides, the information has
been repeatedly set fortn before the read
ing public.
Within the past few years a great deal
of intelligent attention has been bestowed
upon the ruflay planet, and especial no
tice taken, under the most favorable op
portunities of proximity and instrumental
aid, of the peculiar markings upon its sur
face. One hundred and thirty years ago Â«
Huygnens, a noted astronomer of his time, i
observed these strange lines, but owing
to the crudeness of the telescopes at that
time be was unable to determine their j
character. His discovery, however, awak- !
ened great interest, and from mat time j
until now the investigation of the wonder- i
ful markings has been conducted along
scientific lines by the most competent ob
servers of the world. Schiaparelli an
nounced in 1877 that the surface of Mars j
was furrowed by what he then termed \
"canals," and at once arose a heated argu
mem as to whether Schiaparelii was to
be believed or not. Observers who had
not seen the lines declared that they could '
not possibly txtst, but this class was j
speedily silenced by the fact that toe lines j
persisted in being seen by any one who '
possessed a telescope of sufficient power
and who chose to look for them.
Almost every year that has passed since
Bchlaparelli's announcement has wit
nessed improvements in telescopic art.
Instruments of better definition and more
'â¢far reaching" power have been devised,
with the result that to-day we have a map
of the surface of Mars which is actual y
more reliable than that we have of Africa.
The lines over the face or the planet are
there. They are on the planet'a surface,
and now the great problem is: What are
they? The majority of competent ob

ranked Mounts Etna, Whitney, Blanc,
Pikes Pealc and El Misti in the Andes
among the astronomical stations, may be
traced to their inflaenee.
The first named is a well-equipped ob
servatory since 1881, at an altitude of 9652
feet, not far below the great crater. On
tnis awe-inspiring ground where earth
tremblings, sulphurous smoke and sub
terranean illuminations are among the
probabilities, in addition to tho usual
mountain phenomena of wind and electric
storms, the serene lights of heaven are
studied during the favorable months from
July t.> October. The result Is that they
are occasionally seen with a clearness and
j steadiness unknown at Catania, the lower
I Sicilian station. The records of Tachini,
Langley, Hale and others show that some
times wuen the is!and is partly hidden in
obscuring haz9 definition is so good that
planetary detail can be studied with ad
vantage. Occasionally the smoke of the
volcano wreathes the scene and migratory
flocks of insects also intrude between the
observer and the o&iect of his attention.
In the same year that this scientific ven
ture was completed Dr. Langley selected
the lofty summit of Mount Whitney, 14,
--900 feet in height, for solar observations,
requiring a comparison of the heat re
ceived at high and low altitudes. Here
he found clearness, dryness and a violet
blue sky surpassing what he had seen in
other favored localities. Partly owing to
! servers assert that they are canals. But a
j canal implies water, and water implies an
I atmosphere. Here again arises a dispute
â  as to the physical condition of the Jlar
j tian surface. A spectroscopic study of
i Mars does not give support to the claim
I that Mars has an atmosphere, at least not
an atmosphere similar to onr own. On
the other hand very many astronomers of'
| world-vride celebrity as careful observers
j emphatically assert that they bays not
i only witnessed the formation of ice over
tho polar regions of Mars, and witnessed
its subsequent moltinp, but have also
seen clouus and mists pass over the face
ol" the planet; so that notwithstanding
the conclusions arrived at from the spec
troscpic observations made by some
astronomers it is very probable that Mars
has both water and atmosphere. The
spectroscope has been lamentably disap
pointing in the investigations of many
celestial bodies shining with reflected light,
such as the moon, comets and nebulae.
Professor Holden in 1888 announced
that the long, straight lines visible in
Mars were really canals. Flammarion,
the famous French astronomer, who has
devoted patient, unremitting attention to
Mars for the past dozen years, positively
states that the lines are channels of actual
water, but be does not assign to them an
artificial oriein. Latterly Percival Low
ell, who has been making a special study
of the physiography of the ruddy planet,
from his observatory in Arizona, states
that the markings are undoubtedly "lines
of irrigation" ; that is, they are water
channels, in which water flows during a
certain season, and from which canals di
verge. About some geographical features
of Mars astronomers are fairly well agreed,
though observations made at different
seasons of the planet give somewhat dif
ferent appearances.
Flammarion shows the northern and
his enthusiastic recommendation the
United States Government has reserved
from sale a larsre tract, including the sum
mit of Mount Whitney, which can thus be
devoted to scientific purposes when
needed.
As quiet air was but a secondary consid
eration in connection with his special re
searches, tests on this matter were few
and inconclusive, but the ever-present
dust particles were detected and the
smoke of an occasional forest fire also
soured beyond the summit.
The icy crest of Mont Blanc gleaming
in the rarefied air of the Alpine solitudes
was the next step in the ladder of ascend
ing science. Towering 15,780 feet above
sea level, the denser atmospheric strata
are unknown here except in the wildest
aerial tumults, and as we have heard iong
and often of Alpine climbers, it is rather
surprising that the star-gazer was not
heard of before 1890. However, the gen-
I eral tourist is not incumbered with the
care of instruments, and his task is done
when his footprints indent the summit
snow, while the work oi the astronomer
only then begins. In this year, the
i famous French scientist, M. Janssen,
| though advanced in age, and, through
i lameness, unable to travel as ordinary
climbers, took valuable solar "observations
on the summit, and planned the building
of a permanent observatory on the deso
; late peak. By tunneling, it was found
southern areas of water to be separated by a
single land contineD t, which continues v n
brotten around the planet save where it is
furrowed by "canals." The probable fact
is that the land surface of Mars is phe
nomenally flat and level, and that at cer
tain times during the vernal season the
low, level land is inundated by the water
resulting from the melting of the ice at
the poles. We speak of "land" and "seas"
on Mars when, in fact, we do not yet
know, except by inference drawn from
terrestrial phenomena, that our geograph
ical definition of observed appearances
on Mars is correct. The only positive faci
is that these enigmatical lines are on the
planet and are not an illusion. The largo
ones proceeding from the spot called LaKe
Niliacus have been seen in the places
they occupy for more than 100 years.
These markings cross the face of the
planet in long, regular lines. Some of
them are thousands of miles in length and
others bnt a few hundred. They vary much
in width, some appear to be fully 200 miles
wide, while others but 20, and are prob
ably much less. The width is measured
by the observer by means of an instru
ment called a micrometer, consisting of
parallel lines of spider-web placed in the
focus of the telescope. One or more of
the micrometer lines can be moved away
from or brought nearer to other fixed
lines, and the observer endeavors to so
adjust the micrometer line as to enclose
the image of the object he views between
two or rcore of the micrometer lines and
so roughly approximate the width of the
object by the proportion it bears to Ihe
known diameter of the planet. But if the
Martian markings are actual water canals,
then, if it should happen that a breeze
was blowing across the surface of the
canal at the time of the observation, the
waves of water formed by the wind would
reflect tho light at all sorts of angles and
consequently it would spread over the
held of view between the micrometer
lines to a far greater extent than it would
were it reflected from a perfectly placid
surface.
All observers agree in stating that Mars
exhibits at its poles certain areas that
change color from dark to white accord
ingly as the pole is presented to or away
from tne sun. Those polar spots have
been termed "icecaps," because they ex
hibit precisely the regular crtanse of ap
pearance which would be produced by the
formation and rneltines of the ice happen
ing at the polar regions of our own earth.
Now, while we cannot positively say that
these polar markings are actual icecaps,
yet every observed phenemenon at the
poles of Mars strengthens such conclu
sion. Accepting this deduction, we are
forced to acknowledge that there is water
on Mars, and consequently atmosphere.
The true scientist is always conserva
tive. He must be so; he could not be
otherwise, for the teachings of his entire
scientific experience is, that nothing is
more liable to mistake than is human
judgment. The natural consequence is
that when you ask the scientific man, is
Mars inhabited? he replies, |2 do not
know. Yet it is perfectly safe to say that
nine out of every ten men, whose opportu
nities for observing the planet Mars have
been ordinarily good ones, confidently be
lieve that the time will come when im
proved facilities will render it possible
and easy, not only to prove tue existence
of the Martian inhabitants, but to hold
satisfactory communication with tbeaa.

that tbe huge glacial formation which
caps it had 100 much depth to admit of an
earthy foundation, but sunk deep in the
icy mass which embanks it round, a aate
and solid structure was completed inde
pendently of rock or soil.
This success leads the zealous scientist
to suggest similar ventures in the eternal
snows of the Andes and the Himalayan
ranee as important to the progress of
meteorology and astronomy, but it was
not attained without hardship and dan
ger, in which sickness and death werÂ»
prominent. Moreover, summit glaciers
are not immovable, and on examination
two years after its completion the struc
ture was found to have been slightly dis
placed toward Chamounix. A sliding
foundation is suggestive, and Professor
Holden ominously remarks that the whole
history of the Mont Blanc station is not
yet written. lie also questions the wis
tiom of tlie undertaking, when eoual re
sults might be obtained with little danger
or difficulty on Pikes Peak or in the Sierra
range. Trans- Atlantic observers, however,
would hardly be content with a hi.'h level
(station so remote, especially as the Alpine
observations bo far as undertaken have
proved satisfactory. Grievous hardships
are endured and lives imperiled every
day for grosser gains, and the few ven
tures for science's sake probably only vary
without adding to toe disaster record.

American, is the business of preparing
arid polishing sea shells for j ornamental
purposes and for tourist sale a3 souvenirs.
The chief shell used for this ) purDose^ is
that of the Haliotis, called in Spanish the

rodii, the black abalone, the red abalone
or Haliotis rufescens and Haliotis splen
tleus, the last being the most beautiful of
the species, so beautiful that an enthusi
astic naturalist of this coast once called it
a "crystallized rainbow, rich in all the
tints of the spectrum."
These shells are not found on the At
lantic coast, but until recently they have
been abundant here and may be found
from the foot of the peninsula of Baja
California to Kamchatka. Their present
lack of abundance is due to the depletion
of their beds by Chinese fishermen. Ex
cepting those shells which are polished
and soid ou the coast to the curio hunters,
they are almost all shipped in their na
tive, unpolished state to China, where
they are used to make button?, jewelry,
and for inlaid work in wood surfaces.
The nacre which this fish deposits pro
duces the mother of pearl of commerce
and of the most beautiful variety. The
fish baa but one shell and crows to the
length of nine inches. Its back is quite
smooth, spire very short, aperture almost
as broad as the shell. Its outer angle is
perforated by a aeries of holes, rive
or six in Dumber, and through this

accessible slopes of the Alpine peak inward
for a re w miles and thence vertically 9100
feet to the summit for the purposes o.
travel. Should this colossal shaft be sue,
cassfully constructed the inroads of art,
science and pleasure will soon iender the
Mount Blanc of the past but a majestic
memory.
Pikes Peak, 14,147 feet above sea level,
was occupied for meteorological observa
tions from 1874 to 1888, in 1878 was tempo
rarily used as an ellipse station, was
tested for telescopic work by Professor
Pickeriug in 1887, and in 1893 was occupied
by Professors Hale and Keeler for solar
observations. The extreme clearness of
I the air was attested by all the experi-
nienters, but the de-urab.'e combination of
clearness and tranquillity was in general
j conspicuously absent.
Many valuable astronomical observa.
! tions can be carried on in defiance to a
quivering atmosphere, and as the summit
is accessible by railroad and the tempera
ture not too rigorous, this elevated point
{ invites consideration as a suitable site for
i a permanent high level station on the
I grounds of convenience. Apart from that

means of a strong central foot

gatherer has been caught in a dangerous
predicament through thrusting his hand
between the shell and the rock when the
foot is relaxed and having the thing close
on him and held thus against a rising
tide, only to be rescued by his com.
panions. In the interior center of the
shell is a rough and corrugated scar,
hiptaly iridescent, of a pearly greenishjbue.
The flesh of this fish is edible, but not
particularly palatable to the American.
The Chinese prizÃ it highly; they dry it
and ship it to China, where it finds a
ready sale. The Indians also like it, and
the old natives of California feasted upon
it with gusto; at many places along the
coast can be found large heaps of these
shells, partly decayed, yet still valuable for
making pearl powder for use in ornament
ing boxes and frames; these shell mounds
are remnants of Indian Haliotis fisheries
in the past.
The abalone export trade to China has
greatly decreased within the past few
years owing to the decline of the quantity
of tue fish through the excessive fisheries
of the Chinese. In 1883 there were exported
2,600,000 of shells and meats valued at $55,
--000. In 1892 this business had decreased to
404,547 pounds of dried meat worth 19351,
with no report made upon the shells. It is
probable that the business of catch
ing abalones for Chinese export has not
much farther to go before it will end.
There will always be sufficient of these
fish caught, however, to supply the Chi
gency of forest fires also interfere with the
continuance of clÂ»ar vision.
Excelsior Has been the motto of the
nineteenth century star-gazer. The Har
vard astronomers, e-ver in the van of
scientific research, have established posts
for the study o! climate from the Soutn
Pacific across the Andes to the valley of
the Amazon. Unawed by the sabHme
heights of volcanic El Misti or its smoke
wreath, like a hostile banner, a threat and
a warning, the summit was made tribu
tary to science in 1891. The giant cone
gradually slanting upward to 19,200 feet
above sea level was accessible the entire
route on muleback, though the surefooted
species never belore trod such elevated
ground. Here one-half the bullc of the
restless aerial ocean which baffles the best
efforts of the astronomer and of the opti
cian is beneath the observer; and what
great things might not be expected at
such a site if a calm reigned around and a
good telescope was ever in readiness to
take advantage of these exceptional con
ditions?
Meteorological instruments on El Misti
are visited every ten days; but a few oc
casional hours are not Â« true test of tnese
lofty peaks. Aerial currents and curva
tures of strata, facilitated by mountain
slopes, the haunting high winds, the
hardships, the dangers â especially that of
mountain sickness â the penalty of what
is styled diminished living or a temporary
waning of mental and physical efficiency,
and the enormous cost â these are the chief
objections against the establishment of
permanent stations at unusually high al
titudes. Professor Pickering: recommends
altitudes ranging from 4000 to 8000 feet in
tropical or subtropical regions and low
hiJls rising 200 or 300 feet above the sur
rounding plains. Professor Schaberle,
wbo nas also had personal experience of
high levels in the Andes, does not favor
them for permanent occupation.
In his entertaining volume on this sub
ject Professor Holden emphasizes the ad
vantage of the moderate altitude of
Mount Hamilton, where transparency and
good definition are often combined, and
where general observations of a high order
can be maintained.
Thus a counter current of opinion against
the loftiest peaks seems to nave set in.
As there is at present no known strong
hold of transparency and steadiness of
the tirst class, at least one high crest
frowning down upon the lower air and its
dense turbulence should be given a fair
and a full trial.
A road to the summit, a substantial
building and constant relays of observers
habituated to high altitudes would gain
for science the choicest possibilities of the
â¢elected site; and even if those occurred
but one day in the year the price would
not be exorbitant when the rate of ex
penditure in other directions, both by
Governments and by individuals, is con
sidered. Rose O'Halloran.

selves living principally upon the meats
the shells contain.
Bat perhaps the most beautiful small
shell of the coast is the purple olive,
Oltvelia bipiirata, of which the Chinese
make much use. It has a bluish-white,
poiished surface and purple mouth. The
spire is short, with a distinct spiral groove
separating the whorls. The inner wall of
the aperture is marked by a bulge of
enamel above and two email folds be
neath, which give the shell its name.
Great be. is of these shells, all living, are to
be found at various points on the coast if
they are searched for just below the sur
face of (he sand at low tile. They are
active little burrowers and throw up little
ridges of sand as they move.
The gasteropoda also furnish the Chinese
with many of their curiously colored
shells. These are all snail or slug like in
shape and are very abundant. All of the
shells are carefully cleaned and polished,
but not boiled. Where the meat is large
enough to make a morsel the Celestial re
tains it fcr food. It is a small matter to
him that the flesh is not ordinarily edible.
Tne Chinese will generally eat anything
that comes out of the water, and thoto
who do the fishing live on some kinds of
fish which the American would consider
garbage.
The Chinese do not confine their prod
ucts to their own sales; they supply
curio stores, and quantities of their
poiished and curiously arranged shells of
the Pacific are shipped East and there
often sold for "fancy" prices.

Name of Poppy.
Escbscholtzia is the botanical name
given long ago to the California poppy.
Amapola and Copa de Oro are other and
prettier names which have been bestowed
upon this brilliant favorite.
My Poppies.
The first popptes I bad this spring came
from the beautiful Piedmont bills, back of
Oakland.
They were of an unusually rich deep
orange color. As they weru picked in the
early morning some of ti era were still
wearing their little peaked nightcaps,
and I thought it would be fun to closely
watch one and see just how it came off,
and now I've got a secret to tell you.
There are fairies sleeping down deep
in those golden cups. They sleep all cud
dled up through the cold night, but when
the warm sun shines it awasens them,
and they lone to get out, so they push,
and they push, until the green caps poD
off.
POPPY GIRLS.
If you don't believe it jast watch one of
these oueer little poppy caps some time as
it slowly moves up to the top of the
flower and then tumbles to the floor.
At night my poppies wrapped them
selves up tight in their satiny blankets
and went to sleep, with the exception of
one saucy fellow who blinked and winked
at the bright lights and stayed awake all
night
The next morning when his companions
awoke fresh and beautiful after their rest
he looked as faded and weary as a person
does who h as stayed out too late at night.
They were very pretty for se veral days
and were much admired, but. when they
began to lose their golden petals and look
ragged, mamma said, "Now we must
throw the poppies away: we don't want
them around any longer."
I thought that's just tbe way it often is
with people. While they have money and
can dress well they have many friends,
but if they lose their gold and appear
shabbily dressed they are soon cast Â«Â«ide.

Its Blooming Times
and Places.
It is generally supposed that the poppy's
satiny flame-colored blossoms glitter and
glow under California's skies alone, but in
truth it has spread its "cloth of gold" over
many parts of Oregon. "Washington, Ne
vada, Arizona and New Mexico, while on
the little island of Santa Catalina it
flaunts its very gayest and most gorgeous
blooms.
The California poppy blooms from early
springtime till late in the fall, but varies
much in both size and color with the
seasons.
At first it blooms freely, its great deep
cups shining like molten gold; then, as
the year wanes, it climbs the mountain
sides, as if following the sun, and the
cups, held up by the slender stems for
warmth and light, are very small and of a
pale, sickly yellow.

Hid a sunbeam in her heart,
And with all her care forgotten

Finally they grew tired and turned
toward home. As Charley reached the
gate a bright idea struck him, and he hur
ried into tbe bouse and up the stairs into
tbe nursery. He immediately began to
undress his sister's lovely big doll, and
soon had Fido arrayed in the garments.
Next he took his sister's little music-box
in his hand, and picking up Fido in his
arms ran quickly out of the bouse and
down the street toward town. On reach
ing a corner where a great many people
passed to and fro during that hour of day
he stopped and wound up tbe box.
As soon as Mdo beard the familiar
notes, for Charley often had had him per
form to music he commenced to dance *
He looked so comical that every one
who was passing slopped and smiled.
When the box ran down Charley gave
Fido 'he dolly's hat and tbe cute little
doggie walked around on his hind legs,
holding the nat out before him just as he
had seen tbe monkey do.
Charley enjoyed the fun as much as the
passers-by, and when some of them who
knew the little boy's parents actually
dropped a few nickels into tbe hat the
little fellow was so tickled that he jumped
for joy and almost let the music-box fall
as he went to clap bis bands.
Ail at om;e he heard a voice saying in a
sad tone, "Why, Charley!"
He looked up quickly and there was his
own dear mamma, surprised and shocked
to see her son so far away from home,
with FUo dragging sister Lucy's fine
dolly clothes in the dust.
The boy dropped his eyes, and going
slowly up to her slipped his little hand in
hers and started for home, poor Fido
walking bthind with a very weary look,
seeming to know that be too had been
naughty.
Charley and his mamma bad a good
Jong tallc and then Charley understood
why it was wrong for.him to act so; after
asking his mother's forgiveness, he went
to make his peace with his siser Lucy.
His mamma was pnzzled as to what to
do with the money Charley and Firio had
collected, six nickels in all. Of course
she could not return it, for she did not
know just who had given it. So she called
her little boy and told him to decide,
wriich he did by saying "why, of course,
mamma, that's to buy Lucy's dollie a new
dress, for the one Fido and I spoiled!"

California Poppy.
Beautiful poppy
With golden hue,
Roots deep in the ground
Where gold was found,
That lured the pioneer to roam
Far away from his childhood's home,
Which we his grandchildren enjoy
In happiness without alloy;
We roam the hills and valleys green
Gathering flowers that strew the scene,
Fair emblems of our Golden State,
That is so dear and grand and great;
And with a happy thankful heart
We praise our Maker for the part
He gives us in this garden grand,
To gather o'er this matchless land
Our waving golden poppy.

our State Flower.
The winter sun is fading
Into warmer rays of spring;
The buds of flowers are bursting,
' While birds their love songs sing.
Then up from mother earth,
In this favored Golden West,
A flower comes peeping forth
A BOUQUET OF WILD CALIFORNIA POPPIES.
Which we prize above the rest;
And as it liiLs its golden head
From out its feathery leaves.
Behold! the very land o'erspread
With our California popples.
On the tops of lofty mountains,
In the cool aud shady ilell,
You can find the yellow blossoms
Of this flower we love so well.
Where'er you ronm, my little Iriends,
Whate'er may be your fate,
Remember these goid-hued poppies
Are embU-imuie of our Stat?.

Dear Editor: Last week it snowed nere real
hard and I did wish some of the City members
could hare been here. The main street in
this town is vory steep, and of course makes a
fine sled track, and everybody, big and little,
were out with lurgc sleds, small sleds and all
kinds of sleds, shooting down the hill and
haying a graud time.
One night the track was allowed to freeze
and the first ones to try it next morning were
two young men. There is a precipice at the
foot of the street, and to prevent accidents to
team* a fence is built across. The morning of
vhlch I speak the track was as smooth as
glass Â«nd the young men's sled shot over the
surfftcc at such a hieh rate of speed, increas
ing all i lie lime, that they were unable to con
trol it, and it deshed over the ferce, breaking
it, and over the precipice all went. Fortu
nately neither was hurt, with the exception ot
a bnd fright, a broken sled and a few scratches
wnrJ bruises.
As you asked us to contribute so mething
about California' flower I shall write a little
about the mountain poppy. In the first place
it is of : a much lighter color than" the valley
variety and j appears later and lasts a much
shorter time. -1 think It is a very appropriate
State ; emblem, for it is found in vail parts of
California. 'I think that nature painted the
poppy golden as a hint :to man tnat the moat
precious of , all metals â â , lies ; beneath. I close

of C. R. C. and with a quotation about the
poppy by Helen Hunt Jackson: ;
Along Anaconda's hills the shimmering heat
- - Bathes ail the fields of wheat until they glow,
The poppies, lithe and fleet, '
â Sway, like fiery torcbmeD, to and fro.
The farmer does not know thai they are there;
" He walks with heavy feet, -
Counting the heads of autumn's gain-
While Iâ l smile to think that days remain

r^O> T DON, Esq., March 7.â My friend,
U~Â£ Miss Gray, takes life very seriously.
I yq/f She has not as yet come to that stage
).\ her travels when sightseeing is privately
pronounced a bore. She is still eager to
"do" everythingâ not once, but two or
three times. She is quite wonderful. Her
interests are practically unlimited. She
is always ready to go to the Tower or the
Hall of Records or to Mme. Tussaud's or
to Windsor or to picture exhibitions or
to aog shows or- teas. She Is very thor
ough and is always anxious to have im
pressions and to have them quite clearly.
Sbe goes about with her eyes very wide
open, and a little frown of anxiety and
earnestness between them. She would
not for the world be confused with those
Vulgar tourists who rush about the Conti
nent and see everything from Amsterdam
to Athens in three weeks.
She has seen everything in London in
the way of churches and exhibitions of
pictures add antiquities. Now she has
turned her bright attention to London
Life witb a very large letter. She is quite
sincere in her disinterested desire to see it
from every side, at no matter what per
sonal sacrifice. The West End she has
exhausted, for, unless you are very
â¢wealthy, or very beautiful, or very indis
criminate or very fortunate the West End
does not offer very much, even to attrac
tive younz Americans of an observant
turn of mind. The East End, on the con
trary, presents a large field to a modern
young woman who occupies herself with
economical and social problems. Miss
Grey can talk with fearful intelligence
about trades and the employer and the
employed. Her sympathies are always
v;ith the workingman, who is to her im
agination a kind of Adam Bede with a
"v^kney accent; or with the working
sTrnan, who moves in a terrible back
ground of abuse, intemperance and want,
singing the "Song of the Shirt." The em
ployer is a kind of slave-driver, with a
knotted scourge, who rubs his hands and
counts his gold and says "Ha! ha!" in
accents of diabolical triumph.
It was, therefore, with suppressed en
thusiasm that she accepted an invitation
to attend a dance to working girls in
"Whitechapel. These dances are given
once a month, under the patronage of
the charitable women of the "West End, as
a kind of connection with and relaxation
from the more serious entertainments at
Newton House, the wonderful chanty
Frederic Harrison has so successfully pro
moted.
Miss Grey spent considerable time and
thought upon her toilet. "Would it be in
a spirit of envy that these less fortunate
daughters would regard her or in one of
emulation? Would they be inspired by a
toilet of exquisite taste? Would they
consider it a compliment to themselves or
would it simply serve to increase the dis
tance and mark the difference between
them? A csmpromise was finally decided
nron, and accordingly Miss Grey appeared
on the evening in question in a new street
This Bird Stood Twelve Feet High
0/R. E. C. STIRLING, F. R. S., an
!f nounces that he discovered, during
_,* a visit to Australia, from which he
Las just returned, the remains of an ex
tinct bird which in life measured twelve
feet in height. The bird, as Dr. Stirling
describes it, is unknown to history. In
some respects it resembies the elephant
footed moa, and in others the emu of the
present day. It differs from ail in so
great a degree, however, as to prove it to
have been a class by itself. Large quan
tities of the remains were discovered,
showing that centuries ago this great
feathered creation was a common sight on
the Australian plains.
The place of discovery Is called Lake
Callabonna, and is located in South Aus
tralia. If it has at any time been visited
by other than the natives Dr. Stirling
found no trace of the fact. Lake Calla
bonna is one of those basins which are
dignified with the name of lake, but only
become such during those tremendous
downpours of water which transform the
seeming Australian desert into the ver
dure-clad plain. When Dr. Stirling visited
it it was really a hard clay saltpan, cov
ered with glittering crystals of gypsum
and salt. It is salt that preserved the
bones. Salt accomplishes this, although
it renders the bones exceedingly brittle.
THE GIANT BIRD OF THE ANTIPODES.
The remains of the big: bird were found
associated with those of otner extinct
marsupials. Owing to the fact of the ex
treme brittleness caused by the salt the
task of recovering and preserving them
â¢was one of exceeding difficulty. It was,
however, accomplished safely and, so far
cs can be determined all that was neces
gown, with a pretty bonnet and French
slippers that would certainly not fail to
impress the Whitechapel mind. She had
implored me to accompany her, and the
invitation being seconded by the patron
ess of the evening we found ourselves at
the appointed time on the top of an
omnibus headed for the East End.
Miss Grey was quite silent. In imagina
tion she saw herself carrying a beacon
of light into the darkness; the benighted
souls, touched by the rhythm and poetry
el motion, spellbound by the grace and
delicate beauty of her movements, would
iind themselves uplifted to an ideal worth
aspiring to. She saw them, in her mind's
eye, open-mouthed with astonishment
and delight, watching her as she swayed
before them teaching them their steps.
The omnibus rattled on; the streets
around the theaters and music halls pre
sented the usual crowded, rushing, splen
did spectacle. The electric light at the
entrances brought into sudden promi
nence the occupants of carriages, flashing
like brilliant birds, in plumage of every
color and degree of elegance, across the
darkness. There is no point where gayoty
ends and sobriety begins; a gradual
change in the countenance of the crouds,
a gradual narrowing of the already suffi
ciently narrow streets; instead of the
cries of coachmen and infuriate 1 omnibus
drivers, the calls of one more or less ex
hilarated seeker after pleasure to a corn
panion at a distance. Instead of the elec
tric lignts of theaters, the far more fre
quent and cheerful glare of the public
house.
Instead of the elaborate simplicity of
the women In the carriages at the en
trances to the theaters, sleek heads wi;h
nodding plumes and a sparkle of dia
monds, we have plumes, too, cock-feathers,
bold and aggressive, in hats and bonnets
of crushed magnificence, and a fringe,
sary to make up a perfect specimen of the I
bird was secured.
The study of the skeleton, as it has been
prepared and placed together in this city,
reveals facts of singular interest. For in
stance, the tibia and femur are almost ex
actly the same in both size and proportion
as those of the moa, traces of which hare
been found in Connecticut in the United
States. Then there is a jump of centuries
to the present day, for the sternum or
breastbone resembies that of the emu as
it exists now. The leg bones are like those
of the elephant bird which science knows
as the Diornis elephantopus. TÂ«e neck
and head must hare resembled in life
those of an ostrich of tremendous propor
tions.
Careful study of the remains in detail
showed that the bird was without wings,
| and therefore is likely to have possessed
many of the habits of the ostrich. Per
haps no better idea of the size of the bird
can be obtained than from the measure
ment of its skull, which Is 1 foot 2 inches.
It is probable this bird lived in marshy
places and fed on herbage. Still, it was
also apparontthat the toes were small and
weak, which has caused some of the pa
leontologists to doubt the marshy ground
I feature of Dr. Stirling's explanation.
However that may be, it is apparent that
the bird was a dweller of the plains, and
that at least in the vicinity of the marshes
it must have found the food which pre
served its life.
The footprints of birds are peculiar and
mora readily distinguishable than those
of most other animals. Birds tread on
their toes only. These are articulated to
a single metatarsal bone at right angles
to it and they diverge more from each
other than in other animals. It Is, there
fore, the formation of the foot of the Aus
tralian bird which the paleontologists
have studied more closely, and though
they have found the resemblance stated
it is in no instance sufficient to permit of
it being placed in the same classification
as any other specimen of prehistoric bird
so far discovered with the possible ex
ception of the bird that made the foot
print on the Connecticut sandstone.
While, of course, Dr. Stirling's announce-
ment is so recent as to prevent anything
like an extended investigation being
made thus far, scientists have taken the
matter up and are striving to find a place
for the bird from Anstralia.
There is only one prehistoric bird known
to history which has something of the
same appearance as tins unknown Aug
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 28, 1897.
inevitable and wonderful to behold! The
air is full of shouting street musicians,
shouting street venders of cheap fancy
goods, crowds of factory girls pourintr
suddenly out of a black doorway, with
hoots and cat calls that resemble nothing
more than the cries of wild animals at
feeding time. The omnibus rattles on,
across this desert of noise, into sudden
oases of silence; a church in the middle of
a deserted square; an inclosed space with
1 ancient trees; quiet little streets with
figures brushing by, creeping close to the
walls as if to escape notice, in a mute
apology for existence. Al! this ever
changing panorama passes before us,
befoie we reach the Liverpool station, in

Miss Grey, with a brave face and fear in
her heart, goes boldly and sits down close
to a young creature with a delicate face,
black ringlets and enormous gold circles
in her ears. She speaks to them with a
tralian specimen. In this the framework
of the leg is the most massive of any in
the class of birds. The toe bones almost
rival those of the elephant. Evidence has
been secured by scientists that this bird
afforded food to the natives of New Zea

came extinct. Possibly this is also true of

the Australian bird. Several other spe
cies of these extinct tridactyle wingless
birds have been discovered within the last
few years, but they have been very appar
ently of the same class as the specimens
which the museums already contained.
There is any amount of speculation in
scientific circles over Dr. Stirling's dis
covery. Theories have been formed, but
that is as far as any one has gone as yet
Dr. Stirling himself says that he d es not
know to what class the bird belongs.
That seems to be the exact truth so far
as every boay else Is concerned.
The Electric
Motor Bike
"â "BULECTRICITY may now drive tlie
â l^n^ motor bicycle. An invention has
mmift been patented by Sumter B. Battey
of New York, which makes the unusual
combination of the electric spark and either
naphtha, petroleum or gaaoline. The union
of the two elements is accomplished by
placing a battery on top of the tank con
taining whatever fluid may be preferred of
the three mentioned. The former it con
nected by the necessary wires with the
motive apparatus so that the electricity
may cause the necessary explosion which
produces an impelling force whenever it
is desired.
Battery and supply tank are located
back of and just under the saddle of the
bicycle. The bicycle is supplied with the
usual chain and sprocket wheels, one of
the latter being attached to the pedal
spindle, and the second sprocket wheel to
the axle of the b cycle at one side of tbe
rear traction wheel. At the end of tbe
shaft opposite the sprocket wheel is
attached a pinion adapted to gear with
the driving pinion. This is journaled to
a stud that forms part of the casing that
surrounds the revolvable cylinder, secured
to the shaft of the rear wheel. It is in
this cylinder that the pockets are located â
in the outer section â which receive a
charge of vapor that causes the wheel to
revolve.
Attached to the stud is a crank arm and
pivoted to the uuter end of this is a con
necting rod which connects with the pis
ton rod of a piston that moves within the
first cylinder, which ia attached by braces
to a second cylinder. Now it is absolutely
necessary that b. th of the cylinders shall
be of a size that will enable them to hold
practically the same number of cable feet
of gas or vapor. Connecting these two
cylinders at a point near their outer ends
is a channel in the form of a tube.
friendliness that is almost pathetic, but
they stare at her in dumb antagonism, or
answer her in monosyllables.
Our lady patroness, who has had a long
experience, goes after a few practical ques
tions straight to the piano. "Music," we
discover, "hath charms to soothe the sav
age breast."
"Girls," the lady patroness remarks as
she opens her roll of music, "this young
lady, Miss Grey, has been kind enough to
come down here with me to-night to
teach you some new steps. She comes
from America and will show you a new
dance called "The Washington Post.' "
This statement is received with some in
terest. Miss Grey smiles, like the sun,
upon all alike. Some new arrivals press
in along the walls and their advent pro
claims a suruten relapse into shyness, with
more shoves and kicks and whispers.
Miss Grey explains the steps and in
vites the smallest, girl to try it. She of
the black ringlets looks about for a means
to escape, but is pushed forward, with
some suppressed jeering. Miss Grey
drags her about by sheer force, the girl
presenting herself like a thing on wheels.
She sinks back into oblivion with some
thing like a sob of grateful anguish. I
have retired into the ignominious posi
tion of turning the leaves for the Lady
Patroness, who plays, with admirably
marked time, the most stirring music. It
is with shame 1 confess that I feel no
movement of that philanthropic passion
that kindles in Miss Grey the flame that
makes her a martyr.
This channel is supplied with valves
which automatically open to exhaust the
vapor from one cylinder and to close it
when the other is taking in a supply.
Communicating with the first cylinder at
a point about opposite the outlet tube is
an inlet tube that leads into one side of a
vaporizer. This vaporizer communicates
with a supply pipe leading to the tank
located back of the saddles, and the supply
of whatever the tank contains to the
vaporizer is regulated by a stopcock at
tached to the supply pipe.
The reservoir located back of and be"
neath the sad lie is secured to the frame
of the wheel by suitable braces, of which
the casing forms a part. So far as the
electric battery is concerned, it Is the in
ventor's idea that it will be easier to place
it on top of the supply tank.
Now as to the operation of the machine.
The stopcock of the pipe leading from the
tank is turned on sufficiently to allow a
small stream of the fuel to flow into the
vaporizer. Owing to the small inlet being
partially closed the fuel flows very slowly,
diffuses itself over the surface of the
spherical distributor and then vaporizes
within the chamber formed by the upper,
hollow portion of the vaporizer. Then
the bicycle is started, the rider pedaling
in the ordinary fashion until the neces
sary rotary motion is imparted to the
sprocket wheel and thence to the cylinder
and pinion. This imparts continuous
movement to the piston contained within
the first cylinder, and the piston moves
back and forth, alternately taking in a
supply of vapor and discharging the same.
Jusi as soon as the inward stroke of the
piston is completed and the supply of
vapor in the cylinder exhausted into the
second cylinder an electrical contact re*
suits. This causes the reproduction of a
spark within the second cylinder explod
ing the vapor.
The expansive force thus obtained is ex
erted upon the driving cylinder through
the medium of one of the pockets. This
pocket is then exhausted through the pipe
and thence through the openings in the
pipe back into the vaporizer. The hot air
in transit from the pocket of the cylinder,
mixes with the supply of cold air which is
drawn iv through the open top of the
pipe. This mixture of hot and cold air as*
sists in the vaporization of the fuel that
has Sowed into 'the vaporizer from the
tank and thus a continuous supply of
Vapor for the first cylinder is maintained.
This makes it plain to be seen that by the
means described a continuous rotary mo
tion is supplied to the cylinder and thence
to the wheel of the bicycle. In this way an
even and, if desired, terrific speed can be
maintained until the supply of vaporiza
ble material is exhausted or the machine
is stopped by the rider. The cyclist can
stop at his discretion, and in just the
same way as if there was no motor at
tachment to his wheel.
A study of the accompanying illustra
tion will show plainly tnat while on the
face of it the invention may seem some
what complex, in reality it is simple.
The inventor claims that no knowledge

It is really remarkable with what quick
ness these heavy-looking, sullen women
and girls grasp and imitate the move
ment ot the new dance. An immense
girl, Vho is shaped like a hippopotamus,
leads the column. Her great feathers flap
into the faces of her partners.
"Oime the gentleman, Oi am !" she as
serts, smiling like the above-named ani
mal, from ear to ear.
The much to be deprecated shyness
finally gives way to a gayety that is hardly
less disconcerting. The building trembles
under the pounding stamps of the barn
dance. Miss Grey enjoys great popular
ity; she is banded about like a sweetmeat;
some of the women dance, with great
solemnity, holding each other as in a vise
and revolving with rigid bodies, like
wooden soldiers; others whirl each other
giddily, flinging their arms like wind
mills, throwing out their feet hue horses,
and making noise enough for a whole
regiment of cavalry. Gradually their
faces lose their expression of petrified
hostility; the pallor that was their dis
tinguishing characteristic has given way
to flames of color on sunken. cheeks; the
fringes, for which no factory girl is too
poor or too busy, wave in unwonted
luxuriance. Hats are thrown aside, the
tall girl alone retains hers, which is a
wonder in the way of millinery, with its
vari-colored wines and bouquets.
A new arrival enters with a walk that
distinguishes her; it is short, brisk, light.
She is dressed with neatness and some
taste, and her fringe is comparatively
small. She is greeted with general delight,
and is almost thrown at Miss Grey in a
mistaken enthusiasm, as being an Ameri
can also.
"I Din three years in America," she be
gins, with great good humor and appar
ently no diffidence whatever. "That's a
country, ain't it? I bin three years in
Successful Railroad Without a Car
apSLHERE is a railroad in Oregon over
â 'w wn * cd passes an enormous traffic,
(jJLf* although the line does not possess a
tingle car. It is located upon one of the
highest elevations of the west slope of the
Cascade Mountains, in the heart of what
has been until a comparatively recent date
an almost inaccessible region. Its length
is five miles, ana it circles and twists in
that distance until it resembles the trail of
a mammoth serpent. It represents the
most difficult achievement of the lumber
men of the Webfoot State.
The only feature of the road except the
me itself that resembles the ordinary
narrow-gauge railroad is the eighteen-ton
Baldwin locomotive which forms the
power that pulls the freight. This freight
consists of logs, which will average of a
size equal to that of the engine boiler.
These logs are formed from the trees
which are felled by the red-shirted lum
bermen in the employ of the Bridal Veil
Lumber Company. After being cut the
logs are rolled to the nearest point on the
railroad. They are then arranged in a
line, huge staples driven in each end. sec
tions of heavy chain attached to the sta
ples, forming a train of logs. The fore
most of these logs is then chained to the
engine, which hauls it and its companions
upon the roadbed of the line.
The railroad is narrow gauge, three feet.
It is constructed on the same principle
THE RAILROAD THAT OPERATES WITHOUT CARS.
adopted by regulation roads over which
cars pass, with one exception. Stoat
plank is nailed to the ties and it is npon
this foundation that the lo.'s rest as the
engine pulls them along. The rails
act as guards to prevent the logs
leaving the track. in this manner
the timber is conveyed from the
point at which the engine takes it
New Jersey, in a fishnet factory. Ain't it
grand?"
Miss Grey rises to the occasion and pro
nounces it very grand indeed. The girl
has a singular face â very white, with
light, luminous eyes, and a pale mouth
with even teeth. Most of the women have
neglected teeth, and not a few have but
one cr two discolored fangs, like old hags.
She flaunts her superiority and waves in
the faces of her envious companions that
Btay in America, the accounts of which
they listen to as they would listen to the
descriptions of a heaven to which they
might possibly aspire.
"The men. I tell you strite, they are
gentlemen. I think Englishmen are just
pigs, don't you?"
Mis? Grey, with a sudden blush, hesi
tatingly murmurs that she had met a few
who seemed rather pleasant.
"Ho!" replied her tormentor; "and
English girls is worse. Now, when the
men says to me to do this or to do that I
says where I comes from the men helps
theiraeives."
"Did you celebrite last Monday?"
"Monday?" repeated Miss Grey.
"Washington's birthday ; I did, I sang
'My Country, 'Tis o' Thee' and "Aii
Co.umbia!' A lydy I know, she can ply
the piano, she plys by hear. I sang 'em
good. I'm goin' back in June. Hi
wouldn't sty in London, not for a good
I deal. I'm a wi- tress here, I am, and I
don't stand from 7 till 10 every day, no
don't!"
The fine sarcasm of this was not lost
uron her audience; the girls had crowded
close to her, and their heated f.ices pressed
around, the air was very close. Miss Grey
looked into the excited eyes about her;
tbe problem was even more interesting
than she had expected, but it was a little
unpleasantly startling to come into such
close contact with those impulsive and ex
in charge to the beginning of the two-mile
flume that leads from the end of the first
section of tbe road to what is called the
chute pond, a small body of water located
about a haif mile from the mill where the
logs are turned into lumber.
In order that the logs may slip easily
along the roadbed the plank nailed to th<*
ties is kept thoroughly greased, except at
sharp grades, where the momentum of
the logs is sufficient to cause them to
slide easily. As the road is located on a
mountainside, where the declivities are
often so great as to make straight descent
of the line impossible, for the reason that
if that were tried the logs would slide
forward upon the engine, the road has
been constructed largely upon the plan of
that by which the tourist ascenda Pikes
Peak in Colorado. The curves are in
many instances so abrupt that to the un
initiated it seems as if the loga must slide
over the rails to the ground, but disaster
of this sort is avoided by the logs being
chained together as previously described.
Fastening them in this style gives the
timber train that same general solidity
which the vestibule imparts to the mod
ern train of passenger cars.
The roadbed, cr rather its foundation,
is not of course like that of the great lines
over which passenger and freight cars
roll, but although roughly constructed, it
has surprising strength. While as stated
the logs are rolled from the point at which
they are oat to the most convenient place
on the railroad in many instances, the
chute is called into play at what is known
as the upper pond. This pond is to be
found near the starting point of the line,
and to it from various sections of the
mountainside where trees are being
felled flumes or chutes are ran. The logs
citable creatures, who could be so easily
swayed; wbo, one moment, were flinging
themselves about in a dance full of care*
less noise and abandon, and the next were
standing still and fierce, with wild eyes
and little exclamations of rage, that she
conld not comprehend, bat that were di
rected apparently straight at her.
The lady patroness broke into the
silence with an enlivening waltz and the
hippopotamus approached Miss Grey,
beckoning at her with a face like a mask
<>f Comedy. " 'Aye a swing?" she de
manded with great politeness.
After a moment, however, the tall one
stopped with disgust.
"What are you dancin'? That ain't
a waltz; that's a shotteesche." Then
she a-k-ed: "Shall I learn you how we
waltz?"
Miss Grey humbly consented. She
confided to mo afterward that each
girl had after a few moments become not
her pupil, as she had fondly expected, but
her preceptress; that their knowledge of
all dances was fearfully and wonderfully
deep.
I watched Miss Grey in her encounter
with her new friend. It could not be
called a dance or a walk. The hippopota
mus moved like a stone-crusher, jerking a
path for herself down the room. Every
now and then she swung her partner, who
appeared to fling herself violently into her
arms; her feet would fly up from under
her, her hair waved back, and her hair
pins curved through the air like a flight of
swallows.
As she passed, the lemonade glasses rat
tled and her skirt swept the dried bucuits
that stood on a plate on a chair all
about tbe room. This disaster brought a
termination to the enjoyment of the even
ing. It was discovered to be late and the
janitor of the building and a skeleton
woman who scrubbed floors appeared at
the door. The giils surrounded us with
eager faces, quite unlocked now to our
glances, laughing, shouting, like boister
ous and grateful children.
Most of them had put their long day in
the manufacture of artificial flowers and in
the tailoring establishment-, but they
were as full of energy and as ready for fur
ther frolic as schoolboys just dismissed for
the day.
Little Miss Grey, however, was quite
limp and exhausted. As the girls thun
dered down the stair 3 she drew a long
breath of relief. Her ambition to bring
lierht <nto the dark lives of the working
girls had been temporarily completely
extinguished. The hippopotamus only
had lingered, and now thoofc her violently
by the hand. "We had a dance, we had.
It was a 'ot job, it was. You come along
next time and I'll learn you the
shotteesche 1 !"
Miss Grey smiled faintly, on the verge of
tears, and I hastily put out the light. In
another moment we were on the street,
along which in groups the girls were walk
ing, wrangling, laughing loudly.
Miss Grey is no longer an advocate of
active philanthropy. Vast Dykk Brown.
then, instead of being moved with diffi
culty to within "reaching distance" of the
locomotive, nre placed in the chute and
down they go to the bottom into the pond.
Once in the water, a detail of men fasten
tbe Jogs together, just as desciibed in out
lining the make-up of a train. A stout
incline runs from the water up to the
railroad track. The train of logs is poled
%long until the foremost lies at the foot of
this incline. A chain is then fastened to
the logs, the other end thereof being
attached to the engine. The loco
motive pulls and the legs, confined
within a high - curved channel,
are brought up on to the track and start
on their journey to the mill. This is the
process adopted at the upper pond. The
accompanying illustration denotes the
method in use at the pond which lies at
the end of the first section of the railroad.
The Journey of the logs to the two-mile
flume is uneventful. When the flume is
reached the engine is detached from the
log train, and the logs, from which all
chains are removed, are diverted into
the mouth of the flume. Once started it
takes a log but a small fraction of
time to make its way to the lower pond.
Here the process of forming tha bis;
tree trunks into trains is repeated in
the same fashion as at the upper pond.
The process of getting them on the track,
however, is much easier. At this point
the track runs in such a way that logs and
road axe almost aide by side, so the engine
has bat little difficulty in transferring the
freight from the water to the roadbed.
Now the logs are beginning tne conclu
sion of their journey, for from the lower
pond the line of the road runs without
break to the mill, where the log* are
turned o?er to the sawyers,

AT
THE
THEATRES
â¢â â â SIHE story runs that one evening
Â£|S?j Massenet and Henri Cain (fiance
jLf& of Emma Calve) were discussing
"La CavalleriaÃusticana," "Santa Lucia"
and other new operas in which music that
charms the public ear is wedded to police
court plots. Massenet remarked that he
craved for a more lurid story than the
Santuzza episode and Cain replied that he
had a plot on tap wnicb would just fill the
bill. They thereupon discussed tbÂ« de
tail? and decided that in order to pile on
the agony properly there must be no solos
or duets or set numbers of any kind, if
possible they desired to go one better than
the late lamented Richard Wagner in the
way of making the action continuous.
"La Xavarraise," produced here for the
first time last Thursday, was th^outcome
of this confab. It is now nearly three
yearn old, but up to date it holds the
championship for getting more condensed
agony into a given space of time than
any other lyric drama.
If "La Navarraise" is a fa-r sample of
the trend of modern lyric drama It won't
be a decade before stronger nerves are re
quired to attend tne opera than to go to
an ftxecution. At the latter function one,
or at most two, men are whisfced with
painful suddenness into eternity, Out in
"La Navarraise" companies of gallant
soldiers are wiped out wholesale with all
the realism of actual warfare.
It is la guerre, I' horrible guerre, in all
its revolting hideousness that forms the
theme of "La Navarraise." Wounded
soldiers are brought in on stretchers
bathed in gore, the smoke of gunpowder
bangs heavy over the stage and gets into
the nostrils of the spectators, and the
very air seems thick with carnage. Noth
ing recalls the grotesque parody warfare
of every-day melodrama, where the
wounded are so often made the butt of an
unfeeling gallery. In "La Navarraise''
everything seems real; the battle is
actually raging a few yards off, men are
being shot down within hearing. Officers
are giving sharp, short, decisive orders,
suitable to the emergency o ' the moment ;
dusty, begrimed stragglers come in from
the retreat, excnanging fusillades with
their pursuers, the wounded dragging
themselves painfully, all who are able to
carry a musket fighting and shooting to
the la-t gasp. The action is breathless in
its rapidity, and the orchestra adds the
illusion of absolute realism by tne startling
way in which it transcribes what is pass
ing on the s:aee.
Divorced from its music, the libretto of
"La Navarraise ' might be grewsom*: and
nothing else, but words and score together
form melodrama heaped on melodrama's
head io so realistic a way that xin spec
tator starts and gasps with excitement.
There is no time to ?top and analyze; the
ear is filled witn tone pic ares and the eye
with *tage piciures so luridly and rapidly
painted that in the illusion of the moment
"La Navarraise" seems more fac than
fiction.
Judged from a first hearine, tasasenet
has not shown much melodic invention in
his score â melody never was his Strong
point. The overture opens with a strongly
marked theme, as suggestive of disaster
as the "knocking" motive in the first bars
of Verdi's "Force of Destiny." Before the
overture is half finished all semblance oÂ£
theme is swamped in sounds as of a
Fourth of July celebration or a grand
chivaree of devils in Chinatown. It is the
Carlisis repu'.sing the royalists at close
quarters, and both armies have evidently
unlimited ammunition. At intervals ah
through "L.\ Navarra.s-j" this din is re
newed, and though nervous people start
and pray aloud tnat n<> stray bullets wiil
come their way, the shooting adds mar
velouslv to tue realism â and realism
seems to have be<-n the composer's main
object.
A great deal of the vocal score souni
like recitative, thouga familiarity with
the music mi rht reveal more melody.
The gem of the opera is the song and
chorus sung by Busta and the other sol
diersâa lovely, characteristically Spanish
melody, of the serenade kind, accom
panied by strings, toucned pizzicato, and
by the soft rhythmic clapping of the sol
diers' hands. Enthusiastic applause
would no doubt have greeted this num
ber, but Massenet wrote "La Navarraise 1 '
on the "encores strictly prohibited" plan,
so he rudely breaks into his lovely sere
nade by bugles sounding the order to
march, and before one spectator has had
time to clap his hands, hi, preno ! tne
soldiers are all in motion, and the cha nee
for the encore fiend has gone forever.
The music in which An;ta and Araquii
recall how they firÂ«t met and loved i*
characteristically SoaniÂ«h and is -very
sweet and melodious withal. No douoi
Massenet intended it to represent an
ecno of the days when sweetness entered
into the lives of these unhappy lover*.
No opera bailt on the "Cavalleria Ras
ticana" plan would b? comDiete without
the intermezzo. It is as inevitable a?
doom. Massenet's intermezzo is played
as the ni. lit is supposed to p.isi and the
soldiers are bivouacked round the camp
fire. There is any amount of originality
and consideraole quaintness about th .Â»
intermezzo, but Mascagni ha? no need to
tremb'.e for his laurels. Speaking p*rÂ«on
a!iy. I could not decide whether the inter
mezzo reminded me most of the Scotch
bagpipes or a Chinese orchestra.
I am almost tempted To go into extrava
gances over the way "La Xavarraise"' was
acted, costumed and generally stage
managed. The worn, dirty uniforms and
biood-Â«tained bandages, the peilmeil rash
ing hiti.er an I thither and the martial
bearing of soldiers and officers were all
startlingiy realistic. I forgave tbe fact
that the singing of tbe men was not np to
the standard of the company, for the man
agement had pnt men en who could act.
Mme. Foedor sang splendidly as Anita,
thouzh the weakness of her low notes waa
very apparent. If Foedor's voice were of
equal power throughout what a falcon
she would be! Her acting was whole
souled and conscientious, but she does not
possess tbe subtle, tragic power that
makes you feel cold chills in the region of
your spine, as an ideal Anita should do â
â till Foedor deserved the many curtain
calls she received.
Tbe only quarrel I bad with the staging
of "La Navarraise" waÂ« tne freakish way
in which the light effects were managed.
At tbe openinjr of tbe work it seemed to
be high noon, with a clear sun overhead.
Anon a pitchy darkness came over the
state, end before many more bars had
been played the dawn appeared. The
radiant morn was succeeded by a cool,
gray twilight, which gave place to night
again. In fact, the only possible explana
tion for the rapid alterations of light
.md darkneÂ«s was that the electrician saw
tit to modulate the glow according to the
intensity ot the emotions expressed on the
stage â the darker the pas-ions the more
funereal the gloom.
Havine seen Foedor in "La Navarraiss"
I am now possessed of a burning desire to
see what the be&utiful AimeePa-cal would
do as Anita. The curiosity to hear Pascal
is quite widespread. Foedor says that
Pascal cannot sing. Pascal declares that
t c only hindrance to her singing is that
Foedor will not give her a chance. "The
best way to decide the question is to let
us hear Pascal," said a French friend of
mine the other day, and he added: "EHe
aurait un grand succes de curiosite" â
and you know a success of curiosity fills
the management's coffers as quickly as
any other sort of success.
M. Jean Jules Samuel Barnard has
achieved greatness and will go down to
posterity side by side with Napoleon,
Louis IX and Charlemagne. A month
ago Barnard was unknown to fame, to-day
his name is on every tongue in Paris.
Tnis modern hero has not led a crusade
against the Moslems or won another Aus
terhtz, but lie has achieved a greater vic
tory than Napoleon dreamed of â Jean
Jules Samuel Barnard has practically
routed the theater hat from French soil.
There has been a great anti-theater hat
wsive breaking over France lately. The
papers have published columns of inter
views on the hat question. Male theater
goers, walied in benind b:g ckapeaux, have
made anti-hat demonstrations?" but all to
no avail, for tne hats were always with
them in every part of the house, blotting
out the stage and turning the joy of
t i. eater-going into a delusion and a
mockery.
One evening, when the anti-hat wave
was at its height, Barnard bought an or
chestra ticket at the Athenee Cumique to
see ''Mine, Putiphar." No sooner had he
taken his seat than be 'realized that be
might as well have gone to the Bois de
Boulogne or any other serai-rural retreat,
for his view consisted solely of a wilder
ness of flowers, io iaee and birds that
bristled in every direction from two
theater hats. Barnard did not call an
u-ber and make a scene, be uttered no
audible protest He put on his own hat
and awaited developments.
He bad not long to wait, for almost i.n
â¢nediately there were protestations and
cries of "chapeau! chapeau!" from all
sides. An usher approached and politely
begeed him to uncover, but Barnard re
fused, alleging that immediately in front
f him were two ladies whose hats were
much higher than his, and that they com
pletely bid the stage from his view. The
usher insisted and menaced Barnard w.th
a commissaire of police. When matters
ecame so strained that a riot seemed im
minent Barnard withdrew to the box
office and asked the treasurer for his
mo.icy back, the treasurer refused and
after having the refusal witnessed to by
another employe of the theater Barnard
went away.
The epilogue to these incidents was
that the director of the Athenee Comique
received a citation to appear before a
Justice of the Peace, at the request of M. j
Jean Jules Samuel Barnard. After ]
summing up the facts in the case, the
citation, robbed of its legal phraseolozy, i
reads something like this: There is no
rdmanoe in .France compelling men 10 :
ake off their hats in the theater, i
Women's hats, by their ridiculously exag- !
aerated dimensions, cause much more \
! annoyance than any man's hat could pos
i sibly do, and yet they are tolerated in
j every part of the theater. The difference
of sex does not suffice to explain this in
equality in tolerating an abuse. Men
have more excuse for keeping on their
Jiats than women, as they suffer more
from baldness. In consequence M. Jean
Jules Samuel Barnard demands the resti
tution of the 8 francs he expended for his '
seat, plus 2 X 4 francs damaees for having
been deprived of the pleasure of seeing
the performance.
The French press considers it a fore-' j
i gone conclusion that Barnard will win his '
case, which means that he will establish I
! the fact that the Code Napoleon contains j
no article which prohibits the wearing of \
hats in theaters by men. Wuh the Bar- j
! nard precedent to sustain him a theater- 'â â 
t;oer eclip*ed behind a big chapcau has a j
simple remedy. He puts on his own hat
; and immediately the performance is !
â¢topped Dy cries of "Chapeau."
By claiming equal rights for both sexes
Barnard is considered to have solved a
problem that statesmen, philosophers,
: supervisors, poets and journalists have j
, grappled with for years in vain.

The editor of a local newspaper up in Connec-

RIPANS TABULES
"Every spring and summer," said he, <4 I have
been greatly troubled with dyspepsia and constipa-
tion, and have tried various remedies with no per-
manent relief. A few weeks ago I came in pos- m
session of some of these Tabules and, somewhat
incredulously, began their use. The results have
been truly astonishing. They hit the right spot
from the first, and so far this season I have never
felt better in my life."

Is nÂ«tjally accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to" low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually flr3t appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior

north and sooth along the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low-" Is inclosed with isobars of

the pressure falling to the California, coast, warmer

will produce an opposite result.

2 NEXT YORK, N. V., March 27.â Speculation at
the Stock Exchange started off firm and the usu- j
ally active issues rose Vs @'A Per cent. Tho
rally failed to stimulate commission-house buying,
and before .11 o'clock the bears resumed aggres- j
sive tactics. They sold the Western railroads and !
industrials vigorously, .and finally succeeded in j
abating out weakly margined stock all along the
' line. ThÂ« heaviness of the market' was due pri
marily to the recent decision of the United States
Supreme Court, which has led to the withdrawal
of fifteen roads from the Western Fieieht Assocla- j

i tions will take similar action in the near future.
The industrials were adversely affected by the
circulation of unfavorable rumors. . ..> ...

EFFIE'S FATE IS
IN THE BALANCE
Judge Seawell Will Give
a Decision Next
Tuesday.
Mrs. Martin, the Mother Pro
Tempore, Tells of the Little
One's Preference.
Showed Aversion to Mrs. D'Artenay,
but Displayed Aff ciion for Mrs.
Holstrom.
Judge Seawell has promised to decide
the fate of little Effie V. R. Holstronivu 2
o'clock next Tuesday afternoon, and in
the meantime Mrs. Lucinda Holstrom,
the fester-mother, and Mrs. Sarah
d'Artenay, the actual mother of the c&ild.
will have a period of unhappy suspense.
The little girt was born out of wedlock
and wa.Â« given by the ruothei to Mrs. Hol
strom, with a written agreement that she
should be raised as Mrs. Holstrom's own
child.
Mrs. Mary Martin of Oakland is also de
sirous of having a decision of the case,
because sne is as anxious to sui r?nder cus
tody of the baby as tlie ottiers are to have
possession of it. Nearly a month ago
Mrs. Martin appeared in court and of
fered to become the motner pro tempore
of the little waif pending the hearing of
the contest oetween tue mother and the
loster-mother. She explained that she
took this course irom motives of philan
thropy, because she did not like to see
an innocent child thrust into the City Jail,
near a cell occupied by Butler, the Aus
tralian mnrderer.
It was expected that the trial would not
last more than a day or two, but the usual
delays of litigation made their appear
ance and Mrs. Murtin Ims suffered for a
month became of her kinu heart. She
proved so acceptable to both sides of tne
controversy that they could not agree on
any one to take her place.
Mrs. Martin was ihe tirst witness called
by Attorney Kugene N. Deuprey on be
half of MrÂ«. Holstrom yesterday morning.
Mrs. Martin testified that when the little
one was given to her sne cried all night
for her "Mamma Holstrom," as she calied
her foster-mother. After tnat Mrs. d'Ar
tpnay called to see the child and little
Effie showed aversion and would not go
liear her.
"I felt very sorry for the mother, of
course," said Mrs. Martin, "but it was not
my fault. She wept and said the others
had prejudiced the baby against her. and
I told her nobody had tried to do that in
my presence."
Mr. Sullivan assured Mrs. Martin that
no one nad the slightest fault to lind with
any of her acts; ihat ad are satisued with
her conduct.
Continuing, Mrs. Martin said that when
Mrs. Holsirom called to see the child
both the foster-mother and the child
evinced great affection for each other.
The child seemed to grieve after the fos
ter-mother and became ill in consequence
so that it became necessary to ask the
foster-mother to desist from further visits.
Mrs. Martin said that it was necessary to
keep the child away from the windows for
the reason that every time she looked out
on the street she imagined that she saw
Officer Franfc Kane, who took her from
her foster-mother, or somebody that
looked like Mr. Kane, which so terrilied
the child that it made her sick. It was
evident to the witness that the child pre
ferred to go wi:h Mrs. Holstrom, the
loster-mother.
Mrs. Mary A. Hawley, Mrs. Nailor, Mrs.
Mary O'Dell, Mrs. Crosby and Mrs.
Wyckoff testified to the good character
and good reputation of Mrs. Holsirom.
Dr. Ttirasher was called and was assed if
he had written a letter to Mr. Hoistrom
signing a woman's name. He said be did
not write ihe letter and did not know the
woman whose name was signed to the
letter.
Mrs. Evelyn K. Benton also denied
knowledge of the letter or its contents.
Mrs. d r Artenay. mother of tha child,
was recalled to the witness-stanil ard de
nied all tne stories that had been told
against her. She said: "From tbe time
of my uhild's Dirth I have lived as good a
life as any woman could. I have atoned
for my wrong as fully as it is possible for
a human being to do. Hester Prynne, in
the 'Scarlet Letter,' did not suffer as I have
suffered, for she was allowed to keep her
child while I had to give mine up."
Mr. Sullivan asked bi> client to confine
herself to answering questions. The lady
thereupon declared tnat she had never
said the child nad been 100 much trouble
to her already and denied that she ever
said she hoped not to ever see it a/am.
Mr. Deuprey drew from Mrs. d'Artenay
an admission that she nad always said
and still reiterated that h'-r only reason for
ICE-W TO-OAT.

seeking the custody of her child was De
cause she heard that Mrs. Hoistrom
wantep to cive the iittle one up to some
body eiÂ«e.
At this point there was an episode of
unusual interest to Mrs. d'Artenay. Mr.
Sullivan called to the witness-stand Po
lice Officer Crockett, and Mr. Deuprey
wanted to know what it was proposed to
prove by ths witness. He said that he
might prob-iDly be able 10 make a state
ment that would be satisfactory to coun
sei and the court.
At the opening of the case it was inti
mated by some of his questions that a cer
tain Sally Ma^uire had been photographed
in tne nude ana that the petitioner here,
Mrs. d'Artenay, formerly Sally Maguire,
was the person so photographed.
"I have made an investigation, " said
Mr. Deuprey, "and find that this was an
instance of misinformation and mistaken
identity. This is not the Sally Maguire
who was so photographed."
"I thank you, Mr. Deuprey, for clearing
me of that charge," Mr?. d'Artenay,
und the witness was withdrawn.
Mr. Sullivan made a brief argument for
Mrs. d'Artenay, contending that the
agreement by which sne save and be
queathed her black-haired baby girl :o
Mrs. Holstrom to rear and educate as her
own was in fact nothing more than a will,
and that a will could not be enforced until
after the death o! the testator. He also
read statutes ana decisions to sustain his
possession ihat the mother of the child
had no legal right or ability to divest her
self ot her day to care for and support the
child.
Mr. Deuprey replied still more briefly.
He said tuat the writing given by MrS.
d'Anenay was in fact an abandonment of
her offspring, that it was le^al ami bind
ing, and that Mrs. Holstrom by taking the
lime one to her heart and nourishing it
in love and affection had earned a right to
ihe custody of the child, a right of wh eh
she could not be deprived at tuis late day.
He also read laws and court opinions 10
prove thai he was rijÂ»ht, and' closed by
asking the court to piace the brand of in
famy <>n the brow of that "perlidious wit
nes-, Bert Joy, who attempted to asperse
the iair name" of Mrs. Hobtrom by his foul
lies." Mi. Deuprey drew attention to the
fact that MrÂ«. Hoistrom is considered a
â¢eood woman by all who know her, and that
Joy stands alone in condemning her.
Her life was secretly inquired into by an
officer of the bociety for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, and no fault could be
found with her acts. He thought it had
been established that she is a lit person to
have custody of the child.
The lawyers agreed 10 file briefs in the
case on Monday ana Judge Seawell said
he would try to render a decision at 2
o'clock Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Martin, the mother pro tempore as
she volunteered to call herself, sighed and
t-aid she had hoped to be relieved of her
charge at once. "'You don't know what 1
have sacrificed in caring for this child,"
she cried. "I don't feel that 1 can Lear
this burden any longer."
Judsie Seawell and Attorneys Snllivan
and Deuprey pleaded with her to suffer
a few days more in the interest of human
ity, and she finally consented to keep the
child until next Tuesday, saying that she
would certainly surrender tue child into
the custody of the court at that time.

IT STILL HAS
CHARMS FOR HER
Interesting Items Found in
a New Woman's
Notebook.
A Bargain Counter to Serve the
Purpose of Advanced
Lectures.
Kind Words for C- Curtin, the Pioneer
Merchant, Who Is to Retire
From Business.
In spite of the wondrous strides woman
has made to the front in what she is
pleased to call her battle for emancipa
tion, or in spite of the manifold duties
tliis advancement has developed and the
numberless cares and burdens it has seen
tit to devolve upon her, in spite of all this
woman has clung to her love for the
beautiful and found time to cultivate her
inherent gift, the location of bargains.
Therefore, as should have been expected,
the "new woman" crowded with the "old"
the line old store of Curtin's, at 911 and
913 Market, street, just above Filth, and
lost no time in examining with that clo-e
attention to detail that distinmiishes her,
the many wondrous bargains the generous
management Had to offer. She did more
than admire, though. She purchased
and she thought and came to the whole
some conclusion that a visit to this vast
emporium was worth all the talks on
economy an advanced club could arrange
for in a year's course.
The dry-goods counter afforded much
food for reflection.
The exquisite coloring of the materials
offered the diversity of weaves, the many
qualities combining the useful with the
beautiful, and above all the marvelously
I low prices would form the subject for
many a lecture.
It is nothing to be marveled at that
more than one notebook contained the fol
lowing disjointed sentences that to the un
initiated might mean uext to nothing,
but to the sensible and economical wife
or mother or dauuhter mean the best
value for the least money ever made by a
reliable firm in tnis City:
"Basket cloths, 48 inches wide, 85 cents
per yard.
"University checks (new), silk ana wool
mixture, 46 inches wide, 75 cents per
yard.
"Light weight silk and wool spring nov
elties, 4fj inches wide, 85 cents per yard.
''Pebble suiting, motiair and wool, 50
cents per yard.
"Novelty plaids, 35 cents per yard.
"Silk and wool changeable suiting, 80
cents per yard.
"Novelty mixtures, 25 cents.
"Serges for ouung, 52 inches wide, ?5
cents per yard; habit cloths, 60 inches
wide, 50 cents per yard." Si- n ling out
boldly in one of the famoiiÂ« ' ote looks, in
a paragraph by itself, wp c the significant
words, "Evenine chides, full assortment
in albatross. H nrietta, cashzu -re and
serge* at half U c former pric.s, ranging
from 25 cents to 7i> cents."'
While the d res -goo a counter aston
ished, the effect of tuc . loak and suit de
parttuont was nothing suort of electrical.
HALE BROS. >
How any firm ini:ht show plush capes
with Thibet-fur trimming marked at
$12 50 and stylish Astrachan garments for
$5 surpassed even the belief of the most
imaginative. But the bargains did not
cease there. There were silk skirts of rich
brocade, lined and interlined and faced
with velveteen binding, from $6 to $15.
All the skirts are made after the fashion
able seven-gore pattern and fall in grace
lul stylish folds.
If the silk skirts are cheap what is there
to be said of a black wool nkirt, lined
throughout, showing the neatest work
manship, and retailed at 95 cents?
For the lovers of the natty and the chic
there are those charming checked
and jackets of solid material to matcu at
the ridiculously low figure of $10 per suit.
The jackets are lined throughout, with
ailk, an item in itself that should cer
tainly express more than half the price
demanded for the garment.
But Mr. Curtin, to celebrate his re
tirement from business after thirty-six
years of active commercial life, has not
limited his oargains to one or two coun
ters.
He has marked everything down â down
so low that it seems hard to believe with
out seeing it.
Who, lor instance, would credit the
assertion that Nottingham curtains of
delicate design may be purchased lor 75
cents? That there are Irish point cur
tains to be had lor $2, and portieres also for
tin- same low figure?
Blankets are one of the necessities of
life. Mr. Curtin realizes this and has
placed his stock withiii the reach of all.
You can purchase an all-wool family
blanket for $5, an article that formerly
sold at $7 50. And so it is with ail the
stock in the big Market-street store. Re
ducedâ reduced more than one-half.
For less money than was ever known
beiore you can get ribbons, laces, silks
fancy goods, underwear, hosiery and do
mestic articles. A word to the wise has
always been sufficient. In these advanced
times a hint should answer fie purpose.
That hint is: "Cunin, 911-913 Market
street, jast above Fifth, is retiring from
business."
AMONG THE AETISTS.
Portraits of Well-Known MÂ«>nâ Arthur
Atkins Ooing Abroad to Study.
Fred Yates has just finished and placed
on exhibition at Vickery's three excellent
portraits â one of Dr. Wood, U. S. N., one
ol General \V. H. L. Birne.s and the other
that of William Greer Harrison. The
portrait oi General Barnes goes to the Bo
hemian Club.
Au exhibition of paintings by Arthur
Atkins was recently held at the studio of
Bruce Porter. The paintings by Mr.
Atkins were all of California landscape,
and in point of color so exquisite that a
great future is predicted tor me young
painter. He plans to leave for Europe in
May to comrannce his first tuition. What
he has already done has been accom
plished without any direct teaching, and
so complete is his art that Yates, Porter
and others trust that his directness of
seeing in his own way will be unimpaired
by any school he may choose to enter.
It is remarked that ail of his landscapes
have found purchasers, which testifies to
the taste of tlie community. Older artists
encourage him to continue in the way he
has begun. Mr. Yates commends the
teachings of Mr. Ruskin, that "the great
est thing a man does in this world is to
see a thing and tell in a plain way what
he sees,"
Belonged From Custody.
The Chinese laundrymen who were arrested
Friday for violation 01 a health ordinance pro
hibiting them from using their mouths in
spraying water upon clothes, which was con
sidered detrimental to the health of their cus
tomers, were released from custody yesterday.
The cases were called in Judge Low's court,
but it was pointed out thai the ordinance had
not been published nor printed on posters and
postt-d as the lew directs, so the Judge dis
missed the cases.

hear and act tor the needs of the valley by
the sea.
It was demonstrated to the School Di
rectors that a new school building is
needed on Seventh avenue and Clement
street for the accommodation of the in
creasing number of children now attend
ing the Richmond School. This, witn
the children wuo will in the course of a
few months be boused in the Maria Kip
Orphanage, a block distant, convinced the
Directors of the justice of the claims of
the committee, and as a result a building
will go up immediately alter ihe com
mencement of the next fiscal year. In the
meantime additional classrooms will be
added to the Point Lobos Scboolhouse,
which will temporarily relieve the crowded
condition otthe Richmond School.
following this victory one has been
pained over the Park Commissioners by
that body spreading a coat of macadam
on Point Lobos avenue from Central to
First avenue.
Last, but not least, First avenue from
its northern boundary at the Presidio to
Golden Gate Park has been let to con
tractors for pavement.
The biock between Jackson and Wash
ington streets, which has somewhat of a
steep erade, is to be pay.d with basalt
blocks, and from Washington street to
Point Lobos avenue wili be coated with
bitumen. The thoroughfare from this
point to Golden Gate Park will be mac
adamized.
The contractor, under his agreement,
binds himself to keep the road in good
condition for live years without expense
to the taxpayers'.
The Market-street Railroad Company
has at last yielded to the \ ersuasion of
President Fletcuer and ramov.'d the old
street-rails over whicti the steam dummies
ran to the park, thus relinquishing that
portioii of its franchise for the public pood.
The club at its Jast meeting requested
the Supervisors to attacn a patrol wagon
to the new police station on O'Farrell and
Devisadero streets, and aiso to place addi
tional electric liphts through the district.
The number of inhabited houses in Lon
don is estimated at about 548.300.

DR. MARTEN'S HOPES.
If the Supreme Court Refuses
His Petition He Will Go
Further.
Then He Will Urge His Cla m as an
Alien to Go Bsfore the F.d
eral Courts.
Dr. Arthur Marten's claim that he is
unlawfully confined in the Mendocino
Asylum has not yet been decided by tae
Supreme Court. In the mÂ«an time he is
taken care of at the Receiving Hospital.
His application for the annulment of
the proceedings under which he was com
mitted is now being considered by Chief
Justice Beatty and Justices Henshaw and
I Temple. The authorities in opposition,
submitted by Assistant District Attorney
I J. J. Dunne, are also in possession of the
three. By them the custom by which
per&ons have been consigned to asylums
in this State for a long time, it is claimed,
is upheld. M. M. Foote, Marten's attor
ney, insists that ail persons suspected of
insanity should have their condition in
quired into by a jury.
Marten insisted on being taken to the
i courtrooms by the two officers in whose
! cuurge he is yesterday morning, and
merely to humor him they did so. It was
with considerable reluctance that he con
sented to return to the hospital.
He wan quite talkative while at the
courtrooms and declared emphatically
that if the Supreme Court denies his ap
plication for release he wiil apply to the
Federal court on tbe ground that he is |
an alien and that, therefore, only those â 
tribunals have jurisdiction over his case. M
