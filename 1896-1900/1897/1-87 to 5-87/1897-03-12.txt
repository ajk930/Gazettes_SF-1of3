LONDON, Esq., March 11.â The Athens
correspondent of the Times telegraphs
that he has obtained from hisrh authority
the outlines of the scheme which Greece is
willing to accept pending a final settle
ment of the Cretan Question. The first
| fcrt of the scheme is that the Turkish
troops be immediately withdrawn from
the island; second, that the restoration of
order be entrusted to part of the European
fleet co-operating with the Greek army,
which wiJl act under a commander of the
joint forces, senior of Colonel Yassos;
Hard, insurgents submit to the powers;
fourth, that after three months a plebis
cite be had to decide whether autonomy
be established or the island be annexed to
Greece; and fifth, that the powers imme
diately induce Turkey to withdraw part of
her troops on the GreeK frontier, Greece
to â withdraw her troops in the same pro
portion.
The Times says that the Government
retards the chief danger as being on the ;
frontier. Both tfce Greek army and the {
7jj*^.;oJien p*aÂ«antrjf*aie~3o excited that
aa outbreak may occur at any moment.

The refugees are desirous of leaving the
island, ami hare urgently requested that
means be furnished to enable them to
reach Smyrna. Sir Alfred is in favor of
this, end has advised that vessels be fur
nished to carry refugees to the desired
port. He sneaks highly of the conduct
of. the leaders of the insurgents, who, he
declares, actÂ»d most honorably, and sev
eral times actually risked their lives to
compel their followers to observe the
pledges they had given.
It has oeen learned that reports to the
effect that the insurgents at Kandamos
were keeping up a continuous tire upon the
town were incorrect. There was merely
desultory rifle fire, which did lit
ile, if any. damage. The Mos
lems who left the places were, it ap
pears, allowed to depart on the promise of
Sir Alfrei Biolotti that they would not
be allowed to attacK the Christians in
other places, and it is perhaps due to this
promise that Sir Alfred so heartily con
curs in the desire expressed by the refu
gee? to leave the island..
If they are compelled to remain here
it is believed that Sir Alfred will find it
difficult to restrain them from again
taking up arm* against the Christiana^
The Moslem civilians were deprived of
their weapons after reaching .-eitno. but
the Turkish soldiers were a:. owed to re

correct. At any rate the insurgent lead

w;ll prove to the world that they know
how to behave like civil people.

LONDON, Eye. March 11.â In answer
to inquiries at the Foreign Otfice the au
thorities state thai there is no hitch
among the powers In regard to their ac
tion in accordance with the terms of their
ultimatum to Greece, but the delay is dne
to the lact that the compromise offered by
Greece in reply to the note of the powers

In the House of Commons this evening
Sir Witliam Harcourt a?ked the Govern
ment if it was true that Greece was pre-
area to recognize the autonomy of Caete
and the suzerainty of the Sultan.
The Right Hon. George N. Curzon, Par
liamentary Secretary of the Foreign
Office, said in reply to Sir William that
Greece had made a communication to the
Government on the subject of Crete and
that this communication would be laid
upon the table to-ncorrow. He added
that Sir William's question did not ex-

The officials in Salonica, Macedonia and

and mules teloacing to the Christians in
those places. Tney have received orders
from Cons*antinople to collect next year's
taxes n advance. This fact, in connec
tion with the loss of their property, has
caused despair among the Christians and
much di -con tent amorr: the Mussulmans.
A Â«Uspaccli'~i?om I\-me iv the Daily
says .hat Admiral CtfuÂ«raro, the Italian
admiral .who is in command ot the com

the necessity of landing troops' to quell
the rebellion in the interior of the island.
The Italian Government, after conferring
with the Governments of the other powers,
has therefore decided to send a force of
troops to Crete. . , , .
In answer to inquiries at the Foreign
Office the authorities state that there is no

The King is reported assaying: ''Greece

case of Bosnia, when the Bosnians Chris

The King also said thai the Greek troops
would remain in Crete and protect Turk
and Greeks alike. His Majesty com

HO SOT tXVLCI A. CONFLICT.
But Should One l.niii', the Greek* Mould
Jinmily Capture Conetantinopte.
M. D. Vanvaies said yesterday that be
hardly expected "grim-visaeed war" be- !
tween the nations over the crisis in Crete.
He believed that the sentiment of the
European people would not permit the
i power* to proceed to extremes in protect
j ins Turkey against tne legitimate de
j mands of Greece.
If 'he powers would only allow Turkey
' and Greece to settle their own differences,
in twenty-five days after a declaration of
war the Greek army would be at Constan
tinople. It was all very well 10 talk about
the immense numerical superiority of ttie
; Turkish forces. Thee who resorted to
' tuis argument left out of their calcula
! tion? the factor of domestic discontent, â â 
; which, in the event of war arising, would '
rapiiiiv disintegrate the Ottoman Empire. ;
In Macedonia, in Bnlgaria. in Servia, in i
: neariy all the interior provinces, and in â 
1 Constantinople itself, there were thou- â 
! sands of Greeks who would avail them
; selves of the approach of the Greek army
* to create a revolution.
"1 ere are fully 15.000 young Greeks in
j Constantinople," said Vanvaies, "and they
are always prepared to rise aeainst the
Government."
Then again, the Turkish army, though
large, is notoriously discontented. The
I soldiers are ill fed and ill clothed, every
: man Deing a rep.ics 01 sir John t aistan s
j Watt of "ragged exterior." Such forces
| as ihese are not inspired by any over
j whelming spirit of patriotism or p*rsonai
: devotion to the interests of a tyrannical
master, and this indifl-rence will greatly
aid the GrÂ«?e*- in ttie event of a conflict.
"The Sultan," said Va:iva!es, "cannot
afford to remove the entire army to the
frontier for fear of an iniernai rising,
which will inevitably ensue In case of
war. He will be obliged to split it up in
every direction, and oefore he realized the
sitnation the Greek army wul be investing
his capital."
Vanvaies also believes that the Greek
army has been underestimated. It was
recently stated tuat about 16,000 troops
had been ordered to the Turkish frontier.
"I have no doubt," said Vanvaies. "that
tne King has purposely originated this
report, an J allowed the powers to think
that his resources are smaller than is
really tne case for very obvious reasons.
"Tne Turkish Government is bankrupt
and cannot continue the struggle for any
lensth of time. Of course Greece is not
very rca either, but it must be remem
bere 1 that tuere are many wealthy Greek
merchants in various pnrts of Europe who
would not hesitate to finance tne Greek
Government s.io:: 1 the neces ity ariÂ«e."

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 11.- By
an evidently prearranged programme
Long Green Lawrence was in contempt of
the court whicn he selected and specially
imported from Wooaiaad to hear tne ha
beas corpus matter in connection with the
Senate contempt commitment. His of
fense was permitted to go unnoticed
through the tacit consent of Judge
Hughes and the oversight of the attor
neys representing the State.
Dejpite tne fact that the specifically de
fined purpose and very essence of a writ of
habeas corpus is that the body of the
prisoner be brought into court at the time
the hearing is set the faker-in-cbief of the
faking m narch bad the assurance not
only to absent himself from this city at
the time waen tie should have beÂ«n
brought into court by the Sheriff, but took
him?eif away to San Francisco.
There crÂ»n be no question that this ac
tion should have worked a forfeiture of
the baii of the prisoner. The failure of
the Judge to lake cognizance of this fresh
contemnt of the Kxaminer's m&nazisg
taker was, to say the least, an exhibition
|of disrespect on the part of the Jud^e
' toward the Senate of the State of Califor
nia and a debasement of the dignity of t:iiÂ»
bench, in view of the importance of the
matters at is-ue, that was both unaecet
i sary anÂ«l unseemly.
It is customary in cases of this kind for
j the Jndge in opening the proceedings to
â¢ make inquiry of the Sheriff whether he
j has complied with the order in the writ
and has brought the prisoner into court.
In this instance, however, this formality
was dispensed with and the very existence
of the absent prisoner apparently for
! gotten.
Thoush the scene of action had changed
from the Capitol to the City Hall of Sncr.%
meitto interest in tne bribery investiga
tion and the contemot offenses incident
thereto bpÂ«i not abated in the slightest
degree. When the court openerf tne at
tendance packed the courtroom and laige
numbers haa to i?atis!y their curiosity by
waiting in the corridors until the proceed
ings were concluded. Their patience was
not taxed long, for the entire affair â both
sessionsâ did not occupy thirty minutes.
In the Senate investigation committee
the courtesy was voluntarily and without
request extended to tfce Examner people
of being allowed counsel. In return for
this Generous consideration on the part of
the Senate the Examiner's attorneys did
nor have the grace to see tbat official no
tice was given tbe Senate of the habeas
corpus proceedings, and for this reason a
postponement of the bearing bad to be
tasen unttl to-morrow at 10 a. m.
It was only aft-r the first session of the

Hushes called th â¢ court to order at about

The time set for tne hearing was 1 :30.
A few minutes before that hour Garret
McEnerney and A- J. Clunie, attorneys
for the prisoners, accom pan by L L.

their seats at the desK provided for at
\ torneys. The spectators looked ia vain
for the laker-in-chief of the Examiner.
Jud?e Hughes made bis appearance

his seat announced that he ad invited
Judges Hunt and Hart to sit with him.
Hart, however, dirt not appear, and iba

and Hunt.

that the court was in session were ever
AlcEnerney stated that be tbocgnt it ne
cessary to have a re urn of the writ tiled,
unless certain matters were stipulated, as
there bad apparently been some misun
derstanding in reference to the service of
the writ.
, District Attorney Ryan, explaining first
that be did doc appear as attorney for the
Senate or any of the parties interested, iaÂ»2
formed the court that he thought the Sen
a c should have an official notification of
the matter, and that a lik courte>-y
should be extended to the Attorney-Gen
eral. He suggested that the Sheriff should
notify the Senate.
McEnerney, addressing his honor, re
marked that the Senate in its wisdom had
uriitred these men into the custody of the
Sheriff of Sacramento County. He stated
that the writ as issued by the court was
d:rected to both the Sheriff and the Ser
geant-ai-arms, but that the latter ha 1 pre
viously delivered the prisoners to the
Sheriff. .For this reason, he declared, it
was not the duty of the petitioners to
notify the Senate or the Attorney-General
of these proceedings. He added that on
Tuesday Senator Morehouse gave evidence
on the floor of the Senate that he had
knowledge of the writ having been issued.
He then continued as follows: 'If your
Honor thinks proper we should give more
notice than this, we are here to obey the
directions of your Honor concerning the
matter."
To this Judge Hughes replied as follows:
"1 mink both sides should be represented.
Wluie it is noi the practice of courts to
t-erve notice in cases of this kind, this is
an important matter and some notice
should be served on the other side.
1 he court will direct tue clerk to place in
the hamls of the Sheriff a notice to be
se.ved on the presiuent of the Senate, and
so 10 the ijenute through the president,
that A. 11. Lawrence and L. L. Levinas
liave been brought before this court on
habeas corpus on the allegation that they
are illegally restrained of their liberty,
and the matter will be taken up at 3:30
r. m "
iiiEnerney jumped at the opportunity
ior s-ecurmg iurther delay and freedom
ior his clients. He suggested that this
was raiher *iiort notice.
Diotrict Attorney Ryan Interposed with
a timely buguesion by stating that this
no. ice snould be served and that if the
time was considered too short the ether
side could so state when they appeared
later.
McEnerney at this point endeavored to
muke capital for the fakers and at the same
time carry favor with the Jud-ie, by aiatinc
that B8 a preliminary matter and in jus
tice to himseif and his associates and the
court he wisaed to call attention to the
fact that con iderable exception had been
tuken to the admission of the prisoners to
bail.
Judge Hunt remarked that that was
some ibing tttat the court would take up
later.
McEnerney informed tbe court there
was a witness present, in tlie person
Deputy Cierk McCraney of the Supreme
Cuuit, who would testify that this was me
practice of the Supreme Court. On the
t-ugges'.ion o> AicEnerney the witness waa
ordered to appear when the court con
vened later.
Ciunie asked that the time be made 4
o'clock. The cot.rt consented, and ad
journment was taken to thai hour.
Promptly at 4 o'cocK Judge Hughes
opened coun by a k;iij; if both sides were
retdv 10 proceed. Assistant Attorney-
General W. H. Anders.'ii arose and ad
dressed tne court as follows: "If the
court piease, in this matter the Senate
pa.-sed a resolution this afternoon request
ma the Attorney-General to appear on its
behalf and represent them in this matter.
Tiie Attorney-Gem ral is absent and knows
nothing of this resolution. I attempt d,
on my part, to communicate with him,
and was informed that he had left his
office lv gan Francisco and gone home un
weil.
. â¢ "Out of regard to the Senate I have
- concluded to appear here with Judge
' Tost, one of the deputies, to represent the
Senate in this matter. But we only re
ceived this notice a half hour ago and of
course are not prepared to argue the mat
. ter just at present. I have consulted with
â  the attorneys for the petitioners and they
have agreed to let the matter go over until
10 o'clock to-morrow morning. The At
torney-General, it has been repeatedly
held by the Supreme Court, has nothing
to do with habeas corpus mailers; they
are said to be local affairs and that it is
the duty of the District Attorney to con
duct them. We will appear, however, in
.accordance with the resolution of the
Sena c. '
To this Jud^e Hughes remarked: "The
court was informed that shortly after the
.issuance of the writ in this matter the In
vestigating Comru ttee o: the Senate, the
â members of the Judiciary Committee and
oilier members of the Senate were notified
of the issuance of the writ, and also that
some one connected witn the Attorney-
General's office had been notified. This
was deemed sufficient, but the Sheriff was
al-o instructed to serve the notice; the law
.requires a speedy bearing of the matter,
but as the time was short since serving of
the notice, I think the request for a con
tinuance is reasonable."
Witness was notified to appear in court
at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning without
-any further subpena, ana adjournment
.until that hour was taken.
EXPLAIN THEIR ACTS.
Georare W. Baker and W. F. Herrln
Testify Before the Assembly In
vestigating Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 11.â The
Assembly investigating toruraitiee re
ceived corroborative evidence this after
noon of the fact that the Examiner's
libelous c arge of legislative bribery was
founded upon rumor.
George W. Baker and W. F. Herrin, the
men for whom t lie Examiner bad shouted
the most loudiy, were there, having come
at once to Sacramento as soon as they
learned that the committee wished to
take their testimony. They told what
they knew of Caniinetti's bill, and their
evidence was in line with that which was
produced heietofore. It was simply to
the effect that Mr. Baker wr.s the attor
ney lor the Lquo:-dealers' Association ;
that the association wanted the bill
passed in o r der to protect them from the
bias of prohibition Judges in prohibition
districts: be cau>ed the bill to be intro
duced ; that he went to Alvinza Hay ward,
knowing that Mr. Hayward was a client of
Mr. Herrin, and requested Mr. Hayward
to use hi? influence with Mr. Herrin to
in turn use bis influence with Senator
Moreiiouse, who was a schoolmate of that
gentleman.
Mr. Herrin'a testimony was to the effect
that he was not at ail interested in the
bill and did not wish to be, but that in
order to oblige his client, Mr. Hayward,
lie wired Senator Storehouse to cease his
opposition to the oil until he had an
opportunity of seeing him and explaining
the matter. Mr. Baker said that the
president of the Liquor dealers' Asso
ciation instructed him to introduce the
bill. Mr. Baker said that he did not come
to the Capitol with a circus wagon, an
elephant and a bras* band, to advertise
the fact that the l quor men had a bill
before the Legislature, because ho had a
fair and just bill before the Legislature
and it was beaten for the reason that it
was a liquor measure. Men indorsed for
office by that association were supposed to
be. opposed to any measure unfriendly to
the liquor interest. It would be im-
Bossible for him to get any bill through
the LÂ«egis ature if it was known that the
lquor-dealers were behind it, and for that
reason he had not spoken to a member of
the lobby, nor to any one whom ttie
association had indorsed, for fear that if
they came forward the bill would be
defeated by that -act.
Clunie, kicking his way out of the snow
slide, camo smilingly into the cross-exam
ination. He thought that a pleasant
place in which to cast lis fishine lines
was the office of the L quor-dealers' Asso
ciation, and he wanted to know if the
liquor-dealers would not send their books
up to Sacrnmento for his inspection. Mr.
Baker quietly responded that ha denied
the rigut of Clunie to inquire into the
private affairs of his clients.
Mr. Valentine said that absolutely
nothing had been presented to the com
mittee to show ttiat there wa3 any found
ation for the Examiner's charges. "Mr.
Clunie has sat here for nearly two hours
in the hope that he would get on to some
thing," added Valentine, "but he has ab
solutely failed to bring a single iota of
evidence that would throw any lisrht on
this charge made by tne Examiner. This
latter prjposition is ridiculous and ab
surd and we have no time to fritter away
on it. If the gentleman is s-incere in his
desire to assist this committee in ascer
taining whether or not there are members
of this Legislature who nave been bribed
be shouid direct bis inquiries to that
point."
Clunie smiled an Examiner smile, which
the same is an unutterable thing founded
on rumor. Chairman Belshaw remarked
that it did not make any difference who
presented or prepared the bill. That had
nothing to do with the ca<-e. The proposi
tion was, Had any member of the As
sembly Deen bribed?
Mr. Baker went on to say that he had
spoken about the bill to C. I). Lane, j
Alvinza Hayward, Assemblyman Cami- j
netti and Senators Langford and Voorheis. !
He mijrbt have talked with Assemblyman \
Dibble, but he was not po*i:ive as to that. |
He had asked Mr. Dargie to see Assembly- j
man Leavitt about the bill. He had also
sent a telegram to Mr. Herrin in relation
to the matter.
"Will you consent to the production of
that telegram?" a^ked Ciunie.
Mr. Baker was quick with his response.
"1 will, if the Examiner wi:l consent to
the production of its telegrams relating to
th;Â«biH."
Mr. Baker smiled, as he thought of the
vaiuabie mine of information that would
be developed if the Examiner's telegrams
showing how the libel was cooked up
could be produced. Mr. Ciunie smiled
also, but did not consent.
Mr. Baker went on to say that Senator
Morehoaso had mnde a very virulent at
tack on the bill, cvi ently under a mis- |
conception as to its object, and he had I
asked Mr. Hayward and Mr. Crss(not|
the Assemb<y man by that name) by tele- |
graph to S6e Mr. Herrin and request him j
to use his influence with Senator More- ;
house to cease his opposition. After the i
bill had passed Mr. Baker told Senator j
Morehouse that lie had been altogemer ',
mistaken in the view he had taken of the
bi.l.
W. F. Herrin was sworn and made his
statement in a straightforward manner. He
sail that he had no correspondence what
ever with any member of the Assembly,
but he had sent to Senator Morehouse the
telegram which had been published in
The Call. Alvinza Hay ward was a client
of his, and Mr. Hay ward and Mr. Baker
had asked him to help the bill. In dis
cussing the bill with the two gentlemen
named Mr. Herr.n had understood its pro
visions to be thai a person could get a
change of venue merely on making an
ailiuavit tnuL the Judge was biased with
out further showing.
"1 thought ihat was wronc," said Mr.
Herrin, "uud I stated my objections lo
Mr. Hayward, who had taken Mr. Baker's
aide ot the argument, and Mr. Hayward
said ti:at if such a law existed when the
Hale & Xorcrosi case was tried he could
have secured a fair judgment. I told him.
that no case would justify the passage of
a Dad law."
Mr. Herrin went on to tell how Mr.
Baker had named several Stales in which
a similar law was in force. He himself
had sent no telegraiu3 with reference to
that bill to any member of the Assembly,
and wittj the exception of Alvinza Hay
ward he had no client interested in the
bill. Mr. Hayward's language was that
Mr. Baker had come to his cilice and in
formed him that Senator Morehouse was
opposing the bill, and Baiter was very
anxious to have Mr. Herrin ask the Sena
tor to cease his opposition.
Mr. Herrin replied to Mr. Hayward: " 'I
don't like to interfere in this matter or
have anything to do with it. Ii is a mat
ter oi no interest to me, and I would
rather not have anything to do with it.'
Tnen Mr. Hayward 6aid, 'I wish you
would,' and he was so emphatic in that re
quest that J said, 'Very well; I will do
what I can,' and I sent the dispatch.
"It is a common saying without any
truth whatever that the oouthern Pacific
Company is behind this bill or ihatâ at
least the Examiner says so â and it is for
that reason that 1 didn't want to inteifere
in the matter; but Mr. Hayward asked it
as a personal favor, and that is why 1 did
what I have te i;;i â¢â¢; to. I attached no
importance to the Hale & Norcross aui:.
The probability is that after the Supreme
Court has got through with it there will
not be very much lle t in the way of a new
trial. 1 have Known Senator Morehouse
for fifteen years before I became connected
with the railroad company. We had been
youne men together, and therefore I felt
that 1 couid K>k him to do me a javor."
The committee adjournett until 9 o'clocK

I.EAVITT HI. />> JHE LIE.
Takes f ace f pi ion to Mint the Assembly- '
man front Atnador Sayt.
SACRAMENTO, Cat,., March 11.â As
semblymun Leuv.it constructively called
Assemblyman Caminetti a liar in the As
sembly chamber this afternoon and virtu
ally challenged him to tight with or with
} out deadly weapons.
.Leavitt was not rebuked. A little thing
j like that does not raffle a feather on the
i decorous breast of the Assembly, which
! has become a Catherine almost as dis-
I orderly as a ward caucus in Sacramento
j when "the air is darkened with clenched
j tisis and living cuspidors.
The disgraceful and not very common
! episode took place in the progress of &
j discussion on certain proposed amend
ments to Senate bill No. 507, authorizing
I the State Board of Harbor Commissioners
to set aside a space on the City front lor a
public market. Clark had offered an
j amendment designating as to locality for
the frÂ«Â»e market a portion of the water
! front"not.now producing revenue to the
i State."
I Shanahan made a heated speech, in
! which In charged that United States
! Senator Perkins was attempting to mo
| nopolize the water front of San Francisco.
Norm of Alaraeda contended that the
â¢ Southern Pacific Company was trying to
| grab eisriit or ten acres of the City "front.
Slianahan denied that ie was a railroad
I bill. It was for the benefit of the farmers
i and fruit-growers of California.
Leavitt said that he was glad to see the
gentleman from Shasta rise in bis seat
with righteousness of sprit, "but," added
, Leavitt, '"when he stops to consider tliat
: the majority of this House voted to send
j the Hon. George C. Perkins to the United
I States Senate tney believed and knew him
I to be an honorable man, and 1 say that it
; is a most outrage ous,uncalled-for and con-
I temptible attack upon an honorable
, gentleman. 1 '
I "I deny the attack," shouted Slianahan.
Then Caminetti mixed up in the rue
â¢ tion. He steppe out into the aisle and
| blinking his ringer at Leavitt shouted: I
! "You were against Mr. Perkins before the
; caucus and your own papers said that you
! were."
Leavitt, white . with passion, brought
| his clenched list down upon the table and
: exclaimed: "I desire to brand the state
! ment that I was against George C. Per
' Kins be. ore the caucus as a he pure and
j simple, and any man who says so is a liar.
! I ask that my words be taken down."
Then he added something about being
willing to meet any gentleman who might
take exce-puon to his brand, in any
j manner, at any time and at any place.
Instead of being called to order, Mr.
I Leavitt was applaudeJ.
Price of Sonoma informed the Assembly
j that the farmers' institute of that county
i had signified to him its de-ire that an
! amendment should ue made authorizing
the Harbor Commissioners to also set
aside a free space for commission men.
This amendment was denounced by the
agricultural members as designed to give
commission men clii es tree, of rent and
I would be equal to the destruction of the
' free market.
The amendment was voted down an I
an amendment by Shanahan was adopted
changing the words "commission mer
' chants" to agents.

HAVANA, Cuba, March 11 (via Key
West, Fla.), March 11.â Monday night a
band of wsll-known Cuban patriots en
tered the strongly fortified town of Be
jucal, in Havana Province, sacking all the
stores of the Dlace and burning fifteen
houses. Details are lacking.
It i- also reported that another party of
rebels, commanded by Castillo, captured
the town of Qaivicin, aud burned several
houses of the place.
The Dr. Ruiz incident is still occupy
incthe attention of Consul-General Loe.
Spain has ordered a fresh investigation of
the fact^ of Ruz' death, but General Lee
is quoted as saying that he does not clearly
see how the investigation can be properly
carried out. No witnesses will testify
aeainst Major Fondeviela or the warden
oft ejail, for they could only do so on
lear of their lives.
Personal friends of General Lee affirm
that as soon as he shall have settled all
ihe pending matters ho has on hand and
got them ia proper shape h3 will resign
his i ost and return 10 the United States.
A letter received from Santiago de
Cuba, dated the 4:h inst., refers to an in
cident which shows the utter lack of con
sideration which the Spanish authonties
have with the representative.! of foreign
powers. By order oi the Chief of Police
the house of Robert Mason, England's
Pro-Consul and acting Chinese Consul,
was thoroughly searched, ' but nothing
was found oi a compromising nature. Mr.
Mason was not present during the search,
and as soon as he heard of the outrage he
at once reported the fact to the British
Consiul-General, Fred Ramsden, who
called on the civil Government and ample
( apologies were given on the spot.
The Judge of the court at Guanabacoa
has ratih-. d tiie action of the Spanish an
tboritics in imprisoning Charles Scott, the

This means that the case will continue
under the ordinary procedure until it is
finally disposed of.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â A dis

municipal safe.
The Spanish garrison resisted for two
hours, but after losing all hopes of re-en
forcements fortified itself in the church,
leaving the town defenseless. T. Â© Span
ish losses are reported to be very heavy.
Two trains have been blown up with

BPAMSH CRVELTX IS MEXICO.
O fliers Itut/lntj Ears** -Narrowly
H* rapid flÂ«inj Mobbrd.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â A sen
rational story reai bed this city to-day, on
the Ward line steamship Yucatan, of an
uprising on the part of the people in the
Mexican city of V.era Crul against five
Spanish officers, who are there buying
mules for the use of the Spanish army in
Cuba. The details are vouched for by an
American citizen who arrived on the
steamship, and who was in Vera Cruz on
the night of the occurrence. This is
the story:
In all the Spanish cities on thÂ» Mexican
coast there are colonies of Cuban refugees.
The tales of these unfortunates about
Spanish cruelties in Cuba have aroused
the laggard Mexicans to a great state of
indignation against the Spaniards.
Just before the Yucatan left Vera Cruz
five Spanish ofheers from Havana reached
there. They were well supplied with
money, and came to purchase horse* and
mules for the Spanish troops in Cuba.
While in the public market one afternoon
several littie Mexican boys surrounded
them, and with yells of derision greeted
the strutting Spanish officers. One of the
latter, a ran nearly six feet tall, lost con
trol of his temper and brutally kicked one
of the boys in the stomach.
. The little fellow groaned and fell to the
ground. ,â¢:!< :-
Immediately the market-place was in
an uproar. Blankets were , thrown from
the shoulders of the sleepy Mexicans and
machetes were unsheathed. The Mexi
cans were furious at the Spaniard's as
sault on the boy, and with blazing eyes
started in to avenge it.
The Spaniards fled for their lives to po
lice headquarters. In a few, minutes the
whole town had heard of the outrage, and
a crowd of several hundred indignant citi
zens besieged the station. The police
force of the town, fearing that "the popu
lace would overpower them and get pos
session of the Spaniards, called oat the
militia, and it took the whole garrison of
the Vera Cruz station to keep the augry
citizens in check.
Ail night long the Mexicans hung
around the prison, and the next morning
tiie Spaniards conducted tneir business
wr lii in- horse dealers surrounded by a
company of Mexican soldiers. When
they left the next day for Havana they
were also under police protection.
The Yucatan also brings news from Pro
eresso, Tampico and other coast towns in
Mexico of the great jubilation among the
Cubans and Mexicans there at tbe an
nouncement of Consul-General Lee's re
quest lor warships in Havana harbor.
The Mexicans are becoming more in sym
pathy with tbe Cubans every day, and
General Lee's request of the State Depart
ment is construed as the forerunner of in
teresting international complications. Tbe
Cuban colonie i in al! these cities bedecked
their headquarters wi:h the 11 igs of Cuba,
Mexico and the United States on the re
ceipt of the news.
SHOT BY MISTAKE.
A Cleveland Merchant Walked at Midnight

Monal y Wounded.
CHICAGO, 111. March 11.â Bullets
fired by police officers and Pinkerton
watchmen in pursue of a burglar struck
Albert Zeixnex of Cleveland, Ohio, mer
chant, and he is at the County Hospital in
a dying condition. The shooting took
place shortly after midnight thi morning
in Plymouth place, opposi'e the Great
Northern Hotel, where Z* nier was a
guest. He left the hotel at 12 o'clock for
a short vtroil before retiring. He walked
about 300 feet south in Plymouth pace,
and was returning to the" hotel when a
'hief, pursued by several policemen and
P.nkefton watchmen, dasheu past him.
Five or six shots wore fired at the fleeing
burglar by the officers in pursuit and
Zeimer was in range of the builet-. Two
of the leaden missiles struck Zeimer aud
he fell to the eround mortally wounded.
An hour ait r this exciting incident in
Plymouth place a policeman found the
body of a man propped up against the
Marshall Field wholesale house, Madison
and Market streets. A bullet had drilled
a hole in his aldomen. In h'S pocket w.is
found a letter cdUrcsed to "G. B'.ack, 109

It is supposed that the dead man was
one of the burglars sho' at by the police
and wounded by an officer* bullet. The
burglar who dashed past Zeimer was
caught aud gave the name of Otto Rei
mann.
SOMETHING DRASTIC.
Trouble Threatens Between Passenger As~
sedations and the Southern Pacfic
on Immigrant Commissions.
CHICAGO, 111., March 11. â The old
question of payment of commissions on
immigrant transcontinental business,
which seemed to be in a fair way to be
settled by the recent action of the South
ern Pacific, has assumed ita original
troublesome phase.
The Southern Pacific and its connecting
lines have been paying, for a long time, a
lar.er commission on immigrant business
from the Atlantic seaboard than is allowed
by the Western Immigrant Clearing
house. The Southern Pacific has been
repeatrd y pressed to reduce coninn sions
to an equality with its coiupetiturs. Re
cently it agreed to equalize such comm.s
sions if its connections would agree, and
the trouble which threatened the stability
of transcontinental passenger raus was
regarded as practically settled.
Now the Pacific hns notified
the j'ssociation that its Eastern connections
have reiu-ed to join in tue equalizing
proposition. In consequence Cnairman
Caidwel! has called a mt-eting of compa
nies representing the Wi siern and Con*
linental Passenger As?oe ations, when
drastic measures are expected lo be taken.

Union Pacific Railway to operate its own
telegraph lines in place oi the Western
Union Telegraph Company, W. W. Fear
| one, general counsel for the Western
Union, said to-day:
"The intention of the decision is to
compel the Union Pacific to observe that
purt of its franchise which provides for
its operating a telegraph line. There is no
intention to discriminate i gainst the tele
graph corporation. It i* fair to presume
mat the court order will make reference
to equity. We own most ol the wires and
practically all of the instruments on the
Union Pacific line. It is scarcely nroiable
the court will compel the Union Pacific to
build an entirely independent sy>teni. It
is more likely the Union Pacific win oper
ate the lines, hut will handle messages
delivered to it either by individuals or
other telegraph companies."

The Haverueyer interests also announced

WASHINGTON, D. C. March There
was a noticeable diminution this morning
in the oiiics-seekinjr forces that have
marched 0:1 the White House since the
new President entered it.
Bright sunshine and balmy air made it
a day to be spent outdoors, rather than in,
and this may have had some effect upon
the people who want to nerve their country.
Many gentlemen were willing, bowever,
to sit for hours in the closely filled corri
dor t at leads to the President's
room, in the hope of gelling nis ear.
But the Teal reasons lor the slump
in attendance undoubtedly arc thu new
rules for the reception of visitors, and the
bints that the President has given out
that he will not give much consideration
to the smaller office-; until the tar ff bill is
in a fair wav toward final disposition.
Then, again, he has had little time to
wr te the message to De sent to Congress
next Monday, and it is a mater which
cannot wait, while office-seekers can.
Several men of Drominence, who had â 
nothing to ask ami nothing to expect from
the administration, dropped in to pay
thi'ir respects this morning.
Among them were Senator Stewart of
Nevada and Iteprcsensativ-? Catcbings of
Mississippi, one of the Democratic leaders
in the House. Dr. de Witt Talmage came
with hn daughter, and Was followed by
Archbishop Cnappelle of Santa Fe,
escorted by Delegate Catron of New
Mexico.
The venerable Senator Morrill of Ver
mont was among the early visitors.
Other* wbo came were Senators Cullom
and Mason of Illinois, Spooner of Wis
consin and Flatt of Connecticut.
Tne two Micni^an Senators, McMillan
and Burrows, came to aslc the President
to reappoint General Spaulding of Michi
gan io the position of Assistant Secretary
ol the Treasury, formerly held by him.
Senator Mason presented the'names or
four of his constiiu ntsfor Federal posi
tions. Huntintiton Wi.son of Chicapo
wants to be becretary of Legation at
Paris; the well-known Thomas a. Needles
is aiier the Indian comniissionership;
Prolessor Lowry would like to go abroad
in a diplomatic or consulaÃ-capacity, and
Mr. Elliott of Chirago is an app icant lor
the position or Assistant Attornev-Generai.
Representatives Licey of lowa and
Hopkins of ll.inois swelled the rather
thin contingent from the lower house,
while ( f Senators thrre was a host, in
cluding Wnlcott, Penrose, ElKins. Chand
ler and Fo>-aker.
Senator White or California, (Chairman
of ihe D mocratic National Committee)
dropped in to p y his respects. Ex-Sena

SQUABBLING OVER THE RULES
FOR THE FIGHT.
S:ler, Stewart ard the Pugilists'
Managers to Me t and Settle
the Controversy.
C ARSON, Nev.. March 11.â Bob Fitz
simmons came in from Cook's ranch again
this morning and was in higher dudgeon
than he lugged in with him yesterday.
Bob. was' not roaring about Referee Siler
ard the rules 10-day. Indeed, he had
quite forgotten both in his excitement over
a new derangement of his passions.
"I consider that I have been bunkoed,
snd I will have what is coming to me or
somebody will be mane to feel uncomfort
able," said Fitz as he swung into Carson
street from the penitentiary road with the
pace of a greyhound.
"That's just what's the matter," re
echoed Martin Julian, who was trudging
along in the wake of ihe Cornishman.
Fitz was halted ana asked for an explana
tion of his tantrum. He told an interest
ing little story, the theme of which was
how he was "done up.'' It appears that
tho.lanky boxer had been inveigled into
"standing in" with the so-called exclusive
Examiner-Journal combination to furnish
tnem with a little story about a meeting
( n the highway near the penitentiary
with Cor.bett. The s:ory was to go on to
relate how, when the big boxers, who are
:o battle for the world's championship
text Wednesday, met, Fitz waike I up
and proffered his hand, the Californian
scorned it and said be would not shake
with the Cornishman until after the 17th
oi March. More conversation of a bantÂ«r
:;iz nature was to be incorporated in the
story and all of it was to be exclusive.
"Well, as Bob is under salary to supply
the combination with daily jottings as to
â ;e eat?, the time he retires and what i
lie tb inks about when lie feels like think- j
in fact with almost anything except i
â¢ a'l news of the day â he readily as
sonted to the scheme. But he did not i
know when he agreed to this that Corbett
i.tl already received the neat iittle sum of
$500 for the part he was to play
in the comedy. Bob found out about
it e.irly" this morning and in conse
quence â¢he forgot all about training
and everythine elÂ«e but the fact that he
had been played for a ''sucker," as Julian
explained it. Fitz's objective point upon
arriving in Carson was the Examiner-
Journal headquarters, and upon arriving
the.c he -and his brother-in-law. Julian,
opened up their safety-valves and Jet po
all of their reserve steam. When they
reappeared upon the sidewalk their coun
tenances plainly indicated that "some
thing had been doing," if I may be per
mitted to steal a phrase Jrom slangdom.
"Well, did you get $500?" asked a news
paper correspondent, addressing Julian.
"You bet your life we did," replied the
pood-natured little manager with an ex
r>an<nve grin. "If we hadn't something
would have dropped. I guess we will
etahd for that story now."
Fitz was chuckling, too, and remarked
sub rosa that any old story would go with
him for $500. Corbett's consolation, also,
is the money he received. He seems to be
somewhat sheepish over permitting him
self to be drawn into such a cheap affair
and says that this will be his last part ci
pationin a prearranged farca for the bene
fit of the two newspapers that can't get
news in any other way.
Jim denies that he agreed in advance to
go but and hunt up Fitz-immons so as to
have a quarrel with him, but he does ad
mit that he went to the prison yesterday
morning at the suggestion of the F.xam
iner- Journal people. He also laughingly
confesses that he knew that Fitzsimmons
was in the habit of traversing the prison
road each morning at about the very time
he would reach there. And he has an
ii her comical admission to make, and
â¢ his is to the effect that he was paid to
fiwÂ»ar by any story that was printed in
reference to the alleged meeting on the
highway.
Jim is left in a rather funny position all
round on account of this yarn, but the lad
with the pompadour is clever and an
adept at drollery, so I guess he will wrig
gle out of it all right. It appears that he
told all of the correspondents last night
that he <lid not meet Fitz on the prison
rpad, but instead missed him by about
five minute-. But with $500 in his trousers'
pockets to-day Jimmy essayed to squaro
h;ms If and issued the following an
nouncement:
Newspaper reporters saw me yesterday and
rsked ratr if I had met Mr. Fitzsirnmons near
tfie. Nevada State Prison while taking ray road
exercise. I told them ihai I had not met Fitz.
I now want to brand this statement as an un
truth. My reason lor deceiving the reporters
Â»' to carry out a pledge of secrecy I had
given others. I regret very much that I was
compelled to misrepresent, but I never break
faith wish anybody. James J. Cokbett.
Few people can be found in Carson who
believe that Corbett and Fitz met at all.
It was a good chance for a fako story,
however, and $1000 will go a lone way
toward putting the finishing touches on
most any fake, even including the pro
curing of signed statements and all. A
strange feature about the affair is that
none of the guards who patrol the walls
of the prison and who have a clear and
unobstructed view of the country for miles
surrounding the gloomy structure, could
see the meeting between Corbett and Fitz
-8 masons, despite the fact that they are
armed with ttrong; field glasses and that
the collision is supposed to have taKen
place under their very noses. They could
not have been very vigilant yesterday
morning.
One of these guards, however, objects
to the imputation tnat he was snoring
while the two greatest pugilists ii the
world were supposed to be on the verge of
thumping each other within a stone's
throw of him.
This guard is M. V. Cecil. He told me
to-day that Fitzsimmons passed over the
road at least fifteen minutes before Cor
bett left the prison, an. l was nearly out of
sight when Ibe California a and his train
ers started fur Shaws Springs. Ana Cecil
is only one of them.
The wrangle over the rules to govern
the coming battle, given out yesterday by
Referee S.ler, has by no means subsided.
Frz seemed to be somewhat submissive
last night, but to-day he is kicking again
and threatening not to fight unless ho is
allowed to Lave something to say as to
what rules shall govern. Dan Smart,
although by no means a well man, risked
a rel:ipse to-day by drying all the way out
to Cook's ranch for a taik with the Cor
d is tins aft.
The good-natured Texan told Bjbthat
it was his desire to have everything po off
smoothly, even if only for the good of the
sport itself. But at the same time lie was
not inclined to tolerate an.' quibbling
over trifles. Fitzsimmons was not in
clined to compromise, however, and in
sis;ed that Siler's early announcement of
the rules gave Corbett the advan of
perfecting himself on clinches and break
away hitting.
Stuart finally suggested, as a way of
reaching some sort of an amicable agree
ment, that a meeting take place to-mor
row to be attended by Martin Julian, rep
resenting Fitzsimmons, William A. Brady,
Corbeti's manager. Referee Siler and
Stuart himself. This seemed satisfactory,
and it was decided to hold he meeting at
Stuart's quarters at 3 p. m.
It does not seem probable, however, that
this conference will result in any material
change of tlie rules as they now stand.
With one or two uifling exception-* they
are the original Maiquis of Queensberry
rules.
Siler considers that they are as fair to
one of the principals as to the other and
will scarcely agree to any amendments.
Stuart, too, think* the rules, as they have
been formulated an I given to the public,
should stand unchanged. As Corbett is
satisfied with them Brjdy will vote for no
alterations, so it will possibly be Julian's
voice alone against all of the other?.
The Corbett people claim that Fitz
simmons is by his hair-splitting maneu
vers showing the white feather. If he is
the great fighter that he claims to be, they
say, be should not be afraid to light under
the pure, old, unadulterated rules. These
were good enough for fighters before him
and should be satisfactory to him as well.
"I am aware of what Fi iz is ud to," said
Billy Delaney to-day. "He wants that
clinch-hitting clause eliminated so that
he will have a chance to lose the fight on
a foul. He realizes that he is in for a
beating under the regular rules, and he
wants a chance to wriggle out, so that he
can shout after the fight th at he was not
fairly whipped. If clinch hitting is barred
he will be the happiest man in the coun
try. Then he will have a cnance, when he
finis that he is losing, to hit Corbett in a
j clinch and have the referee decide the
I fight on a foul. Jim does not wish to win
the contest that way. He wants to lick
this fellow outright or else get licked him
self."
There is a quiet rumor going around
that somebody has a scheme on loot to
have the rine; in which Corbett and Fitz
simmons are to do battle smaller than the
articles of agreement call for. I:i carry
ing out this scheme the plans for the arena
were not adhered to. They provide for a
platform twenty-eicht feet sq tare to ac
commodate the twenty-four-foot ring and
its necessary braces, but it has been dis
covered that this p!:Uform, which is al
most finished, is only twenty-four feet
square itself, to that the rins wouia Lave
to be less than twenty-two feet.
It has always been said that Fitz likes
a small ring, but whether this shortening
of the platform was done for his benefit
or not it is difficult to sny. It may have
been only a mistake after all, and in view
of the fact that Billy Brady, Corbett's
manager, has discovered the mysterious
shrinkage, the chances are that the plat
form will be altered so as to accommo
date a regulation twenty- four-foot ring.
George Green, professionally known as
"Young Ccbett," who is training at
Empire for his contest with Mysterious
Billy Smith, has met with another mis
hap. While "-purring with his trainer,
Bob McArthur, yesterday he hit the latter
on the head and severely sprained his
right thumb. George will be compelled
to ease up in his work in order to give the
injured member time to get back into
siiape. Ail of Empire had a laugh yester
day at the expense of Green and Mc-
Arthur. There is a big mill near their
training quarters, where the tailings from
the Con. Virginia mine are being worked
over. These tailings are conveyed to the
mill from a distance of nearly two miles
by means of a sort of trolley system of
moving buckets.
Green and his trainer hied themselves
just before noon to the dumping grounds
and jumping into v bnrKet started out for
a ride to the millâ to tr p the troliey, as it
were. They tripped along merrily for
about h;:lf a mile, and were just passing
over a deep ravine when the 12 o'clock
whistle blew and the machinery operating
the trolley came to a sudden stop. There
was no possible means of escape, and
there was nothing to do but to stay theie
until 1 o'clock. In the meantime D;il
Hawkins, Jimmy Wiggins, Billy Lyons
and "'Spider" Kelly amused themselves
by pelting snowballs and rocks at the
dangling and discomfited athletes.

NEW HAVEN, Conr., March 11â The
end of the "Corbett Club at Yale" inci
dent is not in sk-nt. More university
organs to-day officially repudiated the
action of sending the Yale Hag to Corbett,
as far as Yale is concerned. The under
graduate and alumni body are a unit in
demanding a signed, public retraction by
the senders of the message to Corbett
The Yale Alumni weekly to-day con
tains an editorial which concludes:
â¢'There is no escaping the conclusion that
Yale will get, ns the result of the letter,
an increased reputation as a sports' para
dise. The sending of the flair was a good
deal worse than the sending of the letter.
Nothing can excuse or extenuate the act.
Perhaps all the signers were not partici
pants in it. From a decent standpoint of
college loyalty it was an act of treason.
We do not know at this writing what may
be done in the way of repudiation of the
act. But the miscnisf has been done. In
another issue we shall comment on ttie
re-enforcement by this incident of the de
mand 'or some protection of the great

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 12 f 1597.
Barry and Bob Armstrong, arrived in
Denver this afternoon en route to the Pa

Carson and witness the coming tight at
that place.
"As to the coming fight," said Davies,
"I will say this, that my sympathies are
with the American. All things being
equal, and the men in good condition, it
seems that the heavy-weight ought to
win. Judging from the preparatory work
that they are doing now, it seems both
are in earnest and a grand battle is as
sured.
"In going to San Francisco my idea is
to get up a match for Armstrong and
Jpffries. A large number of heavy-weights

Anthony, tre Australian feather-weight
champion, is at present in San Francisco.

"In regard to the condit on of pucilism
in this country now, there have been times
when more interest was taken in it; tut
I dare say that if this coming battle turns
out to be a grand contest there will be a
revival of interest sweeping not alone over

FITZSIMMONS- MCCARTHY.
How the Antlpodeans* First Battle
In This Country Was Won.
Old members ol the defunct California
Athletic Club will not soon furget the first
professional appearance of Bob Fitzsim
mons in this country. Bhortiy after his
arrival from Australia he was instructed
by the president of the ciub, Lem Fulda,
to get into condition as quickly as possi
ble, as he might be called upon at a day's
notice to enter into a passage at arms with
some unknown. Fnzsirumons did not
bar any man, as he was only too anxious
to maKe a few doilars at the time, iia7ing
pockets to mend.
Billy McCarthy, a countryman of Fiiz
xinimons, was training lor a contest with
Keddy Gallagher of Denver. The latter
was taken ill and refused to meet Mc-
Carthy uniess the match was postponed.
The club would not grant a postponement
ami the directors had a consultation with
McCarthy and Fitzsimmons, which re
suited in the consummation of a match
between that pair. Fitz^immons had
only a ;ew days to train in, but he seemed
in splendid condition when the day of the
battle arrived.
The betting favored McCarthy, as he
was then looked qduh as being the best
middle-wei ht in the country. The match
was for a $1200 purse, and was won by
Fitzsimmons.
In the first round McCarthy sailed in to
give Fitz immous a sharp argument, but
the long feilow kept putting h.s left fist
in Mac's mouth until the latter stopped
rushing. McCarthy was busy with his
hands, but all of his attempts to land fell
snort.
In the second round McCarthy tried
some oi his old tric-Ks, but Fitzsimmons
was on to his game, and would not fill
into a trap. Fmal;y F.tzsimmons look
the aggressive, and drove his opponent
a 1 around tne ring, administering left
jabs on the face and right-handers on the
nb. McCarthy landed one good upper
cut in a rally near Fr.z- minions' corner,
but he received hard punishment in re
turn.
In the third round the long fellow lifted
McCarthy off his feet with ieft punches on
the chin no iess than three times and,
McCarthy, who was as gritty as a gume
<â â¢ cK. came bp.ck for more punishment.
Fitzsimmon^ realize i What a thoroughly
game fel.ow be had belore him and he did
not force tne battle.
In the fourth round McCarthy came up
fresh and rushed at Fitzsimmons, fighting
for the body in a most determined man
ner, but a left on the mouth and a warm
ri^ht on tt c e;ir stradied him. He was
floured twice Jater on, and his face began
to look like a raw stoat. Fitzsimmona
finally stooped over in such a manner as
to be hearl by McCarthy. He said: "Mac,
quit, as I don' i want to hurt you any
more."
But McCarthy would not think of such
a thing acquitting in the ring. From this
on the contest was nwfuliy one-sided ; in
fact it was only a question how long Mc-
Carthy would r-tand the ternlic bombard
ment on his fnce and body. Although
his face was covered witn blood he kept
swinging at Fitz^immons, In the hope ot
landing a knocKout blow, but the long
Teilow easily avoided the swings and
waited an opportunity to put McCarthy to
sleep.
Finally in the ninth round the oppor
tunity came and Fitz-timmons put his big
right duke on Mac's chin and the battle
was over. McCarthy fell in a heap and
actually left the bloody imprint of his
body on the floor of the ri n Â«r. Before get
ting the poncb that g;ive him h s quietus,
McCarthy was downed three times, and
once Fi'.z^immons sent him through the
ropes and caught him by the arm in t.me
to save him from falling off the stage to
the floor.
When taken to his corner McCarthy
wanted to resume the battle when lie re
covered his equilibrium, but Captain
Douglass onlerea all men out of the rir.g,
and Fuzsinimons hpd earned iiis tirst I
American dollar by being declared the
w.nner.
F-tzsimmons handel McCarthy $300
after ihe battle, as the latter was '"Hai

Long Bob's next fiaht of note was against
Jack Denipsey, the champion middle

F.n.illy Ac JDurns.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â Cooper
Union scarcely ever contained a larger,
more enthusiastic or a more thoroughly
cosmopolitan audience then crowded its
space to the doois to-nipht to give expres
.-i >n and approval to the ratification of
the arbitration treaty now pending in the
United States Senate.
The hnll was tastefully decorated with
flags and bunting, the colors of all na
tions being displayed in conspicuous
places throughout. Prominent represen
tative New York citizens were represented
on the lists of (signers of the call for the
meeting.
Mayor Strong presided as chairman and
delivered a brie? speech, in which he said:
'â¢We are called to give our indorse
ment to that expression of one of the
greatest military men of his time, 'Let us
have peace.' We want that peace, not at
the point of the sword or at the mouth of
the cannon, but by arbitration. It would
be impossible to draw up a treaty that
would please all citizens; but the best
citizens of all parties and all creeds join
in advocating the present treaty now
pending in the Senate."
Hon. Seth Ltw was introduced as the
first speaker. He said: "International law
is binding on the Nation. There is no
tribunal in existence to enforce interna
tional law. Such a thing as systematic ar
bitration. is unknown. It is a great thing
when two nations say. 'We will not go to
war for live years.' This treaty is the be
ginning of a new era in spreading law.
Without the details the treaty itself suould
make it acceptable 10 all."
The speaker then spoke of the work of
England in advancing civilization. "Our
mission is the same," he said. "This arbi
tration treaty streucthens the chances of
the two Anglo-Saxon nations to walk
hand in. hand together in advancing civ
ilization."
Hon. Charles S. Fairchild then read the
following resolutions:
Whereas, After long and pa: lent negotia
tions a treaty for the arbitration, within
specified limits and by specified methods, of
matters in difference between .the . United
States and Great Britain was signed on the
11th day of January last by the respective
plenipotentiaries of the two nations; and
whereas, the United States has always been
an earnest advocate of international arbitra
tion; and whereas, the proposed treaty, which
Is for the trial , term of only, five years, i*
marked throughout wittk great conservatism
and 1 aution ; thereforu'
. Resulted. That In accord with our fellow
citizens 'throughout the land, we respectfully
petition our, National Senate for the ratifica
tion of the treaty n.< signed by the representa- j
tives of â¦he high contracting parties. . v i
Resolved, That â â we heartily ' concur In the
declaration of our honored Chief Magistrate,
that "the treaty presents in â  the word the
glorious example ol reason and psace, not
passioa aiid war, controlling the relations be
tween two of the greatest nation? of the
world an example certcin to be followed by
others." And in his further unqualified dec
aration that, "the importance and moral in
fluencu of the ratification of such a treaty can
hardly be overestimated in the cause of ad
vancing civilization."
As the chairman was about to put the
question 011 their adoption William H.
Lynn rose and asked to be heard. Per
mission was given and Mr. Lynn made an
address which fairly set tho audience
frantic. , As he progressed in his speech it
looked very much as if any moment a riot
would be begun. The cheers as he spoke
were at times deafening and completely
drowned the .hisses which came from
those in the front row. The police were
unable to cope with the crowd and stood
helpless while those on the platform grew
white and red in the face by turns and ex
citedly jumped to their feet, one after the
other and tried to interrupt Mr. Lynn.
He said: "Before adopting the resolu
tions we should stop and pause. Who
wants this arbitration? '
H9 then went on to say that England
had broken the treaty of 1812 ami raised
trooj s and built war vessels for the Con- |
federacy during the Civil War and so again j
broke her treaty.
"The spirit of New York is against such
resolutions. [Great cheer?.] I c:ire not
lor the depreciation of securities; I care
more for the depreciation of American
patriotism. We can have no peace with
the robber nation, England. To-night
the Greeks are defending their humble
brothers in Crete, while England with
arms and guns is forcing that unfortunate
leople by coercion under the Turk. [Ap
plause.]
â 'A treaty with a Government that has
pcimitted the Armenians to be .slaught
ered by thousands [applause |; a treaty
with a nation that has broken every obli
gation and violated every pledge of honor
she ever made! [Great applause.] We are
a peaceful Nation and we will maintain
that, peaceful attitude with honor that we
have always maintained. [Applause.] We,
ask no war, but in the words of the great
Washington, which this call does not in
corporate to-night, 'We seek noentenglinz
alliance with foreign nations.' [Applause.]
A treaty that upon its face reads rive
years means forever." [Applause.]
Mr. Lvnn proposed the following reso
lutions 'for a substitute for those already
presented. t Â'". â .-,,,â â â .-.â¢â  t; Â»''-â "
Whereas, The United States, following the
sage advice ot George Washington and the
fathers o! tne Republic, lias ever avoided en
tangling alliances with European powers, and
pursued Us piith in peacelui progress untram
meled by treaties restricting iis beneficent
interest in the Western Hemisphere; ;and
whereas, the Monroe doctrine is the practi
cally accepted code of international law pre
vail, ng on this continent; and whereas, the
arbitration treaty, no* vending before the
Senate of the United Stales, is so lacking in
clearness of language and so complicated in
construction as to ii.volve danger of a re
versal ot the tlrae-aonored policy of Washinc
ton in the setting aside of thu Monroe doc
trine; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we. citizens of New York, in
mass-meeting assembled, respectfully urge
upon the Senate the unqunlified rejection oi
said arbitration treaty with England.
Great applause greeted the reading of
these resolutions.

Mayor Strong as chairman, jumped to
his feet and said :
"Feliow-cit.zens : This is a country of
free [applause], and when my
friend a ked for the privilege of the plat
form I yielded to him with the greatest
pleasure. [Applause.] He must ?auare it
with his own conscience thr.t, having ac
cepted an invitation to attend a meeting

treaty, he has spoken against its ratifica
tion. [Hisse?.] There is no reason in tho
world why our fellow-ciiizens of New
York, who oppose the ratification of this
treaty, should not have the.r own mee f
ing. [Applause and cheers.] But 1 pro
test that it was never yet and it never can
be proper to come to a meeting called for
one purpose and try to twist it into an
other.
"I must, therefore, decline with great
regret, bnt most peremctorily decline, to
accept the amendment to the resolutions.
[Renewed applause, mingled with loud
hisss?.] Fair play is a jewel, gentlemen.
I will call upon the Hon. John de Witt
Warner to address the nieetineand then I
will put the question on the resolutions

ing, and then we willyclos-e by singing

cheers. |
Mr. Warner said: "There have been one
or two questions asked which, even at this
late hour, it is perhaps well should ba
answered. Tiie gentleman inquires who
asks for this treaty? It was the Contrress
of the Unite! States, our representatives
in both tranches, who unanimously,
eagerly, urgently naked for it. I am, if
possible, even less imbued with any friend
ship for Great Britain as a political power
than the gentleman who preceded me, but
I wish to say we have triumphed over
Great l) r i:ain. I want to sland here and
say we have achieve;! our end and taken
Great Britain into enmp for a prisoner for
ever and ever."
The Jai t*Â»r part of Mr. Warner's address
was completely drowned by catcalls and
hisses and the ball throughout was in the
greatest confusion and uproar. After the
noise had somewhat ceased, Chairman
Low said: "We will now vole on the
resolutions offered by the meeting. All
those in favor, say 'aye.' "
A loud cry of "aye" was at first heard and
a pleased expression came over Mr. Low's
face, as he no doubt imagined that Mr.
Warner's speech bad turned the tide.
With a smile 0:1 his fare, he asked for the
"noes." The cries that lie received were
deafening and completely outdid the
"ayes." Men jumped to their feet, wav
ing their ha'.s an-1 shouting at the top of
their voices, and cried "no, no." Not
withstanding this lact, President Low
said that the "ayes" had it. The band
was then ordered to play "My Country
'Tis of Thee," but was completely
drowned by the shouts and hisses of the
audience.
At tbe close of the playine and while
t lie band was in the midst of "Hail
Columbia," the lirhis were suddenly put
out and the meeting closed.

the ratification of the treaty before the

Venezuela* Confirms Will Ratify the
Irmti/ With Great Britain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 11.â
An unsigned copy of the Venezuelan
treaty was sent to Caracas for the informa
tion of the Ministry a fortnight ago. A
Spanish translation of the treaty, signed
by Sir Julian Pauncefote and Senor
Andrade, was mailed on the 7th inst. and
will reach Caracas on Saturday of this
week. It will be laid by President Crespo
before the Venezuelan Ssnate on Monday
next. Under the ruies of the Venezuelan
Congress all bills and treaties are dis
cussed on alternate days for a period of six
days in order that members who were ab
sent the first day may have an opportun
ity of participating in the debate, while
the Senate generally may have the addi
tional time in which to consider and di
gest tho matter under discussion. The
treaty will thus reach a vote on Saturday,
the 20th insi.
All the advices from Caracas indicate
its approval by the Senate by a practi
cally unanimous vote. This result is fore
shadowed by the press of the country .-md
by the utterances of public men. The
presiding officer of the Senate expressed
his gratification at this peaceful solution
of a very serious international question â
a soluiiiin which he regarded as a triumph
of right over wrong. The opposition pa
pers i:i Caracal still criticize certain pro
visions of the treaty, but maintain that
notwithstanding tiie objections it ought
to receive the approval ot the Senate.
, After the treaty lias had a similar ap
proval from the British Parliament ratifi
cations will be exchanged in Washington
between S.r Julian Pauncefote and Senor
And rude. Wittiin the three months fol
lowing their exchange the tribunal of
arbitration will endeavor to select the
fifth member of the board, failing in. which
the apuointment will be made by Kins
Oscar of Sweden. The evidence will then
De submitted to the arbitrators, and the
live members will not come together unt 1
next summer, year, wben. they will meet
in Paris prepared to settle the points at
issue. Meanwhile diplomatic relations
between Great Britain and* Venezuela,
which have been suspended for a term ot
years, will be renewed.

Xcliinley Sehrdute Ad opt id. by the Ways
and '.''.!!)Â« Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 11.â The
McKinley schedule on wools and woolen
was substantially adopted to-day by the
Republican majority of the Ways and
Means Committee.; Some important
changes were made in classification, with
a view of meeting the objections of the
wool-growers to the use of cheap wools
imported at carpet rates under the Me-
Kinley law for clothing purposes. Other
than there little change was made.
The new classification takes out of the
description of wools of class 3 China
lambs' wool, E yptian and Mori ceo
wools, and one or two other elasse , trliich
are declared by the growers to be avail
ab'e lor clothing purpose*. The rates on
the three classes are the same as those of
the McKinley law â 11 cents on wool of
class 1, which includes the merino trades;
12 cents on wools of ciass 2. which in
cludes tne English anil Canada wools,
camel hair and alpaia hair; and 32 per
cent ad valorem on wools of class 3, cost
ing 13 cents or less per pound, and *50
cents ad valorem on such wools costing
more than 13 cents.
The pnrnfjraph of the McKinley law im
posing double duty on washed wool and
tbret- times the u'lwr.shed duty on scoured
wools, imposing 30 per cent per pound on
NEW TO-DAY.

Their Invasion of the Southern City
Is Viewed With Aiarm by
the Authorities-
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. March 11.â The
persistent warfare which is being waged
by the police authorities of San Francisco
on Chinese lotteries and other gambling
is having the effect of adding largely to
the Cninese population of this city.
A gentleman formerly with the customs
service at San Francisco arrived here
to-day. He recognized on the train four
of the most notorious highbinders of the
northern city. They were accompanied
by eight Chinese gamblers, and the entire
party left the train at the Commercial
street depot. Ti is gentleman said:
"The police raids on the Chinese gam
blers of San Francisco ha i had a tendency
to decrease the Mongolian population.
The gamblers and other toughs are fleeing
to Los Angeles, and 1 have no hesitation
in saying that at least 150 of the worst
Chinamen of San Francisco hare come to
this city in the last fortnight.
"This influx is bound to result in
trouble, and I predict that inside of ten
days there will be a demonstration of the
character of these und-sirable new
comers. These fellows have made no os
tentatious announcement of their coming,
but are here for no good purpose."

The Ex-Governor of lowa Greaily Enjoy
ing a California Trip and Will Come
to San Francisco.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 11.â Ex-
Governor Horace H. Boies of lowa, a
Democratic politician of National reputa
tion, is now domiciled in this city. Mr.
Boies enjoys the distinction of being the
only Democrat elected to the gubernato
rial chair in lowa for more than thirty
years. He is a discreet, able and positive
man. He had a Btrong following from
several of the Western States for the Presi
dency in the last Democratic National
Convention.
He is nere on a pleasure trip, and is
greatly enjoying his visit to Southern
California. He is particularly charmed
with the climate and the country. The
green fields, the abundant flowers and the
balmy atmosphere combine to create con
ditions in strong contrast to those in his
own State and otner Eastern States at this
time. Mr. Boice had the nonor of leading
the Democracy oi his State to victory In
1892.
'â¢lowa is having its share of the hard
times," said Mr. Boies, "but if the times
improve it will reaj the benefit?. Tne
outlook for business is very much better
now than ithai boon for some time and
commercialmen look for steady improve
ment. The financicl policy of the new
administration is to be given a fair chance
by the people, and if it brings prosperity
to the country we will rejoice. It is too
far ahead to predict what the Democracy
is likely to do in 1900"
The ex-Governor will visit the principal
points of interest in Southern California
and will then go to San Francisco. He
pronounces President McKtnley's Cabinet
one of the cleanest and ablest ever known
in the history of the Nation.

arrests were made to-day in the mysteri
ous shooting case of Mrs. Caroline
Bragg, who was wounded in the
head yesterday by a bullet fired
while she was asleep, and while
her adopted daughter, Josephine, was in

under arrest, aim the police theory is that
she has a guilts' knowledge of the affair.
In an interview to-day the wounded
woman said that some unfortunate man
wished to marry Josephine and get her
property, which strengthens the theory
of the police that there was a man in
volved in the shooting. Mrs. Bragg has
made a new will disinheriting Josephine.

DISAPPEARS FROM
HIS SHASTA HOME
B. F. Roberts, a Prominent
Citizen, Missing for
a Week.
Leaves Bella Vista for Mont
gomery While a Snowstorm
Is Raging.
Fi-ars That He Perished in the Bliz
zird or Was Drcwn d or
Murdered.
REDDING, Cal., March 11. âB. F.
Roberts*, one of the most prominent citi
zens of this county, has been missing from
his home since la*t Friday. Mr. Roberts
was formerly assistant Postmaster here
and has occupied numerous public offices.
He resided with nis family near Bella
Vista, about eight miles from thi3 city.
Last Friday he left his home for Mont
gomery Creek to organize a lodge of
Patriots of America. A severe stoim was
raging at the time of his departure. He
I was last seen on the road near Ben Jen
j kins' farm, on North Cow Creek, some ten
1 miles from his home.
It be^an snowing heavily that evening,
and it is supposed that the traveler became
bewildered, and, losing his way, was lost
in the snow and perished, or was drowned
in one of the swollen streams.
The missing man was expected home
on Sunday, but he did not return.
His family was not particularly alarmed
at first, as they thought he might be de
tained from returning by the storm, but
| when he failed io return by Monday they
began to think that something was wrong.
On Tuesday his son Herbert rode up to
Montgomery Cr.-ek and learned that his
lather had not reached that place. Her
bert returned homo on Wednesday and
gave the alarm.
Several searching parties were immedi
ately organized to hunt for the missing
man, but no trace of him has been found.
Mr. Roberts was for many years one of
the most p-ominent schoolteachers in this
county. He was assistant postmaster in
this city under the lute John N. Major,
and for the pa^t eight years has been en
| gacred in farming on Cow Creelc.
He was a well-educated man, a great
student and a writer of considerable local
prominence, being a frequent contributor
to the local press at Reuaing.
A good many entertain the opinion that
he has bf en murdered, but no motive can
be attributed for the perpetration of such
a crime.
FROM PRISON TO JSILUM.
Miles Peterson J>o( Guilty by Reason of
â¢i'.v : ':i\~ Insanity.
REDDING, Cal., March 11.â Miles Pet
erson, who has been on trial the past
week in the Superior Court of this county
for the murder of John Sutherland at
Castelia last July, was to-day found not
guilty by a jury of his peers.
The celebrated case went to the jury at
5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, and 1 this
morning at 11, after being out 18 hours,
the jury returned a verdict of "Not guilty
by reason of insanity."
A large crowd assembled at the court
houso at an early hour, in fact many had
remained there over night, such was the
interest over the case.
The prisoner appeared leaning on the
arms of his two brothers, who had been
constantly at his sido during thre prog
ress of the trial. He bore a careworn and
forlorn appearance, and showed plainly
the siege had been a seyero strain on his
system.
When the jury first came in they stood
eleven to one. How they stood as to con
viction or acquittal was not known. At
this the prisoner sank in a dead faint and
was removed to the Sheriff's office, at
tended by hi* counsel and brothers, until
the jury had further deliberated. In ten
minutes they returned with the verdict of
not guilty.
Captain Dozier, counsel for the defend
ant, was entirely overcome, and it was
some moments before he could speak. He
thanked the jury, and they closed the now
famous case.
This afternoon Peterson was examined,
for insanity and committed to the Napa
Insane Asylum, to which place he will be
taken to-night.

Silsbee fnr Collector of tne Port,
James Rusaell for United States
Marshal, Watson Parrish for United
States District Attorney, and A. C.
Yoorhies oi San Francisco for Superinten
dent of the United States Mint.
It had been generally supposed that the
retiring Congressman, \V. W. Bower.-,
would be indorsed for f.e Collector
sliip, but in a resolution he was
denounced for alleged "efforts to state
himself for tne position despite the lact
that he had worked for free silver and

M. Kuichin, editor of the Tribune, now
in Washington working for appointment
as fourth Assistant Postmaster- General,
calling him a "renegade traitor, who hail
done all in his power to disrupt his party."

tee, attacking 'he Union for its report of
the proceedings and accusing E. S. Bab
cock, a committeeman, of lying when he
reported having received a letter from
Austin Goodman of Cincinnati which
stated that Bowers bad said be was slated
for a position.
Bowers has, however, the solid indorse
ment of the California Congressional dele
gation for the (Joilectorsliip, and is prac
ticaily sure of appointment. To a United
Press reporter to-day Bowers said:
"i nra satistip'l irom inforuiation re
r-ivert while in Washington la-t week that
Mr. Kutchin will receive some high gen
eral appointment from the administra

Cattle Thrown Overboard From a Nearly
Foundered British Steamer Owing io
a Scarcity of Water.
LIVERPOOL, Exg., March 11.â The
British steamer Lake Winuipeg, from St.
John, N. 8., February 14, arrived here to
day, having consumed twenty-five days
on the voyage.
Her commander, Captain Taylor, re
ports having had one of the roughest
voyages in hia experience. The heavy
seas, which washed over the ship, partly
filled her engine-rooms with water and
shifted her cargo, making it necessary to
call upon the passengers to help remove
the water and right the vessel.
For more than two weeks the ship's hres
were out, and owing to the scarcity of
drinking water and the failure of the con
densers to work it became necessary to
throw overboard 370 head of cattle, 74
sheep and 2'l horses.
The officers and crew of the Lake Win
nipeg, as well as the passengers, of whom
there were twelve on board, agree that the
ship narrowly escaped found ring, and it
was with the utmost difficulty that the
great quantities of water which flooded
the shiD as the sens broke ever her and
put out her fires were kept within the
limits of safety to the vessel.

these incredible assays can hold up, but
the opinion of careful mining experts who

The ore can be milled on the spot for 75

OREGON MURDER SUSPECTS.
Arrested for the Brutal Killing of a
Car.by Saloon-Kaepsr One N ght
Last May.
OREGON CITY, Or., March 11â Peter
Grinerand Louis Rogers were arrested near
Canby and brought to this city this even
ing on the charge of murdering Conrad
Neiberc, the Canby saloon-keeper who was
kilied last May. The complaint against
the prisoners was made by Milo Lee of
Can by. Constable McCowu made the ar
rest of both men, though he kept them
separate and neither knows of the arrest
of the other. Neither of them made any
inquiry as to the nature of the charge pre
ferred.
1 here is said to be a strong chain of cir
cumstances connecting the prisoners with
the murder of Neibert, but the officers are
not willing to matce the story public yet.
It is understood that the men liave pro
fessed some knowledge of the affair, and
hav3 told conflicting stories when ques
tioned about it. Griner is a woodcutter
who has been working on the west side of
the river near Canby. Rogers has a Mnall
ranch on Canby prairie, where his family
live*. He hiis been convicted of offense^
that give him the name of being a nard
man.
Neibert was called by two maskad men
to his saloon door after he had locked ii
and was closing his establishment for the
night. As he opened the door the men
tired and fled. Neibert was shot through
ihe body anJ died the next day from the
wound. It was a very mysterious affair,
an<i suspicion has been directed to various
persons connected with other misdeeds,
but nothing more tangible than suspicion
lias developed to connect anybody with
the commission of the crime.

"The indications are that the yield of
barley and hay will be nearly double the

soil the grain has a splendid start. Wi:h
the warm weather of ;he coming mouths
the prospects could not be bettor. Had it
not been for the recent cold spell the
growth would have been too dense. The

out and it necessitated replanting.
"If we have much more irost, however,
there is no telling how much duraace will
be done the early fruits. The almonds
and apricots will suffer most. There is
an almond orchard among the foothills
southwest of here that has already been
seriously damaged by the frost.
"It is too early to form an idea as to the

not set as yet. A frost last year reduced

Those three complaints usually come to-

SEATTLE. Wash. March 11.â In a
speech to-night delivered before the
Caamber of Commerce, Congressman
James Hamilton .Lewis made known
his position with reference to
the '.'construction of the Nicaragua
canal, an undertaking which he
opposes on the ground that the "canal
would be neither a good National defense
scheme nor a treat commercial Denetit,"
and that he was "emphatically not in
favor of yielding up American rights un
der plea of commercial benefits," and that
"American people should not be cuddled,
cajoled or coaxed."
By a vote oi 63 25 the chamber adopted
a resolution declaring it to be the sense of
theÂ» body that the construction ot the
Nicaragua Canal would not b< conducive
to the commercial interestsoi Puget Sound
and the State of Washington.

It appears, according to Chr:stensen's
story, that some time ago he pot into
d.fficulty with another man which bo
came so serious that he was threatened
with a damage su.t. Fearing the law's
wrath. Christensen immediately deeded
ail his property and home to a man named
Winn, whom he knew and trusted. The
damage suit was not brought and the
trouble blew over, but Winn, in whose
name all the worldly possessions of Chris
tensen were, suddenly took dangerously
sick and was in such a condition that it
was impossible for him to sign deeds or
other instruments by which Christensen
could regain liis prop r;y.
Finally Winn, who way an old man,
passed away, and in his name, according
to Christensen's story, ths property still
remains. Winn's widow does not recog
nize the claims of Christensen, and says
the property is hers, and she intends to
hold it.
Chri-steni'en sees no way out cf the di

FIELD DAY AT STANFORD.
Entries for the Contests Between Varsity
Freshmen and the Oikland High
School.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 11.â Clare Strohn of Los Angeles
captained the freshman baseball team
which recently won the class champion
ship by defeating the juniors in a hotly
contested game. He will be one of the
strongest players on the Varsity team this
year, as he is in great form. Strohn has
played in the Los Angeles High School
team and also in the Tufts-Lyons and the
University of Southern California base
ball nines. His position baa always been
behind the bat. Strnhn will undoubtedly
play second in the Varsity, rilling the base
led vacant by S. Harris of last year's
team.
The reason for the change is that the
teim al'ea ly has a good catcher in A. S.
Jeffs. Both Jeffs and Strohn have been
tried at second, but the latter had the ad
vantage at that position. He is taking a
course in history at Sisnford and is as
good a student as he is a ball-player, and
that is saying a good deal.
The Stanford ireshnien-Oakland High
School lielrt day promises to be of grput
interest. The entries in the different
events were made out to-day by Track
Manager Brown. A similar list was re
ceived from S. H. Westdahl, track man

THE SOLDIER
OF MARATHON
A Trophy That Was Won
by California Marksmen
in September, 1877
Preparations to Celebrate the
Twent eth Anniversary
of the Event.
A Match at a Range to Be Shot by the
Survivors, Then a B nquet â Those
Who Made Up the Team.
Within a short time there will be called
in this City a meetintr of the survivors of
the members of the National Guard who,
in 1577, composed the California team
that went on to Creedmoor to shoot for a
tropby offered to teams from the guard of
the several States for the best marksman
ship.
The purpose of the meeting will be to
make arrangements lor the proper ob
servance of the twentieth anniversary of
the shoot which won for the California
team the trophy. Ten years ago the sur
vivors of the team met and celebrated the
event by a banquet at which all the mem
bers exc?pt one were present. That one
was Captain W. H. Brockhoff of Com
pany D, Second lufantry, who some time
before that date met his death by acci
dent. At that time there was reserved a
place at the nead of the table for the miss-
ing member with date turned down. It
is probanle that on the occasion of the
twentieth anniversary there will be a
shoot by the survivors, and that a banquet
will follow. Then there win be two plates
turned down, for since the reunion
Colonel John McCorub, who was the com
mander of the team and adjutant, has
passed away. Of the remaining ones of
j the team there are H. J. Burns, who at
! the time of the prize shoot was captain of
I Company E (ihe Suraners) of the First
j Infantry. Since then he rose to be
I colonel of the First and now is on the re
j tired list. Then there is Charles Nash,
who is a sergeant on the police force,
Harry Hook, who is also on the police
! force, ami Charles P. Le Breton, who is
connected with a prominent mercantile
house of this City.
The California team' was selected from
nmong the b >Â«t marksmen in the National
I Guard who were members prior to the Ist
of June, 2877. The following were the se
lections and the combined j-core at .00 and
500 yards that entitled them to place in
toe team:

The citizens of San Francisco con
tributed a large sum ot money, about
$6000. to defray the expenses of tins team,
and the soldier boy* left the City on the
30th of August for New York, which place
they reached in due lime and found that
they would have to contend against
teams from Connecticut, New York and
New Jersey. They went to practice
shortly after their arrival and kept it un
until the day before the snooting. The
match was shot on the 12th of September,
the day preceding the preat match be
tween the American and English teams at
Creedmoor, near Garden City, on Long
Island, and in which the Americans were
victorious.
The result of the match at the two tar
gets was as follows:

The victors were loudly applauded and
highly commended by press ana individu
als for their excellent shooting. Soon
after t c match the team returned to San
Francisco, bringing home the trophy, a
beautiful statuette of the "Soldier of Mara
thon," which they held for one year, not
being able to enter a further contest on
account o; lack of funds.
At the time of the shooting of that
match The (all presented to its many
readers a great stroke of enterprise. It
was the [publication of the target ot each
shooter, showing where the bullet struck,
something that had never before been
done on this coast and was done at that
time by only one newspaper in the East.
At the shooting range The Call had a
series of rule I charts or reproductions of a
target that was crossed by lines a quarter
of an inch apart and each line wat num
bered. When a shot was tired its position
on the target fired at was located on the
chart at the point where the perpendicu
lar and horizontal lines crossed, then the
perpendicular and honzontul numbers
were telegraphed and located on a similar
chart in The Call office, after which the
spot was marKed on reduced metal c arts
or targets that were ready to be inserted
in the columns of the paper.
Colonel H. J. Burn-, wbo is now the
ranking officer of the team, has requested
all the living members of the team to
meet him or communicate with him in
regard to the proposed meeting.
CAUTIOUS STEERING.
Republican Senatorial Pilots Discuss the
Problem of Filling Vacancies
in Committees.
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 11.â The
Republican Senatorial steering commit
tee met last evening in Senator Allison's
room, but no action of any kind was
taken. The members received their notices
late rÂ»nd did not arrive until the confer
ence was breaking up.
While no member of the committee was
able to offer a tangible solution to i tie
existing difficulty in connection with the
tilling of vacancies on committees it was
the general impression that no combina
tion having for its objoct the organization
of the Sanate committee* by the silver
vote could be made effective.
Several members of the committee have

consideration and i eld numerous confer

For this reason members of the commit

AGED COUPLE ASSAULTED.
Brutally Maim 3d With an Ax at N ght
and Lett for Dead on
the F oo r.
PITTSBURG. Pa., March 11.â A Greens
burg special telegram states that last
night a daring and brutal assault, that
may result in the death of two persons,
was committed about fifteen miles north
of Greensbursr.
Richard Graham and wife, an aged
couple alone on a farm, were the victims
of the assault, which bad robbery for us
object. Graham is reported to be wealthy.
Some time auring the night three masked
men forced an entrance to the houss and
knocked the aged couple senseless with
an ax. After that they ransacked the house
and left. It i? not yet known how much
money they obtained.
Mrs. Graham was partly restored and
may recover. Her husband is yet uncon
scious and in a critical condition. Mr.
Graham is about 65 years old. His wife is
about 55. It is supposed that tramps
committed the assault, although no de
finite clew has been obtained.

LONDON, Esq., March 11.â Professor
Henry Drummond, a celebrated writer on
religious subjects, died to-day at Tun
bridgo Wells. While the professor had
not been in the best of health lor some
time, still his death to-day was a irreat
blow to nis friends. Professor Druruniond
had not done any literary work for some
time. One of bis most widely re?d books
was "Tlie Greatest Thing in the World."
The general tendency of his religious
writing was cheerful and elevating, lie
never took a despondent view of life or of
the future existence. Some of his views
caused great discussions. There were
many who agreed with him, while not a
few opposed him. Professor Drummond
was of a very pleasing personality and
had many friends. His books had a wide
circulation in England, and there were
not a few readers on the continent and in
America who admired him.

HALIFAX, N. S.. March 11.â The Do

was five days overdue, arrived in port this
morning. ..
Tne Vancouver had a very rough ras
saae, heavÂ» head storms being experienced
all the way across. During two days she
made only 155 miles. A slight derange
ment of machinery also delayed the
steamer whije repairs were being effected.
The ship was frequently swept by huge
seas, but no serious damage resulted. The
cargo shifted this morning, and the
steamer had a heavy list when she came
into port. Oil was used at one time to
ca!ra the fury of the sea and it had good
effect.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
FRIDAY MAJEtCH 12, 1597
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
46 X S inches
of advertisements, which is
224 inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
The exposed hypocrite whines for
charity.
"Our bill for convict twine," says the
Examiner, "was only a little one."
The friend of the workingman supports
Lome industries and not home prisons.
The assertion of the Examiner that it
could not cci twine in the open market is
another fake.
Fake new? bound with prison-made
twine constitutes the worst kind of yellow
dog journalism.
"Cheap and nasty" is the motto of the
cur kennel pang. Cheap prison supplies
ana nasty news.
Let us provide for the unemployed free
labor and pood wages. It is only the Ex
aminer which finds a profit in having men
sent to San Quentin.
Great Britain continues to prophe?y
peace, but her action in pettine an army
corps ready for service shows that she is
staking her money on th 3 proposition that
war is coming.
The Examiner pleads that the amount of
convict twir.e it uses is small, but the
smallness of the saving only intensifies
the meanness of the transaction and the
insufficiency of its defen-e.
One by one the public libraries of
ihe country are excluding the yellow
doir journals from their readwig-roomÂ«.
The indignation of the people has been
slow i;i taking action, but it is doing the
good v;ork at la^t.
The diplomats of ttie great powers will
find before ihey get through with the
Cretan war that public opinion is after all
the greatest of powers in these days and
will have to be consulted in the settle
ment of the question.
McKiuley evidently understand? the
ways of office-seekers too well to be dis
turbed by them. He offends nobody, but
he yields to nobody, and is showing more
clearly every day that he is eminently the
rieht man in the right place at the right
time.
Whether Long Green Lawrence goes to
jail or not in this instance the Senate has
vindicated itself from his slanders by
boldly challenging the proof and showing
the falseness of the slander. A* lor the
jailing of the rascal, that is something
which is bound to come in due time.
In defense of its use of convict twine the
Examiner said 3 r esterday that it could not
obtain it ''of as good quality anywhere
rise." That is a case of lying in aid of
rascality. The local manufacturers make
as good twine as iÂ« made in Ban Qoentin,
but they cannot sell it so cheaply, and
that is why \Yastefv.l Willie patronizes
the convicts.
Never was a lie more utterly devoid of
even a sembiance of foundation than was
the lie told by the Examiner about the
"thievery in aid of bribery." Having been
given every opportunity to prove the truth
of its words the Examiner could offer
nothing whatever in tlie way of evidence.
It has been forced to resort to impudence
to hide its confusion and, to use its own
choice language, to "darken its retreat
by excreting filth."
In the prevailing harmony of sentiment
for the promotion of. home industry
and the advancement of the welfare of
California, there \u but one discordant
voice among al: the papers of the State â
one common slanderer, one maker of
Btrife, one patron of convict Jabor, one
sneerer Â»t the products of free Jabor, but
that one fortunately has now be?n ex
posed, its slanders refuted, its Dractices
revealed and its manager confronted witn
a jail.
It was bad enough in the Examiner to
use prison-made goods instead of helping
to build up the industries of free labor,
but when it defended itself from public
indignation yesterday by the lying asser
tion that the product of free labor is not
equal in quality to that made in prisons
it added insult to the original wrong and
sought to discredit the product of our
factories and the work of our people. It
is ihe duty of every good citizen to aid in
refuting the lie and in counteracting its
effects on the trade of our home indus
tries.
Governor Badd'a veto of Assembly bill
273 was lasid on minor features of the
measure and did not affect the general
character of the bill at all. In fact as the
Governor pointed out in his message a
similar bill is now before the Senate, and
he implies that it is free from anything to
which he objects and will therefore
receive his signature if it passes. There is
no need of taking up much time further
on a measure so generally supported, and
the Senate would do well therefore to
accept the new bill and go forward to
other thing*.
A CRIME COMMITTED.
From the evidence which has been gathered concerning the purchase of twine by
the Examiner from San Quentin prison it is evident that the statute of the State has
been violated. The Examiner has been delected not merely in an act of hypocrisy,
but in a criminal effense. The law of the State in relation to the terms under which
prison-made jute goods can be sold 3ays:
Section 3. All orders for jute goods must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth that
the amount of goods contained in the order are for Individual and personal use of applicant;
said aflidavit to be subscribed and sworn to before some Notary Public or by a Justice of the
Peace residing in the township in which the applicant resides; provided, that any applicant,
as heretofore provided for, who falsely and fraudulently procures jute goods under the pro
visions of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
The orders of the Examiner for twine were not accompanied by the required affi
davits. Warden Hale, in an interview with Thk Call published yesterday, acknowl
edged that the affidavits had not Deen made. The violation of the law is therefore
evident. The Examiner asserted yesterday that its offense was a small thing. It will
be for the iaw courts to decide how small it was, and whether the statutes of the State
can be violated with impunity by persons who wish to use convict-made goods with
out observing the conditions under which the Legislators has provided for their sale.
It may b? a small thing to Willie Hearst and his managers to ignore free labor
and violate the law of California, but the people do not think so. We publish this
morning from all parts of the State dispatch?* showing the indignation of the people
and their condemation of the Examiner's meanness toward free labor. The voice of
the people is for home industry. It is oppose! to the use of prison-made articles
which come into competition with the products of free labor. The judgment of honest
men is also a-ainst violators of law. The crime and the criminal are now exposed,
and it is for the courts and tne people to deal with the offenders as they merit.
SLANDERING FREE LABOR.
The Examiner yesterday made its defense of the use of prison-made goods on two
pleas. The first was that the amount of prison-mp.de goods used in the Examiner and
exposed by The Call is small. The second was that it could not get such articles "of
as good quality anywhere else. " The first of these pleas is clearly an attempt at eva
sion; the second is a direct slander upon the products of free labor and an attempt to
injure the trade of local manufacturers.
The amount of prison- made goods traced to the Examiner by Thk Call can hardly
be regarded as a complete summary of all such goods used in that office. A dragnet
investigation and an examination of the books and telegrams of the Examiner would
probably show a much larger resort to prisons either in this State or in other States
for Examiner supplies. It is, therefore, mere trickery and cunning to attempt to
escape from public indignation by alleging that the amount of the iniquity exposed is
comparatively slight.
The second plea, that the Examiner cannot obtain in the open market twine made
by free labor of as good a quality as that which is obtained in San Quentin, is a direct
falsehood. Twine of a similar character and equally good in every respect is made by
local manufacturers of California and is sold in the open market. It cannot be sold,
however, in competition with the products of prison labor, and, therefore, costs more
than the Examiner pays for the San Quentin article. It is just as good but it is not as
cheap. The Examiner, for some reason, whether of poverty or innate meanness is not
clear, prefers the cheaper article of San Quentin rather than to pay the higher price
for goods made by free labor. For the sake of the difference in cost it supports the
State prison rather than home industry.
Tbe nature of the defense made by the Examiner shows the viciousness of the
managers of that paper toward the industries of Caliiornia. Not content with ignor
ing the work of free labor and using prison-made iroods, it now defends itself by sneer
ine at the products of our home factories. It seeks to spread abroad the belief that
twine produced by free labor i 3 not of a good quality, is not worth the price for which
it sells in the market and is not fitted for uÂ«e.
The defense made by the faKer, it will be seen, is as bad as the original offen-e.
To the injury done to free labor by the use of prison-made good", it now adds the
insult of misrepresentation and slander. Noboay in San Francisco will be deceived
by the statements made by the convicted hypocrite, and we trust that its lies will be
equally harmless elsewhere. The growing; pood of California depends upon building
up home industry, on developing her resource?, on expandine ncr manufacturing
enterprises and on giving work to free men at good wages. If we permit a lying news
paper to injure the repute of the articles produced in California, we will have our
selves largely to blame if our mills are closed, our workingmen unemployed and our
industries languish, while fakers live on prison labor and profit by fakes, subsidies
and blackmail.
HONESTY VINDICATED.
Whether Long Green Lawrence goes to jail in Sacramento to expiate t ho offense
of slandering the State Legislature, or escapes by some technicality of the law, mat
ters little. It is sufficient that he was called before the bar of the Senate, given an
ample opportunity to prove his charpeÂ«, or to show that he had at least some reason
for making them, and failed utterly to do either. He has been publicly exposed as a
liar and common slanderer and the honor and eood repute of the Legislature of Cali
fornia have been vindicated.
[t goeÂ« without saying that Lawrence will mnke every effort his cunning can de
vise to extricatp himself from the position in which he is placed. At the present tise
the law has taken him in its strong arm and holds him before the Stat-Â«, while the
door of the jail stands open for him. In that position he alternately snarls at the men
who have captured him and whines to the public for sympathy, lie seeks at one
moment to defile the honorable men whom a sense of duty has impelled to grapple
with his foul charge, and at the next he pleads before the public to be regarded as a
"man of honor," who exposes himself to jail rather than betray a confidence.
It is the duty of the legitimate newspapers of California to set before their
readers a clear statement of the case in order that legitimate journalism
may not be made to stoop and be a pander to the vile and foul thing which Long
Green represents in his person and illustrates in his paper. The issue is not one which
involves in any way the liberty of the press. Long Green Lawrence made a slander
ous charge againÂ«t the members of the Legislature He was asked to prove it. He
had no proof. He offered no evidence. Ho bore himself toward the Senate with im
pudence and shameless effrontery. He did not pretend to know anything, but claimed
that if he were permitted to inquire into all the private affairs of the members of the
Legislature he conld find some evidence of guilt.
Take the story as told by Long Green himself. He says he was informed that
bribers had been used in the Legislature. His informant gave liim no facts, nor any
evidence of the charge. He did not investigate it. He obtained no semblance of
proof of it. He published it on the authority of his informant. In what position
does this story place Lawrence? If hÂ« really had an informant he betrayed the confi
dence of that informant by publishing what was told him confidentially. If now
such an informant exists and does not come forward, then he must be a coward as
well as a liar. If he were a man of any decency whatever ha would not permit Law
rence to be sent to jail for the want of vindication.
It is clear that the informant, if he exists, is either a very vile coward indeed or
else he believes that Lawrence by betrayinz the confidence imposed in him justly
merits to be left to his fate. In either ca>e Lawrence has nothing to boast of. If he
published the story without authority then he betrayed a conHdence'and cannot
claim to be acting as a man cf honor. If. on the other hand, lie had authority to
publish the story and did so without gathering any facts or investigating it, he has
clearly made himself responsible for the original lie.
The issue is one with which legitimate journalism has nothing to do beyond
the fact of pointing out the difference between the ethics of professional journalism
and the sensational fakes of common scolds, habitual liars and ssnsational sheets.
The Senate has amply vindicated its own honesty by giving Lawrence the chance to
prove his charges and showing by his own confession that be is a liar. It is now the
duty of the press to vindicate itself by showing that Lawrence does not represent
legitimate journalism and it not acting in accordance with any code o' morals known
to honorable journalists.
THE CUBAN MASS-MEETING.
The executive committee of the commit
tee of fifty-eight appointed by Mayor
Pbelan to co-opernte with similar com
mittees of other ciiies in aid of the Cuban
cause have made arrangements for a mass
meeting to be held on the 20th. This will
give an opportunity to the people of San
Francisco to show how truly they are in
accord with their fellow-citizens in other
parts of the Republic, and it goes without
saying that the meeting will be thronged
and enthusiastic.
The executive committee has wisely ar
ranged to make the meetin? a truly repre
sentative one. They have chosen for the
principal orators of the occasion V, T . S.
Barnes, Samuel M. Shortridge, Colonel
Eddy, Patrick Ready and W. W. Foote.
The weli-known eloquence of these orators
gives assurance that the sentiment and
sympathies of the City will be ably and
forcibly expressed at the meeting, and
every citizen can attend therefore with
the certainty that the voice of San Fran
cisco will be well and worthily uttered.
It is hit:h time that San Francisco
should have a. mass-meeting of this kind.
AH other iarue cities in the Union have
expressed their Bantiments on this great
cause and have organized committees to
co-operate for its advancement. It is a

potism in Havana, but American citizens
as well. The stories of insul;s to our citi
zens residing in that city and of outrages
committed on many of them have been
frequently told and are w*ll known. It
would be something less than manly in us
to tamely submit to the wrongs donÂ«s to
our fellow-countrymen, nnd we owe it to
our own self-respect and National pride to
protest against such offenses.
The date fixed for the meeting gives
ample opportunity for all arrangements
to be made for its success. From this
time until It takes place the subject should
occupy a large part of the attention of the
people. It is not an issue which can be
ignored. It affects our National welfare
as well as our sympathies with the Cuban
patriots. In every sense of the phrase it
is an American cause and rightly de
mands the support of every American
heart and the help of every American
hand.
THE GOVEBNOR'S VETO.
Governor Budd's veto of Assembly bill
273 was accompanied by a statement
which shows that he objects only to
certain minor features not essential to
the proposed measure. The main object
of the biil is to relieve a litigant from the
necessity of having his case tried by a
Judge who is biased or prejudiced against
Dim. The Governor expressly states that
a proper bill designed, for that object "is
desirable and praiseworthy."
As a further evidence of his approval
of the general principles of the meas
ure the Governor acided in his mes
sage that be bad conferred With the intro
ducer of the bill and other members of
the Legislature and they had concluded
that a new bill could be passed which
would be free from the objections to
which bill 273 was. open. Such a bill has,
in fact, been paused by the Assembly and
is now before the Senate.
As the new measure known as As
sembly bill 977 is not radically different
from tha old, and as it provides suffi- i
ciently for the object desired, it is cleany
advisable for the Senate to follow the lead
of the Assembly in adopting it rather
than to pass the original biil over the Gov
ernor's veto. There is no use in prolong
ing the session in controversies over minor
matters. There may be differences of
â  opinion as to the construction placed by
the Governor on the terms of bill 273, but
these are not worth lighting over. What
the peopie demand in a law which wiJl
give a litigant protection from a prejudiced
Judge. Tiie new bill satisfies that de
mand and should be enacted without fur
ther controversy.

THE NEW REG STERED MAIL LAW.
Ntw York Sun.
With Mr. Cleveland's signature, which was
B filled durine the present week, the bill pro
viding a limited indemnity for the los? of reg
istered letters has become a law.
That this legislation is wiÂ«e there can be no
doubt. Strictly speaking, it is not experimen
tal, since the system is in successful operation
in other countries, and there is no reason why
it should not be equally successful here. As
to its justice there can also hardly be two
opinions. Registry U resorted to sololy as a
means of additional security tor the letter or
package. The registration fee is paid us a sort
of Insurance; but if the Government fails to
give that extra security, and perhaps furnishes
even less safety than the ordinary mail wovild
have supplied, the loser seems fairly entitled
to some indemnity. The express companies
do their business on a recognition of this prin
ciple, and find their profit In it.
\Ve i;>i>e 11 1 tie doubt that, apart from the
question of equity Involved, the Government
will in like miinner find the new l--w profita
ble from a business point of view. The msxi
raum of indemnity on any single registry is
fixed at $10 and presumably the regulntions
of the Post, ffiee will be so drawn as to prevent
the payment of that maximum, if possible,
where it is uoi due. The registered mail is
now known to be one of the most profitable
pÂ«rts of the service, yielding remarkably large
net returns in proportion to the business done,
when; o:her parts are conducted either at a.
slight profit or at a decided loss. Again, the
cases in wnich registered mail pnekages arc
lost and not recovered form only a minute
fraction of the whole. It in calculated that,
even on the present basis of the registered
mail service, indemnities could be paid, witn
a great surplus of earnings.
But there is every reason for supposing that
the registered-mail business will increase us a
direct consequence of mis new law. The Gov
ernment will, perhaps, be expected to take ad
ditional precautions now that losses in tne
registered mail will be expensive for it. Be
sides the insurance, up to $10, obtainable for
a veiy small extra lee, may auraci some who
have not used the registered mail at all, be
cause it gave no such insurance. It would
not be surprising to fiud the growth in the
registered-mail business enough to pay for fc.ll,
M a great part, of the indemnities exacted.

A Weaponâ C. W., Berkeley, Cal. There Is
no State law that prohibits the carrying of
concealed weapons, but there is a law which
prohibits the carrying of a weapon or weapons
with intent to assault another. Some Judges
have held in cities where, the carrying of a
concealed deadly weapon is declared to be an
offVns-' that an unloaded revolver is a weapon
within the meaning of the law. They have
held that a revolver is a deadly weapon, irre
spective of the fact that it is not loaded.
Others have heli that an unloaded revolver is
no more than so much steel, and being un
loaded is not a deadly weapon.
, The National Guard-W. H. O. ,City. The
majority of the companies of the First Regi
ment, Second Brigade, N. G. C, formerly lo
cated in the armory corner Tenth and Market
streets, are now located in the armory at 25

Military Draftsâ P. C, East Oakland, Cal.
Draft i ethods were twice employed by the
United States and twice by the Southern Con-*
Tederacy for raising ana increasing the armies.
The first measure was introduced in Congress
in 1814. The second was by an act of May::,
1863, which had no reference to the miiitlÂ«,
But, called every able-bodied citizen of mili
tary age into the Federal service. A commuta
tion oi $300 for exemption whs permitted ami
persons relating obedience were treated as de
serter?. The unpopularity of the conscription
caused the "Draft Riots" in New York City,
July 13-16. 1863. On April 10, 1862, and July
18. 1863, the Confederate Congress passed con
scription laws levying on all persons between
the ages of 18 and 45.
Printers' Rollersâ F. 8., City. There are
different methods of making printers' rollers*.
Some are made by using an equal quantity of
good glue and concentrated glycerine, the
glue being softened by soaking in cold water,
after which it is melted over a warm water
bath, the glycerine being added gradually.
Tne heat is continued until the excess of water
is driven off. During the process the mass is
continually stirred. It is then cast in bronzj
or brass molds that have been well oiled. An
other method is to make a mixture of 10'
pounds of the best glue, liVÂ£ gallons of black
molasses or honey, 1 pounu of purified India
rubier dissolved in turpentine, 2 ounces o(
Venice turpentine, 12 ounces of glycerine and
and 4 ounces of vinegar.
Ballads of a Nationâ B., City. The expres
sion, "Let me make the ballads and 1 care not
who makes the laws of the natio.i," has often
been credited to Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun,
a Scottish patriot and politician, who was
born in 1053 and died in 1716. In a letter to
the Marquis of Montrose written in 17011
Fletcher wrote: "I knew a very wise man wrm
believed that if a man were permitted to make
Blithe ballads he need not care who shi.uld
make the laws." The author of the expres
sion is not known, but as Fletcher in ihu let
ter quoted says, "I knew a very .wise man."
it is presumed he referred to John Selden, an
illustrious English scholar and lawyer, says: a
reviewer of the life t/f Fetcher, but thai can
not b.- so, for the ren.Â«on that Selden died the
year after Fletcher was born, consequently *ie
could not have known him' as "a very wisÂ«
man." ' '

Two of Them Had to Put
Back to Port in
Distress.
Sails Were B'.owj Away and
the Schooners Were Other
wise Damaged.
Far wjII Dinner Tendered to Captain
McAllister of the British Slip
Langdale.
It was blowing half a gale outside yes- â 
terday and in consequence several coast- j
ers had to put back to port in distress. At
Point Reyes it was blowing thirty-nine
miles an hour at noon, and at 4 p. m. the
wind gauge at Point Lobos registered
thirty-two miles. In the meantime the
schooner Annie Gee had run back into
port minus a mainsail, and the Christina
Steffens kent her company minus a flying
jib. Both vessels came to an anchor eff
Meiggs wharf and after repairing dam
ages will go to sea again as soon as the
northwester is over. The captains of the
Gee ami Steffena say thai never have they
seen fiercer squalls on the coast. The
schooners were almost continuously un
der water and the wonder is that any of
the sails managed to hold.
The ierry-stenmer T.buron has forsaken
the Tiburon route and wiil probably not
go into commission again before the Ist |
of next month. In the meantime the
j Ukiah has taken her place, and in conse
quence is kept going night and day. The
Tiburon is being put in thorough repair
lor the summer. New carpets have been
laid in the cabin*, the engines have been
I ovei hauled and new boilers put in, three
coats of paint have been put on the hull
and the cabins have oeer. repainted
throughout. When the Tiburon is once
mure placed in c>nimission she will prac
] tically be a new boat.
Captain H. It. Wuite of the Tibnron, is
j sick. He is suffering from a very severe
j cold atid lor the last ten days he has been
I in constant attendance upon his wife, who
I is suffering from typhoid pneumonia. Mrs.
i \Vhite's condition has slightly improved
i and tnecaDtain was again able to ba on

The old Centennial is to make another
voyage. Last year when she belonged to
the Alaska Improvement Company she
was tinea out for a cruise to the canneries,
but when the insurance companies a. K k.-ii
! 30 per cent on her the owners tied her up
again in the Oakland Creek and chartered
a steamer to take her place. The Alaska
Packers' Association bought out the other
company and a few days ago decided to
pull the Centennial out of the mud and
put her in commission again. Her hull
is sound, and as new yards and running
rigging are being put on the masts, she
will be almost as good as new on sailing
day. She is now taking in coal for tha
canneries at Howard-street wharf.
The bark Harvester, which also changed
j hands when the Alaska Improvement
Company transferred its interests to the I
Alaska i'acKers' Association, has been re- j
told to Joseph Hume and will start fitting j
out lor the Karluk canneries in a few i
days.
Captain Hogan, the well-known master i

Captain McAllister of the ship Lang
dale was banqueted at Bergez's restaurant
last night. He is one of the mos 1 popu

hnd his friends decided that lie should

farewell meeting.
Among those who were present were
Captain Fraser of the Swanhi da. Captain
Petrie of the Olivebank, J. W. Van Ber
j gen, John McCarthy, A. A. Hooper, John
! Buggan, E. W. McCarthy, Alex McCord,
Hinim Cook, Colonel "Tom" McCord,
William Schriber and others. The speech
of the evening was made by Mr. Cook.
He spoke at length on the Corbett-Fitz- |
Simmons fieht, and after describing each
man at great length he finally got his]
| hearers so mixed up that one-half of them
I are now ready to swear that Cook said
that Fitzsimmons will win and the others
are ready to gamble that the noted referee
said that Corbett was a "sure thing."
Captain McAllister remarked that he
knew, very little about prizefights, but he
was willing to back tire Langdale aeainst
any ship thai will leave whnin the next
ten days lor the run lo Europe.
The schooner Lucy from Columbia River

The American iron ship T. F. Oakes,
which sailed from Hongkong for New
York last July, is now considrrably over
due and 75 per cent reinsurance is being
paid on her. When ten days out she was
spoken twenty miles from her starting
point and since then nothing has been
heard from her. The German ship H.
Bischoff, which sailed from Hiogoa month
later than the Oakes left China, is also
missing. She is out 213 days from the
I Japanese port and the general opinion is
I lhat both vessels went down in one of the
I typhoons that have lately raged in the
I Orient.
The City of Puobla will be laid up longer
than was at first expected. Her teii-ton
shaft was found to be cracked and it had
to be removed. A new one will be made
at the Union Iron Works and then tue
vessel will go back on her old run.
The Black Diamond Coal Company has
taken the law into its own hands and is
doing wort the City should have done
months ago. The foot of Main street, and
in fact the entire water front from Bryant
to Spear Btreets, has been in bad shape
lor years. The coal company has latterly
been shut off from direct comin.tnicatiou
with Main-street Wharf, so President Corn
wall determined to mnke a move himself.
Yesterday he started rillii.K in the ap
proaches to the Stale's wharf, and unless
the Superintendent of Streets steps in and
stops the work there will be a pood road
way to Main-street wharf before the week
is out.

THE GROWTH OF
A CONSTITUTION
How Our Forefathers Se
cured Political
Freedom.
Judge Morrow Outlines the His
tory of the Federal Gov
ernment.
An Instructive Lecture Under the
Auspices of the Young Men's
Institute.
At Metropolitan Hall last night, under
the auspices of Columbia Council No. 55
of the Young Men's Institute, Judge W.
W. Morrow delivered an entertaining lec
ture on "The Federal Government," illus
trated by tine stereopticon views of Wash
ington faces and places.
The lecture was preceded by a short
programme, which included organ selec
tions by Miss M. Georgians and a vocal
solo by John A. McAuiiff, which, were
well received.
James P. Foby, who prraided, spoke of
the advantages accruing from the Y. If. I.
Bureau series of lectures, which are doing
much to promote the moral and intellec
tual welfare of the community.
Jndge Morrow, who received a most
flattering reception, prefaced the more
serious portion of his eddress with some
humorous remarks on the subject of fin
de siecle journalism, in which a movinsr
panorama of pictures serves to illustrate
the dry details of news previously in
fashion. The present lecture, he snid,
recognized this necessity, and all the lec
turer had to (io was to give a brief history
of the most important aspects ot the Fed
eral Government. He then proceeded:
Tha elements of an endurine federation, es
tablished by the constitution of the United
States, have been popularly attributed to the
iramers of that instrument as an original ex
periment, and it has been said that we ure
indebted to their political wisdom lor the per
lectlon of its operation. Mr. Gladstone gava
vigorous expression to this sentiment when
he sHid that the constitution of the United
i States was "the greatest work ever struck off
i at one time by the mind and purpose of man."
On the other hand, Sir Henry Maine denies
! originality to the founders of the Kepubiic
' when he say* "thiu the constitution of the
i United States is a modified version of the
i British constitution which was i:i existence
i between 17(iO and 1787." Withoui do racting
in the least from the ncknowiedgtds.atesuian
shipamt patriotism of the fjreat men of the
Revolutionary period, I think it may be said
with truth and propriety that the general
principles of self-government and federation
which we find m the constitution of tha
United States were not entirely original with
tti^m, but had been tried, and tried success
fully, on this continent tor more than one hun
dred and til ty years before that time.
The history of federation of local govern
ment commences, on this continent, within
twenty years niter the landing of the Pilgrim
Fathers at Plymouth Rock In December, lti'JO.
It commeuces in the valley oi tho Connecti
cut, when nil the free men of the towns of
Windsor, Hartford and Wetliersfield assembled
at Hartford on Jan nary 14. I<>3!), and adopted
j a written constitution providing for the feder-
a tion of independent towns, with all the at
tributes of sovereignty not expressly granted
to the General Court of the Colony of Connec
ticut, reserved as ot original right to tho
towns. This document was known as the
Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, and was
based upon the idea that the iqundation of
authority is laid In the free consent of the
governed.
It was the first written constitution known
to history that created a govorumeni, and is
I recognized by histoiiat'.s as the beginning of
the American democracy, and although
i framed for a population not exceeding one
thousand it remained for nearly two hundred
years without ci.ange or amendment, the oi
gtinic law ol the commonwealth of Connecti
cut, and its leading features were incorpo
rated into the constitutions of the several
States and of the United Slates. But the influ
ence of Connecticut in the direction of federa
tion was exerted in a still more practical way
and in a broader field.
In 1637 she had made overtures to Massa
nhusciis for a union of colonial interests. Her
settlements were then in tne Heart of the
I Indian country aud exposed to the depreda
tions of the wily and trencherous savages.
But this was not all. The Dutch, at New Am
sterdam, were pressing eastward and north
ward iuto tne Connecticut Valiey, and the
French, at Quebec, were pushing southward.
The situation was dangerous unit Connecticut
sought the Hid of Massachusetts, but as the
lHtier was not seriously threatened she de
iaye'l action. The proposition was renewed
I in 1G39 aud again in 1042.
Judge Morrow traced the events which
finally lei up to the acceptance of the
present constitution and said :
The powers of the Federal Government are
distributed by thi-< constitution into tae three
departments, leg si uive, executive and judi
cial. Tne leni.'-lHtive consists of the. iwo
houses of Congress, the ex. cutivi' of the Presi
dent, and tne judicial of the Supreme and in
ferior courts. The powers conceded to the
Kede.al Govi-rnment by the cnnstitutii n of
the United Stales are In brief: To lay and col
lect taxes, duiies imposts and excises; to pt,y
and provide for the common defense and gen
eral welfare of the United Stales; to reguiAtu
commerce with foreign nations and among the
several Stales and with the Indian tribes; to
establish a unilorm rule of natur/iliz itton aud
unliorm laws on the subject of bankrupicy
throughout the United states; ;o coin money,
regulnte the value thereof, and of lore gn
coins, and fix the stanuard <>f weights and
meHvur.s; to establish postoffleei and pi.s -
roads; to promote tho }iroeruÂ«s of Rcience and
USetUi aris, by securing for limited times to
authors Â«nd inventors exclusive riÃht t> uieir
respective writings and discoveries; lo detine
and punish piracies and lelonics committed
on the bijra sens and o flenses against the
law of nations; to declare war, grant
letters of marque ana reprisal, and make
rules concerning captures on land and
water; to raise aud support armies:
to provide and maintain a navy; to exercise '
exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever
over such district (not exceeding ten square
miles) as may, by cession of particular States
and the acceptance of Congress, become the
seat of government of the United States; to
make all laws which may be necessary and
proper for carrying into execution the fort
going provisions and all othtr powers vested
by the constitution in the Government of the
United States or in any department or officer
thereof.
Judge Morrow concluded this historical
sketch by recounting the causes which re
sulted in the establishment of the capital
at Washington, pointing out in this con
nection that as recently as lÂ£oo Washing
ton was in the West.
NOTIFIED THE ATTORNEY.
Collector Wise Transmits Fact* Ke
lating to the Uecent Big Seizure
of Opium.
The United States District Attorney's
office was officially notified by Collector of
the Port Wise yesterday of tbe big opium
seizure recently male by the sppcial treas
ury agents, who have been investigating
the opium traffic in this City.
Mr. Wise merely transmuted the facts
as laid before him by tne agents and
which have been called to the attention
'of the department at Washington. Mr.
Wise states that he nas been in perfect ac
cord with the department, aud it with
him, regarding t he seizure, and that the
dday in hand.nj: tne documen sto United
States Attorney Foote was occasioned by
a desire on his part-to see that everything
was in regular lorm, so that there might
be no hi;cn in iuture proceedings.
It now lies entirely with the United
States District Attorney's f ffice whether
or not an information is filed against the
$200,000 worth of the drug now tied up in
tue warehouses and Appraiser's store.
As Attorney Footo has already rendered
an opinion that there nas been a technical
violation of the law in the manner in
which the opium was imported it is prob
able that the information will be filed,
and within a sliort time.

A Joke That Ended in the Sud
den D.ath of a Rodent
Quartet.
(al-ghan Has Not Yet Recovered,
but Nevertheless One of the Rats
Is St.ll Alive.
The Custom-house inspectors along the
water iront are having a quiet laush at
the expense of "Jim" Callaghan. One of
their number put a nest of young rats in
Callnghan's pocket and when he "dived
down to get out of the rain" a young ro
dent came out attacbod to each finger of
his right hand. The rats and Callaghan
both thought it was dinner time and both
got a surprise.
Callag!ian, among his other duties, has
charge of the Briti:-b. ship Saint Mirren for
Uncle Sam and on many occasions has
been heard to remark that there were
more rats on Harrison-street wharf than
on any other pier along the water front.
Innpector Critcher, who has charge of the
vessels at Mission and Howard streets,
Rats Attached Themselves to
Custom Inspector Callaghan's
Digits and Gav^ Him a Sur
prise* .
took umbrage at the assertion and said that
the Italian baric Citsabona couid furnish
more rats, young and old, than any snip
in the bay.
Callaghwn laughed, but Critcher proved
his case. He secure. i a nest of young rats,
whettier it was from the hold of the Casa
bona or not no one knows, and landed
them in safety in the Inspector's overcoat
1 ocket. A few crackers kept them quiet
until Callaghan was ready to go 10 lunch.
Then there were lesst half a dozen men
ready to help him on with his coat.
Wharfinger Dryden held it up so that
there would be no delay, and "Charley"
Pratt did till in his power to assist the In
spector of Customs into his outer garment.
Out of pure thankfulness he asked the
boys to come across the street in the rain
and have lunch with him*
They all refused, of course, but stationed
themselves on the sheltered side of the
Wharfinger'^ office. When the rain struck
him Caiiaghan turned up his coat collai
and stuck his hands into his pockeis. As
soon as he reached the rat nesl the young
sters thought their mother had come, and
each one of the younn rodents made
a pr;ib !or n finger. Then Critcher, Dry
den and Pratt uud a laugh as they watched
the gyrations of Callagban. Ho yelled
murder and shook his hand in every iii
rectioQ, but the young rats wanted their
lunch and they held on. Finally Calla
tzhan rushed back into the Wharfinger's
officer and dipping his hand into a basin
of water drowned every one of the little
gray fellows before they would let go of
Uis lingers.
There was just one left in the nest, how
ever, when the Custom -bouÂ«e officer was
ready lo make another pilgrimage to the
lunch-counter. It was almost pure white
and he determined to keep it. There is
now a pet rat around Harrison-street
wiiarf and people who have heard the
story are inundating Caiiaghan with
food for it.
In the meantime Critcher on the Casa
bona lias th joke on Caiiaghan, who
stands watch on'the St. Mirren.

FOUGHT FOR HIS WEED.
A Very Interesting Episode on
the Ferry Steamer
Tiburon.
Tried to Flimfl m an Athlete and
Was Repaid With Two Dis
colored Optic:,
Clubdom is very much amused over an
adventure that befell one of its members a
few days ago and the officers and crew of
Uie ferry steamer Tiouron, on board of
which the cccurrence took place, are still
talkinp of it. The young man in question
Is a well-known athlete and boxer, who
resides a portion of the time at the Cali
fornia Hotel and the rtmainder at the
Hotel Rafael.
On Wednesday afternoon, as he was
taking his regular trip to San Rafae! and
smoking a Perfeco on the after deck a
roughly dressed stranger approached and
asked the clubman ior a light.
The latter courteously handed the peti
tioner his fraprant weed and trie man
slowly lit a "La flnr de China," and
calmly putune the Perfecto in his mouth
handed his own hve-cenier to tne club
man, immediately walking away.
Tue athlete was too much astonished
for a moment to remonstrate, but when
he recovered his breath he was after the
cheeky individanl post haste. There
were very few words spoken, but within
a moment the two had mixed it, with the
man who had fl mflamnied the athlete
rapidly getting the worse of the en
counter.
The deckhands took a hand in the
melee, but the Olympian's blood was up,
and the sailors speedily withdrew from
the combat and called Captain White to
the rescue of the owner of the poor cigar,
who was rapidly being reduced to a state
of insensibility.
The captain's advent on the scene put
an end to hostilities, and the combatants
were kept apart until Tiburon was reached,
when the clubman betook himselr 10 his
hotel to arrange his disordered apparel and
cool off.
The man who received the drubbing
con tided to the loungers about Tiburon
that "that dude could lick Corbett," and
exhibited two very badly damaged optics
as evidence of the truth of his remark.

IN DISGUST
Hearst Pleads His Charities
in Extenuation of !
Betrayal
JUST AS THOUGH CHARITY WERE
NOT A MATTER OF BUSINESS
WITH HIM.
Says It Was "Such a Little Transaction It
Should Be Overlooked by
the People*
But It Was to Save Two Cents on a Pound Under
the Free Labor Price Just
the Same.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' Association Takes Action
Condemning the Faker as Having Dealt a Blow
Against Free Labsr.
W. R. Hearst makes no denial of the charge of using prison-made goods in his
establishments on Mission street and on MarKet street. He conld not. Of course he
could, but cfter twenty-four hours in which to think over the situation the folly of
that became too apparent even to him and his satellites. There is Warden Hale to be
met, ana, greater than Warden Hale, there are his books and the written contract.
There was nothing to be said in face of the sweeping exposure by The Call, with
its fac-similes of orders for prison-mad goods written on Examiner letter-paper and
signed by the business manager of the faker. The facts a 9 presented and clinched
admitted of no doubt, and lac faker could only do that which The Call, while |
making the exposure, said it would do. It whined in its leading c litorial yesterday
that "it was such a little thing"â only the purchase of $$369 38 worth of twine.
Exactly. And why was that sum spent amon,' the convicts at San Quentin? Was
it for any reason other than the saving of 2 cents a pound on twine?
Ii is a very little matter, indeedâ picayunish, in fact. But the streets of San Fran
cisco are overrun just now with men clamoring for work, and they, as well as their
more fortunaie feilows who, for the moment, have "a job," but who cannot tell how
soon they may be crowded out by the unemployed who trench upon them on the one
side, whi.e prison labor undermines them on the other â they are none of them de
ceiveJ.
They know that the open market is ready and eager to sell Mr. Hearst his twine,
made by free labor, at the same price that it sells to all the other newspapers in this
City. The merchants who have the twine to sell know it, tooâ they, no doubt, de
plored the loss of Mr. Hearst's trade when he saw fit to leave them and negotiate with
Â£an Quentin for the saving of 2 cents a pound.
Since the exposure made by j'he Call, tongues have loosened that were be
fore 6till on this subject and it is known that T. T. Williams, business manager of tne
Monarch Faker, boasted in certain quarters of the neat stroke of business he had
done in making this contract with the San Qjentin prison. He thought he had done
a big thing for his master and no doubt he did â no doubt Mr. Hearst was much
jleased by the saving effected. And yet now, when the smiling and smirking mask
that he has kept turned toward the workmen of California Is torn away and the fea
tures of the miserable hypocrite are revealed under a searching blaze of light, he
whines that it was "such a little thinfr." Cowering under the strong light turned
upon him he seeks relief by holding up his "charities" to public view â he has given
so much to charity that this little matter of business might be overlooked.
To avoid the necessity of the humiliation of charity is the great and constant cry
of the American workman, and the "ultimate conclusion of Mr. Hearst's policy," to
use the language of Chairman Davies of the relief committee of the unemployed, "is
that it would be advantageous to many of the workingmen to become convicts in order
to have an opportunity to work." It is the alternative of being compelled to accept
Mr. Hearst's chanty, and allowine him to get the benefit of the advertisement that
goes with it. For if anybody retained the belief that Mr. Hearst doled out his charity
for charity's sake the uncovering of this "little business transaction" should effectu
ally dispel it. While making a great public parade about saving the Grant monu
ment from the indignity of being set up on a convict-cut base, he is himself secretly
saving 2 cents a pound on the twine he uses by employing convicts to the discom
fiture of free labor.
Was there ever a more pitiful hypocrite? The very smallness of the business,
which he pleads as his excuse, is its most damning feature. If he would pass by the
San Francisco merchant and go to San Quentin to save a few dimes, would he not get
â¢11 he needs there to make a great savinsâ if he thought he wouldn't get caught at it.
As it is he bought at San Quentin all the goods they have in his line. They dAn't
make paper nor ink over there, nor do they sec type.
That the workingmen of California understand the faking hypocrite now is made
clear by the expressions of disgust that come to The Call from all over the State.
At a meeting of the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association held last evening,
J. W. Kerr, in urging the re-election of Julian Sonntag said, touching the double
dealing of the .Examiner:
"Gentlemen, the enaction of legislation to offset many most pernicious evils yet
remains. We cannot afford to lose Mr. Sonntag, with his excellent DOtiey and his
aggressive principle from the leadership of this association. I, for one, beg that he
remain.
"There are tne two questions of pure food and convict labor, with which we are
now battling hard. Especially must we consider the proposition of convict labor.
"It will indeed be a hard blow to us to lose our hardest fighter right at the time
we find that one of our metropolitan journals, the San Francisco Examiner, on which
we relied for support in common with the others, is itself a patron of San Quentin.
The Examiner, 1 am glad to say, has been shown up as it deserves to be."
The speaker was warmly applauded.
The Examiner Should Be Condemned
In the Very Strongest Sense.
In commenting on the two-faced action of the i: Jutemill Monarch" in purchas
ing its twine at San Quentin, while making so vociferous a howl over the fact that the
pedestal of Grant's statue was hewn by the hanris of murderers and thieves, Julian
Bonntag, the president of the Manufacturers' ai d Producers' Association, and of the
Council of Associated Industries, yesterday spoke as follows:
"1 say that any person or persons, company or corporation, purchasing convict
poods, should be condemned in tne fullest sense of thÂ« word. It is an injury to all
free men of the S ate.
"It is a menace to capital and a menace to labor.
"The Manufacturers' and Producers' Association has made a hard fight to remove
this dangerous competition to free lubor, and feels that it has aroused public senti
ment in tne matter to such an ex ent that nobody will now care to be known as a
customer of any State institution for the punishment of crime. If I myself were en
dowed with auihority I would stop the manufacure of all goods by power machinery
in any and all the penitentiaries of the State of California without a day's delay."
Stand of the Labor Convention
on the Convict Labor Question.
The attitude of the laboring clas-es upon the convict labor question nas always
been pronounced and firm. From the very first that convicts were put to work in
the various trades the working people saw the danger and did ail in their power 10
have it averted. In several States, aiued by the manufacturers, who saw ruin in the

continuation of the system, the free laborers have met with partial success. In this
City last month a strong effort was made in this direction.
On February 17 the California Labor Convention met at 915>4 Market street, James
Rose president and Guy Lsthrop recording secretary. Several bills before the Legis
lature were discussed, and one in particular. It was brought up in the convention by
A. McDermott, in the shape of a resolution, which ib here given:
WHEREAS, The question of prison labor and its encroachment
on free labor should receive the attention of this congress without
further delay ; therefore be it
RESOLVED, That we are in favor of submitting to the voters of
this State a constitutional amendment to be voted on at the next gen
eral election abolishing prison labor when such comes in competition
with free labor and providing that convicts shall be compelled to
work by hand, thereby discontinuing the use of machinery.
A. McDERMOTT.
The resolution was passed uanimously, therÂ«bv showing that while the working
people are not in favor of keeping felons in idleness they shall not be provided with
machinery which will give them the means of competing with free labor.
The Jutemill Monarch Tries
to Suppress a Newsboy.
Roy Aldrich, one of The Call's bright newsboys had an interesting experience
yesterday while selling his papers on Market street, near the Examiner's business
office, on the corner of Grant avenue. When he star ed out with his bundle of copies of
The Call his cry was: "Here's yer Daily Morning Call. All about the Examiner
scandal. All about the Examiner buying suppnrs of convict-made goods."
The lad had not beer, there bat a short time and had not sold more than half a
dozen papers when the manager of the j iteruill- monarch realized the damage that
was being done and a counter play was made that proved to be a failure. Aldricb, in
describing the movement, said:
"The folks In the Examiner sent out and got several other newsboys, who came
out with a few Examiners, and whenever I would cry out, 'All about the Examiner
scandalâ the Exnminer buying convict-inado goods,' the other boys would cry out:
'All about The Call scandal. The Call buying from the convicts.'
"I would not stand that, so 1 run tha big fellow off the street with his Examiners,
and then made the other* leave too, ar.d for a while I had the place all to myself. Af
ter a while the folks in the Examiner ?ent out another Jot of boys to run me out, but I
didn't run worth a'cent, and I called out all the louder. I sold quite a numberof Calls
and when the other fellows saw that they were playing a losing game they quit try

Alameda's Trade Federation
Discusses and Denounces the Faker.
OAKLAND. Cal., March 11.â The Alameda County Federation of Trades has
discussed the matter of the Examiner purchasing twine from San Quentin informally,
but to-night President Rogers stated that the federation cannot take any official action
until the San Francisco Union uhall have Beted.
''This action of the Ex; miner is seveioly condemned by us all," said President
Rogers to-night, "but it is not in our jurisdiction, and we carsnot take official action
ujuil the union in San Francisco has taken the matter up. Every union man is up in
arms, because they realize ju3t how bitter has been their fight against convict-made
goods. Just when we have it about won we find a bi,; newspaper doing just what we
have been trying to prevent people from doing."
All who have discussed the matter expressed great surprise that a paper posing as
the friend of labor should bo guilty of using convict labor goods. Tne fight against
this class of goods has been a very uphill one with California unions and haÂ« been
waged for years. It is a very s:range proposition that the Examiner should make
such ado over a convict-hewn pedestal for Grant and should be using twine made at
San Quentin.
T. J. Latimer, secretary of the Federal Labor Union, denounces the action of the
Examiner in the strongest terms. "It is hard enough to live now," he said, "and
earn enough to prevent starvation, but if convict goods are to be bought we might as
well follow those poor fools that went off to a South Sea island tne other day. It is
not so much the amount of twine that was used as the utter lack of principle t*at the
affair shows. It is a fearful example to pet, an 1 the Examiner is always posing as a
'holier than thou in labor matters. This thing will not bo forgotten for a long time.
I do not see why we should be so greatly surprised either."
The statement in to-day's Examiner that it only i urchased a few bal's of twine of
a kind that could not be manufactured ao good eisew^.era caused some rid cule at the
cotton-mills. Manneer Rutherford has -onie twine there so lite the sampie handed
out rÂ«cer.tly by the Examiner man that no one but an expert could bay told the dif
ference. The manager m xed the two together and it tools him several seconds to de
termine which was prison-made and which was made in his own mills.
"I think we are capable of making unv kind of twine that anybody wants," he
said. "If we find that we cannot, then we will get some machinery that can. That
subterfuge is too flim-y."
The people at the cotton mills were busy to-day mailing Calls to all parts of the
world to let people see how the Examiner was encouraging convict goods as against
free labor.
Mr. Roberts, secretary of the Federation of Trades, snid to-night: "There can be but
one opinion regarding any concern that will patronize San Qientin. Such a concern
is the bitterest foe ana most treacherous enemy that lree labor ever had."
Strange That the Paper Could
Be Guilty of Such Perfidy.
RED BLUFF, Cal., March 11. â A few interviews w.tli prominent workinemen
here loilow : C. F. Decker was long the active head of the Knights of Labor and is
the seni. r member of the tirm of Decker & Hammer, machinists and foundry men. He
said: '"Tne working people know the Examiner never ias been a friend to labor and
are glad to see such an expose as has beon made by The Call. It makes many pre
tenses of its friendship, but we know it is only a ma X to cover its own dirty worK,
and we are glad to see some one remove the mask in the interest of the honest but
not much fooled workingman. The Examiner has done some good work, but work
ingmen generally know the motive, aud that greatly nullifies its efforts when it is on
the rieht tracK."
Valentine Paul is a well-known architect and builder and an active member of
labor organizations. He was present at the time of the interview with Mr. Decker.
He said: 11 1 fuly indorse wiaat Charley has said on the sabjeci, and the only reason
they ever fought the railroad was because they were taken off the payroll. Out with
their doings."
Charles Unash is the owner of a little cigar factory here, and Is very popular with
all workinemen. He said: "I have not kept very close tab on the Examiner lately
since the paj ers began publishing so much stuff about each other, out I think that a
paper that will make contracts for prison-made goods for its own use is not a friend of
union or free labor of any kind, and such pretensions should be exposed that working
men may know their friends."
8. S. Pollard was one of the leaders of the A. R. U. here at the time of the strike.
He is a quiet and conservative speaking man, but said readily enough: "It will cer
tainly hurt the Examiner, as such pretensions as they have put forth are so at vari
ance with the truth, as shown by The Call." The que--;ion was asked him: "Have
the workingmen considered the Examiner as a true friend?" He replied: "I do not
think they have relied much on it in the past, and with a few exposures they will have
no use for it ie the future."
V. C. Snelling, the popnlar barber at the Tremont Hotel shop*, took a mlnnle to
answer the Call correspondent's question as to what he thought o; the expose. He
said: "I quit tak ng the Examiner two years ago. I became disgusted with it< cant
about free laDor and such siuff, for whom it had no love, but whom it could use only
as a tool to gather in the shekels. It will do some pood to see it shown up in its true
light." His assistant, G orge Solomons, remarked: "The Call has the Examiner in
a hole." To which Mr. Snelline added that 'It will cost Willie a lot of money belore
he gels even on the 2 cents a pound he has been saving on twine."
A. S. Cramer is a carpenter who has managed several large pieces of work in
Tehama County and has always been an active man in labor organizations here. He
said: "It looks strange to me that the Examiner should have been guilty of such
perfidy to union Jpbor, after it has been pretending to be iheir friend so long; but
j then it seems that The Call has so much evidence that one can't help but believe it
I tells the t utb. We want to know who are really the friends of organized labor, and
if the Examiner has gone back on us, as it appears it has, well, we will see what to
do later."

SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 11. â The Call's expose of the Examiner's purchases
of prison-made goods was read with lively curiosity in this city, and caused many
left-handed compliments to be paid to the unfortunate "Monarch of Mendacity."
Many citizens were loth to express an opinion on the subject until the accused
journal could be heard from, but the half-hearted explanation of that paper to-day
confirmed its cuilt and loosened many a tongue.
Prof. H. W. Gottwald, when asKed for an expression, said laconically: "The Ex
aminer should remember those words of holy writ, "Let him who is without sin cast
the first stone.' "
Guv R. Camp, a prominent orchardist of this city, was more emphatic, and said:
"The Examiner is a lying sheet that should be suppressed. lam not at all surprised
at the latest scandal attached to it, and its denial of the charges would, to my mind,
strengthen the case against it."
E. L. Dutcher, contracting painter: "The Examiner is certainly in a bad box in
more ways than one. The fact of their buying the products of the penitentiary would
not lie so bad did they not pose as the friend of labor. Of course, the amount of their
purchase is not Â«reat in dollars and cents, but their silly attempts to make capita!
over the Grant monument while in the very act of buying prison goods, convicts them
by their own evidence of a heinous crime."
George A. Hurch, a prominent plumber and steam-fitter, expressed himself as
follows: "As a union man ol course I am opposed to convict iabor, and the Examiner's

737 Market St., San Francisco, Cal.attemp:s in tho pÂ»st to stir up strife among the union- have always led me to believe
that they were at hear: opposed to union labor. Its loud-mouthed assertions of friend
ship to free labor has never fooled me, as I always think that a barking dog will never
bite.' 1
Prank Muther, a prominent ciear manufacturer, was interviewed and said: "I be
lieve the Examiner is on the downward path and that the way Is greased for the
occasion. Like a drowning man, it catches at straws, but in my opinion nothing will
f .vive it. It's buying prison-made goods while loudly chanting its own praises as a
friend of free labor, is a detestable ofrense, but one of the least of its crimes.
S. J. Gilliam, proprietor of the Magnolia stable*, said: "Of course, prison-made
goods are made to sell and there is really no crime in buying them, but the charge
against the Examiner is not so much the buying of a lot of twine as it is of hypocrisy
of which it stand> convicted."
A fr.d Reed, foreman of the City stables, when interviewed, expressed himself in
no uncertain fa hion, *aying an.one other thing*: "Ttie Examiner is a convicted
boodler, blackmaler and toady and is too filthy to come into a white man s house. '
Many others spoke in a like vein, ani cf the score or more asked for their opinion
of the Monarch, there were none so poor as to do il reverence.
Laborers of Sacramento
Say Some Bitter Words.
SACK\MENTO Cal March 11. -The published statement of the Examiner's
hypocrisy in that ' for years it has been posing as the
advocate of union and free labor, and has bÂ»en personally purchasing
the product of convict-made twine for its own consumption, has created a world of
unfavorable comment against thai journal in labor circles in this cty. and a corre
spondingly favorable comment on the action of The Call in so practically upholding
the union laboring c!asses by the non-introduction of lineotype machines.
This eveninc a group of brawny iron-workers from the Southern Pacific Eailroad
shops while waiting on a street comer for their car to come alonÂ« and take them to
their homes were overheard discussing the subject, and one of them ;<aid :
"I have always doubted the sincerity of the Examiner whenever I read its articles
favoring us of the working class, but I'll tellyou what it is, boys, this shows the whole
thing up in plain black and white.
"I've taken the Examiner for years because I was a Democrat and always felt an
interest in politics; but this settles it I quit. Any paper that will kick up such a
howl against convict labar and then turn around and purchase convict-made twine
can draw down no more of my hard-earned stuff, and for that matter, I have
found that I can g<u as correct an idea of politics, even Democratic politics, from
The Call as I can from the Examiner, with the Bole exception of Al Murphy's
'Banker' articlesâ they nre c >rfcers."
In interviews accorded a Call representative this evening by members of the vari
ous unions Emmet Phillips of tne Bookbinders' Union said:
" For years the Examiner has posea a3 the champion of free and union labor, and
it is certainly deplorable to find that it nas, under false colori, been attaining our
i onfnience and support, and has so signally proven its insincerity in its professed
friendship.
"Tnere are many ways in which its professions could have been proven, but cer
tainly the extension of its personal patronage to the striped laborers across the bay at
San Q'lentin at the direct expense of free and union labor in the purchase of prison
made twine is not a very practical proof of its sincer tv.
"The expose of hi- hypecracy on the Dart of The Call is certainly commendable,
as it is right that tne laborers should know who are th ir true friends and who are
their professed friends. In fact, the labor world has found another enemy in camp."
Samuel Hughes of Typographical Union No. 21 said:
"As a union man I can do nothing else out denounce the Examiner. A paper
that will so bitterly denounce the product of convict cut stone as did the
Examin r, when speaking of the base connected with the Grant statue, and then de
liberately purchase convict-made twine at the expen c of union labor is no longer
worthy of the confidence and patronage of union laboring men."
William Winer, a pr< minent member of tne Typographical Union, *aid:
"I have 1< st a large portion of the regard I formerly had for the Examiner and do
not by any means consider it the champion of union labor, not that I am at all sur
prised at any departure it may make from its 'professed' principles. It has lelt
patriotism entirely in the shade and defers entirely to its business office, which seem
ingly wholly dictates its policy.
"The publication in The Call of the fact that it has been patronizing convict
labor in the purchase of twine only more fully demonstrates what I claim, and that
is that the Examiner bows in its policy to the dictates of its business department and
cares little if anything for the rights of the laboring classes.
"1 must give the Examiner credit, however, for being the most astute
advertiser in the country, through its advocation of char
ity to the poor and afflicted. Had its professed cliarity been
genuine, it would have been done under cover, but being 'ads' to advance its circula
tion they were emblazoned so that all might comprehend how vast a fund of charity
its promoters possessed."
John Mathen s. a dÂ°legate of the Federated Trades, Â«aid :
"The Examiner, to draw it mild, is decidedly inconsistent, but I have never be
lieved that there was one atom of merit in the Examiner's protestations of beii- c K e
friend of tie workingman.
"On the other hand we of the laboring clashes fully realize that The Call has been
our practical friend, it has fully demonstrte 1 t:iis :act by k eeping lineoiype machines
out of its composing-room as long as it has; we of course fully realize that this cannot
continue always. We realize that it is rinanc ialiy detrimental to the proprietors of
The Call, but we also know that in empioyin ; 130 printers at a time when labor-sav
in z machines were bein so universally introduce lon newspapers throughou* the coast
that the wolf has been kept from toe door of many a poor lamily. Had The Call
adopted the po.icy of the Examiner and Chronicle and introduced machines at the
same time as they did the suffering of the printing fraternity wouid have been simply
mmioL
"So I say The Call has practically demonstrated its friendship toward the la
boring classes, and should be as highly commended for its sincerity as the Examiner
should be denounced tor its hypocrisy by all the union brotherhood on the coast."
J. P. Welsh of the Pressmen's Union sed;
"I rersonally know that the Examiner has b7 no means been the
friend of union labor. It has demonstrated this in various ways,
which have come under my personal observation, and the fact of its
purchase of convict- made twine, being as it is strictly in conflict
with every nnion principle only servea to strengthen the various matters
whicli have combined in the pnst to prove to me personally
its insincerity in its professions of friendship towarl the
union frateruity. On the other hand, I know that The Call has stood staunchly by
every un.on principle, and been a practical friend of our several union 3. I am by no
means surprised at the expose of the Examiner's hypocrisy, as I was fully convinced
of it in the past."
Employers of Labor Unite in
Speaking In Loud Denunciation
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 11.â The expose of the Examiner's perfidy in posiug as
a lriend of labor while busily engaged in purchasing prison-made goods is the main
topic of conversation among workingmen in this city.
Thl3 course of the Examiner is generally denounced, prominent workingmen and
true friends' of labor taking a decided stand against the paper that has betrayed the
trust placed in it by the toiling masses.
A. B. McNeil, proprietor of an extensive job printing establishment and an
honorary member of the Typographical Union, said in an interview this evening:
"Speaking as an em r layer of organized labor, and as one whose
entire interests are identified with the wellare of the Pacific
Coast, I will say that I know of no action as insilious in its
character, and as far-reaching in its effects as this throttling of labor in
the purchase of prison-made poods. While I contend that pris
oners of all grades should be compelled to labor for thÂ»
public good, there is much labor that can be done by them and so many ave
nues where it can be profitably employed without entrenching on the rights of the
law abiding.
"1 can see no excuse for the short-sighted and utterly indefensible course pursued
by the proprietor of the Examiner.
'I do not wish to be understood as desiring to take part in a labor controversy,
yet as my opinion has been sought it is freely given."
E. E. Chims-on, president of the local Cigar-makers' Union, and a delegate to the
last international convention of that organization, said: "The press is the guide of
the people. When a paper poses as a friend of labor people take it on that represen
t{ tation.
"Despite the editorial statement of the Examiner, the purchase of the prison
flniade twine is not a smalt matter. Such a course is detrimental to the interests of
workingmen. Every ball or prison twine purchased by the Examiner is just so much
work taken away from honest men.
"The workingmen have a ereat battle to fight and it must have the aid of the
newspapers. It Is lalse friends in that fi>ld that cause the greatest harm."
. A. S. Hale, a prominent member of San Jose Typographical Union and fore
man of a large job printing office, said: "The Examiner, like me man who carries
waier on both shoulder*, has come to grief. It posed as the friend of the working
man, but ths contract for San Quentin twine exposes its hypocrisy.
â¢'The Examiner now appears in its true light, and the intelligent workingman
will not again be bord winked by its shailow pretenses of friendship."
A. T. Huston, president of the Barbers' Leacue, said: "The Examiner's excuse for
purchasing prison-maae twine is a lame one. It is no: a small matter. There is a
great principle involved.
"The purchasing of such prison-made goods as enter into competition with free
labor prevents honest men from getting work. Instead of encouraging such an in
justice the Examiner should have aided the workingmen in their fight against the
products of the prisons."
Disgusted With the Hypocrite.
SALINAS, Cal., March 11.â The exposure of the Examiner by The Call ha^ been
the talk of the town since yesterday. The Examiner with its mask removed has lost
the friendship of the wage-earners and manufacturers. Here is what some of the
prominent laborers of our town say:
E. H. Godat, mason â I have just recently stopped taking the Examiner because I
was thoroughly disgusted with its hypocritical posing as the friend of labor. A paper
that uses the product of convict labor in preference to the product of the honest toller
ought not to receive the s-upport of the workingmen.
W. E. Grant, contractor and buil-ierâ The Examiner is not the workingmen's
friend. No convict labor for me. The Call is the best friend of the wage-earner.
A, T. Uncapher, carpenter- I n^ver regarded the Examiner as the workingman's
friend, and since its exposure in The Call I know now it Is the enemy of honest
Jabor.
H. E. Besselt, carccnter- The Examiner is not the workinftman's friend. No
paper that uses the product of convict labor can be a friend of the wage-earner.
B. C. Pierce, brickmaK râ The patron of convict labor is no friend of the laboring
man.
J. T. Knos, dentistâ No true American citizen will use the product of convict
labor, and any man who patronizes convict lauor in preference to hone3t Jabor snould
be deprived of his citizenship.
About twenty othtr prominent laborers expressed themielves of the same view*,
many of th>-m Democrats and readers of the Examiner. Not a single person in the
town UDdertakes the defense vt the Examiner.

mint be seen, the awful savagery must be
witnessed before the frame will tremble
with tear."
In the Haslcni massacre, which took
place last August, brutalities were in
flicted on the defenseless Armenians by
the Turks that should have brought down
the veneeance of the Creator on the mur
derers,
"They went by night to Haskni, and
robbed and murdered in an awful man
ner. One woman when ordered brought
all of her jewelry and gave it to the Turks,
and asked that her nusband's life be
spared. She ran and ihrew her arms
around her husband.
"At that moment he received a knife
thrust in the throat, and he fell dead, his
blood drenching his wife's hair and face.
"One poor woman fled for her life and
carried in her arnn the body of her deail
babe. She hurried across the mountains
toward the seashore and for three d>iys
never left me litt.e corpse alone, finally
reaching a place where she could bury her
child and feel that its body was free iroru
molestation nnd couM rest In peace."
The scenes in the ma-sacre districts
were heartrending. Hundreds of people
wou d seek refuge in the steel-domed
churches, and there in the air made
stifling by numbers children would be
born among the maimed and dead.
Mrs. Kouria3 is ot the opinion that all
of the massacres were directly ordered by
the Sultan. She says that any Turk who
take* either th life, honor or riches of a
Cnrisiian believes mat he haÂ» favored his
god and is nearer heaven, and as the Sul
tan is a consummate pagan he imagines
that he has saved ;he souls of thousands
of bis people by his deeds of blood.

LINCOLN'S HAT A FOOTBALL.
It Was After the IC.--.iilt of the Election
Ji.-i I Been Announced.
The favorite hat worn by Abraham Lin
coln was a tall "stovepipe." It had been
described as a foot high, with a brim
almost as wide as a Southern sombrero.
Many anecJotes are connected with that
famous tall hat. In it Mr. Lincoln carried
many of his valuable papers, the briefs of
his law cases and other documents.
On the ni ht of Air. Lincoln's election
to the Prea dency, several ladies who had
gathered at the old homestead at Spring
held testified their glee by using the hat
as a football.
A few of us went over to assist Mrs.
Lincoln about the supDer which was to be
given some gentlemen who had come in
to hear the returns. It was aver midnight
before enough had been learned to warrant
the belief that our candidate was elected.
We went nearly wild with joy and con
gratulated Mr. Lincoln mest heartily.
Some one saw the famous "stovepipe"
in the hall, and seizing it threw it up to
the ceiling. Another caueht it, and then
it went tiie rounds until it fell to the floor,
when one gave it a kick, and then another
and another gave the hat a send-off until
it was so battered that it had lost all re-
semblance to its original shape. Mr. Lin
coln looked on and smiled good-naturedly
at the childish performance. â Youth's

the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation was held in tho Mills building last

At the outset the president stated that
Mr. Green of the American Condensed
Milk Company, who was a member of the

and wished a committee of the body, in
conjunction with a representative of the
Board of Health, to visit his factory, situ
ated twelve miles from San Rafael, and

quest, on account of his private affairs
monopolizing his time.

TROUBLE AHEAD IN
LABOR CIRCLES
Large Jcbs Declared Unfair
by the Trades
Council.
Non-Union Men Are Working
on the Niw Aifiliated
Colleges.
High School, Hall of Justice, Ferry
Depot and City Hall Are Also
Under the Ban.
When the spring opens there will with
out doubt be a decided Improvement in
the i/uilding lines that will furnish em
ployment to large numbers of working
men. The Affiliated Colleges, tlie ferry
depot, the Hall of Justice, the High
School and perhaps the new Postoflice, to
say nothuigof many large and small pri
vate structures, Rive hope for a prosperous
your in many re-pects.
However, accompany ing the^e bright
prospects there is also a prospect of
trouble ahead. Several of the big build-
ings mentioned are already under con
struction and the clouds have begun to
gather in labor circles.
The first cojrap iaint was made by the
Laborers' Protective Association at its
meeting held on Wednesday evening, at
which it was stated that non-nnion labor
ers are being employed on the Affiliated
Colleges buildings.
Last evening at the meeting of the
Building Trades Council this matter was
brought up by the newJy seated delegates
from the Laborers' Protective Union.
Other delegmes reported the High School,
Hall of Justice, ferry depot ana the City
Hall roofing ac unfair jobs. They stated
that non-union men are at work on ail of
these places and that union men have
little or no chanc9 with th^ contractors.
The latter, the delegates Baid, are taking
advantage of the army of unemployed and
unorganized whch is now in the City to
give the unions a tieht or nt least to defy
the unions' claims lor consideration.
The council, however, decided not 'to
take any hasty action in the premL-es and
do anyth:ng that mi^ht have to be un
done or regreited later on. In order to
proceÂ»d with care a committee consisting
of \V. M. Page, L F. Danfortn and J. Jor
gensen was appointed to make a careful
investigation, and J. T. McCann was ap
pointed as a special representative of the
council to assist the committee and to in
vestigate on his own account. Mr. Mc-
Cann will gather statistics ur.on all labor
matters pertaining to these several jobs
and make a report n< it Thursday even
ing, when action will be taken by the
council.
The employment of non-nnion men on
the colleges and ferry building will be
called to ihe attention of Governor Bucid
and the Board of Resents by the council,
and the request wiil be made thai work be
done by union men for union wages and
on the legal time â eight hours.
The same course will be taken with
reference to the High School and the Hall
of Justice.
While all of these proceedings will be
carried od in a quiet, earnest manner they
aÂ»e also significant. During the troubles
of last spring and summer the workmen
of this City became well organized, and
to-day the union* are in a better position
financially and as to members ttiau they
were a year ato. Unless an amicable un
derstanding is arrived at before very lons
it is not unlikely that the unions will take
a firm stand in demanding their rights.
THE CONTRACTORS' SIDE.
Deny Having Discharged Union
Workmen From the Affiliated
Colleges Job.
In yesterday's Call was a report of the
meeting of the Laborers' Protective Asso
ciation, at wh.ch it was stated that union
men had been compelled to gui; work at
the Affiliated Colleges an l that it was the
evident intention of the Kae Building and
Contract Company, contractors, to give
the preference to non-union men. H.
"Whittle, the vice-president of the com
pany, and F. Smith, the secretary, yester
day denied that sucn was or is the case.
Mr. Whittle said:
"The situation is this: We prefer union
men and we are raying them union
wai;es â hodcarriers $3 a day and brick
layers $5. Occasionally the reeents and
our personal friends ask us to put some of.
their friends to work, and frequently we
are not in a position to refuse their re
quests. When we do put such men to
work we pay them what t.';ey are worth,
even full union rate* if they are wortn it.
"Recently we put on some laborers who
do not not "belong to the union, and the
union men refused to wort with them.
Two union men quit on Tuesday morning.
They are tine workmen, and we were
sorry to have them leave us, for they had
b 'en with v* for a long time. However,
we cannot afford to compel a man to pay
$30 to be initiated into a uniou when he is
only making from $2 to $3 a day. We
don't want any trouble with the union,
but wo will hire whomever we please, but
we prefer union men to any others."
MITCHELL'S FINE STROKE
The Crackerjack Amateur Bi>
liardist Showed His Play
Last N ght.
Opening of the FourteenÂ«lnch Balk-
Line Tournament at the Occidental
Hotel Paricr3.
The amateur billiard tournament for the
trophies offered by the Occidental Hotel
and the Brunswick Balke - Collender
Company, opened last night in the rooms
of the Occidental Hotel, introducing the
phenomenonal player, Mitchell, to a Cali
fornia audience.
Mitchell is the new "wizard" who, al
though in the amateur ranks, has shown
a touch fully as delicate a\d accurate as
Schaeffer, Vignaux, Ives and Slosson. He
and Heinecke are rated as the best bil
liard-players in this City, and are put
down as the scratch players in this tourna
meat. j
The games last night were between"
Burna and Thompson, the Jatter playing
250 points to Burns' 225.
It wa* evident that the handicap was too
heavy, a* Thompjon made but 224 points
to Burns' 225.
Burns' best ran was 23 and Thompson's
18, and the averag* was Burns 4.62,
Thompson 4.82.
The 1< sing man, having had one innina
less than his opponent, made the best
average, nn excellent one for amateurs in
a 11-inch balkiino game.
The second came, between Mitchell, 300
points, and Lnwi?', 175 points, was simply
exercise for Mitchell. He showed the ex
cellence of his work in many ways and
won handily, making his score in forty
three innings with a top run of 65 and an
average oi 6,9.
Lewis' best run was 13 and his score 148,
making an average oi Z%.
All the games will be played attheJU

WASHINGTON, D. C, March ILâ The
very limited Chinese colony in Washing

of the knowledge that has reached that
element of Washington society that
Fung Yung Hand, Chinese Consul-Gen
eral, Mationed at San Francisco, is in the
city. His mission is the subject of various
surmise?, but the fact is outside of dispute
that his idea was in reierence to the local
"highbinder" troubles that recently ex
tended to fatal results in San Francisco.
The Consul-General called upon the
Chinese Minister to-day, but whatever the
result of the audience was, it is shrouued
in the usual Oriental mystery.

So the First Rivet in the Bat
tleship Wisconsin Was
Driven In.
Admiral Kirkland, G?neral Forsytb,
M tyor Pue an and Hugh Craig
Worked With a Will.
Patriotism inspired Mayor Phelan and
several other distinguished citizens to
toil Ike village blacksmiths yesterday,
and several horny-handed sons of toil who
stood by and watched toe Mayor's good
right arm at work and saw the drops of
honest sweat dropping from the Mayor's
manly brow made admirLig remarks aft
erward snch a3 â
"Great sight that."
"Bet yer life, if 'Jimmy' drove rivets
awhile to get his hand in he could hold
up his end with the Dest of us."
The occasion was interesting, being the
driving of the first rivet into the new
armed battle-ship Wisconsin, which in
three years will be ready to plow the briny
main, the biggest of all Uncle Sam's white
navy. It is just three months since work
was begun on the armed battle-ship No.
9, as the Wisconsin is officially designated,
and yesterday was practically the begin
ning of the ship's construction.
A lew leading citizens naa been invited
to be present and all the foreign Consuls
had received invitations. The morning
dress of the visitors was liveued up here
and there by the glitter of gilt bullion
that adorned the caps and coats of officers
irom the Presidio and Angel Island.
The first rivet was to have been driven
at 11 A. m., but it was nearly noon before
the guests bad found one another it the
big yard. Without any formality Irving
M. Scott If d the way to tne platform of
rough planks erected for the occasion. It
was about amidships and to reach it the
guests had to pick their way through the
huge iron skeleton of the ship, which
towered above them and stretched out be
fore and behind, 368 feet long and neariy
63 feet wideâ a disjointed skeleton, resting
oa wooden supports and waiting lor the
first link to rivet it together.
Every one crowded round to see who
would take the tirst hand at the Job of
riveting. The Mayor smiled and leisurely
drew off his natty gloves to be ready for
action and tne horny-handed sons of toil
at this signal handed him a red-hot rivet,
which he took firmly at the end of a Ion??
pair of pincers and held it with the firm
ness and decision of a veteran, while Ad
miral W. A. Kirkland and General For
syih took turns at beating it in with
mighty strokes of the hammer.
Not having had extensive experience in
rivet-driving, the son of Neptune and the
son of Mars hit the iron plbte a great deal
oftener than they hit the nail, but they
worked till the drops of inspiration stood
I out in bjads on tneir brows, and tne spec
tators murmured with satisfaction and
encouragement earh time they hit the
nail on the head. The Mayor also took a
1 hana, and Hugh Craig and H. T. Scott,
I who came in ou the nonce 6tretch, coni
i pleted tne job.
As soon as the rivel was finished, the
horny-handed sons of toil had their brief
moment or triumph. Admiral Kirkland
and General Forsylh, the Mayor, Hugh
Craig, H. T. Scott and all the visitors who
had watched their performance stood by
admiringly while the riveting gang showed
how the job ought to be clone with the
i greatest possible neatness and dispatch,
i That ende i the ceremonies. There were
| no speeches, and all the congratulations
tendered to the amateur rivet-drivers were
of an informal and personal nature, but
! until the Wisconsin is ready to plow the
I billows, the tale will be tola und retold at
| the Union Iron Works, of how Admiral
I Kirkland, General Forsyth, Hugh Craig,
i H. T. Scott, and last but not least. Mayor
I Phelan, drove the fust rivet in armed bat
tle-snip No. 9.
Among those present were Constructor

RUNNING HORSES
SHORT OF WORK
Four Favorites Beaten at
the Emeryville
Track.
Gyjceiver Captured the Two-
Year-O!d Event at
12 to I
Perseus Downed Morte Fonse Without
Mnch Effortâ Etta H Had
Speed.
A bet cannot be placed with any degree
of certainty at the Emeryville track of
late. About one-third of the horses sent
to the post are short, and after showing a
sampie of their speed during the early
stages of the running, "blowup" and fall
back beaten. Tnis is not Bolely the fault
of trainers, for during the recent rainy
spell they were unable to work their
horses over the course across the bay.
Consequently when that track reopened
the horses stabled there during the Ingle
side meeting were unfit for any sort of a
pnnishinK lace. The roads in the vicinity
of the track are also unlit to train horses
on.
The attendance was pood yesterday,
and, as but two of the favorites won, the
ring had another profitable day.
Dr. G. went to the post a 6 to 5 favorite
for the opening event over a mile, and
after a very poor ride at Slaughter's hands i
finished second to Coda, a 5-to 1 chance. i
The hardest dump of the day was made
on the two-year-ola scramble, both (
Morana, the 9 to 10 favorite, and Jim
Brownell, the 5 to 2 second choice, ending
up in the rear division, after displaying a '
lamentable lack of speed. Gypceiver, a
10 to 1 shot, carrying Green Morris colors, ;
â¢won in romping fashion from Rey Salazar,
a2oto 1 outsider. Moringo, another long
shot, was third. ...
After receding Irom twos to 13 to 5 Her- |
manita took the third race at a mile very
cleverly. Koselle made the running up to
within a furlong from the wire, where
Martin shook the favorite up and she beat
the light-weight out a head.
A ton of coin went in on Perseus to win
the mile and a furlong selling affair, and
he never gave his bacKers cause for uneas
iness. Backed down to Ito 2 favoritism
Purser's gelding snowed the way through
out, winning by a couple of lengths from
Morte Fonse in I:s6}Â£. McLight was a
lair third.
After suffering many reverses Cella and
Sippy landed their first race since coming
to California with the old campaigner
Simmons. Backed down from sixes to
fours he led his field all tne way, down
ing Double Quick, the second choice, by a
couple of lengths. Caliente, the 6 to 5 j
favorite, was evidently short, finishing
outside of the money.
The Burns & Waterhouse colt, Osric 11,
went to the post a4to 5 choice for the
final six-furlong sprint, and after showing
his old-time speed for half the distance
cashed in. Etta H, played from 4t03t0 I.
then won easily from Lost Girl, a 7 to 1
chance.

RUSSELL ALL BROKEN UP
Supervisors Surprised the Clerk
of the Board on His
Birthday.
Complimentary Preambe and Reso
lutions Followed Up by a
Presentation.
John A. Russell, clerit of the Board of
Supervisors, yesterday celebrated his
sixty-fifth birthday. By accident the Su
pervisors wbo constitute the Committee
on Streets heard of the fact and prepared
to give him a pleasant surprise in tne
shape of a gilt and some resolutions, the
latter bein^ the handiwork of Jack Bon
net, who gladly co-operated with the com
mittee. The wort of the Street Commit
tee was really done, when a queer-looking
document came to Clerk Russell to read.
Mr. Russell puzzled over it, and after a
little found out that it referred to him.
Then Chairman Devany of the Street
Committee came to the rescue and read
the following:
Whereas, Father Time having vouchsafed
the veteran clerk of tne Board of Supervisors
of this City and County tne attainment of liis
sixty-fifth birthday without the loss of any
thing more serious than the capillary adorn
ment of his venerable head, the members of
the Street Committee feel that they should at
this time felicitate themselves npon their good
fortune in having a man of such genial nature,
patient and painstaking disposition, sterling
integrity and exceptional fitness for the
duties of his important office to assist and
guide them iv the periormauce of their official
labors; and, whereas, it 1* the desire 01 the
members of this committee that John A.
Russell should continue to assist in their
| deliberations for an indefinite period or, at
least, until all the streets on the official map
have been accepted, and tne proposed sewer
| system south of the park completed and the
Battle Mountain controversy settled, there
fore
Resolved, That the tenure of office of the
present clerk of the Board of Supervisors be
and the same is hereby extended indefinitely,
and Father Time is hereby requested to take
notice; ana be it further
fiesolved, That the members of the Street
Committee join in the bestowal upon their
worthy clerk of a small token ot their esteem,
hoping that it will enable him in future years
to recall with some degree of pleasure the
sixty-fifth anniversary of nls birth, which was
reached after a quarter of a century of loilh
ful service in the interest of the public.
This was followed up with the presenta
tion of a gold matchbox.
Mr. Russell answered as best he could,
but there was an appearance of moisture
just under his eye-glasses and he was
really "all broken up." But what he said
brought out a round of applause.
Cut Government Timber.
Suit was entered in the United States Circuit
Court yesterday by the United States against
David W. Jones, a mill-owner and timberman
of Siskiyou County, to recover $(51520. The
complaint alleges thai Jones cut a large num
ber of trees on Government land and that he
is liable for damages in the sura mentioned.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 12, 1897.
NEW QUARTERS FOR
THE PRESS CLUB
They Are Soon to Bs Lo
cated in the Eehlow
Building.
A Sky-Scraping Edifice That
Will Be a Credit to
This City.
To Be Built on the Old Site of the
St. Mark's Church, Facing
Unicn Sqjiare.
C. J. Behlow, vice-president of the H.
Liebes Company, contemplates the erec
tion of another ''sky-scraper" buildinc, on
the site of the old St. Mark's German
Lutheran Church on Geary street, near
Powell.
The location faces Union square and is
almost opposite the building of the Pacific
Union Club.
The only hitch in the immediate con-
TO ADORN GEARY STREET.
The handsome eight-story stone and brick building ?oon to ba erected by Charles
J. Behlow, vice-president of H. Liebos <fe Co., furriers. Tne eciiJ'ice will occupy the
site of the old St. Mark's German Evanpeiicnl Lutheran Church on Geary street,
between Powell and Stockton, facing Union square.
struction of the edifice is Mr. BehloTv's
hesitation in choosing from the designs
and plans submitted by numberless archi
tects the one that pleases him most.
No limit has been placel on the cost,
providing the structure is modern in its
conveniences and handsome it its appear
ance.
In Mr. Behlow's undecided state of
mind as to choice he is inclined to leave
judgment in the hands of his prospective
tenant?, among whom is the San Fran
cisco Press Club. The members of ihat
organization are decidedly critical, and
â when they arrive at a conclusion it is
quite likely that the finest building in
tne City will be started on its way to the
skies.
At the present time, subject to recon
sideration,' However, the design presented
by M. J. Lyon, the architect, seems to
have the preference.
It represents an eight-story fireproof
structure, 130 feet higij, S~l{ leet Irontage
and 137^ feet deep.
Tne lower floors front are to be faced
with polished granite and the balance of
the building wiil be of terra-cotia and buff
brick.
The entrance proper leading to the ele
vators and stairways are to be of onyx ana
bronze.
On either side of the main entrance will
be a thirty-eight loot archway for store
purposes.
Three stories above these archrs will bo
used for offices, with nine windows facing
tne square.
Two stories will be devoted to apart
ments, each comprising a bedroom, a par
lor, bath, lobby and hallway. These
apartments are to be bo arranged that any
number of them, from two to twelve, may
be thrown into one vast apartment if so
required.
The crownine piece of the structure is
the eighth story tho Press Club contem
plates occupying.
The Geary-street frontage is to be taken
up entirely by the grillroom on the east
erly corner, the smoking-room in the cen
ter of the building and a lounging-roorn
on the westerly corner. Back of the grill
room are to be the bar, pantry, three card
rooms and finally the immense jinksroom,
above which will tower a grand glass
dome.
On the other side, back of the lounging
room, are to be the directors' meeting
rooms and a cloakroom, from which a
stairway will reach the dome and roof,
wiw're it is proposed to have a garden.
Almost opposite the exitÂ« from the two
elevators a vast New England ctrmney
placa will furnish place for immense flam
ing logs, disseminating warmth even to
that part of the building where callers are
to wait after sending in their cards to
members.
The entire building will be illuminated
by electricity.
COLONEL OF THE FIRST.
Election of James F. Smith to Suc
ceed Colonel William Macdonald,
IV ho Jieaicncd.
The election for colonel of the First
Regiment Infantry, Second Brigade. N.
G. C, was held in the regimental armory
last night, and the result was a surprise to
many.
Ever since the resignation of William
Macdonald as colonel of the First the im
pression prpvai:ed th.it Lieutenant-Colonel
Victor D. Dnboce would be elected to fill
the vacancy, and the only one mentioned
in opposition to him wat Major llnber, re
tired, jind that was the condition of affairs
until 8 o'clock last night, when the offi
cers who were favorable to Major Huber
held a caucus and found that thpy were
short four votes to seruro liis election.
Then they decided io place another name
before the board of officers.
When the meefiiig was called to order
Lieutennnt-Coionel Hansen, surgeon on
firieadier-Ueneral Warrield's Miff, pre
sided, and Major Tilden placed Lieuien
ant-Colonel Duboce in nomination and
briefly alluJed 10 his favorable record in
the vuard. The nomination was seconded
by Major Sime.
Then the opposition sprung its surprise.
Captain O'Neil nominated James F. Smith,
juiine advocate on the staff of the division
commanderâ Major-General James â and
the nomination was seconded by Captain
Warren.
A vote was then taken, and of the 38
votes cast Smith received 21 and Duboce
17. The first named wjis declared elected
colonel ( f the F.rst, and Major Sime, Cap
tain O'Neil and Captain Filmer were
named a committep to notify him.
Alter the vote was announced Major
Tiiden moved to make the election unani
mous and the motion was seconded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce. The motion
was carried.
The new colonel entered the Â»uarri as a
private of Company F, Third Iniantry, in
1883. He then rose to be lieutenant, then
cnptain, after that major and iieutenant
cofonel of the regiment, and on July 25,
1896. he was appointed on the division
staff.
The matter of wonderment last night
was alter the vote was announced who the
four were that went over from Duboce to
Smith.
SMALLPOX OR CHICKEN-POX.
The Case of William PearÂ»on at the
Twenty-Sixth Strbet Hospital.
Willinm Pearson, 16 years old, supposed
to be suffering from chicken-pox, was re
moved to the Twenty-sixth Street Hos
pital from 86'J Market street on March 9.
The physicians baring charge of the case,
Dr. Hirschfelder, superintendent, Dr. Wil
liamson and Dr. Dudley, fear that the
patient is really a victim of smallpox, and
though the symptoms were not sufficiently
advanced yesterday to make a conclusive
â  iiagno3is possible they thought it udvisa
ble to have the patient conveyed to the
smallpox hospital, where he now Jies.
THE BURNS MONUMENT.
Spirited Sessioa of the Com
mittee Last
Night.
Movements Undtr V. ay Tending to
the Succes* tf the Patriotic
Undertaking
The Burns monument committee held a
short but spirited session at Scottish Hall
last night. The entire committee lias not
as yet been completed. There still re
main fourteen names to be added. Those
are to be selected by D. K. McNeil, James
McNaband JohnF. Kennedy, all of whom
have beon requested to at once make their
selections and noti:y the secretary. Y. C.
Lawson, at the auditor's f>ilice of Wells,
Fargo & Co.
There is a desire on the part of the exec
ut.ve committee of the Burns monument
to co-operate with the g^mes commlt.ee
of the Caledonian Club, which body will
hold weekly meetings, commencing next
we k, to make suitable arrangements for
the annual picnic, which will be held on
Saturday, May 29.
The naaie "01 Colonel William Mac-
Donald was presented by President Colin
M. Boyd and accepted. A letter of ac
ceptanc* was received from Robert Dick
son.
Chief D. R. McNeill of the Caledonian
Club stated tiiai the picnic of his club
this year would surpass anything hereto
fore attempted, as each and every mem
ber would resolve himself into a commit
tee of one to make the affair a decided
success. He had received a coaimunica
tionjfrom Thomas McKay of Dairy, Scot
land, the champion hammer-thrower of
the country, notifying him that he (Me
Kay) would cross the Atlantic and the
continent to dispute honors with Thoma-s
D. Carroll, the world's champion hammer
thrower, of the Cali.'donian Club 01 this
City. This, with oiher athletic sports of
which the Scotch people were the world's
leader?, would .be introduced at ihe com
inn festival.
First Chieftain John Reid stated that
be had in contemplation the giving of a
mammoth barbecue on the 29th of May.
The stock which it was propose! to slaugh
ter for this festivitl was now being put on
full diet. Several offers hail been recieyed
Irom prominent bnsiness houses donating
presents and prizes for the day.
George Davidson, real estate agent,
spoke in a most encouraging manner over
i he prospects oi rea izing a handsome sum
Irom the picnic.
Chairman C. M. Boyd fully coincided
with those views and stated" that every
mail brought words of encouragement
and offers of ai-si.sla.nce, both from men of
means and men of talent. All were
willing and ready to do what lay in their
power to assist the committee. With such
as-urance at this stage of the proceedings,
he saw no reason to doubt that the under
taking wouhi be a grand success and one
that every Scoichman and every lover of
poetry would be proud to look upon. The
comraittee meetings in the futuro will be
ai the call of the chair.

THE CRUSADE
FOR PURE FOOD
First Legal Gun Fired in
Judga Campbell's
Court.
Demurrers Filed Against the
Complants on Various
Grounds.
Able Arguments of Counsel for the
D ff.-r nt Defendants and for
the Prosecution.
The first legal Â«;nn in the pure food cru
saue was tired in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday afternoon. There was an in
terested crowd in the courtroom, and the
arguments of counsel were listened to
with deep attention.
The defendants were represented by
able counsel. J. W. Dorsey appeared on
behalf of Chris Nuhrenberg, ex-Judge A.
A. Sanderson for J. Barclay Smith, Wai
J. Tu>kafor J. Levi, W. M. Sanderson for
A. Quade, and D. J. Donovan for William
Cline. Assistant District Attorney Joseph
J. Dunne appeared as special prosecutor.
On behalf of William Cline, who was
charged with selling an imitation of rasp
berry syrup, Attorney Donovan pleaded
not guilty and demanded a jury.
The case was set for trial Monday after
noon.
Then came the legal light. Attorney
Dorsey filed a demurrer to the complaint
against Chris Nuhrenberg, who was
charged with selling a brand of condensed
miik containing a mixture of glucose, and
having one-tnird of butter-fat extracted
from it.
It was alleged that the complaint was
defective on various grounds. There was
no allegation as to whether tho one-third
removed or the two-thirds remaining wa3
mixed with glucose or that the article
was injurious' to health. It could not be
an offense if it was not injurious to health.
There was no allegation that it was of
fered for sale with ''the intent to commit
an offense nor that it was offered for sale
as food, which was most essential.
After speaking at length on the various
points, Attorney Dorsey said that if there
was a conviciion the case would be ap
pealed to the higher courts.
Ex- Judge Sanderson tiled three demur
rers on betialf of J. Barclay Smith, who
was charged with selling two different
brands of condensed milk not having the
neces-ary fat and with selling honey
mixed with cane-sugar syrup. .Regarding
the milk, he contended that there was no
standard laid down in the adulterated
food act, and therefore there could be no
violation of tha law. In regard to the
honey, who ruined it with sugar-cane
syrup? It was probably the bees them
selves.
Attorney Wai J. Tuska followed with a
demurrer on beiialf of J. Levi, a whole
sale merchant, who was charged with sell
ing adulterated lood in the shape of potted
meats. He took the ground that as the
cans came to the wholesaler hermetically
sealed, and he could not therefoie know
ingly be iiware of the condition of the
contents, he could not be charged with
violating the law. The law provided that
a sample should be submitted for analysis,
bin this had not been done. He ingeni
ously argued that different people had
different lasies in regard to meat, some
preferring the fresh and others when it
was "paniey," and who could say what
was and what was not tainted meat.
A'.torney M. W. Sanderson submitted a
demurrer on bcliall of A. Quade, cliarerd
with celling evaporated cream which did
not contain the necessary ingredients. He
argued on similar lines to the others.
Assistant District. Attorney Dunne re
plied to the arguments of tne attorneys
lor the defendants. He pointed out that
in different States there were laws similar
in character to tiieone here governing the
sale of Eduiterated food and the courts
had laid down the law applicable to such
cases. In his opinion there were only two
iacts to be proved â was there a sale? and
did they sell articles that were adul
terated? Unless the defendants could
show that there was no sale and t- at if
there was a sale that the articles were not
adulterated there must be a conviction.
In the case of food there were seven of
fenses laid down, as lollows: First, mix
ture, something mixed with an article
originally pure; second, substitution,'
where an inferior or cneaper substance is
substituted; third, abstraction, where a
valuab.e or necessary constituent, wholiy
or in part, is abstracted; fourth, if an
imitation of another articie is sold in the
name of another; fifth, where an article
is sold which conies lrom a source that is
putrid; sixth, if an article is coated, pol
ished, colored or powdered whereby it is
made to appear better than it really is ;
seventh, if an article of food contains
any ingredient which is injurious to
health.
He ,vould take the broad ground that
knowledge or lack of knowledge on the
part of the vender was a wholiy false
quantity and cut no figure in the case be
cause tne vender was bound at his peril to
know that the articles be offers for sale
are not adulterated. He would even go
further and contend that if the vender
was at) oiutely innocent he must be con
victed because criminal intent was a false
quantity. Two defenses could only be
offered, either that they did not sell or
that the lood was not adulterated.
Referring 10 the demurrers, he said that
the most valuable point raised was that
the coinpluint did not allege "being sold
c s articles of food. " Replying to that, he
cited a decision in the Ohio courts that
the complaint need not allege that the
article was sold as human lood.
Afier further argument the Judge sug
gested that new complaints should be
drawn out that would be satisfactory to
the defense, but neither side was willing
to agree to tne proposition and the Judge
said he would give- his decision on the de
murrers on Monday before the jury trial
in Cline's case was commenced. All the
other cases were continued till Monday.

A FAMOUS ATHLETE.
Arrival of Ex-Alderman Dunne,
a Champion Handball
Player.
He Will Contest Against Two Well-
Known Ball â¢ Smashers
To- Day
Next to Phil Casey the greatest hand
ball-player of the world is ex-Alderman
James Dunno of Brooklyn, N. Y.
Mr. Dunne is now over 65 years of age
and does not look to b3 50 years, so well
is the athlete preserved. It is uot more
than a few months ago when Dunne and
Casey defeated the two champions of Chi
cago in bent seven out of eleven games of
21 aces. It was a contest of two old men
against two young men, and the old ones
came out victorious. The consideration
was $1000 a side and the double-handed
championship of the world.
Mr. Dunne arrived yesterday from New
York and wiil leave this City on Monday
evening for Carson in the company of Al
Smith, the stakeholder of the big tight,
and Colonel John Hopkins, the well
known manager of theatrical shows.
Yesterday Phil Ryan of the San Fran
cisco handball court received a visit from
Mr. Dunne, who played one game of ball, i
using the spheres he brought with him
from New York. The Eastern handballs
made by Phil Casey are smaller and more
springy than the balls used by the players
of this coast.
Mr. Dunne agreed to play a match game
thi-* afternoon, as a large number of the
lovers of handball are very anxious to see
him perform. The games arranged are
the best three out of rive, between Dunne
and Bonnet against Nealon and Lenihan.
The contests will take place this afternoon
at the San Francisco bull court, and, as
this may be the last opportumiy the de
votees of the game will have of seeing ex-
Alderman Dnnne punish a handball,
doubtless a large gathering will be present,
particularly as the admission to the court
will be :ree on this occasion.
Mr. Dunne says that the sports of New
York are nearly all strong Corbett men,
and that they will betlarge sums of money
when they learn positively from their
friends that the Californian is in condition
to go a hard race.
NEW TO-DAY.
ABOUT ELECTRIC BELTS.
17 VERY ONE KNOWS NOW THAT ELECTRICITY, WHEN PROP-
erly applied, is a cure for many forms of disease and weakness. Of
course every one knows that disease can't exist in the body while all its
functions are working well. If they are not working properly it is because
they are too weak to do so, and Electricity restores their vim and energy;
therefore the best way to apply electricity is the best cure. 1 Scientific men
say that an even, steady current applied for hours at a tim 9, the mild,
soothing current, is most effective. This is all in favor of the famous
Electric Belt,
It has been a recognized cure for many years. Dr. Sanden has devoted
30 years to its perfection, and it now has features, such as current reg-
ulator, insulated batteries, and non-irritating conductors, not found in
any other electric appliance on the market. For body wear, for con-
venience, power of current, effectiveness and durability (guaranteed one
year) it has no equal. None that have any merit are sold cheaper. On
this point, however, Dr. Sanden takes a decided stand. He will not
make a cheap belt, and will not sell one. It is the cheap, so-called elec- ,
trie belts that have caused whatever prejudice people have against the k
article. Like cheap jewelry, cheap electric belts are a fraud. Dr. f
â¢Sanden's are made to cure, and they do.
Did you read Dr. Sanden's boot, "Three Clashes of Men" ? It gives letters from

Opposed.

_â â â
There is-every prospect of a lively time
in the Can Francisco Produce Exchange
on Monday next when the organization
meets in special session to consider a pro
posed change In the constitution of the
exchange.
The board of directors propose to amend
section 23 of article 5, so as to prohibit
members from having dealings of any
character with the outside concerns that,
in the parlance of the exchange, are called
"bucket-shops."
Not only are they not to deal with them,
but they are prohibited from giving them
information, receiving information from
them, and even from communicating with V
them. i
Should the amendment carry, the first^
offense will be punished by suspension
and the second by expulsion from the
exchange.
It is understood, however, that a bitter
fight is to -made against the amendment
by an element in the exchange that
objects to restrictions being placed about
its dealings and movements. These
brokers claim that the policy of the board
of directors is narrow-gauge and that if it
is allowed to dominate the members to too
great an extent the result will be dis
astrous to the interests of tho
organization.
"It is a well-understood fact," said a
prominent member, who did not care to
nave his name used, "that this amend
ment is directed particularly against one
bucket-shop which is doing a considerable
business. It is all very well to shut
bucKet-shop proprietors out of the ex
changeand this was done in the case of
the very man they are trying to down
but the members will not tolerate such re
strictions. The matter amounts to this:
"At the exchange no transactions are
allowed where the margin deposited is
less than $2SJO, while in these outside
houses operations that only require a few
dollars can be carried on.
"For some reason the directors|have got
it into their heads that if they run Hie
bucket-shops out of existence theexchango
will get the business they now transact.
This is not the case, for few of the bucket
shop operators hava $200 and could not
afford to deal through the exchange.
"I do not propose to be reported and
suspended if I meet a man on the street
and stop to talk to him. Yet such would
be the result should this pernicious amend
ment be allowed to go into our constitu
tion and by-laws. I anticipate a lively
seesion on Monday and feel sure that the
amendment will be defeated."

Las-Meeting Last Night and
Ta'k of Forming a Cor

Visionary Schemes nd a Bare Larier.
Wil R;g.ster To-Day for a
Ctiance to Work.
The unemployed ended yesterday with
a talkative mass-meeting that aid not ad
journ until an hour before midnight.
There was no meat in the iarder nor
any bread,. and there had not been all
day, but that was not what immediately
concerned the 630 men who sat or stood
in the big dingy nail at iheir headquar
ters. Seated behind a small table with
its poor little oil iamj> were the chief offi
cers of the organization, and ranged in
front in concentric rows were men seated,
j>nd further Laefc in the less certain light
men standing and craning forward over
hose in front eagerly attentive to each
tvpeaker's remarks. There were many
k. Id heads in the hatless throng.
The main discussion was what rate of
wages should maintain for the pro
; osed boulevard work. Some favored an
emphatic resolution to the effect that a.
( ; .<.!iar a day would not be sufficient But i
counsel prevailed, and it was de
cided not to enter a protest against some
g that had not yet been decided upon
by the citizens' relief coumitte.
Tins morning at 9 o'clock those of the
unemployed that wish to regis'.er for a
chance at the boulevard work will present
tnemselves at the building at the corner
of Sacramento and Leidesdorff street-,
opposite the What C^eer House, which
jiince has been secured by the citizens'
committee as a headquarters.
The men that register will also answer
the following questions: Are you mar
ried or single? How long have you been
in t-an Francisco? How long have you
t.een out of work? How many persons I
are dependent upon you for support?
Unmarried men will not be ruled against,
tis it is known that some of them have
others dependent upon them als Â». The
Associated Charities, the Poiice Depart
ment, clergymen and the Salvation Army
will all be asked to assist in investigating
â¢lie cases ot applicants for work, so that
i he most deserving may be given employ
ment as soon as the boulevard is started,
and that may be next Monday.
The fund sesterday reached $6658, and
there are enough promising possibilities
i ! more in sight to make the total amount
practically $10,000.
When Presidt-nt .Leffingwell reported at I
the meeting last night that there is $233
on hand in the treasury of the unemployed
suggestions were launched from ail parts
or ihe motley crowd as to the disposition
tuat should be made of it, regardless of j
the consideration that the food supply is
vt-ry low and that daring the day it be
e me necessary to spend about $15 jor
potatoes and other supplies that failed to
come i:i through the former free chan
nels. Tne anarchistic element would buy
fiearm*.
Another proposition was for the pur- j
cause of proVi>:ons. Another was for the j
publication and circulation of socialistic
literature, advocating the idea t"at the
Government should provide work to tiiose
of:ts citizens tuat are unable to get it
otherwibe. Another yet would have the
money spent for dynamite bombs, with
wh:c:i to create an explosion that would
cause thinking tieopie to realize the grav
ity of tt:e bitua ion, and tne Â«i/nifi-janr.e
(.fan army ot men unable to get work.
None of these motions prevailed. Ihe
whole matter was laid uu the table.
A proposition that received more uni
form and thoughtful consideration was
one for the incorporation 01 Hie unem
ployed for the purpose of maintaining a
permanent home and a permanent em
ployment headquarters. A vacant ho:e!
somewhere on Fifteenth street was looked
upon a* a su table home. To the execu
tive committee was referred the matter of
drawing up articles of incorporation, to
be submitted at one of the eariy succeed
ing meetings.
During the day the relief committee
arted upon and relieved fifty cases of male
applicants for old ciothes and twelve cases
of fÂ»male applicants. There was a fairly
supply of o'd c.othes to choose from,
but old shoes and underwearâ the roost
sadly- n-ede i â  articles â are very scarce.
Anything of such a nature will be gladly
received at headquarters, as there are
preat <md constant demands for under
cluthina and shoes. Three sick cases were
reported, and were furnished medical aid.
NEW LIGHTS FOfi VESSELS.
Present System Does Sot Give Sufficient
' o * o Insurance Ajjiin*: Collisions.
Increasing speed of ocean-going steam
craft is likely before long to necessitate a
radical change in the character of sailing
light?, says the New York Time?. The
red (port) and green (starboard) side
lights now u. ed on vessels at sea are re
quired by the rules of the road to be visible
' for two miles on a dark, clear night. The
Â» ile was made, however, when ten knots
mas good speed. Now twenty knots is not
' common.
Masthead lights used by steamers must
be visible for five miles on a dark, clear
night, but the lookout on another vessel
cannot i- 11 from the light the direction
in which the vessel carrying it is steam
â¢ ing. To determine, therefore, what course
to take in order to keep clear of another
vessel the master must depend on the
side ligit-ts, which, as prescribed, under
the moat favorable conditions can be
â¢ seen on two miles distant.,. In misty
weather, or in moonlight they cannot be
seen so far..
' Vessels going in opposite directions at
the rate. of twenty knots an hour are, of
5 course approaching each oiht-r at the rate |
of forty knota an hour. The time in which .
they cover the two miles between tnc j
points of -sighting and of -passing is shown
in the nroporlion as forty knots is to sixty
â¢ minute?, two miles is to three minutes.
j In other word- there is only three minutes I
in which 'to change courses, if that is i
Â°" necessary, under the most favorable con- I
.ditions of visibility. . ,\
As the fast vessels are very long, they
S^eer slowly, and three minutes is but
'U^iJe time for action, while, it the nece.-
--Â§ sity occurs in the more prevalent weather
of moonlight or mist, the time is lessened.
The Pans some time ago, then the City
of 0 Paris wliiie bound into port and not
far from .Sandy Ho was in collision
with the British tramp ship Delano,
bound out. Both of these vessels carried
Hgnts that exceeded the requirement-*,
iyet they were unable to get out of each
A'jthc-r's way.
1 Another difficult? is met in the case of
salting vessels. They carry only side
â  lights, which are sometimes placed on the
forward rigging and sometimes on davits
at the quarterdeck. A sailing vessel has
the risht of way over a steamer. The
Â» Plant line steamship Mascot, bound from
o Boston to Bar Harbor, once ran into a
Â° tnree-maated ice schooner and cut off her
stern. Allowance had been made for the
. lights being aft at the quarterdeck. . When
it happened they were on the forward
shrouds.
Besides the questions of visibility and
position of lights there is another. The
sidelight of a vessel is partially boxed in,
but gives a radius of vision of 112}$ de
grees, or from dead ahead to two points
abaft the beam, there being l^A decrees
to a point of the compass. The exact di
rection of another ve^e/s course cannot
therefore be determined within that ra
dias.
A French admiral once got up a system
of lights in which various colors were
used, but it was so complicated that it
was rejected, and others since devised
have been rejected for the same reason, or
because of lacfc of visibility. Instantane
ous action requires simplicity.
Thp German Government some time ago
appointed a commission to study the visi
bility of lights at sea. It was found tiiat
a white li^ht of one-candle power was visi
ble 2600 yards on aclear night in a dark
atmosphere. If the weather was misty it
n-as visible one mile. Three-candle power
was visible two miles, ten-c:mdle power
four miles and nineteen-candie power live
miles.
A green light, with glass of pure green,
was visible with 1-candle-power at an
eighth of a mile, 2-candle-power at one
mile, 15-candle-power at 2 miles, 01-candie
power at three miles, and 106-candle
power at four miles. A red light, with a
glass of pure copper red, showed like re
sults.
Four miles would be a desirable dis
tance of visibility, but 106-candle-power
would be almost out of the question for
most vessels. As frequent changes in the
rules of the road in me matter 'of lights
would add to confusion, any scheme for
improvement must anticipate the most
sanguine estimate of future speed, which
may perhaps be figured at a four-day
journey across the Atlantic. The ques
tion is one that is of interest not alone to
mariners, ship-owners and shippers, but
to all immigrants and tourists, and,
through these, wHi-nigh everybody else.
The big Atian ie liners exceed require
ments in tne matter of visibility of lights,
while the majority of craft may fall short
cf requirements. Poor oil i u-ed on many
a tram and sailing-vessel, while lights are
often obscured by sail and gear.
An ideal system must be simple, pr6
vide for great risibility and indicate as
closely as possible the sruline direction.

Straits, in Wh eh 104 Men, Women
and Children Drown.
VANCOUVER, B. C, March 11.â The
steamer Empress of India arrived this
morning from the Orient. A new ques
tion baa arisen in regard to the monetary
system, the Ministers of State and other
officials advocating an immediate change
to the gold standard. So far, however, no
official plan nas been brought forward,
though it fs seated that a biil will be sub
mitted to the diet during the present ses
sion for the proposed change in the cur
rency. Opinions appear to be divided on
the subject, officials generally advoca-ing
the change, while Osaka cotton manufac
turers and export merchants generally
are adverse to it.
Business generally remains very slack,
owing to the tightness of money and the
unsettled state of financial affairs.
A terrible accident happened on Satur
day, January 23, to a boat crossing the
Haitang Straits from HaiKao. She had
10S passengers on board, and when not far
from the Unhang shore sank from being
| overloaded. One hundred and four per
sons were drowned, among whom '.ere
j three children, the son and daugnters of
the chief pastor of tiie American Meth

Peculiar Experience of a Prospector in
Jiriti*h Columbia, WMt* l^ott.
VANCOUVER, B. C, March 11.â Here
is a plain tale from the nills. A pros
pector named Hughes was caught in a
"snowstorm near Lillboet, and losing his
way wandered about till his food was ex
hausted..
He found an abandoned hut at last and
lit a tire, bat there was nothing to eat,
and the gnawing of hunger caused him to
recall to his mind all the stories he ha-i
heard of shipwrecked crews and enforced
cannibalism. He staid her** two days.
His big. long-tailed do;:. Jack, had beiui
his constant companion since starting
out, and the thought struck him that
peruaps before reaching home be would
have to make a meal off his faithful
friend.
And why not commence with the doe's
caudal extremity. To make a long "tail"
short, a* it were, he took his prospector's
ax and in a minute the deed was done.
The dog's tail was toasted, and after
Hughes had replenished the inner man,
he threw the remains to Jack, who
eagerly devoured his own bones.
This cave both dog and man strength to
proceed and shortly after coming upon
marks that he knew Hughes was ere long
enjoying the warmth and comfort of the
Pioneer Home at Liliooet, and every time
it seemed too long between drinks that
evening old Jack wou:d wag his bloody
stump.

for Five Days
As previously announced in the mili
tary department of The Call the Cadet
Corps, Lowell High School, attached to
the First Regiment Infantry, Second
Brigade, N. (i. C, will go into camp in
Niles Canyon, Aiameda County, during
the vacation week at the school.
The corps will have nearly sixty mem
bers at the camp. They will be under the
supervision of Major Sime of the First
Regiment. The elective officers of the
j corps are: L. E. Edwards, captain;
Georee M. Lipnian, first JiÂ» utenant, and J.
I A. Morgan, second lieutenant.
The camp will be Jaid out on the picnic
! ground in the canyon, and there will bo
j twenty-live tents, which have been loaned
to the cadets by Major Huber, retired, ln'.e
of the Second Artillery. This morning
the advance guard, consisting of First Ser
geant Evans, Servant Cowley, eorumib-
I sary; Corporal Bartlett, quartermaster,
| and Privates Berry, McDonald, Me
' Kowan, Reynold^, Bash and Auerbacli will
j leave by the 11 o'clock train for the camp
I site and pitch tents and prepare the camp
j for the ether cadets, who will follow on
Saturday morning.
The main body will cross by the ferry
i and ride as far as Hayward by steam and
I electric cars from Oakland Point, and
; from there will march to the camp about
; nine n;iles distant, reaching there in time
j for supper, and that night there will not
j he any military duty except guard mount.
ThÂ« cadets will be in service uniform. It
is the purpose ot Captain Edwards that
tins shall be a military camu of instroc-
I iio:i in the strict sense of mat term. The
J cadets all under.-uai.d that and they have
given the officers their hearty and enthu
siastic approvn! of the i_iea. The captain
bus obtained from each of ihe cadets' par
j ents s. written consent that "tne bearer
shall report for duty at such time and place
as may be ordered by the proper officers.
The camp is to established with the
knowledce and consent of Lieutenant-
I Colonel Duboce, who has given the cadets
some excellent advice, and has rendered
them valuable assistance in the prepara
tion for ihe military outinc. He, how
ever, stipulated tiiat no iir^Vor shah bo
allowed and no bail cartridges shall be
taken. There will bo two phys'.cinns to
I Jook after t c cadets in case of sickness.
Lieutenant-Colonel Cluff, division com
missary, has provided for the cadets so
that they will nave all the rations that
they will requirf. The commissary de

Senzeant Cowley and Corporal Simon.
Tn<? cadets will meet the expends out of
the $400 yeariy allowed by the State. It
will be the first time that the company
has gone on its own hook for practical
instruction in field duty. The company
has on previous occasions been to a regi
mental or battalion camp, but this time,
being entirely independent, the members
propose to make the venture one that will
redound not only to their own credit, but
to the credit of the National Guard. After
Sunday there will he drill and full mili
tary routine daily. The camp will be open
to visitors during its continuance, an 1
sometime during the encampment L.eu
tenant-Colonei Duboce will pay it a visit,
when there will be a drill and inspection.
Professor Morton, principal ol the Lowel!
Hisrh School, where the cadets have their
armory, is an enthusiastic supporter of
the movement. He has done all in his
power to encourage his punils in their
undertaking, and he declarer t tint he felt
sure that It would prove beneficial to the

physical standpoint.
SHELLEY'S ODD WATS.
Some Light on the Great Poet's Va
garies.
His food consisted mainly of bread and
raisins. Broad, steeped 10 hot water and
sprinkled with sugar and nutmeg, which
he called panada, he devoured wiili avid
ity. Hogg relates, of a period slightly an
terior to this, many amusing inconsisten
cies. A certain dinner at (Shelley's lodg
ings had been a terrible failure. "Never
mind,' eaid Airs. Shelley, "we will have
muffins for tea." .
"Muffins!" said Shelley, in a tone of
agony, "they will butter them"; but when
they arrived buttered, he devoured them
with a relish.; .
On another occasion Shelley and Hoc:
were ai- a country inn. Roje ordered
bacon. Shelley was,plunged in grief and
gloom at the thought; but when ir ar
rived he Tose from his' placÂ» and plunged
a fork into the dish before Hog,^.
"So this is bacon!" said lie. "Well, it
is not so bad, after all." In a few mo
ments the dish was empty, and Hogg had
eaten little. Another and another dish
was produced until the bacon was ex
hausted, and they left the house. Shelley
gravely scolded the landlady for notbeinj.'
better supplied. Thence ; they hurried
bom*, and Shelley bur*t in unon his wile,
requiring that bacon should be instantly
produced in lure quantities. :.- ;.
Slielley had Home oddities In the way of
; friends. Mr. Newton was a philosopher
of the kind that Shelley loved. lie and his
family ate nothing but vegetables and
drank only distilled water. The five chil
dren were required to spend some hours cf
each forenoon without any clothes onâ
nakedizinsr, as Mr. Newton called it â as a
return to primitive innocence. To these
agreeable orgies Shelley was often ad
mitted.
Huge relates that he cahed at the house
one day, and, mistaking him for Shelley,
the five babies came downstairs, just as
they were, to greet him. On seeing a
stranger "they uttered a piercing cry,
turned around and ran wildiy upstairs,
screaming aloud. The stairs presented the
appearance of a Jacob's ladder, with the
angeis ascending it, except that they
moved faster and made more noise than
the ordinary representatives of the pa
triarch indicate."â Mac in ilian' a Magazine.
THE STEAM WHISTLE.
The Useful Tooter Was Invented in the
Interest of the -Kj;g Trade.
It is told that the locomotive whistle
was invented because of the destruction of
a load of eggs. When locomotives were
first built the country roads were for the
most part crossed at grade and the engine
driver had no way of giving warning of his
approach except by blowing a tin horn. The
horn, it may be imagined, was far from
being sufficient warning. One day in the
year 1833 a farmer of Thornton was cross
ins: the railroad track on one of the country
roads with a great load of eggs and butter.
Just as he came out upon the track a train
approached. The engine man blew his
horn lustily, but the farmer did not hear
it. Eighty dozen of eges and fifty pounds
of butter were smashed into an indistin
guishable, unpleasant mass and mingled
with ihe kindling-wood to which tue
wagon was reductd. The railway com
-1 pany had to pay the farmer the value of
his wagon. It was considered a very se
rious matter, and straightway a director
of the company, Ashk-n Baxter by name,
went to Alton Grange, where George
Stephen^on lived, to see if he could not
invent something that would give a warn
ing more likely to be heard. Stephenson
â¢ went to work and the next day
I had v contrivance which, when at
| taciiPti to the engine- hoiier and the
I steam turned on, gave a shrill
i discordant sound. The lailroad directors,
greatly delighted, ordered similar contriv
ances attached to all the locomotives, and
from that day tb this she voice of tue loco
motive whistle has never been silent.

Tafs Clever retort.
An Englishman and an Irishman, trav
eling together on a tramcar, began to dis
cuss the merits of their respective coun
tries, and, becoming rather excited, were
cautioned by the conductor to Keep quiet.
In order to have a parting shot at the
Irishman, the Englishman said:
"Well, Fat, I suppo-e yuu must keep
quiothere; but if 1 had you in a forty
ucie field, I would make you run all over
it."
"Yee," replied Pat, "you would; but,

BUTLER'S HOPES
SLOWLY FADING
Judge Morrow Declines to
Give Him His Lib
erty.
The Writ of Habeas Corpus Dis
posed 0: in Short Order
Yesterday.
Attorney B ai Wi 1 Appeal the Case
1o the Supreme Ciurt of the
United States.
United States District Judge Morrow,
sitting in the United States Circuit Court,
made short work yesterday morning of
murderer Butler's effort to gain his liberty
on a writ of habeas corpus.
The writ was sued out by Attorney
Black, who is doing bis utmost to aid
Builer in his efforts to avoid going back to
Australia, on the ground that United
States Marshal Barry Baldwin exceeded
bis authority in arresting Butler on board
the Swanhilda.
He contended that a British ship was
British territory and that it made no
difference whether she was in a foreign
harbor or not. Batler, he contended, was
on a British dect and under the British
flag, ami the Marshal had no right to take
him therefrom. He also claimed that it
was necessary to prove that the murderer
was a fugitive from justice and that this
had not been done.
Judye Morrow's opinion was not a
lengthy one. He merely stated that the
plea whs a most remarkable one and that
the grounds taken by the counsel were
untenable. He stated that, in his opinion,
sufficient, evidenc had bsen produced to
show that BuJer was a fugitive l'rom jus
tice and thai he had been arrested in ac
cordance with the extradition treaty ex
is:ing between this country ana Great
Britain.
The testimony o!' Captain Fraser of the
Swanhilda that But'.er had asked several
times to be discharged at San Francisco
was sufficient evidence in the Judge's
mind to show that the murderer was in
intent "a criminal fleeing from justice
and seeking an asylum in this country."
"it wouid be foohsn," Judge Morrow
added, "to hold that tlie prisoner at the
bar should be freed merely because he
was arrested on board the Swanhilda, a
British vessel."
He therefore dismissed the application
for the writ and remanded Butler to the
custody of the Marshal.
Unless further steps are t;-ken by But
ler's attorney he will be taken back to
Australia by the next steamer, extradition
pai ers now being on the way from Wash
ington.
As the main object seems to be delay it
is probable that an appeal will be taken
from Judge Morrow's decision and time
gained in that manner.
Attorney Black stated yesterday that
such would be his cour?e" and that he
would at once prepare the necessary pa
pers.
A luriouD J! uiiu(;c
A curious marriage was that of Nathan
Hanes, the wealthiest man in West Vir
ginia. Some weeks ago Mr. Hanes, who
is 75 years old and a widower, advertised
in leading newspapeis that he wanted a
wife. "Lightning results" followed. An
Ohio girl's letter pleased Mr. Hanes so
much that be arranged a meeting, and
married the applicant for his affections at i
once. The girl, on setting out to meet
! her future husband, did not tell her
parents where she was going. When she
wrote to them a few days after her disap
pearance she was able to describe a whole
host of her new relations, among whom
were grandsons and granddaughters
many years her senior.

A gentleman long connected with the artistic advertising department of the YoutKt
Companion, Boston, relates that he had his attention called to ; 'â ' ' '. ;
by a business acquaintance who expressed a high opinion of them. He had been a
good deal troubled with what he described as a nervous, bilious condition that ap-
peared to be brought on from time to time by high pressure work or special mental
activity or excitement, such as would be common at periods of unusual nervous ten-
sion. It becam: his practice at such times to take a Tabule just one at the mo-
ment that he observed the difficulty approaching. It made no difference when. A
favorable result was invariably apparent within twenty minutes. The only notice-
I able effect was that he always felt all risht in twenty minutes if he took the Tabule ;
while if he did not. the nervous uncomfortable feeiini* intensified and led to a bad
afternoon and tired evening: He now carries them with him all the time, but doesn't
have occasion to apply to them anything like as often as he did at first. Nowadays
there are frequent periods of from a week to ten days, or even two weeks, during
which he finds that he has no occasion whatever to make use of the Tabules, but
still carries them in his pocket just the same, so that they may be ready if an occa-
sion occurs. : .Vi ; - I

Explanation.
Tbe arrow files with the wind. The top fig-ana
â¢t station indicate maximum temperature for thÂ«
days: those underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and bundredlhs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po<n s <â â¢! equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "bizh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in thÂ« interior
and low aloD; the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weÂ»ther may be expected "in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
JÂ»oduce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lii, March 11 âFollowing the
prorfd' nt the wheat market declined to-day on
the bullish Government report issued yesterda.-.
The farm reserve as given, 88,000,000 bushel?,
was the smallest but ODe on record, yet the wheat
trade exhibited no uneasiness. Liverpool, by
quoting unchanged prices, displaced the indiffer
ence existing on that side of the water, which may
have bud some bearing on the disregard affecte 1
by American markets. After declining about %
cent from tbe opening a siow recovery set! n, pre
dictions of a cold wave inducing shorts to cover.
Receipts In the Northwest were liberal at 328
cars â  aqalnst 317 lest Thursday and 350 cars a
year ago.
Chicago received eleven cars and inspected out
113.902 bushels. The Cincinnati Price Current
issued a favorable summary on crop conditions.
In me last hour offerings became heavy and prices
broke sharply. Export clearances were light at
â¢-'46.070 bushels. Closing Continental cables were
irregular. '1 he closing was the weakest point of
the session, some important selling of lone wheat
taking place. May whÂ»at openei fr>rn 741,4 cto

l oK.Sâ The Goverument report cf a farm re
serve of 1,164,000,000 bushels of corn had a weak
ening effect on the marÂ»Â«t at the open'ne. When
wheat strengthened subsequently, corn followed
the lead and recovered a fraction of the earlier
loss. Receipts wire light at 103 cars and 87 070 !
bushels were withdrawn from store. l.lv. ruool I
cables quoted i/id decline, An easier tone devel
op d in the last hour, the break in wheat exerting I
an adver.-e influence but prices suffered little.
Kxport clearances were heavy at 881, bush-Is. |

from yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 147 c <rs.
OATSâ Sympathy, with corn was the main In
fluence in the oats market, but there was also inde
pendent weakness at the start. The Government
estimate of a faun reserve of 313,000,000 bushels
was not deemed exactly favorable to higher prices.
Receipts were light at 170 cars. '1 here -were no
withdrawals from store. Export clearances
amounted to 211,835 bushels. May oats closed a
shade under yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow 228 cars

PR- VI BI The run of hozs at the yards was
small and the Influence from that quar.er made
pi ires strong. The natural 1 ond between th- live
hog market and the product ti.ereof caused the
la.ter to display firmness. Business wad lair with
no extraordinary fentuie to record. Late reports
from the yards gave the early advance list,
provisions suffering slightly In consequence. May
pork closed 5c higher, May lard i\. 2 @bc higher

HORSES ARE CHEAP.
Animals WorthlesH for City Use T>n
Well in the Country
Horses are cheap. Infect it is ililllrult
to see how it pays to raise them. A Brook
lyn expressman whose route is twelve
miles long secured a "green" teiiui yoHwr
<iay for $45. Two years ago he bought. ti
team not a whii better than thÂ« team pur
chased yesterday and gave $200 for mo
horses. Talking of his bargain (ho ex
pressman said to a Mail and Express re
porter:
"Farmers out on Ling Inland get tino
horses in the city lor from $10 to $'_'O. A
big horse whi<- . hits gone In me on the
ptiv^ment-i of the city will como urouud
all rit-'ht in a fow weeks if left to roam
around a pasture or barnyard. Tlio soft
earth will permit his cracked and fevered
hoo!s to mend. It would not pay to keep
the horse in the city, so a truckman or
any one of the big express companies
gladly seli a hoof-sore horse, no matter
how sound he may be otherwise, for a
SOUR.
"I prefer 'green' teams, because I can
break them more readily to my kind 01
woik. But $45 for such a team as I bought
yeÂ«ierday m kes mo Â»sharoÂ«**l to l<">k 'â¢Â«Â«
horses in tue face. Why, I sold a St. Ber
nnrÂ«l pup two month* oid ot long a^o ior
$60."â New York Mail and Express.

Dr. McLsan Did Much Good,
Though the Harbor Bill
Failed.
Oaklanders Will Probably Help
With the Fare From
Washington.
Council and Supervisors Expected to
Give Something Toward His
Expenses.
Oakland Office Sax Fbascisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 11. )
Dr. J. T. McLean, tne Health Officer ot
Aiameda, may nave to return from Wash
ington in the "same manner in which mem
bers of the third house returned from
Sacramento, unless he shall pay his own
expenses.
When Dr. McLean went to "Washington
there was every prospect that the last
Congress would make an appropriation to
improve the Oakland harbor, and with
this prospect in view a joint committee
composed of members of the commercial
ana official boards of Oakland and
Alameda proposes that the city and
I county governments should each bear a
A .and in defraying the doctor's expenses.
Alameda made the appropriation, but the
Oakland men were more conservative and
promised to recommend an appropriaiion
ii the mission ot Dr. McLean was suc
cessful.
From the Oakland standpoint McLean's
mission wa3 a dire failure. Instead of at
tempting to work through the appropria
tion bill as advised by the joint commit
tee, he i-sued a circular wuich had the
effect of killing off the whole proposition.
Under tnese circumstances the point is
now being debated a.s to whether Dr. Mc-
Lean's mission was such as to justify the
Oakland portion of the curumittee in rec
ommending to the Council that they pay
part of the doctor's expenses.
An informal meeting of tome of the di
rectors of the Board oi TraJe was held to
oay and the matter was discussed. Al
though it was staled thai the la lure ol
the appropriation bill might have been
due to Dr. McLean's inordinate desre to
see the tidal canal end of the estuary
finished first, he had done good work in
bringing the matter before the committees
o: the House at Washington, and it was
acknowledged that it might be a hardship
on the doctor, who is over 70 years ot ape,
to force iiim to walk or pay his own ex
penses back to Alameda.
As matters now stand with the new
Coneress Dr. McLean is in a position
where he can be ot j:reat benefit to the
harbor bill, and under the se circumstances
it is probable that the City Council and
the Board of Supervisors will be asked to
give 1-00 eacb to pay Dr. McLean's ex
penses.
THE ANTI-SALOON FIGHT
A'ameia L q-jor Men Will Or
ganzz for tbe Contest in
April Next.
Ihe Qa?sticns to Be Passed Upon by
Precinct; and Not by the City
as a Wiiole.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 11.â Inasmuch
as so many of tue candidates for munici
pal offices to be voted for on April 12 are
ou all three tickets in tbe fieid, rnuc . in
terest will be detracted from the fignt, so
far as the personality of the candidates is
concerned. Bat mere will be no Jack of
interest in the campaign, and it promises
to center largely, as in the Oakland elec
tion just held, on tbe saloon question.
The saloon-men recognize this fact, and
have already sent out circulars calling a
meeting, at wb eh they will organize to
do battle with the Anti-Saloon League,
which is in the field ready to fight in
tre cause of precinct prohibition. The
question of prohibition will not be sub
ji.uted on the proposiiion to cose all the
saloons, but to have the saloons closed in
any precinct which may ao elect, thus
leaving :hcm to run in precincts where
the voters in favor of so doing are in the
majority.
Th-ia proposition seems to meet with
more popular approval than would one to
summarily close all the saloons in the
city, provided a majority be obtained in
tunport of such a movement An exam
ination ol the licenses that have been
issued fa this city shows that there are
just twenty-three places licensed to sell
liquor in Alameda, or an average of about
one to each 700 of population. There are
thiiteen precincts in Alameda, and of
these three huve no saioons at all , one has
nix, one live, 'our two each and the other
three one each. The saloon men claim
. that in no p. ace in the State i~ tlieir bus -
kness conducted in more orderly fashion

ACCUSED OF SULKING.
Co-Eds Said to Lock Askance at
the Athletic Depart
ment.
Bee use th? Fasket.Ball Team Did
Not Gat Big "C's" They
Feel Hurt.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 11.â The
journalistic controversy at the Stare Uni
versity, instituted by the Occident, has
taken a decided turn and now the co-eds
are charged with sulking when they do
not get what they want.
It is asserted that they have refused to
support athletics because the basket-ball
co-eds were not awarded big "CV along
with the football men as emblems of ath
letic distinction.
Following is an epitome of an article
which appeared in the students' weekly
to-day in answer to a communicatio n
under the name of Diogenes, which has
had a rasping effect on some of the young
women:
Instead of defending themselves with a
womanly candor ana frankness that would
have well become a cause so deserving tuev
have been inclined to sulk and to "g -t even"
in a manner ratner suited to little girls In sun
bonnets ana pinafores than to dignified col
legians. We will not instance the present
affair as a case in joint. Possibly before this
matter drops some co-ed will arise and make a
dignihei and womanly refutation of D.ogenes'
assertions. We wish sue would, although we
can scarcely hope that she will.
We will refer 10 another case: About a year
ago the co-ed basket-ball players failed to get
big "C" emblems, to which, we are thoroughly
convinced, they were justly entitled. It is
true that no request was made on the part of
the co-eds for tne bite "( 's," but they were
nevertheless entitled to them, and in Deins;
refused them the co-ids were unfairly treated.
Since that time very few of the co-eds have
done anything to help the athletic association
of the un'verslty. We do not like to believe
that the former fact is toe cause, the latter the
effect. It is unpleasant to think that our sister
colleeians would resort to this means of petty
revenge â that they would tacitly thus aid
Stanford to bring about our ath. eticov rthrotv
merely to satisfy a feminine spite. Yet if re
ports are to be credited some such motive is
actuating the woman students in their refusal
to support college athletics.
We regret very much to see the co-eds act
thus. We are sorry to see them cast discredit
upon a just cause, and a cause which, if
pleaded with earnestness ana candor, could
not but be successful. If the co-ids felt that
their baske -b II players were entitled to the
emblems why did they not, womanlike, make
a frank r. quest for which they would not be
lacking champions? And if they feel ag
grieved at the comments of Diogenes why do
they not answer openly and becomingly? 'The
men studenU are not prejudiced against the
women they are proud ot them, as they
may well be, but they are not blind to their
faults. When the co-eds stand firmly mid
with dignity for what of right is theirs they
will always have stanch supporters to plead
their cause.

PROMISE IS KEPT
San Leandro, in Gala At

Gift.
Hundreds of Children Sing While
a Beautifu F.ag Is
Raised.
The Pretty Tcwn Proclaims a Holi

to Pleasure.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broa<lway. March 1L j
A few months ago P. S. Hastings of San
Leandro made a promise that if McKinley
were elected he would donate to his town
lhe largest flagstaff and flag that could be
found. The election last fall made it in
cumbent on him to keep bis promise, and
to-day the town of San Leandro was given
over to festivity.
The exercises partook partly of the
nature of a Republican celebration, a
patriotic flag- raising and a display ot
school children. Not less than 3000 peop'e
attended the ceremonies p.t the piaz.i and
as the day could not have been more
perfect everybody was encouraged to do a
little decorating, and the town has not
appeared so lively since the Democratic
County Convention over Iwo year- ago.
Promptly at 1 o'clock a detachment of
G. A. R. men fired a salute of minute
guns, one in honor of each star in the
flag. After the firing of the salute a pro
cession was formed with the veterans in
the lead and marched to the schoo'.house.
Five hundred little Americans cayly at
tired and carrying flags and flowers were

Joseph Herscherr, iHe chairman, gave
the order to rai?e the fly, and as soon as
it wra at tne masthead F. S. Hastings,
who is himself a veteran, made a pretty
little speech f<.rmi\lly presenting t >i e n\Â»j.

by B. L>. Gray, preside ni ol the Board of
Tru-tees, and he ihnnkeil the {river on
behalf of the town, everybody cho red and
waved their hats and the sound of grati
tude could be heard a mi c away.
W. fl. Lant don, president of ihe^day,
delivered a short address in which ho ex- |
pressed his entire approval of patriotic j
praci:ces which cannoi fail to create a |
fasting imj resnon for good in the minds |
of the yo ing, and cunnot help out increase
the fervor of those who have nearly com
pleted ihe battle of Hie.
The children then saluted the fl.ig and
accompanied by the band, sang in chorus, !
"Red, White ami Biue." Professor DÂ»W- I
barn in his -peech made the following I
reference to Comrade Hustings, who-e
patriotism had prompted him to donate
the flÂ«g:
One of the hoys In blue who hastened to

S. Hastings, who lias this day presented 1 1 â *

was, ho had a'.reauy been trained to urras In
his native State of Massachusetts. Bui he was

AN IMPORTANT SUIT.
Condemnation Proceedings Against the
Cohen Estate for the Opining of
a Greatly Needed Street.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 11.â The suit
for the condemnation of the land of the
Cohen property necessary for the opening
and extension of Lincoln avenue is set
down for trial before Judge Ogden on
Monday next.
City Attorney Tuylor is confident of ob
taining a judgment in favor of the city.
Property-owners affected by the opening
have almost exhausted their patience at
t:;e long deltys, and their disquiet was
made known at the City Trustees' last
meeting, when, represented by Eniile
Hirschfeld, a demand was made for action
or a return of the money paid for the im
provement or the actual opening of the
barricaded street.
The Cohen residence property is the
keystone to the situation in the northeast
ern end of the Aiameda peninsula. It
blocks Ihe proposed roadway from the
main railroad depot in Alamecia to prop
erty and residences east o: High street
and to all portions of the country east
ward, leaving a circuitous route to and
from the city by means of Santa Clara
avenue. An outlet for this district has
lon been wanted, and in compliance with
public demand the City Trustees ap-
pointed a commission to open the street.
The commission assessed the cost of work
at $7723 65. and awarded Mrs. Kmilie G.
Cohen $0100 dnmiiees for land taken as
against $3526 55, the assessment against
that land. The award was refused, and
Mrs. Cohen went to law to set aside the
proceeding?, and then the commissioners
instituted the enrdcnination proceedings.

Following is part of what he has to say:
The erst of living in a fraternity house varies
from $22 50 to $4."i per month.
The boiiruinK cubs are a sort of "communis

908 Broadway, March 11. j
Evangelist Munhall may have to pay
for several dinners in San Jose next Satur
day. Behind this probability are several
little incidentsâ some uleasant, some un
pleasant and some humorous.
At the present time Dr. Munhall is doing
his best to lessen the wickedness of Ala
nieda. He is holding meetings in the
uoper part of a hall on Park street, the
lower part of which is occupied by a bi
cycle club. The bicyclists are not always
riding their wheels, and in the evening
make a sort of lyceum of their clubroom.
During the past two weeks the sineing
of the evangelist choir has disturbed the
cyclists occasionally, and during the doc
tor's most earnest exhortation the laugh
ter and singing from the clubroom has
not always been enjoyed by those up
stairs.
A few days flgo a very courteous letter
was received by the evangelist, asking
that a confi rence he held so that the
singing upttaira and the merriment down
stairs miglit b- timed so that neither
would prove unpleasant to the oilier.
N;glit hi fore last while Dr. Munhail was
earnestly delivering his â¢'finally" he was
c onsiderably disturbed by the violent exit
ol several of the cyclists. '1 he noise they
made almost drowned the pastor's words
and he made some forcibie references to
the incident. The doctor's lancuagfi is
always forcible, and on this occasion bo
ns-ed the word *'ho< dlum. 1 ' This, of
course, provoked some op.osition on the
I'art of the ciub, and last night the evan

AN UNSOLVED RIDDLE
Rev. C. H. Hobart Asks Coun
cilman Manuel for More Light
on His Vote.
The Sunday C csing Matter Will Not
Dieâ Right to Critic z; Is
Discussed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 1L j
The challenge of Councilman Manuel to
Rev. C. H. Hobart has been partially ac
cepted. This afternoon the reverend gen
tleman published an ODen letter to the
Councilman, in which ne mates some
very poignant remarks.
Mr. Hobart commences his long disqui
sition by stating that the action of a pub
lic official is always open to public exam
ination and criticism, and assures Mr.
Manuel that his action in regard to the
closing of saloons on Sunday is being
judged in the light of his own actions.
By way of reminding the Councilman of
the basis for the present quarrel, which
was caused by tho statement that Mr.
Manuel had been bulldozed by saloon
keeper?, Mr. Hobart says: "At the re
quest of a large body of citizens of O.'k
land you and your feiiov.-Councilmen
agreed lo submit the Sunday-closing ques
tion to the people. Suddenly, unexpect
edly and preatly to the disappointment of
a large body of your fellow-townsmen,
you reconsidered your action and retused
to allow a free and official expression of
tlie people at the polls."
Mr. Hobart then referred to the fact
thai Mr. Manue' and Mr. Mott changed
their votes and were thus responsible for
the defeat of the measure, ami proceeds:
"Naturally we begin to seek a rea on for
such a sudden cilange of from on your
part. Soon we recalled the boycott with
whir.h you personally told us you were
threatened by the liquor dealers three
years ago, on account ot kindred Droposed
action. We recall similar measures by
liquor men in other plac<-s, and it seems
reasonable to conclude th it they were
once more applying to you the thumb
screws of the boycott. Thli conclusion
was the more ju>tilied as we observed that
the saloon-keepers were present in force
when you refuseti to allow the question to
come belore the people. Cuuncilmen are
sui posed to have good reasons for their
official actions, bat if you have ever as
signed adequate reasons for refusing to
allow your townspeople to voteon Sunday
clo-in 1 have failed to hear of it. It was,
therefore, i.aiura: thai we should attrinute
your actions to influences that, actor sing
to your own statement, were so forcibly
brought against y<>u two years ago."
The reverend gentleman then refers to
the ifIOOO which Councilman Manuel
offered yesterday if it coul.i be provpd
tuat h.s action was taken because 'of the
saloon men's dictation. He concludes]
"in closing, pernr.i me to sÂ«y that it -till
remains a riddie to tnousinas of citizens
what led our Couneilmeti to sucli reversal
ot action as wa* Witnessed recently in the
Council chamber. I guessed at the riddle
and you say I guested wrong. Well, 1
g,ve it up. Will you not give us the
answei ? It would please thousands of us

ADRIFT AMONG
STRANGE PEOPLE
Queer Predicament of a
Woman From Mendo
cino County.
Leaves Her Hotel for a Week
and Is Unab'e to Find It
Again.
She Speaks No English and Does Not
Enow the Nairn of the House
or the Street.
Mrs. H. Neilsen, a Russian Finn woman
who arrived here on Tuesday from Men
docino and who speaks no English, is in
exactly the same position as the Indian
who was seen walking aimlessly about the
street with his eyes lixed on the pave
ment. Asked if ne was lost he eravely
replied:
"Indian no lost. Indian here," tapping
his breast. "Trail lost."
Mrs. Neilsen denies that she is lost, but
admits she cannot find her hotel.
There is a very pathetic side to the story
that came out while the poor woman was
applying, with the aid ot an interpreter,
for assistance at the California-street
police station yesterday afternoon.
She came to this City to meet her hus
band, who had preceded her, and after
making some purchases they were to re
turn home. Sue Drought her little girl, a
child of four years, witti her, and went to
a hotel in the norttiern <p art of lne City.
The next afternoon she >:rew t'. r ed wait
ing for her husband, who was detained
by business els-wlicre, and started out for
a walk to see Hie sights.
Since then stie has been unable to find
her hotel, and with her cnild has wan
dered about asking many in her own
tongue for aid in timl njj her lodgings, but
recfivin? in most cases nothing but be
wildered stares.
On Wednesday night she applied at the
station, but. the po.ice could not under
stand ber and finally directed her to a
Russian Finn's house at 47 Sacramento
street, where she stayed over night, and
then started a^ain on her search lor the
her el.
Yesterday afternoon she came again,
this time wi:h a man who understood her
language, and tried to induce the police
to find the hotel. Sue said she was not
lost, but could not find the place where
she had lodged.
fche did not know the name of the house
nor the sireet it wason and could give but
a vague description of the place. From
what l.ttle could bo learned through the
interpreter it was surmised that shÂ»
meant the Chicago Hotel and she was
sent there.
She did not appear to be alarmed at her
predicament and the little child smiled
shyly at the big policeman as sue hung to
her mother's hand.

ears and rings on both hands. Her voice
is well modulated and she uses many ges
tures. The iady delivered her testimony
in a very effective manuer and was coru
plimenied even by opposing counsel on
tlie acumen she displayed in presenting
her side of the controversy in its strongrst
light. She wore a hat trimmed with jets,
and the glittering ornaments that milli
ners call aigieues shook defiantly, not to
say threateningly, at Attorney Schell
irom time to time as she answered his
troublesome que>t ons.
"You call yourself a clairvoyant, do you
not?" asked "Mr. Schell.
"Yes, sir."
"You pretend to foretell the future of
the Uve> of your subjects, do you not?"
"I have the power of clairvoyance, if
that is what you mean."
â¢\\ ill you please explain what you mean
by thai?"
"I know things intuitively, or by con
centration of the mind, as it weie. 1
have ttiat power. I do not pre
lend to explain it. The seat of
that power is just between the physical
eyes. It is a third eye just here," and she
tapped lier forehead between the eye
brows, bue does not seem to need a third
eye, as the iwu visual organs that are vis
iu.e to the ordinary oDserver appear to be
sufficient. They are black and piercing.
This avowal of supernatural power
appeared to overawe the lasvyer, for he
pursued that inquiry no further. He as
certained that sue preiehdec! to a kuowl- I
ed^e of yaimistry. She said she read
G d's lines on the hand and interpreted
his nifssage.
Magnetic healing she also professes, and
explained tutu stie cures by the laying on
01 hands. Sne rtqmres considera. Ie room
for Lief openition>, as it is necessary lor
her to tiirow tne evil print ipie ot tne
malady from her nnger-tipa at each move
ment, and she illustrated tne process by
t!i rowing her hands to her side with a
j-.-rky motion.
Coming to the case of Mr. Griggs, she
said thai when Uiey met she saw at a
glance that ne could not live. He applied
to her for a diagnosis of his case, and after
her usu;il formula had keen gone through,
including a mm at palmistry and the
like, t-he to:d him the trouble with him
â was that he had a pain at ttie pit of his
stomacii, caused by some foreign sud
stance. He did not deny that, and sue
asked hiru if he had ever drui.k from a
muuntam stream. He replied: "Oh,
yes. lam a n.iner, and ofiea drink from
me snow spriiiK"* oi the mountains."
"Then 1 asted him if lie remembered to
have ever swallowed a frog or a lizard.
" 'No,' he replied, 'out that reminds me
of one nme 1 was roobed. They gave me
cb!oro:orm and thrust the neck of the
boti.e and the stopper down my throat.
The piece of bottle and stopper were of
rubber, and they remained in my stomach
for a long time, but at last I pot some
medicine that r.-lieved me of them.'
"Then \ asked Mr. Griggs if he had ever
eaici any pors and he said: 'Why, yes,
wliiie I was In ttie mountains I almost
lived on hum and bacon.' So I said to
him, 'Well, that exp ains ii. That lias
made it worse."
Mr. Scneli called the attention of the
witness to the fact that all the physicians
in the case had testified that the trouble
of ihe dead man was notrin the stomach,
but was in the lower bowels, and asked
her if she was willing tc put lier clairvoy
ant diagnosis against tne expert opinion
of the medical experts, when they de
clared that tne trouble was in the lower
intestine^?
"Thai was a mistake. lie never had a
pain there, 1 ' was lier pos 11 ive reply.
When asked how she came 10 oe named
in ti e will for ?800 oi the Â§2H){) es.ate
â¢when she had known Mr. Griggs
only a few weeks, Mrs. Stewart
answered that her patient s-eenied
grateiul to her for ihe relief she
hud given him, ana that he wished to
enow nii appreciation. She said she
wrote 'he will strictly at his uictation.
She had not expected a legacy. Sue ad
mitted ihat she rubbed ins head and called
him "dear," but said she would do that
with any old man \ ho was her paiieni.
She also told with a merry laugh of how
Ehe combed his hair on one occasion, and
then related the fact that he cried when
he was about to move from the lodging
hou-e in which she lived. He kept his
door locked and she had a secret signal by
which she obtained admittance.
In the evidence it was developed that
Mrs. Stewart and a;iotber beneiiciary un
der the will signed as attesting witnesses,
and afterward she concluded that two dis
interested witnesses ought to be secured,
and that was done. She -aid the thought
that disinterested witnesses tught to be
obtained came to her after tne first sign
ing. "It might be called clairvoyancy if
you like," she added.
'â¢But why didn't clairvoyancy give you
that hint in the tirst time?' was sug
gested. The witness could not answer,
and the case was put over for argument.
DOUBLE-EAGLES JINGLED.
The Jocund Owner of Wealth Wag Dan
gerously Near Contempt of Court.
In Judge Slack's court yesterday some
one amons the spectators caused consid
erable annoyance by jingling money in
his pocket. The sound was like that of a
stack of $20 pieces being raised gen.tly by
the end of the thumb and then let drop
gently back nito their comfortable place.
It was a clear cÂ»se of contempt of court,
and if the bailiff could Dave detected the
culprit he would have been punished.
Several newspaper reporters were present,
bui they were not suspected by the
generous-minded Judge. The lawyers
appeared perturbed for a 9hort time as it
looked like a piece of neglect for tbrm to
let any of their clients be running loose
with ready money in their pocket?.
Finally a pletnoric-looking stranger who
looKed as if he might be from Chicago
and had strayed iiito the couriroom out
of a feeling of i<)le curiosity, arose and
passed out into the corridor, after whica
the nuisance was immediately abated.
Finod a Drug Clerk.
f. F. Michell!, a clerk in Leoa di Kola's drug-
store on Haight street, wan yesterday fined $50
by Judge Campbell for filling a prescnpiion
without being licensed to do so. The com
piaint was made by secretary Dawson of the
State Board of Pharmacy.
llirrlit Cooper's Will.
Gunnison, Booth and Bartnett hare filed a
somewhat contradictory document in the es
tate of ihe late Harriet Cootier. They first ad
mit that she died intfisiate and then allege
that she left a will that is olographic in form
and nverthat she was of sound mind when she
signed the instrument, nnd demand that tne
will shall be admitted to probate. In view of
the antagonistic element* of the pleadings the
decision of tne Probate Court will be awaited
with interest.

ROYALTY TO BE LAID
ON ELEVATORS.
Philip Einkle Sells for a Song
a Machine Valuable
as a Mine.
HZ WAS ALMOST PENNILESS
AND WANTED MONEY.
Owners of Passeug r-L:fters Infring
ing on the Device Will Bs
Forced to Pay
Fifteen years ago Philip Hinkle, the
pioneer elevator-builder of San Francisco,
invented and patented the use of an over
balance in connection wi;h an elevator
caee, which is destined to build up for
tunes for five prominent business me.i of
this State. Every electric c evator manu
facturing com pan y in America, according
to the present owners of the patent, has
infringed upon Mr. Hinkle's patent, and
inconsequence a surprise is in store for
them.-
The inventor of the mechanism, Philip
Hinkle, came to this State at any early
date. Being a machinist by nature as
well as by trade, he opened a factory for
the construction of mining machinery.
For a lime he prospered, but as competi
tion became greater snd greater as the
State developed he found that with his
limited capital he was unable to cope with
wealthier manufacturers, and he finally
became a bankrupt.
While searcning for employment one
day he chanced to pas* a building on Ban
some street in which was beinÂ»- con
structed the first ejevator used in this
City. He became interested in its opera
tion, and on investigation, finding that no
elevators were manufactured on this coast,
decided to make hi-, livelihood building
them. In this work he became associated
with A. J. McNicoll, and in a few years
they were the owners of a iactory and the
employers of a smali army of men. For
tune favored Hinkle, and in 1881 he was
accredited with being lhe possessor of
over $250,000.
In. 1882 he invented the over-weight
counterbalance mechanism, and, although
at that time there was but little use for bis
contrivance, most eievators being run by
' hydraulic pressure, he knew that when
other powers supplanted water his fortune
was made. The machine, it is claimed,
will save half the expense of running any
passenuer- carrier raised and lowered wuh
cables. This Mr. Hinkle was aware of,
and he patiently waited for the day 10
come when bis contrivance would be in
demand.
About that time, however, he took the
fatal sep of his life. He was then 72
years of agp, gray-haired, and his face was
furrowed with the lines of care. He be
came enamored of a young girl employed
in the house where he was residing, and
within a few months after the first meet
ing he, spoke of niarriaee to the young
woman. She Knew that he was wealthy,
accepted him, over fifty years her senior,
and they were married.
The wedding was solemnized in gor
reous styie. Sparkling wines and glitter
ing tokens were lavished <n the euests by
the hands of the aged and wealthy groom,
but at the end the old man found that he
had been deceived. The bride was sur
rounded by a host of designing women,
and Hinkle was soon drawn into the
meshes they laid for him. He was de
prived ot most of his patents, drawn into
the courts as the defendant in a divorce
suit inst gated by his wife and victimized
by many.
"In order to save a portion of his prop
erty he signed it away to men he supposed
were his friends, but again was lie de
ceived. Lawsuit followed lawsuit, and in
the end he was on the street â old, miser
able, deserted and penniless.
He had nothing left him bnt his ele
vator patent, but in his sorrow he forgot
this and elevator manufacturing compa
nie-, appreciating us value, useit it, and
now.it is said that it is in use on over half
the elevators in existence.
A few months a.-o H. L. Webber and
C. M. Weymann, who are employed in a
Jocal elevator manufacturing company,
ronclnde 1 to investigate the history of the
overba ance mechanism. They were
aware of the fact that all of the largest
manufacturing companies in America
u-ed ihe "strange device" and marveled
that no one appeared to claim a royalty or
ji.e an injunction. Attorney John L.
Boone, prominent as a patent lawyer, was
consulted and he informed the investiga
tors that Philip Hinkle of this City was
the owner of the pa.ent.
Hinkle was found, and, although aware
of the value of his machine, he parted
with his patent for a few hundred dollars.
He needed the money and Knew full well
that in his present financial condition it
would be useless for him to right for his
rights in the courts of law.
Last evening papers incorporating the
overweight counter balance elevator com
pany were placed on file. The company
was incorporated with $1,000,000 capital
Block and John L. Boone, H. L. Webber,
C. M. Weymann, Charles J. Armbruster
and C. Bennett as stockholder. Is ob
ject, the papers statf, is to manufacture
elevators for passenger and other pur-
poses.
"We will not manufacture elevators at
present," said Attorney J. L Boone yes
terday afternoon, "but we intend to lay a
royalty on every elevator that infringes on
our rights under this patent. We will lay
a royalty of half of the amount our con
trivance saves thf owners of the elevators.
This will not only include the future, but
we vi ill collect royalty for two year* back â
as far back as the statutes of limitation
will allow vs â and in case of a reiusai to
pay the royalty on the part of any ele
vator-owner we will bring suit ana enjoin
him from using our contrivance.
"There are 700 elevators in San Francisco
alone and tatting the elevators of the
United States into consuderati n. almost
half of which infringe on our patent, tbe
royalty we are entitled to will amount to
a ve,ry laree sum of money, just how large
it is impuss ble at the present to state."
The inventor of the contrivance, now
ever fourscore yearn of age, was glad to
hear that his invention would prove
profitable to its purchasi rs. His mfsfor
lunes of life have not made him envious
of the good luck and prosperity of others.

THE DEATH OF
WILLIAM HENNESSY
Full Investigation Made by
Sargeant Dono
van.
His Conclusion Is That It Was
Not a Case of Suicide,
but Murder.
Tne Two Men and Two Women Ar
resttd on Suspicion Stilt Detained
in the Tanks.
The police have been making an investi
gation into the death of Wnliam Hen
nessy in the St. David House, 715 Howard
street, early Wednesday morning, and
have come to the conclusion thai he was
murdered.
John RiJey, Thomas Shannon, Kittie
Shannon and Mamie McCaan, who were
arrested Wednesday night, have not yet
been charged, but are being detained in
the "taiiKs" pending the result of tbe
Coroner's inquest.
Sergeant James Donovan handed the
following report to Captain Lees last
night detailing the result ot his investiga
tion:
Hennessy was found in a small room of the
St. David House at 3:30 a. m. on the first floor
in the rear. He was bleeding and his body
was crouched up, with his overcoat on his !eit
arm and a pistol lyiug about eight inches back
ol his bead.
He had come from room 9 of said building,
and in this room were Tom and Kittle Shuii
non, Mamie Donnelly, Mamie McCaun, Jonn
Riiey aud the deceased. They had been drink
ing beer irom 8:30 in the evening until the
time of the shooting. Hennessy hud bought
four bottles of beer and at about 3:30 he went
out to the night clerk. Steve Ward, and
ordered two more bottles and stepped into
room 9 and told the people there that the
beer would be up in a few minute*.
Then he went back to the small room and
two minutes afterward the night clerk heard a
shot aud thougnt it was a door stumming. A
minute afterward the night clerk saw John
Riley come from the small room, Riley hoiler
isifj to the night cltrk that he Inn better go
b irk there; that there was going to be trouble.
The nu-ht clerk then went into the small
momnnd found a pistol, whicn I now have.
He took tbe pistol from the small room be
cause, he said, he thought there was some
thing wrong Hiid he did not want anyDody to
(jet n. He then went downstairs and blew a
whistle for an officer, and at the same time
handed Officer Koegel, who was downstairs,
the pistol.
A party by the name of Jack, the mate,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, FRIDAY, MARCH 12, 1897.
loaned a pistol to Rllev, but he cannot iden
tify the one 1 have. Ruey clams that when
lie went to the small room hennessy put a
pistol to his (Kiley's) sioinach and said: "No,
I won't; I will give it to myself," and then
snot himself. Riley and Hennessy had had a
row Tuesday over a woman, Mamie McCann,
in her room. Riley lives with the woman.
When I questioned Shannon he *aid that
Heunessy woke him up at 9 o'clock Tuesday
morning and asked lor his pistol, hiv' be wave
it to him. Mamie McCann Â»>a!d that Hennessy
was going to hither when Riley iiierfered,
and there were some words, which were con
tinued in the s.imc room. A brand-new pistol
was found between tne maitresses in Shan
non's room last night.
The reason why I believe it was a murder is
that when I tlr=.t inquired about it the night
elerfc did not seem to know anything about it;
that he worried about it and sent for me last,
night. When I questioned them they all told
me different stories. Riley said that he
wanted to give himself up; that he heard that
the night clerk had said he had killed Hen
nessy. When I questioned him about the
trouble be hod he refused to state until lie had
se>-n his lawyer. Hennessy was a shoemaker,
aii'i his tools were found in Shannon's room.
Three months ago Riley had a row with
some woman and fired gome shots and jumped
out of a second-story window to Minna street
when the officers came. Shannon is sup
ported by a \< oman.
April 10, 1887, Hennessy was sentenced to
one year lor burglary in the second degree,
and on Ju.'.c 18. 1832, to five years in San
Quentin for burglary, being discharged Janu
ary 18, 1896.

EASTERN RACING
FOR A CHANGE
A. B. Spreckels Will Not
Reconsider His Resig
nation.
New Ingleside Track 0 ficers
Will Be E'ected at a
Meeting To-Day.
Henry J Crocker S alel for the Olfice
ot Presidentâ General Regret at
the Turn of Affiirs.
The all-absorbing topic of conversation
among all classes of horsemen at the
Emeryville track yesterday was the resig
nation of A. B. Spreckels from the office
of president of the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club ana the consequent attendant
changes in the directorate. On ail sides
nothing but regret was expressed at the
sudden turn in affairs and many were in
clined to prophesy a gloomy future for
racing in this State. The dabblers in poli
tics were free in their intimations that it
was perhaps fortunate the change had
not occurred during the early days of the
Legislature.
Hope was expressed that influence
would be brought to bear and that Mr.
Spreckels would reconsider his purpose to
retire from the turf. These optimists are
hoping against hope, so it is stated on
good authority, for at the meeting of the
board of directors of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club to be held at the Palace
Hotel'this forenoon ,at 10 o'clock the presi
dent will aeain tender hLi resiirnat'on, and
it will be final. The millionaire horseman
has concluded to sever his connection
with the turf for good. This will, of
course, mean the retirement of Secretary
W. S. Leake, who quits turfdom to enter
the employ of John D. Spreckels & Bros.
Company.
There is much speculation as to the
new of&cers and directors of the Ingleside
Association. J. E. Tade, assistant secre
tary under Mr. Leake, was yesterday ten
dered the office of secretary, but alter due
consideration declined the honor. When
Mr. Leake is settled in his new position
room will most likely be found for Mr.
Tade, as he has been associated with that
gentleman in business affars for the past
ten years.
Henry J. Crocker, now vice-president,
is f-laled tor the office of president, and
will probably accept. Harry Kuhl.it is
said, will replace J. W. Wilson in the
judges' stand. The new directors are
mere matters of conjecture.
The whole upheaval in turf affairs, it is
said, can be attr bnted to the peculiar po
sition taken by Vice-president Crocker at
the meeting held on Wednesday. When
it came to a question as to whether East
ern or California management should pre
vail, Mr. Crocker, who had the deciding
vote, stood in with the Eastern clique, de
ciding tgainst Mr. Spreckels and the best
interests oi the local turf. Vice-president
Crocker was interested financially to a
very small amount in Ingleside stock,
making his stand all the more inexplic
able.
From the outset A. B. Spreckels has
been the mainstay and sinew of the (rack,
having invested at times as high as
?20U,C00, and now, at the very height of
me beautiful course's succesj, a faction
whose presence has sounded the death
knell to racing in more parts of the coun
try than one, attempts a game of "freeze
out." Why Mr. Crockir chose to shy his
castor with this side of the house time
only can demonstrate. Love for pomp
and" splendor has turned the brain of
many a mortal b?ing. The past has not
shown Mr. Crockt-r a racing magnate of
great executive ability, still he may prove
ttie man of thÂ« hour.
The morteag" for $73,000 held by A. B.
Spreckels on the Inglesiiie track was yes
terday taken up by Henry J. Crocker and
recorded in his name.
FOR WOMEN'S FREEDOM.
The National Recording Sec
retary of the W. C. T. U.
on Suffrage.
Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman Says it Is
Only Justice to AUcw Women
a Voice in the Gcv.rnment.
Mrs. Clara Hoffman, the National Re
has been delivering temperance lectures
throughout the Pacific Const, is a firm be
cording Secretary of the W. C. T. U., who
liever in women's suffrage. In an inter
view yesterday Mrs. Hoffman said:
It has always been a mistake to urge the en
franchisement of woman on the grounds of
what she might, would or could do along the
lines of moral reform, although this position
is easy to prove in every country whore she
has had a voice in the making and enforcing
of law.
The only argument that is needed for wo
man's enirmichisement is justice. For sev
eral hundred years the current has set
toward ireedom, for the people more
and more begiu to see, though dimly it
may be, that "all political powir iDheres in
the people." If woman belongs to the people
she must have her full shflre of political
power. Governmeiiis derive their iugt powers
from the consent of the governed. With what
consistency can any man or woman accept the
above principle ami yet deny to the woman the
ballot.
This inconsistency is foand often in pulpit
and pew, in mtm and court. On Indepen
dence day we flaunt oÂ»r banners and declare
tnat "taxation without representation is
tyranny," then proceed to tux every dollar
owned by women in all the land, at the same
time inviting every man who never owned a
dollar to help make and break our laws. This
is consistency indeed.
If all women were enfranchised to-day the
millennium would not be assured for to-mor
row, nor would it be reasonable to expect it.
From the beginning until now men and women
have been associated in the closest relations,
and, as Teunyson well says, in the influence
of one upon the other:
Yet in the long years liker muÂ«t they grow,
The man be more of woman, she otman;
he gain In sweetness and in moral height,
.Nor lose tbe wrestling thews tbat, throw the
world:
She in mental breadth, nor fail in chi'il ward care.
When a question of right and wrong is to be
decided what right has any one to parley with
it, forever placing U on the ground of expe
diency, forever debating what the lesult
may be ?
It is the duty of every man and woman to
choose that wiiich is just and decide for it,
though the heavens fah. Great solicitude it*
expressed about the giving of the ballot to bad
women; yet good women outnumber bad
women by the thousands, and bad men out
number bad women by tens of thousands.
We have upward of 60,000 convicts in the
penitentiaries of the United States; only a lit
tle more than 4000 are women. In all cities
the arrests of men outnumber women into
hundreds and thousands. This objection is
puerile.
Women should have a voice in government
becau.se she is governed, because she must
obey the government, and because equally
with man she hel| s to maintain the govern
ment The government is only the larger
home of the people.
The ideal home is one in which the power of
father and mother Is equal. So must it be
with government.
State Legislatures and city governments
| show the domination of the evil and base, and
there is no help and no remedy save In the
conservative power, t be moral in 11 Ã¼b nee and
political vote of women.

There are now twenty-two kind-hearted
wonien enrolled in the Ladies' Auxiliary
of the Cuban .League of this City, and they
are straining every nerve to make the
meeting of tiie league next Monday even
ing a success.
On that , occasion the Cuban flair, on
which they have been work will be
presented to the league. The; handsome
emblem was finished yesterday and many
friends of the auxiliary called to see t..e

dies had fashioned. The following com

Among the most recent offers of aid for
Cuba that have been : received at Cuban
League headquarters is that of a Seattle
electrician ana telegraph operator .;; who
wants to co to Cuba, and is willing to pay
his own passage iroiu San Fianci. co to a
point whence he can be taken to the
island. '
. He addressed bis letter to the Mayor,
under '.tie impression that Mr. Fhelan was
the chairman of the Cuban' sympathizers
of this City. v He writes as follows:
Seattle, Wash.. March 2, 1897.
Mayor Phelan, Chairman t Ã¼bmi Aid Movement,
San Francisco, Vol.â Drab s>ir: 1 note your
movements in behali oi the Cubans and I take
the liberty of addressing you. My sympathy
is heartily with this movement of yours and I
would like to assist in a substantial way. If
nn of your committee could secure a reason
able railroad rate from San Francisco to some
Eastern port â say Galveston â I would be will
ing to sti.n at once. As evidence of good faith
I am willing to deposit in your care the price
of one first-class ticket, San Francisco to Gal
veston. Am 23 years old, a first-class c ec.ri
cian and telegraph operator. Am also well
aware that it is not your duty fb encourage a
man to quit a good position and take such a
step.
The reason I suggest Galveston is that there
seems to be quite a number of cattlemen from
that State sinning irom there. Kindly let me
hear from you; or should yon not find the
time to give tnls attention, would you kindly
hand to your honorable secretary or some so
cletv interested in this matter? Enclose
stamped envelope for raoly. Yours very truly,
G. W. Johnson (enre Tremont Hotel).
Another sympathizer with the cause
proposes a novel way of aiding the pa
triots. His name is Adolph Rant and he
is a:> educated German. He proposes to
the league to no to Cuba with two com
panions-, whom he does not name, for hos
pital or iniluaiy duty, as may be deemed
most advisable.
He says tiiat be and his friends will give
lectures on Cuba in English, German and
other languages while on the journey,
and that the proceeds shall be devoted to
tbe cause. He invites tbe ieacue to send
a representative with them to collect the
receipts and see that they are properly
handled.
Sugar and Electricity.
A short time ago, while attending a
social gathering at Newburerh, I had occa
sion to ietire to a dark room, and was sur
prised to find that a very peculiar phe
nomenon occurs whenever a piece of com
mon candy is broken.
I had a wintergreen wafer in my hand
and broke it preparatory to eating it.
When the wafer snapped I noticed a bril
liant flasn marking the path of tbe break.
1 broke several more and found the same
effect occurred with each one. Since then
I have insulated tbe candy from my body
and tried again, with tbe tame result?,
thus proving that the flash is due to some
thing in the candy itself. It is not phos
phorescence, because it is an instantane
ous flash and not aglow. It is probably
due to a discharge of static electricity
from the snirar.
Should any one desire to try this experi
ment it would be well to remember that
the effect can be more readily perceived
in dry, clear weather than in damp or
stormy weather, as is the case with all ex
periments in static electricity.â New York

FROM THE BAY
The Old North Point Cove
Will Soon Be
Filled In.
Improvements Which Will Make
the North End Attractive
and Prosperous.
Streets Will Ec Extendedâ The
Wheels of Manufacturing
Will Hum.
The northern side of the City is not
ben. nd in the general march of improve
ments now nnder way in all parts of the
City.
The Van Ness Avenue Improvement
Club, which gave a great impetus to im
proving the northern section of the City,
through its progressive president. Herbert
Law, is now gratified to see the fulfillment
of its scheme.
The extension of Van Ness avenue from
Broadway to Bay street was the opening
wedge, ?o to speak, for a further and more
extensive line of improvement in that
direction.
This is now in a fair way of beine
realized by the extension of Montgomery
avenue from its present terminus at Bay
street, to Beach, a distance of two block-.
Work o.i this extension has already
begun, and now the little muddy cove
must give way for new-made territory.
This avenue, which meets Jones street at
that point, will be extended sufficiently to
furnish direct street travel from the com
mercial center of the City to the old
woolen-mills.
The Foniana Packinz Company, in
conjunction with Ghirarclelli & Co.'s
spice manufacturing establishment to be
located in the old woolen-mills, will bring
a revival of business to that po tion of the j
north end. With this improvement Yon
Ne>a avenue will be extended one block
farther north, thereby giving a through
opening trom all parts of the City to trie
water front and military station at Black
Point.
The assessment on the property caused
by the extension of Montuoniery avenue
was inadequate to meet the expense, as
there will be some deep filling to be done
as the work i'rogrts-es into deep water.
This will necessitate the dumping of large
bowlders to form a dem where the sand
will be placed. But to meet this de
ficiency the Van Ness Avenue Improve
ment Club, on the -uegestion of Us presi
dent, subscribed $2600 in one lump on the
shortest notice.
With the extension of Montgomery ave
nue and the proposed extension of the j
seawall west from Taylor street to Larkin
t c cove at the foot of Jonus ssreet wiil be
rilled in, gtvine several acres of new
ground to the owners upon which sub

Tact and Courtesy.
The wife of the Portuguese Minister to
Washington is one of the most beautiful
and charming women in the capital.
She has been only a iit'le while in this
country, and it was quite recently that
she paiJ her first visit to the White
Houte. When she was presÂ»nted to
Mrs. Cleveland she followed the European
fashion and courtesied to the President's
wife. Mrs Cleveland did not respond as
sue might have done; probably she was
taken by surprise. Certainly the Vis
countess de Santo Thyrso was surprised a
moment later to see mat other visitors
merely shook hands. Sne was flus
tered for a moment, for a lady
in the diplomatic circle hates above
all things to do anything not strictly
conventional. But she was not willing to
confess that she realized that she bad
made a mistake, so as she departed she
made the same low and graceful obeinance
that she had used when she arrived.
Washington talks of tl:is tactful lady in
increased admiration. â Leslie's Weekly.
