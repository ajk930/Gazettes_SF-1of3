( to receive the greetings of the reception
committee.
Half-a-dozen policemen marched ahead
ana on the flanks of the President-elect's
, large party as it proceeded down the plat
| form toward the ladies' entrance. Mr.
| and Mrs. McKinley were immediately
\ preceded by Barrett and Bell of the com
! mittee. Mrs. McKinley leaned on the
! arm of the President-elect.
Colonel Bartlett escorted Mrs. Nancy A.
McKinley, the President-elect's mother.
The procession proceeded very slowly and
with dignity. Major McKinley had one
hand thrust into the bosom cf ' his long
I frock cor.t, while in the other he carried a
iar.'e bunch of white carnations. Mrs.
McKinley, looking somewhat tired and
i carewcrn, also carried carnations. Doff
ing his silk hat pleasantly to everybody
I who saluted him, Major McKinley walked
I along toward the crowd outside tbe gates
! easerly awaiting _him. He bowed to the
train crew, the dining-car servant?, ; the
porters and the ot ers who were on the
ulatforra and at tbewitrdows cf ibis iXii.
V When tb.3 engine was reachea the pro-
I cession baited a moment while the Presi
dent-elect handed the engineer the carna
tions he had been carrying. This made
everybody in the vicinity look: happy, but
none looked so happy as , the - begrimed
; throttle-handler, who. fairly blushed
i through the soot on his face.
Another cheer from v/iihin told thÂ«
i crowd outside that their patience was to
| be rewardea' at last. â¢ They, too, yelled
when the well-known face of the Presi
j dent-elect appeared at the door of the
I ladies' waiting-room.
Tha task of getting the President-elect's
carriage st;iried away from the station
I "was the work of but a moment, and be
, fore the crowd knew it he was rapidly dis
i appearing up Pennsylvania avenue. With
j Major and Mr?. McKinley in their car
riage were Chairman .Bell and Secretary
Porter, while in the following vehicle sat

| Mrs. J. Adaison Porter and. Mrs. 0. C.

| of the larpa party that accompanied Major
| McKinley to Washington took other car
| riages. .
The ride up â  Pennsylvania avenue past
the reviewing stands and many other evi
j dences of the approaching inauguration
1 was an interesting feature. No mounted
j escort was there to tell that the President
i elect had arrived, but the crowds along
; the sidewalk recognized Major McKinley
j a.- his carriage proceeded unattended at a
j leisurely pace, and several times knots of
spectators set ud a cheer. At Fourteenth

Ebbitt, is the situation known as "News
paper row." A large number of news
paper correspondents were gathered in
front of their offices. Major McKinley
recognized a number of them whom he
had known during his Congressional resi
dence here and saluted them pleasantly.
Tbe gathering about the Eobiti was
larger than that at the station. The
streets were thronged with the greatest
assemblage about the ladies' door on
Fourteenth street, where a squad of
policemen gave the impression that the
President-elect's entrance would be there,
but the carrage comaining Major and
Mrs. McKinley drove around the corner
to the main door on F street. Cheer after
cheer went up from the crowd from the
time the President-eiect was sighted until
he disappeared inside the hotel.
Mr. Hanna was thore waiting for him.
The greeting* of the National Chairman
were brief but hearty. He hurried Mr.
and Mrs. McKinley through the lobby to
an elevator, and quicker than one can tell
the new President and his wife had disap
;c. :ed from pablK; view. Soon afier the
arrival at the Ebbitt House Major and
Mrs. McKinley were, figuratively speak
ing, snowed under by bits of white paste
board, but they received a few intimate
friends only.
General Russell A. Alger was among the
callers. Mrs. McKitilev was very much fa
tigued and retired to her room for a reat
in preparation for the dinner at the White
House at night.
Major McKinley, who had been some
what depressed yesterday over the pros
pects for good weather inauguration day.
on account of the disagreeable condkion
of affairs in Canton, became very cheerful
under the influence of the bright sunshine
and balmy atmosphere which greeted his
arrival here. This has been the most per
fect day Washington has had since winter
began. Veritable spring weather prevails
and there is every reason to hope that the
4th will be fitted in every respect for a suc
cessful ceremonial.

WASHINGTON. D. C, March 2.â The
President recovered from his rheumatic
attack this evening sufficiently to assist
Mrs. Cleveland in entertaining the Presi
dent-elect at dinner. This was purely an
informal domestic affair to which no others
were bidden, and at 7:30 o'clock the three
persons sat down to a beautiful repast in
the small private dining-room of the
executive mansion. The charming hospi
tality for which the Clevelands have been
noted was exemplified. The two men re
sumed an acquaintance terminated eight
years ago, when President Cleveland com
pleted bis first term of office.
Their conversation over the cigars in all
probability drifted over the wide range of
grave state affairs which one will not un
willingly relinquish to the other two days
hence.
Mrs. McKinley was feeling too fatigued
to attend.

Overcome by Rheumatism After Laboring
Eighteen Hour* a J>ay.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â President
Cleveland is confined to his b â¢ <i with an
acute attack of pe<lal rheumatism, under
orders from his physician not to arise un
til he is notably improved, as otherwise
be will not be able to participate in the
inaugural ceremonies of his successor.
The last regular Cabinet meeting was con
sequently held to-day without its chief,
and all visitors, however important,
failed tp reach him. Notwithstanding
the exceeding painfulness of the attack,
the prescription of absolute rest for a day
or two is confidently relied upon to put
the President upon his feet by Thursday.
The development of his old enemy just at
this time is attributed by his physician
solely tp his close, exhausting confine
ment in order to dispose of the executive
business which has accumulated during
the past week.
The President has not been exposed to
the bad weather for over a week, but on
the contrary has been constantly at his
desk an average of eighteen boars a day.
Three o'clock every night l ias invariably
found him studying legislation heaped
upon him in the final rush of Congress,

and every morning he has returned to the
task by an artificial light. Under the
circumstances, those around him feel
keenly the injustice of the story published
this morning that he had snubbed Gov
ernor Bushnell of Ohio oy excusing him
self from receiving the Governor and his
staff.
Secretary Thurber said: "Yesterday an
aid came to me and said the Governor
and his staff w mid like to pay their re
spects. I replied tliat the President would
be very glad to receive the Governor and
his staff as wi-fl. But would not he please
tell the Governor in conlldence, that the
President was suffering from a terrible
attack of rheumatism, tnat he could not
stand or see any one, and was, with ditti
culty, watching public business. 1 bejrged
him earnestly to convey the President's
regreis and say that his illness precluded
his seeing any one. That this was strictly
true is shown by the Prpsident's inability
to see his own Cabinet officers to-day."

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.â The
President-elect and Vice-President-elect
sleep in the National capital to-night.
Their temporary headquarters at the Eb
bitt and Arlington hotels respectively see
with hopeful anticipations thousands of
perspiring patriots. The streets resemble
the eve of a nominating convention.
All trains are bringing in crowds of peo
ple to attend the inauguration. No one
can teli whether the arriving train is the
limited express of yester.lay or the day
before. The streets are already thronged
with strangers. All theaters are crowded,
but the greatest show of all, the Capitol,
with both houses of Congress in night ses
sion aud no charge for admission, was the
chief attraction. The public galleries
were packed and the pubic corridors were
rendered almost impassable by people
waiting their turn lo take in the sights.
The weather nas 1 turned unexpectedly
warm, with a suspicion of rain in the air,
though nothing more serious than a few
showers is at present apprehended.

AMERICANS IN HAVANA EXCITED.
Fear an Attack by Spaniards on General
Lee and the Legation â Wey/er's
Recall Confirmed.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 3.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: The
American residents in Havana are ereatly
excited by the reports concerning the bit
ter feeling of the Spanish volunteers
aeainst General Lee and the United
States.
There is a fear that an attack will be
raude upon the legation, which is at pres
ent not protected against aggression from
the Spanish moD. Consui-Goneral Lee
preserves a dicmfied attitude, and quietly
attends to his office business.
He has no means of repelling an attack
and knows perfectly well that the ill
feeling of the Spanish masses against him
grows more and more threatening daily.
Tbe reU-as â  of Sfngniily and his safe ar
rival at Key West has caused great indig
nation among tbe Spaniards.
They cutunient upon the affair with
much bitterness, and say it is a disgrace
to Spain, and the Spaniards ought not to
tolerate it.
General Weyler is going to return to
Havana very soon. The report that he
has been recalled by the Spanish Govern
ment has been confirmed, but the fact has
not yet been officially announced.
The reason of his recall is not a disagree
ment between the Captain-General and tbe
central Government concerning the treat
ment of American citizens and the release
of Sangnilly, but the total military failure
of Weyler in the Santa Clara province and
the recent victories of Gomez over Colonel
Argona and Generals Gasco, Â£egura and
Ruiz.
The report of the disagreement between
Weyler and the Madrid Government above
referred to is only an excuse for conceal
ing tbe real facts of Weyler's disaster in
Santa Clara.
Woyler is greatly embittered against
the Americans and General Lee.
It is certain that, while remaining in
office until his successor arrives, it will be
only under pressure from Madrid that he
will try to protect the American Consul
from the consequences of Spanish ani
mosity.
EMBASSADOR BAYARD HONORED.
Given a Banquet by tho Lord Mayor ot
Londonâ Many Distinguished Men
Present.
LONDON, Exg., March 2.â The farewell
banquet civen by the Right Hon. George
Faudet-Phillip". Lord Mayor of London,
in honor of Embassarior Bayard, took
place to-night in the Egyptian Hall, the
principal part of the Mansion House, the
official residence of the Lord Mayor. Tne
occasion was the last but one of the public
appearance of Mr. Bayard in England.
Altogether over 350 guests were assem
bled. The Lord Mayor sat at the head of
the table with Mr. Bayard on bis right.
Letters of regret were read from Baron
Russell of Kiiloween, Lord Chief Justice
of England; from Dr. Nan^en, the Arctic
explorer, and the Spanish Embassador.
Among the more prominent guests
were: Prime Minister Salisbury ; Viscount
Cross, Lord Privy Seal; the Marquis of
Lanstlowne, Secretary of State 'for War;
Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of State
for India: Lord Balfour, Secretary for
Scotland; Lord Ashebourne; Right Hon.

Sir Clements Markham; the Aldermen of
the cky of London; Harold Frederic of
the New York Times; Lewis P. Moore of
the United Associated Presses; Consul-
General Collins, and Mr. Lathrop, United
States Consul at Bristol, and others.
There were scores of ladies in the gal
lery, the guests of the Laay Mayoress.
Mr. Bayard made a lengthy speech, the
only point of which was his statement
that he upheld Lord Salisbury's Cretan
policy.
After loving cups had been passed
around, toasts to the royal family and the
President of tho United States were re
sponded to, the Lord Mayor then toasted
Embassador Bayard, whom he greeted not
only as the distinguished representative
from the greatest Republic the world had
ever seen, but as a brother in blood who
had shown a lofty appreciation of English
institutions. He recognized in him an
eminent jurist, a polished diplomat, a
charming scholar and an accomplished
orator.
When Mr. Bayard rose to reply he was
vigorously cheered. He spoke with evi
dent emotion. He dwelt upon the repre
sentative unparlisnn nature of the assem
bly and said he did not receive the tribute
they offered him as a personal one. The
importance of the gathering lay in the
fact tnat hosts and guests alike stood for
the vast bodies of the people, each inter
ested in the other. He was unable to
voice what he felt. He believed he was
chosen four years ago by a patriotic exec
utive to portray what ought to be the
proper relations between the United States
and Great Britain. His best energies had
been put forth in the fulfillment of his
course. Mr. Bayard dwelt upon the
kindred peoples of Great Britain and the
United States as tne pioneers of human
advancement. He alluded to the vanished
glories of the Mediterranean nations,
which were formerly the countries of the
world's civilization, but which now pre
sented the ghosts thereof.
This object-lesson was never plainer
than at the present moment, when the
peace of Burope was in jeopardy through
lack of those vitalities of force and pur
poses forming the livine grandeur of his
country and that of his listeners.
[Cheers.]
He spoke of the presence of the illustri
ous statesman who had proven his power
and sensr> of proportion in his humane ac
tion in affairs. This reference to Lord
Salisbury was loudly cheered.

Five Important Points That
Mean Much to Los Angeles

CONVENIENCE CF APPROACH. A
TELLING FACT.
Residents of the Sou'hern California
Metrcpo is Promptly Ceb'brate

WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 2.â The
Deep-water Harbor Commission, Admiral
John G. Walker chairman, appointed' to
locate a deep-wat*r harbor in Southern
California, has submitted its report to. tha
Secretary of War. The board reported in
favor of San Pedro as the location for a
deep-water harbor to be used for commerce
and for refuge. The other place men
tioned, over which there has been -a long
drawn-out contesi, was Port Los Angelus
in Santa Monica Bay.
The â  commission reported In favor of
San Pedro for the following five rensons:
Convenience of construction of accessory
works, convenience of approach from the
sea, convenience of approach from tha
land, availability as $ harbor of refuge,
capacity of extension and enlargement.
The commission ri-cominends the. imme
diate construction of a harbor breakwater
of 8500 feet, to cost ove: $2,900,000.
. The decision of the commission was, ac
cording to the act establishing it, to be
final, and when the report was presented
it became the duty of the Secretary of
War to start improvements to cost riot
more than $2,900,000.
In making the selection the report says
the physical advantages of the San -Pedro
location naturally led to its selection,
and the advisability of that choice 13
materially strengthened by the considera
tion of the extensive improvement pf its
interior harbor, already made, condition
ally provided for or contemplated, as the
object of future appropriations. If the
choice of the deep-water harbor -site were
to fall to Port Los Angeles the present
statute would then authorize improve
ments at the San Pedro location to fho
amount of $392,000, and the same statute
unqualifiedly directs the Secretary of War,
at his discretion, to cause a survey and
estimates to be made lor further improve
ments at this location, so as to secure a
depth of twenty-five feet at low water in
the channel and interior harbor. There
fore it must be assumed that the improve
ment of tue channel and interior harbor
at San Pedro would be continued.
If the expenditure of.public money is to
be devoted to harbor purposes in that sec
tion, its division between the two points
considered will tail to secure that efficiency
id results which would be attained by tha
same total expenditure at one of the two
locations. It is the judgment that the best
policy in the interests of the country to"
maintain a deep-water harbor, for" com*
merce and for refuge, demands that the
concentration of expenditure atone point
with the corresponding cumulative excel- â 
lence of results, rather than the disposi
tion and weakening of results by divided
expenditure at the two locations.
This conclusion gains considerable farce
through the fact that a section of the San
Pedro harbor wilt involve materially less
ultimate appropriations.
The board intimates tha cost of the
breakwater at San Pedro harbor at ?2,
--901,787.
The commission appointed consisted
of John G. Walker, Rear-Admiral, U. S.
N. ; Augustus F. Rodgers, assistant U. Â§,
Coast Survey; Wiiliam H. Burr, Richard â 
P. Morgan and George S. Morrison. Ad
miral Walker was made chairman of tha
board.
The board crossed the continent to in
spect the two proposed harbors, and con
ducted a lous and thorough investigation
at Los Angeles, examining engineers, ma
riners and all wlio could throw light on
the subject. William Hood, cLief en--
gineer of the Southern Pacific, managed
the case for Santa Monica, and John F.
Francis acted in a similar capacity on the
other side.
X^Tbe deep interest taken by the Southern
Pacific was due to the fact that that com
pany owned the approaches to Santa
Monica and most of the land there avail
able for terminal purposes. The principal
witness for the Southern Pacific, X- L..
Carthejl, gave the following reasons why
Santa Monica or Port Los Angeles,- as the
railroad people prefer to call it, should, be
selected:

Morgan Flays Mr. Huntit glon, Whose
Claim Is Stricken Out of the
D ficiencv Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.âEx
ecutive business went on in the Senate to
day smoothly, and with very little dis
cussion. The tirat bill that was passed
was one for the prevention of the intro
duction and spread of contagious diseases
in the United States, tlie preamble to it
reciting the alarming and rapid spread of
the bubonic plague now prevalent in India
ami in adjacent countries. The fortifica
tion bill, appropriating $9,717,137, was
passed without a word of discussion ox
tept a short speech iorm Hawley (R.) of
Connecticut, criticizing the fact that the
fortifications, on whose efficient arming
some $3,000,000 had been spent, left them
practically without garrisons and there
are no men trained as artillerists to man
age the splendid sleel Runs provided by
the liberality of Congress.
The House amendments to the Senate
international monetary conference bill
was concurred in without a division, but
after several short speeches from Silver
Senators, Dubois of Idaho declared his
conviction that the only way to reach an
international agreament was for this Na
tion to staud out as in 1776 and declare its
intention to regulate its own affairs.
Speeches of a somewhat similar ten
dency were made by Senators Cannon of
Utah, Teller of Colorado. Mantle of Mon
tana, and Morgan of Alabama, the latter
stating that he would probably be the
only Senator who would vote against the
bill.
Senate joint resolution for the preven
tion of the introduction and spread of
contagious and infectious diseases into
the United States was passed.
Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania asked and
obtained permission to be personally re
lieved from the obligation of secrecy as to
the executive business of yesterday and
then be went on and complained that the
names of certain postmasters i". Pennsyl
vania were published in the Record and
newspapers as confirmed, when they were
in reality not confirmed, but laid on the
table.
Cameron (R.) of Pennsylvania offered
a resolution, which was agreed to caliing
on the State Department "for correspond
ence in the case of the United States Con
sul McCord of Pennsylvania, arrested in
Arequipa, Pern, in Jane, 1895. â¢
The House bill regulating fraternal
beneficiary societies, orders or associa
tions in the District of Columbia were
passed. â
* Hale (R.) of Maine, Quay (R ) of Penn
sylvania and Gorman (D. ) of Maryland
were appointed conferees on the naval ap
propriation bill, and Teller (Silver) of Col
orado, Allison (R.) of lowa and Cockrell
(D. ) of Missouri on the District of Colum
bia appropriation bill.
PeiTer (P.) of Kansas moved to take up
the resolution offered by him several
weeks ago instructing the Finance Com
mittee to inquire into the issue and sale
of bonds. After some diicussion the mat
ter went over without action.
Cuilom (R.) of Illinois gave notice that
he would move to take up the House anti
scalping bill at the first opportunity.
On motion of Platt (R.) of Conoecticut
it was ruled that after the passage of the
remaining appropriation bills â the fortifi
cations and deficiency bills â House bills
on the calendar unobjected to shall be
taken up.
The fortification bill was then taken up.
The amount appropriated in the bill as it
passed the House was $9,253,325; as rec
ommenced by the Senate Committee on
Appropriations the bii: carries $9,717,941.
It was passed without Question.
The general deficiency bill (the last of
the appropriation bills) was then taken
up. The bill Â«s it passed the House ap
propriated $8 442,027; as reported from the
Senate Committee on Appropriations It
carries $10,344,939.
The con;lderaiion of the deficiency bill
was interrupted and the House amend
ments to the international monetary con
ference bill was laid before the Senate at 1
r. m., when Chandler (R.) of New Hamp
shire moved that the Senate concur in the
House amendments.
Dubois (Silver) of Idaho argued that
the bill seemed to be a political proposi
tion and nothing else. He admitted that
nothing could ba done in an international
conference without the consent of Eng
land. He should vote for the bill and
hoped it would prevail, but he was con
vinced that the Republicans did not in
tend to and would not accomplish any
thing by tlie bilL It was "playing poli
tics," and nothine else.
Dubois read extracts from a letter re
ceived by him recently from Mr. Morton
Frewen of London, stating that the move
ment in England lor currency reform was
apparently hopeless and headless. Talk
ing of the silver agitator*. Dubois said
that they had left their Republican friends
for good.
"Do not," said he, addreesing the Re
publican side of the chamber, "lay the
flattering unction to yoursouls lhat they
will come back. Ten of your party will
come to us for one of us that will go
to you. so long as you adhere to the gold
.â -tandard. You will fool nobody by your
pretended international agreement. You
will fool nobody any more by planks in
your platform. The issue is nquarelv
joined and you must meet it squarely. 1
mean that you must declare for the free
coinage ot silver at a ratio of 16 to 1, and
when your tariff fails and prosperity does
not return then you will be brought face
to face with this question, and, in my
judgment, the result will crush you out
as a party."
Cannon (Silver) of Utah called for the
reading of the House amendment, which
provides for sending Republican envoys
to European capitals to se"ek for an inter
national agreement by diplomatic nego
tiation*, and when it was nad he de
clared that the adoption of that amend
ment would be an official admission of
Senator Wolcott's mission. If the Senate
bill waÂ«, as some peopie suggested, non
sense, it came back from the House
"costly nonsense." In conclusion be said
that the next administration would be, so
far as the money ques'ion was concerned,
the same as it Grover Cleveland had been
elerted for a third time.
Teller (Sil.) of Colorado sail the only
result of the bill would be to convince the
American people that bimetallism could
not be ob ained by inter national aeree
ment. It was folly to expect that Great
jiritan would change her attiiude on this
questionâ the attitude she has maintained
since 1816. He did not care to occupy the
time of the Senate in discussing the ques
tion now, but he would discuss it in the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 3, 1897.
next session. He did sot propose to let
tht question die, for it was the greatest
question the American p*ople ever had to
consider. In order to hold a successful
monetary confer nee there would have to
be diplomatic negotiations. A Repub
lican administration was coming into
power, and it was known who its Secre
tary of State and Secretary of the Treas
ury were to be. Th ir selection indicated
the policy of the administration. There
was no reason to suppose that tbe Secre
tary of State (Mr. Sherman) would enter
into arrangements for the purpose of re
storing bimetallism, nor was there any
reason to suppose that the Secretary of
the Treasury had any sympathy with any
international agreement. There was no
reason to suppose that tiie President-elect
hid any sympathy with it. No one could
lind an utterance of his after the camcaign
which indicated that he was frienly to it.
His statements from his cottage porch in
dicated that he had gone over to the gold
standard in earnest and would there re
main.
"We are about to Inaugurate a Presi
dent with the pomp and splendor of a
monarchy," Teller continued. "We are
told that there has been nothing in the
history of the country to compare with it.
There will doubtless be a grand and mag
nificent display. I do not complain. I
think that when the executive of 70,000,000
people is inducted into power anil office
theie should be somtthing more than the
ordinary conditions in observance, but it
will be painful to tiiose who witness it
and who realize that on that day there
will be more idle Americans hunting food
and hunting work than at any other time
in the history 01 this Kepublic; tiiat there
are more men, women and children sup
ported by charity to-day than at any
other time in the bistory of the country."
Morgan (D.) of Alabama said that as he
would oe perhaps the only Senator voting
against toe bill it was proper that he
should state his reasons for doing so. The
United States, he said, might as well sur
render its power to make war and peace
into the hands of Great Britain as to sur
render its power to coin money and de
clare its value.
Mantle (Sil.) of Montana declared hira
seif heartily in favor of every effort to
bring about an international a.reement
for international bimetallism, although
his honest conviction told him that it
would be iutile.
The vote was taken and the House
amendments were concurred in without a
division. The bill now goes to the Presi
dent for bis action.
Consideration of the deficiency bill was
resumed, and Vest (D.) of Missouri offered
an amendment directing the Secretary of
the Treasury to pay the amounts of the
decrees of the Court of Claims umier what
is known as the Bowman act. arid amount
ing in the aggregate to $587,900. Various
other items were added to the Vest amend*
ment.
Hale (P..) of Maine and Aldrich (R.) of
Rhone Island; spoiie against the amend
ment as at variance with the rule against
putting private claims on appropriation
bills. Hule warned Senators against load
ing down the bill, as the more heavily it
was loaded the more danger it would
encounter.
Other items were added to the Vest
amendment, including one of $"<1,250 to
John Paul Jones. The amendmer.t was
then agreed to without a division and the
rea imp of tbe bill was continued, the
committee amendments being acted upon
as the bill was read and all other amend*
roents being withneld until after the bill
should have been read through.
The committee amendments were all
disposed of by 5:30 p. m., ami then the bill
was open to the offering of amendments
by individual Senators. Among the
amendments offered and agreed to were:
Authorizing the leases of certain islands
in Alaska for propaeatine blue and silver
fpxes; to pay Henry Ick?rt of Omaha,
Nebr., $2900 for a certain building on Fort
Crook; to pay $34,850, found due on con
tracts for surveying public lands in Cali
fornia prior to June 30, 1890.
White (D.) of California moved to strike
out tbe House item appropriate $1,310,
--32" for ttie Southern Pacific Company un
der a judgment of the Court of Cluinis.
Cocfcrell (I).) of Missouri commented on
the fact that hitherto when the Senate"
had placed that item on an appropriation
bill the House had always fouent it stub
bornly aii'i defeated it,, while now the
House put in the item of its own accord,
"and it is believed," ha added, ''that the
change was caused by the enormous con
tribution of the President of the company
to the election fund."
Hale remonstrated against such charges.
j He did not believe there was any founda
i tion for them.
Without disposing of the bill the Senate
j at 6:10 proceeded to the consideration of
executive business and at 6:30 took a re
cess until 8 o'clock.
When the Senate resumed its session at
i 8 o'clock tho House bill imposing heavier
j penalties for mutilating coins was taken
i from the calendar and passed. It in
creases the penalty from two to five years'
imprisonment and makes unlawful the
attempt to pass, che Importation of and
I the possession of mutilated domestic and
foreign coins with intent to defraud, as
well as tho mere act of mutilation.
A partial agreement was agreed to on
the sundry civil bill and a further confer
ence asked on the amendments yet in dis
pute. The conference report on the In
dian appropriation bill was also presented,
and, after it waÂ« read, Carter (R.) of Mon
tana moved to disagree to the report. He
cave as his reason that it contained a
fraud, plain, palpable, bold, for which
language could not bo employed to make
it more dark and damnable.
The provision so severely characterized
was one in relation to certain mineral
lands ceded by the Blackfoot Indians in
Montana, whereby those white men who
had located upon the lands by the courtesy
of the agent prior to the cession should
hays their holdings legal zed. After some
debate the report was disagreed to and a
further conference ordered.
The consideration of the deficiency bill
was then .resumed, the pending amend
ment being to strike out the provision tb
pay the Southern Pacihc Railway $1,310,
--427.
Morgan (D.) of Alabama made a severe
arraignment of President Huntington of
the Southern Pacific Compauy. He said
that the commission to investigate the
Pacific railroads had unearthed many
frauds, and that Mr. Huntington, in his
sworn testimony, showed thÂ« truth of
these conclusions. He asserted that the
claim of $1,310,427, allowed by the Court
of Claim*, had been paid forty times over
in the obligations of C. P. HuutiiiKton
and the Central Pacific, which names
were both synonymous with the Southern
Pacific Railway.
After a long debate the amendment to
Strike out was adopted, providing that the
monÂ«-y be retained in the treasury until
fiie final adjustment of the debts of the
Pacinc railroads. Tho bill was then
passed, and at 12:25 the Senate adjourned
until to-morrow.

; WASHINGTON, D. C, : March 2.â The
assumption by the Senate of sole direc
tion and control of the inauguralexer
cises at the I Capi'ol was made the subject
of a resolution of inquiry offered by Dock
ery,:(D.);bfj Missouri immediately upon
the ; reassembling of the House at 10
o'clock this morning, in continuation ot
yesterday's session. ;, It asked the Com
mittee on Rules to investigate Vby what
authority the stand for the inaugural ex

being erected against the Senate wing and
accetsible \ only '[ from the : corridors, the
stand usually ' being erected in the center

part in the arrangement for and manage-;

quested. B|ksÃ^^' ; . -..'â¢â¢. '
A recess was taken until 10:30, when the
naval and District of Columbia aDpropri
atioQ bills were reported from the Senate.
The latter bill was referred to a commit
tee on conference.
Bouieile (R.) of Maine made a like re-
Quest with regard to the naval appropri
ation bill, and be made a statement of the
effect and scope of the principal Senate
amendments.
Hopkins (R.) of Illinois asked the House
to take a vote on the Senate amendment
fixing the price for armor plate for naval
vessels at $300 a ton and concur in it. He
said that the companies which are now
furnishing this armor desire to continue
to furnish it, but they should do so at a
reasonable price. He said that the Illinois
Steel Company was ready to contract for
armor at $240 a ton and it was competent
to carry out that contract.
To Dalzall of Pennsylvania Hopkins
said he knew bow long it took to build an
armor-plate plant and how much money it
took.
He called attention to the fact that
while the companies which furnished the
armor plate for the Kearsarge and Ala
bama charged the United States $520 a
ton they were selling the sans armor to
the Russian Government at $249 a ton, de
livered in St. Petersburg.
Cumraings (D.) of New York said that
if the Bethlehem Iron Company had fur
nished armor plate to Russia at $249 a ton
it was also true that now it was fumi-hlng
that Government the same armor at $527
per ton. The first contract was taken at a
loss to break into the European market.
To Dalzell Cuuiminas said that it
would not require three years to build
and establish an armor-prate plant, for
the Secretary in his report submitted the
proposition of an English firm to install a
plant in eighteen months.
The request of Bontelle was agreed to,
and Bouteile (K.) of Maine, Daizell (R.)
of Pennsylvania and Cummings (D.) of
New York were appointed conferee*.
Conferees on tbe District of Columbia
bill were appointed as follows: Grout (R.)
of Vermon!, Pitney (R.) of New Jersey
and Dockery (D.) of Missouri; and then,
at 11 :10, on motion of Dalzell, the House
adjourned nntil 12 o'clock.
When thÂ» House assembled for Tues
day's session Dalzell (R. ) ot Pennsylvania
obtained unanimous consent to address
the House for thirty minutes in reply to
the strictures passed on the official con
duct of Justice Shiras by McMillin (D.) of
Tennessee and De Armond" (D.) of Mis
souri during the consideration of the
sundry civil bill. Leave was also given
to the Democratic side to respond for the
period of thirty minutes.
Dalzell said that a great injustice had
been done Justice Shiras. The charge of
unexplained and damaging change of
opinion had been ramie not only on the
floor of this House, but in Democratic and
Popuiistic papers and on every stump in
the campaign last year. Showing the
record which he had made, Dalzell in
vited the gentlemen who had made tue
charge to an open and manly retraction.
If they did not accept his invitation, he
warned them that a rearh'rniation of the
charge was not satisfactory to the Amer
ican people. He loved justice and fair
play and would not accept an unfounded
assault uron the most august judicial
tribunal in the world, nor condemn an in
dividual member of that court who rose
to I: is high place because of his merit, and
who for more than three score years had
borne the white flower of blameless life.
Daizell was heard with preat interest
nnd deep attention, and at the close the
Republicans greeted him with loud ap
plause.
McMillin rose to reply and the interest
and attention continued. He reaffirmed
the charge that Justice Shiras had cbangcd
his mind, and referred to Daizell as the
mouthpiece of the Justice.' McMillen said
that if any person, court or power at
tempted by any means to tear down the
constitution he should stand unmoved,
even by the eloquence of the gentleman
from. Pennsylvania, and hold np the con
stitution as the supreme law of the land
an<i ever to be preserved. [Applause.]
De Armo!\d follo^d, speaking alone;
the samelinea he followed in hi? original
remarks upon the action of Justice Sniras.
Aldrich (R.) of Illinois endeavored to
get up the bill prohibiting the transmis
sion through the mails of illustrated and
elaborate accounts of prize-fights, but
Dockery (D.) of Missouri moved to take a
recess until 3:30 o'clock, which prevailed
by a vote of 72 to 33.
- When the House reconvened -at 3:30
o'clock the Senate amendments to the
fortincatiens bill were non-concurred in
and a conference asked.
Sherman (R.) of New York moved to
suspend the rules and pass the House bill
autbprizing the Secretary of the Treasury,
whenever a State defaults in the payment
of th j interest due on Indian trust funds,
instead of instituting an uction acainst
tne State to recover the money, to sell the
bonds and compromise the claim against
the State. â -.-;â  i --â .; r-^f^^Q-:-,>-!^-j.-^'> =:i-}~:
After considerable debate and various
futile efforts to amend the bill, the House
refusedâ 43 to 88â to suspend the rules
and pass the bill, and then, at 4:10, took a
recess untill 7:30 o-nigbt.

ent now. This was agreed to.
After a further recess of an hour a par*
tial conference report on the sundry civil
bill was presented and agreed to. The
House voted to insist upon Its disagree
ment to the remaining Senate amend
ments.
All Senate public buildings amendments
were concurred in except in the case of
Topeka, Kansas, where the amount was
reduced from $100,000 to $35,000.
The amendment to pay snear bounty

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.âPres
ident Cleveland, in his message vetoing;
the immigration bill, calls attention to the
first section of that measure, excluding
from admission to the United Slates il
iiteiate persons designated in the section,
and declares that the provision presents a
radical departure from onr National pol
icy relating to immigration.
"Heretolore," he Bays, "we have wel
comed all who have come to us from other
lands except those whose moral or physi
cal condition or history threatened dan
ger to our National welfare and safety.
Relying upon the jealous watchfulness of
our people to prevent injury to our polit
ical and social fabric, we have encouraged
those coming from foreign countries to
cast their lot with us and join in the de
velopment of our vast domain, securing,
in return, a share in the blessing of
American citizenship. A century's stu
pendous growth, largely due to the as
similation and turift of millions of sturdy
and patriotic adopted citizens, attests the
success of this generous and free-handed
policy, which, while guarding the people's
interests, exactt from our immigrants
only physical and moral soundness and a
willingness and ability to work.
â¢â¢A contemplation of the grand results
of this policy," he writes, "cannot fail
to arouse a sentiment in its defense."
Referring to the claims that the quality
of recent immigration is undesirable,
President Cleveland says the time is quite
within recent memory when the same
thing was said of immigrants who, with
their descendants, are now numbered
among our best citizens. It is said too
many immigrants settle in our cities, thus
dangerously increasing their idle and
vicious population. This is surely a dis
advantage. It cannot be shown, however,
that it affects all our cities, nor that it is
permanent; nor does it appear that this
condition, where it exists, demands aa its
remedy the reversal of our present immi
gration policy. The claim is also made
that the influx of foreign laborers deprives
of the opportunity ol work those that are
better entitled than they to the privilege
of earning their livelihood by daily toil.
An unfortunate condition is certainly pre
sented when people who are willing to
labor are unemployed. But so lar us this
condition now exists among our people, it
must be conceded to be a result of the
phenomenal business depression and
stagnation of all business enterprises in
which labor is a factor. With the advent
of settled and wholesome financial and
economic government policies, and a con
sequent activity of capital, tho mis
fortunes of Unemployed labor should, to a
great extent, at least, be remedied.
"If it continues its natural consequences
must be to check the further immigration
to our cities of foreign laboiers and to de
pieta the ranks of those already there. In
the meantime those most willing and best
entitled ought to be able to secure the ad
vantage of such work as th re is to do."
Tbe educational test contained in the
bill receives close attention. On this par
ticular point Mr. Cleveland says:
"In my opinion it is infinitely more safe
to admit 103,000 immigrants, who, though
unable to read and write, seek among us
only a nome and an opportunity to woric,
than to admit one of those unruly agi
tors and enemies of governmental control
who can not only read and write, but de
lights in arousing by inflammatory speech
tiie illiterate and peacefully inclined to
discontent and tumult, yiolence and dis
order do noi originate with illiterate la
borers. They are rather the vic'ims of
the educated agitators. The ability to
read and write, as required in this bill, in
and of itself, affords, in my opinion, a
misleading tes: of contented industry and
supplies unsatisfactory evidence of de
sirable citizenship or a proper apprecia
tion of tbe benents of our institutions.
The provisions intended to rtd that part
of tbe proposed legislation already re
ferred to from obvious hardship appears
to me to be indefinite and inadequate.
"A parent, grandparent, wife or minor
child or a qualified immigrant, though
unable to read and write, may accompany
the immigrant or be sent for to join his
family, providing the immigrant is capa
ble of supportiug such relative. These
exceptions to the general ruies of exclu
sion contained in the bill were made to
prevent the separation of families, and yet
heithor brothers rior sisters are provided
for. In order that relatives who are pro
vided for may be reunited those still in
foreign lands must bo sent for to join the
immigrant here. What formality is
necessary to constitute this prerequisite
and bow are the facts of relationship and
thut the relative is sent for to be estab
lished? Are the illiterate relatives of im
migrants who have come here under prior
laws entitled to the advantage of these ex
ceptions? A husband who can read and
write and who determines to abandon bis
illiterate v;iie abroad will find here under
this law an absolute, direct and safe
method. The relatives mentioned must
not only be sent for, but such immigrant
must be capable of supporting them when
j tln-y arrive. This requirement proceeds
I upon the assumption that the foreign re
lations coming here nre in every case by
reason of poverty li;tb c to become a pub
lic charge unless the immlrrani is capable
of their support. The contrary is very
often true. And yet, if unable to read
and write, though quits able and willing
to support t.hem.-eives and their relatives
here b-sides, they could not be admitted
under the provisions of this bill it the im
migrant was impoverished, though the
aid of his fortunate but illiterate brother
miciu be tin? means of saving him from
pauperism."
Further on the President remarks:
"Prohibition against Â«tbe employment of
aliens upon any public works of the
United states is in line with other legisla
tion of a like character. It is quite a
different thing, however, to declare it a
crime for an alien to come regulbrly and
habitually into the United States for the
purpose of obtaining work from private
parties if such alien returns from time to
time to a foreign country and to consti
tute any employment of such alien a crim
inal offense. When we consider these
paovisions of the bill in connection with
our lon X northern frontier and the boun
claries of several of our States and Tern
lories, ofien but an imaemary line separ
at ng them from the British domains and
recalling the friendly intercourse between
the people who are neighbors on ci her
side, the provisions of the bill affeci ing
them muft be regarded as illiberal, nar
row and un-Aiueric;in.
"The residents of these States and Jer
ritories have separate and especial inter
ests which in many cases make an inter
change of labor between their people and
their alien neighbors most important, fre
quently with the advantage largely in
favor of our citizens. Tins suggests the
inexpediency of Federal experience with
those conditions when not necessary to
the correction of a substantial evil affect
ing the general welfare. Such unfriendly
legislation as is proposed could hardly
fail to provoke retaliatory measures to thÂ«
injury of many of our citizens who now
find employment on adjoining foreign
BOll."
In conclusion he says: "A careful ex
amination of this bill has convinced me
that for the reasons given and others not
specifically stated, its provisions are un
necessarily harsh and oppressive and that
its defects in construction would cause
vexation and its operation would result in
harm to our citizens."

QUEEN OLGA OF GREECE.
Queen Olga ia the, most popular Queen in ail Europe, and after her plucKy act the
other day in' defying the Russian throne there is not a native of Hellas who would not
die for her. Queen Olga is a Russian Princess and was an honorary admiral in the
Russian tieei. She has just returned her insignia to St. Petersburg, with the remark
that she cannot hold rank in a fleet tftat has fired upon the Greeks. Olga is the eldest
daughter of the Grand Duke Constantino of Russia and a niece to the late Czar
A'exander 11. She is tall and stately nnd rea'izes the traditional idea of a Queen in
V her appearance and manner. She is a b)ond9, with brown hair, reguar features and
I a beautiful neck-.alid shoulders. She goe3 about Athens unattended, even by a maid,
aqd arc MM in the most.simple fashion. On ->tate occasions she costumes herself roy
ally. She is very fond of pearls, and has a small fortune in these ornaments. She is
most popular among the Athenian ladies and has a wide circle of acquaintances
â¢ amongtbem. Like dll the rest of this singularly democratic royal family the Queen
: nevr deports herself in the manner assumed by royalty in general, and while digni
fied is.gentle, affableand lovable. Olga is a great scholar. She loves science and the
1 classics, and can speak fluently in Russian, Italian, Greek, French, German and
: English. Lately she has mastered. Albanian also. She is interested in music and art,
; devotes much of her time to charity and public education, and has founded one or

have applied to the Greek Vice-Cousul to
save their compatriots from massacre.
The Consul has promised to do this, pro
viding the Foreign Minister will supply
the transportation necessary to get tbe
Moslems to Selino, and Ernin Pasha, the
Governor, will nive a written order to the
Turks to leave Kandamo under a guard of
safety given by the Greeks. It is reported
by the Governor of Selino that a massacre
at Kandamo is imminent. The place is
within two hours from the sea and diffi
cult of access, owing to the mountainous
country.
ihe conference between the Consuls and
admirals was held to-day, at which the
decision was reached to send officers to
Selino and Hilapetra to rescue the be
leaguered Moslems. It was also decided
to place Selino and Kandamo under the
protection of the powers.
ATHENS, Greece, March 2.â Tne Greek
Vice-Consul at Canea reports that the
Mussulmans there are threatening to pro
claim the union of Crete with Greece and
to murder the beys because of the ob
stacles which the latter have placed in
the way of their efforts to induce the Greek
Consul to save the women and children.
The foreign Consuls have demanded
that warships be sent from Suda Bay to
Selino at once.
Advices received here from Canea 3ay
that the foreign admirals demanded that
the Greek warships leave Cretan waters
within twenty-four hours. To this rte
mnnd Commodore Reinick, commanding
the Greek warships, replied that he would
only obey tbe orders of his own Govern
ment. If his ship were slink, he declared,
she would salute the foreign flags as she
went down.
The Government is informed that the
garrison of the town of Kandamos, on the
island of Crete, has ben captured by the
insurgents. It comprised 1200 Turkish
soldiers.
At the conclusion of his speech in the

Ilith Salisbury.
LONDON, Exc, March 2.â ln the Hou?e
j of Commons to-day George N. Curzon, the
! Under Foreign Secretary, read telegrams
\ received from the British Consul at Canea
saying that the Mussulmans in the island
of Crete had declared that they would not
consent to a union oi Crete wiih Greece,
and placed high hopes in the action of the
great powers to prevent it. The admiral
commanding the British warships in
Cre:au waters, Curzon said, wired that the
flans which are hoisted at Selino, Kandamo
I a;id Ekntons show that those towns are
; under the protection of the pow?rs. The
; Moslems at t.iose places, however, are in
gieat danger of beina massacred. Tne
dispatch added that a report was in circu
| lation that Christians were exterminating
I Moslems wherever they went.
Sir "William- Harcourt raised a debate on
the statement made by Lord Salisbury in
1 the House of Lords on February 25 declar
] ing tne policy which the Government in
! teiided to pursue in reuard to Crete, in
volving the autonomy of that island and
the withdrawal of the Turkish and Greek
! naval and military forces, and threatening
to impose force in the event of the refusal
of Greece or lurkey to withdraw their
farces when requested to do so. He began
by a.-kiiig whether the powers had as
sented to the proposals, and Power, pur
suing the subject, inquired how far it was
believed tnat the autonomy of the island
would rid the island of TurKishJrule.which
was the cause oi tne present evil.
Curzon said that the powers would not
allow Crete to be taken out of their hands,
as the arrival of the Greek forces upon rhe
island had excited the Christians and in
furiated tho Moslems.
In the House of Lords to-day the Earl
of Kimberly ra^ed a debate upon the sub
ject of Lord Salisbury's statement of Feb
ruary 25 by asking questions similar to
those asfced by Sir William Harcourt in
the House of Commons, adding that in
his opinion it would have been wiser to
have joined Crete with Greece than to
have given the island an autonomous ad
ministration.
After remarks on the subject by other
Peer 3 the House adjourned.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 3, 1897.
NOT YET READY
TO GIVE EVIDENCE
Examiner Men Want Time
to Prepare to Meet
Their Lies.
Their Promise of Preparing to
Sibjtantiate the Bribery
Story Is a Bluff.
So tbe Investigating Committee Grants
a Continuance Until Thurs
day Afternoon.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 2.â When
the Assembly committee met this after
noon it found that the Examiner was not
yet ready to substantiate the charge of
bribery made by it against members of the
Assembly who had voted to pass Cami
netti's bill (No. 273). Garrett McEnerney
appeared as its counsel and asked for a
continuance until next Thursday.
"Blinker" Murphy stated the alleged
reasons why tne continuance was desired
by the managing editor of the paper. It
was in the nature of a bluff, for th*t is the
only way in which a fake can be sup
ported, and Mr. Murphy played the bluff
with a steadiness of nerve and a gravity of
countenance that would do credit to a star
actor. Murphy said that the manager of
the paper had wired him last night to the
effect, that he could not attend before
Thursday, because he was at present en
gaged in gathering "further evidence."
It appeared, although Murpby did not
say so, that the libel was printed before
the evidence necessary to substantiate it
had been gathered â a familiar habit of
papers of tbe class of the Examiner.which
print everything before examining any
thing. It is necessary, of course, that
"Mr. Green" shoul i have some evidence
in the shape of a hole to crawl out of, and
if he cannot rind it in San Francisco, lie
will be obliged to have it forged in some
literary blacksmith-shop somewhere else.
It was staled by Murphy that Mr. Lev
ings, one of the Examiner's legislative
staff, had shaken the rich loam of Sacra
mento off his feet, and had gone to San
Francisco to consult Long Green as to
what is best to be done in the present
emergency.
Mr. McEnerney remarked that he un
deratoo.l that the managing editor was

to-day that his vote uid not imply that he

had already been passed and be merely
voted to amend the title. On the final

Subpmaa I**wd for Long Green /.uw-
r'nen and Hi* Fakers.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 2.â Long
Green Lawrence will be placed 0.. the
grill next Thursday by the committees of
the Senate and the Assembly, and will be
given the opportunity of describing in de
tail to the members thereof how fake
stories are manufactured in the inner
sanctum of a ''new" journal, though it is
feared that he will balk at confessing to
the motives that inspire them.
Snbpenas were issued to-day by the Sen
ate Bribery Investigating Committee to be
served on Managing Faker Lawrence of
the Examiner, the representatives of that
journal at the Capitol and the managers
respectively of the Western Union and
Postal Telegraph companies. The aub
penas read as follows:
You are hereby directed and commanded to
be and appeur before the Senate committee
appointed by resolution of the Senate of the
State of California 01. Monday, the Ist day of
March. 1897, and which committee was ap
pointed and directed to investigate into the
chnrges mnde by toe San Francisco Examiner
in its Issue of February 27, 1897, re
garding the bribery of members of the
Senate in relation to Assembly bill 273,
on Thursday, the 4th dny of March, 1897, at 4
o'clock p. m., in room IV of the Capitol build
inp, at Sacramento, for the purpose of giving
testimony in the matter of the investigation
above referred to, and concerning, relating to
and affecting the contents of tnat certain
Brticle pri'ite'l and published on the 27th day
of February. 1897, in the San Francisco Daily
Examiner, a aai y newspaper printed and pub
lished in the City and County of San Fran
cisco, State of California, and which said
article was, and Is headed, ''Bribery in
Aid of Tnievery." And you are aso di
rected and required to bring and have with
you at said lime and place, and to present to
the said committee any and all written or
printed paper or papers, or data, or memo
randa, or telegraphic dispatch or dispatches
received by you, or in your possession, or un
der your control, bearing upon the subject
matter contained In said newspaper article.
Witness mv hand, as chairman of said com
mittee, at Sacramento, this 2d day of March,
1897. J. H. Dickinson, Chairman.
This document is known as a subpena
duces tecura and requires not only the
presence of the witness, but commands
him, at the risk of being in contempt, to
bru g with him every document, book and
paper that has any bearing on the issue to
be hearJ. The managers of the telegraph
companies will be asked to produce all
telegrams sent to or by the Examiner re
lating to the bribery charges made by that
paper, and this evidence, it is anticipated,
will disclose some very unexpected de
velopments.
While the faking journal still assumes
to believe that ilih investigation is for the
purpose of probing for the bribed and
bribers it is well understood that its out
come will be to expose the brazen and
shameles-i imposition practiced on the
public by the Examiner in publishing un
lounded and indiscriminate charges of
bribery and corruption a ainst the mem
bers of both branches of the Legislature.
Budd I'etoet Boyce'* Bill.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 2â Gov
ernor Budd recorded bis fourth veto to
day. The bill that failed to meet with his
approval is Senate bill 28, introduced by
Senator Boyce, which provided for the
"employment of a specialist in socialo -ical
education." The Governor's reasons for
refusing to sign the measure are, in brief,
that it violates that provision of the State
constitution which prohibits local or
special legislation.
"The bill presents an attrcctive idea
and suggests possibilities as limitless as
inhere in organized society," says the
Governor, "and had the question been
presented to me in legal form I hesitate to
say what inigut have been my disposition
of it."

The Earl Fruit Company at
Sacramento Robbed by
an Employe.
Confidential Bookkeeper Rue
Placed Under Anest for
Embezzlement.
Said to Have Stolen Thousands to
Defray His Expenses as a
Leader in Society.
SACRAMENTO; Cal., March 2.-J. O.
Rue, who for the past three years has held
the position of confidential bookkeeper for
the Earl Fruit Company in this city, has
been arrested on a cnarge of embezzle
ment, preferred by George B. Katzen
stein, manager. The sums of which he
has defrauded the company have prob
ably amounted to thousands of dollars;
in fact, it is claimed that he has admitted
having taken $3000. At the present time
it is impossible to ascertain the full
amount of his peculations.
It Is claimed that the company dos
ses3ei proofs of Hue's embezzlements for
some time, but has refrained from taking
steps toward his punishment, because of
bis high connections and on account of
his family. He is related, it is said, to the
McDonalds of San Francisco. But within
the past weefcs Rue has been an active
agent in promulgating a company known
as the Blue Canycn Water Company, and
as many of the most intimate friends of
the manager of the Earl Fruit Company
were induced to invest heavily in the
stock of the concern, Rue to have the
management of these funds, it was deemed
advwibie to piace him under arrest
Rue during his residence in this city
has been respected by all of his associates.
His being a "jolly good fellow" led to his
downfall.
The fact that he had been guilty of em
bezzling the funds of the company in order
to hold his social position was discovered,
it is claimed, through certain claims made
by private shippers against the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, through the
agency of the Earl Fruit Company, for
damages sustained to fruit en route to
marke'. Tnese persons made a demand
on the Earl Fruit Company for their
money, having previously ascertained that
the claims had been liquidated by the
Southern Pacific Company, and investiga
tions brought to light the fact that Rue
bad used the funds to his personal benefit.
The arrest of Rue was kept secret, and
the newi of his disgrace will be a shock to
his acquaintances in Sacramento.
OREGON'S LEGISLATIVE FARCE.
Sergeanis-at-Arms Sent to Summon Mem

PORTLAND, Ob.. March 2.âSerseants
ai-Arms Irving and Sturgill, who are in
this city attempting to compel members
of the House to attend the Legislature at
Salem, are under arrest, charged with as
sault and battery, preferred by Represent
ative Jennings. This is declared to be an
other move by Senator Mitchell's friends
and the Southern Pac fie lobby to prevent
the election of a Senator.
SALEM, Or., March 2.â The jjavis tem
porary House, which has been meeting reg
ularly from day to day since the Benson
House adjourned, but without a Quorum
to organize permanently, decided yester
day on taKing a determined stand in order
tobriSff the runaways to time and force
their attendance. Chief Justice Moore
appeared in the House and swore all the
Davis faction in. Then they passed a
resolution authorizing their Speaker to
appoint seven assistant sergeants-at-arms
to bring in by force, if necessary, all the
Benson-Mitchell men who had gone
home. They started off on their mission
yesterday afternoon. Warrants were is
sued for a few only, as it is supposed
enough would come in to make up the
necessary quorum when they see the
stand that has been taken. If they or
ganize they will pass an appropriation
bill and remedial legislation, nrid may
also elect a United States Senator, but it
will not be Mitchell.
The House was called to order at 3:30
o'clock by Speaker Davis. . There were
present twenty-eight. Reports brought to
tho House showed that recalcitrant mem
bers refused to obey the demands of the
sergeants-at-arms and will fight them. A
resolution was passed authorizing the
Speaker to appoint additional serg^ants
at-arms â an army if necessary. The House
adjourned until to-morrow, when war
will actually begin.
IN JAIL AT SELMA.
Mr. and Mrs. Myers, Who Abandoned
Their Baby, Unable to Supply
Bonds.
FRESNO, Cal., March 2.â A. 11. Myers
ana wife, who were arrested laÃt night,
were taken to Selma to-day and arraigned
on a charge of having abandoned their in
fant child on the doorstep of Rev. J.
Baugh's residence in that town about two
weeks aco. Justice Tucker placed them
under $2000 bail each pending the pre
liminary examination. The prisoners
have as yet been unable to supply bonds.
Because of the popularity of Mr. and
Mrs. Myers and their hiiberto cood repu
tation, their arrest has caused much dis
cussion. Mr. Myer3 has teen an engineer
on the Southern Pacific Railroad in this
valley for many years and is widely
known. The two attending physicians
and the nurse will testify that Mrs. Myers
gave birth to a child aboui three months
ago aim has not nad the babe since the
time the attempt was made to dispose
of it.
The purpose of Mr. and Mrs. Myers in
trying to get rid of their child was to
avoid the disgrace resulting from a post
poned marriage. They were wedded oniy
a few months ago. Fresno is the end of
the railroad division and Mvers had been
making his home here. In the hope ot
saving themselves from disgrace he and
his wife went to Selma, fifteen miles
south of here, to live temporarily, as no
one knew them there.
The prisoners are in a very awkward
position and the authorities are deter
mined to prosecute them for their foolish
ness.

COBBETT'S WIFE AND SISTER
ARRIVE.
The Champion Takes a Holiday in
Their Honorâ Fitzsimmons'
Programme.
CARSON, Nev., March 2.â Dan Stuart,
the promoter of the approaching big box
ing carnival, thought he saw danger in
the much-talked-of project to introduce a
bill in the Nevada Legislature appro
priating money for the purchase of a
world's championship belt for the winner
of the Corbett-Fitzsinimons battle, and at
his special request Assemblyman Demp
sey did not present the measure this
morning, as was his intention. Stuart
was afraid that the criticism which would
emanate. lrom all parts of the country, if
the .State should follow up its action legal
ising boxing by presenting ' one of the
ruhters with an official belt, might bring
about a revulsion of public opinion among
the Xevadan? against the .â port as a whole
and possibly kill the game; so this morn
ing he sent for his trusted lieutenant, Al
Livingston, and asked him tv at once
hurry to the Capitol and talk Dempsey
out of presenting the measure.
Livingston lost no time and soon had
the genial Assemblyman out in trie cor
ridor, where he laid down the law to him.
He explained that Stuart's judgment was
that the Nevada Legislature had already
done enough for tbe sporting fraternity
and. that it would be dangerous to tres
pass farther. The re3t of the world would
soon begin, to chirp that the prize-tight
promoters and gamblers had completely
captured the State.
Dempsey saw the point and acquiesced,
so that puts an end to the Nevada trophy
proposition. Livingston did not get bold
of the statement any too soon, though,
for Dempsey bad the bill all drawn and
ready in his pocket, and was only waiting
for tne proper. time to arrive to introduce
the measure.
Considerable fun is being poked at
Dempsey to-night because of his retreat
on the belt proposition, and in self-de
fense he is- explaining now that he only
intended to introduce, the bill as a joke.
One of the events here to-day was the
arrival of Mrs. James J. Corbett, wife of
the California giant who expects to be
the cuampion of all champions after the
7th of March. She orrived on the morn
-. lhg train, which connects at Reno for San
Francisco. Jim drove, in from Shaws
Springs bright and early, and, aiong with
Billy Brady and Eddie. Cooke, took up a
position in the depot platform and waited
impatiently, for the arrival of tne little
jerC water train. AY hen the cars hove
into view a handkerchief was seen flutter
ing from one of the windows, and in ah
instant CorbeCt's eye caught it.
"There srue is, " shouted the big fighter,
waving his hand and laughing like a
schoolboy. â¢â¢
Mrs. Corbett's pretty face and trim form
was next seen on the platform, and behind
her came tripping Jim'a sister Esther.
"Hello, there,." was . Corbett's greeting.
"Hello, Jimmy," was the happy reply,
and there was. a hug and smack or two
that elicited a chorus of "Ohs" and
"Abe" from the big crowd of people that
. bad gone down especially to see the cham
pion and his wife. The ladies were
Ladies Are Now Admitted to See Corbett Train and Many Take Advantage o r the P:i/ileÂ£C>
whisked into a carriage, which was in
waiting, ttie champion hopped in after
them and then they were off for the
springs.
Corbett laid off from his training and
took a vacation to-day in honor of the ar
rival of his wife and sister." He spent the
forenoon in entertaining them, showing
them around the training quarters and
introducing them to dozens cf friends
who called at the springs to see him. In
the afternoon he put on his exercising
clothe?, and punched the bad for a while,
and then played a few games of handball,
but did no boring or wrestling. . Tnis
suited the trainers, for it gave them really
the first rest that they have been given
since they arrived in Nevada, and nobody
knows better than they that needed one.
Mrs. and Miss Corbett Trill probably start
bacs for San Francisco to-morrow even
ing, and will not see tlie champion again
until after the fi<rht, about which the
whole world is talking. Alter iheir de
parture the task of hardening the big fel
low for the battle will be resumed in
earnest.
Fitzsimmons did his usual morning's
routine of bag-punching, working the
wrist-machine, boxing and wrestling, and
topped it off by chopping up a pile of
wood. Bob considers woodchopping great
exercise, but then, you know, he doesn't
have to do it for a living. He claims that
he ca:; turn out more kindling than any
body else within a given time, and says
he will be open to challenges of this char
acter after he has wnipped Corbett, thus
leaving no more pugilistic worlds for him
to conquer. After his exercise at the
ranch Fitzsimmons took his usual trudge
through the mud and snow into town to
get his mail and attend to little shopping
details. He went to the telegraph office
and there found a message waiting for
him, which, when he read it, caused him
to snatch off his cap and give vent to a
cheer.
"Hooray! This is bully news!" sang
the auburn-haired boxer. Then he turned
to show it to an acquaintance, but at that
instant somebody with a hollow voice
said "exclusive," and Bob's teeth chat
tered. He crumpled up the yellow sheet
of paper and jamming it into a pocket
darted out of the place.
I hear on the best of authority that the
contents of that message were to the effect
that Mrs. Bob Fitzsimmons is just leav
ing New York, and will, along with baby
Fitz, soon be a member of the family out
at Cook's ranch. And it would be no
mere than fair, in view of tne fact that
Mrs. Jim Corbett is visiting her "hubby,"
that Fitzsimmons should not be forgot
ten. When Mrs. Fitzsimmons gels here
she will no doubt superintend the prep
aration of all of Bob's meals, as* she has
done of former occasions ot this kind.
During the past two or three evenings
Fitzsimmons has been making trips into
town, and in consequence queer stories
are being circulated. It is said that the
Cornishruan has during xhese visits pat
ronized several saloons liberally, and that
his potations were of the real old bard
stuff. But Fitzsimmons i 3 sucli a tricky
chap that I can't help believing that his
apparent violation of the rules of training
is a little game of his own, the object of
which is to prevent his price in the pools
from rising too high. He unquestionably
had the same object in view when he
allowed the impression to go abroad that
he was afraid to give Corbett the privilege
of hitting in the clinches and breakaways.
A lot of money is going to be wagered on
the Cornishraan's chances, and quite nat
urally his backers want to place their coin
at as good odds as possible. They would
like to see Corhett become a two-to-one
favorite, and nobody can blame them
for it.
"Mysterious" Billy Smith, the doughty
Boston lad who is to meet George Green
(Young Corbett) of San Francisco during
the coming carnival, arrived in Carson
from the East this evening and is quar
tered at the Arlington. Billy is bigger
and stronger than ever, and looks to be in
splendid fettle. He says he has been do
ing some light training since he heard
that he was to eel a match here, and
is not at all alarmed about not having
time to get into perfect condition. Tbe
fact that the match with Green is to be at

CARSON, Cal., Feb. 2.â Nobody could
withstand ihe temptation to venture out
to-day, and, with the exception of Dan
Stuart, all invalids from the visiting col
ony were about town. Stuart yielded to a
good apoetite this morning and now re
grets having eaten , so much breakfast.
His physician ordered him back to bed
and he is once more on the exclusive list.
George Siler still talKs from under his
vest, but his sore : throat is not very
troublesome and he is able to attend to
business. * .
Corbett gave up the entire day to his
wife and sister," who decorated his quarters
and received the visitors. In the evening
he limbered up a little at handball but did
not attempt any heavy work.
Fitzsimmons changed bis mind about
visiting Carson to-day and shortly before
noon he closed in on the tailboard of a
buggy and asked the driver to whip up.
The animal in front was a speedy trotter,
but Fitzsimmons hung on the entire dis
tance to the city, which was reached in
twelve minutes. Stepping np to a punch
ing machine at the end of his trip he sent
the indicator spinning to the 800 pound
mark with a straight left jab., On going
home he took matters easy and eat a
hearty dinner. . â  ,VJ â¢
Bob complained of a soreness about his
joints, which is probably a result of the
Cold which he has been nursing ever since
he arrived. The hot springs at the State
penitentiary have done him a world of
good, and he expenls that before the week
is over all lameness will have disappeared.
He began work in the afternoon with the
fourteen-round battle with the punching
bag, goins: rather carefully, as the bag in
use was the only one in repair. Within a
week the Australian has wrecked half a
dozen ol the strongest balls manufactured,
and Julian has ordered a double supply in
case of emergency. â¢ ,
"I like to see Bob use"up leather that
way," said Julian to a group of leporters.
"It shows that he still han a few punches
left in him. It takes a hard blow to rip
one of those bags, but they last no time
when he once gets going."
"Yon should see the letters we are get
ting," he continued. "Every crank in the
country has a sure cure for colds, and the
number of knockout blows which hava
been recommended to us is simply amaz
inp. The letters are very cheering to Bob,
though, as they convince him more thor
oughly than ever that the American pub
lic is behind him in this fight and that
t'.iey appreciate a winner more than a
talker."' ' '
Tho wrestling mat was rolled out after
Fitzsimmons had finished with the
punching- and Roeber stripped for
action. A crippled finger prevented the
wrestler from appearing at his best, and
Bob rolled him about as he pleased.
When the floor was cleared azain Ilicucy
and Stelzaer were polished off in short
order, and tne Cornishman evidently for
got all about bis stiff elbow. He cut both
his opponents right and left w.thout any
exertion, and showed greater speed than
he has yet displayed. Those who sat
about the dance hall watching the exer
cise left the building convinced that Fitz
simmons would give his backers a warm
run for their money.
Over at the Coliseum everything is going
shipshape and seats are already in place

Disturbance.

Z ologists Declare That the City
Lies Over a Mammoth Gas
Reservoir.
SALT LAKE, Utah, March 2.â Report
which continue to pour in from the scene
of the volcanic disturbance in Great Salt
Late have not tended io decrease the
alarm felt in this vicinity. That some
monster force has rent the bed of the in
land sea, churning the waters into a cal
dron unil sending skyward clouds of
smoke and steam, cannot now be disputed
by those who were at first skeptical. The
phenomenon ha- revived the theory that
beneath this entire section ia a monster
gas reservoir, stored with explosive
vapors which threaten at any moment to
burst through the thin crust of earth
above them. Certain geologists have gone
so far as to even predict that the time
may come when this crust, specked with
Great Strike of Natural Gas Near
Salt Lake City.
The recent volcanic disturbance In Great
Salt Lake is attributed to the escape of natural
gas from a great reservoir which underlies a
large portion of Utah. This storugc; tank,
created by nature, has been tapped by man,
and its output supplies Utah's metropolis. The
blazing column here depicted ascends from a.
well sunk four years ago. The column is 95
feet in height.
human habitations, will give way, and
that Salt Lnke City will go crashing down
into the abyss.
An old farmer of Box Elder County to
day expressed t lie opinion that the up
heavnl in the lake was caused by the ex
plosion of natural gas. Along that
section of the lake shore heavy flows have
been struck, and the pas Irom them has
been burning for many years. Within a
couple of milas of the s^ene of the late
disturbance there are several places on
the shore of the lake, in Box Eider
County, where the gas arises to tug sur
face of thÂ« ground in streams of water,
which can bs ignited with a match. In
one spot, at the north end of the lake,
there are what might be termed miniature
geysers, and these are so strongly impreg
nated with natural gas as to be highly in
flammable. It is a common thing for lads
of that vicinity to sport with these ready
made bonfires.
The Call's informant seems to be of the
opinion that the reported volcano in the
lake is one of the gas and water geysers of
magnified proportions, or probably a
combination of water, lire and gas, a
thing considered not at all improbable by
those who know the geological formation
of tie country from a point on the lake
shore opposite Salt Lake City to the
promonitory on the extreme end of Salt
Lake.
The flows of natural gas now in use in
this city are found near the lake shore
just such a formation as exists in Box
Elder County â and in early days of ex
ploration for gas it was no uncommon
thing for men who were boring to see their
derricks and other materials blow into the
air by a sudden and unexpected current.
The greater portion of the gas flows al
ready struck hare been accompanied by
streams of thin mud or muddy water,
most of which had a sulphurous smell to
it. Within a distance of two miles from
Salt Lake City and running north for a
distance of two miles further are large
springs of hot sulphur water and mineral
water. At the latter point they disappear,
only to break forth again a few miles
above Ojcden, whence they continue until
Brigham City â opposite which the com
motion in tho lake is now located â is
reached.
There is much speculation in Brigham
and vicinity as to the outcome, and if it
be serious there the same conditions may
prevail at the point from which Salt Lake
City gets its natural gas. That the entire
section is volcanic in its nature all geolo
gists admit.

IT MAKES SAUSALITANS SMILE.
Weird Romance Which the "New Journal
ism" Evolved From a Three-Foot
Landslide.
SAUSALITO, Cal., March 2.â There is
indignation in the railroad offices here
over the "fake" story printed in the Ex
aminer this morning about "a tramp's
heroic action" in saving the southbound
freight on the North Pacific Coast Rail
road near Marshalls yesterday morning.
Superintendent E. H. Shoemaker says
the story was evolved out of a little inci
dent which occurred near Marshalls.
According to the Examiner a landslide
near Hamlet siding had carried away the
ballast between the tracks for a distance
of fifty feet. Mr. Shoemaker said this Mas
not so ; the slide, wbicn was not ten feet
in width, came just to the edge of the ties,
and the track at no point was in danger.
Trains had gone over it in safety.
"I sent a dispatch to the Examiner cor
respondent last nient," said the superin
tendent, "giving the facts, and to-day this
story was published."
The superintendent said that wbat
really occurred was that the tramp, while
walking along the tract, nad discovered
the slide and informed the operator at
Marshalls. Tne tramp was brought to
Sausalito on the train, and, baying ren
dered the railroad a service in reporting
the f.ict that a slide had occurred, and be
ing without money, Mr. Shoemaker bad
given the man bis dinner and lodgings,
and this morning he left for the City.
It was from ihis that the Examiner had
woven a story full of heroism, but lacking
the essential quality of being true.
The men arriving on the train from

WKDN PDAY BtABCH 3, 1897
â¢ During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
4429 inches
of advertisements, which is
318 inches more
than was published by any other
San. Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
The last day of Cleveland.
M.cKinley is the man for us all.
We are about to inaugurate new things.
Rnln or shine, to-morrow will be a bright
day for the country.
It is a sure thing the inaugural address
will-be full of cheer lor the people.
There are no longer any speculations
about the tariff. Everybody recognizes it
as a sure thing.
The Examiner is fast crawling into a
hole on the bribery charge, and a very
small hole at that.
With a good President, a good Cabinet,
a good Congress and a good season, we are
certain of good times.
As the Senate did a creat deal of work '
on Sunday with very little talk it may be
said to have given the country a rest.
When work on the Federal building is
begun we shall see the fake organ turn
round and pretend it was always in favor i
of it.
â¢â¢ . .
The true friends of labor are those who
promote public improvements, and ihat is
what The Call has done, is doing and
will continue to do.
The French Government last year made
$82, 000,000 out of the tobacco monopoly,
and the people of the country who are not
up to snuff have to smoke for it.
The Legislature should remember that
the way to fit the punishment to the crime j
in the case of a slanderer is to make him '
swallow the poison of his own lies.
The investigation into the charges of
bribery made by the Examiner against the
Legislature will disclose nothing widely
different from the Li Yung Yuen dispatch.
If the proposal to appoint a Secretary of
Commerce and Industry is carried out
there will be more Cabinet pudding to dis
tribute. It is not yet too late to get a
mention.
It is said that several State Legislatures
are quieily discussing the advisability of
appointing special committees to go to
Carson to investigate the operation of the
prize- light law.
Dr. Parkhurst is said to be suffering
from overwork, and the eagerness with
which the people of New York aavise him
to take a rest implies a strong desire to
have one themselves.
Cleveland advocated Democracy and de
moralized it, free tra le and destroyed it,
the cold standard and blighted it. He also
advocated the retirement of greenbacks,
and that policy died before it could be
bcrn.
It is said Senator Cameron would like to
be Embassador to Russia, not that he cares
anything for the Russian?, but his fattier
was once Minister to that country, and
D >n desires to make as good a record as
the' old man.
If Long Green has any proof of his
charges against legislators it will be easy
for him to state the facts. If he hasn't,
it will be easy to expose the lies. An in
vestigation of Lone Gr-en need not be
long and it need not be trrcen.
Don't forget that Â» maBS-meeting to pro
mote the speedy construction of work on
itie Federal building is to be held in this
City to-morrow. It will be San Fran
cisco's inauguration of a new administra
tion and should be largely attended.
In making the investigation of the
â¢ hares of brilery, the legislative com
mittees should require the Examiner
to explain why it first made the char, es
wholesale and afterward said only a few
men are involved. It should be further
required to explain how it knows that only
a lew men are involved.
â¢ The New York Sun recently stated there
are many millionaires in that city whose
wealth is wholly unknown to the public,
and it now appears the same is true of
other cities. The executors of the estate
of a man in Washington nave applied for
permission to make an amended nventory
because in their lirst report they over
looked $3,000,000 of Uiiited States bonds.
It was not known even to the friends of
the deceased that he was so rich.
â¢ Last week the Examiner in flashy head
lines announced to the world, "Bribery in
uid of thievery; thousands of dollars cor
ruptly paid members of the Legislature
to influence their votes." Yesterday it
whined editorially "Evidence of bribery
is proverbially hard to pet." It pleaded
that it things were probed to the- bottom
some evidence might be found, but did
not suggest that it had any of its own to
offer. It is a- small hole the Examiner is
crawling into, but it may do for a reptile.
THE LEGISLATIVE INVESTIGATION.
With a degree of fear which could be born only of conscious guilt and with a
cunning inseparable from natural cowardice the Examiner is now endeavoring to
sneak away from the charges of bribery which it made against the members of tbe
Legislature last week, and is seeking to confuse the issue in such a way as to avoid
having to swallow the poison of its own slanders.
Last week in big Leadlines the Examiner announced to the world "Bribery in Aid
of Thievery â Thousands of Dollars Corruptly Paid Members of the Legislature to
Influence Their Votes." The legislators met the charge boldly, in both the Senate
and the Assembly a committee was appointed to investigate tbe statements made
by the Examtner. Now, however, the Examiner slinks already like a whipped cur, and
instead of offering: the evidence on which it based the statements whined out yester
day the coward's plea that tbe Inquiry "involves only few men," and mat "evidence
of bribery would be hard to get."
The people will not be misled by this sneak of the coward and the liar. The
charge which the committees of the two houses have been appointed to investigate is
the charge made by the Examiner. That which is to be discovered is the evidence on
which the correspondent of the Examiner at Sacramento based his charge and the
authority on which the Long Gresn manager in this City published it. The duties of
the two committees are simple. They have only to send for the correspondent and
for the manager of the Examiner and ask them whether they had any reason ot all for
their assertions, or whether the statements were simply a part and parcel of the fakes>
the lieÂ«, the scandals and the obscenities which the Examiner habitually publishes in
default of news.
There is no need for a dragnet Investigation. The culprits in the case are known.
They are the Examiner correspondent and the Examiner manager. These are the men
who have made the charges of bribery. These are the men who either have bad some
reason for their charges or else have been guilty of malicious lying. These are the
men who art accused at the bar of public opinion. These are the men who are to
stand as defendants before the lecislative committees. It is by their own testimony
they are to be tried. If they can show any cau?e for their statements then it will be
time to inquire into that cause and see how lar it furnished a valid ground for the
charges made. If they can show no cause then they are to be once more branded as
liars, slanderers, subsidy seekers and defamers of honest men.
The legislative committees should stick to the point. They should not permit
these rascals, however cunning they may be, to sneak away from the charee they have
made. They should not be permitted to crawl into any hole however small to escape
the punishment they merit. They should be held to answer for an offense which they
committed of their own will, meanly and maliciously. They should be kept on the
rack until they have justified themselves, or else have been so exposed to public scorn
that the witness-stand will be for them a pillory in which they will be lashed until
they suffer the torture of a public exposure of their lying.
It should be easy lor the Examiner to show what cause, if any It had, for making
the attack upon the legislators. It should be easy for the correspondent and the man
ager to explain why they first made the charge wholesale, declaring that "thou
sands of dollars had been corruptly paid members of the Legislature," and then
asserted yesterday that only "a few men" wero involved in the charge. It should be
easy for them to explain why, if only a few men were involved, they first made
charges against so many men. It should be easy for them to explain how they know
that only a few men are involved. It should be easy for them to explain how they
know that only a few members are involved without knowing who these members are.
There is no reason whatever for making a long investigation of these charges.
There is no reason w'y the Legislature should be kept in session for many days to
seek lor something of which there is no evidence forthcoming. If the committee will
semi direct for Long Green Lawrence and his correspondent at Sacramento and ask
them to give the acthori.'y on which they made their charges the whole issue can be
speedily settled. If they had any facts on which to base their charges they can cive
them as soon as they take the witness-stand. If they had none, that much can be
made evident as soon as they leave the witness-stand. The business therefore is as
simple as any that can be conceived. It requires no more than that the culprits
should be brought to the bar, exposed to the public, given a chance to make such
defense as they have, and in default of nny valid defense branded as liars and dis
missed from court.
THE LAST DAY.
This is the last day of the Cleveland
administration, and as such is the only
day of that administration which will be
completely satisfactory to the people.
Whatever view fnture generations may
take of Mr. Cleveland's second term, there
can be no question of the judgment pro
nounced upon it by contemporaries. Men
of all parties and the people well nigh
universally condemn it. With the excep
tion of a few men who constitute a clique
confined almost to New York City, there
is hardly a citizen of the Union who ap
proves the policy pursued by Mr. Cleve
land, or commends toe manner in which
it has been maintained.
The whole four years of Mr. Cleveland's
second term has been a period of depres
sion and disaster. Every industry and
every trade has been injuriously affected,
and every intelligent sudent of events
has perceived that the greater part of ail
tbe^e injuries has been duo to the falsa
theories and dogmatic course of the Presi
dent.
Born without any faculty of sympathy
with the people, or with the aspirations
of the Republic, Mr. Cleveland has of late
prided himself upon his isolation and
what he is pleased to consider his freedom
from popular influences. During the war
he shared none of the pairiot.c sentiments
of the people, nor did he care enough for
ihe preservation of the Union to join the
armies which fought to sustain it. Even
in those times ne stood aloof from his
fellow-citizens and was indifferent to Na
tional emergencies. These defects of his
youth have increased with age until now he
has become a man almost colossal in hii
egotism, and so self-Cump!acent that he
prides himself on bis lack of sympathy
with his country and his fellow-citizens.
To these personal characteristics of the
President we must attribute most of the
disasters wi.ich have befallen the country
during his administration. It was not
that he did not see that help was needed
during the panic which followed his in
auguration, but that he scorned to give it.
lie found delight in showing his indiffer
ence to popular clarr.or, and was so far
consistent in his course that he ignored
his own party as well as the people gener
ally. He made himself, i; possible, more
obnoxious to Democracy than to any
other portion of the people, and such was
the effect of his course that he reduced the
Democratic organization which bad been
successful in electing him to the Presi
dency to such a state of demoralization
that to-day it hardly exists as a potent
factor in the politics of the country.
To-morrow will be the glad day of the
year to Republicans and to the people
generally, because it w.l be the day of
the inauguration of McKlnley; but to
Democracy the gladnea- of the day will
consist in the fact that it is to bi the last
of Cleveland. The men who voted for
him will be best pleased to see him retire
from cfficÂ« under circumstances which are
tantamount to his retirement from poli
tics. During his administration he has
injured evory cause which he advocate.!.
He has ruined the free-trade propaganda
and blighted the hopes of those who de
sire to see the retirement of greenbacks.
To every cause which looked to him for
leadership he has proved the worst of
enemies, and even among his former
friends there will be rejoicing to-day, be
cause it is the last of Cleveland and of
Clevelandism.
A Boston reformer wisnes a tax law by
which each individual should t\x for him
self the amount of property he is to be
taxed on. When he dies ail th* prop-rty
on which he has paid taxes snail go ac
cording to his will or to his helrs-at-law,
but all property found in his estate over
and above the value on which he paid
taxes shall go to the State. The proposal
is ingenious, but tbere might be as many
ways of beating it as tbere ii of beating a
siot-maciiine.
Boston named one of her schro's in
honor of Gilbert Stuart, the artist, and the
artists of the city in recognition of the
comi>liinent to the profession presented
the school with a number of fine painting-.
Some of these Uoston ideas are quite com
mendable.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 3, 1897.
CABINET EXTENSION.
There is a movement in the East, ever
growing stronger and getting into more
practical shape, for the establishment of a
new Cabinet department to be d -voted to
the interests of commerce and manufac
ture*. The West should approve of this,
for it rtpsires and needs tÂ» c establishment
of a Department of Mines and Mining.
The two movements should join forces
and make a united effort to overcome that
prejudiced conservatism which is the only
barrier in the wav of the accomplishment
of these purposes, which, if executed,
would greatly facilitate the progress of
prosperity.
The bill providing for the establishment
of a Department of Commerce and Manu
factures was introduced into the Senate
last spring by Senator Frye, and it now
rests with the Senate Committee on Com
mpire. It is proposed to gather into a
single department all the bureaus which
are directly concerned with the trade and
industries of the country. The consular
service and Bureau of Statistics wou'd be
transferred from the Department of State
to the new department, as would likewise
many bureaus from the Treasury Depart
ment. It i* argued that the consular ser
vice should have its scope extended along
lines of usefulness not practicable under
the State Department, whose olfice is
diplomatic rather than commercial. Prom
ises to support the measure nave bren
mad* by a large number of the members
of both houses.
All the great countries of Europe have
separate departments whose duty it is to
promote the interests of commerce and
industry. The president of the Board of
Tralein England Is a Cabinet Minister,
and corresponding positions are provided
in the principal colonies. Even Persia has
a Minister of Commerce. When we con
sider that we have led the world in in
dustrial progress during the last twenty
five years it soems absurd to assert that
we do not need, or cannot afford, a Secre
tary of Commerce and Manufactures. Our
mining interests have also grown to im
mense proportions, and they should re
ceive such National attention as would
require the whole timo of a Cabinet officer,
who would draw to a center of organize*!
efficiency in his department all the scat
tered interests of mining States and Terri
tories.
THE OMAHA EXPOSITION.
The delegation from Oninha which has
come to California for the purpose
of promoting the interests of the
Trans-Mississippi Expos tion will find
public opinion in California predis
posed in their favor. As a rule the
people of California are inclined to tive
support to industrial expositions of all
kinds, since they tend to promote the
welfare of the State by making known
its products; but in the Omaha exposition
they take more than ordinary interest be
cause of its location. Wliatsoever is cal
culated to advance the irilfare ol the
trans-Mississippi region of the United
States finds in California a prompt and
willing champion.
The proposed exposition promises to be
one of the most notable ever held in this
country. It is in the hands of men of
energy, sagacity and competent busine.-s
ability. It is backed by otic of the most
progressive cities in the Union and is as
sured of sufficient capital to carry it to
success. It will have the active aid of
Chicago and St. Louis, prompted by the
generous rivalry of those two cities for
supremacy in the Western market. Its
successful accomplishment of good results
is therefore assured, and California will be
engaging in no hazardous enterprise if she
taxes part in it and endeavors to make a
showing second to no other State in the
Union.
It is time that the trans-Mississippi
region of the United States should make
earnest f-fforts to attract the attention of
home-seekers and men of wealth who are
seeking investments for their capital.
The Southern States have entered vigor
ously upon work of this kind and of late
have become formidable rivals to the
West In the South there has been held
recently a great exposition at Atlanta and
already another is being prepared at
Nashville for the coming summer. The
West must wate up if she expects to hold
her own in opposition to the energies of
the newly aroused South. Expositions in
the Western States on a scale large enough
to be National in their scope should be
held as frequently as possible, and when
ever one is undertaken California should
be prompt and liberal in giving to it en
couragement, support and assistance.

AROUND HE CORRILORS.
Hon. J. F. Thompson of Eureka, editor and
proprietor of the Daily Humboldt Standard,
has been dividing his time between San Fran
c.sco and Sacramento for the past iew days,
incidentally visiting at Fresno and Santa
Rosa. lv answer to a request for information
in regard 10 the resources and business out
look of Humboldt County he said : "Nature
has dealt generously by Humboldt County.
No other county of the State has greater or
more varied resources. Her chief sources of
wealth are lumb'T, butter, wool, mutton, beef,
fruit and fish. That county contains the finest
belt of redwood timber in the State. A close
estimate places the amount of standing red
wood timber at 30,000,000 000 feet, which at
the present rate of cutting will la^t more than
200 years. Besides this she has immense for
ests of oak, pine, spruce, flr and laurel. The
HON. JAMES F. THOMPSON.
mills of that county have a cutting capacity of
more than 200,000,000 feet per annum,
though the maximum amount has not been
sawed in recent years.
"Owing to the long continued business de
pression the output of lumber has declined
since 1892, the lowest figure being reacned in
1896 when only 120,000,000 feet, including
shingles, posts and tiles were exported. Several
of the larger mills were ictlo most of last year
and others were running on limited time, but
the prospects of a revival in that industry are
now brightening. The- foreign demand for
redwood seems to be increasing and larger
shipments to Australia, the Sandwich Islands
anil Cen'.ral America have been made during
the past two months than for the correspond
ing months for several years past. The Vance
mill, one of the largest redwood mills in the
State, is now running day and night to fiil
orders for the Australian market. 1h) Pacific
Lumber Company, which has its headquarters
in San Frnncisco. has completed the largest
and best constructed redwood mills in the
â world and is running at full capacity to re
plenish Its stock of lumber which was con
sumed during the construction of the new
mill, the original mill being burned some two
years ago. Dolbeer and Carson op 'rate two
large mills, McKay & Co., Isaac Minor and
Korbel Brothers have mills of from, fifty to one
hundred thousand feet capacity per day,
while several smaller lumber mills and
twenty-five shingle and shake mills employ
an army of loggers mid mill hands when the
lumbei trade i 9 good.
"Terminal rates on carload lots of lumber
and shing es have been secured over the
Southern Pacific and Northern Pacific roads
to Eastern points, and many carloads of flue
lumber und shingles have been shipped to
the Mississippi Va.ley direct during tiio past
year. The construction of the Nicaragua canal
would open the markets of the Eastern Â£tÂ»tes
to our redwood and prove of incalculable
benefit to our lumber industry.
"Next to redwood our dairies are the great
est sources of revenue. Last year Humboldt
produced over four million pounds of butter,
most of whicn v. a- sold In San Franci co and
brought the dairymen nearly $1,000,000.
Humboldt has ttie best soil arid c.nuete for
dairying to be found in the world. Clover
grows the year round in the valleys, and good
cows, even at the present low price of butter,
average from $50 to $75 worth of butter per
year. Recent legislation against the sale of
imitation butter and cheese has been ot great
vaiue to the dairying industry. Farmers no
linger make their own butter. Creaniories,
which use the latest and most approved ma
chinery and metnods, are found in every
neighborhood in our vtlleys, thus producing
the beÂ»t butter and securing foi Huinboidt
producers gilt-edge prices. The creameries
here increased from one in 1889 to twenty-six
in 1897, and the end is not yet.
"The southern and eastern portions of Hum
boldt County are adiipted to grczlng, and
sheep and cattle irom the hills find their way
to the San Francisco and other markets by
nearly every steamer. Wool, lumber and
'spuds' were formerly the chief articles of ex
port; but the Wilson tar;ff biil struck a deadly
blow at the wool industry. The wool men of
Humboldt, who formerly had from 10 to 36
cents a pound for their wool, and were in good
circumstances, have sold their wool clips for
the past four years for irom 8 to 12 cents.
This has ruined over half of them, and the
wool industry has been nearly destroyed.
Many large wool ranches have been soid by the
Sheriff, and but few remain unincuiubered.
With the restoration of a reasonable tariff on
wool, our grazinz lands will become valuable,
and wool will again De one of our staple pro
ductions. We are hoping that the extra ses
sion of Congress will give us such a ta iff, and
also give us protection oa California prunes,
raisins, oranges, lemons and other fruits.
"Our salmon fisheries, especially those on Eel
River, are a source of considerable revenue,
and with a new hmchery on that stream to
supply the river with young fish the run of
salmon will increase and our fisheries; will be
greatly increased in value. Wo have two Gov
ernment hatcheries already. One near Hoopa
nnd ihe othei on the north fork of Mad
River under control of Captain Dougherty,
which are doing great good in stocking our
streams with salmon, trout and other food
fish. Senator Gillette and our representatives
in the Assembly have been making a vigorous
fight in the Legislature to so amend our fish
ing laws as to give fie flshernieu a chance to
take salmon in October, and they will probably
get half of that month into the open season.
The salmon run comes later in Humboldt
than it does in the Sacramento, and this
change in the law is needed by our salmon fish
eries. Once let the hatcheries supply young
fish for Eel River and in a iew years we shall
ship hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
of that most excellent fi^h to market.
"Humboldt apples, like Ilumboldt wool, are
the best produce*] in the State. The codlin
moth and other insect pests have not reached
our orchards, and white we cannot compete
with some sections ot California in apricots,
pears, prapes and citrus lruits, we can produce
the best apples and as good prunes and
peaches as any county in the Htatc. Nature
irrigates our hills and valleys. There is not
an irrigation ditch iv the county, and we need
none. Witn such a soil and climate Hum
bold County shouldâ and willâ become an in
dustrial empire. It is a safe p. ace to invest
capita!. The expenditure of over $1,000,000
on tho entrance to out- harbor has greatly im
proved the bar and made it safe to enter or
leave our wnarves at all stages of the tide.
When the work is completed we shall have
one of the b'st and safest land-locked harbors
on the Pacific Coast. Our ship-building indus
try is a growing one. W.th the finest ship
building pine in the world, Eureka's two ship
yards have turned out some of the finest
ve-sels now found in the coastwise and foreign
trade.
"Last year five fine vessels were launched
from Bendixsen's shipyard, one being the
magnificent new steamer Humboldt, which
will make her first trip to Eureka in a few
days. With the revival in business, which is
now just beginning, we shall look for in
crensed activity in the mmber trade and in
crtasecl bu>inÂ»s3 in nil lines. Humboldt is a
grand county, and together with the rest of
this commonwealth its destiny is se
cure. The return of prosperity, which is
surely coming, will be felt in every artery
of our trade and commerce ere long.
"I am glad to see the papers ol San Francisco
paying some attention to Humboldt. With
their assistance we hope at some future day
to secure railway connection with this City.
Not many years ago a Chroncle writer located
Eureka in Oregon. I think that paper would
not make such a mistake now. The Call has
paid much attention to Eureka ana Hum
boldt County during the past two years, and
we fully appreciate it, as will ba seen by its
increased circulation among our people.
Eureka is larger than Santa Rosa, and repre
sents much wealth and industry. Arcata,
Ferndale, Fortuna, Rohnervillo, Scotia, Blue
Lake, Hydesvillo and Rio Dell, besides a score
of other nourishing to\vn3 and villages, fur
nish subscribers for the new Call, which has
made itself a welcome visitor to our homes
and firesides; for it represents the new jour
nalism of the reputable sort, and gives us the
news in attractive and readable form. Ido
not say this to throw bouquets at the paper.
Our people consider it the cleanest and best of
the San Francisco morning papers."
Letters From the People.
STATE WATER SYSTEM.
Only One Jtational Ansrcer to the Water
Qurtilon.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir :
It is surprising that such enterprising people
as Californians claim to beâ a claim they de
fend at all hazards â should not have led the
way for other States to a comprehensive solu
tion of the water question, for the reason that
the impounding and use of water for irriga
tion, as well as all the other uses common to
all parts of the Union, have necessarily occu
pied public attention in this State and elicited
discussion for years. On the contrary, we
have goue on to a haphazard way, rather
more than tome other States, leaving to local
private initiative and individual or corporate
enterprise the inauguration of nearly all
water-supply systems yet developed in the
State. It is not much to our credit, and we
are paying roundly ior our education and ex
perience.
Private capitalists seem indeed to hold a
perpetual franchise on public Intelligence as
well as jjiibilu enterprise. My impression is
that private capi'.a'.i.sis succeeded' In incor
porating a provision in the new constitution
of thi State which seriously hampered if it
does not in fact prevent public initiative by
the State iv constructing and operating pub
lic enterprises such as ft State sysem of irriga
tion and water supply by striking at the
financial department of the State govern
ment. I also beikve that statute laws inter
fere seriously in tne s-ame way. While the
eocd people sept the public enemy, known as
iha private capitalist, who iives to exploit pab
-1 c utilities, sowed financial tares all over the
field of public enterprise.
In a wurd, if it were possible under present
conditions, with the gr;p which capital has on
the means of creating and controlling public
semiment, to educate tne people into a larger
conception of the proper method of supplying
the whole State with a comprehensive water
system wh:c.i would supply at the cost of
service and a fraction of n cent profi t, not only
ull the irrigation facilities useful to the larmer
and orchurdist, the man with a five-acre tract
as weil and as cheaply us the man with 500
acres; but also the towns, villages and munici
palities with both water, host, light and power
through v uniform State water system, also
practically at cost of service, I think the pub
lic would find considerable law, and a part of
it constitutional law, in the way of the move
ment should they make amove to establish
such a system. The private capitalists, I
thiulc, have stolen a march on the icol people
Th y are r.wake and look ahead while the
people sleep.
I mn led io record these observations because
1 am greatly pleased with a suegestiou made
by Mr. Taylor Rogen of this City, in mo ai
dr.;s- to ihe Governor and Legislature of the
State, proposing certain public undertakings,
primarily lor the purpose of providing per
manent wort ior tne unemployed, and sec
ondly for the general welfare, but which I
fear cam.ot oe inaugurated because o: the
SIS obstacles to wnich I have referred.
While I nearuly accept the three different
methods of providing public employment
proposed by Mr. Rogers.it setins <o ms that
the entire State snould a; once respond to the
tnlM Plan and tlmi public sentiment must
be sufficiently enlightened to adopt it without
the need oi a tlncie aay's discussion, namely,
the plan to provide a State sjstemof water
su PT|y- Mr. Rog-.rs thus -tates it:
ihird Planâ Sau Francisco, Oakland, Sacra
mento and many other interior towns are in
need oi water systems, either b. cause they aro
burdened by tho present water rates or be
cause oi the inferiority of the water supplied.
v. lu l. e ! IQS P lnc e'l Â»Â»e Sierra Novadas ulong

at convenient points along this mountain
rnnge and conduct therefrom the water into
tne cities for human use and the irrigation of
ihe rands of the Sacramento and San Jojquin
valleys, etc.. the State charging a reasonable
price for the water supplied."
Uy striving after brevity of statement and
terseness of expression Mr. Rogers has ob
scured some of the most nseiul and striking
teature3 of a comprHiet.sive State system ot
water supply. He proposes, as the better of
two way* for raising me means for under
tnking this great and sorely needed public
enterprise, "that California should issue its
own scrip end make it redeemab c tn payment
of town, city, county and State taxes and re
ceivable for official salaries, etc.," but he i-iils
to add a penalty for those whose in threats
would lead them to refuse it or oppose Us use
By the use of scrip no inierest would bo paid
on the outlay, and in due time thf> debt would
be paid through nnuual taxes and the salaries
of public officials.
One wouid naturally think that the mere
statement of such a p.nn lor creating a noble
system of State irrigation and the supply of
water lor the domesuc use of the inhabi.ants
of our villages, towns and cities, and for tr.e
transmission of power, light and heat at far
cheaper rates than can be produced in any
other manner, and at the same time thereby
to provide abundance of work at a moderato
' rate of 'waSesiror ail our unemployed, would
arouse the State, and pub'.ic meetinss would â¢ â¢
to > neid iv all the towns and cities to urge the â

Sâ¢ us laeislature, and that every newspaper,
dai v auTweekiV; little and b!g, would espouse
itaÂ«Bt once the c*use of humanity unu the
one rational and nna. solution of the water

TO HELP OUT THE
SUPREME COURT
Plan io Increase the Powers
of the Justices of
the Peace.
A Substitute fcr the New Ap
pellate Court Bill in the
Legislature.
If It Succeeds Only Licensed Attor
neys Can Be E ccted as
Justices.
A number of attorneys of (his City.
headed by Justice of the Peace Groezintfer,
will make an effort to help out the Leg
islature in one of tuff problems that now
confronts itâ that of relieving the calen
dar of the Supreme Court from the
crowded condition that often sets im
portant cases back for months.
A bill is now being considered at Sacra
mento which aims to create a new appel
late court, with jurisdiction sufficient to
take care of much of the work of the Su
preme Court, to the end that cases may be
promptly decided.
The attorneys mentioned will have a
substitute presented which, they believe,
will solve the problem in a much more
simple manner, and, at the same time,
not increase the expense of maintaining
the present courts.
They will ask the Legislature to amend
the constitution so that the Justices' courts
shall have jurisdiction over cases where the
amount involved does not exceed $000,
instead o $299 99, as at present.
Tnis will take much oi tho pressure off
the Supreme Court, as a majority of the
cases bandied by the Sut erior Court are
for amounts iess than $600, and the?e will
only be ai>pealed to tlis.- Superior Court.
The substitute will albo demand that
pniv attorneys licensed to practice before
the Supreme Court of the State be eligible
to hold the office of Justice of the Peace.
"Instead of creating an intermediate
Appellate Court, as is proposed," said
Justice Groezinger yesterday, "the busi
ness of both the Su; remo Court and the
Superior Court would bj largely dimin
ished and their calendars kept clear by
tir.*t passing a law requiring that all
Justices of the Peace in ttiis State be ad
mitted practitioners in all courts in the
State. Then by a simple amendment to
the constitution increase the jurisdiction
of the Justices' Courts from its present
limit of $29999 to about $tWO. In other
words douo.e it and also increase the
court's jurisdiction in cases of loieclosare
of liens on personal property from its
present limit of under $300 and give it
jurisdiction to try case^ wtiereln the value
ul the personal property or tne amount of
the lien does not exceed the sum of $iOO.
No more Ju-tices would be required in
mis State and the businessof the Superior
and Supreme courts would be reduced
about one-half.
"Statistics show that a majority of the
cases for the recovery of money or dam
ages filfd ;n the Superior Court are be
tween $3<X) and $'300 and three-fourths of I
those casrs are appealed to the Supreme |
Court of this btate, and it is these cases j
that cJo^ tne calendars and take up tho {
time of the much overworked Super.or ]
Judges. Consequently when an important j
case is appealed to the court it is years
before it'is finally decided.
"It, as is proposed, the jurisdiction of }
the Justices' Courts is incitased all this j
can Le remedied without creating any j
other courts or reorganizing our whole
judicial system. There is no reason why
this should not be done, for surely a
Judge competent to try a case wherein |
the amount involved is $2a9 99 is just as j
competent to try a cat^e oi $600, ior the j
same law governs each casa and both are j
tried on the same facts, the amount being i
only a limitation as to jurisdiction.
'â¢The Superior Court would then be the j
Appellate Court of the Justices' Court, |
and a penaity could be charged upagainst â 
the party appealing, in the W3y of a smill i
percentage of the amount invoived. |
should the appellant lose the appeal said j
penalty to po to the coun'.y. Tnis would s
help the county in revenue and stop many
frivolous appeals, tuere being no uenalty j
other than costs at the present time.
'â¢If Justices were compelled to be prac
titioners of the Supreme Court better Jus
tices woold be e.ected oy the people, and
their jurisdiction being increased better!
lawyers would aspire to the office. Be- j
eides, this would be a very popular meas- i
ure with the attorneys, as in the interior
counties in this State no qualification is
required, as to knowledge of law, of a
Justice."

The American Ship Ircquois That Arrived Frcm New Ycrfc Last Monday Night in the Smart Time
of 137 Days. She Is One of the Handsomest Vessels in the Bay and Captain Taylor Is
Jastly Proud of Her.
A MIZZEN FROG
THAT MYSTIFIED
But the Freak on the
Ircquois Is Now Ex
plained.
It Wa3 a Pet Brought Aboard
at New York by Oae
of the Crew.
A Row at the Ferries Over an Over
coat Caused the Arrest of
Two Young Men.
The American ship Iroquois had a hard
time of it on her trip from New York to
San Francisco. O.i Beveral occasions she
was in danger and twice the sails were
split and sever.il of tnem carried away.
While lying becalmed two swotdfish were
caught and the crew cutoff their heads
and mounted them. When 1500 miles off
the coast of Chile a froj; was discovered in
the main, rigging and speculation was rife
as to how it got there. The rurin:ng-gear
had been newly tarred and Mr. Frog got
entangled in the sticky mass and could
not get away. There was considerable
discussion among tho ollicers as to how
the batracnian got there, but no solution
could be reached. Tne matter was solved
yesterday, however, when one of the crew
explained at the Vall*jo-atreet steps that
it was a pet frog and bad lived in one ot
the bunk-j from the time the vessel left
New York. Its owner was playing with it
when the call came for ail hands to
sliorten sail. The sailor put the frog in
his pocket and went aloft. When ho re
turned to the forecastle the frog was gone
and was not discovered again until found
in the rigging.
The Iroquois is a very handsome vessel,
in fact one o: the handsomest American
vessels that comes to this port. Sup is as
clean as a new pin and to look at no one
would ever think she had been through
any heavy weather during the voyage.
The Southern Pacitic has called in all
the tickets heretofore issued to stevedores.
The agents ot the company assert that the
privUepe has been auused and that in
luture only about two firms will be given
tickets. The stevedores have a great deal
of work to do at Long wharf, O.kland, and
at the Alameda Mole unloading vessels.
and the railroad company lias been in the
habit of issuing them sixty tickets, good
for one trip each, for $3. These the boss
stevedore issued to the longshoremen who
were sent over to work on the vessels and
the company honored them. Now the as
sertion is made by the corporation that
the tickets have been given to all and
sundry and that hundreds of people have
traveled on a 5-cent ticket who should
have paid 10 cents. A stevedore who hai
Jorty men at work almost constantly has
had his tickets called in, and as lie ha- at
least another month's work ahead of him
it means an extra expense of at least $50
to him alone. Tha liut has gone out, how
ever, and like the laws of the Medos and
Persians it ii unalterable.
D. Cameron, chief engineer of the steam
whaler 1 brasher, is wanted by the nolic?.
He owes W. P. Herman, tbe boaVding
master, for board and lodging and money
loaned, but he never offered to pay a cent
even though he did get a good advance.
As tho Thrasher was uDout to sail Her
man swore out a warrant for his arrest
on a charge of defrauding an innkeeper.
Officer Courneen of the harbor police was
sent out to bring the man in, but the crew
would not allow him into the engine
room. To-day CaDtain Dunleavy wiil
have all the sailors arrested on a charge
oi obstructing an ollic r m the discharge
of nis duty.
The steamship Alarm-da, which was to
have sailed for Australia via Honolulu to

S. W. Emmon wrote asking the board
to grant him the privilege of using the
State wharf at the north approach to the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany's wharf. The state of Spear street
was such, he added, that it was unsafe and
impassable. This request was relerred to
tlie chief engineer.
Edward R. Swain rendered his report
concerning the Dro^ress of the work on
the union depot and ferry-house. "Tne
work ot erection," hÂ» wrote, "nas been

Tne Risdon Iron Works have nearly com
pleted section 2 of the building, only a
small portion of the steelwork remaining

contractors for the stone and masonry
work, the report stated, had maue a good
commencement, all the granite beint; set
for section 1, and some of the sandstone
piers un and ready for the arch stone.
Attorney Foid notified tne board by
letter that in the matter of dockage

pay. The letter was filed.
The following bids on lumber were re

The bark Martha D.ivis, on the berth
for Honolulu, has more cargo offering
than she can carry. She wi!i get away in
a day or so, and CaDtain Soule is in hopes
of making a quiet trip. He is to be mar
ried to one of the belles of Honolulu next
July, and when the vessel gets back here
he will leave her and return to Hawaii.
There he will make hii home and go into
busine-s for himself. Captain Soule is a
general favorite here and tho water front
will miss turn.
The new schooner Hono'ulu is not a
success in li^'ht winds and calms. Four
of her crew, who came up onthe brig Lur
llne, say that in anythine like a breeze
she is a splendid sea boat, but in a ca.m
she roils L'linwales under. She has v great
spread of canvas, and the sails flaf>ping
against the mas-ts and yards broKe three
gaffs during the trip. The men say she is
a comfottabie boat and a sailer in heavy
weather, but in lieht winds and calms
they consider her a failure.
The French steamer La Madeleine is to
brvea thorough overhauling. It was at
first thought that she could be patched up
and made as good as new, but the captain
soon f^und out his mistake. A thorough
examination snowed that it would take at
least *ixty days to make the repairs, and
bids were called for. Ttie competition was
brisk and the Kisdon Iron Works secured
the job. It is expected that about May
the Li Madeleine will be on her way to
her iiome port in South America.
G. Mocolrich, a teamster, had a narrow
escape on East street yesterduy. He was
taking a ca^k of wine to ti.e lerries, when
his horses swerved. The nut came off the
fore axis of the wagon, and the wheel fol
lowed suit. The barrel of w.ne tipped
ov r, and in its fall turned wagon and
horses over. Macolrich fell under the
wagon and escaped with a badly cut chin
and the loÂ»s of a couple of teeth. The
wharf rats got around the wine barrel,
which was leakine, but Officer Con Dono
liue soon drove them avfay. The team
ster was taken home, and soon afterward
another team came along and took away
the wine.
Charles Wilson, engineer of the steam
power barge Renown, had a narrow escape
last Monday night. The barpe has been
alongside the Burmah. at Green-street
wharf, for some days, and Wilson went up
town to get some groceries. Oa his way
home he mistook the chute a little south
ofGieen street for the wharf and walked
overbonrd. He yelled for help, and Al
bert Heyer, who was asleep in Crowley's
boathouse, heard and went at once to his
nssistance. After some trouble Albert
fished him oat and got him on dry land.
He was a pitiable sight. Tho sugar had
melted and was running out of his pock
ets. The tea and coffee were ruined, and
some of the other packages in his pockets
were unrecognizable. Wilson easily found
his way aboard his boat after that, but it
is safe to say that he will never again
mistake a chute for a wharf.
A great ocean race has just been com
pleted. The British ship Kahan le;t here
on November 20 and the Puritan, Cro
martyehire, Queen Margaret and Ross
shire on the 21st, all bound lor Great
Britain. A dinner and several suits of
clothes were wagerod on the outcome of
the race, but among local men the Puri
tan was the favorite. When a month out
the Ross-shire, Cromartyshlre and Puritan
were in company off the coast of Central
America, and there wan a creat deal of
good-natured badinage over the matter.
The captain of the Puritan, as she moved
ahead, offerel the other two boats a tow,
but as the matter turns out the Croruarty
Â«hire has beaten them all. She arrived at
Queenstown yesterday alter the smartest
run of the season. The victory is a popu
lar one as the master nas a great number
of friends in San Francisco.
Tliere was a very peculiar case at the
ferries yesterday. Whi.e walking through
the waiting-room Olicer Dowd saw a $5
piece on the floor. He picked it up and
aaked those around if anybody had lost
any money. No one had, bo ho turned the
money over to Sergeant Avon. Half an
hour later a telephone message came from
Superintendent Wilder of the narrow
gauge rout asking if a gold piece had
been picked up. The ticket agent asked
Dowd and he said "yes." Later tne money
waÂ» sent across the bay nnd ttie owner re
ceived it. According to the story a woman
rusned up in a hurry to the ticket agent
and ask* d for "one for Alameaa." She got
it and while taking out 10 cents dropped
the $5.
J. T. O'Brien.agirl named Maud, Edward
Johnson and another man were the
tenter of attraction at the ftrries yester
day. All except Johnson were bound for
Antiocb, and Johnson was bound to get
an overcoat he swore O'Brien had stolen
lrom him. Sergeant Avon was called in
and in answer to questions Johnson ad
mitted owing O'Brien money, but while
the latter said the coat had been given in
payment Johnson swore it had only been
loaned and that O'Brien was "running
away with the girl." Whilo the sergeant
was interrogating Maud, O'Brien and
Johnson got into a fitcbt and both were
locked up lor disturbing :he peace. At
the Harbor Police station O'Brien gave
his occupation as saloon-keeper and John
son said he was a bellboy. Tiie former was
reieased by Judge Campbell on his own
recognizanC9 and the latter put up cash
bail. In the meantime Maud and her
other male companion took the train tor
Antioch, where the supposition is that
they will await the coming of O'Brien.

THE EARNINGS
OF A LIFETIME
Taken From a Bootblack
by a Confidence
Operator.
John Kasich of Montana Changed
Valises With His
Victim.
In It Was All the Money That Petro
Corbelli Had Withdrawn From
the H;bernia.Eank
Detective E. J. Wren has landed in jail
one of the oldesl and most persuasive con
fidence men who has ever come here from
sunny Italy.
He is booked on a charge of grana lar
ceny at the City Prison under tbe namo
of John Kaaich, which is believed to be
fictitious.
The prisoner's most recent escapade
consists of working the valise chance act
on lih unsuspecting victim, a bootblack
named Petro Corbelli, whose stand ia at
the comer of Hyde and McAllister streets, i
KaÂ«ich patronized Corbelii's >tand quite
frequently about ten days ago und always
gave his countryman a half-dollar in pay
ment for a shine, always refusing the
chaupe. He related a story of vast wealth
possessed by his father ana himself in
Montana, whence he claimed he had just
arrived. He professed not to speak Ene
lish, and asked Corbelli to act as his
mend, companion, interpreter and guide*
in viewing the sights of this grent City.
The bootblack closed up his stand one
day last week and the two started out ami
enjoyed themselves. They s.oppei for
lunch at the Hoffman Cafe, where Kasich,
with a perfect disregard for money, handed
the waiter $20 in gold. As the latter
turned to get change Kasich impressed
his guide as a perfect Monte Cristo by
asking him in Italian:
"Did I give that servant enough ?"
Subsequently the confidence operator
asked his friend's advice as to a safe place
for him to deposit two big bundles of
greenbacks he packed about with him in
his coat pocket.
Corbelli suggested the hiring of a Safe
Deposit box.
"Is that where you keep your money,"
asked Kasich.
"No; I only have $315 and I have it on
deposit at the Hiberiiia Bank."
The man from Montana thought the
bank would not bo accessible enough on
account of its early closing hours and he
decided he would buy a valise, place his
money in it and thence in the Safe De
posit.
"I have confidence in you," he declared,
tapping the bootblack on the shoulder.
"I'll let you c*rry my key to the box so
that I'll be sure of not losing it, and be
side. I*,1 *, 1 will always want you to go and in
terpret for me when I call at the place.
By the way, you had better put your
money in the valise with mine."
As Corbelli was to be sole custodian of
the key to the box he agreed and drew his
account from the Hibernia Bank.
The two then repaired to the Safe De
posit building and the valise was carefully
stoweu away. But en route there they j
made a momentary stoppage for a drink;
in a couple of saloons, and in one of them
some confederate of Kasich substituted
another valise for tbe oue which held the
coin.
The Montana man and his victim sep- (
arated late that afternoon and neither mer |
again.
In a few days Corbelli became anxious
at his friend's absence, and bo went to |
the Safe Deposit box, where be bail placed
the valise. "The latter was still tliere, but j
in it there was no moneyâ nothing but .
rocks and a few packages of paper.
Detective Wren arrested Kjasicn yester- |
day morning at the corner of Powell and I
Market streets.

A CHECK, A NAME
AND A CHARGE
Warrant Out for George \
A. Atherstone for
Forgery.
He Was Employed as Cferk in
the Emporium Art
Department.
1
All Efforts of the Police Here and in
Oakland to Find Him
Unsuccessful.
The police in this City and in Oakland
are searching for Gcorga A. Atherstone,
who is wanted here on a charge of forg
ery.
Atherstone was until Saturday last em
ployed in the art department in the Em
porium by Mrs. Charles B. Wells. Tbe
department wns formerly conducted by
Mrs. Welis' husband, but since hi 3 death,
some months ago, she has managed his
estate, and all checks were signed by her,
"Estate Charles B. Wells, by Margaret A.
Wells."
Atherstone assisted Miss Mabel Nelson,
the young lady in charge of the depart
ment, and hs business had been slack
lately, Mrs. Wells decided to dispense
with Atherstone's services last Saturday.
It was part of Atberstone's duty to go
to the First National Bank and. cash
checks which Mrs. Wells was in the habit
of drawing to meet current expenses.
Monday afternoon Mrs. Wells went to
the bank to cash a check for $75 and was |
surprised to learn that Atliertono had
been there that morning and had cashed
a check for $500. She denied having signed
any such check, and an investigation
showed that Atberstore had also obtained
$250 on another check. Mrs. Wells was
bhown the checks and sne at once pro
nounced both to be forgeries.
Tne bank officials advised her to place
the matter in ttie hands of the police, and
she hastened to the Kmporium. Miss
Nelson was informed of the forgeries, and
sne went to police hendquarterd and laid
tbe facts before Chief Crowley.
None of the Police Judges could be
found, but Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds
ot Judge Low's court took the matter in
hand and prepared the warrant for Ather
stone's arrest, wbich was sworn to by Miss
Nelson before Justice of the Peace Grocz
inj;er. As it was believed that Atherstone
would leave the State Mis* Nelson, accom
panied Dy Policeman Wells, crossed over
to Oakland and the police there were asked
to arrest Atherstone. All the outgoing
trains were watched, but Atherstone tailed
to make his apnearence.
It is suspected that he is in hiding
either here or in Oakland, where be lived
with his parents, but all efforts to find
him have so lar proved futile.
The supposition is that Atherstone
secured two blank checks on Saturday
from the back of the check- book, and
after stamping them with a rubber stamp
bearing the words, "Estate of Charles B.
Wells.'Vforged Mrs. Wells' signature.
Atherstone is about 24 years of a*e and
is widely known in Oakland. His father,
Thomas S. Atherstone, was arrested some
months ago on the charge- of felony
embezzlement, and the case is still pend
ing in tbe Superior Court. He was cashier
for a sewing-machine company in the
Crocker buildinsr.

THE FAVORITES
IN HARD LUCK
Miss Rowena the Only
Winning First Choice
at Ingleside.
Leigh's Colt Good Times Easily
Disposed of Greyhurst and
Â» Scarf Pin.
Sweet Wiiliam. Won in a Big Gallop
Yemen Was I,2ft at the Post.
Can't Dance a Winner.
A mixea card of five races furnished
Borne rare guessing for the crowd at Ingle-
Bide yesterday, and the fortunate ones
were largely in the minority. The track
vras in- a slushy condition and the ones
picked out to carry the coin failed to run
up to expectations. The fourth race
was declared off, and bnt one first choice
proved successful in the other five events
decided.
Gene Leigh' 3 fine colt Good Times was
given the overlook again in the final
Beven-fnriong run, and the shrewd bet
tors now have cause for deep repentance.
Scarf Pin opened a G to 5 favorite, when a
big plunge was made on Grey hurst, forc
ing his odds from throes down to 9 to 5.
The favorite ana Griffin's gray colt raced
away In front when rfavey sent the five
starters awey, with Cash Sloan on Good
Times trailing several lengths further
Lack. Entering the stretch Cash made a
sharp turn with his mount and soon
headed the two leaders. The big colt crad
ually increased his advantage, winning
easily at the wire by nearly two lengths
from Grey hurst. The favorite was third.
The first two-year-old scramble at three
and a half furlonzs went to Irritator rid
den by Slaughter, which beat the barrier
lengths and won at the end in a
fierce drive, a nose before St. Philip, the
Macdonough entry. Morrellito made a
fine run, taking third place. The winner
was 4 to 1 in the betting.
Favorite followers played in hard luck
in the six-furlong dash that followed.
Yemen with Tod Sloan up was backed to
a pt.-.ndstill at odds of even money and 9
to 10, and when the barrier llew up the
aged sprinter together with George Palmer
was standing stilJ. Sweet William at odds
of 5 to.l then went out and spreadeaaled
his field, winning in a big romp from Red
dington ridden by Sam Doggett. Perseus,
the second choice, was a distant third.
In the three and a half furlong spin for
t.wo-year-olos that came next the Burns
& Waterirouse entries, Miss Koweaa and
Duckling, coupled in the betting and rul
ing 9 to 10 favorites, finished one two.
Miss Kowena led from the jump, leading
her stable-mate out at the wire six lengths.
Moringa tooic the show from Al Koran in
a hard drive.
J-oe Terry was backed off the boards to
win the mile and a furiong under selling
conditions, and seemed utterly at sea in
the sloDpy goinp, failing to g-t inside the
money. Eddie Jones had the mount, and
tue chestnut was played down from 5 to 2
to ti to 5. The rank outsider, Encino,
showed the way until nearing the turn
fur home, when Thorpe, on Can't Dane-,
assumed the lead, and the Corrigan horse
falloped in five lengths ahead of Morte
onse, which horse opened a 2 to 1 choice,
and receded to fives The winner went to
the post at odds ol 3 to 1.
LADIES* DAY AT INGLESIDE.
A Well Filled Card of Six Events

This is "ladies' day" at Ingleside track.
The gate will be free as usual to members
of the fair sex.
Presiding Judge Rees says Good Times
is his tip for the California Derby. Cap
tain Ree3 is undoubtedly about correct, in

appears to be about the very best three

KEA EETUENS.
He Explains That He Is a Victim of
Auxiuus Relatives-
C. B. Kea of Watsonville, who was re
ported missing by anxious friends, has
appeared all right. He explains that be
19 simply a victim of the anxiety oi his
friends.
The College Park property referred to
as disposed of by him was so dealt with
la9t fall, be acting perfectly regularly in
the matter on a power-of-attornt-y Irom
his mother. The latter is delighted at
her son's return and has no complaint to
find regarding his absence, except that v
occasioned her some anxiety. It is under
stood that Mr. Rea was suddenly called
away on important business and was un
able to notify his friends.
A PIONEER AT REST.
Benjamin G. Lathrop, a Man
of Forty-Nine,
Dead.
He Was Prominent in Military,
Mercantile and Social
Circles.
Benjamin Gordon Lathrop, one of the
earliest pioneers o: California, died on the
2J insc, at the residence of his daughter
Mrs. Walter Turn bull, 2217 Van Ness ave
nue. Mr. Lathrop was born in New
Hampshire in 1815, being at the time of
his deatu in his eighty-second year.
While yet a- young man he removed with
his parents to South Carolina, and subse
auently to Montgomery, Ala., where he

the Indian country. It was at this time
that he had his first experience in the
Indian war, beinir appointed lieutenant
colonel and division inspector on tne staff
of Major-General Taliaferro of the Ala
bama militia, but as the militia was not
called into active service he obtained per
mission to join Captain Whitmore's com
pany with a roving commission. Inside
of three months this little company had
gathered 8000 Indians and brought them
into camp, which virtually ended ihe
Creek Indian war.
In 1849 Lathrop was taken with the Cal

hftÂ°en men, white and black, and with
them undertook the difficult and danger

After the usual mining and mercantile
experiences incident to that early period
in California, Lathrop settled in San

A MODERN
CARAVANSARY
The Pabst Cafe Opened
To-Day to the
Public.
The Royal Eagle Distilleries
Company Ntw Enter
prise.
The Mist Elegant and Utrque Cafe
on the Coast.
The Pabst Cafe, located on the north
east corner of Powell and Ellis streets, in
that magnificent Â±>nilding just erected by
the Royal Eagle Distilleries Company,
will throw open its doors to the public to
day â Messrs. Herbert, Sonderleiter and
Rossuru proprietors.
The main entrance to the ladies' or
family cafe is on the Powell-street side.
Entering the wide and magnificent en
trance, with marble steps, wainscoting,
frescoed and mirrored on all sides,
while the balusters are studded with
magnificent electric lights, producing
the most brilliant and harmonious effects,
Here we behold the brightest of all charms
and ideas of a perfect cafe, finished in
birdseye maple; the floors inlaid with
hard woods by the Inlaid Floor Company,
602 Market street; the walls and ceilings
tinted and frescoed in the latest style of
the art; mirrors reflecting on all sides and
electric chandeliers and brackets of the
newest and novel styles and patterns
throwing lheir soft and effulgent light
upon the elegant paintings and surround
ings which adorn the walls and ceilings
in profusion.
From this brilliant scene we pass on
down a flight of stairs to theGerman-3tyle
banquet-room. Here may be seen some
thing in artistic decoration never before
placed before a San Francisco public.
Artists anil architects vied with one
another to produce something so unique
to demand the admiration of all who wit*
ne*s the scene.
The fine paintings on all sides, with the
soft lights shining through the beautifully
embossed and stained windows, are from
the easel of one of our most eminent local
artists, Ernest A. Otto.
To sip the elegant Cresta Blanca and
other popular wine 3 ana quaff the de
licious Pabst beer, which has no equal in
any land, to eat and digest food so skill
fully selected and carefully prepared by
the most experienced cooks and spread be
fore you by polite and trained waiters.
There are also a number of small din
ing-rooms. Every precaution will be ex
ercised to maintain a high standard of
excellence ana quiet in the place through
out so as not to mar the feelings of the
most fastidious. It must be borne in mind
that this is a tamily cafe, and not a resort
lor the undesirable element.
The immense ranges located in both
kitchens, together with their utensils,
wÂ»>re furnished by the well-known house
of W. \V. JVlontaeus & Co.
The grand entrance tc the bar, with its
mosaic floors, its Corinthian columns and
artistic marble sidings manufactured by
& Bianchi under the supervision
of .Mr. A. L. Sealer, is a marvel of beauty,
rich in designing and unique in construc
tion. The elegant locks and the pretty
bronze hinges ana in fuct nil the artistic
hardware throughout is from the house of
Miller, Slo->s A Scott.
The creation of this fine enterprise is
due to *he untiring energy and enterprise
of the well-known Royal Eagle Distilleries
Company.
The IVost Brewing Company, whose
great breweries, which are the largest in
the world, are located at Milwaukee,
Wis., is represented on the Pacific Coast
by the Royal EaglÂ» Distilleries Company.
On the upper lloors may be found ele
gant sunny apartments, en suite or single,
furnished with regal carpets, iurniture and
all accessories to make one comfortable.
This apartment-house is conducted on
the Eurnpean plan by that worthy lady,
Mrs. B. Becker, who will always be alert to
administer to those seeking rest.
The furniture and carpetÃ throughout
the entire upper portion of the building
and the massive tables, chairs and other
artistic furnishings of the saloon are the
work of the well-known Indianapolis
Furniture Company of 750 Mission street.
The rich draperies, the costly curtains and
cornices and the Persian and Turkish rugs
throughout the place are all worthy of
special mention, for each of them, by their
rich plegance, adds some new charm and
delight to the completeness of arrange
ment of one of the most finely equipped
establishments in the country. Well
might the big contract for furniÃhing the
house fall to the hands of this large con
cern, for the Indianapolis Furniture
Company is recognized to be the leading
fumiiure and rarpet house on fig coast.
To the fertile brain of Edw. Kolofroth,
the architect, is duo the conception and
planning of this great structure, aided by
C. Scbutt, the carpenter and builder, to
carry out these plans io erect a building
which is an ornament to the locality and
a credit to the City.
GERMAN MINISTERS MEET
Rev. J. M. Buehler Talks
Warmly of Religious
Liberty.
Rev. Dr. Fraser Makes Another
Pretest Against Higher
Criticism
The German Ministers' Club met yester
day for the second time since its organiza
tion in the German branch of the Young
Men's Christian Association. About
twenty pastors were present, representing
Lutherans of different synods, members
of the Evangelical Association, Baptists
and Methodists.
Rev. J. M. Buehler of St. Paul's Lu
theran Church read the continuation of a
paper on "Christian Unity, from Hier
archical and Constitutional Standpoints. "
The point ho emphasized wns that church
end state should not be united, and he
observed "the religious freedom granted
by the United Sta'es is the brightest star
in the flag of liberty."
Rev. Dr. Nobler of San Rafael addressed
the Presbyterian Ministerial Association
on "Immortality." which he said had
been a catholic thought of human beings
in all ages. Rev. Dr. Fraser made a few
remarks on the subject of education. "It
is a serious fact," he said, "that upward
of $5,000,000 has been appropriated for
education during the next two years and
the whole system of common-schooi edu
cation ignores religion.
"At one university religion is opposed
dogmatically, and it is time for Christians
to delend their faith. The Btate Uni
versi;y does not oppose religion, but the
chief professor of philosophy there asks
us to discard our faith on the ground that
it is not ethical, and now we are all to be
taxed to support that sort of thing."
There was no set paper at the Meth
odist preachers' meeting, but Evangelist
J H. Smith made an informal address on
"Rebaptisra of the Holy Spirit."
At the Christian Ministers' meeting yes
terday Rev. Dr. "W. A. Gardner of the
West Side Christian Chnrcb read a short
paper on "Soul Winning." He advocated
earnestness as the most efficient means
for winning souls.
A Missionary Tour.
Rev. Dr. Harris, superintendent of the
Japanese Mission on Pine street, will sail
on Thursday on the China for Honolulu,
accompanied by Evangelist J. H. Smith.
Dr. Harris' mission is to visit the Meth
odist Japanese missions in the Hawaiian
Islands, most of which he himself was in
strumental in founding. Evangelist Smith
will hold revival services in the islands.

PURE FOOD CRUSADE.
Conference Concerning the Prose
cution of Appealed
Cases.
District Attorney Barnes Will Lend
Assistance in Jury
Cas's
The Board of Health nnd representa
tives of the pure-food committee of the
Councilof Associated Industries yesterday,
through their representatives, conferred
with District Attorney Barnes for the pur
pose ot' expediting the prosecution of cases
of violation ot the pure-food law coming
from the police courts on appeal. Dr.
Morse, Dr. Lovelace, Isidor Jacobs and
Oscar Lewis, the last two-named repre
senting tne Council of Associated Indus
tries, were present at the conference with
District Attorney Barnes.
The whoie suoject of prosecutions was
discussed at considerable length. The
matter of bow much testimony is neces
sary received especial attention. District
Attorney Barnes said that it would not be
necessary that the analysis of the City
Chemist should be made in complete de
tail. It would be sulhcient evidence when
the fact had been determined that articles
sold had been adulterated. This fact
could be ascertained in comparatively
short time, whereas a complete and min
ute analysis might prove to be a matter of
many days in one case.
The Associated Industries' members
present said that there would be very
likely at least 100 arrests in the next few
weeks, and perhaps more, and they seemed
to be much gratified at Mr. Barnes' views
concernins? the amount of evidence needud.
District Attorney Barnes also aereed be
lore the conference was concluded that in
cases in the Police Court under the pure
food law, where jury trials are demanded,
he would send au'assistant to help conduct
the prosecution.

berry syrup containing sugar cane syrup and
aniline dye, and TiptoD brand of condensed

THE CAGED LADY
AT THE PALACE
She Keeps Herself Strictly
Within Her Royal ,
Apartments.
John Oakley, a Rich Pittstnrg
Broker, Who Is Masquerad
ing as a Courier.
His Family Thought Ha Had Gon
Southâ Doctors C. lied to His
Aid Yesterday.
The Countess Espanola, who, rumor has
it, is none other than her Highness, the
Princess Elvira, the elopinp; daughter of
Don Carlos, or if not that romantic lady
then the daughter of the Queen of Spain,
and her courier John M. Oak:ey of Pitts
burg, Px, maintained the strictest seclu
sion within their luxurious corner suite at
the Pa'ace yesterday. When the gentle
men of the press called to ask after their
health the response vouchsafed was in the
shape of a bellboy's slip with the number
of the room inscribed opposite the laconic
and inhospitable legend "out."
Of course this was scarcely meant to be
accepted literally. Both the Countess, or
the Princess, and her vigilant courier were
really in their rooms, but not wishing to
hurt the feelings of the fourth estate by
anything so brutal as a blank refusal to
,?rant an audience, they resorted to this
delicate expedient in order to convey an
irrevocable resolution of invisibility.
No doubt Mr. Oakley is obeying the
instructions of the Countess, or the Prin
cess, as the case may be, and is repenting
at Jeisure the indiscreet avowals be made
to The Call the o*her day when tue wine
that is yellow had stolen away his ability
to forecast consequences.
However, Mr. Oakley now realizes, no
doubt, that champagne dinners are hardly
consistent with the assumption of royal
dignity, and that a courier of the sister of
the Spanish Queen should do his spiriting
more gently, or at least in such wise that
a cold-blooded republican press may not
know of it. He prefers not to incur the
risk of revealing state secrets after dinner,
or before, for that matter, and all the
clerks at the Palace are under strict in
junctions not to admit reporters into the
royal presence.
The statement published yesterday
evening to the effect that Mr. Oakiey
visited San Francisco some time a o from
Pittsburg bearing letters of introduction
to Paymaster tikelding of the navy from
the latter's son c uld not .be verified in
the absence of the paymaster, who is now
in the Ejiit. It may be true that Mr.
Oakley was well received in army circles,
out it is none trie less true that his name
and his dignity are not even a local tra
dition.
Colonel Smedberg, for example, was
asked if he remembered any such person
as John Oakley. "Ah," said he, "you
refer to tlie champagne gentleman. No,
sir. Never heard of nor saw him in my
life that I know of."
Mr. Oakley was seen several times in the
Palace bar yesterday, and seemed then as
determined as ever to create a champagne
drought. Toward evening he sought the
privacy of his apartment, and not long
afterward, fetling indisposed, sent for
medical assistance.
Three or four doctors promptly re
sponded to the call and found their dis
tinguished patient in a state of nervous
collapse, due possibly to the overwhelm
ing responsibility of concealing important
State secrets, or else, as an unromantic
hotel guest chose to put it, to "stomacn
trouble, promoted by champagne pota
tions."
It was also whispered that the skin in
the corner of Mr. Oakley's left optic
showed a slight discoloration and abra
sion, or, as the aforesaid unromantic hotel
guest chose to express it, Mr. Oakley had
a black eye.
Experts gave it as their opinion that this
discoloration and aorasion were caused by
the tudden and forc.ble impact of a
champagne bottle. However, this is
merely speculation, and inductive reason
ing in isolated cases is not always con
clusive.
It was learned yesterday that this in
teresting and romantic couple had secured
passa&re for the Orient by the steamer
China, which sails to-morrow, and unless
eicher the courier or the Countess, other
wise the Princess, takes pity on the
curiosity of the public, the mystery of the
lady's identity bids fair to remain a
mystery.
From the fact that Oakley had a letter
of credit for Â£1000 among his possessions,
it wa3 at first supposed thai his base of
supplies was in Great Britain, but this
has been proved incorrect. His home is
in PittsLurn, and t;ie letter of credit was
evidently obtained with the view of being
well fortified while on a long trip abroad.
He appears not to have informed his
family as to where he proposed to journey,
and they seem only to have known that
he left recently on a trip to the South.
Mr. Oakley hasevidently grown gay since
he leit.
Instead of being a courier, as he repre
sented, he is a ricu broker of the Smoky
City. Evidently the gentleman delight's
in masquerading and in going forth at
odd times and places like Haroun Al
Kaschid.
The lady in the case, too, appears to be
known somewhat in and about Pittsburg.
If she is the Princess Elvira or the Arch
duchess oT Austria nnd sister of the Span
ish Queen, she has a happy knack of get
ting acquainted quickly.
The following dispatch was received
from the truant broker's home town lasl
night:
John M. Oakley la a well-known broker here
and is reputed 10 be very wealthy. A tele
phone message to his home brings the response
that he left lor the Soutn two weeks ago, but
informant declined to give destination or say
more.
Jessie Taylor of this city Is rather tall, yonng,
(rood-looking, dark bair and gÂ»y. Oakley is
about five feet ten inches, 48 to 50 years old,
thick brown beard clipped close; he in of me
dium build, weighing about ICO pounds.
WIDOWS IN POVEBTY.
A Gathering of Black-Robed Women
Pasaei Through the Mayor* Offlea.
From morning to the hour of closing
yesterday women in black â many of them
leading little children â tiled in and out of
the anteroom of the Mayor's office. Yes
terday was the first day upon which or
ders were given out for the money derived
from the Kobinson bequest fund, the in
come of which is paid to widows only.
This year there are about 300 widows on
the list.
The scene of yesterday has been paral
leled for the past few weeks in the court
room of Justice of thÂ« Peace Barry. To
Justice Barry the women in want have in
stinctively flocked to swear to their wia
owhood and their entire lack of means of
support. Justice Barry gave his services
lr*o of cost and graciously welcomed ibe
destitute widows, so that he became a
great lavorite among them.
The widows who yesterday received or
ders will have their claims further inves
tigated by the Associated Charities. Then
they will receive money.
Mrs. Coney's .Estate.
The will of Mrs. Rosalia L. de Coney, Ute
wife of Hon. A. K. Covey, Mexican Consul in

Simple ? As simple as two and two. It is electricity. Elec-
tricity is life." It is nerve force. By excesses or errors you waste
nerve force, and Dr. Sanden's Belt renews it.
Even electricity is useless if not intelligently applied. Dr. Sanden
has devoted twenty years to close study of the nerve forces and
physical powers, and even if other belts fail his treatment will cure.

IS IT MURDER,
NOT SUICIDE ?
The Mysterious Killing of
Stevedore William
Pattison.
His Widow and Her Former
Husband StrangeÂ»y M:xed
in the Case.
All the Parties Involved Bsger to
Have It Known That Decease!
Killed Himself.
An unknown man was conveyed to the
Receiving Hospital at 3:45 o'clock: yester
day morning.
\Vhen he was placed in the wagon at
342 Tehama street, he was still alive, but
unable to speak, having been shot
through the roof of the mouth a;id again
through the neck. He died before reach
ing the hospital, and his body was con
veyed to the Morgue.
Later on it was found that the dead
man's name was William Pattison, a
'longshoreman who worked for Stewart
Menzies, the stevedore.
The Morgue officials have accented the
case without further investigation, be
cause it came from the police, and the
latter are doing nothing in tbe way of an
investigation, because the man's wife says
he committed suicide, and her say-so is
corroborated by her sister, Lizzie Dwyer,
and a man named Thomas Laveil.
Whether the death of 'William Pattison
be suicide or murder must be determined
by future investigation.
An examination of the body at the
Morgue revea'.s the bullet holes, clear cut
and utterly devoid of the powder marks
that must necessarily have been made by
a pis ol held against his neck by a would
be suicide.
The widow claims, in one of her state
ments made shortly after the shooting,
ti:at her husband tried to coax her into
the bedroom, as he intended to kill her,
and as she ran out into the street he tired
one shot into the roof of bis mouth, then
he lay on the bed and shot himself in the
neck.
It was the bullet that went into the
nun's mouth and reached the brain that
cau-ea his death. It must necessarily
have incapacitated him from firing an
other shot, and the absence of powder
marks on the neclc indicates that any shot
tired at him must have been at long range.
Mrs. Pattison, the widow, and Lizzie
Dwyer, her sister, are very reticent in re
gard to the case.
All they will say is:
"We have told the police all about it
and it's only a plain case of suicide."
The widow is a waitress in the dance
hall at 210 Grant avenue. Her business is
to entertain tbe rough element that pat
ronizes such places and her wages depend
on contributions from her partners at the
dance and a per centage of the amount
she makes them spend at tne bar.
While plying her trade she met a man
named Ttion.as Falkner, a barber, and
married him. Their life after that was
not happy and they mutually agreed to
The Perfume of Violets I
The purity of the lily, the glow of the toss A
and the flush of Hebe combine in Pozzotri'af
wondrous Powder. I
separate, as the woman's affections seamed
to atray toward Paitison, the man who is
now dead. Patiison married the divorcee
on election day last, and he too began dis
agreeing with the woman, because she
made her former husband a constant com
panion.
The two men quarreled oft*n, and it
was a regularly understood thing that
Monday they were to meet and "tight it
out."
They met, but so fnr as is known they
drank instead of fighting, for both of
them were very drunk during the night.
In the company of one Richard Den
they drank considerably at the Zinkand,
and after 1 o'clock in the morning they
went to the dance ball to get Mrs. Patii
son and escor her home.
All parties concerned refuse to say where
the dead man and the former husband
parted, but Mr.Â«. Pattison's sister volun
teered the statement that when the sepa
rated it was as "the best of friends."
A young man named Thomas Laveil,
whose own room is at 73 Natoma street,
was found with Lizzie Dwyer, a ianitress
for the Crocker building, in tne Pattison
home at 2 o'clock in tfce morning, and
their claim is that Pattison and his wife
came in together and were quarreing.
Mrs. Patvison adds that for the first
time in all her troubles with iier husband â¢
he caled her "Mrs. Falkner" in a slurring
way, and ihen said he was going to kill
himself after disposing ol her.
The shooting followed, and when Laveil
ran to the bedroom it was found that Pat
tison was dying and Mrs. Pattison fell into
the live man's arms saying, "He would
have killed the other fellow, !> then she
swooned.
These are the circumstances as related
by all the parties, still, the only report
made by Officer Madden, who arrived* on
the scene at the call of Thomas Laveil, is:
"William Pattison (which is not the
right name) attempted to commit suicide
at 342 Tehama street and was sent to the
Receiving Hospital."

CALLS FOR THE MEETING.
Prominent Organizations Summon
Their Members to the Joint
Conference.
Three secretaries were kept busy yester
day getting out calls for the mass-meet
ing and, from what was stated, nearly all
will respond. Julian Sonntag of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion had discussed the meetine with sev
eral of the presidents of the oti.er bodies
and they outlined tue business to be
transacted. On returning to bis office he
caused to be forwarded at once the follow
ing invitation to Mayor Phelan, which,
without doubt, will be accepted:
San Francisco, March 2, 1897.
Hon. James D. Phelan, San Franciscoâ Dear
Sir: 1 have the honor to invite you to be pres

mercial and industrial organizations with the
object in view of requesting our Senators and
Representatives to urge the United States Gov
ernment officials to immediately issue orders

ARE THEY DOCTORS?
It. B. I.oe and W. I>. Brown Arrested
on the Complaint of a Lady
Patient.
Mrs. Henry Motz, Prescott House,
Kearny street, swore to two separate com
plaints in Judge Campbell's court yester
day charging B. B. Lee and W. L. Brown
with practicing medicine without a physi
cian's certificate or license. In Lee's case
the dates are given from June 3, 1896,
to January 15, 1897, and in Brown's case
February 28. Lee's bonds were fixed in
$600 and Brown's in $300.
They were arrested by Policeman Coogan
and booked at the City Prison. Both
claim that they can produce diplomas,
showing that they are fully qualified to
practice medicine. Lee is the "doctor"
who was first called in to attend Snarkey
after his knockout by Fitzsimmons.
Mrs. Mots, the complaining witness,
says she came from Santa Monica some
months ago for medical treatment in this
City.
READY TO RECEIVE TRUTH
Dharmapala Says That West

The Apostles of the Great Indian
Founder of a Religion Will Not
Preach to Barbarians.
Such an audience gathered to hear
Dharmapala at. Native Sons' Hall that the
smaller rooms of Golden Gate Lodge of
Theosophists, where the lecture was to
have been given Sunday night, early over
i flowed, and the audience had to transfer
! itself to the main hall downstairs.
The topic of the Buddhistic apostle was
j "CnriÂ«tianity and Buddhism Reconciled."
He said this might seem an impossibility,
but it was not by any means. Indeed,
nearly all of the doctrine of Christ was
J essentially the doctrine of Buddha,
preacbed 000 years before Christ was born.
If we add to Christ's teachings of peace
and brotherly love two tenetsâ the one,
"Do not destroy life," thai is, any con

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 3, 189?.
MARRIED AT THE CONCORDIA CLUB.
Miss Hilda Levy, daughter of Mrs. Meyer Levy, and Josua Eppinger, son of
Herman Eppinger, the well-known grain-broker, were married laÂ«t evening at 8:30
o'clock, at the Concordia Club rooms. Rev. Dr. Voorsanirer performed the cere
mony in the presence of 150 friends of the happy yonng couple. The bride, who is
one of the most popular belles in Jewish society, looked extremely lovely in her
bridal gown of white satin, completely covered with an overdress of accordion
pleated tulle. The veil was fastened to the coiffure by a wreath of orange blos
soms. The bridal bouquet was compose! of orchids, and lilies of the valley.
The attendants of tne bride were Miss Julia Eppinger, innid of honor, and Miss
Bernice Hirschman, Miss Alice Bachman, Miss Daisy Schweitzer and Miss Rica
Fiest, who officiated as bridesmaids. George H. Lavenson was best man and
Arthur Silverberg, Bernard Rosenberg, Morton H. Triest, Leon H. Cook the
ushers.
The maid of honor's gown was of white taffeta, finished with a stock and belt
of green silk. The bridesmaids were attired alike in white satin gowns, trimmed
alike with pink roses.
Mr. and Mrs. Eppinger will spend their honeymoon in Southern California.
posing the nsa of liquorâ and you will
have the teachings or doctrine cf Buddha,
he said.
Christ's teachings cannot form a uni
varsal religion without this doctrine of
compassion.
Buddha's doctrine was comprised in the
simplest truths. He sought to emanci
pate the mind from superstition. He
taught first thephilosopny of causation â
that everything had a cause, every cause
an effect, and upon that he built up his
system. Men should think good rather
than evil, for by so doing good would re
sult. Mere desire for good, however, was
not enough; they must strive. Metaphysi
cal questions were unimportant in this
consideration. What mattered it who
created the world? A man is shot. Does
he stop to inquire who 6hot hjm? He
would die if be did.
Dharmapala said he came to bring the
message of peace and brotherly love
that Buddha taught. "We Buddhists
hitherto bave for 2400 years refused to
go into barbaric countries where the
people were unprepared to receive the
truth. We wait. You have arrived at a
state of intellectual freedom that we be
lieve prepares you to receive it; the time
has come and I am here to bring you the
message."

A BIG FAMINE IN OPIUM
The Visible Supply or the Drug
in Chinatown Almost
Exhausted.
Treasury Agents Maks a General
Contraband War Against It
Wherever Found.
There is no to) Jir.g where the price of
opium will go to if the special agents of
the tr usury refuse to raise the siege
against the article. There ib a practical
famine of the drug in Chinatown, and as
the consignments in the warehouses are
under contraband just now, the prospect
of immediate supplies are not auspicious.
The action of the Treasury Department
in tying up all bonded consignments pend
ing an investigation of the manner in
which the drug was imported has had the
effect of discouraging further shipmentsâ
for the present An order for .$250,000
worth of the article from Reseno & Co. of
Hongkong has just been canceled by
Swayne & Hoyt, the custom-house
brokers- This shipment was due here
about the last of May.
As far as can be learned, there is very
little opium comine on the next two
steamers. The Coptic is due here on
March :0, but there is none of the drug in
the cargo manifest.
The treasury agents' are still keeping a
waicbf ul eye on Chinatown. A liberal
construction of the ruling made by the
agenta in relation to the consignments in
the bonded warehouses, should it be up
b eld by tne department attcr the investi
gation is completed, would probably leave
every pound of the drug in Chinatown
liable to seizure, inasmuch as almost the
entire local supply that clears through the
regular channels is distributed through
the medium of one or two Chinese firms:
Wherever a pound of opium is discovered
on the counters of Chinese merchants it
is being temporarily declared contraband
and carted away to the Appraisers' build
in*. - ; -'. : ...v:. -\T- . . -.-.'â  .; â â ' .â .â --; â -
Special Agent George E. Charming filed
a report with Collector Wiso yesterday of
this sort of seizures up to date. ;Ti.Â« docu
ment snows tuut . ovev- 2400 tins of five
taels each have been locked up already.
The list of these seizures is as follows:
Quong Fon Tai & Co., 1056 Dupont street,

The entertainment in honor of "Irish

promises to be a great success. The com
mittea of arrangements met last niglit in
Mr. Kavanagh's, southeast corner of Grove
and Steiner streets. Considerable progress
has already been made with the prelimin
aries, but tinal drafting of programme has
been deferred untfl next meeting.
The popular and efficient band of Sacred
Heart College will form the orchestra.
Miss Georgian* will give overtures on the
organ. Mr. Grennan will play a cornet
solo. A distiiiL'uishpd mandolin club of
seven ladies will perform. Master Arnold
Grazer (in characteristic Irish costume)
and Miss Gracia Nolan will figure in fancy
dancing. Such high class vocalists as
Miss Roonev, Miss Kirby, Mr. Woods,
Mr. Hynes and Mr. McAuiiffe will sing.
Father MacFadden, in his own inimi
table style, is expected to electrify the
audience. Everything promises to make
the event a great attraction. The highly
charitable purpose of the entertainment
makes it always seasonable.

STATE SUES FOR
TOLLS ON COAL
Transportation Lines Object'
to Double Charges
Made.
Litigation Delayed for a Con*
ference With the Harbor
Board.
Probability That Seme Agreement
Will Be Soo.o R <ched Out
s de of the Court.
A case was set for trial before Justice of
the Peace Barry at the new City Hall yes
terday afternoon, the decision in which
will indirectly involve sums annually
amounting to thousands of dollars. The
amount directly at issue in the case before
the Justice was small. The parties con
cerned were the State of California, as im
personated by the Board of Harbor Com
missioners and Charles R. Allen, the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company and the Union Transportation
Company.
The State Board of Harbor Commission
ers levied a charge of 5 cents per ton
against the parties named for coal carried
across the docks to be placed on board of
steam vessels. The same coal had al
ready paid a toll of 5 cents per ton to bs
landed. The defendants claimed that the
coal carried to the vessels was to be con
sidered as supplies, not being intended for
cargo, but being shipped for consumption
in the furnaces of the steamers to furnish
â¢team to propel the vessels. They refused
to pay tic toll on tl.e ground stated, and
the Harbor Commissioners thereupon be^
can suit some months ago. The case was
to have been heard yesterday, but it did
not come off, for the lawyers t. ought that
perhaps it would bo better to talk tbe mat
ter over fully with the Commissioners
first.
This conclusion was made known to
Justice Barry, who set the hearing for
March 10 at 10 a. m., when it will take
place if some understanding is not
reached in the meantime. From the City
Hall the attorneys went to the Board of
Harbor Commissioners' rooms, a meeting
of the board being in progress.
Tirey L. Ford made the statement, at
the conference which ensui-d, that the
coal in question was delivered across the
wharves to the transportation companies
in question from 1892 to 1894. Then H. J.

1
gation and Improvement Company, Mr,
Corcoran 'B attorney, Arthur L. LevinsKy
and C. R. Allen, coal dealer; spoke briefly.
They claimed that the coal was niereiy
used as ship's supplies, that it was not
merchandise; that even if it was mer
chandise, it originally came here from a
foreign port, and paid toll when it was
transported across the wharf on arrival, and
should not, therefore, pay a second toll on
being transported back again to the com
panies 1 vessels. The total amount sued
for by the board was $193, which, how
ever, was an overestimated amount.
The board agreed, on consideration, to
dismiss the action, if the defendants would
pay $100 as a settlement in full, the de
fendants to make known their determina
tion at Thursday's meeting.
Mr. Corcoran contended that the regu
latiou â â  of the board did not provide for
any such tolls, and that the transporta
tion companies received no notice thereof.
The regulations stated that tolls should
be paid upon the companies' care;o. where
as the coal was not cargo, but ship's sup
plies. It was manifestly unjust to ask
them to pay tolls, when neither before
nor since had any been exacted.
Secretary Keegan insisted, that tolls
were always charged upon coal used for
fuel purposes, and that the Dunsmuirs
compliecfwith this regulation without a
murmur.
"We complain," said Mr. Corcoran,
"that this is an attempt to make us liable
without giving us notice. Had we had
notice we could have settled tho question
of liability."
Mr. Lavinsky put this hypothetical
case: "Say the coal is delivered on board
one of our steamers for use as fuel, and
that just as the steamer is about to sail
she springs a leak and all the coal and
merchandise have to be removed to
another vessel. We are then met with a
toll' for carrying the coal across the
wharf."
Mr. Allen also maintained that tolls
were never mentioned when he supplied
the coal to the steamers. If he had known
that such a charge would be made he
would most certainly have regulated his
price accordingly.
HYDRAMS POS 00EAN VIEW.
The Bequest of the Improvement Club
ll:iÂ« Been Complied With.
The house-owners and residents of
Ocean View are considerably happier since
tne Supervisors have placed extra hy
drants along'the principal streets of that
settlement.
This additional precaution against fire
had become a necessity in consequence of
the many additional residences built there
within the past six year?.
To protect the property in that section
an engine-house had been built and an
engine and horsecart located there, but
the service this apparatus could render
was limited to a few streets in conse
quence of the scarcity of hydrants. This
drawback has been guarded against by the
additional hydrants.
At a meeting of the Ocean View Im
provement Club held at Taylor's Hall on
Sunday, a committee was appointed to
co-operate with the Sunset Improvement
Club in the opening 01 Nineteenth avenue
from Golden Gate Park to the Corbett
road, and from there through Ocean View
to the Mission county road. This would
give a direct outiet to the people of Ocean

NF.W YORK, N. V., March 2.â ln the early
â¢ > trading at th=- Stock Exchange the market was in
j fUned to weakness, owing chiefly to lower quota
. tions from London ana renewed activity on the'
â¢part of the bears, who were working for a reac
tion. The foreign selling was attributed to uneasi
ness, prevailing in London over the South African
situation, but in the aggregate the stock sold for
ibis ccouut was of insignificant proportions. The
trading was unimportant, except In the cases of
"Jersey Central and Manhattan. Jersey Central

led to purchases of stock for both the lonE nnd

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. March 2âA sharp bulge took
place to-day shortly after the opening, the strength
being imparted to the market by a jump of almost
2c in the May optlOD In St. Loufs and cables from
Llverpcol quoting l%d advance, opening ones
having shown but 1.411 n*\n from yesterday.
Trading was spasmodically active, but out
siders were conspicuously out of the market.

feature or noteworthy charat teristic. Commis
sion bouses were the best buyers, and scalpers
soU. The tonu was firm, evidently in recognition
of the strength of wheat, although the lndepenu
ent sentiment on this grain is far from bearish.

Convenient Headquarter*.
When the man who was sent ahead to
engage quarters in Albany for tlie com
ruittee 01 the Union L,eaÂ«ue Club told the
proprietor of the hotel what he wanted he
was asked:
"Do you want rooms such as are usually
used for iieadquarlers?"
"Howdosurn rooms differ from others?"
asked the emissary.
"Why, they are arranged so that people
can go in one door and out nnoiher with
out being seen by those entering," was the
reply.
"We don't want that kind," said Mr.
Sage, who was acting for the friends of
Mr. Choate. "We don't want any one who
is afraid of being seen in our headquarters
to come there. A man who is coward
enough to want to sneak out of the bacK
door is not brave enough to vote for Mr.
Choate."â Buffalo Express

TICKET LEADING
Little Doubt That Every
Candidate Will Be
Elected.
Captain Thomas Is Still Sick,
but H s Friends Are Mak
ing His Fight.
Le.dn; Citiz ns, Chos n Frcm All
Walks o. Lifr, to Reprc
s.nt tLe Party.
Oakland. Office Bab Francisco Call,)
I - Broadway, March 2. f
As the week wears on it becomes very
apparent that the dissatisfied elements
:>re qrnduaily breaking up and that the
Republican municipal ticket is daily gain
ing strength.
â¢The illness of Captain Thomas has kept
him from coming to the front, but his
cause has not been neglected and his able
contreres on the ticket have done their
best to fill ihe vacancy.
During the past few days all kinds of
campaign stories Have been circulated
and efforts huve been especially directed
against the Republican nominee for
Mayor. Many o: them have been effect
ive y contradicted and other-' have suc
cumbed under the weight of their own
falsity, and it now appears that Captain
Thomas and the rest of tne ticket will be
elected next Monday by a handsome ma
jority.
VY. A. Dow, tho Republican candidate
for City Attorney, has been a Councilman
i-iurinu all the time the water-front litiga
tion has been in progres-s. He is
fumiliar with the details of the City At
torney's office, and his record as a council
man has been approved by everybody
capable of juiging it honestly.
A. R. Wilson, who has been nominated
to succeed himself as City Engineer, is
meeting .with much opposition from his
Democratic opponent. But tver- is no
reason to surmise that he will be beaten
in the race. T ere was no opposition can
didate to him in the Republican nomina
tion, and so Mr. Wilson counts upon the
united vote of his party.
R. W. tfnow, the Auditor, and Z. P.
Gilpin, the Treasurer, at the City Hall,
are not making any campaign; "neither
t;ave they need to. They have established
the principle that the successful way to
run a city office is on business-iike meth
i ds, rtnd their reward was the nomination
from their party, which certainly means
their election.
In choosing Counciimen-at-large the
Republicans have chosen men of Known
standing and integrity. H. D. Talcott
proved his executive ability at a Repub
lican convention over which he presided,
and against his integrity no man dare
breathe a word.
B. C. Cuve.lier has lived in West Oak
land many year-. His business takes h m
across the bay, but he has always been
identified with progressive interests in
ihi< cur, and is popular and enjoys pub
lic confidence.
W. I>. Heitmann has b'en in the Coun
cil some years, and is well acquainted
with his duties. â  His prospects* for re
election are good, and there is no valid
objection to be made against his record.
W. B.iPringie is a young man lrora the
ea-i end of tne city. He is energetic, has
lived here all his life and will n.alce a good
Councilman. The tendency iii the p; si
has been to run to c derly iuen in choos
ing the c'uy government, and Mr. Pr.ngia
is an acrepiabie exception.
Tne Ward Councilmen are men well
known in the commercial and professional
walK.-i of iifp. J. F. Col burn, irom the
First Ward, is a r al estate man. The Sec
oud Ward tia- nominated Dr. F. S. Bodie.
M. W. Upton has been Dominated from
ttie Third; R. J. Boyer, the cigar-deaW,
from the Fourth j F. M. Parcells from the
filth; William Watkinson, who vacated
his position with the railroad company at
the time of the BtriKe, and who has been
some years in Ihe Council, Irom tiie
Sixth, and H. D Rowe from the Seven tii.
All of these gentlemen are making an
active cam7>aip;n, and will no doubt figure
in the Repub.icm majority that will be
counted next Monday n.^ht.
The nominations on the Republican
ticket for Srhoo! Directors cjuid no: be
improved. Dr. Myra Kncx has b'en pres
ident of the boaro. John A. Bntton has
the confidence of every parent in OaK
jjnd. John Ru^s i.as been on the
roard, and so has J. W. Evans. C. H.
Redmgton has the respect of the First

MORGAN ON MOTL
The Councilman V-olated Decency and
Propriety.
OAKLAND. Cal., March âBen Mor
gan has written an open letter in which
he takes to task President Mott of the
City Council for making public a private
letter which he (Morgan) wrote to Mott:
The letter of Mr. Morgan explains it
self. It is as follows:
Lick House. Pan /rancisco, March 2. 1807.
EdttOi Tribune: 1 no. ice in the Examiner
an article uuuclcing John L. l)RVie, caiuildnte
tor Mayor oi Onklund at the coming election,
:n wtiich Is published a let'.er from me to P. K.
Mo t, in which are used certain harsh expres
sions against Mr. Davie. My letter was not
intended for publication, and its publicaiion
br Mott without my consent was a violation
of decency and every canon of gentlemanly
propriety.
The course of Mr. Davie es Mayor during the
past two years is, in my opinion, a guarantee to
the people tha! they will, if he is continued in
oflii-e, be assuied of an honest administiation
oi the city's affairs. Whatever my private
gii.vance against Mr. Davie may be, were I a
voter In Oakland I should certainly vote for
him as a public duty.
The publication of my letter ior political
purposes is a iow. miserable trick, that I re
pudla c as beneath the contempt of every
honest man. Ben Morgan.
In Mr. Morgan's letter to Mr. Mott
there was also published a reference to
pome business transaction between the
Mayor and W. C. D-iaue. Mr. D jane has
also written an open letter, in which he
says that he has never had any reason to
question the integrity of Mr. Davie.
The Hamburg Show.
OAKLAND, Cal., March â All efforts
to get H. O. Trowbridge to reconsider his
resignation as Commissioner to the Inter
national Exhibition at Hamburg have
failed, asti* health will not permit him to
serve. Regarding the funds for the Cali
fornia exhibit he said: "I think there
will be enough money raised. It
will only i.eed about $3500 to runke v
creditable display and most of it had bei-n
raised before I sent in my resignation.
The ra Ircad and the Hamburg steamship
line will give free transportation, so there
will be comparatively little expense in
making a creditable display."

M .ny Significant Subj cts to Ba Dis
cussed at th Coming Called
Meeting:,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
IMS Broadway, March 2. )
The ladies of the Ebell Society are con
siderably disturbed. Some weeks ago lit
tle black balls were used by the secret
committee that passes on applicants. The
facts of the case were published in the pa
pers and the ladies were horrified.
Efforts were made to discover the an
worthy members that were discussing mat
ters of state in the forum, but they availed
nothing. Then som* of the members made
remarks to reporters and others raplied to
them, and for a couple of days there was
a sort of social riot. Some members did
not see why members should not be voted
on openly, and others frowned on such a
plebeian suggestion. Then some one said
it was a literary organization no more but
that it was a hou^-e of gossip, where rank
was measured uot by brains but by the
quality of the dress mnterial worn.
After a week or two of this kind of
friendly interchange of opinions matters
resumed their normal way.
Now a call has been issued for a spe
cial meeting on the afternoon of March
12. The purpose of the meeting will be to
endeavor to come to an understanding in
regard to the publication of the club mat
ters in the newspapers. I' nas been the
policy of the executive officials to refuse
to discuss club affairs publicly, nnd an ef
fort will be made to have the rank and
tile of the members accept this policy.
The meeting will be executive, and the
list of subjects to be discussed is slightly
significant.
There will b' short talks by different
members on the following subjects:
"How Much Si.ould a Club Entertain?"
"Tne Club and the Pressâ Whai sec al re
lations should not be described in the so
ciety columns of a newspaper?"
"The Ciub a Canleâ What may be
talked about to non-member? What be
longs to the private home life of the
club?"
"Social Lifeâ What woman is eligible
for membership? Within a club all belong
to one sÂ»-t "
"The "Unclubablo Member."
"The DiÂ«a.reeaoie Member."
"Qualifications for a Member of the
Nominating Committee."
1 Q allocations for a Director."
"Qualifications for a Member of a Com
miitfe."
"Who Rules?â All members are queens
and all are subjects. Association witn
peers the best for moral and mental devel
opment."
"Respect for Authority â The authority
of the directors ani of the conimit:ees."
''The Greatest Value of Class Work â
Not wnat is learnea in classes, but learn
ing to be willing to learn the great good."
"Does Club Life Promote Self-Sacrifice?
â Tne sacrifice of the one for the many,
fchall it be I or th^u?"
â 'Graciousness Dwells in a Woman's
Ciub."
"We want to keep our affairs to our
seives," said a rr>minent member to
night. "Where there are about 400 ladies
there are bound to be differences ot opin
ion and these create discussion. Our club
rooms are the places where these discus
sions begin, and it is our intention that
they shail not be carried on in public
print. It is very probable that a rule may
be passed that any member who shall
talk about club affairs to reporters will be
expelled."
AFTER A COMMANDANT.
Lieutenant W.nn's Successor to
Be Appointed Very
Soon.
Pref-Tencs of the SttUents for a
Commander Being Consulted
F.ve in the Field.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 2.-The bat
tle for the commandancy of the University
Battalion, which position becomes vacant
upon the retirement of Lieutenant Winn
in May, is waxing hot Five candidates
are in the field for the place, and each is
storming the fort in hopes of capturing the
po-ition. The board of regents will nroba
bly make the recommendation to the
Government of some one of the five young
candidates at their meeting next Tuesday.
The five who are after the position and
whose names have been spread abroad
among the students are Lieutenant Armes
of the Presidio, who played center in the
Olympic team last fall; Lieutenant Me-
Corruack, an Olympic end; Lieutenant
Nolan, also of the Presidio and a well
known athlete and social light; Lieuten
ant Cloman, lately of the East, and Lieu
tenant Anderson.
'I he situation with regard to the naming
of a commander for the Berkeley post is a
peculiar one just at this time. Such a bug
lear has the military service at the uni
versity become to the average student
that the regents in-tead of leaving the ap
pointment of an officer to the position
entirely in the hands of Uncle Sam have
Cecided to take into consideration the
feelings and wishes of the cadets with the
hope of making the service more agree
able. OrJtnar.ly an officer is detailed by
the military authorities at Washington to
take command of the post without con
sulting the likes and dislikes of the
students, but this time matters have
changed, as may be seen from the follow
ing extract from a letter written by Regent
Reinstein to the students:
My attention has been called to the fact that
a friendly feeling between the students of the
university and the comnumlant oi the cadets
might tend to Increase the efficiency of the
miliiary instruction. A cordial relation be
tween the commandant and students seems to
be a strong factor In the selection of such an
efflcer. Tne question of naniing the fuccessor
to the present officer hag come up for consid
eration be:ore tne regents.
I call your attention to the fact that his
selection was referred to the committee on in
ternal administration ol the university, com
posed of Regent George T. Mnr.e, Ju ige
Charles W. Black, Charie- K. Crocker and Sam
uei T. Black, wnich committee will report on
this matter probably at the meeting of the ro-
Kunts on the second Tuesday in March at
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. The report of
the committee will probably be prepared at
(some considerable time pr:or to the ineeetinjr,
ana such report if unanimous will have great
weight and probably will carry with the
board of regents.
If you tnink, as it seems to me, that a
friendly feeling on the part of the stu
dents toward the military instructor would
tend to increase the efficiency of that depart
ment ol the university, and if there be any
considerab.e sentiment on the part of the stu
dents in favor of any one applicant for the
position of military instructor, 1 would suÂ«
gest 10 you that such g-neral sentiment of the
students, if it should exist, should be brought
to the attention of this committee on internal
adm.nisirntion, as the memberaof that com
mittee will ?ive ciireful consideration to every
factor nnd matter which will have a tendency
to benefit the university.
Of the candidates out for the place
Lieutenant Cloman seems to be the most
favored.

DIRECT LINE TO OAKLAND
Commission Men Intend to Run
River Steamers This
Season.
Conference With Steamboat Man
agers, Who Are Inclined to
Indorse the Projicf.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 2. j
The scheme by which Oaklanders will
be able to purchase ail kinds of produce
at prices below those now charged took a
big advance to-day. An outline of the
expected change was puolisbrd in The
Call yesterday morning, and to-day there
was a meeting of ail those interested to es
tablish a direct line of river steamers to
this city.
Messrs. Manuel and Rouse, two of the
laiyf-st local commission dealers, hjld n
conference this afternoon with river
steamboat men of San Francisco, the re
sult of which will be that Captain Ander
Â«on of the California Transportation Com
pany will either run a boat to Oakland di
rect in the near future or else Oakland
dealers will charter or build a steamer for
tbem-e ye*.
The ci.ference was held with H. J. Cor
coran, representing the California Naviga
tion and Improvement Company, and
Captain Anderson ol the California Trans
portation Company. Both of these com
panies have a fleet of small steamers and
transport large quantities of produce
between Sacramento, buisun Bay and San
Francisco.
This is the same district that supplies
the Oakland market with produce, but
hitherto it has always had to come to this
side of the bay through San Francisco
houses.
Messr?. Manuel and Rouse produced
maps and statistics to show the extent of
the produce trade in this city, with the
oLjeot of convincing the steamboat men
that it would pay to run a line of special
boats direct to Oakland. The dealers
made a good showing. They proved that
the 100,000 people on this side of the bay
use 1000 sacks of potatoes a day the year
around.
On the 8 a. M boat every day there comes
over from San Francisco an average of 100
tons o[ freight for Oakland commission
houses. In the canning season the ship
ments to the large canneries in this ciiy
sometimes amount to 300 tons a day.
The steamboat companies' representa
tives think their steamers are too large for
the trade, as they are about 600 tons ca
pacity. Captain Anderson took all the
figures submitted and nromiÂ«ed a definite
answer at an early day. If he should
decline to run a line of boats to Oakland
it is proposed to organize a local company
and charter or build boats. Calculations
that in the busy season, lasting
five months, a daily boat would be
required, and. at other times a boat
every second day. Tijis would enable
Oakland dealers to ship potatoes as eh ap
as Sacrnmento dealers, or a little cheaper.
Ono firm in this city frequently handles
six or eight carloads of potatoes a day.
Tnis change in steamboat traffic will
also cause a etiange in the location of the
commission-houses. They will establish
themselves on the Adams wharf property,
where they will have a warehouse, rail
road side tracks and ample facilities for
business.
It has been calculated that when Oak
land dealers buy Iruit and vegetables on
Jacuson-street wharf in San Francisco
seven different handling 1 , are required to
lay them down in this city, and the
freight across the bay costs as much as the
frei ht from the grower to San Francisco.
A local dealer said to-day that cante
loupes often sell In San Francisco for 25
cents per crate of 160 pounds. To get that
freight to Oakland costs 20 cents and here
the commission-dealer adds 5 cents, mak
ing a total of 50 cents to the local retailer.
When the new plan is in operation the
retailer will have to pay only the original
25 cents per crate. There are other lines
of produce in which it id said the differ
ence is as great.
The Munhall Meetingt.
ALAMEDA, ial., March 2 âThe Man
hall meetings are being largely attended,
an I great inter-st is evinced in the work
of the noted revivalist. The nail in which
the gatherings are held is crowded to its
fullest capacity at each meeting, and,
while few conversions have yet been an
nounced, ibe revivalist and his co-workers
of the clergy and laity are confident tnat
a good harvest of souls will be garnered.
Kraulh's Report.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 2.â The an
nual report of Chief Engineer Krauth
shows that during the year beginning
with March 4, 189G, ther* were forty-one
tires, with ft totÂ«i loss of $6826, and with
one fatality. Several recommendations
are made for improvements in equipment,
which will probably be carried out. The
high state of eifi iency of the department
is shown by the tire record given.
Bonds Redeemed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 2.â The City
Treasurer to-day redeemed municipal
bonds to the amount of $5215 60, the same

FUNDS FOR WORK
SLOWLY COMING
Unemployed Fare Poorly
and Hcp3 U Still
Deferred.
Their Talent Preparing a
Variety Benefit ior Next
Monday.
Pitiful Cases of D stHu'ionâCollec
tion Committees N.w All
Appciated.
Hope deferred is aptly exemplified in
the unfortunate condition of the small
army of tbe unemployed. Subscriptions
for work upon the proposed boulevard
are coming in slowly, and in the mean
time the sloppy, disagreeable weather
renders immediate relief more difficult for
the meu themselves to obtain by a sys
tem of dismal street parading with a
wagon in tow for contributions of any sort,
from provisions to old clothing.
There is at the headquarters only enough
food to last until this noon. Pitiful pleas
are daily coming in to the headquarters
irorn families in dire distress, and the well
men are sharing lhe meager supplies in
their commis3ary to alleviate the suffering
uf women and little children. Of the cases
reported and found deserving yesterday
was a family living at 933b Jackson street,
a woman and three httie cnildren in abeo
lute destitution. Their rent is long over
due. One of the children is sick to ti e
p oint of death. There is no fuel, no food,
no money in the house.
Their most Dressing needs were admin
istered to late yesterday, but unless
the child recuperates sufficiently to be
moved into tbe country a physician says
death will surely ensue and tiie cost of
burial will fall upon the City. The chil
dren's grandmother l.yes in the country
and an effort will be made through Mayor
Phelan to have transportation paid by the
C:tv, if for no more worthy reason than it
would be little more than equivalent to
certain funeral ex; ens^s.
To be sure. $2540 50 has already bef>n
subscribed to me worÂ«. fund for a valuable
City improvementâ not simply to feed
half-starved unfortunate men. But that
in itself would not keep 1000 of the unem
ployed ai worn longer than about two
days. The collection committees just or
ganized have not had an opportunity yet
to show what a material additiou may be
made to toe fund through their energetic
canvassing of different districts of the
City.
The theaters and the bicycle clubs are
to be appealed to by the citizens' com
mittee to get up benefits in order to swell
tne fund, and in all probability they will
gladly respond.
Next Monday night the actorand special
talent among the unemployed will give a
benefit entertainment at the Auditorium.
The affair is in the charge of an experi
enced theatrical manasrer, and tie decares
that he lias 100 unemployed men to choose
from.
At headquarters there was some talk
yesterday ot issuing an unemployed paper
to be sold by the men. It would bÂ« called
Hani Times, and would be printed sig
nificantly upon coarae yellow butchers'
paper. â â ;â â¢â â¢-}'â '':': -'V-'-" 1
The outgoing whaling and salmon fleet,
bound for Alaskan waters, promises era
ployment to many hundred men, and the
departure of the different vessels with
these men will naturally relieve the con
gestion in the labor market. These men
are not offered any definite financial
reward, but will get board and lodging
and a special rate on what they catch.
The commissary at the Howard-street
quarters received several additions yester
uay of food and clothing, but on account
of the wea;her the wagon was not taken
out.
Mrs. Theodore M. Lilienthal sent three
new suits of boys' clothing and some
clothing for women. Jimmy McCord,
a>:ed 6 years, 26 McAllister street, con
tributed some beading and women's and
children's clotbine. A lady sent a big
basket of sandwiches and hani-boiled
eggs. Another unknown friend had a
special â  rder of forty loaves of bread
baked for the unemployed. Katz & Sons
ol the California Market sent 100 pounds
of pickled pigs' lieads. Clothing was also
sent ia by Johnson & Fulton of 420 Bat
tery street, by Mrs. R. P. Hooeof the Hotel
Savoy and by Mrs. Thrasher of -.he Mur
phy building.
O;ib of the greatest needs in the way of
old clothing is underwear. Many of the
men have not changed their underclothes
in over a month, and the absence of bath
ing facilities adds to the unfortunate
physical condition of these hundreds of
men.
A short meeting was held in the fore
noon and another in the afternoon yester
day in the Chamber of Commerce, at
which several of the representative com*
mitteemen assembled to hasten the work
of collecting funds, and Edward M.
Greene, the Deputy Labor Commissioner
assigned by Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald to assist in the unemployed move
ment, began his duties as assistant secre-
tary.
It was decided that Assistant Secretary
Greene should be at headquarters in
Chamber of Cora mere * Hall every day
from 10 to 12 and Ito 3. During the day,
however, he will visit and con.er with the
different collection committees in order to
ascertain just how the work is progress
ing.
Provision was made for letterheads and
other stationery necessary to the work.
Everything was arranged systematically,
ana afier to- ay t lie committee will go
ahead with perfect system.
A general committee on subscriptions
was appointed, consisting of William M.
Bunker, chairman; Clans Spreckels, H. J.
Crocser and Lipmann Sachs.
It is probable that to-morrow tne Street
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
will go tnrougn the necessary formality of
approving the rights of way (or the boule
vard. Most of these privileges have al
ready been obtained.

be still in the iand of the iiving. Any one
having information as to his whereabouts
is requested to send the same to the Enci
nal ol&ce.

no one shoul ! be appointed who was op
posed to any candidate on the ticket. But
tuere are ihree candidate* who are so un
fortunate as to have incurred considerable
opposition, and hence the difficulty of ob
taining comniitteemen who shall come
within the inhibition.

band and w fe died together complicated
le^al problema aiose at once, for the hus
band had left all the rropertv to the wife
by a deed of Rift and she hud willed it all
to him.
The woman's heirs, about twenty in
number, have been claiming the ;,roperty
on the legal presumption that as tne
husband was older than the wife he died
first, while Howard's luirs claimed thnt
as he was the stronger he s-urvived and
that the properly was his at death.
"We have about decided to compromise
the case, each side taking half," said
Oscar T. S uck yesterday. He is attorney
for the heirs of Mrs Howarl.
During the controversy it has come to

Judge in Coos Count >', Oretton. Ha ha I

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a

times worse than the most severe pain. Thera
is no let up to the mental snfforin? day or
night. Sleep is almost possible, and under
â uch a strain men are scarcely responsible for
whi\t they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed ou the troubled sen of sexual weakness

came to his aid in thu shape of a combination
cf medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will ta-ke
the trouble to tend bis name and aidress may

The suit of Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinck
ley against ihe lawyers and other* en
gaircd and intÂ«rested in the Blythe es ate
litigation has been assigned to JuJpe
Seawell of the Superior Court for trial. It
is intended by this action to determine
the rights of the different parties mat
have figured in the case.
Briefly stated, Mrs Hinckley seeks to
have a settlement of tbe claims held by
others against the $4,000,000 estate which
she inherited fiom her lather, Thomas H.
Blythe. That it is in some degree a
friendly suit is apparent trora tlie fact
that her attorneys are W. H. H. Hart and
Aylett R. Colton, while W. H. H. Hart is
the first defendant named in tbe com
plaint. Following is the list of defend
anis:
William H. 11. Hart, Thomas I. Bergin, Kate
C. Byr.e (lormerly Kate C. Perry), Jonn E.

B. P. Young (as receiver of ihe California Na
tional Bank of San Francisco), T K. Stateler
(he agent ol said bank), Harry N. Morse (ss ad
ministrator of the estate ot George P. Goff),
Max milirtn Herzog, Isaac Strassburger and
Frank McGown.
Quite a number of the defendants here
in named are creditors of Attorney Hart,
having loaned him money in different
bums, the payment of which v.as secured
by liens on Mr. Hart's one-eighth interest
in the estate. Ihe creditors are:
Louis P. Drexler, $60,000; George E. Bates,
$22,500; L. I. Fish. $S<.;t>s 11; Caroline A.
Towne. s-^1,000; Elizabeth A. Rodgers,
$82,210 73.
To Messrs. Garber, Boalt, Bishop and
Foote Mrs. Hinckley has already trans
lerred one-li:tieth each of the property
known as the Blytlie block, and she does
noi dispuio their title in tnis regard.
Emma Joset-h holds a mortage on the
property for $49,000, Thomas I. Berein has
claims amounting to $6ti,179 54 and John
D. Eaton demands $25,000
The claims of the iate Hall McAllister
and of bis representatives, as well us tne
claims of Thomas I. Berlin, are resisted
by Mrs. Hinckley on the ground that when
she signed the contracts to pay them 1%
per cent of all property awarded to her
she wasyoung and inexperienced, and was
led by her euardiau to believe that she
â was legally obliged to do so; fur. her, that
she had no independent advice in regard
to the same. She alleges that McAllister
and Bergin fai ed to perform the eervlces
they agreed to periorm, and she objects to
paying their claim.
Touching the compensation (or her
guardians, the late Jarues Crisp Perry and
Kaie C. I\>rry (now Mrs. Byrne), it is ad
mitted by Mrs. Hinckley that sue agreed
to pay them 10 per cent of all properly
recovered by her, and she insists that this
shall be considered in lull for all the ser
vices of her cuardians. She says shÂ» has
paid Mrs. Byrne (former: v Mrs. Perry)
$19,450.
Several of the defendants named pre
tend to hold interests in the Blvthe estate
obtained under and through Mrs. Byrne.
Mr. Perry was her grandfather and Mrs.
Perry was her grandfather's second wile.
MrÂ«. HincKley says that when she signed
the second contract agreeing to pay Mrs.
Perry-Byrne additional compensation she
did so under a misapprehension of her
rights. She thinks the original 10 per
cent is encugh for Mrs. Byrne.
Mrs. Hinckley admits that on Marcti 8,
1892, Henry I. Kowalsky obtained from
ncr a writing by which she agreed to
transfer to him 2 per cent or nne-fineieth
of all property recovered by her from the
estate of Thomas H. Blythe. Since then
she has paid him $8165 95 and has accepted
an order fr'im him in lavor of Joseph E.
Shaw for $2750. She has also received
notice that Mr. Kowalsky has transferred
10 per cent of his oi'e-fiitieth share to J.
H. Mahoney. There are otl.er creditors
of Mr. Kowalsky who are included in the
list of defendants in order that their rights
may be adjudicau-d.
The interest of \V. F. Goad in the mat
ter is represented by a loan of $10,000 to
Mr. Hart. The claim oi George P. Goff
ebe repudiates altogether.
In conclusion, Mrs. Hinckley represents
to tne court that the real estate sought to
be partitioned is susceptible of being di
vided and partitioned to the persona who
own interests therein, and she asks ior an
order of court making such partition in
such a manner that the share to which
she is entitled shall be set apart in one
body.
An early hearing of the suit will be
asked for by Mrs. Hinckley and all others
interested in the matter. Only four con
tested claims appear in tl>e record, and it
is thought that a decision m y be reached
in regard to the undisputed claims, and a
division of a portion of ihe Biythe block I
will be effected as to such claim.ints. The
other matters will be left lor subsequent
litigation.

riRST-AVENUi: BOULEVARD.
This Important Thoronghfare Will Be
Graded and Bituininized.
The Richmond people witb but few ex
ceptions are deiighted over tne prospect
of getting First avenue, from the military
reservation to the Golden Gate Park, paved
wi:h bitumen.
It is the wish of the residents of tbis
favored section to have this thoroughfare
declared a boulevard as soon as it is put
in proper cond.tion. To that end there is
a petition now before tbe Supervisors to
lop off three feet from each of the s.de
walks, which will be added to the width
of the street, thereby leaving the walks
seventeen feet wide, which is considered
airmle for present and iuture use.
This beautiful boulevard will, when
complete, make a continuous driveway
not only from the Pre.i;dio, but the en
tire northern district, to and through the
park. In addition to this booii the south
ern boulevard on Seventh avenue, which
has been graded by Captain John Tuttle
as far us M street, will lead direct to
Ingleside race cour.ie. A portion of this
avenue still remains to be graded, . but
from present ca'cuations this work will
soon be done, as it is contemplated to put
tne unemployed men who now desire
work on the job.
The opposition of a few of tie property
owners to tne improving of First avenue
has been overcome by ihe urgent neces
sity of repairing this, one of tha most
im'oortant outlets to tbe R.ci>mond.
The Presidio Heights Improvement
Club has been urging the grading and
paving of First avenne fer n number of
years, but the last Board of Supervisors
turned a deaf ear to its wishes in tnat di
rection. But now the members of the
club, togeiher with the Point Lobos Club,
congratulate themselves on getting what
they have been contending for.

Embezzler Me t Joy Gors Kast.
Charles B. McCloy, who gave himself up to
the police some days ago as an embezzler from
Bay City, Mich., left last night for the scene
of his crime in custody of Deputy United
States Marshal Mollit. McCloy will be tried in
the United States District Court for Eastern
Michigan. The Second National Bank of Bay
City, from which McCioy admits he stole
$8000, will be the prosecutor.

AMONG THE
WORKMEN
Legislators Censured for
Failing to Pass Labor
Bills.
BARBERS APPRECIATE
"THE CALL."
The Examiner Detected Playing
the Part of a Yellow
Dog.
UNION CIGAR-MAKERS NOW AT |
CULFS.
Large Increase in the Membership of
the Amalgamated Woodworkers'
Organization.
The Call has received many requests
from readers who are members of labor
unions to publish a serie* ol resolutions
adopted last Thursday nieht at a meeting
of the labor convention in Metropolitan
Hall. These resolutions, which were unÂ» j
avoidably omitted from last Friday's issue j
of the paper, are the following:
Whkreas, Recent acts of our legislators have
plainly shown that they *re not in the spirit
ot fair.iess toward the labor laws indorsed and
Â£ resented by and in the name of the California
aboi Convention, with the exception of some
<â ! the less important ones; and whereas, it is
clearly apparent that a determined disposi
tion to det.'at nearly all proposed laws ior the
penetit of labor i:i a majority of instances,
mid to prove dere:ict to the trusts Imposed in
our representatives jo far as the cause of labor
In the maiD is concerned and has manifestly
asserted itself in various ways at Sacramento;
th< reiore be it
;.'Â».->.â¢', That we deprecate these facts in
the strongest possible manner ar.d demand of
legislators ihnt tuey support and pass the
labor laws now in a way ot practical defeat at
their hands, ami to do so without alterations
and amendments that will render them uugÃ
t >ry and of DO avail to the .nuse of labor,
under pain of our unceasing efforts to defeat
all who are in tho^e matters lound wantim. 1 .
Rcsnirfd. That this applies to men of all
political fuiths, individually and collectively,
ad will be in all legitimate ways adhered 10
and cirried Into practical e fleet at the polls
irom the standpoint of unionism.
Bao'ved, That we deprecate all subterfuges
indu.ged in b* any one acting for the people
in any capacity, and do by these articles p.ace
the stamp of our disapproval on all efforts :o
protect the questions! ways of those who are
elected or appointed to offices o; emolument,
â trust or profit, and as union men and citizens
we will assert our influence to the cad that
ali of these and kindred things be discounte
nanced.
The very small man employed by
Multi-millionaire Hearst to run his very |
small paper caught at the omission or '
these resolutions from The Call as a fam- ;
ishine hound catches at a bone. They I
saw in it a means whereby they might in- :
jure a successful rival. Forgetting the !
hundreds of printers cast upon the street j
through the avarice of their employer, I
they begin to denounce The Call as an i
enemy of labor, an old game they have I
oiten- tried since Mr. Hearst sought to j
convince the farmers of California that
what they really needed was more Chinese
coolies. It was the thief crying stop thief
over auain.
[â¦ was the millionaire monopolist of th
pres= groveling in the gutter to besmirch
the fair name of a journal that he has
tried in vain to ruin.
Resolutions condemning The Call were
written in the office on Mission street,
where Wyatt Earp sat as editor, and were
mailed to the unions that met last night.
' ' A reporter, keenly alive to the humili
ation of his position, was sent to each of
the unions to beg ttiat the resolutions sent
by l-.is superiors should be adopted. Some
of these bodies may have granted his re
quest, but others, to their credit be it said,
refnsed to gratify the malicious aims of
the Examiner and sent the unfortunate
reporter away empty-handed.
THE CIGAR-MAKERS.
Union Hands Secure Work at the
San Felipe Factory.
The International Cigar-mak rs' Union
No. 228 held its regular monthly meeting
last evening, and the report was made
that the union cigar- makers are meeting
with success at Mr. Culp's Ban Felipe fac
tory. Already fourteen men hava been
et g.t^ed, and it is expected that more will
be lafce-n on there within a few days.
The Examiner's representative was pres
Lite Georgie Powell, for Whom a Gcod Home Is Wanted,
Out at the Women's Federation Home of Refuge for Destitute Women and
Children, at 100 Golden Gate avenue, is a dear little baby boy. He is only 2
weeks old, but already tl>e thought of giving him up has forced itself on his
mother. She loves her baby dearly, but she is a delicate little woman, and the
struggle of living lias been a hard one for her. "If I couid only get him a good
home, where he would be well taken care of and I could see him occasionally I
would like it. It is so hard for a woman with a baby to get work. I might get a
place where he couid be takÂ»n care of, but, poor little fellow, they mi^ht not be
kind to him and I couldn't bear that. Isn't he bneht for his age?"
He is remarkably bncht and pretty, too, with bright blue eyes that gaze so
steadfastly into the future. His hair is dark and there is lots of it, too. He is a
well-mannered little chap who never cries, but sleeps teacefully wholly uncon
scious of the fact that in a few days he may belong to some one else.
Abont three months ago his father was killed in a mine, leaving his mother
destitute and in want. George was born at the County Hospital, but as soon as
the mother was able to be moved she was taken the the Home of Refuge t where
tbe matron, Misb Phoebe Waters, a motherly looking woman, has been taking
care of her.
ent in the an;e-room and made an inef
fectual effort to have the organization
pass resolutions already prepared and
carried id stuck by that paper condemning
The Call as unfriendly to the worKing
classes.
The secretary stated that the union
would not consider such a proposition for
a minute.
'Ihe Call in the past has been friendly
and fair in its reports of union matters,
ana mo far there was no reason for sup
posing that it had changed its attitude
toward those who earned their living by
t-'oir hanus. Moreover, nny grievance
that the union would consider would have
to come through the regular channel â the
central body.
He further said that the misunder
standing of several labor unions had been
fully explained by the knowledge that
some resolutions had been unavoidably
crowded out ana only the gist of them bad
appeared.
The ready-made resolution failed to
pass.
"THE CALL" PRAISED.
Its Policy Toward Organized Labor
Just Suits the Barbers' Union.
At last night's meetinc of the barbers'
union In A. O. F. Hall The Call came in
for many warm expressions of sympathy
and regard. It was, in fact, termed "the
only friend the barbers had among all the
metropolitan dailies."
Tne discussjon started with an informal
reference to the advantages that would
accrue to the unemployed in this City if
the new Postolfice building should be
begun in the near future. In speaking of
the matter President J. A. Lorentzou s:iid :
"i think, gentlemen, it is about time
the construction of the new Postoffice
building began. Things have been
dragging too long, as it is. Many men are
in the utmost need of work at the present
time, and it is the duty of the Government
to give them a chance to do something at
once.
"San Francisco needs a P ostoffice more
than any City 1 know of and deserves it
at that. I thinK our representatives in
Washington should do something to see
that it is done.
The Call has ceeu urging the matter
very vigorously here lately, and I bope its
efforts wiil be rewarded by success. 'While
I am at it I want 10 say right here that
The Call, no matter what may be jeal
ously said, is the true friend of the work
ingman, and if the new postoffice is started
here pretty soon the unemployed hungry
masses will have that paper alone to
thank jor it."
I. Less, corresponding and financial
secretary, spoke in the same strain. At
the conclusion of h:s remarks on the sub
ject of iho Postolfice he made a motio-i to
the effect tnat the union indorse The
Call in its action toward organized labor.
In speakins to tiie motion he said:
"The Call lias always stood by the bar
bers. When we organized it had almo-t a
column in about it, whi c theother papers
merely mentioned the fact.
"When we made our light for the 12
o'clock closing bill, The Call took up our
cause, and Mr. -Shortri ige had two men
in Sacramento giving their entire time
and energy to helping u< out.
"The barbers owe much to 'i he Call
and its proprietor, and should stand oy
them when any shafts of malice, pro
pelled by jealousy and envy, are hurled in
its direction."
F. Hodges, the recording secretary, also
made a strong speech indorsing The
Call's policy in all matters relating to the
iabnr question.
"The Call," he said, "has sent repre
sentauves to report our meetings when
we were entirely ignored by the other
papers. That paper has done more for us
than all the rest put together. I do not
believe The Call has ever done a single
PRINTERS SPEAK FOR THE CALL.
The resolutions adopted by the Typographical Union at its meeting January 22 have been
published in the Pacific Union Printer, the official journal of the unftn. The resolutions In
no ucceratin terms condemn the resolutions passed by a sc-cailed mass-meeting as being
vituperative and an attempt to serve a muster hand, and the union protests against and con
demns any such attempt to injure the San Francisco Call. In conclusion a high compliment
Is paid to the proprietor of The Call. The resolutions are as follows:
Whereas, At a meeting of the working men and women recently held in the Turk
street Temple to consider certain measures pertaining to the interests of labor now
pending before the Legislature, resolutions were presented and adopted condemning
the San Francisco Call that savored more of temper and spite than deliberation; and
whereas, said resolutions were so printed in conjunction witn a report of the State
Labor Convention as to mislead the public into believing that that body was a party
thereto; ana whereas, this union deprecates any covert effort on the part of ar.y body
of working men and women to injure the business of the employers of our members
for no other reason than because they are generous enough to give space to those
having wrongs to rig t or arguments pro and con to present on measures of public
importance: and whereas, said mass-meeting of working men and women, led by one
evide ntly having an ol j< ct cf his own or a mission to perform, nas had the hardihood
and effrontery to propose resolutions condemnatory to the San Francisco Call as an
enemy of labor; therefore be it
Resolved, That San Francisco Typographical Union No. 21 only sees vituperation
and an attempt to serve a master hand in the resolutions passed by said mass-meetine
of working men and women, and with which neither the State Lahor Convention nor
Labor Council had any connection; and
Resolved That we earnestly and publicly protest against the spirit of said mass
; meeiing that suggested the placarding of Kan Francibco with an appeal to injure the
I said San Francisco Call; and
Resolved, That this union condemns any and all attempts to boycott or otherwise
injure any newspaper under the jurisdiction of Ban Francisco Typographical Union
for personal interests or political advancement; and
Resolved, That we publicly proclaim, from the standpoint of close business rela
tions, that the proprietor of the San Francisco Call is not only just, and a large em
ployer of our members, but is all that could be desired as an *>ninloyer.

"The Examiner ib also a little off in its
attitude toward the streetcar men. They
get paid by the hour, and if there was any
shortening of their hours of lalor they
would make hardly anything. I know
what I am talking "about, because I have
many friends in the employ of the local

THE WOODWORKERS.
j A Large Increase in the Member
ship In tho Past Five WeeKs.
The Amalgamated Woodworkers' Union
met last evening at 1159 Mission street
and several new members were initiated.
For the past five or six weeks this has
been one of the pleasing tasks of the offi
cers, for new members have been coming
in at the rate of from one to half a dozen
a night.
This condition of affairs has been
Drought about by ths efforts of the union
to improve the condition of the working
men of the craft, w: ich comprise furni
ture-workers, sash and door workers, etc.
The first business brought up last even
ing was the consideration of a resolution
presented by a representative of the Â£x
' aminer, who in tho interest of his paper
I sought to have the members of the union
j condemn The Call as being unfriendly to
â¢â  the laboring classes.
The president politely replied that the
; members of the union had not informed
j themselves as to the merits of the case,
j and thereiore would not take any action
jin the premises. The union would not
hesitate to go on record where any wrong
I had been intended, but it would not take
j up anything witii which it is not familiar.
The ready made resolution did not pass.

THE INFANT SHELTER.
Officers Elected for the Knxulng Tear.
Improvements That Are Couteia
j>i itt-il at the Home.
The annual meeting of the Little Sis
ters' Infant Shelter was held yesterday
afternoon at 512 Minna street.
Mrs. M. L. Cooper, the president, in her
report gave a history of the shelter, which
was started twenty-three years ago. She
expressed regret that those who con
tribute to maintain the shelter do not
visit i lie institution to see for themselves
how their money i* spent. The presi
dent had many kind words to say for Mrs.
J. Cunningham, the matron, and Miss
Josio H. Kentley, the kindergarten
teacher.
From the reports of Mrs. G. F. Richard
son, recording secretary, Mrs. W. D. Fin
nemore, treasurer, and other officials it
appeared that during the year there were
four deaths in the shelter; that there had
bc-en quite a number of cases ol measles,
but ail had recovered; that tne old
wooden bedsteads had been replaced by
iron cribs and new bed-clothing furnished ;
that the directors had compromised with
tbe executors of the Washington M.
lieyer estate, accepting $15,000, which was
a great deal less than was expected, but
preferable to litigating for yearn with a
possibiity of not getting anything nt all ;
that $500 had been ''donated by one
whose name must not be divulired"; $100
had been received from the Fourth of
July committee and $150 from an athlstic
entertainment given for charity; that
there are now thirty-three permanent
boarders in the shelter and twenty-two
day-boarders.
The following-named ladies were elected
directors for the ensuing year: Mrs M.
L. Cooper, Mrs. T. G. Taylor, Mrs. J. A.
Sampson, Mrs. G. F. Richardson, Mrs. W.
D. Finnemore, Airs. J. M. Pierce, Mrs.
Rebecca Fisher, Mrs. J. A. Margo and
Mrs. D. F. Leary. Notice was given to
amend the by-laws so as to increase the
number of directors to eleven.
The directors then elected the following
officer*: Mrs. hi. L. Cooper, president;
Mrs. T. G. Ta>lor, vice-president; Mrs. G.
P. Richardson, recording secretary; Mrs.
J. M. Pierce, corresponding secretary, and
Mrs. W. D. Finneniore, treasurer.
Tne directors have tinder consideration
a proposition to make a number of altera
tions in the buildine now occupied as the
-in her, and make the place better suited
to the needs of the organization.

TO BUILD
THIS YEAR
Many Structures Are Under
Way and Workmen
Re j oice.
MARCH IS A RAINBOW
OF PROMISE.
Prospects for the Unemployed
Are Brighter Than They
Have Been.
PLENTY OF WOBK AHEAD FOR
BUILDEBS.
Many Public and Private Structures
Are to Be Completel During the
Present YeÂ» â¢
Prospects for those engaged in ihe build
iDg trades have been be;ter so far this
year than for four or five seasons. Those
who have studied the situation closely
feel quite encouraged, for, in addition to
the vast amount of building now under
way, many contracts are let and the work
is practically all ready to begiu.
Though times are hard and people com
plain, it is encouraging that them has
seldom been a month in San Francisco
where prospects were better for carpenters,
brick and iron rnoiders than now, for
there are many large contracts about to be
begun, and each will give employment to
a large number of men.
Vice-President Butcher of the Bailders'
Exchange is hopeful of the outlook in the
building trades and believes that skilled
workmen have a batter opportunity now
than for some years owing to the activity
of capital in the building trades. From
his point of view there is every reason to
be nopeful and there are prospects that
many of the unskilled unemployed will
benefit by the present tendencies of
capital.
"There are many private and public
buildings under way now," said Mr.
Butcher yesterday, "and the prospect is
that within a month several hundred or
even a thousand men may find lucrative
employment in these lines of industry."
The new buildings proposed are dis
tributed throughout the City in business
as well as residence portions. Besides the
construction of new buildings there is a
great deal of remodeling.
Speaking of the matter yesterday John
Mauritzen said: "Everywhere Igo there
are signs of activity, but of course I am
delighted to see ttiat work has begun on
the Hali of Justice, on the site of the old
City Hall. This work is sure to prove a
benetit to all the north end of town. Men
who visit my place speak of it, and the
unemployed seem hapny at the prospect
of work for a season."
At the Builders' Exchange there is
much encouragement among the con
tractors, and they report a good feeling
among the laborers in general.
The Affiliated Colleges will give employ
ment to a large number of men and work
has already been begun there. The foun
dation for part of the structures is now
under way.
The ferry depot, though well under way,
will give employment to a large army of
men for many months to come.
A large corps of workmen will be em
ployed on the great Spreckels building for
many months, particularly on the interior
work and tine finishings.
There is no doubt that work on the new
Hall of Justice will go forward without in
terruption. Fully a hundred men will
find employment as nearly a third of a
million is to be pxpended.
The Mission High School will be a great
enterprise and will affoid employment for
a large army of men. Work on these will
'oon begin and those engaged will be busy
for a Jong time.
The City's great building for the destruc
tion of refuse will soon be under way. It
will cost more than $50,000. The brick
chimney will be 250 feet high.
At Menlo Park the Academy of the Sa
cred Heart will cost $1,000,000. The first
wing will cost $50,000 and work upon it
will be commenced in a few days.
The repairs on the Nucleus building will
cost a few thousand dollars. One or two
stories are to be addled to the present
structure. While the improvements are
to be cheap and limited their construc
tion will give work to several people.
The Hub clothing-store building is to be
renovated and repaired, and $30,000 ia to
be expended on the building at 428 Cali
fornia street. These improvements wili
give employment to about tifty men.
A $35,000 structure Is soon to be erected
at Jackson and Lsguna, while $40,000 is
to be expended on the Aronson building
on Geary above Calvary Church.
It will De seen from the foregoing that
there are good prospects for the unem
ployed in the building trades.

CITY TELEPHONE RATES.
Reduction Effected Which Is Estimated
at 82000 Per Annum in Gross
Mayor Phelan and Dr. Rottanzi, chair
man of the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors, conferred yesterday
afiernoon in the Mayor's oth3e with Johu
I. Sabin and Secretary Eaton concerning
the rates charged to the City and County
for telephones. The conference lasted
some time. The result, as announced at
the close of ihe deliberations, was that an
agreement was reached whereby the City
and County will pay a flat rate of $90 p^r
annum for each telephone in the new City
Hall and in the houses of City and County
officials, with free switching. There are
ninety-nine telephones in tne City offices
exclusive of the 209 employed in the po
lice patrol system. The old rate was $9 40
per telephone. Chaiiman Rottanzi figures
out that the saving is at least 27 per cent
and the gross saving to the City and
County is at least $2000 per annum. The
conference was brought abou; through Su
pervisor Rottanzi's suggestion that there
ought to be some definite understanding.
ALL TUGGING TO WIN.
Exciting Sport Nightly Proceed
ing at Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Last Night the Danish, Scotch, Cana
dian, American and Swedish
Teann Were Ah at.
The inclement weatber deterred many
lovers ot atnletic sport from attending the
third night of the international tug-of
war at Mechanics' Pavilion, but when tho
time arrived for the commencement of
tests of power and strength the naileries
were pretty well hi ed with ladies and
gentlemen and as time wore on the
audience grew larger.
The opening tug of the evening was be
tween the Norwegian and Danish teams.
The Danes sold favorites in the pools.
When the signal was given the Nor
wegians put their shoulders to the wheel
and sained a few inches. The Danish
anchorman was perfectly calm and
smiled blandly when the Norwegian team
gained a slight advantage.
Finally the Danisn captain gave the
siirnal to his men and with a strong pull
and a pull all xogether ihe Danes yanked
their opponents cleat over cleat and cap
tured the contest in 1 rmn. 38 sec. It was
an ea--y game for the Danes.
The "next event was a contest between
the Scotch and German teams, but the
members of the Scotch team protested
against their anchorman, Atkinson, whom
they accused of unsportsmanlike conduct
on Monday evening and refused to pull
with him at the anchor.
The matter was finally adjusted after
much argument by substituting Robert
Duncan in the place of Atkinson, who
was left out in the cold to think over what
he had done.
The Scotchmen were opposed by the
Germans, and at the start they gained a
foot in the first attempt, and without the
assistance of the celebrated Atkinson they
put their shoulders to the wheel and won
the puli in 1 minute and 59 seconds.
The Canadian and Italian teams were
the nejct to enter the contest, and in the
betting the Canucks sold strong f&yoritea
at 10 to 1, and at these figures the small
end was Jjard to find. The Canadians
simply toyed with their opponents, and
struggle as best the sons of Italy could
they lailed to hold their opponents, who
won the contest in 4 mm. 23 sec.
The United States and the Irish teams
appeared under their respective colors.
The betting was $10 to $3 in favor oi the
Americans, and the contestants took
matters easy so as to give the poolsellers
a chance lo take in any small eh inge the
bettors were disposed to wajrer on the re
sult. The American team having no great
opposition to contend with, easily defeated
their opponents in 1 mm. 31 sec.
The final contest of the evening was be
tween the Frencn and Swedish teams.
Thn French were favorites selling at $10
to $1 against their opponents. The strug
gle was short and spirited, and to the sur
prise of all the French won in 2 minutes
51 seconds.
St'MMARY OF EVENTS.
Denmark beat Norway 1 mm. 38 S"C
Scotland beat Ot rmany 1 mm. 6U sec
Canada bent Italy 4 mm. 123 sec.

J. il Harrison's Death.
The Supreme Court has sustained the lower
court of this City in a case where the heirs of
J. H. Harrison sued the Sutter-street Railroad
Company and the National Brewing Company
tor damages. Harrison was killed in a col
lision between a streetcar and a brewery
wacon of the two defendants and the widow
and daughters obtained a verdict of $8000.
Tne defendants asked for a new trial of the
case, on the ground that the damages were
excessive and the petition was granted.
The heirs appealed to the Sup erne Court to
have the order granting another trial set
aside. The Supreme Court sustained the lower
court, holding that the Superior Court did not
abuse its power in granting a new trial and
that the evidence as to Harrison's age did uot
show his ability to support his family, which
fact had much to do with the matter of dam
ages.

A Question of Title.
The judgment of the Alameda County Court
was affirmed by the Supreme Court yesterday
in the case oi Simon Ko.->hland and others
agaln-tF. S. and J. JR. Spring. The pluintills
agreed to purchase a piece of land from the
Springs and deposited $5000 pending an iv-
Yettlsation oi the title, which, the Springs as
serttd, was good and valid. An exiimiiiation
of the title did not satisfy the purchasers and
they demanded the return of their $5000 de
posit, which the Springs refused ;o rduru, de
claring thnt there was no cloud on the title.
Koshland brought suit for the recovery of the
deposit Htid won the action. F.oni tnis the
Springs appealed, but to no purpose, fur the
Supreme Court decided that tne verdict of the
lower court was just.

PORT TOWNSEND'S MISSING CRAFT.
Revenue Cutters Complete a Futile
Search for the Schooner
A i da.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 2.â j
Tbe continued absence of the schooner j
Aida from China for this port prompts the I
belief that the vessel has been wrecKed
and is now a derelict Moating aimlessly '
about in the open ocean. Such may be J
the case, but there is one thing certain â i
the vessel is nowhere in the vicinity of j
the Straits of Juan de Fuca. This has
been proven conclusively by the work of i
the revenue cutters Grant and Perry, both
of which, at tbe solicitation of the
Port Townsend Chamber of Commerce,
were sent by the Treasury Department to
search for the Aida.
Tb.* Perry maae a careful scrutiny of
the coast line down as far as the Colum
bia River, and then came back on a zigzag
course well out at sea. The Grant went
north to the upper end of Vancouver j
Island, searching the coast on the way up. j
From Cape Scctt the cutter began a voy- !
age which makes tho chart on which the I
courses were kept iootc .ike a spiderweb. 'â 
The vessels covered 1600 miles in this I
crisscross and circular steaming, well j
away from ihe beaten path of regular j
vessels. Stean: and sailing craft of all i
sizes and descriptions and from all points
of the compass were spoken, but none |
knew anything about the overdue
schooner. That something lias happened
to the pretty vessel, famed for qurck trips, j
in highly probable, but that the derelict |
or dismasted wreck is not anywhere j
within a radius of 400 miles of Cape Flat- !â 
tery, unless under water, can be an-
Lounced as a certainty.
