WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13.â The
Call correspondent met the new Secre
tary of Agriculture, Mr. Wil-on, at the
department tnis morning, and lie very
willingly entered into a discussion of the
duties of his new office. Secretary Wilson
showed by his conversation a homeiy
Knowledge of farm life, and displayed a
leonnicai knowledge of agricultural
scieace, embracing chemistry, pomology,
entomology, microscopy and vegetable
pathology, all of which are divisions of
the department over which he nas as
Â«=.umed control. Secretary Wilson talked
to Thk Call correspondent lor more than
an hour.
"You will understand," said he, "that
my first week in office has been fully oc
cupied, and when you ask me to tell Tui
Call's readers what the policy of this de
partment under my administration will
be I can only reply, in genera! terms, that
at first it is my ambition to encourage the
raising of the most remunerative farm
products, and second to rind a foreign
marcel for them. 1 shall try to remove
the disability now ex sting against our
meat exportations to Germany and other
European countries. Do you know that
butter-making and butter exportation
promises to be a great industry in the
United States?
"I see you are surprised; for, like many
others, you have read some poetical con
ceits about the milkmaids and dairy
farms of the old country. These old songs
appeal to our imagination, but I can de
stroy all of this sentimentality with one
blow when I say that there is not grass
enough in Europe to feed cows enough,
consequently not enough cows to make
the butter consumed over there."
The Secretary of Agriculture is the least
bit eccentric in his manner, and, afier
malting this declaration, struck bis desk a
resoundine whacfc with nis huge tint, and
Then, peerme beneath his palm, keenly
observed the newspaper interviewer to see
what effect bis statement would have.
His next statement was even more start
ling. Rising abruptly in his seat, he
asked, almost dramatically, "Do you
know that we are now importing millions
of dollars' wortk of sunstiine from Ger
many every year?" The Call correspond
ent confessed bis dense ig-norance, where
upon the new Secretary said:
"Well. I mean sugar. Sunshine makes
sugar. We have enough oi sunshine and
good soil in our own broad land. It has
been demonstrated that the suarar beet
SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE WILSON SAYS: "It is my ambition to encourage the raising
of the most remunerative farm products and to find a foreign market for them."
The San Francisco Call
thrives in the great corn belt. Now, we
not only propose to make all of the sugar
that we consume, but after the saccharine
matter has been extracted from the beet
vre intend to feed it to cowaâ why, my boy,
we can raise more suear beets and fatten
more cows and make more Rood butter
t han any country on earth. One of the '
first things I shall do will be to appoint 1
special agent? in Europe to investigate and
report on different flavors of butter now in
demand over t ere. You see we must con
sult I'he tastes of those people. The longer !
the butter is worked the longer it will
keep fresh in transportation. The more
it is worked the more buttermilk is
pressed from the fat; for buttermilk is
caseine, you know, tmd the bacteria feed
upon caieine."
Secretary Wilson then reverted to the
subject of distribution of sucar beet and
other seed, lie said that, as everybody
knows, this has been a vexed question
during the past four years, and Secretary
Morton has persistently opposed appro
priations for this purpose.
"Are we uoing to get our seed ?" is the in
terrogation of every member of Congress,
especially those from the agricultural sec
tions, to the new Secretary of Agricul
ture. This inquiry the Secretary in
variably answers in the affirmative. "Yes;
but under a different system, and one
which will, I hope, rtevcloD new indus
tries and a greater diversification of agri
cultural industries and agricultural prod
ucts."
Secretary Wilson is bringing to the
management of the Agricultural Depart
ment a happy combination of practical
experience as an agriculturist, a Congress
man and a scientist. His long years of
practical farming were followed by expe
rience in Congress, and since then a scien
tific study, combined with practical ex
perimentation, in his work as director of
the State Experiment Station of lowa,
In the few days in which he has been in
: charge of the Department of Agriculture
he nas set on foot a line of work which it
is believed will supply to the farmers of
the country, through the usual channels
of distribution by the members of Con
gress and the experiment stations, an en
tirely new application of the system of
seed distribution, and one intended not
only to diversify and increase the produc
tion of the farm, but to add largely to the
value of farm products and keep at home
i enormous sums of money which are now
! being sent abroad for agricultural prod
j nets, while at tne same time making a
market abroad for thÂ© produces of the
â¢ farms of the United States.
Mr. Wilson's experience as the head of
the experiment station of his own State,
in which he coupled practical farm expe
rience and intelligent scientiGc knowledge
of the value of the various kinds of agri
cultural productions, has resulted in a
j marked improvement in the value and di
versification in land products in lowa, and
plans which he has already outlined to
the members of Congress with whom he
has talked show to them that this intelli
gent system is to bt applied to the entire
agricultural area of the United States.
Corn, which in his own State brings no
more than 10 or 15 cents per bushel for ,
marketing, is in his opinion worth several
times more than that if properly fed, and
| he has already put on foot investigations
of the experiments made in this line in
the various States, especially with refer
ence to the utilization of these and other
farm products for feeding sheep, a system
througu which he be.ieves the agricul
tural products may prove more valuable
than in the past, especially by reason of
the difficulty farmers have had in procur
i ing other classes of food animais to which
â  to feed the enormous grain crops which
| this country has been producing during
i the past few years. But it is not along
| this line alone to which he is confining his
experiments and researches and plans.
In the distribution of the *eeds he is pre
paring to supply the farmers of the coun
try with the class of plants which have
proved especially valuable in other parts
of the world, and in experiments which
have been conducted in few of the States
of this country.
jfeople of the world now, Mr. Wilson
finds, are demanding nitrogenous food
I and not requiring such quantities of the
I class of food obtained from the fat-pro
i ducing grains which have sent American
lard all over the world, but for which the
demand has of late somewhat fallen off.
In other words, fats are less in demand,
and the nitrogenous products which fam-

the rights of American citizens everywhere.
ish the juicy steaks and palatable,
strength-producing chops and cutlets are
now more in demand. Leguminous
plants, which are deep-rooted and r\ch in
nitrogen, Japanese bean?, field peas and
DOd-bearine plants generally are found to
be more valuable, where they have
been tested in this and other countries,
and the, farmers of the country will find
their seed packages of an entirely differ
ent character in the future than those
Which they have been accustomed to re
ceire.
In the experiments made in toe State
of lowa during the past few years all the
world has been ransacked for classes of
nitrogen-producing plants with wnich to
supply the demand which the new order
of tilings in consumption of animal food
has created.
Field peas from Canada, Japanese beans
and clover from the Orient, a peculiar
clans of pod-bearing pian ts from the south,
and other products of various portions of
Europe, where these matters have been
carefully and scientifically studied have
all been brought into requisition in the
experiments made by him so successfully
that be is preparing to apply this informa
tion to such other sections of the country
as are likely to find i; useful. In the ex
periments which have been made in cer
tain of the agricultural stations, especially
that of lowa, it has been found that by a
combination of deep-rooted plants it is
practicable to furnish a succesion ot crops
which shall give from the opening of the
reason until snowtali a constant supply of
nitrogenous food for animals, which adds
ereatly to their value for food. It is in
the hope and expectation of applying
this system to the great stock-producing

THE AMERICAN POLICY.
RUSSIA'S
SCHEME IS
EXPOSED
It Is a Proposal to Maks Boso
Petrovitch Governor
of Crete.
READY TO FORCE GREECE
TO DISARM.
Kaiser William Also Anxious
to Resort to Extreme
Measures.
BUT THE -CONCERT" OF THE
POWERS IS FLED.
Russia, Germsny aud Austria May Be
Lett to Proceed Against Gre.ce
â¢ by Themselves.
BERLIN, Gkbmant, March 13.â Behind
the circular which Russia has sent to the
powers proposing that each of them send
2000 troops to Crete to occupy the island
and compel the withdrawal of the Greeks
is a proposal which has been communi
cated hire from Vienna and probably
sent to other governments that Boso
Petrovitch, an uncle ot Prince Nicholas of
Montenegro, be appointed Governor of
Crete with a guard composed of Monte
negrin troops sufficiently large to main
tain order in the island.
The understanding here is that Russia
wants the powers to present an ultimatum
to Greece within a week demanding a gen
eral disarmament of the Greeks and the
withdrawal of the Greek troops now in
Crete within seven days and notifying the
Greek Government that if the demands are
not complied with within the specified
time the powers will resort to coercive
measures to compel compliance without
further notice, and the suggested mixed
occupation of the island will become an
accomplished fact.
The Kaiser is understood to be favor
able to a resort to extreme measures, pro
vided that Russia will join in formulating
and presenting an ultimatum of the
character mentioned, and has refused to
take part in the English negotiations
upon the subject of presenting a collective
note in reply to Greece's reply to the
powers.
The attitnde of the Berlin Government
is that Germany's share in diplomatic
action in regard to Crete is ended, and if
there is to be no coercion the German
Government will not discuss the Greek
note at all.
Austria concurs with Germany in this
view of the matter, bat Italy and France
are Hesitating though the belief in Ger
man official quarters is that they will both
join the German-Russian- Austrian com
bination even if Eneland declines to do
bo. If the debates on the Greek situation
which will take place in the French Senate
and Chamber of Deputies on Monday'
should prevent Franc* from taking part
in the concert, Italy may hold aloof from
that time on.
In such a case the three imperial powers,
Russia, Germany and Austria, will pro
ceed against Greece by themselves. It is
the belief that the breaking up of ttie con
cert of the powers is imminent, that Rus
sia has brought forward Boso Petroyich
as a candidate for the governorship
of Crete, and the St. Petersburg
Government must certainly know that
Greece will never assent to his appoint
ment to the office, as it would forever
blast her hopes of acquiring Crete. So. far
as the ultimate fate of the island is con
cerned tbere has not been a single word
eiven oat by the diplomats conducting
the negotiations thai furnishes the slight
est indication of what the. end will be. In
any event it is known that neither trie
Czar nor the Kaiser will permit a plebi
scite or any other reference of the question
to a popular Vole of the Cretans.
LONDON, Eng., March 13.â Gleaning
opinions upon Lord Salisbury's Grseco-
Creian policy from all possible quarters, it
is discovered that the oalance of opinion
in the lobbies of the House of Commons,
in the leading London and provincial clubs
and in what diplomatic circles are accessi
blr, is decisively in bis lavor. Even among
the Radicals, who naturally contend that
the English Government mi^lu have taken
a better way to satisfy the prevalent feel
ing of the Greeks, it is admitted that Lord
Salisbury is acting with infinite tact and
prudence.
His own sentiments are known to be
more with Greece than Turkey, and if all
the difficulties he has had to meet and
continues to encounter were publicly
known be would get most credit for states
mansh p, which is at once Christian and
politic. His own and Mr. Curzon's
declarations in Parliament are necessarily
lacking in respect or sorue of the most im
portant diplomatic developments arising
since the Greco-Cretan situation became
acute.
The Cretan blue book disclosed negotia
tions only up to the end of September
ana many of tbe most vital matters on
which Lord Salisbury and the chiefs of
the European powers have been at issue
â ince then receive no official declaration.
The Foreign Office has, however, permitted
some part of the past and pending nego
tiations to transpire which lights some
hidden corners of the European "con
cert" policy, and if the British Gov
ernment could publish a blue book up
to date it would be shown mat Lord Salis
bury has been endeavoring to get the best
terms for Greece compatible with any pos
sible maintenance ot the so-called concert,
and that his main and most uncompro
mising opponent has been the German
Emperor.
Lord Salisbury desired that the Greek
troops shoulil uot be withdrawn from
Crete until the scheme of autonomy was
promulgated and partly acted upon, and
tnatthe withdrawal of the Turkish troops
shoulu be sim ultr.neous.
The Kaiser took the mii iative in insist
ing upon the Greek troops withdrawing
upon no pledge as to the abolition of the
Turkish regime or the retirement of the
Sultan's soldiers.
Lord Salisbury suggested that the
scheme of autonomy should include the
appointment of a Greek Prince â Prince
George or some other â as Governor of
Crete, with power to appoint his own
Council and conduct the administration,
and again on tue initiative of Germany
the .proposition baa been practically re
jected.
In official quarters here it is believed
that if the European powers can be got to
leave Greece to the tender mercies of the
Turk, ihe powers will form a ring around
Greece and let King Gaorge's small army
tight It out with the overwhelming forces
which the Porte can bring into the field.
The Liberal leaders in Parliament are
not ignorant of tbese facts and know that
they are paralyzed in attacking Lord
Salisbury on the ground that he lacks
sympatny with Greece. If they ventured
upon challenging his policy, a tentative
and prudent one, by a vote of censure,
they would fail to get the support of
many Liberal members and would stultify
themselves before tne country. A distinc
tive policy of their own is not even within
sight of the Liberal leaders.
If the Liberals were in power and threw
Great Britain on the si c of Greece, a
European war would follow in which
Eugland would have no allies. Even as it
is Lord Salisbury may soon be compelled
to openly denounce the powers' coercion
of Greece.
According to the St. James Gazette,
many Conservative* would approve a war
with Russia as a final arbitrament of the
Eastern question, including Greece.
BLOWN C\P WITH J>IX JJUITK.
Turkish Troop* Slain While Crotiing a
Railroad Bridqf.
ATHENS, Greece, March 13.â A dis
patch from Larissa, in Thessaly, says that
a railway bridge over the river Varduari,
near Salonica, Turkey, was blown up
while a train with 3000 Turkish troops on
board was crossing it. A large portion of
the bridge was completely wrecked. Sev
eral of the cars were overturned and fell
into the river. Many of their occupants
were unable to get out and perished before
assistance could be rendered them.
Other soldiers who managed to get free
from the cara were dragged down by the
weight of their accouterments and
drowned. It is not known how many lost
their lives, but it is reported that the
number is large. The transportation of
troops in the direction of tbe Greek fron
tier has been suspended pending tbe re
pair of tbe bridge. It is supposed that
the explosion was caused by Macedonian
malcontents.
Advices, from Canea show that the pil
laging of the houses of absent Christians
in that city is being continued: not by the
Turkish troops alone, but by the Turkish
municipal authorities, and despite the
fact that soldiers and marines from the
loreign warships landed ostensibly to
protect tbe town are still on duty no effort
has been made to stop the work of the
robbers.
In fact, more pillaging is going on in
the presence of the forces of the powers,
who have received no orders to check it.
Last night and to-day the municipal au
thorities went to the houses of Christians
who fled from the city, and opened them
under the pretext that they were to be
used as lodging places for some of the
many refugees who have reached Canea.
The real object of the officers, however,
was to steal anything they could lay
hands on.
They even took away the furniture and
household utensils, to say nothing of the
other more valuable property they found.
In some cases the houses were completely
dismantled.
LONDON". Eno., March 13.â A dispatch
from Constantinople says that fighting
has occurred near Gravcnna between a
number of Macedonian insurgents and a
body of Turkish troops. Details of the
tight are lacking.

If the success of the mass-meeting in

Metropolitan Temple on next Saturday
evening, is to be gauged by the earnest

that is arranging for it, then tbe big hall

The committee met at California Hali,
Bush and Powell streets, last evening and
within an hour completed arrangements
for the gathering.
Chairman Charles M. Shortridge got out
ot a sick bed to be present and called the
meeting to order.
"All that remains for the committee to

hearts of American citizens, and I am
sure we shall all be proud of the part we
have taken in the movement when on
next Saturday night Metropolitan Hall is
crowded beyond us capacity."
George T. Gaden stated that he had
learned all particulurs regarding the hall,
the music, bonfires, a wagon to parade the
streets on Saturday and other details.
He was> appointed treasurer of the or
ganization by the chairman and empow
ered to contract for all of the arrange-
ments and pay for them out of the assess
ments levied on the members of the com
mittee.
It was decided to call on each of tbe
members to contribute toward the fundjS,
and Secretary Jones was instructed to call
personally on as many as possible and col
lect their contributions.
The matter of finances having been dis
pose l 01, i he question of a cc airman for
the demonstration was taken up, and the
members were unanimous on the point
that it would be the proper thing to ap
point Mayor Phelan chairman. The ap
pointmenf was made by acclamation.
Vice-presidents were next taken up, and
it was decided to appoint a large number.
Chairman Shortridge was of tbe opinion
that they should be chosen from all walks
of life.
Bankers, merchants, the representatives
of trades unions and professional men
should be selected, that all migut be rep
resented and be given an opportunity to
show their sympathy with the struggling
patriots.
On motion of Mr. Highton, Charles M.
Shortridge and I. J. Truman were ap
pointed a committee to select those who
will occupy the platlorm.
It was decided to call a meeting of the
sub-committee on resolutions, which con
sists of Messrs. Henry E. Highton, Gavin
McNab, George T. Gaden, Rouert Ferral
and H. B. Masters, for next Wednesday at
2 o'clock at Mr. Highton's oflice. Tnis
body will prepare the measures that will
be presented to the mass-meeting.
The matter of speakers was canvassed
thoroughly, and it was found that W. S.
Barnes, Samuel M. Shortridge, W. W.
Foote, Colonel T. V. Eddy and W. H.
Jordan had promised members of the
committee on speakers to address the
gathering, and it was decided to address
each one a letter signed by the chairman,
requesting his Assistance in aiding the
cause.
The decorations of the Temple will no
doubt be pleasing to tnose who attend,
for they will be placed in position by fair
hands.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
members of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the
Cuban League to take chare* of this mat
ter, and both President Jones and Secre
tary Mascherini of that organization
promised to see that the ladies were per
suaded to undertake th â  work.
Mr. Mascberini invited all those present
to attend the meeting of the Cuban League
to-morrow evening at California Hall to
witness the presentation to the league by
. the Ladies' Auxiliary of a Cuban banner,
that will form one of the chief decorations
of the platform on the evening of the
mass- meeting. He asked some of the elo
quent speakers present to address the
league, and a number . promised to do so.
It was then decided to reserve a section
of the seats of the Temple on next Satur
day evening for the use. of the ladies of
ti.e auxiliary and their friends. All of
the other seats in the big temple will be
free to those who care to attend.
The list of Tic?- presidents will be made
public within a few days and a notice will
be sent to each one of the honor conferred.
A large number of invitations to promi
nent people will also be issued ' within a
short time. v â¢'>':"
Secretary Mascherini of the Cuban
League exhibited a letter received yester
day from Colonel Ethan Allen, president
of the Cuban League of America, which
shows how much the leaders of Cuba's
friends in America appreciate the interest
Ban Francisco is taking in the matter.
The letter reads as tollows:

If we knew just the night of your mass-meet
ing we would send you a grph message.
Tours very truly, Ethas Allen, President.
Professor J. L. Tuck, an inventor of
sub-marine torpedo-boats and other: en
gines of warfare, offered to explain to the
committee the value of a terrible device
that he has invented and which he has of
fered to the Cuban leaders.
He said that with two men, to handle it
he could wipe out an arm/, and that with
a limited number he could whi > all the
men Spain could crowd on to Cub n toil.
He could, be said, put Gomez in Havana,
if there was any city left, in ninety days.
The subject was ruled out of order as
not pertaining to tne subject under dimen
sion by the committee, though the mem
bers seemed very much interested in Pro
fessor Tuck's discourse.
After the members present had paid
their assessments to the expense fund the
meeting adjourned, to meet at Metropoli

tion.
THE VICTIM OF A PLOT.
Evidence Against Art Ingram and His
Wife, Who Murdered
L J. White.
WICHITA, Kans., March 13.â Art
Ingram and his wile Mary, held for the
murder of L. J. White, which occurred on
the evening of March 10, were given a
preliminary hearing before Judge Jones,
to-day and were both bound ovsr to the
District Court The case i 9 one of unusual
interest because of the mystery which
veils the motive for the crims and b -cause
of the peculiar manner in which the
death blow was dealt. While, was killed
by a piece of gas pipe, which was hurled
at him, and struck him in the back of the
head, penetrating far into the cranial
cavity. The testimony of a disreputable
woman was introduced by the defense
to-day to show that White was a frequent
but secret visitor at the Ingram home;
that Ingram found him thereon the night
of the murder; that the men quarreled
and that Wuit* was the aggressor. White

Makes a Happy Little Speech
in Acknowledgment of
the Honor.

the Prompt Passage of tha
New Tariff Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13.â
Speaker Reed was unanimously nomi
nated for Speaker of the House of Repre- .
Â»entativosat to-night's Republican caucus.
The attendance of members was unusually
large, 192 of the 203 being present The
new members were conspicuously nu
merous.
Payne of Â«N T ew York was selected to
place Mr. Reed In nomination. He re
ferred in nattering terms to the Speaker's
popularity in the House.
He said that the man from Maine was
nominated when tnis Congress waÂ»
elected ; that he was the choice of the Re
publican party, and that it waa the busi
ness of the members to respond to this
popular demand. When Payne had taken
his seat Grosvenor of Ohio, who occupied
the chair, put the motion and it was
adopted without a dissenting vote.
Payne of New York and Cannon of Illi
nois, two of the veteran members of the
House, were designated to escort the
Speaker, who was quietly seated in his
private office, to the floor. As be entered
all the members rose to their feet ana
greeted him with a hearty barst of ap
plause. Mr. Reed bowed his acknowledg
ments, and, standing before the Speaker's
desk, said:
Gentlemen: lam very greatly gratified by
your kind action to-night and shall try to
serve your wishes with whatever ability I
have. We have again, as in the last -Congress,
a politically divided legislative power. Tne
House of Representatives will be Republican
by a considerable majority, and fresa from
the peop.e will endeavor to carry out their
wishes. Ido not doubt your ieterminaoon to
do all in your power (o bring this session of
Congress to a speedy close.
Our duty is simple, and the people expect
us to perform it at once and tneu leave to
them the recovery of tne country from the
stagnation and depression of business which,
have so sore.y tried the patience of a vigorous
and growing peopie.
Wnat others may see fit to do we do not
know, but we have strong hopes t- at all
brunches of the Government will be in accord
as to tne policy of giving to the people imme
diately wnatever tueir wisdom may devise.
Dingiey of Maine, chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee of the last
House, was calUd upon to state what had
been done in preparation for the work for
nh.cn an extraordinary session had Lcen
called. Dingiey said:
I congratulate the Republican members
elect of me Ff ty-fifth Congress upou the prompt
and harmonious manner in w..ieh the prelim
inary worx ot this caucus has been accom
plished. [Applause.]
1 trustthai it isan augury of thep*omptltude
and Harmony which will uo ex. doited in the
extra session which will beopened on Monday.
The Republican members of the Ways and
Means Committee of ttie last House, in re
aponse to a gÂ«aer d demand for Urn course,
has occupied several weeks in revising the
tariff with a view of providing sufficient rev
enue to carry ou the Government without tne
neceÂ»s.iyof borrowing in i. me of peace, and
at the same time so adjusting these duiie* as
to encourage the industries of this country,
which nave been so batty stricke >, part .y by
exce-s.ve foreign emp lition during tue past
three years. [App ause.]
\Y - nope to complete tnis work by Monday,
so as to be able to present a tariff bill to the
House for reference to the Committee on
Ways and Means, winch will probably tuen be
appoi ted, ana lor prompt rep >ri back to the
House for its consideration and action.
lull dol undertake at this time to fore
shadow t ne provisions of tne bill which we
shall present. K-.bi assured that whatever
shortcomings it may have it will n :\ be tne
result of a want of careful consideration, but
of me inherent difficulties in framing a
measure of such magnitude.
The Republican member* of the Ways and
Means Committee, wbo have framed this
meas re, believe, however, thai barring tne
temporary interference arisiig from autici
paung importations for the purpose of "void
ing new dutiesâ an interference that will de
pend entirely upou the promptitude or the de
lay iv its passageâ the proposed bi.l will secure
the two end* so earnestly desired by toe coun
tryâ sufficient :evenue to run t;.e Govern
ment, tne encouragement of American indus
tries and the > pening of aoundant opportuni
ties tor labor. [Applause.]
The Congress which will meet in extraordi
nary session on Monday will meet the expec
tat.ons of our p-op c witnout party distinc
tions if it shall promptly put upon the >ttttute
books a tar ff manure that will meet 'these
two needs. Capita, and labor unite in askiag
that there be uo uuuecessary delay. [Ap
plause.]
Let me again indulge the hope that the
promptness and nnau . mity of our preliminary
actiou to-night may presage the same results
in the work of the extraordinary session
wtrch has been convened by the chief execu
tive, wbo has just been inaugurated amid the
plaudits oi tlits people. [Long-continued ap
plause. ]
Walker of Massachusetts offered a reso
lution providing for a committee of seven
nit-muers >o revise the rules.
W. A. Stone of Pennsylvania made a
motion to adjourn. This, amid some con
fusion, was voted down, nnd Walker was
permitted to proceed with his remarks.
He criticized the rules and maintained
that an impression existed that they did
not permit that freedom of debate which
the House deaired.
Mahany of NÂ«w York followed in a few
remarks, in which he asserted that the
"gag law," which was so prominent in the
Fifty-fourth Congress, did not die in that
Congress, but had been re-enacted here;
that it was the usual trick of seli-conati
tuted leaders temporarily to move the
adoption of the rules of the preceding
Congres*. bat that it Wat easier to move
Mount JSmÂ» than to secure their amend
ment after this was done.
Waiver's resolution was tabled.
A resolution was adopted which re
quires the chairman of the caucus to call
a caucus when a request it made by
twenty-five members in writing.
The present House officers were then
re-elected. They are: Henry D. Couden
of Michigan, chaplain; Alexander Me
,D >well of Pennsylvania, clerk; Benjamin
F. Russell of Missouri, sergeant-at-arms;
W. J. Glenn of New York, doorkeeper.
At 8:50 o'clock the caucus anjourned.

island. Should Greece be compelled to
make a complete backdown, Die King
would probably abdicate. A partial de
feat of tiip Greek Government might also
cause him to withdraw in lavor of the
Crown Prince Constantine.
"The talk of the accession of Prince Con
stantine to ihe throne recalls a tradition
that has been feebly cherished for genera
tions by Greece. Greeks to this day have
their oracles and lay more or let* stre-s on
the predictions of tbe wise men. Years
ago one of the oracles forecasted the
destiny of Greece and said tbe day would
come when a Constantine and Sophia
would rule over the nation and on that
day tbe Greeks wouid possess Constanti
nople. This has been a fond dream of
the Greeks. In Octo er, 1889, when tbe
Crown Prince marrie i Sopuia, sister of
tbe Emperor of Germany, that tradition
was brought forcibly to mind and it has
not been forgotten si nee.
"The German Emperor has two reasons
for bis present cour c with regard to
Greece. The principal one is entirely
personal. It is bis anger at the action of
his sister in embracing the religion of her
husband. The Emperor is a fanatic on
this subject. The other reason -s a finan
cial one. The firm of German bankers
that is the mainstay of the German throne
hold a vast amount of the bonds of Greece.
"Naturally tne bankers and tne Em
peror do not want to see the value or the
securities placed in further jeopardy.
"The outcome? Well, I i hink Crete
will be given autonomy. There will not,
I think, be an evacuation of the i -land by
the Greek troops. Possibly a c mprorutse
may be effected whereby a Governor, to
be named by the powers, will be placed in
command."

ROME, Italy, March 13.â 1t is posi
tively stated in senii-oilieial quarters that
the powers have vir ually decided to malce
no reply to Greece's answer to the note
demanding the withdrawal of the Greek
fleet anil troops from Crete, but to pro
ceed at once to take such step* as will
compel Greece to accede to the demand
made upon her.
It is said tbat the first step to be taken
in this direction will be the establishment
of a pacific blockade of Greece, which
means that vessels captured while at
tempting to run the blockade will not be
condemned and sold, but will be held
until the Creten question shall be settled,
when they will be ieturned to their owners.
VIENNA, ATJ6TBIA, March 13 â The
Fremdenblatt and other papers of this
city state that Russia, Germany and

said, are prepared to co-operate in the
blockade, but the decision of France Is

ATHENS, Gbssck, Marcn 13.â The
Greek steamer Smyrna arrived in Canea

presumably Admiral Canevaro, of the
Italian navy, who Is by reason of seniority
in command of the combined fleets, di
recting him to leave at once.
The captain of the Smyrna refused to
do so, whereupon the admiral who issued
the order sent him notice tbat he would
be triven five minutes in which to obey the
order. If at the expiration of that time
the steamer still remained in port an
armed boat would be sent to cat her cables.
In view of this peremptory notice the
Smyrna weighed her Anchor and left

Sacbamento, Cal., March 11, 1897.
Blodgett, Bake: afield: Three thousand dol
lars wi 1 save Bert on reconsideration.
Blodgett is an officer in the Bakersfield
Bank, which institution holds several
tens of thousands' worth of coyote claims.
As emblyman Emmons is from Bakers
field, and it was through his efforts that
Gay's bill was passed to enable the 8 ate
Board of Examiners to settle the just
claims and reject the bad. Among ttie
Berts known here are Senator Bert from
San Francisco and Bert Packard of Ba
kersfield, and several others of the same
Christian name around the Capitol.
Ever since the coyote claims were pre
sented to the State Board of Examiners
two years aeo persons with an eye to tbe
main chance have been proffering th ir
services to the holders of coyote claims
for a consideration â the consideration
sometimes taking the shape of a commis
sion of so much per cent and sometimes
of a lamp sum.
The story is old, bat tbe fact that propo
siiions of that kind have been made to the
holders of claims is no evidence that these
propositions have been accepted.
Tbe last man who made an overture was
promptly exposed. He was Deputy Sec
retary of Siate McCaivey and was dis
missed from his office for demanding
$3000 on the assumption that he couli
manipulate things so as to have the claim
til d.
The undercurrent of the present story
in that the dispatch, a copy of when the
Ex miner secured at an outlay 01 con
s.dt-rub c coin, was a b tit set for that fake
journal. Tbe bait took, but experience
nad made tbe managers of the Monarch
of the Slums more wary, and they did not
charge bribery as they did in the case of
Democ at Caminetti's bill.
Here is the way the Examiner puts it:
"It is not alleged (hat all the gentlemen
who voted for the coyote-scalp bill did bo
because of dishonest motives; nor is it
even con: ended that every man who
changed his vote did so because c ac
cepted a bribe; but there are few men con
versant, witti legislation and legislative
methods during this tnirty-second s- ssion
who do not feel morally certain that
money was used."
In order to have respectable backing,
that portion of the Examiner staff which
happened to be uui of jail shared the
secret with the Chronicle, but the Ctireni
c'e did not make so much of a fuss over it
as did the jute mill organ. No notice was
taken of the mailer 10-day in the A sem
bly and it is not likely tnat that body will
advertise the fake journal by railing an
investigation to unravel the m aning of
an anonymous telegram wb cb would
never be a>l muted in evidence in any
court in the land.
Assemblyman Arnerich of Santa Clara
said to a Call reporter to-aay that after
he had cxi ressed bis intention to vote
against the bill Emmons came to him and
reminded him of the fact that be had
helped Ar ench with the agricultural
district association bill and pleade l with
him, "Now lor God's sate help me with
mine." "So I c anged my vote and the
rest also changed after me," added Ar
nerich.
Assemblyman Jack Powers of San Fran
cisco denied the statement at ribu ed to
him by me Ex .miner. H said: "I had
inquired ol Eiumons as to tne purpose of
the bill and he sai'i to me that ihe Board
of Examiners and the Governor would
have to pass on all those claims before
they wonid be paid. 1 remarked to Ar
nerich that there was a good deal of
money involved in the bi.l, and he re
marked that if there was sufficient pro
tection around the measure so as to pre
serve the rights of the people he would
vote for it.
'Emmons bad voted with me in the
election, and had voted lor me and was
friendly to me and helped to give me a
fair deal. An Examiner reporter came to
me last night and said: 'I heard that you
paid out money for those votes'; that two
or three men told him so. I said: 'They
are liars and yon are Â» liar, too.' I never
had a talk with Bert Packard â only know
him by sight. 1 never spoke to him be
hind the screen. Tnat is a lie.
"I consulted Guy about the bill, because
it called for such a large amount of money,
and he told me thai it was a good and just
claim, and that the bill bad been intro
duced at the request of Governor Budd
and the remainder ol the Board of Exam
iners. I have con -ul ted with my lawyer
in relation to the matter, and if he advises
me that there is sufficient grounds in the
Examiner's article fora libel smit I will
immediately prosecute the paper, because
I didn't come up here to jeopardize my
reputation by taking bribes."
The screen r-ferie i to is the most public
place in the Assembly chamber outside of
the Speaker's desk. It is just inside tne
big carved doors whiob guard the main
entrance. People are passing in and out
all the time, and no one would care to talk
private matters while standing in a public
doorway.
The fake was got up by the Examiner
for the purpose of lending color to its
libel, for which the key of the jail was
turned upon Long Green and his hired
man to-day.
SO WAKTB OK BXTHATA&AXCm.
An Elaborate Heport by the Printing
Inrettigator*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 13 âThe
Stating Pr mine Committee met to-night,
with Senator John H. Dickinson in the
chair. A partial report of the experts was
read, of which the following is an ab
stract:
We find no evidence of waste or extrava
gance in tbe use or purchase of stock or the
employment of labor at tbe present time. A.I
points in this connection can be readily had
and will appear fuliy in our report, except
that of tbe estimated value of latnr and stock
entering into tbe respective jobs, and this can
only be ascertained by fignriug out the time
and stock nee ssary to complete each Job as it
appears on the general and legislative order
bouts, which womd involve a labor of an in
definite time.
If this were done a very close estimate could
be bad of the exact status oi tbe department
at the present time, and even after the w-rk
whs completed there would still be a laree
margin to dispute over, owing to the honest
d.fference of opinion as to the value oi the la
bor entering into such work, which fact is
c early demonstrated every day by the treat
discrepancies in quotation* of different print
ing establishments when tendering bids for
work in their line required by merchants and
manufacturers.
It being impossible for us to go into the sub
ject thoroughly and do it properly we decided
It best to deal with the work entrusted tons
in a general manner, and see if by Â° ur . re i e Â° m ;
mendations we could improve the methods in
vogue in some of the establishments ana
thereby save unnecessary expenditure exist
ing under the present conditions.
The report recommends that there be a
minimum and maximum scale of wasres
established in th,e book-eindery ranging
from $6 to $12 a week, accor <ing to the
ability of ihe operator. This would make
a saving of from $5000 to $7000 per year.
Considerable waste Is reported in the
engineering department, owing to th*
change from all sieam power to part steam
and part electric power for operating the
machinery, heatian the building and heat
ing of presses.
The expert recommends the purchase of
new presses and machinery in several de
partments as a measure oi economy. The
report farther cays:
We iurther report that it has frequently
transpired that the compositors In the Siate
Printing Office during ihe evening hours of
the legislative session are compelled to wait
for copy for a considerable length of time.
We are of the opinion tnat this is
the result of an insufficient clerical
force at the Secreta y's desk in the Senate and
Assembly to get out the necessary copy for the
compositors, and we would therefore recom
mend that in the future a sufficient force be
placed at the disposal of the chief clerk oi the
Assembly and the secretary of the Senate to
handle such matter. One of the principal
items in connection with the State Printing
Office arises from the time consumed in mak
ing changes and corrections sufficient to entail
more time then would be consumed in re
setting the entire work.
A rule should be enforced that authors
should revise their articles from their original
manuscript and send a clean typewritten copy
on paier of uni:orm siz; to the Slate Printer,
and be allowed but one proof upon which
changes could be made only when tbe sense
of the article has been misinterpreted, or
where typographical corrections are discov
ered. The enforcement of this ru.e will save
the State mauy thousands of dollars in the
publishing of reports.
Tbe partial report of the expert is nearly as
voluminous as the Oil Testament and will be
concluded In our next. It goes into tne most
minute details, and shows ihat the experts
have earned whatever they may claim for
compensation
The committee adjourned exhausted
after tbe reading of tne exhaustive report,
and will meet to-morrow morning at 10
o'clock.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 13.-The
Senate this morning: parsed the following
bills: Appropriating $2500 for the State
Board of Horticulture; appropriating
$2 Â»8 85 to pay the claim of the Tribune
Printing Company.
The woman suffrage amendment came
up for reconsideration, and created con-
siderable debate. The matter was post
poned until 11 o'clock, when a reconsider
ation was granted. Bulla a-ked for a
postponement of action on the bill until
Tuesday next, which was also granted
after a lengthy discussion.
The Assembly bill providing for tbe or
ganization and government of irrigation
districts was reconsidered on motion of
Simpson and carried.
The Senate spent almost tbe entire
afternoon c msidering tbe Assembly bill
creating a department of highway?, defin
ing its duties, etc. This is a bill to con
tinue the Bureau of Highways. Gillette,
Smith and Braunbart opposed tbe bill on
tne groun is t at tbe bureau could not
e fleet a system of State highways with the
funds at us disposal. Braunbart took tbe
stand that a highway system could not
benefit San Franci-co, which paid one
tbird of the t <xÂ»s of tbe State.
Jones and Beard championed tbe bill,
and upon rollcall the vote stood 18 ayes,
11 noes. A call of lit* bouse was bad.
Dickinson, Aram and Seawell were
brought in and voted aye and tbe bill was
passed. Braunhart gave notice of a re
consideration.
The Senate joint resolutions classifying
employes of the postofnve and approving
the House resolution to increase the sal
aries o letter-carr.ers were carried unani
mously.
Witninetnn placed Assembly bill 410 to
pay coyote scalp claims in his place on
tbe special urgency file. Adjourned until
Monday.
The Assembly spent the entire morning
sess-on in reading of tbe county govern
ment act.
Tbe Assembly this afternoon passed
Senate billsas follows: By Pedlar, amend
jik sections of ib Poiticat Code relating
<o tbe Nationul Guard; by Stratton, ap
pr< printing $3000 for tbe equipment ot the
Industrial Home of Mechanical Trades for

Assembly bills were passed as follows:
By Totand, making appropriation to pay
ttie claim of Cnarle W. Metcaif against
the State; by Caminetti, appropriating
$56,000 for the erection of an additional
building at the Preston Home of Industry

the Civil Code relating to owner
ship and disposition of property in
Ravings and loan associations; by
McGrath, empowering governing bodies
of cities of over 100.000 to pension the
widows ot firemen ; by Bettman, confer

tires, saving property and human lives;
by Sims, repealing 'section 3640 of the
I'oJitieal Code relating to duties of As-
sessors.
Powers of San Francisco rose to a per
sonal privilege and stated he had been
charged by the Examiner with taking
money for his vote on tbe coyote scalp
bill. After the rollcall on bills be said:
"Mr. Emmons came to me and stated
that each claim would be subjected
to examination by tbe Board o Ex
aminers. Upon tbe assurance and request
of Mr. Emmons I changed my vote to
aye. The Examiner man came to me and
stated he knew I had the inside of tbe
scalps matter, and if I didn't tell all about
it be would burn me up. I told him I
knew no hng of any bribery in the mat
ter. The statement that I had a conver
sation behind a screen is a deliberate lie,
as is also any statement connecting me
with any bribery."

SECHETIHr
WILSON'S
AMBITION
f Continued from First Page. I
area, with such modifications as soil and
climate may suggest, that tbe new Secre
tary of Agriculture will surprise tbe
farmers of tbe country when they open
their seed packages which they are to re
ceive under the new administration.
But it is not to this alone that the new
Secretary has given his attention during
the first few days of his work. H,e has
found in his work, as have many otners
who have had opportunity to study the
interests of the farmers, ;hat no subj-ct
more engrosses tue atten ion of the agri
culturists than that of bet production.
From the North and West especially the
demand for sugar-beet see is and oppor
tunity to experiment in beet production
has been very great, and now the demand
is coming from the South, where many of
the armers believe that it is practicable
to grow sugar beets. This statement is
Dot limited to those directly interested in
agriculture. The capitalists and business
men of the towns and cities stand ready
to invest large sums o. money in the beet
sugar factories, provided it is found that
beets can be grown successfully in their
localities. With this in view Secretary
Wilson has arranged to distribute beet
seeds to every county in the United
States in whicu beet culture seems to be
at all hKely to succeed. Contracts Have
already been made for a very large quan
tity of beet seeCs of the best varieties and
the work of distributing them will begin
very soon.
These seeds will go to the experiment
stations in the various States, and from
these stations be sent to each county with
instructions to those farmers receiving
them to send the beets thus produced to
the experiment station of that State for
analysis. Instead of discouraging the
farmers of the country ii their ambition
to produce the sugar for which $100,000,
--000 is now sent abroad annually, as seems
to have been the case under the recent
administration, every encouragement will
be given to the experiments and to the
investment of fumis by those desiring to
co-operate with the farmers in the pro
duction of the sugar supply of the United
States.
Members of Congress who have followed
Becreiary Wilson's work, as developed in
the few days that he has been at the bead
of bis department, speak in the highest
terms of the plans and methods intro
duced by him, and through which he is,
they believe, about to op<*n to the agricul
turists of the country new fields and fur
nish them increased earnings. At the
conclusion of his interview wtth The Call
correspondent, Secretary Wilson said that
he would use his best efforts to secure ade
quate protection for Calilornia fruits
against foreign importations, and that ne
would cause to be prosecuted with greater
vitjor than ever the efforts of the Bureau
of Vegetable Pathology to eradicate the
scale in Beet.

HAVANA. Cuba. March 13 (via Key
West, Fla., Martii 13).â VÂ«ry little news
has reached Havana of what has hap
pened in the Philippines. Local papers
have received long telegrams, but their
publication has been prohibited by the
censor.
He only allowed the news of Polavie
jao's resignation on the plea of sick
ness, and this has caused a great sensa
tion among the Spaniards, all disbeliev
ing the story, and attributing it either to
the fact that be has been deeated in front
of Cavity, or worse still, that the Spaniards

tion bu 'in Ex- Officer
y: BOSTON, Mass.}, March ,13.â Following
are excerpts from a column interview
printed here to-day \with Dr. J. H rbert
Stephens, recently "a colonel in the Cuban
army:-. â ....â ' .
'"The insurgent army is a little better
equipped to-day than ever before, and I
should say that at the present time there
are not leas than 60,000 men in the field.
Food has been scarce at times, but when
plentiful, as at r present, consists of beef
and x bananas. â¢ Beef is \ plentiful ;on the
island, where cattle run wild in hundreds
of thousands. The , men round ( them up
and kill and dress a bunch of cows. Mucb
of the beef is wasted, but the supply seeing
unlimited. V ',
â¦'As far as I was able to observe there
are few Americans in the Cuban army and
the stories ot whole companies are un
founded. The Cuban, like the Spaniard,
is suspicious of Americans, and jealousy
prevails all over ti e island. Americans
and Cubans do not affiliate.
"I should say that about 50 per cent of
the men in the Cuban army are colored.
There are few colored men with General
Gomez, but in Santiago de Cuba there are
many colored soldiers, some of whom are
officrs.
"There is not much sickness in the
army as a role. General Gomez is in good
: ealth, and as far as that old wound in
his leg is concerned I can say that while I
was with him it did not trouble him."

There will shortly come before the
courts for trial a civil suit in which a
claim for Â£9,000.000 will be made by a
Welsh collier. The claim, in which the
initial proceedings have just been taken,
concerns the right to the Drymma es
tates, with an annual rent-roll of Â£300,000,
capitalized at Â£600,000. In addition the
litigant, if successful, would acquire title
to a sum close on to Â£13,000,000, lying in
chancery.
The claimant is Nathaniel Richard
Thonjn?. a collier, and in all probability
he will be joined by his stepbrother, David
Meredith. Among the estates involved
is the Hale estate, held by William Wil
liams, ex-member of Parliament for
Swansea, and Glygollen, near Swansea,
held by J. Davies. The property is situ
ated in South Wales.
A report is current in society that the

Conservative member of Parliament for
North Armagh, wiio presided, said upon
the breaking up of the conference that be
regretted the want of unanimity that had

The Daily News explains the collapse of
the conference to the fact that a majority

WAR IS BREWING
DOWN AT SAMOA
Foreign Consuls Ask Their
Governments to Send
Vessels.
King Malietca in Constant Fear
of Attack by Mataafa's
Adherents.
Hostilities Temporarily Checked by
the English, German and Ameri
can Representatives.
APIA, Samoa, Feb. 24.â 1f all Samoa
knew a thing wLich is known by three
gentlemen in white clothes there would
surely be a war. These three men in ducks
are the three Consuls, and it is easy to tell
them apart by their hats.
The United States Consul-General wears
a white cap like Colonel Waring White
wings in New York; the English Con
sul goes aronnd in a white helmet like
that worn by the hot-tempered uncle in
the play, who comes back from India
without his liver, and the German Consul
wears a black Derby, for no reason that
any one can discover except, possibly, that
he is Dutch. But the important matter is
what is going on under those three bats.
If King Malietoa knew certainly that
the three Consuls had sent for warships
by this mail he would surely declare war
against the rebels, for it is always the
Government's policy not to light until
convinced that the three powers will do
the practical work. If, on the other hand,
the rebel chiefs knew that the three Con
suls bad not sent for shlps-of-war they
would attack the Government at once,
and with strong hopes of success.
The three Consuls never talk much
about what they hare in mind, and just
now, like the Tar Baby, they "jes dun
keep on saying nuffin."
The causes for the present great war
feeling, are two. Last month the Govern
ment asked the Consuls to permit the
return of some of the chiefs who
are now in exile in Jaluit for their com
plicity in the last war.
What answer the consols gave the Gov
ernment, as usual, nobody knows; but
the rebel chiefs let it be known that if any
of the exiles returned and left ex- King
Matafa in exile, the Government and the
three powers might count on having a
scrap on hand.
This in itself was enough to make war
likely, but the chance of fighting was
greatly increased by the act of the rebels
in making a descent upon the loyal
islands of Manono and Apolima and driv
ing out all of the inhabitants. This cause
of war will particularly interest Ameri
cans because of depredations committed
upon American property.
Foster Cluff of Thatcher, Ariz., is in
charge of the Mormon mission at Lalovi,
in the desolated district. The rebels took
all of the property out of his house, stole
the communion vessels from the church
and by way of special indignity used the
latter for a cookhouse. Tne president of
the Mormon mission has complained to
Consul-General Churchill, who has pro
tested against the outrage to the King and
Government of Samoa.
From these circumstances war has been
brewing for the last few weeks and may
break out at any moment. The King and
Government have been in nightly terror
of an attack upon Mulinuu, the capital,
and the villages of the loyal district
about Apia are under arms.
There is a new member of the Steven
son family at Vailima, who arrived upon
the 30tu of January. Vice-Consul-General
Osbourne rejoices in a son, who has re
ceived the name of Alan, which will be
familiar to all who have read his distin
guished stepfather's story, "Kidnaped."
The new Municipal Council to serve for
two years was chosen on January 30. The
following are the members: F. C. Conradt,
E. A. Geinsmuhl, John Beckmann, W. C.
Dean, W. Blacklock and Thomas Mere
dith.
The new Council is composed of three
Germans, and one of the English-speak
ing members is so closely associated with
the German interests as to leave his inde
pendence of action more than doubtful.
Even without him, when the new presi
dent arrives the Germans will have a
working majority. England gets two
members ana the United States one, in
the person of Mr. Blacklock, who has been
made temporary chairman.

COMRADES!
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 13.â
Long Green Lawrence was placed behind
the bars of the County Jail this morning.
Thus did he begin the real expiation of
his dastardly and cowardly offense in at
tacking through the fake scavenger jour
nal of which he poses as the manager an
entire body of public and honowble men.
"With him L. L. Levings, a correspondent
of the faking newspaper, was made to
suffer the same humiliating punishment.
Like a rat in a trap the faker-in-chief of
the faking monarch made the most fran
tic efforts through his attorneys and his
political friends in high places to prevent
the key of the prison locs being turned
upon him, but without avail. Sheriff
Johnson could neither be coerced nor
coaxed to depart from his bonnden duty,
and the curious and morbid on-lookers
had the gratification of seeing through
the square sperture in the prison door
the hoodlum-banged, kid-gloved and top-
coated purveyor of cheap and nasty fakes
within the prison walls.
For three and a half hours he remained
In the custody of the Sheriff. Then came
by telegraph a writ of habeas corpus
issued by the Supreme Court and an order
from the same tribunal informing the
Sheriff that the prisoner might be released
on bail, pending the hearing of the new
writ on Tuesday next The necessary
bonds were ready, were taken before
Judge Hughes and approved, and at 1:30
p. m. both prisoners were again breathing
the air of freedom.
Judge Hughes' courtroom was well
filled when that jurist took his place on
the bench and announced that he was
ready to render his decision in the matter
of habeas corpus in behalf of A. M. Law
rence and L. L. Levlnes, committed to
jail for contempt by the Semite of the
State of California.
The Jndge explained his course in de
livering an oral opinion by stating that
the time had been too short to submit his
decision in writing. He reviewed very
briefly the various points raised and early
in his remarks it became evident to bis
auditors that the decision was to be
against the prisoners. Though the opin
ion was brief all the points were clearly
and thoroughly covered, and the opinion
was pronounced by all the legal lights
present to be a masterly effort.
"It is the order of the court that the
petitioners be, and they are hereby, re
manded to the custody of the
Sheriff of the county of Sac
ramento and that the writ be dis
missed" were the concluding words of the
Judge. A minute or two later Lawrence
and his companion prisoner were marched
downstairs to the County Jail.
X was a few minutes after the hour set
when Judge Hughes alone entered the
courtroom and took his seat. He had
hardly got comfortably settled in his chair
when he began the delivery of his opinion
and decision.
"The time which has elapsed," he began,
"since the case was submitted to the
court last evening has been so short that
the court has not been able to do more
*faan examine the authorities which were
submitted, and has therefore not been
able to present a written opinion in decid
ing this case, as it would like to have done.
I would state that at the commencement
of the caÂ«e I had invited Judge Hart to
sit with me during the hearing of this mat
ter and I am now authorized to anonunce
that he concurs in the conclusions that I
have reached.
"While it is admitted by counsel that
the court had the rigbt to issue the writ, I
desire to briefly refer to this power of the
court."
At this point the Judge cited a number
of authorities in reference to this phase of
the case. On the matter of the right of
the court to admit to bail pending the
hearing of a writ of habeas corpus, the
Judge said:
"VVhile there is no direct, power to ad
mit petitioners to bail, other than the
rule of the Supreme Court and the Supe
rior courts of this State, I can state, with
out fear of contradiction, that it has been
the universal practice to admit petitioners
to bail under such circumstances.
"Now, with reference to what limita
tions, if any, were placed on the court in
its investigation of the particular matter
which is the basis for the commitment for
contempt, the authorities of this State are
not in conflict, and the rule aa laid down
by the Supreme Court is the rule enforced
in all the States of the Union."
He oited the case of ex-parte Cohn.
This was a case where the writ was issued
out of a Superior Court on behalf of Cohn,
who had been committed for contempt by
the Probate Court for having failed to dis
tribute an estate as ordered by the court.
On the hearing of the writ the petitioner
was discharged on the ground that the
remedy lay in an action by the distrib
utees to recover.
In the habeas corpus case of McCol
lough the writ was asked for on the
ground of error, but the court held that a
question of error cannot be heard in hear
ings of this kind, and that there should
have been a writ of error. This decision
was affirmed by the Supreme Court.
Reference was made to the action of the
Supreme Court in the habeas corpus case
of Armand. "In this case," eaid the
Judge, "the only thins: that was consid
ered related to the jurisdiction of the
committing court over the person and
subject matter, and the court before
which the writ was heard held that no
irregularity in the procedure and no in
justice or wrong to the prisoner could be
considered.
"Therefore it would appear that the in
quiries which the court in this proceeding
woilld be permitted to investigate would
be:
"Firstâ Did the Senate of the State of
California havt jurisdiction of the subject
matter then under consideration? And
"Second â Is the warrant of commitment
and arrest regular v pon its face?
"That the Senate has jurisdiction to in
vestigate questions of bribery of its mem
bers was decided by the Supreme Court of
this State in the case discussed at length
by counsel yesterday, and this in con

tion giving the Legislature the right to
investigate charges of bribery acalnst its
members for the purpose of expelling them
if found guilty to my mind shows clearly
that the Senate did have jurisdiction of
the subject matter.
"It is true that the resolution under
which it is claimed this jurisdiction was
conferred upon the Senate included
within it olher matters, namely, whether
members of the Senate had been libeled,
or whether or not a public libel, as it was
termed, had been committed. Neverthe
less it is unnecessary to discuss whether
or not the Senate had jurisdiction of such
a proceeding, but a decision in such a case
showed it has. But a decision on that
point would be merely obiter, and it is
therefore unnecessary to take up that
phase of the case.

Court of this State quoted from the de

Pound dead !
There is something so shocking about
sudden death that the mere mention of it
wrenches the nerves of sensitive people.
Millions of people pray for deliverance from
it. Every Sunday in every Episcopal church
in the world, these words are said:
" Prom battle, and murder and sudden death,
Good Lord, deliver us."
Just why sudden death should be shock-
ing, and death after lingering disease easy
to bear, would puzzle any one to tell. It
would seem that it would be more terrible
to see some loved one wasting away, daily
becoming weakerâdaily slipping toward a
death no less certain because it was slow in
coming. Consumption causes more deaths
than heart disease â more than choleraâ
more than yellow fever â more than any
other disease the world has ever known.
And yet people are careless about it. A man
in danger of sudden death from heart dis-
ease can avoid the danger simply by keeping
quiet and avoiding excitement. Consump-
tion goes right on with its deadly work, no
matter what the man does or how he con-
ducts himself, if he doesn't take the right
medicine to cure it Consumption affects
the whole body. It is a blood disease. It
permeates the whole system. It shows in
the lungs because the blood goes to the
lungs for purification. It carries imparities
there to be made pure. If there is too much
impurity, the lungs are over-workedâ over-
loaded â the impurity stops there. The
germs of disease stop there. They develop
and multiply and then consumption takes
definite form. Dr. Pierces Golden Med-

cision of the Supreme Court of Massa
chusetts, which held that the Legislature
is the grand inquisition of the common
wealth, and that as such it has the power
to inquire into the conduct of the officers
of the State and to impeach them if mal
feasance or wrongdoing is shown; it may
inquire into the election of its members to
determine their right to a seat in that
body, and into a variety of matters with a
view to enacting proper and necessary
legislation. Such investigations, the
court further held, may be initiated in
any way deemed desirable, whenever It is
thought proper to institute such an In
vestigation by any mode which they may
choose to adopt, there is a material issue
presented, and each witness may subject
himself to punishment for perjury or con
tempt, as in the case at bar.
"That decision was under the former
constitution of the State, Dut the present
constitution reads as follows: 'Any per
son may be compelled to testify in any
lawful investigation or judicial proceed
ing against any person who may be
charged with having committed the of
fense of bribery or corrupt solicitation or
with having been influenced in his vote or
action as a member of the Legislature by
reward or promise of future reward and
shall not be permitted to withhold his
testimony upon the ground tbat it may
criminate himself or subject himself to
public infamy; but such testimony shall
not afterward be used against him in any
judicial proceeding except for perjury in
giving such testimony.'
"Inis unquestionably confers upon the
Senate the power to make an investigation
concerning the bribery charges, and the de
cision in the McCarthy case is clear upon
the proposition that the Senate may adopt
any mode it may deem proper in making
such an investigation, and without regard
to the mode the Senate mar adopt a mate
rial issue is presented, touching which
witnesses may be examined and become
liable to punishment for perjury or con
tempt. Therefore it would appear that a
material issue did exist, and that in the
examination of the petitioners had before
the committee and befora the Senate the
questions propounded to the witnssses
were material to the subject matter of the
investigation.
"Such being the case the conclusion is
necessarily that the Senate has acted
within the scope of its jurisdiction, and,
therefore, had authority to punish the
petitioners for contempt. And the court,
after a careful examination, has reached
thia conclusion. It is, therefore, ordered
that the petitioners be and they are here
by remanded to the custody of the Sheriff
of the county of Sacramento and that the
writ be dismissed."
After the two prisoners were taken be
low by the Sheriff, their attorneys used all
their powers of friendly and professional
persuasion upon Johnson to induce him
not to put his prisoners under lock and
key.
The Sheriff, however, declared that he
had no alternative, and unless the court
ordered differently he would have to lock
the two men up. While Attorneys Houghes
and McEcerney were arguing with the
Sheriff Andy Clunie returned upstairs and
tried to persuade Judge Hughes to modify
his order so that the odium of having
been cast into jail would not attach to hi â¢
two clients. But here, also, the attorney
for the faking journal found that the law
had no respect for persons who knowingly,
willfully and contumaciously violated its
precepts.
Undismayed, Clunie returned to the
attack again by approaching Sheriff John
son and intimating that Judge Hughes
had granted a stay of the order of im
prisonment, pending word from the
Supreme Court at San Francisco. This
being a most unusual departure from all
precedent in such cases, Johnson called
personally on Judge Hughes and asked
him if he bad made or contemplated
making such a modification of the original
order delivered in open court. The Judge
replied that while personally he would
like to see Lawrence and Levinga escape
the shame and humiliation of being placed
behind the bars, be did not see how he
could prevent it, aa the custody of the
prisoners had been now transferred to his
questioner.
Johnson trudged downstairs again and,
indignant over the trick that had been at
tempted on him, marched the prisoners
into the jail and placed them in charge of
his chief jailer.
"That this was the bitterest pill that Lone
Green Lawrence bad ever been made to
swallow was clearly evident," said Sheriff
Johnson in relating the incident. "He
felt the humiliation as keenly as if he
were to be imprisoned for forty years,"
added the Sheriff.
On the pretense that they wished to
consult with his attorneys Lawrence and
Levinga were allowed to go into the room
next the Sheriff's office, used by prisoners
and their counsel for conferences, where
they were joined by McEnerney and Clu
nie. Meanwhile the dinner hour of tne
jail approached and both prisoners were
invited to the table set inside the jail.
Levings accepted the invitation, but Law
rence's appetite apparently revolted at
the idea of eating prison far* with his fel
low prisoners.
He asked to be tatcen oat to lunch, but
Sheriff Johnson declined to accommodate
him, but gave him the privilege of having
his dinner brought him from the outside.
Lawrence, being in momentary expecta
tion of release through the efforts being
made toy his attorneys in San Francisco,
concluded to wait until he was again a
free man.
All otner means for freedom having
failed, a telegram was sent to Attorney-
General Fitzgerald at ban Francisco ask
ing him to consent to a stay of the orde?
of the court, but this resulted as fruitlessly
as the other attempts to keep the two
men out of jail.
It was not until about 1:30 p. M. that the
telegraphic writ of habeas corpus and the
order permitting the prisoners to be re
leased on bail, pending the hearing of the
new writ, was received from the Supreme
Court The bail bonds, with Charles P.
Nathan and Frank L. Gray as bondsmen,
in the sum of $1000 for each of the peti
tioners, were in readiness and were at
once approved by Judge Hughes. Then,
on the advice of District Attorney Ryan,
the prisoners were released.
In anticipation of having the two men
as guests over night, Sheriff Johnson had
cell 2 prepared for their accommodation.
ONE CLEW TO THE FAKE
Sam Braunhart Started the Vile
Rumors That Led Up to the
Llbelous Story.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 13.â Up
to the present time the investigation of
the Senate bribery committee lias demon
strated only in a negative, though conclu
sive manner, that the charges of the Ex
aminer were based on rumor and hearsay
alone. From the development before that
committee to-day, however, it looks as if
they will be able to learn in a positive
way that such is the case.
The important clew was given by Sen
ator Doty in the course of his testimony
before the committee, and points to Sen
ator Bramibart aa the source of the infor
mation which led the fake news paper to
publish its unfounded charges of bribery
and general corruption among the mem
bers of the Lesislature.
Twenty of the members of the upper
house were before the committee to-day,
and all, with the exception of two of them,
knew absolutely nothing that could throw
any ligbt on the charges of bribery, either
directly or indirectly. Those examined
werer Hall, Morehouse, Wolfe, Prisk,
Toner, Androus, Chapman, Voorheis,
Linder, Seawell, Franck, Doty, Gillette,
Withington, Simpson, Flint, Holloway
and Henderton.
While Doty was on the witneis-stand
he wa3 ascedif he had heard anything re
garding bribery after the bill had been
passed, ana this opened his store of infor
mation. AH previous questions had borne
upon matters preceding the passage of
the measure. He asked permission to be
excused in order that he might consult
with the person from whom he had heard
regarding bribery in connection with the
bill and was granted his request. He was
absent a few momenta and when he re
turned he told the committee that he was
ready to give all the infomation he pos
sessed on the subject.
Senatpr Seawell had been conducting
the examination during the session,
thoueh all the members of the committee
were present. To a question by Seawell,
Doty replied as follows:
"A gentleman came to my seat after
the bill had been passed and said to me,
'This don't look right. You have gone
wrong on this bill. 1 He said it in such a
way that I felt as if there was something
behind it. He said it in such a way
that it made me feel peculiar, and I
asked him the particulars about the mat
ter. He said, 'I don't think that; you
voted for it for any consideration. I don't
want you to think that for a moment.'
Tnen he said there was money behind
that bill, or he understood there was. He
intimated that there was in his judgment,
or that he thought so."
"He did not say so?" interposed Seawell.
"Did he mention the amount that he
heard had been received and the names- of
those he had heard it from?"
"I don't know," answered Doty, "where

he got his information or anything about
it Senator Shine was present and was
sending dose by me. I did not suppose
there was any secret about it at thetime.
He mentioned something in regard to the
amount, I think it was $150 that he said
was paid to Assemblymen and $300 to $350
to Senators. He seemed to know some
thing about the matter. He said he had
heard it rumored."
Senator Seawell said: "We want to
know from whom you got this informa
tion." M
"I am willing to answer that now, re
sponded Doty. "It was Senator Braun
hart. Be came to my desk and told me,
and I have his consent to tell you about
this." â .
Senator Henderson testified that Judge
Frick of Oakland bad admitted to him
that the bill would be a good thing for the
Hale & Norcross people.
Senator Braunhart will be called .on
Monday, and it will then in all probability
be developed that the whol? fabric of the
Examiner's story was built upon just such
idle reports as were carried to Doty by
Braunhart.
The Examiner has been taking consola
tion in the predicament in which it now is
by making gleeful boasts and malicious
insinuations that the Senate would be glad
to drop the investigation, now that it had
punished sonle of the Examiner's em
ployes. It need hardly be said that its
wish in this regard was simply father to
the base thought, and that the Senate
will carry along the investigation as long
as there is a particle of evidence to be ob
tained, or until it is positively proved that
bribery took place, or that the Examiner
knowingly and malevolently faked its
whole story with nothing but a skeleton
of shadowy, rumor to build upon.

MR. STRAUSS' GENEROSITY
It Is Acknowledged by Govern
nor Budd as of Public
Benefit.
The following letter is self-explanatory:
Levi Slrausx, Esq., San Franciscoâ Dear
Wnlle the Regents of the University of Cali'
fornia have extenckd to you their thanks for
your timely gift tc aid poor Hnd deserving
students throughout the whole State to obtain
an education at the State I'niversitv Â«nrt
while I, as president of the Board of Regents
share in the resolutions ot the board whirl!
have been passed in this behalf 1 bee
to say, as Governor of the state of California
that I welcome the disposition Bhown in the
terms of your giltâ a disi osition which tends
to bring every part of the State of California
Into harmonious and mutually helpful rela
tionsâa disposition which will aid creatly to
mltieate tne prejudices of place and locality,
will add to the patriotism of the whole State
aud in every way tend to the general good.
I have long contemplated a change in the
local character ol the >ormai schools of this
State, so that they might subserve the pur
poses and in fact constitute brancnes of our
State University, so that students could prac
tically attend the State University for perhaps
the first two years near their own homes, and
there receive absolutely similar instruction to
that at the parent institution, and by the same
professors.
A recent act of the Legislature enables this
to be done, while permitting the Normal
schools to retain their distinctive and this
dual character, and I have approved a bill for
a State Normal School at Ban Diego with the
idea of thus affording to that portion of the
State a branch of our Btate University.
I therefore hail such an act as yours, which
not only furthers all of the above purposes,
but makes such donors as yourself not so
much residents of their special localities, ai
citizens of the State of California. I am, dear
iir, yours very truly, James H. Btjdd.

to Complain About

MULDCON EXAMINES THE SAN
FRANCISCAN.

diticnâSports F ocking to
Carson.
CARSON, Nev., March 13. â Martin
Julian accepted in behalf of Bob Fitz
simmons, yesterday, Referee George
Siler's interpretation of the Marquis of
Queensberry rules permitting hitting in
the clinches and in the breakaways; but,
â as was related in yesterday's issue of The
Call, ft was not until after a long and
worrying wrangle had been indulged in
that Julian acknowledged the supremacy
of the referee in this particular matter.
Now come-< the story that Fitzsimmons
will not abide by Julian's acceptance and
will act for him self in the matter of say
ing what rules he will fight under. For
seme reason or other the Cornishman Has
taken a sudden dislise for the clinch rule
as elucidated by Siler, and he declared
openly to-day that inasmuch as he is the
man who has to fight Corbett he has the
right to have something to say regarding
the rules which are to govern the battle.
Bob seems inclined to think that his
manager and brother-in-law, Julian, gave
in rather too easily. Apparently â I say
apparently advisedly â he cannot get it
out of his queerly shaped bead that the
rules as they stand favor Corbett's method
of lighting and will in consequence oper
ate to his own disadvantage.
This will doubtleis have an odd ring to
those who are not familiar with Fhzsim
mous' ring tactics, just at every press rep
resentative who listened to Martin
Julian's statement yesterday that Bob
knew nothing of clinch bitting was forcad
to snicker.
I don't think the Cornishman is a bit
sincere in his objection to trie clinch
clause any more than I believe Julian
means what he said at yesterday's confer
ence in regard to it. Bob is tricky, you
know. By pretending to have the worst
end of every deal he enters into he coaxes
his opponent into being a little over-con
fident â into believing that the lanky fel
low is either afraid or doubtful about hii
ability to win.
When his adversary thinks he has
things his own way he leaves openings
that be would otherwise carefully guard,
and Fitzsimmons gets the chance he
wants. Fitzsimmons has done this often,
and Julian has rendered him valuable as
sistance by affecting a penchant for hair
splitting and quibbling over trifles and
finally giving way, thus leaving an im
pression of generosity on his and the
lighter* pa it.
Now, wou,ld there be any harm in work
ing. the old rvalue over agcin? Surely they
could lose noVhing by it For the moment
they might sacrifice some public prestige,
but as soon they coma out finally and an
nounce tbrat they will accept the rules as
they stand everybody will applaud and
fcay that Bob is the most liberal-hearted
boxer in the ring. That's what Fitz
likes. He goes into the arena, then, a
pronounced favorite with the spectatprs,
and you know that isalwavs encouraging.
It gives a fighter confidence and am bition
that he might otherwise be in need of. To
myjiotion it is Fitzsimmons' intention to
let this matter hang fire for a day or two,
bo as to give the world a chance to do
come talking. Then he will surrender.
Nobody can convince me that Fitz
eimmohs is not as good as Corbett in
taking care of himself in the clinches,
Martin Julian's declaration to the con
tiary notwithstanding; and I believe the
Cornishman is of the same way of think
ing, down deep in his heart. What did
he-do to Peter Maher, to Billy McCarthy
â¢nd to Joe Choynski every time there was
a clinch?
But then, as the matter stands, we must
%ait until the Cornisuman makes his an
nouncement. In the meantime big, good
hearted Dan Stuart is the man who has
to suffer. Hundreds of people who want
to witness this tight are practically rest
ing on a hair-trigger, if the expression will
be permitted. They have gone to Hot
Springs and other places expecting to see
a fight, and have spent their good money
liberally, but only to be confronted by a
fiasco. Naturally they exhibit some turner
ity about venturing out a^ain until they
â¢reassured absolutely that not only will
the law keep its bands off, but. that the
principals themselves really mean to fijiht.
Every little rumor of a hitch that toes
out has a tendency to scare these kind of
people to cause them to cling to their
passage money a little longer. Stuart
realizes that thess stories cannot be sup
pressed,' and he is using his every effort to
bfcve things run along smoothly, leaving
no room for disturbing rumors to arise.
He breathed a deep sigh of relief yester
day when Martin Julian announced that
be would ab.de by Siler's interpretation of
the rules, but now that Fnzsimmons him
self shows signs of "Kicking over the
traces" the big Texan's cup of bitterness
is again filled to the brim.
But 1 am satisfied of one thing, and
that is that there is not the Jeast chance
of the big mill falling through, unless one
or.tbe other of the principals deliberately
flunk* and makes a quiet exit from the
scene over the mountains surrounding
Carson. He would never get away by
train. This is only a hazardous view of a
bare possibility. Neither Corbett r.or
F tz^immons would tiare do such a thing.
When I say there is uoing to be a tight I
should qualify. I mean that even if Fitz
eimmons insists up to the 17th ol March
that he will not fight unletts the clinch
clause is eliminated, the fight will go on
just the same, for I have it on the very
best authority that if the worst comes to
the worst in this regard Corbett will agree
to any rules that Fitzsinimons may choose
to name. Jim is saving this as a grand
stand play, J am told.
There was nothing very startling about
the training of the two big Centers as both
are now practically laying off and taking
matters rather easily. Fitzsiramons took
an eight-mile run on the road leading
from Cook's ranch and after tnat did some
light work with the punching-bag and
boxed for a while with Hickey and Stelz
ner. After luncheon he hitched up a
phaeton for Mrs. Fitzsimmons and mount
ing his bicycle rode into Carson behind
her. H.ib hied himself to a barber-shop
and had his face scraped and what little
red hair he has left trimmed, did a little
shopping and pedaled home. That con
stituted his day's work.
Corbett also took advantage of the fine
weather and did some road work in the
forenoon, and in the afternoon went
through his usual capers with the wrisi
machine ami punching bag, played hand
ball and boxed forty-tive minutes.
There were three notable arrivals in
Carson to-day. They were: Ai Smith, the
stakeholder in the big mill; William Mnl
doon, the famous wrestler and physical
culturist, and Billy .Madden, the well
known manager of sporting events.
Smith wa* gazed upon by envious eyes,
for everybody who knew anything at all
knew that he had $25 000 lucked away in
hia inside pocket. Al had the "stuff" all
right enough, but it is represented by a
number of certificates of deposit.
These are, ot course, as good aa gold as
soon as Mr. Smith attaches his uncom
mon signature to them. Al has a happy
faculty of matting himself popular
wherever he goes. It costs nothing, tie
explains, and requires no particular effort
on the part of one possessing such a con
geniai nature as is his. He had scarcely
been in Carson a half hour when he began
to expatiate on the glorious climate.
"Thi3 is absolutely perfect weather,"
said Al; "such as one always finds out
this way. Overcoats in this climate are
burdensome," and to bear out this latter S
statement the celebrated sportsman im
mediately shed bis mackintosh and rele
gated it to his arm.
"As to the fight," resumed Smith, "the
prospects are the most rosy that ever at
tended an affair of this sort. I find that
both of the men are in admirable shape,
and if there was ever a sincere pair of pugi
lists you have them in Corbett and Fitz
simmons. I find that they are trained to
an edge, and the contest should be a
'corker.' Such confidence as the men
display is astounding.
"Of course there must be a winner and
a loser, but if you can find the latter or a
linn tbat would lead to that conclusion by
looking over and talking to the men you
beat me. 1 cannot for the life of me recall
a contest which presents such complex
propositions as this one in the matter of
calling the turn.
"I went out to look over the arena, too,
and find it the best of its sort I ever vis
ited. There is not a seat in the whole vast
structure which does not present a c ear,
unobstructed view.
"The welter and feather-weight fights I
look to for a whole lot of genuine sport.
The men are so evenly matched and have
trained so faithfully that I would not be a
bit surprised to see the bait fight of the
three crop out in one of the lesser engage
ments. With these conditions, backed up
by weather such as one would expect to
find in tropical lands this time of year, I
predict tbat Mr. Stuart will get some re
turns for the ceaseless and untiring pluck
he has displayed. It would take a whole
lot of money to induce me to miss the treut
I know is in store for the lovers of the
manly game."
Al's talk about the condition in which
he found "both men" was a little prema
ture. It is true that he went out to
Shaws Springs and got a glimpse of Cor
bett, dressed and taking a sun bath ; but
he has not yet seen Fitzsimmons. Smith
knows, however, that the Cornishman is
always in condition, and in bis exuber
ance let the idea go out that he knew all
about the lanky chap's present shape.
But, then, that's all right. Smithy always
was an enthusiast. He contracted the
habit while he was managing John L.
Sullivan during the big fellow's palmy
days.
It was good for sore eyes to gaze once
more upon Billy Muldoon. It was the
first time I had seen him since the days of
his famous wrestling matches in the Me
chanics' Pavilion and elsewhere in San
Francisco, with Donald Dinnie, Le Grand
Augu.sie, Giarence Whistler and Bauer,
and his subsequent debut with Emerson's
Minstrels as a "living picture." "Sweet
William," as they used to call him, is
still clean-shaven, as handsome as ever
and the Apollo of old in physique, but
time has taken a grip on his round head
and is turning it quite gray-
Moldoon went out to Corbett's training
quarter*, this afternoon and was given a
beartv welcome by the Californian and
his retinue. The celebrated knight of the
pad at once expressed bis admiration for
Corbett's general appearance, and said
that be never saw him looking better.
Tbat is what everybody says, so there
must really be something in it.
Corbett stripped off so that the ereat ex
pert on physical culture might examine
Dim thoroughly, and the result was that
Muldoon's verdict was rendered all the
more emphatic. He considers that the
Californian ii al present in perfect condi
tion and really does not need to train
another day. Both Muldoon and Al
Smith will go out to pay FiUsimmons a
visit to-morrow morning.
Billy Madden s visit to Carson ia not in
the capacity of expert or stake-holder.
He comes here primarily, of course, to
see the fight, but he lias other important
business on hand, and that is to challenge
the winner of the big battle in behalf of his
Australian protege, Joe Goddard. Billy
says he is ready to put up a deposit right
away to bind a match for $10,000 a side
and the best purse offered, the winner to
take everything. Madden is goiugr to
make an effort to eet his challenge in first,
bo as to head off the showers of others
that threaten to pour in upon the winner
of the St. Patrick's day event.
Charley Mitcbell, Jobn L. Sullivan and
Peter Jackson will represent the has-beens
in this challenging brigade, while Joe
Choynski, Peter Maher and Goddard will
pose as the later generation of fighters.
George Slier will not referee the fights be
tween Green and Smith and Hawkins and
Flaherty, as has been supposed. By agree
ment between the principals and at use
suggestion of promoter Dan Stuart, Mala
ctiy Uogan, the well-known Eastern sport
inn man, will officiate in these two events.
Hogan is an old hand at the business and
has the reputation of being one of the
"squarest" referees on tbe continent.
The tinetoscope people begas erecting
their apparatus in the big arena to-day
and it was immediately discovered that
one of Dan Stuart's orders to his subordi
nates bad noi been carried out. Before
being taken sick be gave instructions that
an open space should be left in the rear of
the kinetoscoDe position, so that none of
tue spectators would have their view ob

quence an entire section, containing near*

carpenters at work to-day in order to
hurry tbe work along. Tbe discovery
that tbe platform in tbe center of the
arena is too small to accommodate a
twenty-four-foot ring, as was published in

cause of eliciting orders from Stuart to

E. 8. Patterson of Reno, president of
the Law and Order League of Nevada,
made a strong effort to-day to induce the
Attorney-General to take some steps
toward stopping the fight. In a petition
which he filed with that official he sets
forth that the Garrard law is unconsti
tutional, and that to allow the fight to go
on would be a gross outrage and a dis
grace to Nevada.
The Attorney-General did not grow ex
cited over the matter ; he wants to see the
fight himself, so he pigeon-holed the pe
tition and says he will look it over after
\ St. Patrick's day.
Owing to the influx of tinhorn gamblers
and sharpers during the past weeK the au
thorities of Carson have decided to have a
round-up. It will take place on Monday
and promises to afford some fun. Orders
have gone out to the police officers,Der>u>y
Marshals, Sheriffs and Constables to grab
every suspicious looking character, sure
thing gambler, men who have no visible
moans of support and last, but not least,
every individual who cannot show that he
is the possessor of at least $5. Some tall
borrowing is going on among the knights
of the green and broken-down sports in or
der to stand oS that last provision.
The Nevada Legislature adjourned to
night sine die, and in consequence every
body who had a fear that an anti-prize
fighting bill might crop up breathes freely.
At no time have the promoters of the big
contest ielt exactly easy while the states
men remained in session. There was
really danger all along that the reformers
would trot out a bill prohibiting prize
fiÂ»hi3, and there was no telling whether
they could push it through or not.
But that danger is now passed and all
seems smooth sailing for Big Dan.

FORTUNE SMILES
UPON SALINAS
Sugar- Beet Culture Only
One of Its Sources of
Revenu\
A Town of Energetic Men, Good
Schools and Brilliant
Prospects.
The Commercial H art of a Region
as Rich as the Valby of the
Nile.
SAUNAS, Cau, March 13.â 1t is evi
dent to all who have rmide even a casual
study of the industrial outlook in this
vicinity that Salinas is on the eve of a new
growth. Interests now making for the
general prosperity of the town ana the
section adjacent are numerous, but the
beet-sugar industry promises to be the
ciant among ttie factors of the new era.
The fame of Salinas is spreading rap
idly, and ii may be remarked at the out
set that some injury :s likely to occur be
cause of the piemature heralding of this
county's claims. Already there are evi
dences that a number of mistaken people
The Jeffrey Hotel, One of the Substantial Blocks in Salinas.
are preparing to rush in with the hope of
finding a land of milk and honey. Con
servative citizens like Capitalist Ball,
Merchant Irvine and Real Estate Agent
Lane, whose names nrÂ« known wherever
the ramifications of Salinas' commerce ex
tend, havti repeatedly impressed upon me
thedanpers i f booming this region so as to
draw a class of unfortunates here.
"A pitiful case recently arose," said Mr.
Irvine to-iiav, "of a poor storm-beaten
fellow who came here from Los Angeles
with bis family. He noped he would find
a Mecca at once, but there was nothing,
and his family Buffered from hunger be
fore the people relieved him."
The truth is tha' times me Just as hard
here to-day as anywhere in the State.
People cannot live on future prospects,
nor bae anybody ever male a meal of the
rainbow of hope.
Salinas is deeply interesting to the stu
dent uf economic tendencies, for it is the
most Striking example of a California
town whose people are about to confront
new condition-. It will be a study of
great value to watch the development of
â¢ Industry when new railroad facilities and
the greatest beet sugar mill in the world
become living fiicts. The masters of agri
culture lons ago foresaw that great
changes must come in the methods of
farming in the West. In the old days of
ox tennis people thought nothing of the
problem^ involved in "a rotation of
crops," but to-day it is strikingly true
that the fÂ«rmer reaps a rich or a useless
harvest as a result of the wisdom or folly
of his sowing.
So it has come to the point that the
brains and capital of mÂ»-n of foresight are
about to dedicate this rich soil to new
uses. Just as the grazing lands gave way
to wheat fields in the evolution of in*
austry, so the fields of wheat that no
longer produce cold are nbout to cive way
to the sugar-beet. The world's sweet j
tooth ni.iv prove the means of saving !
California's agrarian population from de- j
struct ion. Weary of the unequal battle
with wheat-growers of India and the Ar
gentines, the up-to date larmer will em
bark in the new line of industry, witii
better prospects and surer results. But
that is another story.
It will be interesting to study in detail
come of the reasons that give conservative
people great faith in this thriving town â 
and in the wonderfully rich region o: !
which it is the entrepot and natural com- j
mrrcial center.
At the outset the person interested j
j ought to know something about the won
> denul county of which Salinas is the
political and commercial center.
Monterey Conrity lies on the coast, its
northern boundary being anout 100 mites
south from San Francisco. Itis one of the
largest counties in California, having an
area of 3600 square miles, or over two and
j:i quarter million acres of land. The
! county i 9 eighty miles in length and about
forty-five in width. Itis bounded on the
north by Santa Cruz County and Monterey
Bay, on the east by the couniiesof San
Benito, Fresno and Tulare, on the south
by San Ltii* Obispo. and on thtÂ» west by
the Pacific Ocean. Owinz to the peculiar
i topographical character of the county,
with its rough mountains and broad
plains, geitly rounded hills and fruitful
valleys, it has a great diversity of soil,
climate and productions, making ir, for
purposes of settlement, one of the most
desirable regions in the State.
The county is divided into three sec
tions â the mountains and hills on tne
east, the mountains and hills on the west
and the great Salinas Valley situated be
j tween the ranges of mountains and open
i ing upon Monterey Bay at the north. The
I Salinas Valley extends south from Mon
terey Bay over a hundred miles, and is
j from live to fifteen miles wide. It is in
I thia marvelous reeion that millions of
] tons of suÂ«ar beets are yet to be raised.
! The great industry will prove an object
i lesson to the world in what may be done
i in the rich soil and genial clime of Cali
fornia.
The Salinas Valley, In point of fertility
and diversity of soil, has no superior in
tlie Slate, and when this is considered in
connection with its mild and healthful
climate, the amount of tillable land and
its proximity to tne commercial center of
the State, the great advantages possessed
for transportation of produce by both rail
a:id water,' it has no equal. There are
"about 175,000 acres cultivated in the Sali
! nas Viillev. The Southern Pacific, run-
I Rinf south from San Francisco, extends
through the entire lengtn of the valley as
far nÂ» Santa Margarita, San Luis Obispo
County, and will undoubtedly be com
pleted to Santa Barbara this year, thus
placing this valley on the line of the long
est transcontinental railroad in the world.
One of the best informed men here en
the resources of the county is Editor W.
T. Hill of the Index, who lias made a spe
j cial study of the county's resources for
many years. He :urnishes the following
interesting facts about the soil and re
sources on which people base their hopes
for the future, and from which they now
earn tneir living:
'â¢The Salinas Valley, embraced by the
Gabiian Mountains on th? northwest and
the Santa Lucia range on the southwest,
opens out on Monterey Bay and extends
southward 100 miles, with an average
width of ten mile-". Its area, therefore, is
about 1000 square miles or 640,000 acres of
land â almost an empire in itself. The
Salinas River flows through the valley.
The ban Antonio hills stretch diagonally
across the val.ey about seventy-five
miles from the mouth of the river and di
vide the valley into two portions, the re
gion above being a KWt of table-land of
low, roliin r bills, while below there is a
valley gradually opening out until at Sa
linas City it i? twelve or fifteen miles
wide ana as tine a section for farming as
any in the State. The lands of this valley
may be divided into three classes.
"First â The heavy, rich bottom lands
which will grow almost anything. The
soil is mostly black adobe, and frequently
contains just enough sand to make it work
easily. These lands sometimes produce
over 100 bushels o barley to the acre, and
of wheat over sixty-five bushels. Average
crop of wheat, thirty-live bushels; barley,
sixty bushels.
"Secondâ The table-lands, which are
particularly well adapted to growing
wheat, barley and other cereals, the aver
age yield of wheat being about thirty
bushels, and of barley about fifty busuels
per acre.
"Third â The uplands, good for the pro
duction oi wheat, barley, oats and rye,
and here alio are located some of the finest
dairies in the State. Some of the land is
the beÂ«t fruit land in California and will
produce oranges, lemons, grapes, peaches,
apricots, almonds, tigs, apples, plums.
b Tries and other fruits common to this
section."
Besides wheat, barley and other cereals
potatoes are extensively cultivated in the
Salinas Valley, and in many localises
they yield immensely and are very profit
able. The best land for potatoes is the
light, sandy or sediment soil near the
coast or along the rivers. This soil pro
duces from 100 to 200 sack* an acre, weigh
ing from 125 to 133 pounds a sack. Beans
are extensively cultivated, and aLalfa
grows luxuriantly, furnishing immense

crops of hay. The fields of alfalfa are per
petually green.
The following facts concerning ware
bouses in this region give an idea of the
fertility of the soil. Their capacity is
shown by the following fl^ores: H. 8.
Ball's warehouse at Salinas, 13,000 tons;
Charles Louis' warehouse at Coopers, 6000
tons; M. It. Merritt's warehouse at Castro
ville, 4000 tons; F. Blacfcie'a Moro Gojo
warehouse, 3000 tons; Moss Landing ware
house*, 24,000 tons. Tha combined capa
city of thesp warehouses, all within a ra
il iv* of nine miles from Castroville, is
49,000 tons. Tuere is also a warehouse at
Bardin's and there are a number Of others
in different parts of the valiey.
The town .of Salinas has not anything
more beautiful than its climate, which is
not surpassed anywhere in the world.
There ii a difference of but 15 degrees
Fahrenheit between summer and winter,
the mean temperature for January being
50 decrees and that of July 65. The at
mosphere is pure, healthful and invigo
rating. Bince the foundation of the town
it has not been visited by an epidemic.
Di-eases attributable to climatic origin
have never been developed here. Troubles
of a malarial nature are cured here, and
the climate is beneficial to rheumatism,
bronchial and lung troubles.
Salinas is located near the center of the
great Salinas Valley, ten miles from tide
waterat Moss Landing, twenty miles from
Monterey and 118 miles south of San
Francisco. The city wm incorporated by
act of the Legislature, March 4, 1874. L
J. Harvey was the first Mayor, and the
Common Council was composed of Wil
liam Vanderhurst, J. B. Iverson, William
Burbeeck, H. P.Tutcle, M. Hughes and B.
S. Wilooxen. Under their able and ener
getic administration Main street was
paved with stone, asphaltum sidewalks
were constructed and a system of general
improvement* begun. It was predicted
long before the location of the great bee i
su ar iactory here that Salinas had a pros
perous future before it. Its geographical
location makes it certain that the town
must share largely in the general advance
in values and increase in business which
are certain to improve the business of the
entire State.
Salinas has all the appurtenances be
longing to a well-conducted town, in
cluding good hotels for the accommodation
of the traveling public, enterprising mer
o .ants and handsome private residences
surrounded by trees and embowered in
vines and flowers. There are nine hotels,
six large dry goods establishments, fifteen
general merchandise and grocery stores,
three hardware stores, five stove and tin
shops, three feed stores, five meat markets,
four wholesale liquor stores, two furniture
stores, four drug stores, two cigar ami
tobacco stores, a large cigar factory, a
great flouring mill, a large lumber com
pany, three news stands, two book stores,
six boot and shoe shops, six
barber &hops, three harness shops, four
livery stables, three feed yards, five
merchant tailors, four restaurants, six
painters and paper-bangers, one brewery,
one sodawater factory, one bakery, two
machine-shops, six blacksmith- shops,
three millinery stores, eight dressmakers,
three jewelry establishments, six real
estate offices, ten insurance agents, one
bank, one photograph gallery, one auc
tioneer, two civil engineers an I survey
ors, two fiouring-mills, lour music teach
ers, ten lawyers, eight doctors, two den
tists twenty saloons, two lumner
yards, one pJaning-mill, six laundries, one
opera-house, three public balls, three art
studios, six carpenter-shops and finely
lighted, well-seated City Hail, where the
Mayor and Common Council, Board of
Education and fire companies hoi. l their
meetings; also a handsomely fitted up
Masonic Hali, an L O. O. F. Hal 1 . Good
Templars' Hall, besides a large two-story
bricK building erected by the Odd Fellows
of Salinas for the use of themselves and
other fraternal societies.
One of the great buildings of the town
is ibe armory f Troop C, N. G C, which
was formally opened on the 15th of last
October, during which time nearly 2000
people found accommodations within its
wails. It is to-day a monument of enter
prise and is elegantly lute i up for a gym
nasium as well as for an armory.
A marked feature of Salinas is the oros
perity of a number of fraternal societies.
There is a strong Masonic lodge and a
chapter of Royal Arch Masons, an Enst
ern Star chapter, two Odd Fellows' lodzes,
an I. O. O. F. encampment and canton,
Rebekah degree lodge, Good Templar
lodize, Independent Fores ers' court, par
lor of Native Sons of the Golden Wist,
council of the American Legion of Honor,
council of Chosen Friends, Ancient Order
of United Workmen, Grand Army post,
court of Foresters of America, Knights of
Pythias, Young Men's Institute, Dania,
Women's Christian Temperance Union,
Athletic Club Association and oilier like
â¢ocieties.
The town is well represented by the
various raJigioaa denominations common
to the State. There are seven church
bnildincs now and others are under way.
The foll"Winpr denominations are repre
sented: Uni ed Presbyterian, Methodist
Episcopal, Presbyterian (Central avenue).
South Methodist, Baptist, EDiscopal and
Catholic. There is also a Danish Luther
an congregation, a congregation of Free
Methodists and a Salvation Army barracks.
Salinas has excellent Dublic schools.
Their superiority is attested by the ex
tremely smal^ percentage of the scholars
who attend private schools. Students
from the High School may enter tne State
university without further examination.
There are three school buildings hereâ,
the High School, in the western part of
town; the East End School, in the east
ern portion of town, and the primary
building, which is located near the center
of town. Fifteen teachers are now em
ployed and there are about 800 pupila en
rolled.
Salinas is amply supplied with gas,
water and electric light. The incorporated
company supplies these great necessities.
The water is pumped from wells 150 iÂ«Â»et
deep Into great reservoirs placed forty-five
to seventy-live feet above the city grade,
and from which water-mains extend all
over town. Hydrants connect with the
mains along the principal streets for tire
purposes. It costs a private lamily on ah
average acout $1 per month for water.
Many persons have wells and windmills
of their own. The water comes from a
stratum of coarse gravel and is of excel
lent quality.
Two parks are owned by the city, and
they constitute an element of beauty that
the people fully appreciate. One of them,
Sherwood Park, is on the east side cf the
Santa Rita road about a mile from town,
and is sixty acres in extent, including
the fair grounds. It contains numerous
eucalyptus and cypress trees large enough
fur Bhade, also a good well, tank and
windmill and a stand for celebrations,
picnics, etc. The other is called Central
Park, and is pleasantly located on the
north side of Central avenue. This park
has not yet been fully improved, but it is
destined to be a principal place for reciea
tion ere many years.
A narrow-ttauge railroad connects Sa
linas with Watsonville by way of Mots
Landing on Monterey Bay. Toe South
ern Pacific from San Irancisco runs
through Salinas to a point not far from
f-'anta Barbara. When completed this
will form another overland route and a
short cut to the Santa Barbara region. It
is believed also that a railroad will soon
be built acro-s the country from the San
Joaquin Valley, through Salinas to Mon
terey. With these great transportation
facilities, and surrounded by thu rich ag
ricultural lands of the great Salinas Val
ley, the resources of the Gabilan range- on
one side and those of tne Santa Lucia on
the other, Salinas City cannot fail to be
come a v>'ry important trade center and
one of the finest business localities in the
State.
As a commercial center it is certain that
there are very few cities of its size which
attract the trade that Salinas commands.
More than 1000 square miles of fertile ter
ritory pour their produce into this thriv
ing little city of 3500 inhabitants in ex
change for the necessaries of life, while
those who inhabit an area of more than
3000 square miles depend upon this town
for wagons, plows, harrows, mowers,
rakes, threshing machines, headers and
hundreds of utensils used in agriculture.
Food and clothinplsupplies are sold in
lar o quantities and at remarkably low
figures.
It is wonderful what resources of cattle,
hogs, wool and dairy products are annu
ally added to this county's wealth from
the rich acres contributing to this city's
prosperity.
Superintendent W. C. Waters, who has
charge of the construction of what will be
the world's greate-t sugar fa tory, is now
Bait arranging for ttie manufacture of
b >ilera that are to cost $150,000, to be used
fur the monster engines that will drive the
machinery that is to make this region
prosperous and known the world over for
its produc s.
"On Mr. Waters' return," said Reai
Estate Agent Lang a few day* ago, "which
will be in about a month, work wII begin
in earnest. It will require 12,000 tons of
reck for the foundations of the buildings,
and all this has to be obtained at once.
Then a railroad seven miles long is to be
built to th- limerock quarries, which will
supply 6000 tons of lime per year for the
factories here. All this means work, and
when it begins the town will feel the good
effects oi the revival in business."
The site of the. factory is to-day an im
mense and fertile Held. The buildings are
to be picturequeiy located four and a half
miles soutbeas: of this town, on the banks
of the Salinas River. On three -idt-s lie
the rolling plains of t c rich valley, while
immediately south and just across the
river Mount Toro begins its ascent from
the gen le valley and rears its head 3100
feet above the quiet hiiis below. Within
the shadow of this mountain the great
buildings will stand as monuments of
human ingenuity and commercial am
bition.
It will be a year before the great factory
will be linisned. Fully 600 men will be
required to do the building wit in that
time, and when the. factory is in operation
from 600 to 700 men will find steady occu
pation within its walls or about the great
shipping yards. Three miles of switches
wiJi be necessnry to carry on this truffle.
Wh le the eyes of the commercial world
are on the great schemes now going for
ward here the people are enthusiastic over
the outlook and proud of their town. Just
ahead they see betters times and greater
importance tor their town, meantime
trudgin/the streets busy with their own
affairs, dreaming now and then of a future
filled with sunshine and gold.
F. H. Lang an i others at the head of
the proposed electric-car line to run to the
great beei-sugar factory, have called a
meeting for tne comin_> events.
''It is our purpose to raise the additional
$25,000 required," said Mr. Lang to-day,
"and it is almost positive that the cars
and the road will be owned by a citizen
company."
This means good news for Salinas and
almou certainly . uarsr, tees that the town
will have a population of suOo or 6000
within the next twelve months. It means
that the two or 700 workmen who will be
employed at the factory will live here, and
it means that the town will take on a new
and rapid growth in the direction of the
great enterprise.
It has recently been estimated that the
new factory will be able to utilize the crop
from 100,000 acres ol lard. Though the
beet product of only 30.000 acres can be
used eHCii year, yet the land must have a
rest. In this way 100,000 acres will be sul>
|Â«et to sugar u-es. li is the intention of
the company to lease 20,000 acres in small
holdings to suitable tenants.
The capacity of the factory will be 3000

BORROWED MONEY
ON OTHERS' LAND
Two of a Conff deration of
Swindlers Caught at
Los Angeles.
Negotiated Loans by Forging
Signatures to Worthless
Mortgages.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 13.â A
big land swindle has been nipped in th
bud by the arrest of at least two of tb
prime operators in the fraud and for erie
by which the transactions have been fa
cilitated. One of them is William Clark
lons a resident of Florence, in this county
and the other is a woman who gives th
name of Harriett Douglass. Clark wa
arrested on March 10. The woman wa
taken into custody this forenoon in a
lodging-house on North Main street.
Clark, wo is at the head of the schemes
has several confederates. His moda o
procedure was as follows:
He lirst ascertained the names of non
resident Droparty-owners of this county.
Ha then ascertained whether there was any
valuable property be'ongine to non-resi
dents which was unincumbered by mort
gage. In hia search of the county records
he ascertained that Mrs. Harriett N. Doug
lass, a resideut of New York State, owned
considerable property in this county.
About ten days ago he applied at the Title
Guaranty Trust Â« ompany to negotiate a
loan on a piece of property in the name of
Mrs. Douglass for $2500, uffering to give a
mortgage on the property as security for
a note.
Tbe loan was made, but it was after
ward discovered that irregularities ex
isted and an investigation disclosed the
cleverly disguised fraud.
The arrest of Clark and the woman fol
lowed. SDe was identified by Sam Prager,
a notary public before whom the acknowl
edgments of both herself aud Clark were
taken. After being taken to the city jail
the woman made a full confession, but
she stated that she did not know she did
wrong in signing her name to the deed.
She is about 33 years of age.

VISITED SPRING
VALLEY'S LAKES
Mayor and Supervisors
View Sources of Water
Supply.
Guests of the Water Company
and Mr. Â£chuss!er lor
One Day.
Incidentally Supervisor Rottanzi Dsm
onstrated That He Can Ou jump
the Mayor-
The Mayor and the Board of Supervis
ors yesterday inspected (he great artificial
lakes in San Mateo County that are the
sources ol this City's water supply.
They started from here on the 8:15
o'clock train, and until their return
shortly before 6 o'clock in the evening
were the guests of the Spring Valley
Water Company, Chief Engineer Schussler
acting as personal host.
It was not * rigorous official inquiry,
but rather a delightful outing with a most
palatable luncheon and a thirty-mile
drive along picturesque roads skirting
surprising stretches of clear, placid water
cached between two parallel rows of hills,
the one hign and heavily wooded and the
other lower, grass-covered and dotted with
live oaks.
The train made a special step a mile
east of Belrfont to let the party off at the
pumping station, now and for two months
unused Decause of the winter muddiness
of the creeks of Alameda County, from
which a certain amount of water is usual- j
ly obtained througn a double submarine j
pipeline that crosses the bay near Menlo
Park. After viewing the big si ent ma
cftinery and listening to some interesting
technical explanations of it and of some
part cularly duraoie valuable aopliances
the company, numbering twenty persons,
including the City officials, the engineers,
and press representatives, took possession
of seven livery conveyances and the drive
began back to San Maieo and thence up
into the hills to the great Bam that spans
a canyon and holds behind it 19,000.000,000
gallons of water.
How much water there is back of that
towerine wall of concrete is little suggested
by the first view, thougti yesterday tne
overflow alune formed a rushing moun
tain s ream that clashed ilown tha canyon
up which the road leads to the base of the
dam. Pouring in a thin, foamy sheet as !
wide as a San Francisco street, tne ex
cess water raced and tumbled down tire
slightly sloping, smooth wail for a fall of
115 feet, for anch is the height of the
masonry. This mammoth mass of soiia
concrete and the work upon it cost just
$2,000,000.
It holds in check a volume of water
eicht miles Jong, perhaps on an average
half a mile -ride and sixty leet deep â
enough water, were none other nvailable,
forever two years to supply San Fran
cisco's every need during the entire time.
The overflow at present, because the
great reservoir is filled to tbe maximum,
is 50.000,000 gallons a day, something
greater than 30,000 gallons a minute.
And yet the loss i-> beneficial, as it creates
action and prevents stagnation in a great
body of water.
This is all from Crystal Springs reser
voir, fed by a watershe i area of twpnty
four square mile', ui>on which no horses
or catile are allowed to roam, lest the
wnter be contaminated. In it are count
less black bass and mountain trout.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 14, 1897.
The water for this Ciiy ts drawn off
from the bottom of a hollow concrete
tower, standing out in the lake and
reaching above the surface. It iÂ«
furnished with three gates, 40, 80
and 120 feet from the bottom of the res r
voir. Daring the roily water period of
winter the upper pa c is opened and a
surface supply is drawn off, but during the
summer, when thtÂ« surface water becomes
heated and less Iresh, the bottom gate is
opened.
Driving by an easy winding grade to
the toi> of the reservoir, the party crossed
the dam on the planked roadway, and fol
lowing for live miles the border of thelake
came to the directors' ciubhonse, a simple
but comfortable little affair, where
luncheon was served. Engineer Schussler
made an excellent clam chowder, and two
of the company's carpenters proved them
selves good cooks.
Before luncheon Mayor Phelan chal
lenged Supervisor Clinton to a jumping
match. They chose a favorable incline
and soon cast aside coats and hats for the
contest, but before they had gone much
beyond the six-foot mark Supervisor Mor
ton entered the event and Supervisor Britt
followed.
Then came Supervisor Rotranzi, just re
turned irom an attempted row in a leaky
boat near by. His first jump was a poor
one and he excused himself, with the re
mark that be had seen better days, but
now weighs 202 pounds.
Again and again he jumped, eaoii time
doing a little better, until the discom
fited Mayor, the smallest one of the con
testants, had to acknowledge himself
beaten, while the elated Dr. Rottanzi
strutted abuut gleetully declaring that
"south of Market street" held the cham
pionship, and he even went so far as to
challenge Supervisors Sneehan and Has
kins, who just then arrived in a carnage,
having missed the earlier train from the

At luncheon Mayor Phelan, not yet
recovered from hi 9 festive athletic turn,
bet Dr. Clinion $20 to $15 on the prize
fight, taking Corbett and the Dig end.
Dr. Clinion immediately made a similar
bet with Dr. Morse.
On the homeward drive San Andreas
reservoir was visited, li holds at present
4,000,000,000 gallons. There was not time
to visit the JPilarcitos reservoirs, further

Emerging finally from the picturesque
hills the procession of carriages stopped
at San Bruno, there to await the train for
the Ciiy.
Every one seemed content with the
prospect and the condition of the waters,
and Mayor Phelan remarked that tho pity

The Board of Prison Directors Consider
Application for Parole.
At a regular meeting of the Board of
Prison Directors yesterday, at the request
of Director Wilkins, the sentence of death
arainst the Cummings brothers was prac
tically commuted to imprisonment .for
life. Wilkins brought the matter before
the board, after which it was considered
by the directors. The idea was passed
upon favorably and it was understood
Governor Budd will indorse the action.
The Cummingsea were sentenced from
R versidc for the murder of C. T. Marra

the story according to State evidence. In

N;W Era for Poor Jack
The twelfth anniversary of the organiz
ation of the sailors' union was celebrated
last evening in a fashion that aiu-t leave
a strong and favorable impression among
ail who witnessed it. Formed in four
companies, bearing torches and dressed
in neat uniforms the sailors marched
from their headquarters on East street
through the principal streets and back to
the headquarters. In front of the lumber
yard on East street where the organiza
tion was effected twelve years a^o the
men stopped and gave three rousing
cheers.
Then they moved -on to the headquar
ters, at the corner of Mission stieet. The
proces-ion was headed by v band and
made a fine appearance. It was under
command of Ed Anderson, crand mar
shal. The advance guard was com
manded by Ed Lundstrom, and the four
companies were commanded by: Frank
Johnson, First; R. Sandberg, Second;
Thomas Finneny, Third; F. Joranson,
Fourth.
The American flag was conspicuous, as
were also a number of transparencies,
Dearing pointed mottoes, as for instance:
"The United States Supreme Court construes
the laws; the people make them. *We carry
our case up."
"The people are with us."
"We never give up the ship."
"You require us in peace and war."
"We demand the right to own ourselves: our
cause is thÂ» cause of all American citizens."
"In 1862 Lincoln proclaimed all persons free.
In 1897 the Un ted States Supreme Court de
clared the s*>amnn a serf.' 1
"In 1856 Bred Scott decision; reversed by
the people 18(51-65. In 1897 Arago decision;
will be reversed by the people."
"In 1790 fugitive sailor la*w passed. In
1793 fugitive slave law passed."
"Shoulder to shoulder ior sailors' rights."
â We are the connecting links of commerce."

"In the name of the Sailors' Union of the

the celebration of the twelfth anniversary of
the organization of ihe 3ailors' Union. On
ihe night of the 6th of March, 1885, in tne
lumber-yard at Folsom and East streets, the
Sailors' Union of the Pacific Coast, in the rain
and by the lkht of a candle, made its dec
lnrntlon of independence. We have been
sieiHtast ever since. Although we follow thr
sea we fire men, and we have gathered here to
celebrate the forming of an organization that
proposes to see sailors' rights preserved."

appearance and orderly conduct of the

men. Especially he complimented Cap
lain Lidstrom and his advance guard, ;i ; l
of which was heartily responded to. He
then introduced W. Mac Arthur, editor of
the Coast Seamen's Journal, as chairman
of the meeting.
The chairman said they had come
together to take their soundings as an
organization and would tnen square away
lor another year's voyage. He had pre
dicted a year .-140 that the seamen would,
in the year following, gain a victory, and
in the practical defeat of Senator Frye's
bill (in having amended away its objec
tionable features) ana in defeating tne
proposed repeal of the Maguire law, the
victory had been gained.
He read a communication from Secre
rary Andrew Furuseth, now in Washing
ton, concerning the Supreme Court de
cisions in the Arago case, which tie said
was the most terrible in its import since
the Dred Scot decision.
Alfred Fuhrman was introduced as the
first si eaker. Now a practicing attorney he
was once a sailor before the mast and was
one of the charter members of the union
and one of its earliest officers. He drew a
sharp comparison between the days of i
1885 and those of 1897. In the early days i
no Mayor took ran in their meetings, no !
United States Senators sent messages of j
encouragement, but the policeman's club
continually rattled about their heads for
daring to assert a claim to manhood.
They were alone and friendless. With
such odds against them they overcame ob- j
stacles until now they are iti a position
commanding respect and demanding their
rignts.
For this result he cave the chief credit I
to their newspaper â the Coast Seamen's
Journal.
Thomas Nayior, also a charter member
of the union, made a brief address, telling
the saiiors not to forget the flag, and con
cluded with a comic sons;.
James H. Bsrry was warmly applauded
when he was introduced. He took excep
tion to Mr. Fuhrmau's statement that
there was any lime when the sailors had
no friends. Tha sailors had stanch friends
who were willing to stand up for
them as soon as they were willing i
to stand up for themselves. God helps |
those who help theniseive-i. Friends Irsd
increased in number as the seamen had
fought for their own cause. Friends had
arisen in the halls of Congress for poor I
Jack, led by California's little giant, James (
G. Maguire. Times were changing, he I
said, aad the sailors, faithful to their
union, would see the time when they
would no longer be called poor Jack, but j
would be called rich Jack â rich to the
strengh of their manhood. He took oc
casion to very sharply criticize the Police
Department.
The patrolmen, he said, were generally
honest men, but bis criticism, he said, was
directed at the head of the detective de
partment. He bade the sailors to be of

Thomas H. Mathiss read a couple of
pretty verses of h>B own composition,
ur ?ing the union "onward."
Hermann Gu:stadt made a telling ad
dress in which he declared the strength of
the Seamen's Union was the wonder of all
trades unions. The nature of the work of
the seaman, calling him here to-day and
away to-morrow, made it appear impos
sible to those who understood trades
unions that they could succeed in form
ing much less maintaining a successful
union. In having done ?o the Coast Sea
men's Union- had done more good for
labor throughout the world than any
other one union that he knew of.
Thomas Naylordid some more clever
and warmly anplaudea songs and recita
tions and then the acting secretary of the
union, L. Hoey, made a brief address, in
which he said the union was at work and
would never gait until that work was
done.
Rousing cheers were given for the
union, for the speakers of the evening and
for the secretary of the union, Andrew
Furuseth, now in Washington working
for the sailors' interests there. The meet

THEY RISE TO
BLAST HEARST'S
"NEW JOURNALISM."
His Eastern Paper Is Kicked
Out of the Princeton
University*
THE GREATEST LIBRARIES AND
SOCIAL FORCES RALLY TO
THE CRUSADE.
In Sudden and Mighty Concert the Moral
Powers of the Land Smite the
Hearst-Born Dragon*
The most remarkable thing in the history of journalism and one of the most
remarkable moral movements of the age is the great and daily accelerated uprising
East and West against Hearst journalism. In the East it has within a few days
become a vast and sweeping tide.
Hearst's New York Journal has within two weeks been kicked out of the great
and ancient Apprentices' Library. New York, out of the Public Library at Newark,
New Jersey, out of Princeton Theological Seminary, out of Dwight Hall, Yale
University, out of the public libraries of Bridgeport, Conn., Ansonia and
South Norwalk, and out of the reading-rooms of the biggest branches of the
Y. M. C. A. in New York. The New York World has been kicked out with its
unclean rival.
After these fleeing Ishmaelites of journalism are being hurled the curses of the
decent men whose duty it is to protect these fountains of intellectual and moral truth
from pollution.
The action of the trustees of the Newark Public Library, which was unanimously
taken at a regular meeting, was mentioned in THE CALL two or three days ago, as
was the exactly similar action taken by the trustees of the Portland Public Library
with reference to Hearst's other criminals' gazette, the San Francisco Examiner.
Apprentices' Library of New York.
Newark Public Library.
Princeton Theological Library.
Portland Public Library.
Yale University.
Bridgeport Public Library.
Ansonia Public Library.
South Norwalk Public Library.
Y. M. C A. of New York and Watertown.
There is deep significance in this list, though it is short. These are strong and
representative library institutions. Library institutions represent the best of the
character and taste of a community. Those who control such institutions formulate
the wishes and reflect the sense and virtue of the general average of the patrons.
The New York Journal and World have also been kicked out of the Century
Club, the Harvard Club, the Union Club, the New York Club and the New York
Yacht Club, all of New York City.
The Montauk Club of Brooklyn has excluded the World, as has also the Y. M.
C. A. of Watertown, N. Y. The Journal was never allowed to enter them. Many
other public and semi-public institutions and schools, and even hotel news-stands,
have put these papers under the ban of public condemnation. In many cases these
" yellow " journals are simply put out of sight and handed out by the custodian on
special request, as is done in libraries with certain unclean works of historical value.
New York Club.
Century Club.
New York Yacht Club.
Union Club.
Harvard Club.
Montauk Club.
The chief significance lies in the fact that the action of these institutions means
that a new and "great movement in behalf of public morality and social order in
this country has just begun, and it is gathering momentum each day. There has just
appeared amid the great strivings which the Nation is watching an uprising against
the excesses of this "new (!) journalism âagainst this Hearst-born journalism,
which is the latest great abnormal development of the newspaper world.
This has just now become one of the great movements of the day which is worthy
oi studious watching. It is an entity, and different and apart from all the criticisms
and denunciations of the press, which have so long been flying from pulpit, rostrum
and study tables. These have been sporadic. They were the preliminary mutterings.
This is the natural history of reformations. Men here and there shout long and
unheeded. Then one day come the mighty blows that drive and crush and build
anew. The philosophic historian will doubtless in the future treat of this strong
and general uprising against an outraging of the public moral sense and the liberty
of the press as a new and notable social force which appeared at this time, measur
ing the strain which the average public sentiment could stand and having a definite
effect on one of the greatest social influences of the day.
The extent and verity of this strong rebellion against "Hearstism" is just
being perceived. The action of these institutions of learning is only one manifesta
tion of it. In the New York Legislature there is pending a Dill prohibiting any news
paper from publishing a person's picture without his consent. In the Arizona Legis
laiure a bill now pending is so stringent that it has been described as a bill making
it a felony to publish a newspaper, and here is our own California Legislature
engaged in jailing Mr. Hearst's "managing news editor" for ruthless and wholesale
libel. And all this is a development of three or four weeks.
New York Legislature.
Arizona Legislature.
California Legislature.
Educational institutions and State Legislatures rising in the four quarters of the
continent to protect good citizenship from "new journalism !" Shades of Addison
and De Foe ! Shades of Franklin and Greeley I
That list of libraries is not long, but is growing daily. There are others,
and there will be others, but there is a relevant point of interest to note. The list
cannot become very long, because the New York Journal has never gained an entry
into the great majority of libraries. Library reading-rooms in even third and fourth
class cities make a point of having from one to a half-dozen representative New
York dailies. Glances at a large number of library reports for 1896 show that while
the Herald, Sun and Tribune are nearly always taken the Journal appears with
great rarity, and the World is but slightly more popular. So the New York Journal
is only being kicked out of the few libraries into which it was ever allowed to enter.
The men who are the head and front of this new crusade are not cowled saints
and cloistered "goody-goodies." They are mainly strong, honorable, respectable
and intelligent men of the world, with average respect for the good and average
sense of human rights and what protection society needs. They are members of
legislatures and members of the governing boards of public and semi-public institu
tions. Besides, the decent press of the country and decent citizens generally are in
the ranks and giving force to the movement.
The expressions that are pouring forth in condemnation of the Hearst type of
journalism would fill volumes. Strong and prophetic words are the following by
Rev. Dr. William C Roberts of Princeton Theological Seminary:
" Princeton is extremely conservative, and would not have taken this action
without good and sufficient cause. I think the example will be productive of much
good, as educational institutions will now take the matter up. Other religious bodies
will also fall in line. People cannot take such papers home without danger. If some
concerted movement could be inaugurated to suppress these examples of 'new jour
nalism* it would be a grand thing, and I, as well as other ministers, will say 'Amen '
to any effort to accomplish this."
From the Apprentices' Library of New York comes this explanation and declara
tion by C. C. Alexander, chairman of the reading-room committee :
"We have excluded both the World and Journal from our reading-room, because
we have concluded that neither of them contains the kind of literature we care to put
before our members. We do not wish to disseminate this sort of reading matter.
"Far and wide 1 find that there is a wholesome sentiment growing in opposition
â¢to it I have occasion to learn what is going on in many large institutions, and in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 14, 1897.
all of them I have found the same feeling of repugnance. In our library we take the
same ground practically that was taken by the officials of the Newark Public Library
in excluding these papers. In short, we have no use for them, and have, therefore,
taken them off our tables."
The New York Society for the Prevention of Vice has not yet taken any formal ac
tion regarding W. R. Hearst's "new journalism, I ' but at a recent meeting under the
auspices of the society in Carnegie Hall Rev. W. H. P. Faunce, pastor of the Fifth
avenue Baptist Church, boldly put forth applauded sentiments which well ex
pressed the average sentiment of men. Among his words were the following :
"There is a fierce struggle going on to-day between reputable and truthful jour
nalism on the one side and what calls itself the 'new journalism,' but which is really
as old as sin itself. The newspapers in this metropolis penetrate every hamlet and
village between the tv o oceans. If our journals were united in the defense of evil,
our task would be almost hopeless; If they were united in the defense of good, our
task would be well nigh needless. But now the journalism of our time is a house
divided against itself, and therein lies our opportunity. Let every man who respects
himself, who loves his country and his home stand by, cheer and encourage and sub
stantially support those journals which to-day are standing for truthfulness in the
reporter's pen, honor in the editorial chair and honesty in the business office. (Ap
plause.)
"One journal, published in this city daily, which fears neither
God nor man, before whose natural propensities no manhood is be
yond attack, no womanhood is secure, and no childhood is safe, has
recently been excluded from the public library in the city of Newark
by the unanimous vote of the management. Would to God that all its
kith and kin might be excluded from every library and every home
where American childhood is permitted to enter!
"New journalism. They call it new? It is old as the orgies of Nero on the
Tiber; as old as the nameless vice of Pompeii, that God burned and buried beneath
the hissing lava out of the wrathful throat of Vesuvius. It is as old as the shame
of Noah and the murder of Cain, and the man who daily introduces it into his home
is opening up direct communication between the cradle and the sewer, between the
nursery and the poisonous swamp, and the result is the immediate introduction of
moral typhoid into his family.
"Is it of any advantage to us to have the suicide of some embruted wretch pre
sented to us with the picture of the man at the moment he takes his hapless life ?
It is simply an attempt to fill the private purse by public ruin, to make life hideous
and degraded, and to poison the wells out of which the Nation must drink.
"All honor to those journals in our metropolis which are launching their broad
sides against this thing. Success to their work, and let every honorable and
reasonable man stand by them."
A famous triumph is Mr. Hearst's "new journalism." "What a great ad
for me and my paper!" cries he.
An inscrutable wisdom provides uses for all things and Mr. Hearst has afforded
a time and a measure to sound the moral sense of the American people anew.
ENGINEERS AND
PILOTS NECESSARY
New Regulations Regard
ing Gas and Naphtha
Vessels.
Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers
Receive Imp:rtant In
structions.
An Act of Congress That Affects a
Large Number of Craft Plying
oi Tins Coast.
The United States SuperTising and
Local Inspectors of Steam Vessels have
just been notified by ttia Treasury De
partment of important amendments re
cently passed by Congress to the statutes
relating to vessels propelled by gas, fluid,
naphtha or electric motors).
Hitherto it has not been necessary for
vessels propelled by the means men
tioned to have licensed engineers or
pilots, or to observe the regulations that
pertain to steam vessels. As a conse
quence a large numbir of small vessels
operated by gas and naphtha have come
into use, the cost for both help and fuel
bsine far less than that of steamboats.
On January 18 the following act of Con
gress was approved :
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled : That all Tea
sels of above fifteen tons burden carrying
freight and passengers for hire, propelled by
gas, fluid, naphtha or electric motors, shall be
and are hereby made subject to all the pro
visions of section 4420 of the Revised Statutes
of the United States relating to the inspection
of hull:- and boiler-, and requiring engineers
and pilots; and all vessels so propelled, with
out regard to tonnage or use, shall be
s abject to the provisions ot section 4412 of the
Revised Statutes oi the United States relating
to the regulation of steam vessels in passing
each other, and to so much of sections 4233
and 4234 of the Revised Statutes relating to
lights, fog signals, steering and sailing rules
as the supervising inspectors shall by their
regulations deem applicable and practicable
for their safe navigation.
The Board of Supervising Inspectors
under tne authority of this law Dave
adopted the following regulations in rela
tion to the class of vessels mentioned, the
regulations applying to all the navigable
waters of the United States:
All rule* relating to lights, fog signals,
steering and sailing contained in section 4233,
Revised Statutes, and applying to steam ves
sels, shall ti.su apply to all vessels propelled by
gas, liuld, napbtliaor electric motors, and be
tween any of such ves.sels and steam vessels on
the pacific Coast inland waters, with the ex
ception that the red and green lights on oDen
vessels ofr ten gross tons and under pro
pelled by gas, fluid, naphtha or electric
motors, may be exhibited by a combined
lantern showing a red light and a
green light, as described in rule 13 of said
section 4233, in lieu of all other lights for
vessels under way. When the range and side
lights are carried on such vessels of ten gross
tons and under, the after-rauge light shall nc
carried at an elevation of at least seven feet
above the light at the head of the vessel. Such
vessels of teu gross cons and under, if provided
with a bell six inches In diameter, of good
tone and quality, to be rung by hand in fog or
thick weather, shall be deemed properly
equipped in that respect.
The local inspectors have notified the
owners of a large number of vessels carry
ing freight and passengers on this coast
that their boats must carry licensed en
gineers and pilots, and all violations will
be reported and the guilty parties pun
iÃhed.
The regulations as to lisrhts, fog signals,
etc., apply to hundreds of launches that
are in use on the buy and the streams
emptying into it, and will be of great In
terest to the owners of these craft.
NEW TRIAL FOR EGAN.
Supreme Court Renders a Decision In
a Case Arising From the Klec
tion of 1894.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
decision of the lower court in the case of
James Egan, who was convicted of violat
ing the purity of election law. Five
other election officers were similarly
charged. The Supreme Court held that
the case for the prosecution was circum
stantial, and that while there was a gross
error in the returns, the records show that
the evidence did not warrant the verdict
of guiny. Therefore Egan's petition for a
new trial, which was denied by the lower
court, was granted. The trouble grew out
of trie contest between 0. F. Curry and M.
C. Haley in the election of 1894.
Defaulting Jurors Cited.
Harrison Houseworth and Louis 8. Lissak,
who were summoned to the United States Dis
trict Court to act as Federal grand jurors
and failed to appear, have been cited by
United States District Judge Morrow to appear
on Wednesday, the 17th mst.. and show cause
why they should not be punished for con
tempt.
BLOTTED OUT BY
JUDICIAL INK
Last Hope of the Blythe
Contestants Under a
Cloud.
The Supreme Court Refuses to
Let the Matter Be Carried
Higher.
There Was No Error in the Judgment
and Order cf Distribution of
tbe Estate.
The Blythe contest Is drawing to an
end. By a decision of the State Supreme
Court yesterday Florence, the child of the
late Thomas H. Blyihe, secured a stronger
hold upon the property of the pioneer
millionaire.
As a last stand Chandler, Halladay <fe
Conroy, representing William S. Blythe
and the heirs of James T. Blythe, de
ceased, made an effort to have the case
carried to the United States Supreme
Court.
Tbe petitioners state that the question
they wished to take to the United States
Supreme Court was whether the Superior
Court of California was not utterly with
out jurisdiction to hear the petition for
distribution filed by Florence Blythe for
reason of the fact, appearing upon the
face of her petition, that she was at the
time of descent cast, a non-resident alien
and incompetent to take said property by
descent or to sue therefor.
The attorneys affirmed that the State of
California had no jurisdiction to and did
not confer upon Florence Blythe capacity
or competency to inherit tbe property or
any of it, or to sue therefor in the courts
of the State, and that Florence Blythe
was not authorized, empowered or quali
fied to inherit, take by descent or sue for
the property in question under or by vir
tue of the constitution or tbe laws of the
United States or the treaties made in pur
suance thereof, and that the judgment
rendered in her favor by tbe Supreme
Court of California was and is void.
The lawyers in their petition contended
that the laws of this State, the benefit of
which Florence Blythe claimed and
claim* in this case, were and are of them
selves void, as construed by the State
Supreme Court in this case, and en
croached upon in the construction, tbe
exclusive treaty-making and diplomatic
jurisdiction of the United States, and
that the laws as so construed were and are
repugnant to the constitution of the
United States and the exclusive authority
and power of the Federal Government, in
the respects stated, over non-resident
aliens.
With one strike of the pen Justice Me-
Farland crushed the hopes of the peti
tioners by denying the petition.
This is about the last stage of the case,
as it is not likely that the contestants can
get the United States Supreme Court Jus
tices to lake up a matter that has been
denied in the Supreme Court of this Btate.
INSUFFICIENT BONDS.
George McGregor Deacon Arrested on a
Bench Warrant.
George McGregor Deacon, the â  default

mission merchant, was released yesterday
morning by Acting Police Judge Kerrigan
on $1000 bonds. â ; v,. .-:
Shortly afterward Larzelere appeared
in court and protested against the small
amount â of the â bonds. He said that
Deacon's defalcations would reach the
sum of $15,000 and he thought the bonds
for his release should be increased.
Judge Kerrigan said he was not aware
of the extent of Deacon's deficiency when
he fixed his bonds at $1000. He at once
rescinded that order and iixed the bonds
at $5000. He also issued a bench warrant
for Deacon's arrest. : Deacon was arrested

Allowance of Expenses - for Witnesses.
City and County Attorney Creswell has fur

that ever since 1876 a witness in attendance
upon a trial can bo given an allowance by the
court when necessary for his expenses. If the
witness comes from outside the county or is
poor and unable ito I pay his expanses. ; "In

BritUh Benevolent Society.
The British Benevolent Society during the
month of February expended $169 35 in relief
work, of which $53 50 was for groceries for
families, $25 50 rent for families, $19 75 for
the sick and $42 50 for various nÂ«ctÂ»Mlties.
THE BOULEVARD
SOON TO BEGIN
Ex-Mayor Sutro Signs the
Deed Which Means
So Much.
Over 1200 Men Are Now Reg
istered as Applicants for
the Work.
Subscriptions Continue to Come in,
Largely From Schoolsâ Chinese
Take a Hand.
"On to the boulevard!"
That is the cry of the unemployed, and
soon the hearts of many men will beat
happily as their arms toil away for the
money that means- so much to themselves
and families.
At last ex-Mayor Sntro has signed the
desired deed vow securely reposing in the
vault of the. Nevada Bank. A few pro
visos still stand in the way, but they are
faÃt vanishing. When the last stumbling
block is consigned to the "backward and
abysm of time" the Supervisors will accept
the deed without any redtape and work
will begin.
Practically speaking;, preliminary work
has already begun. Taking six men with
him Mr. Eagan went out to the park yes
terday and made a call upon Superintend
ent McLaren, who pointed out the loca
tion of the wheelbarrows. The men at
once begun putting them in condition for
heavy use. To-morrow mornine construe
tion will begin on the toolbouse.
Work will commence on the Almshouse
road, about 100 feet from the Sutro tract.
The question of transportation is still Riv
ing some trouble, for the men mnst travel
to the terminus of the Haight-street line,
then take the Park and Ocean steam cars,
and finally make a walk of fifteen or
twenty minutes' duration.
The sub-committee, composed of W. M.
Bunker and Messrs. Ellert, McCord,
O'Connor. Bemis and Wheeler, met at Mr.
Be mis' office, 324 Montgomery street, yes
terday. Thomas Eagan was elected super
intendent and Mr. Terrill his assistant.
The wages agreed upon are $1 a day net,
if f ee transportation is eiven by the rail
road; if not, $110 will be pai i. Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald has embarrassed
the company in its work a good deal by
demanding that the men be paid twenty
cents an hour. He seems not to realize
that this is a charitable movement for
which benevolent-minded persons are
working with no desire lor pecuniary
reward, but to thinK that it is to find
regular employment.
i he boulevard fund is rapidly swelling.
The following subscriptions were handed
in to Treasurer Daniel Meyer yesterday:
Pope & Talbot, $50; Buena Vista School
teachers, $6; Rincon Grammar School teach
ers, $13150; Girls' High Scnool teachera.s7 50;
John Sweet Grammar School teachers, $20 ;
Hancock Grammar School teachprs,sl6; Sher
man Primary School teachers, $9; Agassiz Pri
mary School teachers, $3 50.
This makes a total of $7174 subscribed to
date.
Over 1200 men are now registered as ap
plicants for work at the registration head
quarters on the cornerof L*idesdorff street.
They came steadily ail day yesterday.
The applicants belonged mostly to the
laboring class, but there were many men
stepped up and wrote their names iiÂ» a
hand which showed pretty conclusively
that the graphite was no stranger.
One of the applicauts was so strangely
out of place as to be worthy of notice. By
a letter which he submitted for the in
spection of the secretary it was revealed
that he was a Knight Templar who a few
years ago was worth $80,000. His health
failed, his means dwindled away, and
now he is obliged to resort 10 manual la
bor to support his family.
At the old armory, on the corner of
Howard aud New Montgomery streets,
the devil of discord is simply having a
picnic. The members of the old relief
committee, which was discharged by the
majority for making certain charges
against the commissary depnrtment.^are
now saying some very hard things against
the executive committee, and vice versa.
The Tinn Yee Kong Benevolent Society,
a Chinese organization, yesterday sent in
twenty-tive sucks of flour, fifteen sacks of
potatoes, one barrel of corned beef. Sev
eral minor subscriptions were also re
ceived.
The following received their cards from
the committee, which will entitle them to
work on the boulevard Monday, or as soon
as the work starts:
Jerry O'Brien, Frank Ryan, George Ray,
N. Muldoon, James Duff. Alexander Mil
ler, James Clark, M. T. Boyd, N. T. Nes
ter, Joseph Boyan, J. Burger, George
Kirn ball, John Lents, John Ray, Hugh
Killeen, T. J. Scalens.
There was a long-continued and stormy
meeting of 400 of unemployed last night
in tbe main hall of the old armory that
they make their headquarters.
Vice- President Davies, late chairman of
the recently ousted relief committee, had
preferred charges against Leffingwell, the
president of the organization.
He charged him with misappropriating
funds; with depleting tbe commissary;
with want of executive ability, and with
not having done anything to get the men
work.
Leffingwell made a statement in which
be said the old relfef committee had done
much to attempt to harass him and to
thwart the purposes of tbe organization,
and he denied each one of tbe charges.
One temporary chairman, despairing of
maintaining order, resigned and Munn
presided during the remainder of the
meeting.
Leffingwell was put on the stand, while
JDaviea did the questioning As the pecu
liar trial progressed it became evident
that the charges were unfounded and
unfair, but though a good majority stood
firmly by the imperiled president of the
organization, there was a targe enough
number of disseuaionists to form an ef
fective opposition ready and willing for
almost any kind of a change. In this way
the storm and strife was maintained until
11 o'clock, at which hour an adjournment
was taken until 1 o'clock this afternoon,
when the remaining charges will be dealt
with.
FOOTE'S ACTION RATIFIED
Opium Seized at the Instance of
Special Agents to Be
Released.
Treasury Department Te'egrapbs to
That Effect â M jar Moore
Much Displeased.
The immense amount of opium seized
by the customs officials at the instigation
of Special Treasury Agents Moore, Cul
lum and West will be returned to its own
ers as soon as they care to call for it, for
the Treasury Department has bacKed up
United States District Attorney Foote in
his opinion that there is no legal ground
for holding the drug.
The United States Attorney received a
telegram from tbe authorities at Was^*
inKton to that effect yesterday afternoon,
and as soon as Collector Wise has been
officially notifiad of the Treasury Depart
ment's action the opium will be released.
It will be placed at the disposal of H. P.
Davidson, assistant accountant of the
Bank of British Columbia, who figures on
the Custom-house books as its owner, but
who, the special agents claim, is simply
the agent of Quong Fong Tai & Co. and
other Chinese merchants who control the
opium market in this City.
To say that Major Moore is chagrined
at the turn affairs have taken is putting
it m:luly. Encouraged by the first opin
ion ol Attorney Foote, which was to the
effect that if the facts were piesented
there was a Rood case against tne opium
and its importers, the agent bent all his
energies to get the matter in shape. He
worked long and earnestly with his as
sistants, and thought that the filing of an
information against the big consignment
of Davidson was certain.
Then the attorney changed his mind
after looking into the subject more thor
oughly, and the agent's work was simply
so much time wasted.
His comments on the United States Dis
trict Attorney and Collector Wise are
somewhat drastic, but he sees at present
no way out of the difficulty.
IN HONOR OF THE STATE
Native Sons and Daughters
Getting Ready to Celebrate
May 4
A Parade in the Forenoon and a Ball
and Entertainment in the
Evening.
sThe joint carnival committee of the
Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden
West held a busy session last night, at
which considerable progress was made
toward the completion of an .attractive
programme for May 4, "California Day."
The Sons and Daughters will hold a
grand parade in the forenoon, and a feat
ure of this part of the programme will be
ten 01 more artistic floats, symbolizing
the most important events in the history
of the State, the carnival executive
committee having undertaken to prepare
tvÂ« same.
Sol Jacobs, L. Lansing and Mrs. H. M.
Green were appointed a committee of
three to devise some form of entertain
ment for the forenoon of the 4th, in addi
tion to the parade. In this connection a
suggestion was made that tbe Chutes
should be utilized, but no definite ar
rangement was concluded.
An evening dress ball will be given on
the night ot May 4 in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion, the price of admission being $1 for
lady and gentleman and 50 cents extra for
each additional lady.
Mrs. Lena B. Mills of Orincfa Parlor,
with the help of others among the .Native
Daughters, is preparing a series of living
pictures for production in connection with
the ball, Manager Friedlander having
kindly promised to provide the large
frame, lights and other necessary ap
pliances for the purpose in use at the Cal
ifornia Theater. He has also undertaken
to supply suitable talent for the entertain
ment which will precede the ball. The
executive committee will bear the expense
of furnishing tbe music and decorations.
The Southern Pacific Company has
agreed to extend the time for which tick
ets issued to deiegaiej attending the
Grand Parlor at Redwood City on April
26 are available, so that the holders may
remain over the carnival.
At tne suggestion of the executive com
mittee, two more members were added to
that body from the Native Daughters nnd
the Native Sons, in the persons of Mrs.
Mary Tillman, grand president, and Jos
eph K. Hawkins of Pacific Parlor.
The committee then adjourned until
next Saturday evening.
ALARMS THE MERCHANTS
Theaters Buy Their Tickets of
a Chicago Printing*
House.
Will Be Called to the Attention of
the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association.
It has recently come to the knowledge
of members of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association that another big
slice of business that should go to local
hcuses has been diverted to an Eastern
concern, and the matter will be called to
the attention of the organization that has
for its motto "Keep the Money at Home"
at the next regular meeting.
To people unacquainted with the cost of
furnishing tickets for the local theaters
the items of cardboard and printing
would seem small ones, but when it is
known that the tickets cost the play
houses on the aggregate $1500 to $2000 per
month tbe importance of this item of
trade to San Francisco paper and print
ing houses can be understood.
The agent of a Chicago concern known
as the Globe Ticket Company recently
came to this City and made contracts
with the majority of the theaters to print
their tickets. His prices were somewhat
lower than those quoted by local printers,
and he secured the- plum.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation will probably make a deter
mined eftort to bring the trade back to
Ban Francisco as soon as the presentcon
tracts expire, or before, if possible. The
manager of a prominent paper-house said
yesterday that Eastern concerns were
making constant inroads into the busi
ness of local paper and printing houses
because of the prices they quote.
"The local printing-houses." he said,
'"do not seem to understand that they are
cutting their own throats by letting these
jobs go out of San Francisco. The differ
ence between San Francisco and Chicago
prices on this very item of theater tickets
is not very large, and there would still be
a profit if the printers would take the
work at the prices quoted by the Eastern
houses.
"It would not be quite so profitable, but
it would give men work and keep the
money in circulation here. I have no
doubt the association will look into the
matter and see whac can be done, and I
am sure the theaters will be glad to
patronize home industry if the prices can
be arranged satisfactorily."

the medical authorities in general, as well

of his professional career. It is a treat-

America. It is distinctly of his own
origin or discovery, and is the result of a
lifetime of hard worir and persistent study,
diligent research, and scientific investiga-
tions in this and foreign lands. It is
purely vegetable in its composition and
perfectly harmless in its; effect. It doss
not stimulate temporarily, but restores
permanently. During the past fifteen
months it has been tested on more than
six thousand young, middle-aged and old

TWO COMPANIES
SANG IN OPERA
The French Operetta Troupe
Makes Its Local
Debut.
Some Clever Comedians Provoke
Laughter in " Miss
Helyett."
An Excellent Performance of "Fautt"
Is Given at the Matineeâ Albers
as Valentine.
Two entirely different troupes appeared
at the California Theater yesterday and
both won a large share of applause. Grand
opera held the stage at, the matinee per
formance, and in the evening the operetta
company made its San Francisco debut in
"Miss Helyett."
"Faust," the afternoon's bill, began at 1
o'clock, and with judicious cuts and a
shortening of tlie waits it was over before
most of tbe other matinees, although
tbere were two ballets, the Kermess in the
market scene and the Walpurgis Night,
the latter of which is so frequently
omitted.
Tbe Marguerite was Mile. Marthe Ber
triet, who made such a success as Ines in
"L'Africaine." Her voice ia too distinct
ively a light soprano to be perfectly
adapted to the role of the Goethe-Gounod
heroine, for Marguerite is a soprano of
mezzo carattere. In the "Spinning Song"
and the "Jewel Bong," and the long love
duets with Faust the lack of dramatic
force was most noticeable, although she
sang sweetly ana pleasinely. It was evi
dent, however, that Mile. Berthit saved
her powers ior the trying prison scene in
the last act, for she sang magnificently
there, especially in the tinai trio with
fcaust and Mephistopheles, which was
persistently encored in a very ill-timed
manner for the dramatic effect, seeing the
Marguerite had to postpone her death to
oblige the audience, just as she was pre
paring to expire tragically.
An innovation which Mile. Berthet
should abandon as quickly as possible is a
hysterical laugh, which she introduces as
the curtain falls on Valentine's death
scene. One can imagine Calve doin^ that
sort of thing and startling the house into
admiration, but Mile. Berthet's Marguerite
was not traeic enough to warrant such a
grewsome departure as a laugh over Valen
tin Â»'s remains.
Henri Albers, who played Valentine, as
usual carried off the lion's share of the
honors. He was superb both in the mar
ket scene and in the church scene. In
deed he died so magnificently that the
audience showed a strong: disposition to
see him repeat the feat. In his maledic
tion of Marguerite be enunciated much
more distinctly than he has done hitherto,
every word baing as distinct as if he had
been speak. nj instead of singinjr.
Massart is less at home as Faust than
Vasco da Gain a. His voice in the garden
scene sounded slightly fatigued and be
might have been more impassioned in the
love-making, though he warmed to the
work toward the end of the act He, too,
rose to the occasion splendidly in the
prison scene.
M. Javid was tbe most jocose Mephis
topheles seen for many a long day; in
fact, be was altogether such a bon diable
that no onejlookedupon him as the villain
of the piece. His serenade was especially
well rendered.
Andree Savin* sang excellently as Sic*
be! and Mme. Fremaux was an exception
ally good Mart ha, both vocally and his
trionically.
Tbe fine male chorus, which ia one of
the features of tbe organization, came out
strong in the soldiers' chorus, and the
Walpurgis Night was a brilliant tableau.
Mile, de Console.who is as lignt as a bit of
feather down, won laurels in this scene,
and the other ladies of the ballet did ex
cellent work.
"Miss Helyett," which formed tbe even
ing bill, will be remembered as an operetta
by And ran, which was played at the Bald
win about four years ago, with Helen
Bertram in the title-role. It rather
shocked the susceptibilities of local play
goers and never drew well, but in Paris
"Miss Helyett" has been running almost
continuously since its first production.
As given last nignt "Miss Helyett" is a
case of "seeing ourselves an others see
us" with a vengeance. It represents the
American abroad in about the same dis
torted and whimsical light as the British
Lord abroad is represented In "Pra Dia
volo."
No such Americans as Miss Helyett and
"le reverend son pere" ever existed out
side the imagination of untrammeled
Gauls, but they are more amusing than
the diluted Miss Helyett and her father in
the American version.
The absurd and risque little incident on
which tbe play is bafed proved to be
about tbe same in the French as in the
translated edition. There were one or
two remarks made during the course of
the operetta wbicii would excite little
comment in la belle France, but which
are tabooed in polite society on this Bide
of the Atlantic, but taken altogether, the
dialogue in "Miss Helyett," is" not very
different in the French from the American
version.
It was the actors who gave a different
interpretation to their parts. Mme. An
dree Savine, the heroine, was a chic, mis
chievous little creature, who knew how
to use her hands and acted with verve and
dash. In her conversation she affected a
high nasal twang, which was presumably
an effort to talk in French like a "down
East" Yankee.
M. Gaultneil acted James, the Chicago
plutocrat, and gave a whimsically Gallic
idea of the phlegmatic American. Les
pinasse, the leading comedian, is a fin
ished actor, whofgave an unctuous and
artistic interpretation to the role of Miss
Helyett's father. The rest of the cast
was good, especially Mme. Benatiand M.
Manrick, who represented the Senora and
her son-in-law-elect.

PHYSICAL MANHOOD.
Some Points On the Development of True Manhood by
Electricity â Reasons Why Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt Is the Only Sure Remedy for the
Recovery of This Vital Power.
THE FIRST INDICATIONS OF ! A WASTING VITAL
force, the first evidence of a weakness, may mean the total
collapse of all physical and mental vigor in a few years. It is
dangerous to treat this symptom with indifference, to suppose
that it means nothing. It means a great deal. It is the forewarn-
ing of complete exhaustion that is coming, it tells of the result of
past follies, excesses and overexertion of mental and physical pow-
ers. It means that you are beginning to fail, and swift is the
course of destruction once started. Like the serpent's warning,,
it should urge prompt, action. Effective means of checking the
waste and restoring the power lost can be ' found in electricity.
Vital force, animal magnetism; is infused into the failing nerves
and organs from DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT. There
are thousands of vigorous men to-day who owe their recovery
solely to Dr. Sanden's Belt. It gives ; steady, soothing currents
of electricity into the weak parts, reviving the vital powers and
restoring a healthy and vigorous manhood. '
Don't you think you are missing the best part of your life
by living it in misery ; through the want 'of that which makes â 
life a pleasure ? /. . - - - % . . : '.' ':;;.:. ; â¢ , , ]
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt offers you new, fresh proof ; of its
cure s.V* There are no claims of cures made five or ten years ago,
but to-day. Every day brings \ new ones, and right at your doors.
Would you believe it if your 'closest friend confided to you 1
his cure by a certain remedy ? It.is a modern remedy, up to
date, and cures when the old ideas fail. V
' Simple ? As simple as two and two. It is electricity.
"Electricity is life." It is nerve; force. By excesses or errors ;
you waste nerve force, and Dr. Sanden's Belt renews it.
Even electricity is useless if not intelligently - applied. Dr. i
Sanden has devoted twenty years to close study of the nerve and
sexual forces, and even if other belts fail his treatment ; will cure. 4 !
; Cheap, clumsily-made electric belts are like cheap jewelry.
You think you are getting a high- class â â  article at a low price, but
your experience tells you that you pay for twice what you get. â 
; Don't hesitate to : write to Dr. Sanden because at a distance.
Two days from the time you write will bring you an answer with !
full information concerning his wonderful Belts.; Hundreds of !
| people in California have discarded all other treatment and are
now using Dr. Sanden's Electric Belts with pleasing success.
<^A permanent cure is guaranteed or money refunded in all
weaknesses 'of men. : A pocket edition of the celebrated electro-
medical "i work, "Three ; Classes of = Men," illustrated â ; is sent free,
sealed, by mail on application. Every young, middle-aged or

Mail Steamer Z^alandia a
Week Late Reaching
Sydney.
Her Bottom Was Covered With
Barnacles so She Could
Not Make Time.
Caught in Last Week's Ncrthwester
When Only a Day's Sail .
From Port.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
steamer Zealand ia got in yesterday. What
with head winds, heavy seas and a bottom
covered with barnacles, sne had a hard
trip of it on her way to Australia. She
wan overdue at Auckland, N. Z., and as a
hurricane that not only blew down houses
but caused the loss of Ufa on the island
had prevailed just before she was *ue, the
Government otncials were naturally anx
ious about the mail steamer. When she
â was a week overdue Postmaster-General
Bliss thought it was time to take action.
A steamer answering the description of
the Zeaiandia had been sighted near the
Bay|of Islands by the Northern Steamship
Company's Clausman, and the conclusion
was reacned that it was the overdue Zeai
andia. The big steamer Waitangi, belong
ing to the Union Steamship Company.and
the TJpolu were put in commission to
search for the missing liner. While the
two vessels named were out searching the
islands thai; bar the entrance to Auckland
the Zeaiandia steamed in and was at
anchor whÂ«n the Waitangi returned to
port.
The whole cause of the trouble was the
foul bottom of the mail steamer. When
it was found necessary to lay up the Mari
posa the only vessel available to take her
place was the Zeaiandia. Tne latter had
been laid up for months at Martinez and
in consequence her bottom was covered
with barnacles. She was taken to the
sugar refinery for an overhauling and
there the refuse from the oil works made
another coating on the hull. When ready
to sail the vessel was not in a condition to
make ten knots an hour. It was a case of
willy-nilly, however, and as the Mariposa
could not go out the Zeaiandia had to take
her place. <
Alter reaching Sydney the Zeaiandia
was placed on the drydock and ail the
barnacles were scraped off. On the return
trip good time was mada until the coast of
California was reached. Then the north
wester that caused so much trouble among
the local shipping was encountered. Time
and ugain the big ship was buried and
several. of the crew bad narrow escapes.
On one occasion a wave broke aboard that
jiot only gutted the cabin but broke
through the staterooms occupied by thÂ«
purser.and chief officer ana did consider
able damage. All of Friday night the ves
sel was in the trouzh oi the sea, with the
gale blowing forty miles an hour, and
every one of the passengers were seasick.
The steerage steward and one of the
passengers were caught on deck when a
sea broke aboard. They made for the for
ward rigging and escaped with a good
wettin?. The Zeaiandia took a heavy
roll to Dort and went rail under. Another
eea came along and drenched the two un
fortunates.
There was a row aboard before the Zea
iandia reached JÂ»ew South Wales, ana in
consequence four of the men were dis
charged. It was a local fight and every
body on board regarded it as a acrapping
matcb among the sailors.
The work of dismantling the Zeaiandia
was be ; .un yesterday and by next Wednes
day the Mariposa will have her old 2rew
aboard again. The Zeaiandia will then
be taken oack to Martinez ana will re
main there until she is wanted again to
fill a gap in the Central American or Aus
tralian trade. The last occasion on which
she went on the Mail ronte was in Decem
ber, 1890, and on that occasion she made
good time, but was delayed between
Auckland and Sydney owing to a break in
the machinery.
The passengers on the Zeaiandia were:
Sydneyâ W. T. Anderson, A. S. Ginger, H.
Ayrton, E. Reisch, R. B. Bell, L. Leroux, P.

go on the ways to learn extent of damages.
Arrived March 3. British sealing schooner
Agues Mncdonald from Victoria, on account of
having lost the rudder and sustained other
damages.
The German bark J. C. Glade, while leaving
port February 24 for Kahului to take on re
mainder of cargo for New York, went aground
on the Waikiki side ot the channel, between
the first two buoys, was towed off half an hour
later by the tug Eieu, and proceeded out to
sea. When three miles out of port the main
tie ot the- upper topsail was carried away and
the topsail yard came down on a run. The
tipper yard dropped on the lower topsail yard
and both the upper topsail lifts were carried
away. Tne standard of the lower main top
sail yard was bent and as no bracing around
to one side or the other could be done, had to
return to port for repairs. Repaired and sailed
again March 1 for Kanuiui.
'Purser Smith of tbe Manposa is to take
a well-earned holiday next ; month, and
his place will be taken by Mr. Walton, the
popular freight cleric on Pacific-street
wharf.. Mr. Smith will thus have nearly
three months ashore, . while Mr. Walton
will get a deep-sea ran that he has not
haa for years.

known clothier, stating that the men had
been picked up, and; would rejoin; the
schooner on the- fir-t opportunity. Cap

yesterday. Yu Kee formerly kept a dry-

as Yu Kee's stock .was on the shelves.
Finally the stock of dry goods was sold to
a downtown clothing establishment and

better time over the measured mile, and,
in fact, during the entire trip, than any

initial voyage next Wednesday, and
nearly ali the cabin accommodation is

Captain "Pete" Ott, the most popular
pilot, without exception, in San Franci.-co,
is one of the happiest men on the waver
front. His wife presented him with twin
sons a couple of days ago, and now the
pilots are scanning a long list of names
daily in order to be ready for the christen
ine." Mrs. Ott will be about again in a few
days and the proud father vows that the
first outing the youngsters shall have will
be a cruise outside the heads on tne crack
pilot-ooat America.
The latest candidate for Harbor Com
missioner is Major P. J. Harney, the pres
ent Port Warden. The names of Rudolph
Herold, Colin M. Boyd. A. M. Welburn
and Stewart Menziea have also been men
tioned at various times, but the Governor
has not made any selection so tar and no
one knows who will be the Commissioner
to succeed Dan. T. Cole next week.
SOHOOLHOUSrI NEEDED.
Citizens of Sunoysiiie Adopt Regolu
tioni Setting Forth Their Wants.
A mass-meeting of the residents of
Sunnyside took place Friday evening to
take action in regard to batter school facil
ities which were promised them a year
ago. John A. Johnson was appointed
chairman and John Barrett secretary.
Chairman Johnson stated the object of
the meeting and the wants of the district.
The Sunnyside district is growing rapidly.
There are at present twenty-three houses
building and the coming summer will see
Sunnyside outstrip competitors in that
respect. On motion of D. F. WyckofF a
committee of three were appointed to
draft resolutions setting forth the wants of
the people as follows:
Resolved, That we petition the Board of Edu
cation for a new schoolhouse, as the sccommo
dations at present afforded are insufficient for
the requirements of this rapidly growing dis
trict. When the school was first opened on
the 3d of February, 1896, there were twenty
three pupils. Siuce that time the number has
increased to sixty-seven, besides a great num
ber who are obliged to go to other schools out
side of the district, which is very inconvenient
as well as being unpleasant during the winter
season.
We desire to express our appreciation of the
services rendered by Teachers Miss C. F. Rior
dan and Miss Brown, who are doing their
utmost for the welfare of the children placed
in their care.
The resolutions were siened by D. fl.
Wyckoff, C. E. Niles and W. Wilson.
LIABILITY FOR ERROR.
Suit Against the "Western Union Tele-
graph Company.
Justice of the Peace Carroll had before
him a case yesterday involving the ques
tion of negligence on the part of the West
ern Union Telegraph Company in deliv
ering a message at Niles. Some time ago
William li. Ford, according to his testi
mony, had a suit against Code, Elfelt &
Co. of this City. A message was sent to
him by the Western Union Telegraph
Company's lines for the purpose of in
forming him that the hour set for the
bearing of the case was 10 a. m. When
the dispatch reached him it told him that
1 o'clock was the hour. He was not pres
ent when the case was called ana it went
by default. Then the suit heard yester
day, in which Raver was the nominal
complainant against the Western Union
Telegraph Company, was brought.
There was no attempt on the part of
witnesses to deny that there had been a
mistake in the transmission of the mes-
sage, but it was set up that the company
â i pacifically sets forth on all its blanks tfaa
if certainty of accuracy is essential the
mega&ee should be repeated, which was
not done in this case; also that on the
day in question there was a bad break in
the wires owing to bad weather. Justice
Carroll took the case under advisement.
SOUGHT AND FOUND DEATH.
Two Unfortunates Who Committed Sui
cide by Inhaling Illuminating Gag.
Two more unfortunates sought death
and oblivion by the gas route on Friday
night and yesterday their bodies were
taken to the Morgue to await identifica
tion and the verdict of "suicide" that has
bÂ°en rendered by juries in so many cases
of late.
Ernst Huter, whose body wasdiscovered
in a room of the lodging-house at 15 Eddy
street, was a cook, about 37 years of age,
and had recently worked at the Pabst
caie and the Oberon. No cause is known
why he should commit suicide.
Maix Sctiul, a married man, 50 years
old, unscrewed tne gas fixtures in a room
at 222^ Fourth street, where he resided,
to insure a free flow of gas and then lay
down to die. His body was found at an
early hour yesterday morning.
Scbuhl had a wife and three children
in Portland, Or., from whom he had been
separated for several years, and for some
time past had been supported by a nephew
here.

A NEGLECTED DISTRICT.
The Residents West of College Hill
Clamor for Improvement* Which
Are Very Much Needed.
The joint action of Mission Road, Ingle
side and Ocean View Improvement clubs
is being planned with the view of drawing
the attention of the Supervisors to the
necessity ot improving their territory.
Those of the Mission Road petition for
protection against fire. They claim that
not even an alarm-box is located within
two miles from the center of the district,
snd also that there are no hydrants on the
line of Mission road, not to mention the
side streets and avenues running into that
thoroughfare.
Another complaint is that there are no
gas or water mains on the streets
The Ingleside and Lake View Club com
plain of all these evils; and, in addition,
complain of baring neither gas nor elec
tric lights from San Jose avenue to Ingle
side, a distance of three miles, thus com
pelling them either to provide themselves
with dark lanterns or remain indoors on
nights when there is no moonlight.
The Ocean View people came next and
asked for additional fire protection, better
streets and an avenue by which they can
get to the park without having to come
into Valencia and Haight streets, and al?o
a direct opening to the county road.
In conclusion, all join in trying to have
the pound limits extended, that meander
ing goats and cows be debarred the luxury
of destroying their gardens.
They ignore the economical plea on the
grounds that they have been paying heavy
taxes into the City treasury for the past
forty years without getting any returns or
benefits from the same, la difference
and neglect they claim have kept back the
entire neighborhood and prevented people
from build in <: or improving their prop
erty. To provide to meet the greater por
tion of those wants and necessities is now
the aim and object of tha improvement
clubs mentioned.

Mio-aay al A o'clock s. H. Hartley of New York

sities of the country, where he has carried the
message to young men. This will be his first

FOUND DEAD
IN A TUNNEL
Charles Woodhouse Killed
by the San Rafael
Local.
He Was a San Francisco Lock
smith and a Member of the
English Colony.
Mrs. Nye cf Corte Madrra, Who Lis*
Saw the Mai, Says He Acted
in a Peculiar Manner.
Charles A. Woodhouse, a locksmith em
ployed by the Will & Finck Comnany, 818
Market street, was killed, probably by a
train, in the long tunnel nnder McCne's
Hill, in Marin County, Friday evening,
and his mangled body was discovered
yesterday morniue by a trackwalker.
The facts* surrounding the death of
Woodhouse point to a roy.stery, and
the officials of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad say that they believe the man
committed suicide. The relatives of the
dead man deny this and say that Wood
house was in the habit of taking trips into
the country, ami they believe the train
overtook him unawares.
Mrs. Nye, who lives near Corte Madera
station, was the last to see the man
alive. She says that on Friday evening
she noticed Woodhouse walking on tbe
track toward tbe tunnel, and called tbe
attention of her son to the fact, saying
that the 5:45 train from San Francisco
would overtake the man in the tunnel.
Mrs. Nye says she noticed that the msn
was wringing bis bunas and muttering to
himself.
Engineer John Driscoll and Fireman
John Williams wore in the engine on the
trip connecting with the 5:45 boat from
the Guy, and they both assert that they
looked clear through the tunnel and
failed to see any person on the track.
The body when taken in charge by
Coroner Eden yesterday morning was in
a ternbl- condition. Tne head and botb
arms bad been severed from the body and
the features horribly mutilated.
Besides a card containing bis name and
address, 510 a Jones street, there were
found a silver watch and f 1 10 in cnauge.
Superintendent K. H. Shoemaker of tbe
North Pacific Coast road said that tne
coat ami hat belonging to Woodbouse
were found lying; on the side of the tunnel
uninjured. Wuoilhou-e must have been
stanuiiiL' between the uprights in the
tunnel and wnen the train came through
either lost his balance or tbrew himself
before the engine and was killed.
It was learned yesterday that Wood
house left the City Friday on the 1:45
boat to San Rafael. He left a card on the
door of his department in Will & Finck's,
stating that he would return at 2:15 P. m.,
but wbetber tbe message had reference to
Friday or yesterday Mr. Finck could not
say. The deceased, wbo is abont 45 years
of age, told his son and daughter that be
wa-> going across the bay and would not
be back until late in the evening.
Yesterday they received the distressing
news tbat their father bad been killed by
the San Rafael local train. Tbe family
profess absolute ignorance of the purpose
of Woodhouse's trip across the bay.
Those who know him personally reject
the hypothesis of suicide as highly im
probable.
He was a man of quiet habits and re
spected by everybody. His position with
Will & Finck wad an assured one and he
had served the firm for nearly eight year.-*.
He was an Englishman by birth and a
member of Burnaoy Lodge, Sons ol St.
George since its foundation twelve years
ago, and also of St. George's Club. His
wife died three years ago and be has since
lived with his son, a young man of 21,
and his daughter, a girl of 14.
The funeral will take place Tuesday,
under the auspices of ihat society.
WOMAN'S VOTE NEEDED.
sln. Mary Hoffman, Temperance Trans-
urer, So Advocates Check to
Liquor Traflo.
Mrs. Mary Hoffman of Kansas City, Mo.,
grand treasurer of the National Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, now on a
tour of this State, ad
dressed an audience of about 300 women
and some men Friday night in the First
Congregational Church.
Nominally her subject was temperance,
but practically it was woman surf rag â¢ as a
means to the end. Beginning with a dis
cussion of labor and immigration ques
tions, with New York City as a sad exam
ple of corrupt political leadership, where
the illiterate and depraved exert a great
power at the polls, she passed on to the
history of the accomplishments of the
W. C. T. U. and remarked that its success
had ever been due more to Jocal option
than to legislative enactments. With mild
sarcasm and intended humor she came
nearer home in her later comments u\ on
the liquor business and the want of intel
gence and capable interest of many of
those by whose vote the traffic is generally
permitted. She expressed surprise and
regret that cities and towns of California
have an unusually large number of sa
loons. Many were the nods and smiles or
approval from her bonneted auditors and
occasionally a little flutter of applause
would follow some particularly accepta
ble sally. , ..
During her discourse she expressed these
thoughts:
"The great mistake of the lemperp.nce
movement is that it has been carried on
outside the church instead of in the
church. I say don't, go to your halls for
your temperance work; go right into your
churches and carry on the movement
there with Christian* influences.
"We do whatever is expedient, and what
does God think of such noes iois? We
freed the negroes because it was a military
necessity, and we eniranchised them be
cause it was a political necessity. What
we ougn t to do Is from a sense of righteous
ness rather than irom a sense of expedi-
â¢ncy.
"The saloon-keeper is always as srood as

Downed Lincoln II a Nose
for the Oakland
Handicap.
The Cheat Beaten Oat for a
Stake by Speedy Free
Lady.
Rapido Took the Opening Race at Em
eryville at Long Odds-Three
Favorites Successful
The sport at Emeryville was well at
tended yesterday and seven well-filled
events were on the card for the edification
of race-goers. As outsiders in the betting
made themselves quite conspicuous, even
though three first choices did win, it is i
mere than likely that the twenty-one
bookmakers increased the amount of their
bank" rolls considerably.
By far the best race of the day was the
Oakland handicap, at one and a quarter
miles, with the original big cast of entries
reduced to the small number of five.
{Toward S, carrying 108 pounds, landed
the "prize through the superb riding of
Charley Thorpe. The Drown colt was a
1 to 10 favorite in the betting and in a
Avelling drive through the stretch with
Lincoln 11, the second choice, just man
aged to reach the wire nrst by a nose in
the fast time of 2:07?Â£. Had the place
horse not had a hard race on the preceding;
day he would probably have won. Judge
Denny was a poor third.
Free Lady, a smart little miss by Free
Knight from Fauna 111, carried Billy
Magran6's colors to the fore in the racing
a' selling jevent at four furlongs,
for two-year-olas. The Cheat was a 3 to |
* favorite, but Free Lady got away sailing,
and the first choice not being able to
close the gap was downed a length in i
48>Â£ seconds. Thorpe showed improving !
lorm and finished a good tuirri.
Sixteen "does" furnished the lirat bet
ting proposition, lining up for a six and a
half furlong spin. Baron at 3to 1 had a
slight call in the betting over Mulberry.
The latter looked a winner at the bead of
the stretch, but in a drive was beaten out
a head by the 60 to 1 shot R,apido lidden
by Shepard. Podiga was third.
The event following was a "split" of the
opening; run, with fifteen platers facing
the webbing. Lovdai was a6to 5 choice
in the betting ring with Senator Grady
just as .heavily played at Bto 5. The pair
outclassed the field and fought it out. At
the end Sloan had a shade the best of
Thorpe in saddle- work and got the Sena
tor over the line a nose before the favorite
in thp fast time of 1:21%.
The fifth race, over a mile, was the occa
sion for Jockey Slaughter to give an exhi
bition of miserable saddle-work. He had
The leg up on Aquinas, which opened at 1
;o 2 and receded to 3to 5. David, the Bto
."> second choice, was allowed to make the
race and won handily from Lost Girl, a SO
to 1 shot. Slaughter took his mount out
vride at the stretch turn and was beaten
half a length for the place.
A number of bad actors gave btarter |

Witness Chair.

D. M. Del ma? Scores Their Dilatory
Tactics Resorted To on tbe
Eve of ths Trial
Judge Slack's court was the scene of a
most interesting argument yesterday
afternoon in the suit of Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven against the estate of James G.
Fair, deceased.
The discussion arose primarily over the
application made by Delmas & Shortridge
on behalf of Mrs. Craven for the taking of
the deposition of Charles S. Wheeler, who
as attorney for Miss Virginia Fair had
filed a complaint in intervention, alleging
that the so-called pencil deeds are forge
ries and that they were fabricated by a
conspiracy in which Mrs. Craven, Mrs.
llaskins and Notary Cooney took Dart.
O.her matters came np for considera
tion and were handled in masterly style
by the attorneys on both sides of the cade.
Mr. Delmas made it apparent to the
court and to the roomful of listeners that
the sole object of the suit in intervention
was to secure a postponement of tbe trial
of the main case until t..e detectives, pri
vate and public, in the pay of the Fair
estate combine shall have been able to
formulate even more damaging charges
against the witnesses for Mrs. Craven.
It was shown that for some time these
schemers have hoped to secure indict
ments against some of the persons whose
testimony they dread in the civil courts.
But the Grand Jury has hesitated to lend
aid and comfort to this desperate hope,
and delay was desired with the farther
longing hope that the members of the
Grand Jury might be overpersuaded to do
the will of thtse secret and private prose
cutors*.
Mr. Delmas' closing speech was a de
licious bit of sarcasm, and put the mem
bers of the bar in laughing mood. Even
tbe serious-minded Judge could not for-
bear to smiie when he spoke of Mr.
truth of the allegation touching the con
spiracy to forge the pencil deeds. Mr.
Delmas said that he and nis associates
were delighted to learn that there was one
man who pretended to know all abouflhe
making of ihese deeds. The instruments
on their face bear ihe stamp of genuine
ness, but here is a man who says be
knows they are forged. Yet wnen he is
asked to taKe the stand and tell the truth
about them he hesitates and halts and
asks for delay in w ucu to consult authori
ties. For what?
I 3it n6' ea-jary for him to consult au
thorities in order to tell toe truth?
The truth is all that Mrs. Craven's at
torneys ask for now or any time.
These proceedings have been pending
for something like a year and a baif.
Hitherto no person has been brougbt for
ward who professed to definite knowledge
in regard to these deeds. (Suddenly there
Appears Mr. Wheeler, who makes affidavit
that he knows them to be forgeries. He
is the only man on earth who knows these
things, and is asked to take the witness
stand and disclose the whole truth, but
be parleys with the court and pleads for
delay.
This reminded Mr. Delmas of the medi
cal student who was being examined for
nis degree, and the old professor who was
conducting; the case asked him, "What is
life?"
"Well, professor, I did know the answer
to that question, but I have forgotten it,"
replied the youthful aspirant for a physi
cian's diploma.
"Great heavens! What a loss to
science!" exclaimed the professor. "Here
is the only man on earth who ever knew
whit life is and now he has forgotten it!"
So it was witn Mr. Wheeler, said Mr.
Delmas. He is the only man who has
ever professed knowledge of the genera
tion of the pencil deeds, and he has for
gotten or doesn't wish to tell.
This sally on the part of Mr. Delmas
evidently cut to the quick, as also did the
suggestion that Mr. Wheeler ought to un
bosom himself of his precious secret at
once, lest he might meet with some sud
den death and bis fair client tbns lose the
inestimable benefit of jus important testi
mony.
Yet despite all this urging and tbe
spirited challenge of Attorney W. W.
Fo te, who declared that Mr. Wheeler
knows actually nothing of the production
of the pencil deeds. Mr. Wneeler insisted
on a technical point for delay and so wore
on tbe compassion of the court that he was
granted a postponement of several days in
whit h to gather his wits and his authori
ties lor the purpose of meeting the issue.
Mr. Wheeler grounded b; 3 objection to
testifying on the technical ground that
the affidavit of notice was not sufficient in
that it should have sei oat the exact nature
of the testimony it was sought to adduce.
Mr. Delmas said he presumed tbe objec
tion was made on the part of tbe some
what numerous array of counsel who
appear for the intervenors. "I call your
Honor's attention," he said, "to the now
somewhat famous affidavit of Charles L.
Fair, upon which was based the criminal
prosecution of J. J. Cooney. The affidavit
in this case is exactly similar to the affida
vit upon which tbat deposition was based."
Mr. Delmas called attention to the fact
that on an exactly similar affidavit Judge
Slack bad threatened to commit Mrs.
Crkven for contempt if she did not testify.
On that occasion Mr. Delmas bad stated
that he was under the impression tbat
authorities could be fonnd in the New
York cases upon the point, bat the ruling
at that time was tbat the affidavit was
sufficient. "I rely," he said, "upon the
uniform course of conduct tbroughout
these cases, which has now become a
quasi law of th.s court."
Mr. Wheeler presented New York au
thorities wbicli bo claimed wert in lint
with his contention. These, Mr. Delma
replied, were not material to the case.
"Now, if your Honor please," he said,
"what is this case? "We have found out
at last some on- who knowa all about this
case. There have been accusations of
criminal acts which were palpably and
demonstrably false. Such was the state
meat made here yesterday that the depo
sition of Mrs. Craven bad not been ob
tained and could not be obtained.
"Time after time have the attorneys for,
the executors asked for and obtained
continuances in this case. One con
tinuance was granted on the ground of
Mr. Pierson'a absence from the City. At
that time counsel gave their word that
they would seek no farther continuance.
Yet when that continuance was over, in
direct conflict with their promises, they
sought for and obtained another delay,
ana at the expiration of that continuance
they again came into court and were
granted more time.
"We have looked forward to next Mon
day as the time when these slanderers
would be brought to tbe bar to tell what
they Know, and that no longer they would
depend on the vaporing columns* of the
press; and now another delay Is threat
ened by the filing of an intervention by a
claimant to one-third of the properly in
question. When this matter is deter
mined another one of those convenient
offspring will come forward and file his
intervention. Thus it is proposed to con
tinue the matter from day to day, from
month to month, from year to year.
"After all rumors, after all falsehoods,
after magistrates, courts and Grand Juries
had been resorted to we at last thought
these rumors would be brought to the bar
next Monday.
"When to our joy, when to our great
amazement, we found one person in the
City who knew these deeds to be forged)
who knew of tbe conspiracy to defraud
the dead and despoil the livingâ when
we knew there was such an omniscient
being, at soon as we could get the papers
together we said to him, 'Come forward,
tell what you know and let this case slink
away into the criminal courts.' And now
who is it that slinks away and seeks to
avoid telling the truth? Is it us?
"We hope to be able to show when the
time comes what there is in this interven
tion, but we insist upon our rights to take
this intervention now, and upon our
rights we most earnestly ins-ist."
Reuben H. Lloyd in response to Mr.
Deimas said that the statement of Mr.
Dei mas showed the justice of Mr. Wheeler's
contention, as he admitted that the pur
pose of tbe deposition was not germane to
the question of intervention. He denied
that t here was any desire on tbe part of
the plaintiffs to delay the case, and averred
that they would be ready for trial on Mon
day morning. He explained that Charles
S. Wheeler verified tbe complaint from
information as an attorney. He read
copious extracts from the code, which he
represented were defensive of an attorney
swearing to matters of which he has no
personal belief.
W. W. Foote responded to Mr. Lloyd.
He asserted that Mr. Wheeler had not
sworn on information and belief, but had
â¢worn that the statements were true of his
own knowledge. "It is all a broad posi
tive statement," he said. "If Mr. Cnarles
8. Wheeler knows of his own knowledge
tbat this is a conspiracy anaafraui we
want to know it that we may witndraw,
but we don't want Charles S. Wheeler ana
we don't want Reuben H. Lloyd to hide
behind the petticoat of their client to make
such statements as are contained in that
affidavit. We know they bare not the
facts to prove a conspiracy. We don't
want Mr. Wheeler to go upon the stand to
prove these deeds are falsv, but we want
him to swear that he doesn't know any
thing about whether tbey are forged or
not. And we think we are entitled to that
as a matter of justice."
Mr. Wheeler asked permission to make
a personal statement He then stated
that he had verified the complaint as at
torney, following wtiat he considered a
legal and justifiable procedure under the
circumstances. He stated that at the
proper time be was ready to take the wit
ness chair, but be asked time to examine
authoriiies to see what his rigbts were
under tbe dream stances.
"I marvel at the request made by the
witness," said Mr. Delrnas. "Yesterday
afternoon he knew tbe truth and swore to
it. He swore upon his own knowledge
that he knew this was a conspiracy. He
swore upon i is own knowledge that a
fraudulent certificate bad been affixed to
each deed. And now, within twenty-four
hours, he wants time. For what? To toll
tbe truth?
"Let us know what new light has
dawned upon the counsel which has so
changed the character of Mrs. Nettie Cra
ven, whom they once saw as a highly re
spected lady and a iriend of James G.
Fair. What new knowledge have tbey
acquired concerning the pencil deeds since
my friend ReuDen Lloyd brought them
duwn from the mountain, like the great
lawgiver, brought and presented them
with as much dignity?
"It Is Dot necessary for time in which
to read authorities to tell the truth. Now
wo have found the man Knows all about
it let us have the precious truth that lies in
his breast Is it not possible that while
he is looking over authorities some great
calamity might overcome him and Vir
ginia Fair would thus be deprived of the
one man who knows all about it? We are
apprehensive, if tbey are not We want
to know the truth, and we want to know
it quick."
Judge Slack held that the notice waÂ«
sufficient, and Mr. Wheeler would have to
take the stand, but he allowed him until
Monday at 10 o'clock to examine authori
ties, as he had requested.
The motion to Btrike oat the petition in
intervention was then taken up. This
matter is of great importance to tbe
defendant*, as the petition, if granted,
would make the case an equitable one,
and, it was argued, might deprive the
defendants of their constitutional right to
a jury trial.
The motion to strike out the complaint
in intervention was then taken up. Mr.
Delmas, in prosecuting the motion, state!
mat he had no objection to any one inter
vening rightfully, bnt he objected to the
effort being made to obange ihe nature of
tue case after tbe issues on the eve
of the trial had been framed for seven
months. He objected to the tomplaint on
tbe grounds that it did not estabi iÂ«b Vir
ginia Fair's connection wiia James G.
Fair and that it sought to change the
action from one in law to one in equity.
He argued that the only object of the in
tervention was to delay the action, and to
this end only one of the children had
intervened, to the end that the others
might file compl urns one at a time, and
thus almost indefinitely delay the i-sue.
Mr. Wheeler contended that advantage
should be sought on demurrer of the fact
that Virginia Fair bad not been shown to
be the daughter of James G. Fair. Coun
sel indulged in a technical argument upon
the adverse jurisdictions of law and
equity, wh.ch protracted the session of
the court until long after nightfall. Judge
Slack was anxious to conclude the argu
ment so that the trial could go on Mon
day, according 4 to the calendar. The
breadth of the argument, however, was
greater than he had looked for, and ha
will not be able to render his decision until
some time next week, bo the trial will
necessarily go over.
During the course of the argument it
was discovered that a substantial cbange
had been made in the pleadings submitted
by the attorneys for the executors. Mr.
Delmas averred that there had been an
agreement that there should be no such
change, arid he expressed- .his astonish
ment that such a thing had been done.
Judge Slack informed Mr. J)elrua3 that
lie would be granted an opporiunty Mon
day to attack the pleadings if he so de
sired.

LENIENCY A FAILURE. .
Judge Wood X incU That Advice Is Lost
on Incorrigible*.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 13. âJudge
Wood has discovered, after nearly three
years on the bench, that light sentences
are a failure with incorrigible lads. To
day Walter O'Leary and Adam McÃride
were before the Judge. O'Leary has been
In court several times, charged with
jumping trains, tormenting Chinamen
and similar tricks, aud now be is convicted
of stealing lumber. Judge Wool said that
the most difficult prob em he has to deal
with is tbe treatment of such boys. They
do not appreciate leniency as is proved by
the past. O'Leary was sent to jail for six
months. McÃride, who is not so vicious,
was oraere<l to prison for a day and lec
tured concerning his prospects if he met
the Judge again.
Doctors are of opinion that the left leg
is usually stronger than the right.

MYSTERY IN THE
HENNESSY CASE
The Coroner's Jury Says
Hs Was Killed in
a Row.
Stolen Pistol and Burglar's
Tools Now Figure in
the Case.
A Verdict That Throws Suspicion on
a Companion oi Hennessy's
Named Redly.
"William J. Hennessy came to bis death
from a gunshot wound received while in a
row with John Doe Reilly" was the verdict
rendered by the Coroner's jury yesterday
in the case of the shoemaker who was
killed in the St. David's House on Howard
street on Wednesday last.
The verdict was the result of certain
evidence that developed something of a
mystery in the case.
Hennessy was drinking with a number
of companion?, among whom there baa
been disputes over various matters, and
when he went into the ball of the house,
followed by one Reilly, a shot was heard
and a little later Henuessy 's body was
found with a bullet bole in the head.
From tbe stories told by Henneaay's
companions, who were Kittie Shannon,
May McCann, Kittie Donnelly, a man
named Beilly and a man named Webber,
at the time it was supposed that Hen
nessy had committed suicide because of
inability to pay for beer that he had
ordered and was unable to settle for, bnt
subsequent developments have led to a
suspicion that a murder was committed.
Sergeant Donovan of the Police Depart
ment was detailed on the case and found
that there bad been a quarrel in the room
where the party was 'arinking and that a
pistol bad been exhibited.
Henne-sy waÂ» jealous of Eoilly's atten
tions to Kittie Donnelly and had quarreled
with Reilly and taunted him with not be
ing game enough to shoot.
Keiliy staled when taken into custody
that Hennessy had taken a pistol from
his pocket when they bad gone ontside
and said: "1 ought to shoot you, Reilly,
but I guess I will kill myse.f.
Donovan also testified that a punsmith
named Mnlier, whose place on California
street wan robbed, bad identified the pis
tols found in the room and in the hall
as Having been stolen from him. The ser
geant also found a jimmy and other
burglars' tools in the room where the
party held its orgy.
Tne story of the suspects was conflict
ing and they denied all knowledge of what
had taken place in the hall after Hen
nessy and Reilly passed out.
Reilly was booked at the City Prison last
nUht on the chaige of murder.
Thomas Shannon, Mamie McCann and
Ki.tie Franks, who were arrested at the
same time as Reilly, were booked on the
charge of vagrancy.
TWO MOUTHS SINGLE.
Mr*. Quinan Quickly Changes : the
Name She Could Not Drop. ..'â /',.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 13.â 8ooiety
received a surprise to-day by the an
nouncement that Mrs. W. R. Quinan was
married to Lieutenant Flager, U. S. Army,
more than two months ago.
Mr. and Mrs. Quinan gave this county
a surprise last .November when the hus
band applied for a divorce. The testimony
showed that the parties, who are people of
wealth and social prominence, had not
lived happily for some time. Mrs. Quinan
left her husband, went East, refuted to re
turn, and on the ground of desertion her
husband was granted a decree.
' Mrs. Quinan applied to the court for
permission to resume ber maiden name,
but Judge Etlsworib stated that as her

THE BURNT CORK
Will Appear Two Nights
for the Benefit of
Orphans
Many Innovations and Some Rea

Promised.
Ladies of the 0. E. S. Undertake a
BiÂ£ Task With Supreme
â¢ Confidence.
.. 'Oakland Office San Fra.nciscoCall, )
"* 908 Broadway, March 13. J
, t ; The ladies of the Masonic order have
planned a grand entertainment at the
Masonic Temple on behalf of the orphan
â¢> age at Decoto. ' .' ' ' ..
â¢, In making the arrangements for their
Â» programme, which is to occupy next
\ Monday and Tuesday nights, the ladies
**: have adopted an Eastern custom, some
what new on the coast and entirely new
to Oakland. - It is the introduction of a
corps of lady minstrels. The programme
â¢ â  contains the names of twenty-two ladies '<
â¢â¢ who will make jokes and patronize burnt
; Â coffc for the cause of charity, but who are
1 striving to conceal their identity. â¢
_ â¢ fci One of the'chief points of interest in the
- r entertainments will be the disguises' of the
lady jokers. Alex. Rosborougb, C. L.
Pierce, Sterling Carl and Mr. Davenport
are the and men and the other "men" are
the twenty-two ladies, who are just l now
Â°. engaged lv practicing; for . their . first ap
''. pearance,
Mrs, Frank Pierce, matron of the local
lodge of the Order Eastern Star, is in
charge of the entertainment, and with
- her committee is working hard on the
' "programme. All kinds of surprises are
.. promised and the ladies have actually
Â rone so far as to pledge that there shall
i l be some -entirely new jokes. As none of
uiese bonmots have been heard in Oakland
lor many years, this promise of , the ladies
will- certainly attract every lover of a
'? laugh, ia the city. ; ; -
Tne Masonic Home at Decoto is now be
ing tnilt and in order to have everything
in readiness for the reception of orphans
as soon as possible, there is need of a big
increase of the available funds and it is
,'.-. for this purpose that the ladies are work
Â° ing.
"This idea of lady minstrels," said Mrs.
Pierce to-day, "should prove a decided
hit. It nas been tried with, success in the
East and has even been given in churches
there.' The lades are working hard, but
they are very nervous about the public
,â¢ â¢ discovering just who they are. In the
programme they appear as Maria Snow
ball, Cpalblack Beauty, Hannah Lamp
black, Black Patti, Sadie Gumbo and
similar characters. * Â«
"Some of the costumes of the ladies will
â "â  be original and startling, and, in fact, we
are doing ail in our power to give an exhi
bition that will be decidedly unique, be
cause we want our efforts to be thoroughly
Â. â appreciated and patronized, so that the
orphanage will be material benefited."
MUNHAIL AS A CYCLIST.

PRINGLE OR HEITMAN.
Keen Struggle for President o
the Council, With Even
Chances.
The Eleventh Ccnnc lman Will De.
cide tbe Matter by His
Vote
Oaslasd OrricK Saw Fkahcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 13. (
All kinds of complications are arising
and all kinds of combinations being madÂ»
in the struggle for the two offices within
the gift of the new administration which
WILLIAM B. PRINGLE, the Youngest Member Ever Elected to
the Council, Who Aspires to Be President.
will assume command of the city govern
ment next month.
The struggle for the presidency of the
council is just now very interesting. W.
B. Pringle, the youngest member of tbe
board, has five votes, William Heitman
also has five, and there is a warm contest
for the eleventh man, whose vote will de
cide the struggle.
Will Pringle is an entirely new man in
Oakland politics and was proposed for
president almost before th â¢ votep were
counted. He has good support, but there
is a feeling that a man who has had some
experience in the council chamber should
be accorded the honor. Mr. Pringle' s
friends do not think the lack of poliiical
experience should operate against his
cbances. They assert that a young man
of let-al training, education and marked
intelligence is quite as capnb c of presi l
ing over 'he deliberations of the council
as a man who has been in that body sev
eral years.
If there be a "logical" candidate for the
office it is Con Brosnahan, who has been
returned by the people lour limes as
Councilman. Mr. Brosnahnn, however,
stated to-day that he would not accept
the position, as he derives far more satis
faction from being on the floor of the
Couutil. Tie president has tittle respon
sibility except in the case of a cast in â 
vote, for he cannot act on any com mt tee
and his duti-s are entirely executive. For
this reason, it is argued, a young man is
as good as an old one.
SALOONMEN ORGANIZE.
They Will Fight the Anti-Saloon League
to a Finishâ Tim Constitutionality of
the Referendum Ordinance.
ALA M EDA, Cal., March 13. â The
twenty-three liquor-dealers of this city
met last evening and organized for defense
against the Anti-Saloon League, which
proposes to carry on a vigorous fieht at
the election in April against the liquor in
terest. The league's plan is to su rait
what is known as the referendum ordi
nance to the votersâ that is, tbe voters of
c eh crecinct are to be aske 1 to deolare
for or againtt the licencing of any saloons
in that precinct. After examining the
ground, the liquor-dealers have concluded
tnat this is tbe most vulnerable point, and
they will accordingly attack the ordinance
under which it h proposed to make this
submission to the people as unconstitu
tional.
The contest will be orened on their part
nÂ»xt Monday at he meeting of the Board
of Trustees, when M. P. Wigein, their at
torney, will open 'the ball. They are quite
confident that their view la correct and
that toe precinct plan of submission will
not be sustained.
Notes.
There are rumors of the proposed Intro
duction of an ordinance in tne Board of
Trustees regulating the speed at which
trains may be run within tne city limits.
At present Alameda is in parts oi two
Supervisorial distric s, and it is claimed
tbat the place is neglected. Many people
would like to have t be city made a disiricl
by u-e.f, which wouM insure adequate
representation en the county board.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 14, 1897.
ROBBERS CAUGHT
IN THEIR ROOST
OWsned a Bay Yacht and
Used It in Their Pirat
ical Raids.
One Confesses and the Proceeds
of a Burglary Are Re
covered.
Probably tbe Same G>ng That Cru
elly Beat and Robbed Old
Stephen Airing-
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call,!
908 Broadway. March 13. J
A clever little gang of youthful robbers
was rounded up during the night after a
lively chase.
For several days past the detectives
Have been looking for burglars who have
systematically entered ihe Derby tannery
in East Oakland. They had four men
under suspicion, who made their head
quarters in a shanty near East Fourteenth
street and Twenty-third avenue, which,
was at one time used us a free market.
Several times the detectives had tried
to reach tbe robbers' roost, but they were
forced to travel through a cowyard in
which was two feet of mud, and while
thay were attempting to flounder through
the men had run off in different direc
tions. Last night, however, the robben
were caught unawares and four of them
are now in jail. They are Henry Casey,
Red Jackman, Dan Lynch an I Mike Kerr.
Ca*ev wn ciught while makin : tracks
for Fruitvale, Lynch was iound lying in
the mud hiding behin â ) an old baree in
the estuary and the other two were caught
after a long run. Casey admitted to-day
that he bad stolen six hides of leather
from the tannery, and sold it in Ban Fran
cisco, where it was recovered by the detec
tives. They do not, however, beleve
Casey's Mory that the other men bad
nothing to do with the burglaries at the
tannery.
In the robbers' cabin was found a piece
of rope of the seme make and size as that
which was u-ed a few days ago for tying
up old Stephen Airing before be was
cruelly beaten and robbe i in a shanty at
Melro-e jast Tuesday. The men are all
known criminals, and it will now probably
appear that they were tbe three men who
assaulted Airing.
Red Jackman was arrested once before
while in company with Hobo Bill Jones,
now in San Quentln. Jackman narrowly
escaped prosecution some time ago on a
charge of holding up a station agent at
Mountain View, Santa Clara County.
An investigation to-day showed thut the
thieves have a complete system of ob
taining and disposing of their goods.
They have a well-rigged boat in the estu
ary, and on it was lound a io of new lum
ber, which had evidently just been secured
in one of the piratical raida, Casey stated
that it w*s in this boat the stolen leather
was taken to Han Francisco, and tbere is
no doubt in the minds of ihe pol en that
this la but one of many crimes committed
oy the gang.
Casey has already been charged with
burglary and the other men will be held
on charges of vagrancy pending investi
gation.
"OLD PARD'S" VIEW.
He Has a Parting Word to Say About
Saloons.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 13.â J. M.
Bas-ett, who failed of re-election to tbe
Council, Has published a statement re
garding his attitude on saloons. He says
that he does not believe in tbe ultra
moralist, but he admits he has no further
use for the saloon men. He says:
"There is a per cent of saloon men as in
every other business whose vote is for tbe
candidate who gets it. This per cent of
the saloon men of Oakland did not vote
for me last Monday, and it is to raise an
insurmountable barrier between myself
and this class of saloon men that I i>ro*
pose to introduce the Sunday-closing
ordinance next Monday evening* I be
lieve the Sunday clo in? will in a short
time wipe this (.lass, who are about one
fourth of the saloon men of tbe city, oat
of .-xhtence. Ido not believe that Sun
day closing is objectionable to the orderly
and law-abiding saloon, ft is the excep
tion thai profits by the Sunday business."

the Acme Cub entertainment last Thurs

gentlemanly conduct. To-day Fields
published the following letter:
Oakland, Cal., March 12, 1897.
To the Editor of the Tiibune Feeiinst it my
duty to exp am my position In the unpleasant
affair of last evening, and also to rectify an
error pubii-hed, I would like to have you
kindly allow me space for the following:
I accepted the match as a purely scientific
go, and not one that would be necessary to
knock my opponent out in order to win.
After the referee had decided against me I
made no threatening demonstration. I knew
I had won and simply commented on the de
cision. Yours tru.y. Jos. A. Fields.

BENZINE AND PAINT

The Shooting of a Singed Cat Adds

Oakland Office San Feancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Ma.eh 13 J
Benzine and paint in large quantities
furnished the material for a large fire on
the water front tbia afternoon. A little
after 2 o'c'ock flames were discovered in
the Malt bine Paint Works on First street,
near Castro, and owing to the nature of its
contents the fire seemed to break out from
all parts of the building at once.
The direct cause is not known, though
it was stated by one of the foremen that
it might have originated through careless
ness of employes. As soon as the general
alarm was turned in, it was seen that
nothing could be done to save the paint
works, and the entire efforts were directed
to saving the adjoining property. The
works were located on the windward side
of a block of factories, and as there was a
fresh breeze blowing there was danger for
a long time that the fire would work
through the block.
The department experienced much diffi
culty in fighting the flames on account of
the nature of the material in the works.
The dense smoke was carried to the lee
side of tbe oaintshops, and as that is the
only side on which any practical work
could be done the firemen were at a great
disadvantage. A few cottages next to the
wortca were partially destroyed, and for
some time tbe flames almost reached the
I'lioa nx Iron Foundry, but some streams
were directed to tbe roof, and they suc
ceeded In protecting the iron foundry
until tbe fire in the paint works was en
tirely under control.
While tbe fire was in progress the large
crowd was giartlea by beating a shot fired,
and many thought there was an explosion.
This was not the case. A police officer
caught sight of a poor cat that had been
fea fully burned, and he ended its suffer
ines with a bullet.
Four tanks . : containing 500 gallons of
benzine mixture -fed; the flames when
once they : * farted, and , while the men
were at work close to the building two
-mall tanks of gasoline exploded, wreck*
ing the i rear of the bailing, but doing no
other damage. '. ;â¢; >.;... -:?
' The - loss ", to ' the v paint works is about
$6000. Two little cottages owned by Rob
ert Kerzel,' which were not occupied, were
damaged about $900, while the damage to
the roof of the Phoenix Iron Foundry is
very 1 slight, Several small stores and
buildings in the vicinity were damaged in
the aggregate probably a thousand dol
lars. â  . ."â "â â ' ' , . . ; ' â  "/.-.'â  ;; '
The only accident reported was thf>t of
Manager Kuhiraan of the paint works,
who, when he saw the store in flames, cut
his ! hand severely while getting out
through the front window. < V ":~
â  â  A few, sparks from the paintabop started
a blaze in a building a block away and an
engine was told off to put It oat, which it
did in a few minutes with practically no
damage. 'â : '' v -v? â '/-'. -~ "'.;â ' v\- â â â  â â  - ...

PROF. HOWISON REPLIES
He Tays That Religion and
Philosophy Are D cidedly
Antagonistic.
Defense Made of His Position in
Relation to the R cent Philo
sophical Conroversy.
BERKELEY, Cal , March 13. â Pro
fes or G H. H wison, bead of the
department of philosophy at the St%te
University, has written for the students'
monthly magazine an article entitled
"Agnosticism and the Higtie- Human
Interests," in which he replies to various
criticisms of himsei! and his department,
passed during the recent controversy
aroused by ihe visit of Dr. William T.
Harris to the unirersity.
Professor Howison states that the
University of California is not an excep
tion'in arousing the hostility of religious
persons, bat tnat the leading institutions
of learning throughout the world are
made subject to similar denunciation
He believes that the prevailing thougl
in the higher institution* is due to tb
tendency of the times toward agnosticism.
"Re igion," said he, "presupposes the
abso ute sacredness of the law which it
delivers for the regulation of life, and the
like sacredness of the doctrines upon
which ihe law necessarily depends. Phi*
lusophy, on the contrary, counts nothing
sacred except as i i indicates itself at the
bar of reason. Indeed, it does not hold
reason itself sacred cxc pt as this justifies
itself to itself through relentless doubt
and unsparing criticism. How can this
apparent antae nism b* reconciled? 1 '

WORKINGMEN
WANT HELP
The Cotton-Mills Employes
Against Convict
Goods.
MANUFACTURERS WILL
ASSIST.
State Senator Tracy Asked to
Push the Anti-Machinery
Bill.
URGED TO FIGHT FOR TH^
MEASURE.
Good Jute Twine Can Be Made in the
Oaklani Establishment at a
Fair Price.
William Reay, engineer, W. R. Emery of
the cotton department anu James Moir,
foreman of the weaving department of the
California Cotton-mills of Oakland, called
upon Julian Sonntag, president of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, in his office at noon yesterday, and
presented the protest of the employes of
the cotton-mills against the manufacture
of cotton and jute twine at the San Quen
tin prison, which was published in The
Call yesterday.
The committee stated that it desired the
support of the association in the matter,
as the work of the convicts is a serious
detriment to the industry they represent
They then produced and lelt with Mr.
Sonntag samples of eight and three ply
twine, whicn ihey declared could be fur
nished in any quantity and of the highest
quality.
Mr. Sonntag said that he pledged the
support of the association to the commit
tee in its endeavor to put a stop to the
ruinous traffic they complain of.
He added that the Board of State Prison
Directors and Wanton Hale have violated
the plain letter of the Jaw by failing to
secure affidavits in regard 10 the twine
purchased, not only by the Examiner,
but by others, and said that it was evi
dently for the purpose of concealing the
facts. '"If the directors did not know of
these transactions the Warden certainly
did, and that being the case he ought to
be removed from the position he now
holds."
Mr. Sonntag then instructed Oscar
Lewis, who was present, to write a strong
letter, on behalf of the association, to
Assemblyman Treacy, asking him to have
the bill presented by ihe association to pro
hibit the use of certain machinery in the
prison in manufacturing in order to find
out how the legislators stand on the
proposition and have them on record.
A little later Oscar Lewis forwarded the
following letter to Mr. Treacy:
Sax Francisco, March 13. 1897.
Hon. T. E. Treacy, State Assembly, Sacramento,
CW.â Dear Sir: In regard to Assembly bill
5Â»33, prohibiting the use of machinery in the
State prisons, we notice it is on second reading
file.
.A delegation of the workingmen from the
Oakland cotton-mills called at our office this
morning, and are very indignant by reason of
the prison authorities at San Quentin going
into the manufacture ol twine, said twine be
ing used for a variety of purposes, and *.he
Oakland cotton-mills have had quite a busi
ness in that line, but recently their customers
have insisted that a similar article was offered
in this market from the East for 1 cent per
pound let^s money, bu: owing to the recent
ventilations in this matter it is iound that the
so-called Eastern twine was being manufac
tured in ban Quentin. and thu.- the small
quantitiesof twine purchased by the Examiner
aiid others has demoralized the prices for that
line of goods in this market.
Now we consider this a good time, if possi
ble, to urge tht> members of our present Legis
lature to vote upon the subject, as it has been
proven that the prison authorities cannot be
trusted with the haudling of labor-saving ma
chinery, but thai they will constantly encroach
upon the rights of free labor.
It may not be poÂ».'ible to pass bill 933 at this
session, but we are very anxious to have at
least a vote taken upen the subj.-ct. Very
truir yours. Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association 01 California, by
JruAN Sonstag. President.

AN UNGRATEFUL SET.
Burglars Slole His Money and

f roperty.
A Thoughtful Saloon Man Who Fur
nishes Marauders With Too's
for Tueir Trade.
William Purnhagen, good-natured and
affable, has been turned into a misan
thropic and surly individual in a single
night.
He is a man of the world and was philo
sophical enough until yesterday to allow
that iniquity is as necessary in the make
up of the boclal element as hydrogen is in
the atmosphere.
Three times in the past year or so since
he has become the possessor of a saloon
at the corner of Seventh and Market
streets the place has been broken into by
burglars. Twice the thieves broke imo
every drawer, creating more damage by

booty they obtained.
Realizing this Pnrnhagen made it a
practice to hang up a sign on the front of
his safe informing cracksmen:
Tne safe is open and there are only valueless
boons in it.
His object was not only to save the
burglars unnecessary work but to protect
his safe as well.
On the shelf bnck of the bar he always
kept a screw-driver and a "jimmy" of the
best pattern in case his visitors might
care to inspect more closely into the in
terior of closets and things.
In other words, Purnbagen expected
that the burglars might call on him ai.y
night wnen he was not at home, and he
preferred to give tiu>m sucii facilities to
ply their trade that ihey wouid do it in
shicshape manner without destroying his
property.
At 2 o'clock Friday morning he
closed up his place of business and re
tired. At 5:30 o'clock his barkeeper,
John Frais, opened the bouse again and
to bis astonishment he found that the
place had been turned topsy-turvy.
Burglars had profited by the three

hours' latitude given them to cut their
way in throuch the panel of a rear drawer.
They helped themselves to whisky and
other liquors, as well as to cigars. They
then used the proprietor's tools and broke
into the cash drawer, where they secured
some $8 in small change. They broke
open a nickel-in-tbe-slot machine, and for
once made a record of having beaten that
seductive gambling device. They also de
molished the cash register.

hurt at the loss of his money and goods
as he does at the ingratitude of the burg

them witn such destructive effect.

Hypnotism Supplants An
esthetics in Sur
gery.
A SUFFERING WOMAN
BELIEVED.
Mrs. Clothier Converses While
Her Flesh Is Stripped With
a Scalpel.
WAS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS
OF PAIN.
After the Ordeal Shi RÂ»membÂ»red
Nothing but Her Chat With
the Physicians-
Hypnotism promises to become a prom
inent factor in modern surgery. Consid
erable hypnotic experimenting has been
gcing on of late, but many of the most
successful investigators of this phase of
psychological science have refrained from
giving or neglected to give the results of
their work to the pUDlic.
An apt illustration of the adaptability
and harmlessnessof hypnotism in deiicato
and painful operations were furnished a
few days ago in the case of Mrs. A. R.
Clothier of Collinsville, Solano County,
now residing at 2115 Webster street, in
this City.
An operation, which is known among
the surgical fraternity a9"trachelorrapby,"
was performed on the lady about ten days
ago under hypnotic influence, but ''perin
eorraphy" was performed later, and
owing to aggravated conditions from the
previous operation was a serious ordeal.
Dr. M. E. Van Meter was the operating
surgeon, assisted by Dr. Charles Clark,
who readily placed the patient under the
influence of hypnotism. The only other
persons present during the operation were
the assistant surgeons and nurses.
At the first operation the lady was
hypnotized while lying on a
couch, and walked at the bidding
of the doctor to the operating table, and
after the ordeal returned to her former
resting place. At the last operation Dr.
Clark approacned her as she lay on the
operating table and, placing a hand across
her temples, which were covered with a
handkerchief, said soothingly: "You are
going to'' sleep now on this lounge, and
will feel much refreshed when you
awoke."
"Am I?" she asked contentedly, and in
a few minutes, being toid that every one
bad left the room but himself, she failed
to see or hear any of those moving about
her. Ti e surgeon bent over her and
touched her forehead, but she showed no
sign of consciousness, though she was
aware of all that Dr. Clark said and dirt,
conversinjr with him and acquiescing in
every statement he made and obeying
him as a child wouid.
In the meantime the operator had
arranged his instruments ana began his
work. A slight stream of blood followed
the glittering scalpel. And still she quietly
discussed the topics of the day with her
companion. Needles, scissors ana knives
were bereft of their terrors and
the faintest-hearted could but lose
himself in interest and wonder
us the operation progressed. Every
moment or so the doctor said to her:
"You can neither feel touch or pain; you
are resting perfectly," and she repeated
her affirmation of each statement and lay
as quiet aua motionless as if in slumber,
the muscles relaxed, the respiration regu
lar and normal and the voice subdued.
At times she complained of weariness
and asked to change her position, but sub
sided at a word, believing herself perfectly
comfortable. She asked for water and
drank from an imaginary giasswith per
fect satisfaction to herself.
At last the task was finished and the
physicians prepared to lift the patient
from the taoJe to her bed. Dr. Clark's
influence was again brought to bear and
she became rigid as If frozen so perfectly
did she respond to the "hypnotic sugges
tion." After being placed on her bed she
lay passive and relaxed while toloT she
would soon wake and would feel no pain
or weariness. "Post-by pnotic sugges
tions," as t;.ey are called, seem the most
remarkable of all, for they control the
subject after waking, leaving them free
from the influence of the operator.
After the lady had been comfortably
placed the surgeons withdrew; Dr. Clark
stepped back from the bedside to the
middle of the room and watched her
closely without speaKing.
As though he had uttered his command
aloud she began to count "One, two,
three," and on reaching* "twelve" she
threw back the handkerchief from her
face and opened her eyes. She remem
bered nothing with the exception of her
conversation with Dr. Clark, and there
wan no appearance of exhaustion or pain.
Later on she complained of a smarting
sensation, but was persuaded by further
"suggestion" that she was quite well.
The hypnotist has :he power to impose
silence upon his subject, as well as to con
trol tbe senses, but in this case speech did
not interfere with the physician, and the
patient aÂ§ked the privilege of talking,
which she laughingly told him was so
dear to her sex.
DESTITUTION AtfD DEATH.
A Singular Case on Zoe Street Investi-
gated by the Humane Officer*.
A peculiar case was investigated by Offi
cers Mcjiurry and Frank rioibrook of the
Scciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children yesterday. At 21 Zoe street lives
Peter Dahl, his wife and a boy 9 years of
age. "When the officers arrived they found
that early in the morning the other child,
agirl4years of ape, had 'led and was
still lying in the bed in which she died.
There had been no physician in attend
ance and no undertaker had been called.
The appearance of the body indicated
that neglect had played no small part in
the taking off of the little one. The par
ents pleaded poverty for their neglect,
and stated that they did not have a cent
in the world.
The officers called the case to the atten
tion of the Associated Charities, but they
were informed that the family was known
to the association, and that assistance in
that direction would be thrown away.
It is probable that the boy who is living
will be cared for by the society. The case
of the uead child was called to the atten
tion of the Health Department.
TWO DISEASED HORSES.
A Serious Case discovered at Bay View
in a Cow Pasture.
Special Officer George Delmer of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has found two horses recently
that were inflicted with glanders. The
first wa9 at Bay View, South San Fran
cisco, and the case was so bad that the
ranchers and dairymen in that locality
were almost crazed with the fear that
their 800 head of milch cows would be
come infected ironi eating in the same
pasture with the ain.cted animal.
The horse was killed and it is likely that
the man who turned the creature loose at
Bay View will be arrested.
The other case that Officer Delmer in
vestigated was that of an express horse
owned by a man named Ryan, whose
stand is at Mission ana Sixth streets. The
horse was sent to the Health Department
veterinary stable, in orner that, no mis
take should be made in the ailment be
fore the hor-e is killed.
BUTLER'S RED RECORD.
Evidence That the Australian
Ccmmitted All Kinds of
Crime.
Lesage Discovered to Be Alive, bat a
Third Victim Identified as C
Burgess
As the investigations of the Australian
police as to the past history of Richard
Ashe, or as he is better known to fame,
Butler, progresses the industry with
which he prosecuted his criminal projects
becomes more strikingly apparent. The
steamship Zealandia which arrived yes
terday brougnt news of crimes recently
traced to the handiwork of Ashe as well
as information of new evidence of his
connection with those murders with one
exception which were already traced to
his door.
The exception referred to is that of H.
beischet, or Lesage, whose remains the
police supposed they had found in the
Blue Hills. Lesaire has been working
under the name of Miller as cook in a
hotel at Grafton, ami ; no published ac
counts of his disappearance, though the
topic of general conversation, sfemed
never to have reached him.
The body which the police supposed to
be Lesage's baa now been identified as
that of a young man named C. Burgess.
The latter cume to Melbourne about a
year ago, and frcm there went to Sydney.
It is now known that he left his lodgings
to go with Ashe to the mines.
Severn! cases of forgery have incident
ally been proved against the prisoner.
S'-veral suspicious overtures were made to
the Australian bank, but. according to Mr.
Klderton, the bank* financial agent, lie
secured nothing from them.
The police are looking up the mysteri
ous disappearances of Napoli. an Italian
of Neriga District; Percy "William Mar
chant, Joseph Dresser of Qundagi and
Collier of Sydney. In the two .'alter cases
tde; police say the evidence points very
strongly to Ashe. They have also found
that he has been in jail many times, and
has probably committed all kinds of
crime.

SMILED IN THE
FACE OF DEATH
John Miller, James Childs'
Murderer, Sentenced
to Be Hanged.
Judge Cook Reviews the Evi
dence and Utters the
Fatelul Words.
Miller Ruthlessly Slew a Man Who
Prevented Kin From Killing
a Woman,
John Miller, who murdered James
Childs in this City on the 18th of last No
vember, was sentenced to death by Judge
Carroll Cook yesterday. The execution
will lake place in tha State prison at San
Quentin on a day to be fixed hereafter.
Miller was given to understand that he
will be hanged some time about the latter
part of May.
"When the death sentence was pro
nounced the prisoner at the bar evinced
very little emotion. He knew that this
fate was in store for him, the verdict of
the jury having left no discretion to the
court. At the conclusion of Judge Cook's
impressive words Miller looked up quietly,
smiled in a sort of half -apologetic way, as
if he were sorry to have caused so much
inconvenience, and then cast his eyes
down again, remaining thereafter per
fectly calm and silent until led away to
his ceil by the bailiff. He will soon be
turned over to the warden of the San
Quentin prison, where Willie Hearst's
twine supply is produced, and from that
dreadful place he will never emerge alive.
The crime for which Miller is to be
hanged caused much comment at the
time of the traefdy. Miller had quar
reled with Mrs. Nellie Ryan, with whom
he had maintained intimate relations and
was following and shooting at her on
Clementina street in this City. Mrs.
Ryan fled into the doorway of Childs'
home just as Childs was going out and in
order to protect the woman Childs stenped
between them. The woman thus escaped
and tnis enraped Miller to such an extent
that he turned his pistol on the man and
filled him with bullets, killing him in
stantly. After the pistol was empty Mil
ler snapped the pistol at himself several
times, pretending to attempt suicide. He
was caught redbanded and his convicticm
followed quicfcly.
An attempt was made to prove that Mil
ler was insane at the time be tired the
fatal shots, but the jurors in recent years
are not so hospitable to that defense as
they were in times gone by, and they took
the view presented on behalf of the prose
cution by Deputy District Attorney Hos
mer. The testimony showed that he had
been subject to epileptic tits, but the at
torney lor the people demonstrated that
this physical condition did not render the
subject incapable of judgine between right
and wrong. He was therefore held re
sponsible for his murderous act.
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson made a strong
plea on behalf of the prisoner for a new
trial, contending that the verdict was not
supported by the evidence and asserting
that errors were made in the trial prejudi
cial to the interests of his client.
Judge Cook said he thought the points
were-not well taken and denied the appli
cation for a new trial, whereupon no. ice
of appeal to the Supreme Court was given.
KILLED BY THE FALL
John Bennett, a Carpenter, Met Snd-
den Death Yesterday Afternoon.
John Bennett, acarpenter, aged 50 years,
was almost instantly killed yesterday aft
ernoon by falling from the roof of a build
ing on which be was employed, near the
corner of Pierce and Filbert streets.
Bennett picked up a plank that he
thought would be hard to lift, and the un
necessary amount of exertion employed in
the act caused him to lose his balance and
lall to the ground below. He was dead
when a doctor arrived, his neck being
broken.

was spending his vacation, about a chronic dyspepsia irfth which he had been a good

have to be treated for several months with a mild laxative and correctiveâ something
that would gradually bring back his normal condition without the violent action of

' RETAIL JIT WHOLESALE PRICES.,A CALIFORNIANS RECOLLECTIONS OF INCIDENTS
IN THE
LIFE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN
f!|^OME incidents, hitherto unpub
â ^t^lsJ lished, in the life of Abraham Lin-
WÂ»/^ coin are to:d by Rev. William
â¢ Stevenson, the veteran Methodist preach
er, of Santa Monica, Cal. Mr. Stevenson
has been encaged in his calling for over
fifty years, and during JUis pastorate at
Springfield, li!., was a near neighbor of
Lincoln. Most of the occurrences here
related came under his personal observa
tion and were during the period just pre
ceding the time that Lincoln became
President.
"I- don't think there are more than six
â  or eight men of near his age now living
who were among Lincoln's intimate as^o
; ciates between 1850 and 1863," said Mr.
Stevenson to tlie writer a few days ago.
I "Of the lawyers among this number I am
i unable to recall any save Milton Hay and
f" United States Senators Shelby M. Cul
lorn and John M. Pa;mpr. James Harian,
â with whom I attended college in 1844, is
the only member of Lincoln's first Cabi
net yet living.. He was Secretary of the
Interior.
. "With one exception Lincoln was the i
most melancholy man I ever knew. . His
â¢habit of almost continual joking seemed
to spring from an effort to throw off the
sorrowful in his nature. The fact that he
was sad yet cheerful, and thoughtful yet
Jr.v.oiou-', and witha! profoundly despond
en', explained, I believe, a good many
things- in his character tnat the world
doesn't understand.
..""One incident that took place about j
1845 brings out Lincoln's liking for a prac
tical joke. He and several others started
from Springfield, 111., to go to Postville,
the county seat of Logan County, to
' attend court. That was before the
days of stage coaches and the party
traveled horseback. Besides Lincoln
I here t\ere Stephen A. Douglas,
David Davis, who was afterward ap-
X ointed to the bench of the United State?
bn'preme Court sad who was later the
Populist candidate for President, Stephen.
Logan, the noted attorney, and Lyman
Trumbull, famous as a dandy, and who in
.he United States Senate afterward voted
for .the acquittal of President Andrew
Jonnson in tbe impeachment proceedings.
.In going to Postviiie the party 'had to
cross Salt Creek, which, when they got
near it, was found to have overflowed its
banks far beyond the approaches of the
â¢ only available bridge.
"Lincoln was the only man in the party
â¢ who was familiar with in- road to the
bridge. 'Gentlemen,' said he, 'we can get
' "to that bridge all right, bnt we shall have
to swim oar horses to do it. If wo do so
. without removing our clothing we will
) present a sorry appearance when we get
to Postviiie. The only thing for us to do
is for each man to strip, roll iiis clothes
into a bundle and tie it to the back of his
shoulders.' This advice was followed. It
. must have been a sight to behold. There
. â¢ was the tall, lank form of Lincoln, the
corpulent figure of Douglas, the tall and
fleshy Davis, the small-sized Logan and
.tne tall and dudish Trumbull. Having
â  made these elaborate preparations for a
wetting, the members of the party
started across the intervening overflowed
land, a quarter of a mile wide, on their
way to the bridge. At the deepest place
the water about reached the horses' knees,
â  and the travelers found they nad fallen
victipns to one of Lincoln's cleverly laid
pranks. It was many years before they
heard tee last about crossing Salt Creek.
"I recall one instance in particular in
which Lincoln resorted to his characteris
tic method of illustrating a point. He
ROMANTIC CAREER OF MRS. A. K. RIKERT, "THE WOMAN MINER OF TUOLUMNE."
- | â ^jURIXG the past few days Mrs. A. i
J^iji K. Rkert, known as the woman
,i___P/k miner of Tuoluznne, has been vis
iting friends her? and at Redwood City.
For fourteen vear-i steadily ha* she been
prospecting ana developing different prop
erties, and in that time she has discovered
some of the most famous mines of Cali
fornia, from one or two of which nearly
$2,000,000 has been taken. Among these
'mines is the rich Alb am bra of Calico,
widely known as part of the Silver Odessa
combination. This was a great silver
mine, but Mrs. Rikert does not mine for
silver alone, but for other mineral?, and
Â« to whatever she has directed her attention
V>* has succeeded. â  .â¢ -
â  She discovered the great borax mine at
talico, afterward managed by W. T. Cole
man. From William Alvord and Jerome
Lincoln, who purchased it, she received a
large sum, though nothing like what the
property is worth now. . This mine now
has the largest works of any borax mine
in the world. Mrs. Rikert has also been
singularly successful in mining for gold.
Sne was one of the first who went to the
new Alamo dipcings in Lower California
a few years ago, where she developed
valuable properties. '/â¢' â¢.
"The woman miner who has bad such a
remarkable experience has also discovered
and developed the Pino Blanco gold mine
near the Rawhide in Tuolurnne; County,
which now shows an enormous ledge of
quartz and from which she- confidently
beiieves millions of dollars will be taken.
She is here now in relation to the mine.
It seems probable that &ti3 will .realize a
large fortune from it. . '
Mrs. Rikert told the strange story of
how she happened to go inio mining, yes
terday for the first time. She is a South
ern lady and has ; that dislike which
many of the South have to being promi
nently thrust fore the public. Never
thelesss, she feels that her t career as a
miner has made her a r subject o , public
interest. Thousands of people have heard
of her Hitherto as Mrs. Townsend. It was
Jin MrÂ«. TownsmJ .-"â  that she t discovered
tome of the great mines in " r Calico.. She
j-as then a widow and it is since th n that ;
her marriage with Mr. Rikert has taken'
place. Si>e has a white pony named Snow
flake, and with this pony, and equipped
with the outfit of a prospector the woman
miner goes forth day after day to prospect
and to direct the work on mines she has
already found and is / developing. No
was givine me a comparison between
Senator Blank, who hhd a bombastic
style of expression, and Representative
i'.iaiik, who was plain spoken. 'Senator
Blank,' said Lincoln, 'would say, "that is
'erand, gaudy and imposing,' as his sa
tanic majesty exclaimed when he adorned
his caudal appendage with the cerulean
tin's of the imperial heavens." But Rep
resentative Blank would merely remark:
"'lsn't that pretty,' as the devil said
when he painted his tail sky-blue." '
"An example of Lincoln's sense of honor
was -hown me in a certain land dea'. At
one of the Government land offices in
Illinois some of the best sections were
falsely recorded as 'entered.' The man in
charge of the office, after get:ing nearly
thirty thousand acres thus disposed of
died suddenly. His confidential clerk
offered to sell the land to a syndicate,
which combination offered Lincoln a s!:are
of the stock if tie would act as its attorney.
"Not knowing of the false entries, but
feannir ti:e business might drive some
settlers from their holdings, Lincoln de
clared: ''I wouldn't dispossess an honest
man of a foot of land for all the money
there is in it.' It was explained to him
that no bona-fide settlers were to be dis
turbed, and then lie engaged in the enter
prise. I was emp'oyed to make examina
tion as to whether certain part? of this
land appeared on the Assessor's books.
Lincoln went to Washington and inter
viewed Commissioner Thomas H. Hen
drick* of the General Land Oftice( afterward
Yice-PresiUent). Hendricks said the land
could only be entered by public sale at the
Illinois office. A date for such sale was
fixed, but somehow when that time arrived
most o! tne land had been taken.
"The candor and clearness with which
Lincoln presented his statements in mak
ing a speech were remarkably convincing.
I witnessed an instance of this kind one
lime in court in Sprmglield when a post
master was on trial. He had been arrested
by a postoffice detective, as inspectors
were known in those days, for piifering
money from letters. The jury had been
chosen and the evidence beard. The case
was a strong one against tne man. The
prosecuting attorney made his speech,
then Lincoln spoke for the defendant.
'Gentlemen of the jury,' said he, 'lam
not going to bo so positive as to my client's
innocence as the prosecution has been
certain of his guilt. In fact if yon believe
what he says you no doubt think the de
fendant euilty. I will not say whether I
think him innocent or guilty. But, gentle
men, you are not here to judge this man
by what I believe or you believe, nor by
what the t rosecuting counsel says. You
are here to judge him by the law and evi
dence, and I can convince you in a few
minutes that there is nothing in either to
convict this man.'
"Lincoln's candor gained the confidence
of the jurors and when he had analyzed
the evidence and explained the law they
were ready to believe everything that he
bad said. It took the jury but twenty
minutes to find tbe defendant n ot guilty.
"A remarkable feature in Lincoln's life
which I think his biocraphers have over
looked was that almct from boyhood
be seemed to know he had a great worn
to perform. Tt ere was in Illinois a Metho
dist preacher named Peter Akers. He
had formerly been a lawyer, and was ad
mitted to the bar at the s-ame time and
place with Henry Clay, whom he closely
resembled. Akers was a man of profound
scholarship and surpassing eloquence.
He was a pronounced abolitionist. On

Her story is of signal interest. It indi

do in the fiela of mining.
"I am the daughter of a cotton planter
near Vicksburg, and was early taught
how to ride a horse, shoot and do many of
she things which only a young lady's
brothers are supposed generally to do,"
said she. "My father was a wealthy
planter and owned slaves. Of course he
was identified with the Confederacy, as I
was, but that is another story. Perhaps
it is enough to say that my people were
the Klines, of Mississippi, well known
and connected by marriage with nearly
all the noted families there. As Annie

took in the war, as will my sister, for we
were both imprisoned, though for nothing

"Well, fourteen years ago, when things
had changed around a creat deal, I came
to the new mining camp of Calico, deter
mined to make a fortune if it was to be
dont. To this end I began to carefully
study mining. It was a very rich silver
camp and I soon learned to find mines by
the outcroppings and to make tosts of the
ledges which I had found.
"I assure you I am very much more
particular when I go out to prospect than
many men are who go to look for indica
tions. Often where men walk right over
the ground I stop and stay a whole day,
examining particularly every part of the
ground, chopping away brush and using
pick and shovel freely.
"It was while -prospecting in this way
that I found the famous Aiharnbra mine,
which proved to have such a large body of
rich ore. This mine was bought by the
late \V. W. Stow ol this City and becam*
a purl ol the great Silver OJeÂ«sa, of which
everybody has heard. This is one oi the
most celebrated of all the nines at Calico
I also discovered and developed several
other good mines there.
"Among the mines was the enormous

and Jerome Lincoln and managed by Wil

certain occasions this became his absorb

subject, tbe abolition idea would find ex
pression. In 1843, three years before the
Mexican War, Akers spoke at a camp
meeting at Chatham, 111. Lincoln was
present. Akers took up the question of
African slavery and announced it as his
conviction that the South was conspiring
to extend the area of slave territory and
to that end would precipitate war with

works erected on it are the largest of any

"At the time of the rush to the gold
fields of Alamo I and my daughter were
among the first to go there. As Mrs.
Townsend I had become well known in
Calico, and many of ;ne miners believed
for my successes that luck followed me, in

wanted me to make iocations for them. I

"Another incident in this connection
occutred in which, while talk ng with
Lincoln one day during the period of his
famous debates with Douglas, I remarked
that he might not succeed in his campaign
for the United States Senate.

In tne days when the earth was young;
The waves were gossiping loud and long,
Ere mortals had found a tongue;

Or soothed to n siren strain,
As they tossed (he primitive isles among
Or slept in the open main.
Such was the song and its changes free,
Such was the song of the sea.
The song of the sea took a human tone
In the days of the cominc of man ;
A mournfuler meaning swelled her moan,
And fiercer her riots ran ;
B-.'cause that her stately voice began
To speak of our human woes ;
With music mighty to grasp the span,
Life's tale and its passion throes.
Such was t!;e song aa it grew to be,
Such was the song of the sea.
The song of the sea was a hungry sound
As the nuinan years unrolled;
For the notes were hoarse with the doomed

Or choked with a shipwreck's gold;
Till it seemed no dirge above the mold
So sorry a story said
As the midnight cry of the waters old

Such is the song ana its threnody,
Such is the song of the sea.
The song of the sea is a wondrous lay,
For it mirrors human life;
It is grave and preat as the judgment day,
It Is torn with the thought of strife;
Yet under the stars it is smooth and rife

And their wedding day is fair-

"From what Lincoln told me personally
I may say that he believed slavery ought
not to be extended and that when con
fined in certain limits its death doom was
sealed in some way or other, he didn't
know how. I think it was in response to
the promptings of such a belief that after
he became President he was constrained
to say: 'If to save the Union I must save
slavery, I'd do it. I! to save the Union I
must destroy slavery, I'd do that. The
preservation of the Union at all hazards
and at any price.'
"In the scores of speeches I heard Lin
coln make I never but once knew bis effort
to be a weak one. On that occasion he had
been announced to speak in Paris, 111. It
was in the fall of 1808, I think, and was
within the period of the Lincoln-Douglas
debates. Douglas was ill and Lincoln was
to speak without him. While on the train
going from Springfield to Paris to attend
the meeting I fell into conversation with
a stran er, who on acquaintance proved to
be Owen Lovejoy of Princeton, 111.
Lovejoy was a noted abolitionist
of the most pronounced type, but
one of the most eloquent speakers I ever
heard. At his request I promised not to
reveal his name. When we arrived at Paris
we found that Lincoln had telegraphed
that he would be delayed in arrival. I con
ferred witn the committee in charge of
the meeting and said there was a man
who, if they wou.d not reveal his name,
would speaK while they were waiting for
Lincoln.
"The committee thought strange of it,
but consented. Mr. Lovejoy was intro
duced as 'a man from Northern Illinois.'
He spoke on the Mis-ouri compromise
and other current topics. His splendid
appearance, his fine voice and his wonder
ful command of language, with his great
personal magnetism, carried his hearers
up and up till their attention was most in
tense. He spoke for nearly two hours.
Every eye was fastened on him and every
ear was listening to his voice when, in
conclusion, he said: 'Button your coats
and hold your hats till I tell you who I
am. I am the great abolitionist, Owen
Lovejoy.'
"The audience was astonished beyond
measure. The sudden descent from the
seventh heaven to which it had been borne
in the flights of his oratory caused excla
mations of surprise such as I shall never
forget. Loveioy's audience had ideas of
its own on the abolition question, and his
name was by no means popular In that
section. That it was Lovejoy whose
speech had so charmed the listeners
seemed almost beyond their belief.
'â¢Soon after that Lincoln came on the
platform and explained his delay. He
said he had had nothing to eat since
morning except one or two pieces of
pie, and be didn't feel like making a
speech. He attempted to make an ad
dress and it was a failureâ yet not a
failure, but only a weak effort. After the
heights to which it had been carried by
Lovej^y's matchless oratory and the sud
den descent when he revealed his name,
the audience was in poor condition to be
affected by Lincoln's remarks. But this
was an exception. While Lincoln's hear
ers were not always convinced that he
was right, they never doubted his sin
cerity.
"I was a caller at Mr. Lincoln's house
the next morning after his nomination
for President. While I was there a com
mittee came in to extend congratulations.

equipped for what I have to do. I take
my little white pony Snowflake and am
gone all day. Sometimes I drive, but as
often I ride in the saddle. I carry a
small pick, a fire-shovel and a hatchet.
If I find a place where I want to scrape
the broken stone or dirt away I use the
shovel, and if I find brush in the way the
hatchet is handy to cut it off.
"The pony Snowflake I brought with
me from Lower California. She came all
the way from La Paz, and I may say is
invaluable to me in my latter-aay pros
pecting.

more satisfactory.

plied, 'had a drop of liquor in my cellar,
and I never snail.'
"On that same morning after Lincoln's

present United States Senator from Idaho)
asked of Mr. Lincoln, "How do you

into his habit of telling a story to illus

about it. They did so, and he replied
that my statement was correct.

scarcely ever read a newspaper through.
He said he would glance over a paper, see
if there was anything he particularly
cared to read, and, having finished such

The Last Entry.
CHAPTER I.
MR. AND MISS VANDERHOLT.
This story belongs to the year 1843 and was regarded by the genera
tions of that and a succeeding time as the most miraculous of all the
recorded deliverances from death at sea.
It may be thus told:
Montagu Vamierholt sat at breakfast with bis daughter, Violet, one
morning in September. Vanderholt's house was one of a fine terrace close
to Hyde Park. He was a rich man, a retired Cape merchant, and his life
had been as checkered as Trelawney's, with nothing of romance and noth
ing of imagination in it. He was the son of honest parents of Dutch ex
traction, and had run away to sea when about 12 years old.
He got a ship, was three years absÂ«nt, and on his return found both
his father and mother dead. He went again to sea and, fortunately for
him, was shipwrecked in the neighborhood of Simons Bay. The sur
vivors made th> ir way to Capetown and presently young Vanderholt got
a job and afterward a position. He then became a master, until, after
some eight or ten years of heroic perseverance, attended by much good
luck, behold Mr. Vanderholt full blown into a colonial merchant prince-
How much he was worth when he made up his mind to settle in England
after the deaih of his wife and when he had disposed of his affairs so as
to leave himself as free a man as ever he had been when he was common
Jack Swab really signifies nothing. It is cprtain he had plenty, and
plenty is enough even for a merchant prince of Dutch extraction.
Violet was Vanderholt's only daughter, and beloved her exceedingly.
Bhe was not beautiful, but she was fair to see, with a pretty figure and an
arch gay smile.
Mr. Vanderholt 3nd his daughter had been conversing in the break
fasi-room for some time on matters of no concern to us, who are to follow
their fortunes Presently he fastened his gaze upon the picture of a
rushing schooner which hung on the wall.
"lam going to tell you what I have made up my mind to do," he
said.
"ifes, and there she is," interrupted the girl with a sweep of her hand
at the picture. "But I really don't think, father, that you need such an
extensive change."
I'My doctors are of my opinion. I require nothing less than three
months of the sea breeze, and ail the climates that I can pack into that
â  time."
"And George?" said Miss Vanderholt, her voice a little colored by
vexation. "He may arrive home and find us absent, and there will be no
body in the world to tell him where we are: whether we are alive or dead,
ana when we may be expected back."
"George won't come home till June next," said Mr. Vanderholt.
"There is no chance of it. Meanwhile I mean to escape the winter by
beading direct for the equator and back. 1 '
"Shall you take any friends with you? 1 '
"Not even a dog," answered Mr. Vanderholt.
It was easily seen by the expression of Miss Vanderholt's face that she
â was thinking of George. Finding her father had ceased to speak she
exclaimed, "Who will be the captain?"
"I shall ask my friend Fairbanks to recommend a man to me. He of
all the ship-owners that I am acquainted with is certain to know of a
good roan." Â«
"Will he belong to the royal nary T"
"No."
"Then he will not be a gentleman."
Vanderholt looked at her intently. His face relaxed. He combed
down his beard ana said:
"He will be a sailor, and if he is a sailor he will be a man. Combine
these two things and you produce an expression of human existence
beyond the achievement of the most illustrious lineage and the most
ancient college."
Miss Violet Vanderholt, being acquainted with her father's character
and knowing that he rarely changed his mina, went to her room, where
in peace she occupied a full hour in writing a long letter to Georee.
And who was George? One had but to peep over the girl's shoulder
to discover. "My own darling George," she began, and this sort of thine
is commonly accepted as the language of love. Captain George Parry wa3
an officer in the Honorable East India Company's service. When he was
last at home he had met Miss Violet, haunted her closely, exhibited him
self in a variety of ways as deeply in love with her. Wonderful to relate,
Montagu Vanderholi took a fancy to the young man, and when Ensign
Pairy called to ask his leave to consider himself engaged, he was as
tounded by the cheerful "Certainly, with pleasure, if you are both satis
fied," which greeted him.
The interview terminated to the satisfaction of both gentlemen. In
due time Ensign Parry returned to India, and now. as Captain Parry, he
â was expected home in June, 1849, but in one or two letters to Violet he
had expressed a hope that he wouid be able to get home by a much earlier
date. It had been settled that they would be married soon after his arri
val in England. And this was the posiure of affairs as regarded Captain
Parry and Miss Vanderholt. The young lady, seating herself, dipped he r
pen and wrote.
No more is worth noticing in this youn? lady's letter to her sweet
heart; but it may be worth stating here, however, that in the year of
this tale letters dated in England took some four months, sometimes five
mouths, and perhaps six months to reach the people who were wailing
for them in India.
On the afternoon of this same day Mr. Vanderholt entered his car
riage and drove into the city. He alighted at the offices of a Arm of ship
owners in Fencburch street, and was immediately confronted by the very
person he had called to see. They shook hands.
"I want ten minutes with you, Fairbanks."
"As long as yon please, Mr. Vanderholt. Always happy to be of ser
vice to you."
Mr. Vanderholt was rendered a little uneasy by Mr. Fairbanks' looks
of expectation, and began somewhat in a hurry, lest his friend's antici
pation should grow. *
"It is a very trifling matter I have called to see yon about, Fairbanks. -
It concerns a skipper for my boat, the Mowbrny. For some time past I
have been out of sorts, and have resolved to get clear of England during
the winter. I have a tine boat laid up in theiTnames. Sue is 180 tons,
and I calculate, counting the cook and the fellow for the cabin, that a
skipper, a mate and eight hands would suffice me. Do you know of a
good skipper?"
Mr. Fairbanks brought his fingers together in an attitude of prayer,
and said he thought that by dint of inquiry he might be able to find one.
"What pay?" said he.
"Ten pounds a month," answered Mr. Vanderholt. "I want a good
man.''
"Do you take any company with you?"
"Only my daughter."
"I believe," said Mr. Fairbanks, "that I know the man for yon. he
had charge of a ship of ours, the Sandyfoot It was but yesterday that I
nodded to him outside these offices. If you take him you will carry aro
mance in pilot cloth to sea with you. This fellowâ you will not believe
what lam going to tell you when you see himâ was in love with a girl.
He broke with her in a quarrel, and went to sea, and Dy a homeward ship
wrote to ask her forgiveness and to keep her heart whole for him, and he
would shortly return. He was swept overboard in a storm, picked up
floating in a buoy by a thr e-masted schooner, and carried to China. On
his arrival home he found his sweetheart had gone out of her mind. She
recovered by degrees under his influence, and they were to be married.
They proceeded together to church and at the altar she went mad again.
Of course the paison refused to officiate, and a few weeics later the poor
thing died."
"What is the name of our friend ?" inquired Mr. Vanderholt, who bad
listened without much interest to this romantic story.
"Thomas Glew."
"Originally a nickname meant to stick." said Mr. Vanderholt drily.
â¢'Send him to me. You will oblige me by doing so."
Next morning ai about 11 o'clock Mr. Vanderholt was in his study
writing some letters. His daughter sat with him reading a newspaper. A
man servant opened the door and said a seafaring gentleman was in tue 'all
and had called by request. Oa a Â»ilver salver lay Mr. Fairbanks' card
and Mr. Vamlerholt after glancing at the card told the fooiman to show
Captain Giew in.
There entered soon with a quick, resoly^d quarterdeck stride a short
bat powerfully built man, shell- bucked by ocean duties, with a face that

might have been cast in light bronze, that might have served as a ship's
figurehead in that metal so roasted had it been in its days, so hard set
was it. as though fresh from the pictie of the harness cask. The flesh of
the countenance had that so/t of tension-which does not admit of much
or perhaps any play of emotion. The man might expel a laugh from his
throat, but was tie physically equal to a smile? He held a round hat and
was soberly attired in blue clotii. He looked swiftly and lightly around
him, but seemed unmoved by the splendor of the apartment into which
he had been shown, lie sent a keen, gray seawardly glance at Miss Van
derholt and lastened his gaze with an expression of attention upon her
father.
Miss Vanderholt viewed him with curiosity and disappointment.
"Captain G ew?" said Mr. Vanderholt.
"That's my name, sir," answered the captain, in a voice asdecisiveas
his walk and air. "I was asfced to call upon you by Mr. Fairbanks."
"Right. Sit down. I had a good many years of it myself, but did not
reach the quarterdeck," sa;d Mr. Vanderholt. "My end was plumb with
the foretop."
The captain seated himself, but did not smile, nor did he look as if he
wanted to.
" THEY'VE BEEN A-YARNING ABOUT US HALF MY TRICK," SAID DABB.
"Ma#iy years at sea, Captain Glew?"
"Thrtr, sir."
"Did you run away, as I did, from home?"
"No. I was put apprentice by my father, who had charge of a bethel
and was a man of education."
"Did Mr. Fairbanks expiain what I wanted to see you about?"
"Yes, sir. I believe you'll find me a suitable man. I confess I'd like
the job. I know the Mowbray."
Mr. Vanderholfs face liirhted up.
"I was off her in a wherry not. above a fortnight ago, and we stopped
to admire her. I never saw prettier lines."
"I am quite satistiea," said Mr. Vanderholt. "Now let as settle the
matter straight away off. That is my way of zoing to work. I'm not for
easing away handfsomely; I*m for letting go with a run. We shall want
a mate, and we shall want a crew. Can I trust you to see to this busi
ness?"
"You'can, sir."
"Let the crew be bluewater men. I shall want real sailors aboard the
Mowbray."
"Kight, sir. And tte voyage, I understand, is to be a cruise in the
North Atlantic"
"It is to be a run to the equator and home."
"It seems such an odd place to steer for," said Miss Vanderholt, break
ing the silence for the first time.
"It's as determinable as a rock, anyhow," exclaimed Mr. Vanderholt.
"I want to be able to report a wonder when we return." Here his Dutch
countenance pat on the air of good-humored cunning with which he usu
ally prefaced a joke. "There is about a quarter of a mile of equatorial
water which possesses a remarkable property. Sink an object in it and
you draw it up gilt. If we strike this wondertul patch of sea we will gild
the Mowbray from waterway to truck, boats, ground tackle, everything
shall be resplendent, and we shall be the marvel of London as we Bail up
the Thames."
Mr. Vanderholt watched Captain Glew to see how he relished this sort
of thine. The skipper exclaimed austerely : "It's a track of water writ
ten of in books for the marines. It's not to be found at sea, sir."
"We must strike it, man, so that we may return covered with glory."
He looked at his daughter, clearly enjoying his own imagination, and
Captain Glew uttered a hollow iaugli and stood up.
"I w.ll visit the vessel to-morrow, sir, and report. I will bring my
papers along witn me â "
"No need," interrupted Mr. Vanderbilt. "Mr. Fairbanks' introduc
tion is qnor.gh."
The man made a nautical bow to the father and daughter and de
parted.
"I like him," said Mr. Vanderholt, turning in hisc'nair so as to resume
his letter-writing. "But I Ruess the crew will find him a taut hand."
"What is a taut hand?" inquired his daughter.
"A man who breeds mutinies," be answered. He loosed thoughtful
for a few moments as though visited by come tragic memories; then tak
ing up bis pen he went on writing letters.
CHAPTER 11.
DOWN RIVER.
On the morning of November 21, 1848, the schooner Mowbray lay at
anchor abreast of Greenwicli. -
The schooner looked handsomer than a yacht, because she lacked the
summer precision and fine weather finish of that sort of craft. The nau
tical eye does not love fide featoers.
The hour was 11:30. A. number of seamen, appareled with some
regard to uniformity of attire, lounged in the bows, staring Greenwich
way, or at the familiar scene of docks t'other side the river. They looked
rough, of the genuine merchant-sailor type; rasrgedly hairy, defiant in
stare, in fold of arm, resolve in their several postures. They wore round
hats and jacKets. and the Dall-ended, blue cloth trousers of the jacks of
that day.
On the quarter deck walked Captain Glew and the mate, who had
signed nrticies for the run, Mr. Tweed. This was a short, hearty, plump
man. His jrrog-biossomed, jovial face suggested a suppressed boisterous
ness of spirits; you felt that in him lav the voice for the back parlor of
the "Free and Easy." The owner of the vessel and parly were expected
on board shortly.
"I think he ought to be pleased," said Captain Glew, coming to a
stand at the binnacle, and throwing a Jook over the little ship ana then
up aloft. "Nothing handsomer sails out of the Thames this year."
"She is sweet enough for a pennon," said Tweed. "I wish she was mine.
I'd like to ko a-pirating in a vessel of this sort. No I wouldn' t either. I'd
go a-slaving. A hundred and eighty tons. I reckon you could stow away
600 blacks in her 'tween decks."
"I sometimes wish I'd been born a hundred years sooner," said Cap
tain Glew. "I would have been a pirate. The ocean was thick with booty,
and you got an estite with very little risk. The dogs came to the gibbet
because they never would be satisfied."
"P racy gave the sailor a good chance," said the mate with a groggy
look at the hands loun^ingforward.
"Here lam grateful for this Â£30 job," growled the captain. "The wife
and young 'uns may now eat and <irink for three monihs, and for three
months the thought of to-morrow morning shan't keep me awake. Holly
Jemmy ! But it's on the quarter deck where the hearts of sione are
wanted. To those iellows forward the getting a ship's as easy as an oath.
Do you or I get ships as easy as swear?"
"No, not by all that I'm worth," answered Tweed. "Captain, I have
followed the sea for twenty years, nnd I'll tell you how it stands with me
now. In my cabin you'l find a sea chest. It's painted green. Green it
should be. It's the color of my life. In that sea chest is all that I own in
the world, saving a matter of Â£30 stowed away ashore. Tweaty years of
the sea and nothing but a bloomed green sea chest to show for it!' ex
claimed Tweed, with so much blood in his facs that his grog-blossoms
made him look as if he iiud burst into a dangerous rash.
Forward the teamen growled in talk inaistinguishable to the quarter
deck walkers.
â¢What sort of boss is th' old man going to turn out?" exclaimed one
of the seamen, starting aft. "I don't like his look 3. But wiien once I've
signed a vessel's articles I'm for outffeatherjne the skipper if he was the
devil himself. He'll get no chance out of Joseph Dabb, and it's truly hex
traordinary, bullies, that Joseph Dabb should be my name."
Â£> I was spliced three weeks a.0," exclaimed a red-headed seaman*
"I'm a-missing of Sally, ray joys. I feel gallus lite going home again."
He eyed the land about the West India Docks, and extended his arms
amid a rumble of laugmer and much spitting of yellow froth over the
bow?.
"I don't expect to see my ole 'ooroan again," exclaimed a seaman
standing upright, with his arms folded. "If She don't die she'il make
tracks, and, foreseeing of that, I sold off my household furniture yester
day."
"Where's this vessel bound to?" said another man.
"I signed for a cruise," answered some one.
"Something was said about the equator," exclaimed another.
"The equator's ho coast," said tho red-beaded man.
Just then a large white boat was seen to be approaching the Mow
br ay from the direction of Greenwich, and in a few minutes she was
alonpsicieâ a boat full of ladies and gentlemen. The party consisted of
Mr. and Mrs. Vanderh <1 1 and a few friends who hud accompanied them
to Greenwich to see them off. Vanderholt shook hands with bis captain,
nodded to the mate and cast a look of approval in the direction of the
forecastle. He seemed in high spirits. His eyes smiled deep in their
little sockets, and the fresh and friendly wind blew his beard into twenty
expressions of kindly laughter. He was rigged out for the sea. No
Minories' slopshop could have furnished him with a salter aspect. The
seamen on the forecastle oyed him, and murmured one to another. They
seemed to recognize their own vocation in tne man, yet viewed him
doub fully, as dogs watch with suspicion the dog in Punch and Judy.
His daughter was handsomely draped in velvet and fur, and wore a
tnrban-sbaped hat that was as good f or the decic as for her looks. In a
minute there was a little crowd of well-dressed gentlemen and ladies
standing on the quarterdeck gazing around them and Aloft, with Mr.
Vanderholt laughing with the wind in his beard and Miss Vi gazing
somewhat pensively at the full scene of life on the schooner.
Jfc was the right sort of morning for a start for the ocean. Tht brisk
breeze covered the surface of the river with sliding shapes, coming and
going. A large Indiaman, newly arrived, with the rust of four months of
brine draining down her chain plate bolt?, her sheathing green as grass,
with a quivering of weeds here and there, lay off the docks opposite. Her
house flag flew stately from the lofty masthead; stately and proud, too,
she floated, tall and square. She seemed alive and conscious of victory.
The lights of her cabin windows shook thronzh the ripples in long darts
of silver. A chorus of thirty hurricane voices swept down the wind, and
there came out of that inspiriting windlass song of sailors who had
brougt their lofty ship home the whole spirit of the ocean into the living,
brimming picture of river.
Mr. Vanderholt's friends walked about the decks of the Mowbray,
praising the schooner highly.
There was mucli handshaking, and all the usual assurances of friend
ship agitated by leave taking. Nevertheless, when the company were in
their boat going ashore, one of the gentlemen who had spoken softly, but
now no longer whispered, exclaimed:
"I think Vanderholt most be a selfish old cuckoo to carry away his
daughter to the ocean with no other company but his own grumbling self
and Captain Glew."
"I would not be sailing to the equator in that schooner for Â£1000,"
said a lady. "I should have to bo run away with to do such a thing," and
she leered sweetly at a gentleman opposite ner.
On board the schooner they lost no tima getting her under way.
Before the length of filackwell Reach had been measured the schooner
was clothed, her seamen coiling down, some attending the sheets, every
thing quiet and comfortable. T.ie captain stood beside the tiller conning
tiie little vessel. He was qualified as a pilot for the Thames, and boaated
that he could smell his way ud and down it in the dark, and truly per.
haps the nose in some parts of this noble river would ba as good as the
lead or a buoy to tell a man where he was. Glew caught the eye of Mr
Vanderbolt, who, approaching him, said:
"I am very well pleased. You have chosen well. This is a good
company of seamen."
CHAPTER 111.
ON THE EVE.
It was five days later; in that time the Mowbrny had drawn 400 mil es
closer to the equator, still leaving a wide expanse of water to be measure .
The weather hud been a constant tropic neauty. Tlie heave o; tho Atlantic
swell had the wild and solemn indolence of the Sooth Pacific fold in itÂ«
run. Mr. Vanderbolt's face was crimson with tne sea. He certainly*
looked extremely well. So. too, did his daughter. The sun bad caugi>jA
her, spite of a diligent use of her parasol, and swift fligb'ts from his scorch- 1
ing'eye to the shelter of the awninsr, and had deiicateiy spangled the fair
flesh of her face with some golden frockles, which somehow cave an
archDessto her look* and q whiter flash to her teeth, wnen th.- pay of
her lips exposed them.
Mr. Vanderholt came on deck when the sun was pone, though all the
west was swimming and waving in the fast waning crimson of the tropics.
A number of stars ii ad appeared ih the east. Mr. Vanderholt looKed at
them with delight, for they reminded him of the twinkling of tne sky in
windy summer trees.
A pleasant air of wind was blowing. Now that the sun was cone the
breeze seemed to fan over the Dulwark rail with the fragrance of a land of
flowers. It was a sweetness that made you think of thÂ« Arabian sale of
the poet, but the African land was leagues and leagues and leagues dis
tant, and that sweet breath, therefore, was old ocean's own.
The schooner, with every stitch of canvas upon hpr, saving the fore
topmost studding-sail, to the setting of which Mr. Vanderholt had an
objection, glided through the gathering dusk to the music of broken
waters. Miss Vanderholt sat in the cabin under the lamp. She wns read
ing, and appeared to be interested. Mr. Vanderholt filled his pipe from a
pouch whose size corresponded with the bowl it was lo feed. While he
did tnis he looked about him.
Glew stood between him and tne lingering scarlet, and his borty,
b!ack as indigo, rose and fell. What was the matter? It seemeti to Mr-
Vanderholt t;:at an unnatural stillness was in the little vessel. He siill
preserved the forecastle faculties and carried the eye, while he could bend
the ear of a sailor. Eiirht bells had been struck. The second dog watch
was therefore over. The watch below would or would not have gone to
bed. All this Mr. Vanderholt knew; but so bright, flushed and sweet a
night, after the roasting and blinding glories of the day, mieiit well prove
a temptation to the hands whose turn it was to take rest till midnight to
linger, converse, to suck out yet another pips of tobacco.
But the silence forward was so deep that Vanderholt, barkening with
bis forefinger pressed upon his bowl of unlighted tobacco, thought it
oininou?. At intervals somebody away in the bows would speak. The
voice was a growl, and it would be answered by a growl, and it seemed to
the owner of the Mowbray that whoever it might be that broke the si
lence in the little ship made utterance with the throat of a sleeping
mastiff.
Mr. Vanderholt lighted his pipe, seated himself and called to Captaiifc
Glew, who immediately crossed the deck. "A
"The men seem very quiet, Glew."
â¢â¢And a good job, too, sir. This is a yacht and we've got a lady
aboard."
"Ay, ay, man, that's so. But, yacht or no yacht, lady or no lady t
surely I'm the last man to be opposed to a little dog-watch jollity when
ever my sailors have a mind to it."
The man at the wheel was not far off and Vanderholt spoke low.
"They're a crew that want keeping under," said Captain Glew.
"They're not used to pleasure sailing of this sort. I singled them out my
self and had good hopes of them, and there's no fault to be found with
them as seamen. This light cruising job is fast spoiling them. They need
the heavy work of a full- rigged ship."
"If they find the job an easy one then I suppose they're satisfied?"
said Mr. Vanderbolt.
"I'm very much afraid that there's no kind treatment and no easy
job under the sun that's going to satisfy an English sailor," said Captain
Glew.
"You're hard upon the calling, Glew. You're talking to a man who
has had to work bard and fare bard."
"Sir, if you'd been in command you'd know that I'm speaking the
truth."
Here Miss Vanderholt came on deck. Captain Glew placed a chair for
her beside her father.
"What & heavenly sweet and silent night!" exclaimed the young lady.
â¢'ls that a ship on fire down there?"
"It's the moon rising, mis 3," exclaimed Captain Glew.
Her upper limb floated blood red on the sea line like a glowing ember-
She sailed up large, swollen, stately, the face rusty, as though the lumi
nary had been some mighty casting in the African sands and was now
being sent aloft, red-hot, by the thrust of its giant molders. At her
coming the wind freshened in a damp gust, the bchooner strained and the
sound arose of water broken quickly into froth.
"Glew and I have boen talking about the men, Vi," said Mr. Vander
holt, after contemplating for a few minutes tie hot lunar dawn.
"They don't look a very happy crew," answered Miss Vanoerholt,
"But heat will make people sullen. The sailors have to work in the sun,
and, after all, there is very little money for them to receive apiece when
they reach home."
Vanderholt laughed and said : "Quite as much an they shall get out
of my pocket. Foi^r pounds and Â£5 a month, Vi. Why, I've been signing
on when a tine young man for Â£2 ss, and glad to get it."
"Ar<> the crew dissatisfied?" inquired Miss Violet.
"Well, I don't mind owning to you, Mr. Vanderholt," said the cap- I
tain, "that they've been trying to mate a trouble about the stores. But 1 I
wouldn't allow it." '
He stopped short with a vibratory note in his voice as though a piece
of catgut had been twanged.
"The stores ought to be good," said Mr. Vanderholt. "The check that
was maae payab c to Mr. Lyons was a liberal one."
â¢'Do they grumble at one thing more than another?' 1 said Miss Van
derholt.
"Oh, first it's pork, then it's the beef. They'll work their way right
through till they come to the pickles," said Glew, with a short nervous
laugh.
"This is the first time I've heard that the men are dissatisfied," ex
claimed Mr. Vanderholt.
"What is the good of worrying you with folks' troubles, sir? You're
on a cruise for your beaith and the worries of the ship should be mine,
not yours."
"It is well meant, Glew," said Vanderholt a little uneasily. "They
are a rough body of men. mind. 1 was long fed on pork and beef and my
palate has memory enough to distinguish, I think. Tell Allan to-morrow
to cook sampies of botb kinds and I will lunch off them."
This being so, Mr. Vanderholt smoked for a while in silence. The
question of port and beef and sailors' grievances is uninteresting at all
times, and peculiarly uninviting on a fine moonlight night. The sub
ject wai dropped. Captain Glew moved off and father and daughter were
alone in the moonlL-ht.
The atmosphere was now misty with the silver of the satellite. She
was n.> arly a full moon, and rained her glory most abundantly. She
made a fairy vision of the Mowbray, etherealizing her into a fabric of
white vapor and founiain-like lines as she leaned, purring at her cut
water from the delicate wind.
It was 10 o'clock before they quitted the deck. A man struck four
balls on the forecastle. Immediately a figure arose from the deep shadow
cast by the deckhouse on the deck. It was the seaman, Dabb, and he was
immediately joined by three others of the crew.
Dabb stood up and the whites of his eyes glistened in the reflected
moonlight whitening off the edges of the stayforesail as he turned his
gaze aft, where the figure of the captain walked.
"They've been a-yarning about us half my trick," said Dabb. "The
captain said this pleasuring was a- spoiling of us."
All four united in a low, dismal laugh, which would have been a loud,
defiant, mirthless roar but for the sleepers in the deckhouse hardby
which they were talking. Sleep is counted a sacred thine at seu.
"Ay," exclaimed odb of the young men, who proved to be Mise
Scott, "You lay a man's going to be spoilt by the pleasuring that's to he
done under him. What was said, Joe?" A
"That blarsted Dutchman talks in his beard. That and bis V m
smothered up his voice. I couldn't hear him. T'other was more clealr.
He spoke of sailors as had scuttled their ship, as had broke the captain's
heart by ruinating his voyage and made a widder of his wife by sending
him adrift. T'other speaks, and then the cap'h says what's a sailor's love
like?"
Silence followed.
"What did he mean by a sailor's love?" exclaimed the third man,
MauL "is it a beiaying-pin or a handspike? You'il find he's a-trying to
excite a disgust against us sailors in the mind of that old Dutchman, so
so that he may make a difficulty about paying us at the end of the
voyage. "
" 'Ow d'ye know," said Dabb, "that it ain't the Dutchman who's put
the skipper up to 111-treating of us, reckoning upon sailing into the Thames
with some of us in irons? D'ye mean to say â "
"Whisper, you crow."
"D'ye mean to say," continued the man, lowering his voice, "that tha
stores were shipped without the Dutchman knowing of their character?
I'm a-beeinning to smell hell in this business."
All this while the moon shone sweetly and piercingly. A divine peace
was upon the sea, and the light noises of the wind were as fresh as dew
on grass, with the sound as of the splashing of many fountains. In the
cabin they talked of poetry, and one of the sailors forward was for cutting
the captain's heart out.
The little royal and topgallant sails were half back; the luffs of the
jibs were trembling.
"Trim Mil!" shouted Captain Clew, and he continued to bawl as he
walked slowly forward, "Brace forward the topsail yard. Ease away the
weather braces. Get a drag on your jib-sheets," and it was clear by the
manner in which he delivered thes? orders to the men that he had been
watching and thinking of them all the time they had been ta.king about
him.
All was quiet after this. The moon rolled down into the sea. the
shadow of the earth slipped off the eastern horizon and the schooajter
floated into another tropical morning, wide and high with cloudle.4f
splendor. Nothing was in sight. f
The date was December 15. 1848.
At 10:30 tte steward, a man named Gordon, who had been shipped
for cabin doty, but who had sailed on many occasions as an able seaman,
so that his sympathies were wholly with the forecastle â this man went to
the harness-cask and, unlocking it, picked over some piece* of meat,
brine-whitened, and carried two small cubes of the flesh forward to the
oook.
To be continued next Sunday.Rain in the Canyon.
HJS^HESE days of cold wind and driving
XliV rm ' n nave been a veritable season of
"dirtf discontent to the birds. The pleas
, ant throng that had taken possession of
the willows and the big oaks disappeared
when the storm came, keeping so closely
' to cover that the casual observer might
have thought they had been driven away
altoge ther, but the first day of bright sun
. shine brought them out, if anything, in
greater numbers. I thought I saw this
morning, away up in a tall treetop, a
flash of black and while and red, but the
bird bearing the colors refused to place
himself on exhibition, and although I
lingered for nearly an hour, watching and
listening, I did not get another glimpse
and only caught a few clear, delicious
notes that made me hope the new-comer
' is the black-headed grosbeak. It is early
for him, but he is a weather-wise sort of
. chap and we may feel fairly certain when
he makes his appearance that we shall
not have much more heavy rain.
* With the returning sunshine this week
came the least fly-catcher, the drollest
joke of a bird thai visits us in these parts.
Nature must have been in a humorous
mood when she made the least fly-catcher.
He is a pretty little fellow with his coat of
olive-gray, his dusty vest and black-and
â¢ white wings, but his tiny body supports a
pair of shoulders and a head (he has appa
rently no neck) that an ornithological Her
. cules might bear with pride. Taken alto
gether he is not as big as the goldfinch and
the funny effect of his absurdly big head
: is. heightened by his long, rather flat bill
and a pair of wide-open, round eyes that
seem full of amaze that no one takes him
a.t his own valuation, for tiny as he is he
.possesses in a marked degree the aggres
sive. Inquiring, self-assertive nature that
characterizes all the tyrannidae, to which
family he belongs.
At a little distance, or amid the green
foliage, the least fly-catcher might readily
be mistaken by the uninitiated for the gold
finch, to which, in size and coloring, he
bears a superficial resemblance, but the
goldfinch has a black cap and a graceful
peek and is as slim and flexible as the
fly-catcher is chunky. The latter bird has
a. characteristic way of suddenly flying
â¢ out from amid the foliage of a tree, for the
distance of a yard or two, and as suddenly
returning, as though he were attached by
an invisible cord, to the trunk, and had
unexpectedly got to the end of his tether.
A SAN FRANCISCAN IN ARIZONA'S WONDERLAND--GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO
I\Vfty& PAGE MINOR of Williams.
Jijrifj*^ Ariz., who is well Williams,
*% Ariz., who is well known In
__^!,f San Francisco, recently re
named irom a visit to the agency of the
Ynv?. Supia Indians, in the Grand Canyon
ol the Colorado. He was accompanied on
his journey by S. J. Sullivan, one of the
most intrepid guides to the great gorge.
â¢ Mr. Minor talks most interestingly of
his journey. Telling of it to a Call rep
resentative he said :
"I .left the bustling little town of Wil
liams, Ariz., in a buckboard, drawn by
two ' range horses, on the afternoon of
February 6. As we crossed the 'mesa',
lands we encountered snow, at times
three and four feet deep, and the cold
â¢ north wind made the moisture from our
breath form into icicles on our whiskers.
We. stopped now and then to inspect gold,
copper and iron ledges, and pulled up at
some friendly sheepherder's shack and
â¢spent the night upon our blankets,
before a big blazing fire, to arise in
the' morning to pursue our coarse. Here
and there were great patches of lowlands,
where the snow had melted, and where
were to be seen the eramraa, the alh'lerilla
and other grasses indigenous to the coun
try, upon which thousands of fat sheep
were feeding. â¢ fÂ§n^Â£
"Again we would cut across the country,
leaving the winding roads; and then tnere
were nights of sleeping out in tke cold,
crisp air, with the blue canopy overhead
for our roof. In the daytime herds of
lithesome antelope and deer were to be
seen,, as they fled before the snowstorms
with the jackrabbits and other small
game, fleeing for safety into the moun
tains, while eagles and ravens circled in
tb-e air. Days of sunshine brought to
view the snowclad mountains of Bill
Williams, San Francisco, Kendrick, Sid
grave, Floyd, the Red Butte and the hign
northern walls of the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado River.
"Foi water for our horses and ourselves
we melted the snow, from which we made
our coffee and coofced our meals. After
covering 100 miles, at noon on February
12 we leached tde Indian agency shack,
or small wooden building, in which sup
plies for the Indians are stored. Three
hundred fiet from the shack the mesa, or
tableland be-nch of this npper world,
comes to a short stop between two walls
of limes ione, red and white sandstone,
and onyx, 2000 feet in height, which are
called .'The Hinees of Hell.' One is
startled at the wonderful scene. Far be-
low. sheer down, seemingly into the bowels
of the earth, wcs the great fissure of
'Hualpai,' into which we soon descended
to co through it to the Yava Supai Indian
village, ten miles distant.
"Leaving the buckboard at the shack we
soon were on the trail, with our horses
packed with provisions and blankets. We
wormed around the high southern, cliff of
Cataract Creek, the horses having barely
room 10 place their feet on the narrow
trail. A slip and they would have fallen
1500 feet.

the senses. This part of tne trail is called
'The Tenderfoot's Delight.'

Grand Canyon stood high in the fore
ground, a solid wall, seemingly a great
barrier to mortals. Down into the depths
we went and were aeon on the dry bed of
the creek in Hcck-a-pock Canyon, with
its edge-! lined with 'Palto Mariah' and
willow bushes. As we descended we found
! that the extent of the vegetation de
' creased. The fissure became narrower
| and the wails became higher; fifty or
I more feet of jump-offs were to be seen,
I and around them, over the big boulders,
i hugging the sandstone and porphyry walls,
we led the frightened horses, iollowing
the trail. Now and then lone, narrow
sheets of water were seen, falling from ihe
high encompassing walls, to pour along
the creek's rocky bed and soon to fall over
another precipice of fifty or more feet and
then to disappear under huge boulders,
forming underground streams, only to re
appear a mile or two further oa.
"Over the dry bed of the creek we led
our horses, the precipitous walls reaching
over 1000 feet on each siae of us, and their
top edges being only twenty feet across.
Not a ray of sunlight penetrated these
deep chasms, and it was fearful to look
upward to see only a narrow strip of the
blue sky and to expect the walls to fall
and crush one to death. The echo of our
voices was brougnt weirdly and hoarsely
to us, and the echo of a whisper cou d bo
distinctly beard.
"As we descended into the mighty corge
we hoped that the next turn in the creek
would bring us to a wilier space. But not
so. The great wall of the frowning stone
ledges continued to meet us. But after a
couple of miles we came into a wider space
and to the rim of a great basin where a
descent of sixty feet can be made to its
bottom, which contains about twenty
acres of land. Tuis descent is made ou a
'burro bridge,' or a slide consisting of
long poplar logs corduroyed with smaller
logs and cribbed with stones, one oi the
many of Prospector Sullivan's unique
bridges for transDorting ore from xi is
mines near by. After safely going over
this bridge we turned from the basin and
after traveling 600 yards south finally
reached our destination, the Indian vil
lage, over 7000 feet down into the 'lower
world.'
'Here, situated in the bottom land ot
the Cataract Canyon on a 'rise,' it li.c
agency, consisting of a limestone and
sandstone one-story house occupied by
Professor R. C. Bauer, the teacher at the
aeency. Mrs. Bauer and their little son
Warner, and Charles Bushnell, the farmer
of the agency, and a substantial school
house, recently built of limestone and
marble by Mr. Bushnell alone. Mr. Bush
nell quarried the stones from the high,
cliffs, brought the Lumber on burros from
the heights, and with his trowel, saw and
hammer built a monument to himself
which will only decay with the stupendous
walls overhanging it.
"The dividing wails of the canyon here
stand 1200 feet high, and across the little
dell the distance is only SOO feet. Along
the eastern wall the Cataract Creek flows
north over the pebbles to a little vyÂ»liey
three miles in length and about hall a
mile wide. There are 350 acres of the soil
cultivated by the Supais, under the super
visicp of Professor Bauer and Farmer
Bushnell.
"The Supais have been a peaceable tribe
of Indians, and it is their boast that they
have ruver been at war with the 'Hikos'
(white people). They were, in the dim
past, of the Hualpai tribe. Dissensions
arose among them and a hundred or more
braves seceded and took refuge in this val
ley. They built fortresses on the edges of
the hich walls, from which they hurled
stones down upon their enemieÃ, the
Hualpais and the Navajoes. Peace was
finally restored and to-day the Supais and
Hualpais are friendly, out they keen a
sharp eye on the Navajoes, who occasion
ally steal from tlieni a squaw or a child.
"During the fifties, when the Mormons
were converting the Indian tribes to their
faith, John D. Lee, the same miscreant
who was shot to death in Utah for the
hand he took in the Mountain Meadow
massacre, came into these deep recerses
with two of his white wives and converted
the Yava Supais to his faith. He planted

the nest with horse-hair and plant-down.
Like all the tiy-catchers, tbe Minimus is
no singer, though he looks as though he
ought to be one, bnt during the mating
reason the male has an absurd, ascending
cry, delivered on the wing, which has
been aptly interpreted: "Chebec, tooral
ooral! Chebec, tooral-oora 1 !" and with
this his musical accomplishments close.
During the tierce, long-continued rains
of the week most of the birds sought
shelter in the deep canyons, and in one of
these, where I was indulging in a rainy
day prowl, I came upon a disconsolate
for them peach and apricot trees, and re
mained with them for n season, until the
beans, corn and pumpkins were harvested.
Since that time the tribe, which now con
sists of 300 souls, increased in numbers.
The land is tilled by the Indians to corn,
bean?, sunflowers (from which meal is
made from the seed) pumpkins, sorghum
cane and watermelons, peach, apricot and
fig trees, and alfaifa. By irrigation, water
from the creek is carried to the rich red
sedimentary soil, and the results obtained
are remarkable. In the cracks and caves of
the high wails of the valley caches ere
made, in which corn, beans and dried
fruit are placed and sealed with the ce
ruent found plentifully in the creek beds,
for the winter and spring consumption.
The domiciles or 'wickiups' consist of
willow and arrow wood boughs, the roofs
being made of the same materials, and
covered with alfalfa hay. Tne buck usu
aiiy has two Fquaws. Tne entire family
sleeps together, but when the children
become 10 or more years of age they are
allotted corners of tho 'teepes.' Their
morals nre good; far beyond those of
other Indian tribes.
"When sickness comes to them they cure
or kill themselves by 'sweating.' Sap
iings of the poplar tr"eea are placed in a
conical shape on the ground and covered
with blankets. The sick Indian crawls
into this little sweathouso in the dress
nature cave him. Hot stones are thrown
in to him and he is left for hours to sweat
and grow thin. Up to two years ago cre
mation of the dead was in vogue amonc
these Indians. Wlien a buck died his fa
vorite horse was burned with him; and
peach trees were cut down and burned
with the bodies of the squaws, along with
their beads and other trinkets. Down on
the lower bench from the village I visited
the old crematory and gathered many
pieces of the charred bones of the dead
ana b.>ads and other trinkets which had
been melted into a compact mas?. I
gathered a large bag of the charred con
glomerates, and, thoupii cruel to state, I
pressed a young Indian boy into service
by having liim carry acroÂ«s his shoulder,
up the "crematory trail, 1 the remains of
his ancestors.
"As one <;oes along the trail in Iho little
valley the now budtline fruit tree?,
patches of alfalfa, the willow, birch and
arrowwood trees showing their tirst early
leaves, with here and there a wild flower,
and the native green grasses with the lit
tle canal?, the whole being inclosed in the
stupendous white and gray walls guarded
tongragation of wrens, finches, robins and
buntings, huddled for protection on a
tough amia the thick fo'.uee of a red
wood tree. I caught the branch, to save
myself, as I swung down the slippery
trail, and the birdlings rushed out. The
rain was sheeting down in broadsides
from the strip of leaden sky just visible
between the tops of the hills towering
:iigh above U3, and the startled flock flew
heavily, with many a protest, to another
tree, where they perched and huddled
again, a picture of discomfort. A single
Drown towhee, sleek and trim, was peer
ing about in the toft leaf-mould with the
air of mackintosbed and overshoed satis
faction that this bird always wears in a
storm. lam sure I do not know where
in lies the secret of his unfailing content
ment. He is the plainest of our birds.
He cannot sing; he has only this charm
of unfailiug, brisk cheeriness and gentle
acceptance alike of sunshine and cloud to
recommend him to us, but he is aiway3 a
welcome sight about garden or hedge.
It was interesting to note the effects of
tbe storm in the deep canyon. Here
flows a swift, deep stream that is always
cold and clear. Evidently the wind had
been et work, for clear across the creek,
its spreading arms lifted in appealing pro
test against fate, lay a great alder, broken
squarely off some si^ feet from the base.
I heard thesharp "tap! tap!" of a wood
pecker's horny ax on it as I approached
and saw the bird fly off. A good carpen
ter is known by his chips, and this one
left behind him quite a pile of clean-cut bits
of the hard, yellow wood. Crawling un
der the trunk of the fallen tree I came face
to face with a huge snail trailing over a
moss-grown rock just above me. I got a
glimpse of a queer, doclike visa"c, with
snub nose and bright eyps, and than the
creature pulled its hoodlike, soft shell
down over its head and I could see only
its rounded, resolule-looking shoulders.
I poked it in the back, but it only
hunched itself together a lir.le more and
rolled over and over. I could not get an
other peep at its head. Going forward I
soon found my progress burred by a land
slide. The softened earth above had
given way and slipped down into the deep
cut and the bare gray bones of the
mountain lay glistening wet wih the
driving rain. The mosses were already
creeping up to cover them, and tiny spires
of the nor etail had b^guit growing wnere
I do not think horsetail had grown before
for generations. Probably the spores had
been uncovered by the slide and the queer,
belated rush was making the most of this
unexpected opportunity to renew its life.
Climbing up through the exposed roots
of a great redwood stump, a relic of the
forest primeval, I drove a woodrat scam
pering from bis haunts, and I came out in
tbe midst of a mass of nodding white
flowers, one of the crucifertc, the spring
cress, I think. Its cheery blossoms were
about the only things in the canyon that
by 'the goils,' two great pillars of white
limestone standing high oa the northern
walls, he has before him a most beautiful
picture of nature. There are at present
eighty Indians in the village, the others
of the tribe being in the 'upper world,' in
the forests and mountains, hunting and
\isiting their neighbors, the Hualpais,
near Pouch Springs, and trading with
them their dried peaches and corn for
blankets and trinkets.
"The Supais have been in hard luck for
the past season. A flood came upon them
last August and destroyed many of their
fruit trees, their corn and beans, and ap
peals have been made to the charitable to
aid them. Clothes, young fruit trees and
seeds are necessities with them, and if
any of these wants are sent to Henry fcw
mg, the eeneral agent of the Supai3 and
Hualpais, at Hackberry, Aris., the In
dians' blessing!> will be on the kind and
generous givers. The Government has
been appealed to, but by the time it acts
'Lo, the poor Indian,' may have been gath
ered to his fathers.
"Since Professor Bauer's advent amone
the Supais he has abolished their custom
of burning dead bodies, and they are now
placed in the crevices in the high wall 3
and sealed with the natural cement, and
no more fruit trees or horses are destroyed
as a part of a funeral ceremony.
"Professor Bauer is a man of humanity
and has wrousht many good reforms
among the Indians. The Government
furnishes rations to only the children at
tending school, and the Micks and squnws
have to 'hustle' for a livine. They barter
dried fruits, corn and sunflower meal with
other tribes for blankets and pelts. The
?quaws make beautiful willow and graÂ«s
baskets, dyed with the natural pigments
found in the walls of the canyons, and
water jugs of the willow covered with the
wax of the pinon tree, which they sell
totheHikoson their pilgrimages to the
'upper world.'
"The present chief of the tribe is Na
vajo (a singular coincidence, ns the Na
vajo tribe arc their enemies), an infirm o!d
chieftain of SO years. He has a council 01
nine other lesser chiefs, ami they at times
veto h\< final determination of a knotty
question.
"An aspirant for thp chieftainship, after
Navajo. is called Week-e-a-le-a-la, the
Spirit God of the tribe. He is a noble
looking Indian, 35 years of age, named
Vernier. He has caused his superstitious
brothers to venerate him, as iney ven'T

unsqueezed sponges, but the little four

It is surprising how much rain seems to
find its way down into a canyon. One

two high hiiis might escape its notice, but
it pours down from above ; it sweeps in on
the searching wind; it flows down the
wooded banks from the upper earth. It
whips and patters among the thick
branches and plays musically upon the
broad leaves of the water-loving plants,
and it roars along the rocky bed of the
stream at the bottom until everything is
wetter than the proverbial drowned rat.

the departed souls inhabit, he would be

probably chief of the Hualpais. Vesmer,

"The Cataract Creek rises from a great

above the schoolhouse. The water gushes
lorth in a large volume, its temperature
being seventy- three degrees above zero.
It contains lime and magnesia and has ex
cellent medicinal properties. Along the
banks for two miles innumerable warm
springs teed the stream until it becomes a
swift river.
"For six miles the river rushes along,
forming beautiful cascades and grand
waterfalls. Among them are the Navajo,
twenty feet wide with a thirty-foot fall;
â¢he Supai (meaning blue water), ten feet
in width and sixty feet fall; the Bridal
Veil, 200 feet in width and 175 feet
fall ; the Mooney, twenty feet in width and
400 feet fall; the Beaver, sixteen feet in

most beautiful cascades, and as the water
falls upon the ferns, twigs and leaves the

seen was a pillar of gold and silver ora
standing off from one of the high wa!L? of
the canyon, its height being over Â£00 leet
and its base over 2000 feet in circumfer

as Sullivan's Pillar of Gold, 8. J. Sullivan

"The Colorado River in an air line is
only five mile 3 from the agency, but to
reach the point where the Cataract Creek
empties into it requires a circuitous and
most laborious journey or twelve miles
around the great fissures. We made the
trip half the distance on burros and the
other half on foot, ana by climbing up
the 'washes,' now and then hanging by
our eyebrows, scaling the almost perpen
dicular walls, crawling under great ledges
of rock, we reached the high mesa land,
where for the moment we were bewildered
with intoxication of delight with the
grandest views imaginable. From the
edge of Meteor Point, where we stood, to
the north, the northern walls of the Grand
Canyon stood high toward heaven, above
the Colorado River, their tops covered
with forestÃ. The sun gleams brought
out all the beautiful cardinal colors and
their shades on the ledges of this stupen
dous wall, which extended forty or more
miles. Mountains were under us; moun
tains towered above us, now broken by a
seemingly large plateau, with great black
zigzag lines in it, being tne dark fissures
or narrow canyons, from which we had
emerged. One mile to the east stood a
massive rocky mountain, resembling a
mammoth water tank, called by the In
dians after their god Week-e-a-le-a-la. It
is two miles in circumference at its base
and 6000 ieet high.
"To the northeast a great rod 'wash,' or
slide, on the walls shone like a big blot of
blood, and further in the same direction a
point, called Point Sublime, stood like a
great peninsula running out on the mesa.
Off to the east the blue northern and
southern walls seemed to meet, forming a
huge basin, their edges covered witli
snow. Two miles to tne south, standing a
thousand feet above us, was an isolated
mountain of stone covering 400 acres, its
northern end seemingly wrought into
long white pillars, the whole mountain
resembling pictures of King Solomon's
Temple, whose name it bears. Three
miles to thn west was a big mass of red
oxide of iron, standing far from the lime
stone and sandstone walls, its height be
ing over 600 feet, and its base 3000 feet in
circumference. With the red oxide there
is blended nickel, antimony and meteoric
iron, and it is the belief of those who
have seen it that it is a fallen meteor, and
it is cailed 'The Fallen Meteor. 1 The fall
ing of it is beyond the ken of the Supais.
To tbo southwest the southern grayisb
blue walls stood in their precipitous
heights, their jagged tops forming church
spires ana every conceivable structure.
"The great series of terraces of the
north wall leading down to tne Colorado
River are veritable titan stairways. Walls,
grand monuments of the erosion or up
heaval of nature, disappear in the azure
beyond, and the isolated buttes wero
sublime. The crooked black lines we saw
seemingly a few hundred rods beyond,
looking like Indian trails, were tba
walls of Cataract Creek, which, by the
irresistible process of erosion, has cut
into the bowels of the earth 3cven thou
sand and more feet.

EVENTS OF THE WEEK IN SOCIETY
'JlrJlikS MIGHT have been expected the first
j-JitzSW week of Lent was rather quiet and un
-4^la7 interesting in the world of society.
A few little luncheons, an occasional' dinner
find informal t a, were some of the few breaks
to the dull monotony of the season of devo
tion.
To be musical seems to be the popular thing
during the Lanlen season and the opera at
the California Tneater was the occasion for a
swell gathering and many opera parties.
Mme.T. B. Ziska gave U>e first of what is going
to prove a most delightful series of "talks'' at
ber home, 1728 Sacramento street, on Friday
(â venlns;. Professor Saleberger entertained
the guests wit li his lecture on "French Wit
and Humor" Tho lecturer spoke in Euglish,
giving his illustrations in French.
Mr. and Mrs. John O'Neill Reis gave a theater
party at the California last Wednesday eveu
iug to witness the first performance of the
French Oj>era Company. Among their guests
were Miss Brooks, Miss McNutt, E. A. Wiltsee,
ami L. S. Adams.
General K. P. Chipman of the State Board of
Trade, Mrs. Chipma:i and Miss Chipman were
the guests of honor at a dinner given on Sun-
day at the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Mills.
The members of Sorosis gave a matinee tea
last Saturday, in their clubrooms on Pine
street, in honor of Mrs. William J. Younger,
â who left for Chicago last Wednesday. The
. honored guest is one of the charter members
ot the club. The guests were received by the
president, Mr*. William B. Carr, Mrs. Younger,
Mrs. F. G. Sanb;>ru, Mrs. George G. Carr. Mrs.
H. E. Huntington, Mrs. George Law Smith,
Mrs. Josephine dc Greayer and the Misses
Younger. Beautiful flowers graced the rooms,
light refreshments were served and an orches
tra played confer; selections, all of which
tended to make the affair cheeiful and enjoy
able.
Mrs. \Y. ,T. Dutton gave a delightful lunch
party last Tuesday in the private dining-room
at the Ho'el'B'sUa Vistn. The affair was in

|\J 'â â¢ i 3 a grand and beautiful custom; it
l[Ym^ not only brings a peaceful calm
into crowded, busy lives, but it lifts the
heart and brain into purer, better atmos
phere. There is always a mysterious
spirituality about the weeks of Lent which
seems to unite the peoples of this earth in
close and sweet communion.
It is a universal ob-servance, and one
which is beneficial to the weak-hearted
ana faltering onesâ "For what shall it
profit a man if he shall gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?"
Lent gives a lot of folks the chance to
repent for sins committed, and guard
against further offenses.
Recently a busy-brained writer on a
New York paper expressed the opinion that
L iiit was a very absurd custom because it
lowered the price of labor, threw hundreds
of nursegirls, chambermaids, butlers,
valets and ladles' maids out of employ
ment on account of the quiet lives and
simple household methods the majority
of folks adopt during the Lenten season.
The writer was too prejudiced to admit
that in the meantime millions of people
benefit by the good old custom.

& MINERS
|""*^TATE Mineralogist A. S. Cooper, who
JUk^r will assume the duties of the office
ySr.'J with th Â® coming month, has decided
to make no changes in either the
office or field staff of the Mining Bureau for
at least a considerable time, probably a turn
months.
"A man would be stupid to go into such an
office and go to making changes iv the organ
ized working force until he had become fa
miliar with the work and the men." says Mr.
Cooper. -'I want to first become thoroughly
acquainted with the work and needs of the
institution and if I make any changes it will
' be some time in the future."
, One oi tne things that has always impaired
the -efficiency of the Minim? Bureau has been
â¢ the fact that it has always been too raucn of a
political institution and "pulls" rather than
executive ability, scientific attainments and
practical mining experience have placed the
men who have done the work. If there is a
State institution besides the university which
should be kept out of partisan politics it is the |
Mining Bureau.
. The seventy-second meeting of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers at Chicago last
month was exceptionally successful, and re
tulted in the addition of many valuable
Vipers to the literature of the mining industry.
K. - ? will be generally read in the published j
/â transactions." Regarding them, a member
writes:
"Thtee papers, all of which will be properly
illustrated when presented, exhibited in a
striking way the chief element in the recent
progress of American mining and metallurgy,
namely, the mechanical handling of large
â¢ masses of material. I refer to Mr. Lewis' paper
on the Chicago Drainage Canal. Professor Den
ton's paper on Mining Methods in Northern
Minnesota and Mr. Sahlin's paper on the
Handling of Material at the Blast Furnace-
President Spilsbury in his address on the !
progress of the last decade did not fail to
recognize the importance of this factor, which
has largely revolutionized practice at the mine
and the furnace."
A new and vigorous effort will be made to 'â 
pass the mineral lands bill at the extra ses
sion of Congress. Tirey.L. Ford, chairman ot
the legislation committee of the Miners' Associ
ation, will convene the committee within two
, weeks to take - action, and there are strong
hopes of success.
-This bill to provide for the segregation of
the mineral sections of the railroad lands in
: California and Oregon has once passed -both
I houses of Congress, it may be recalled. It has
had the vigorous championship of the Cali
fornia delegation and the hostility of Secre
tary Hoke Smith and of Lamoreaux, the Com
missioner of the General Land Office. In the
lower house it passed without open opposi
. tion on a viva voce vote, and in the Senate it
similarly passed with amendments.
On its return to the House a conference com
mittee was not secured and it went to the Com
r.:::eeon Public Lands, where it died because j
Us friends were x not able to get it again before I
the House, mainly because of the attitude of
â  Speaker Reed.
Mr. Ford says that the bill as amended by
the Senate will be introduced as a new
bill, probably by Perkins in the Senate and
Bar ham in the House. Some of the friends of
the measure in the last Congress will be j
missed, notably Dubois of Idaho, chairman of I
the Senate Committee on Public Lands, and .
i Bowers in the House. On the other hand it is
yxpected that the attitude of the new admin
â¢jtrution will be friendly to the miners.
â  The growth of interest in copper mining is
becoming a striking feature of the mining de
velopment of the Western part of America,
and the near future will undoubtedly show a
large increase in the copper output of Cali
fornia. So much more attention is being given
to copper mining simply because the demand
'is so great, the supply so short and the price
so much better than in past years, with pros
pects of its remaining so for some time.
At the close of the year the world's visible
Eupply of the metal was very low, and it is
â¢ row still lower, with a very active demand.
Tiie world is using a tremendous amount of
topper these days and wants more of it every
year, as electrical construction increases. Just
now the demand lrom Europe is espe
cially ective, and it will remain active for
Fome time. The increased demand from
Europe is due mainly to the rapid increase in
electrical work there and to the needs of war

HELD AT NASHVILLE, TEKX., FEB. 22.
The executive committee of the American
Whist League met at Nashville. Term., and

en ih annual congress, to be held at Put-in-
B*y, Lake Erie, July 6-10:

iv the final play lor the Hamilton, A. W. L.
and Miuneapolis trophies.
The general rules for all contests are prac
tically iht same as governed the sixth con
gress. Payers who take part in the Hamil
material. With ihe industrial world consum
ing all the copper produced about as fast as it
can be shipped from the smelters, and with
prices good ar.d a growing demand ahead it is
but natural that cooper raining should take
on a new development Not only has a great
amount of new capital been put Into work
ing copper mines within the past year or two,
but there has been c more general prospect
ing for copper ore since it has again become a
good thing.
English capital has greatly increased the
output of the Anaconda miiies, old and new
mines in Arizona are being developed on
a large scale, the big Iron Mountain
mine in this State is having its capacity
doubled, and sim lar reports regarding the re
opening or more extensive working of copper
mines come from various parts of the Pacific
Coast.
Along with them come a succession of Dig
stories about great discoveries of copper ore,
mainly from the Northwest, especially from
British Columbia. We hear of the discovery
of a three-foot ledge of "solid native copper"
in Kittitas County, Washington, of the largest
copper led go in the world by Loughbrough
Inlet, British Columbia, of other finds which
show the Northwest to be rich in cooper and
capable of a great output. The copper product
of 1897 promises to greatly exceed that of
1890. How soon Increased supply will paBS
the demand and bring lowering prices and a
reaction remains to be seen.
California has but one noteworthy copper
mine now producing. That is the large prop
erty of the Mountain Mines Company, Lim
ited, on Iron Mountain, Shasta County. AH
the other mines in tne State which were
worked in the past are lying idle, or practi
cally so. In Amador County, which once
yielded a large output, the only work that has
been done for along time is the leaching of
tai ings. Copper mines are strung Out length
of the State from Del Norte to San Diego, and
some of them will likely make their mark ns
producers some day, but no important move
ments are on foot so far, except the opera
tions of the big Scotch syndicate in Shasta
County referred to.
MINING MISCELLANY.
Captain J. R. de Lawar has srrrendered the
option on a majority of the stock of the Mercur
Gold Mining and Milling Company, which he
has held for some time. The option was at
$7 50 a share, or at the rate of $1,500,000 for
the property, and his examination convinced
him that tue price was 100 high,
The 60-horsepower gasoline engine which
will run the Cornish pumps in the Rawhide
mine is being put in place.
James Cronan has resignei the superinten
dent}- of the Uaie & Xorcross mine and will
devote himself to his British Columbia inter
ests.
A prospecting smelter, with & capacity of
ten tons per tweniy-four hours, is being
erected in Clear Creek, Shasta County, to
demonstrate the successful smelting of ores
from Mule Mountain and the South Fork.
The Darling mine, near Georgetown, El Do
rado County, is reported to have been sold to
Jirnn D. Alvardo of London for $40,000. The
mine has been developed to a depth of 200
fret, ana has been idle for some time.
At the Schoedcn mine, Blskiyou County,
seven miles from Yreka, work is progressing
steadily. A large quantity of ore at toe tenth
level, at a depth of 1200 feet, is being stoped
out for crushing.
W. B. Jeffrey, a mining engineer of London,
has been examining mining properties In the
Western States and in British Colombia for
the past lour months, and is now in Califor
nia.
The production of pig iron In the United
States at the opening of this year was at the
weekly rate of 161,000, or about the same as
two years ago.
Sampling-works have been opened at Johan
nesburg, the near neighbor cf Randsburg,
affording a convenience to miners with
small quantities of ore to sell. Fifty-two
claims were filed with the recorder of the
Rand district during the week ending March
5. Randsburg has elected three school trust
ees, is taking up a collection for a Bchool
house and will soon have education under
way.
A rich strike Ss reported to have been made
in Kern County in an old shaft that successiva
miners have worked and abandoned as useless
for years. It is the old Edith mine, near
| ton, A. W. L. and Minneapolis trophy con
j tests must be members of the clubs they repre
sent, but any players, whether members of the
same club or not, may enter together fur the
progressive "fours" and "pairs" contests and
straight whist contest.
The main differences between the pro
grammes of the sixth nnd seventh congresses
lie in that the entries for the Hamilton
trophy contest are not divided into sections,
that the A. W. L. trophy play runs through
the entire week, that a progressive four or
pair match is provided for every afternoon
and evening during the week, except Monday
and Satnrday, and that the play for the Min
neapolis trophy only extends over three days.
There are more contests provided lor than
at any previous congress, and there will be no
time during the week when delegates not in
any of the trophy contests cannot find some
thing to compete Jor. The one sitting matches
are expected to be popular.
The y\. W. L. Trophy Gontest
This contest is the principal whist-playing
feature cf the midwinter meeting. When the
trophy is won by an Eastern club at the con
gress, it is surrendered to the league and
played for by a picked Western club et the
midwinter meeting. Tnis year the clubs
chosen to represent the East and West in the
midwinter match for the American Whist
League trophy were the Albany Club and the
St. Paul Whist Club. The match was played
on Saturday, February 20, the teams being:
Albanyâ Smith (captain), Snow, Lodge and
Muhlfelder. St. Paulâ Briggs (captain), Bron
son, Gordon and Metcalf. Much to the sur
prise of every one, and to the great disap
pointment of the entire West, the Albany club
won, and won on its merits, the margin of
tricks in its favor being 100 large to admit any
claims of adverse luck. Still there were pal

Glenvllle. W. I* Gilbert ana John Pierce were
the last to try the property, retimbering the
shaft and putting in a new pump and a
blower. The ore lies in kidney form. Its
assay value is not given, but it is said that
good offers for the miue have been refused,
and the strike is another evidence of the gold
resources ot Kern County.
Three of the best claims near the town of
Bandsburg have been bought fot $31,600 by
J. J. Brown of Leadville and J. A. Shinu of
Denver. The claimÃ are the Excelsior, J. I. C
and the Big Wedge. Development work has
been begun, and the effect of the sale titfa
work is already felt in the camp, which w*lts

Some thief stole a lot of tools tfnd powder
from Gardner H. Smith, which he had stored
in the tunnel on the Success. Usually there is
little or no thieving in mining camps, and It
will probably soon be that way here, lor
several miners have taken steps already look

The old gravel channel at San An tone camp,
Calaveras County, which in early days yielded
great riches, is again being opened by Pairano
and Lee. Water was the great drawback in
early days, when the bed of the San Antone
was worked and the channel made famous by
its yields.
A. deed was signed in Bishop last week con
veying title to the Wild Rose mine from Harry
McNamara and Fat Dowa to W. & Couch and
G. P. D iyle. The purchase price is $10,000.
The mine, eight miles from Benton, has been
idle for years. The work formerly done was
limited, comprising a 100-foot tunnel and 130
--foot shaft, but in this over $300,000 was taken
out. Later Joseph McDermott sunk a 60-foot
shaft, Undine only base ore. The Banner mill,
three miles distant, will be placed in shape to
work the ore. This mill has not been used for
thirteen years. A concentrating plant will be
used at once, and if cyaniding experiments
give satisfactory results a cyanide plant will
be added.â lnyo County Register.
The miners of the Rand district, Kern
County, have ordained as follows: The
area of a mining claim in the Rand
miuing district shall be as now. by
the United States mining laws provided,
not to exceed 1500 feet in length,
with 300 feet on each side of the vein or lode,
and such surface boundaries shall be marked
by five monuments, one at each corner, with
an initial monument at the point of discov
ery, each monument to be not less than 1%
feet high, with a notice placed thereon, show

relation to the same.
The first hoisting engine in the Rand dis
trict, Kern County, Cal., has just been erected
on the King Solomon mine, on which it is the
intention of the owners to sink 500 feet.
At the Magalia mine, Butte County, owned
by Rideout & Haggin, and consisting of 1100
acres of gravel, the new shaft is 512 feet deep.
The pumping is all done by compressed air,
reheated below by steam. Originally the
whole volume of water was raised to the sur
face, butSiiperintendent Uassaway now pumps
it to t.ie 300 level, where it is discharged
through the old works iuto the creek beyond.
A steam hoist at the bottom of the shaft hoists
the gravel lrom the face of the gangway to
the shaft, at present a distance of 1100 feet.
Every mine on Magalia Ridge, Butte County,
is in operation, and 500 men are employed
there and on Butte Creek.
Ex-Congressman J. A. Louttit has bonded
from Mrs. J. Valdel her mine on the west
slope of French Hill, Calaver.is County, and a
contract has bean let to sink a shaft to the
depth of 50 teet on the lead.
The New York correspondent of the London
Mining Journal has this to say about Cali
fornia diamonds: "It is not, I think, gen
erally understood that the United States is
likely enough sooner or later to become a
diamond-producing country. Records of un
questionable trustworthiness exist of dia
monds having been found in Virginia and
Nonh Carolina, but the mot-t productive State
hitherto has been California. The first an
nouncement of California diamonds was in
ISSO, in Sillimaii's Journal, and since
then many genuine discoveries have
from time to time been reported. The
chief localities have been nenr Cherokee,
in Butte County; near Placerville, In El
Dorado County; French Corral, in Nevada
j County, and several places in Amador
County. In Trinity County also some very
minute diamond crystaln have been found.
Professor F. Woehler of Gottingen some years
ago examined samples of the 'platinum
1 sands' of Triniiy River. After removing gold,
j platinum, chrome iron, silica, ruthenium,
etc., by the usual methods be observed the
j residue microscopically and found numerous
colorless, transparent grains, which he pre
sumed to be diamonds. Subsequent combus
tion in oxygen and precipitation from baryta
water convinced him that the microscopic
crystals were true diamonds.

North and South 4. East and West 9.
Trick Iâ North has all but one of the cards
higher than his partner's fourth-best.
Trick 2â The writer will not criticize the
trump lead. The club suit is the only weak
spot.
Trick 4â East can place one trump with
South and two with North. Also he marks
West with the king orqueen ot hearts. If East
can get the command of his suit and the lead
he can lead the best trump and make the suit.
Sha'.l he iead high and trust to dropping the
queen, or shall he lead to force out the queen
in the hope that West may get the lead and
give him a return of the suit? Does not
North's trump lead make it seem quite proba
ble that he has the queen rather than any one
other player? If so, what is the chance of its
being double guarded? If East leads the ace
and king, should West play the queen to the
second load?
li Kast held nothing but small cards, aside
from the ace and king, the writer thinks he
should certainly lead his fourth best.
Trick sâ East sees that North does not hold
the queen. He now leads the winning trump
in the hope that it will drop to the ace and
king if South has it. If West has it he must
surely play it.
We ask our readers to send in comments on
the play.
John T. Mitchell, of duplicate whist fame.
says he would have led the ton of trumps and
the men who had found some of tne more
noted California diamonds, and was shown
the exact places of the discoveries. The finds
all happened in washing gold from the gravel
that underlies the volcanic cap, and it is a
moot question whether the gems were properly
constituents of the lower or upper formation.
But that they were merely specimens of far
greater numbers cannot be doubted, and any
adventurous spirit who may be willing to risk
a little capital on the chance of discovering a
large fortune might easily do worse than to
engage in diamond-hunting at Upper Ran
cheria."
Smokeless powder is coming into use for
mining purposes.
A rock-crusher with a capacity of 1000 tons
a day has been ordered for the Mercur mine in
Utah.
The prohibition of tho employment of
Chinese in quartz mines is being agitated in
British Columbia.
A Government inspector for each mining
district in British Columbia, to report on the
actual condition of each mine, has been
recommended by the Board of Trade of Revel
stoke.
In Cripple Creek more low-grade ores are
being treated this year than ever before. The
building of new reduction plants has brought
down the cost f/ and lower grades are being
treated than has heretofore bsen possible.
Much of the ore of this class is being held as
an investment, the owners believing that treat- '
mer.t costs will be still further reduced.
Red-Hair Graze
snd Men's Joupees
Â£9SLHE bleached blonde has lost pres-
JMss If my lady wish to please Dame
Fashion then must she not only brush her
hair to silky smoothness, but use the tea
of henna to make it red.
"The law allows it and tbe court de
mands it."
So the up-to-date young woman will
procure this leaf and apply it.
Red locks of any shade will bring her
into favor, from the beautiful Titian hue
to tbat which in bygone school days
would have forced upon her the disgrace
ful appellation of "bricktop."
But "Bricktop's" turn has come, and
those who once jeered now envy, for she
to-day is queen. Queen for how long a
period none can tell, as fickle fashion,
like tho weatber, has its vicissitude?.
Hair of inky blackness may be trans
formed to ensnaring auburn ii the victim
will but spend the time and money. Sue
must hie to the artiste with at least $15 in
her inside pocket. If her hair be long and
heavy and she a little wise she will se
crete an extra gold note or two in her
pouch, as tbe price of vanity varies ana
the artiste of reputation is never cheap.
The time to be sacrificed is about ten
hours, tbe process being slow and tedious.
Usually at 9 a. m. the operation begins.
The henna leaf, ground to a powder, is
mixed with water and forms a paste like
mud, which must be applied to every root
and strand of iiair. This done, tbe paste
is let thoroughly dry and then is removed
by a shampoo knowr. only to the hair
dresser, which, with a massage, completes
the treatment, and my lady at 7 p. m. is
rewarded for her expenditure of patience,
time and money with tresses of a bewitch
ingly warm glow.
Every live weeks she must return foi re
touching of the roots, as the hair in that
time grows about a quarter of an inch,
and if she wish to keep it all one color she
must watch and persevere, so exacting is
the mistress to whom she has vowed alle
giance.
It has been discovered tbat the climate
of California has the effect of causing pre
maturely gray hair, particularly with the
native born.
It is a common fact that many girls of
only 16 yeaÂ»s have to use a hair dye. This
climatic influence and the fad now in
vogue accomplishes the good result of
making the manufacture and sale of birir
dye a paying business.
The once very remunerative employ
ment of bairdressing has within the last
four years suffered not only from the de
pression of the times but from overcrowd
ing, so those who now secure the best re
ceipts for hair restorers, vigors and dyes
will have a change of luck that may short
ly pave tho way to a neat fortune.
An industry which, too, brings a ready
requital is the making of the muc! -talked
of toupee. The toupee costs anywhere
from $12 50 to $35, and the man of means
resorts to this device to hide his weak
nessâthat bald spot
Ho can have it made and adjusted with
out fear of detection, as every hair-dres-
then tbe high clubs. It Is true that North's
lead cf trumps makes it look as though he
must have the queen of Clubs twice guarded,
but if that is so, south may have but one o
none, and may work in his small trump, be
sides letting his partner make the queen, if
the knave is led. In any event, the writer
would not lead the knave. If he were going
to lead any card but the ace it would be the
five or tray. If the knave went to the queen
fourth in hand he would never expect his
partner to return the club when he got in.
Aside from the reasoning that North must
have the guarded queen of clubs, because he
led the trumps, there is strong probability
that tho queen will fall irom one of the hands
on the second rotind, or be in your partner's
liriTKl. Jn either of these cases the high lead
makes the most tricks, unless your partner,
with the queen, fails to unblock, wnicn he
manifestly ought to do if you lead the third
round of trumps at trick 4.
(jeorge Is. Bunn or\ Finessing.
Every line that comes from tbe pen of G. L.
Bunn and John H. Briggs is worth 100 cents
on the dollar, ana should be put away in your
whist scrapbook. Tbe following is from the
St. Paul ulooe, written by Mr. Bunn:
Much is raid in the books on the subject of
finesse; the different kinds of finesse are de
scribed and discussed, and rules are formu
lated; we do not think that this important
subject has been very clearly or satisfactorily
treated by the authorities; indeed, rules can
not be applied very far to the subject of
finesse; it is possible to make a few very gen
eral ones, but the rest must be left to the judg
ment of the player. The only finesse that is
permitted on an original lead from partner of
his long suit is tbe play of queen when hold
ing ace, queen and one or more others; the
finesse of j*ck from king, jack is bad whist;
the finesse of jack from ace, jack and one or
more others is permissible in certain cases,
but ordinarily ace is the best play ; the play of
any card of the suit other than the highest,
except In the above cases, and where the third
hand holds two or more cards in sequence,
and except where the card led indicates that
no card of the suit lower than the highest
card held by third hand can win the trick,
ought not to be considered good whist.
We thoroughly disapprove of the practice
that was so common a short time ago of
"finessing by the eleven rule," that is, passing
a card led by partner, where sn application of
the eleven rule shows that there is but one i
card of the suit with the adversaries higher
than the card led. This is permissible only in
cases where the missing card must be ace,
king or queen, and then only when the other
cards in tbe player's hand are such as to justify
his taking chances, as tenace strength in the
other suits or trump strength. An instance of
this occurred in a deal played in the match
â¢gainst Duiuth. South led eight of diamonds,
West played small, and .North, with ice, ten
ing salon is provided with a private room
where be can be smuggled in and his at
tendant is sworn to secrecy. How the
toupee is kept on the head has been a sub
ject of much cogitation. The way is sim
ple. It is done with abont twelve small
pieces of plaster having adhesive qualities
on both sides; these are attached to the
toupee and it is pressed to the head, where
without danger of detachment, it will re
main for twelve days, at the expiration of
which time a renewal is necessary.
The existence of the toupee has another
merit worthy of mention in this, that its
use may prove of great benefit to society,
as it will do away with what has long been
known as the "bald-headed row," seen
mostly at the theaters when the ballet is
in town.
But again to the starting pomt â
woman's crown of eloryâ for since her
creation has woman's hair been admired
and considered her richest personal gift.
It has been a favorite subject both with
minstrel and poet. Biblical mention is
made of it when Judith prepared herself
for her journey to the camp of Holofernes.
It tells us that her raven hair was plaited
and adorned with jewels. The coddess of
beauty, Venus, is described as "riding on
the waves in a seashell, her shimmering
hair floating about her and crowned with
roses." Tennyson sings its praises and
makes it an agent of charity in helping
Godiva save her people from the dreaded
tax:
Anon she shook her head,
And showered the rippled ringlets to her knee;
and Goethe dwells on its power of fascina
tion when he advises:
Beware of her fair hair, for she excels
All women in the magic of her locks,
Ana when she winds them round a young
man's neck
Sbe will not set bim free again.
Neither mythology, history, poetry nor
song demands that this feminine adorn
ment be of an auburn tinge to attain suc
cess in captivation, intellectuality or any
other virtue. All types of beauty, regard
less of the color of the tresses, have been
admired from the fairest to the darkest.
The reason for this present tendency of
changing one's tresses to fiery brilliancy,
like the craze for blenching, is unknown.
Though it neither hurts the brain nor
destroys the hair (for tbe henna leaf, like
peroxide, is not injurious), it is hardly a
commendable practice.
Nature's day must und will come, when
with only soap and water, comb and
brush, woman will learn that she can be
more beautiful than with all the hair dyes
in the world. Elizabeth Ank.
TAKING OUT THEIR GOODS
Merchants Hurriedly Emptying
the Local Bonded Ware
houses.
Expect That Congress Will Enact <â 
High Protective Tariff on
Tuesday.
San Francisco merchants are harrying
to get their goods oat of the bonded warp
nouses in anticipation that Congress,
v hen it meets in special session on Tues
day next, at the call of President McKin
iey, will fulfill the purpose for which i< is
convened â enact a sound and far-reaching
protective tar.ff.
It is thought that the big rush will come
to-morrow and that vast quantities of
goods will be taken out, Dut already the
removals foot up a considerable sum.
The drain began on the Ist inst., when
$2646 46 worth of eooda was removed.
On the day following tne amount jumped
to $17,590 21, snd the top noich was
reached on Friday, when $19,622 71 was
removed. Yesterday the amount was
comparatively small, because Saturday is
an off day, but preparations are being
made to handle a big lot to-morrow.
For the twelve days past goods to the
amount cf $87,673 37 have been removed,
$6124 25 being from "rewarehouse" lots.
The main removals have been cigars,
tobacco and woolen good;. The law
allows goods to remain n-ree years in
bond, but the duty in force at the time o:
the removal must be paid.
It is thought that to-morrow's removal
will amount to hundreds of thousands.
The owners of the goods will save many
thousands of dollars by taking them ou.
before a high protective tariff is put in
force.
and deuce, played deuce; of course North
knew that king or queen was the only card
above the eight with either adversary, and he
took the chance that tho card was to his right;
it happened to be there and was the king, and
the play proved very lucky. However, we re
gard North's play justifiable only in CRse he
held trump strength and good cards to be led
to in the other suits, and with great trump
strength we believe sound whist would de
mand winning the trick and exhausting
trumps.
What we have said here is intended to apply
only to third-hand play on the original lead.
The "Oregonian" of Portland Falls
Into Line.
The Oregonian of Sunday, February 7, makes
the following announcement : "The Oregonian
this week opens its columns as an educator for
tbe benefit of the whist-reading public, aud
will strive from week to week to place before
tbosÂ« interested in the game just such matter
as will be of interest, by reason of its possess
ing some local association, or because of its
bearing, more or less prominently, upon some
Important feature or topic of the day."
We wi>h we could reach out oar hand over
the Shasta route, down the Willamette Valley
into Portland, and shake the hand of the Ore
gonian, and congratulate them on having such
an able whist writer as Miss Annie Blanche
Shelby. This little lady we have known for
several years in the whist world, and we are
glad to see that her whist ability is appre
ciated. We will look forward to receiving the
Sunday Oregonian with mucti interest, and we
would advise all students of the game to sub

MARS WAS ON THE
PARADE GROUND
General Inspection of the
Troops at the Pre
sidio.
The rpsctacle Was Especially
Brilliant and Impres
sive.
Sabers Raltl d, Bayonets Glistened
and Caucoi-Wheels Rambled,
Passing in Review.
The inspection of the troops at the
Presidio, which had been looked for dur
ing the past six weeks, was held yesterday
morning, the inspecting officer being
Colonel George H. Burton, inspector
general.
The day was all that could be desired,
and the attendance large. There were
about eight hundred men in full-dress
uniform in parade. The three branches of
the servicpâ infantry, artillery and
cavalryâ passed in review.
The first branch to appear on the parade
ground was the infantry's six companies,
under command of Capain O'Conne'l.
The men in tneir brilliant uniforms
entered upon the ground, company front,
and presented a very soldierly appearance,
being the subject of much commendation
by the onlookers.
Then came the artillery, with thb red
facings on the uniforms and red waving
plumes; then the cavalry, with yellow
facings and yellow plume. After the in
fantry had been inspected and the men
returned to quarters the artillery ana
cavalry passed in' review, and at times
moved across the parade ground at break
neck speed. The wild rush of the light
batteries and of the cavalry, the clash of
scabbards and the tramp of the horses'
hoofs were realistic of soldier life.
After the evolutions, which were exe
cuted with remarkable precision, the in
spection, which was long and close, the
troops were ordered to quarters'.
During the run across the parade
ground the spare wheel on the caisson of
the front platoon of artillery fell to the
ground and the other platoons passed
over it; but strange to say. none of the
horses were tripped by it.
When the four companies of cavalry
came to company form just prior to in
sp9ctlon, a jackrabbit suddenly appeared
on the parade ground and started on a
run for cover. He was intercepted at all

points by civilians, who "shone 1" him as
they would a ben. Bunny moved in all
directions without hope of escape, but
finally saw an opening and made for it,
followed by a dog, who made a good run.
The hare escaped.
In the afternoon there was a drill in
spection, and the inspection, which is to
be very thorough, will continue several
days. Colonel Shafter, post commander,
was present only as a spectator, as he 19
now on a short leave of absence. Lieu
tenant-Colonel Young was in command of
the troops. ________________

among residents of San Francisco, while
the empress of California is to be voted
for by the people of the State at large.
Ballots will coat 10 cents each and there
is no limit to the number that may be cast
for any one candidate. Already a num

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
SUNDAY MARCH 14, 1897
Congress resumes business to-morrow.
The new tariff is a genuine springtime
daisy.
There will be no bungling at Washing
ton this time.
We may all rejoice in the fact that at
last we have an amiable President.
There is prosperity in the air. The rain
brought it and the sunshine confirms it.
Having convicted the liar and exposed
the hypocrite, vre can now go forward to
new things.
England, France and Russia have made
up their minds to agree, but they are un
able to find anything to agree about.
The powers seem to have no more effect
in coercing Greece than they had in
coercing Turkey. It is a complete stand
off.
Berkeley wishes to introduce the dor
mitory system, not so much for sleeping
purposes as to wake up the university
spirit.
The cause of Cuba will claim attention
in San Francisco this week and on Satur
day night the people will declare their
sentiments.
Protection to American industry should
mean protection from the competition of
convicts as well as from that of cheap
foreign labor.
McKinley need hardly say more in his
messnge to Congress than tie said in his
inaugural, except to add something about
Cuba and Nicaragua.
The mugwumps sail of Cleveland, t: We
love him for the enemies he has made."
Republicans say of McKinley, "We love
him for his friends, for they are tbe
people."
The snow hasn't cleared away from the
Eastern Stales yet, but already some of
tbe enterprisi.ii: papers have bosun to
run snake stories. This is a great year for
business of all kinds.
According to reports from New York
Tammany Hall is bad, but the bipartisan
polic- board is worse. Tammany occa
sionally has a meeting without a row, but
tbe board never does.
The latest novelty in Npw York society
is for the guests at the Bradley Mrtin
ball to appear in their ball costtmes at
tableaux for charity. Every show of the
kind draws and chanty is feeling rich.
The new Congress means the enactment
of a protective tariff, and that of course
implies a revival of indnstry. Now, there
fore, is the time for Californians to work
together for the upbuilding of the State.
As a boy orator Kaiser William is even
more objectionable than Bryan. He
doesn't ta kso long at any one time, but
then th? Germans have no way of voting
him down and dare not tell him to
shut up.
To the Turkish empire a national debt
is decidedly a national blessing, for it is
only by the bonds the empire has on the
European stock exchanges that it manages
to keep itself from being wiped off tbe
map of Europe.
The assertion of the convicted faker that
pood twine is not made by free labor in
this market ought not to go unrebuked by
the Manufacturers' Association. That
libel on home industries should be
promptly refuted.
The latest story of Rnssell Sage is that
he took a mortgage on the home of an old
friend to secure a loan of $50. It will t ns
be seen that while the v;ealth of Mr. Sage
does occasionally enter into the home of
his friend?, it never goes without a desire
to take possession.
The Boston Herald refers to one of the
last acts of the Cleveland regime as "a
final proof that we have had a man of the
itoman type in the Presidency," ana it
wiil be admitted he was something of a
Roman. He made a desert even if he
didn't call it peace.
The Chicago Inter Ocean asserts that
Mrs. McKinley's gowns are the hand
somest ever worn by the wife of a Presi
dent of the United States. A slight shads
of suspicion is cast on the report, how
ever, by the further statement that they
were made in Chicago.
The Rev. Charles F Hoffman, who re
cently died in New York leaving a fortune
estimated at above $10,000,000, may not
havetnugnt the golden rule any better
than some other clereymen, but he evi
dently knew how to work it both ways in
praciice better than most.
A Connecticut legislator is accused of
saying in a speech against a bill to protect
eagles that the bird "hns its teeth into
everything it can lay its hands on." And
now there is doubt whether he shall be
indicted for slandering the National bird
or for mixing his metaphors.
The employes of tue California Cotton
mills have done well in calling the atten
tion of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association to the false assertion of the
Examiner that the twine made by free
labor in California is not as good as that
which it gets from the prison mil at San
Quentin. A slander of that kind is a di
rect injury to home industries and ought
10 be refuted at once.
PROTECTION TO CITIZENS.
"Ex-attache, >? a correspondent of the New York Tribune, has contributed to that
journal an elaborate review of tie difference between British and American methods
in dealing with foreign nations for the protection of citizens residing abroad. The
article is pertinent to affairs in Cuba and deserves more than ordinary consideration.
The keynote of British policy it well stated in an extract from a public saying of
Lord Palmerston on a question of the right or wrong of the claim of a certain English
man against a foreign country. "There will b â¢ time enough to straighten out that
part of the question afterward," he argueJ. "But we have got to start on the hypoth
esis that an Englishman h necessarily in the right, and that his cause is deserving of
our chain n onsriip."
It will be seen that the British policy carries into foreign affairs the maxim of the
common law that a man is assumed to be innocent until he has been proven to be
guilty. A British subject claiming the protection of his Government in a land where
justice is denied him is accorded uy Great Britain the same rights to which ne would
be entitled in a British court. The Government acts upon the presumption that he is
right. It stands forth as his champion. It demands for him a fair trial, and not
until full protection to his life, liberty and property has been secured for him does it
enter upon t c question whether he was right or wrong.
Our Government has too often acted differently. Take the Cleveland administra
tion in its dealings with Americans imprisoned in Cuba for example. Men claiming
to be American citizens have been left in prison until the State Department could
investigate the case and find out if their claims were rigbt or wrong. As a conse
quence many innocent citizens of this country, resident in Cuba, have suffered long
imprisonment and great wrong while these investigations were going on. In one
case, that of Dr. Euiz, the investigation was continued until the man was dead. It
is even believed that be was murdered. Such proceedings make a farce of national
protection, and it is not to be wondered that the prestige of Great Britain among
powers is much greater than our own.
There can be no question as to the essential justice of the I'almerston maxim.
American law at home Is the same as that of Great Britain. A man arrested here is
assumed to be innocent. He must be proven gu lty before he can be punished. That
law should be enforced in the interests of Americans everywhere. All civilized
nations guarantee it. It is only with some half-civilized people, or with some mili
tary despotism, we are likely to come into conflict on the issue. Nor would we have
to engage in many conflicts. .Let us once make it known that the Government of the
United States will not tolerate injustice to its citizens abroad any more than at home
and in a comparatively short lime even the Union Jack of Great Britain will not be
as potent a protection to its citizens as the Stars and Stripes.
The issue is one which directly affects the true greatness of the Republic. It will
encase the attention of the orators at the Cuban mass-meeting on Saturday and
should find sufficient support from all patriotic citizens to insure a large, earnest and
resolute audience. Let us declare our sympathy with Cuba and onr determination that
the Government at Washington shall protect American citizens wherever the flag
can fly.
OAST THEM OUT.
The current number of the Arena con
tains an article upon the subject of
"Women in gutter Journalis-m," which
is one of the most forcible of the many
earnest protests now being made against
that form of depravity. The article, more
over, is something more tnan a protest.
It is a realistic delineation of one of the
wor-t features of decadent journa isra and
should be read by all who desire a clear
insight into the modes and methods by
which its so-called sensations are worked
up.
The career of women in gutter journal
ism as depicted Dy the writer of the Arena
article could be easily illustrated by ex
amples in this City. The Examiner, whicli
has attained a shameful eminence among
the decadent newspapers of the day, has
furnished many such. The worst that the
Journal could do in New York has been
copied here. Mr. Hearst has been con
sistent. His two papers are as much alike
as two garbage barrels and their contents
differ only aa the muck of San Francisco
differs from that of New York.
In the prevalence of this form of de
pravity the one consolation for good citi
zens is to be found in the fact that society
has begun to protest, morality has begun
to defend itself and decency has entered
upon a crusade to destroy the foal thin*.
Already the Apprentices' Library in New
York, the Pubic Library of Newark, N. J.,
the Princeton Theological L brary, and
the Pnblic Library of Portland, Or.,
have excluded the vicious journals from
their reading-rooms, amid universal ap
proval from all right-thinking citizens
and with tbe warm commendations of
legit. mate newspapers.
Tbe Rev. Dr. William C. Roberts of
Princeton in speaking of the exclusion of
the decadent papers from the library of
that institution says: "Princeton is ex
tremely conservative, and would not have
taken this action without good and suf
ficient cause. I think the example will
be productive of much good, as other edu
cational institutions will now take the
matter up." These words are encourag
ing. The influence of Princeton will be
felt everywhere, and eventually all the
universities and public libraries in the
country will be roused to exclude from
their rooms the publications which tend
to corrupt the manners and deprave the
morals of their roaiers.
Commenting upon "Women in Gutter
Journalism" the St. Louis Globe-Democrat
says: "There is perhaps no more disgust
ing phase of journalism than the employ
ment of women to delve in the slums, to
dig inio the sewers, to invade moral pest
houses, to climb ramparts of infamy, to
explore conduits of crime, to attend prize
fight?, dog-tights, hangings â not to de
scribe these horrors In esse. but to describe
them as women observers."
Tne truth of that statement cannot be
questioned. Nevertheless the fouJ work
imposed on women is but one phase of a
many-siled depravity on the part of the
slum sheets. Men are required of these
gutter journals to do tuings as offensive
to self-respectinsr m ntiood as is the Blum
service to womanhood. From all these
things society, morality ant deenncy suf
fer. Such a paper a 8 ths Journal in New
York or the Examiner in this City is a
breeder of corruption, profligacy, im
morality and crime. It is the germ cen
ter of moral plague. It contaminates a
community, and the omy defense of
-ucifjty is to cast it out utterly from home
and tchool and shop and library.
OOERvJM GBEEOE.
The impending blockade of the Ptrseus,
with a threat of war, is something as if
the great civilized powers had ' threatened
to commit matricide. That the wonderful
revival of Athens should have . the least
blow given Ito it by the powerful repre
sentatives of that civilization and culture
of which it is the mother,' and that, too,
for the purpose of hindering it in the
championship of freedom, seems a sacri
lege.
The many plausible reasons given for the
bullying interference are born of the ina
bility to sea that lesser laws are sacred
only until a higher law comes in to make
them null and void. It is the lesser laws
the combined powers are respecting now
and ignoring the higher one. England,
who, with her forceful navy to back her,
should be the leader for the cause of hu
manity, is probably the greatest impedi
ment in the way of Greece.
The duty of the British empire to safe
guard the investments of her citizens in
Turkish securities, the dislike of giving
offense to, her Moslem subjects in India,
the denire to deal justly with the Sultanâ
these are all worthy motives until tuey
come in conflict with the greater claim of
a Christian people to be freed from a domi
nation of fanatic barbarians.
All the western world should hail with
delight the efforts of Greece to come back
to her glory again. She it evidently act
ing conscientiously and with a courage in
the face ol such difficulty and danger as

ment that the Cretans have themselves
been cruel in their dealings with the Turks
on the island is not to be considered in
the settlement of tbe question. Cruelty
begets a cruelty of retaliation, which but
doubles the debt the tyrant who initiated
it suould pay to Nemesis, and the cardinal
feature of the situation is that the Chris
tians of Crete are under an alien yoke
which galls. It is against enlightened
principle* of freedom that any people
capable of self-government should be kept
in fubjection by a foreign power. It is so
evident that the Cretan? should be united
to Greece that to oppoie their union with
the nation to which they naturally belong
and with whica they could dwell in peace
and happiness is a blind injustice, un
worthy of the ereat civilized powers.
ARE WE PKEPARiO FOR WAR?
We have now a respectable navy, rank
ing fi:th in the world, and, thanks to an
enlightened pnblic opinion backed by lib
eral appropriations, we have made a good
beginning on a comprehensive system of
coast defense by guns and boats. So far
so good, but there still remains many
important questions to be decided and many
other things to be done before we can say we
are fairly prepared for war. What provision
has been raaae for organizing and even prac
tically training a force adequate to enable us
to carry on a war of any considerable magni
tude? Common honesty compels us to admit
what is apparent to other nations that, how
ever great our ultimate resources in men and
material may be, we are not in a condition to
make them available for war purposes in any
reasonable time â In a word we arc iv the con
dition of Austria in 18t>6, of France in 1870
and of Chin am 1894. It is needless to more
than refer to tbe results of lack of prepara
tion in the cases cited.
In fact lack of preparation for war may be
said to be a chronic state with us. Of military
policy, properly speaking, we have none, un
less repugnance to standing armies and a
blind belief in the stn-ngih of the "millions of
strong arms" can be dignified by such an ap
pellation. We are, however, always ready to
go to war in defense of our honor or ri|:hta,
and when that time comes but little thought
will bo taken of whether we are prepared or
not. The outburst of military ardor which
overspread the country at the time of Presi
dent Cleveland"! message on the Venezuelan
question sufficiently proves this. Unwilling
to admit the possibility of war and neglecting
the plainest precautions for such Â» comin-
Kency, still when war is upou us we sacrifice
life anil money with reckless prodigality, and
mortgage the future to p-iy pensions.
One of our best-informed military authori
ties esiimates that the lack of warlike prepa
retions before our Civil War cost tne United
States $6,000,000 000. Blinded by our final
triumph and rejoic.ng in a teunited country,
we have been slow to appreciate aud apply the
lessons to be derived rom taose terrible four
years. True, the Civil War was an exceptional
case. Theu boiti sides wero equally unpre
pared. But how will it tare wiih us now if we
are suddenly confronted by a modern well
equipped and well organized army? If the
history of modern wariare leaches one tiling
more than another it is that mere numbers
and resources will avu.il little against a well,
prepared adversary. The shori duration of
wars nowadays demonstrates that science and
intelligent preparation play a much more im
portant part than personal bravery.
No; counting Indian wars or domestic dis
turbances thirty years have been the longest
period of peace we have c i joyed. During the
century ending with 1875 one-sixth of our
time nas been devoted to war. We must then
look forward to war as a possible. If not prob
able, contingency, and so considered a rea
sonable degree 01 preparation should be con
sidered as in the nature of an insurance. In
deed it is better than insurance, for it may
actually prevent the losses leared.
As we are a peace-loving nation we should
be so prepared that on occasion we can com
mand peace effi-ciually. if all signs are not
amiss we are now entering upon an important
period of our career, aid the future is big
with possibilities. A simple enumeration of
some lmuoria.'it questions still unsettled, such
as Hawaii, the Nicaragua canal and Cuban
Independence, shows that if we are to fill the
important p. ace iv the western hemisphere
and the wor.d to which we are clearly en
titled we must not shirk our responsibilities.
Otherwise we shall fail of our nigh destiny,
while our pretensions, combined with luck of
action, would make us the laughing-stock of
the world.
The Briad Arrow of London, at the time of
the Venezuela incident said pointedly of the
United States:
"To live as she now does, freefiom any great
cost for armaments, she must behave as she
lias hitherto done, and keep herself to herse.f.
She Is a numerous and fairly wealtny Nation,
but she is a great Nationâ ln the te so of
power ia the worldâ oniy by suff .-ranee."
So much for what other nations tnlnk of us
and whac we may expect when commercial or
other interests clash.
â The nation which can the longer endure a
state of war baa a great advantage," and
herein lies our military strength. No country
is as self-contained as ours, und we could live
in fair comfort for years even if every port
were blockaded. We need not fear subjuga
tion, but we must not be content merely to
stand on the defe nlvc. To gain any decided
advantage over tne enemy we must also be pre
pHred to take the offensive and make the
enemy feel the war.
What, then, in view of the forces likely to
be sent against us, would constitute a reason
able prejaratlon for war? It is evident that
we are subject to a naval or combined naval
and land attack. To meet the naval attack
the navy and artillery must co-operate. The
navy must seek out and defeat the enemy ou
the high teas If possible. If not, the fortiflca
tions should furnish a safe refuge. To repii
an invasion we have an army of 25,000, sup
plemented by the National Guard of ll&.OOO.
It U doubtful If from these two forces more
than 75,000 men would ba available and we
should have to call upon volunteers. The
confusion resulting from mixing different
kinds of troops may well be imagined. Our
militia laws are in a chaotic state, and
while the question seems settled that the
President may call the National Guard into
the service of the U nited States it is still open
to doubt whether he could order them on duty
outside of the country. II theso questions
come up on the eve of battle defeat would be
certain.
When we come to the service of forts and
guvs the need of advance training of those
who are to supplement the regular forces is
even more evident. The militia, to effectually
co-operate with and re-eniorce the army, must
have its definite station* assigned before
hand. Local artillery batteries should be
formed ana have their drills at the very guns
they are to serve in war.
Tne size of the army to be sent against us
will depend on the question of ocean transport
and effective convoy. For any decisive effect
other than naval a compact, weil-organized
army of at least 100,000 men would be re
quired, and command of the &ea would be the
first requisite to success. England holds at
home some 75,000 troops in readiness for for
eign service. With her powerful navy and
with fortified bases and coaling stations
stretched along our coast from Qu.'bec to the
West Indies she would prove a formidable loe.
With her big fleet of torpedo boats shj could
reconnoitre the coast, make a feint at oue
point and then suddenly disembark her lorces
at some distant* point before we could hope to
orgauize an effective resistance. Her next
step would be to try to secure control of
some good harbor to be used as a base of fur
ther operations. The transportation of 100,000
men and their successiul descent on a coast is
an operation of great difficulty and authorities
differ as to its feasibility. Sieam transport
has, however, greatly* simplified the problem.
In a discussion some years ago Lord Wolseley
gave a calculation he had made to the effect
that the transport of such a body of men would
require something like 300 large steamers,
and it is easily seen that even England would
find it hard to get that number at short notice.
We have discussed ouly the matter ol de
fense. When we cwme to the question of our
attempting an invasion of a foreign country
the difficulties on our side are at once enor
mously increased.
The whole question of an adequate reserve
force for suduen military needs should be care
fully worked out by a body of officers, much
as the German general staff works out similar
questions for the Fatherland. No considera
tions whatever should stand in the way of
having on hand at all times an adequate body
of men who would know their exact status
and position in the case of war. Until these
questions are finally determined we cannot be
said to be adequately prepared.

The burlesque 'Don Juan," which was pro

best thing he ever has written. It is the
favorite child of his brain, notwithstanding
his songs and extravaganzas thm under one
name or anuther have been steadily catching

new negro song as one of the novel features of
"Don Juan."

considerable of it lately. There is the short
burlesque I constructed and staged for the
Concordia Club which was produced February
27. The members of the club were greatly
pleased with ii and highly complimented Mr.
Loraine and myself upon our work. It is
worthy of a professional production, but is
hardly long enough for an evening's enter
tainment.
"Perhaps you have heard that the Tivoli in
tends to reproduce my "Don Juan" in the
near future. 1 cousid^r this burlesque the
best thing I have ever done, and the subject is
certainly the best fitted for burletque pur
poses. I will further add some new material
lor this production in the way of songs and
topical hits, and with the ballet the manage
ment intend to pot in the third act will make
a rattling show. It was first put on about two
years and a half ago. and scored a five weeks'
run to enormous business.
"I am engaged now In fixing up the new
numbers, and will add a few jokes which I
think are new. I have been doing some work
In thatiine for Fanny Rice also, and Loraine
and I have recently written a brand new negro
song, and what is more to the point, have
found a purchaser. Yes, burlesque writing
peys fairly well, and I am greatly pleased to
have s house like the Tivoli repeat one of
mine. It shows me there must be a drawing
quality in it, and "Don Juan" ought to dupli
cate its previous business, as it will be hand
somely mounted with new scenery and dress
ing. I think Easter week will witness its sec
ond presentation, and we all hope it will
auspiciously ot>en the post-Lenten season."

Not in the shade of darkening darts to fight,
As theu wen eager ere ihermop.v :n:
But 'nealh the frown of all the powers that be,
Thou girdent on thine armor for the right.
We wait to see thy battle beacons light
The blazing pyre of Turk ish tyranny;
Bui tbou, O mighty mistress of the sea!
Why uost thou with oppression's hosts unite?
Were it some fever jnncle In debateâ

For new dominion, wiili its gorging gr>-ed,
Would urge tbee even throngh perdl ion's gate;
But now ihou waichest fainting freedom bleed,

A CHILD OF THK JaGO-Bf Arthur Morri-
Ron. Chicago: Herbert 8. atone <fe Co. For sale
r | tm sP ty by W ' uliaoa Palace Hotel.
I|N "A Child of the Jago," the author of
â j "Tales of Mean Streets" has written a
_5 striking study of life as it is lived in the
poverty-stricken portion of the East End of
London. The Jago, it should be premised, is
that distr.ct bounded on the south by Bethnal
Green road and on the west by the High
street, Shoreditch. These geographical date,
ind.cating the scene of the story, are suffi
cient to guarantee something realistic, and
here we have it.
Sordid poverty, filth, crimeâ these form the
corapouent parts of much of Mr. Morrison's
study, as was to have been expected. Where
the character portrayed by him is not over
poweringly ugly it is unstable as water. Our
author is most happy in his Josh Perroit, in
Dickey, his son, in Aaron Weech, in the Ranns
and the Learys. When he comes to describe
the parson, the small tradesman, the swell
thtef, ho approaches perilously near a failure.
Clearly Mr. Morrison's forte is not in describ
ing the ways of the "hupper suckles."
The student of social conditions in large
cities will find much of value in "A Child 01
the Jago," for what is true of London can be
made to apply with equal force to Paris, New
York, Sydney or Sau Francisco. In each of
these cities, cited at random, can tÂ» found a
Jago, overcrowded, disease-infested, germ
breeding, where vice and poverty are daily
engaged in a bitter struggle for supremacy,
wtiere nightly the cry arises
O God ! that bread should be so 6>ar
And flesh and bko I so cheap.
In London at least the area of these Jago dis
tricts is gradually becoming more and more
circumscribed. The Saffron Hill of to-day is
not what it was when :t numbered among its
chieftst residents the Artful Dodger, Charles
Bates, Bill Sykes and Fagin. So with the
Shoreditch Jago, whose complete annihilation
will only be a matter of a few years, thanks to
the capitalists who see a sure source of inter
est in the four per cent dwellings, and none to
the theorizers and dreamers of better social
conditions. This brings us to what is the
dominant note of the book under review.
Mr. Morrison spares no pains to make it ap
parent that he has a vast contempt for those
persons, lav and cierical, -who seem to think
that a considerable portion 01 their mission in
liie is to visit the poorer quarters of their
cities in order to "ameliorate the condition" of
the denizens thereof. It is a singular tact that
the efforts of these Eminently Respectables
usually crystallize in a lecture upon some
Ebstruse ethical or philosophical subject. A
ball is hired, and hnndbihs are issued to the
effect that "Mr. So-and-So will deliver a lecture
on The Renaissance. Tea and cake free."
A number of the Eminently Respectables are
on the platform to lend tone to the proceed
ings. The submerged tenth are also there in
force, but not for the purpose of hearing a
eulogy of Savonarola. They come attracted
by the mercenary clause, "tea and cake free,"
and at the cloÂ«e of lhe lectuie the Eminently
Respectables depart, fully convinced that they
have participated in another exhibition of
j>rectical philanthropy, and inwardly thank
ing God that they are not like unto these
men.
The author of "A Child of the Jago" has no
compunction in holding these Semi-Divinities
up to ridicule, and with justice. What the in
habitant oi the Jago wantÃ is bread, not phil
osophy, and it were mockery to offer the as
piring East Ender the Higher Life, the Greater
Thought, the Wider Humanity, and other
radiant abstractions in the comparative de
gree, when soup, meat or coal tickets would
Footne his soul lv a more satisfactory manner.
It is needless for our author to point out that
any improvement in the lot of the Jagoite
which may have been effected in recent years
is not by any means due to the efforts ot mis
guided dabblers in philanthropy. None who
have studied the prob.em can doubt that the
solution is yet Jar off, that most of the schemes
put forward to "Civilize" the poorer classes are
dismal failures.
And the reason for this is not hard to find.
Those of the so-called lower classes who are
gifted with the most ordinary common-sense,
and whom it is desired to reach, object, and |
properly so, to the airs of superiority affected
by the aforesaid "Eminently Respectables," j
who' condescend to p ace themselves in the |
position of mentors. Here is an extract from j
one of the earlier chapters 01 "A Child of the j
Jago" which nicely illustrates these facts.
The scene is th 3 opening of a new oiub, which |
Mr. Morrison felicitously calls the "Ea*t End
Elevation Mission and Pansophical Institute."
The chairman of the committee is speaking:
He (the chairman) rejoiced to see that day I
whereon ;he helping hand of the West was so un
mistakably made appar-nt In the Kast. He re
j deed also to find himself In the midst of so ad
mirably typical an assemblageâ so representative,
if he might say so, of that great i.ast :.nd of Lon
don, thirsting ar,d crjrlDg out forâ lor elevation;
for thatâ ah â elevatiOD w lch the more fortunately
circumstanced den zens ofâ of o.bcr places had so
munificentlyâ laid on. Xhe people of the Kast
End had been sadly roisrepre-enti-dâ in popular
period caU and inâ ln other ways. The East Eva,
be was convinced, was not su black as it was
pointed. [Appauie.] He bad but to look ar.oui
himâ et cetera, et cetera. He questioned whether
bo well conducted, morally given and respectable a
ga hvring could be brought together in a..y West
End parish wi h wbich be was acquainted. It was
his.moai pleasant duty on this occasionâ and so on
and so forth.
This may appear the exaggeration of a novel
ist, but a reference to the flies of any news
paper will show that such delightful conceits
are perpetrated every day in the year. In the
case ci t-d one is almost gratified to note that
the speaker was rewarded for his patronizaiion
jy Dickey Perrott, who "clicked" his massive
hunter.
No: the West does not and never did under
stand the East, and, given present conditions,
never will. As Mr. Morrison says, the in- j
stitutions for the manufacture of the Superior !
Person from the Jngo raw material are sup
ported in London "by people who know less of
that part than of Asia Minor." This is liter
ally true, and the college-bred philanthropist
Is laughed at for his pains. Who then is the
benefactor of the poor in big cities? L.-t lhe
author of "A Child of the Jago" answer. It is
the man wi o builds tenement-houses (even as
a menus of investment) rather than he who
erects "institute*." ; soup kitchens rather than
mission hells, bnd *ho gives bread and meat
and coal before lectures on evolution.
In a boox like the one before us no writer I
could avoid touching upon the sorely vexed |
matter of "sweating." Here is a paragraph
that should afford food for thought to tiie
Eminently Re pectables:

Twopence-farthing, four and one-half cents,
for making one gross of match-boxes! And
the Semi-Divinities marveled at the presence
of so much crime la th â  Ja;:o. In the face of
these figures one can see reason in the remark
addres-ed to Dicky Perrott (the "Child of
the Jago") by Beverid<re, an inhabitant
thereof. The old man indicates a trio of swell
burglars well dressed and bedizened with
diamonds, who are entering a saloon together:

"A Chiid of the Ja^o" is a realistic work of
fiction There are in it some passages of
wondrous power that it is no stretch of the
imagination to describe as worthy of Dickens.
. The picture of the murder of Aaron Weecn,
the h\ pocritical receiver of stolen goods, and
those portraying the scene in court at the trial
. of Josh Perrott and his subsequent execution,
the death of Dickyâ all are painted with a mas
ter hand. Mr. Morrison knows whereof he
writes, and writes it. His novel, without
. obtruding a moral, could well serve
as a text-book to the student of
sociology and crlmonoiogy. His sympathies
i are manifestly with the class ol which
he writes, and he plainly suggests through the
medium of a first-class work of fiction the
methods which must be applied to remedy the
i allied diseases of Doverty and crime. He
burrows beneath the urt.ficiality of the osteu
i tatious charity dispenser, and with dart- ike
pen shames or ridicules him eff his pedestal.
i "A Child of the Jago" will do for Shoreditch
what Mr. Zangwiil did lor Petticoat Lane. It
will perpetuate its memory while assisting
i practical men, not idealists, in their effort to
bring the suffering East Euder to a cleaner life.

Traill. John Lane, 1-ioJit-y Head: London aud
>ew York. lor sale by William Doxey, Palace
Hotel City. PrUe 50 centi.
The author of this tale asserts at the very
start that it is a tiptop novel, and this is the
truth. If strictly speaking it Is not a novel it
is certainly a novel skit. It is a satire on
the style of some modern novels, and seems to
be aimed particularly at Grant Allen's. It
treats chiefly of the topic of taboos, atid inas
much as marriage is the king of taboos in the
I estimation of certain rebels, who consider life
as miserably weighed down upon by the tyr
anny of the taboo .reign, the subject of free
love must be mainly dealt with; and it is done
with a delicacy of refined but scath ng sar
casm which will compel both the devout and
the wicked to laugh. The style of the story is
perhaps the spiciest purity it is possible to
write.
There are many modern stories written as it
were holily, but the whole effect of them is
debauching, whereas this tiptop novel is
written with a debonair deviltry that is posi
tively scintillating, and yet the whole effect is
morally elevating, because it tears the domino
from the master â sin, playing the role of su
perior intellect.
When wit is used in so good a cause It Is
doubly enjoyable Â«nd commendable. Perhaps
many a weak woman wno has been argued
into departure from high ideals by the clever
and plausible ta k of some apostle of liberty,
of enlightened and advanced thought, might
have saved he rself for higher things if she had
ever had t.e rich absurdity of this apparently
p;ous persuasion x-rayod to her vision in
Traill's witty way. There is somewhere a
golden mean between prudery and indelicacy,
| and perhaps this amusing novel goes as fur
j toward being ritque without beini corrupt
' ing as is ever safe.

The author of this book is the president of
the American Chirological society, and the
work is intended to so simplify the art of
reading character and fate by the shape of the
I hands and the lines in the palms that it may
I be acquired to a considerable degree of perfec
tion by any one who will tnka the trouble to
read the work carefully. The writer refers to
Balzac and Buiwer Lvtton for confirmation of
bis claim that palmistry is an honest science,
notwithstanding its having been brought into
much disrepute by charlatans.
It is probable that a work by the president
of the Chirological Society, a man who has
given twenty-five years' study to the art of
reading the liies written by nature on the
hand, will be eagerly read by those who are
interested in that science.

CPB> HE above portraits and silhouette of Lord Byron are reproduced from drawings
Vi'^v 1 which appeared in "The Sketch" of recent issue, which contains a number of new and
jlftf interesting likenesses of the poet. The silhouette was cut by Mrs. Leigh Hunt
at I'isa in 1822. Brron was wont then to sit in such a manner in his riding dress in the
garden of the Lanfrancht Palace. In this silhouette he is presentad in striking contrast to
the likenes'. of him in the principal portrait printed above, which was reproduced from a
full-length oil painting- by Sanders, painted In 1807, when Byron was in the full flush of his
wonderful manly beauty. From the silhouette it is evident that Byron, toward the close of
his life, cared little or nothing for his personal appearance, of which he thought a great deal
iv his younger and more romantic days.
The portrait painted by Sanders is doubtlessly the best likeness of Byron ever depicted
upon canvas. It is now the property of Lady D jrchester of England.
The picture showing Byron in Albanian dress was reproduced from a half-length por
trait produced by Phillips and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1814 under the title
"A Nobleman in the Dress of an Albanian," when it attracted a great deal of attention.
called -'Patience Sparhawk and Her Times,"
and it more than makes up for her long
si.ence. It is said to be far and away the
most remarkable piece of work Mrs. Atherton
has d'>ne.
Patience Eparhawk is a California girl,
who marries and comes to New York,
where she lives a life of reckless gaye;y,
in the narrative of which various aspects
of New York society are depicted with
graphic realism and unquestionable clever
ness. The heroine experiments a bit in
husbands and passes through the most
varied and startling experiences, including a
trial for murder of her first husband and
a narrow escape from the electrocuting
chair. Husband number two arrives
just in time to save her, wnicb, of
course, relieves the reader, though if
a good judge of character, he may conclude
that Patience might better have remained in
the chair and taken her fate at once.
Mrs. Atherton knows how to toil a story and
â he has got into this new novel a great deal of
story very effectively told. It will find plenty
of readers. Mrs. Atherton is living now in
England and declares It to be her Intention
not to return to America. But "Patience
SDarhawk" will soon be here and It will fill
the gap.

The latest number of the Yellow Book is as
usual filled with attractive short stories and
sketches with embellishments lathe way of
pictures, odd, original and artistic. The
frontispiece is a pencil portrait of Miss Evelyn
eharp, and one of tlra best things in the book
is a fairy story by her which is a strong con
trast to the usual style of fairy stories. Henry
James contributes an article on the well-worn
subject of the love affair between the novel
ist Georges Sand and Alfred de Mussel.
At the cose of his remarks he wonders "how
the graceless facts do, after all, confound
thomselves with the beautiiul spirit." The

BUSS ARMSTRONG'S AJSD OTHER CIRCT7M
STANI'KS. By John Davl ison. New York:
Stone A X mball. For sale by William Doxey,
Paiace Hotel. City. Price SI 25.
Miss Armstrong, who is an enthusiastic
young girl, makes up her mind that she will
make circumstance rather than be controlled
by it. She divide* people into two great
classesâ those who are "circumstances" with
out knowing it and those who are conscious of
the fact. When she first starts out to cause
things to happen she meets with ignominious
defeat, but in the end she did become the
cause of a very live circumstance, though the
performance was of a character altogether dif
ferent to what she had planned. The expla
nation of how it all happened can only be en
joyed by reading the author's skilled narra
tion. Among other good things in the book
is an account of a visit to an anarchists' meet
ing and a conversation with some of their
leaders. Their talk is full of destructive
threats, but the conclusion of the writer is
that such meetings are at harmless as church
soirees. Anarchy, he says, is the exaggeration
of the idea of liberty, just as socialism is an
exaggeration of the idea of equality.

herself to a French Count; vows vengeance,
gives up his commission and goes to Paris to

The band referred to iv this title is that
which furnishes music to the soldier boys, and
the verses in dialect depict the rough romance
of the private so;dier's life. They are humor
ous and of the Kipling order. Some of these
poems originally appeared in Truth, Vogue '
and Life. There are few not done in dialect. (
Of these, "Springtide, â¢' which is a question to
a maiden and her answer, is perhaps the best
thing in the whole volume. There are half a
dozen prose sketches written after the manner
of the old Hebrew prophets.

GOD'S LAWS OF HEALINGâ By John Eiler.
Oakland, Cal.
This book is evidently written by an in
tensely religious man, who has strong faith in
the Bible but not much in doctors of medicine
or doctors of divinity who indorse them. He
denounces the uso of alcohol and morphine
in doctors' prescriptions "in place o: the only
remedies laid down in God's word. When per
sonal faith fails to cure," he says, "then let
them call for the elders of the church and
anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord,
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick."

Heilas, Hail!
Little land so great of heart,
'Midst a world so abject grown â
Must thou play thy elorious part,
Hellas, glorious y alone?
Shame on Europe's arms, if she
Leave her noblest work to theel
While she slept her sleep of death,
Thou hast dared and thou hasi done;
Faced the Shape whese dragon breath
Fouls the splendor of the sun.
Thine lo show the world a way,
Thine the only deed to-day.
Thou, in this thy starry hour,
Sittest throned all thrones above.
Thou art more than pomp and power,
Thou art liberty and love.
Doubts Hnd f.'ars in dust be trod:
On, thou mandatory ot God !
Who are these would bind thy hands ?
Knaves and dastards, none beside.
All the just in all the lands
flail tbee b est and sanctified â
Curst, who would thy triumph mar,
Be he Kaiser, be he Czar.
Breathing hatred, plotting strife,
Rending beauty, blasting joy,
Loathsome round the tree of life
Coils the worm we would destroy.
Whoso smites yon Tiling Abhorred,
Holy, holy is nis sword.
Foul with slough of all things ill,
Turkey lies full sick, men say.
Not so sick but she hath still
Strength to torture, spoil and slay 1
O that ere this hour be past,
She were prone in death at last!
Kings, like lackeys, at her call
Raise her, lest in mire she reel.
Only through her final fall
Comes the hope of human weal. .
Slowly, by such deeds as thine,
Breaks afar the light divine.
Not since first thy wine-dark wave
Laughed in multitudinous mirth,
Hath a deed more pure and brave
Flushed the wintry cheek of earth.
There Is heard no melody
Like thy footsteps on the sea.
Fiercely sweet as stormy springs,
Mighty hopes are blowing wide;
Passionate prefigurings
Of a world revivified;
Dawning thoughts, that ere they let
Shall DOisess the ages yet
Oh, that she were with thee ranged,
Who for all her faults can still
In her heart of hearts unchanged,
Feel the old heroic thrill;
She, my land, my loved, mine own-
Yet thou art not left alone.
All the powers that soon or late
Gain for man some sacred goal,
Are copartners in thy fate.
Are companions of thy soul.
Unto tbee all earth surI 1 bow:
These are heaven and these are thou.

Ouida's new novel, which will be published
by a London firm, will represent a reversion to
her earlier style, betraying less of the in
fluence of Tolstoi than her last few books have
done. The principal character emigrates to
America, and there acts on the advice that
has passed into a proverb, -"Get money, hon
estly if you can, bnt get money." He eventu
ally becomes a millionaire, and he and his
wife attempt to buy their way into JJujrli-ih
society, thereby providing Ouida with occa
sion to unburden herself of a considerable
amount of scathing carcasm. The book Is

thing in that way it would be based on what I
saw of London's great waterway, the Thames,
which has been the source of all the wealth'
power and grandeur of the capital of Eng
land. Whoever has not seen the Thames can
not explain the greatness of London, whose
heart and pulse it is. I should certainly be
attracted by the Thames in anything I might
be induced to write. I do not know the
people, however; they ere perfect strangers
to me. I was comparatively at home in
Rome, you know. It was to me as the south of
France, where I was brought up. I could en
ter into the spirit of a kindred Latin race, to
which I partly belong; but England is differ
ent. That bit of seething water, the Channel
between us and Albion, is an abyssâ a gulf
which separates the two countries morally as
well as materially. No! I really think that I
can do nothing deep with England, any more
than I can with America, whose peopie are
asking me to visit them. It would take years
to study these countries, and I am no longer
young."

spring. They are of two kinds, either
rich silks, miroir velvet, satin glace,
moire, damas, all made with plain skirts,
or else embroidery on the materials; the
second series are of light material very
much trimmed with small flounces, gauze,
chiffon, embroidered tulle, fancy china
crepes, and white lace. The under skirts
are all trimmed underneath with ruches,
plisses, flounces, and what not, forming a
.support to the edge of the dress. The
skirts aie close fitting at the top, and

longer for the silks and richer stuffs. All

| the bodice, very full and puffy at the top,
I like a mass of gauze, tulle, lace, or flow
j ers, from which the shoulders and bust
appear.
"The waists are either pointed or round,
and the low necks either round, square or
i pointed, and all laced at the back; the
J sleeves are short and much raised, often a
different trimming on each. Felix orna
ments many of these bodices with che
ru'oues of lace, guipure, embroidered with
i spangle?, gold, silver, colored beads, pearls,
diamonds, etc These cherusques stand
up and out rather high round the back
and shoulders of the bodice. They seem
to start from a mass of lace, eh ffon or
gauze. As example: A pink satin bodice,
made with a tight back, was draped in
front into a corselet; a large cherusque in
j cream guipure, studded with diamonds,
starts in a point from the back, is high on
the shoulders and diminishes toward the
corselet, all round the shoulders a quantity
of silk, gauze and lace, with eight tufts of
pale violets falling in the gauze; very short
sleeves of gauzo and lace. The skirt was
piain and half long."
Pink moire enters into the composition
of a bodice, also the work of Felix. It tits
closely, and the front is pointed. A' the
back of thd waist is a chou. The silk is
draped over the bust a la Madame Sevigne,
being drawn in with a diamond clasp in
the middle. Below these soft folds is in

dery wrought in silver, steel spangles
and diamonds in black gauze. Of the
same embroidery is a demi-cherusaue
which starts from the back in a point and
extends high over the shoulder, and ends
at the corner of the arms. The short
sleeves are made of a coquille of moire
and aVfrilling of pleated white net. The
skirt hangs faultlessly, and is absolutely
without ornamentation. Bat little imagi
nation is requisite to comprehend the
charms of such a creation.
Jin Ophelia Satin.
Another conception is carried out
triumphantly in a rich Ophelia satin.
The bodice, plain in the back, is laced; a
bow finishes it The front terminates in a
point, fits snugly and opens with two wide
revers that extend to the waistline, being
edged with a very fine narrow lace and
diamond nail beads. Directly in the
middle of the front is a bow. The sleeves
are novel, as they are not at all alike.
White bobbin-net coquille with a tuft of
turquoise blue feather tips and orchids
placed toward the front formed the right
sleeve; the left sleeve is of bobbin-net and
Ophelia ribbons. The skirt is plain, in
deed; so many of Felix's skirts are an
trimmed that it is to be hoped his ideas
may hare a restraining effect upon those
who are now sadly overloading with
flounces, ribbons, braid, etc., otherwise
lovely skirts.

The Comtesse de Castries was gowned
in rose Ophelia damas, over which were
scattered innumerable paste diamonds ef
wonderful brilliancy; the bodice, made in
the Renaissance style, had a long point;
the neck was boidered with beautiful
large pearls. A pearl fastening caught up
the short bouillonne sleeves. The skirt
was long and plain. Pearls adorned the
bairwith an aigrette of white ostrich tips;
the laree fan was of the same feathers.
The white silk stockings had an entre
deux of white lace, and the shoes were of
the same fabric as the dress; long ivory
white kid gloves with a cuff of rare lace
were held in place with a row of choice
pearls.
A fascinating Marquise looked her pret
tiest in a semi-trained skirt of satin glace
nacre, pink and white, beautified with a
tablier of rarest old Alencon lace edged
with pink feathers powdered with dia
mond dust. The low-cut bodice had a
round waist and was draped crosswise
with soft folds. It was headed with a
quilling of the Alencon lace and violets.
The collarette spread out like a cherusque
of diamond-worked lace. The sleeves
were short ana of lace and violets, and the
high marabout aigrette was fastened with
a bow of diamonds. Her empire fan of
pink crepe sparkled with silver.
The Countess de firyas wore a silver
striped Nile-green brocade made with a
demi-train and a low bodice having a
double berthe of old lace, apparently held
in place by the corselet or brocade.
Alme. Losseline appeared in craquelle
velvet glace of a silver finish. The entire
skirt was spangled with silver and the

Absurd as it certainly is for elderly
women to try to dress quite as gayly as
their daughters, it is a great mistake for
them to wear nothing but grays or black,
as they used to do twenty or tnirty years
ago, for when becoming, a touch of color
is capable of wonderful results.
A youthful mndame at a similar func
tion created a mild sensation when at

thread of gold; the gauze bodice was most
artistically draped and covered, some
open work gold embroidery of extraor
dinary beauty.

more every week now for the next few

For some considerable time we have
realized the fact that no more charming
gowns for evening could be devised than
those of chiffon elaborately gathered,
tucked and embroidered, and now we
know that they, although extremely ex
pensive, are to form part of the wardrobe
of our smartest and awellest girls. Only
chiffon of the best quality can be seriously
considered, and no home dressmaker can
handle this fabric with any hope of suc

Composed entirely of frills of violets of
different shades, from the brightest purple
to tbe palest mauve. "These frills were
in antique satin and miroir velvet. The

of flowers. These frilled capes are likely
to be the most popular form of theater

They may be very effectively and econ

looked charming, with every frill hemmed
with a narrow black velvet ribbon, the
lining of pale pink glace, with three frills

finished it round the neck, where it was
tied into pointed ends in a quaint, old
fashioned style."

Of tbe sheerest quality has for a founda
tion a white taffeta slip. On the skirt are
eight ruffles, each edged with black satin,
which varies in width, as do the ruffles.
The tout ensemble is charming, and col
ored ribbons are most successful when
used in a similar manner.
Zibelline promises to be fairly popular,
and one such frock has the skirt made
with "two box pleats on each side, one
toward the front and one toward the back,
and the blouse is in clusters of tine tucks
running up and down and is open over a
front of gray tulle spangled with steel.
The blouse droops a little all round over
a four inch wide belt, so that it has a little
tbe effect of a bolero. The belt is of
white, striped with lines of steel braid,
and is fastened with a bow of velvet.
Spangled tulle is in the neck and wrists.
A heart-shaped niece of white lace, with
steel, is appliqued on the front of the
neckband and falls slightly down over the
tulle. The sleeve is cut in one piece, with
a puff at the top, and the lower part of
the puff is in tucks running round. The
skirt is finished separate from the lining
and is slightly gathered on the sides, the
pleats being included in tne gathers.
Openwork steel passementerie is appliqued
on the sleeves and down the skirt but is
not necessary to the effect. The gown
embodies the latest ideas in all its de
tails."
A pray zibelline owned by a belle is
trimmed with velvet of the same hue;
this composes the bait, which has a deep
point in front ; a bolero of the velvet is
pointed in front and runs up high behind.
The velvet band in the skirt begins long
in front and extends up high in the back.
All the lines being parallel give the figure
the appearance ol being cut in three diag
onal sections, and to carry out the effect
there is a high pleating in the back of the
neck and the hat turns up in the back.
Several Original Confections
Merit our consideration and admiration,
so from the varied models I havn care
fully selected those most likely to profit
my readers., To begin with, it is a long
time since we nave had any news from
Doucet, and I hear that his latest cloth
dress is of pale brown cloth, the skirt and
bolero being ornamented with a soft fluffy
silken trimming; with it was worn a
chemisette of white chiffon and a draped
belt of white Japanese silk, lace cravat
and ruffles. A aimple little dress, is it
not?
White and cream white is so becoming
to most women that Doucel is using such
chemisettes for even serges and- cheviots.
His idea of again usine white cloth (usu
ally broadcloth) for home dresses has
been favorably received, and one such
which has come to this country has ap
plications of beautiful guipure on both
tne skirt and bodice. The epaulets are of
the guipure frilled with chiffon. Maize
satin forms the belt, neckband and vest.
So numerous are to bo the smart cloth
costumes that it is well to remember that
if yon have a close-fitting cloth bodice it
should be cut on the cross so as to avoid
any back seams or darts. Blouses are
teing made to fit smoothly over the
shoulders and are as much lined as ever.
Many schoolgirls wear plaided ones with
velvet collars and cuffs. In some cases a
broad pleat extends down the front of the
velvet, on which are sewn five pretty but
tons.
Jin Etamine
Of a tan shade is much admired. The lin
ing is of a light blue silk. The skirt is ab
solutely plain, but the bodice has a blue
silk vest embroidered in tones of brown
outlined with sold. Tbe embroidery is.
appliqaed as bands put on crosswise. At
the neck appears some rich lace, and this
also is draped at one si-ie of the vest. The
lace is of a deep creamy hue. For an
elderly matron has been designed a light
gray mohair of a moU superior quality,
tbe plain silk-lined skirt measure in width
four and a half yards, the full vest is com
posed of alternate stripes of black velvet
and wnite lace insertion. The revers are
"edjjed with the velvet. Under the turn of
the revers peep knife-pleated black and
gray chiffon, one over the other. This
arrangment of chiffon also falls over the
hands. The dainty pray bonnet for this
dress has a touch of black and white.
"The Ppodigal Father."
That bright little play by our gifted
countryman. Glen Macdonough, is now on
the boards in London, and in it the lead
ing actresses wear toilets from the
famous Maison Jay, all of which are
more than satisfactory. One is of pink
crepe de chine, covered with a most
lovely embroidery done in steel and
coral â an unusual combination, but coral
is now so popular. It fastens down the
left side under an accordion-pleated frill
of creamy chiffon. The sleeves are like
wise embroidered and ruched, the effect
of fullness at the top being produced by
some frills of the chiffon, and it also ap
pears at the wrists. At the waist is a
wide pink satin ribbon, that is held in
place with a steel buckle encrusted with
coral. A handsome branching ornament
is worn in the hair. The slippers are of
plain pink satin entirely unadorned.
A white muslin dress, charming in its
perfect simplicity, is a delightful model
for a slender maiden ; it is made over a
slip of pink glace. The odd square collar
is made of the muslin and two rows of in
sort ions of Valenciennes lace, but it is
edged all around with a pink lisse frill,
accordion pleated. The sleeves are
wrinkled ell the way up and have
very small puffs at the top and
lisse ruffles fall over the hands. The
waistband is of pink glace taffeta ribbon,
and is tied in a frisky bow at the left side.
The muslin skirt has three rows of the in
sertion about three inches in width,
placed at regular intervals; the last comes
just below the knees, and forms a heading
lor the very full accordion-ploated lisse
ruffle, which has two rows of insertion
around tne bottom. The lisse is an ex
travagance, I am quite ready to admit, but
it adds so greatly to the frock's beauty
that I am in favor of having it whenever
possible.
Fit for a Queen.
Holland's youthful Queen has recently
received tbree charming ball costumes
which are not quite as simple as those
worn by most debutante!, owing to her
exalted position. One of these moat be
especially becoming to this yery blonde
young maiden, as it is of the shade known
to the French as water green, and is a
hanosome satin merveilleux. Around the
bottom of the beautifully cut skirt is a
flounce of whits lace applique of medium
width which is beaded with a narrow
white satin ribbon. The bodice is cut low
and is completely covered with lace, and
has a berthe composed of the narrow
white satin ribbon and insertions of the
lac? fastened at each shoulder. Like most
well-made frocks, each ana every one is
most exquisitely finished both inside and
oat, frills of lace and silk always being
sewn around the inside of all the skirts.
Redfem's Latest Design
Is an extremely smart walking gown,
made of a very fine broadcloth of a light
cedar tint. The coat has long, narrow re
vers of equal width throughout, faced
with bltck satin and relieved with reseda
moire velours under a fine network of
gold .and jet embroidery, suggestive ot an
Oriental applique. On the cuffs this also
appears. The close-fitting vest of reseda
moire velours has small revers of white
moire, shot with gold, and it is lastened
with exquisite gold buttons. The lining
throughout is of reseda satin, and in con-
nection with the perfect cut imparts an un
mistakable cachet to the entire- dress.
The hat worn with it is of a fine black
straw, and has folds and loops of satin
ribbon of reseda' and white velvet and a
cluster of black ostrich tips.
Virot'B Bicycle .Hats.
That preat artist nasreaily condescended
to design appropriate hats for the whf el.
They are in the form of straw sailors and
are trimmed with narrow velvet ribbon,
which is twisted like a rope and passed
twice round the crown and looped at the

ered with a regular bed of loops forming
a flat rosette. This idea is carried out iv
all brown or blue, or in gray with black,

Red will certainly be popular all sum

with three pipings of black velvet on the
underside of the brim, two pipings round
the crown with a rosette at one side, from
which rise quills and a bunch of violets
with their leaves. This chapeau is in

conclusion that there Is more in a cravat
than any other article worn by man," and,
continues this versatile writer: In the
first place let us see about the word.
You will observe that I use cravat. Ido
because I know that I am rightâ cravat is
tbe word â neckwear, tit s, scarfs and neck
ties have been used by Americans. I con
tend that all these terms are wrong â cravat
denotes the article. Teck (which is syn
onymous witn knot) four-in-hand (which
is synonymous with Derby) Ascot, tie,
bow, imperial, puff and flat, are tbe names
of tbe styles or forms of cravats. We have
a habit of giving an article a dozen names
and then fighting about it afterward. I
want to set you right on cravats. Let us
indulge in authorities.
Piancbe is an authority on dress, the
Century Dictionary is an authority on
words. Planche says, "Cravat is derived
from the French crabbat." It is a neck
cloth or handkerchief. Planche quotes
tbe Ladies' Dict:onary, which says: "The
word cravat is properly adjective and sig
nifies comely, handsome, gracious, but it
is often used suDitantively for a new
fashioned gorget which women wear, or a
riding band which men wear."
In the Century we find "Cravatâ also
formerly crabbat; Greek, cravate; French,
cravate; Italian, cravatta, crotta; a cra
vat â so called because adopted, according
ta Menage, in 1636 from tbe Cravaies or
Croats in the French military service.
A neckcloth, a piece of muslin, silk or
other material worn about the neck by
men."
Ties of all sorts and kinds will contend
for our favor this sprinsr. For example,
the straight-cut tie is being shown, and it
is one and an eighth inches in width ; also
tbe broad end tie end those with pointed
ends. The broad-end tie ties in a bow an
inch wide, or a flowing-end bow measur
ing in width two inches. The Windsor
and the Ogee tics are likewise making a
bid for popularity.
If the high- banded turn-down collar be
extensively worn, later on, ties will be the
thing, and the best variety to wear will be
tnose having broad ends; and, remem
ber, they must not have long sprawling
ends, and must be carefully selected with
reference to the size of the neck which
they are intended to encircle.
Roman stripes and Tartan plaids ara
liked when made up into imperials. Very
pronounced styles pr colorings are never
tolerated by well-dressed men.
Tne De Joinvilles will be as much worn
as they were last winter and are being
shown in the most beautiful and varied
designs, but in the selection of shirts and
ties remember that you cannot be too
careful in avoiding effeminacy. Your ap
parel must smack of rutrged manliness.
Tbe stout shoes, wearable-looking gloves,
strap-seamed coverts, tweed trousers and
soft hat will impart the tone which char
acterizes the outing mode. You must
dress for all informal occasions as you
would dress for a brisk walk or a run
about the country. If you are not ath
letic you are unfortunate. The ideal man
of the period is the clean-shaven, broad
shouldered athlete. The day of tbe care
fully groomed and delicate-looking man

' f^ONDON, March I.â "Please, do you
J^: want a model?"
*â â¢? â¢ -The question is not maddening
â when it is asked for â  the first time in the
early morning before work has begun. It
is almost with gentleness, with sympathy
and regret that it is answered in the neca
tive. When it has been demanded three
â¢times in critical moments the anxious
painter^ has descended to the lowest level
of civility, but when for the fifth timeâ
, when genius burns and the hand trem- |
bles over a peculiarly delicate problem â
there comes a bans at the door, loud and
peremptory as a Sheriff's knock, then it is
with a rage that defies description that
something between a snarl and a howl is
shouted into the face of the bold peti
tioner without.
The London models are of al! ages, of all
rank?, of all sizssâ actually of all colors. |
There are Turks and Armenians and Arabs !
in all stages of faded and ragged gorgeous- j
ness; there are Roman' women with faces
, that suggest Limerick or Cork ; there is a
small boy with, a skin like black velvet,
who says he is from Dahomey, and a tall
girl, . his hated rival â in popularity, who
wears' a headdress of yellow silk with ears
of corn and bedraggled red poppies, who
claims to be from Sou' Car'lina. 1 ;
. The studios of this particular kind are
peculiarly at the, mercy of the passerby.
There are no steps to climb, the lodge
keeper and. his wife in a little close den at
the broad gate are the reverse of argus
eyed. Two Jong rows of green doors with
highly polished brass knockers are ar
ranged like a modern almshouse around
. a long and narrow courtyard, paved with
'A sunken gray stones and ornamented by a
strip of garden, a little ribbon of green.
To pass the lod^e unchallenged it is only
necessary to adopt an air of great haste
and expression' of one who is already late
for a positive engagement. "
On a day when the atmosphere could be
cut with a knife it occurred to me '. that it
might not be unprofitable to bring them
in from the wet and chill air and to sketch
them, one after the other; at least, they
could dry themselves at the stuJio fire
â¢â and fill the studio with the 'steam from
their soaked garments and the conversa
, tion -with which, hardly with an excep
tion, they are only too ready and glad to
honor you. Some of them are sometimes
grotesque, coarse caricatures, done by a
pitiless hand; others are only absurd, and
a few are tragic. "â /.'.â¢ ;"}';
Accordingly, I removed a sign that I
was in no need of models. The first who
â¢disturbed the silence of the impossibly
gloomy morning knocked sharply, like a
postman. He was rather a short man,
with his hat tilted on one side; with
prominent, bold eyes and heavy brows
and a small mustache, turned up at the
ends. The tip of his nose looked sus
piciously cold. He wore a dirty, tie and a
crumpled collar, and his overcoat was
green with age and spattered with mud.
He carried a bundle under one arm and |
looked- like a particularly disreputable i
"old CJo" man from "Whitechapel or
Shoreditch. He spoke in a sullen and
monotonous voice.
"I 'aye a costoom,' 1 he remarked. "I've
, posed as Kins; Jymes the Second!"
He was much astonished at the wish I
expressed to make a quick sketch of him
.â¢' in costoom." He shuffled in and disap- j
peared into the inner room to change !
Toe change was more astonishing, and i
â  almostas rapid as any ',' lightning-change"- i
artist could have desired. It 1 had ha. l j
hitherto any doubt that the "clothes

spot. His costume was rather the worse j
YOUR VOICE CAN BE PICTURED
Successful pesuit of Remarkable Experiments â Vibrations Tel!
a Strange Story
I'kT is' now possible to have your voice
photographed. Practically the only
'j> thing which science cannot now suc
ceed in producing a picture of is the soul.
The voice, however, can be outlined by
the camera as obviously as if the observer
were listening wrh all his might. The
result of the experiments along thi3 line
by Professor William Hallock, who occu
pies tho chair of physics at Columbia Col
lege, have proved the statement witli
which this article beeins beyond the
shadow of a doubt. It has lonu been be-
Jieved to be a possibility, but successful
accomplishment has only been brought
about by the most painstaking experi
ments extending over a long period.
The photograph in this instance is that
produced by picturing the result of the
vibrations caused by the voice. Eve;y
vibrating boriy has a certain keynote or
pitch to which it vibrates. It will re
spond to no other note. It is this fact
which enables the construction of instru
ments, for the unfailing law of vibration
makes possible absolute certainty of calcu
lation. It is necessary in considering
iProfessor Hallock's discovery to bear this
m act constantly in mind. But for this
Tpbsolute certainty science could not con
duct experiments along this line with any
guarantee of accuracy of result.
The apparatus of Professor Hallock is
very interesting and eqaaily simple. In
the first place there is a series of hollow
metallic spheres. Each of these spheres
differs in s:zp. Naturally, each vibrates
vto a musical tone, all different. There are
available, as it were, all the different
brations which go to make up a melody
thai plessss -the ears of great and small.
Here then is the material and the next
thing is to utilize it. Each of these balls,
or metallic sphere?, has a small hole a*
one sida. Opposite this hole a membran
ous drumhead is placed. A lighted gas
jet is placed on the farther side of the
drum. This arrangement is entirely
toward the point of vibration. Therefore,
when the air in-ide the ball is made to
vibrate by the musical sound correspond
ing to its tone pitch, the membrane also
vibrate?. Here is the curious part of it. '
The vibration is promptly communicated i
to the lighted gas-jet on ibe farther side!
of the drumhead. The vibration causes j
the gas-jet to jump and therefore one
hound of the voice is registered in an ob
jective fashion.
Of course, while it would be very inter
esting, the mere photograph of a single
vibration would be piactically valueless
fc from a scientific standpoint. Piofessor
\Hallock has, however, utilized his method
*m a manner that seems destined to prove
of very great value. He arranees a series
of these spheres, drumheads and lights so
that each one responds to the tone of a
musical scale. When the singer strikes C
the C sphere vibrates, and so on through
the gamut. Thus it may be seen that the
voice, the sounds that it mean?, become
matters to be seen rather than heard. In

for wear, his long black wig was attenu
ated in spots and looked worried, but at
the first glance he might have stepped out
of an old Irame, and, with the costume,
his expression had changed; the transpar
ent, if somewhnt dirty, White frill made
the color of his skin rich and dark; his
large eyes under the shadow of those
swarthy brows had a curious melancholy,
and as he stood in the door, hesitating and
awkward, he might have been a dethroned
kin? in fear of a hidden enemy.
"I bin in a play once," he said, standing
ss stiff as a soldier. "I was King Jymes.' 1
That asertion was probably the truth, fcr
the costume was tawdry, but correct, even
to the brass "f.oison dor" he had attached
to his worn velvet cloak. With a little
encouragement he related bia experiences.
He was not a regular professional model,

with a little practice, just exactly what
these gas-jets told in the way of music. I:
has been a very common and equally erro
neous expression, from time immemorial,
that one had been to see the opera. Here
tofore it has only been possible to listen to
music, but these experiments of Professor
Hallock will evidently render It possibl*
to really see an opera and at the same time
hear it. To sVe musical sounds is some
thing few people ever expected woull hap
pen, but as has often occurred before,
science has brought about the apparently
impossible.
As is well known to musicians and phys
iologists, the pitch of a tone depends on
the number of vibrations, or the rapidity
with which the sound waves follow each
other. The loudness of a tone depends
upon the extent, the volume of sound
waves. In the human voice, the rno'e
powerfuHhe air-blast the greater is the
extent cf the vibrations. Hence the
loader the sound, tho more powerful must
be the blast of air that produces it. There
fore it is plain to be seen that the more
powerful the note or tone, the more no
ticeable will be tho effect upon the lighted,
gas-jet onthe farther side of the drum
bead and spheres.
The quality of any musical tone depends
altogether upon the relative power of tho
fundamental tone and tbac of the over
tones or harmonica which accompany it.
The less the fundamental tone is dis
turbed by over-tones, the ciearcr and bet
ter is the quality cf the voice. By means
of Prolessor rfallock's invention a singe
may seat himself before the apparatus de
scribed and, while rendering a song, may
judge by the flaring gas-jets exactly the
' range of ins voice. In other words he
can descry every note from the highest to
the lowest, as each is sung. He also sees
by means of the movement of thega*-jets
what over-tones are present, and by count
ing these and then comparing the length
of the jump of the jet corresponding to
the fundamental C witii the length of the
jump of the jet corresponding to the over
tones, he manages to gain an idea ot the
qtiali'y of his voice.
The value of this invention to singers
and to tho--e whose profession it is to try
voices is inestimable. Heretofore it has,
oi' course, been possible for a person who
was a judge of the singing voice and a
thorough musician to determine in a
measure whether or no the person who
sought his opinion could really sing. It
was the judgment formed by knowledge,
taste and long experience which qualified
the expert to give an acceptable opinion
in the matter. When this opinion has
been unfavorable the persoa whose voice
was tested has sometimes said that it was
prejudice rather than a standard of merit
which influenced their judge. The result
of Professor Hallock's experiments, it is
believed, will be this:
The voice will receive what is practically
a mechanical test; a tejt none the less

pale hair. Her head, with its high cheek

neck as long as the stern of a flower, and
she hold it lowered and slightly on one

She was inclined to be taciturn, but
when she did speak her accent was re

question, but offered no further informa

self even to such obviously disinterested
inquiries.

asked no more questions. She stared
toward tbe faint blur at the window, tbe
lamplight intensified her pallor, she looked
like a spirit. She departed like one, also,
with her strange eyes more than ever
shadowed by her enormous bat, and I
watched her pick her way among the
sunken, wet stones: she walked well and
lightly and never looked back. I amused
myself with theories, but was interrupted
by another loud knock. This time there
were two girls, both speaking at once,
both loud, over-dressed, vulgar; one had

was a marvel of fashion, in a cheap way,

Fanny Davenport recently to a girl who.
dressed and did not look prosperous, but
her face was full of animation; she bad very
large, shining black eyes and light hair
and a marvelous skin, as fresh and as
white as a lily. ShÂ« was not troubled with
shyness and made herself perfectly at
home, chattering all the time and nodding
at me with great good humor.
"My eye, you pynt like Tadema," she
began. "I've posed for Tadema."
This was a statement that struck me
dumb.
"I've posed for Watts, too, and Sir
Pred'rick Lyeton."
My silence spurred her to further efforts.
"I've posed for â for â Horchardson, and
I've posed for â for Burgleton and
'Erkomer, andâ well, I've posed ior many
ahartist, I 'aye."
"Did you ever cose for Holbein," 1
asked, respectfully.
"Yes," she replied; "when I was a kid."
"Velasquez, too?" I suggested, insinu
atingly; "and Titian?"
Her bright eyes fixed on ma with sud
den suspicion, but as I continued to draw
she replied boldly:
"Yes; Mr. Tisching nad a studio in '01-
Jand Park road, he had!"
'Precisely. Now, how is it you are idle
to-day?"
"Well, Mr. Tucker 'as the hinfluenza,
so I'm free.''
".But you couldn't come to-morrow, I
suppose?" I
like hundreds of her sex, has asked the
actress the stereotyped question, "What
do you think about, a woman studying to
become an actress?" "But," continued
Miss Davenport, "no doubt the trials,
troubles and disappointments are greater.
In addition to ability, you must have
pluck, perseverance and a nature in which
pessimism is unknown. Then, to crown
all, good health is an absolute requisite,
for the public have but little sympatb.7,
or even interest in the artist who is
obiged to be^but of the bill because she
is ill. What are you doing now?"
The applicant said ahe was a writer, but
she had never been very successful, al
thoueh several of her articles had ap
peared in prominent magazines. She
was almost discouraged.
"My dear little woman," said Miss
Davenport, "you say you are a writer and
leel discouraged-. Now, do you know
whatâ well, what Sardou went through
before he became famous? I'll tell you.
He was destined to be a physician by his
parents. Ha tried and failed, but be wrote
and wrote and wrote. Not medieval
works, but sketches, little plays and more
plays. He lived several years in an attic,
taught school, yet he wrote without a ray
of encouragement. At 28 he had his
comedy, "La Taverne," produced, and it
was hissed off the stage of the Odedn.
Yon know where he stands to-day. Well,
be wasn't discouraged.
â¢'Now, if yon feel that you cannot make
the public accept you as a writer, do you
think you can make your way as an
actress? You must choose for yourself.
And another thing, Sardou, like Shakes
peare, Dumas and other celebrated
authors, still has his trials. Plagiarism is
charged against him as against them,
and so you see that even success does not
bring peace, no matter what your abilities
are.
"Good-by. If you must act I wish you
all the success in the world. If you be
come an author I cone you will achieve
tne ends deserved. But you must work,
work, work."
With this parting admonition the young
woman withdrew.
It is a fact that Mile. Roussell, at one
time an actress in the Theatre Francais,
accused the French dramatist of appro
priating for "Gismonda" several scenes
from a biblical drama, entitled "Judith,''
owned by her. The case was laid before
the Society of Authors in Paris. It ap
pears that several years ago M. Sardou
obtained for Mile. Roussell a, pension of
200 francs from the society, and when she
caiied to thank him for his kindness she re
minded him that he bad promised to
write a play for her. Sardou pleaded over
work and that he had been obliged to de
cline nianv offers. Then sho spoke of
"Judith" and asked him to arrange the
play for the stage. Sardou gave an eva
sive reply and shortly afterward Mile.
Roussell sent him his scenario.
Wuen "Gismonda" was produced sue,
"Yes, I could!" promptly.
"Could you come for the next two
weeks?"
"Yes," with increased cheerfulness.
"Hut I thought you were so busy?
What will Tadema and Herkomer and
Velasquez do without you?"
"Ho (gayly), I don't care: they can
come for me, they can, if they wants me.
Will you tyke me for two weeks? Wnat
will you pye me?"
A red spot had appeared in either cheek.
She bad put her two gioved hands to
gether and spoke in a quick, strained
voice. There was something almost
fiercely eager in Her expression. Her ra
pacity was so extraordinary that I an
swered rather bruta'iy, with some dis
gust:
"No; I wouldn't have any one who posed
for Velasquez!"
She iookeii at me with her big, soft eyes,
suddenly suffusod with tears, and was
silent. After a moment she said almost
inaudibly :
"Hi never posed for Mr. Belaskuss."
"Well, you did for Titian, and that's as
bad! To say nothing of Holbein and
Herfcomei and the rest"
She was quite shaken at this rebuff and
I begun to feel sorry for the child. Her
effrontery had been amusing and her at
titude boid and gay. Now she stood star
ing at me In utteT dejection. Her Dril
liant little falsehoods, that were as her
stock in trade, bud suddenly armed them
selves against her. She held her head up
in a moment however, and put her lips
together and her expression breathed
hatred and defi-mce. Unconsciously I had
set a trap for her ami she walked in, and
as she submitted with inward rage and
outward courage) I found my admiration
and very sympathies enlisied for my cap-
"I'll take you for four or five hours next
Monday. If I find you pose well I'll take
you for a week."
She looked at me with incredulous eyes
and drew a long breath.
"All right!" she said, without adding a
word of gratitude.
When the pose was over she approached
me.
"My father is dead," she said, "my
mother sews herself blind, I have five sis
ters and biothers younger than me. Most
people laughs when X lies about the great
hartists I've posed for; but I'd lie a thou
sand times more; I'd right and I'd steal, if
I wasn't afraid, to make money; I'd steal;
yes, I wou d !"
The child was an old woman in a mo
ment, with a passionate little face, all
lined and seamed with f -ar and dread and
terror of the battle she faced as a rula
with such a show of bravery.
- It occurred to me as she left, protesting
her joy and gratitude, that psychology
was likely. to be a more # absorbing study
and a more expensive one than an artist
could afford. I thought of the common
place types that had ' presented themÂ«

the martyred child behind probably hall
a dozen spirits , of Joy or Peace or "wood
nvmphs or mere school studies' for which

her intrepid little manner and her beauti

first act with alight alteration, and that
the love scene of the the third act was
"textually" in the new p!ay. The final
scene, she averred, was identical with,
hers, and the apotheosis in "Judith" wag
nothing more nor less than the procession
in "Gisraonda."
In a caustic letter to Sardou she said:
"Whether you take from right or left the
little pieces from which you generally
compose your marqueterie does not con
cern me, but to take the two principal
scenes of my 'Judith,' which I had en
trusted to you, is an act which I cannot
qualify."
In an interview on the subject Sardoa
characterized the charge as simple mad
ness. "Mile. Roussell can say or writa
what she chooses; it matters not to me.'*
Asked for a reply, Sardou reflected for a
moment and smd, "You can say that Mr.
Sardou shrugged bis shoulders."
Greasing the Elephant.
Twice a year tne elephants and the rbL
noceros in the Central Park menaterie get
a coating of neatsfoot oil, whion is thor
ougtiJy rubbed in with the palm of tba
band. The oiling and the' manipulation
cleanse the skin, remove the dead skin
and open the pores, freshen the animais
up and improve their health, and they
seem to likn the process. The oiling is
done only in the spring and summer; ii
done in the winter the animals would be
iikeiy to take cold. from it.
The rhinoceros at the park is in good
condition and lively, and rather frisky for
so big a brute. Sometimes it steps about
with a step that is very much like a danc
ing step and likely to surprise one who
sees it for the first time and has been ac
customed to regard the rhinoceros as an
animal always slow and lumbering in its
movements. When the rhinoceros' caga
is cleaned out, which is done daily, tha
keeper tir3t attracts the treat creature to
one side with a tempting mess of food.
Then he slips a noose of rope over tha
animal's iioru and settles it down around
the neck and makes the other end fast
around a bar or two of the elephant's cage
adjoining. This is done to keep the rhin
oceros from pitching into tlie keeper if it
should take a notion.
The same precaution is taken when the
rhinoceros is oiled. The elephants, how
ever kneel at the word of command. It is
HQt necessary to plant a ladder against
them in order to reach the upper part ol
their sides in rubbing in the oil. â New

A great many boys and girls who are
earnest readers of our page have written
letters which they had hoped 10 see pub
lished, but have been disappointed.
They ask the reason and blame the edi
tress a little, perhaps.
My dear children, did it never occur to
you that your merely telling your name
and a?e, that you go to school, that your
teacher's name is "So and Â«o," and you
hope your letter will not be thrown into
the waste basket does not make reading of
much interest to others?
Did you write tbis kind of a letter?
Well, then, that's why it was not pub
lished. Or perhaps you wrote on both
sides of your paper? That was too bad,
but don't do it again.
Now, when you wish to write us an
other letter, tell us something about the
town in wbicn you live, it a location, sur
roundinsr, scen ery and its industries; tell
us about your pets and books; about the
flowers and trees around your home. Keep
eyes and ears ever open to the wonders
and beauties of nature, especially in this
sweet, budding springtime, and I'm sure
no letter of yours will ever again see in
side of waste basket of mine.
SPRING.

Yes, 'tis coming very soon,
To cheer hearts sad and weary,
And to grant m every boon.

Oh! will it not be lovely
To roam amid the flowers,

In newly leafing bowers ?

For gentle, gentle springtime,

St. Patrick, to the memory of whom the
Irish people show much reverence on the
17th of March, was of noble parentage
and was born in nb >ut the year 396, A. D.
When but a youth of 15 he was sold as a
slave to the people wiiuae souls he after
ward laDored to save.
While working hard, tending cattle dur
ing the years of his youth, he spent many
hours in silent prayer and pious thought.
After remaining in bondage for six years
he escaped. He then resolved to devote
his life to teaching and preaching to the
inhabitants of the island where he so long
had been captive. His friends tried to
dissuade him from his purpose, but his
resoive to lift the darkness from the eyes
of the Irish was strengthened by dreams
and visions.
After spending a few years in prepara
tion for his noble worfe he became the
apostle of Ireland, at the age of 30, and
was dearly beloved and very successful,
so much so that he was made a Bis-bop
wheu only 45.
He died at about the age of 73, in 469,
A. D.
Enough for Him.
The approach of St. Patrick's day re
minds one of a Jittle incident, laughable
enough, that took place during last year's
parade in New York. The gallant sons of
Ireland had turned out resplendent in
grean regalias, marching with proud step
to the music of the band. Those on
horses cantered along as best as the legs
of their weak-spirited nags would permit.
One jovial son bad considerable trouble
with his horse, which seemed possessed
with the insane idea that be was the whole
procession, much to the annoyance and
at the same time amusement of the other
paraders. At last the animal, during one
of its errat'c movements, caught a hoof in
one of the stirrups. That settled it.
With a look of infinite disgust the rider
exclaimed:
"Faith, if yez are going to get up, me
boy, thin it's toime for me to git down."
And he thereupon dismounted.â Harper's

Our Little Bantam Hen
One day our little bantam hen thought
she would have a secret all to herself. So
she flew up into a little place over papa's
'hop and staid there quite a long while.
When she came down I was glad, because
I love to watch her as she walks along,
scratching for food.
Every day after that she flew up to the
same place. I grew very curious to know
what she liked up th>-re, so I asked papa
to place a ladder that I might climb up
and find out. Just think, in a little cozy
corner I found a nest full of tiny white
eggs! 1 was very much surprised to think
she bad been bo cute.
She laid one dozen eggs in all, and
mamma is going to set her. Won't she
be proud when she has little baby chicks
of her own ? She is so wee, and some
times shows great temper.
She is yellow, and has a head like a
dove. The dear little thing loves to be
petted, and often stands on my shoulder
with lier head hidden in my hair.
Sometimes she fights with the large
hens. When the trouble is all over she
always goes to the one she was angry
with and putting her head close to the
other's she seems to whisper, "Let us
have peace." Of course she is forgiven
every time because she is so tiny.
The cat caught all of her relatives, so
she is fatherless, motherless, sisterless
and brother; c?-, but she dues not mind it,
for all of the other chicks seem to love her
very much, and she is the one who always
begins a fight. Genevieve Page.

Two Clever Dogs.
Trip was a bustling black and tan who
lived in a Wisconsin lumbering village.
His owners were elderly people and, for
lacK of excitement, time hung heavily on
bis small paws till he discovered a de
lightful occupation â that of ridin? down
to the aawmill on the great locs. As they
were slowly hauled by his master's <ioor
he learned, encouraged by the teamsters,
to jump on and sit as near as possible to
the front end of the loc, barking violently
atanything that might interfere with its
progress, evidently feeling that his guard
ianship was necessary for the sate conduct
of the hu.-e tree trunk. At first he was
erÂ«Â»atly disturbed in his new employment
by the late rising of his mistress, and
often, in order to be ready to accompany
the first teamster who passed in the morn
ing, he went without hie breakfast; but
finding in some way that his mas
ter's married daughter, Mrs. C ,
was always up betimes, he
next day trotted confidently down the
street four blocks and turned the corner,
scratching softly at her door to be ad
mitted, and then plainly but politely to
ask for food, which was generously criven.
Thenceforth he became her regular break
fast boarder, going back home at once
after his meal so he might have a long
ride with the earliest driver.
Dinner and supper ho took with his
mistress and breakfast on Sundays, when
there was no work to be done. On Sab
bath he was lying on tne porch rather dis
gusted at his euforced idleness when sev
eral Indians approached the house. They
were not daneerous, but dirty and repul
sive in appearance, and Trip, at once sus
pecting ibem of evil intentions, rushed to
the gate, keeping up such a clamor of
barking and growling that the unwelcome
strangers did not try to enter, but nfter
some muttering among themselves set off
down the street. As soon as Trip saw
them clear of| his master's neighborhood
he jumped over the fence and started
briskly for the home of his other friend,
taking a short cut instead ot the road and
entered the yard at the back to post him
self at the front uate to defend Mrs. C
from the intruders, who, rinding this lit
tle dog as resolute and denant as the one
that had driven them off a few blocks
away, straggled off, to the great relief of
Mrs. C , who was alone and very timirt.
Many years ago we had a larsre mastiff,
very affectionate ana intelligent. He was
one of the fiercest and most dangerous of
watch dogs when put on guard, but the
gentlest of friends and moat playful of
companions when at liberty to be
so, and as fond as any hal -grown
boy of teasing. Having been brought
up to eat and drink with cats, he was on
very intimate terms with those on the
place, and often slept with one on his
back and one lying between his fore
paws. As we lived on a ranch
in California where squirrels were a
great pest cats were in demand
and one waa brought into the family who
had five young kittens; her first children.
Towser received the newcomer gra
ciously, but seemed to be greatly
amused at her fidgetiness regarding her
fUTy babies. One day when I was
sitting in the yard be went up to
the box where pusa had left her little ones
wJiile she went out hunting, and deli
cately lifted one in his mouth and carried
it away to hide it He took them away
one by one, wagging his tail, while his
great brown eyes brimmed over witn fun;
then he lay down to await developments.
When the mother returned to rind her
kittens gone she was trantic with distress,
running rim in one direction and then in
another, mewing piteously while the mis
chievous dog laughed as plainly as a
human being could at the result
of his practical joke. Puss at iast found
her offspring hidden safely in an old cellar.
The next day Towser stole the kittens
again, depositing them in another hiding
place, and continued to play the prane
till the harassed cat carried them into the
granary, depositing them on the floor of
an empty bin, whose tall sides protected
them from her persecutor.

Dear Editor: This is my second letter to The
Call, but I hope it will not follow the first. I
should very much like to belong to the Chil
dren's Realm Club. 1 think I shall tell you of
the fun we have. There is an alley that we
piny tag through. We can go in one side and
come out the other. I have a beanbag and a
rope, and we often play with them when we
get tired playing tag and "hide and go seek."
We have a tug of war, but best of all a foot
ball, and each one has a partner. Following
the game are scratches and skinned elbows and
aching toes that have been stepped on. But
we have such a lot of fun that we seldom
mind these misn&ps.
But I should rather live in the country, be
cause then I might wear overalls ana not be
bothered with skirts. There is plenty ot room
in the country to play ball without breaking
windows. I'd be like a boy. I always did
wish to be a "lord of creation." I answered
some of the puzzles and hope this letter is not
too long. Your loving friend, Grace Soh.

joy for her to nave reared her son to be the
head of this great Nation. We hope in four
yours from now he will still please us by being

Dear Editor: I have not written a letter to
you for such a long time that I think I shall
write one now. although I have sent you the
answers to puzzles, and also composed some
for the Children's Page. I enjoy reading the
letters which come from our country friends,
and I think they will be interested if I tell
them something about South San Francisco. I
was born here, and I have lived here ever
since. There is one school, called the Burnett
School, and we also have a kindergarten.
South San Francisco is a very quiet place, al
though it has many stores. We also have elec
tric cars running out as far as Sixteenth av
enue. Mauy City children think that South
San Francisco is like the country, but I
do not think so. There are three churches.

ter will escape the wastebnsket. Your con

I^TJASHINGTON, D. C., March 13.â
ft/if 5 The life-savine service o! the
*M(lI(--l Government is experimenting
with, a decidedly new idea in life lines, the
results of which are proving: highly im
portant. It is among the probabilities of
the near future that the crews of vessels
â¢wrecked within the range of the life-sav
ing stations will be able to see the line
shot to them from the mortar from the
time it starts on its career until it reaches
them.
This marked addition to the chances of
saving the lives of shipwrecked seamen is
the invention of Reuben H. Plass of 508
Lafayette avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y. Mr.
â  FJass will be remembered as the inventor
of a system of maritime ocean buoys,'
which it was intended should form a
chain of communication by means of
cab and telephone between America and
Europe.
In spite of the magnificent work of the
life-saving corps of the Government and
regardless of the apparatus for the render
ing of aid to the shipwrecked which is at
their command, many a life has been lost
by the inability of the persons who are
clinging to a wreck to see the line shot at
them from the shore, or, if it reached the
rigging, to tell just where it ( might be
seized upon. As, in such cases, minutes
mean lives, the inability to see and grasp
the lifeline without the delay of a second
has lessened the population of the earth
by several in many, many instances.
The idea which Mr. Plass has success
. fully evolved is to provide a lifeline which
emits a phosphorent light of sufficient
luminosity to be visible for a long distance
immediately it leaves the mortar's mouth
and is shot through the gale and across
the waves to the wreck. In the past if it
happened to be daylight, when the life
savers were at work they could by means
of their glasses tell whether or no they
had landed a lifeline aboard the wreck.
It unfortunately happens though that thY
majority of wrecks occur at nicht and
therefore a luminous lifeline becomes an
invention of the first importance. By its
use the life-saver can tell just exactly what
has happened to the line. There need be
'no more uncertainty. '
â¢ Mr. PJass is more than confident that
the final results of the experiments with
his invention will be the adoption of the
luminous lifeline by the Government. lie
is a very practical sort of a man and not
at all givsn to theorizing on possibilities
not warranted by facts. "The idea of tho
luminous lifeline was suggested to me,"
said Mr. Plass, when questioned regard
ing the matter, "by reading an accoont of
the wreck of the bark Nason on the reefs
of Cape Cod a few years ago. la this case
the Jife-savers shot a line out to the wreck,
but could not tell for a long time, in fact
not until daylight, whether the line had
reached the bark or not. When daylight
came to show how the wreck had stood
the beating and surging of the waves, the
men who composed the crew were
seen frozen in the rigging, while the line,
which meant life to them, lay within :
their reach. They had not seen it. They
had been unable to find it at ail.
"It teemed a great pity to me then that
such a thing as that should be, and the
thoupnt came, 'Why could not a line be so
constructed that it would be luminous?
Then there never need be anything like
the ioss of life on the Nasoa for a similar
cause. 1 The theory was admirable, I was
firmly convinced, and ought to be carried
out. But just how to do this was a poser.
Of course phosphorus must of necessity be
a prominent factor in any such invention.
The principal thing to find out was how
to make phosphorus stay on a cable.
ORIGIN OF THE AZTECS IN AMERICA TRACED BY A BIRCHBARK MANUSCRIPT

is concerned of the Aztecs, held to be the
original inhabitants of Mexico. Professor
Warren K. Mcorehead, archaeologist of
the Ohio State University and a man
famous for being versed in Aztec lore and
knowledge, makes in thia article the first
accurate statement and the only one re
garding the manuscript, which was dis
covered by a workman at Fairfield, lowa.
Despite his learning regarding the hiero
glyphics in which the Aztecs transmitted
their history from generation to genera

to satisfactorily decipher the inscription
upon the birch barlt. For this reason he
forwarded the manuscript to the Smith

more important than might be thought at
first consideration. Unquestionably it is
the first genuine Aztec manuscript ever
unearthed within the borders of the United
Utates.
Professor Moorehead says, over his own
signature', there is small doubt of its een
uineness. It has long been held that the
Aztecs inhabited certain portions of t- is
country as early, if not before, their ad
vent to Mexico. This hud and the ancient
appearance of the hieroglyphics as com
pared with those even many centuries old
seem to give strong color to the belief re

"To the Editor: The Ohio Slate Archaeo
logical and Historical Society of Columbus
received early in February a mo=t remark
able relic On September 2, 189G, a labor
ing man of Fa rtield, lowa, while ex a
vating for the water works, brought to
light what was apparently a chunk of
wood, except that its surface was encased
with a coating of pitch. The obj ct was
found about ihree feet below the surface.
Its dimensions ara something over a foot
in length by eight inches and live or six
inches thick.
"Out of curiosity the workman struck it
a blow with a pick, causing it to split
open, revealing a space in the center in
which lay a roll of birch bark covered on
one side with strange hieroglyphics. The
workman was intelligent enough to know
that the find was of some value and, tak
ing it to his horns, carefully spread out
the manuscript aud encased it between
glass in a framp. The matter was brou ih ;
to the attention of Miss Emma Clark of
Fairfield, who had heard ot the museum
at Columbus, and she wrote there, describ
ing the find in all its details. I concluded
that the hnd was certainly worth examin
ing and persuaded Miss Clark to send the
wooden receptacle and manuscript for my
inspection.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 14, 1897.
HOW THE AUTO-ILLUMINATED LINE REVEALS ITSELF TO SHIPWRECKED SAILORS.
"The bark is extremely thin and its
natural color is well preservfd. This is
due to the fact that it was sealed almqst
airtight. The edges are torn and broken
and there is every evidence that a part of
it is missing. I Dad further excavations
made, but there was no more fragments
or relics of any description and the work
man positively asserted that the manu
script was found in a fragmentary condi
tion and that he had sealed between glass
all that he had found of it.
"The wood ii of oak, and shows marks
on the end of having been rudely hewn
with stone axes. With the manuscript
were received letters from prominent cit
izens certifying to the character of the
workman. A letter irom the editor of the
Ledger, , the county paper published at
Fairfield, states 'Griffith is a j laboring
man of about average intelligence and in
formation, and would hava neither the
ability nor the knowledge to mislead any
body as to;* the â¢ circumstances. Nor is
theie any practical joker in this vicinity
who would have the i knowledge to exe
cute v plan iike this ami keep auiet "about
it. Nor has there been interest sufficient
in matters of this kind in the community
to furnish such people basis lor., work.'
: "A tree some fifty or sixty i years old
grew directly over the spot, the hollow
Jog, 1 or wood, being found under its roots.
The gum, or wax, which not only fastened 7
the pieces together but made the recep
tacle practically water and air tight, had
been evenly distributed by turning the
block over a fire. Tnis was plain, because
the blocK was not only covered with soot,
but w;isa!so slightly charred. The char
acters are written in red, evidently the
juice of some plant. The work is neat.
"After a careful examination I decided
that I could not read the characters ;md,
furthermore, that no one could read them,
that a great deal had been published on
Aztec and Maya manuscripts, but that np
one couia translate them, and that one
half of the archaeologists who claimed to
read them gave different translations of
the same manuscript. The characters are
manifestly Aztec or Maya and were made,
I think, by some of the highly cultured
tribes of Mexico or Yucatan. A party, for
some unknown reason, eet out nortn,
carrying this little box and, on account of
a decrease in strength, either through
sickness or war, buried the manuscript at
the point where it was found. It is not
at all probable that the whole thing is a
hoix, for if it ttere a 'fake' we mu*t ac
count for t!;e knowledge on the part of the
workman who found it of Aztec and Maya
glyphs, whicii is not in the least probable.
There are very few men in this country
wno knoT anything about these hiero
glyphics, nnd it would be impossible for
uny one in Fairfinld to make them unless
he had a work at hand containing plates
of the Maya hieroglyphics. There are
only a few such books in existence and
they are very hi^h priced.
"The characters aro not Indian. For
instance, take the grotesque human fig
ure shown in the middle section, around
which is the sun symbol. Tue sun sym
bol with the character iii the left-hand
upper corner of this middle piece and ail
the characters in the upper piece are very
like those upon the tablets of Centra!
American ruins ami to the four manu
scripts or books preserved in the European
museums. Combinations of straight lines
and dots are strong proof of the southern
origin of the manuscript. There hsve
been several fraudulently sculptured stones
found in the United States, but they are
all totally different from this, and do not
appear either aboriginal in concept or ex
ecution.
"I hnve sent the box nnd the birch bark
to the Smithsonian Institution at Wash
ington for further examination, vith a
request for an opinion as to their mean
ing and age. Whatever may be said the
find is one of great interest and value to
the arcbse logical world, and there is
every indication that it points to an ex
ploring party sent north from the Aztec
country. Wakren K. Moobehead,
"Curator Department of Archaeology,
Oliio State University."
The most generally accepted belief con
cerning the Aztecs has been that tliey
camo from some portion of Asia. It is
supposed they made their advent into
Mexico about the year lISO, for from that
time or soon after their history Beems to
have been intervroven with that of the
Toltecs, a race of people who seem to have
left records of history before the Aztecs
began to make evidence of theirs, although
the latter are declared by archce jlogista to
have antedated the Toltecs in point of
residence in Mexico.
Owing to the indenr.iteness which haÂ«
enshrouded the origin of this remarkable
people there has been any amount of dis
cussion am) controversy among scientists
learned is. archaeology as to the origin of
the Aztecs. While the belief previously
stated, that this race had its birth in Asia,
was widely cherished there were many
who differed from the statement that it
was immediately from Asia that the Az
tecs came who settled Mexco. These sci
entists held that no matter where this
people came from in the fir^t place they
had previou#y to entering the borders of
Mexico found residence in other portions
of the Nonh American continent.
Some declared the Aztecs found their
way to America from Japan. It certainly
is true that every year ai least one Japa
nese junk drifts from a point close to the
shores of Japan to the California coa3t.
Instances of this sort have been known
where the Japanese fishermen who com
posed the crew of the junk when she
started on her voyaee have lived to tell
their strange experience. Therefore sci
ence has held that in some such manner
as this tne original Nortb American Aztecs
reached theset shores. No one has at
tempted to explain how they managed to
extend their wanderings according to
what several archaeological discoveries
have indicated, but there seems to be
scattered evidence, brought to light at
rare interval*, of the residence in various
portions of the country of m mbers ol the
Aztec race in fairly good numners.
All this has, of course, been very largely
theory, becausn the authenticity of the
evidence referring to the Azieca has been
frequently denied. At last, however,
there seems to be something tangible in
this lowa discovery. That a mere work
man should be able to counterfeit the
Aztec characters ana all that goes with
them is, of course, an impossioillty. The
peculiar formation of the characters re
ferred to shows, as Professor Moorehead
states, that they were not the product of
the skilled hand of a scholar of any tribe
of the red Indians. Only tha Aztec him
self or some one of modern days well
learned in the Aztec hieroglyphics could
have prepared the birch-bark manuscript.

Persons who have never lived along the

75 per cent of persons rescued from wrecks

AT
THE
THEATRES
Miss Laura Mll'a-d.
"I don't care, nothing is good enough
for me but opera in American." It was a
yoang person with a decided manner and
brows puckered up into a discontented
frown who made this remark. Sbe was
occupying the seat next to me at the Cali
fornia Theater on Friday evenin?. Albers
had just finished his glorious singing of
the barytone aria in the second act of "II
Trovatore" and the gallery was ringing
with "br3vos" and sounds cf clapping.
But the yoong person was not in the gal
lery. She adorned itie part of the house
where people fear to tear their delicate
gloves by clapping and where calling
"bravo" is looked upon as rather vulearly
demonstrative. The young person had
not enjoyed anything all theeveninc The
tenor's nether extremities (she was fnr too
well bred to allude to them as anything
but limbs) had annoyed her, because they
were cut of the perpendicular, the con
tralto was unsatisfactorily costumed â she
had seen the part better dressed at the
Tivoli â and last, but not least, the opera
was in French â horrid French â that she
had never been able to master at school.
That was thfl crumpled roseleaf. The
young person did not understand opera
in French. What did it matter how
Bweetly Albers sanp? She did not know
what ii was all about. Let him sing in
United Stales and she would come aeain
and take off her hat, if .that would oblige
the management ; in fact, there wes no
sacrifice she was not ready to make if the
opera-singers could only hold forth in the
vernacular. As it was, she intended to go
to "Pinafore and forswear opera in
French forever.
If I had possessed the slightest bowing
acquaintance wilh the yotng person, I
should have hastened to assure her that
it did not much matter what lnnguage
Albers sang in, for the best Parisian
present could never have unraveled the
plot from the few words and phrases that
were inteiligable in his vocal score. Albers
does not enunciate so cjear.y as Massarf,
Prevost and Mme. Fromeaux-Benati, but
if they had ali been singing in the best
United States, the young person, and other
disgruntled people iike her, would have
had 10 fall back on their programmes for
the plot, or else <;o home with an even
more impossible story of "II Trovatore"
than the librettist was guilty of imagining.
Only the veriest novice in grand opera
expects to gather the plot from what the
pincers say, and it is a mere piece of sen
timent to prefer the words in English. An
opera seldom makes a lasting success un
less the plot is made up of action that al
most speaks for itse.f. but in nine cases
out of ten the libretto is a lot of jingling
nonsense. No greater rubbish was ever
strung together than "The Bohemian
Girl," but people do not fin i out its ab
surdities and contradictions because they
never hear the words of more than a few
of the well-known ballads. They tate
the rest on faith, upheld by the comfort
ing knowledge that it is in English. How
many of the people who go perennially to
hear Balfe's "Old Girl" are aware that in
one place the Count says a sag wounded
Arline's arm and on another occasion de
clares he made the scar bimseif for
purposes of identification?
People like Chaucer's "Prioress," who
talk the French of Stratford af.e Bowe,
"for French of Paris is to them unknown,"
never need be humiliated at the prand
operas, because wnen they once know the
plots it does not much matter whether
the words aie aung in French or low
Dutch. Bat lA ye operettas a knowledge
of the language will be n.ece?sary for en
joyment. There will be jokes and topical
allusions which will fall flat on the ears
ol the Stratford a tte Bowe people. It is
whispered, too, that in some of the op
erettas there will be double meanings,
and a spada will be called a spade so
openly that the gods should be thanked
when the young person does not know
the Gallic for that useful implement.
Bnt putting the question of language on
! one side, the French Opera Company is
I all the advance notices painted it, and if
j San Francisco does not support the organ
ization right royally she deserves to live
on a musical fare henceforth of topical
songs and colored minstrel troupes. The
first-night audience was exceptionally
critical and discriminating, altogether
J different from the first night Nordica au
! dience, which had one fixed idea â to en
core everything, good, bad.and indifferent.
At "L'Africaine" the applause was ju
dicious and the enthusiasm was almost
j unparalleled here in recent years. Pade
rewski? Oh, that was all talk; there wns
no particular outward and vir-ibie enthu-
I siasm over the Polish pianist. Peopie
I went and applauded mildly, voila tout!
They never wept and grew maudlin, as
scribes with too, too vivid imaginations
affirmed. When people ventured on a
i timid "Bravo!" for Pauerewski they
I looked round furtively afterward, mur
; muring, sotto voce, "Goodnesj; I hope no
lone heard me"; but at "L'Africaine"
enthusiasts shouted "Bravo!" with the
whole strength of their lungs and then
looked the whole theater in the face, as
much as to say, '"I did that."
Poor Mme. Foeder scarcely got her de
serts in the way of applause on the open
ing night, but her appearance was her
undoing. The little Foeder is the regular
j French type â chic, piquante, with a nez
! retrousse, and plenty of verve and dia
blarie in her composition, but when she
rushed on the stage looking a cross be
tween a Camanche and a daughter of the
Pharoabs, there was a thrill of horror.
I Those nodding yellow plumes would have
killed the beauty of the loveliest dusky
belle ever the Southern sun shone on, and
they queered Mme. Foeder for the rest of
the evening, they and her piquant style of
pood looks, for aquiline features and flash
ing dark eyes, like those of Henri Albers,
can stand chocolate-colored skin, but a
nez retrousse, and gray eyes cannot, with
any glory to themselves. Ido not want
< to criticize la Feeler's make-UD. it was a
thousand times more artistic than Mme.
Tavary's when she played a black olavo
with a golden wig, and the wardrobe of
Elsa in "Lohengrin," but 1 do say that
! Mme. Foeder's singing would have
i created more enthusiam if a dusky cpider
| mis had suited her style of cood 1 tolcs.
That is the worst of Aida and Solika,
there is not one woman in fifty who looks
well in the complexion. However, la
Foeder entirely redeemed her reputation
on Friday as Leonora.
Albera is the sort of artist whose sing
ing one longs to crystallize and keep for

Imagine Victor Hugo's five-act tragedy
"Ruy Bias" preceded by a curtain-raiser,
and such a curtain-raiser as Haworth gave
it at the Columbia ! Some of the French
] ap-'rs have been saying lately that Victor
Hupo was a spiritualist, just like fcardou,
but I cannot believe it, for if he had been
one of the initiated be would have known
enough to communicate with Haworth in
an cccult way and give him a piece of his
mind about cuttinjr down "Ruy Bias,"
and then ekeing out the fragments that
remained with "A Man of the World."
Augustus Thomas' Man of the World
is one of the rti'lest, most tactless persons
in modern drama. He dictates points of
minor etiquette to other men with an air
of, ''Inquire within upon all matters of
good breeding, " and while he is casting
the mote out of his brothers' eyes he is
blind to the beam that is in his own. The
time is evening; tie hostess wears a white
dinner gown, made regardless of expense;
the men are in evening dress; a festive air
is pervadinz the whole scene, when in
shuffles the mau of the world in a dress
ing gown. No one reproves him ior this
unsuitable attire, p. ml, presuming on the
good-nature of his friends, he tells them
what they should do and what they
should leave undone, even to the matter
of smoking and ki-sing good-by, and he
does it all in a preachj-pteachy way that
must be very irritating, though be means
well.
If Mr, Haworth had made anything of
the part one could have forgiven him for
his choice of subject, but he bad no moro
idea of a man of the world than Thomas.
He gave the impression of tedious, good
hearted old fellow of pedagogic proclivi
ties whose solecisms coulu only be
forgiven on the ground that his heart
was in the right placeâ but a man of the
world! Perish the thought!
Hawortli's acting is caÂ«t in too heroic a
moid for domestic drama. Who would
have thought that the shuffling old man
of the world could be transformed into
the ethereal-iooking liny Bias, with a face
as clear cut as a cameo, and the bearing
of a Spanish Don? Assuredly romantic
drama is Ha worth's forte. The excerpts
of the Victor Hugo drama used at the
Columbia were confined to the episodes
relating to the Queen, Kuy Bias and Don
Sallusle, and the final scene was very
much changed from Victor Hugo's de
nouement, where E.uy Bias himself tells
the Queen that he is a valet, and Don
Salluste is not killed before the audience.
The real Don Cte-ar de liazan is entirely
suppressed in the version Haworth used,
and with him went all the lighter element
of the five-act tragedy.

"Jim the Penman" will be continued
for a second week at the Alcazar Theater,
commencing with to-morrow evening. It
has been the fixed policy of the managers
of the theater to change the play every
week, but in this instance they consider
themselves warranted in keeping "Jim
the Penman" as the attraction for another
week, as it has drawn larg houses nightly.
The coat includes George Osbourne, Huco

and in her agony she swears she will wed
the rescuer of her child. A falconer per
forms the desperate deed, but the gallant
fellow is low-born and so the Duchess dis
likes to keep her vow. She asks the Pope
to absolve her from the promise and ne

"The Foundling," which enjoyed a run
of nearly two hundred nights at Hoyt's
Theater, New York, will be seen here for

is by William Lesiocq and E. M. Kobson.
Mr. Lestocq wrote the still popular
"Jane," which had suci) a long and pros
perous run. The comedy will present
Thomas Burns in a character parr, which
is said to give scope to his abilities, and
there will be a strong oast, in which Cissy
Fitzgerald, the whilom cynosure of "Tne
Gaiety Girl" company, will shine histri
onically and kick up her heels. Miss
Fitzserald has the role of a music-hall
artist in the play and she will introduce
her thrilling skirt dance. "The Found
ling" is in three acts. The one-act play,
"Chums," will be the cnrtain-raiser.
Qrand Opera-jHouse.
There is to be a sensational California
melodrama this week entitled "Eagle's
Nftst." In this play are contrasted the
wild freedom of mountain life with its
rough chivalry and rougher fun and the
involved machinations of the stock board.
The hero is a mountaineer of the type
romancers have always loved to portray
as belonging to the "days of gold." He is
devoted to the beautiful dnucbter of a
wealthy stockbroker. The villain, the
father's partner, loves her too. and
treachery and crime make the lovers
miserable lor a long time. Nat M. Wil.s
will have an opportunity in "E'gle's
Nest" to introduce his tramp specialty.
The Acme quartet of Oakland will intro
duce a series of new selections. Miss Anna
Daly, the talented local artist, will MXstata
the leading role and promises well.

On Tuesday evening Reyer's "Sigurd"
will be presented at ihe California Tnea
ter for the iirst time in this City. It is
one of the most popular and admired
works in tne French repertory and in NÂ«-w
Orleans won many laurels when played
by the company now at the California.
The score is said to be very Wagnerian,
but with a distinct individuality of its
own. Tlis story deals with mortals and
demi-gods, the latter being of the Scandi
navian theology. Hilda, sister of Gun
th*r, King ot Burgundy, loves Sigurd, who
delivered her from captivity, at;d as her
love is not requited she induces her
mother to give him a love potion
in order tnat he may be bewitched into
loving her. Sigurd drinks the potion and
so loves Hilda that he consents to run the
danger of awakenine the Walkyrie Brune
hilde and bringing her to marry Guntner
if, as a reward,' Gunther will give him
Hilda's hand. Sigurd exchanges his
helmet for Gnnther's and takes the bogle
â¢which he has to blow thrice to fulfill his
mission. He awakens : the Walky rie <in
her ma trie }. palace and i the elves Â» cony y
them to Guntuer'g burg without the wor
rior goddess having seen the faca of her
deliverer. Gunther claims Brunehiide's
band, as her rescuer, and bestows; upon
Sigurd , the hand .of ; Hilda, but
Odin punishes this deception. : - Brune
hilde finds out Â« the true state 'of
the case and breaks the charm of the
magic *' potion by ?ar counter spell and
makes Sigurd vow eternal love for her.; To
save her lover's life Brunehilde finally
promises to renounce him, but falls dead
in doing so, stricken by the blow that also
kills Sigurd. In the last tableau the god
Odin has forgiven Brunehilde and Sigurd,
and they are seen ascending ;to heaven in
a final apotheosis. .'â¢-; ';. ~

"I do not think the world at large under

are under my supervision and so are the stage

does not do tbis for me as he does for Mme.

Explanation.
Toe arrow files with the wind. The top flgnra |
â¢t station indicate maximum temperature for the I
" fays: those underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of. melted snow in Inches and hundredth;,
, curing the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
. lines, connect po!n a of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low ; pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cioudv weather and rains.
.'."Lows" usually. first appear on the Washington
.coast.' When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the . Isobars extend
north and south along: the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
J marked curvature, rain soJth of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and j
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be "expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
tnU Â»oduce an opposite result.

â¢ UNION STOCKYARDS. lv,. March 13â The
week closes strong for fat cattle, which are selling
at pretty fair prices and fully as high as a wee.c
ago, although the week's receipts have been 3000
head larger than last. week. The demand for
butcners' stock continues strong and prices are
well maintained. The leceipts were light to-day,
as is usually the case on Saturday, and the few
offered were taken at firm figures.
To-day begs did what has been predicted for
some time pastâ d for Â£-1 per 100 ndÂ«. The
receipts we small, even . for Saturday, being
es imatfd at only 9000 head, and it d.d Mr take
long to dispose of the supply at a 5-cenl advance.
Whether the upward movement will be continued
or not next week will probably depend largely on
the volume of the I receipts. ' Feeders are feeling
ex re m ely bullish, the bad condition of country
roads keeping back : large numbers of country
hogs. Only 124,000 arrived here this week against
164,833 last week, 188,664 the preceding week,
152,000 a year ago.
Only 58,000 head of sheep have arrived here this
week against 63,869 last week and 62,896 a year
ego. The week has been n 'active one and the
diminished runs have caused a stronger feeling,
lambs moving up 15^-Oc per 100 pounds. To
day's market was firm.

Forging the Immense
Rudder-Frame of the
Cruiser Wisconsin
largest forging ever made on the
{Â£!' -~. Pacific Coast and probably in the
$liA United State is now beinp made at
the Pacific Rolling Mills' plant, out on the
Potrero. The casting is to be the rudder
frame tor Uncle Sam's new cruiser, the
Wisconsin, which is being Duilt by the
Union Iron Works.
The rudder frame when completed will
weigh about 48,000 pounds. It will be
twenty ieet long and will be nineteen feet
in breadth. Its manufacture will require
two months' labor of twenty-four men,
the consumption of hundreds of ton*
â¢ of coal, and will utilize the force of some
of the most powerful machinery in the
Wes.
The scene of this forging is most pic
turesque, especially at night when one
could, witnont much stretch of the imagi
nation, liken it <o "Dante's Inferno."
Th c enormous blast furnace belches forth
flames, from ten to twenty feet in length,
through white-hot bricks, tne men move
hither and thither from darkness into
â¢ light and from lignt into darkn s--, and
their grimy faces and sinewy forms are
brought intoatrong relief; they shout and
yell as the huge mass of metal id swung
into place, and the whole scene reminds
one of the Hade 3 pictures by Dante.
Much romanticism mignt be woven
about the scene, but in modern realism
that is waved aside, and one considers the
seeming demons moving in and out of
thai circle of flame and glowing iron only
as simple laborers, earning their $2 or $3 a
day; and that tne shouting is incidental
to the moving of such a large body and
made necessary by the multitudinous
noises with which it is surrounded, and
realizes that the principal actors in the
scene are so inured to the work, and that
it to them is as prosaic and devoid of in
terest as driving a cart is to a teamster or
running a trolley-car is to a mo.orman.
To one who has never visited manufac
tories where bulk is the principal feature
the spectacle of an enormous ma-s of
white-hot metal, swung about and ham
mered into shape with as much ease as a
mother would rock her baby's cradle, is
most interesting. The scene of the forg
ing of the rudder-frame for the Wisconsin
is about the center of the large buildings
and furnaces of trie roiiins-raiiis. AH
about him the visitor to the mill Hears
noises of different characteis, betokening
tne many phases of work engaged in in
this great beehive or industr}'.
The noises are bewildering to the visitor I
and make him start and jump in anticipa
tion of some disaster. Near him a small
steam hammer is throwing thirty tons of
force into a rod that is cutting through a
mass of red-Lot iron. Above him roll the
carts that are carrying coal to feeJ the
furnaces in the different departments of
the miils. Just beyond him a stream of !
molten stee!, accompanied by a shower of j
sparks that envelope the dimly seen forms,
indicate that a "Dour" lor castings is go
ing on. They hear a fusillade as of a
thousand firecrackers, and a turn of the
head reveals an enormous ingot going
through tbe mills to become one of the
great 3tee! beams which m&Ke the frame
work of The Call building. Over all one
hears the escape ot steam, the whirring of
the machinery and the incessant hammer
ing of a hundred forges.
Tbe first thing that attracts one's atten
tion is the furnace belching forth jts
flames through a wall of white-hot bricks.
From the center of this wall projects a
great nondescript mass which, on exam
ination, proves to be a portion of the forg
ing attached to tne "porter- bar." The
latter is covered with every conceivable
shape of iron and steel that can be used as
a counterbalance â old tires, wheels, spi
rals, ingots and anything that can be fast
ened or hung to this ereat shaft to make
it balance â have been attached to it.
Around these shapes are clamped handle
bars of steel, projecting out like the spokes
of a wheel, and used for turning the forg
ing when it is under the hammer. Where
the forging joins the "porter-bar" an
eight-inch chain holds it in position. The
chain encircles a six-foot wheel above,
which hangs from a gigantic crane that is
capable of sustaining a weight of fifty
tons.
To the left is the steam hammer, forty
feet high, weighing hundreds of tons and
having a 14,000-pound steel point capable
of striking a 70-t<.n blow. It is worked by
steam from top and bottom. The Hammer
itself isamarvel.it being the largest of
its kind west of f*ittsburg. After taking
in all these details the visitor is agreeably
startled by a toll, wonderfully sweet, as of
a deep-toned bell, which he subsequently
learns is an old lira of a car wheel struck
by a sledge-hammer. One, two, three,
four peals rin out, and from every quar
ter of the mills men and boys appear.
They scurry hither and thither, while
their shouts are hnar 1 above the roar and
din. These seem unintelligible, but are
apparently understood by these sons of
Vuican. A boy scrambles up the ladder
leading to the top of the great hÂ»mmer
and turns on the steam, and one pees the
piston rod sliding up and down, as if test
ing its strength.
The enormous crane, operated by com
pressed air, is seen to rise two or three
inches, lifting the forty tons of meta! de
oending from it; the props are knocked
out; men pull the bricks from the mouth
of the furnace with ten-foot pincers, the
furnace door is raised and, with a rush of
flame, the end of the rudder frame, look
ing like a great piece of glowing ice, is
drawn out. A shower of mixed sand and
borax is thrown upon it for a flux, and
the mass of glowing metal is gradually
swung toward the hammer.
After much maneuvering the end of
the forging, which has all the time
dripped sparks as if its heart's blood was
ebbing from it, is rested on the block, and
a dull thud and showers of sparks indi
cate the hammer's first blow. This is
followed by several others, until the iron
is crushed to the required tnickness.
Then by means of levers ana the handles
clamped to the "porter-bar" the mass is
turned and the lour sides shaped. When
it has gained the required dimensions the
crane swings back, small bars of iron are
heaped upon the end and the forging is
returned to the oven, where it remains
for from four to six hours, until the new
metal is in a condition to be thoroughly
weldea, when the same process is re
peated.
When the rough shape is finally forged
it will be cut off at its junction with the
"porter-bar" and sent to the machine
shop to be turned, planed and grooved
down to the finished shape, after which it
will be transported to the Union Iron
Works, there to become the finished rud
der of the ship that it is hoped will be the
best in the "white squadron."
The work of forging this mass of iron is
en trusted to Foreman A. W. Probert, one
of the most sKiiled workmen in his craft
in the United States. He has been con
nected with the rolling-mills for the past
six years and has superintended all of the
large forgings that have been made there.
He it was who brought to infection the
sternnost of the battle-ship "Oregon,"
weighing some fifteen tons. At the time
the work was considered something mar
velous. Compared to the present forging
it becomes small and almost insignificant.
The crane used to support this weight
of forty tons was constructed from the
designs and under the immediate super
vision of Mr. Probert, and in point of
atreneth, durability and mechanical skill
is one of the most perfect of its kind ever
built.
In the construction of a forging the size
of this, an old shaft is first brought into
requisition. After its end is squared small
bars of iron of the required length, six
inches broad and an inca in thickness, are
laid on in loose layers to the weigut of
from 1800 to 4000 pounds, allowing a pro
jection for the next addition. The shape
is taken into consideration, and the
manipulation to get it as near perfection
as possible and save as much labor and
material in the subsequent finishing re
quires much care and forethought.
The iurnace must be of a certain heat,
the iron on being forged must not be too
hot nor too cold, the time for heating
must be carefully looked after, and many
things unthcught of by one not skilled in
the work enters Into the bringing to per
fection of such a stupendous undertakine.
Yet the work is done on this coast by
American worfeinemen and is to be paid
for out of the United States treasury and
to become tne rudder of a ship dedicated
to the protection of American homes and
commerce. J. M. Shawhah.

Artificial Light That Will
Outshine Electricity
â¢"I^LHE word "science" may be defined
' ' as a term expressing the under
jl^ standing of the laws governing
natural phenomena; the "scientist" an
individual who posses 63 the knowledge
implied by science, although the term is
too frequently used witbout a proper
understanding of its meaning and applied
to any person engaged in the investigation
of phenomena. Yet there are genuine
scientists â men like .Lord Kelvin,
who, possessing that rare power of justly
analyzing iheir own accomplishments, arc
by reason of such superior acquirements
led to exclaim: "The universe may be re
garded as a vast physical machine, and
our knowledge of it is divided into two
branches â what we know of the structure
of the machine, and what we know of the
methods of its working. I here confess I
know but little, very little."
If we care to review the long list of
discoveries of natural laws, the under
I HALE BROS. I
standing of which has benefited hu
manity, we find that avast majority are
recorded as the fruits of research along
lines scorned by the army of quasi
"scientists." History is crowded with re
citals of the discoveries of important things
which at the time of their announce-
ment were ridiculed and contemptuously
laughed at by the very men whose indi
vidual claims to superior learning should
have made them tbe most competent and
iairest judges.
Lord Kelvin condensed a huge volume
of cogent truths within the few words of
his utterance. We know just a little, "a
very little," of the methods of the working
of the universe. About one of tbe com
monest manifestations of nature, light,
we know extremely little. We have
stud.cd and learned a good deal about its
effects. Able mathematicians have ex
perimented and computed the exact length
of time required for the manifestation of
light to bridge a measured distance and
HALE BROS
compel recognition of its presence by the
optic nerve of the human eye; accom
plished chemists have observed and
marked its action upon other forms of
matter; opticians have trained their
prisms of glass to divide tne individual
rays of the compound beam; in fact there
is not a branch or special division of the
entire field of physics but in which light
will be found present in some form or
other.
It is transformable into color, into heat,
into cold, into force, into weight, into
sound, and yet with all that is known of
some of the manifestations we are abso
lutely ignorant of what it actually is. For
all we know, it may be transformable into
every phenomenon cognizant to the hu
man senseÂ«. The army of speculative
scientists is divided in opinion as to
whether light is matter or not. For a
long time our textbooks hare contained
the statement that "the sun is the source
of all light." And yet we manufacture
light every night, at a time when tbe sun
is at the opposite side of that portion of
the earth where night prevails; and this
artificial light fulfills the functions of
sunlight. Recently it has been asserted
by acknowledged scientists that light is
simply vibration â the vibration of par
ticles in what is termed the atmosphere of
space, the so-called ether. But particles
of what? For uere, again, comes a ques
tion. Scientists are divi ted in opinion as
to whether there is a vacuum in the in
terstellar space, or whether the ether is
not filled with matterâ is, in fact, itself
matter.
It is an easy thing to say that there is a
"vacuum" when we are unable to com
prehend the character of the substance
tilling a certain region. The crude instru
ments of measurement possessed by us
lack the requisite delicacy of appreciation,
and consequently exhibit no recognition
of a presence, and forthwith, because our
spectacles are dim or our pint- poi. leaky
we creep out of the dilemma by saying
vacuum. Does ligbt emanate from the
sun or from the other stellar bodies as
light perse? The scientist who can de
monstrate that such is the case has before
him tbe positive assurance of personal
fame greater than has ever glorified
human achievement heretofore. Is it not
only possible but probable that there
emanates from so-called luminous bodies
a force or energy, which, when contacting
with otber forms of matter, suitable for
! the union, produces luminosity? That
this latter Is nearest to the true theory is
prominently sustained by the familiar
phenomena of twilight â the gradual
transforming of day into night, and
night into day, being due to the
bending of . the light- producing rays
from the right line of their projection
from the sun into curved lines which over
lap the straight line of demarcation. It
is sustained by tbe production of artificial
light t>y any means whatever. For the
question clamors for an intelligent
answer â whence comes tn& light pro
duced by the candle? That it was im
prisoned in the candle stands confessed,
for without the candle, or its equivalent,
there can be no light. What was its form
and condition before the force called heat
was ca'led into requisition to produce tbe
name? Why was it invisible while in its
latent condition? And, lastly, why do
we have to change a form of matter to
| HALE BROS. '
produce light, which science (?) declares
is not matter? I propound these few
conundrums in all seriousness for some
of my scientific friends to reply to.
In the show-windows of numerous jew
elers' shops in this city may be seen what
appears to be a curious toyâ a tiny wind
mill inclosed within a glass globe. Its
vanes are attached to four arms, and are
blackened upon one side and silvered
upon the other, and they revolve with
changing rate of speed, which increases
or diminishes accordingly as the light
falling upon them brightens or dims. It
is called the radiometer, and is the device
of a well-known scientist named Crookes.
It is proven that the light causes the
vanes to move. But how? There is but
1 one satisfactory solution to the problem,
and that is the assumption that light is
matter. To move the vanes the light
must strike them with a sufficient force,
and it is utterly impossible for the human
mind to conceive understanding^ of force
disassociated from matter. Now, I know
that some anxious demonstrator will ex
plain : "But bow about electricity ? That
exerts force, as in the case of the magnet,
and electricity is not matter." Is my im
pulsive friend certain that electricity is
not matter? Let him prove his claim.
Accepting the assumption that light is
the product of a certain form of matter
exhibiting as force contacting with an
other form of matter that all space is
filled with matter, then it is a simple
question of proper research to determine,
not what is that certain force but in what
proportion and moie must that force be
applied to other matter to produce light?
The most advanced conclusions of the
really scientific mind take expression in
asserting that vibration i 3 the reagent
which renders appreciable every phe
nomenon. In other words, the "force" is
vibration, and that when matter attains
the proper degree of vibration rtien
"light" is maniiested. We know that the
light suitable for general ihumination is a
complex affair, tue blended assemblage
of innumerable rays, a few of which we
recognize as the red, the yellow and the
blue, coupled with other rays of chemical
and thermal character; either ray being
insufficient for perfect white light, but
when incorporated as a whole filling the
want.
Were it possible to take, say, three crys
tal globes and exhaust from them th
atmosphere until a degree of attenuation
had been obtained commensurate with
that of interstellar space, and then give to
each, globe the proper degree of vibration,
it would be visually apparent that one
glooe would glow with a red light, an
other with a yellow and the third with a
blue. If to the colored luminosities thus
obtained were to be added the proper pro
portions of thermal and chemical equiva
lents, there would be no visible color, bat
instead a perfect white light. That auch a
light-Droducing machine will be devised
in the future ia within the bounds of
probability. Like all new things it seems
difficult. But there is a very promising
physical fact connected with the desired
affair. Tbe space atmosphere in a small
compartment vibrates more rapidly than
that in a large compartment when both
compartments are agitated by the same
force. So, by using a single globe divided
into compartments of proportionally
proper sizes the necessary rale of vibra
tions may be obtained for each compart
ment by tbe application of a single rate ot
power.
Human progress never rests; nor can
it. Rest means death. The age of the
tallow dip was sncceded by the age of tbe
whale-oil lamp, to be in turn cast into
shadow by the bright flame of petroleum,

that bad paled its radiance beneath the
effulgence of the electric arc. To assert
that the apex of illumination has been
reached is folly. Something better than
electric light must come, and it will be
found in the mode and mechanism hero
hinted at. With it? coming will dawn a
new epoch of advanced civilization. The
manners and customs of this present age
of so-called nigh civilization will then be
come as are the dark ages of the past to
the present. Man will have stepped with

common ground to those who seek with
unselfish aim the attainment of the truths
of natural physics, he will have begun to
understand the manner in which the laws
of nature operate, and in the brightness of
that era life will be burdened by but one
regret, and tnat the memory â the un
pleasantness of remembering that there
was a time when he imagined he knew it
