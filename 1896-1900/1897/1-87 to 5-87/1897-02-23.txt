ATHENS, Gkeece, Feb. 22.â indig
nation caused by the bombardment yes
terday of the insurgent position near
Canea by the foreign warships has in
creased, and the action of the powers is
denounced on every hand as a gross out
rage and a wanton disregard of the rights
of Greece. A very largely attended in
dignation meeting was held to-day at
, which strong protests were made against
the interference of the powers, who, it was
declared, were pitting their might against
Greek rig.it. The speakers vehemently
asserted that the country was now more
firmly resolved than ever to spend its
blood and treasure for Crete.
Prime Minister Delyanns addressed tbe
meeting. He declared that the Cabinet
was in perfect accord with the nation.
The Government knew its duty fully, and
would perform it in the face of every
obstacle.
The audience was carried away by the
"warlike words of the speakers, who were
frequently interrupted by cries for war.
There is no denying the fact that the
whole Hellenic people are in a temper
which would make war welcome, v even
against overwhelming odds. They are de
termined to uuhold . Greek - rights and
honor aha will persist in helping the
Christians in Crete, notwithstanding the
attitude of the powers in supporting the
Turk-.
It is reported that Colonel Smolentz,
â  Minister of War, has resigned.
M. Skouzes, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
visited the foreign Ministers to-day and
.protested against the bombardment and
the consequent encouragement of the
Turks. It is stated that several Chris
tians were killed or wounded by the shells
tired by the foreign warships, and that
great havoc was done to property. x,' '
One hundred Turkish prisoners, Includ
ing several officers, are in the camp of
Colonel Vas.os, the commander of the
Greek army of occupation.
Karorakas, a Greek, at the head of 5000
Cretans, has invested the town of Herak
lion. He has cut the water supply and
has summoned the place to surrender,
promising protection to those who do so.
" Eight mndred Turkish troops will leave
for Heraklion and Canea to-morrow. The
transport conveying them will be con
voyed by British and Italian cruisers, to
prevent interference with them by the
.Greek warships.
CANEA, Ckete, Feb. 22.â 1t was learned
to-night that fifty Christians were slightly
wounded during the bombardment yes
terday. The nuns in a convent adjacent
to the insurgents' position were injured.
* The Greek warship Hydra landed sur
geons and obtained permission to embark
the wounded.
It is stated to-day that the forts fired on
the insurgents concurrently with the war
ships.
" The British, Italian and Russian Con
suls, who recently went to Belino to in
quire into the situation there, returned
to-day, bringing with them 170 Mussul
im-ins, who feared to remain in the town.
& The Consuls state that they were unable
V negotiate with the combatants, who
were resolved to right to the end. Both
âside?,. Moslems and Christians, refused to
be hampered with prisoners and therefore
ma-sacred all their enemies who fell into
their hands.
Two thousand civilians and 250 Turkish
troops, with three guns, are still holding
Selino against the Christians, but their
position is critical.
When attempting to approach Canea
the Consuls were fired upon by the Chris
tians, despile the fact tbat they were bear
ing a white flag. The Christians had been
. advised of their arrival, ana this made
their firing on them all the more inex
cusable, as they could not plead that they
thought their carrying of the white flag
was a trick on the part of the Moslem--.
â¢As they returned to Seiino the Christiana
there fired on their boat*. Nobody is re
purled to have been injured.
The Greek troops have saved the lives of
a nunib.r of Mussulmans who were cap-
! lured by the insurgents at Kisamo Kastel.
Sixty Turkish soldiers who escaped from
VouKoulis, which place is now in the
hands of the Christians, have arrived here.
The account of the capture of the place
agrees with the report already cabled by
the representative of the United Associated
Presses.

â misted tbe Greet* flag, but have not re
newed their lire on the Turkish position.

Commons yistenlcy over the Cretan ques
tion, says: * r -;â¢*.. *'â¢ â  ***; ;*"
The British public is becoming daily
more incensed over the Eastern question.
Yesterday's bombardment led by British
ships has .brought the popular temper
almost- to the boiling point. It will not
I require much more to cause such an out
burst of public protest as will in effect
take the matter out of the hands of .Lord
Salisbury's Government.
Already it is necessary to appeal every
day and hour to the popular fear of a gen
eral war in order to prevent the force of
public opinion from breaking all usual
bounds.
This is rapidly becoming ineffectual. As
a matter of fact Lord Salisbury, rightly or
wrongly, has no expectation that war will
develop from the present situation.
It follows that the grewsome language
used in the House of Commons regarding
the dangers of the crisis is designed solely
to quell the public resentment against the
execrable policy which the Government
thinks it necessary to adopt. .'?>-\.

â  ing the situation in Crete, and tbe motion
" ! was seconded* by John 5 Dillon, the leader"
;of the Irish Nationalists. -
j Right Hon. A. J. Balfour. First Lord of
! the Treasury arid the Government leader
j in the House, opposed the motion, and in
I tne course of his remarks said that there
i was a unanimous agreement among the
! powers to avoid war. The great powers
I of Europe moved with the greatest caution
'â , tc avoid war, and such fears were illu
i sory. The united forces were responsi
l ble for peace, and the naval action which
| they took at Canea yesterday â¢ was forced

Balfour expressed hope tbat the debate

I Grete.
Sir Vernon Harcourt, leader of the oppo
sition, said the country wanted to know
i if j the Government was acting upon their
i old formula, the integrity of the Ottoman
j empire, and if they were doing so he pro
j tested against it. Todettch Crete from
I the rule of the Turk was the only policy
j worthy of . Great Britain, and he hoped
that such a policy would be pursued. The .
Liberals in the House of Commons, he de
clared, would continue to protest against
i any other policy until the emancipation
jof Crete was accomplished. To take up
arms against a people who were, fighting
for their .freedom would not be indorsed
by the country. . .
Prior to the introduction of Labouchere's
motion to adjourn, George N. Curzon.
Under Secretary, stated that the procla
mation issued by Colonel Vaasos, com
manding the Greek troops in Crete, had
promised peace to the inhabitants of the
island. So far, however, the. presence of
the Greek troops in Crete had had an
opposite effect, and it was extremely un
likely that the powers would delegate to
Greece the duty of keeping peace between
the Moslems and the Christians in that
island. The international squadron, he
declared, had no option bat to forcibly
prevent the insurgents from making an
attack upon Canea as they had done in
August. [Cries of ' 'Oh and "Shame!']
H. Campbell-Bannerman, who was Sec

The one hundred and sixty-fifth anni
versary of George Washington's natal day
was appropriately celebrated by San Fran
cisco and her sister city, Oakland. The
day was all that could be desired, a slight
crispnesa in the air lending zest to tho
prosecution of outdoor sport,
A grand parade engaged much attention
in Oakland, while patriotic exercises of an
unusually impressive character fitly
honored tbe National hero's memory in
this City. There were military and naval
displays and the people took advantage of
tbe general closing of business houses to
enjoy the holiday largely in the open air.
OAKLAND'S GREAT PARADE
San Francisco Joins in the
Successful Celebra
tion.
Oakland is all right. --^v-
If the Father of his Country could hays
stood at a good post of vantage on Broad
way yesterday morning and gazed upon
the great parade held in honor of the day
that gave him birth his bosom would have
swelled with pride. As it was the breasts
of San Francisco and Oakland patriots
did all the swelling necessary to a proper
sense of appreciation of the magnificent
scale on which the celebration was carried
out.
Even the elements seemed to revel in
the general scene of jollity and gayety,
the air was pure and clear, the sky was a
deep, ultramarine blue, and the god of
day gazed down from his exalted throne
in the heavens wit "i a smile that lit up and
gave warmth to the general effect, and
added the last artistic finishing touches
to what was a day of happiness and gen
eral rejoicing. .* ; â  -
rejoicing.
There were at least 15,000 spectators
of the celebration in honor of the
one hundred and sixty-fifth anni
versary of the birth of George Washing
ton, held in the beautiful city across the
bay, and it is safe to say tbat few of them
will ever forget it. It will remain a day
to be pointed to with pride as the stand
ard of celebrations. â¢
When some great event is celebrated in
Oakland in the future there is* no doubt
that there will be many to stand by and
shrug their shoulders with the remark:
"Oh, yes, this is a good enough parade,
all well enough, but you should just have
seen the one held in honor of Washing
ton's birthday in 1897!"
Bright skies, banners, tall-masted flags,
brilliant uniforms, marching columns,
thousands of onlooKers, the blare of
trumpet and roll of drum, martial music,
song, cheers and a waving sea of starry
emblems â that was the programme: and
through it all the great kaleidoscopic
throng surged to and fro, nither ana
thither, to see first one attraction and then
another.
.Long before 10:30 o'clock, the hour set
for the start, the streets were filled with a
dense throng of people from the city and
the surrounding country. The streetcars
gave free transportation to all the scnool
children, and every car that came in from
the suburbs was almost concealed by the
mass of children on' it. They filled the in
side and the car platforms, stood on the
steps, clung to the posts and rails, and a
few of the more daring and ambitious
were perched on the top.
The hour following 9:30 o'clock was a
busy one. The different divisions formed
on the side streets below Broadway, and
though the time of starting was fifteen
minutee behind the schedule, there was
far less confusion than is generally seen
on such occasions, owing to the perfected
plans of the committee. When the
final command was given the column
moved forward in excellent military order.
Little tots in kilts trudged along as
proudly and a great deal more noisily
than their elders, all carrying a flag and
most of them bedecked with bunting. A
large number of girls were also in line.
The councils of the Junior Order of
American Mechanics from Oakland, Ala
meda, Berkeley and this City made a fine
showing with their uniformed organiza
tion. This order took the rear of the line
on account of the fact that the parade was
under its auspices.
Over 5000 persons were in line, and it
took just three-quarters of an hour for it
to march past a given point. The column
marched up Broadway to Durant street,
countermarched on Broadway to Four
teenth street, thence to Washington, on
to Eighth, thence to Alice and finally to
i Tenth. The reviewing stand was placed2
on the east side of Alice street, between
Tenth and Eleventh.
The marshals and aids of the various di
visions were: Second division â Marshal;
C. B. White, Sheriff; aid, H. L. Weitzel.
Third divisionâ Marshal, Al White, dep
uty Sheriff; aid, E. S. Wilkins. Fourth
division â Marshal. J. Sands; aid, L. W.
Carpenter. Fifth divisionâ Marshal, Mars
ton Campbell; aid, George H. Vose.
Sixth divisionâ Marshal, M. K. Miller;
aid, A. P. Heise. Seventh division â
Marshal, A. R. Wilson ; aid. J. Munson.
Eighth divisionâ Marshal, J. C. Sweet;
aid, R. E. Langworthy. J .-.;
The aid--de-catnp to Grand Marshal
Henry Y. Dalton were announced as fol
lows: L. Gilliam, Captain Ellis, Mrs. Cap
tain Ellis, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bartiett, W.
M. Gardner, L. M. Frick, Dr. Â£. E. Fall,
J. J.James, George Remson, C. H. Haines,'
J. F. Francis, J. W. Dutton Jr., A. M.
Manning, Miss Taggart, L. E. Madison,
H. L. Weitzal, J. L. Lyon, H. P. Lyon, J.
R. Elley, N. W. Leitcb, A. S. J. Woods.
Officers Morrison and Keegan, mounted,
went ahead of the parade to clear the
streets of the throngs. The advance was
led by Chief of Police Charles E. Lloyd,
Sergeant Hodgkins acting as chief aid
and Officer Meyers as adjutant.
The patrolmen marched in platoons.
Company A was commanded by Captain
Fletcher, which consisted of Officers
Peterson, Arnest, Scbroeder, Curtis, Mc-
Carthy. Piillips, Sill, Scanlon, Murray,
Leighton, Henderson, Murphy, Nedder
man, Ham ton, McCloud and Kyte.
Company B was under the command of
Captain Wilson, and consisted of Officers
Andrews, Cooney, Green, Moore, Cocker
ton, Powers, Stable, Kingsoury, Wood,
Sherry, Quigley, Carson, Ely, Keefe,
Jacobus and Clark.
Daring the last lew months the police
have been thoroughly drilled by Captain
Fletcher, and on this, the first occasion
when the two companies have appeared in
public together, -hone to the best advan
tage. Their uniforms were neatly
brushed, their accouterments brightly
polished, and their marching done with
great precision and fine effect.
The police were followed by the grand
marshal and his aids, all mounted on
blooded animals and cutting a dashing
figure. After the grand marshal came
Webb N. Pierce, chief of staff, and C. H.
Miller, chairman of the parade commit
tee. Next in order were the aids.
The aids were followed by the Fifth In
fantry, which led the military contin
gent, in command of Major J. F. Hayes,
commander proper of the Second Battal
ion, Fifth Infantry Regiment, N. G. C.
Three companies were in line: Com
pany A, commanded by Captain C. T.
Poulter; Company G, commanded by Cap
tain W. M. Simpson, and Company F,
Captain G. H. Wethern.
The second division consisted of Oak
land's gallant fire fighters. Marshal
White and his aids were followed by Chief
W. H. Fair and Assistant Chief Fred Mur
doch in a buggy decorated with the Na
tional colors.
Behind the Chief's buggy 'came chemi
cal engine 1, driven by L. W. Calvert, and
ridden by Foreman W. B. Smith and Stew
ard John Fitzsimmons. The engine was
artistically draped with flags and bunting
and banked with white lillies and cypress.
Hose Truck 3. L. G. Walker driving
and Steward James Galvin with him on
the box, followed. The foreman and ex
tramen of the company, attired in their
uniform-- and carrying wicked looking fire
axes, which gave them quite a belligerent
appearance, marched in irontof the truck.
This was true of all the companies, each
marching before the apparatus to which
it belonged.
Next in turn was Engine Company
1. Stoker S. Towns drove the heavy
horses which took: the prize at the recent
horse show and his delight at the honor
conferred on him showed in his glowing
countenance. The ribbons of the lighter
hose wagon were handled by Louis Hoff
man, the veteran driver. A gaudy Jap
anese parasol was spread above the en
gine aud from it hung draperies of red,
white and blue. The drapery on the
wheels was grouped to represent stars.
The hose wagon was loaded down with
American flags and on it stood the silver
trophy won by the department in San
Francisco.
Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 fol
lowed the engine. E. D. Barnett was
driver. Ribbon-trimmed harness decked
the huge black horses of the truck, and
the apparatus was gay with bunting aud
streamers.
Division 2 was closed by engine 6,
driven by Philip Reader, and its hose
cart, over which was spread a Japanese
umbrella. The engine was also appropri-
ately decorated.
The third division was in command of
Marshal P. J. Keller aDd Aid E. P. Wil
kins. Charles Corner, attired as Uncle
Sam, came behind them. Corner, on ac
count of his remarkable resemblance to
the popular pictorial representation of
that famous personification, has long been
known in Oakland by the title of "the
natural Uncle Sam."
He was guarded by Police Officer Rand,
the oldest man on the force, who carried
the old flintlock used by his grandfather
in the Revolutionary War.
Homeier's concert band came next, pre
ceding, the Patriarchs Militant, Oakland
Canton No. 11, I. O. O. F., and a delega
tion from San Francisco Canton No. 5.
The Oakland Canton was commanded by
Captain F. B. Ogden and Lieutenants E.
D. Parish and James FranK. Captain
Duncan headed the San Francisco delega
tion. Colonels J. S. White and J. H. Ap
plegate, Major F. E. Whitney, Captain
G. S. NaiÂ«miih and George Kirk were also
seen in line.' .*'â ..â '-_
The School Department was first seen
in the line at this point.. Lincoln School
marched proudly along under vision
of Principal T.. 0. Crawford. The com
pany was composed of about 200 children,
under the command of Captains W. E.
Dargie Jr., Harmon Edwards, Fitzmau
rice, Hannifin and P. Valentine. All the
children wore rosettes and carried flags,
while the school standards were borne
haughtily aloft by Walter Ford and E.
Warner. The drum corps of the school
led. It consisted of fifteen boys, kept In
good time by Leader Fleming and Drum
major Armstrong.
Five posts of the G A. R. followed, Lyon
Post No. 8, Appomattox Post No. 60, Por
ter, Joe Hooker and Lookout Mountain
post*. .Seventy of tbe veterans turned out
under the direction of Commanders W. C.
Barnes of Lyon, S. P. Knight of Appom
attox and C. E. Lancaster of Porter posts.
They were led by the Oakland Junior
Drum Corps, Drum-major William Walsh.
; The Mexican War Veterans followed in
carriages. Twenty-live of the old guard
were in the parade under the direction of.
President Sidney J. Loop.
', The Prescott School children came next
in order, nnder tne command of Captains
Frank- Small, William Wilson, Leland
Sterling, Conrad Grove, Rushton Winder
son and Lawrence Brakett. The children
were supervised by Principal Gulick.
At the head of the children rode little
Herbert Chase, attired in colonial garb,
powdered hair and all. As his diminutive
palfrey pranced around the ladies just
filled the air with "Isn't he cute!" "Whose
chdd is that, anyway ?" and other remarks
indicative of admiration.
A gunboat with a brass howitzer which
every now and then belched forth fire and
smoke, closed the division.
The fourth division was - led by John
son's band, and Company 11, First Regi
ment, Uniform Rank, Knights of Pythias.
Colonel J. P. Abbott of the brigade staff,
Colonel W. J Kidd, Major P.J. O'Kane
and Captain Kauffman of the regimental
staff, were in line. Liberty Company was
commanded by Captain Hussey, Lieuten
ant Dye and J. D. Moller.
Durant School, Principal Dunbar, had
120 boys in line, led by a drum corps of
sixteen pieces. ;
Grant School, Miss Powell principal,
had 80 children, led' by a ccrps of six
drums. ~ â¢â  .
The Central School, P. M. Fisher princi
pal, had seventy young men in line and a
drum corps of eighteen pieces. The boys
marched like soldiers and made a most
effective showing. " -^Â« :
Perhaps the most interesting feature of
the whole procession was the company of
Exempt Firemen. The men were in lull
uniform. Miles Doody was in command,
with M. J. Hallahan and B. Barrett as
assistants. Lee Murphy, Joe Doland and
Lincoln Hallahan, as mascots, carried the
colors. This company had in tow the old
engine, "Vigilant 9," which came around
tbe Horn in 1846.
Captain J. J. Harron was the only uni
formed representative of the Veterans'
Fire Association of San Francisco in line.
He is an Exempt of New York, Brooklyn,
Alameda and San Francisco.
Owing to the absence of Clan Macdonald
of the Scottish clans and Court Oakland
of the Foresters, the fifth division was
flattened out to a certain extent. . 'â -" â "â¢:.
The Clawson School, Miss Colbv princi
pal, was on hand with a representation of
about 100 pupils an.l a drum corps.
Lafayette School, Miss Aldnch princi
pal, also turned out in force.
The sixth division was composed of the
Junior Order of American Mechanics and
auxiliary organizations. Johnson's band
of sixteen pieces took the lead.
Then came California Ccmmandery No.
1, United American Mechanics, in uni
form, H. L. Zimmerman commanding
and G. A. Montol vice-commander. The
Home Guards of San Francisco, also
auxiliary to the Junior Order, was next in
line in uniform, Major Brandon com
manding. Captain Plate, Troop A, Lieu
tenant Cohen and Lieutenant Whiting,
Captain W. Peterson, Troop B, Lieutenant
Manning and Lieutenant Merviu.
The following was the arrangement of
the San Francisco Council of the Junior
Order of American Mechanics': Abraham
Lincoln Council, F. B. Dickson com
manding: Grant Council, W. H. Lord
commanding; Garfield Council, C. G.
Noble commanding, and Starr King Coun
cil, E. W. Close commanding; members
of Alexander Hamilton Council and car
riages containing ladies of the Daughters
of Liberty.
The Oakland councils of the Junior
Order came next, as follows: General
George H. Custer Council, T. Br&dsbaw
commanding; General John A. Logan
Council, Marston Campbell commanding;
Henry Clay Council, W. M. Gardner com
manding, and James Monroe Council.
The members of the Junior Order wore
white canvas cap- and carried red, white
and blue pampas plumes. There were
about 1000 men in line. The Cole School
and Tompkins School assigned to this
division were not represented.
The Alameda councils then came in
turn. George Bennett and C. Irish acted
as standard-bearers for these councils.
The seventh division was composed of
Company D of' the Second Regiment of
the Boys' Brigade, Captain L. Cobbledick
in command; pupils of the Franklin
School to the number of 150, and the Gar
field School, about 50 in number. The
Swett School marched with the Franklin.
The young drum major of the Boys'
Brigade. Cassie Turte.ot, proved to be an
expert in handling the baton, and attracted
only less attention than Master Herbert
Chase.
Following came the Mayor of Oakland,
members of the City Council, Board of
Education, Board of Trade, Merchants'
Exchange, city and county officials and a
long line of citizens in carriages.
First in the eighth and last division
came the Temescal school, of which Mrs.
Wilson is principal, with about 1.50 pupils.
Tbe smaller tots Were trundled along in a
bus and other vehicles, while there was a
carry-all for the ladies R. Maundo, drum
major, led the drum corps.
The Oakland Turn Verein failed to
"turn" out. Fourteen bicycles took their
place. A banner was carried by Wallace
Clark and Everett Rose on a tandem, with
Earl Williams and J. Barry as outriders.
The small boy was in his glory at the
appearance of the Piute Indians. They
rode mettlesome ponies and were in full
war costume, including the red paint
some of them making use of an internal
variety.
The procession was closed with another
long list of carriages and decorated ve
hicles of all sorts.
When the procession reached Alice
street the grand marshal and his assist
ants took up their positions at the grand
stand and reviewed the column. Then,
as the various organizations passed by
they disbanded and the greatest parade in
the history of Oakland was at an end.
There was only one feature that marred
the day. It was understood that no ad-
vertisements should be in the line, for
such was the request of the committee.
One firm of bicyclists on Broadway,
however, violated the tacit understanding
by placing an exhibit in the parade, which,
to say the least, was not even a decent
exhibit,
ON THE CAMANCHE
The Naval Battalion Inspected
by the Legislative Com
mittee.
The National Guard of this section of
the State had its day yesterday, being in
spected by ti:e adjutant-general, A. W.
Barrett, and members of the Military
Committee of the Senate and House. It
was expected that Governor Budd, com
mander-in-chief of the Guard, would have
been present/with his staff, but he was not
present, and the excuse for bis absence
was tbat public business prevented him
from coming to this City.
The day commenced with a visit to the
Naval Battalion on board of the monitor
Camanche, at anchor in the bay off i ol
som-street Wliarf. It had been arranged
.that there was to be an inspection of the
v-ssel and men and then a boa trace be
tween crews of the First and Second divi
sions of the battalion, but the order was
reversed, the race came off first and then
followed the inspection.
The party that went on the Camanche
was conveyed there on the tug Governor
H. H. Mark-am, made attractive by a
liberal display; of bunting. Tbe vessel
was placed at the disposal of tbe party.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1897.
Finish of the Great Annual Race Between the Crews Selected From Divisions \ and 2 of the Naval Battalion. The
Contest Was Stubbornly Fought, but Division 2 Lost Five Lengths on the Turn and Cou-d Not Make It Up.
There were in the party Adjutant-Gen
eral A. W. Barrett, Assistant Adjutant-
General R. L. Peeler, Senator Pedlar,
chairman of the Senate Military Commit
tee, Senator And rous, Assembly man Cross,
chairman of the House Military Commit
tee, Assemblymen Jone-, Godfrey, Mabo
ney. Powers, McLaren and Treacy of the
House Committee, Lieutenant-Colonel
Burgin and Lieutenant Sanborn of the
Governor's staff. Lieutenant-Colonel ""C.
H. Crocker. Captain D. A. Smith, adju
tant of the Fifth Infantry, Second Brigade.
They were received on the tug by Lieu
tenant Dennis of the First Division, who,
in tbe absence of Lieutenant-Commander
Turner, commanded the battalion, and
Lieutenant Elliott, adjutant of the bat
talion. The tug first followed the racers
and. the party on board witnessed some
good work by the men of the naval re
serve.
When the tug was moored alongside of
the iron ship the visitors were received by
Lieutenant Gunn of tbe Second Division,
acting executive officer of the batialion.
The men of the reserve, who were mus
tered on deck, in their neat uniforms pre
sented a, picturesque appearance and
drew from tne visitors many expressions
of satisfaction.
The customary ceremonies observed on
an occasion of this kind being over, the
visitors were invited below, where they
were shown over the berth deck and in
the ward room, where refreshments were
served and they were briefly addressed by
Lieutenant Dennis. He explained What
the naval reserve has done in the past,
what it is doing and wbat it needs.
The party was then shown over the
ship, a number of the inquisitive legisla
tors crawling through one of the port
holes into the turret to see the guns in
side. They asked a great many questions
and they learned a great deal. They ad
mitted tbey saw much to admire in that
branch of the service, and they were of
the opinion that the water militia ought
to have the State assistance it asks for.
The inspection over the party returned
to the tug and was saluted by the boom of
tne Hotcbkiss gun*. Then by direction of
Colonel Chadbourne tin* party was taken
along the City front and out toward the
heads until abreast of the Mabel Gray, tbe
schooner that was dismantled by light
ning. The tug rounded that vessel and
returned to her berth.
When passing the Corwin, which was
dressed in gala attire, tbat vessel fired a
National -lute of twenty-one guns. Some
of the guileless individuals on the tug
were of the opinion that the salute was in
their honor, until they were reminded
tbat the day was a holiday and that the
salute was the one usually fired at noon in
honor of the occasion.
THE BOAT-RACING.
Division I of the Naval Battalion
Captures a F.ag for Fast
Rowing.
"A better, fairer or more hotly contested
race was never seen in California," was
the comment of Henry Peterson after the
first division of the Naval Battalion bad
won the champion flag yesterday. "They
rowed stroke for stroke up to the stake
boat, but on the turn the first division
gained a decided advantage and finally
won by about five lengths." * '?'â¢ J%l'
After the race the men in Division 2's
boat became the guests of the winners in
the boathouse, and a merry half-hour was
spent.
Last year the crew of the Second Divi
sion won the race, and on this occasion
the First Division determined to win back
the flag presented by Irving M. Scott for
annual competition. It has to be won
three times in succession and ' then be
comes the property of the division that
proves victorious. Yesterday R. Shuailer,
W. Giesler, F. J. Murphy, P. Murray, J.
Meyers and George Green, with J. T.
Healey as cockswain, upheld the honors of
the First Division, while T. P. Shroeder
and Messrs. Undgen, ' Olsen, Hansen,
Johnson and Halleday, with T. Rowe as
cockswain, .ought out tbe battle on behalf
of the Second Division. Henry Peterson
was the referee, Lieutenant Calden was
judge for the First Division, L'eutenanf A.
H. Elliot for the Second Division and S. J.
Pembroke was timekeeper.'
The course was from the Camanche to a
buoy anchored off Mission Hook and re
turn, a distance of about three miles.
Considering that the men covered the dis
tance in 20 minutes and 26 seconds, there is
some truth in the remark made by Henry
Peterson, "The best time eve.* made by
green amateurs, in a ship's boat, in* the
world." " v.- ; .? ';'/
The start was a perfect one. Neither
gained a foot during the first mile and a
half, ana when the stakeboats were
reached it was anybody's race. It was
then tbat Howe carried his boat wide, and
Healey, who is an excellent cockswain,
made bis men slow down, and making a
short turn gained at least six lengths on
Division 2. With all that distance to make
up, the boys never lost heart, and set out
on a stern chase. They made up two
boats-lengths, but the strain told on them,
and during the last quarter of a mile they
fell back a length. ; - >
The boys of Division 1 earned their vic
tory. They were all out at the finish, and
not one of them could have rowed an
other half-mile. Murphy was bleeding at
the nose, and his rowing shirt and arms
were covered with his blood; but just the
same he stuck to bis work and stayed by
his ' oar until the boat was alongside the
monitor. When passing the Oregon and
the bark Las Adelpbes the men were
heartily cheered, and when opposite the
schooner on which Schnalier ot the bat
talion had a party of friends the winners
received au ovation. It was a perfect day
for the races, and it was rowed at slack
water and with little or no wind.
"Little Jack," whose clever maneuver
ing really won the race for "Division 1, was
afterward carried down below to tho
bertbdeck by his delighted crew.
Then followed several races from the
battle-ship. The course was from the
Oregon, around the Camanche and back.
The big cutter 13 was beaten by barge 32.
It was nip and tuck with them until they
got into the backwash from the stern
wheeler A. C. Freese. Then the cutter
lost headway and 32 finally won by four
lengths.
In the next race No. 32 was pitted
against . cutter 41, and this time 32
turned the tables and won cleverly by two
lengths. ,
The third and last race of the day was
between dingeys 14 and 24, the former
winning by three lengths.
Harrison, Folsom and Howard street
wharves were crowded with spectators, all
of whom enjoyed the sreciacle. The
British and American ships were covered
with bun tine, and it was one of the gay
est spectacles Been on the bay in many a
day. In point of decorations the Occi
dental and Oriental Company's Doric
easily took the palm, and next came the
battle-ship Oregon. The American fleet
in port showed more flags and made a
better appearance than they have in
years. -J:-.
INSPECTING THE FIRST.
A Review and a Parade on
Van Ness Ave
nue.
In the afternoon the party that visited'
the Naval Reserve proceeded to Van Ness
avenue to inspect the' First Regiment of
Infantry, Second Brigade, Troop A, the
Signal Corps and tbe Cadet Company.
The first carriage contained Adjutant-
General Barrett and Senators Pedlar and
An rous. In the second were Colonel
Peeler, assistant adjutant-general, and
Assemblymen Cross and Powers; in the
third. Assemblymen Jones, Mahnney and
McLaren; and in the fourth. Assembly
men Treacv and Godfrey, Captain D. A.
Smith and D. G. Troy.
The party moved along the avenue to
Sacramento street and took up a position
on the west side of the avenue near Cali
fornia, where also stood Brigadier-General'
Warfield and staff.
The regimental line was formed on the
avenue, and, preceded by Colonel Duboce
and staff, marched up the east side of the
avenue in column of fours. The infantry
marched well, kept distances well and in
service uniform presented a very credit
able appearance, appearing to much bet
ter advantage as real soldiers than when
out in full-dress uniform. The cavalry
and the signal corps also made a good ap
pearance, while the cadet company and
the ambulance corps looked well. There
were about 500 men in line. In counter
matching the companies passed by tbe
reviewing oflicers and committee in com
pany front.
After the inspection the guardsmen es
corted the inspecting party to the Palace
Hotel and then were dismissed.
The chairman of the Senate committee
said: "I am very much pleased with the
appearance of our guardsmen, afloat and
ashore."
Captain Cross of tbe House committee,
an old soldier who has seen service in the
field, said: "The men presented a fine
appearance and marched well, but they
need new hats, and they ought to have
new fatigue uniforms, as those they have
are rather shabby. The Military Com
mittee of each house seems tb be inclined
to do what is right for the guard, but
what will be done I cannot say, for there
is a desire to retrench on all sides."
THE Y. M. I. CELEBRATION.
Saa Francisco Councils Com
memorate the Natal
Day.
Washington's birthday was commem
orated at the Metropolitan Temple by an
annual reunion of San Francisco councils
of the Young Men's Institute. The pro
ceeding*? were patriotic and were highly
enjoyed by a large audience occupying all
tbe seating capacity of the house.
The ball was profusely and handsomely
decorated. The front of the great organ
was draped with many American flags,
and on the ornamented pipes was a pic
ture of George Washington surrounded by
looped-up ; flags. Along the front of the
stage were potted palms, and festoons of
bunting were held up between them by
golden stars. Pendants were draped from
{ the center of the ceiling of the auditorium
to the sides of the ball. The galleries were
also gay with bunting and shields. In
front of the stage sat an orchestra which
played about all the national melodies
that could well be suggested.
Edward H. Thomas presided, with the
following vice-presidents, who were seated
on the stage :
James P. Dockery, John J. Daddy, P. A

The proceedings were opened with an
overture. Then Edward B. Thomas, who
presided, rose to make tiie introductory
remarks, speaking in substance as fol
lows: ' â¢ *-â¢ ;
Rev. Fathers, Ladies and Gentlemen and
Members of the Young Men's Institute, we
meet here to-day to join with our fellow-citi
zens In celebrating the day which has become
one of National observance, ant which will Le
ce.eb-_ted for all time by the American people
as a National holiday. This will le done in
memory of one whÂ» was first In war and first
1 1 peace, and who has left a name never to hi
forgott n, lor he stood' for the freedom of
country and of religion. We hope that the
Young Men's Institute will always show it*
love lor the wi-dom and patriotism of George
Washington. W.; .^'-V :
Mr. Thomas introduced Colonel James
F. Smith, who spoke concerning the cele
bration of Washington's birthday by the
institute. Colonel Smith said:
It was fitting that the Young Men's Institute
â¢hould take some Dart in restoring to its
place In the patriotic calendar the name ot
George Washington. The Young Men's Insti
tute was patriotic. Its principles were love of
God and love of country.
So it was fitting that the Young Men's Insti
tute should have part in ths restoration to the
calendar of the name of George Washington.
It is strange to say that It has ever become
necessary to use the word restoration in con
nection with the great name of Washington.
But it was nevertheless true. In the time of
prosperity the memories of heroes have been
forgotten. But shall it be so that the memo
ries of heroes shall be buried in the season of
our pride? No, no; a thousand times no!
It should be remembered that in the past
twenty-five years the influence of practical
politics has had Its effect on our history. What
has been considered practical has usurped tbe
place of what was patriotic. It had been said
that tne American- people were conservative
and moved slowly. This was not true.- The
calling to mind by the institute some years
ago that Washington's birthday was becoming
a mere ordinary holiday was sufficient to
awaken an outburst Â«f patriotic feeling; and
the Young Men. Institute tad a conspicuous
part.in calling up afresh the memory of the
glorious services of George Washington.
This was a Christian nation. Its Declaration
of Independence declared a belief In God.
This was reasserted in courts, even on the face
of the money which passed from hand to band.
This was a Christian nation in that It recog
nized God and Jesus Christ. * Here men could
stand together In love with a common God
and in love of a common country.
Miss May Cook sang a set number, and
as an encore sang "The Star-spangled
Banner." The orchestra played ; then
the oration was delivered by John J.
Barrett. He said ?;,'*-'*'-
The day is rich In the cluster of its
memories, In memories of Mount Ver
non and its matchless dead. Washing
ton's birthday would always have the first
place among the festal days of the Young
Men's Institute. The key to Washington!,
life was bis love for God and bis coun
try. His deeds, his genius, his heroism did
not alone give an index c f his career. It was
the love of Washington for God and his native
land that lifted bis life above that of other
warriors.
I This country bad been rich in statesmanship.
This country has bowed to the great of other
lands. So rich was this country in this respect
that It envied no other. This day was there
fore commemorate, with this in view, that the
world shared in our glory In the contempla
tion of the great and good of every age and
every land. In his greatness Washington em
bodied the great qualities of all heroes, and
that made him the most majestic figure In all
secular historyâ the matchless one of the ages.
The chiefest force in human actions was mo
tive, and that was the supreme test of human
worth. The controlling motive of Washing
ton's life was hl<i love of country and his abid
ing faith in a Supreme Being, He set this ideal
before him in bis youth, and to this be ad
hered. This it was that vitalized bis life and
made h*lm immortal. No one loved liberty
more than be. No one better obeyed a just
law. With him, also, was resistance to tyranny
obedience to God. * ;/ ; .v-.

Puerta del Oro Chapter, Daugh
ters of the Revolution,
Celebrate.
Â£
It was an artistic as well as a patriotic
programme that the Puerta del Oro Chap
ter, Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, had arranged for the celeoration ol
the immortal Washington's birthday.
The Daughters, beaming, proud and
nappy, crowded Beethoven flail, and the
Sons fringed the walls and stood up in
tbe corridors, givine to the whole scene
an appearance of strength and security.
On the platform, from which the speak
ers delivered their patriotic orations and
the vocalists, in clear, strong notes, sang
patriotic hymn-, the folds of Old Glory
made a picturesque and inspiring back
ground.
Mrs. Gibbons, regent of the chapter, in
a few well-chosen words, bid the -em
bled audience welcome to the first public
meeting of the chapter. She alluded to
the slow, steady growth of the society,
which organized on the 4th of last April
with but twelve members, and now boast
ed a membership of sixty. She described
the organization as an aristocracy fon ndec
on patriotism and not on wealth, and to
Its influence attributed the revival of
patriotism. ':-'â ':'."
The most ambitions effort of the day
was the address by Professor Moses of
Berkeley. . Â . . -~- -
In a few rapid, ready sentences he coy
ered the early colonial history of the
States, claiming for Washington histori
cal precedence as an ideal good citizen
rather than a general. Coming down to
tho present time Professor Moses de
plored the class distinction that the pos
session of the vast wealth in the grÂ«*t
cities was fast creating, and considered X
perilous to the Republic. r
To such institutions as the Daughters of
the Revolution the learned gentleman
looked for the" continuance of a Govern
ment of the people and for the people.
The programme of the afternoon in full
was as follows:
"Blue Bells of Scotland," Alta Quartet-
Mis* Ruth Kirke. Miss Isobel Kerr. Miss Ouida
Sargent and Miss Isella Van Pelt; address,
Proiessor Moses; Alta Quartet, "Thee Is One

THEY SHOT FOR BLOOD.
Olympic Gun Club's P.geon
Tournament at Ingleside
Yesterday.
The formal dedication cf the Olympic*-
Gut* Club's new grounds at Ingleside was
continued yesterday, when live birds re
placed bluerocks. The programme com
prised a twelve- bird match and a freeze
out shoot, something like ninety dozen
pigeons biting the dual in both.
The glorious weather yesterday attracted
an enormous crowd to Ingleside, and the
gun club's tournament secured a very re
spectable percentage of patrons.
There were no less than sixty-three en
tries in the first match of the day, that
number including most of the club's crack
shots.. The prizes consisted of the en
trance money and $25 added by F. R.
Webster, a director of the club, the total
being divided into sums of 50,30 and 20
per cent for 12. 11 and 10 birds respec

ERAACE'S EVIICV CRITICIZED.
Deputies Who Do Xnt Favor Interference
of the Fuxoers.
PARIS, France. Feb. 22.â 1n the Cham
ber ot Deputies to-day the Government
was sharply questioned by the Socialist
leaders, M. Jaurrz and M. Milieraud and
others, in regard to the situation in
Crete, and in the ensuing discussion
on various motions the Government's
general policy in the East was severely
criticized. BP_B
In references to Crete, M. Jaures and M.
Milleraud, who were supported in their
views by a number of other Deputies, held
that the manifestations in favor of tho
severance of the island from Turkish rule
which had been made by the French
students was in full accordance with the
generous and humanitarian sympathies of
France, and declared that if Crete should
be left to the Sultan a renewal of the mas
sacres in the island would result, and civ
ilized countries would alone be responsible
for the outpouring of blood.
Replying to the interpellations, M.
Hanotaux, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
read the obligations of France to co-oper
ate with the other nations of Europe.
Crete, he declared, had been placed in the
hands of the powers, who would not re
store the authority of the Sultan in the
island, but would not infringe on the
authority of Turkey. The will of Europe
would be forcibly impressed upon Greece
and also upon Turkey. Greece's inter
vention in Crete was capable of inciting a
general war. The powers would know
how to check such ambition.
In conclusion M. Hanotaux said it
would be necessary to effect reforms in
the entire east without the co-operation
of the Sultan.

BENIN CITY CAPTURED.
Success of the British Expedition Sent
to Fun sh the Murderous
King.
BRASS, Niger Coast Protectorate, Feb.
22. â The expedition which was formed to
punish Drunami, King of Benin, for the
murder of the members of a British expe
dition which was attempting to reach
Benin City, has been entirely successful.
The expedition has captured Benin City,
and the King is a fugitive. He fled north
ward, but a part of the expedition is in
pursuit of him, and it is expected that he
will be taken prisoner.
When the expedition entered the town
it wa3 found that it well deserved its
name of the "City of Blood." Many vic
tims of the juju, or fetish priests, wer'*
found crucified, they having been . acn
ficed to the various gods.
The juju-honses and the compounds
were reeking with the blood of those who
had recently been beheaded in the re
ligious ceremonies. In the firing that
took place before the town was captured
seventeen European and twenty-three na
tive members of the expedition were killed
or wounded.
No trace was found of Mr. Campbell, a
Consular official who was captured by the
Beninites at the time of the massacre, and
it is supposed that he was killed by his
captors shortly after he was made a pris
oner.

COLLIS LANDS ON
HIS PINS AGAIN
The House Decides to Pay
the Southern Pacific
$1,300,000.
An Item in the Deficiency Bill
Bitterly Fought by Sayers
of Texas.
D:ck*;ry of Missouri Scores the Rail
. road Magnate, Accusing Him of
Ma querading.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 22,âAl
though the House was in session to-day
tbe members were not allowed to forget
its historical significance. Flags floated
from tbe acme of the Capitol and Chap
lain Couden in an eloquent prayer made
patriotic reference to tne father of his
country.
This happened to be the day set apart
under the rules for the discussion of busi
ness relating to the District of Columbia,
but Chairman Babcock of tbe District
Committee graciously gave way to Chair
man Cannon of the Appropriation Com
mittee, by which, arrangement District
bills were to come after the deficiency and
naval appropriation bills had been dis-
I posed of.
, When the deficiency bill had been taken
up in the committee of the whole the bit
ter fight that was waged in the House
some weeks ago over the Pacific funding
bill was renewed to some extent.
Sayers (D.) of Texas offered amend
j ments to the paragraph in the bill for the
! payment of judgments to the Southern
! Pacific Railroad Company, one ot them
j striking out $1,300,000 to pay the balance
j of the judgment of the Court of Claims in
j favor of the Southern Pacific Company.
Savers said with vigorous emphasis
| that this was the old fight that had been
I going on since the Fiftieth Congress.
I Now the question was whether the com
mittee of the whole would reverse the ac
i tion of the House and give to the South
j crn Pacific this $1,300,000. That company
| had control of the Central Pacific and all
its branch lines, and he asked should not
! this be held as an offset to secure its pay
| ment of indebtedness to the Government?
! Congress ought to 'â cc now that it was en
! gaged in a death grapple with these rail
roads; that no money was appropriated
| for the settlement of the indebtedness be
tween the Government and these com
j panics; the validity of the judgment was
dmitted, and it could not be denied that
! the Government owed the amount named.
I But as the stockholders of the Southern
j and Central Pacific companies were one
and the same and one was in a condition
I of bankruptcy the House would be dere
j lict in its duty if it paid over the $1,300,
--1000 to the Southern Pacific Railroad,
which was one and the same as the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad Company.
North way (R.) of Ohio maintained that
the amount of the bill was a legal judg
i ment and should be paid. He quoted the
Supreme Court of the United States ln
support of â¢ is contention. â -â¢â â¢.
In the course of a short speech Dockery
(D.) of Missouri criticized C. P. Hunting
ton. He contended that Mr. Huntington
j had diverted from the Central Pacific
j traffic which belonged to that line and in
â  that way deprived the Government of the
j amounts to which it was justly entitled
| under the Thurman law, and looked for
, ward to the time when it could be bought
| for a nominal sum.
Dockery said he appealed for even
handed justice and would not discuss
legal technicalities. The Southern Pacific
was but a mask, a disguise behind , which
the Central Pacific masqueraded at the
expense of the Government.
Dockery replied somewhat testily to an
interruption by Bingham (R.) of Penn
sylvania and said dramatically: "I chal
! lenge the gentleman from Pennsylvania
! to read the list of stockholders of the
Southern Pacific and of the Central Pa-
I cific to see how nearly alike they are."
He referred to ''this defaulting corpora
tion, alias C. P. Huntington, and his
brother stockholders." and went on to
read figures showing that on January 1.
1899, Mr. Huntington would owe the
I United Slates over $60,000,000. He ap
i pealed to the House not to pay this claim
I at a time of widespread depression.
A vigorous defense of the judgment was
. made by Grosvenor. (R. of Ohio. This
matter presented a simple question of
| law, he said. It was not a matter of pas
sion or prejudice. He did not know C.
j P. Huntington personally, but ho knew of
aim as a man who ployed. 40,000 labor
j ers and paid them high wages; who had
! built up a great industry at Newport
News, Va., in a time of wide depression,
i and against whom there had never been a
strike of laborers.
Grosvenor objected to any attempt to
make the Southern Pacific suffer because
another company had defaulted to the
United States. Here was a railroad that
had never defaulted and was never given
a dollar by the Government to aid it-* con
struction. It had entered into a lawful
contract with the Government and the
contract-price should be paid.
Bell (R.) of Kansas spoke in favor of
paying the judgment, while Maguire(D.)
of California opposed payment. The lat
ter contended that an equitable right had
risen in the United States sun rior to this
judgment and any court would support
that right in case of a conflict. The ques
j tion was whether the Southern Pacific was
j in such relation to the Central Pacific as
! to justify the treatment of this judgment
I in law in the same way as judgments of
the Central Pacific were treated.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa defended the ;
item. He asked the opposition if they
were going to refuse to pay this debt sini'
ply because they had the power to refuse

when the highest tribunal in the land said
it should be paid.
Closing the debate Cannon (R.) of Illi
nois said that tor ten years the appropria
tion bills, in Republican and Democratic
Congresses, had been devoted to pay
ments for services over these bond-aided
roads without protest.
Cannon sketched the reasons for paying
the judgments, adding: "Here is the
opinion of the courts; here is the judg
ment; hare is the practice. But some
body says: 'Tt'is a railroad. Throw it
into fits.' He did not stand for corpor
ate interests, but he had never done any
thing against them merely to win ap
plause from an unthinking people.
The vote on Sayers' amendment was
then taken and resulted : Ayes 72, noes 97;
so that the judgment in favor of the
Southern Pacific was not stricken out.
The other two Pacific railroad amend
ments were also rejected.
Objection come from many parts of the
House when an attempt was made to re
insert by unanimous consent the para
graphs stricken out Saturday for the pay
ment of special employes of the House.
A lively time ensued while this question
was before -the House, and the greatest
confusion prevailed, but Cannon finally
ended matters by moving that the com
mittee rise. This wa* agreed to, and the
bill was reported to the House. The first
amendment asking a vote was that sink
ing out an item of $12,000 to pay members
the amounts deducted from their salaries
j for absence. It resulted: Ayes 112, noes
| 96, the House refusing to refund the
! amount deducted.
Before the vote was announced Owens
(D.) of Kentucky made a point of order
against the vote of Maddox (D.) of
Georgia on the ground that he was one of
the beneficiaries under it. Maddox said
he believed he had a right to vote, as he
voted against his own pecuniary interest
Sneaker Reed declined to entertain the
point.
A motion to recommit the bill with
instructions to strike out the Southern
Pacific judgment was defeated, 120 to 138.
The bi.. was then passed.
A conference report, on the bill to pre
vent Federal officials from speculating in
or prosecutiut- claims against the Govern
ment was presented and greed to. The
House then went into committee of the
whole on the naval appropriation bill.
Daizeli (R.) of Pennsylvania wanted an
opportunity to reply to McMillin's criti
cism of Justice Shiras of the Supreme
Court for his action in the income-tax
case, but Boutelle (R.)of Maine, in charge
of the naval, bill, was afraid this would
lead to a political debate, and would not
grant the request.
In explanation of the bill Boutelle re
ferred to the armor-plate investigation
and told now the committee had arrived
at its conclusion regarding the plate.
Congress had provided at its last session
that no contracts should be made for
armor for tho three battle-ships then
authorized until the Secretary of the
Navy could investigate and make a report
on the cost of manufacturing armor-plate.
That report had been made at this ses
sion, and the Committee on Naval Affairs
by providing that the total cost of armor
for the three ships should not exceed $400
a ton had followed the report. It was fair
to say that the manufacturers of armor-
did not agree with the Secretary's
conclusions. But the Secretary ;said 'he
had given his best judgment, and the
committee, without attempting to fix the
price themselves, had most wisely ac
cepted the report of the Secretary of the
Navy as in the nature of the depart
mental estimate.
Concerning the action of the committee
in leaving out an appropriation for new
ships, Boutelle explained that that omis
sion represented in no possible sense any
laxity on the part of the committee in
pushing forward the building of the navy.
The committee had done so out of con
sideration oi the condition of the finances,
and of what is believed to be the temper of
the House and the inability to obtain
armor for the three battle-ships now on
the stocks.
During the reading* of the bill Barrett
(R. of Maine made a point of order
against the item for clerical hire at the
Puget Sound (Wash.) and Port Royal
(S. C.) naval stations, and they were
passed over temporarily.
The committee then rose. A joint reso
lution was passed directing the Secretary
of War to deliver to the citizens' com
mittee of the National encampment of the
G. A. R., at Buffalo, N. V., one con
demned cannon to be used in furnishing
memorial badges.
A conference report on the bill appro
priating $250,000 for closing , the crevasse
at Passe a I' Out re, La., was presented and
agreed to.
The House then, at 5:20, adjourned
until to-morrow. .: >

Senators Listen to the Reading of Wash
ington's Farewell address. -
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 22.âDe
spite the rainstorm, the galleries of the
Senate were crowded when the session to

was unusually small. On the Democratic

in pursuance of the order made a few days
since, . Daniel (D.) of Virginia took a
position by the side of the Vice-President
and proceeded to read Washington's fare
well address, in commemoration of Wash
ington's birthday.
The reading occupied one hour, and at
its conclusion consideration of the Indian
bill was resumed. The pending question
was the committee amendment making
temporary provision for contract schools
for Indian children, the vote having been
ordered for 1 o'clock. The amendment was
agreed to by a vote of 48 to 8. The nega
tive votes were given by Senators Brown,
Cannon, Chandler, Gallinger, Lodge, Pef
fer, Piatt and Thurston.
Hill (D.) of New York â¢ presented the
credentials of Thomas C. Piatt as his suc
cessor in the Senate from March 4 next.
An amendment was . offered by Gallin
> ger (R.) of New Hampshire and wa'p
agreed to, declaring it to be the settled
policy of the Government hereafter to
make no . appropriations whatever for
education in auy sectarian school.
Another amendment was offered by
Gallinger declaring that all appropria
tions for contract schools shall absolutely
cease and terminate at the end of the
fiscal year 1898, but it was ruled out on a
point of order that it was general legisla
tion by a vote of 28 to 22.
Gallinger attacked an amendment of
the committee appropriating $8000 for the
purchase of 320 acres, at not over $25 an
acre, for an industrial farm at Flandrau,
S. D. He did not think farming lands
out there were worth any such price.
' Pettigrew defended the amendment, but
action on it was postponed. A similar
item for the Indian school at Pierre, S. D.,
was also postponed.
In the further course of the debate Gal
linger criticized some of the minor items
in the bill.
Pettigrew retorted that the place to
begin economy was not in matters of small
appropriations; it could better be com
menced in matters of greater im
portance; it should be practiced in con
nection with the millions that were ap
propriated for the construction of ships
that would not float; in the building of
battle-ships that were rusting away, and
in striking out the appropriation of ten
millions of dollars for fortifications that in
view of the treaty of arbitration would not
be needed.
Gallinger said he shared the feeling that
we ought not to go too deeply into naval
appropriations in view of the deple'ed
condition of tbe treasury, but he did not
believe he was violating any of the secrets
of the session when he said there was very
little probability of the treaty arbitration
being ratified, at tbis session of Congress
at least.
Gallinger said tie understood very well
that the Senator from South Dakota took
very little interest in the naval bill, for
the reason, situated as be was, that he
could, in case of attack, take to the Black
Hills for safety.
The bill was laid aside.
A message from the President vetoing
the private pension bill for Maria . SÂ«-mer
lat, widow of a private soldier, was laid
before the House and was attacked by
several Senators. Among others Morgan
sneered at the idea of the small aggregate
amount of all tie pension bills passed by
this Congress as compared with the
amount paid to the "bond syndicate."
Gallinger referred to Cleveland's vetoe 1 *
of pension bills as "trivial and foolish,"
and Hoar asserted that such private pen
sion bills had never been questioned until
the modern method of finding fault with
them came in vogue.
The veto was referred to the Committee
on Pensions.
A resolution was offered by Allison and
was agreed to for daily sessions at 11
a. m. from and after Wednesday next.
The Senate at 6p. m. adjourned until to
morrow. . -

WORK OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE.
Bills Introduced by Wholesale,
But Very Few Measures
Have Become Laws.
So Far the Assembly Leads in Activity,
Though Only a Small Fraction of the
Business in Both Houses Has
Been Disposed Of.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 22.â This is the fiftieth day of the thirty-second session of the Legislature of California, and
were it not a legal holiday would have been, under the joint rules, the last day on which bills could be introduced without the
consent of two-thirds of the members. As it happened Saturday was the last day for the introduction of bills, and several
members in each House were taken rather unaware by this circumstance, and now mourn the lost opportunity of paternity to
a more numerous progeny.
Taken on the whole pretty fair work in the matter of introduction of bills and other measures has been done, though
the aggregate has not come quite up to that of the last session, In view of the fact that the flood of new business has now
virtually stopped, it is interesting to review what has been accomplished during the fifty days in both houses, and to ascer
tain in reference to the Legislature as a whole "where it is at."
Notwithstanding the large amount of time consumed in the Assembly over the Duckworth and State Printing Office
controversies, that body holds the record for greater industry, both in the number of measures introduced and in the amount
of business dispatched, as tbe following figures will show:
Bills introduced in Senate, 728; bills introduced in Assembly, 973; joint resolutions in Senate, 15; joint resolutions in Assembly, 28;
constitutional amendments in Senate, 39; constitutional amendments ia Assembly, 39; concurrent, resolutions in Senate. 4; concurrent
resolutions in Assembly, 7; total measures in Senate, 780; total measures in Assembly, 1047. _-,-.( ' _ ,* . 7.
Bills finally passed la Senate, 171; bills finally passed in Assembly, 199; measures on the file of the Senate, 380; measures on the file
of the Assembly, 420; measures for third reading in Senate, 58; measures for third reading in Assembly, 111; measures for second reading
in Senate, 180; measures for second reading in Assembly, 217. ;-â - 'â¢; 'â  .'
So much for a comparison of the work in the two branches. An equally interesting showing is made by the figures giving
the business of the Legislature as a whole:
Total number of measures introduced, 1833; total number finally acted upon (passed or killed), 245; measures that have become laws,
18; measures that have been killed, 109; measures that nave passed both houses, 58; measures that have passed the Senate only, 95; meas
ures that have passed the Assembly only, 123; measures still in the hand ot the committees of either House, 782.
From the latter group of figures it will be seen that but a small fraction of the business has thus far been disposed of, as
hut 245 out of the 1833 measures introduced have been finally acted upon, while nearly half of the measures are still in the
hands of the various committees of one or the other House. Those who have been watching most closely the progress of
affairs are of the opinion that it will be at least another four weeks before adjournment sine die is taken; that is, March 20
while the more hopeful place the date for dispersion on March 13.

AMERICANS FEEL
UNSAFE IN CUBA
So There Is a Great ' 'Exodus
From the Distured
Island.
Secretary O'.ney Has Demanded From
' Spanish Authorities an Explana
tion of Ruiz's Death.
WASHINGTON, D. CL, Feb. Secre
tary Olney has demanded in Havana and
in Madrid a full explanation of the death
of Dr. Kicardo Ruiz, who was secretly ar
rested on a charge of complicity in derail
ing a train carrying Spanish troops.
Ruiz was said to have been a naturalized
American citizen. He died in jail un
der suspicious circumstances. Other pris
oners said he was murdered, but the Span
ish authorities insist that be committed
suicide.
Ever since the arrest of Ruiz the au
thorities have refused to give Consul-
General Lee any information, and it was
not until he mado a peremptory demand
for Ruiz's body that the Marquis of Ahu
mada issued the necessary order. When
the body was turned over to Consul-
General Lee an inspection showed that
the face and head haa been battered in.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. '22.â dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: The
attitude assumed by Consul-General Lee
in the case of tne death of tbe American
citizen, Ricardo Ruiz, has made the Amer
ican representative very unpopular among
the Spaniards. The communication sent
; to General Lee. by the Marquis of Ahum*
j ada is highly praised by the Spaniards.
! The case is very similar to that of Charles
Govin, who was undoubtedly assassinated
by the Spaniards. In that cases all the
protests of General Lee were useless
against the formal official denial by the
Marquis of Ahumada tbat Govin had been
j killed by the Spaniards and in the face of
! the indifference shown in the matter by
| the American administration.
Ricardo Ruiz was slain in a manner
j called componente here, that is, be was
! struck over the head with a piece of wood
! or iron and his sKuil wa<- fractured so that
| be died. But how can this fact be proved
i if tbe Spanish authorities certify tbat be
| committed suicide by dashing bis head
i against the wall? The autopsy can only
I show tbat the man suffered from violence,
i but whether inflicted by himself or by an
j otner person is difficult to tell.
Since the death of Govin the belief is
! general here that the Spaniards can kill
all the American citizens in Cuba without
being called to account for the crimes.
The great majority of tbe American resi
dents of Cuba are leaving the island.
LEE H AS RESIGNED.
Such Is the Report That Cornea From
Key West.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 22.â A dis
patch to the Herald from Havana via Key
West says: Consul-General Lee has re
signed. His letter tendering his resigna
tion under certain conditions goes by the
next mail. He determined some days ago
to take such a step if he were not upheld
in bis efforts to protect all American citi
zens in Cuba. *' * â¢
The Consul-General asked tbe State De
partment that he be authorized to de
mand the release of citizens of tbe United
States confined , in Cuban prisons under
the same illegal circumstances as was the
ill-fated Ruiz. Sncb authorization has
not been granted him.
Spanish warships in Cuban waters have
since Sunday been concentrating in tbe
harbor of Havana. This is regarded here
as very significant in view of the impor
tant incidents of the last few days.
Great anxiety is felt at the palace and
in all official circles at tbe news from
Cienfuegos, which is tbat that city is in
mutiny of the Spanish troops. Large ar
rears of pay are due the army in Cuba,
and the discontent caused by this has cul
minated in open disobedience in the
Spanish ranks in the Cienfuegos district.
The insurgents in the eastern end of tbe
island have captured. Bayamo, an impor
tant town in Santiago.

SANFORD AND
THE MILLMEN
Reiterates His Charges as
to Abuse of Northern
Lumbermen.
Will Rise to a Question of
Privilege in the Assembly .
and Answer Criticism.
At Some of the Mendocino Loggia?
Camps, He Says, Workmen Are
Unjustly Treated.
SACRAMENTO. Cal,; Feb. 22.âTo
morrow, after the reading of the journal
in the Assembly, Santord of Mendocino
will rise to a question of personal privi
lege in reply to a dispatch from TJkiab in
last Sunday's Call, in which bis state
ments with reference to the treatment of
employes by the lumber companies are
denounced as false. Mr. Sanford will say:
"I see in The Call of last Sunday a pro
test from Mendocino County in relation
to what I said in my speech on Monday,
February 15. 1597, regarding the treat
ment of laboring men employed by the
milling companies in Mend.cino County.
In my opening statement I said that some
companies wanted to do what was right
and treated their men fairly well, while
others were tyrannical in the extreme and
refused to do the fair thing by the men.
"I have no apology to make for any
thing I said. On the contrary, I set forth
the condition of affairs very miialy. There
is not a single mill company in Mendo
cino County that I know of, and I know
them all, that does not withhold tbe
wages of their men all the way from two
to six months, charging them from 15 to
20 per cent discount, and virtually com
pelling the men to trade in the truck
â tores, thereby again charging them exorbi
tant prices for the goods.
"The companies from Gualala to Caspar
treat the men better than others, but the'
companies north of Caspar are. the ones
from which the greatest complaints come.
These companies on the Northern Mendo
cino coast are the ones that treat the em
ployes so shamefully, namely, Fort Bragg,
Cottoneva, Hardy Creek, Usal. \
"In order to meet the ; charge as to
whether I have misstated facts I will read
some letters from worKinemen in those
sections. This will snow you what they
think of the treatment they receive at the
hands of these companies. All those let
ters are on lilo in Labor Commissioner
Fitzgerald's office."
Tbe following aro extracts from the let
ters to be read to-morrow by Mr. Sanford.
C. I. Smith, an Eastern man, writes as fol
lows concerning a visit made by him to
Fort Bragg:
If you value your time, your lire or your
rights as au American citizen, stay clear of the
Union Lumber Company at Fort Bragg. In
the first place, they want a man to work twelve
hours for a day'?! work, on wages ranging all
the way from 76 cents up to $1 34; but in or
der to get the best wages (or $1 34) a man has
to be able to run a steam skidder, keen it in
repair and do his own firing, and then, for an
appetizer for breakfast, it is quite necessary
for him to get up in the morning at 4:30 and
start his fire no he will have steam by 6
o'clockâ their regular starting slme.
When dinner time comes one of our native
sons (John Chinaman) comes out with a horn
(that some poor old ox has been robbed of
after he got so feeble that he could not stand
the hardship of the company any longer) and
blows a blast that causes the blood in the fel
low-oxen's veins to run cold; for, should he
happen to make a misstep and injure himself
so no could not work these 180 men that are
being called to dinner would be picking the
meat off his bones inside of twelve hours.
When It comes to the sleeping part, if you
have not your own bed complete you are not
mil. All that is provided is a board shanty,
and they take particular pains to have tbe
boards far enough apart so there is no need of
windows; for bedsteads they have provided
little wooden boxes with straw ln them, the
same as I used for my dog. A pile of sand in
the middle of the floor, with a holexut in the
roof directly above, constitutes the fireplace
and you have what they call the "Union Lum
ber Company building."
They also have a fine system of paying every
three months. As regular as the time comes
you get a sixty-day sight-draft, whether you
need it or not; or, in. other words, you get a
written guarantee that there ls so mnch com
ing to you that you cannot get until sixty
days from date, unless you will sell it at a dis
count from 7 to 10 per emu But, to cap the
climax, they took $6 out of what was coming
to me, and I don't know what it was forâ they
sold it wag for taxes, but I would as soon be
lieve it was to buy fireworks for the Fourth, as
I never saw a tax collector, and was never
asked to pay any taxes, or even told how much
they would be if I was assessed.
If that is California's law, allow me to con
gratulate the lawmakers on their success of
dealing out justice and freedom; but lam
glad I got away alive, for there were two men
killed while I was there, and five crippled,
and some of them crippled for life.
H. Land of Usal writes to the Labor
Commissioner as follows:
Dear Sir: My object ln writing to you Is to
gain a little advic. and information regarding
a lawsuit of which I will tell you in tbis letter.
I went to work for a corporation, which is
known as the firm of Cottoneva Lumber Com
pany, at Rockport of this county. I started to
work on the 22d day of May of last year, and
stayed there until the 6th day of August, on
which day I was discharged. I went to the
office to get my money, and in payment for my
work the superintendent offered me a time
draft, payable sixty days after sight. I would

Another working-nan, whose name is

as follows: ?â >*;.Â»Â«.*-.â ..*'Â«,,-.
My Tear Sir: * * * You spoke in ycur let
ter about looking into the lumber industries,
time-check system, etc., up In this locality. I
wish to say right here, I have often thought of
writing to you on the subject. The Mendocino
cons employs something like 5000 men, and
you have no idea how these men are treated â
words cannot express it. Take this company
here. They pay their men every ninety days
with sixty-day time checks. When the wort
men set "these sixty-day checks they cannot
get them cashed here unless they pay from
15 to 20 per cent discount. Those who cannot
get their checks cashed here at the above dis
count send them to San Francisco, and when
the sixty days expire this" company will not
pay them for months. Then there are thou
sands of dollars of sixty-day checks belonging
to the laboring men ln San Francisco. Now
they have been due since last September, ifn
pnld. Lost summer this company had about
100 nead of old bulls, which they have been
working for years, hauling logs with them in
the woods. They commenced to use machin
ery lor getting out their logs. They then
killed their old rotten bulls and fed them to
their laboring men in the woods. Every man
in this section will teli you this. Men wno
worked in the camps at the time tell me ihey
went months without eating meatâ tbey could
not eat it.
The following will be quoted by Mr.
Saniord from the Fort Bragg Advocate.
The letter is dated â â¢Rockport" :
With regard to Rockport, I would say that,
judging the future by the past, and speaking
both by observation and experience, there is
very little inducement for any self-r^spac ing
man to come here, unless he Is willing to
leave all bis earnings in the company's oon
and store at prices which would make a '49t*r
blush. Should anything of bis earnings es
cape the rapacity of barkeeper* and . store
keeper, he receives a sixty-day draft on the
15th of each month; this he can take home
ana frame and hang it up to remind him of
all the hard licks he put in to acquire it, for
it is about as negotiable as a Confederate
greenback, without possessing any value as
a historical relic. At the end of sixty days
be can take it back to the -bookkeeper, who
will take about ten days more to exchange it
for a draft on some bank down below the
Mason aDd Dixon line. If by this time the
bank ls still in existence and the cost of col
lection don't eat it all up, he gets bis money.
A man would naturally think he had some
title to his money by this time, but no. Should
he object to paying a dollar for a pair of 40
--cent overalls, or 10 cents a pound for sugar,
ana patronize such enterprising merchants as
Shafiky Bros., he will quickly find himself
upon the retired list, io matter what his
capacity is, and get blacklisted the coast over
in the bargain, and it is about time for Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald to look this up.
Joseph Brier of East Oakland writes:
On the morning of May 5, 1596, 1 asked and
received my time check; 1 ure v. $3 worth of
goods at the store during my mon ill's stay,
Â»nd that was deducted from the check: the
clerk informed me that I could have the check
cashed xt the company's store in Fort Bragg.
I accordingly presented mycneck at the store
at Fort Bragg and In return received two re
ceipts, amounting to $6 and $1 90â that was
all I received for ray mouth's work. The com
pany only pays out a time check once in every
three months, and 'hen each man has to send
the same to San Francisco at his own expense,
and will have to wait for sixty more days be
fore he gets any returns. li he does not wish
to wait he can sell his check at Fort Bragg at
10 per cent discount on the dollar. All this is
not told you at the employment office, or that
you will have to wait five months lore you
get any pay, or that tho work is very danger
ous, and that many men get killed or crippled
every year. (I myself know of lour men get
ting seriously hurt, and one getting killed in
oue week.) .EKES '7""-7 '
Alter reading the letters Mr. Sanford
will say:
"In those protests it was said tbat my
bill was a good one and that all the mill
men wanted it passed. Yes; those com
panies are very likely to want such a law
enacted I .They want a law passed that
will prevent them from robbing; working
men I Why do they not do . justice to the
men without waiting to be compelled to
do so by law? If they are in favor ox such
a law why did tbey turn over heaven and
earth tryinc to, defeat me last fall?. Why
did they in some .instances even threaten
to turn men off if they voted for me?
Mill superintendents took particular pains
to ride my opponent all over the country
in a fine surrey and pleaded with the
working-men to vote for him.
"With all this opposition on the part of
the superintendents in those districts
where superintendents fought the hardest
against me my vote was the strongest, In
the seven precincts near Point Arena, my
home, where they did their utmost to de
feat me, I ran 107 votes ahead of William
J. Bryan, and taking the whole coast
through I ran nearly . 200 votes ahead of
my ticket, and had it not happened for
the fact that there was a United States
Senator to be elected I believe I would
have left the coast with over 600 votes
ahead of my. ticket. - '-. _â¢;Â« 1 . a -tut '4
"What is "the object of this protest? It
is simply to create a sentiment to defeat
the biil in the Senate." One of those men
who Is represented as protesting against
this bill is W. P. McFaul, one of the own
ers of the Hardy Creek Lumber Company,
which company pays off its men in checks
that could not be sold for 15 per cent, as I
discovered on my visit to Westport during
the last campaign. I found a number of
men in Westport who had checks of this
company, and they would have been will
ing to have sold them for almost any
thing. \
'.'The reason why laboring-men do not
say more about these things is because of
terrorism. They lear that they would be
discharged if they signed petitions for
relief." 7 . -. - * â â â -.â >
Mr. Sanford will also point out the fact
that in the communications published in
The Call last Sunday not one of the pro
tectants denied any of the charges he had
made with reference to the time checks
and the exorbitant rates charged by the

The patriotic celebrations, in this City
yesterday were both numerous and ex
cellent and it may well be doubted
whether any other city in the Union more
worthily observed the day.
Newark, N. J., is the latest city which
has the .â¢â¢greater" fever. She wishes to
annex suburbs enough to make a city of
500,000 inhabitants, so she can call herself
a metropolis and make faces at Boston.

One of the minor scandals, at Washing

important documents have been stolen
from the Congressional Library. The

while the lobby is glaring at Congress.
The surest way to avoid being involved
in a war with Spain over the treatment of

steps toward bringing the war to a close.

The New York Sun states that some of
the richest men in that city are utterly
unknown to the general public even by
name, as they take care to avoid anything
which would render them conspicuous or
get their names in tho paper..: Among,
these is a young bachelor who is heir to
more than 520,000,000. It is a rather rich
city where such Wealth is unnoted. -
HANNA FOR THE SENATE.
The announcement made by Governor Busbnell of Onio that he would at the
proper time appoint Marcus A. Hanna to succeed Senator Sherman as Senator from
Ohio is gratifying in a double respect. In the first place it assures the accession in
the Senate of one of the strongest and ablest men in the country to the Republican
side, and in the second place it makes evident that the Republican party will work in
harmony during the coming administration.
EÂ«*ch of these ings is in itself notable and will give satisfaction to the people.
Though he has had no long political experience, and none at all in office, Mark Hanna
has shown himself by his conduct of the McKinley campaign during the last year to
be one of the most successful managers of men in the Union. He entered the contest
as the captain of the McKinley forces, and though for a time he was opposed by such
able leaders as Speaker Re d, Piatt of New York, Quay of Pennsylvania and Clarkxon
of lowa, he successfully accomplished the task which he had undertaken, of attaining
the nomination of McKinley for the office of President by the Republican National
Convention, on the first ballot. He did this, moreover, without creating any hostility
or personal antagonism in th? minds of any of his opponents, and won his victory in
a way which made it a genuine triumph of judicious party management.
Having been chosen to conduct ibe Republican campaign during tbe canvass
which followed Mr. Hanna showed himself to be as Ecod a general in the broader flald
of an appeal to the whole people as he bad been in supporting the cause of his candi
date in the ranks of the Republican party. There can b/j no question that the cam
paign of 1896 on the Republican side was tbe best organized and most vigorously
conducted canvass known to our history. The results of the election attested the
efficiency of the party organization as well as the statesmanlike judgment shown in
selecting the tactics to be used during tbe canvass, and the arguments by which the
great measures advocated by the Republican party were upheld and sustained in the
discussions which followed in the press and from the stump.
During the course of the campaign Mr. Hanna was more bitterly assailed than
any other man who took part in it. He was caricatured with a grossness that in the
Examiner once or twice descended to absolute obscenity and indecency. He was re
viled and maligned in a thousand ways. Nevertheless through the whole course of
the fight he did not once turn aside to consider his personal interest in it or to make
any defense of himself against bis assailants. All his thoughts and all his energies
were devoted lo the one object of achieving an overwhelming victory for the Republi
can candidates. How completely he succeeded is now well known. The Democratic
and Populist fusion was absolutely routed, and the Republican candidates for the
Presidency and Vice- Presidency were elected by the most overwhelming vote in onr
history with the exception of that by which General Grant defeated Greeley.
The accession of such a man to the United States Senate is an important event not
only to the Republican parly, but to the country. We need just such men as be to
take- part in the great councils of the Nation and assist in shaping legislation for the
public welfare. Over and above the value of his selection to the office, however, there
is a further gratification in the fact that bis appointment means an end to what
threatened to be a Republican faction fight in Ohio.
It has been so often predicted by the Democrats that Senator Foraker and Gov
ernor Bushnell would oppose the McKinley wing of the Republican party that a con
siderable number of people began to believe there was some truth in the story, aud
that the administration would be weakened by antagonism among Republicans
in the Senate. This fear is now happily dispelled. There will be no stronger sup
porter of tbe administration in the Senate than Mr. Hanna, and the fact that he is to
be appointed by Governor Bushnell, who is known to be the firm friend of Senator
Foraker, gives assurance that the McKinley administration will be uniformly sup
ported in all its great measures for the welfare oi the people.
We had occasion a short time ago to call attention to an address made by Senator
elect Piatt of New York, in which that gentleman stated in the clearest and most
emphatic terms that he would support the McKinley administration with a genuine
loyalty. Tbat speech disposed of the Democratic charges that any portion of the
Republicans of New York would be hostile to the incoming administration. The
announcement now made by Governor Bushnell ends tbe stories of a faction fight in
Ohio. The outlook for a successful administration is therefore promising in every
respect. There is not this time a sign or symptom of discord in the Republican party.
We are to have a business administration conducted by men who know the needs of
the country, and who will promptly support every measure designed to remedy exist
ing evils and speed the coming of prosperity.
SWING THE VETO.
It is gratifying to note that public
opinion amply sustains The Call in de
nouncing the bill providing for the ap-
poin.ment in this City of a specialist in
sociological education. It is, indeed, a
subject on which there should be a perfect
accord among all who are interested in
education, in economy and in opposing
everything in the nature of a job to make
a place for some person at the expense of
the taxpayers.
We denounced the bill some days ago
when it had been adopted by the Senate.
Since then it has been passed by the As
sembly and is now in the hands of the
Governor. It should be vetoed at once.
San Francisco has no need whatever of
such an official and the taxpayers can ill
afford to pay his salary and costs of his
offlce. Money devoted to such a purpose
would be literally worse than thrown
away, for it would fasten upon the City
an official who would not only draw from
the treasury a large sum of money this
year but an equally large, if not a larger,
sum for years to" come. *
It is something of a surprise that such a
bill should have succeeded in passing both
houses of the Legislature. Theie is noth
ing in the nature of the measure itself to
recommend it. It has never been advo
cated by any considerable numb of peo
ple in this City. On the other hand, as
soon as attention was called to it it has
been denounced by those who have the
best means of knowing the needs of our
educational system. It seems on the face
of it to be a job of the worst description
and the people confidently count upon
the Governor to veto it.
THE RUIZ CASE
If we had any other President than
Grover Cleveland, or possibly if Cleve
land's term of office were not so soon to
close, it is probable tbe Ruiz case would
bring our relations with Spain and Cuba
to a crisis which would compel some
prompt and definite action within a com
paratively few days. From all reports
that are given out the case seems to have
been one of gross outrage, which fully
justifies the United States in demanding
speedy redress, from the Spanish Govern
ment. ___m\
It is asserted that Consul-General Lee
never at any time believed the story that Dr.
Ruiz had committed suicide in a Spanish
prison,* and that having compelled the
Spaniards to disinter the body for a post
mortem examination, evidence was found
which fully confirmed his suspicions. Act
ing upon this General Lee is reported to
have cabled Secretary Olney declaring that
the administration must uphold him in
his demand for the instant release of all
Americans imprisoned by the Spanish au
thorities in Cuba as political suspects or
that they be speedily given trials in open
court. It is further asserted that the Con
sul-General has notified tbe Secretary of
State that unless be is supported in these
demands he will resign.
It is not always certain that the papers
which pass between the Consul-General
and the State Department are fully re
ported or accurately digested. Some cau
tion has to be observed in basing conclu
sions upon such reports. It would seem,
however, in this case that the affair is so
simple in its nature and at the same time
so important there is hardly room for
any great mistake to be made. It is fair to
assume therefore that the Government at
Washington has taken decided steps to
protect Americans in Cuba and that Dr.
Ruiz by his death will have so aroused the
administration mat other Americans in
Cuba will either be secured in their lives
and their property or else we will be nearer
to a war with Spain than has seemed prob
able for some time past.
Tbe intensity of tne crisis will have its
influence upon the Cuban movement in
this City. It will afford a . reason why
prompt action should be taken here and,
indeed, throughout the United States.
There are many Americans in Cuba who
are now in dancer of the same (ate which
befell Dr. Ruiz, and the Government at
Washington should be supported by the

SAN JOAQOIN EDITOES.
The action of the newspaper editors of
the San Joaquin Valley in organizing a
pre-a association is a good step in the direc
tion of many reforms. It offers a means
of uniting the power of the press in that
valley and thus enabling the editors toco
operate and work more effectively toward
accomplishing every undertaking which in
their judgment is designed to advance
either the Interests of the press itself or
the whole valley.
The work which has been accomplished
by the press association of the Sacramento
Valley shows what can be done by such or
ganizations in all important sections of
the Stale. Thar* can be little question but
what the new association just lormed at
Fresno will prove itself a most potent aid
in developing the San Joaquin Valley, in
advancing every reform and improvement
which is needed there, and in making
known its manifold resources to all who
are seeking homes or a place for the in
vestment of capital.
The newly formed association contains in
its membership some of the brightest minds
and most energetic managers anion, the
newspaper men of the State. The officers
elected for the first year are notable men.

the first year's work of the association a
good and broad foundation on which to

We have had many occasions of late to
congratulate tne San Joaquin Valley.
Ever since the beginning of the work of
constructing the competing railroad
through that section there have been evi
dences of a determination on the part of
the people to profit by the new oppor
tunities which the competing road will
afford them. Enterprise has followed en
terprise, and from one end of the great
valley to the other there has ben mani
fest a vigorous activity among all classes
of citizens. The organization of the edit
ors of the valley into an association will
tend to promote all of these new under
takings, and this, therefore, is another
movement on Which people of the valley
may be rightly congratulated.
SHE !iELE-TED GAGE.
New York Mail and Express.
Lyman J. Gage, gentleman, philanthropist,
who is to be the next Secretary of * the Treas
ury, has stamped indelibly on his features the
benevolence which is a prominent trait in his
character. Ever since Mr. Gage was ln a finan
cial position where he could give, and give
generously, the recording angel has been kept
busy recording the good deeds of which even
those nearest and dearest to him often know
nothing. A little anecdote will serve as an
illustration of how his character has marked
his face. One .veninit during the year pre
vious io tbe Wortd's Fair, of which Mr. Gage
was first president and always a director, a so
cial party was assembled at the home of a
minor official of the fair. For the entertain
ment of the guests the dining-room table was
turned into a photograph gallery, on which
were displayed thirty or forty pictures of
prominent men connected with the different
departments. A woman from the East who
was present and who was familiar with only a
few of the faces, was asked to select the photo
graph which she thought represented the no
blest and truest character among them. She
chose that of Lyman J. Gage.
HOW 10 ReACH iHE POLE
; At a recent public dinner Lieutenant Peary
said that a man standing over the north pole
would have but one point to his compass, and
that would be south. Time would be un
known to him. He would know no night or
day. Experiences of Nansen and himself dur
ing the last three years, he said, had shown
that the Ideal part * to discover the pole must
consist of only two or three persons. The old
Idea of a larpe party must be abandoned. By
mc dern methods the pole could be reached
without any of the horrors of tne Franklin
and Greely expeditions. He considered that
the man who makes the discovery will rank
with Colambu*. The question as to what good
* would be to .uCh a man ta discover the pole
would be like asking what good was the
wreath at the Olympian games.* It would be a
tribute to endurance, eneigv, persistence, the
conquerinj of- obstacles. It would be the
peerless prize of the day end should go to an
American. It had become possible with all
the recent light on the subject, he said, for
him to advise and propose within the last
month a practical plÂ«n to gel there. There
were only 260 miles beyond thÂ» highest point
already reached to be travers<d. He thought
the only way to reach the pole would be to fol
low up Greenland, as it reaches t-ward the
pile. A certain tribe of Equimaux there
could be relied upon to lurnlsh assistance. , A
fund of $150,000 would keep such a small
I any a* he advised for ten years working
away, Under the arrangement be pro; osed,
he said, to reach the pole would be "entirely
practical."

Ex-Consul-General W. D. Tillotson of Japan,

coast from Japan over a year ago and located
at Redding, where he is engaged in practicing
law. Â«_. 1: . v ... -. ~_,
General Tillotson says many things are
under way In and about Redding to make
that section very prosperous. There is an un
usual amount ot work going on in the mines.
"Shasta County promises soon to become one
of the liveliest mining counties 0:1 the coast,"
he said. "For several years times have been
dull there owing to the shutting down of the
placer mines. Mow, however, people are turn
ing their attention to tne development of the
vast deposits oi low grade and base ore lying
EX.CONSUL-GENERAL W. D. TILLOTSON of Japan, Now of Redding, Who Tells
of the Development of Shasta County Mines.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.
within that district, and so far the results arc
all that could be desired.
"Foremost among Shasta County's entert
prises at the present time is the plant of the
Mountain Copper Company. Limited, an Eng
lish syndicate of very large capital, located at
Keswick, seven miles northwest of Redding.
This company is working the celebrated Iron
Mountain mine and it is already treating 500
tons of ore each day, and I understand that it
is intended to increase the capacity in the
near future to 1400 tonaper day.
"The ore is brought from the mine to Kes
wick over the company's own railroad and
treated in roasters before being passed through
the furnaces. About 500 men are employed
by this company, which number is being added
to dally. . >7. :iiii/cy. ;, <
. "A furnace has been erected by Mr. Enright
at the After the Right mine, which is said to
be a success, and it is announced that work
will be resumed on that property early in the
spring. ;|k'VvC
"There are quite a number of large properties
near Redding undeveloped as yet, that will,
from all appearances, bring a rich reward to
the capitalists fortunate enough to secure
them.
"At this time there is apparently but one
condition retarding the development of Shasta
County, and that is the tendency on the part
of owners of the large low-grade properties to
hold them at too high a price. They do not
seem to realize the enormous capital required
to properly develop them, and that they must
give the man of capital a chance to share the
profits or their properties will lie idle until
they themselves have passed off the stage of
life.
"Some, however, are beginning to look at
the matter ln the proper light, and are in
clined to take a little now, rather than to
wait until too late to do them any good, and
the prospects indicate that in tho near future
Shasta County will be known as the land of
smelters. JjJt.J
"since the establishment of the smelter at
Keswick many small quartz ledges are being
developed where the ore is of a quality to
make it valuable for flux, which ls another
element tending to enliven the mining busi
ness of that county, and through the market
furnished by the smelter for fluxing . ores
many men are enabled to work claims which
otherwise would lie idle.
"It seems to me that the prospects for the
entire State are of the brightest hue. Tne
weather conditions presage an abundant har
vest and we have reason to believe that prices
will be better than for come years, and with
the great mining activity I see no reason why
the State should not advance all along the
line." ' " " -';--.*.;Â«y.V

Letters From the People.
QUIT TALKING SILVER.
Be Hare a Xational Flag and Want a
Money Like It.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ -Sir:
Let me celebrate Washington's, birthday by
writing The Call a letter on a National money.
Men who are free to think, because ' unbiased
by personal interests or political prejudices,
are rapidly reaching common ground on the
money question, and scientific money Is this
common ground. Like Government bonds, It
will be based upon the entire resources of the
country, including gold and silver, as well as
houses and lands, horses and cattle, and all
products of Industry, with the additional
value of all the valor and patriotism of ihe
Nation, backed by the army and navy, upheld
in honor and authority Just as our National
flag. It will not be a dependent promise to
pay, but an abs lute money, receivable for all
dues and debts, both public and private, and
will be the only full legal tender. All other
forms of paper currency to be abolished, j bold
and silver will be limited legal der, tut
may be redeemed iv the National paper
money. A fluctuating part will then no longer
be by law greater than the staple whole.
National credit, now used ln th. form of
bonds for the benefit of , men who deal in
money as bankers and capitalists, will take
tbe place of banker.' credit -ased upon a few
National bends, for National credit will be
based upon * all property, Including the
bankers' own capital. Checks and drafts will
be used as now, but they will be In tho (orm of
postal orders for any sum. issued as bank
cheeks and drafts now are. for then the
bankers will not control the Government
postal money-order department, as they now
do, to limit the amount to be transmitted and
to render it as Inconvenient and expensive as
possible. In fact, postal orders may then be
Issued payable t.i bearer, and they may circu
late as fractional currency at tbe option of the
holder.
This scientific National money will settle
the "silver agitation" and the gold standard,
too. In time, both metals will practically go
out of use as money. Gold will at once* take
its place beside silver as a form of token
money, and will cease to vex the Nation and
oppress the industries of the country. Most
men now know that outside of California gola
Is seldom used in business transactions,
checks end paper money being almost
exclusively " employed. Even in settling
foreign balances of trade, that is. the differ
ences in the exchange of products, crude or
manufactured, gold is not now used as money,
but as a commodity, and it Is thus used only to
a limited extent, "bills of exchange serving
the purpose better than go.d. Scientific
National money will not disturb or check this
foreign trad *.
A scientific National paper money would not
appreciate as gold or depreciate as silver, but
would remain as stable and free from fluctua
tion as the Government iiselt, with its wealth
and resources. This money, like the stars and
stripes, would become a symbol of the Nation's
sovereignty, dignity, honor, authority,
prowess and power. It would be regulated as
the National revenues are now adjusted to the
needs of the country. Panics would never oc-
cur. Contraction would not be tolerated. Ex
pansion would be limited to the actual re
quirements of business
Under a rational financial system, such a
here proposed, inflation is impossible beyond
the absolute needs of trade and industry.
People are strangely fooled by the cry of infla
tion. It :s raised by one small class of menâ
indeed, a very small classâ the men who deal
in money as a business, but mainly as money
lenders. True, it is sadly true," this small
class of men now own and control nearly all
the great newspapers and magazines, as every
body knows, and they can ins-antlv raise a
clamor from Maine to California over
inflation, which immediately alarms the
fool people, and more especially the
budness men, as they modestly call" them
selves, who claim to understand the laws of
finance because they buy the ducts of other
men's industry as cheap as they can, and sell
them to consumers as deir as they can, and so
a.c "business men"; whereas they ought to
know that, with the adoption of a scientific
National money, business would never be dis
turbed as now by inflation or contraction at
the will of money-dealers, but would always
he elastic and respond at once in a rational
and natural manner to the demands of trade
and industry, as less or more money may be
needed. Inflation Is a bankers' raw-head and
bloody-bones with which they scare financial
ignorance. -*'. 7.'
States, counties and municipalities may ob
tain this National money from the Govern
ment on their bonds without interest for a
term of twenty-five years for public improve
ments and utilities, 4 per cent of the loan to
be repaid to the Government annually and
canceled; provided, tbat the bonds so issued
by Slates, counties and municipalities shall
not exceed 25 per centum of the assessed
value of property within said States, counties
and municipalities. That will close up and
end the business of the usurer, the most dan
gerous foe to human progress.

A Stamp Cut in Twoâ Philatelist. City. If
the story following, which you inclosed as a

that some one in the postal department in the
city of New York was negligent as to his du
ties, for the stamp was mutilated, and Uncle
Sam will not recognize such mutilation:
At a business office in this city tne other day a
five-cent a. amp was needed for a certain purpose,
It was not forthcoming, and one of the clerks sug
gested tbat a ten-cent stamp cut in two would
answer the purpose. His suggestion waalaoghel
at. but he .tuck to his assertion, and it was finally*
agreed to put. the matter to ihe test. Accordingly
two envelopes were addressed to one of ih<> voud?

of 256 squares. Two or four persons can P*'*?t
the social game and one may 'enjoy the soll

thirteen squares is inclosed by a dotted red
line. These yards are used when four persons
play, ln two corners a heavy red line incloses
six additional squares, forming yards of nine
teen squares each, to be used when but two
persons play. In progressive halma tables
are numbered and sides are chosen as in pro
gressive euchre, but Instead of all waiting for
the head table to finish the game the players
at all the tables have an equal chance. In th_
four corners of the progressive nalma board a
yard of ten golden squares is marked off. The
corners of the board are lettered, A and Al are
partners and B and Bl are their opponents.
Ten men are used by each player, and the
object is for the player to transfer his or her
men into the opposite yard. The player who
first wins the game at any table blows a
whistle, when play instantly stops at all the
tables. The winner with his or her partner
then advances to the next table, when all
must change partners. The side which is
ahead at other tables also progresses. Prizes
are awarded for progression instead of remain
ing at the head of table as in progressive
euchre.

"Of course, the most stirring news must

The Salvation Army Opens
Its New Institute for
Workingmen.
Free Labor Bureau, Night School,
Library, Reading- Room and
Dispensary.
The New Social Secretaries Installed
in OJfic âStreet Parade and
Fireworks.
Yesterday was a great day in the history
of the Salvation Army in this City.
Patriotic demonstration in celebration
of Washington's Birthday was mingled
with jubilation over the openingand dedi
cation of the Salvation Army Institute for
workingmen.
A street parade followed the dedication,
in which a number of attractive floats ap
peared, and the Salvationists were dressed
in fancy and representative costumes.
Several banners were carried in the ranks
inscribed "We want work" â the demon
stration being a plea for the unemployed
in connection with the institute. .
At Congress Hall, at the Salvation
Army headquarters on Market street, a
unique entertainment took place, being
an allegorical representation of an anction
sale of children.
In the evening another street parade
took place with an illemination. It
wound up at Metropolitan Temple, where
another big demonstration was held, the
feature of which was the installation of
Major and Mrs. Winchell as social secre
taries of the social wing of the army for
the Pacific Coast division. Pictures taken
from the social work were shown from a
stereopticoc.
The institute was dedicated in the morn
ing. It is located on the cortier of New
Montgomery and Howard streets. It has
been in operation for a month past supply
ing beds at 5 and 10 cents a night. It is
equipped with 150 oeds, to be let nightly
at 5 cents each, 100 other beds with lock
ers and extra bed-clothing at 10 cents;
thirty single bedrooms with writing-table
and washstand at 15 cents; together with
a number of furnished rooms at 25 cents
The plan contemplated that the institute
will be a rendezvous for tbe unemployed.
A free labor bureau is to be established
here, a "woodyard and window and step
cleaning company," organized; a night
school established, with a library and
reading-room; a free medical dispensary;
a barber-sbop, bathroom, a restaurant
and lunchroom and a laundry are to be
added.
It is stated in this connection that an
interstate labor bureau is being estab
lished by Commander Booth-Tucker, all
over the United States, and agencies are
to be established all through this State.
The dispensary is in c arge ol well
known city physicians, among them : Dr.
D. B. Ply mire". Dr. H. C. French, Dr. X.
Rodgers, Dr. J. Anderson and T. B. de
Wilt-
The ceremony of dedication was con
ducted by Lieutenant-Colonel Keppel.
He introduced A. S. Hemphill of C- vary
Church, who made an enthusiastic ad
dress in support of the work of the army.
He .aid he was ''lor the army every
time."
"It is nothing to stand up for the army
now," said Dr. Hemphill, "but I stood
with them in the streets twenty years ago
when they were greeted most of the time
by dead cats and eggs. It has been my
high privilege to re cuke those who have
sneered at the workers in the army."
Dr. Hemphill said that he was pastor of
a big and rich church, but he found it
difficult to secure funds to meet its ex
penses ana carry on its work. The, Salva
tion Army had always been a mystery to
him, he said. How it had progressed
from small and despised beginnings and
gone forward to the establishment one
after the other of self-supporting institu
tions for the relief and succor of man -
kindâhalf a dozen of them that bad each
accomplished great work in themselves
and the army kepi growing and establish*
ing still other and greater institutions
tbat bid fair to nourish and continue the
work â it was a mystery to him how it was
accomplished.
Dr. H. C. French was introduced as rep
resenting the physicians who will have
charge of the di-pensary. He said "the
world is sick." He thought that Use word
of God was the greatest remedy, but be
(Dr. French) stood prepared to alleviate
their suffering so far as he could with
physic. He said thai the Salvation Army
in its social institutions has given the lie
to the agnostics of the world. He advised
those present to tell whatever poor neigh
bors they may have to come to the insti
tute in caso they needed medical treat
ment for which they were unable to pay.
Major Winchell stated that a committee
of tbe Y. M. 1. had visited him' and offered
the army the use of the decorations at
Metropolitan Temple which the Y. M. I.
hurt placed there for its afternoon enter
tainment.
A volley was fired for the Y. M. I. and
the courtesy was accepted with applause.
Adjutant Montgomery, "the million
sire Salvationist," in a short address said
that he was glad that he bad bad time to
investigate tbe Salvation Army and its
methods. In tbat investigation* he had
looked behind the curtains, and it had
stood tbe test. It had been the means of
turning him to a life of usefulness. He
had seen the Salvationists swallowed up
in their work for their fellowmen, and he
bad found joy in joining them.
Lieutenant - Colonel Keppel offered a
final prayer and benediction upon the
dedication, and tbe services closed with a
great volley for the institute.
Shortly after 1 o'clock in the afternoon
the parade formed on Howard and New
Montgomery street, in front of the insti
tute. ' Floats representing "the cherry
tree" and "the old log cabin," and others
carrying the army lassies, in red, white and
blue, were in the line. Bells and brass
horns awakened the echoes all along the
line of march. The Chinese corps of the
juniors, a band of gayly dre-sed little
Celestials, attracted much attention.
Congress Hall was crowded by the lime
the head of the procession reached there.
The little children, 100 of them,' were
given places on tbe stage and presented a
pretty picture. After a short musical and
literary programme, among the numbers
of which was the sin. ing of the baby
Chinese, the whole band was offered for
sale by Major Winchell, social secretary,
in the capacity of an auctioneer. First
Pleasure bid for them â¢ (in the person of
Ensign W. S. Barker); then Wealth 'Cap
tain Isabella Wise); then Education (Mrs.
Adjutant George S. Montgomery); then
Morality (Ensign N. J. Lewis.) None of
them were high enough, according to the
auctioneer, because they only pretended
to care of the bodies of the littleones, and
their care could not extend beyond this
life. Then Christianity bid, in the person
of the auctioneer's wife, Mrs. Winchell,
and to ber tbey were sold, as she was able
to care lor their souls in the after life us
well as for their bodies and souls in this.
It was a very pretty entertainment.
In the evening the parade, with red
lights and firework?, started from "White
Wings" Hall, Mission street, near Third,
at 7 o'clock. It traversed the principal
streets and broke ranks in front of Metro
politan Temple. ~
The temple was crowded at the begin

ning of the entertainment, which was
characterized throughout by the en
thusiastic "volleys" of the Salvation
Army. It began with a running talk on
the social work of the army,' illustrated
,by stereopticon pictures. **
The entry of Lieutenant-Colonel and
Mrs. Keppel, Major and Mrs. Winchell.
with musicians and their following at 8
o'clock, was the signal for an outbust.
Major and Mrs. Winchell were formally
installed as social secretaries.
Ensign Lewis sang "We'll be well fed
and have a bed," and in response to the
encore explained the uses of the "mercy
box." The first public exhibition of the
army's new adjunct, "the grapbophone
as a missionary and nickel collector," was
illustrated with son us and speech.
Some spectacular object- lessons of
the army's work among the poor were
shown with telling effect. The entertain
ment closed with the singing of "Amer
ica."
CHINESE BURGLAR.
Ah Poo Has Two Charges Booked
Against Him at the City
Prison.
Ah Poo, a Chinese ex-convict, was
booked at the City Prison yesterday morn
ing by Policeman L. C. Clark and De
tective Harry Reynolds on two charges of
burglary. , v . - '.Â£
For some months the establishment of
Mrs. Bowhay, ladies' tailor, 501 Sutter
street, has been periodically visited by
thieves and portions of the stock stolen.
On the night of December 25 a valuable
seal-kin sacque, a quantity of silk, $5 in
coin and several articles of jewelry were
stolen. Previous to this the thefts had
been trifling, but such a big steal com-

Assembly of the League of American Wheelmen.
pelled Mrs. Bowhay to report the matter
to the police, and Detective Reynolds was
detailed on the case.
Nothing more was taken till Tuesday
night, when Policeman Clark saw AhPoo
leaving tbe premises with a large bundle
under his arm. He arrested him, and on
opening the bundle found it contained
a bout $500 worth of silks. Ah Poo told the
officer that some man bad left the bundle
.here and bad asked him to call for it.
Detective Reynolds ascertained that Ah
Poo was formerly emnloyed by Mrs. Bow
bay. He had entered the premises by
climbing a fence in the rear and sliding
down a rope through a ventilator. He
had used some of the silks stolen on De
cember 25 to line bis underclothing.
Ah Poo is an old offender. On June 14,
1882, as Ah Poe, he was sent to Ban Quen
tiu for three years lor burglary in San
Joaquin County, and on April 8, 1887, as
Ng Ah Pngb, he was sentenced to eight
years for burglary in this City.
SOLDIEES' TEAM DEFEATED.
A Picked Nine With an Innocent Name
Humbles Presidio Pride.
The soldiers- baseball team from the
Presidio was defeated yesterday afternoon
at Central Pari, by a nine nominally made
up of employes of the California market,
but really a picked team, including much
of the available professional and experi
enced talent of the City.
The score was 8 to 1, but the teams were
very nearly matched. Wheeler, who
pitched the last few innings for the sol
diers, showed form that might have saved
tbe blueboatt tbe game had it been used
from tbe start. Amonr- the few brilliant
plays was a pretty right-hand stop by
Lanigan of a high liner that he took in
time to. double up on a soldier stealing
from second. About COO persons were
present. Many of -hem lingered on the
grounds after the game, hoping that a big
hot-air balloon ana a pendant airship with
an advertising notice attached rai.ht
finally be made to raise, but they wen
disappointed. The big balloon would
only swell out slowly and barely maintain
a rotund form.

SOUR, SELFISH
AND NARROW
Attitude of Eastern Wheel
men Toward Western
Brethren.
Return of R. M. Welch From
the National L. A. W.
Assembly. *
What He Thinks and What He Says
of the Delegates He
Met.
Robert M. Weich, a member of the
National racing board of the League of
American Wheelmen and one of the dele
gates from the North California division
to the National assembly of the league
recently hela at Albany, N. V.. returned
last evening. He was met at the Six
teenth-street station, Oakland, by a num
, ber of his friends prominent in local
wheeling interests, and representatives
from the different papers.
As is pretty generally known the pur
pose of tbe North California division in
sending its delegates East was to secure
an amendment to the racing rules provid
ing for divisional option on the question
of Sunday racing, that is, that each State
should have the right to decide for itself
whether or not it would sanction cycle
racing on Sunday. This division was en
titled to seven delegates, two of whom,
Mr. Welch and Judge Frank H. Kerrigan,
went in person, carrying the proxies of
the other five. In New York City th-y
met Frank W. Fuller, who accepted a
proxy, went with them to Albany and
materially assisted in the work.
Mr. Welch felt rather tired on his return
last night, but said to a CaLl reporter tbat
he was glad to be home and among his
friends once more, and to have an oppor
tunity to express himself on the L. A W.
. "We went there," be said, "expecting
that we were going to. at least a quasi
fraternal association, to deal with a lot of
fair, generous men. We found them sour,
selfish and narrow-minded. We received
absolutely no courtesies from any of them,
and, accustomed as we were to the warm
hearted hospitality of Californians, the
surprise was roost complete.
"To "bow you bow little sympathy the
L. A. W. has for its racing interestsâ
the time we were discussing the admission
of professionals to membership, which
was defeated, by the way, and the argu
ment was made that we controlled them
and yet allowed tbem no representation,
the reply was that we did not ask them
to come tons, they sought us and asked
for, our protection. If tbey don't like
what they get, let them get down and out.
"During the argument on Sunoay rac
ing one man from Louisiana was telling
bow badly they needed it there; tnat
meets were only .held on Saturdays or
holidays and tracks were a financial loss
or had to be abandoned entirely. I saw
and heard men in that assembly nudge
each other and say they were glad to
hear it.
"As a matter of course, the L. A. W.
does not care a snap for racing. It's hue
and-cry is good roads; and yet that is tbe
biggest farce in tbe world. There is abso
lutely no Interest in it and the L. A. W. is
not creating any. I saw that man Potter
I presiding at a good roads meeting nt
Albany and listened to some crank tell
bow you could put down cloth and lay
asphalt or macadam on it and make a
splendid road. The good roads banquet
was a farce. There was to be a night ses
sion of tbe Good Roads Congress, so the
members ot the legislature could attend.
Well, I believe there were six people
present, newspaper men included. It was
an awful lizzie. Nobody of any import
ance took any notice of it. The league
gets its prestige and its name from its
racing interests, tbe very thing those
shortsighted Easterners are trying to
down.
"Now, the position I take is just this:
At present we cannot do much, although
Illinois, Missouri, Colorado and ail the
Western States, save and except that little
South California' division, are only wait
ing for us to take the initiative and tbey
will follow. But there must be some or
ganization, some bead to it, and- who is
going to take it? There must be somebody
of character and energy to take hold of it,
and the trouble is those who have been
doing the most talking have no standing.
"What 1 suggest is that we first wait
and see. what action the executive com
mittee takes at its met ting in New York
to-morrow. Kerrigan is there and will
ask them to instruct the racing board not
to suspend any rider* who race in Califor
nia on Sunday. If they agree to this our
point is partly gained and we can struggle
along for a while longer. If not it is time
to call a meeting of the local board of offi
cers and discuss what action is to be taken.
"If tbe racing board gets into shape and
a . circuit . is . arranged â¢to start from here,
and many Eastern riders come here, per
haps it would be best to wait until they
have gone. Our tracks cannot exist as
they are, however. They must promote
Sunday racing to pay even expense?. If
the executive committee permits it all
discontent will be allayed and we will
have no immediate grievance. Otherwise
the tracks will promote it anyway, and
there will be plenty of men who will ride.
Who of our California boys will co East
this year? Probably only Ziegler,
McFarland, Wells and "Bob" Terrill.
Sunday racing for plethoric purses may.
keep them hero to say nothing of attract
ing the Eastern cracks.
"I don't believe there will be much of
this so-called circuit racing this year. I
don't believe the manufacturers are going
to support teams. I heard Tom Eck dis
cussing it at the New York show. He said
he thought there were only about twelve
men signed so far. And there are 1900
professionals in America, whom the league
felt itself too good to admit to member
ship. With no teams or circuits what are
these men going to do? I think, with
frequent opportunities fcr racing here and
good purses, we will attract a large num
ber of them. I imagine Sunday racing
will develop new men fast, too. We are
really in a better position to start out lor
ourselves than any other State.
"The only reason for California adher
ing to the league is for our racing interests.
If we cut loose in that regard nothing re
mains. In what manner did the East as
sist in the passage of our baggage bill?
It was by our own individual efforts. We
could have got it under any other name
besides the L. A.W. with the same efforts.
And this applies to our roadbook and
everything else. Everything is done by
the divisions, and yet we turnover one
third of our dues to the home olhce which
helps to pay fat salaries to a favored few."
Continuing, Mr. Welch, talked very
rapidly as he enthused 'to his subject.
He said the racing interests of the league
just now were badly demoralized. Mr.
Gideon would not accept reappointment
as chairman of the racing board, and he
himself would no longer represent it in
California unless Sunday racing be per
mitted, i Mr. Croninger of Kentucky
would probably be the only incumbent
reappointed. A. G. Batcneider of New
York was a likely candidate for chairman.
Mr. Welch said Gideon had been an ex
ceedingly fair and impartial man, gentle
manly and popular, who ruled with a rod
of iron, yet was admired and respected.
He compared him with George H. Strat
ton, late chairman of Associated Cycling
Clubs' racing board of this State. Of
ex-President Elliott of Boston he could
not say too much. He was a splendid
man and deserved re-election. But he
was a victim of the questionable politics
of the New York division and was turned
down for Potter.
Monahan, the chief consul of the South
California division, stood .in with the
Potterites and fought the Sunday-racing
proposition tooth and nail. He was very
unpopular with the delegates, but
could be utilized to good advantage, and
they made the most of him.
Mr. Welch said both he and Mr. Ker
rigan were thoroughly disgusted. They
had given several years to the work of the
league in this State and felt they had
accomplished much good for its members
here. He says Kerrigan is all broken up
over the result and of their treatment
there, and does not feel that he can come
back here and do any more.
The Potterites promised their support
to California and to every one else who
wanted anything at the assembly in re
turn lor the election of the Potter ticket
This ticket went through with the excep
tion of the treasurer. And then the fall
came. Delegation after delegation was
turned down, California included. Ot
course New York with the liity-six dele
gates, whose vote Potter held in the palm
of his hand, so to speak, had practically
the control of everything, and Potter
broke his promises fa-<ter even than be
made them, eager as he was. Massachu
setts. Illinois, the South and in** West, all
have grievances, and they will not be
easily assuaged. Some of the methods
employed at that assembly would make a
ward politician turn green with envy and
put Tammany Itself to shame.
"We had an agreeable trip both going
and coming." Mr. We. concluded.. "It
snowed a little in New York and also at
Albany the morning of the day our Sun
day racing proposition came up. It was a
Friday and I remarked something about
superstition to Judge Kerrigan at break
fast. The Judge was pretty glum then,
for our defeat was foreshadowed by tne
turn of events of the previous day, but his
usual wittiness asserted itself and be said
it would be a cold day if we got left and
it was."
Mr. Welch returned alone. Mr. Fuller
stopped off at Chicago and Judge Kerrigan
is still in New York. B th will be home
in the course of the next ten days and
their return will signal something startling

League of American Wheelmen.

Entertain Fifty
Guests.
The Little Hatchet and the Cherry

Clinging Ivy Vines From Washington's
Grave Twined Round the
Menu Cards.
In no world more than in that sphere
where pleasure rules supreme does nov
elty make a leader and create a following.
In spite of this undeniable fact for
some time past it has appeared as though
society had exhausted all tbe resources
for the creation of the new, and it remained
for Mr. and Mrs. I. W. Hellman to present
to the devotees of fashion an entertain
ment at once patriotic, unique and
original.
â¢ This entertainment was nothing more
nor less than a colonial dinner to cele
brate the birthday of Washington.
The history of the father of his country
and that of the cherry tree are so closely
allied that it was most natural that the
decorations should consist entirely of
cherry blossom.. Neither was the historic
little hatchet missing, but was found
deeply imbedded in the cherry bark that
nestled in the midst of much floral love
liness. Tbe menu cards were an inspira
tionâeach course was marked by some bit
of wisdom of the first President, and the
card was tied to a tiny piece of cherry bark
and trimmed round with ivy that bad
been brought from the last resting-place
of Washington.
Mrs. Hellman and Mi-. Hellman, at
tired in- colonial gowns, received the
guests, fifty in number.
Three round tables were used and an
elaborate menu discussed. During the
service of the dinner there was music,
patriotic airs, of course, being shown
preference.

Impressive Ceremonies in
the New Temple at
Los Angeles.
4 Scottish Rite Lodge Takes Pos
session of Its Splendid
Quarters.
Praises Showered Upon the Men Who
Labored for the Building of
tbe Edifice.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 22.â One
year ago to-day an event of great moment
to the local Masonic fraternity took place
in Los Angeles., This was the laying of
the cornerstone of the splendid temple
which now adorns the west side of Hill
.street, between Fourth and Fifth. The
grand officers of California were present
and conducted the ceremonies.
The elegant building, with the lot, cost
about $60,000. It was formally opened on
' December 28 last. It is planned for five
stories, three of which are completed and
now partiaily occupied. On the second
floor are rive Blue Lodge rooms, three of
which are now in use. Then there is one
of the most elegant dance halls in the
State, a banquet hail and a room for the
Eastern Star. The ladies of this order
dedicated their hall last Saturday with a
banquet and dance.
On the third floor are two capacious and
elaborately equipped rooms for the chap
ter and commandery and the Scottish Rite
lodge. The latter of these has been occu
pied this week in dedicating its hall in
the most imposing manner. Following
the dedicatory exercises and lectures a
banquet was spread. The grand officers
of this lodge had charge of the ceremonies
and of course participated in the subse
quent festivities. The commandery will
soon dedicate its hall, which will com
plete the dedicatory services in this great
temple of the south.
The officers of the Masonic Temple Asso
ciation are: Hervey Lindley, president;
Judge S. J. Beck, vice-president; Niles
Pease, treasurer; Julius H. Martin, secre
tary, and the board of directors includes
those four, with James Cuzner.George Sin
fabaugb, George Varcoe, Frank Rader and
Jolm E. Jackson, lately deceased. These
men are well enough known in the com
munity without any special reference to
their qualifications for the duties they
have undertaken and performed.
The construction of this temple was un
dertaken at tne tequest of Hervey Lindley
while eminent commander of Ccenr de
Leon Commandery. On the evening
Wip.n the suggestion was made $8000
worth of stock was subscribed, which
started the enterprise. From that time
on the officers and the bo-trd have labored
diligently and raised $50,000, and built,
furnished and equipped the temple so that
now, as they are beginning to occupy the
premises, they have a home of their own
ail paid for â something unusual in the
construction of a building of a public
character; but the proposition from the
start was to build, equip and own the
premises free of incumbrance.
Judge S. J. Beck is a retired capitalist,
having been a resident of this city for a
longtime. He was at one time president
of the City Council, and has occupied dur

ing his life various official positions of re
sponsibility, in all of which he has ac
quitted himself with great credit and with
the entire approval of the people whom he
has represented. He has been an enthu
siastic supporter of the work of building
the temple, and has devoted a great deal
of time and energyto that end, his bard
common sense and business capacity con
tributing largely to the success.
Niles Pease is one of the leading mer
chants of the city, of irreproachable char
acter and sound business judgment, whose
standing in the community is ' equal to
that of any one, and who has officially oc
cupied the most important positions in
the Masonic fraternity. He has been one
of the prime movers in this enterprise
which has been so successfully accom
plished. His energy and diligence have
been of great service.
Julius H. Martin is the present candi
date for Mayor of the city of Los Angeles
on the Republican ticket.. He has been
secretary of the corporation from the start
J and has been untiring in his efforts in
collecting the money and attending to
various duties incumbent upon him in his
official position. His character and stand
ing and well-known honesty of purpose
have been of great assistance. 7
James Cuzner of the Kerckhoff-Cuzner
Mill and Lumber Company has been a di
rector from tbe start an 1 constant in his
attention upon the duties incumbent upon
him in his official capacity, and ail who
know him and his devotion to. any enter
prise with which he is connected Know
how faithfully and well he has worked.
George Sinsabaugh, while he was not a
director the first year, having succeeded
Professor Innes, who was a director dur
ing the first year of the corporation, has
rendered valuable service and by his en
ergy has contributed largely to the success
of the work during the present year, as
did Professor Innes during the year pre
ceding.
George Vanoe, the efficient . deputy
County Clerk, has been on the board from
the beginning and has been untiring in
his efforts and what he has done has been
well directed.
Frank Rader, the present commander of
Los Angeles Commandery No. 9, also
Mayor of the city of Los Angeles, has

more hours in connection*with the worn

gret very much his recent death. Ke will
not only be missed as an active, intelli
gent and working member of the board,
but as a Mason in high standing and of
high character4fmong Masons.
Hervev Lindley, tbe president of the
association, is one of the best-known per
sonages in California. He is a man of
affairs, of great ability and of unquestion
able weight in tho community. He has
been a highly successful business man,
and many people look upon him in poli
tics as the coming Tom Piatt of Cali
fornia. He is public spirited and enter
prising to the last degree, and no worthy
object or project is without his helping
nand. He was the soul of the building
committee, and to his unflinching perse
verance and energy undoubtedly much of
the success of the association is due.
The work connected with the raising of
the money and the building and equip
ping of this institution done by this board
during the "hard" times has been a great
deal more than persons who have not been
closely connected with it can imagine, but
the entire board has devoted itself to it
with snch constancy and energy as to
have brought about a successful result,
and one of the greatest pleasure * con
nected with the affair is the fact that
while the building is now occupied by ten
different Masonic bodies there 13 not a
word of fault found nor criticism rendered
by any of them. In fact, the board has
been backed at every step by the united
support of the entire Masonic fraternity.

canaigre land to come into good bearing,
and a factory will be erected later on for

haps there will also be a tannery on tbe
grounds. â¢,.-â¢*.-
Next week all of the members of tbe
company are expect. d to make a visit to
their purchase. The managers are ex
perienced men from Chicago, and the
moneyed men or backers are from Eng
land and Scotland. It is thought the
company will expend $1,000,000 on the
tract in improving the grounds, putting
up buildings and* developing water. The
trolley-car line from Rialto to San Ber

chise has been granted, is among the im
mediate possibilities.
PATRIOTISM WAS LACKING.
Washington's Birthday Pqsses as Any
Other Day in the City of the
Angels. i
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 22.â Except
for the presence of a large number of gayly
garbed college students in this city, the
blare of the tally-ho horn and the fact
that the banks and public offices were
closed a casual observer would never have
su.pected that patriotic Americans had
set apart this day to do honor to the Na
tion's hero who was "First in war, first in
peace and first in the hearts of his coun
trymen." It Was a sort of repetition of
St. Valentine's day. Few flags were flying
and none of the clubs and few of the other
social organizations did anything toward
observing the day.
The Jack of enthusiasm in the various
patriotic institutions has been particu
larly marked. The patriotism that re
cently wen t out to Gomez seems exhausted
completely, and left nothing for Wash
ington, the man to whose name Napoleon
doffed his hat and before whom Corn
wallis made genuflections. In many of
the stores business went as usual all day.
Some enterprising fellows brought in a
load, of, snow from Mount Lowe and
amused themselves with creating a sens
ation by letting people of the city dabble
a little in tbe strange substance. It was a
delightful treat to many who have not
â  had the privilege since coming -to this
land of sunshine. â¢...--.

STOCKTON, Cal.. Feb. 22.â A1l Stock
ton is talking to-night about the latest
sensation in social circles. William
Beresford and A. F. Naher, both of whom
are lions of local society, were the princi
pals in a lively affray in front of the Im
perial Hotel last evening. Mr. Naher
attacked Mr. Beresford, knocking him
down with a right-hander such as Carson

bett and Fitzsimmons do scrap there.
Mr. Beresford held a cane in bis band and
he brought the stick down upon Naher's
forearm, and then there was a mix-up.
Beresford was knocked into the cutter.
Naher appeared to be very wroth and be
landed bis fists right and left on the oppo
nent. He then lifted Beresford up and
administered several kicks to him. . Naher
started in to do more drubbing, but Beres
ford called upon spectators to check the
angry liquor-dealer and Naber was pulled
away.
Beresford picked himself . out of the
mud, and as he arose he made a remark
which aroused Naher again and the latter
started after him once more. This time
the two mixed up in the mud in the mid
dle of the street, and they had it hot and
heavy. Naher bad the better of the round
in the mud, as be bad of the whole en
counter. .
â¢ Tnere are two stories as to the occur
rences that lead to the hostilities. This
much is admitted by both persons: Mr.
Naner and Mr. Beresford had been'friends
up to about three months ago. Tbey
moved in the same society, attended the
same social functions and had rooms
at the same placeâ the Bud J House. " Mr.
and Mrs. Naher then took apartments in
the Imperial Hotel, and shortly after that
Mr. Naher asked his friend, Mr. Beresford,
to take dinner with him at the Imperial.
The invitation was accepted and the two
entered the lobby of the hostelry one Sun
day afternoon. Naher, in a spirit of fun,
went to the register and proceeded to reg
ister himself and guest- In registering
Mr. Beresford be wrote "Lord de la Poer
Beresford." Mr.' Beresford took umbrage
at the attempt to "josh" him, and, wetting
his forefinger, he blurred the fresh ink so
that the writing could not be read.:77;
"I thought you were a gentleman," said
Naher, taking offense at Beresford for
having blurred his name on the register.
With that Naher entered the elevator
and ordered the boy to take him to his
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
room. Beresford attempted to follow bim
into the cage, bnt Naher had' the door
closed against him. * To the remark, "I
thought you were a gentleman," Beres
ford had reported, ''Oh, are you* able to
judge?" p. â ' '"7 7 ;
They did not dine together that day,
which coldness marked the beginning of
a feud, which resulted in the memorable
encounter of last evening.
The immediate trouble that led up to
yesterday's difficulty is best told by the
persons themselves. The two accounts
are somewhat different. Last night Beres
f.Â»rd attempted to enter the apartsments
of Mrs. Naher to bid her good- by, so he
says, and the angry husband gave him a
thrashing.

ing aboard the steamer while en route to
Seattle, whither she was being brougnt
â¢ for treatment.
After this murderous assault upon his
wife Miller turned the weapon upon him
self, inflicting two wounds about the head,
which may prove fatal. He is now under
arrest.
Justice of the Peace Duelly stated that
Mrs. Miller had for several months lived
in fear of her life because of her husband's
frequent threats to kill her. With the
repot t of the murder 300 Port Blakeley
millhands surrounded the house where
the crime was committed, threatening to
lynch the murderer, and they desisted
only upon learning that Miller himself
was in a dying condition. When found
he was lying prostrate across the body of
bis wife. Mr. and Mrs. Miller have one
child, now crossing the Pacific on a steamer
from Japan.
SAN BERNARDINO GOLD.
Quartz Lead Struck by a Man Who Was
Dgging a Ditch Upon His
Homestead. ,
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Feb. 22.â
Thomas Liljegren has just arrived from a
point fifty miles up the coast in a rather
mountainous and unsettled section of San
Bernardino County. There he bad filed
upon a homestead claim, bur. a dis
covery made while improving his prop
erty caused him to change his mind re
garding tbe uses to which he would put it.
â¢In cutting a ditch for irrigation pur
poses be drove squarely through a vein
of gold-bearing quartz, which runs well in
copper also. This bonanza, as he believes
it to be, is not more than two feet from
the surface and runs at right angles with
the work. He prospected further both
ways from the first discovery, and the
vein was as large at other points. He has
come to Santa Monica to make arrange
ments to more thoroughly prospect and
develop bis find, and with him will return
two otner men whom he has interested in
thÂ« prospect.
This discovery is in a section of San
Bernardino County little prospected, but
years ago it was said by old California
miners to contain gold. Mr. Liljegren is
a painter by trade, and has been working
here for a year or more for means where

CARSON, Nicy., Feb. 22.â The Piute and
Shoshone Indians on the reservation near
Pyramid Lakes were reported to be in a
belligerent mood this morning, but a
slight display of force by the State author
ities cooled them down, and all is quiet
to-night. The first intimation, of trouble
came in the form of a message to Gover
nor^Sadler, which read as follows:
Yeeington, Nev., Feb. 20.
- Governor Sadler, Carson: Indians have threat
ened to burn and kill all whites within reacn
ol the valley. Send us fifty men by special
train and fifty extra stands of arms. By order
of citizens' committee.
Yferringti^ is a small station on the
Carson and Colorado narrow-gauge, thirty
miles from this .'city. At Mason Valley,
near Yerington. three white men met an
Indian and two squaws a few days ago
and attempted to kidnap the women. The
buck interfered and was struck over the
head with an iron bar and killed. * The
local authorities released the murderers
after a perfunctory examination and the
Piutes determined to punish the whites in
their own way. The squaws were sent
away from the valley and the settlers fled
pellmell to Yerington and wired for as
sistance.
Adjutant- General Galucha was dis
patched to Yerington with instructions to
report on the situation immediately, and
the State National Guard was placed un
der arms at Virginia City. This evening
reports of a pacific nature were received
from the reservation and the guard was
dismissed. The fighting bucks do not
number more than 100 and could easily be
dispersed by. the Mason Valley cowboys,
who are well armed and always ready for
trouble. 7:7 -

Editor Examiner-Journil, New York and San Francisco :
Here goes for another exclusive. I can whip Fitzsimmons.
It's true, of course, that Fitzsimmons whipped Sharkey and that Sharkey
would have whipped me if he'd been let alone, but that doesn't count.
I wasn't so sure that I could whip Fitzsimmons until 1 read in yesterday's CALL
that he was ill. I felt better myself right away.
By the way, I want to tell you that THE CALL is doing us up. We get the
letters and they get the news. Couldn't you turn on a little more gray matter and

I think I ought to have an assistant up here. If I don't I'll soon be do wn with

It hurts me to think of the raw work you've been doing since I came up here,

coarseness.
On Sunday we had a man out in San Francisco pasting bills on the fences,
which bills were to tell the public of your great enterprise in getting me and Fitz for
special correspondents. Now, there's no doubt thai you crowned yourselves with
honor and glory when you got the aforesaid on the staff, but on the dead quiet you

Of course it's all right to snub the church cranks who won't put up a bean for

Here's^ something else that's rather raw. I've been here a week at least and
you haven t sent a lady reporter to write me up. You were speedy enough when

see the fight. There will be seats for 17,000, you know. Now 10,000 people at $16

you don t get any of it. You're booming this thing for the love of sport. That's

of the world to me. didn't it? Now,
where does Mr. Corbett come in for his
claims for the championship? He signs
all of his show bills, 'James J. Corbett,
champion of the world,' when in reality I
am the only simon-pure champion.
"But Ido not care to dispute this mat
ter with him at the present time. He can
claim to be tbe President of the United
States if he wants to, but there will be a
different story to tell on the evening of
the 17th of March. I will be square with
him then for all of the indignities he has
attempted to heap upon me."
This afternoon the Cornishman became
more reasonable vith his trainers and con
sented to indulge in some exercise. Hickey
and Roeber chided him about it by telling
him thp.t he was taking the advantage of
the absence of Martin Julian, his manager
and brother-in-law. This "riled" Fitz
simmons and he made an engagement
with both of them for heavy bouts late in
the afternoon.
Immediately after luncheon be ex
pressed a desire to take a jog into town,
and, thinking that he meant it, the train
ers hitched np a buggy and instructed
Fitzsimmons to take a grip on the rear
axle and run behind tbe vehicle. The
Cornishman ran a few hundred yards
through the deep snow and then called a
halt. '77 â 
It was too wet and sloppy, he said, and
getting into the bu-gy he rode into
Carson. He made a few purchases of
underwear and sweaters, and then rode
back to the ranch.
Upon his arrival there he stripped and ,
cuffed Hickey around the gymnasium for
Â» quarter of an hour, and then seized
Roeber around the neck for a wrestling
bout. 7.7 7.: - *.7
Fitzsimmons alternated with his train
ers until both wore tired out, but did not '
give any evidence of fatigue himself ex
cept for the snuffling resulting from a
light cold he contracted At Salt Lake.
The tall lizhter boasts that no cold ever
clung to him mora than a week, and tbis
being one tbat he considers not severe he
pays practically no attention to it.
After the rub-down Fitzsimmons took
matters easy and declared he would do
no more work until to-morrow. Then, he
says, he intends to begin with a long road
run in spite of the snow and slush. He
argues that a man can cultivate good
wind by running through the snow as
well as by sprinting over dry roads, and
at all events he intends to try the experi
ment.
Corbett put in a quiet day out at Sbaw : s
Springs, but nevertheless it was a day of
hard work and serious training. James
L. went to bed early last night and had a
great sleep. In consequence he arose
strong ana fresh, and ordered out bis
trainers lor tbe day's work. The bulk of
this unpleasant labor fell upon Billy
Woods and Joe Corbett, for big Jack Mc-
Vey, the wrestler, is still sick and unable
to work.
Indeed, it may be a week yet before Mc-
Vey can again don the harness, for the
climate has prostrated him, and he may
have logo through a siege of pneumonia.
Woods was compelled to again don the
pneumatic mask in order to escape a broken
jaw cr other damages to his countenance,
and it was well that he did, for Jim
lashed out bis blows vigorously and sev
eral times sent poor Billy staggering over
against the wall, mask and all. Joe Cor
bett stepped into the breac > when Woods
had enough, and when Joe called time
they all stopped for a few games of hand
ball. After that there was more boxing
and then a rundown before lunch.
In the afternoon this performance was
repealed, but in the presence of a larger
crowd of visitors than called at the springs
during the morning. Corbett is worried
over the lack of exercise he gets because of
the unfortunate illness of McVey.and tele
graphed to his brother, Harry, in San
Francisco this aiternoon to engage Pro
fessor George Miehling, wrestling instruc
tor of the Olympic Club, or Vincent
White, if possible, to rake McVoy's place
until he recovers.;.. I
Corbett says that wrestling is one of the
most important features of bis training,
and he cannot shape himself for the fight
without it. The pulling and hauling he
gets by this metboi harden him for the
clinches which he expects will play an
important part in the coming contest.
The "champ"' was overjoyed to-night
by the receipt of news that hiÂ« wife and
sister would leave San Francisco for Car
son next Friday evening. He says he is
lonesome and believes that the presence
of the ladies will add new life to tbe
training quarters. Mrs. Corbett will su
perintend the cooking of all of Jim's
meals. It is not known whether or not
she will remain here until the 17ih of
March. pjJfWWtfSHBWS
Ground was broken this morning for

daylight and by tbis . afternoon had the
site completely cleared of snow. Then
a stake was driven in the center of the in

a rope 150 feet long were sent around in a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY,: FEBRUARY 23, 1897.
\ away. Carload after carload of lumber
j has been coming in all the afternoon, and
! It is thought that by to-morrow night all
j will be in readiness to put the uprights in
, position.
The plans for the bnildmg have been
j ordered changed by Stuart, so that the
i box seats adjoining the ring will be placed
on an incline similar to the reserved rows.
The original design provided for the plac
i ing of the boxes on a level plane for a dis
tance of thirty feet back of the ring on
; each of the eight sides of the building.
Orders for box seats are coming in so
rapidly, regardless of cost, that the space
i for them will have to be widened, and in
! order that all of the high-priced seat
' holders may have an unobstructed view
it was found necessary to raise the seats
\ on tiers.
Under the new plan each row of boxes
j will be ten inches higher than the one in
I front of it and that means that nobody in
i the house will be deprived of a full view
|of the stage. W. K. Wheelock, Smart's
' chief lieutenant, says that nearly 4000
p box seats have been spoken for already.
Dan Smart to-day dispatched Al Smith
on a still hunt for his hard-fisted name-
I sake, "Mysterious" Billy Smith, who will
| be given an opportunity to face George
| Green of San Francisco on March 16.
j Smith is looking for a match and has fre
quently tried to get one with Green.
j Stuart thinks the men are about of equal
'â  ability and is willing that they should
! open the great carnival.
; One pair of heavy-weights will satisfy
j the, Texan sport, but he has a notion of
I signing a couple of light or bantam
'weights to round out the carnival. Who
they will be nobody can say until the
. directo: -general is able to attend to busi
-1 ness. He received a ntimb-r of callers to
! day and is in much better spirits than at
any time during his illness.
Secretary Wheelock has on file letters
! from men of more or less prominence in
every State in the Union asking that
women be admitted to the carnival. The
majority reason that, as the glove contest
will be held under State license and pro
tection, ladies have as much right to ad
mission as they now enjoy at theaters.
Their presence would tend to preserve
order and give tone to the performance.
A meeting of Stuart'- aavisors will shortly
be held to consider the matter.
Forecast officials ventured on the street
to-day without fear. The thermometer
ranged from 8 below zero at daybreak up
to 40 above 4 p. m.
When the sun dipped behind the Sierras
ice began to form, and a fall to 15 below is
predicted for the night. At tbis rate the
snow will last four weeks, but warm
weather is certain to follow when the
wind shifts from the northeast, where it
has held steadily for several days.
STOPPED WITH A BULLET.
Deputy Shtr.ff Timmms of Fresno Kills a
Horsethisf Jim D.-n man's Costly
Break for Liberty.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 22.â James Den
man, a horsetbief, was shot and killed by
Deputy Sheriff L. P. Timmins to-night in
the Courthouse park while attempting to
escape from the officer, who had placed
him under arrest. Deuman lived only a
lew minutes after being shot. The bullet
hit him in the back of the head, crashed
through the brain and came out over the
left eye. 7/7
Denman is known to have been guilty
of several thefts of horses and cattle in
Kings County, and was a man whom the
officer** always had i their eyes on. The
charge on which D-puiy Sheriff Timmins
arrested him to-night was that of stealing
a band of horses about two month ago
from R. B. Butler's pasture, at Wild
flower, in the southern part of the county.
Timmins found Denman in the New
Palm Garden, a saloon at the corner of J
and Fresno streets, at 9 o'clock to-night.
The officer placed the hor-ethief under
arrest and started with him for the jail,
which is located just back of the Court
house. As the Deputy Sheriff with his
prisoner entered the walk which leads to
the Jail at the southwest corner of the
park Denman began turning his head and
looking back. The Deputy Sheriff warned
him to look straight ahead.
A moment later Denman wheeled
around and ran. Deputy Sheriff Timmins
is lame and unable to sprint. He pulled
his pistol and commanded the fugitive ;o
halt. Denman paid no heed and the of
ficer called to him a second time with the
warning tbat be would shoot.
The horsethief did not stop and then
Timmins fired, Denman being about
twenty feet distant. The deputy's aim
was good, for he hit the fugitive the first
shot. Denman fell . headlong on the
ground and uttered not a word. The
officer called for a hack as quickly as . pos
sible to take the injured man to jail, but
he died just as he was' being carried into
the prison. He made no statement before
he died.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 22.--As the. big
clock in the cout house tower rang the
hour of noon to-day there was a flash of
flame and smoke from tbe port side of the
flagship cruiser Philadelphia and a mo
ment later a deafening report rang out.
Ii was the first of the salute of twenty
one guns from each of the ships of the
North Pacific squadron now in port in
honor of the first President of the United
States, whose birthday San Dieeo to-day
celebrated with the grandest water carni
val ever witnessed on ibis coast.
The scene on the bay as the Philadel
phia fired her first shot was one of gran
deur and sublimity. Not a cloud in the
blue sky obscured even for a moment the
warm rays of a southern sun.
The wind blowing gently from the west
ruffled the surface of the water into a
million wavelets, each separate crest dia
mond-tipped and sparkling with nature's
own jewels. On the broad bosom of the
bay floated the mighty machines whose
construction was designed for war rather
than for peaceful celebrations.
Ten thousand flags, pennants and ban
ners floated in the wind. Just off the
Santa Fe wharf lay the big flagship Phila
delphia, the flower of the fleet, with the
ad miral's pennant floating gracefully from
her masthead.
To the westward, up the bay, was the
big monitor Montery, a magnificent arch
running from bow to stern, its apex touch
ing the topmast and its enas dipping into
the sea. From this arch fluttered a
hundred pennants, while all around
hung strings and festoons of Japanese
lanterns and electric lights, ready to do
their part in the brilliant spectacular dis
play that opened with the nightfall. Be
yond the Monterey lay the British cruiser
Comus, with flags and pennants
flying, and 200 sturdy men and
true upon her main decks, ready at the
word of command to lire a royal salute in
democratic waters in honor of the man of
all others who was responsible for the
severance of the ties which bound this
nation to theirs.
To the eastward, in succession, lay the
monitor Monadnock, the United States
steamers Albatross and Corwin ana the
gunboat Marion, all their rigging deco
rated in gala attire and with flags flying
at every masthead.
The men were dressed in their neatest
holiday uniforms; the bands on the
decks discoursed their- most magnetic
music; the wharves- were lined with spec
tators, all straining their ears to catch the
sound of the first order, or their eyes to
see the first puff of smoke from the big
guns.
At 11:59 o'clock all was as silent as a
farmhouse at midnight. The next moment
an officer on the bridge of the Philadel
phia stepped forward and gave a com
mand to the gunner. Flash! boom l boom 1
and the vast crowd on shore cheered and
veiled as though a real battle had been
fought and America had won the victory.
The shot from the Philadelphia was
answered by a broadside from the Comus,
and a minute later the firing became gen
eral for a mile along the water front,
where the vessels were anchored. Then
the dense white cloud of smoke lifted, and
the crowds dispersed to their dining-rooms
and those ot their neighbors.
At 2 o'clock those not on military duty
returned and assembled along D street to
witness the great street parade, which
started promptly nt 2 o'clock from India
and D street*, under the leadership of
Grand Marshal Colonel A. G. Gassen. â  '
It bad been generally expected that the
crew of the British gunboat Comus would
march in the parade, permission to this
effect having been received by Captain
Dyke from Admiral Palliser of the Pacific
squadron. *. r
At noon, however, a final message was
received irom Sir Julian Pauncefote, Brit
ish Ambassador at Washington, stating
that, while no international breach or
etiquette would be committed, still the
fact of permitting foreign troops to
march on American soil as an armed
force was unprecedented, and it was not
deemed advisable to permit it to be done.
Captain Dyke reluctantly conveyed this
intelligence to Mayor Carlson and Grand
Marshal Gassen, and there being no help
for it they were compelled to submit.
"Ten Thousand Miles Away."
The many patrons of Morosco's brand Opera
house were yesterday treated to a revival of
Oliver Byron's play, entitled, "Ten Thousand
Miles Away," which bids fair to enjoy a very
successful -run. It is constructed upon ortho- j
dox inclodrp' malic lines and affords free scope I
for the varied talents of Mr. Morosco's stock
company. Humor, pathos, tragedy and com- }
edy are combined in wholesome proportions.
The situation)* are thrilling or ludicrous, as i
the cÂ«se ma y be, and vice receives a terrible
object-lesson. Young Bert Morrison, in the I
role of Harper, the head turnkey, did excel
lent work, and proved conclusively to his ad
mirers that his choice of a profession was well
advlted. Of the very extensive cast which
gives the play au interpretation, Mortimer
Know, as Joe Ferris, the Ferret, and Lorena
Atwood, as Louise Goodwin, won the sympa
thy of their audience, while Pierson.as the in
dispensible .villain, Adderly, aroused the
proper degree of detestation. The specialties
oft. .1. Heron, Frank Montrose, Nat *>". Wills,
Arline Watt- and Lottie Williams werj so
much enjoyed, and the remaining characters
were in capable hands. .

, Sousa's Band opens at the California

TURKEY DINNER
ON THE STAGE
Bucolic Scenes Applauded
in "Shore Acres' at
the Baldwin.
Fanny Rice Receives a Warm
Reception at the Colum
bia Theater.
"Saints and Sinners" With Miss J>l.
liff. at the Alcrztrâ The
Tivoli's Bill.
"Shore Acres," with the author, James
A. Heme, in the title role, was warmly
received at the Baldwin Theater la"*t
night. The play represents a picture of
rural New* England life which abounds in
touches of homelike, everyday existence.
A turkey dinner is eaten on the stage,
with a real turkey, which fills the theater
with the odor of cooking, the viands
are prepared before the eyes of the audi
ence and other details of life are presented
with minute fidelity. Â
Simple and almost commonplace as
most of the action of the play proved to
be, it delighted the auditors, and even tbe
turkey was warmly applauded. The
reasons for this were no doubt the per
fect truth to life of "Shore Acres," both in
I the characters and the way they were put
! on the stage, added to the exquisitely
j artistic acting of James A. Herue himself.
The plot of the play is ot the simplest.
I It is the old story of the girl who runs
I away from home to marry because her
! father wants her to have the wrong man.
; After Helen Berry is cone her father re
| pents, and returning on Christmas eve
I abe is forgiven. The girl's uncle plays a
j conspicuous part in the elopement. Uncle
: Nat Berry is the good genius of the lovers
â¢ and of every on the farm, and he is
| the hero of the one melodramatic scene in
â¢ the play.
Nat and Martin Berry, the brothers who
i farm Shore Acre", are also the lighthouse
j keepers, and when Martin realizes that his
! daughter has eloped and gone to sea with
j a young man who has rejected the ortho
j doxy of the neighborhood he is so scan-
J dalized that a daughter of his should
! marry a believer in D-rwinianism tnat be
i decides to leave the lighthouse in dark
ness and let the brig on which the lovers
sail go to pieces on the rocks. Uncle Nat
finds out his design, and there is a strug
gle in the lighthouse, which ends in Nat
winning the day and l'ghting the lamp.
At times "Shore Acres" recalls mem
ories of "The Old Homestead" ; at other
times the mind of the -spectator wanders
back involuntarily to "The Cricket on the
Hearth." But these resemblances are to
a great extent superficial. The real charm
of "Shore Acres" lies in its character
drawing and its local coloring, which are
studied in every detail from life. The
weakness of the play is in its lack of
drama'.ic'action, whicn makes it drag a
little here and there. It is impossible to
: say too much in praise of James A.
Hearne's acting. 7.7
One long monologue in the first act, in
which he described why his mother was
buried beside the sea, was so simply and
| pathetically delivered that many people
! shed tbe! responsive tear, and the house
I clamored for several minutes to get a
speech, when the curtain went down, but
Mr. Hearne did not respond. All through
the play he was the simple good-hearted
i farmer to the life, a character quite as mi
l teresting, if not quite so vivacious, as Dsn
i man Thompson's role in the "Old Home
j stead."
Most of the star's support was good.
Robert Fischer gave an excellent render
ing of Martin Berry, the stern parent;
James T. Galloway made the most of the
role of Joel Gat the grass-widower, who
was given a "hand-out" at a turkey din
ner, and little Gladys Carotins as Mandv
Gates aroused roars of laughter by the
new and fascinating way in which she de
voured pie and celery.
Grace Gayler Clark was natural and
clever a-* Martin Berry's wife and one of
the most successful characters in the play
was Master Alexander Paul the youthful
son of Martin Berry, whose strict ortho
doxy in matters of Sunday-school training,
added to a consuming desire to wear Ions!
pants, endeared him to the audience. The
other Berry child ten acted prettily. Lucy
Morrow as the Helen Berry might have
improved her part by being less lackad
aisical.
The staging of "Shore Acres" showed
careful and conscientious study in every
de tail. '
Columbia Theater.
Fanny Rice was welcomed last night by an
audience which filled the Columbia Theater.
The play in which she appeared was "At the
French Ball," which has been seen here be
fore, but Fanny Rice always seems able to in
vest anything she perlorms with the charm of
novelty, and the laughter and applause which
greeted her efforts showed how much the audi
ence appreciated her.
"At the French Ball" was written for Fanny
Rice, with a view of giving her every oppor
tunity for the display of hertale-nt-; she has
most of the jokes, and all the situations aro
hers. As people had come to see Fanny Rice
and not the play, this state of things just
fitted in with their tastes.
The story of "At the French Ball" describes
tie adventures of Nancy Patch, a shoemaker's
wife, who becomes discontented with her lot.

gets of aching hearts Deueath the ttlamor of
wealth effectually cure Nancy of any further
desire to live in the whirl of society. Her ad
ventures end at a French ball, where Nancy
gets some queer glimpses of life.
Miss Rice acted with her usual verve, and
sang as she ever doesâ that is, not very bril
liantly from a vocal standpoint, but with
enough vim to call form encores and ap
plause. The star has surrour.d herself ***ith
an efficient company. Miss Kate Mlchelena,
who look the role of the prima donna whom
Nancy befriend*, acted her part cleverly and
sang satisfactorily. - * - â¢ â¢
George Broderick. who possesses a
pleasant barytone voice, took several
parts in the various adventures which
befell Nancy. HI- principal role was
that of an insane Duke, who proposes to
the shoemaker's, wife under the impression
that she is a great heiress He overacted the
affectation, but his whimsicalities raised a
good many laughs. Charles Drew played the
several parts, well, so did John Conley and
John S. Terry. The rest of the cast was satis
factory.
* At the Alcazar.
The Alcazar was crowded to the doors last
night by an -enthusiastic and fashionable
audience. The attractions were, the sterling
drama "Saints and Sinners," the first appear
ance of Miss Frances Jollitf. at this bouse, and
last but not least, the reappearance of George
Osbourne. . â  .â¢ V
Curtain call after curtain call was received, 1
both for Miss Jollift'c and Mr. Osbourne. The
play is a strong one , and well calculated to
bring out the best work of each member of
the company. '*
Mr. Osbourue's impersonation of Jacob
Fletcher, the kindly old minister, is only a
repetition of his former successes in the same
role. Miss . Jolliffe as Letty Fletcher,
the minister's erring daughter, a
strong emotional role, went through
the part without one tinge of the nervousness -
one might expect in the rendering of so diffi
cult a character by one so inexperienced in
stage work. There is a brilliant future in
store for this young lady if she develops as she
has. begun. The management may congratu
late themselves on so strong an acquisition to
the company.
One 01 the hits of the performance was a
very clever bit of character work in the tilth
act,- done by Miss Juliet Crosby, a recent
debutant-, who relentlessly sacrificed her
preky features to play a silly country g.rl.
Miss Buckley, Mr. Foster and the rest of the
company all did exceptionally fine work.
On Saturday afternoon there will be a sou
venir matinee to celebrate the two hundred
and fiftieth performance of the stock company.
At the Orpheum.
The newcomers at the Orpheum this week
are Barney Fagan, composer of "My Gal Is a
High-born Lady" and other popular ditties,
and Miss Byron, singing comedienne. They
appear in a dialogue which abounds with
puns that raise many a laugh. Barney Fagan
and Miss Byron also give several songs, and
last night these brought them a number of
encores. ; <.?.â¢â *'â +
Eraiiy Lytton. and the Hayes Brother-; are
appearing in the burlesque on "Camiile"
which took so well last week. The members of
the Grand Opera quar.et seem to have be
come very popular with the Orpheum audi
ences. Last nieht all the singers appeared in
solos. Aoramoff sang the lufelice from "lir
-11 ani," Miss Busch gave the Flower Sung from
Gounod's ''Faust.'" and Miss Cotte and Guilt"
obliged respectively with Ardlti's "Purla" and
"Ceeste Aida." . â¢'â 
The vocal numbers concluded with the i
grand trio from â¢'! Lombardi," sung by Miss
Co: it- and Sienors Guille and A brum off.
Professor Kinney continues to astonish the
audiences with his performances in the tank
and the length of time he remains under
water, and Miss Marie Finnic still circles
about gracefully under water. The aerial ar
tistsâthe Reninsâ remain on the programme,
as well as the Panizer trio.
At the Tlvoll Op House.
"The Lovely Galatea," by yon Suppe, la con
junction with Gilbert and Sullivan's ever
popular ''Patience," was the double bill pre
sented to the patrons of this theater, and the
lovers of good music turned out in numbers to
prove that comic opera w asas popular as ex

done since she came here, and that's saying a
good deal. She was in excellent voice, and
her singing of the drinking song is beauti
fully done.
Bernice Holmes' lovely contralto voice as
usual charmed the audience, as did Rhys
Thomas; and William West, always good, com
pleted a particularly fine cast.
"Patience" Is an old iriend and it is
sufficient to say that the present cast equals
any of the others that have been presented
here. 7* 7
Little Cinderella.
The Little Cinderella Company began Its
second week at the California with quite the
swing of old stagers. Very much of that un
certainty of sound and step and situation that
is a part, of new things on the stage and more
particularly of new people, and most particu
larly of very young people, had disappeared.
The little people are now well accustomed
to their parts nnd make as much of them
as is oiten done by more experienced
players. Cinderella, â  Resins D'Eaner/;
Pedro, Jimmy Horn; Nina Cook, uiis
Tait, Nellie Shaw, Jennie Flossie,
Gus Levick, Daisy Grogan and Baby Ruth
Rowland, all captured the audience both in
the performance of their pans and in their
specialties. The singing of Matthew Keefe
from the upper box was encored again and
again. The house was fairly well filled.
The Oberon.
The old Oberon, which is so well known to
epicures as a restaurant and grillroom, opened
as a first-class music and concert hall last
evening.
Dunn, tno past few weeks the place has
ben thoroughly renovated and remodeled,
and those who called last evening to hear the
initial concert hardly knew the establishment.
Stark's Vienna Orchestra furnished the music,
the programme being as follows-. â
March, "Deutschmeister," (Ertl); overture,
"Tambour dv G*rde," (Titl); waltz. "Re
membrance," (Waldleufel); selection, "GJpsv
Baron,'-' (Strauss); tarantella, "Forosetta,"
(Ardtti); largo, (aandel); violin so o, "Gipsy
Dances" (Hubay), llerr F. Stark; fantasia, "11
Trovatore," (Verdi).
March, "C. G. V." (Vottler); overture, "Hun
garian Comedy" (Keler Bels); cello solo, Pol
onaise de Concert (D. Popper), Herr A.
Weiss; waltz, -'Vienna Tempesi" (Strauss);
"Hungarian Dances" (Brahms); selection,
â¢â¢Gasparone" (Millccker); waltz, "Nacht
warmer" (Ziebrcr); finale.
At the Chutes.
The fireworks"attracted over 6000 people to
the Chutes last evening. The night was per
fect and the pyrotechnic display excellent. !
The pleasant weather is proving a blessing to
the Haight-street grounds and every after
noon and evening the performances on the
open air stage by Bre^iuo, the wire-walker,
and Busch the "human vampire," are well re
ceived. Bristol's trained horses will be one o
trie features for Sunday.

THIS LADY KNEW WHAT TO DO
. ;
And So She Gave Some Valuable Advice
"*;V'-*i - to Her Friend.
A lady who recently happened to visit a
neighbor found her in a terrible state of
misery. Her head was tightly bound
with a handkerchief, and there were dart
circles around her eyes.
"Why, whatever is the matter " in-
quired the visitor, with some alarm.
"Oh, I don't know, but for days I have
been feeling so weak, tired and unstrung.
I have no appetite, feel bilious and dyspep-
tic, and now I have a' racking headache."
"Ah, now, "l can plainly see what the
matter is," was the reply, "for I have been
through the very same experience myself.
I was feeling precisely as you are when a
friend advised me to try a pure medicinal
stimulant, and I derived wonderful benefit
from doing so. Take my advice and try a
little pure malt whiskey. "
"But you know I never touch spirits of
any kind."
"Neither do I except as a remedy.
When I was feeling as you are I took
Duffy's pure malt whiskey and made
me strong and well. â  I am convinced it
will do the same for you."
The experience of this lady has been
verified in thousands of other cases, and
vast numbers of women are kept in health
by the regular use of this great remedy.
All grocers and druggists k-ep Duffy's
pure malf, but in purchasing care should
be taken to secure only the genuine.

the funding bill, and particularly Con
gressman Maguire, and favoring the im
mediate foreclosure of the mortgages held

Nearly a hundred members of the league
and their friends were seated about the
tables in the banquet-room of Delmonico's
restaurant last evening when the gath
ering was called to order by President A.
D. Lemon of the Iroquois Club.
The apartment was 'decorated with
palms and choice flowering plants, the
table being buried in a profusion of blos
soms and green branches. About the
tables were seated Democratic war horses,
young and old, who did ample justice to
the bountiful repast.
In the north end of the room, draped
with the National colors, was a large pic
ture of General Washington, and at the
opposite end on an easel was a portrait of
William J. Bryan, whose name was ap
plauded to the echo whenever mentioned.
Judge Lemon, in a . neat and appropri
ate speech, welcomed the guests of the
evening, and dedicated the banquet to the
memory of Washington and the cause of
constitutional government, which, he
said, bad been begun by the father of
thia country, perpetuated by the pen of
Jefferson and adhered to by every Demo
cratic President since the latter's time.
After the good things that were brought
on bad been disposed of from blue points
to the nougatine of vanilla, Toastmasier
Louis Metzger called for the reading of
the answers that had been received from

Lincoln, Nebr., Feb. 15, 1897.
Louis Metzger, Iroquois Clubâ Dear Sib: I
am just in receipt of your Invitation to attend
banquet on Washington's birthday. I regret
that I cannot be present, but commend the
members of the club for doing honor to the
memory of Washington, and to express the
hope that the occasion will stimulate those
present to the highest patriotism and citizen
ship. Yours truly, Wm. J. Bryan.
Mr. Metzger began to mention the
speeches ot the evenin;*, but was inter
rupted bp E. P. E. Troy, who said that he
had charges to prefer against the new
grand treasurer. The charges consisted
of accusing the toastraasterof being a good
fellow, a good Democrat and one worthy
of receiving a lasting remembrance.
In the name of the Iroquois braves he
presented Mr. Metzger with an exquisite
scarf nin fashioned in the shape of the
emblem of the club and set with diamonds
and rubies.
When the grand treasurer had thanked
the assemblage for the present he intro
duced Lewis F. Byington, the second vice

Sketch Club. A printed poem, entitled,
"Mount Vernon," by Charles S. Greene,
was handsomely illustrated by one of tbe
young ladies belonging to the Daughters
of 'the Revolution, with the picture of
Washington ana hi- country home. It
was sealed with a stamp belonging to the
Washington family. One ot the principal
peakers was William M. bunker of the
Report. The toasts and responses were as
follows:
Introductory remarks by the president, Sid
ney M. Smith; "The Spirit of Washington's
Time," Aimarin P. Paul; "Washington the
Soldier," Colonel Frank W. Sumner; "The
French Republic," Alexandre Laurence de
Lalande; "Washington as Boy and Man," Wil
liam M. Bunker; "Washington the Surveyor"
(Z. U.Dodge), read by Charles L. P. Marais;'
"Mount Vernon," Charles S. Greene; "The
Swiss Republic," Alfred A. Borlini.
A number of the speeches were very
happy and elicited much applause. Mr.
Bunker responded to the toast "Washing
ton ms Boy and Man." He said in part:
He was a proud, mettlesome, dignified boy,
with a temper and will of his own and a fond
ness for athletic sports. Ai the age of 14 he
romped in recess with the largest girl in
school and thus early showed a regard for the
fair sex that to the last was one of his leading
and most admirable traits. He ever held
woman in respectful admiration, and while
shy as a reporter under some circumstances,
in the presence of the fair ones he was always
at home.
Washington inherited his military spirit
from tne great-grandfather who, eighty years
before ihe birth of this great-grandson, was
the hero ot co.ouia. Indian wars; his physique
came from his mother and his early training
and education were due to the two elder
brothers with whom he went to live at the age
of 11.
At 17 Washington was county surveyor
at a salary of $250 a year; later ad
jutant of a Virginia military district,
then aid to Bra. dock, tnen a burgess
and later . a general and statesman. He
was singularly modest, and, strange as it
may appear to those familiar with the public
men of to-day, he. blushed at words of praise.
Elected chancellor of William and Mary Col
lect-, lie wrote thai he feared he was not fit tor
the position and thought the trustees might
east y find a better man. Imagine a public
man of '97 declining an office' on the score ol
his unfitness! The bravery of Washington
balanced his modesty.
When we consul the early environment of
Washington and the rude methods and free
style ot his period; when we think of the temp
tations besetting tne handsome, high-spirited,
successful young soldier; when wo recall the
countless social, official and military dangers
surrounding him, we are amazed beyond
measure that he passed through the ordeal
without a single stain, that be always bore .he
whtte plume of a blameless life, and that to
day, knowing him as boy and man, we, as a
people, and all the free peoples of the earth,
can meet on -a common plane and Join ia his
apotheosis.
About twenty years ago the California
Society of the Sons of the American Revo
lution was organized in San Francisco.
The society is composed of lineal male de
scendants of the patriots who assisted in
establishing American independence.
All applicants for membership must be
able to present documentary or other sat
isfactory evidence tbat they are lineal
descendants of sires who were loyal to,
and rendered active service in, the cause
of American independence. Tbis condi
tiiion of membership is indispensable,
and must be without flaw.
The managers of the society are: Sidney
M. Smith, president; Edwin Bonnell, sec
retary; Colonel J. C. Currier, senior vice
president; Hon. Horace Davis, junior
vice-president; Charles H. Warner, treas
urer; William Scnuyler Moses, marshal;
Colonel A. S. Hubbard, register; Roberts
Vandercoolt, William M. Bunker, Z. U.
Dodge, M. L. Requa and A. B. Paul.
Tne roll of the society shows 230 names
and additional members are being gained
at the rate of twelve a month.
A singular circumstance and one very
unusual at roost banquets was that every
seat was filled. It was one of the largest
and finest gatherings that has been seen
in a long time.

Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied 'by cloudy â¢ weather and â¢ rains.
"Lows 'usually first appear on the Washington
co * t : When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

not a heavy supply for the first business day of the j

were generally steady, and the comparatively
small number of well-... attired cat t c sold readily
at strong quotations. About 4-*,OO- hogs ere re

OF A TRAGEDY
Strange Story Told by a
Wife About a Hus
band's Jealousy.
He Is Ordered by tie Police to
Cease His Espionage of
Her.
The Couple Have Separated and Mrs.
.. Reeder Says a Divorce Would
B7 Agreeable.
â¢ Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
9-8 Broadway, Feb. 22. f
Mrs. Reader, who resides at the Henry
Hou<e, told a peculiar story to-day, in
which her husband and a friend of the
family figured prominently.
Several months ago RÂ»eaer and his wife
separated and Mrs. Reeder went to work
at tho' Henry House on Ninth street so
that she could support her two children.
Ever since she has bean thero her husband
has kept watch over her in. a most un
pleasant manner and bas had not the
slightest excuse for so doing. Las: night
the police were called to the house to pro
' tect the life of Christopher Miller.
Mr. Miller has long been a friend of the
Heelers and Mr. Reeder is extremely jeal
ous whenever Mr. Miller calls at the Henry
House. Last evening Miller was at the
house, and as he was about to leave hÂ« no
ticed Reeder patrolling about in front of
the house on the street. Fearing that his
intentions were not altogether pleasant
Miller called up the police by telephone
and when they arrived he reported the
situation to them.
â¢The officers searched Reeder and found
that he hud no weapons on him. They
therefore sent the two men in different
directions, but refused to make an arrest.
"I only wish he would get a divorce,"
said Mrs. Reeder to-day; "and if that is
ail he wants he can have it as soon as
poss.il le. He deserted me last Septem
ber, when my baby was only six weeks
old. 1 have Been married to him for ten
years, and we have live children, and
when he left me my friends advised that
I net a divorce, but I hated the notoriety
and trouble. The baby and the oldest
child, a girl, are with me, and the Chil
dren's Society forced him to support the
three little boys.
"Ii is not at all pleasant to live in fear
of a tragedy. I have been working I ere
since last October, and Mr. Mi ler has
always been a friend of ours. Reeder's
position is an absurd one, and I wish he
wouid get a divorce and leave me alone."
Mr. Miller is a well-known business
man, and Mrs. Reeder says she is sorry
tbat her husband's actions have created
borne notoriety, as she fears it will hurt
his business.
JUNIORS WIN THE TROPHY
They Capture th: University
EasebaiJ Champion sbip From
the Stomatologists.
< , i
In Their Freshman Year ths Class of
. '58 Won th 9 Trophy and N.w
Tfcey Have It Again.
' BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 22.â 8y a score
of 24 to 15 the junior class at tbe State
University won the class chamnionsnip
pUd silver trophy for the year 1897 from
the dental college team tbis afternoon on
the Berkeley diamond, thus adding
another victory to its long list of suc
cesses.
In their freshman year tbe juniors won
the championship and cup. They lost it
to the freshmen last year, and now they
bave it again.
The day was clear and the diamond in
; perfect condition, thus rendering good
â  field work and fast base-running possible.
â¢ So evenly were the teams matched ana so
( close did the score run that it was a toss
up even at the beginning of the eighth in- j
ning as to who would finally win cut. Up j
to that time it was anybody's game.
In the eighth the Juniors started their I
procession around the diamond and by
'the time the third man was out they bad
eight run*. When the Dentals came to I
the bat for the last half of the same in- !
â â nine they did not make a tally. The game
was characterized by the many base hits
and errors, especially those of Finlay at
third. H ag made several brilliant' left
field catches, and Foster and Kuster each
made a Home run. Wheeler did well be
hind tbe bat, and dest.ite bis loss through
errors Finlay did some clever base-steal
ing.
The Dentals seemed particularly un
fortunate in having men left 0:1 bases.
When their side retired at the end they
â¢ had three players on bases. From the
following notes on the plays tome idea as
. to the general run of the game may be
' gleaned:
/â¢ Base bitsâ Dentals 16. Junior* 8. Errorsâ
1 Dentals 13, Juniors 14. Home run"â Foster

Exempt Firemen's Ball.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 22.â The Exempt
â¢ Firemen gave a masquerade ball to-night
at Germania Hall. Although the old fire
laddies were very much in evidence there
was a large attendance of gues'.s of a
younger generation, and dancing and
merriment were continued till long after
midnight.. Many of the characters were
! striking and original, and the carnival
was one of the most successful of its kind
ever given in this city.

VERY SLIGHT HOPE.
The State Fair Bill Cannot Be Fat
Through.
OAKLAND, Cat.., Feb. 22.â 1t is not
probable that anything definite will be
done toward bringing the State Fair to
Oakland at this session of the Legislature.
Several of the Alameda delegation were in
Oakland to-day, and they said that the
scheme, while a good one, is hardly feas
ible at this time.
At a general meeting of the Board of
Trade and Merchants' Exchange held this
afternoon Assemblyman Leavitt discussed
the matter with the directors present .
"This subject has been brought up very
late in the session," said Mr. Leavitt.
"The time has not passed for the presen
tation of bills. The one providing for the
removal of the fair to Oakland was handed
in Saturday, and it will be impossible to
get it through inside of five days for ac
tion by the House. Every member of our
delegation is ready to push matters to the
utmost, but it is almost impossible to suc
cessfully handle the measure at this late
date. Rather than make a losing ficht it
would be better to let the matter pass for
the time being. Then, too.* it is under
stood that Governor Budd is opposed to
the removal of the fair, and even if we
should secure the passage of the bill there
is every chance thai the Governor would
veto It."
Assemblyman Howard Wright expressed
similar views to the directors, and it is
probable that the bill may not be pushed
at this session.
LITTLE HARTLEY DIES.
Another Chapter to the Foley Tragedy
in Nevada.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 22.â Attorney
George W. Baker received a dispatch from
Reno to-day announcing the death o: the
infant chill of Mrs. E. C Hartley, the
artist, who shot Senator Foley in 1894.
The death of this child abruptly ends a
most important probate case pending in
the courts of Nevada. Th- case was to
have been bitterly fought out during the
next month, but to-day's news practically
ends it. - ."'.* "7 *
The child in question was born after tbe
conviction of Mrs. Hartley for murder in
the second degree; and she produced an
instrument in writing, in which the
Nevada Senator recognized the child as
his own. Proceedings were commenced
several months ago to recover one-half of
the Foley estate for the child, the other
heirs being the widow, mother, sister and
three brothers of the deceased. Attorney
Baker represented the Eastern heirs,
Harry Mayenoaum of San Francisco
represented the child and various other
counsel represented the otner interests.
The case would . aye been tried in a few
days, but now nothing more will probably
be heard of it.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1897.
RAISED THE FLAG
AND NONE FORBADE
No Further Trouble at
the Eighth- Avenue
Church.
The Difficulty With the Trustees
Adjusted and the Boys
Triumphant.
Visiting Brigade Handsomely Enter
tained Dr. Carroll Explains
the Unique Ceremony.'
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,.
908 Broadway, Feb. 22. J
The flax-raising by the Boys' Brigade
at tbe Eighth-avenue Methodist Church
this afternoon came off according to pro
gramme, notwithstanding the opposition
of Trustee Watson, who forbade the plac
ing of the 11-.pole upon the church Satur
day afternoon. .7 7
The difficulty was adjusted yesterday,
and there was no necessity for the brigade
to carry out its threat of using force to
protect the workmen while placing the
flagstaff in position this morning.
In the auditorium of the church exer
cises were held, presided over by Dr. S. J.
Carroll and Colonel William de Wolf of
the Second Reeiment. The altar was
decorated with flags, oue of which, a band
nome silken affair, with a glided stand
ard, was presented to Company B, Second
Reeiment, two years ago, when the com
pany carried off the honors in a competi
tive drill in the Mechanics' Pavilion.
Miss Mabel Walker and Mrs. Minnie K.
Henderson sang patriotic solos, after
which Dr. Carroll delivered a short ad
dress. Among other things he said:
"The hoisting of the flag over the church
to-day is a startling innovation to some
and yet it is entirely proper 10 do so. A
short time ago there was not a cross upon
tbe Methodist Episcopal church. It was
the first to have one put upon the church
and now many of the churches have fol
lowed our example. The flag-raising is
another innovation. Surely if the stars
and stripes are proper as a decoration
upon our altar it is suitable on the.ex
terior of our churches. The flag is raised
over the part of the church which is de
voted to social meetings. Its presence Is
most appropriate and fittng from its
significance as a symbol. The flag stands
for a great idea, human liberty."
The flag-raising then took place. As the
firing squad, consisting of Sergeant
Schnoor, Privates C. L'oyd, De Wolf and
Evans, tired their talute the flag was
raised, and as soon as it reached uÂ»e mast
head tbe "Star-spangled Banner" was
sung by all, being led by Sergeant Kemp
kev on his silver cornet.
The visiting companies from San Fran
cisco and Aiameua were entertained at
luncheon by the officers of Company D.
The other companies who joined in the
ceremonies were Company Fof the How
ard-street M. E. Church. San Francisco,
and Comp in Gof ths Congregational
cburcb, Alameda. .-â -â¢- â¢

It has been tbe province of the Inter
state Coursing Club to put tbe bound aud
rabbit sport on a healthy footing in this
City. Their annual meeting which began
last Sunday at Ingleside Park, terminat
ing at sundown yesterday, brought to
gether the better class of sportsmen and
the finest breeds of bounds.
The rabbits, strong and fleet after a fow
weeks feeding in tbe corrals of the club's
vast field, were able to give the bounds a
run and make the races more exciting.
This is the first time in the history of
coursing here that men, women and chil
dren have crowded into a grand stand to
the number of over 2000 each day and
viewed the races in comfort, and it may
also be mentioned that never before have
the judges' decision been accepted without
adverse criticism. '-:>.:.'.:-
John Grace, who held that exalted posi
tion, and his son, James F. Grace, the
slipper, have registered themselves at this
meeting as the most impartial and clever
est that the coursing people have had to
rely upon.
Tne three stakes that were run off in
the two days were: Tn.- all-axed dogs,
forty in number, the prizes ranging from
$300, $150 and $75 to $37 60. Tnis stake
was, ot course, the ni.t.n one. The next
was tbe derby with fourteen entries, lor
puppies whelped on or after August 1,
1895. Finally came the saplings, lourteen
entries, whelped on or after February 1,
1896.
The silver cup to tbe winner ln the last
class was presented by Hon. James D.
Phelan, and the .stake will henceforth be
known by the name of Belle Brandon,
yesterday's winner, who is owned by Tom
Hall oi Merced. She is a Johnny Rex out
of Annie Laurie.
However, Nellie Conroy is queen!
tine is the monarch of the California
coursing field, and as pretty a black-and
white hound as ever pursued a hare. Her
winning of the John Grace challenge cup
for all-aged dogs earned her the title. She
proved her right to it by defeating the
pick of the best dogs in the kennels of
tnis and adjoining States, and a half
dozen of the crackerjacks ought here
irom the East7;glSÂ§
She is ir. m importe 1 stock. Royal Crest
out of Daisy 11, but she was bred in Cali
fornia. Her owners, Messrs. Grace and
Dean, are two of the leading coursing pa
trons in the State, and their win is a pop
ular one.

follows: 77.

constitution might never have been
written.
Mr. Barry's remarks were applauded,
and as he referred to the large portrait of

IMMENSE THRONG
VIEWED THE RACES
The Greatest Crowd Ever
Gathered at Ingleside
Track.
Napamax Spreadeagled Her
Field in the Stake -"
Event.
Ferrier Disgrace ally Beaten by For
malâPreston Outsprinted a Good '
'Fieldâ Reddington Won.
On New Year's day, last it looked as
though that portion of the inhabitants of
this big City that were looking to kill
time found their way out to Ingleside
track, and if such really was the case the
same big throng filed in through the turn
stiles of the local course yesterday, the
birthday of the father of our country,
only with allot their relative*! from far
away added. The beautiful weather at
tracted the greatest crowd that has as yet
been gathered within the confines of this
magnificent racecours . From end to end
the spacious grand stand was packed with
beautiful women and their escorts. The
elite of society graced the balconies of tbe
clubhouse, and in the great betting ring
such a crowd was never before gathered.
It seemed as though every man in that
busy crowd tbat knocked and bustled one
another about had previously paid a
visit to the Mint, quietly purloined
a pocketful of -hitting twenties and then
slunk away, fully determined that' tbe
fame of Riiey Grannan as a plunger should
be dimmed. On some ot the races they
were still trying to bet the bookmakers off
the block as the gong announced that tne
horses were off. Ten thousand would be
a conservative estimate of the number of
people present.
And the track 1 It was the wonderment
and surprise of all. Where form players
had expected to find a heavy, muddy
course, what was their consternation to
find, Instead, dry, dusty going that re
quired the services of the sprinkling cart
before the races were over. This confused
followers of tbe dope, and another reca
pitulation of the past week's racing was
necessary.
Of the afternoon's sport nothing but
praise can be said. The finishes were,
witb one or two exceptions, close and ex
citing, and it looked as though all of the
starters were trying. The big crowd was
somewhat startled when imp. Fuilerton
Lass took the opening event at odds of
100 to 1, but thereafter matters went a
trifle easier. Of the six favorites sent to
the post four were returned winners, and
tbe crowd left for home well satisfied with
the day's outing.
The special feature of the programme
was ifie White Seal stake, valued at $1300,
for two-year-ola Allies at four furlongs.
Twelve buxom misses went to the post,
with the Burns & Waterbouse pair, Na
pamax and Miss Kowena, first choices in
the b-ttine, while -Free Lady, owned by
Billy Magrave, was next in demand.
The latter was unfortunate enough to
get left at the post. Among the entries
was Tom Griffiu's Martha, a daughter of
imp. Dandie Dinmoat, and reports of her
fas' work caused the cdds against the filly
to be speedily swiped from 30 down to 4
to 1. h was a wild plunge, though, for
Napamax, quickly showing out in front of
her held, won easing up from Queen Mab.
carrying Louis Ezeli'a colors, showing her
self to be oiiÂ»i of the 'very best two-year
olds yet uncovered here.
The winner is a daughter of tbe dead
sire Maxim from Napa, and this was her
initial start The muchly vaunted Rosor
monde was a . ood third. .
The sport opened with a great dump for
the crowd. Andy Blakely's Snowctow:.
was the supposeu good thing for the mile
purse, but after leading unt 1 within a
lurlong from the wire quit badly and imp.
Fuilerton Lass, a 6J to 1 shot, getting
through on the inside won in a wild drive
from Tar and Tartar, another outsider.
Scimitar, the 'econd choice, was third.
The mile purse affair that followed fur
nished another upset. Ferrier was backed
to a standstill at odd. ot 4 to 5, but ap
peared dead on his legs and was defeated

without much effort by Gene Leigh's
Formal, against which 7to 1 was obtain
able. The mile was covered in I :_.}_.
Naranja, the Baldwin entry, was third.
Salvable struck another soft spot and in
the betting on the mile and a furlong
selling race was barred in most of tbe
books. He made all the inning and won
under a gentle wrap from Camelia, the
Corrigan entry. Marcel finished strong,
taking tbe short end of tbe purse.
Montalvo, which looked a moral for the
mile and an eighth hurdle event, was
scratched, which left it apparently as
much of a "pine" for Reddington, the
Corrigan jumper, which with his stable
companion. The Bachelor, were hot _ to 5
favorites in the betting, coupled. Red
dington soon showed in advance of his
company, and, although developing his
usual tendency of bearing in toward the
rail the last quarter, experienced no diffi
culty in downing Mr. Reel at the finish.
The latter was backed down from threes
to 9to 5. Herman ran a creditable race,
ending up in third position.
In tbe last run of the day, a six-furlong
spin, there was quite a collection of speedy
ones gathered, - among them Preston,
George Miller, Davie* and Salisbury. In
the betting Pat Dunne's brown horse
Preston was a pronounced 1 to 2 choice
around post time, possibly from the effect
of a ton of money bet by the wise ones.
Willie Martin- took all sorts of liberties
witb him the first part of it, and then,
cutting loose in tbe stretch, led out George
Miller by half a length in the slow time
of 1:17. The miserably riddan David was
a close third.

... Notes. . .
Tommy Griffin disposed of Nine Ninety-
Nine to "Frisco" Lind yesterday for $300.
Frisco recently lost Boreas out of a selling
race.
Scimitar was plainly, the. best horse in
the opening event. Jones got him away
last and if tbe distance had been further
'"Curly" Shields' horse would have car
ried away the coin.
The running of tbe horses owned by
Walter Hobart, but carrying the colors of
H. H. Hunn, is causing much comment
in racetrack eire! s. Ferrier was disgrace
fully beaten some days ago at. Oakland by
David, and yesterday his defeat by Formal
should not have been passe i by without
explanation, especially as tbe stable for
some reason did not "go broke" on him.
The Sinner also when at long odds could
carry bis gre\i speed for s x furlongs, but
when the public got aboard he quit going
a shorter distance.
Of late Cash Sloan bas been doing some
{ good work in the saddle, but the ride he
put up on David in the last race will earn
him no laurels. Sent to the front early in
the game, David : would certainly have
won. It seems strange that ne could fin
ish no better than third, with the six fur
longs covered in 1:17.

PUGNACIOUS WILLIE SIMS
Threatens to Whip Jockey
Thorpe and Clerk of Scales
Kuhl.
H s Badge Taken Up and He Can No
Longer Ride at Ingleside
' Track.
Willie Sims, the crack colored rider, bad
the leg up on Snowdown in the opening
race run at Ingleside track yesterday, and
it probably marks bis last appearance
before a crowd of race-goers at the local
track, lor he is now in disgrace.
Sims, who fsavery dressy sort of a chap,
well impressed with himself in public life,
has only been here a couple of weeks,
and during that time has piloted several
winners, among them being Schiller,
| winner of the Thornt n stake. Yesterday
he was up on Snowdown, the "good
thing for the opening race.
The horse led until within a furlong
from the wire, where some jostling oc
curred. â  Charley Thorpe on Tar and
Tartar here headed Snowdown, but
was in turn beaten out by
the outsider. Fuilerton Lass. In
the weighing-room under tbe judges'
stand Sims was very wratby, and threat
ened to land all sorts of swings on the
jaw of Thorpe, whom he accused of
bumping his mount.
The colored lad was cautioned by Cleric
ef the Scales Harry Kuhl that such an
action would not be tolerated in the room,
and Sims then threatened to show Mr.
Kuhl some points in the art of self-defense.
Upon bearing of the jockey's insolent
action Secretary W. S. Leake ordered his
badge to be taken up, and he will not
again be allowed to ride at Ingleside track.
This action of Secretary Leake i- worthy
of commendation and cannot but meet tbe
approval of all racegoers. Jockeys spring
up from stockingless stable-boys, rapidly
develop a liking lor "small bots" and Afri
canese, -trut about hotel corridors as an
earl would in his castle, and the poor ordi
nary mortal who can only ride in ordinary
vehicles and streetcars worth but a
$100,000 or so must kneel in homage
before them. Public and horsemen alike
are tired of these insipid fragments of
humanity whio know not their place,
and the sooner they are brushed off the
turf the better.
SUMMARILY EXPELLED.
Union League Club Resent Anything
Like Extortion. -â  "â¢ 77.7'
OAKLAND, Cal , Feb. âThere was a
very important meeting held by the Union
League Club to-night. For several days
reports have been received stating that
members were collecting money from can
didates under false pretenses. ;:'-7
A few days ago it was reported that a
man named George McLaughlin had ob
tained money from A. C. Henry, the
banker, and an independent candidate for
Mayor. A committee was appointed to

NOW FOR THE GREAT FIGHT
OVER THE FAIR MILLIONS
The Struggle Between Mrs. Craven and the Bonanza
Estate Interests to Open This
Morning.
AN ARMY OF ATTORNEYS I
INTERESTED.
Some of the Peculiar Aspects ol
a Famous Piece of
Litigation. __
PROMISES OF SENSATIONS IN
NUMBER.
Th. Story of Two Wills hid Their
Bearing on the Famous Pencil
Deeds.
What promises to be the most Interest
ing lawsuit in the history of the State
â¢will open before Judge Slack this morn
ingâat least, that is what the court pro
gramme calls for.
It is the fight between Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven and the Fair interests for the pos- i
session of property which the principal of |
tne Mission Grammar School lays claim to
under the famous, pencil deeds.
The case comes up in the nature of a
suit to quiet title between Mrs. Craven
and the special administrator, of the es
tate of the dead millionaire, although in
the background are other interpleaders,
ejectments and many other audi things
that go to complete the complicated liti
gation that has surrounded Fair's millions
since his death. The value of the stake is
about $I,soo,ooo quite a snug sum as
things go, even in this country of big
wealth. X
Tne property Craven claims con
sists of the lot and the big five-story |
building on it on the southwest corner of ;
Pine ana Sansome streets and a half block |
on Mssion street, between Eleventh and i
Twelfth. The deeds under which Mrs. j
Craven asserts her ownership to this lor
tune in land and buildings bear date Sep
tember 27, 1894. and were acknowledged
by ex-Notary J. J. Cooney. The docu
ments are written in ieadpencil, even to
the signatures of Fair himself.
Tne case that is promised this morning :
is, of course, legally speaking, confined
strictly to issues involved in a plain j
suit to quiet title, but undoubtedly there I
will be echoes of other and more interest- j
ing subjects in the evidence. The ghost !
of the famous pencil will â that remarka- !
ble document that the Fair children and
tneir attorneys once swore was genuine
nnd afterward swore was forged â must of
necessity stalk in the background, for tbis
wilt and the deeds are more or less insep- 1
arably related. ' Then there is Mrs. |
Craven's contract of marriage to James G. !
Fair and the trust will to be heard from.
The story of the pencil deeds is an In
teresting chapter in the strange character '
of James G. Fair. Mrs. Craven at ihe
time of their date was living at 2001
Caliiornia -treet. The millionaire and
she were iniimale friends lor years. Sep
arated from his family, the lonely old man
of money was wont to seek in o.her places
the home he could not find for his own.
He had been a frequent caller on Mrs.
Cravenâ her marriage contract bear-- dale '
May 23, 1892 â on the afternoon of Sep
tember "2*, 1894, he was a visitor at her
house. It was rather an eventful time for
"the millionaire, apparently, for he ma c
history in wills and deeds that day that
has kept lawyers and courts since busy
studying it.
â¢The pencil will was written on that
afternoon in Mrs. Craven's parlor in the
presence of the mistress of the house and
Mrs. Elizabeth Haskins. The deeds he
must have drawn up previously, for when
he was through wiil-makiug the bonanza
king drew the documents from h.s
pockets and banded them to the woman
who declares s. c was his wile by contract.
Subsf-quently they were returned to Fair
for acknowledgment, and this is the part
Notary James J. Cooney takes in the
drama. Three days later the millionaire
'called at Cooney's office in the Lick
House and formally admitted that it was
his signature.
Fair died December 23, 1894, and left as
a legacy an estate valued at $16,000,000.
There was a trust will in the hands of
Attorney W. K. Goodfellow, dated Sep
tember 21, 1694, ihree days anterior to the
day of his visit to Mrs. Craven's house on
California street. Under the terms cf
' this will these millions were left in the
custody of W. K. Goodfellow, Thomas R.
Croibers and James S. Angus in trust for
o Mrs. Herman Oelrich"*. Miss Virginia
Fair and Charles L. Fair. The trust
â¢ phase of their inheritance was not to the
liking of the heirs. In fact, from the day
â¢this will made its appearance their attor
neys began to mature plans to fight it.
L"gal storms began to gather on nil sides.
About a month after Fair's death Mrs-
Craven made, public the fact that she was
the guardian of the pencil will. This
document bequeathed the property in three
equal parts outright to the children, and
3 was. received by the attorneys and heirs
With open arms. In it they saw a deliver
ance from the hated trust document, and
â¢ the fi7ht developed into a contest between
the "two" wills, and the Fair children and
the trustees "named by their father.
.Tbe trustees raised the cry of forgery
and -fraud. The children answered that
.the new will was genuine, and intimates
conspiracy and undue influence on the part
â¢of Goodfellow, Angus and Crothers. MrÂ«.
= Qelrichs and her sister and brother fol
lowed this up with a formal protest against
the trust document, and asked the court
to admit the pencil will to probate.
â¢ The existence of Mrs. Craven's deeds
was made known at this time to tbe attor
neys for the heirs. It was her wish toes
cape notoiic'.y in the case, and an agree
â  m-jnt was arrived at, making Richard V.
Dey, one of the executors of Mrs. Fair's
will.'nnarDiter of her claims with power
to ray her $500,000 in settlement. This
was the state or affairs at the end of the
first year after James G. Fair's d-Â»ath.
A decision by Judge Slack on February
3. 1896, that the trust clause ot the Good
fellow will' was invalid was the means of
completely changing the aspect of the
famous case. Charles L. Fair immediately
withdrew his opposition to the document.
This transfer of allegiance was followed
by a declaration that' the pencil will was a
"forgery."
Mrs. Oelrichs, and Miss Fair made a
similar change of front, and the agree
ment to Fettle Mrs. Craven's claims for
$500,000 was repudiated on the grounds
â¢ that both the will and the deeds, were
, spurious. This was followed by the
woman's business agents putting the docu
ments on record, and her own startling
declaration in court that she had a con
tract of marriage to the millionaire. Then
followed voluminous hearinc of testimony
from all the principals in the famous case.
Mrs. Craven, Miss Craven, Mrs. Oelrichs,
Miss Fair, Charles* L. Fair, attorney*, and
witnesses on each side were in turn called
upon to tell their stories. The withdrawal
of the Fair children from the support of
the pencil will left Dr. Marc Levingston,
who was one of the executors under it, as
its only friend. When the trial on this 4
>
document was reached Levingston hauled
it out of court, leaving tbe battle straight
between Mrs. Craven and the Fair people
over the pencil deeds.
This is the manner in which the case
comes up this morning. The charges
against the deeds are that they are forger
ies. To this end ycung Fair has already
had Notary Cooney, who acknowledged
them, arrested on a charge of perjury.
The services of Daniel Ames and Day.d
N. Carvalho, the famous New York ex
perts, have been engaged to back up the
charge of forgery.
On Mrs. Craven'? side is ber statement
that the deeds are genuine and the word
of Mrs. Haskins, who was present when
Fair made tbem, and that of Cooney, who
swears that Fair acknowledged them be
fore him. These of course are but the
principal witnesses. Behind these arc
others in great number not yet known
on either side with their accompanying
promises of sensations and startling de
velopments.*"--:;
The case will be tried by a jury. For
Mrs. Craven appear Attorneys _). M. Del
mas, 8. M. Shortridge, W. W. Foote, S. C.
Denson and J. J. de Haven. The burden
of the fight for the Fair people will fall on
Garret McEnerney, W. M. Pierson and
It. B. Mitchell as the attorneys for the
administrators. The Fairchildren, whose
interests are identical with the adminis
tra ors. will be represented by George A.
Knight, Charles W. Heggerty, Reuben
Lloyd, Russell J. Wilson. Mountford S.
Wilson and Charles L. Wheeler. All in
all. it promises to be a lawsuit tbat will
eclipse the Sharon case in dramatic in
terest.
The Cooney case will be called in Jud_e
Cook's court this morning, but it is prob
able that his attorneys will not introduce
any evidence In his defense at all, but
allow the case to go to a jury.

in 9:54 3 5-
NOW HOLDS A WORLD
. RECORD.
Coulter Celebrates His Reappear*
ance on the Coast by a
Clever Exhibition.
BACON'S SPEEDY MILE-RECORD
TRIAL.
A Splendid Meet at the Velodrome
Track, Marked by Fast Time
and Lightning Finishes.
The Velodrome cycle track and grounds
are evidently a popular resort with the pub
lic, for, despite the many counter attrac
tions on the cards yesterday, a big crowd
assembled there :n the afternoon to wit
ness the bicycle races. The people were
well repaid, as the sport provided was of
an excellent character, marked by fast
time and exciting finishes, with never a
hitch to mar the day's pleasure.
In "the five-mile match race, paced, be
tween W. E. Becker of Minneapolis, the
National champion for the distance, and
Horace Slater of Arizona, who is said to
have a liking for long distances, Becker
put up the most remarkable performance
seen here in many a day. As a match
race the event did not amount to much,
as Siater suffered tn accident to his wheel
early in the journey, and was compelled
to drop out. But Becker kept riding on
and on. lap after lap, constantly calling
to his pacemaker,3 to quicken the pace.
when they were already going at a killing !
gait, and finished amid deafening sp- I
pla use in the startling time of 0:54 3-5,
which lowers the previous world's record
nearly half a minute. The former record
was 10:20, held by the Welsh champion. 1
Michaet, and was made at Manhattan {
Beach, N. V., last fall. At that time this |
was considered a most remarkable per- I
formance, lar eclipsing as it did all pre- !
vious rides at that distance. Michael has i
since ridden it in 9:12, but that was j
against time and not in competition as
was Becker's ride yesterday.
The racing was done by two triplet
teams and a tandem, the former being
manned by R. Dow-Boyden-Freeman and
McCrea-Sulltvan-C. Dow, and the tandem
team being Chapman- Allen. Becker went
the first mile in 1:58, two in 3:54 3-5, three
in 5:55, four in 7:54 3-5 and five in 9:54 3 5,
the last mile being ridden in exactly two J
minutes.
This gives him the professional competi
tion records for all intermediate distances
up to five miles.
Becker ha? been on the coast a couple
of months now and has been looked upon
as a star performer. When he won the
five-mile National championship at Louis
ville last August at the annual meet of
the League of American Wheelmen all
the cracks of the country competed against
him. He has held the Velodrome shield
while here, and won a five-mile race on
Christmas day at the Velodrome against
the Terrill brothers. Wells, Whitman and
' Bovee, all crack professionals. At the
distance he is probably better than any
man on the coast to-day and possibly the
â¢ best in the world.
Only a short time before his ride yester
day be competed in the mile open profes
sional event and won the second heat and
almost had a final, when he swerved and
fell near the tape. The bruises he then
sustained evidently affected him but little,
judging by his later performance.
The Velodrome shield race opened the
day's program and was won by C. E.
Dow of Seattle in 2:16 4-5. He had chal
lenged Whitman of Los Angeles, who has
held the shield for the last three weeks.
Whitman originally won it from Dow.
The result yesterday was a surprise to
many, who thought Whitman the better
man.
The half-mile handicap amateur was
run in five heats and a final, those who
qualified being A. Thiesen, E. F. Russ,
Morris M. Cook, George W. Tantau and
C. D. Gooch. Thia foretold the result of
the final in a measure, as Russ outclassed
his opponents, and he won as he pleased
in 1:03 3-5 from scratch, Gooch second,
Cook third. -MB
The only professional event on the pro
gramme open to all was at a mile, run in
three heats and a final. Slater of Arizona
won the first heat in 2:27 3-5. closely fol
lowed by Byrne of the Imperial Club.
The next heat went to Becker of Minne
apolis, with Freeman, Bay City, a good
second; time, 2:30 3-5. The third heat
was won by Downing of San Jose in 2:27,
Dow of Seattle being second. These quali
tied for the final and the finish was some-,
what of a surprise. Decker had the race
wed in hand unlil he fell mar the tape.
There was then a general scramble to
avoid running over him and his fallen
wheel and Byrne landed across the line a
winner, for tne first t:me in many moons,
Freeman being second and Downing third.
The time ol the final was 2:10 1-5, which
is remarkably fast for a six-man mile race.
C. R. Coulter, the unpaced- mile cham
pion, was down to ride in the open pro
fessional event, but did not feel well and
was scratched. Later he came out for a
half-mile exhibition, unpaced, and did it
it in 1:04 4-5, which is fast going under
the conditions. Coulter will soon round

A MYSTERY IN " CASTE."
When society shall have assembled at the California Theater next Monday
evening to witness a performance for charity there will be one name on the pro
gramme that society does not know; that tbe audience will be at a loss to place.
The young man who is to play the leading part of Captain Hautree in the
comedy of "Caste" is well known here, and yet the stage name that he has as
sumed will hide his identity on the bill as well perhaps as his make-up will dis
guise his personality.
There are hints of a bit of romance making this precaution necessary, and of
paternal objections coupled with an older brother's disapproval of the stage.
However this may be "Selden Stuart" will be in the cast, and, as a play-lover of
pretty Miss Leila Burton, will be a very conspicuous figure before the footlights.
The mystery of bis identity may add a charm to the whole affair for those who
will know by name or reputation all the other young social lights that will take
part in this rollicking little three-act comedy for the benefit of the Armitage
Orphanage and the Children's Hospital.

A fORGED EECEIPT.
â¢Joseph Walsh, a Salosiuan, Booked on
. Two .Serious Charges.
Joseph Walsh, a salesman, was booked
at the City Prison yesterday by. Detectives
Dillon and Crockett on two. charges one
of obtaining goods by false pretenses and
tne other of forgery. -777 i
He was formerly employed at the White
House on Kearny street! On February
12 he went to the hosiery department in
Murphy, Grant & Co.'s and ordered half-a
dozen pairs of ladies' silk hose on the rep
resentation that they were wanted by the
White Hou-c. Questions were asked him,
and he was so familiar with the names in
the White House that begot the goods,
signing the name of "J.Watson" to the
receipt.
Next morning the invoice was sent to
the White House, and they denied order
ing or receiving the goods. The police
were notified and Walsh was arrested.
He acknowledged obtaining the goods,
and pleaded as an excuse that he was
drunk at the time.
A Generous Bequest.
The Maria Kip Orphanage has just received
a very generous bequest from, the late. Mrs.
Ellen Vinsonlialer in the form of twenty-five
shares of the Pacific Gas Improvement Com

A START ON
THE COLLEGES
Dr. R. Beverly Cole Laid the
First Brick in the
First Wall.
With a Few Friends He Cele
brated the Holiday in His
Own Way.
Wanted to Havj the Affiliated
Buildings Date From Wash*
icg'on's Birthday.
4
The first brick in what wdl be the dental
college building of the Affiliated Colleges
was laid yesterday by Dr. R. Beverly Cole.
There was not much of a ceremony, and
â  what exercises there were were of a patri
j otic character. Dr. Cole is dean of the
! medical department of the University of
J California. *7'"7
On March 20 the cornerstone will be
I formally laid, with fitting ceremony and
j in the presence of the Regents, the Gov
: ernor and those who are sufficiently inter-
I ested to attend. It is intended' to make
! that occasion a memorable one.
The grading of* the lot for the colleges
j will be finished a' out the Ist of April,
| after which the buildings will be com
pleted with all possible speed.
The buildings intended for the depart-
I ment of medicine and pharmacy will be
! under one roof at the east end of the prop
| erty. Beside this will ba the dental col
i lege, while on the west end will be located
j the college of law. Those three buildings
will face Parnassus avenue,' formerly J
street, while to the rear, close to the bluff,
I will be located the veterinary, college.
The first stories of all the buildings will
be constructed of Caliiornia granite.
In speaking of. the work yesterday Dr.
; Cole said: "I could not permit so im
i portant an occasion as tbe birthday of
I George Washington* to pass without
j coupling up bis memory with that of the
j Affiliated Colleges of -the great State of
I California. And I thought nothing could
i be more appropriate than to go out there
j and just set half a dozen of bricks on this
| day. If for no other reason than that it
j will go into; history ..that the first brick
I was laid on Washington's birthday in 1897.
"Consequently I did it in the presence
of a few friends "and' at the same lime
made a few remarks such as I now express.
"I -fought .--hard to have tbe colleges
located where they will be, and I trust I
may be soared to see them finished and
occupied. -It will take about two years to
complete the work. But we expect to
have them roofed .in before the end of
eighteen month?."

MR. JULIAN
AS CATERER
Came to the City to Get
Eatables and a Cook
for Fitz.
SAYS THE AUSTRALIAN
IS ALL RIGHT.
Nothing- the Matter With Him,
He Declare., but Too Much
"Mountain Ccffe.."
â 
JIM GROOM "TURNED DOWN"
IN QUICK ORDER.
Stelzn*r Secured to Sparâ Predictions
and Gr*ssip About the Big Fight
A Side Bet.
Martin Julian, brother-in-law and man
ager of Bob Fitzsimmons, arrived yes
terday morning irom Carson in the com
pany of Harry Corbeit and Colonel Burns.
Julian looks fat and healthy. He was
not dressed in his best, but looking to
comfort he had donued a blue sweater and
the conventional cap that is worn by
sporting men of all kinds nowadays.
"How is Bob, Mr. Julian?" was asked.
"Why, brother-in-law is as fine as silk
and is now in condition to hop into a ring
to decide the championship. But you
know that Bob is the champion and I can't
understand why Ccrbett forgets to in
struct the reporters to say so when they
mention Bob's name. He won the title,
you know, by defeating Peter Maher, the
man to whom Corbett cave the title. But
that doesn't cut any ice with us, as Bob
will prove to Corbett and his supporters
on St. Patrick's day that CorDett has no
right claim to any such honor. I don't
fancy saying much now, but you can rest
assured that friend Corbett will be made
to understand the difference between fancy
sparring and good solid punching on the
17th of next month.
"Fitz may not be as good at dancing as
Corbett, but he is a figater, and the al
leged champion is aware that he will
meet hot shot when the time arrives for
exchange, of fistic compliments. I tell
you tbat Fitz cannot lose.
"Well, my object in visiting this City
now is to purchase provisions for Bob.
He wants certain eatable- which I can
not procure in Carson, and 1 have ordered
a whole Ist of stuff to be shipped to the
training quarters Several hampers of
good things will go over the line this
I evening, and the balance will follow in a
| few days.
"Then, again, you know that my sister,
I Mrs. Fitzsimmons, cannot be with 800 to
see to his cooking, etc., as she must at
tend to the wants of my dear old mother,
who is sick in New York:.
"I have secured Sam,' the Chinaman
j who cooked for us in Sausalito when Bob
{ was training for Sharkey, and be will jour
, ney with me this evening to Carson. He
is a first-rate cook and thoroughly under
stands bow to doctor things up for Boh.
"Yes, I haye also secured the services of
Stelzner, the pugilist who was to moet
Jeffries. He says that he is all right and
that the physician of tbe California Club
should not have blistered his back in such
a manner. In fact, Stelzner says that he
believes that it was a put-up job of the
club to avoid putting up the stake he was
to fi<-ht for.
"Stelzner is a good man and I really
think that he can whip Jeffries, but this is
only my opinion. However, Jeffries may
be a great fighter, but nevertheless be is
an untried man and we cannot place any
estimate on his vain -.
"Yes, Stuart is a pretty sick man, but I
guess be will pull through all right. He
is a rustler, and I think he can get away
j with the climate, which is severe on
strangers who do not look out for them
selves."
"How about that side wager, Mr. Julian,
of which so much has been said and writ
ten?" '7-7.
"Well, our money is up. Al Smith, the
stakeholder, has $75.0 of our money. You
know tbat $5000 of that sum is the side
stake and $2500 is the amount I guaran
tee for Fitz's appearance ia* the ring. I
believe that Corbett's money is also up,
and on that point i will have a chat with
Smith when he arrives in Carson.
"Groom, who managed the Sharkey-
Fitzsimmons contest, met me this fore
noon, and what do you think? Why, the
fellow asked ' me to go into another
scheme. He wanted to * have Bob meet
some fighterâ l don't know whom, be
cause I was amused at his impudence in
a contest of ten rounds at the Mechanics'
Pavilion in April, and that we could di
vide the pot. I simply told him that I
j had had enough of the the National Club,
and left him to soliloquize on the side
walk.
"Well, I guess that Bob will fizht pretty
i close on to ISO pounds. He will not re
! duce much in flesh, as be is now as hard
a; nails and feeling as frisky as a colt.
"What do I think of Corbett ?
"Well, to be candid with you, if Bob
looked like Corbett does at present I
would never allow him to enter the ring.
I am afraid that Corbett's friends will say
after Bob has* put him to sleep that Jim
was not in condition, otherwise be could
not lose.
"I can't see how Corbett can be. physi

RAILROAD MEN RESENT "EXAMINER" LIES.
Streetcar Employes Denounce That Paper's Attempt to Represent
Them as "Tools of Officials" as Scurrilous, Preju
diced and Dishonest."
The Examiner is endeavoring to convey the impression to the general public
that the street-railroad employes of San Francisco were coerced into opposing the
bill for the reduction of fares. >. 7- -7
There is absolutely no foundation for any such impression. . ..
I want to say that there was no pressure or influence whatever brought to bear
on the boys by the railroad officials. The officials had no knowledge of the movement
we intended to make until after the petition had been drafted and put into circulation.
The plan emanated entirely from the boys themselves. A number of us origi
nally met at the Mission-street carhouse. W. C. Carpenter was elected chairman of
the committee and I was made secretary. I drafted that petition and it met with the
approval of the boys. It was immediately put into circulation without the knowledge
of the railroad officials and without their being consulted in any way concerning it
or its objects. Within twenty-four hours 3000 signatures were obtained to it. If we
had felt that we could have spared more time before hastening to Sacramento
we could most certainly have obtained the signature of every railroad employe in San
Francisco. 7.7'
_ Concerning our resolutions denouncing the Examiner that paper knows that it is
deliberately lying when it says that those resolutions or their sentiments originated
with any of the railroad officials.
I drafted those tesolutions myself in the hall where and at the time the big
meeting was in session. They were written men and there and not previously, and
they were thereupon signed by that committee immediately before they were read to
the general assemblage and unanimously and enthusiastically applauded. Even the
Examiner representative who was present cannot honestly deny this. 7-7
There was never any intimation from the railroad companies that our wages
would be cut, but we felt that if the bill did pass such would naturally be the result.
So, simply to protect ourselves, we organized to defeat the measure. We sent a dele
gation, of which I was a member, to Sacramento to work against the bill.
The entire expenses of that delegation are borne by the employes themselves.
Subscriptions are now being taken up among the boys to pay not only the expenses of
the delegation but the membsrs for loss of their time, and these subscriptions are
being willingly and readily paid.
I resent tbe imputation that I or that any one of the other members of that dele
gation went to Sacramento as the tools of a corporation. We went there to fight our
own battle, and when we returned victorious it was on our own account that we held
a big jollification meeting and passed resolutions thanking the Senators who bad
given us their support, and denouncing the Examiner for the scurrilous, prejudiced
and dishonest course it had pursued toward street-railroad men in this City.

FRACTURED HIS ARM.
-Singular Accident to Thomas Behan,
an Amateur Baseball Player, at .
Central Park.
Thomas Behan, an amateur baseball
player, met with a singular accident at
Central Park yesterday morning and it
will be a long time before he is able to
play again.
Behan was playing shortstop for Precita
Parlor, N. S. G. W., in their match against
Miller, Sloss & Scott's nine for charity.
The Precitas before the game started went
into the field to practice a little. Behan
was at third base and had made several
catcher and throws. . His brother was at
first base and he called to him to throw
the ball.
Beban drew back his right arm and was
about to throw the ball when his arm fell
helpless to his side and the ball flew off at
a tangent. Behan uttered a cry of pain
and his brother and some of the other
members ran toward him. One of them
lifted his arm np, but the pain was so
excruciating that be drooped it suddenly.
Behan was taken to the Receiving. Hos
pital, where it was found that his arm was
broken in three places between the shoul
der and elbow. The only plausible reason
advanced by the surgeons for the fractures
is that Behan's bones are â¢ exceedingly
brittle and his muscles particularly strong.
A NEW MEDICAL MISSION
Seventh-Day Adventists Will
Treat the Sick Free of
Charge.
An Interesting Religions Movement
With Hea quarters on Mar
ket Street.
. Quite a novel and successful religious
enterprise has recently been started at 1380
Market street by the Seventh-day Ad
ventists. * It is called the Market-street
Mission and its purposes are humane as
well as religious.
The new enterprise is under the control
of Rev. E. E. Andross and Elder H. H.
Dexter. There is a song service every
evening at 7:30 and preaching at 8, fol
lowed by a r-raise service and questions on
the Bible.
"We have a free reading-room open all
day," said Rev. Mr. Andross yesterday,
"and have introduced another feature of
much value in the form of a free clinic.
We have men physicians from 9 io 10 a m.
daily and women from 12 m. to 1 p. m. Tbe
brief experience we have had here shows
that a free clinic is badly needed. There
are many sick men, women and children
in this City who are destitute and need
attention. We also get a great many ap
plications from the unemployed.
"While, the main purpose'of our enter
prise is to revive an interest in religion
and do helpful work in the clinic we are
open for humane work in general. If
people are too ill to call at the mission we
shall try to send some of our physicians
to them."
The sermons to be delivered this week
will be on the nature and obligations of
the Sabbath.
"Subjects are also being considered that
will reveal tne Adventists' view of the
closing work of the Savior," said Rev. Mr.
Andross, "and we hope to elicit consider
able attention from the people."

THEY BOXED HARD
FOR TEN ROUNDS
Spider Kelly Won a Hard
Decision Over Lon
Agnew.
An Evening of Swings and
Uppsrcuts at Woodward's >
Pavilion.
Austra'ian Billy Smith Won a Victory
Over Peppers. of Los An
geles-
The revived California Athletic Club
gave its inaugural entertainment last
evening in Woodward's Pavilion. A fair
crowd was present, but the house was
pretty well papered.
The first brace of pugs to enter the ring
was Patsy Corrigan and Charles Goff,
alias Joe McAuliffe.
Corrigan was no good as a fighter, and
his opponent was still worse. They
mauled each other for four or five rounds,
to the disgust of the spectators.
Billy Smith and Henry Peppers boxed
ten rounds and Smith got the decision, as
he was the aggressor from start to finish.
. The event of the evening was a ten
round bout between Lon Agnew and Spi
der Kelly and it proved to be one of the
most exciting contests that has been
witnessed under the roof of the fighting
pavilion for many moons.
Agnew was a strong favorite, and his
frienas expected to see him win handily,
but he found a pretty tough opponent in
the "Spider," who was trained to a turn.
1 Kelly and his attendants put in an ap
pearance at 10:30 o'clock. Kelly was sec
onded by Dal Hawkins and Young
Mitchell. Agnew soon followed. He was
looked after by George Green and Bert
Brown.
Tom Sharkey was selected by both con
testants to referee the match. Master of
Ceremonies Jordan announced . that the
principals weighed 137 pounds.
Kelly fought well, but he resorted to
several tricks which were not altogether
fair. Agnew soon made himself a strong
favorite with the spectators on account of
his very clean style, which- was free from
clinching and other methods used by some
pugilists to avoid punishment.
ln the first round Agnew immediately
cut out a hot pace and kept his opponent
on the retreat from the time the gong
sounded until it rang again for corners.
Kelly evidently expected a lively mill and
he trained accordingly.
He got away from a few right and left
swings by clever ducking, add as the
round was drawing to a close he dropped
his left glove a dozen times on Agnew's
mouth, but the blows lacked driving
power. SraÃ
Agnew came up as fresh as a Baltimore
oyster for the second round, and immedi
ately resumed the aggressive. He forcd
Kelly to the ropes and tried hard to land
left hooks and swings, but the Spider was
cunning and avoided the blows by swift
ducking. The boys mixed up when the
round was about halt over, and Agnew re
tired with a blood-stained mouth.
It was give and take in the third round,
but Kelly landed the most blows, none of
which seemed to annoy Agnew, who kept
close up to his game, forcing Kelly to
dance from end to end of the rim- to avoid
some jaw-disturbers that were aimed at
him. .
In the fourth round Agnew fought very
wickedly and warmed the Spider's jaw,
but the blows landed too far back toward
Kelly's ear to do damage.
Alter a very lively exchange Agnew
though he had an excellent chanc. to send
the Spider to dreamland, and he swan.
his right which missed tie point of Kel
ly's jaw by half an inch and Agnew fell
under the ropes, Kelly giving him a slight
push as ha was going downward. This
round was about equal in points.
The fifth round was very exciting. Ag
new grew tired of being jabbed in the
mouth, as Kelly was continually getting
his left fist over his opponent's guard and
Lon determined to get into close quarters.
A hot scrimmage resulted, and Kelly time
and again grabbed Agnew by the
legs to avoid upper-cuts and nooks. "Kelly
was growing tired, and resorted to clinch
ing tactics, which style of fighting did not
please the spectators in the least. Agnew
fought a great battle to the end, but failed
to land any of. his favorite hooks and
swings, all of which were cleverly ducked
by the Spider.
Referee Sharkey awarded the battle to
Kelly, although nearly all present thought
that Agnew should' have the decision.
Kelly landed the most blows, but Agnew
was the aggressor from first to last, and in
a finish fight would certainly have won,
as the Spider was showing strong signs oi
weakness at the end of the tenth round.
A draw would have been the right thing.
Suicide of a Chinese.

THE MYSTERY OF
FOUR SMALL SAWS
They Were Found in a
Window of the City
Prison.
Captain Robinson Failed to Re
port the Discovery to
Chief Crow'ey.
A Rigid Investigation Will Likely
Be Made Into City Prison
Methods.
A discovery alleged to have been made
by Captain Robinson of the City Prison
'about three weeks ago may lead to com
plications that were never anticipated.
About that time the captain said he
found a small parcel stuck through the
steel- wire screen of one of the windows
looking into the "tanks," where prisoners
are confined pending investigation. On
opening the parcel he found it contained
four steel saws from six to eight inches
long and about half an inch wide. The
parcel had been shoved into the wire
screen from the outside.
The captain locked the saws in the
drawer of his desk and did not consider itv
necessary to notify Chief Crowley or any J
of the desk sergeants of his discovery. The f
only person who was in his confidence was
a "trusty," who is now en joying his lib
erty, having completed his sentence.
By some means the finding of the saws
leaked out on Sunday, and it was reported
that they were put there with the 'object
of effecting a j til de livery. - Such an idea
was so preposterous that it was at once re
jected, and various surmises were made aa
to who put the saws there and what waa
the motive that prompted the act. The
probability is that Chief Crowley will in
sist upon a full investigation, as he said
yesterday he could not understand why
Captain Robinson should not have re
ported the matter to him at once.
Guarding all the windows in the City
Prison are chilled steel bars about six
inches apart and about one and a half
inches thick. There are two rows of these
bars, one on the outside and the other on
the inside, and between them is a thick
steel wire screen. The saws and the bars
are about the same quality of steel and to
attempt to saw any of the bars would be
a case of diamond cut diamond. It would
be utterly impossible to sever the bars
with such saws.
Assuming that tbe saws had been put
there with such an object, none of the
prisoners could have got possession of
them without collision with one of the
"trusties." The cells are from twelve to
fourteen feet from the windows, and the
prisoners are confined behind iron bars,
so that it was impossible for them to get
the saws without the assistance of a
"trusty."
"I cannot understand," said Chief
Crowley, yesterday, "why Captain Robin
son could be so derelict in hisduty as not to
report the finding o the saws to me. Of
course it is absurd to imagine for a
moment that there could be any idea of a
jail delivery, and it is not worth while
discussing such a proposition, but why the
thing bas been kept so secret is what I
cannot fathom. I have been unable to
see Captain Robinson to get his ex
planation, and therefore am unable to say
anything more about it,"
As stated in Sunday's Call, Captain st
Robinson has preferred charges against '
D.sk Sergeant Shields for not visiting the
"tanks" every half hour, as required by
an order of the Chief, and it is said that
when the case is heard before the Com
missioners to-morrow night there will be
interesting developments regarding the
workings of the City Prison.
One of the results of the investigation
will probably be the abolition of the
"trusty" system in the prison and the
appointment of salaried guards.
